'''''{{lang|pl|Bigos}}''''' ({{IPA-pol|ˈbʲiɡɔs}}; {{lang-be|бігас}},{{sfnp|Krapiva|2003|p=389}} ''{{transl|be|bihas}}'', or бігус,{{sfnp|Martynav|1978|p=348}} ''{{transl|be|bihus}}''), often translated into English as '''hunter's stew''', is a [[Polish cuisine|Polish]] dish of chopped meat of various kinds stewed with [[sauerkraut]] and shredded fresh cabbage. The dish is also traditional for [[Belarusian cuisine|Belarusian]],  [[Ukrainian cuisine|Ukrainian]] and [[Lithuanian cuisine|Lithuanian]] cuisine.{{sfnp|Szymanderska|2010|p=517}}{{sfnp|Pokhlebkin|2004|p=113}}

== Etymology ==
The Polish word ''{{lang|pl|[[wikt:bigos|bigos]]}}'' is probably of German origin, but its exact etymology is disputed. According to the Polish loanword dictionary edited by Elżbieta Sobol, it may derive from German ''{{lang|de|begossen}}'', meaning "doused" or "basted".{{sfnp|Sobol|1995|loc=[http://netsprint.swo.pwn.pl/haslo.php?id=3112 "bigos"]}} Jerzy Bralczyk similarly derives the word from archaic German ''{{lang|de|Beiguss}}'', "sauce".{{sfnp|Bralczyk|2014|p=15}} [[Aleksander Brückner]] has proposed German ''{{lang|de|Bleiguss}}'', "piece of lead",{{sfnp|Brückner|1927|loc=[[s:pl:Słownik etymologiczny języka polskiego/bigos|"bigos"]]}} as a possible source, referring to a tradition of divining from strangely shaped flakes of molten lead dropped into water. Maria Dembińska rejects this etymology as "doubtless erroneous", suggesting instead either archaic German ''{{lang|de|becken}}'', "to chop", or old German ''{{lang|de|bîbôz}}'' (''{{lang|de|Beifuss}}'' in modern German), meaning "mugwort" (''[[Artemisia vulgaris]]''), a herb that was popular in medieval cuisine.{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|p=21}} Andrzej Bańkowski also points to Italian ''{{lang|it|bigutta}}'', or "pot for cooking soup", as a possible derivation via German.{{sfnp|Bańkowski|2000|p=51}}

== Ingredients and preparation ==
The principal ingredients of ''{{lang|pl|bigos}}'' are assorted kinds of meat chopped into bite-sized chunks and a mixture of [[sauerkraut]] (pickled [[cabbage]]) and shredded fresh white cabbage. The meats may include [[pork]] ([[ham]], shoulder, [[bacon]], [[Ribs (food)|ribs]], [[Pork loin|loin]], etc.), [[beef]] and [[veal]], [[poultry]] ([[Chicken as food|chicken]], [[Duck (food)|duck]], [[Domestic goose|goose]], [[Turkey meat|turkey]]) and [[Game (hunting)|game]], as well as [[charcuterie]], especially various kinds of ''{{lang|pl|[[kiełbasa]]}}'', or Polish smoked sausage.{{sfnp|Kuroń|2004|pp=113–114}}{{sfnp|Strybel|Strybel|2005|pp=320, 778–779}}{{sfnp|Szymanderska|2010|p=249}} The variety of meats is considered essential for good ''{{lang|pl|bigos}}''; its preparation may be a good occasion to clean out one's freezer and use up leftovers from other meat dishes.{{sfnp|Strybel|Strybel|2005|p=31}}{{sfnp|Applebaum|Crittenden|2012|p=184}}{{sfnp|Monaghan|2011}} Some of the meats may be roasted before being diced together with other cuts of meat and braised in [[lard]] or [[vegetable oil]].{{sfnp|Kuroń|2004|pp=113–114}}{{sfnp|Strybel|Strybel|2005|p=320}}

[[File:Bigos-445017.jpg|thumb|left|Closeup of ''{{lang|pl|bigos}}'']]
The sauerkraut is often rinsed and drained before being chopped and mixed with shredded fresh cabbage. The proportion depends on the sauerkraut's maturity – the longer it has cured, the more sour it tastes, calling for more fresh cabbage to balance the flavor. Traditionally, cabbage was pickled in fall, so ''{{lang|pl|bigos}}'' made at that time could be made with only half-cured sauerkraut, but by early spring, the sauerkraut had to be combined in equal parts with fresh cabbage.{{sfnp|Kuroń|2004|p=113}} The mixture is precooked in a small amount of water before being mixed with the braised meat and left to simmer for several hours. Ideally, the stew should thicken through evaporation alone,{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|pp=23, 169}} but flour, [[roux]], crumbled rye bread or a grated raw potato may be added to it to take up excess moisture.{{sfnp|Strybel|Strybel|2005|p=454}}{{sfnp|Kuroń|2004|p=112}}{{sfnp|Lemnis|Vitry|1979|p=248}}

Other ingredients often added to ''{{lang|pl|bigos}}'' include [[onion]]s, diced and browned in lard together with the meat, and dried forest [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]]{{sfnp|Strybel|Strybel|2005|p=396}} that are precooked separately in boiling water. The stew is usually seasoned with salt, [[black pepper]]corns, [[allspice]], [[juniper berry|juniper berries]] and [[Laurus nobilis|bay leaves]].{{sfnp|Strybel|Strybel|2005|p=43}} Some recipes also call for [[caraway]], [[clove]]s, [[garlic]], [[marjoram]], [[mustard seed]]s, [[nutmeg]], [[paprika]] and [[thyme]].{{sfnp|Kuroń|2004|pp=113–114}}{{sfnp|Strybel|Strybel|2005|pp=56, 59}} The tart flavor of sauerkraut may be enhanced by adding some dry [[red wine]]{{sfnp|Strybel|Strybel|2005|p=320}}{{sfnp|Lemnis|Vitry|1979|p=248}} or beet sour (fermented [[beetroot]] juice that is also a traditional ingredient of [[borscht]]), which may impart a reddish hue to the stew.{{sfnp|Strybel|Strybel|2005|p=28}}{{sfnp|Kuroń|2004|p=112}} ''{{lang|pl|Bigos}}'' is often slightly sweetened with sugar, [[honey]], [[raisin]]s, [[prune]]s or plum butter known in Polish as ''{{lang|pl|[[powidl|powidła]]}}''.{{sfnp|Strybel|Strybel|2005|p=732}}{{sfnp|Szymanderska|2010|p=249}}

[[File:Żywność - 032.JPG|thumb|A bowl of ''{{lang|pl|bigos}}'']]
Traditionally, ''{{lang|pl|bigos}}'' is stewed in a cauldron over an open fire or in a large pot on a stove, but it may also be prepared in an electric [[slow cooker]].{{sfnp|Strybel|Strybel|2005|p=10}} The contents should be stirred from time to time, to prevent scorching, which may impart a bitter taste to the entire batch.{{sfnp|Strybel|2007|p=80}} ''{{lang|pl|Bigos}}'' is considered best after it has been repeatedly refrigerated and reheated to allow the flavors to fuse.{{sfnp|Strybel|Strybel|2005|p=173}}{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|pp=169}}

== Varieties ==
The flexible and forgiving recipe for ''{{lang|pl|bigos}}'' allows a great number of variants, often simply using what ingredients are at hand.{{sfnp|Monaghan|2011}} It is often claimed that there are as many recipes as there are cooks in Poland.{{sfnp|Applebaum|Crittenden|2012|p=184}}{{sfnp|Spysz|Turek|2014|loc=Chapter 26}}

In the region of [[Greater Poland]], ''{{lang|pl|bigos}}'' typically contains [[tomato paste]] and is seasoned with garlic and marjoram.{{sfn|Lista produktów tradycyjnych|loc=[http://www.minrol.gov.pl/Jakosc-zywnosci/Produkty-regionalne-i-tradycyjne/Lista-produktow-tradycyjnych/woj.-wielkopolskie/Bigos-wielkopolski Bigos wielkopolski]}} [[Kuyavia]]n ''{{lang|pl|bigos}}'' is often made from [[red cabbage]] as well as white.{{sfnp|Szymanderska|2010|p=163}} In [[Silesia]], it is usually mixed with ''{{lang|pl|[[kopytka]]}}'' or ''{{lang|pl|kluski}}'', that is, small plain boiled dumplings made from unleavened dough that contains flour and [[mashed potato]]es.{{sfnp|Strybel|Strybel|2005|p=475}}{{sfn|Lista produktów tradycyjnych|loc=[http://www.minrol.gov.pl/Jakosc-zywnosci/Produkty-regionalne-i-tradycyjne/Lista-produktow-tradycyjnych/woj.-slaskie/Bigos-slaski Bigos śląski]}}{{sfnp|Szymanderska|2010|p=408}} A variant which contains [[Julienning|julienned]] apples, preferably with a winey tart taste, such as [[Antonovka]], is known as Lithuanian ''{{lang|pl|bigos}}'' and is typical for the territory of the erstwhile [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] (now Belarus and Lithuania).{{sfnp|Szymanderska|2010|p=517}}{{sfnp|Pokhlebkin|2004|p=113}}

In ''{{lang|pl|bigos myśliwski}}'', or "hunter's ''{{lang|pl|bigos}}''", at least part of the meat comes from game, such as [[wild boar]], [[venison]] or [[hare]].{{sfnp|Kuroń|2004|p=113}} It is usually seasoned with juniper berries, which help neutralize [[off-flavor]]s that may be found in the meat of wild animals.{{sfnp|Strybel|Strybel|2005|p=45}}

== Serving ==
[[File:Bigos in Kraków.jpg|thumb|''{{lang|pl|Bigos}}'' served in a bread bowl with a glass of beer to wash it down]]
As a dish that does not spoil quickly and only gets tastier with each reheating, ''{{lang|pl|bigos}}'' has been traditionally used as a provision for travellers{{sfn|Chwalba|2008|p=152}}{{sfnp|Gloger|1900|loc=[[s:pl:Encyklopedia staropolska/Bigos|"Bigos"]]}} and campers or consumed at outdoor events, such as a hunt or a carnival sleigh ride known in Polish as ''{{lang|pl|[[kulig]]}}''.{{sfnp|Olszewska Heberle|2005|p=8}}{{sfnp|Kuroń|2004|p=112}}{{sfnp|Strybel|2007|pp=77, 210}} It may be also eaten indoor, for breakfast, supper or as a hot starter served before soup at a dinner party.{{sfnp|Strybel|Strybel|2005|p=164}}{{sfnp|Spysz|Turek|2014|loc=Chapter 26}} It is commonly found on the menus of [[Bar mleczny|milk bars]], pubs and bistros throughout Poland.{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|p=21}} ''{{lang|pl|Bigos}}'' is particularly associated with major Catholic holidays, such as [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]], as it can be prepared in ample quantities beforehand and only reheated on the holiday itself and the following days.{{sfnp|Olszewska Heberle|2005|p=8}}{{sfnp|Lemnis|Vitry|1979|p=248}}

The stew is typically dished up with [[rye bread]] or boiled potatoes.{{sfnp|Monaghan|2011}}{{sfnp|Strybel|2007|p=92}} 
In a fancier setting, it may be served in stoneware bowls,{{sfnp|Strybel|Strybel|2005|p=164}} [[puff pastry]] shells{{sfnp|Strybel|Strybel|2005|p=175}} or [[bread bowl]]s. ''{{lang|pl|Bigos}}'', especially when enjoyed outdoor, is traditionally paired with shots of chilled [[vodka]], either clear or flavored.{{sfnp|Lemnis|Vitry|1979|p=248}} Varieties of flavored vodka that match well with ''{{lang|pl|bigos}}'' include ''{{lang|pl|[[żubrówka]]}}'' ([[Hierochloe odorata|bison grass]]), ''{{lang|pl|jałowcówka}}'' (juniper), ''{{lang|pl|[[piołunówka]]}}'' ([[Artemisia absinthium|wormwood]]), ''{{lang|de|[[Goldwasser]]}}'' (various herbs) and ''{{lang|pl|[[starka]]}}'' (oak-aged).{{sfnp|Strybel|Strybel|2005|p=173}}{{sfnp|Gloger|1900|loc=[[s:pl:Encyklopedia staropolska/Bigos|"Bigos"]]}} If served at home or in a restaurant, the stew may be washed down with beer, red wine or [[Riesling]].{{sfnp|Ermochkine|Iglikowski|2003|pp=31–32}}{{sfnp|Monaghan|2011}}

== History ==
According to Polish food historian Maria Dembińska, ''{{lang|pl|bigos}}'' may derive from a medieval dish known in [[Medieval Latin|Latin]] as ''{{lang|la|compositum}}'', or "mixture". It was made from various vegetables, such as cabbage, chard and onions, that were chopped or shredded, layered inside an earthenware three-legged [[Dutch oven]] and braised or baked.{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|p=150}} A remnant of this old procedure may be found in a ''{{lang|pl|bigos}}'' recipe, in which bacon and cabbage are arranged in layers, from the 19th-century Russian cookbook, ''[[A Gift to Young Housewives]]'' by [[Elena Molokhovets]].{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|p=22}} Similar, layered dishes of medieval origin exist in other European cuisines; they include the Italian ''{{lang|it|mescolanza}}'' (known in 16th-century Poland under the Polonized name, ''{{lang|it|miszkulancja}}'') and the [[Alsace|Alsatian]] ''{{lang|gsw|[[Baeckeoffe]]}}''  (also known as ''{{lang|fr|[[potée]] boulangère}}''), made from cabbage, leftover meats and fruits.{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|pp=20–21}} They are reminiscent of a rustic Polish casserole, known in various regions as ''{{lang|pl|pieczonka, prażonki, duszonki, maścipula}}'', etc. It is traditionally made from sliced or diced potatoes, onions, carrots, sausages and bacon arranged in layers inside a cast-iron cauldron greased with lard and lined with cabbage leaves, which is placed in bonfire embers for baking.{{sfnp|Szymanderska|2010|pp=578, 580}}{{sfn|Lista produktów tradycyjnych|loc=[http://www.minrol.gov.pl/pol/Jakosc-zywnosci/Produkty-regionalne-i-tradycyjne/Lista-produktow-tradycyjnych/woj.-slaskie/Porebskie-prazonki Porębskie prażonki]}}{{sfn|Lista produktów tradycyjnych|loc=[http://www.minrol.gov.pl/pol/Jakosc-zywnosci/Produkty-regionalne-i-tradycyjne/Lista-produktow-tradycyjnych/woj.-malopolskie/Prazone-prazonki-polanskie Prażone – prażonki polańskie]}}

The word "''{{lang|pl|bigos}}''" is not attested before the 17th century.{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|p=22}} At that time, it referred to any dish of finely chopped components, usually meat or fish – but no cabbage – doused generously with melted butter and heavily seasoned with sour, sweet and spicy ingredients.{{sfnp|Dumanowski|Jankowski|2011|p=213}} {{lang|pl|[[Stanisław Czerniecki]]}}, head chef to Prince {{lang|pl|[[Aleksander Michał Lubomirski (d. 1677)|Aleksander Michał Lubomirski]]}}, who consistently used the diminutive form ''{{lang|pl|bigosek}}'', included several recipes for it in his ''{{lang|la|[[Compendium ferculorum, albo Zebranie potraw|Compendium ferculorum]]}}'' (''A Collection of Dishes''), the first cookbook published originally in Polish, in 1682. They include ''{{lang|pl|bigosek}}'' prepared with chopped [[capon]],{{sfnp|Czerniecki|1682|p=33}} [[hazel grouse]],{{sfnp|Czerniecki|1682|p=35}} [[carp]], [[Northern pike|pike]],{{sfnp|Czerniecki|1682|p=56}} and [[Crayfish as food|crawfish]] with beef [[Bone marrow (food)|marrow]].{{sfnp|Czerniecki|1682|p=25}} Seasonings that appear in most of these recipes include onions, [[wine vinegar]], [[lemon]] or [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] juice, [[verjuice]], [[sorrel]], sugar, raisins, black pepper, [[cinnamon]], nutmeg, cloves and [[cumin]]. A manuscript recipe collection from the {{lang|pl|[[Radziwiłł]]}} family court, dating back to ca. 1686, contains instructions for cooking ''{{lang|pl|bigos}}'' of roast beef,{{sfnp|Dumanowski|Jankowski|2011|p=139}} fried fish{{sfnp|Dumanowski|Jankowski|2011|p=155}} and even chopped ''{{lang|fr|[[crêpe]]s}}'' (thin pancakes).{{sfnp|Dumanowski|Jankowski|2011|p=173}} ''{{lang|pl|Kucharz doskonały}}'' (''The Perfect Cook''), a cookbook published by [[Wojciech Wielądko]] in 1783, contains recipes for beef, veal, wether [[mutton]], [[oyster]], as well as root vegetable ''{{lang|pl|bigos}}'' (the latter was a mixture of carrots, [[parsnip]], [[rutabaga]] and [[celeriac]]).{{sfnp|Dumanowski|2015}}{{sfnp|Dumanowski|2012}}

''{{lang|pl|Bigos}}'' made entirely of meat and exotic spices was affordable only to the affluent Polish [[szlachta|nobility]]. The 18th century saw the development of a poor man's version of the dish, known as ''{{lang|pl|bigos hultajski}}'', or "rascal's ''{{lang|pl|bigos}}''", in which vinegar and lemon juice were replaced with cheaper sauerkraut as the source of tartness.{{sfnp|Dumanowski|Jankowski|2011|p=213}} Sauerkraut and cabbage also acted as a filler allowing to reduce the amount of meat in the dish. Rascal's ''{{lang|pl|bigos}}'' became common during the reign of King [[Augustus III of Poland]] (r. 1734–1763).{{sfnp|Kitowicz|1840|p=146}} Over the course of the 19th century, its rise in popularity continued as the proportion of meat decreased in favor of sauerkraut, eventually superseding all other kinds of ''{{lang|pl|bigos}}'' and losing the disparaging epithet in the process.{{sfnp|Dumanowski|2012}}

{{Quote box|quote=&lt;poem&gt;
In the pots warmed the bigos; mere words cannot tell
Of its wondrous taste, colour and marvellous smell.
One can hear the words buzz, and the rhymes ebb and flow,
But its content no city digestion can know.
To appreciate the Lithuanian folksong and folk food,
You need health, live on land, and be back from the wood.
Without these, still a dish of no mediocre worth
Is bigos, made from legumes, best grown in the earth;
Pickled cabbage comes foremost, and properly chopped,
Which itself, is the saying, will in one's mouth hop;
In the boiler enclosed, with its moist bosom shields
Choicest morsels of meat raised on greenest of fields;
Then it simmers, till fire has extracted each drop
Of live juice, and the liquid boils over the top,
And the heady aroma wafts gently afar.
Now the bigos is ready. With triple hurrah
Charge the huntsmen, spoon-armed, the hot vessel to raid,
Brass thunders and smoke belches, like camphor to fade,
Only in depths of cauldrons, there still writhes there later
Steam, as if from a dormant volcano's deep crater. &lt;/poem&gt;

''{{lang|pl|Bigos}}'' is considered a Polish [[national dish]],{{sfnp|Strybel|Strybel|2005|p=396}} which, according to American food historian William Woys Weaver, "has been romanticized in poetry, discussed in its most minute details in all sorts of literary contexts, and never made in small quantities."{{sfnp|Dembińska|1999|pp=169}}

The most famous literary monument to ''{{lang|pl|bigos}}'' can be found in ''{{lang|pl|[[Pan Tadeusz]]}}'', a [[mock-heroic]] poem venerated as the Polish national epic, extolling the country life of Polish noblemen in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, written by [[Adam Mickiewicz]] in 1834. It describes a group of men out in the woods, enjoying the stew of "wondrous taste, colour and marvellous smell" after a successful bear hunt.

[[File:Hino Nacional Brasileiro instrumental.ogg|thumb|U.S.-performed rendition]]
The "'''[[Brazil]]ian [[National anthem|National Anthem]]'''" ({{lang-pt|Hino Nacional Brasileiro}}) was composed by [[Francisco Manuel da Silva]] in 1831 and had been given at least two sets of unofficial lyrics before a 1922 decree by President [[Epitácio Pessoa]] gave the anthem its definitive, official lyrics, by [[Osório Duque-Estrada|Joaquim Osório Duque-Estrada]], after several changes were made to his proposal, written in 1909.

The anthem's lyrics have been described as [[Parnassianism|Parnassian]] in style and [[Romanticism|Romantic]] in content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soportugues.com.br/secoes/curiosidades/hino.php|title=Você entende o Hino Nacional Brasileiro?|work=Só Português|language=Portuguese|quote=You understand the Brazilian National Anthem? The National Anthem, symbol of exaltation of country, is a very complex song. Besides having unusual words, its lyrics are rich in metaphors. The text follows the Parnassian style, which explains the presence of flowery language and syntactic inversions, which hinder the understanding of the message. Thus, the prioritization of the beauty of form in the composition of the hymn compromised clarity. You, who already know how to sing the national anthem, do you know it because of its melody and tune, or do you know it for the meaning of its message? Most people, despite their mastery of the lyrics, are ignorant of their meaning. The following is the national anthem. Note the words highlighted and their definitions in parentheses. You'll likely be surprised by the things that you have always proclaimed, without, in fact, being aware of it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The melody of the Brazilian national anthem was composed by Francisco Manuel da Silva, and was presented to the public for the first time in April 1831.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clerioborges.com.br/hinonacional.html#0002&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 April 1831, the first Brazilian Emperor, [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]], abdicated the Crown and days later left for Europe, leaving behind the then-five-year-old Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]].

From the proclamation of the independence of Brazil in 1822 until the 1831 abdication, an anthem that had been composed by Pedro I himself, celebrating the country's independence (and that now continues to be an official patriotic song, the ''[[Hino da Independência|Independence Anthem]]''), was used as the national anthem. In the immediate aftermath of the abdication of Pedro I, the anthem composed by him fell in popularity.

Francisco Manuel da Silva then seized this opportunity to present his composition, and the anthem written by him was played in public for the first time on April 13, 1831.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clerioborges.com.br/hinonacional.html#0002&lt;/ref&gt; On that same day, the ship carrying the former Emperor left the port of Rio de Janeiro. The date of April 13 now appears in official calendars as the ''Day of the Brazilian National Anthem''.

As to the actual date of composition of the music presented in April 1831, there is controversy among historians. Some hold that Francisco Manuel da Silva composed the music in the last four months of 1822 to commemorate Brazil's independence (declared on 7 September 1822), others hold that the hymn was written in early 1823 and others consider the evidence of composition dating back to 1822 or 1823 unreliable, and hold that the Anthem presented on 13 April 1831 was written in 1831, and not before.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miniweb.com.br/cidadania/hinos/historia/hist_hino_nacional.html&lt;/ref&gt; In any event, the Anthem remained in obscurity until it was played in public on 13 April 1831. In style, the music resembles early [[Romantic period in music|Romantic]] [[Italy|Italian]] music such as that of [[Gioachino Rossini]].

Initially, the music composed by Francisco Manuel da Silva was given lyrics by Appeals Judge Ovídio Saraiva de Carvalho e Silva not as a national anthem, but as a hymn commemorating the abdication of Pedro I and the accession of Pedro II to the Throne. It was known during this early period as "April 7 Hymn".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clerioborges.com.br/hinonacional.html&lt;/ref&gt; The lyrics by Ovídio Saraiva soon fell out of use, given that they were considered poor, and even offensive towards the Portuguese. The music, however, continued enjoying sustained popularity, and by 1837 it was played, without lyrics, in all public ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clerioborges.com.br/hinonacional.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Although no statute was passed during the imperial period to declare Francisco Manuel da Silva's musical composition as the national anthem, no formal enactment was considered necessary for the adoption of a national anthem. A national anthem was seen as resulting from praxis or tradition. Thus, by 1837, when it was played in all official solemnities, Francisco Manuel da Silva's composition was already the Brazilian National Anthem.

A new set of lyrics was proposed in 1841, to commemorate the coming of age and Coronation of Emperor Pedro II; those lyrics, popular but also considered poor, were soon abandoned too, this time by order of Emperor Pedro II, who specified that in public ceremonies the anthem should be played with no lyrics. Emperor Pedro II directed that Francisco Manuel da Silva's composition, as the national anthem of the [[Empire of Brazil]], should be played, without lyrics, on all occasions when the monarch presented himself in public, and in solemnities of military or civilian nature; the composition was also played abroad in diplomatic events relating to Brazil or when the Brazilian Emperor was present.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clerioborges.com.br/hinonacional.html&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Empire of Brazil]] era, the U.S. composer and pianist [[Louis Moreau Gottschalk]], then residing in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, composed two nationalistic works of classical music based on the Brazilian National Anthem that achieved great popularity during the imperial period: the ''Brazilian Solemn March'' ("Marcha Solene Brasileira", in the modern Portuguese spelling or "Marcha Solemne Brazileira", in the original spelling in force at the time of composition&lt;ref&gt;Because the spelling of Brazil with a "z" became obsolete in the Old Republic due to changes in the orthography of the Portuguese language, and the country's name has since then been spelled with an "s" in Portuguese - Brasil - sometimes the title of that composition is rendered as "Marcha Solemne Brasileira", the adjective "Solemne" retaining the 19th century spelling, while the adjective "Brasileira" is rendered in the modern spelling to avoid writing the country's name with a "z".&lt;/ref&gt;) and the ''Great Triumphal Fantasy on the Brazilian National Anthem'' ("Grande Fantasia Triunfal sobre o Hino Nacional Brasileiro"). The former was dedicated to Emperor Pedro II, and the latter was dedicated to his heiress presumptive, [[Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil|the Princess Imperial Isabel, comtesse d'Eu]]. Those works are in the vein of similar compositions written at the time in other Nations, such as [[Charles Gounod]]'s ''Fantasy on the Russian National Anthem''. The ''Grand Triumphal Fantasy'', long forgotten, resurfaced in popularity in 1985, at the dawn of Brazil's ''New Republic'', during the country's re-democratization process, when it was played to accompany the funeral cortège of President Tancredo Neves.

After the Proclamation of the Republic in 1889, the new rulers made a competition in order to choose a new anthem, and the competition was won by a music composed by [[Leopoldo Miguez]], with lyrics by [[Medeiros e Albuquerque]]. After protests against the adoption of the proposed new anthem, however, the Head of the Provisional Government, [[Deodoro da Fonseca]], formalized Francisco Manuel da Silva's composition as the national anthem, while the composition by Miguez and Medeiros e Albuquerque was declared the [[Brazilian Republic Anthem|Anthem of the Proclamation of the Republic]]. Dedoro himself was said to prefer the old anthem to the new composition that became the anthem of the Proclamation of the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/andersonantunes/2014/07/02/a-brief-history-of-the-brazilian-national-anthem-and-why-it-is-the-tune-of-the-world-cup/ A Brief History of the Brazilian National Anthem, And Why it is the Tune of the World Cup&lt;/ref&gt; The Decree of the Provisional Government (Decree 171 of 1890) confirming Francisco Manuel da Silva's music, that had served as the National Anthem of the Empire of Brazil, as the National Anthem of the new Republic, was issued on 20 January 1890.

In the early days of the new Federal Republic, the National Anthem continued without official lyrics, but several lyrics were proposed, and some were even adopted by different states of Brazil. The lack of uniform, official lyrics would only be terminated in 1922, during the celebrations of the first centennial of the Proclamation of Independence, when an adapted version of Joaquim Osório Duque Estrada's lyrics, first proposed in 1909, were deemed official.

The official lyrics of the Brazilian National Anthem were proclaimed by decree of President Epitácio Pessoa (Decree 15.761 of 1922), issued on 6 September 1922, at the height of the celebrations of the Independence Centennial. This presidential decree was issued in accordance with authorization contained in a legislative decree adopted by Congress on 21 August 1922. Furthermore, as allowed by the said legislative decree, and before the President of the Republic issued his decree proclaiming the official adoption of Joaquim Osório Duque Estrada's lyrics as the official lyrics of the National anthem, the Federal Government finalized the purchase of the lyrics written by Duque Estrada, signing with the composer the contract that transferred all the rights of authorship over the said lyrics to the Federal Union, and paying the agreed price of 5:000$ (five ''contos'' of réis). 

On 7 September 1922, on the exact day of the Independence Centennial, radio broadcasts began in Brazil, and the first broadcast was the performance of the National Anthem with the new lyrics, followed by the speech by President Epitácio Pessoa, the first radio address by a Brazilian President.

The national anthem is considered by the current Constitution of Brazil, adopted in 1988, to be one of the four national symbols of the country, along with the Flag, the Coat of Arms and the National Seal. The legal norms currently in force concerning the national anthem are contained in a statute passed in 1971 (Law 5.700 of 1 September 1971), regulating the national symbols. This law regulates in great detail the form of the national anthem and how and when it is to be played.

The music of the national anthem was originally intended to be played by symphonic orchestras; for the playing of the anthem by bands, the march composed by Antão Fernandes is included in the instrumentation. This adaptation, long in use, was made official by the 1971 statute regulating national symbols. This same statute also confirmed as official the traditional vocal adaptation of the lyrics of the national anthem, in F major, composed by Alberto Nepomuceno.

Due to the fact that the traditional vocal adaptation composed by Alberto Nepomuceno for Joaquim Osorio Duque Estrada's lyrics of the national anthem was made official in 1971, other vocal arrangements (as well as other instrumental arrangements departing from the one recognized in law) are unofficial. Because of that, for the remainder of the Military Regime era (that lasted until 1985), the playing of the anthem with any artistic arrangement that departed from the official orchestration and vocal adaptation was prohibited, and there was strict vigilance regarding the use of the National Symbols and the enforcement of this norm. Since the redemocratization of the country, far greater artistic liberty has been allowed regarding renderings of the national anthem. Singer [[Fafá de Belém]]'s interpretation of the national anthem (initially criticized during the final days of the Military Regime, but now widely accepted), is an example of that. In any event, although the use of different artistic arrangements for the anthem is now permitted (and although the statutory norms that prohibited such arrangements are no longer enforced, on the grounds of constitutional freedom of expression), a rendering of the national anthem is only considered fully official when the statutory norms regarding the vocal adaptation and orchestration are followed. However, the traditional vocal adaptation composed by Alberto Nepomuceno was so well established by the time it became official that the interpretations of the national anthem that depart from the official orchestration or from the official vocal adaptation are few. Indeed, although other arrangements are now allowed, the traditional form tends to prevail, so that, with few exceptions, even celebrity singers tend to only lend their voices to the singing of the official vocal adaptation by Alberto Nepomuceno.

The anthem is sung in Brazil's official national language, the Portuguese language.

==Lyrics==
The song consists of two consecutive [[stanzas]]. The adoption in 1922 of lyrics containing two stanzas thus created the present situation of the music of the anthem being played twice so as to allow for the singing of both stanzas.

Brazilian law stipulates that the music needs to be played only once in instrumental renditions of the anthem without vocal accompaniment (thus, in instrumental renditions without vocal accompaniment, the playing of the music twice is optional), but both stanzas must be sung in vocal performances.

The second stanza is often dropped when played at sporting events, as most renditions of the Brazilian National Anthem for sporting events are instrumental and not vocal.

In the lyrics, the opening line's mention of the Ipiranga river refers to the stream near (and now part of) the city of São Paulo where Prince Dom Pedro, the future Emperor Dom Pedro I of Brazil, declared Brazilian independence from Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;http://nationalanthems.me/brazil-hino-nacional-brasileiro/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Heraldic achievement}}

In [[heraldry]], '''cadency''' is any systematic way of distinguishing otherwise identical [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] belonging to members of the same family.  Cadency is necessary in heraldic systems in which a given design may be owned by only one person  at once, generally the head of the senior line of a particular family.  Because heraldic designs may be used by sons whilst their father is still alive, some form of differencing may be required so as not to usurp the father's arms, known as the '''undifferenced''' or "plain coat". Historically arms were only heritable by males and therefore cadency marks have no relevance to daughters, except in the modern era in Canadian and Irish heraldry. These differences  are formed by adding to the arms small and inconspicuous marks called '''brisures''', similar to [[Charge (heraldry)|charge]]s but smaller. They are placed on the [[Fess|fess-point]], or in-chief in the case of the label.&lt;ref name="Britannica-11-p704"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, 9th edition (1884), vol. 11, p. 704&lt;/ref&gt; Brisures are generally exempt from the [[rule of tincture]]. One of the best examples of usage from the medieval period is shown on the seven Beauchamp cadets in the stained-glass windows of [[Collegiate_Church_of_St_Mary,_Warwick|St Mary's Church]], Warwick.&lt;ref name="Britannica-11-p704" /&gt;

== Background ==
{{expand section|date=October 2017}}

Historically, it was recognised that there was a need to difference the arms of the head of the family from those of cadets. This need was recognised in Europe during the 14th century; various means to accomplish this were utilized.

Presently, differencing arms for those entitled to is generally rarely done in Continental Europe. It is only in Scotland where the need to difference cadets is enforced.

== Ways of differencing ==
{{expand section|date=October 2017}}
In heraldry's early period, uniqueness of arms was obtained by a wide variety of ways, including:
*changing [[tincture (heraldry)|tincture]]
*adding a [[label (heraldry)|label]] or bordure
*adding, removing, or replacing an ''[[ordinary (heraldry)|ordinary]]''.  
*varying the [[Line (heraldry)|lines of partition]] of an ordinary
*the use of ''brisures'' or marks of difference

See [[List of coats of arms of the Capetian dynasty|Armorial of Capetians]] and [[List of coats of arms of the House of Plantagenet|Armorial of Plantagenet]] for an illustration of the variety.

== Systems ==
Systematic cadency schemes later developed in England and Scotland, but while in England they are voluntary (and not always observed), in Scotland they are enforced through the statutorily required process of matriculation in the Public Register.

The English system of cadency involves the addition of these brisures to the plain coat:

* for the first son, a [[label (heraldry)|label]] of three points (a horizontal strip with three tags hanging down)—this label is removed on the death of the father, and the son inherits the plain coat;
* for the second son, a [[crescent]] (the points upward, as is conventional in heraldry);
* for the third son, a [[mullet (heraldry)|mullet]] (a five-pointed star);
* for the fourth son, a [[martlet]] (a kind of bird);
* for the fifth son, an [[annulet (heraldry)|annulet]] (a ring);
* for the sixth son, a [[Fleur-de-lis|fleur-de-lys]];
* for the seventh son, a [[Rose (heraldry)|rose]];
* for the eighth son, a [[cross moline]];
* for the ninth son, a double [[quatrefoil]].

Daughters have no special brisures, and normally use their father's arms on a [[Lozenge (heraldry)|lozenge]], together with any marks of cadency their father may use. This is because English heraldry has no requirement that women's arms be unique. On marriage, they impale their father's arms to the [[Dexter and sinister|sinister]] with those of their husband to the [[Dexter and sinister|dexter]], unless the woman happens to be a [[heraldic heiress]], into which case her father's arms are borne on an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|inescutcheon]] on her husband's arms.

In England, arms are generally the property of their owner from birth - subject to the use of the appropriate mark of cadency.  In other words, it is not necessary to wait for the death of the previous generation before arms are inherited.

The eldest son of an eldest son uses a [[label (heraldry)|label]] of five points. Other grandchildren combine the brisure of their father with the relevant brisure of their own, which would in a short number of generations lead to confusion (because it allows an uncle and nephew to have the same cadency mark) and complexity (because of an accumulation of cadency marks to show, for example, the fifth son of a third son of a second son).  However, in practice cadency marks are not much used in England and, even when they are, it is rare to see more than one or, at most, two of them on a coat of arms.

At times arms with a cadency mark may be used on a hereditary basis: for instance, the arms of the [[Earl Russell|Earls Russell]] are those of the [[Duke of Bedford]] differenced by a mullet, as the [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|1st Earl]] was the third son of the [[John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford|6th Duke]].

Although textbooks on heraldry (and articles like this one) always agree on the English system of cadency set out above, most heraldic examples (whether on old bookplates, church monuments, silver and the like) ignore cadency marks altogether.  Oswald Barron, in an influential article on Heraldry in the 1911 edition of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', noted:

{{quote|Now and again we see a second son obeying the book-rules and putting a crescent in his shield or a third son displaying a molet, but long before our own times the practice was disregarded, and the most remote kinsman of a gentle house displayed the "whole coat" of the head of his family.|&lt;ref&gt;Oswald Barron, s.v. "Heraldry", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1911&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nor have cadency marks usually been insisted upon by the [[College of Arms]] (the heraldic authority for England, Wales and formerly Ireland).  For example, the College of Arms website (as of June 2006), far from insisting on any doctrine of "One man one coat" suggested by some academic writers, says:

{{quote| … The arms of a man pass equally to all his legitimate children, irrespective of their order of birth.

Cadency marks may be used to identify the arms of brothers, in a system said to have been invented by [[John Writhe]], [[Garter Principal King of Arms|Garter]], in about 1500. Small symbols are painted on the shield, usually in a contrasting tincture at the top. …|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/About/12.htm|title=Registering a Pedigree - College of Arms|author=|date=|website=www.college-of-arms.gov.uk|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It does not say that such marks ''must'' be used.

In correspondence published in the [[The Heraldry Society|Heraldry Society]]'s newsletter, [[Garter King of Arms]] [[Peter Gwynn-Jones]] firmly rejected a suggestion that cadency marks should be strictly enforced.  He said:

{{quote|I have never favoured the system of cadency unless there is a need to mark out distinct branches of a particular family.  To use cadency marks for each and every generation is something of a nonsense as it results in a pile of indecipherable marks set one above the other.  I therefore adhere to the view that they should be used sparingly.&lt;ref&gt;''The Heraldry Gazette'' December 2007 New Series 106 pp 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a second letter published at the same time, he wrote:

{{quote|Unfortunately, compulsion is not the way ahead for twenty-first century heraldry.  However, official recognition and certification of any Armorial Bearings can only be effected when the person in whose favour the Arms are being recognized or certified appears in the appropriate book of record at the College of Arms.  I believe it right in England and Wales for a branch to use cadency marks sparingly and only if they wish to do so.|&lt;ref&gt;''The Heraldry Gazette'' December 2007 New Series 106 p 9&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Scotland ===
The system is very different in Scotland, where every male user of a coat of arms may only use arms recorded (or "matriculated") in the Public Register with a personal variation, appropriate to that person's position in their family, approved  by the [[Lord Lyon]] (the heraldic authority for Scotland).  This means that in Scotland no two men can ever simultaneously bear the same arms, even by accident, if they have submitted their position to the Scottish heraldic authorities (which not all do in practice, in Scotland as in England); if they have not done so, the matter falls under statute law and may result in proceedings in the Lyon Court, which is part of the Scots criminal justice system.  To this extent, the [[Law of Arms|law of arms]] is stricter in Scotland than in England where the only legal action possible is a civil action in the Court of Chivalry, which sits extremely rarely and is not an integrated part of the English justice system.

Scotland, like England, uses the [[label (heraldry)|label]] of three points for the eldest son (or heir presumptive)  and a label of five points for the eldest son of the eldest son, and allows the label to be removed as the bearer of the plain coat dies and the eldest son succeeds.
[[Image:Differencing (Scottish heraldry).svg|thumb|Differencing system in Scottish heraldry]]

For cadets other than immediate heirs, Scottish cadency uses a complex and versatile system, applying different kinds of changes in each generation.  First, a [[bordure]] is added in a different [[tincture (heraldry)|tincture]] for each brother.  In subsequent generations the bordure may be divided in two tinctures; the edge of the bordure, or of an [[ordinary (heraldry)|ordinary]] in the base coat, may be changed from straight to indented, engrailed or invected; [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]s may be added.  These variations allow the family tree to be expressed clearly and unambiguously. (The system outlined here is a very rough version that gives a flavour of the real thing).

In the Scots heraldic system (which has little to do with the clan system), only one bearer of any given surname may bear plain arms.  Other armigerous persons with the same surname usually have arms derived from the same plain coat; though if actual kinship cannot be established, they must be differenced in a way other than the cadency system mentioned above.  This is quite unlike the English system, in which the surname of an [[armiger]] is generally irrelevant.

=== Canada ===
Canadian cadency generally follows the English system. However, since in [[Canadian heraldry]] a coat of arms must be unique regardless of the bearer's sex, Canada has developed a series of brisures for daughters unique to Canada:&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.heraldry.ca/course_canadian.htm Heraldry proficiency program - Canadian Heraldic Information] (April 5, 2007) ''Heraldry.ca''. Accessed 2008-08-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

* for the first daughter, a [[Heart (symbol)|heart]];
* for the second daughter, an [[Ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] spot;
* for the third daughter, a [[snowflake]];
* for the fourth daughter, a fir twig;
* for the fifth daughter, a [[rook (chess)#Rooks in heraldry|chess rook]]
* for the sixth daughter, an [[Scallop#Symbolism_of_the_shell|escallop]] (scallop shell);
* for the seventh daughter, a [[harp]];
* for the eighth daughter, a [[buckle]];
* for the ninth daughter, a [[clarichord]].

The actual practice in Canada is far from the rigidity suggested by the list of differences above - and is best seen in action in the Canadian Public Register - see for example the coats of various [http://archive.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=1030&amp;ShowAll=1 Armstrongs], [http://archive.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=2135&amp;ShowAll=1 Ravignats] and [http://archive.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=286&amp;ShowAll=1 Bradfords].

=== South Africa ===

Personal arms registered at the [[Bureau of Heraldry]] may be differenced upon matriculation (which is voluntary).  Current policy is that younger children's arms must be differenced if they are matriculated.  Methods used include the English and Scottish systems, the substitution of different charges, the changing of lines, and the changing of tinctures and or adding a border to the shield.

=== Ireland ===

The brisures used in the arms granted by the Chief Herald of the Republic of Ireland are identical to the brisures used by the system used in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but unlike the English system, which only uses these brisures for the sons of an armiger in order of birth, the Irish system applies them to all the children of the armiger, irrespective of sex, and, as illegitimacy has no place in Irish heraldry, these marks are assigned to (recognised) children born outside of marriage as well as inside.

There are no actual "rules" for members of the [[royal family]], because their arms are theoretically decided ''ad hoc'' by the monarch. In practice, however, a number of traditions are practically invariably followed. At birth, members of the royal family have no arms. At some point during their lives, generally at the age of eighteen, they may be granted arms of their own. These will always be the "[[arms of dominion]]" of the monarch with a [[label (heraldry)|label]] [[argent]] for difference; the label may have three or five points. Since this is in theory a new grant, the label is applied not only to the shield but also to the [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] and the supporters to ensure uniqueness.  Though ''de facto'' in English heraldry the crest is uncharged (although it is supposed to be in theory), as it would accumulate more and more cadency marks with each generation, the marks eventually becoming indistinguishable, the crests of the royal family are always shown as charged.

Each [[Prince of Wales]] uses a plain white label and (since 1911) an [[inescutcheon]] of the ancient [[Coat of Arms of the Principality of Wales|arms of the Principality of Wales]]. Traditionally, the other members of the family have used a stock series of symbols (cross of [[Saint George]], [[heart (symbol)|heart]], [[anchor]], [[fleur-de-lys]], etc.) on the points of the label to ensure that their arms differ. The labels of the [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]] and [[Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex|Duke of Sussex]] have one or more [[scallop]] shells taken from the arms of their mother, [[Diana, Princess of Wales]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/William.htm Arms of Princes William and Harry, showing differencing] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527221941/http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/William.htm |date=May 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this is sometimes called an innovation but in fact the use of maternal [[charge (heraldry)|charges]] for difference is a very old practice, illustrated in the "border of France" (''azure semé-de-lys or'') borne by [[John of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall]] (1316–36), younger son of [[Edward II of England]] and [[Isabella of France]].

It is often said that labels argent are a peculiarly royal symbol, and that eldest sons outside the royal family should use labels of a different colour, usually [[gules]].

== Continental usages ==

===  France  ===
{{main|Capetian Armorial}}
During the Middle Ages, marks of cadency were used extensively by armigers in France, as can be seen in the Armorial de Gelre.  By the eighteenth century, such marks were no longer used by the members of armigerous families, but were still used extensively by the members of the French Royal Family.

The French Revolution of 1789 had a profound impact on heraldry, and heraldry was abolished in 1790, to be restored in 1808 by Napoleon I. However, Napoleon's heraldic system did not use marks of cadency either; the decree of March 3, 1810 (art. 11) states: "The name, arms and livery shall pass from the father to all sons" although the distinctive marks of Napoleonic titles could pass only to the sons who inherited them.

No subsequent regime in France ever promulgated any legislation regarding marks of difference in heraldry, so they remain unused (except in the heraldry of Sovereign Houses, such as the former Royal family, as can be seen below, or the [[House of Lorraine]]).

The royal arms of France featured golden fleurs-de-lys on a blue field (Azure, semy-de-lys Or). King Charles V simplified it to three fleurs-de-lys on a blue field (Azure, three fleurs-de-lys Or).

The sons of [[Louis VIII of France|Louis VIII]] and [[Blanche of Castile]] used golden castles on a red background (derived from the arms of Castile) as charges to difference their arms: for Robert, a label; for Alphonse, a semy of castles; for Charles, a bordure. This initial system of differencing was dropped in favor of a longer-lasting simpler system. Charles, the youngest son of Louis VIII, changed his arms in favor of the arms of France with a plain label gules.

The simpler system primarily used four marks of difference: the label, the bordure, the bend, and the bordure engrailed. The tinctures used were gules; a compony of argent and gules; and argent. They occasionally came up with more unusual forms, such as a bordure-label gules and a bordure gules charged with eight plates.

Initially, the arms were attributed to the cadet. Thus, even when [[Philip the Bold]] exchanged his [[appanage]] of [[Touraine]] in favor of [[duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], he retained the arms he had received as [[Duke of Touraine]] (but quartered it with the arms of Burgundy). Another example will be [[Charles de Valois, Duc de Berry|Charles]], younger brother of Louis XI. By the seventeenth century, the arms became associated with titles. The bordure gules was associated with Anjou, and the label argent with Orléans. Thus, when a cadet exchanged his appanage, his arms changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/frdiffer.htm|title=Marks of Difference in the French Royal Family|first=Francois|last=Velde|date=|website=www.heraldica.org|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Germany  ===

German noble houses did not use cadency marks as systematically as their European peers &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dr-bernhard-peter.de/Heraldik/seite38.htm|title=realtime.at - Domain gecatcht|author=|date=|website=www.dr-bernhard-peter.de|accessdate=6 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321004148/http://www.dr-bernhard-peter.de/Heraldik/seite38.htm#|archive-date=2009-03-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A nobleman's sons were not generally obliged or expected not to bear their father's arms and often did just so.

The most common means of differencing was the use of different [[crest (heraldry)|heraldic crests]] to mark apart otherwise identical achievements borne by different branches of a family. Other, less frequent forms include counter-changing or the replacement of individual tinctures, or the addition of ordinaries. Bordures and labels were used occasionally, though not doctrinally. Perhaps the most prominent German family to adopt a system of bordures was the [[House of Hohenzollern]].

As a result of the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Empire's]] heavy fragmentation, which form saw more prominent use and when was also influenced by general trends and geographic proximity; for example, the heraldic tradition of the [[Low Countries]] and the [[Rhineland]] saw a great deal of influence by its [[French heraldry|French]] neighbor.

The following heraldic system was adopted by a royal decree in 1815 and would last until 1907.

Since 1907, the system has differed. Wilhelmina further decreed that in perpetuity her descendants should be styled "princes and princesses of Orange-Nassau" and that the name of the house would be "Orange-Nassau" (in Dutch "Oranje-Nassau"). Since then, individual members of the House of Orange-Nassau are also given their own arms by the reigning monarch, similar to the United Kingdom. This is usually the royal arms, quartered with the arms of [[Prince of Orange|the principality of Orange]], and an in escutcheon of their paternal arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Wapens van leden van het Koninklijk Huis| work = Coats of Arms of the Dutch Royal Family, Website of the Dutch Monarchy, the Hague | publisher = Rijksvoorlichtingsdienst (RVD), the Hague, the Netherlands | url =http://www.koninklijkhuis.nl/onderwerpen/wapens/inhoud/wapens-van-leden-van-het-koninklijk-huis| accessdate = 30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Since 1907, There is no system to delineate individual princes and princesses via their arms.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Portugal ===
The Portuguese systems of differencing have their origins in the regulations of King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]], who ruled Portugal from 1485 to 1521. There are two systems, one for the non-Royal families and the other for the Royal House.

==== Noble families ====
The Portuguese system of differentiation for the noble non-Royal families is unlike any other cadency system. It is true that the bruiser personalises the arms, however, since the Portuguese have an arbitrary choice of surnames, they may select any family name from the father's or mother's side of their genealogical table and a coat of arms, which does not have to coincide with it. Thus, the system of differencing only serves to show from which ancestral line the arms are derived. The head of the lineage uses the arms without a difference, but should he be the head of more than one family, the arms are combined by quartering. The heir apparent to the arms of the head of a lineage never uses a mark of difference.

==== Royal house ====

'''''Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered''''' is a [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[Raven Software]] and published by [[Activision]]. A remastered version of ''[[Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare]]'', it was released worldwide on November 4, 2016 for the [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. It is available as a [[Product bundling|bundle]] with either the Legacy, Digital Deluxe or Legacy Pro editions of ''[[Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare]]'', with physical versions requiring the ''Infinite Warfare'' disc inserted to access the remaster. A standalone edition of the game was released on June 27, 2017 for the PlayStation 4, and July 27, 2017 for Xbox One and Microsoft Windows.

''Modern Warfare Remastered'' began as a result of a fan-made petition, with Raven Software being approached to develop a remaster of ''Modern Warfare'', having previously assisted on the development of multiplayer modes for past installments in the series. ''Remastered'' builds upon the original by featuring extensive graphical, [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]], and lighting enhancements, updated animations, remastering original sound effects as well as adding new, and offers numerous small improvements while retaining the original core gameplay. Extras such as new multiplayer content and additional [[Achievement (video gaming)|achievements]] and cheats are also included.

Upon release, ''Modern Warfare Remastered'' received positive reviews. Praise was given for the significantly improved graphics, sound, and range of enhancements, in addition to the gameplay for having aged well and providing challenge. While critics overall felt the game was fresh and grounded in realism, some criticized the dated narrative and the shallowness of the multiplayer (although new online content would later be distributed through post-release updates). Further complaints focused on certain design choices retained from ''Modern Warfare'' and the [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]]. ''Remastered'' was also the subject of controversy for Activision's decisions to initially only release it as part of a bundle, the incorporation of [[microtransaction]]s, and the determined pricing of the [[downloadable content]] and standalone version of the game.

==Gameplay==

''Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered'' features the same core gameplay as the original version, which is a [[first-person shooter]] that has the player take control of several characters, however it includes several minor modifications.&lt;ref name="DG Interview"&gt;{{cite web|title=How ‘Modern Warfare Remastered’ updated the classic without ruining it|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-interview/|website=Digital Trends|accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in the prone position, the player's equipped weapon is now visible, and during the act of crawling, the [[gamepad]] will give [[Haptic technology#Video games|feedback]] as the gun makes contact with the ground. The game utilizes "dual render technology" for sniper rifle scopes when aiming, providing the player with a view of the scope and blurred surroundings, as opposed to a black screen representing the scope interior present in the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All Ghilled Up Comparison – COD4 Vs Modern Warfare Remastered|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_3129325145&amp;feature=iv&amp;src_vid=ReOoZbWixlc&amp;v=VFayTIFmlKc|website=YouTube|accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the campaign, new predetermined first-person animations are present on a few occasions, for example, when removing a [[non-player character]]'s bonds during one of the levels.&lt;ref name="WC Changes made"&gt;{{cite web|title=More Modern Than Ever Before: Everything you need to know about Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered|url=http://www.windowscentral.com/call-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-impressions|website=Windows Central|accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NGN Changes made"&gt;{{cite web|title=Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered Panel Recap – COD XP 2016|url=http://www.newgamenetwork.com/article/1528/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-panel-recap-cod-xp-2016/|website=New Game Network|accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pressing down on the gamepad's [[D-pad]] in multiplayer when a weapon is equipped will initiate a brief animation to "taunt" opponents, such as allowing the player to inspect the exterior of their gun.&lt;ref name="WC Changes made"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered – How to Inspect Weapons|url=http://twinfinite.net/2016/11/modern-warfare-remastered-inspect-weapons/|website=Twinfinite|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign is all but identical to the original. It keeps the same collectibles and cheats as before, with the addition of several new cheats, such as exaggerated physics that fling enemies backwards as they are killed, and replacing the heads of non-player characters with watermelons.&lt;ref name="MWR Cheats"&gt;{{cite web|title=Modern Warfare Remastered Adds Four Great New Cheats|url=http://kotaku.com/modern-warfare-remastered-adds-4-great-new-cheats-1787450260|website=Kotaku|accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game offers full [[PlayStation Network]] [[PlayStation Network Trophies|trophy]] and [[Xbox Live]] [[Xbox Live Achievement system|achievement]] support (trophies of which had been absent from the PlayStation 3 version of ''Modern Warfare,'' due to the game releasing before they were introduced&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/no-ps3-trophies-for-resistance-or-cod4|title=No PS3 Trophies for Resistance or COD4|last=Purchese|first=Robert|date=2008-07-03|website=Eurogamer|language=en-UK|access-date=2017-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;), with the inclusion of several new challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Call of Duty 4 Remaster PS4 Trophies Revealed, Including One Really Interesting One|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-4-remaster-ps4-trophies-revealed-incl/1100-6444126/|website=GameSpot|accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Remastered'' features an updated version of the multiplayer that shares similarities with those featured in later ''Call of Duty'' games.

==Plot==
{{See also|Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare#Plot}}
&lt;!-- Do not add the full plot or copy it from the original game's article. We are using a much terser summation. Reader can click back to original article for fuller version. --&gt;
''Modern Warfare Remastered'' features the same plot as the original game. The player acts as a member of the [[United States Marine Corps]] and the [[Special Air Service|SAS]] and takes on missions to fight against a separatist group in the [[Middle East]] as well as an ultranationalist group in [[Russia]].

While the United States invades a small, oil rich Middle Eastern country following a [[coup d'état]] by the extremist Khaled Al-Asad, a British Special Air Service (SAS) squad infiltrates a cargo ship found to be carrying a nuclear device. The ship is sunk by enemy jets, but the SAS team escapes with its manifest, and then heads to Russia to rescue their informant, codenamed "Nikolai", from the Ultranationalist party. The intelligence from these operations indicate Al-Asad has a Russian nuclear device. The U.S. military launches an assault on Al-Asad's palace, but the nuclear device is detonated, wiping out most of the city along with everyone in it.

The SAS team tracks down Al-Asad in [[Azerbaijan]], and discover that he was working with Imran Zakhaev, the leader of the Ultranationalist party. The mission then flashes back 15 years where Captain Price, who was a Lieutenant at the time, is sent alongside his commanding officer, Captain MacMillan, on a failed assassination attempt on Imran Zakhaev in [[Pripyat]], [[Ukraine]]. After killing Al-Asad, the SAS team, with support from U.S. [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Marine Force Recon]] and Russian loyalists, attempt to capture Zakhaev's son and learn his whereabouts. They ambush him, but he commits suicide. In response, Zakhaev seizes control of a nuclear launch facility. A joint operation is launched to take back the site, but Zakhaev launches [[intercontinental ballistic missiles]] at the U.S. [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]]. The joint teams are able to breach the facility and remotely destroy the missiles before fleeing the area.

Zakhaev's forces trap the escaping joint force on a bridge, and during the fight many are killed. Zakhaev arrives and begins executing wounded soldiers, when a loyalist helicopter arrives and distracts him. The player uses their pistol to kill Zakhaev.

=== Characters ===
The player mainly controls British Special Air Service (SAS) recruit Sergeant John "Soap" MacTavish for most of the game, starting with his enrollment in the 22nd SAS Regiment. The player also controls United States Marine Corps (USMC) Sergeant Paul Jackson during five of the levels on Act 1. [[Captain Price|Captain John Price]] (voiced by actor [[Billy Murray (actor)|Billy Murray]]) is an SAS officer who is playable in two flashback missions from 1996 in which he is still [[Lieutenant]]. The player also assumes the role of an American thermal-imaging TV operator aboard a [[Lockheed AC-130]] gunship during one level, and a British SAS operative infiltrating a hijacked airliner to save a VIP in a secret level titled "Mile High Club". Finally, the player may control Yasir Al-Fulani, the [[president]] of the unnamed Middle Eastern country in the game before he is executed, although he has no freedom of action beyond turning his head.

After an online petition signed by fans of ''Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare'' was released requesting that a remaster of the game be developed, series publisher Activision became interested in carrying out such a project.&lt;ref name="WC Changes made"/&gt; The company approached Raven Software, who had developed multiplayer modes for several ''Call of Duty'' titles in the past, to be the primary developer, overseen by [[Infinity Ward]] who would act as executive producer.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.activision.com/articles/en_US/FAQ/Call-of-Duty-Modern-Warfare-Remastered-FAQ#collapse12|title=FAQ|last=|first=|date=May 2, 2016|website=|publisher=[[Activision|Activision Support]]|accessdate=May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raven's studio director David Pellas recalled that "not a single person at Raven turned away and said no. It was a universal, "yeah, we’re there."" Development of ''Modern Warfare Remastered'' began in early 2015.&lt;ref name="VG247 Interview"&gt;{{cite web|title="We cannot fuck with the game design" – Raven Software's terrifying responsibility of remaking Call of Duty: Modern Warfare|url=https://www.vg247.com/2016/09/07/we-cannot-fuck-with-the-game-design-raven-softwares-terrifying-responsiblity-of-remaking-call-of-duty-modern-warfare/|website=VG247|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The developers had pledged to focus on four key areas throughout development: respecting the original game, modernizing the visuals and audio, improving the overall experience with new technology, and redefining what the term "remaster" meant.&lt;ref name="NGN Changes made"/&gt; The majority of ''Modern Warfare'' was consequently "rebuilt from the ground up" for ''Remastered''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered – Interview with Ryan Burnett, Executive Producer at Raven Software|url=https://blog.activision.com/t5/Call-of-Duty/Call-of-Duty-Modern-Warfare-Remastered-Interview-with-Ryan/ba-p/10034443|website=Activision Games Blog|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; through the revitalisation of the original's source codes, materials, layouts, and effects that Raven were given access to from Infinity Ward. The game runs in full [[1080p]] resolution at 60 [[frames per second]] and uses the latest iteration of the series' [[game engine]] that was present at the time.&lt;ref name="HCG Interview Page 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Raven Director David Pellas Goes In-Depth on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered|url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2016/09/09/raven-software-director-david-pellas-goes-in-depth-on-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered/224324/|website=Hardcore Gamer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raven wanted the game to provide a nostalgic experience for fans of ''Modern Warfare'',&lt;ref name="NGN Changes made"/&gt; while introducing it to newcomers by connecting them to a world that they were used to in recent ''Call of Duty'' games, albeit one that mirrored reality.&lt;ref name="VG247 Interview"/&gt;  Pellas noted that the risk of negative fan reactions resulting from any small changes made to the original and the desire to meet high expectations was daunting for Raven, saying "There was a realization that this is freaking terrifying, because it's not just important to us". To assist in their decision-making, they reviewed a large number of internet forums where active players of ''Modern Warfare'' could be found in order to understand what they would want from a re-release of the game. Raven were encouraged by their principle of keeping the core gameplay unchanged, a decision that remained consistent throughout the process as respecting the experience of the original was essential. Subtle improvements were made to both the controls and timing of existing animations, such as the transition between aiming a sniper rifle and the scope overlay appearing, but were designed to be as close to identical as possible.&lt;ref name="DG Interview"/&gt;

In order to bring ''Modern Warfare''{{'}}s visuals up to modern standards, enhancements of the environments and vistas were achieved using a procedure called "Paint-over", with a larger amount of onscreen objects and effects being integrated into them. Raven also wanted to give the environments a sense of place and history to avoid feeling generic.&lt;ref name="WC Changes made"/&gt; The vast majority of objects were remodeled, with the game using improved texture depth, physically-based rendering, and light-reflection; and additional features such as realistic physics and joints employed for movable objects like character models. Raven paid close attention to improving every gun in the game because, as a developer explained, "We needed to take the weapons up to the same level of personality as the characters"; each received better dynamics, alterations made to their firing mechanisms, and a new feature in the series that allowed each type to eject shell casings unique to that weapon.&lt;ref name="WC Changes made"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NGN Changes made"/&gt; Raven faced some issues during the remastering of the game's graphics as the remaster used a heavily upgraded version of the series' engine. As a result, this meant that several of ''Modern Warfare''{{'}}s visual assets were not compatible with the new technology, so the developers were necessitated to remake them.&lt;ref name="DG Interview"/&gt; Most of the existing [[motion capture]] animation was redone for the same reason, as well as to provide further story exposition.&lt;ref name="HCG Interview Page 2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Modern Warfare Remastered Features Detailed|url=http://opshead.com/article/1704/new-modern-warfare-remastered-features-detailed|website=Opshead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign saw a number of new first-person animations similarly added for further immersion and emotional responses from players, and to improve how the camera made use of the player character's body, enhancing the "body sense". Pellas said, "I think that for [the single-player] campaign, we were definitely more liberal with our animations and additions, as long as they enhanced the true intent of the moment." The artificial intelligence of non-player characters was also improved to respond more realistically with the environment, and vice versa, such as long grass reacting to the player character's presence.&lt;ref name="WC Changes made"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DG Interview"/&gt;

The existing audio was remastered using reverberation, depth, and spatial effects to enhance the overall ambiance of the game;&lt;ref name="HCG Interview Page 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Raven Director David Pellas Goes In-Depth on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered|url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2016/09/09/raven-director-david-pellas-goes-in-depth-on-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered/225256/|website=Hardcore Gamer|accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; one example a developer from Raven made note of is that "Layering out multiple sounds now makes a big difference".&lt;ref name="WC Changes made"/&gt; A range of other sound effects that were not present in ''Modern Warfare'' were also used, including unused audio channels that had been created for the original, but due to restraints had not been included during its development.&lt;ref name="NGN Changes made"/&gt; The original music and voice performances were retained, with the exception of the campaign dialogue spoken by Al-Asad in Arabic which was amended and re-recorded,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Watch how Modern Warfare Remastered's campaign stacks up to the original|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-10-05-watch-how-modern-warfare-remastereds-campaign-stacks-up-to-the-original|website=Eurogamer|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a slight alteration in the voice acting for Zakhaev during part of a speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered – Imran Zakhaev's Speech Audio Comparison (MWR vs COD4)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7zVmmHUhfY|website=YouTube|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these updates, the game received an array of new features. A few new cheats were incorporated into the game's campaign, while keeping the same cheats and intel file collectibles from the original.&lt;ref name="MWR Cheats"/&gt; The multiplayer initially remained largely unchanged in terms of content from ''Modern Warfare''.

===Reveal===
News of ''Modern Warfare Remastered'' was leaked on [[Reddit]] on April 27, 2016 prior to its announcement. The leak revealed a screenshot of a reservation card for the online store [[Target Corporation|Target]] that included the Legacy Edition of ''Infinite Warfare'' and the bundled remaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/04/27/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-leaked-5844308/|title=Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered leaked|last=|first=|date=April 27, 2016|website=Metro|publisher=|access-date=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Call of Duty''{{'}}s official [[Twitter]] account responded with an [[emoji]] tweet later that day, seemingly confirming that a remaster of ''Modern Warfare'' existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Call Of Duty 4 Remastered Apparently Confirmed With Poop Emoji|url=http://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-4-remastered-apparently-confirmed-with-poo-1773511391|website=Kotaku|accessdate=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Release===
''Modern Warfare Remastered'' was released worldwide on November 4, 2016 for the [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]] and [[Microsoft Windows]], alongside the Legacy, Digital Deluxe and Legacy Pro editions of ''[[Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare]]''.

''Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered'' received "generally favorable reviews", according to review aggregator [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MCPS4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCXBO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCPC"/&gt; The game was awarded the accolade for "Best Remaster" of 2016 from [[IGN]].&lt;ref name="IGNaward"&gt;{{cite web|title=Best of 2016 Awards|url=http://uk.ign.com/wikis/best-of-2016-awards/Best_Remaster|website=IGN|accessdate=March 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joey Thurmond of ''[[Push Square]]'' wrote how playing through the campaign from ''Modern Warfare'' reminded him of its sheer memorability and how it had long endured with fans compared with other games in the series, saying "there's tension and gravity shot through the experience, as if the world is on your shoulders to push past every enemy line with explosive bravado or exacting stealth." He praised the game's graphical enhancements, saying "''Modern Warfare Remastered'' looks and sounds like a fresh game on par with today's graphical and aural standards" and calling it a "ridiculously faithful remake", but wrote that the game still showed some slight signs of age, such as [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]] problems and pacing issues. In short, he commended Raven Software "for arguably delivering the most substantial, masterful remake we have ever experienced", and that "''Modern Warfare Remastered'' celebrates this legacy with updated visuals and sound that really go above and beyond the call of duty, sprucing up an old care package for a more modern age to near-perfection."&lt;ref name="pushsquarerev"&gt;{{cite web|title=Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered Review|url=http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/call_of_duty_modern_warfare_remastered|website=Push Square|accessdate=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kallie Plagge at [[IGN]] remarked how the remaster wasn't as revolutionary a game when compared with the original, and that certain aspects, such as the pacing and level design, felt notably dated. She praised the range of visual and technical improvements compared with other remasters, although criticized some minor shortcomings with regards to both graphical and design elements. Despite this, she complimented the gameplay as having held up remarkably well and which was more gratifying as a result of being unaltered, stating how it left her "feeling relatively weighed down, encumbered, and more desperate in the fray." She thought the game felt more classic rather than outdated, saying that "It might not have the same effect it did the first time around, but it works as both a great embodiment of what shooters used to be and one that still plays well."&lt;ref name="ignrev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-review|title=Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered Review|first=Kallie|last=Plagge|date=November 8, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Destructoid]]''{{'}}s Chris Carter was positive of all the changes made to the original that showcased Raven's efforts, but stated that the game was still at its core one from 2007. He cited the story as an example, saying that the game's campaign was still worth playing despite having been topped by its competition. Carter further noted that the cast were "nothing more than warm bodies at points", although opined that the crux of the story and the relationship between main protagonist Soap and Captain Price was "worth the price of admission". Alternatively, he found the multiplayer to be timeless, and that the design of each map held up well and felt justified. He compared the mode to those offered by other first-person shooter games, stating "There's a nice, comfortable balance between the two philosophies, to the point where it's not too alienating for folks who didn't grow up with twichy FPSes or feel like dedicating the time to learning the ins and outs of breaching and clearing each and every room, knocking on permadeath's door on every match."&lt;ref name="destructoidrev"&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered|url=https://www.destructoid.com/review-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-397048.phtml|website=Destructoid|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' complimented the visuals of the remaster, saying that "The game still doesn't look quite as good as the last couple of Call Of Duty's, but it's extremely close. And whatever else you say about it, on a presentational level this is an excellent remaster." The multiplayer they praised for being more pleasingly simple than recent ''Call of Duty'' games and pointed out how it was sure to bring considerable nostalgia to players of ''Modern Warfare'', but nonetheless criticized it for also feeling limited and shallow. They also noted that the remaster inadvertently felt clichéd and overfamiliar due to the original having inspired numerous imitations, although praised the modern-day setting as feeling surprisingly fresh again. Metro summarized their review by saying "One of the most influential video games of all time gets the remaster it deserves, and is still impressively entertaining after all these years."&lt;ref name="metrorev"&gt;{{cite web|title=Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered review – king COD|url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/11/08/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-review-king-cod-6243328/|website=Metro|accessdate=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kevin Dunsmore of ''[[Hardcore Gamer]]'' opined that the plot was much more grounded and realistic than other recent titles in the series, writing "You're not a super soldier stuck in the middle of out-of-this-world set piece, but rather a regular soldier working with a squad to complete objectives." He also complimented the multiplayer as feeling fresh, saying "After years of over-the-top killstreaks, wall-running, and other crazy antics, it's nice to get back to the basics". However, he stated that the decision to keep many of the design choices intact from ''Modern Warfare'' was both refreshing and a hindrance, such as infinitely-spawning enemies, infamous perks, and a lack of killstreak-countering, finding it "extremely outdated" that they hadn't been removed or fixed. Dunsmore heavily praised the visual enhancements on display, saying "''Modern Warfare Remastered'' is the most extensive visual upgrade any remaster has ever received yet, being more in line with a remake than an actual remaster", and concluded by writing "What Raven has accomplished is impressive, but it has its limits. A few tweaks would have gone a long way to fixing some balancing issues, but for those looking for a blast from the past, this works just fine".&lt;ref name="hardcorerev"&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered|url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2016/11/03/review-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered/234091/|website=Hardcore Gamer|accessdate=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Infinite Warfare'' bundling===
Before its standalone version was announced in June 2017, many criticized the decision that ''Modern Warfare Remastered'' would only be available through purchasing a premium version of ''Infinite Warfare''. Critics recognized that ''Remastered'' was more sought-after than ''Infinite Warfare'', due to the contrast in reception of both games, and saw bundling it as anti-consumerist and coercing those into paying more than necessary. Joey Thurmond disagreed with how a re-release of a classic that had shaped both the series' formula and first-person shooter genre in general had been coupled with a new, poorly-received title, calling the choice "preposterous" and "a bullet in the face to consumers". He argued that selling ''Remastered'' separately would actually benefit Activision, forecasting an eventual influx of pre-owned copies of the bundle being sold, devaluing ''Infinite Warfare''{{'}}s worth in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soapbox: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered's Infinite Warfare Exclusivity Is a Disaster|url=http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2016/05/soapbox_call_of_duty_modern_warfare_remastereds_infinite_warfare_exclusivity_is_a_disaster|website=Push Square|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Forbes''{{'}} Paul Tassi described the bundling as being "a way to essentially blackmail players into picking up a more expensive version of a base game they may not have even wanted (''Infinite Warfare'') in order to get something they desperately wanted (''Modern Warfare Remastered'')", but understood why Activision had made the choice as a result of it being "pro-money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It's Time For 'Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered' To Be Free From 'Infinite Warfare'|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2017/04/23/its-time-for-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-to-be-free-from-infinite-warfare/#93d20a47a17e|website=Forbes|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others found that the bundling of the games was a sensible business decision, highlighting the risk that the sales of ''Remastered'' could overshadow those of ''Infinite Warfare'' and result in direct competition between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Call of Duty: Modern Warfare remaster will not be sold separately|url=http://www.geek.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remaster-will-not-be-sold-separately-1653958/|website=Geek|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered Won’t Be Sold Separately|url=https://gamerant.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-not-sold-sperately/|website=Game Rant|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Wright of Gamespresso, meanwhile, agreed with Activision based around the impulsiveness of the ''Call of Duty'' fanbase, writing that many of those who felt discontent towards a new title would still choose to buy it regardless due to the series' popularity; Activision had capitalized on this by releasing the bundle with the knowledge that fans would certainly purchase ''Infinite Warfare'' in order to obtain a remaster of ''Modern Warfare''. While Wright did disagree with having to pay for an unwanted game in order to obtain another, he expressed faith that the bundle would be good value for money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LIKE IT OR NOT, ACTIVISION MADE THE RIGHT CALL BUNDLING MW REMASTERED|url=http://www.gamespresso.com/2016/10/activision-right-call-bundling-modern-warfare/|website=Gamespresso|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inclusion of microtransactions===
Controversy arose several weeks after the release of ''Remastered'' when Activision incorporated the use of microtransactions into the multiplayer, along with further new content, which had been absent from ''Modern Warfare''.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Yin-Poole |first1=Wesley |title=Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered now has supply drops |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-12-14-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-now-has-supply-drops |website=Eurogamer |accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of micropayments had first been raised some days after release when data miners uncovered hidden weapons within the game's files that indicated their future inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modern Warfare Remastered Datamine Uncovers Hidden Weapons|url=https://gamerant.com/modern-warfare-weapon-datamine/|website=GameRant|accessdate=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The choice resulted in a backlash from fans, many of whom accused Activision of defiling the memory of ''Modern Warfare'' and exploiting their feelings of nostalgia for profit. Some critics were concerned that Activision would release new items in supply drops that would provide players with [[Pay-to-win|gameplay advantages]], similar to their approach with other ''Call of Duty'' installments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Glagowski|first1=Peter|title=Looks like Modern Warfare Remastered is getting microtransactions|url=https://www.destructoid.com/looks-like-modern-warfare-remastered-is-getting-microtransactions-404884.phtml|website=Destructoid|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nowogurski|first1=Victor|title=Call of Duty Fans Infuriated by Modern Warfare Remastered Supply Drops|url=http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2016/12/call_of_duty_fans_infuriated_by_modern_warfare_remastered_supply_drops|website=Push Square|accessdate=March 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=COD Modern Warfare Remastered Supply Drops – Necessary Evil?|url=http://www.itechpost.com/articles/67007/20161220/cod-modern-warfare-remastered-supply-drops-necessary-evil.htm|website=iTech Post|accessdate=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connor Murphy at Beyond Entertainment wrote that it "comparatively blows open Pandora's Box as to what players may encounter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=COD: MODERN WARFARE REMASTERED UPDATE ADDS SUPPLY DROPS|url=http://teambeyond.net/cod-modern-warfare-remastered-update-adds-supply-drops/|website=Beyond Entertainment|accessdate=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaming journalist [[Jim Sterling]] was highly critical of the decision to include microtransactions in the remaster, and asserted that Activision were subsequently helping to set an example for other video game publishers to sell re-releases with new or omitted content at extra cost:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It's a rerelease of a nine-year-old game that quietly smuggled microtransactions into its online mode, and I can’t believe a concept so ludicrous is a real thing. That's something a parody of the industry would come up with. It's one thing to see the sad normalization of fee-to-pay elements within brand new releases, but to witness them shoveled retroactively into an old beloved title from an age before such trash gained traction? Activision has set the bar for “[[AAA (video game industry)|AAA]]” avarice – a new height for greed and a new low for the games business overall. [...] Most remasters are sold as complete, definitive editions of the original games, packing in all the downloadable content and [[Expansion pack|expansions]] that may have followed the initial launch. COD4 is paving the way for publishers to triple down – not just make money by selling an old game with updated visuals, but by tacking on DLC and microtransactions too. Should this pay off, I’ve little doubt that other publishers will attempt it themselves. [...] The rampant, unchecked greed on display is almost impressive in its audacity. To sneak freemium bullshit into a nine-year-old game that leveraged its own fandom to sell a completely different game is a masterstroke of sliminess, a monument to [[Bobby Kotick]]'s notorious lack of shame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bullshit Roundup: Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare Remastered Just Got Microtransactions|url=http://www.thejimquisition.com/the-bullshit-roundup-call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare-remastered-just-got-microtransactions/|website=The Jimquisition|accessdate=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Pricing of DLC and standalone game===
Following the announcement of the remastered Variety Map Pack in March 2017, Activision was condemned for deciding that the downloadable content would not be available for free. The most common complaints were that the publisher had already generated additional revenue for ''Remastered'' by bundling it with ''Infinite Warfare'' (increasing its cost to more than an individual game) and by including microtransactions; and that as a remaster, which often includes all previously-released DLC from the original, the map pack should have been released alongside ''Remastered'' at launch. Many also asserted that selling the DLC for a higher price than its original release was an unprincipled move.&lt;ref name="Forbes DLC"&gt;{{cite web|title=The 'Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered' Variety Map Pack Should Be Free|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2017/03/07/the-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-variety-map-pack-should-be-free/#168838322e2f|website=Forbes|accessdate=March 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered is getting premium DLC|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-03-08-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-is-getting-premium-dlc|website=Eurogamer|accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CoD: Modern Warfare Remastered DLC's ridiculously high price ticks off community|url=https://www.vg247.com/2017/04/24/cod-modern-warfare-remastered-dlcs-ridiculously-high-price-ticks-off-community/|website=VG247|accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sterling further slated Activision for charging for the DLC, stating that it was "incomprehensible" and that to increase its cost highlighted "just how far [Activision] can mock its customers and get away with it", labeling it as the latest scam to befall the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Activision Fucks Up Modern Warfare Remastered Further With DLC More Expensive Than It Used To Be|url=http://www.thejimquisition.com/activision-fucks-up-modern-warfare-remastered-further-with-dlc-more-expensive-than-it-used-to-be/|website=The Jimquisition|accessdate=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erik Kain of ''Forbes'' similarly argued that the DLC should have been available free of charge, maintaining his belief that charging for map packs "[was] a huge mistake".&lt;ref name="Forbes DLC"/&gt; However, in a follow-up article, he felt he could sympathize with Activision, writing that it was easier for them to set price points for early and late buyers. He also noted that the remaster was cheap in its contribution to the overall price for the bundle and so further costs for the DLC were justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sympathy For The Devil: Why $15 DLC Makes Sense For 'Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered'|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2017/04/23/sympathy-for-the-devil-why-15-dlc-makes-sense-for-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered/#4c3838399535|website=Forbes|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activision faced further criticism upon revealing that the Variety Map Pack would equally not be sold alongside the standalone version of ''Remastered''. Fans also argued that the standalone itself was overpriced, especially as both its cost and that of the DLC amounted to an almost full-price game; additionally, ''Eurogamer'' and ''GearNuke'' noted that the version bundled with ''Infinite Warfare'' was now selling at a similar price to the standalone version.&lt;ref name="EG"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Imtiaz|first1=Khurram|title=COD Modern Warfare Remastered Is Cheaper To Get With Infinite Warfare Than Standalone|url=http://gearnuke.com/cod-modern-warfare-remastered-cheaper-infinite-warfare/|website=GearNuke|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kain was understanding of the cost of the standalone, as selling it cheaply would have affronted those who had bought a premium version of ''Infinite Warfare'' for the remaster, but had been almost certain that the game would have included the DLC. Subsequently, he wrote that doing so would have been "a gesture of good will to the community" and "a smart move for the company".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered' Standalone Release Has One Big Problem|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2017/06/23/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-standalone-release-has-one-big-problem/#2b369b837804|website=Forbes.com|accessdate=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mic (media company)|Mic]]'s Jason Faulkner condemned Activision's previous business practices involving ''Remastered'' and considered the standalone version to be "a bad deal", criticizing that it was being sold for double that of its cost than when it was bundled with ''Infinite Warfare'', and found it "ridiculous" that with the DLC it amounted to almost full-price. As a result, he advised that fans should wait for the game to be reduced in price before buying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 'Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered' Xbox One, PS4 and PC standalone release is a bad deal|url=https://mic.com/articles/180774/the-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-xbox-one-ps4-and-pc-standalone-release-is-a-bad-deal#.RguE8e9Yb|website=Mic|accessdate=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan Devore of ''Destructoid'' expressed disinterest in buying the standalone from having to wait six months for its release, while also criticizing the cost, writing "I might've parted with that much money for it last year, but not now. It's too late."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Devore |first1=Jordan |title=Modern Warfare Remastered is standalone on PS4, but do you still care? |url=https://www.destructoid.com/modern-warfare-remastered-is-standalone-on-ps4-but-do-you-still-care--445427.phtml |website=Destructoid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Windows version===
The Windows version of ''Remastered'' was criticized for suffering from a number of technical issues in the multiplayer, with players also being dissatisfied with the game's available settings. On [[Steam (software)|Steam]], it received mostly negative user reviews, with complaints including poor performance, a locked 90 frames per second, insufficient mouse support, numerous [[Cheating in video games|hacker]]s, and a low player count. Many players felt that Activision had failed to provide adequate support for PC in favor of the game's console versions, a trait which had also been apparent with previous installments in the series. Consequently, some users suggested that the multiplayer of ''Modern Warfare'' would be a more suitable alternative, which still attracted a sizable amount of players and offered better options for performance, [[Mod (video gaming)|modding]] and customization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered is getting eviscerated on Steam|url=https://www.destructoid.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-is-getting-eviscerated-on-steam-451718.phtml|website=Destructoid|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered is having a tough time on Steam|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-07-28-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-is-having-a-tough-time-on-steam|website=Eurogamer|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Call of Duty Modern Warfare Remastered is Having Major Issues on Steam|url=https://segmentnext.com/2017/07/28/321947/|website=SegmentNext|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13032">The '''Center for Research, Evaluation and Awareness of Dyslexia''' ('''''Center for READing''''') is a university-based program at [[Pittsburg State University]], [[Pittsburg, Kansas]]. It was established in 1996 to:

* develop strategies for the prevention and remediation of reading disabilities
* search for strategies that will lead to the improvement of remedial processes
* provide educators and parents with current and appropriate knowledge regarding reading/learning disabilities
* provide interdisciplinary evaluations of readers of all ages
* promote the concerns relevant to reading disabilities
* educate the general public regarding issues pertaining to reading/learning disabilities

== Programs offered at the ''Center for READing'' ==
===Identification and Intervention Program===
The Identification and Intervention Program (IIP) is based on two decades worth of research and is the oldest of the programs offered at the ''CARRD''.  The purpose of the IIP is to identify children who are at-risk of developing a [[reading disability]], also referred to as [[dyslexia]], as soon as possible and then to provide those children with an appropriate remediation that will help them gain the fundamental skills needed to become competent readers. 

The IIP is used in school systems. It identifies students in the beginning of first grade who are at-risk of developing [[Reading (process)|reading]] difficulties and then provides them with a research-based reading tutoring program.

===After School and Summer Program===
The After School and Summer Program (ASSP) provides individuals with one-on-one remedial phonological and reading instruction. The ASSP serves individuals from four years of age through adult.

The first step of the ASSP is assessment. The individual is assessed in order to determine specific strengths and weaknesses in regards to basic phonological processing skills. Attentional abilities are also assessed in order to determine if attentional difficulties may be compounding the issue. Once the assessment is complete and the results are analyzed by the CARRD, a training program is constructed to aid the individual in improving deficient skills. The training program typically involves twice weekly tutoring sessions.

For school-aged children, utilizing the ASSP during the summer can be a great opportunity for the student to enhance phonological processing and reading skills during a time that students typically make minimal academic gains. 

One of the main goals of the ASSP is to help individuals gain [[phonological awareness]]. The program aims to close the gap between students who are weak in phonological processing and reading skills and those who are excellent readers. In addition to one-on-one tutoring through the ASSP, parents are encouraged to assist their children at home by practicing skill-building exercises together.

===On-line Reading Screening===
The '''Reading Screening''' is a web-based evaluation used to identify children between the ages of 5 and 12 years who are at-risk for developing or are currently experiencing reading difficulties. The [http://www.readingscreening.org Reading Screening] has been used in school systems for the past 15 years and is now available online to parents, teachers, and other professionals. With 15-20% of our nation's children experiencing reading problems or dyslexia, the best way to help is to begin to understand the nature of the individual’s reading difficulties. The '''Reading Screening''' provides understanding by identifying the child’s strengths and weaknesses with regard to reading. Once the  assessment has been completed, the website generates a ''Summary of Assessment'', which outlines the areas of reading that are creating the most difficulties for the child. The ''Summary of Assessment'' report can be shared with school personnel to plan an appropriate intervention, if intervention is necessary.

==Problem, Impact and Philosophy==
===Problem===
Estimates show that approximately 15 to 20% of our nation's children have reading difficulties. These children have the ability to learn to read, but have a specific skill deficit that prevents them from accomplishing this important task. Research indicates that most reading disabled children have a deficiency in phonological processing skills. The IIP was designed to identify and remediate this deficit before it handicaps the child's ability to learn to read.

===Impact===
The IIP is geared toward children who have the intellectual ability to learn to read, but find the process very difficult or impossible. Children with reading difficulties are at-risk for dropping out of school, parental abuse, poor self-esteem, and are more likely to find their way into the welfare and criminal justice systems. The future of a child with reading difficulties seems to be fairly bleak in our service-oriented society. To be successful in our society, one must not only know how to read, but also do it fairly well. 

The vast majority of children with [[learning disabilities]] have reading disabilities as their major deficiency. In fact, many children who are considered learning disabled because of other obstacles also have reading difficulties. In addition, as a member of our ever increasingly complex society, a society in which employment requires literacy, a student who does not graduate from high school, and who has poor reading skills, is likely to be doomed to extremely poor economic realities. 

The eventual cost to society for what might be a preventable difficulty is high. It is imperative that we begin using scientifically generated programs to remediate educational problems. Through the Center for READing, beginning first graders in the Pittsburg, Kansas area are assessed with the 'IIP' and are then provided with the intervention designed to eliminate the barriers that are preventing them from becoming good readers. The impact of the 'IIP' on improving the phonological processing skills of children at-risk for reading disabilities is far reaching. It may be possible to prevent thousands of children from ever experiencing learning and reading disabilities. Although the prevention of learning and reading disabilities is important in its own right, several social problems mentioned above may also be prevented in the process.

===Philosophy===
As mentioned above, individuals who use the ''ASSP'' are initially provided with an assessment. This assessment includes the ''Reading Screening'', an assessment of intelligence ([[IQ test]]), an attentional assessment (including both a parent check-list and the [[TOVA]] test), an auditory screening, and information concerning the individual's medical, developmental, and educational history. When assessing reading difficulties, it is ''imperative'' that the individual receive evaluation in not only reading skills, but also attentional abilities. An individual who is experiencing reading difficultis may be hampered by an attentional difficulty ([[Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder]]; ADHD). It is also true that an individual who displays behaviors consistent with ADHD might actually be experiencing reading difficulties.

As an example, a student learning to read must use considerable cognitive resources and effort to decode print. If that child has poor phonological processing skills and is deficient in decoding, their behavior might look like ADHD when they in fact have reading difficulties. On the other hand, a student with ADHD might not be able to use cognitive resources to decode print due to ADHD. As a result, their behavior might resemble reading difficulties when the true deficiency is ADHD. An individual being assessed at the ''CARRD'' is assessed on several dimensions to gain complete understanding of the individual's strengths and weaknesses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1619">The '''Chase Manhattan Bank Money Museum''' was a money museum at the Rockefeller Center, New York City from 1928 to 1977.

==The Collection==
The Museum was located at the [[Rockefeller Center]] on Sixth Avenue in Manhattan, New York City. The collection was acquired from [[Farran Zerbe]] in 1928, and contained legal tender in a variety of forms, including [[wampum]], ancient and modern coins, and paper money. The museum closed in 1977 and most of the collection (approx. 26,000 objects) was donated to the [[National Numismatic Collection]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] on 16 January 1978. Some of the collection went to the [[American Numismatic Society]], including an 1804 U.S. dollar.  An 1862 $1 Legal Tender note with Serial Number 1 (the first dollar bill issued by the United States) is now in the [[Chase Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://numismatics.org/authority/chase_manhattan_bank_money_museum|title=ARCHER - Authorities: Chase Manhattan Bank Money Museum (chase_manhattan_bank_money_museum)|website=numismatics.org}} Retrieved 7 Feb 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chullo''' ({{IPA-es|ˈtʃuʎo}}, from {{lang-ay|ch'ullu}}) is an [[Andes|Andean]] style of [[hat]] with earflaps, made from [[vicuña]], [[alpaca]], [[llama]] or [[sheep]]'s [[wool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Leslie| first = Catherine Amoroso| title = Needlework Through History: An Encyclopedia| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pLnWAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA101| year = 2007| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| isbn = 978-0-313-33548-8| page = 101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alpaca has wool-like qualities that help to insulate its wearer from the harsh elements in the [[Andes|Andean Mountain]] region. Chullos often have ear-flaps that can be tied under the chin, to further warm the wearer's head.

Chullos have been used in the [[Andes|Andean Mountain]] region by indigenous peoples for thousands of years. Wearing different types and colors has a significance among certain Andean natives{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}.

In the American TV show [[South Park]], the character [[List of students at South Park Elementary#Craig Tucker|Craig Tucker]] wears a blue chullo.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5667">'''Chypre''' ({{IPA-fr|ʃipʁ|pron}} &lt;small&gt;or&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA-fr|ʃipχ|}}) is the name of a family (or ''concept'') of [[perfume]]s that are characterised by an accord composed of [[citrus]] top[[note (perfumery)|note]]s, a middle centered on cistus [[labdanum]], and a mossy-animalic set of basenotes derived from [[oakmoss]]. Chypre perfumes fall into numerous classes according to their modifier notes, which include but are not limited to leather, florals, fruits, and [[amber]].&lt;ref&gt;"Chypre" Microsoft Encarta Dictionary, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Cyprus by Piri Reis.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Chypre'' is [[French language|French]] for [[Cyprus]]]]
The term ''chypre'' is [[French language|French]] for the island of [[Cyprus]]. Its connection to perfumery originated with the first composition to feature the bergamot-labdanum-oakmoss accord, [[François Coty]]'s 1917 perfume ''Chypre'' (now preserved at the [[Osmothèque]]), whose name was inspired by the fact that its raw materials came predominantly from Mediterranean countries.&lt;ref&gt;Turin, Luca, and Tania Sanchez. The Little Book of Perfumes: The 100 Classics. London: Profile, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Although perfumes in a similar style had already been created in the 19th century, ''Chypre'' was so influential that it inspired many descendants, becoming the progenitor of a whole family of related fragrances sharing the same basic accord, which came to be known as chypres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museesdegrasse.com/mip/fla_ang/histo_gXIX.shtml#chypre Musées de Grasse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810105829/http://www.museesdegrasse.com/MIP/fla_ang/histo_gXIX.shtml |date=2007-08-10 }}, the International Perfume Museum&lt;/ref&gt; The chypre concept is characterised by the contrast between the fresh citrus accord and the woody-[[Oak moss|oakmoss]] base; often [[patchouli]] is considered an indispensable element as well.&lt;ref&gt;H&amp;R Fragrance Guide/Duftatlas/Atlas Olfactif, Quensen &amp; Oudras Verlag, Lamspringe, 2000, p. 14, {{ISBN|3-922805-69-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chypre accord is used in both male and female perfumery.

==In popular culture==
A notable literary reference to chypre is contained in the novel ''[[The Maltese Falcon (novel)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' by [[Dashiell Hammett]] (Knopf, 1929), in which the character Joel Cairo is described as carrying a chypre-scented handkerchief as part of his homosexual persona. Raymond Chandler's ''[[The Lady in the Lake]]'' (Knopf, 1943) also mentions a chypre-scented, monogrammed handkerchief. [[Brave New World]] written by [[Aldous Huxley]] in 1932, the main female character, Lenina Crowne, “dabbled herself with chypre” after drying off from a bath.

==Notable examples==
One of the most popular chypre perfumes was the original Miss Dior, a floral chypre launched by Christian Dior in 1947. The formula was later changed, likely due to issues with the ingredient oakmoss.  Since the mid-1980s, [[Karl Lagerfeld]] cologne, orange in color, called "Lagerfeld" is a modern chypre scent for both men and women.

In the 1950s and 60s in the USSR, "ШИПР" Shipr, became a popular men's fragrance. Today ШИПР is still available in Russian cosmetic stores and it is a popular scent among women.

==Style==
Modern chypre perfumes have various connotations such as floral, fruity, green, woody-aromatic, leathery, and animalic notes, but can easily be recognized by their "warm" and "mossy-woody" base which contrasts the fresh citrus top, and a certain bitterness in the dry-down from the oak moss and patchouli. The accord consists of:
*''Citrus'': singular or blends of [[bergamot orange|Bergamot]], [[Orange (fruit)|Orange]], [[Lemon]] or [[Neroli]]
*''[[Oakmoss]]'': mossy and woody
*''[[Patchouli]]'': camphoraceous and woody
*''[[Musk]]'': sweet, powdery, and animalic. Usually [[Synthetic musk|synthetic]] in modern times.

The composition is usually enhanced with a floral component through [[rose]] and [[jasmine]] oil.

Animalic notes such as [[civet]] can be added to this accord to provide richness, but are less popular in modern [[perfumery]]. The most common modifiers to this basic accord include [[patchouli]], [[bergamot orange|bergamot]], [[vetiver]], [[ambergris]], [[sandalwood]] and [[Rock rose|labdanum]] resin.&lt;ref&gt;Definition of the chypre family from [http://www.museesdegrasse.com/mip/fla_ang/crea_classif.shtml#chypre Musées de Grasse]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sub-families of chypre==
The chypre fragrances generally fit into the Oriental and Woody family of [[fragrance wheel]] classification. They can also be classified into several styles:
*Leather and/or animalic chypres, such as ''Bandit'' by [[Robert Piguet]] (1944), ''[[Cabochard]]'' by [[Grès]] (1959), and ''[[Azurée]]'' (1969) by [[Estée Lauder Companies|Estée Lauder]].
*Floral chypres, such as ''Knowing'' by [[Estée Lauder Companies|Estée Lauder]], 1988.
*Fruity chypres, such as ''Femme'' by [[Rochas]], 1944, ''[[Mitsouko]]'' by [[Guerlain]], 1917, and ''Y'' by [[Yves Saint-Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]], 1964.
*Green chypres, such as ''Givenchy III'' by [[Givenchy]] (1970), ''Aliage'' by [[Estée Lauder Companies|Estée Lauder]], 1972 and ''Cuvée Spéciale'' by [[Charvet Place Vendôme|Charvet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charvet Cuvee Speciale |work=basenotes|url=http://www.basenotes.net/threads/262131-Charvet-Cuvee-Speciale|accessdate=December 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Woody-aromatic chypres, such as ''Aromatics Elixir'' by [[Clinique]], 1972.
*Fresh-citric chypres, such as ''[[CK One]]'' by [[Calvin Klein]], 1994.

'''Comecrudan''' refers to a group of possibly related languages spoken in the southernmost part of [[Texas]] and in northern [[Mexico]] along the [[Rio Grande]]. ''Comecrudo'' is the best known.

Very little is known about these languages or the people who spoke them. Knowledge of them primarily consists of word lists collected by [[European ethnic groups|European]] [[missionaries]] and explorers. 

All Comecrudan languages are [[Extinct language|extinct]].

==Family division==

The three languages were:
# '''[[Comecrudo language|Comecrudo]]''' (also known as Mulato or Carrizo) ''(†)''
# '''[[Garza language|Garza]]''' ''(†)''
# '''[[Mamulique language|Mamulique]]''' (also known as Carrizo de Mamulique) ''(†)''

==Genetic relationships==

In [[John Wesley Powell]]'s 1891 classification of [[North American languages]], Comecrudo was grouped together with the [[Cotoname language|Cotoname]] and [[Coahuilteco language|Coahuilteco]] languages into a family called [[Coahuiltecan]]. 

[[John R. Swanton]] (1915) grouped together the Comecrudo, Cotoname, Coahuilteco, [[Karankawa language|Karankawa]], [[Tonkawa language|Tonkawa]], [[Atakapa language|Atakapa]], and [[Maratino language|Maratino]] languages into a Coahuiltecan grouping. 

[[Edward Sapir]] (1920) accepted Swanton's proposal and grouped this hypothetical Coahuiltecan into his [[Hokan languages|Hokan]] stock.

After these proposals, documentation of the Garza and Mamulique languages was brought to light. It is now thought that the Comecrudan languages are not part of any of the proposed larger groupings mentioned above. Goddard (1979) believes that there is sufficient similarity between Comecrudan, Garza, and Mamulique for them to be considered genetically related.

[[Image:Korkenzieher 01 KMJ.jpg|thumb|A basic corkscrew]]

A '''corkscrew''' is a tool for drawing [[Cork (plug)|corks]] from [[wine bottle]]s, beer bottles and other household bottles before the invention of [[screw cap]]s and [[Crown cork]]s.  In its traditional form, a corkscrew simply consists of a pointed metallic [[helix]] (often called the "worm") attached to a handle, which the user screws into the cork and pulls to extract it. Corkscrews are necessary because corks themselves, being small and smooth, are difficult to grip and remove, particularly when inserted fully into an inflexible glass bottle. More recent styles of corkscrew incorporate various systems of [[lever]]s that further increase the amount of [[force]] that can be applied outwards upon the cork, making easier the extraction of difficult corks.

==History==
Its design may have derived from the gun worm which was a device used by men to remove unspent charges from a [[musket]]'s barrel in a similar fashion, from at least the early 1630s.&lt;ref name="OCW-corkscrew"&gt;winepros.com.au. {{Cite web|last= ''The Oxford Companion to Wine''| title= corkscrew |url= http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=827 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The corkscrew is possibly an English invention, due to the tradition of beer and cider, and ''Treatise on Cider'' by [[John Worlidge]] in 1676 describes "binning of tightly corked cider bottles on their sides", although the earliest reference to a corkscrew is, "steel worm used for the drawing of Corks out of Bottles" from 1681.&lt;ref name="OCW-corkscrew"/&gt;

In 1795, the first corkscrew patent was granted to the Reverend Samuell Henshall, in England. The clergyman affixed a simple disk, now known as the Henshall Button, between the worm and the shank. The disk prevents the worm from going too deep into the cork, forces the cork to turn with the turning of the crosspiece, and thus breaks the adhesion between the cork and the neck of the bottle. The disk is designed and manufactured slightly concave on the underside, which compresses the top of the cork and helps keep it from breaking apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Direct Pull; The Henshall Button | publisher=Corkscrew.com | url=http://www.corkscrew.com/henshall.html | accessdate=2007-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who collects corkscrews is a ''helixophile.''&lt;ref&gt;''Quarterly Worme'' (2000 to present), newsletter of the Canadian Corkscrew Collectors Club, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corkscrewnet.com/ CorkscrewNet]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Basic===
In its traditional form, a corkscrew is simply a steel screw attached to a perpendicular handle, made of wood or some other material. The user grips the handle and screws the metal point into the [[cork (material)|cork]], until the helix is firmly embedded, then a vertical pull on the corkscrew extracts the cork from the bottle. The handle of the corkscrew allows for a commanding grip to ease removal of the cork.

=== Winged corkscrew ===
[[Image:Corkscrew P1150886.jpg|thumb|A wing corkscrew]]
First invented in 1930&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=CA&amp;NR=306030A&amp;KC=A&amp;FT=D&amp;ND=4&amp;date=19301125&amp;DB=EPODOC&amp;locale=en_EP|title=Espacenet – Original document|website=worldwide.espacenet.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the Italian [[Domenick Rosati|Domenick Rosati]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/magazine/who-made-that-corkscrew.html|title=Who Made That Corkscrew?|access-date=2018-09-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; who emigrated to Chicago, Illinois to work as bartender before the prohibition. Such design was adapted by other brands as wine-market grown in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jikDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=popular+science+1930&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=zL7ZTpqAGori0QHb8dnoDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBjhG#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Corkscrew Put Leverage on Stubborn Stoppers."] ''Popular Science'', May 1939, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

The winged owl version was first manufactured in 1932 by the Spanish industrial designer David Olañeta for his brand BOJ&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://elpais.com/elpais/2017/12/26/album/1514290567_389706.html|title=Fotos: 13 objetos inventados por españoles que tienes en casa y no sabes que son obras maestras|last=Primo|first=Carlos|date=2018-01-04|work=El País|access-date=2018-05-09|language=es|issn=1134-6582}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and later adapted by other brands).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jikDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=popular+science+1930&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=zL7ZTpqAGori0QHb8dnoDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBjhG#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Corkscrew Put Leverage on Stubborn Stoppers."] ''Popular Science'', May 1939, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

The wing corkscrew, sometimes called cork-extactor, a butterfly corkscrew, owl corkscrew or angel corkscrew, has two levers, one on either side of the worm.  As the worm is twisted into the cork, the levers are raised.  Pushing down the levers draws the cork from the bottle in one smooth motion.  The most common design has a [[rack and pinion]] connecting the levers to the body.  The head of the central shaft is frequently modified to form a [[bottle opener]], increasing the utility of the device.  Corkscrews of this design are particularly popular in household use.

=== Sommelier knife ===
[[Image:Sommelier Knife2.jpg|thumb|A sommelier knife]]
A '''[[sommelier]] knife''', '''waiter's friend''' or '''wine key''' is a corkscrew in a folding body similar to a [[pocket knife]]. It was conceived by the German Karl Wienke in 1882 and patented in Germany, England, and America.&lt;ref name="OCW-corkscrew"/&gt;

An arm extends to brace against the lip of the bottle for leverage when removing the cork.  Some sommelier knives have two steps on the lever, and often also a [[bottle opener]]. A small hinged knife blade is housed in the handle end to be used in cutting the foil wrapping the neck of many wine bottles. A corkscrew of this type can be used more quickly (and with more "show" or panache) than a wing-type corkscrew. 

The term "wine key" came into existence due to the German inventor's last name, Wienke, which is difficult for English speakers to pronounce. When ordering the product from catalogs, the meaning and origins of the new Wienke Corkscrew gradually became lost and it was simply referred to as a "Winekey" or wine key. Patent number 283,731, August 21, 1883, simply refers to it as "C.F.A. WIENKE LEVER CORKSCREW."

=== Twin-prong cork puller ===
[[Image:Laschen-Korkenzieher.jpg|thumb|right|A twin prong cork puller]]
Also known as '''butler's friend''' or "Ah-So", the twin-prong cork puller can extract a stopper without damaging it, to allow for sampling the wine before re-inserting the stopper. The stopper is removed by pushing the prongs between the cork and the neck of the bottle, and twisting the stopper out of the bottle. Replacing the stopper involves taking it between the two prongs, then twisting it into the bottle and pulling out the prongs. It can also extract a stopper in bad condition.
{{clear}}
===Lever corkscrew ===
[[File:Korkenzieher BMK.jpg|thumb|A lever corkscrew]]
The lever or "rabbit" corkscrew is operated using a pair of handles which are used to grip the neck of the bottle, and a lever which is simply pressed down to twist the screw into the cork, then lifted to extract the cork. Expelling the cork from the device is done with a similar press/lift action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnL3BTNYIgo|title=How to Use a Rabbit Corkscrew (Lever Style)|author=Youtube user "Wine Enthusiast"|publisher=Youtube|date=2009-01-20|accessdate=2015-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style of corkscrew is much bulkier, and typically much more expensive, than other styles, but is much faster. [[File:Tischkorkenzieher.jpg|thumb|right|A table-mounted corkscrew]]

===Mounted corkscrew===
{{main|Mounted corkscrew}}
These were invented in the late 1800s for use in homes, hotel bars and restaurants in an era where all bottles were stopped with corks. They are screwed or clamped to counters or walls.  When beer began to be sold in bottles, bars required a speedy way to open them.  Most early mounted corkscrew were designed to open beer bottles with short corks.  Modern ones are made for longer wine corks.&lt;ref&gt;Meadows, Wayne. ''Compendium of Bar Corkscrews'', Vancouver, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}
===Others===
There are many other styles of corkscrew which are not widely used in consumer settings, such as high-priced elaborate devices for specialists, and for industrial uses.

'''DAKS''' is a British luxury [[fashion house]], founded in 1894 by Simeon Simpson in London.

DAKS holds [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|royal warrants]] granted from three members of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]], one of 15 firms (out of 820) to do so. Officially granted to DAKS' Simpson Piccadilly store in 1956 was the royal warrant of [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|HRH The Duke of Edinburgh]], followed by that of HM [[Elizabeth II|The Queen]] in 1962 and HRH [[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince of Wales]] in 1982.

Worldwide, DAKS is exported to 30 countries and sold in over 2,000 specialty shops, major stores and concessions. The name is a combination of the initials of '''A'''lexander '''S'''impson and an initial and final letter of his business associate '''D'''udley Bec'''k'''.

==History==

===Early years – S Simpson===

In 1894 Simeon Simpson, aged 16, rented a room on Middlesex Street, [[East London]], with the intention of setting up a business in [[bespoke tailoring]], focused on high standard craftsmanship.&lt;ref name="daks_a"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.daks.com/products/tailoring/the-story.aspx|title = The Story|date = December 2012|accessdate = 27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several innovations of technology at the time were being introduced with [[machinery]] capable of making buttonholes and electric powered saws to cut many layers of fabric at once – Simpson saw the potential for such equipment for producing garments in higher quantities while still upholding quality tailoring techniques, aiming to improve [[ready-to-wear]] standards as no male or female professionals considered ready-to-wear for suitable attire at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Wainwright |first= David |authorlink=  |title= The British Tradition: Simpson – A World of Style |url= |year=1996 |publisher=Quiller Press Ltd |location=London |isbn= 1-899163-158 |page=2 |pages=}}&lt;!--| accessdate=27 December 2012 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Simpson's methods proved successful in speeding up the process and he set up several factories within London, which soon required expansion in its early years through popularity of the label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Wainwright |first= David |authorlink=  |title= The British Tradition: Simpson – A World of Style |url= |year=1996 |publisher=Quiller Press Ltd |location=London |isbn= 1-899163-158 |page=|pages=1–2}}&lt;!--| accessdate=27 December 2012 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander Simpson, his second son, joined the business aged 15 in 1917, and by 1929 had planned and opened a larger factory in Stoke Newington where production could be centralised, this again had to be enlarged a few years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Wainwright |first= David |authorlink=  |title= The British Tradition: Simpson – A World of Style |url= |year=1996 |publisher=Quiller Press Ltd |location=London |isbn= 1-899163-158 |page=3 |pages=}}&lt;!--| accessdate=27 December 2012 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century – DAKS and Simpsons Piccadilly===

With the continued growth of the company Alexander Simpson began to take more control of the business, and in 1935 DAKS gained further fame for the S Simpson brand as an innovation in the tailoring world of the first self-supporting trouser.&lt;ref name="daks"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.daks.com/daks/about-us.aspx|title = About Us|date = December 2012|accessdate = 27 December 2012|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130518024600/http://www.daks.com/daks/about-us.aspx|archivedate = 18 May 2013|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He went about to invent a way to support his trousers that wouldn't need braces as these interrupted his swing whilst playing [[golf]] and caused his shirt to become untucked.&lt;ref name="WainwrightDavid"&gt;{{cite book |last= Wainwright |first= David |authorlink=  |title= The British Tradition: Simpson – A World of Style |url= |year=1996 |publisher=Quiller Press Ltd |location=London |isbn= 1-899163-158 |page=4 |pages=}}&lt;!--| accessdate=2012-12-27 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The DAKS trouser was invented – it had a channel within the waistband at the back wherein an elasticated strip was attached at the sides with tabs attached to one of two buttons for adjustment. On the inside of the waistband were sewn-on rubber pads that gripped the shirt and stopped it from becoming loose. This happened in a world where to buy a pair of trousers of high quality one would have to have a [[bespoke]] pair made by a [[tailor]], and thus this new design allowed the ease of [[ready-to-wear]] trousers.&lt;ref name="WainwrightDavid" /&gt; Simpson was so sure of his new design that he had 100,000 pairs made before being introduced to the public at a high price of 30 [[shillings]] in a time when a whole [[bespoke]] suit would cost 50 shillings.&lt;ref name="WainwrightDavid" /&gt; The trousers were available in many colours and fabrics that weren't generally associated with menswear. They became so popular that the trousers were incorporated into [[Suit (clothing)|suit]]s and soon after a DAKS womenswear line was released, using the patented waistband for skirting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Wainwright |first= David |authorlink=  |title= The British Tradition: Simpson – A World of Style |url= |year=1996 |publisher=Quiller Press Ltd |location=London |isbn= 1-899163-158 |page=52 |pages=}}&lt;!--| accessdate=27 December 2012 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The inception of the DAKS name was aiming to be something short, snappy and eye catching and is an arrangement of initials from the two men involved in its development – 'AS' for Alexander Simpson and 'DK' for his business associate Dudley Beck&lt;ref name="WainwrightDavid" /&gt; (his surname's last letter was used so as to make a better-sounding name than using a B&lt;ref name="WainwrightDavid" /&gt;) hence why the name is capitalised. The advertising agent involved for the promotion of these new trousers, Sir William Crawford of [[Crawford's Advertising Agency|WS Crawford Ltd]] thought up the idea to market them as 'Dad's Slacks' as it had connotations of reliability and comfort whilst also sounding similar to the name DAKS.&lt;ref name="WainwrightDavid" /&gt;

At the turn of the 21st century when the company was acquired by Japanese group Sankyo Seiko Co. Limited in 1991, the S Simpson name was dropped and DAKS became the new brand name.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/brands/daks/&lt;/ref&gt;

The ease-of-wear of the trousers and how they allowed movement, as intended from Simpson's invention, led to DAKS being popular in sporting wear – kitting tennis, golf, motor racing, and football players, and even for the British Olympic team in 1960.&lt;ref name="daks_a" /&gt; The quality of S Simpson tailoring was such that the company was commissioned by the British Government at the time of the [[Second World War]] to produce military [[uniform]]s for officers in the Army, Navy, Royal Airforce and Women's Services&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daks.com/products/tailoring/the-story.aspx |title=The Story |publisher=Daks.com |accessdate=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; even despite the semi-destruction of the Stoke Newington factory due to bomb damage and loss of electricity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Wainwright |first= David |authorlink=  |title= The British Tradition: Simpson – A World of Style |url= |year=1996 |publisher=Quiller Press Ltd |location=London |isbn= 1-899163-158 |page=54 |pages=}}&lt;!--| accessdate=27 December 2012 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
– with about seven million garments made for military services being produced.&lt;ref name="Wainwright 1996 58"&gt;{{cite book |last= Wainwright |first= David |authorlink= |title= The British Tradition: Simpson – A World of Style |url= |year=1996 |publisher=Quiller Press Ltd |location=London |isbn= 1-899163-158 |page=58 |pages=}}&lt;!--| accessdate=27 December 2012 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war when DAKS clothes were announced to start selling to the public again queues of people would form down Piccadilly, to which Simpson tailors would measure them in line and present suitable pairs of trousers to them when they got into the [[Simpsons of Piccadilly]] store.&lt;ref name="Wainwright 1996 58"/&gt;

Simeon Simpson's son Alexander Simpson, who was then owner of the company, decided he wanted to find a 'window' for Simpson clothes in the heart of London.&lt;ref name="WainwrightDavid_a"&gt;{{cite book |last= Wainwright |first= David |authorlink= |title= The British Tradition: Simpson – A World of Style |url= |year=1996 |publisher=Quiller Press Ltd |location=London |isbn= 1-899163-158 |page=7 |pages=}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 December 2012 --&gt; Retrieved 2012-12-27&lt;/ref&gt; He founded [[Simpsons of Piccadilly]] when the Geological Museum had closed and the site to be auctioned.&lt;ref name="WainwrightDavid_a" /&gt; The new building was designed by architect [[Joseph Emberton]] as a new and revolutionary retail establishment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Wainwright |first= David |authorlink=  |title= The British Tradition: Simpson – A World of Style |url= |year=1996 |publisher=Quiller Press Ltd |location=London |isbn= 1-899163-158 |page=8 |pages=}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 December 2012 --&gt; Retrieved 2012-12-27&lt;/ref&gt; the shop front windows exhibited the first curved glass display in Great Britain and the largest in the world at the time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Wainwright |first= David |authorlink=  |title= The British Tradition: Simpson – A World of Style |url= |year=1996 |publisher=Quiller Press Ltd |location=London |isbn= 1-899163-158 |page=17 |pages=}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 December 2012 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; these were designed so that no reflection would be cast to obscure the displays inside. The outstanding feature of the shop's interior was the [[travertine]] staircase that ran up through the centre of the store lit by a continuous window up the height of the building. The current lighting structure suspended through the staircase centre is the original from the 1930s as the building has since become a [[listed building]].

==Advertising==

Simpsons' and DAKS' advertising was quite profound,&lt;ref name="daks_a" /&gt; featured in colour and in magazines such as [[Punch (magazine)|Punch]] and throughout the store,&lt;ref name="daks_a" /&gt; characteristic and witty they included illustrations by [[Max Hoff (illustrator)|Max Hoff]] who was persuaded by Alexander Simpson and Sir William Crawford to move to Britain from Austria during the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Wainwright |first= David |authorlink= |title= The British Tradition: Simpson – A World of Style |url= |year=1996 |publisher=Quiller Press Ltd |location=London |isbn= 1-899163-158 |page=34 |pages=}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 December 2012 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He stayed with the company from 1936 to coincide with the Simpsons of Piccadilly launch, until the late 1960s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10874">'''Educational essentialism''' is an [[educational philosophy]] whose adherents [[belief|believe]] that children should learn the traditional basic subjects thoroughly. In this philosophical school of thought, the aim is to instill students with the "essentials" of academic knowledge, enacting a back-to-basics approach. Essentialism ensures that the accumulated wisdom of our civilization as taught in the traditional academic disciplines is passed on from teacher to student. Such disciplines might include [[Reading (process)|Reading]], [[Writing]], [[Literature]], [[Foreign language|Foreign Languages]], [[History]], [[Mathematics]], [[Science]], [[Art]], and [[Music]]. Moreover, this traditional approach is meant to train the mind, promote reasoning, and ensure a common culture.

==Principles of essentialism==

Essentialism is a relatively [[Conservatism|conservative]] stance to education that strives to teach students the knowledge of a society and civilization through a core curriculum. This core curriculum involves such areas that include the study of the surrounding environment, basic [[natural law]]s, and the disciplines that promote a happier, more educated living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howick|first=William H.|title=Philosophies of Western Education|year=1971|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other non-traditional areas are also integrated as well in moderation to balance the education. Essentialists' goals are to instill students with the "essentials" of [[Outline of academic disciplines|academic knowledge]], [[patriotism]], and [[Moral character|character development]] through traditional (or back-to-basic) approaches. This is to promote reasoning, train the mind, and ensure a common culture for all citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sadker|first=David Miller|title=Teacher-Centered Philosophies|url=http://www.education.com/reference/article/Ref_Teacher_Centered|work=Teachers, Schools, and Society: A Brief Introduction to Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentialism is the most typically enacted philosophy in [[United States|American]] classrooms today. Traces of this can be found in the organized learning centered on [[teacher]]s and [[textbook]]s, in addition to the regular assignments and evaluations.

===Essentialism as a teacher-centered philosophy===

The role of the teacher as the leader of the classroom is a very important tenet of Educational essentialism. The teacher is the center of the [[classroom]], so they should be rigid and disciplinary. Establishing order in the classroom is crucial for student learning; effective teaching cannot take place in a loud and disorganized environment. It is the teacher's responsibility to keep order in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Essentialism In Education|url=http://www.excite.com/education/education/essentialism-in-education|work=Excite Education|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The teacher must interpret essentials of the learning process, take the [[leadership]] position and set the [[Tone (literature)|tone]] of the classroom. These needs require an educator who is academically well-qualified with an appreciation for learning and development. The teacher must control the students with distributions of rewards and penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howick|first=William H|title=Philosophies of Western Education|year=1971|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of essentialism==
The Essentialist movement first began in the [[United States]] in the year 1938. In [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]], a group met for the first time called "The Essentialist's Committee for the Advancement of Education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howick|first=William H|title=Philosophies of Western Education|year=1971|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their emphasis was to reform the educational system to a [[rationality]]-based system.

The term essentialist first appeared in the book ''An Introduction to the Philosophy of Education'' which was written by Michael John Demiashkevich.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Null|first=James Wesley|date=2007|title=William C. Bagley and the Founding of Essentialism: An Untold Story in American Educational History|url=http://www.tcrecord.org/library/abstract.asp?contentid=12868|journal=Teachers College Record|volume=109|issue=4|pages=1013–1055|doi=|pmid=|access-date=June 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, Demiashkevich labels some specific educators (including [[William Bagley (educator)|William C. Bagley]]) as “essentialists." Demiashkevich compared the essentialists to the different viewpoints of the [[Progressive Education Association]]. He described how the Progressives preached a “hedonistic doctrine of change” whereas the essentialists stressed the moral responsibility of man for his actions and looked toward permanent principles of behavior (Demiashkevich likened the arguments to those between the Socratics and the Sophists in Greek philosophy).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1938 Bagley and other educators met together where Bagley gave a speech detailing the main points of the essentialism movement and attacking the [[Public Education|public education]] in the United States. One point that Bagley noted was that students in the U.S. were not getting an education on the same levels as students in [[Europe]] who were the same age.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A recent branch has emerged within the essentialist school of thought called "neoessentialism." Emerging in the eighties as a response to the essentialist ideals of the thirties as well as to the criticism of the fifties and the advocates for education in the seventies, neoessentialism was created to try to appease the problems facing the United States at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ornstein|first=Allan|title=Foundations of Education|year=1993|page=465}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable change within this school of thought is that it called for the creation of a new discipline, computer science.

===Renowned essentialists===

[[William Bagley (educator)|William Bagley]] (1874–1946) was an important historical essentialist. William C. Bagley completed his undergraduate degree at Michigan Agricultural College in 1895. It wasn’t until after finishing his undergraduate studies that he truly wanted to be a teacher.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Bagley did his Graduate studies at the University of Chicago and at Cornell University. He acquired his Ph.D. in 1900, after which he took his first school job as a [[School Principal|Principal]] in a [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] [[Primary school|Elementary School]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Bagley’s devotion increased during his work at Montana State Normal School in Dillon, Montana. It was here where he decided to dedicate his time to the education of teachers and where he published ''[[The Educative Process]]'', launching his name across the nation. Throughout his career Bagley argued against the conservative position that teachers were not in need of special training for their work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He believed that [[Liberal arts education|liberal arts]] material was important in teacher education. Bagley also believed the dominant theories of education of the time were weak and lacking.

In April 1938, he published the ''Essentialist's Platform'', in which he outlined three major points of essentialism. He described the right of students to a well-educated and culturally knowledgeable teacher. Secondly, he discussed the importance of teaching the ideals of community to each group of students. Lastly, Bagley wrote of the importance of accuracy, thoroughness and effort on the part of the student in the classroom.

Another important essentialist is [[E. D. Hirsch]] (1928-). Hirsch was Founder and Chairman of the [[Core Knowledge Foundation]] and authored several books concerning fact-based approaches to education. Now retired, he spent many years teaching at the University of Virginia while also being an advocate for the "back to basics" movement. In his most popular book, ''Cultural Literacy — What Every American Needs To Know'', he offers lists, quotations, and information regarding what he believes is essential knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=School: The Story of American Public Education|work=PBS|publisher=Roundtable, Inc|url=https://www.pbs.org/kcet/publicschool/innovators/hirsch.html|year=2001|accessdate=April 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools enacting an essentialist curriculum==
The [[Core Knowledge Foundation|Core Knowledge Schools]] were founded on the philosophy of essentialist [[E.D. Hirsch]]. Although it is difficult to maintain a pure and strict essentialist-only [[curriculum]], these schools have the central aim of establishing a common knowledge base for all citizens. To do so, they follow a nationwide, content-specific, and teacher-centered curriculum. The Core Knowledge curriculum also allows for local variance above and beyond the core curriculum. Central curricular aims are academic excellence and the learning of knowledge, and teachers who are masters of their knowledge areas serve this aim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Criticism of essentialism==

Because Essentialism is largely teacher-centered, the role of the [[student]] is often called into question. Presumably, in an essentialist classroom, the teacher is the one designing the curriculum for the students based upon the core disciplines. Moreover, he or she is enacting the curriculum and setting the standards which the students must meet. The teacher's evaluative role may undermine students' interest in study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113 | title = Natural Learning in Higher Education| author = J. Scott Armstrong | journal = Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning | year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the students begin to take on more of a passive role in their education as they are forced to meet and learn such standards and information.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophies of Western Education|last=Howick|first=William H.|year=1971|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, there is also speculation that an essentialist education helps in promoting the [[cultural lag]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This philosophy of education is very traditional in the mindset of passing on the knowledge of the culture via the academic disciplines. Thus, students are forced to think in the mindset of the larger [[culture]], and individual [[creativity]] and subversive investigation are often not emphasized, or even outright discouraged.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4720">'''Eroom's law''' is the observation that drug discovery is becoming slower and more expensive over time, despite improvements in technology (such as [[high throughput screening]], [[biotechnology]], [[combinatorial chemistry]], and computational [[drug design]]), a trend first observed in the 1980s. The cost of developing a new drug roughly doubles every nine years (inflation-adjusted).&lt;ref name="MyUser_Pipeline.corante.com_October_3_2015c"&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Lowe D | url = http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2012/03/08/erooms_law | title = Eroom’s Law | format = | work = In the Pipeline | date = 8 March 2012 | accessdate = 16 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to highlight the contrast with the exponential advancements of other forms of technology (such as [[transistors]]) over time, the law was deliberately spelled as [[Moore's law]] spelled backwards.

The law is attributed to four main causes.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Nature.com_October_16_2015c"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Scannell JW, Blanckley A, Boldon H, Warrington B | title = Diagnosing the decline in pharmaceutical R&amp;D efficiency | journal = Nature Reviews. Drug Discovery | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 191–200 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22378269 | doi = 10.1038/nrd3681 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''the 'better than the Beatles' problem''': the sense that new drugs only have modest incremental benefit over drugs already widely considered as successful, such as [[Lipitor]], and treatment effects on top of already effective treatments are smaller than treatment effects versus placebo. The smaller size of these treatment effects mandates an increase in clinical trial sizes to show the same level of efficacy. This problem was phrased as "better than the Beatles" to highlight the fact that it would be difficult to come up with new successful pop songs if all new songs had to be better than [[the Beatles]]. 
* '''the 'cautious regulator' problem''': the progressive lowering of risk tolerance seen by drug regulatory agencies that makes [[R&amp;D]] both costlier and harder. After older drugs (such as [[Thalidomide]] or [[Vioxx]]) are removed from the market due to safety reasons, the bar on safety for new drugs is increased.
* '''the 'throw money at it' tendency''': the tendency to add human resources and other resources to R&amp;D, which may lead to project overrun.
* '''the 'basic research–brute force' bias''': the tendency to overestimate the ability of advances in basic research and brute force screening methods to show a molecule as safe and effective in clinical trials. From the 1960s to the 1990s (and later), drug discovery has shifted from whole-animal [[classical pharmacology]] testing methods ([[phenotypic screening]]) to [[reverse pharmacology]] target-approaches that result in the discovery of drugs that may tightly bind with high-affinity to target proteins, but which still often fail in clinical trials due to an under-appreciation of the complexity of the whole organism.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Wavefunction.fieldofscience.com_October_16_2015c"&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Jogalekar A | url = http://wavefunction.fieldofscience.com/2012/03/unstoppable-moore-hits-immovable-eroom.html | work = The Curious Wavefunction | title = The unstoppable Moore hits the immovable Eroom | accessdate = 16 October 2015 | date = 8 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, drug discovery techniques have shifted from small-molecule and iterative low-throughput search strategies to target-based [[high-throughput screening]] (HTS) of large compound libraries. But despite being faster and cheaper, HTS approaches may be less productive.

While some suspect a lack of "low hanging fruit" as a significant contribution to Eroom's law, this may be less important than the four main causes, as there are still many decades worth of new potential drug targets relative to the number of targets which already have been exploited, even if the industry exploits 4-5 new targets per year.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Nature.com_October_16_2015c"/&gt; There is also space to explore selectively non-selective drugs (or "[[dirty drug]]s") that interact with several molecular targets, and which may be particularly effective as central nervous system (CNS) therapeutics, even though few of them have been introduced in the last few decades.&lt;ref name="nature2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roth BL, Sheffler DJ, Kroeze WK | title = Magic shotguns versus magic bullets: selectively non-selective drugs for mood disorders and schizophrenia | journal = Nature Reviews.

[[File:Exberliner cover.jpg|thumb|200px|The July–August edition of the Exberliner]]
'''''Exberliner''''' is an [[English language|English-language]] magazine published in [[Berlin]]. It is published monthly (except for the July/August double issue) and available for €3.90 at newsstands around the city or by subscription. The magazine offers cultural listings, reviews, journalistic articles, opinion columns and a large classified section which is also continually updated online. It also regularly organizes parties and cultural events (such as the monthly English-language Wednesdays at Burger in Kaffee Burger) in English. The magazine was founded as a free newspaper in 2002 named ''The Berliner'' but was forced to change the name, which was already trademarked. The new name is intended as a play on [[expatriate]] (English-speaking expatriates being a major target audience). The publishing house Iomauna Media GmbH also operates Exberliner Flat Rentals, which helps foreigners rent apartments in Berlin, as well as Exberliner Jobs, a job board for internationals in Berlin.

In February 2013, Exberliner published an article called RANT! "Sorry, No German!"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.exberliner.com/articles/sorry-no-german/&lt;/ref&gt; which caused a lot of debate around the behaviour of expatriates in Berlin, and also led to discussions about [[gentrification]] in Berlin. The article lamented the fact that many expats in Berlin do not learn German.

'''Forensic astronomy''' is the use of [[astronomy]], the scientific study of celestial objects, to determine the appearance of the sky at specific times in the past. This has been used, if relatively rarely, in [[forensic science]] (that is, for solving problems of relevance to the legal system) and for resolving [[history|historical]] problems more generally, notably issues in [[art history]].

==Forensic science==
As a forensic science in the strict sense of the term, astronomical knowledge can help resolve certain legal questions. In one reported instance, an astronomer testified in court as an [[expert witness]] as to whether a newly built house would cast a shadow on another house. More generally, questions about the sun's or moon's placement in the sky at certain times of day or night may be legally relevant, such as for determining the date on which a  photograph was made.&lt;ref name="Marché"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marché|first=Jordan D.|title=Theaters of time and space: American planetaria, 1930-1970|year=2005|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|isbn=978-0-8135-3576-0|pages=177|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=olT1ipj-EboC&amp;pg=PA177}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has for instance been reported that [[Abraham Lincoln]] once successfully defended a legal case by describing the location of the Moon on the night of the offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pistalu|first=Mary Ellen|title=Astronomy Takes the Stand: Using the Heavens to Solve Crimes|journal=[[Mercury Magazine]]|issue=January/February 2006|publisher=[[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Frederic Church Meteor of 1860.jpg|thumb|[[Frederic Edwin Church]], ''[[The Meteor of 1860]]'']]

By extension, the adjective "forensic" has come to be used for any detailed analysis of past events, whether related to legal questions or not, and so the determination of past celestial constellations more generally is now increasingly referred to as "forensic astronomy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunn|first=Alan|title=Essential Forensic Biology|year=2009|publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]]|isbn=978-0-470-75803-8|pages=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eesJuyXhKHoC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For research in [[art history]], in particular, methods of astronomy are sometimes useful for determining the place and time of creation of a particular work of art, or of the event that inspired it. Such methods have for instance been used to date [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s painting ''[[Evening Landscape with Rising Moon]]'' (to 9:08 pm, 13 July 1889), and to identify the [[meteor]]s described in [[Walt Whitman]]'s poem ''[[Year of Meteors (1859-60)]]'' – in conjunction with [[Frederic Edwin Church]]'s painting of the same event (at right) – as the [[meteor procession]] of [[1860 Great Meteor|1860]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Falk|first=Dan|title=Forensic astronomer solves Walt Whitman mystery|url=https://www.newscientist.com/blogs/culturelab/2010/06/the-forensic-astronomer-donald-olson.php|accessdate=2 June 2010|newspaper=[[New Scientist]] CultureLab|date=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1602">In [[music composition]], '''fragmentation ''' is the use of fragments or the "division of a musical idea ([[Musical gestures|gesture]], [[motif (music)|motive]], [[theme (music)|theme]], etc.) into [[segmentation (music)|segments]]". It is used in [[Tonality|tonal]] and [[Atonality|atonal]] music, and is a common method of localized [[musical development|development]] and [[resolution (music)|closure]].

Fragmentation is related to [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s concept of ''[[liquidation (music)|liquidation]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Schoenberg, Arnold. ''Fundamentals of Musical Composition''. London, 1967. p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; a common [[musical technique|compositional technique]] that describes the '''reduction of a large-scale musical idea to its essential form''' (such as a contour line, a specific harmonic motion, or the like).&lt;ref&gt;After Michael Friedmann, course lectures and materials for MUSI 305: Analysis and Composition of Twentieth Century Music, Yale College, Yale University, fall 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Liquidation shapes much thematically-driven music, such as that by [[Béla Bartók]],&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Deborah.

New York: Oxford University Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-19-517010-5}}. p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Stravinsky, and Schoenberg himself. It is important to understand that, although they are related, fragmentation and liquidation are separate processes and concepts.

The word '''''geek''''' is a [[slang]] term originally used to describe [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]] or non-mainstream people; in current use, the word typically connotes an expert or [[enthusiast]] or a person obsessed with a hobby or [[intellectual]] pursuit, with a general [[pejorative]] meaning of a "peculiar person, especially one who is perceived to be overly intellectual, unfashionable, boring, or socially awkward".&lt;ref name="merriam-webster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/geek|title=Geek|date=|accessdate=January 2, 2016 |work=Dictionary.com-Merriam-Webster entry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some use the term self-referentially without malice or as a source of pride,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hAzJoAEACAAJ&amp;dq=geek+art&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQ74qlp_PXAhWQqaQKHe77D7oQ6AEIJjAA|title=Geek-Art: An Anthology: Art, Design, Illustration &amp; Pop Culture|first=Thomas|last=Olivri|date=4 November 2014|publisher=Chronicle Books|page=4|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; often referring simply to "someone who is interested in a subject (usually intellectual or complex) for its own sake". Nonetheless, it remains a pejorative, widely used in an abusive manner especially against children and teens who may be more focused on studies, while less popular, fashionable, or socially inclined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Berlatsky |first= Noah|title=Why Geeks Get Bullied (It's Not Necessarily for Being Geeks) |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/01/why-geeks-get-bullied-its-not-necessarily-for-being-geeks/272723/ |magazine=The Atlantic |date=31 Jan 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word comes from [[English dialect]] ''geek'' or ''geck'' (meaning a "fool" or "[[freak]]"; from [[Middle Low German]] ''Geck''). "Geck" is a standard term in modern German and means "fool" or "fop".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Geck |title=Duden &amp;#124; Geck &amp;#124; Rechtschreibung, Bedeutung, Definition, Synonyme, Herkunft |language=de |publisher=Duden.de |date=October 30, 2012 |accessdate=June 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The root also survives in the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Afrikaans]] [[adjective]] ''gek'' ("crazy"), as well as some [[German dialects]], and in the [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]] word ''Gickeleshut'' ("[[jester]]'s hat"; used during carnival).&lt;ref name="merriam-webster"/&gt; In 18th century [[Austria]], ''Gecken'' were freaks on display in some [[circus]]es. In 19th century North America, the term ''geek'' referred to a performer in a [[geek show]] in a circus, [[traveling carnival]] or [[travelling funfair]] [[sideshow]]s (see also [[freak show]]).&lt;ref name="Online-Etymology-Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=geek|title=Geek|date=|accessdate=May 3, 2013 |work=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1976 edition of the ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]'' included only the definition regarding geek shows.{{Clarification|date=December 2017}} This variation of the term was used to comic effect in an episode of popular 1970s TV show [[Sanford &amp; Son]].
Professional wrestling manager "Classy" [[Freddie Blassie]] recorded a song in the 1970s called "Pencil-Necked Geek".

==Definitions==
The 1975 edition of the American Heritage Dictionary, published a decade before the [[Digital Revolution|Digital revolution]], gave only one definition: "Geek [noun, slang]. A carnival performer whose act usually consists of biting the head off a live chicken or snake." The tech revolution found new uses for this word, but it still often conveys a derogatory sting. Today, Dictionary.com gives five definitions, the fourth of which is "a carnival performer who performs sensationally morbid or disgusting acts, as biting off the head of a live chicken." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/geek |title=Dictionary.com: Geek |language=en |accessdate=May 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of geek has been used as slang with different connotations, including as an affectionate label. However, this doesn't mean that the term is meaningless or has lost its meaning over time. It remains mostly a derogatory term used to label people unfairly and offensively. Not a friendly and affectionate compliment about somebody's personality, but a hurtful insulting form of invalidation or emotional abuse.

The term [[nerd]] has a similar, practically synonymous meaning as geek, but many choose to identify different connotations among these two terms, although the differences are disputed. In a 2007 interview on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', [[Richard A. Clarke|Richard Clarke]] said the difference between nerds and geeks is "geeks get it done" or "ggid"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/80961/january-17-2007/richard-clarke The Colbert Report 17th of January video interview Richard Clarke]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julie Smith (novelist)|Julie Smith]] defined a geek as "a bright young man turned inward, poorly socialized, who felt so little kinship with his own planet that he routinely traveled to the ones invented by his favorite authors, who thought of that secret, dreamy place his computer took him to as cyberspace—somewhere exciting, a place more real than his own life, a land he could conquer, not a drab teenager's room in his parents' house".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reconstruction.eserver.org/061/christensen.shtml |title=Reconstruction 6.1 (Winter 2006) |publisher=Reconstruction.eserver.org |date= |accessdate=June 30, 2014 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] met with Facebook’s [[Mark Zuckerberg]] and the CEOs of the world’s largest technology firms at a private dinner in Woodside, California on February 17, 2011, ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine ran a story titled "The world’s most powerful man meets President Obama".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The world’s most powerful man meets President Obama |first1=Dan |last1=Amira |date=February 18, 2011 |newspaper=[[New York Magazine]] |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2011/02/the_worlds_most_powerful_man_m.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Zuckerberg’s company had grown to over one billion users.

According to [[Mark Roeder]] the rise of the geek represents a new phase of human evolution. In his book, ''[[Unnatural Selection: Why The Geeks Will Inherit The Earth]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harpercollins.com.au/books/Unnatural-Selection-Why-Geeks-Will-Inherit-Earth-Mark-Roeder/?isbn=9781743095683 Unnatural Selection by Mark Roeder]&lt;/ref&gt; he suggests that "the high-tech environment of the [[Anthropocene]] favours people with geek-like traits, many of whom are on the [[autism spectrum]], [[ADHD]], or [[dyslexia]]. Previously, such people may have been at a disadvantage, but now their unique cognitive traits enable some of them to resonate with the new technological [[zeitgeist]] and become very successful."

''[[The Economist]]'' magazine observed, on June 2, 2012, "Those square pegs (geeks) may not have an easy time in school. They may be mocked by jocks and ignored at parties. But these days no serious organisation can prosper without them."&lt;ref&gt;In praise of misfits. Economist. June 2, 2012. http://www.economist.com/node/21556230&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Geek chic'''" refers to a minor fashion trend that arose in the mid 2000s in which young people adopted "geeky" fashions, such as oversized black [[horn-rimmed glasses]], [[suspenders]]/[[Braces (clothing)|braces]], and [[three quarter pants|highwater trousers]]. The glasses—sometimes worn with non-prescription lenses or [[lensless glasses|without lenses]]—quickly became the defining aspect of the trend, with the media identifying various celebrities as "trying geek" or "going geek" for wearing such glasses, such as [[David Beckham]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Geeky Becks' specs appeal|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3135201/Geeky-Becks-specs-appeal.html#ixzz2MKyQ8coR|accessdate=March 1, 2013|newspaper=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|date=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Justin Timberlake]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nice glasses!

[[File:Image Germania (painting).jpg|thumb|[[Germania (St. Paul's Church, Frankfurt am Main)|''Germania'' painting from 1848]], creator unknown. This image  once covered the old organ inside the ''[[St. Paul's Church, Frankfurt|Paulskirche]]'', above where the [[Frankfurt Parliament]] assembled from 1848 to 1849.]]

[[File:Germania figur.jpg|thumb|right|Figure of Germania atop the [[Niederwalddenkmal]] in the [[Rhine valley]], dedicated 1883]]

'''Germania''' is the [[national personification|personification]] of the [[Germany|German nation]] or the [[German people|Germans]] as a whole, most commonly associated with the [[Romantic Era]] and the [[Revolutions of 1848]], though the figure was later used by [[German Empire|Imperial Germany]].

== Description ==
"Germania" is the Latin name of the country called "Deutschland" in the spoken language of its own inhabitants, though used as the country's name in various other languages, such as "Germany" in English. In the country itself, the use of the Latin "Germania" was mainly literary and poetical, linked with patriotic and nationalist feelings, like "[[Hibernia]]" for Ireland, "[[Caledonia]]" for Scotland, "[[Lusitania]]" for Portugal etc. 

Germania as personification is usually depicted as a robust woman with long, flowing, reddish-blonde hair and wearing armour. She often wields the ''Reichsschwert'' ([[Imperial Sword|imperial sword]]), and  possesses a medieval-style shield that sometimes bears the image of a [[Coat of arms of Germany|black eagle on a gold field]]. Additionally, she is sometimes shown as carrying or wearing the [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire]].

In post-1918 images, the banner she holds is the [[Flag of Germany|black-red-gold flag of modern Germany]], but in depictions from 1871 to 1918 it is the [[Flag of Germany#North German Confederation and the German Empire (1867–1918)|black-white-red flag]] of the [[German Empire]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3750">'''Hari-Kuyō''' ({{lang-ja|針供養}}) is the Japanese [[Buddhist]] and  [[Shinto]] Festival of Broken Needles, celebrated on February 8 in the Kanto region, but on December 8 in the Kyoto and Kansai regions.&lt;ref&gt;Greve, Gabi. "Saijiki for Festivals and Ceremonies" at http://wkdfestivalsaijiki.blogspot.com/2011/01/needle-ceremonies-hari-kuyo.html accessed on February 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; It is celebrated by women in Japan as a memorial to all the [[sewing needle]]s broken in their service during the past year, and as an opportunity to pray for improved skills. It is also called the Needle Mass and Pin Festival.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, Debbie. "Hari-kuyo: Festival of Broken Needles," Stitchtress.com at http://stitchtress.com/2010/02/08/hari-kuyo/ , accessed on February 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; "Hari" means "needle" and the suffix "-kuyo" means "memorial",&lt;ref&gt;Willem. “TRC - Database Search Our Collection.” Hari Kuyo (Japan), trc-leiden.nl/trc-needles/texts-films-customs-and-event/celebrations/hari-kuyo-japan.&lt;/ref&gt; derived from a Sanskrit word ''pūjā'' or ''pūjanā'', meaning "to bring offerings".&lt;ref&gt;Kretschmer 379&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Hari-Kuyō began four hundred years ago as a way for housekeepers and professional needle-workers to acknowledge their work over the past years and respect their tools. In the [[Animism|animist]] traditions, items as well as humans, animals, plants, and objects are considered to have souls. This festival acknowledged the good given to people by their tools. Practitioners went to Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples to thank their broken needles for their help and service.&lt;ref&gt;Bates&lt;/ref&gt; This is in keeping with the philosophy of "not wasting" or "paying honor to the small things" exemplified in the concept of [[mottainai]].
[[File:針供養.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A ceremony at the Awashima Shrine]]

==Modern practice==
Festival-goers gather at shrines and temples, bringing their broken needles and pins. In a funereal atmosphere, the implements are laid to rest in [[tofu]] or [[konjac|konnyaku (soft jelly cakes)]] in a spirit of tenderness and gratitude.&lt;ref&gt;Bates&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A small three-step altar is set up and hung with a sacred rope and strips of cut white paper which indicate a sanctified area. On the top step are offerings of fruit and sweet cakes. On the middle step is a cake of tofu and on the bottom step are various sewing accessories.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;On this day, the seamstresses take a holiday and bring their old needles to the temple to stick them in a piece of tofu or konnyaku. Threads of the five Buddhist colors were used with the needles."&lt;ref&gt;Greve&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Hinduism]] is a religion which incorporates diverse views on the concept of God. Different traditions of Hinduism have different theistic views, and these views have been described by scholars as [[polytheism]], [[monotheism]], [[henotheism]], [[panentheism]], [[pantheism]], [[monism]], [[agnostic]], [[humanism]], [[Atheism in Hinduism|atheism]] or [[Nontheism|non-theism]].&lt;ref&gt;[a] [[Julius J.

Monotheism is the belief in a single creator God who is almighty, omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Trigger (2003), Understanding Early Civilizations: A Comparative Study, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521822459}}, pages 473-474&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Taliaferro and Elsa J. Marty (2010), A Dictionary of Philosophy of Religion, Bloomsbury Academic, {{ISBN|978-1441111975}}, pages 98-99&lt;/ref&gt; Hinduism does not posit or require such a belief, and is considered a non-monotheistic religion by scholars of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric Ackroyd|title=Divinity in Things: Religion Without Myth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bv8o5lGxtgAC&amp;pg=PA78 |year=2009|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-84519-333-1 |pages=78 }}, Quote: "The jealous God who says, "Thou shalt have no other gods but me" belongs to the Jewish-Christian-Muslim tradition, but not to the Hindu tradition, which tolerates all gods but is not a monotheism, monism, yes, but not monotheism."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Whaling|title=Understanding Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WudXAAAAYAAJ |year=2010|publisher=Dunedin Academic Press |isbn=978-1-903765-36-4 |pages=19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hiroshi Ōbayashi|title=Death and afterlife: perspectives of world religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ub8oAAAAYAAJ |year=1992|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-0-275-94104-8 |pages=145 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many traditions within Hinduism share the Vedic idea of a metaphysical ultimate reality and truth called [[Brahman]] instead. According to [[Jan Gonda]], Brahman denoted the  "power immanent in the sound, words, verses and formulas of Vedas" in the earliest Vedic texts. The early Vedic religious understanding of Brahman underwent a series of abstractions in the Hindu scriptures that followed the Vedic scriptures. These scriptures would reveal a vast body of insights into the nature of Brahman as originally revealed in the Vedas. These Hindu traditions that emerged from or identified with the Vedic scriptures and that maintained the notion of a metaphysical ultimate reality would identify that ultimate reality as Brahman. Hindu adherents to these traditions within Hinduism revere Hindu deities and, indeed, all of existence, as aspects of the Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld, ''Brahman'', The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0823931798}}, page 122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Flood (1996), An Introduction to Hinduism, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521438780}}, pages 84-85&lt;/ref&gt; The deities in Hinduism are not considered to be almighty, omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent, and spirituality is considered to be seeking the ultimate truth that is possible by a number of paths.&lt;ref name=johnmurdoch141&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|title=The Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V7cEF8JfPHQC |year=1976|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-03163-0|page=63}};&lt;br&gt;{{cite book|author=Harvey P.

In [[Hindu philosophy]], there are many different schools.&lt;ref name=bowker194&gt;{{cite book|author=John Bowker|title=Problems of Suffering in Religions of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W7IcQL1JBvAC |year=1975|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-09903-5 |pages=194, 206–220 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its non-theist traditions such as Samkhya, early Nyaya, Mimamsa and many within Vedanta such as Advaita do not posit the existence of an almighty, omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent God (monotheistic God), while its theistic traditions posit a personal God left to the choice of the Hindu. The major schools of Hindu philosophy explain morality and the nature of existence through the [[karma]] and [[samsara]] doctrines, as in other Indian religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kaufman | first=Whitley R.

Contemporary Hinduism can be categorized into four major traditions: [[Vaishnavism]], [[Shaivism]], [[Shaktism]], and [[Smarta Tradition|Smartism]]. Vaishnavism, Shaivism, and Shaktism worship [[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]], and [[Devi]] — the Divine Mother — as the Supreme respectively, or consider all Hindu deities as aspects of the formless Supreme Reality or [[Brahman]]. Other minor sects such as [[Ganapatya]] and [[Saura (Hinduism)|Saura]] focus on [[Ganesha]] and [[Surya]] as the Supreme. A sub-tradition within the [[Vaishnavism]] school of Hinduism that is an exception is dualistic [[Dvaita]], founded by [[Madhvacharya]] in the 13th-century (where Vishnu as Krishna is a monotheistic God). This tradition posits a concept of monotheistic God so similar to Christianity that Christian missionaries in colonial India suggested that Madhvacharya was likely influenced by early Christians who migrated to India,&lt;ref name=skhk177&gt;Sabapathy Kulandran and Hendrik Kraemer (2004), Grace in Christianity and Hinduism, James Clarke, {{ISBN|978-0227172360}}, pages 177-179&lt;/ref&gt; a theory that has been discredited by scholars.{{Sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=266}}{{Sfn|Sarma|2000|pp=19-21}}

Krishnaism is a sub-tradition of Vaishnavism wherein Krishna is considered ''[[Svayam Bhagavan]]'', meaning 'Lord Himself' and it is used exclusively to designate Krishna as the Supreme Lord.&lt;ref name=Gupta20071&gt;Gupra, 2007, p.36 note 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = jsn&gt;''Bhagawan Swaminarayan bicentenary commemoration volume, 1781-1981.'' p. 154: ...Shri Vallabhacharya [and] Shri Swaminarayan...

The theological interpretation of ''{{IAST|svayam bhagavān}}'' differs with each tradition and the translated from the [[Sanskrit language]], the term literary means "[[Bhagavan]] Himself" or "directly [[Bhagavan]]."&lt;ref name=Gupta2007/&gt; Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition often translates it within its perspective as ''primeval Lord'' or ''original Personality of Godhead'', but also considers the terms such as ''Supreme Personality of Godhead'' and ''Supreme God'' as an equivalent to the term ''Svayam Bhagavan'', and may also choose to apply these terms to  Vishnu, Narayana and many of their associated avatars.&lt;ref name=Knapp2005&gt;{{cite book| author = Knapp, S.| year = 2005| title = The Heart of Hinduism: The Eastern Path to Freedom, Empowerment and Illumination -| publisher = iUniverse| isbn =}} "Krishna is the primeval Lord, the original Personality of Godhead, so He can  expand Himself into unlimited forms with all potencies."

Gaudiya Vaishnavas and followers of the [[Vallabha Sampradaya]] [[Nimbarka Sampradaya]], use the [[Gopala Tapani Upanishad]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=B. V. Tripurari |title=Gopala-tapani Upanisad |publisher=Audarya Press |location= |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=1-932771-12-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Bhagavata Purana, to support their view that Krishna is indeed the ''Svayam Bhagavan''. This belief was summarized by the 16th century author [[Jiva Goswami]] in some of his works, such as ''Krishna-sandarbha''.&lt;ref name=Gupta2007&gt;{{cite book| author = Gupta, Ravi M.| year = 2007| title = Caitanya Vaisnava Vedanta of Jiva Gosvami| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 0-415-40548-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gupta2004&gt;{{cite book| author = Gupta, Ravi M.| year = 2004| title = Caitanya Vaisnava Vedanta: Acintyabhedabheda in Jiva Gosvami's Catursutri tika| publisher = University Of Oxford| isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other sub-traditions of Vaishnavism, Krishna is one of many aspects and [[avatar]]s of Vishnu (Rama is another, for example), recognized and understood from an eclectic assortment of perspectives and viewpoints.&lt;ref name=Mahony1987&gt;{{cite journal| author = Mahony, W.K.| year = 1987| title = Perspectives on Krishna's Various Personalities| journal = History of Religions| volume = 26| issue = 3| pages = 333–335| url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1062381?uid=3739616&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21103483476523|deadurl=no |accessdate=2014-02-10| doi = 10.1086/463085| jstor=1062381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Homo homini lupus''''', or in its unabridged form '''''Homo homini lupus est''''', is a [[Latin proverb]] meaning "A man is a wolf to another man," or more tersely "Man is wolf to man." It has meaning in reference to situations where people are known to have behaved in a way comparably in nature to a [[wolf]]. The wolf as a creature is thought, in this example, to have qualities of being predatory, cruel, inhuman i.e. more like an animal than civilized.

==History==
A variation of the proverb appeared as line 495 in the play ''[[Asinaria]]'' by [[Plautus]]: "''Lupus est homo homini, non homo, quom qualis sit non novit''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Titus Maccius Plautus|author-link=Plautus|title=Asinaria|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/plautus/asinaria.shtml|website=The Latin Library|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which [[wikiquote:Plautus#Asinaria_.28The_One_With_the_Asses.29|has been translated]] as "Man is no man, but a wolf, to a stranger," or more precisely "A man is a wolf, not a man, to another man which he hasn't met yet."

As a counterpoint, [[Seneca the Younger]] wrote, in his ''[[Epistulae morales ad Lucilium]]'' (specifically, Epistula XCV, paragraph 33), "''homo, sacra res homini''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lucius Annaeus Seneca|author-link=Seneca the Younger|title=Epistulae morales ad Lucilium|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/sen/seneca.ep14-15.shtml|website=The Latin Library|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which [[wikisource:Moral letters to Lucilius/Letter 95|has been translated]] as "man, an object of reverence in the eyes of man".

[[Erasmus]] included the proverb in his ''[[Adagia]]'', writing of the variation by Plautus, "Here we are warned not to trust ourselves to an unknown person, but to beware of him as of a wolf."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Erasmus|first=Desiderius|author-link=Desiderius Erasmus|year=2001|orig-year=1500-1536|editor-last=Barker|editor-first=William|title=The Adages of Erasmus|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=0802048749|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmJn6IFMyicC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SvHxgZrDwC&amp;sig=EOZUjNww1ezfCBfkNQLPZekbB1c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0JSQVbDEMoOwsAWI0oPoBA&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher, theologian, and jurist [[Francisco de Vitoria]] (in Latin, Franciscus de Victoria) [[wikisource:De Indis De Jure Belli/Part_2|wrote in one of his ''Relectiones Theologicae'']] that the poet [[Ovid]] disagreed with the proverb: "'Man,' says Ovid, 'is
not a wolf to his fellow man, but a man.'"

[[Thomas Hobbes]] drew upon the proverb in his ''[[De Cive]]'', [[wikisource:De Cive|writing in the dedication]] "To speak impartially, both sayings are very true; That Man to Man is a kind of God; and that Man to Man is an arrant Wolfe. The first is true, if we compare Citizens amongst themselves; and the second, if we compare Cities." Hobbes was describing the tendency of people to act fairly and generously toward other people in the same society and the tendency of societies to act deceptively and violently toward other societies, or [[wikisource: De Cive|as he put it]], "In the one, there's some analogie of similitude with the Deity, to wit, Justice and Charity, the twin-sisters of peace: But in the other, Good men must defend themselves by taking to them for a Sanctuary the two daughters of War, Deceipt and Violence."

[[Sigmund Freud]] agreed with the proverb, writing in his ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'', "Men are not gentle creatures, who want to be loved, who at the most can defend themselves if they are attacked; they are, on the contrary, creatures among whose instinctual endowments is to be reckoned a powerful share of aggressiveness. As a result, their neighbor is for them not only a potential helper or sexual object, but also someone who tempts them to satisfy their aggressiveness on him, to exploit his capacity for work without compensation, to use him sexually without his consent, to seize his possessions, to humiliate him, to cause him pain, to torture and to kill him. ''Homo homini lupus.'' Who in the face of all his experience of life and of history, will have the courage to dispute this assertion?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|author-link=Sigmund Freud|title=Freud, Civilization and Its Discontents, 1930 (excerpt)|url=http://historyguide.org/europe/freud_discontents.html|website=The History Guide|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primatologist and ethologist [[Frans de Waal]] disagreed with the proverb, writing that it "contains two major flaws. First, it fails to do justice to canids, which are among the most gregarious and cooperative animals on the planet (Schleidt and Shalter 2003). But even worse, the saying denies the inherently social nature of our own species."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Waal|first=Frans|author-link=Frans de Waal|year=2006|title=Primates and Philosophers: How Morality Evolved|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691124477|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PccMuO2pcOcC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;1pg=PA3&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMI1OW82OnbxgIVEEGICh1KXgTY#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sacco and Vanzetti|Bartolomeo Vanzetti]], after being convicted of murder, along with Nicolo Sacco, in 1927, said that their pending execution would become an emblem "of a cursed past in which man was wolf to the man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/saccov/courtspeech.html|title=Speeches by Sacco and Vanzetti to the Court at the Time of Sentencing|last=Linder|first=Douglas O.|access-date=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10652">The '''International Panorama Council''' (IPC) is a [[non-governmental organization|nongovernmental]], [[Nonprofit organization|not-for-profit organization]], subject to [[Switzerland|Swiss law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panoramacouncil.org/downloads/IPC-Brochure-pg1-sm%281%29.pdf IPC information Brochure]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a global network involving museum directors, managers, artists, restorers and historians who deal with the historical or the contemporary art and media forms of the [[panorama]]. The organization comprises members from all over the world who are either representatives of museums and research institutes or private researchers and enthusiasts.
The organization was founded in 1992 as the ''European Panorama Conference'' in [[Szeged]]/[[Hungary]] and renamed in 1998 at [[Altoetting]]/[[Germany]] the ''International Panorama Conference''. Since 2003 the organization is called '''International Panorama Council'''. IPC has been a Membership Association since 2010. It is governed by a member-elected [[Board of directors|Executive Board]] whose [[Secretary (title)#Secretary-General|Secretary-General]] acts as the operational center for the Board’s members.

==Main goals==
The purpose of the International Panorama Council is to stimulate worldwide research and communication about existing and future [[panorama]]s and [[cyclorama]]s, advocate for and help preserve the few surviving heritage panoramas, and promote professional affiliation. IPC serves as a bridge connecting the heritage era of the panorama art form to its contemporary and future manifestations, and strives to facilitate the formal international recognition and protection of panoramas by organizations like [[UNESCO]] and the [[Council of Europe]].
The International Panorama Council actively supports the preservation of historical panoramas and cycloramas. In 2007 and 2008 it started a lobbying campaign to save the endangered panorama painting and building &lt;ref&gt;campaign in Innsbruck/Austria: media articles in ''Kronenzeitung'' on March 27, 2008, p. 19, weekly magazine ''Profil'' on September 8, 2008, p. 117 and ''Tiroler Tageszeitung'', November 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]].
An initiative was taken to support the protection of the endangered [[Panorama Mesdag]].&lt;ref&gt;campaign to preserve the endangered Panorama Mesdag, call for action by Europa Nostra on the initiative of IPC [http://www.museum-aktuell.de/index.php?site=news&amp;page=9]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panorama-mesdag.nl Website of  Panorama Mesdag with information on the campaign]&lt;/ref&gt;
A further goal of the IPC is to have the most important historical panoramas from 19c. enrolled as [[UNESCO]] [[World heritage|World Heritage]] sites. A first step has been taken in July 2008 when the [[Waterloo Panorama]] was added to [[Belgium]]'s tentative proposal for the [[UNESCO]] list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/state=be Belgium's tentative list on website of UNESCO]&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2009 Panorama Mesdag applied for inclusion in the tentative list of the Netherlands.

==Activities==
IPC is active in the fields of [[Conservation-restoration|restoration]], [[research]], [[financing]], [[Exhibition|exhibiting]] and [[marketing]] of panoramas and related art forms from the heritage era to its contemporary and future manifestations. IPC maintains a database of existing [[panorama]]s/[[cyclorama]]s, [[Moving panorama]]s, large-scale [[diorama]]s and semi-circle panoramas and many other related art and media forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://panoramacouncil.org/en/what_we_do/resources/panoramas_and_related_art_forms_database/ IPC Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annual conferences==
Since 1992 the International Panorama Council has held annual conferences throughout the world. The conferences are planned to provide a meaningful, professional exchange of ideas with lunches and dinners included, and a joint post-conference excursion to a panorama related site. Presentations in the conference proceedings range from illustrated essays on topographical mapping to restoration and conservation techniques.

'''Iraqi art''', throughout its entire history, has been influenced by war, revolutions and frequent political changes. For centuries, the capital, Baghdad was the Medieval centre of the literary and artistic Arab world, but its artistic traditions suffered at the hands of the Mongol invaders in the 13th century. During other periods it has flourished, such as during the reign of [[Pir Budaq]], or under Ottoman rule in the 16th century when Baghdad was known for its [[Ottoman miniature]] painting. During the rule of the [[Safavids]], Iraqi art was influenced by [[Persian art]], and it became a centre of poetry as well as arts. In the 20th century, an art revival, which combined both tradition and modern techniques, produced many notable poets, painters and sculptors who contributed to the inventory of public artworks, especially in Baghdad. These artists are highly regarded in the Middle East, and some have earned international recognition. The Iraqi modern art movement had a profound influence on pan-Arab art generally.

==History==
[[File:Yahyâ ibn Mahmûd al-Wâsitî 005.jpg|thumb|Illustration from the manuscript of ''Maqâmât'' written by al-Harîrî'', illustrated by [[Yahya ibn Mahmud al-Wasiti|Yahya Al-Wasiti]], c. 13th century]]
The art historian, Nada Shabout, points out that Iraqi art remains largely undocumented. The West has very little idea about Iraqi art. Problems associated with documenting a complete picture of Iraqi art have been compounded by the fact that many 20th-century artists, art historians and philosophers have been forced into exile, where they are isolated from their heritage and current practices.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "Ghosts of Futures Past: Iraqi Culture in a State of Suspension," in Denise Robinson, ''Through the Roadbloacks: Realities in Raw Motion,'' [Conference Reader], School of Fine Arts, Cyprus University, November 23–25, p. 94: it may be worth noting that the Ministry of Culture estimates that 80 percent of Iraqi artists are now living in exile, See: ''Art AsiaPacific Almanac,'' Volume 4, Art AsiaPacific, 2009, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, much of Iraq's art heritage has been looted or destroyed during periods of revolution, war and political unrest.&lt;ref&gt;King, E.A. and Levi, G., ''Ethics and the Visual Arts,'' Skyhorse Publishing, Inc., 2010, pp 105-110&lt;/ref&gt;

Iraq's art has a deep heritage that extends back in time to ancient [[Art of Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian art]]. Iraq has one of the longest written traditions in the world. [[Arabic maqam|Maqam]] traditions in music and calligraphy have survived into the modern day.&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, A., ''State-Society Relations in Ba'thist Iraq: Facing Dictatorship,'' Routledge, 2010, Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt; However, the continuity of Iraq's arts culture has been subject to the vicissitudes of invading armies for centuries. The [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol invasion]] of the 13th-century devastated much traditional art and craft and is generally seen as a break in the tradition of Iraqi art.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, B., "The Iraqi Century of Art," ''Artnet Magazine'', July 2008, Online: http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/reviews/davis/davis7-14-08.asp&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although British archaeologists excavated a number of Iraqi sites, including [[Nimrud]], [[Ninevah]] and [[Tell Halaf]] in Iraq in the 19th-century,&lt;ref&gt;Potts, D.T. (ed), ''A Companion to the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East,'' Volume 1, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2012, p. 51-52; Pouillon, F., ''Dictionnaire des Orientalistes de Langue Française,'' KARTHALA, 2008, p. 924&lt;/ref&gt; they sent many of the artefacts and statues to museums around the world. It was not until the early 20th-century when a small group of Iraqi artists were awarded scholarships to study abroad that they became aware of ancient [[Sumerian art]] by visiting pretigious museums such as the [[Louvre]], enabling them to reconnect with their cultural and intellectual heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "Jewad Selim: On Abstraction and Symbolism," in ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World,'' [http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/essays/Pages/Jewad-Selim,-On-Abstraction-and-Symbolism.aspx Online]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, figurines, dating to the [[Neolithic]] period, found at the Palace of [[Tell Halaf]] and elsewhere, attest to Iraq's ancient artistic heritage.

The [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanids]] ruled the region that is now Iraq and Iran between the 3rd and 7th centuries. [[Sasanian art]] is best represented in metalwork, jewellery, architecture and wall-reliefs. Few paintings from this period have survived, but an understanding of jewellery ornamentation can be inferred from pictorial and sculptural representations.&lt;ref&gt;Ettinghausen, E., Grabar,O. and Jenkins, M., ''Islamic Art and Architecture: 650-1250,'' Yale University Press, 2001,  pp 66-68&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the early Islamic period, writing was transformed into an "iconophoric message...a carrier of meaning independent of its form [and] into a subject worthy of the most elaborate ornamentation." &lt;ref name="Ettinghausen, E. 1250, p. 79"&gt;Ettinghausen, E., Grabar,O. and Jenkins, M., ''Islamic Art and Architecture: 650-1250,'' Yale University Press, 2001,  p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;  Another development during this period was the use of repeating patterns or motifs on scrolls and wall-reliefs. Inherited from the Muslims, this highly stylised system of ornamentation was subsequently given the label of ''[[arabesque]]''.&lt;ref name="Ettinghausen, E. 1250, p. 79"/&gt;  
[[File:Al-Kadhimiya Mosque 4.jpg|thumb|left|[[Al-Kadhimiya Mosque]], Baghdad, showing use of Arabesque]]

The [[Abassid]] Dynasty controlled much of the region now encompassed by Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Syria, between the 8th and 13th-centuries. During the Abassid period, pottery achieved a high level of sophistication, calligraphy began to be used to decorate the surface of decorative objects and illuminated manuscripts, particularly [[Quran|Q'ranic]] texts became more complex and stylised.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand, R., ''Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Thames &amp; Hudson, [World of Art series], 1999, London, p. 59 {{ISBN|978-0-500-20305-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iraq's first art school was established during this period, allowing artisans and crafts to flourish. &lt;ref&gt;Dabrowska, K. and Hann, G., ''Iraq Then and Now: A Guide to the Country and Its People,'' Bradt Travel Guides, 2008, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

At the height of the Abassid period, in the late 12th-century, a stylistic movement of manuscript illustration and calligraphy emerged. Now known as the ''[[Baghdad School]]'' (or ''Mesopotamian School''), this movement of Islamic art was characterised by representations of everyday life and the use of highly expressive faces rather than the stereotypical characters that had been used in the past. The school consisted of calligraphers, illustrators, transcribers and translators, who collaborated to produce illuminated manuscripts derived from non-Arabic sources.  The works were primarily scientific, philosophical, social commentary or humorous entertainments. This movement continued for at least four decades, and dominated art in the first half of the 13th-century.&lt;ref name="Online"&gt;"Baghdad school," in: ''Encyclopædia Britannica,'' [https://www.britannica.com/art/Baghdad-school Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; Poetry also flourished during the Abbasid period, producing notable poets including: the 9th-century Sufi poets [[Mansur Al-Hallaj]] and [[Abu Nuwas|Abū Nuwās al-Ḥasan ibn Hānī al-Ḥakamī]].  

The Abbasid artist, [[Yahya ibn Mahmud al-Wasiti|Yahya Al-Wasiti]] lived in [[Baghdad]] in the late Abassid era (12th to 13th-centuries) was the pre-eminent artist of the Baghdad school. His most well-known works include the llustrations for the book of the ''[[Maqamat Badi' az-Zaman al-Hamadhani|Maqamat]]'' (Assemblies) in 1237, a series of anecdotes of social satire written by [[Al-Hariri of Basra|al-Hariri]].&lt;ref&gt;"Baghdad school," in: ''Encyclopædia Britannica,'' [https://www.britannica.com/art/Baghdad-school Online:]; Esanu, O., ''Art, Awakening, and Modernity in the Middle East: The Arab Nude,'' Routledge, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Waiti's illustrations served as an inspiration for the 20th-century modern Baghdad art movement.&lt;ref&gt;Wijdan, A. (ed.), ''Contemporary Art From The Islamic World,''Scorpion, 1989, p.166&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of works in the style of the Baghdad School include the illustrations in ''Rasa'il al-Ikhwan al-Safa'' (''The Epistles of the Sincere Brethren''), (1287); an Arabic translation of [[Pedanius Dioscorides]]’ medical text, ''[[De Materia Medica]]'' (1224)&lt;ref name="Online"/&gt; and the illustrated ''Kalila wa Dimna'' ([[Panchatantra|Fables of Bidpai]]), (1222); a collection of fables by the Hindu, Bidpai translated into Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;"Baghdad school," in: Miriam Drake (ed), ''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science,'' Volume 2, 2nd ed., [[CRC Press]], 2003, p. 1259; Dimand, M.S., ''A Handbook of Mohammedan Decorative Arts,'' New York, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], 1930, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:DiezAlbumsFallOfBaghdad.jpg|thumb|''Fall of Baghdad,'' illustration by Rashid-ad-Din's Gami' at-tawarih, early 14th-century]]
For centuries, Baghdad was the capital of the [[Abbasid caliphate]]; its library was unrivalled and a magnet for intellectuals around the known world. However, in 1258, Baghdad fell to the [[Mongols|Mongol]] invaders, who pillaged the city, decimating mosques, libraries and palaces, thereby destroying most of the city's literary, religious and artistic assets. The Mongols also killed between 200,000 and one million people, leaving the population totally demoralised and the city barely habitable.&lt;ref&gt;Frazier, I., "Invaders: Destroying Baghdad," ''New Yorker Magazine,'' [Special edition: Annals of History], April 25, 2005, [https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/04/25/invaders-3 Online Issue]&lt;/ref&gt; Iraqi art historians view this period as a time when the "chain of pictorial art" was broken.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "Jewad Selim: On Abstraction and Symbolism," in ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World,'' [http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/essays/Pages/Jewad-Selim,-On-Abstraction-and-Symbolism.aspx Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the years 1400-1411 Iraq was ruled by the [[Jalayirid dynasty]]. During this time, Iraqi art and culture flourished. Between 1411 and 1469, during the rule of the [[Qara Quyunlu dynasty]] artists from different parts of the eastern Islamic world were invited to Iraq. Under the patronage of [[Pir Budaq]], son of the [[Kara Koyunlu|Qara Quyunlu]] ruler, [[Jahan Shah]] (r. 1439–67), Iranian styles from [[Tabriz]] and [[Shiraz]] and even the styles of [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] Central Asia were all brought together in Iraq. Baghdad's importance as a centre of the arts declined after Pir Budaq's death in 1466. The Qara Quyunlu period ended with the advent of the [[Aq Quyunlu]]. Though noted patrons of the arts, the Aq Quyunlu mostly focus on areas outside Iraq.&lt;ref name=met&gt;{{Cite web| title = Iraq, 1400–1600 A.D. {{!}} Chronology| work = The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History| accessdate = July 20, 2017| url = http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/08/wam.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1508 and 1534, Iraq came under the rule of the [[Safavid dynasty]], which shifted the focus of arts to Iran. Baghdad experienced a revival in the arts during this period, and was also a centre for literary works. The poet Fuzûlî (ca. 1495–1556) wrote during the period. He wrote in the three dominant languages of his time: Arabic, Persian, and Turkish. Iraq was incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1534, during the reign of [[Suleyman the Magnificent]]. The Iraqi poet [[Fuzûlî]] wrote in Arabic, Persian and Turkish during this time, and continued writing poetry after Ottoman rule was established in 1534.&lt;ref name=met/&gt; During the 16th century, Baghdad underwent another period of artistic revival; Iraqi painting from this time is called the “Baghdad school” of Ottoman miniature painting.&lt;ref name=met/&gt;

Iraqi experienced a cultural shift between the years 1400 and 1600 CE, which is also reflected in its arts. In the 16th century, political rule in Iraq transitioned from the [[Mongol Empire|Turco-Mongol dynasties]] to the Ottoman Empire. In its past Iraq had been a centre of [[illuminated manuscripts]] but this art form experienced a general decline during this period.&lt;ref name=met/&gt;

==19th-century==
Until the 20th-century, Iraq had no tradition of easel painting. Traditional art, which included metal-work, rug-making and weaving, glass-blowing, ceramic tiles, calligraphy and wall murals were widely practised during the 19th-century. Some traditional practices traced their origins back to the 9th-century Assyrians. However, in the 19th-century, mural painters were generally seen as artisans rather than artists - although in traditional Islamic society, the distinction between artists and artists was not well defined. A few named individuals are known, including the painter, Abbud 'the Jewish' Naqqash and the calligrapher, painter and decorator; [[Hashem Muhammad al-Baghdadi|Hashim al-Khattat]] ("Hashim the Calligrapher", early 20th-century) (d. 1973) and [[Niazi Mawlawi hashim]] (19th century), but relatively few details of their lives and careers are known.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the late 19th-century, the rise of nationalistic and intellectual movements across the Arab world led to calls for an Arab-lslamic cultural revival. Artists and intellectuals felt that the growth in Western influences was a threat to Arab cultural identity. At the same time as local artists began to adopt Western practices such as easel painting. &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; they also searched consciously for a distinct national style.&lt;ref&gt;Tibi, B., ''Arab Nationalism between Islam and the Nation-state'', 3rd edn., New York, Saint Martin's Press, 1997, pp. 49-49&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th-century==
The late 19th-century and early 20th-century are known as ''Nahda'' in Arabic. This term loosely translates as a "revival" or "renaissance." Nahda became an important cultural movement which influenced all art forms - architecture, literature, poetry and the visual arts. &lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the turn of the 20th-century, a small group of Iraqis were sent to Istanbul for military training, where painting and drawing was included as part of the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Tejel, J., ''Writing the Modern History of Iraq: Historiographical and Political Challenges,'' World Scientific, 2012, p. 476&lt;/ref&gt;  This group, which became known as the ''Ottoman artists,'' included [[Abdul Qadir Al Rassam]] (1882-1952); Mohammed Salim Moussali (1886-?); Hassan Sami, Assem Hafith (1886-1978); Mohammed Saleh Zaki (1888-1974) and [[Mohammed Hajji Selim|Hajji Mohammed Salim]] (1883-1941).&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p.199&lt;/ref&gt; were exposed to European painting techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Their style of painting was realism, impressionism or romanticism. &lt;ref&gt;Sharifian, S., Mohammadzade, M.,  Naef, S. and Mehraee, M., "Cultural Continuity in Modern Iraqi Painting between 1950- 1980," ''The Scientific Journal of NAZAR Research Center (Nrc) for Art, Architecture &amp; Urbanism,'' vol.14, no.47, May 2017, pp 43-54&lt;/ref&gt; On their return to Baghdad, they set up studios and began to offer painting lessons to talented, local artists. Many of the next generation of artists began by studying with the artists from the Ottoman group. &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 47; Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Their public works, which included murals, public monuments and artworks in the foyers of institutions or commercial buildings, exposed Iraqi people to Western art and contributed to art appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;  

As Middle-Eastern nations began to emerge from colonial rule, a nationalist sentiment developed. Artists consciously sought out ways to combine Western art techniques with traditional art and local subject matter. In Iraq, 20th century artists were at the forefront of developing a national style, and provided a model for other Arab nations who wanted to forge their own national identities. &lt;ref&gt;King, E.A. and Levi, G., ''Ethics and the Visual Arts,'' Skyhorse Publishing, Inc., 2010, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
Poetry and verse remains a major art form in modern Iraq and Iraqi poets were inspired by the literature of the 15th and 16th-centuries when Iraq was the centre of Arabic world. Notable 20th-century poets include [[Nazik Al-Malaika]] (1923-2007), one of the best known woman poets in the Arab world and who wrote the poem ''My Brother Jafaar'' for her brother, who was killed during the [[Al-Wathbah uprising]] in 1948; [[Muhammad Mahdi al-Jawahiri|Muḥammad Mahdī al-Jawāhirī]] (1899-1997); [[Badr Shakir al-Sayyab]] (1926-1964); [[Abd al-Wahhab Al-Bayati]] (1926-1999) &lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{Cite web| title = Iraq - The arts {{!}} history - geography| work = Encyclopedia Britannica| accessdate = July 20, 2017| url = https://www.britannica.com/place/Iraq/The-arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ma'rif al-Rasafi (1875-1845); Abdulraziq Abdulwahed (b. 1930); the revolutionary poet, [[Muzaffar Al-Nawab]] (b. 1934); Buland Al Haidari (b. 1926) and Janil Sidiq al-Zahaiwi (1863-1936). In post-war Iraq, poetry was very much influenced by the political and social upheavals that Iraqis had experienced throughout the 20th-century and with many poets living in exile, themes of 'strangeness' and 'being a stranger' often dominated contemporary poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Altoma, S.J., "Postwar Iraqi Literature: Agonies of Rebirth", ''Books Abroad'', Vol. 46, No. 2 (Spring, 1972), pp. 211-217 DOI: 10.2307/40126073&lt;/ref&gt;

Iraqi poets, including Badr Shakir al-Sayyab, often turned to Iraqi folklore which they often integrated with Western mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Gohar, S.M., "Appropriating English Literature in Post-WWII Iraqi Poetry", ''The Victorian'', vol. 5, no. 2. 2017, pp 10-22&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered one of the most influential Arab poets because he was the first to develop the free form style of poetry, and therefore a prime mover in the development of modernist poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Ghareeb, E.A. and  Dougherty, B., ''Historical Dictionary of Iraq,'' Scarecrow Press, 2004, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Iraqi poetry is considerably freer than traditional verse, and is imbued with social and political awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Longrigg, S. and Stoakes, F., "The Social Pattern," in: Abdulla M. Lutfiyya and Charles W. Churchill (eds), ''Readings in Arab Middle Eastern Societies and Cultures,'' p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photography===
[[File:Murad-Net Casting.jpg|thumb|left|''Casting the Net'' photograph by [[Murad al-Daghistani]] whose work captured the life and work of every-day people in 1930s' Mosul]]
Scholars point out that very little is known about photography in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan, T., ''Photography, History, Difference'', Dartmouth College Press, 2014, pp 63-64&lt;/ref&gt; Iraq was relatively slow to adopt photography as an industry and art form, due to the religious and social prohibitions on making figurative images. The first camera entered Iraq as late as 1895 when an Iraqi photographer, Abdul-Karim Tiouti, from Basra, returned to Iraq following a trip to India where he had studied the art of photography. He founded a photographic studio and practiced this profession for many years.&lt;ref&gt;Kalash, K., "In Digital Technology, Solar Photography is a Time-immemorial Profession, " ''Iraq Journal,''; also reproduced in: ''Alahad News'', 26 May, 2016 [http://alahadnews.net/index.php/permalink/10051.html Online:] (translated from Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first decades of the 20th-century, several factors contributed to the spread of photography. Firstly, British and European archaeologists began using photography to document ancient sites in the second half of the 19th-century. Religious missionaries were also using the camera to document historic religious sites. These activities exposed local Iraqis to the technology, and provided young men with employment opportunities as photographers and camera-men assisting archaeological teams. For instance, throughout the 1920s and early 1930s, the American anthropologist, [[Henry Field (anthropologist)|Professor Henry Field]] was involved in several expeditions to ancient Mesopotamian sites and in his publications, he acknowledged the assistance of Iraqi photographer by the name of Shauqat (who was a nephew of the photographer, Abdul-Karim Tiouti). The writer, [[Gertrude Bell]] also reports training a young boy in the process of developing photographs in Baghdad in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, G., ''The Letters of Gertrude Bell'',   Vol. 2 (1927), Project Gutenberg edition, 2004, [http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks04/0400461h.html Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; A second factor was that, in the 1920s, [[Faisal I of Iraq|King Faisal I]] arranged for a photographic portrait of his wife, thereby popularising photographic portraiture.&lt;ref&gt;"The First Photographers", Iraq National Library and Archives, [http://www.iraqnla-iq.com/fp/journal60/30.htm Online:] (translated from Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the years following the first world war, a number of photographers arrived in Iraq. Some of these were displaced Armenians, who had prior experience working with precision equipment, including cameras.&lt;ref&gt;El-Hagem B., "The Armenian Pioneers of Middle Eastern Photography," ''Palestine Studies,'' pp 22-26, [http://www.palestine-studies.org/sites/default/files/jq-articles/31_hage_1.pdf Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; These early photographers were mostly concerned with photographing military scenes and personnel. Around this time, a photographer named Tartaran, set up a studio at the entrance to the Mosul Elementary School.&lt;ref&gt;Alaq, A., "The Origins of Photography in Iraq", ''Arab Pictures'', 24 December 2015, [https://blog.arabpx.com/التصوير-الفوتوغرافي-في-التاريخ-والعر-2/ Online:] (translated from Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt; From there, local school children could observe the photographer at work. The influential Mosul photographer, [[Murad al-Daghistani]], who specialised in capturing the life and work of every-day people in Mosul, may have developed his passion for photography after watching Tartaran developing photographs in his dark-room. By the 1940s, the number of photographic studios had proliferated, especially in Mosul, Basra and Baghdad. Important 20th-century Iraqi photographers include: Amri Salim, Hazem Bak, Murad Daghistani, Covadis Makarian, Sami Nasrawi, Ahmed Al-Qabbani, Jassem Al-Zubaidi, Fouad Shaker and Rashad Ghazi amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;"The First Photographers", Iraq National Library and Archives, [http://www.iraqnla-iq.com/fp/journal60/30.htm Online:] (translated from Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest photographers used the medium to record an Iraqi way of life that was in danger of being lost as the country 'modernised'. The photographer, [[Latif al-Ani]], who is often described as the "father of Iraqi photography", was very much concerned with documenting cosmopolitan Iraqi life in the 1950s, as he saw it.&lt;ref&gt;Gronlund, M., "How Latif Al Ani Captured Iraq’s Golden Era through a Lens," ''The National,'' 6 May, 2018, [https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/art/how-latif-al-ani-captured-iraq-s-golden-era-through-a-lens-1.727789 Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid 20th-century, photography had become a popular medium for expressing social and political concerns. The artist, [[Jananne Al-Ani|Jananne al-Ani]] has explored the dichotomy of Orient/ Occident in her work, and has also used photography to question the wearing of the veil while Halim Alkarim uses blurred images to suggest the political instability of Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Dabbagh, S., "Photographing Against the Grain: A History of Photography," Part I, ''Contemporary Practices,'' vol. 5, pp 40-51 [http://www.contemporarypractices.net/essays/volumeixphotographing%20against%20the%20grain.pdf Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
[[File:Old city of Basra 1954.jpg|thumb|Shanashil (distinctive oriel window) in Basra, 1954]]
Modern architecture presented contemporary architects with a major challenge. A continuous tradition of both domestic and public architecture was evident, but failed to conform with modern materials and methods.&lt;ref&gt;Longrigg, S. and Stoakes, F., "The Social Pattern," in: Abdulla M. Lutfiyya and Charles W. Churchill (eds), ''Readings in Arab Middle Eastern Societies and Cultures,'' p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; From the early 20th-century, architecture employed new styles and new materials and public taste became progressively modern. The period was characterised by original designs produced by local architects, who had been trained in Europe, including: [[Mohamed Makiya]], Makkiyya al-Jadiri, Mazlum, Qatan Adani and [[Rifat Chadirji]].&lt;ref&gt;Munif, A.R., "The Monument of Freedom," ''The MIT Electronic Journal of Middle Easern Studies,'' Spring, 2007, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; 

Like visual artists, Iraqi architects searched for a distinctly national style of architecture and this became a priority in the 20th-century. Mohammed Makkiyya and Rifat Chadirji were the two most influential architects in terms of defining modern Iraqi architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Elsheshtawy, Y. (ed), ''Planning Middle Eastern Cities: An Urban Kaleidoscope'', Routledge, 2004, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; The architect, Chadirji, who wrote a seminal book on Iraqi architecture, called this approach ''international regionalism''.&lt;ref&gt;Pieri, C., "Baghdad 1921-1958. Reflections on History as a ”strategy of vigilance”," Mona Deeb, World Congress for Middle-Eastern Studies, Jun 2005, Amman, Jordan, Al-Nashra, vol. 8, no 1-2, pp.69-93, 2006; Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, p. 80; Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, pp 80-81&lt;/ref&gt; He explains: 

{{blockquote|"From the very outset of my practice, I thought it imperative that, sooner or later, Iraq create for itself an architecture regional in character yet simultaneously modern, part of the current   international avant-garde style." &lt;ref&gt;Cited in Pieri, C., " Modernity and its Posts in constructing an Arab capital.: Baghdad’s urban space and architecture, context and questions," ''Middle East Studies Association Bulletin,'' The Middle East Studies Association of North, 2009, Vol. 42, No. 1-2, pp.32-39, &lt;halshs-00941172&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;}}  

Architects sought an architectural language that would remind visitors of ancient Iraqi architectural history.&lt;ref name=archinform&gt;{{archINFORM|arch|10796}}&lt;/ref&gt; To that end, architects used Iraqi motifs in their designs&lt;ref&gt;Bernhardsson, M.T., "Visions of the Past: Modernizing the Past in 1950s Baghdad," in Sandy Isenstadt and Kishwar Rizvi, ''Modernism and the Middle East: Architecture and Politics in the Twentieth Century,'' University of Washington Press, 2008, p.92&lt;/ref&gt; and incorporated traditional design practices, such as temperature control, natural ventilation, courtyards, screen walls and reflected light within their work.&lt;ref name=archinform&gt;{{archINFORM|arch|10796}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architects also became designers who designed furniture and lighting with reference to the peculiarities of Iraqi climate, culture and material availability.&lt;ref&gt;Longrigg, S. and Stoakes, F., "The Social Pattern," in: Abdulla M. Lutfiyya and Charles W. Churchill (eds), ''Readings in Arab Middle Eastern Societies and Cultures,'' p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

As cities underwent a period of "modernisation" in the early decades of the 20th-century, traditional structures came under threat and subject to demolition.&lt;ref&gt;Pieri, C., "Baghdad 1921-1958. Reflections on History as a ”strategy of vigilance”," Mona Deeb, World Congress for Middle-Eastern Studies, Jun 2005, Amman, Jordan. Al-Nashra, vol. 8, no 1-2, pp.69-93, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The  [[mudhif]] (or reed dwelling) or the ''bayt'' (houses) with features such as the ''[[Mashrabiya|shanashol]]'' (the distinctive [[oriel window]] with timber lattice-work) and ''bad girs'' ([[Windcatcher|wind-catchers]]) were being lost with alarming haste.&lt;ref&gt;Selim, L., in correspondence with website by author of ''Memories of Eden,'' [https://memoriesofeden.wordpress.com/page/3/ Online:]; Tabbaa, Y. and Mervin, S., ''Najaf, the Gate of Wisdom,'' UNESCO, 2014, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

The architect, Rifat Chadirji along with his father, Kamil Chadirji, feared the [[vernacular architecture]] and ancient monuments would be lost to the new development associated with the oil boom in the mid-century.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; They documented the region photographically and in 1995, published a book entitled, ''The Photographs of Kamil Chadirji: Social Life in the Middle East, 1920-1940,'' which recorded the buildings and lifestyles of the Iraqi people.&lt;ref&gt;Chadirji, R., ''The Photographs of Kamil Chadirji: Social Life in the Middle East, 1920-1940,'' London, I.B. Tauris, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The artist, [[Lorna Selim]], who taught drawing at [[Baghdad University]]'s Department of Architecture, in the 1960s took her students to sketch traditional buildings along the Tigris and was especially interested in exposing young architects to Iraq's [[vernacular architecture]], alley-ways and historical monuments. The work of Selim and Chadirji inspired a new generation of architects to consider including traditional design features - such as Iraqi practices of temperature control, natural ventilation, courtyards, screen walls and reflected light - in their designs.&lt;ref&gt;Uduku, O. Stanek, L., al-Silq, G., Bujas, P. and Gzowska, A., ''Architectural Pedagogy in Kumasi, Baghdad and Szczecin,'' in: Beatriz Colomina and Evangelos Kotsioris''Radical Pedagogies,''  2015&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual arts===
During the first three decades of the 20th-century, there was little progress in art. Following World War One, a group of Polish officers, who had been part of the Foreign Legion,&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; arrived in Baghdad and introduced local artists to a European style of painting, which in turn fostered a public appreciation of art. The Institute of Fine Arts and the Fine Arts Society were established in 1940-41 &lt;ref&gt;Zuhur, D., ''Images of Enchantment: Visual and Performing Arts of the Middle East,'' American University in Cairo Press, 1998, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; and the Iraqi Artists' Society was founded in 1956, after which many exhibitions were mounted.&lt;ref&gt;Salīm, N., ''Iraq: Contemporary Art,'' Volume 1, Sartec, 1977, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, British rule was overthrown and [[Abdul Karim Qasim]] assumed power. This led to triumphant demonstrations and expressions of national pride. In early 1959, Qasim commissioned [[Jawad Saleem]] to create ''[[Freedom Monument (Baghdad)|Nasb al-Hurriyah]]'' (''Monument to Freedom,'')  to commemorate Iraq's independence.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, N., "Political Modernism, Jabrā, and the Baghdad Modern Art Group," ''CLCWeb: Comparative Literature and Culture,'' Vol. 12, No. 2, 2010, Online: https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1603&amp;context=clcweb, DOI: 10.7771/1481-4374.160; Floyd, T., "Mohammed Ghani Hikmat," [Biographical Notes] in: ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Islamic World,'' Online: http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/bios/Pages/Mohammed-Ghani-Hikmat.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Artists began to look to their history for inspiration and employed arabesque geometry and calligraphy as visual elements in their compositions, and referred to folk tales and scenes drawn from everyday life for artistic inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, pp 97-98&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, the Ba'ath Party mounted a program to beautify the city of Baghdad which led to numerous public art works being commissioned. Designed to instil a sense of national pride within the population, and to immortalise the leader, Saddam Hussein, these works provided work opportunities to the nation's architects, engineers and sculptors.&lt;ref&gt;al-Kalil, S., ''Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq.'' Berkeley, University of California Press, pp 72-75&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, artists showed a distinct preference for abstract works, which allowed them to evade censorship.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "The "Free" art of Occupation: Images for a "New" Iraq," ''Arab Studies Quarterly,'' Vol. 28, No. 3/4 2006, pp. 41-53&lt;/ref&gt; Baghdad is now dotted with monuments, including [[Al-Shaheed Monument]] and [[The Monument to the Unknown Soldier]] and the [[Victory Arch]], along with many smaller statues, fountains and sculptures; all constructed in the second half of the 20th-century, and showing increasing levels of abstraction over time. &lt;ref&gt;Brown, B.A. and Feldman, M.H. (eds), ''Critical Approaches to Ancient Near Eastern Art,''Walter de Gruyter, 2014 p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable feature of the Iraqi visual arts scene lies in artists' desires to link tradition and modernity in artworks. For a number of artists, the use of calligraphy or script has become an important part of integrating traditional artistic elements into an abstract artwork. In this way, the use of letters connects Iraqi artists with the broader [[hurufiyya movement]] (also known as the ''North African Lettrist Movement).'' The Iraqi artist, [[Madiha Omar]], who was active from the mid-1940s, was one of the pioneers of the hurufiyya movement, since she was the first to explore the use of Arabic script in a contemporary art context and exhibited hurufiyya-inspired works in Washington as early as 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  pp 115-119; Anima Gallery, "Madiha Omar," [Biographical Notes], Online: https://www.meemartgallery.com/art_resources.php?id=89; Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5; Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56; Dadi.

===Art groups===

The 20th-century Iraqi arts scene is notable for the number of different art groups or art movements that emerged in the post-colonial period. Each of these groups sought to forge a national art aesthetic that acknowledged Iraq's deep art heritage and incorporated it in contemporary artworks. Although there were tensions in the different visions of these groups,&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, p. 79 -80&lt;/ref&gt; collectively, they actively searched for new national vision which would enable the country to develop internally, as well as take its place on a world stage.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Ali, N. and Al-Najjar, D., ''We Are Iraqis: Aesthetics and Politics in a Time of War,'' Syracuse University Press, 2013, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; These groups include:

====''Al-Ruwad'' (The Pioneers) ====
: The Pioneers, Iraq's first modern art group, was formed by painter, [[Faeq Hassan|Faiq Hassan]] in the 1930s. This group was stimulated by the contact between Iraqi artists and European artists who had resided in Iraq during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, E., ''Memories of State: Politics, History, and Collective Identity in Modern Iraq,'' University of California Press, 2005, p. 82; Kohl, P.L. Kozelsky, M., Ben-Yehuda, N. (eds), ''Selective Remembrances: Archaeology in the Construction, Commemoration, and Consecration of National Pasts,'' University of Chicago Press, 2008, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; This group consciously developed a distinct Iraqi style by incorporating local phenomena and traditional village life into artworks. &lt;ref&gt; Kohl, P.L. Kozelsky, M., Ben-Yehuda, N. (eds), ''Selective Remembrances: Archaeology in the Construction, Commemoration, and Consecration of National Pasts,'' University of Chicago Press, 2008, pp 199-200&lt;/ref&gt; They rejected the artificial atmosphere of the artist’s studio and encouraged artists to engage with nature and traditional Iraqi life. They held their first exhibition in 1931.&lt;ref name="Sabrah,S.A 2010, pp 7-9"&gt;Sabrah,S.A. and Ali, M.," ''Iraqi Artwork Red List: A Partial List of the Artworks Missing from the National Museum of Modern Art, Baghdad,'' Iraq, 2010, pp 7-9&lt;/ref&gt; 

:This group was responsible for taking the first steps towards bridging the gap between modernity and heritage. Artists active in the group had been educated abroad, returned with a European aesthtic, yet wanted to paint local scenes and landscapes. Members included: [[Faeq Hassan]], [[Jawad Saleem]], Ismail al Sheikhli, Nadhim Ramzi and the architect-painter, Kamil Chadirji.&lt;ref&gt;Dabrowska, K. and Hann, G., ''Iraq: The Ancient Sites and Iraqi Kurdistan,'' Bradt Travel Guides, 2015, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The group continued to meet into the 1970s, although some of its high profile members withdrew from the group at different times. For instance, Faeq Hassan left the group in 1962. &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jawad Saleem]] and [[Shakir Hassan Al Said]] also broke away from the Pioneers and formed a different group in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Baram, A., ''Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq,1968-89,'' Springer, 1991, pp 69-70; Shabout, N.,"Shakir Hassan Al Said: Time and Space in the Work of the Iraqi Artist - A Journey Towards One Dimension," ''Nafas Art Magazine,'' May 2008, [https://universes.art/nafas/articles/2008/shakir-hassan-al-said/ Online:];  Lack, J., ''Why Are We 'Artists'?: 100 World Art Manifestos'', Penguin, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p. See section M52&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Jum'at al Ruwwad'' (The Avantgarde Group and later known as the Primitive Group)====
: Formed in 1950, the ''Jum'at al Ruwwad'' (Avantgarde Group) was inspired by Mespotamian art and Iraqi folklore. It later changed its name to the ''Primitive Group.''&lt;ref&gt; Baram, A., "Culture in the Service of Wataniyya: The Treatment of Mesopotamian Art," ''Asian and African Studies,'' Vol. 17, Nos. 1-3, 1983, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; The group was initially led by [[Faeq Hassan]] (Baghdad 1914-1992) and later by Isma'il al-Shaykhali (Turkey b. 1927). Artists in this group were inspired by ancient art of the 13th-century [[Baghdad School]].&lt;ref&gt;Wijdan, A. (ed.), ''Contemporary Art From The Islamic World,''Scorpion, 1989, p.166&lt;/ref&gt; Members of this group included: Ismail Al-Sheikhly, Issa Hanna, Zeid Salih, [[Mahmoud  Sabri]], Khalid Al Qassab, Dr Qutaiba Al Sheikh Nouri, Dr Nouri Mutafa Bahjat, Kadhem Hayder, [[Nuri al-Rawi]], Ghazi Al Saudi, Mahmoud Ahmed, Mohammed Ali Shakir, Sami Haqqi, Hassan Abid Alwan, [[Jawad Saleem]] and [[Lorna Selim|Lorna Saleem]].&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khamis, U. (ed.), "An Historical Overview: 1900s-1990s," in: ''Strokes of Genius: Contemporary Iraqi Art,'' London, Saqi Books, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

: Under B'ath rule, the group grew in prestige, and its members were frequently offered lucrative posts at the Ministry of Culture.&lt;ref&gt;Baram, A., ''Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq,1968-89,'' Springer, 1991, pp 70-71&lt;/ref&gt; This group was one of the more enduring, and continued meeting throughout the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, J. and Blair, S.S.

====''Jama’et  Baghdad  lil  Fen  al-Hadith'' (The  Baghdad  Modern  Art  Group)====
: Established in 1951, by [[Jawad Saleem]] and [[Shakir Hassan Al Said]], after they broke away from the Pioneers group,&lt;ref&gt;Baram, A., ''Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq,1968-89,'' Springer, 1991, pp 69-70; Shabout, N.,"Shakir Hassan Al Said: Time and Space in the Work of the Iraqi Artist - A Journey Towards One Dimension," ''Nafas Art Magazine,'' May 2008, [https://universes.art/nafas/articles/2008/shakir-hassan-al-said/ Online:];  Lack, J., ''Why Are We 'Artists'?: 100 World Art Manifestos'', Penguin, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p. See section M52&lt;/ref&gt; its aims were to reassert a national identity and use art to build a distinctive Iraqi identity which referenced its ancient heritage and tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrike al-Khamis, “An Historical Overview 1900s-1990s,” in: Maysaloun, F. (ed.), ''Strokes of Genius: Contemporary Iraqi Art,'' London:, Saqi Books, 2001, p. 25; Baram, A., ''Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq, 1968-89,'' Springer, 1991, pp 70-71&lt;/ref&gt; Hassan, the group's leader promoted the idea of ''istilham al-turath'' – "seeking inspiration from tradition" and wrote a manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "Jewad Selim: On Abstraction and Symbolism," in ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World,'' Online: http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/essays/Pages/Jewad-Selim,-On-Abstraction-and-Symbolism.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The co-founder, Hassan, wrote that, after the 1958 independence, artists were no longer responsible for preserving art and culture, instead the state was responsible for "turath" - safeguarding public taste; all that remained was for artists to absorb turath, free from historical responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Hassan, and others, believed that earlier artists, such as Jawad Saleem, had shouldered too great a burden of historical responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, pp 80-81&lt;/ref&gt; This group is credited with being the first Islamic art group to develop a local style.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

: While the Modern Art Group sought to connect with Islamic tradition, the group was distinguished from earlier art groups in that it sought to express modern life, while keeping tradition and heritage in perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Baram, A., ''Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq, 1968-89,'' Springer, 1991, pp 70-71&lt;/ref&gt; Key members of this group included: Nuri al-Rawi (b. 1925) who became the Minister for Culture; [[Jabra Ibrahim Jabra]] (1920-1994); [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]] (1929-2011); [[Khaled al-Rahal]] (1926-1987) and 'Atta Sabri (1913-1987), all of whom had been members from the group's foundation,&lt;ref&gt;Dougherty, B.K. and Ghareeb, E.A., ''Historical Dictionary of Iraq,'' Scarecrow Press, 2013, p. 495; Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Mahmud Sabri (1927-2012); Tariq Mazlum (b.1933), [[Nuri al-Rawi]] (b. 1925), Mahmoud Sabri (b. 1927), Ata Sabri (b.1913), and [[Kadhim Hayder]].&lt;ref&gt;Baram, A., ''Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq, 1968-89,'' Springer, 1991, p. 69; Dougherty, B.K. and Ghareeb, E.A., ''Historical Dictionary of Iraq,'' Scarecrow Press, 2013, p. 495; Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; The Baghdad Modern Art Group was moribund within a decade of its formation.&lt;ref name="Salīm, N. 1977, p. 7"&gt;Salīm, N., ''Iraq: Contemporary Art,'' Volume 1, Sartec, 1977, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; One of its co-founders, Jawad Saleem died in 1961, while the other co-founder, Shakir Hassan Al Said, suffered a mental and spiritual crisis as a result of the continuing turbulence and political instability following the 1958 revolution and the overthrow of the [[Hashemites|Hashemite]] monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Lack, J., ''Why Are We 'Artists'?: 100 World Art Manifestos'', Penguin, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p. See section M12&lt;/ref&gt;   

====''The Impressionists'' ====
: The Impressionists emerged in 1953, and organised around the artist, [[Hafidh al-Droubi]] (1914-1991), who had trained in London and had turned to impressionism and cubism.&lt;ref&gt;Dabrowska, K. and Hann, G., ''Iraq Then and Now: A Guide to the Country and Its People,'' Bradt Travel Guides, 2008, p. 278; Faraj, M., ''Strokes Of Genius: Contemporary Iraqi Art,'' London, Saqi Books, 2001, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the 20th century, a trend towards abstraction was evident amongst Iraqi artists, who wanted to embrace a more modern aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "Ghosts of Futures Past: Iraqi Culture in a State of Suspension," in Denise Robinson, ''Through the Roadbloacks: Realities in Raw Motion,'' [Conference Reader], School of Fine Arts, Cyprus University, November 23–25&lt;/ref&gt; However, al-Droubi pointed out that the Iraqi landscape, with its endless horizons, bright colours and open fields, was quite different to European landscapes and required different techniques. Unlike the art groups that preceded it, the Impressionists published no manifesto, and lacked the philosophical underpinnings evident in the Baghdad Modern Art Group or the New Vision.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Haydari, B., "Jawad Salim and Faiq Hasan and the Birth of Modern Art in Iraq," ''Ur,'' Vol. 4, 1985,  p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Al Mujadidin'' (The Innovationists)====
: Established in 1965, the ''Al Mujadidin'' was formed by a group of younger artists including: [[Salim al-Dabbagh]], [[Faeq Hassan]], [[Saleh al-Jumai'e]] and [[Ali Talib (artist)| Ali Talib]]. &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, pp 50-51; Dabrowska, K. and Hann, G., ''Iraq Then and Now: A Guide to the Country and Its People,'' Bradt Travel Guides, 2008, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; Group members were united along intellectual, rather than stylistic grounds. This group, which lasted only four years,&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; rebelled against traditional art styles and explored the use of new materials such as collage, aluminum and mono-type.&lt;ref&gt;Pocock, C., "The Reason for the Project Art in Iraq Today", in: Azzawi, D. (ed.), ''Art in Iraq Today'', Abu Dhabi, Skira and Meem, 2011, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; These artists exhibited distinct individual styles, but often chose war and conflict for their themes, especially the 1967 war.&lt;ref&gt;Bahrani, Z. and Shabout, N.M.,  ''Modernism and Iraq'', Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Art Gallery, Columbia University, New York, 2009, p.94&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Majmueat Al-Zawiya'' (The Corners Group)====
: Simply known as the al-Zawiya group, it was founded in 1967 by [[Faeq Hassan]], against a highly political backdrop.  This group wanted to use art to focus on social and political issues and to serve national causes. The group held just one exhibition in its inaugural year. &lt;ref&gt;"Profile: Faik Hassan," ''Al Jazeera'', 31 October, 2005, [https://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2005/10/20084101200333393.html Online"]; Bloom, J. and Blair, S.S. (eds), ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture,'' Vol. 1, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 141; Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Al-Ru’yah al-Jadida'' (The New Vision) ====
: Following decades of war and conflict, culminating in the July Revolution of 1958, artists began to feel free to find inspiration in a variety of sources.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Culture and Arts, ''Culture and arts in Iraq: Celebrating the Tenth Anniversary of the July 17–30 Revolution,'' The Ministry, Iraq, 1978, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The demise of the Baghdad Modern Art Group contributed to an environment where many artists worked individually, developing their own style, while still maintaining the broad trends of the Modern Baghdad Art group. Founded in 1968, by artists  [[Ismail Fatah Al Turk]]; Muhammed  Muhr al-Din, Hashimi al-Samarchi, Salih Jumai'e, Rafa al-Nadiri and [[Dia Azzawi]], &lt;ref&gt;Ghareeb, E.A. and Dougherty, B., ''Historical Dictionary of Iraq,'' Scarecrow Press, 2004, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; ''Al-Ru’yah al-Jadida'', represented a free art style where many artists believed that they needed to be true to their own era.&lt;ref name="Salīm, N. 1977, p. 7"/&gt; This group promoted the idea of freedom of creativity within a framework of heritage.&lt;ref name="Sabrah,S.A 2010, pp 7-9"/&gt; 

:The group's manifesto articulated the need for new and daring ideas, &lt;ref&gt;Ghareeb, E.A. and Dougherty, B., ''Historical Dictionary of Iraq,'' Scarecrow Press, 2004, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; and read in part:

{{Blockquote|"We believe that heritage is not a prison, a static phenomenon or a force capable of repressing creativity so long as we have the freedom to accept or challenge its norms... We are the new generation. We demand change, progression and creativity. Art stands in opposition to stasis. Art is continually creative. It is a mirror to the present moment and it’s the soul of the future."&lt;ref&gt;Saad, Q., "Contemporary Iraqi Art: Origins and Development," ''Scope'' vol. 3, November, 2008, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====''Jama’et al-Bu’d al Wahid'' ([[One Dimension Group]]) ====
: Founded in around 1971 by the Iraqi artist and intellectual, [[Shakir Hassan Al Said]], this group sought a new artistic identity, drawn from within Iraqi culture and heritage. The group's founder, Al Said, published a manifesto for the group in the Iraqi newspaper, ''al-Jamhuriyyah,''  in which he outlined his vision for a national art aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.,"Shakir Hassan Al Said: Time and Space in the Work of the Iraqi Artist - A Journey Towards One Dimension," ''Nafas Art Magazine,'' May 2008, [https://universes.art/nafas/articles/2008/shakir-hassan-al-said/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; The objectives of the One Dimension Group were multi-dimensional and complex. For al-Said, the one dimension was "eternity' - the relationship between the past and the present - the linking of Iraq's artistic heritage with modern abstract art. &lt;ref&gt;Lack, J., ''Why Are We 'Artists'?: 100 World Art Manifestos, Penguin, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p.

: In practice, this group blended Arabic motifs, especially calligraphy, albeit in a deconstructed form, and geometric shapes into their contemporary and abstract artworks. &lt;ref&gt;Lindgren, A. and Ross, S., ''The Modernist World,'' Routledge, 2015, p. 495; Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/; Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of this group was significant for the Calligraphic School of Art, which was based on the principles set out by Al-Said.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; The New Vision had a lasting impact on the pan-Arab region, through the art movement known as hurufiyya.&lt;ref&gt;Baram A., "Art With Local and Mesopotamian Components," in: ''Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba‘thist Iraq, 1968–89,'' [St Antony’s/Macmillan Series], London, Palgrave Macmillan, London, 1991, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

: Founding members of the One Dimension group include: [[Rafa al-Nasiri]], [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]], [[Nuri al-Rawi]], [[Dia Azzawi]], [[Jamil Hamoudi]], Hashem Samarchi (b. 1939), [[Hashem Muhammad al-Baghdadi|Hashem al-Baghdadi]] (1917-1973) and Saad Shaker (1935-2005).&lt;ref&gt;Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture'', Kassel University Press, 2017, p.117&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other 20th-century groups ====
Other art groups, including the ''Triangle Group'', the ''Shadows'' (formed by [[Ali Talib (artist)|Ali Talib]]) and the ''Academicians'' formed throughout the 1970s, but few lasted for more than a year or two.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Jamaat el-Jidaar'' (The Wall Group)====
: Established in 2007, this group of artists, many students at the Institute of Fine Arts, work on public projects in order to beautify the city of Baghdad. Paid a very modest stipend by the Ministry of Works, these artists have painted concrete slabs along the Tigris River, thereby transforming ruins left over from the revolution into modern works of art. (The slabs had previously served as protection from bombardment.) Although this group did little to develop a new aesthetic, it was able to provide employment and encouragement for young artists, who at that time were operating in a void since most of the artists of the preceding generation were living in exile.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "Ghosts of Futures Past: Iraqi Culture in a State of Suspension," in Denise Robinson, ''Through the Roadbloacks: Realities in Raw Motion,'' [Conference Reader], School of Fine Arts, Cyprus University, November 23–25, pp 95- 96; Farrell, S., "With Fixtures of War as Their Canvas, Muralists Add Beauty to Baghdad," ''New York Times,'' August 11, 2007, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/11/world/middleeast/11murals.html Online:]; Al-Ali, N. and Al-Najjar, D., ''We Are Iraqis: Aesthetics and Politics in a Time of War,'' Syracuse University Press, 2013 p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Artists active in ''Jamaat el-Jidaar'' include  Ali Saleem Badran and Gyan Shrosbree.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, B., "Artists resist pressure to be more sectarian," Associated Press and Charlotte Observer, July 26, 2008 [http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/article8995490.html#storylink=cpy Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:20160102-Tahrir square Baghdad.jpg|thumb|''Nasb al-Hurriyah'' [[Freedom Monument (Baghdad)]], a sculpture by [[Jawad Saleem]], 1959-1961]]
Iraq has produced a number of world-class painters and sculptors including [[Ismail Fatah Al Turk]] (1934-2008), Khalid Al-Jadir (1924-1990), and [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]].&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

[[Faeq Hassan]] (1914-1992), considered the founder of modern [[Plastic arts|plastic art]] in Iraq, was among several Iraqi artists who were selected to study art at the [[Ecole des Beaux-Arts]] before the [[Second World War]]. Hassan and the art group he founded formed the foundation of Iraq's strong 20th-century artistic tradition. Hassan founded the Institute of Fine Arts in Baghdad; many of Iraq's best known artists studied at this institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Profile: Faik Hassan - Al Jazeera English| accessdate = July 20, 2017| url = http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2005/10/20084101200333393.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jawad Saleem]] (b. 1919) is a painter and sculptor from Baghdad who (together with [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat|Mohammed Ghani]] (1929-2011) and [[Shakir Hassan Al Said|Hassan Shakir]]) (1925-2004), founded the influential Baghdad Modern Art Group in 1951. Saleem was commissioned to create the ''Monument of Freedom'' in Baghdad's city centre overlooking Liberation Square.&lt;ref name=kember&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| last = Kember| first = Pamela| title = Benezit Dictionary of Asian Artists| accessdate = July 20, 2017| date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saleem, and his student, [[Khaled al-Rahal]] have been described as "the two pillars of modern Iraqi art." &lt;ref&gt; Kahalid al-Kishtyan in 1981, cited in: Baram, A., "Culture in the Service of Wataniyya: The Treatment of Mesopotamian Art," ''Asian and African Studies,'' Vol. 17, Nos. 1-3, 1983, pp 265-309 and in Baram, A., ''Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq,1968-89,'' Springer, 1991, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dia Azzawi]]{{'}}s (b. 1939) work, described as contemporary art, includes references to [[Arabic calligraphy]], as well as [[Sumer]]ian and [[Assyria]]n art.&lt;ref name=kember/&gt; Azzawi has been the inspiration for many contemporary [[calligraffiti]] artists. 

[[Jamil Hamoudi]] (1924-2003) is both a painter and sculptor. Like Azzawi, Hamoudi also studied at the Baghdad School of Fine Art. He was interested in the [[cubist]] movement and in 1947, he self-identified with the [[surrealist]] movement, only to later distance himself citing "A dark, saturnine atmosphere emanated from [their canvases] the effect of which was to arouse a feeling of despair in human beings."  His paintings are brightly coloured and make use of shapes like circles, triangles and arches. For sculpture he frequently uses plaster, stone, wood, metal, copper, glass, marble, Plexiglas and ceramics.&lt;ref name=kember/&gt; In 1973 he was appointed to the directorship of the Fine Arts at the Ministry of Culture. 

Other notable artists include: [[Madiha Omar]] (1908–2005) who is regarded as a pioneer of the [[Hurufiyya movement]]; [[Shakir Hassan Al Said]] (1925-2004); [[Hassan Massoudy]] (b. 1944); [[Khaled al-Rahal]] (1926-1987); Saadi Al Kaabi (b 1937); Ismael Al Khaid (b. abt 1900) and [[Rafa al-Nasiri]] (b. 1940).

==Recent developments==

From 1969, the [[Arab nationalist]] political agenda of the [[Baath party|Ba'ath Party]] encouraged Iraqi artists to create work that would explain Iraq's new national identity in terms of its historical roots. The Iraqi Ministry of Culture is involved in efforts to preserve tradition Irai crafts like leatherworking, copper working, and carpet making.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;
[[File:SaddamStatue.jpg|thumb|The toppling of Saddam Hussein’s statue in [[Firdos Square]], Baghdad shortly after the Iraq War invasion. The removal of statues was part of a de-Ba'athification process]]
In 2003, during the overthrow of the Ba'ath government, key institutions, including the Pioneers Museum and the Museum of Modern Art, were looted and vandalised. Approximately 8,500 paintings and sculptures, especially were stolen or vandalised. The occupying forces insisted on a voluntary return of stolen artworks, a position which resulted in very few works being returned. A few independent galleries purchased artworks with a view to returning them once a suitable national museum could be established.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "The Preservation of Iraq's Modern Heritage in the Aftermath of the US Invasion of 2003," in: Elaine A. King and Gail Levin (eds), ''Ethics And the Visual Arts,'' New York, Allworth, 2006, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; A committee, headed by the respected artist and sculptor, [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]], was formed with the objective of recovering stolen artworks and proved somehwat more effective.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "The Preservation of Iraq's Modern Heritage in the Aftermath of the US Invasion of 2003," in: Elaine A. King and Gail Levin (eds), ''Ethics And the Visual Arts,'' New York, Allworth, 2006, pp 105 -120; Sabrah, S.A. and Ali, M.," ''Iraqi Artwork Red List: A Partial List of the Artworks Missing from the National Museum of Modern Art, Baghdad, Iraq, 2010, pp 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, some 1,500 artworks had been recovered, including important works, such as the statue, ''Motherhood'' by Jawad Saleem.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "The Preservation of Iraq's Modern Heritage in the Aftermath of the US Invasion of 2003," in: Elaine A. King and Gail Levin (eds), ''Ethics And the Visual Arts,'' New York, Allworth, 2006, pp 109-110&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2003, attempts at de-Ba'athification have been evident, with the announcement of plans to rid Baghdad's cityscape of monuments constructed during Saddam Husssein's rule. However, due to public pressure, plans have been made to store such monuments rather than arrange for their total destruction as had occurred in previous regimes. In addition, efforts are underway to erect new monuments which display significant figures from Iraq's history and culture. Recent developments also include plans to conserve and convert the former homes of Iraqi artists and intellectuals, inclduing the artist, Jawad Saleem, the poet, [[Muhammad Mahdi al-Jawahiri]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "Ghosts of Future Pasts: Iraq in a State of Suspension," in: ''Through the roadblocks: Realities in Raw Motion: Conference Reader,'' School of Fine and Applied Arts, Cyprus University, November 23–25, 2012, pp 89-102&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Iraq was again involved in violence as coalition forces entered the country. Many artists fled Iraq. The Ministry of Culture has estimated that more than 80 percent of all Iraqi artists are now living in exile.&lt;ref&gt;''Art AsiaPacific Almanac,'' Volume 4, Art AsiaPacific, 2009, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; The number of artists living abroad has created opportunities for new galleries in London and other major centres to mount exhibitions featuring the work of exiled artists from Iraqi and Middle Eastern. One such gallery is Soho's Pomegranate gallery established in the 1970s by the modernist Iraqi sculptor, Oded Halahmy, which not only mounts exhibitions, but also holds permanent collections of notable Iraqi artists. &lt;ref&gt;Hope, B., "Iraqi Art - in New York," ''New York Sun,'' March 3, 2006; Riccardo, B., Hamit, B. and Sluglett,P., ''Writing the Modern History Of Iraq: Historiographical And Political Challenges,''World Scientific, 2012  pp 490-93&lt;/ref&gt; 

Shortages of art materials were commonplace in the aftermath of war.&lt;ref&gt;Rellstab, F.H. and  Schlote, C., ''Representations of War, Migration, and Refugeehood: Interdisciplinary Perspectives,'' Routledge,  2014, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; However, visual artists such as [[Hanaa Malallah]] and [[Sadik Kwaish Alfraji ]] turned to "found objects" and incorporated these into their artworks.

Literature, art and architecture are cultural assets in Iraq. However, certain archaeological sites, and museums have been ransacked by Islamic terrorists, notably the ancient city of Nimrud, near Mosul;&lt;ref&gt;Shaheen, K., "Outcry over ISIS destruction of Ancient Assyrian site of Nimrud," ''The Guardian,'' March 7, 2015, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/06/isis-destroys-ancient-assyrian-site-of-nimrud Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; the  Adad and Mashqi gates at Nineveh; the ancient city of Hatra &lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, A., "Photos of Ancient Landmarks and World Heritage Sites Destroyed by Terrorist Groups," ''International Business Times,'' August 23, 2016, [https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/photos-ancient-landmarks-world-heritage-sites-destroyed-by-terrorist-groups-1577633 Online]&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations has described acts of cultural vandalism as ''war crimes.'' &lt;ref&gt;Cullinane, S., Alkhshali, H. and Tawfee, M., "Tracking a Trail of Historical Obliteration: ISIS Trumpets Destruction of Nimrud," ''CNN News,'' [https://edition.cnn.com/2015/03/09/world/iraq-isis-heritage/index.html Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, Islamic militants invaded the city of Mosul, destroying ancient monuments and statues, which they perceived to be blasphemous, and ransacked the History Museum. Mostafa Taei, a resident of [[Hamam al-Alil]] was jailed by [[ISIL]] when the terrorists took over his town in 2014. ISIL banned any images or artworks of the human form, and Taei says he was beaten when the group learned that he was still painiting. During this period, Taei's art "took a subversive turn, becoming a gruesome record of atrocities: decapitations, hangings, injured children and sobbing widows, all painted in an unschooled Naive art style." He also started to paint "martyr posters" that depict the soldiers and police officers who have died during the military operations to liberate [[Nineveh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = MacDiarmid| first = Campbell| title = Iraqi artist depicts life under ISIL| accessdate = July 20, 2017| url = http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/05/iraqi-artist-depicts-life-isil-170502162738617.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The art historian, Nada Shabout, notes that the destruction of Iraqi art in the period after 2003, assumed both tangible and intangible forms. Not only were the artworks and art institutions looted or destroyed, but art production also suffered from the lack of availability of art materials and the loss of many intellectuals, including artists, who were forced into exile. This contributed to an environment that failed to nurture artists, and saw young, upcoming artists operating in a void.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "Ghosts of Futures Past: Iraqi Culture in a State of Suspension," in Denise Robinson, ''Through the Roadbloacks: Realities in Raw Motion,'' [Conference Reader], School of Fine Arts, Cyprus University, November 23–25, pp 94-95&lt;/ref&gt;

Iraqi monumental artworks, both ancient and modern, feature prominently on banknotes of the [[Iraqi dinar]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5292">The '''Isthmo-Colombian Area''' is defined as a [[cultural area]] encompassing those territories occupied predominantly by speakers of the [[Chibchan languages]] at the time of European contact. It includes portions of the [[Central American]] [[isthmus]] like eastern [[El Salvador]], eastern [[Honduras]], Caribbean [[Nicaragua]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Panama]], and northern [[Colombia]].

==Cultural area study and theory==
It is a portion of what has previously been termed the [[Intermediate Area]], and was defined in a chapter by John W. Hoopes and Oscar Fonseca Z.&lt;ref&gt;Hoopes &amp; Fonseca 2003&lt;/ref&gt; in the 2003 book ''Gold and Power in Ancient Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia''.&lt;ref&gt;Quilter &amp; Hoopes 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept draws upon multidisciplinary perspectives, including linguistic reconstructions by Costa Rican anthropological linguist [[Adolfo Constenla Umaña]] and observations on [[Chibchan]] [[genetics]] by Costa Rican anthropological geneticist [[Ramiro Barrantes Mesén]]. It is currently being refined through ongoing studies of the [[linguistics]]. [[genetics]], [[archaeology]], [[art history]], [[ethnography]], and [[ethnohistory]] of this part of the Americas.  This includes more recent study of the relationships between this area and the [[Antilles]] within a [[Pan-Caribbean]] framework.

==Cultural area archaeology==
Archaeological knowledge of this area has received relatively little attention compared to its adjoining neighbors to the north and south, despite the fact that scholars such as [[Max Uhle]], [[William Henry Holmes]], [[C. V. Hartman]], and [[George Grant MacCurdy]] undertook studies of archaeological sites and collections here over a century ago that were augmented by further research by [[Samuel Kirkland Lothrop]], [[John Alden Mason]], [[Doris Zemurray Stone]], [[William Duncan Strong]], [[Gordon Willey]], and others in the early 20th century.  One of the reasons for the relative lack of attention is the relative absence of monumental architecture that is so characteristic of the neighboring culture areas of [[Mesoamerica]] and the [[Andes]] areas and a long history of [[ethnocentric]] perceptions by Western scholars of what represented [[civilization]] and what did not.

==Sites and landmarks==
There are a large number of sites with impressive platform mounds, plazas, paved roads, stone sculpture, and artifacts made from [[jade]], [[gold]], and [[ceramic]] materials.  These include [[Las Mercedes (Archaeological Site, Costa Rica)|Las Mercedes]], [[Guayabo de Turrialba]], [[Cutrís]], and [[Cubujuquí]] in Costa Rica and Pueblito ( in [[Tayrona National Natural Park]]) and [[Ciudad Perdida]] in the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Maria]] of [[Colombia]].  Research at sites such as [[Rivas, Costa Rica|Rivas]], Costa Rica helps to document the configurations of large settlements in the centuries prior to the [[Spanish Conquest]].  Some of the best-known Isthmo-Colombian sculptures are the [[stone spheres of Costa Rica]].  Another area that has provided valuable archaeological information is the [[Gran Coclé]] region in  [[Panama]], largely coinciding with the modern-day [[Coclé Province]].

==Indigenous peoples==
The Isthmo-Colombian Area was home to a wide variety of indigenous peoples. A large number of them were speakers of [[Chibchan languages]]. These include (but are not limited to) the [[Pech people|Pech]], the [[Rama people|Rama]], the [[Maleku people|Maleku]], the [[Bribri people|Bribri]], the [[Cabécar people|Cabécar]], the [[Guaymí people|Guaymí]], the [[Naso people|Naso]], the [[Kuna people|Kuna]], the [[Kogi people|Kogi]], the [[Motilon people|Motilon]], the [[U'wa people|U'wa]], and the [[Muisca people|Muisca]].

'''Jean-Henri Casimir Fabre''' (22 December 1823 – 11 October 1915) was a [[France|French]] [[naturalist]], [[entomologist]], and author known for the lively style of his popular books on the lives of insects.&lt;ref&gt;Going, Charles Buxton. (1935). "Henri Fabre, Educator and Naturalist". ''[[The American Scholar (magazine)|The American Scholar]]''. Vol. '''4''', No. 1, pp. 100-108&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Fabre was born on 22 December 1823 in [[Saint-Léons]] in [[Aveyron]], [[France]].
Fabre was largely an [[autodidact]], owing to the poverty of his family. Nevertheless, he acquired a primary teaching certificate at the young age of 19 and began teaching in Carpentras whilst pursuing further studies. In 1849, he was appointed to a teaching post in Ajaccio (Corsica), then in 1853 moved on to the lycée in Avignon.

[[File:Jean Henri Fabre Nadar.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Jean Henri Fabre by [[Nadar (artist)|Nadar]]]]
Fabre was a popular teacher, [[physicist]], [[chemist]] and [[botanist]]. However, he is probably best known for his findings in the field of entomology, the study of insects, and is considered by many to be the father of modern entomology. Much of his enduring popularity is due to his marvellous teaching ability and his manner of writing about the lives of insects in biographical form, which he preferred to a clinically detached, journalistic mode of recording. In doing so he combined what he called "my passion for scientific truth" with keen observations and an engaging, colloquial style of writing. Fabre (translated) wrote:

{{quote|Others again have reproached me with my style, which has not the solemnity, nay, better, the dryness of the schools. They fear lest a page that is read without fatigue should not always be the expression of the truth. Were I to take their word for it, we are profound only on condition of being obscure.}}
His ''Souvenirs Entomologiques'' is a series of texts on insects and arachnids. He influenced the later writings of [[Charles Darwin]], who called Fabre "an inimitable observer". Fabre, however, was a Christian who remained sceptical about Darwin's [[theory of evolution]], as he always held back from all theories and systems. His special force was exact and detailed observation, field research, always avoiding general conclusions from his observations, which he considered premature.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Susan T. (1976). "Reflections: Fabre and Darwin: A Study in Contrasts", ''[[BioScience]]''. Vol. '''26''', No. 6. pp. 395-398&lt;br&gt;- Yavetz, Ido. (1988). "Jean Henri Fabre and Evolution: Indifference or Blind Hatred?", ''History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences''. Vol. '''10''', No. 1. pp. 3-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of Fabre's most famous experiments, he arranged [[pine processionary]] caterpillars to form a continuous loop around the edge of a pot. As each caterpillar instinctively followed the silken trail of the caterpillars in front of it, the group moved around in a circle for seven days.&lt;ref&gt;Fabre, ''[http://www.efabre.net/chapter-iii-the-pine-processionary-the-procession The Life of the Caterpillar]'', Chapter III "The Pine Processionary: The Procession".&lt;/ref&gt; He further was able to forecast low atmospheric pressure events by observing the behaviours of the caterpillars.&lt;ref&gt;Fabre, ''[http://www.efabre.net/chapter-iv-the-pine-processionary-meteoroogy The Life of the Caterpillar]'', Chapter IV. "The Pine Processionary: Meteoroogy".&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on 11 October 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Henri Fabre Dies In France At 92; Noted Entomologist Was Described by Victor Hugo as "The Insects' Homer." |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1915/10/12/105042637.pdf |quote=Henri Fabre, the entomologist, is dead.

In the English speaking world, he became known through the extensive translations of his work by [[Alexander Teixeira de Mattos]], carried out from 1912 to 1922.

==Legacy==
The site of his birth, at St Léons, near [[Millau]] is now the site of [[Micropolis (La Cité des Insectes)|Micropolis]], a tourist attraction dedicated to popularising entomology and a museum on his life.

His last home and office, the [[Harmas de Fabre]] in [[Provence]] is similarly a museum devoted to his life and work. His insect collection is preserved in the [[Musée Requien]] in [[Avignon]].

The French post office commemorated Fabre in 1956 with a [[Philately|stamp]] depicting a portrait of him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bugsonstamps.com/france/france_03_fabre.htm Fabre commemorative postage stamp] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311041022/http://www.bugsonstamps.com/france/france_03_fabre.htm |date=11 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1951 biographical film ''[[Monsieur Fabre]]'' is devoted to his life.

''Blood of the Mantis'', a 2009 fantasy novel by the British author [[Adrian Tchaikovsky]] is dedicated to Fabre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tchaikovsky|first=Adrian |title=Blood of the Mantis|isbn=978-1-61614-199-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1zkmQgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fabre appears as the only major human character in a [[Caper story]] parody set on his property in [[Matthew Bennardo]]'s short story "The Famous Fabre Fly Caper".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grumpsjournal.com/jue4/stories/jue4-bennardo.html "The Famous Fabre Fly Caper"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kotlet schabowy''' {{IPA-pl|ˈkɔtlɛt sxaˈbɔvɨ|}} is a [[Polish cuisine|Polish]] variety of [[pork]] [[breaded cutlet]] coated with [[breadcrumbs]] similar to Viennese [[schnitzel]],&lt;ref name="Radetzky"&gt;Mieczysław Czuma, Leszek Mazan. ''Austriackie gadanie czyli encyklopedia galicyjska.'' 1998, page 465. Quote: "...jedna z najpopularniejszych potraw w całej byłej monarchii austro-węgierskiej, w wersji wieprzowej, jako kotlet schabowy - w całej Polsce. Pierwotna nazwa ''costelette alla milanese'', gdyż potrawa (smażona na maśle) pochodzi z Włoch. Zwrócił na nią uwagę w czasie kampanii włoskich dowódca wojsk austriackich w Lombardii i Wenecji sędziwy [[Joseph Radetzky|marszałek Radetzky]]."&lt;/ref&gt; but made of [[pork tenderloin]] (with the bone or without), or with [[pork chop]]. There's also the Polish variety of the [[chicken breast]] [[cutlet]] coated with breadcrumbs looking somewhat similar, or the [[turkey (food)|turkey]] cutlet coated with breadcrumbs (''kotlet z indyka'' {{IPA-pl|ˈkɔtlɛt z inˈdɨka|}}) made the same way.

The history of the Polish pork cutlet ''schabowy'' dates back to the 19th century. The collection of different recipes for cutlets such as ''schabowy'' is featured in an 1860 [[cookbook]] by [[Lucyna Ćwierczakiewiczowa]] entitled ''365 obiadów za pięć złotych'' (''365 Dinners for Five [[Polish złoty|Zloty]]''), but missing from the 1786 cookbook by Wojciech Wielądek called ''Kucharz doskonały'' (The Perfect [[Chef]]), thus suggesting, that the dish wasn't known (or at least, wasn't popular) before the 19th century. Typical ingredients include: [[Egg (food)|eggs]], [[lard]] or [[oil]], [[spices]], pork tenderloin with or without bone, breadcrumbs and [[flour]].

Pork tenderloin is cut into 1 inch slices and pounded with mallet until it becomes thinner and soft. It is marinated in milk and onions. Eggs and spices are combined on a separate plate and lightly beaten. The meat is dipped in flour, then in egg, and then covered in breadcrumbs. The oil is heated in a frying pan till it starts to sizzle and the meat is placed onto it, then turned over a couple of times. Served hot. ''Kotlet schabowy'' can be served with cooked potatoes, mashed potatoes, fried mushrooms, cooked vegetables (seared cabbage),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plmagazine.net/Kotlety_Schabowe_z_Kapusta.html Pork cutlets with cabbage (recipes)] at Pl magazine.net.&lt;/ref&gt; with salads or with [[coleslaw]].

[[File:Correggio,_madonna_col_bambino_tra_due_angeli_musicanti.jpg|thumb|350px]]
The '''''Madonna and Child with Two Musician Angels''''' is an oil on panel painting by [[Correggio]], now in the [[Uffizi]] in Florence. Some date it to 1514-15 but it is more commonly dated to 1515-16.

==History==
On the back of the painting is a 16th century monogram from the grand-ducal gallery in Florence, showing the identification number 2523, which does not feature in any of the lists of the gallery's holdings at that time. Though it cannot be clearly traced in any 17th century inventories, it was probably one of the works taken to [[Düsseldorf]] by [[Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici]] in 1691 on her marriage to [[John William, Elector Palatine]] and which (after John William's death in 1717) were brought back to Florence. The first official mention places the work in the inventory of the Gallerie fiorentine in 1798, in the Sala dei Maestri Italiani, where it remained until the mid 19th century. Many copies were commissioned from the 18th century onwards, attesting to its popularity. It was then attributed to [[Titian]], but [[Giovanni Morelli (art historian)|Giovanni Morelli]] reattributed it as an early work by a young Correggio - this became the dominant attribution, supported by "the minute technical execution and the clear and shining colours".

'''Megatext''' is a term used by scholars of [[speculative fiction]] that describes the elaborate fictional background, [[trope (literature)|trope]]s, images, and conventions that [[science fiction]] or [[fantasy]] narratives share.

This collective body of knowledge, utilized by writers and recognized by readers, was first described by [[Christine Brooke-Rose]] in her 1981 work, ''A Rhetoric of the Unreal: Studies in Narrative and Structure, Especially of the Fantastic''. Brooke-Rose builds on the culture or referential code first described by [[Roland Barthes]] in his work [[S/Z]]. 

Brooke-Rose describes a subconsciously familiar set of images, attributes and ideas that are shared within a particular genre. She cites examples in several genres, but goes into critical detail when considering [[Fantasy]], specifically the work of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].

[[Damien Broderick]] builds on this concept, separating Brooke-Rose's criticism of Tolkien and the specific exposition in Tolkien's work, from the megatext concept itself and introducing other comparable [[Science Fiction]] theories, such as the work of [[Gary K. Wolfe]] in ''The Known and the Unknown: the Iconography of Science Fiction'' (1979).  the "mega-text" in Broderick's description is much more clearly identified as a shared cultural between writer and reader.

In "The Evolving Megatext of Fantasy" [[Allen Stroud]] identifies the distinction between the author's specific fictional world mythos (macrotext or world bible) and the way in which the megatext of fantasy has changed, spreading out across multiple media to incorporate many shared concepts into hundreds of different fictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/35932186/The_Evolving_Megatext_of_Fantasy|website=Academia.edu|title=The Evolving Megatext of Fantasy|first=Allen|last=Stroud||access-date=October 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stroud notes that many of these concepts are washed of their cultural origins in their new forms, relying instead on more popular contemporary images and archetypes.

The '''Nimrud lens''', also called '''Layard lens''', is a 3000-year-old piece of [[rock crystal]], which was unearthed in 1850 by [[Austen Henry Layard]] at the [[Assyria]]n palace of [[Nimrud]], in modern-day [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name="bm"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=369215&amp;partid=1 |title=The Nimrud lens / the Layard lens |publisher=The British Museum |work=Collection database |accessdate=Oct 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=mCqLDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT35&amp;lpg=PT35&amp;dq=layard+lens+1850&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jZdkfLIvL6&amp;sig=a4v6JQNVJoOczRqiED78mlhfcNM&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJvZatsYrRAhUHCBoKHUdDA9g4ChDoAQhGMAo#v=onepage&amp;q=layard%20lens%201850&amp;f=false|title=The Limits of Resolution|last=Villiers|first=Geoffrey de|last2=Pike|first2=E.

==Description==
The [[lens (optics)|lens]] is slightly oval and was roughly [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|ground]], perhaps on a [[lapidary]] wheel.&lt;ref name="layard"/&gt; It has a [[Focus (optics)|focal point]] about {{convert|4.5|in|cm|disp=flip}} from the flat side and a [[focal length]] of about 12&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name="layard"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brewster&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Die Fortschritte der Physik | publisher = Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft |year=1852 | author = D. Brewster | title = On an account of a rock-crystal lens and decomposed glass found in Niniveh |language=German | url = https://books.google.com/?id=bHwEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA355&amp;dq=niniveh+lens }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bm/&gt; This would make it equivalent to a 3× magnifying glass. The surface of the lens has twelve cavities that were opened during grinding, which would have contained [[naphtha]] or some other fluid trapped in the raw crystal. The lens is said to be able to focus sunlight although the focus is far from perfect. Because the lens is made from natural rock crystal the material of the lens has not deteriorated significantly over time.&lt;ref name="layard"&gt;{{cite book|last=Layard|first=Austen Henry|title=Discoveries in the ruins of Nineveh and Babylon: with travels in Armenia |year=1853|publisher=G.P.

The Nimrud lens is on display in the [[British Museum]].

==Interpretation==
The function of the lens is not clear, with some authors suggesting that it was used as an optical lens and others suggesting a decorative function.

Assyrian craftsmen made intricate engravings and could have used a magnifying lens in their work.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/380186.stm|title=World's oldest telescope?|last=Whitehouse|first=David|date=July 1, 1999|work=BBC News|quote=If one Italian scientist is correct then the telescope was not invented sometime in the 16th century by Dutch spectacle makers, but by ancient Assyrian astronomers nearly three thousand years earlier. According to Professor Giovanni Pettinato of the University of Rome, a rock crystal lens, currently on show in the British museum, could rewrite the history of science. He believes that it could explain why the ancient Assyrians knew so much about astronomy.|accessdate=May 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discoverer of the lens noted that he had found very small inscriptions on Assyrian artefacts which he suspected had been achieved with the aid of a lens.&lt;ref name="layard"/&gt;

Italian scientist [[Giovanni Pettinato]] of the University of Rome has proposed that the lens was used by the [[Assyrian people|ancient Assyrians]] as part of a [[optical telescope|telescope]] and that this explains their knowledge of [[astronomy]] (see [[Babylonian astronomy]]).&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt; Experts on Assyrian [[archaeology]] are unconvinced, doubting that the optical quality of the lens is sufficient to be of much use. The ancient Assyrians saw the planet [[Saturn]] as a god surrounded by a ring of serpents, which Pettinato suggests was their interpretation of Saturn's rings as seen through a telescope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World's oldest telescope? |url=http://www.exn.ca/Stories/1999/06/29/63.asp |work=EXN Science Wire |date=June 29, 1999 |accessdate=2008-05-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091502/http://www.exn.ca/Stories/1999/06/29/63.asp |archivedate=Sep 29, 2007 |quote=Pettinato believes the lens was used by Assyrian astronomers as a telescope more than three thousand years ago. They saw more in the night sky than was possible with the naked eye alone. For example, the Assyrians saw the planet Saturn as a god surrounded by a ring of serpents. Pettinato says that would be a logical assumption to make if they saw Saturn's rings through a primitive telescope. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other experts say that serpents occur frequently in Assyrian mythology and note that there is no mention of a telescope in any of the many surviving Assyrian astronomical writings.&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt;

According to his book, Layard found the lens buried beneath other pieces of glass which looked like the enamel of an object, perhaps made of wood or ivory, which had disintegrated.&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt; The British Museum curator's notes propose that the lens could have been used "as a piece of inlay, perhaps for furniture" and that there is no evidence that the Assyrians used lenses for their optical qualities, e.g. for magnification, telescopy or for starting fire.&lt;ref name="bm" /&gt;

The '''Nsukka group''' is the name given to a group of [[Nigeria]]n artists who were associated with the [[University of Nigeria, Nsukka]] in the 1970s.  They are known, as a group, for working to revive the practice of ''[[uli (design)|uli]]'' and incorporate its designs into contemporary art using media such as [[acrylic paint]], [[tempera]], [[gouache]], pen and ink, [[pastel]], [[oil paint]], and [[watercolor]].  Although traditionally ''uli'' artists were female, many of the artists of the group were male.  Some were poets and writers in addition to being artists.

Among the artists associated with the group are:
* [[Tayo Adenaike]]
* [[El Anatsui]]
* [[Chike Aniakor]]
* [[Olu Oguibe]]
* [[Uche Okeke]]
* [[Ada Udechukwu]]
* [[Obiora Udechukwu]]

Positive feedback tends to cause [[Control theory#Stability|system instability]]. When the loop gain is positive and above 1, there will typically be [[exponential growth]], increasing [[oscillation]]s, [[Chaos theory|chaotic behavior]] or other divergences from [[wikt:equilibrium|equilibrium]].&lt;ref name=theorymodelling/&gt; System parameters will typically accelerate towards extreme values, which may damage or destroy the system, or may end with the system [[Latch (electronics)|latched]] into a new stable state. Positive feedback may be controlled by signals in the system being [[Filter (signal processing)|filtered]], [[Damping|damped]], or [[Maxima and minima|limited]], or it can be cancelled or reduced by adding negative feedback.

Positive feedback is used in [[digital electronics]] to force voltages away from intermediate voltages into '0' and '1' states. On the other hand, [[thermal runaway]] is a type of positive feedback that can destroy [[p–n junction|semiconductor junctions]]. Positive feedback in [[chemical reactions]] can increase the rate of reactions, and in some cases can lead to [[explosives|explosions]]. Positive feedback in mechanical design causes [[Tipping point (physics)|tipping-point]], or 'over-centre', mechanisms to snap into position, for example in [[Miniature snap-action switch|switches]] and [[locking pliers]]. Out of control, it can cause [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)|bridges to collapse]]. Positive feedback in economic systems can cause [[Economic boom|boom-then-bust cycles]].   A familiar example of positive feedback is the loud squealing or howling sound produced by [[audio feedback]] in [[public address|public address systems]]: the microphone picks up sound from its own loudspeakers, amplifies it, and sends it through the speakers again.

[[File:Positive Feedback Diagram (2).svg|thumb|[[Platelet]] clotting demonstrates positive feedback. The damaged blood vessel wall releases chemicals that initiate the formation of a blood clot through platelet congregation. As more platelets gather, more chemicals are released that speed up the process. The process gets faster and faster until the blood vessel wall is completely sealed and the positive feedback loop has ended.  The exponential form of the graph illustrates the positive feedback mechanism. ]]

== Overview ==
Positive feedback enhances or amplifies an effect by it having an influence on the process which gave rise to it. For example, when part of an electronic output signal returns to the input, and is in phase with it, the system [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] is increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Positive feedback|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/positive-feedback|work=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=15 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302160045/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/positive-feedback|archivedate=2 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feedback from the outcome to the originating process can be direct, or it can be via other state variables.&lt;ref name=theorymodelling/&gt; Such systems can give rich qualitative behaviors, but whether the feedback is instantaneously positive or negative in sign has an extremely important influence on the results.&lt;ref name=theorymodelling/&gt; Positive feedback reinforces and negative feedback moderates the original process. ''Positive'' and ''negative'' in this sense refer to loop gains greater than or less than zero, and do not imply any [[value judgement]]s as to the desirability of the outcomes or effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feedback|url=http://metadesigners.org/Feedback-Glossary|work=Glossary|publisher=Metadesigners Network|accessdate=15 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416183720/http://metadesigners.org/Feedback-Glossary|archivedate=16 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A key feature of positive feedback is thus that small disturbances get bigger. When a change occurs in a system, positive feedback causes further change, in the same direction.

=== Basic ===
[[File:Ideal feedback model.svg|thumb|A basic feedback system can be represented by this block diagram. In the diagram the + symbol is an adder and A and B are arbitrary [[causal system|causal]] functions.]]

A simple feedback loop is shown in the diagram.  If the loop gain AB is positive, then a condition of ''positive'' or ''regenerative'' feedback exists.

If the functions A and B are linear and AB is smaller than unity, then the overall system gain from the input to output is finite, but can be very large as AB approaches unity.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;Electronics circuits and devices second edition. Ralph J. Smith&lt;/ref&gt;  In that case, it can be shown that the overall or "closed loop" gain from input to output is:

:&lt;math&gt;G_c = A/(1-AB)&lt;/math&gt;

When AB &gt; 1, the system is unstable, so does not have a well-defined gain; the gain may be called infinite.

Thus depending on the feedback, state changes can be convergent, or divergent.  The result of positive feedback is to [[wikt:augment|augment]] changes, so that small perturbations may result in big changes.

A system in equilibrium in which there is positive feedback to any change from its current state may be unstable, in which case the system is said to be in an [[unstable equilibrium]]. The magnitude of the forces that act to move such a system away from its equilibrium are an [[increasing function]] of the "distance" of the state from the equilibrium.

Positive feedback does not necessarily imply instability of an equilibrium, for example stable ''on'' and ''off'' states may exist in positive-feedback architectures.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lopez-Caamal|first1=Fernando|last2=Middleton|first2=Richard H.|last3=Huber|first3=Heinrich|title=Equilibria and stability of a class of positive feedback loops|journal=Journal of Mathematical Biology|date=February 2014|pages=609–645|doi = 10.1007/s00285-013-0644-z|pmid=23358701|volume=68|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hysteresis ===
{{main|Hysteresis}}

[[File:Hysteresis sharp curve.svg|thumb|Hysteresis causes the output value to depend on the history of the input]]

[[File:Op-Amp Schmitt Trigger.svg|thumb|In a [[Schmitt trigger]] circuit, feedback to the non-inverting input of an amplifier pushes the output directly away from the applied voltage towards the maximum or minimum voltage the amplifier can generate.]]

In the real world, positive feedback loops typically do not cause ever-increasing growth, but are modified by limiting effects of some sort. According to [[Donella Meadows]]:

::"Positive feedback loops are sources of growth, explosion, erosion, and collapse in systems. A system with an unchecked positive loop ultimately will destroy itself. That’s why there are so few of them. Usually a negative loop will kick in sooner or later."&lt;ref name=meadows&gt;
Donella Meadows, [http://www.sustainabilityinstitute.org/pubs/Leverage_Points.pdf ''Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008160618/http://www.sustainabilityinstitute.org/pubs/Leverage_Points.pdf |date=2013-10-08 }}, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Hysteresis, in which the starting point affects where the system ends up, can be generated by positive feedback. When the gain of the feedback loop is above 1, then the output moves away from the input: if it is above the input, then it moves towards the nearest positive limit, while if it is below the input then it moves towards the nearest negative limit.

Once it reaches the limit, it will be stable. However, if the input goes past the limit,{{clarify|date=June 2012}} then the feedback will change sign{{dubious|date=June 2012}} and the output will move in the opposite direction until it hits the opposite limit. The system therefore shows [[bistability|bistable]] behaviour.

== Terminology ==
The terms ''positive'' and ''negative'' were first applied to feedback before [[World War II]]. The idea of positive feedback was already current in the 1920s with the introduction of the [[regenerative circuit]].&lt;ref name=mindell&gt;

{{harvtxt|Friis|Jensen|1924}} described regeneration in a set of electronic amplifiers as a case where ''the "feed-back" action is positive'' in contrast to negative feed-back action, which they mention only in passing.&lt;ref name="friis"&gt;{{Citation |last1=Friis |first1=H.

According to Black:
::"Positive feed-back increases the gain of the amplifier, negative feed-back reduces it."&lt;ref name=black&gt;
{{Citation |first=H. S. |last=Black |title=Stabilized feed-back amplifiers |journal=Electrical Engineering |volume=53 |issue= |pages=114–120 |date=January 1934 |doi=10.1109/ee.1934.6540374}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to {{harvtxt|Mindell|2002}} confusion in the terms arose shortly after this:
::"...Friis and Jensen had made the same distinction Black used between 'positive feed-back' and 'negative feed-back', based not on the sign of the feedback itself but rather on its effect on the amplifier’s gain. In contrast, Nyquist and Bode, when they built on Black’s work, referred to negative feedback as that with the sign reversed. Black had trouble convincing others of the utility of his invention in part because confusion existed over basic matters of definition."&lt;ref name=mindell/&gt;{{rp|page=121}}

[[File:Regenerartive Receiver-S7300056.JPG|thumb|right|A vintage style regenerative radio receiver. Due to the controlled use of positive feedback, sufficient amplification can be derived from a single [[vacuum tube]] or valve (centre).]]

[[Regenerative circuit]]s were invented and patented in 1914&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |inventor-last=Armstrong |inventor-first=E. H. |country-code=US |patent-number=1113149 |title=Wireless receiving system |date=1914}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the amplification and reception of very weak radio signals. Carefully controlled positive feedback around a single [[transistor]] amplifier can multiply its [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] by 1,000 or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kitchin|first=Charles|title=A Short Wave Regenerative Receiver Project|url=http://www.electronics-tutorials.com/receivers/regen-radio-receiver.htm|accessdate=23 September 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710100031/http://www.electronics-tutorials.com/receivers/regen-radio-receiver.htm|archivedate=10 July 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a signal can be amplified 20,000 or even 100,000 times in one stage, that would normally have a gain of only 20 to 50. The problem with regenerative amplifiers working at these very high gains is that they easily become unstable and start to oscillate. The radio operator has to be prepared to tweak the amount of feedback fairly continuously for good reception. Modern radio receivers use the [[superheterodyne]] design, with many more amplification stages, but much more stable operation and no positive feedback.

The oscillation that can break out in a regenerative radio circuit is used in [[electronic oscillator]]s. By the use of [[tuned circuit]]s or a [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] [[crystal]] (commonly [[quartz]]), the signal that is amplified by the positive feedback remains linear and [[Sine wave|sinusoidal]]. There are several designs for such [[harmonic oscillator]]s, including the [[Armstrong oscillator]], [[Hartley oscillator]], [[Colpitts oscillator]], and the [[Wien bridge oscillator]]. They all use positive feedback to create oscillations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sinewave oscillators|url=http://www.educypedia.be/electronics/analogosciltypes.htm|work=EDUCYPEDIA - electronics|accessdate=23 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100927094330/http://www.educypedia.be/electronics/analogosciltypes.htm|archivedate=27 September 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many electronic circuits, especially amplifiers, incorporate [[negative feedback]]. This reduces their gain, but improves their linearity, [[input impedance]], [[output impedance]], and [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], and stabilises all of these parameters, including the closed-loop gain. These parameters also become less dependent on the details of the amplifying device itself, and more dependent on the feedback components, which are less likely to vary with manufacturing tolerance, age and temperature. The difference between positive and negative feedback for [[Alternating current|AC]] signals is one of [[Phase (waves)|phase]]: if the signal is fed back out of phase, the feedback is negative and if it is in phase the feedback is positive. One problem for amplifier designers who use negative feedback is that some of the components of the circuit will introduce [[Phase (waves)#Phase shift|phase shift]] in the feedback path. If there is a frequency (usually a high frequency) where the phase shift reaches 180°, then the designer must ensure that the amplifier gain at that frequency is very low (usually by [[low-pass filter]]ing). If the [[loop gain]] (the product of the amplifier gain and the extent of the positive feedback) at any frequency is greater than one, then the amplifier will oscillate at that frequency ([[Barkhausen stability criterion]]). Such oscillations are sometimes called [[parasitic oscillation]]s. An amplifier that is stable in one set of conditions can break into parasitic oscillation in another. This may be due to changes in temperature, supply voltage, adjustment of front-panel controls, or even the proximity of a person or other conductive item.

Amplifiers may oscillate gently in ways that are hard to detect without an [[oscilloscope]], or the oscillations may be so extensive that only a very distorted or no required signal at all gets through, or that damage occurs. Low frequency parasitic oscillations have been called 'motorboating' due to the similarity to the sound of a low-revving exhaust note.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Self|first=Douglas|title=Audio Power Amplifier Design Handbook|year=2009|publisher=Focal Press|isbn=978-0-240-52162-6|pages=254–255|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qpmi4ia2nhcC&amp;pg=PA254&amp;lpg=PA254#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140129111458/http://books.google.com/books?id=Qpmi4ia2nhcC&amp;pg=PA254&amp;lpg=PA254#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archivedate=2014-01-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Smitt hysteresis graph.svg|thumb|right|The effect of using a Schmitt trigger (B) instead of a comparator (A)]]

Many common [[Digital electronics|digital electronic]] circuits employ positive feedback. While normal simple boolean [[logic gate]]s usually rely simply on gain to push digital signal voltages away from intermediate values to the values that are meant to represent [[Boolean logic|boolean]] '0' and '1', but many more complex gates use feedback. When an input voltage is expected to vary in an [[Analogue electronics|analogue]] way, but sharp thresholds are required for later digital processing, the [[Schmitt trigger]] circuit uses positive feedback to ensure that if the input voltage creeps gently above the threshold, the output is forced smartly and rapidly from one logic state to the other. One of the corollaries of the Schmitt trigger's use of positive feedback is that, should the input voltage move gently down again past the same threshold, the positive feedback will hold the output in the same state with no change. This effect is called [[hysteresis]]: the input voltage has to drop past a different, lower threshold to 'un-latch' the output and reset it to its original digital value. By reducing the extent of the positive feedback, the hysteresis-width can be reduced, but it can not entirely be eradicated. The Schmitt trigger is, to some extent, a [[Latch (electronics)|latching]] circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CMOS Schmitt Trigger—A Uniquely Versatile Design Component|url=http://www.fairchildsemi.com/an/AN/AN-140.pdf|work=Fairchild Semiconductor Application Note 140|publisher=Fairchild Semiconductors|accessdate=29 September 2010|year=1975|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122185614/http://fairchildsemi.com/an/AN/AN-140.pdf|archivedate=22 November 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Positive feedback bistable switch.svg|thumb|Positive feedback is a mechanism by which an output is enhanced, such as protein levels. However, in order to avoid any fluctuation in the protein level, the mechanism is inhibited stochastically (I), therefore when the concentration of the activated protein (A) is past the threshold ([I]), the loop mechanism is activated and the concentration of A increases exponentially if d[A]=k [A]]]

An electronic [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]], or "latch", or "bistable [[multivibrator]]", is a circuit that due to high positive feedback is not stable in a balanced or intermediate state. Such a bistable circuit is the basis of one [[bit]] of electronic [[Computer memory|memory]].  The flip-flop uses a pair of amplifiers, transistors, or  logic gates connected to each other so that positive feedback maintains the state of the circuit in one of two unbalanced stable states after the input signal has been removed, until a suitable alternative signal is applied to change the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Strandh|first=Robert|title=Latches and flip-flops|url=http://www.labri.fr/perso/strandh/Teaching/AMP/Common/Strandh-Tutorial/flip-flops.html|publisher=Laboratoire Bordelais de Recherche en Informatique|accessdate=4 November 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716085637/http://www.labri.fr/perso/strandh/Teaching/AMP/Common/Strandh-Tutorial/flip-flops.html|archivedate=16 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer [[random access memory]] (RAM) can be made in this way, with one latching circuit for each bit of memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wayne|first=Storr|title=Sequential Logic Basics: SR Flip-Flop|url=http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/sequential/seq_1.html|publisher=Electronics-Tutorials.ws|accessdate=29 September 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916114700/http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/sequential/seq_1.html|archivedate=16 September 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thermal runaway]] occurs in electronic systems because some aspect of a circuit is allowed to pass more current when it gets hotter, then the hotter it gets, the more current it passes, which heats it some more and so it passes yet more current. The effects are usually catastrophic for the device in question. If devices have to be used near to their maximum power-handling capacity, and thermal runaway is possible or likely under certain conditions, improvements can usually be achieved by careful design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sharma|first=Bijay Kumar|title=Analog Electronics Lecture 4 Part C RC coupled Amplifier Design Procedure|url=http://cnx.org/content/m31058/latest/|accessdate=29 September 2010|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sound recording and reproduction|Audio]] and [[video]] systems can demonstrate positive feedback. If a [[microphone]] picks up the amplified sound output of [[loudspeaker]]s in the same circuit, then howling and screeching sounds of [[audio feedback]] (at up to the maximum power capacity of the amplifier) will be heard, as random noise is re-amplified by positive feedback and [[Filter (signal processing)|filtered]] by the characteristics of the audio system and the room.

===Audio and live music===
[[Audio feedback]] (also known as acoustic feedback, simply as feedback, or the Larsen effect) is a special kind of positive feedback which occurs when a sound loop exists between an audio input (for example, a [[microphone]] or [[guitar pickup]]) and an audio output (for example, a loudly-amplified [[loudspeaker]]). In this example, a signal received by the microphone is [[Amplifier|amplified]] and passed out of the loudspeaker. The sound from the loudspeaker can then be received by the microphone again, amplified further, and then passed out through the loudspeaker again.  The [[frequency]] of the resulting sound is determined by resonance frequencies in the microphone, amplifier, and loudspeaker, the acoustics of the room, the directional pick-up and emission patterns of the microphone and loudspeaker, and the distance between them. For small [[PA system]]s the sound is readily recognized as a loud squeal or screech.

Feedback is almost always considered undesirable when it occurs with a singer's or public speaker's microphone at an event using a [[sound reinforcement system]] or [[PA system]]. [[Audio engineer]]s use various electronic devices, such as equalizers and, since the 1990s, automatic feedback detection devices to prevent these unwanted squeals or screeching sounds, which detract from the audience's enjoyment of the event. On the other hand, since the 1960s, [[electric guitar]] players in [[rock music]] bands using loud [[guitar amplifier]]s and [[distortion (music)|distortion]] effects have intentionally created guitar feedback to create a desirable musical effect.  "I Feel Fine" by the Beatles marks one of the earliest examples of the use of feedback as a recording effect in popular music. It starts with a single, percussive [[audio feedback|feedback]] note produced by plucking the A string on Lennon's guitar. Artists such as the Kinks and the Who had already used feedback live, but Lennon remained proud of the fact that the Beatles were perhaps the first group to deliberately put it on vinyl. In one of his last interviews, he said, "I defy anybody to find a record—unless it's some old blues record in 1922—that uses feedback that way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sheff |first=David |date=2000 |title=All We Are Saying |location=New York, New York |publisher=St. Martin's Press |page=173 |isbn=978-0-312-25464-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principles of audio feedback were first discovered by Danish scientist [[Søren Absalon Larsen]]. Microphones are not the only transducers subject to this effect. [[Phonograph|Record deck]] [[Magnetic cartridge|pickup cartridges]] can do the same, usually in the low frequency range below about 100&amp;nbsp;Hz, manifesting as a low rumble. [[Jimi Hendrix]] was an innovator in the intentional use of guitar feedback in his [[guitar solo]]s to create unique sound effects. He helped develop the controlled and musical use of audio feedback in [[electric guitar]] playing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Shadwick|first = Keith|title = Jimi Hendrix, Musician|publisher = [[Backbeat Books]]|year = 2003|page = 92|isbn = 978-0-87930-764-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[Brian May]] was a famous proponent of the technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=May|first=Brian|title=Burns Brian May Tri-Sonic Pickups|url=http://www.brianmayguitars.co.uk/accessories/19|publisher=House Music &amp; Duck Productions|accessdate=2 February 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120063431/http://brianmayguitars.co.uk/accessories/19|archivedate=20 November 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Adam Savage HOPE.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Video feedback]].]]

===Video===
Similarly, if a [[video camera]] is pointed at a [[Video monitor|monitor]] screen that is displaying the camera's own signal, then repeating patterns can be formed on the screen by positive feedback. This video feedback effect was used in the opening sequences to the [[Doctor Who (season 1)|first]] [[Doctor Who (season 10)|ten]] series of the television program ''[[Doctor Who]]''.

=== Switches ===
In [[electrical switch]]es, including [[bimetallic strip]] based thermostats, the switch usually has hysteresis in the switching action. In these cases hysteresis is mechanically achieved via positive feedback within a tipping point mechanism. The positive feedback action minimises the length of time arcing occurs for during the switching and also holds the contacts in an open or closed state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Positive Feedback and Bistable Systems|url=http://sbw.kgi.edu/sbwwiki/_media/sysbio/labmembers/hsauro/bistablesystems.pdf|publisher=University of Washington|quote=* Non-Hysteretic Switches, Memoryless Switches: These systems have no memory, that is, once the input signal is removed, the system returns to its original state. * Hysteretic Switches, Bistability: Bistable systems, in contrast, have memory. That is, when switched to one state or another, these systems remain in that state unless forced to change back. The light switch is a common example of a bistable system from everyday life. All bistable systems are based around some form of positive feedback loop.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413020657/http://sbw.kgi.edu/sbwwiki/_media/sysbio/labmembers/hsauro/bistablesystems.pdf|archivedate=2015-04-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In biology ===

[[File:Positive Feedback- Childbirth (1).svg|thumb|Positive feedback is the amplification of a body’s response to a stimulus. For example, in childbirth, when the head of the fetus pushes up against the cervix (1) it stimulates a nerve impulse from the cervix to the brain (2). When the brain is notified, it signals the pituitary gland to release a hormone called [[oxytocin]](3). Oxytocin is then carried via the bloodstream to the [[uterus]] (4) causing contractions, pushing the fetus towards the cervix eventually inducing childbirth.]]

==== In physiology ====

A number of examples of positive feedback systems may be found in [[physiology]].
* One example is the onset of [[Contraction (childbirth)|contractions]] in [[childbirth]], known as the [[Ferguson reflex]]. When a contraction occurs, the hormone [[oxytocin]] causes a nerve stimulus, which stimulates the [[hypothalamus]] to produce more oxytocin, which increases uterine contractions. This results in contractions increasing in [[amplitude]] and [[frequency]].&lt;ref name=Guyton1991&gt;Guyton, Arthur C. (1991) ''Textbook of Medical Physiology''. (8th ed). Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders. {{ISBN|0-7216-3994-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pages=924–925}}
* Another example is the process of [[Coagulation|blood clotting]]. The loop is initiated when injured tissue releases signal chemicals that activate platelets in the blood. An activated platelet releases chemicals to activate more platelets, causing a rapid cascade and the formation of a blood clot.&lt;ref name=Guyton1991/&gt;{{rp|pages=392–394}}
* [[Lactation]] also involves positive feedback in that as the baby suckles on the nipple there is a nerve response into the spinal cord and up into the hypothalamus of the brain, which then stimulates the [[pituitary]] gland to produce more [[prolactin]] to produce more milk.&lt;ref name=Guyton1991/&gt;{{rp|page=926}}
* A spike in [[estrogen]] during the [[follicular phase]] of the menstrual cycle causes [[ovulation]].&lt;ref name=Guyton1991/&gt;{{rp|page=907}}
* The generation of [[nerve signal]]s is another example, in which the membrane of a nerve fibre causes slight leakage of sodium ions through sodium channels, resulting in a change in the membrane potential, which in turn causes more opening of channels, and so on. So a slight initial leakage results in an explosion of sodium leakage which creates the nerve [[action potential]].&lt;ref name=Guyton1991/&gt;{{rp|page=59}}
* In [[excitation–contraction coupling]] of the heart, an increase in intracellular calcium ions to the cardiac myocyte is detected by ryanodine receptors in the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum which transport calcium out into the cytosol in a positive feedback physiological response.

In most cases, such feedback loops culminate in counter-signals being released that suppress or break the loop. Childbirth contractions stop when the baby is out of the mother's body. Chemicals break down the blood clot. Lactation stops when the baby no longer nurses.&lt;ref name=Guyton1991/&gt;

==== In gene regulation ====

Positive feedback is a well studied phenomenon in gene regulation, where it is most often associated with [[bistability]]. Positive feedback occurs when a gene activates itself directly or indirectly via a double negative feedback loop. Genetic engineers have constructed and tested simple positive feedback networks in bacteria to demonstrate the concept of bistability.&lt;ref name=Hasty2002/&gt; A classic example of positive feedback is the [[lac operon]] in ''E. coli''. Positive feedback plays an integral role in cellular differentiation, development, and cancer progression, and therefore, positive feedback in gene regulation can have significant physiological consequences. Random motions in [[molecular dynamics]] coupled with positive feedback can trigger interesting effects, such as create population of phenotypically different cells from the same parent cell.&lt;ref name=Veening2008/&gt; This happens because noise can become amplified by positive feedback. Positive feedback can also occur in other forms of [[cell signaling]], such as enzyme kinetics or metabolic pathways.&lt;ref name=Christoph2001/&gt;

==== In evolutionary biology ====

Positive feedback loops have been used to describe aspects of the dynamics of change in biological [[evolution]].  For example, beginning at the macro level, [[Alfred J. Lotka]] (1945) argued that the evolution of the species was most essentially a matter of selection that fed back energy flows to capture more and more energy for use by living systems.&lt;ref name=Lotka1945/&gt;  At the human level, [[Richard D. Alexander]] (1989) proposed that social competition between and within human groups fed back to the selection of intelligence thus constantly producing more and more refined human intelligence.&lt;ref name=Alexander1989/&gt; [[Bernard Crespi|Crespi]] (2004) discussed several other examples of positive feedback loops in evolution.&lt;ref name=Crespi2004/&gt;  The analogy of [[Evolutionary arms race]]s provide further examples of positive feedback in biological systems.&lt;ref name=Blindwatchmaker/&gt;

[[File:Phanerozoic Biodiversity.svg|300px|right|thumb|During the Phanerozoic the [[biodiversity]] shows a steady but not monotonic increase from near zero to several thousands of genera.]]
It has been shown that changes in [[biodiversity]] through the [[Phanerozoic]] correlate much better with hyperbolic model (widely used in [[demography]] and [[macrosociology]]) than with [[Exponential growth|exponential]] and [[Logistic function|logistic]] models (traditionally used in [[population biology]] and extensively applied to [[fossil]] [[biodiversity]] as well). The latter models imply that changes in diversity are guided by a first-order positive feedback (more ancestors, more descendants) and/or a [[negative feedback]] arising from resource limitation. Hyperbolic model implies a second-order positive feedback. The hyperbolic pattern of the [[world population growth]] has been demonstrated (see below) to arise from a second-order positive feedback between the population size and the rate of [[technological growth]]. The hyperbolic character of biodiversity growth can be similarly accounted for by a positive feedback between the diversity and community structure complexity. It has been suggested that the similarity between the curves of [[biodiversity]] and human population probably comes from the fact that both are derived from the interference of the hyperbolic trend (produced by the positive feedback) with cyclical and stochastic dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Markov A., [[Korotayev]] A.[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B83WC-4N0HJMK-2&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=74a80d7c55ff987c9fc8d9c7963feab9 "Phanerozoic marine biodiversity follows a hyperbolic trend."

==== Immune system ====

A [[cytokine storm]], or '''hypercytokinemia''' is a potentially fatal immune reaction consisting of a positive feedback loop between [[cytokine]]s and [[immune cell]]s, with highly elevated levels of various cytokines.&lt;ref name="osterholm"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Osterholm | first = Michael T. | author-link = Michael Osterholm |title = Preparing for the Next Pandemic | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 352 | issue = 18 | pages = 1839–1842 | date = 2005-05-05 | url = | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp058068   | pmid = 15872196 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.608.6200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In normal immune function, positive feedback loops can be utilized to enhance the action of B lymphocytes. When a B cell binds its antibodies to an antigen and becomes activated, it begins releasing antibodies and secreting a complement protein called C3. Both C3 and a B cell's antibodies can bind to a pathogen, and when a B cell has its antibodies bind to a pathogen with C3, it speeds up that B cell's secretion of more antibodies and more C3, thus creating a positive feedback loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paul|first=William E.|title=Infectious Diseases and the Immune System|journal=Scientific American|date=September 1993|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cell death ====

[[Apoptosis]] is a [[caspase]]-mediated process of cellular death, whose aim is the removal of long-lived or damaged cells. A failure of this process has been implicated in prominent conditions such as [[cancer]] or [[Parkinson's disease]]. The very core of the apoptotic process is the auto-activation of caspases, which may be modeled via a positive-feedback loop. This positive feedback exerts an auto-activation of the [[effector caspase]] by means of intermediate caspases. When isolated from the rest of apoptotic pathway, this positive-feedback presents only one stable steady state, regardless of the number of intermediate activation steps of the effector caspase.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; When this core process is complemented with inhibitors and enhancers of caspases effects, this process presents bistability, thereby modeling the alive and dying states of a cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eissing|first=Thomas|title=Bistability analyses of a caspase activation model for receptor-induced apoptosis|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry|date=2014|pages=36892–36897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In psychology ===

Winner (1996) described gifted children as driven by positive feedback loops involving setting their own learning course, this feeding back satisfaction, thus further setting their learning goals to higher levels and so on.&lt;ref name=Winner1996/&gt;  Winner termed this positive feedback loop as a "rage to master."  Vandervert (2009a, 2009b) proposed that the [[child prodigy]] can be explained in terms of a positive feedback loop between the output of thinking/performing in [[working memory]], which then is fed to the [[cerebellum]] where it is streamlined, and then fed back to working memory thus steadily increasing the quantitative and qualitative output of working memory.&lt;ref name=Vandervert2009a/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vandervert2009b/&gt;  Vandervert also argued that this working memory/cerebellar positive feedback loop was responsible for [[language]] evolution in working memory.

=== In economics ===

====Markets with social influence====
Product recommendations and information about past purchases have been shown to influence consumers choices significantly whether it is for music, movie, book, technological, and other type of products. Social influence often induces a rich-get-richer phenomenon ([[Matthew effect]]) where popular products tend to become even more popular.&lt;ref name="altszyler2017"&gt;{{cite journal | title= Transient dynamics in trial-offer markets with social influence: Trade-offs between appeal and quality. | author1= Altszyler, E | author2= Berbeglia, F. | author3= Berbeglia, G. | author4= Van Hentenryck, P. | journal= PLoS ONE | year= 2017 | volume= 12 | issue= 7 | df= | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0180040 |pmid = 28746334| pmc= 5528888 | page=e0180040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Market dynamics====
According to the theory of [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] advanced by [[George Soros]], price changes are driven by a positive feedback process whereby investors' expectations are influenced by price movements so their behaviour acts to reinforce movement in that direction until it becomes unsustainable, whereupon the feedback drives prices in the opposite direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Behavioural Technical Analysis |first=Paul V. |last=Azzopardi |publisher=Harriman House Limited |year=2010 |page=116 |isbn=9780857190680 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=04Ay8qviuwgC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;lpg=PA116 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329103058/https://books.google.com/books?id=04Ay8qviuwgC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;source=bl&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;f=false |archivedate=2017-03-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Systemic risk ====

[[Systemic risk]] is the risk that an amplification or leverage or positive feedback process presents to a system. This is usually unknown, and under certain conditions this process can amplify exponentially and rapidly lead to destructive or chaotic behavior.  A [[Ponzi scheme]] is a good example of a positive-feedback system: funds from new investors are used to pay out unusually high returns, which in turn attract more new investors, causing rapid growth toward collapse. [[W. Brian Arthur]] has also studied and written on positive feedback in the economy (e.g. W. Brian Arthur, 1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arthur | first1 = W. Brian | year = 1990 | title = Positive Feedbacks in the Economy | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 262 | issue = 2| page = 80 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hyman Minsky]] proposed a theory that certain credit expansion practices could make a market economy into "a deviation amplifying system" that could suddenly collapse,&lt;ref name="working_paper"&gt;[http://www.levy.org/pubs/wp74.pdf The Financial Instability Hypothesis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009190421/http://www.levy.org/pubs/wp74.pdf |date=2009-10-09 }} by Hyman P. Minsky, Working Paper No. 74, May 1992, pp. 6–8&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes called a "[[Minsky moment]]".

Simple systems that clearly separate the inputs from the outputs are not prone to [[systemic risk]].  This risk is more likely as the complexity of the system increases, because it becomes more difficult to see or analyze all the possible combinations of variables in the system even under careful stress testing conditions.  The more efficient a complex system is, the more likely it is to be prone to systemic risks, because it takes only a small amount of deviation to disrupt the system.  Therefore, well-designed complex systems generally have built-in features to avoid this condition, such as a small amount of friction, or resistance, or inertia, or time delay to decouple the outputs from the inputs within the system. These factors amount to an inefficiency, but they are necessary to avoid instabilities.

The [[2010 Flash Crash]] incident was blamed on the practice of [[high-frequency trading]] (HFT),&lt;ref name="flashreport"&gt;{{cite web|title=Findings Regarding the Market Events of May 6, 2010|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/studies/2010/marketevents-report.pdf|date=2010-09-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815000431/https://www.sec.gov/news/studies/2010/marketevents-report.pdf|archivedate=August 15, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although whether HFT really increases systemic risk remains controversial.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==== Human population growth ====
{{main | human population growth}}
Agriculture and human population can be considered to be in a positive feedback mode,&lt;ref name=Brown2003&gt;{{citation|author= Brown, A. Duncan |year=2003 |title= Feed or Feedback: Agriculture, Population Dynamics and the State of the Planet |publisher= International Books |place=Utrecht  |isbn=978-90-5727-048-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means that one drives the other with increasing intensity. It is suggested that this positive feedback system will end sometime with a catastrophe, as modern agriculture is using up all of the easily available phosphate and is resorting to highly efficient monocultures which are more susceptible to [[systemic risk]].

Technological innovation and human population can be similarly considered, and this has been offered as an explanation for the apparent [[hyperbolic growth]] of the human population in the past, instead of a simpler [[exponential growth]].&lt;ref&gt;

=== In meteorology ===

[[Drought]] intensifies through positive feedback. A lack of rain decreases soil moisture, which kills plants and/or causes them to release less water through [[transpiration]]. Both factors limit [[evapotranspiration]], the process by which water vapor is added to the atmosphere from the surface, and add dry dust to the atmosphere, which absorbs water. Less water vapor means both low [[dew point]] temperatures and more efficient daytime heating, decreasing the chances of humidity in the atmosphere leading to cloud formation. Lastly, without clouds, there cannot be rain, and the loop is complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S.-Y. Simon Wang, Jin-Ho Yoon, Christopher C. Funk, Robert R.

Some feedback mechanisms act in relative isolation to the rest of the climate system while others are tightly coupled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10850&amp;page=16 ''Understanding Climate Change Feedbacks,'' U.S. National Academy of Sciences] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210122555/http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10850&amp;page=16 |date=2012-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Forcings, feedbacks and the dynamics of the climate system determine how much and how fast the climate changes. The main positive feedback in [[global warming]] is the tendency of warming to increase the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, which in turn leads to further warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch8s8-6-3-1.html |title=8.6.3.1 Water Vapour and Lapse Rate - AR4 WGI Chapter 8: Climate Models and their Evaluation |accessdate=2010-04-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409130123/http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch8s8-6-3-1.html |archivedate=2010-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main negative feedback comes from the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]], the amount of heat radiated from the Earth into space is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature of Earth's surface and atmosphere.

Other examples of positive feedback subsystems in climatology include:
* A warmer atmosphere will melt ice and this changes the [[albedo]] which further warms the atmosphere.
* Methane hydrates can be unstable so that a warming ocean could release more [[methane]], which is also a greenhouse gas. 
* [[Peat]], occurring naturally in [[peat bog]]s, contains carbon.  When peat dries it [[decomposes]], and may additionally burn. Peat also releases [[nitrous oxide]].
* Global warming affects the cloud distribution. Clouds at higher altitudes result in more infrared radiation reflected back at the Earth's surface than immediately reflected back into space.

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report]] states that "Anthropogenic warming could lead to some effects that are abrupt or irreversible, depending upon the rate and magnitude of the climate change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr.pdf |title=Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report.

=== In sociology ===

A [[self-fulfilling prophecy]] is a social positive feedback loop between beliefs and behavior: if enough people believe that something is true, their behavior can make it true, and observations of their behavior may in turn increase belief. A classic example is a [[bank run]].

Another sociological example of positive feedback is the [[network effect]]. When more people are encouraged to join a network this increases the reach of the network therefore the network expands ever more quickly. A [[viral video]] is an example of the network effect in which [[hyperlink|links]] to a popular video are shared and redistributed, ensuring that more people see the video and then re-publish the links. This is the basis for many social phenomena, including [[Ponzi scheme]]s and [[chain letter]]s. In many cases population size is the limiting factor to the feedback effect.

=== In chemistry ===

If a chemical reaction causes [[Exothermic reaction|the release of heat]], and the reaction itself [[Reaction rate|happens faster]] at higher temperatures, then there is a high likelihood of positive feedback. If the heat produced is not removed from the reactants fast enough, [[thermal runaway]] can occur and very quickly lead to a chemical [[explosion]].

=== In Conservation ===

Many wildlife are hunted for their parts which can be quite valuable. The closer to extinction that targeted species become, the higher the price there is on their parts. This is an example of positive feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2017.06.019 |pmid=28669883 |title=High prices for rare species can drive large populations extinct: The anthropogenic Allee effect revisited |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=429 |pages=170–180 |year=2017 |last1=Holden |first1=Matthew H. |last2=McDonald-Madden |first2=Eve |arxiv=1703.06736 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Posthumanist art''' refers to [[art]] that can only be created in some part through the aid of [[digital technology]]. [[posthumanism|Posthumanist]] art can be either human-conceived, or machine-produced in whole or in part. The extent to which the human element is involved in the creation, whether by direct manipulation of the [[technology]], or by creation of the [[algorithm]] through which the art is created, can vary.

'''Princess seams''' are long rounded seams sewn into women's [[blouse]]s or [[shirt]]s to add shaping or a tailored fit to closely follow a woman's shape.  They are sewn into the front and/or back of a shirt, and extend from the waist up to the arms. Princess seams are distinct from [[dart (sewing)|dart]]s in that they form a continuous line and are a full seam. Darts, on the other hand, are folds sewn into the clothing to shape the resultant garment. 

The princess seam style of [[dress]] needs no [[waistline (clothing)|waistline]] at all, since it does its shaping without [[dart (sewing)|dart]]s, by joining edges of different curvature. The resulting "princess seams" typically runs from the [[shoulder]] (or under the arm) curving gently over the [[breast|bust]] point and down to the lower [[hem]]. This creates a long, slimming look, often seen in dresses with an "[[A-line (clothing)|A-line]]" silhouette.

'''Proto-Semitic''' is a hypothetical [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed language]] ancestral to the historical [[Semitic languages]]. A 2009 study proposes that it was spoken from about [[38th century BC|3750 BCE]] in [[South West Asia]] during the Early [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref name="Kitchen2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kitchen|first1=A.|last2=Ehret|first2=C.|last3=Assefa|first3=S.|last4=Mulligan|first4=C. J.|title=Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of Semitic languages identifies an Early Bronze Age origin of Semitic in the Near East|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=29 April 2009|volume=276|issue=1668|page=2703|doi=10.1098/rspb.2009.0408|pmc=2839953}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no consensus regarding the location of the Proto-Semitic [[urheimat]]; scholars hypothesize that it may have originated in the [[Arabian Peninsula]], the [[Levant]], the [[Sahara]], or the [[Horn of Africa]].

The Semitic language family is considered to be part of the broader macro-family of [[Afroasiatic languages]].

== Dating ==
The earliest attestations of a Semitic language are in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], dating to around the 23rd century BC (see [[Sargon of Akkad]]) and the [[Eblaite language]], but earlier evidence of Akkadian comes from personal names in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] texts around 28th century BC.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Researchers in [[Egypt]] also claim to have discovered [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] snake spells: "The passages date from between 2400 to 3000 BC and appear to be written in [[Proto-Sinaitic script#Proto-Canaanite|Proto-Canaanite]], a direct ancestor of [[Biblical Hebrew]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Milstein|first1=Mati|title=Ancient Semitic Snake Spells Deciphered in Egyptian Pyramid|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/02/070205-snake-spells.html|accessdate=10 April 2017|work=news.nationalgeographic.com|date=5 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urheimat==
Since all modern Semitic languages can be traced back to a common ancestor, [[Semiticist]]s have placed importance upon locating the urheimat of the Proto-Semitic language.&lt;ref name=Lipinski42&gt;{{Harvnb|Lipiński|2001|pp=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Urheimat'' of the Proto-Semitic language may be considered within the context of the larger Afro-Asiatic family to which it belongs.

The previously popular hypothesis of an  Arabian urheimat has been largely abandoned, since the region could not have supported massive waves of emigration before the [[domestication]] of [[camel]]s in the second millennium BC.&lt;ref name=Lipinski42/&gt;

There is also evidence that Mesopotamia (and adjoining areas of modern Syria) were originally inhabited by a non-Semitic population.

=== Levant hypothesis ===
[[File:BayesianSemiticMap.jpg|thumb|Map of Semitic languages and statistically inferred dispersals. One hypothesized location of the divergence of ancestral Semitic from Afroasiatic between the African coast of the Red Sea and the Near East is also indicated.]]

A [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] analysis performed in 2009 suggests an origin for all known Semitic languages in the Levant around 3750 BCE, with a later single introduction from [[South Arabia]] into the [[Horn of Africa]] around 800 BCE. This statistical analysis could not, however, estimate when or where the ancestor of all Semitic languages diverged from Afroasiatic.&lt;ref name=Kitchen2009/&gt; It thus neither contradicts nor confirms the hypothesis that the divergence of ancestral Semitic from Afroasiatic occurred in Africa.

[[Christopher Ehret]] has hypothesized that genetic analyses (specifically those of Y chromosome phylogeography and TaqI 49a,f haplotypes) shows populations of proto-Semitic speakers may have moved from the Horn of Africa or southeastern Sahara northwards to the Nile Valley, northwest Africa, the Levant, and Aegean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ehret|first1=C.|last2=Keita|first2=S.O.Y.|last3=Newman|first3=Paul|title=The Origins of Afroasiatic|journal=Science|date=3 December 2004|volume=306|page=1680|url=https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2022/21062/OriginsAfroasiatic.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some geneticists and archaeologists have argued for a back-migration of proto-Afroasiatic speakers from [[Western Asia]] to Africa as early as the [[10th millennium BC]]. They suggest the [[Natufian culture]] might have spoken a proto-Afroasiatic language just prior to its disintegration into sub-languages.&lt;ref name="Dziebel2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dziebel|first=German|title=The Genius of Kinship: The Phenomenon of Human Kinship and the Global Diversity of Kinship Terminologies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1yo14jYY3pYC&amp;pg=PA366|accessdate=13 August 2013|year=2007|publisher=Cambria Press|isbn=978-1-934043-65-3|page=366}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nöth1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nöth|first=Winfried|author-link=Winfried Nöth|title=Origins of Semiosis: Sign Evolution in Nature and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y4_It_sAuMYC&amp;pg=PA293|accessdate=13 August 2013|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-087750-2|page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis is supported by the Afroasiatic terms for early livestock and crops in both [[Anatolia]] and [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=5wKT-5SOAKQC&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title= Quantitative Approaches to Linguistic Diversity: Commemorating the Centenary of the Birth of Morris Swadesh|page= 73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North Africa hypothesis ===
[[Edward Lipiński (orientalist)|Edward Lipiński]] believes that support for an [[Africa]]n origin is provided by what he describes as a possible relationship between a Pre-Semitic Afroasiatic language and the [[Niger–Congo languages]], whose urheimat probably lies in Nigeria–Cameroon.&lt;ref name=Lipinski43&gt;{{Harvnb|Lipiński|2001|pp=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; In support of this hypothesis, Lipiński points out that Proto-Semitic:
* did not likely originate in Arabia, as previously hypothesized, since the region could not have supported massive waves of emigration before the [[domestication]] of [[camel]]s in the second millennium BC.&lt;ref name=Lipinski42/&gt;
* did not likely originate in Mesopotamia (and adjoining areas of modern Syria), since there is evidence the original inhabitants were a non-Semitic population (i.e. the Sumerians)
* shares more [[isogloss]]es and lexicostatistical convergences with the [[Berber languages]] than any other family, thereby
* showing signs of a link with Berber long after other Afro-Asiatic language families, such as [[Egyptian language|Egyptic]] and [[Chadic languages|Chadic]], and
* was still spoken during the mid-[[Neolithic Subpluvial]] (i.e. [[5th millennium BC|5th millennium BCE]], when the [[Sahara]] was more humid).&lt;ref name=Lipinski43/&gt;

A [[Neolithic]] culture in the Sahara possibly related to Proto-Semitic collapsed due to desertification and climate change around 3500 BC, according to Lipiński – a fact attested  by evidence such as  [[rock art]]. This may have forced Proto-Semitic speakers to emigrate en masse through the [[Nile Delta]] to Western Asia. They were probably responsible for the collapse of the [[Ghassulian]] culture in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] around 3300 BC.&lt;ref name=Lipinski44/&gt; Another indication of the arrival of the proto-Semitic culture is the appearance of [[tumulus|tumuli]] in 4th and 3rd millennium BC [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], which were typical characteristic of Neolithic Maghreb, especially in Algeria.&lt;ref name=Lipinski44&gt;{{Harvnb|Lipiński|2001|pp=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that at this point, the ancestors of the speakers of [[Elamite language|Elamite]] moved towards Iran, although the inclusion of Elamite in Afroasiatic is only contemplated by a tiny minority.&lt;ref name=Blench96&gt;{{Harvnb|Blench|2006|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest wave of Semitic speakers entered the [[Fertile Crescent]] via Palestine and Syria and eventually founded the [[Akkadian Empire]]. Their relatives, the [[Amorites]], followed them and settled Syria before 2500 BC.&lt;ref name=Lipinski44/&gt; The collapse of the [[Bronze Age]] in Palestine led the southern Semites southwards, where they reached the highlands of Yemen after 20th century BC. Those crossed back to the Horn of Africa between 1500–500 BC.&lt;ref name=Lipinski44/&gt;

==Phonology==
The reconstruction of Proto-Semitic (PS) was originally based primarily on [[Arabic]], whose phonology and morphology (particularly in [[Classical Arabic]]) is extremely conservative, and which preserves as contrastive 28 out of the evident 29 consonantal phonemes.&lt;ref name="Versteegh1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Versteegh|first=Cornelis Henricus Maria "Kees"|authorlink=Kees Versteegh|title=The Arabic Language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2tghviSsrF8C|year=1997|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-11152-2|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the phonemic inventory of reconstructed Proto-Semitic is very similar to that of Arabic, with only one phoneme fewer in Arabic than in reconstructed Proto-Semitic. As such, Proto-Semitic is generally reconstructed as having the following [[phoneme]]s (as usually transcribed in Semitology):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Sáenz Badillos|first = Angel|translator = John Elwolde|trans-title = A History of the Hebrew Language |title=Historia de la Lengua Hebrea|origyear = 1988|year = 1993|publisher = Cambridge University Press|location = Cambridge, UK|isbn = 0-521-55634-1|pages = 18–19|chapter = Hebrew in the context of the Semitic Languages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fricatives *s *z *ṣ *ś *ṣ́ *ṱ may also be interpreted as [[Affricate consonant|affricates]] ({{IPA|/t͡s d͡z t͡sʼ t͡ɬ t͡ɬʼ t͡θʼ/}}), as is discussed below.

The Proto-Semitic consonant system is based on triads of related [[voiceless consonant|voiceless]], [[voiced consonant|voiced]] and "[[emphatic consonant|emphatic]]" consonants. Five such triads are reconstructed in Proto-Semitic:
*[[Dental consonant|Dental]] [[stop consonant|stop]]s *d *t *ṭ
*[[Velar consonant|Velar]] [[stop consonant|stop]]s *g *k *ḳ (normally written *g *k *q)
*[[Dental consonant|Dental]] [[sibilant]]s *z *s *ṣ
*[[Interdental consonant|Interdental]] {{IPA|/ð θ θʼ/}} (written *ḏ *ṯ *ṱ)
*[[Lateral consonant|Lateral]] {{IPA|/l ɬ ɬʼ/}} (normally written *l *ś *ṣ́)

The probable phonetic realization of most consonants is straightforward and is indicated in the table with the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]. Two subsets of consonants, however, deserve further comment.

===Emphatics===
The sounds notated here as "[[emphatic consonant|emphatic]]" occur in nearly all Semitic languages as well as in most other [[Afroasiatic]] languages, and they are generally reconstructed as [[glottalized]] in Proto-Semitic.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;That explains the lack of voicing distinction in the emphatic series, which would be unnecessary if the emphatics were pharyngealized.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, *ṭ, for example, represents {{IPA|[tʼ]}}. (See below for the fricatives/affricates).

In modern Semitic languages, emphatics are variously realized as [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngealized]] ([[Arabic]], [[Aramaic]], [[Tiberian Hebrew]] (such as {{IPA|[tˤ]}}), [[glottalized]] ([[Ethiopian Semitic languages]], [[Modern South Arabian]] languages such as {{IPA|[tʼ]}}), or as [[unaspirated]] ([[Turoyo]] of [[Tur-Abdin]] such as {{IPA|[t˭]}});&lt;ref&gt;Dolgopolsky 1999, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ashkenazi Hebrew]] and [[Maltese language|Maltese]] are exceptions and emphatics merge into plain consonants in various ways under the influence of [[Indo-European languages]] ([[Italian language|Italian]]/[[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] for Maltese, [[German language|German]]/[[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] for Hebrew).

An emphatic labial *ṗ occurs in some Semitic languages, but it is unclear whether it was a phoneme in Proto-Semitic.
*Hebrew developed an emphatic labial phoneme ''ṗ'' to represent unaspirated {{IPA|/p/}} in Iranian and Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Hetzron 1997, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ge'ez is unique among Semitic languages for contrasting all three of {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/f/}}, and {{IPA|/pʼ/}}. While {{IPA|/p/}} and {{IPA|/pʼ/}} occur mostly in loanwords (especially from [[Greek language|Greek]]), there are many other occurrences whose origin is less clear (such as ''hepʼä'' 'strike', ''häppälä'' 'wash clothes').&lt;ref&gt;Woodard 2008, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fricatives===
The reconstruction of Proto-Semitic has nine fricative sounds that are reflected usually as [[sibilants]] in later languages, but whether all were already sibilants in Proto-Semitic is debated:
*Two voiced fricatives that {{transl|sem|*ð, *z}} eventually became, for example, {{IPA|/z/}} for both in Hebrew, but {{IPA|/ð/}} and {{IPA|/z/}} in Arabic, respectively
*Four voiceless fricatives
**{{transl|sem|*θ}} ({{transl|sem|*ṯ}}) that became {{IPA|/ʃ/}} in Hebrew but {{IPA|/θ/}} in Arabic
**{{transl|sem|*š}} ({{transl|sem|*s₁}}) that became {{IPA|/ʃ/}} in Hebrew but {{IPA|/s/}} in Arabic
**{{transl|sem|*ś}} ({{transl|sem|*s₂}}) that became {{IPA|/s/}} (transcribed [[Shin (letter)#Hebrew|''ś'']]) in Hebrew but {{IPA|/ʃ/}} in Arabic
**{{transl|sem|*s}} ({{transl|sem|*s₃}}) that became {{IPA|/s/}} in both Hebrew and Arabic
*Three emphatic fricatives ({{transl|sem|*θ̣, *ṣ, *ṣ́}})

The precise sound of the Proto-Semitic fricatives, notably of {{transl|sem|*š}}, {{transl|sem|*ś}}, {{transl|sem|*s}} and {{transl|sem|*ṣ}}, remains a perplexing problem, and there are various systems of notation to describe them. The notation given here is traditional and is based on their pronunciation in Hebrew, which has traditionally been extrapolated to Proto-Semitic.  The notation {{transl|sem|*s₁}}, {{transl|sem|*s₂}}, {{transl|sem|*s₃}} is found primarily in the literature on [[Old South Arabian]], but more recently, it has been used by some authors to discus Proto-Semitic to express a noncommittal view of the pronunciation of the sounds. However, the older transcription remains predominant in most literature, often even among scholars who either disagree with the traditional interpretation or remain noncommittal.&lt;ref&gt;For an example of an author using the traditional symbols but subscribing to the new sound values, see Hackett, Joe Ann. 2008. Phoenician and Punic. ''The Ancient Languages of Syria-Palestine and Arabia'' (ed. Roger D. Woodard). Likewise, Huehnengard, John and Christopher Woods. 2008. Akkadian and Eblaite. ''The Ancient Languages of Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Aksum'' (ed. Roger D. Woodard). p. 96: "Similarly, there was a triad of affricates, voiced {{IPA|/&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;z/}} ({{angbr|z}}) voiceless {{IPA|/&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;s/}} ({{angbr|s}}), and emphatic {{IPA|/&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;sʼ/}} ({{angbr|{{transl|sem|*ṣ}}}}). These became fricatives in later dialects; the voiceless member of this later, fricative set was pronounced [s] in Babylonian, but [š] in Assyrian, while the reflex of Proto-Semitic {{transl|sem|*š}}, which was probably simple [s] originally, continued to be pronounced as such in Assyrian, but as [š] in Babylonian." Similarly, an author remaining undecided regarding the sound values of the sibilants will also use the conventional symbols, for example, [[Joseph Greenberg|Greenberg, Joseph]], The Patterning of Root Morphemes in Semitic. 1990. p. 379. ''On language: selected writings of Joseph H. Greenberg''. Ed. Keith M. Denning and Suzanne Kemme: "There is great uncertainty regarding the phonetic values of ''s'', ''ś'', and ''š'' in Proto-Semitic. I simply use them here as conventional transcriptions of the three sibilants corresponding to the sounds indicated by ''samekh'', ''śin'', and ''šin'' respectively in Hebrew orthography."&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional view, as expressed in the conventional transcription and still maintained by some of the authors in the field&lt;ref&gt;Lipiński, Edward. 2000. Semitic languages: outline of a comparative grammar. e.g. the tables on p.113, p.131; also p.133: "Common Semitic or Proto-Semitic has a voiceless fricative prepalatal or palato-alevolar ''š'', i.e. {{IPA|[ʃ]}} ...", p.129 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, M.C.A. 2008. Ancient North Arabian. In: The Ancient Languages of Syria-Palestine and Arabia (ed. Roger D. Woodard). p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blau, Joshua (2010). Phonology and Morphology of Biblical Hebrew. Winona Lake, Indiana: Eisenbrauns. p. 25–40.&lt;/ref&gt; is that {{transl|sem|*š}} was a [[Voiceless postalveolar fricative]] ({{IPA|[ʃ]}}), {{transl|sem|*s}} was a [[voiceless alveolar sibilant]] ({{IPA|[s]}}) and {{transl|sem|*ś}} was a [[voiceless alveolar lateral fricative]] ({{IPA|[ɬ]}}). Accordingly, {{transl|sem|*ṣ}} is seen as an emphatic version of {{transl|sem|*s}} ({{IPA|[sʼ]}}) {{transl|sem|*z}} as a voiced version of it ({{IPA|[z]}}) and {{transl|sem|*ṣ́}} as an emphatic version of {{transl|sem|*ś}} ({{IPA|[ɬʼ]}}). The reconstruction of {{transl|sem|*ś ṣ́}} as lateral fricatives (or affricates) is certain although few modern languages preserve the sounds. The pronunciation of {{transl|sem|*ś ṣ́}} as {{IPA|[ɬ ɬʼ]}} is still maintained in the [[Modern South Arabian languages]] (such as [[Mehri language|Mehri]]), and evidence of a former lateral pronunciation is evident in a number of other languages. For example, [[Biblical Hebrew]] ''baśam'' was borrowed into [[Ancient Greek]] as ''balsamon'' (hence English "balsam"), and the 8th-century Arab grammarian [[Sībawayh]] explicitly described the Arabic descendant of {{transl|sem|*ṣ́}}, now pronounced {{IPA|[dˤ]}} in the standard pronunciation or {{IPA|[ðˤ]}} in Bedouin-influenced dialects, as a pharyngealized [[voiced lateral fricative]] {{IPA|[ɮˤ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Charles|last=Ferguson|title=The Arabic Koine|journal=Language|volume=35|number=4|year=1959|page=630|doi=10.2307/410601}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first1=Kees|last1=Versteegh|title=The Arabic Language|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=1997|isbn=90-04-17702-7}}
&lt;/ref&gt; (Compare Spanish ''[[wikt:alcalde#Spanish|alcalde]]'', from [[Andalusian Arabic]] {{lang|ar|اَلْقَاضِي}} ''al-qāḍī'' "judge".)

The primary disagreements concern whether the sounds were actually fricatives in Proto-Semitic or whether some were affricates and whether the sound designated {{transl|sem|*š}} was pronounced {{IPA|[ʃ]}} (or similar) in Proto-Semitic, as the traditional view posits, or had the value of {{IPA|[s]}}. The issue of the nature of the "emphatic" consonants, discussed above, is partly related (but partly orthogonal) to the issues here as well.

With respect to the traditional view, there are two dimensions of "minimal" and "maximal" modifications made:

#In how many sounds are taken to be [[Affricate consonant|affricate]]s. The "minimal affricate" position takes only the emphatic {{transl|sem|*ṣ}} as an affricate {{IPA|[t͡sʼ]}}. The "maximal affricate" position additionally posits that {{transl|sem|*s *z}} were actually affricates {{IPA|[t͡s d͡z]}} while {{transl|sem|*š}} was actually a simple fricative {{IPA|[s]}}.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Huehnengard, John. 2008. Afro-Asiatic. In: The Ancient Languages of Syria-Palestine and Arabia (ed. Roger D. Woodard). P.229–231&lt;/ref&gt;
#In whether to extend the affricate interpretation to the interdentals and laterals. The "minimal extension" position assumes that only the sibilants were affricates, and the other "fricatives" were in fact all fricatives, but the maximal update extends the same interpretation to the other sounds. Typically, that means that the "minimal affricate, maximal extension" position takes all and only the emphatics are taken as affricates: emphatic {{transl|sem|*ṣ θ̣ ṣ́}} were {{IPA|[t͡sʼ t͡θʼ t͡ɬʼ]}}. The "maximal affricate, maximal extension" position assumes not only the "maximal affricate" position for sibilants but also that non-emphatic {{transl|sem|*θ ð ś}} were actually affricates.

Affricates in Proto-Semitic were proposed early on but met little acceptance until the work of Alice Faber (1981){{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} who challenged the older approach. The Semitic languages that have survived often have fricatives for these consonants. However, Ethiopic languages and Modern Hebrew, in many reading traditions, have an affricate for {{transl|sem|*ṣ}}.&lt;ref name="Dp33" /&gt;

The evidence for the various affricate interpretations of the sibilants is direct evidence from transcriptions and structural evidence. However, the evidence for the "maximal extension" positions that extend affricate interpretations to non-sibilant "fricatives" is largely structural because of both the relative rarity of the interdentals and lateral obstruents among the attested Semitic language and the even-greater rarity of such sounds among the various languages in which Semitic words were transcribed. As a result, even when the sounds were transcribed, the resulting transcriptions may be difficult to interpret clearly.

The narrowest affricate view (only {{transl|sem|*ṣ}} was an affricate {{IPA|[t͡sʼ]}}) is the most accepted one.&lt;ref name="kogan-62"&gt;Kogan, Leonid (2011). "Proto-Semitic Phonetics and Phonology". In ''Semitic languages: an international handbook,'' Stefan Weninger, ed. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter. P. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Kogan "Proto-Semitic Phonetics and Phonology" (2011), Steiner 1982a is the "classic exposition" (p. 62).&lt;/ref&gt; The affricate pronunciation is directly attested in the modern Ethiopic languages and Modern Hebrew, as mentioned above, but also in ancient transcriptions of numerous Semitic languages in various other languages:
*Transcriptions of [[Ge'ez]] from the period of the [[Axumite Kingdom]] (early centuries AD): ''ṣəyāmo'' rendered as Greek ''τζιαμω'' ''tziamō''.&lt;ref name="kogan-62"/&gt;
*The Hebrew reading tradition of {{transl|sem|ṣ}} as {{IPA|[t͡s]}} clearly goes back at least to medieval times, as shown by the use of Hebrew {{lang|he|צ}} ({{transl|sem|ṣ}}) to represent affricates in early [[New Persian]], Old Osmanli [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], [[Middle High German]] etc. Similarly, [[Old French]] ''c'' {{IPA|/t͡s/}} was used to transliterate {{lang|he|צ}}: Hebrew ''{{transl|sem|ṣɛdɛḳ}}'' "righteousness" and ''{{transl|sem|ʼārɛṣ}}'' "land (of Israel)" were written ''cedek, arec''.&lt;ref name="kogan-62"/&gt;
*There is also evidence of an affricate in Ancient Hebrew and Phoenician {{transl|sem|ṣ}}. Punic {{transl|sem|ṣ}} was often transcribed as ''ts'' or ''t'' in Latin and Greek or occasionally Greek ''ks''; correspondingly, Egyptian names and loanwords in Hebrew and Phoenician use {{transl|sem|ṣ}} to represent the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] palatal affricate ''ḏ'' (conventionally described as voiced {{IPA|[d͡ʒ]}} but possibly instead an unvoiced ejective {{IPA|[t͡ʃʼ]}}).&lt;ref name="kogan-63"&gt;Kogan, (2011), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Aramaic and Syriac had an affricated realization of {{transl|sem|*ṣ}} until some point, as is seen in [[Classical Armenian]] loanwords: Aramaic {{lang|arc-Hebr|צרר}} 'bundle, bunch' → Classical Armenian ''crar'' {{IPA|/t͡sɹaɹ/}}.&lt;ref name="Dp32"/&gt;
 
The "maximal affricate" view, applied only to sibilants, also has transcriptional evidence. According to Kogan, the affricate interpretation of Akkadian {{transl|sem|s z ṣ}} is generally accepted.&lt;ref name="kogan-66"&gt;Kogan (2011), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Akkadian cuneiform]], as adapted for writing various other languages, used the {{transl|sem|z-}} signs to represent affricates. Examples include /ts/ in [[Hittite language|Hittite]],&lt;ref name="Dp32"&gt;Dolgopolsky 1999, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian affricate ''{{IPA|ṯ}}'' in the [[Amarna letters]] and the [[Old Iranian]] affricates {{IPA|/t͡ʃ d͡ʒ/}} in [[Elamite language|Elamite]].&lt;ref name="kogan-67"&gt;Kogan (2011), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Egyptian transcriptions of early Canaanite words with {{transl|sem|*z, *s, *ṣ}} use affricates (''{{IPA|ṯ}}'' for {{transl|sem|*s}}, ''{{IPA|ḏ}}'' {{transl|sem|*z, *ṣ}}).&lt;ref name="kogan-67-68"&gt;Kogan (2011), pp. 67-68.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]] loanwords in the "older stratum" of Armenian reflect {{transl|sem|*s *z}} as affricates {{IPA|/t͡sʰ/}}, {{IPA|/d͡z/}}.&lt;ref name="Dp33"&gt;Dolgopolsky 1999, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Greek borrowing of Phoenician [[Shin (letter)|𐤔]] {{transl|sem|*š}} to represent /s/ (compare Greek [[Σ]]), and [[samekh|𐤎]] {{transl|sem|*s}} to represent {{IPA|/ks/}} (compare Greek [[Ξ]]) is difficult to explain if {{transl|sem|*s}} then had the value {{IPA|[s]}} in Phoenician, but it is quite easy to explain if it actually had the value {{IPA|[t͡s]}} (even more so if {{transl|sem|*š}} had the value {{IPA|[s]}}).&lt;ref name="kogan-69"&gt;Kogan (2011), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Similarly, Phoenician uses 𐤔 {{transl|sem|*š}} to represent sibilant fricatives in other languages rather than 𐤎 {{transl|sem|*s}} until the mid-3rd century BC, which has been taken by Friedrich/Röllig 1999 (pp.&amp;nbsp;27–28)&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Kogan (2011), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; as evidence of an affricate pronunciation in Phoenician until then. On the other hand, Egyptian starts using ''s'' in place of earlier ''{{IPA|ṯ}}'' to represent Canaanite ''s'' around 1000 BC. As a result, Kogan&lt;ref name="kogan-68"&gt;Kogan (2011), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; assumes a much earlier loss of affricates in Phoenician, and he assumes that the foreign sibilant fricatives in question had a sound closer to {{IPA|[ʃ]}} than {{IPA|[s]}}. (A similar interpretation for at least Latin ''s'' has been proposed by various linguists based on evidence of similar pronunciations of written ''s'' in a number of early medieval [[Romance languages]]; a technical term for this "intermediate" sibilant is [[voiceless alveolar retracted sibilant]].)

There is also a good deal of internal evidence in early Akkadian for affricate realizations of {{transl|sem|s z ṣ}}. Examples are that underlying ||{{transl|sem|*t, *d, *ṭ + *š}}|| were realized as ''ss'', which is more natural if the law was phonetically ||{{transl|sem|*t, *d, *ṭ + *s}}|| → {{IPA|[tt͡s]}},&lt;ref name="Dp32"/&gt; and that {{transl|sem|*s *z *ṣ}} shift to {{transl|sem|*š}} before {{transl|sem|*t}}, which is more naturally interpreted as deaffrication.&lt;ref name="kogan-66"/&gt;

Evidence for {{transl|sem|*š}} as {{IPA|/s/}} also exists but is somewhat less clear. It has been suggested that it is cross-linguistically rare for languages with a single sibilant fricative to have {{IPA|[ʃ]}} as the sound and that {{IPA|[s]}} is more likely.&lt;ref name="kogan-66"/&gt; Similarly, the use of Phoenician 𐤔 {{transl|sem|*š}}, as the source of Greek [[Σ]] ''s'', seems easiest to explain if the phoneme had the sound of {{IPA|[s]}} at the time. The occurrence of {{IPA|[ʃ]}} for {{transl|sem|*š}} in a number of separate modern Semitic languages (such as [[Neo-Aramaic]], [[Modern South Arabian]], most Biblical Hebrew reading traditions) and Old Babylonian Akkadian is then suggested to result from a push-type [[chain shift]], and the change from {{IPA|[t͡s]}} to {{IPA|[s]}} "pushes" {{IPA|[s]}} out of the way to {{IPA|[ʃ]}} in the languages in question, and a merger of the two to {{IPA|[s]}} occurs in various other languages such as Arabic and Ethiopian Semitic.

On the other hand, it has been suggested that the initial merged ''s'' in Arabic was actually a "hissing-hushing sibilant",&lt;ref&gt;Kogan (2011), p. 70, quoting Martinet 1953 p. 73 and Murtonen 1966 p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; presumably something like {{IPA|[ɕ]}} (or a "retracted sibilant"), which did not become {{IPA|[s]}} until later. That would suggest a value closer to {{IPA|[ɕ]}} (or a "retracted sibilant") or {{IPA|[ʃ]}} for Proto-Semitic {{transl|sem|*š}} since {{IPA|[t͡s]}} and {{IPA|[s]}} would almost certainly merge directly to [s]. Furthermore, there is various evidence to suggest that the sound {{IPA|[ʃ]}} for {{transl|sem|*š}} existed while {{transl|sem|*s}} was still {{IPA|[ts]}}.&lt;ref name="kogan-70"&gt;Kogan (2011), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are the Southern Old Babylonian form of Akkadian, which evidently had {{IPA|[ʃ]}} along with {{IPA|[t͡s]}} as well as Egyptian transcriptions of early Canaanite words in which {{transl|sem|*š s}} are rendered as ''{{transl|sem|š ṯ}}''. (''ṯ'' is an affricate {{IPA|[t͡ʃ]}} and the consensus interpretation of ''š'' is {{IPA|[ʃ]}}, as in Modern Coptic.&lt;ref name="kogan-70"/&gt;)

Diem (1974) suggested that the Canaanite sound change of {{transl|sem|*θ}} → {{transl|sem|*š}} would be more natural if *š was {{IPA|[s]}} than if it was {{IPA|[ʃ]}}. However, Kogan argues that, because {{transl|sem|*s}} was {{IPA|[ts]}} at the time, the change from {{transl|sem|*θ}} to {{transl|sem|*š}} is the most likely merger, regardless of the exact pronunciation of {{transl|sem|*š}} while the shift was underway.&lt;ref name="kogan-92-93"&gt;Kogan (2011), pp. 92-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence for the affricate nature of the non-sibilants is based mostly on internal considerations. Ejective fricatives are quite rare cross-linguistically, and when a language has such sounds, it nearly always has {{IPA|[sʼ]}} so if {{transl|sem|*ṣ}} was actually affricate {{IPA|[tsʼ]}}, it would be extremely unusual if {{transl|sem|*θ̣ ṣ́}} was fricative {{IPA|[θʼ ɬʼ]}} rather than affricate {{IPA|[t͡θʼ t͡ɬʼ]}}. According to Rodinson (1981) and Weninger (1998), the Greek placename ''Mátlia'', with ''tl'' used to render Ge'ez ''ḍ'' (Proto-Semitic ''*ṣ́''), is "clear proof" that this sound was affricated in [[Ge'ez]] and quite possibly in Proto-Semitic as well.&lt;ref name="kogan-80"&gt;Kogan (2011), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence for the most maximal interpretation, with all the interdentals and lateral obstruents being affricates, appears to be mostly structural: the system would be more symmetric if reconstructed that way.

The shift of {{transl|sem|*š}} to ''h'' occurred in most Semitic languages (other than Akkadian, [[Minaean language|Minaian]], [[Qatabanian language|Qatabanian]]) in grammatical and pronominal morphemes, and it is unclear whether reduction of {{transl|sem|*š}} began in a daughter proto-language or in Proto-Semitic itself. Some thus suggest that weakened {{transl|sem|*š̠}} may have been a separate phoneme in Proto-Semitic.&lt;ref&gt;Dolgopolsky 1999, pp. 19, 69-70&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4843">A '''reflector''' is a [[retroreflector]] intended for [[pedestrian]]s, [[running|runners]], motorized and non-motorized [[vehicle]]s. A safety reflector is similar to reflective stripes that can be found on [[safety vest]]s and clothing worn by road workers and rescue workers. They are sometimes erroneously called luminous badges or luminous tags, but this is incorrect as they do not themselves produce light, but only reflect it.

A safety reflector aids visibility of a person or vehicle visible to on the road, as it reflects light from [[headlight]]s of vehicles. Safety reflectors are especially useful where there are no [[streetlight]]s.

Unlike reflective stripes that are permanently fixed to clothing, the safety reflector is a stand-alone device that can be attached to any article of [[clothing]] as needed, often using a [[safety pin]] and some string. For vehicles, the reflector is usually a fixed part. In bicycles, reflectors are usually on wheels, pedals, under the seat, on the back of the luggage rack, and in front of the front fork. In motorcycles, automobiles, and other vehicles, reflectors are built into the front and rear ends (and sides) next to the headlights and brake lights.

Within the European Union, safety reflectors for pedestrians must be certified to comply with the CE EN 13356 safety standard.&lt;ref name="Pedestrian's reflector info sheet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liikenneturva.fi/tietolehti/2008_englanti/siniset/reflector.php |title=Pedestrian's reflector info sheet |publisher=Finnish Road Safety Council |accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This standard is specifically for "loose, reflective accessories for personal use". There are other standards for other types of reflectors such as safety vests and reflectors on bicycles.

In Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, pedestrians are required by law to wear safety reflectors when walking during dark conditions.&lt;ref name="Pedestrian's reflector info sheet"/&gt;

The reflector is a [[Finland|Finnish]] creation, invented by a farmer Mr. Arvi Lehti from [[Pertteli]], a small township in Western Finland. The inventor did not consider pedestrian safety when creating the first reflectors: he simply wished to protect his horse carts and carriages. Reflectors were introduced to Finns in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pedsafe.com/reflectors/index.php?main_page=page&amp;id=3 |title=Pedestrian Reflector History |publisher= |accessdate=2012-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays one can find reflectors of all possible shapes and colours, as design and fashion industries have turned their faces towards this diminutive gadget. Special 'clip-on' reflectors for bicycles and other [[human-powered transport|human-powered vehicles]] are also common.

==Bicycle reflector==
A '''bicycle reflector''' or '''prism reflector''' is a common safety device found on the rear, front and wheels of bicycles. It uses the principle of [[retroreflection]] to alert another road user of the bicycle's presence on the road.

The reflector is usually manufactured in the form of a moulded tile of transparent plastic. The outside surface is smooth, allowing light, such as from a car's headlights, to enter. The rear surface of the tile takes the form of an array of angled micro-prisms or spherical beads.

The light striking the rear, inside surface of the prisms or beads, does so at an angle greater than the [[Critical angle (optics)|critical angle]] thus it undergoes [[total internal reflection]]. Due to the orientation of the other inside surfaces, any light internally reflecting is directed back out the front of the reflector in the direction it came from. This alerts the person close to the light source, e.g. the driver of the vehicle, to the presence of the cyclist.&lt;ref&gt;[Hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Complete physics, Stephen Pople 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saint Lucian cuisine''' is a combination of [[French cuisine|French]], [[Indian cuisine|East Indian]] and [[British cuisine|British]] dishes. Before colonization, the [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] and the [[Arawaks]] occupied the island, surviving on its various natural fruits and vegetables like mangoes, oranges, tangerines, avocados, and breadfruits. St Lucia is known for its national dish consisting of [[ green bananas]] and [[salt fish]] locally known as green figs and saltfish; [[breadfruit]] and salt fish is also an alternative favourite among the locals. Other speciality dishes include a dish known as ''bouyon'', which is a thick red beans one pot soup meal made of meat, ground provisions (ground tuber foods) and vegetables. Other popular local dishes include callaloo, Accra, green fig salad, cocoa tea (a traditional breakfast spiced hot drink) and bakes(very similar to Johhny cakes) among others. The island's British and Indian influences are seen in the variety of spices used in its cuisine, which include garlic, [[cinnamon]], [[nutmeg]], [[cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[parsley]], [[cloves]], and [[allspice]].A wide range of local fruits like [[golden apples]], mangoes, [[starfruit]], [[tamarind]] are used to make juices, although lime juice (lime squash) seems a more popular choice to be enjoyed in conjunction with the local delicacies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3416">'''Sangita Makaranda''' is an ancient work on classical music written by [[Narada]].  This work is a rare collection of definitions, descriptions and comments on all the essentials music by other ancient reputed authors from [[Bharata Muni]] to Sharangdeva. Its main feature is the treatiment of [[Raga]]s; categorizing them as male, female and neuter.&lt;ref&gt;http://aalaap.net/sangitamakaranda.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The treatise circa 1100 CE is the earliest text where rules similar to the current [[Hindustani classical music]] can be found. Narada actually names and classifies the system in its earlier form before the advent of changes as a result of Persian influences.

==The three distinct stages==
It also hints on the uniqueness of the raga-nomenclaturing. On close study of it, one learns of three distinct stages on the nomenclaturing of the Indian ragas.

*Stage one refers Bharata's ''Natyashastra'' (prior 2nd century BC). It is the stage of  raga-nomenclature when the ragas were named after the saliant swara of the ragas. For example, after Shadaj swara, originated the name of the Raga called shadaji; after Arishabh swara originated the name of Aasharbhi Raga; and after Gandhari swara was named the Gaandhari Raga, the last one being still in currency.
*In the second stage, the Ragas were named after different jana ([[tribe]]s or the [[clan]]s) dwelling in different geographical locations. For example, after [[Shaka]] tribe was named Shakatilak Raga or Shakamishrat variants of Shaka Raga; after Pulinda tribe was named the Pulinda Raga; after [[Abhira]] clan was named Abhiri Raga;  after Savara tribe was named  Saviri or Saverka. Similarly  after Malava, [[Andhra Pradesh|Andhra]], [[Gurjar]], [[Kambojas|Kambhoja]] (Kamboja) tribes were named Ragas Malvika, Andhrri, Gurjari and Kambhoji (Kamboji) respectively, with all their variants.&lt;ref&gt;cf: Ragas and Raginis, pp 72-77, O. P. Ganguli; cf: Music in Education, 1955, p 80, Dmitrij Kabalevskij; Ancient Kamboja People and the Country, 1981, p 233, Dr J. L. Kamboj.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the third stage, the ragas were named after the [[janapada]] or desha or country of their origin. For example, after [[Bengal]] was named Bangal-Raga; after Sindhudesha was named Saindhvi Raga; after Sauvira Janapada was named Sauviri or Sauvirak Raga; after [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] was named the  Saurashtri (or Sorathi or Surat or Surat-malar); and after Karnata janapada was named Karnati Raga etc. Similarly, the Kambhoji Raga or Ragini which is now very popular in southern India was named after the Kambhoja janapada.  Scholars believe that the Kambhoji raga or ragini had probably originated in the ''jana'' rather than the ''janapada'' stage.&lt;ref name="Country 1981, p 233"&gt;Ancient Kamboja People and the Country, 1981, p 233, Dr J. L. Kamboj, cf: Ragas and Raginis, pp 72-77, O. P. Ganguli, The Kambojas Through the Ages, 2005, p  94, S Kirpal Singh&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that the basic tune of raga Kamboji or Kambhoji must have evolved during [[Epic India|epic]] or even pre-epic times.

The '''National Anthem of Karachay-Cherkessia''' ({{lang-ru|Гимн Карачаево-Черкесии}}, ''Gimn Karachayevo-Cherkesii''; [[Karachay-Balkar language|Karachay-Balkar]]: Къарачай-Черкес Республиканы Гимни; [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]]: Къэрэщей-Шэрджэс Республикэм и Къэрал Орэдыр) is the [[national anthem]] of [[Karachay-Cherkessia]]. The lyrics were written by Yusuf Sozarukov (1952–2008) and the music was composed by Aslan Daurov (1940–1999). The anthem was established on 9 April 1998 by Law of the KChR number 410-XXII "On the State Anthem of the Republic of Karachay-Cherkessia". The title of the song is ''Древней Родиной горжусь я!'', meaning "Ancient Homeland I am proud of!".

'''Stippling''' is the creation of a pattern simulating varying [[Grayscale|degrees of solidity]] or shading by using small dots. Such a pattern may occur in nature and these effects are frequently emulated by artists.

{{main|Stipple engraving}}
In a [[drawing]] or [[painting]], the dots are made of [[pigment]] of a single colour, applied with a [[pen]] or [[brush]]; the denser the dots, the darker the apparent shade—or lighter, if the pigment is lighter than the surface.  This is similar to—but distinct from—[[pointillism]], which uses dots of different colours to simulate blended colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Encyclopedia of Drawing Techniques| last=Ian Simpson| date=1987| pages=62–64| publisher=Headline| location=London| isbn=0-7472-0051-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[printmaking]], dots may be carved out of a surface to which ink will be applied, to produce either a greater or lesser density of ink depending on the printing technique. In [[Stipple engraving|engraving]], the technique was invented by [[Giulio Campagnola]] in about 1510. Stippling may also be used in engraving or [[sculpture|sculpting]] an object even when there is no ink or paint involved, either to change the texture of the object, or to produce the appearance of light or dark shading depending on the reflective properties of the surface: for instance, stipple engraving on glass produces areas that appear brighter than the surrounding glass.

The technique became popular as a means of producing shaded [[line art]] illustrations for publication, because drawings created this way could be reproduced in simple black ink.  The other common method is [[hatching]], which uses lines instead of dots.  Stippling has traditionally been favoured over hatching in [[biological illustration|biological]] and [[medical illustration]], since it is less likely than hatching to interfere visually with the structures being illustrated (the lines used in hatching can be mistaken for actual contours), and also since it allows the artist to vary the density of shading more subtly to depict curved or irregular surfaces.

Images produced by [[halftone|halftoning]] or [[dither]]ing and computer [[Computer printer|printers]] operate on similar principles (varying the size and/or spacing of dots on paper), but do so via photographic or digital processes rather than manually. These newer techniques have made it possible to convert continuous-tone images into patterns suitable for printing, but artists may still choose stippling for its simplicity and handmade appearance. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' still features stippled and hatched portraits known as [[hedcut]]s (a style brought to the WSJ by [[Kevin Sprouls]] in 1987) in its pages, a holdover from its earlier avoidance of [[photograph]]s.

In description of flora species, a stippling is a kind of pattern, especially in the case of flowering plants, produced in nature that occur on flower petals and sepals. These are similar to the dot patterns in artworks that produce an often intricate pattern. An example can be seen on the base of the petal insides of ''[[Calochortus luteus]]'', a [[lily]] endemic to [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2009. [http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=97686 ''Gold Nuggets: Calochortus luteus'', GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004094242/http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=97686 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The term stipple can also apply to a random pattern of small depressions applied to a surface to increase the [[friction]] and make the surface easier to grip.  This process is similar to [[knurl]]ing or checkering, but is often used on complex curved surfaces, such as [[anatomical]] grips, where a regular pattern would not fit.  Stippling can be cast into [[plastic]] objects, or applied with a hammer and punch to [[wood]] or [[metal]] objects.

A further use of stipple indicates the damage caused by [[spider mites]] which make tiny white spots on plant leaves which can [[Coalescence (physics)|coalesce]] until the entire leaf appears silvery.

In quilt making, the term refers to background [[quilting]] in heirloom quilts and all-over stitching in others. It is made freehand or with free-motion [[machine quilting]] by densely stitching through all layers in a relatively close repetitive design.

In [[interior decoration]], the tips of the bristles of a [[brush|stippling brush]] are dabbed onto a freshly painted wall or surface to create a subtle design in the paint. The paint hit by the points is displaced and leaves only a thin dot of paint through which a lighter layer of colour underneath will show through.

In [[digital photography]], stippling refers to image noise similar to [[film grain]].

In [[forensic science]], stippling refers to a pattern of [[gunshot residue]] burned into the skin that results from close proximity to a discharged firearm. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://adfs.alabama.gov/Glossary.aspx |title=Glossary of Forensic Terms |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences|publisher= U.S. state government|access-date=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Swedish Cultural Center''' is a meeting spot for [[Scandinavian American|Scandinavians]] in [[Seattle, Washington]]. It was founded in 1892, initially as the "Swedish Club".

The club is located at 1920 Dexter Avenue North in a building designed by architects Einar V. Anderson, Arden Croco Steinhart, and Robert Dennis Theriault Sr., and built 1959-1961.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pcad.lib.washington.edu/building/10947/ Swedish Club #2, Seattle, WA (1959-1961)], Pacific Coast Architecture Database, University of Washington.

'''''Dzienniki gwiazdowe''''' is a 1957 collection of short stories by [[Poland|Polish]] writer [[Stanisław Lem]], expanded in 1971 around the character of space traveller [[Ijon Tichy]]. The collection was published in English in two volumes, '''''The Star Diaries''''' (published New York, 1976) and '''''Memoirs of a Space Traveller''''' (published London, 1982).

== Stories ==

=== The Star Diaries ===
Translated by [[Michael Kandel]].
* ''Introduction'' and ''Introduction to the Expanded Edition'', in which [[professor Tarantoga]] presents the latest information on the documentation of Ijon Tichy's exploits.
* "The Seventh Voyage", in which a spaceship defect forces Tichy through a series of time vortices, creating a multitude of temporal copies of himself.
* "The Eighth Voyage", in which Ijon Tichy represents Earth to petition for its admission to the United Planets.
* "The Eleventh Voyage", in which Ijon Tichy travels in disguise to the planet Circia to attempt to bring an end to hostilities coming from its robot population.
* "The Twelfth Voyage", in which Ijon Tichy employs Prof. Tarantoga's new invention of time acceleration on the planet of Microcephalics.
* "The Thirteenth Voyage", in which Ijon Tichy sets out to meet Master Oh. Instead, he finds two planets (Pinta and Panta) ruled according to the Master's principles. On Pinta, people are trying to become fish using a technique called ''evolution by persuasion''. On Panta, all inhabitants are identical clones and exchange their jobs daily.
* "The Fourteenth Voyage", in which Ijon Tichy goes hunting for Squamp (Polish: ''kurdel'') - an animal whose area is several [[hectare]]s and is being puzzled by mysterious objects, called ''scrupts'' (Polish: ''[[sepulki]]'').
* "The Eighteenth Voyage", in which Ijon Tichy helps create the cause of our universe from a single electron.
* "The Twentieth Voyage", in which Ijon Tichy is forced by his future self to lead a programme to ameliorate Earth's and mankind's history.
* "The Twenty-first Voyage", in which Ijon Tichy visits Dykhtonia - a civilisation which achieved total corporeal and mental plasticity after a thousand-year rule by ''automorphists'', the local equivalent of [[transhumanism|transhumanists]].
* "The Twenty-second Voyage", in which Ijon Tichy learns of the troubles of evangelising extraterrestrial civilisations.
* "The Twenty-third Voyage", in which Ijon Tichy visits a tiny planet, whose inhabitants save living space by frequently storing themselves as 'atom dust'.
* "The Twenty-fourth Voyage", in which Ijon Tichy visits a civilisation which has assigned all power to a machine to establish planetary harmony. The machine changed them all into shiny discs to be arranged in pleasant patterns across their planet.
* "The Twenty-fifth Voyage"
* "The Twenty-eighth Voyage"

===Memoirs of a Space Traveler: Further Reminiscences of Ijon Tichy===
Translated by [[Joel Stern]] and Maria Swiecicka-Ziemianek
*"The Eighteenth Voyage"
*"The Twenty-fourth Voyage"
*"Further Reminiscences of Ijon Tichy (Parts I-V)"
*"Doctor Diagoras"
*"Let Us Save the Universe (An Open Letter from Ijon Tichy)"
The 2017 [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] edition &lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Memoirs-Space-Traveler-Further-reminiscences-ebook/dp/B073WYYKWK&lt;/ref&gt; contains the first Enflish translation of the following novel:
*"Professor A. Dońda"

===Other stories from elsewhere===
* "Zakład doktora Vliperdiusa" (1964)
* "Pożytek ze smoka" (1993)
* "Ijon Tichy's Last Voyage" (not to be confused with "The Twenty-sixth and Last Voyage"); only published in the German (October 1996) and  Polish (May 1999) editions of ''[[Playboy]]''.

===Never translated in English===
* "{{Interlanguage link multi|The Twenty-sixth and Last Voyage|pl|3=Podróż dwudziesta szósta i ostatnia}}", a pro-Communist satire on [[Cold War]]. In this story, after a confused landing, Ijon finds himself amid an antagonism between two superpowers "Merka" and "Rasha", and recognizes his confusion only standing in front of the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]. The story was never republished after 1957. In the 1971 edition of ''Dzienniki gwiazdowe'', the (fictional) introduction written by [[professor Tarantoga]] explains that, according to the Institute of Tychology, the 26th voyage does not belong to the pen of Ijon Tichy, i.e., it was an [[apocryphal]] tale.
* "Formuła Lymphatera" (1961)

== Adaptations ==

German-language adaptations of several voyages taken by Ijon Tichy exist. In 2001 and 2002, two independent short films were made, running about 15 minutes each, directed by Dennis Jacobsen, Randa Chahoud, and [[Oliver Jahn]] (Jahn also played the main character Ijon Tichy), with [[Nora Tschirner]] starring as the female hologram. Both short films are available as legal downloads from the official site of production company ''Bildwerke Berlin''.{{cn|date=January 2018}} In 2006, the same team produced a miniseries called ''[[Ijon Tichy: Raumpilot]]'' for German TV, with 6 episodes of 15 minutes each again, which premiered March 2007 on [[ZDF]]. A second series of 8 episodes followed in 2011.

"The Fourteenth Voyage" was rendered as an [[animation film]] in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1985. Produced by [[Azerbaijanfilm]] in Russian language, this 10-minute film was titled ''From the Diaries of Ijon Tichy. A Voyage to Interopia'' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Из дневников Ийона Тихого. Путешествие на Интеропию}}). Its screenwriter and director is Russian animator {{ill|Gennady Tischchenko|ru|Тищенко, Геннадий Иванович}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb-title|2401236|From the Diaries of Ijon Tichy.

A '''tradition''' is a [[belief]] or behavior passed down within a group or society with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past.&lt;ref name="Green1997"&gt;{{cite book |author=Thomas A. Green |title=Folklore: an encyclopedia of beliefs, customs, tales, music, and art |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S7Wfhws3dFAC&amp;pg=PA800 |access-date=5 February 2011 |year=1997|publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-0-87436-986-1|pages=800–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shils2006-12"/&gt; Common examples include holidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes (like [[court dress|lawyers' wig]]s or military officers' [[spur]]s), but the idea has also been applied to social norms such as greetings. Traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of years—the word ''tradition'' itself derives from the [[Latin]] ''tradere'' literally meaning to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping. While it is commonly assumed that traditions have ancient history, many traditions have been invented on purpose, whether that be political or cultural, over short periods of time. Various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways.  

The phrase "according to tradition", or "by tradition", usually means that whatever information follows is known only by oral tradition, but is not supported (and perhaps may be refuted) by physical documentation, by a physical artifact, or other quality evidence. ''Tradition'' is used to indicate the quality of a piece of information being discussed. For example, "According to tradition, Homer was born on Chios, but many other locales have historically claimed him as theirs." This tradition may never be proven or disproven. In another example, "[[King Arthur]], by tradition a true British king, has inspired many well loved stories."  Whether they are documented fact or not does not decrease their value as cultural history and literature. 

Traditions are a subject of study in several academic fields, especially in [[social sciences]] such as anthropology, [[archaeology]], and biology.

The concept of tradition, as the notion of holding on to a previous time, is also found in political and philosophical discourse. For example, it is the basis of the political concept of [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalism]], and also strands of many world religions including [[traditional Catholicism]]. In artistic contexts, tradition is used to decide the correct display of an art form. For example, in the performance of traditional genres (such as traditional dance), adherence to guidelines dictating how an art form should be composed are given greater importance than the performer's own preferences. A number of factors can exacerbate the [[loss of tradition]], including industrialization, [[globalization]], and the assimilation or [[marginalization]] of specific cultural groups. In response to this, tradition-preservation attempts have now been started in many countries around the world, focusing on aspects such as traditional languages. Tradition is usually contrasted with the goal of [[modernity]] and should be differentiated from customs, conventions, laws, norms, routines, rules and similar concepts.

==Definition==

The English word ''tradition'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''traditio'', the noun from the verb ''tradere'' (to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping); it was originally used in [[Roman law]] to refer to the concept of legal transfers and [[inheritance]].&lt;ref name="Giddens2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Giddens|title=Runaway world: how globalization is reshaping our lives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KPMtVIsNo-wC&amp;pg=PA39|accessdate=5 February 2011|year=2003|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-94487-8|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Congar2004"/&gt; According to [[Anthony Giddens]] and others, the modern meaning of tradition evolved during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period, in opposition to modernity and [[progress (history)|progress]].&lt;ref name="Giddens2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shils2006-3"&gt;Shils [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-zr1Ovc5ggC&amp;pg=PA3 3–6]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shils2006"&gt;Shils [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-zr1Ovc5ggC&amp;pg=PA3 18]&lt;/ref&gt;

As with many other generic terms, there are many definitions of tradition.&lt;ref name="Green1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shils2006-12"&gt;Shils [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-zr1Ovc5ggC&amp;pg=PA12 12]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Congar2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yves Congar|title=The meaning of tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aBDnQg5zw8oC&amp;pg=PA9|accessdate=5 February 2011|date=October 2004|publisher=Ignatius Press|isbn=978-1-58617-021-9|pages=9–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyer1990-7"/&gt; The concept includes a number of interrelated ideas; the unifying one is that tradition refers to beliefs, objects or customs performed or believed in the past, originating in it, transmitted through time by being taught by one generation to the next, and are performed or believed in the present.&lt;ref name="Green1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shils2006-12"/&gt;

Tradition can also refer to beliefs or customs that are [[prehistory|Prehistoric]], with lost or [[arcane]] origins, existing from ''[[time immemorial]]''.&lt;ref name="Shils2006-15"&gt;Shils [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-zr1Ovc5ggC&amp;pg=PA15 15]&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, traditions were passed orally, without the need for a [[writing system]]. Tools to aid this process include [[figures of speech|poetic devices]] such as [[rhyme]] and [[alliteration]]. The stories thus preserved are also referred to as tradition, or as part of an [[oral tradition]]. Even such traditions, however, are presumed to have originated (been "invented" by humans) at some point.&lt;ref name="Shils2006-12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Giddens2003"/&gt; Traditions are often presumed to be [[ancient]], unalterable, and deeply important, though they may sometimes be much less "natural" than is presumed.&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-2-3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-3-4"/&gt; It is presumed that at least two transmissions over three [[generation]]s are required for a practice, belief or object to be seen as traditional.&lt;ref name="Shils2006-15"/&gt; Some traditions were deliberately invented for one reason or another, often to highlight or enhance the importance of a certain institution.&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-1"&gt;Hobsbawm [https://books.google.com/books?id=sfvnNdVY3KIC&amp;pg=PA1 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Traditions may also be adapted to suit the needs of the day, and the changes can become accepted as a part of the ancient tradition.&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-2-3"&gt;Hobsbawm [https://books.google.com/books?id=sfvnNdVY3KIC&amp;pg=PA2 2–3]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=slang/&gt; Tradition changes slowly, with changes from one generation to the next being seen as significant.&lt;ref name="Shils2006-14"&gt;Shils [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-zr1Ovc5ggC&amp;pg=PA14 14]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, those carrying out the traditions will not be consciously aware of the change, and even if a tradition undergoes major changes over many generations, it will be seen as unchanged.&lt;ref name="Shils2006-14"/&gt;

There are various origins and fields of tradition; they can refer to:

Tradition is often used as an [[adjective]], in contexts such as [[traditional music]], [[traditional medicine]], [[traditional values]] and others.&lt;ref name="Green1997"/&gt; In such constructions tradition refers to specific values and materials particular to the discussed context, passed through generations.&lt;ref name="Giddens2003-39"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Giddens|title=Runaway world: how globalization is reshaping our lives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KPMtVIsNo-wC&amp;pg=PA39|accessdate=5 February 2011|year=2003|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-94487-8|pages=39–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invention of tradition==
{{main article|Invented tradition}}
The term "[[invention of tradition]]", introduced by [[E. J. Hobsbawm]], refers to situations when a new practice or object is introduced in a manner that implies a connection with the past that is not necessarily present.&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-1-2"&gt;Hobsbawm [https://books.google.com/books?id=sfvnNdVY3KIC&amp;pg=PA1 1–2]&lt;/ref&gt;  A tradition may be deliberately created and promulgated for personal, commercial, political, or [[National interest|national self-interest]], as was done in colonial Africa; or it may be adopted rapidly based on a single highly publicized event, rather than developing and spreading organically in a population, as in the case of the white [[wedding dress]], which only became popular after [[Queen Victoria]] wore a white gown at her wedding to [[Albert of Saxe-Coburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ingraham|first=Chrys|title=White Weddings: Romancing Heterosexuality in Popular Culture|year=2008|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-95194-4|pages=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an invention of tradition is the rebuilding of the [[Palace of Westminster]] (location of the [[British Parliament]]) in the [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Gothic style]].&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-1-2"/&gt; Similarly, most of the traditions associated with [[monarchy of the United Kingdom]], seen as rooted deep in history, actually date to 19th century.&lt;ref name=slang/&gt; Other examples include the invention of tradition in Africa and other colonial holdings by the occupying forces.&lt;ref name=invention&gt;[[Terence Ranger]], ''The Invention of Tradition in Colonial Africa'', in {{cite book|author1=E. J. (Eric J.) Hobsbawm| author1-link = E. J. Hobsbawm|author2=T. O. (Terence O.) Ranger| author2-link = Terrence Ranger |title=The Invention of tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sfvnNdVY3KIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA211|accessdate=4 February 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-43773-8|pages=211–263|date=31 July 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Requiring [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]], the [[colonial power]] would often invent a "tradition" which they could use to legitimize their own position. For example, a certain succession to a chiefdom might be recognized by a colonial power as traditional in order to favour their own candidates for the job. Often these inventions were based in some form of tradition, but were exaggerated, distorted, or biased toward a particular interpretation.

Invented traditions are a central component of modern national cultures, providing a commonality of experience and promoting the unified national identity espoused by [[nationalism]].&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-7"&gt;Hobsbawm [https://books.google.com/books?id=sfvnNdVY3KIC&amp;pg=PA7 7]&lt;/ref&gt; Common examples include public holidays (particularly those unique to a particular nation), the singing of national anthems, and traditional national cuisine (see [[national dish]]). [[Expatriate]] and immigrant communities may continue to practice the national traditions of their home nation.

==In scholarly discourse==
In science, tradition is often used in the literature in order to define the relationship of an author's thoughts to that of his or her field.&lt;ref name = Kurz129&gt;Kurz-Milke and Martignon 129&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, philosopher of science Karl Popper suggested that there should be a "rational theory of tradition" applied to science which was fundamentally sociological. For Popper, each scientist who embarks on a certain research trend inherits the tradition of the scientists before them as he or she inherits their studies and any conclusions that superseded it.&lt;ref name = Kurz129/&gt; Unlike [[myth]], which is a means of explaining the natural world through means other than logical criticism, scientific tradition was inherited from Socrates, who proposed critical discussion, according to Popper.&lt;ref name = Kurz129-130&gt;Kurz-Milke and Martignon 129–130&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Thomas Kuhn]], who presented his thoughts in a paper presented in 1977, a sense of such a critical inheritance of tradition is, historically, what sets apart the best scientists who change their fields is an embracement of tradition.&lt;ref name = Kurz129-130/&gt;

Traditions are a subject of study in several academic fields in [[social sciences]]—chiefly anthropology, [[archaeology]], and biology—with somewhat different meanings in different fields. It is also used in varying contexts in other fields, such as history, [[psychology]] and [[sociology]]. Social scientists and others have worked to refine the commonsense concept of tradition to make it into a useful concept for scholarly analysis. In the 1970s and 1980s, [[Edward Shils]] explored the concept in detail.&lt;ref name="Handler and Innekin"/&gt; Since then, a wide variety of social scientists have criticized traditional ideas about tradition; meanwhile, "tradition" has come into usage in biology as applied to nonhuman animals.

Tradition as a concept variously defined in different disciplines should not be confused with various traditions (perspectives, approaches) in those disciplines.&lt;ref name="Patel2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sujata Patel|title=The ISA Handbook of Diverse Sociological Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yWZGj7WghCEC&amp;pg=PA5|accessdate=5 February 2011|date=October 2009|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-84787-402-3|pages=5–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anthropology===
Tradition is one of the key concepts in anthropology; it can be said that anthropology is the study of "tradition in traditional societies".&lt;ref name="Boyer1990-7"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pascal Boyer|title=Tradition as truth and communication: a cognitive description of traditional discourse|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C7cu0joBSM8C&amp;pg=PR7|accessdate=5 February 2011|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-37417-0|pages=7–}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is however no "theory of tradition", as for most anthropologists the need to discuss what tradition is seems unnecessary, as defining tradition is both unnecessary (everyone can be expected to know what it is) and unimportant (as small differences in definition would be just technical).&lt;ref name="Boyer1990-7"/&gt; There are however dissenting views; scholars such as [[Pascal Boyer]] argue that defining tradition and developing theories about it are important to the discipline.&lt;ref name="Boyer1990-7"/&gt;

===Archaeology===
In [[archaeology]], the term ''tradition'' is a set of [[archaeological culture|cultures]] or [[archaeological industry|industries]] which appear to develop on from one another over a period of time. The term is especially common in the study of [[American archaeology]].&lt;ref name="Handler and Innekin" /&gt;

===Biology===
Biologists, when examining groups of non-humans, have observed repeated behaviors which are taught within communities from one generation to the next. Tradition is defined in biology as "a behavioral practice that is relatively enduring (i.e., is performed repeatedly over a period of time), that is shared among two or more members of a group, that depends in part on socially aided learning for its generation in new practitioners", and has been called a precursor to "culture" in the anthropological sense.&lt;ref name = Fragaszy2&gt;Fragaszy and Perry 2, 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioral traditions have been observed in groups of fish, birds, and mammals. Groups of orangutans and chimpanzees, in particular, may display large numbers of behavioral traditions, and in chimpanzees, transfer of traditional behavior from one group to another (not just within a group) has been observed. Such behavioral traditions may have evolutionary significance, allowing adaptation at a faster rate than genetic change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}
In the field of [[musicology]] and [[ethnomusicology]] tradition refers to the belief systems, repertoire, techniques, style and culture that is passed down through subsequent generations. Tradition in music suggests a historical context with which one can perceive distinguishable patterns. Along with a sense of history, traditions have a fluidity that cause them to evolve and adapt over time.
While both musicology and ethnomusicology are defined by being 'the scholarly study of music'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duckles|first=Vincent|title=Musicology.|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/46710pg1|work=Grove Music Online.

===Sociology===
The concept of tradition, in early sociological research (around the turn of the 19th and 20th century), referred to that of the [[traditional society]], as contrasted by the more modern [[industrial society]].&lt;ref name=slang&gt;S. Langlois, Traditions: Social, In: Neil J. Smelser and Paul B. Baltes, Editor(s)-in-Chief, ''International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences'', Pergamon, Oxford, 2001, Pages 15829-15833, {{ISBN|978-0-08-043076-8}}, {{doi|10.1016/B0-08-043076-7/02028-3}}. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B7MRM-4MT09VJ-4PM/2/1eb81ee3e63af98afa7a48ecacfb64a6 Online]&lt;/ref&gt; This approach was most notably portrayed in [[Max Weber]]'s concepts of [[traditional authority]] and modern [[rational-legal authority]].&lt;ref name=slang/&gt; In more modern works, One hundred years later, sociology sees tradition as a [[social construct]] used to contrast past with the present and as a form of [[rationality]] used to justify certain course of action.&lt;ref name=slang/&gt;

Traditional society is characterized by lack of distinction between family and business, [[division of labor]] influenced primarily by age, gender, and status, high position of custom in the system of values, self-sufficiency, preference to saving and accumulation of capital instead of productive investment, relative [[autarky]].&lt;ref name=slang/&gt; Early theories positing the simple, [[unilineal evolution]] of societies from traditional to industrial model are now seen as too simplistic.&lt;ref name=slang/&gt;

In 1981 Edward Shils in his book ''Tradition'' put forward a definition of tradition that became universally accepted.&lt;ref name=slang/&gt; According to Shils, tradition is anything which is transmitted or handed down from the past to the present.&lt;ref name=slang/&gt;

Another important sociological aspect of tradition is the one that relates to rationality. It is also related to the works of Max Weber (see [[Rationality#Theories of rationality|theories of rationality]]), and were popularized and redefined in 1992 by [[Raymond Boudon]] in his book ''Action''.&lt;ref name=slang/&gt; In this context tradition refers to the mode of thinking and action justified as "it has always been that way".&lt;ref name=slang/&gt; This line of reasoning forms the basis of the logical flaw of the [[appeal to tradition]] (or ''argumentum ad antiquitatem''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Texas University |title=Is-Ought fallacy |url=http://www.txstate.edu/philosophy/fallacies/isought.htm |work=Fallacies Definitions |publisher=Texas State University Department of Philosophy |accessdate=2008-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826004350/http://www.txstate.edu/philosophy/fallacies/isought.htm |archivedate=26 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which takes the form "this is right because we've always done it this way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases such an appeal can be refuted on the grounds that the "tradition" being advocated may no longer be desirable, or, indeed, may never have been despite its previous popularity.

===Philosophy===
The idea of tradition is important in philosophy. Twentieth century philosophy is often divided between an 'analytic' tradition, dominant in Anglophone and Scandinavian countries, and a 'continental' tradition, dominant in German and Romance speaking Europe. Increasingly central to continental philosophy is the project of deconstructing what its proponents, following [[Martin Heidegger]], call 'the tradition', which began with [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. In contrast, some continental philosophers - most notably, [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] - have attempted to rehabilitate the tradition of [[Aristotelianism]]. This move has been replicated within analytic philosophy by [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]. However, MacIntyre has himself deconstructed the idea of 'the tradition', instead posing [[Aristotelianism]] as one philosophical tradition in rivalry with others.

==In political and religious discourse==
[[File:Wigilia potrawy 76.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Holiday celebrations may be passed down as traditions, as is the case with this distinctly Polish Christmas meal, decor with [[Christmas tree#Poland|Christmas tree]], a tradition since the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century]]
{{main article|Traditional values|Traditionalist conservatism}}
The concepts of tradition and traditional values are frequently used in political and religious discourse to establish the legitimacy of a particular set of values. In the United States in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the concept of tradition has been used to argue for the centrality and legitimacy of conservative religious values.&lt;ref name="Bronner"/&gt; Similarly, strands of orthodox theological thought from a number of world religions openly identify themselves as wanting a return to tradition. For example, the term "[[traditionalist Catholic]]" refers to those, such as [[Marcel Lefebvre|Archbishop Lefebvre]], who want the worship and practices of the church to be as they were before the [[Second Vatican Council]] of 1962–65.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marty|first=Martin E.|title=Fundamentalisms observed|year=1994|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-50878-8|page=92|author2=R. Scott Appleby }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]] are referred to as ''Ahlus Sunnah wa Al-Jamā‘ah'' ({{lang-ar|أهل السنة والجماعة}}), literally "people of the tradition [of [[Muhammad]]] and the community", emphasizing their attachment to religious and cultural tradition.

More generally, tradition has been used as a way of determining the [[political spectrum]], with [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] parties having a stronger affinity to the ways of the past than [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] ones.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} Here, the concept of adherence tradition is embodied by the political philosophy of traditionalist conservatism (or simply ''traditionalism''), which emphasizes the need for the principles of [[natural law]] and transcendent moral order, [[hierarchy]] and [[organic unity]], [[agrarianism]], [[classicism]] and [[high culture]], and the intersecting spheres of loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Frohnen, Bruce, Jeremy Beer, and Jeffrey O. Nelson, ed. (2006) ''American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia'' Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, pp. 870–875.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionalists would therefore reject the notions of [[individualism]], liberalism, modernity, and [[social progress]], but promote cultural and educational renewal,&lt;ref&gt;Frohnen, Bruce, Jeremy Beer, and Jeffrey O. Nelson, ed. (2006) ''American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia'' Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, p. 870.&lt;/ref&gt; and revive interest in the church, the family, the state and local community. This view has been criticised for including in its notion of tradition practices which are no longer considered to be desirable, for example, stereotypical views of the [[Feminism|place of women in domestic affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Sex Roles|volume=7|issue=2|pages=183–188|doi=10.1007/BF00287804|title=Feminists and traditionalists: An attitudinal comparison|author=M. Dwayne Smith|author2=George D. Self |year=1981|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/r8122k666286p664/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other societies, especially ones experiencing rapid social change, the idea of what is "traditional" may be widely contested, with different groups striving to establish their own values as the legitimate traditional ones. Defining and enacting traditions in some cases can be a means of building unity between subgroups in a diverse society; in other cases, tradition is a means of [[othering]] and keeping groups distinct from one another.&lt;ref name="Bronner"/&gt;

==In artistic discourse==
In artistic contexts, in the performance of traditional genres (such as [[traditional dance]]), adherence to traditional guidelines is of greater importance than performer's preferences.&lt;ref name="Green1997"/&gt; It is often the unchanging form of certain arts that leads to their perception as traditional.&lt;ref name="Green1997"/&gt; For artistic endeavors, tradition has been used as a contrast to ''[[creativity]]'', with traditional and [[folk art]] associated with unoriginal imitation or repetition, in contrast to [[fine art]], which is valued for being original and unique. More recent philosophy of art, however, considers interaction with tradition as integral to the development of new artistic expression.&lt;ref name="Bronner"/&gt;

==Relationship to other concepts==
In the social sciences, ''tradition'' is often contrasted with ''modernity'', particularly in terms of whole societies. This dichotomy is generally associated with a linear model of social change, in which societies progress from being traditional to being modern.&lt;ref name="Gusfield"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tradition-oriented societies have been characterized as valuing [[filial piety]], harmony and group welfare, stability, and [[interdependence]], while a society exhibiting modernity would value "individualism (with free will and choice), mobility, and progress."&lt;ref name="Bronner"&gt;Bronner, Simon J. "Tradition" in ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences''. Ed. William A. Darity, Jr.. Vol. 8. 2nd ed. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2008. p420-422.&lt;/ref&gt; Another author discussing tradition in relationship to modernity, Anthony Giddens, sees tradition as something bound to ritual, where ritual guarantees the continuation of tradition.&lt;ref name = Giddens&gt;Giddens, "Living in a Post-Traditional Society" 64&lt;/ref&gt; Gusfield and others, though, criticize this dichotomy as oversimplified, arguing that tradition is dynamic, heterogeneous, and coexists successfully with modernity even within individuals.&lt;ref name="Gusfield"/&gt;

Tradition should be differentiated from ''customs, [[Convention (norm)|conventions]], laws, [[Norm (sociology)|norms]], routines, rules'' and similar concepts. Whereas tradition is supposed to be invariable, they are seen as more flexible and subject to innovation and change.&lt;ref name="Green1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-2-3"/&gt; Whereas justification for tradition is [[ideology|ideological]], the justification for other similar concepts is more practical or technical.&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-3-4"&gt;Hobsbawm [https://books.google.com/books?id=sfvnNdVY3KIC&amp;pg=PA3 3–4]&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, customs, routines, conventions, rules and such can evolve into traditions, but that usually requires that they stop having (primarily) a practical purpose.&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-3-4"/&gt; For example, wigs worn by lawyers were at first common and fashionable; [[spur]]s worn by military officials were at first practical but now are both impractical and traditional.&lt;ref name="HobsbawmRanger-3-4"/&gt;

==Preservation==
[[File:GOOD SHABBES -.jpg|thumb|Woman welcoming the [[Shabbat#Welcoming Sabbath|Shabbat]], a more than 3300 year old tradition.]]

In many countries, concerted attempts are being made to preserve traditions that are at risk of being lost. A number of factors can exacerbate the loss of tradition, including industrialization, [[globalization]], and the [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] or [[marginalization]] of specific cultural groups.&lt;ref name="UVic"&gt;{{cite book|last=McIntosh|first=Tracey|title=New Zealand identities: departures and destinations |year=2005 |publisher=Victoria University Press |location=Wellington, N.Z.|isbn=0-86473-517-0|editor=James H. Liu|page=40|chapter=Maori Identities: Fixed, Fluid, Forced}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customary celebrations and lifestyles are among the traditions that are sought to be preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.presstv.ir/detail/162937.html |title=PressTV&amp;nbsp;– Iran plans to preserve Nowruz traditions |work=presstv.ir |date=31 January 2011 |accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/03/11/bahrain.pearling.industry/index.html |title=Bahrain seeks to preserve ancient pearling traditions |publisher=CNN |date=11 March 2010 |accessdate=5 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the concept of tradition has been used to defend the preservation and reintroduction of minority languages such as [[Cornish language|Cornish]] under the auspices of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/6554120/Cornish-street-signs-to-be-translated.html|accessdate=6 February 2010|title=Cornish street signs to be translated|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |author=Richard Savill|date=12 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the charter holds that these languages "contribute to the maintenance and development of Europe's cultural wealth and traditions". The Charter goes on to call for "the use or adoption... of traditional and correct forms of place-names in regional or minority languages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/148.htm|title=European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages|date=5 November 1992|accessdate=6 February 2010|publisher=[[Council of Europe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[UNESCO]] includes both "oral tradition" and "traditional manifestations" in its definition of a country's cultural properties and heritage. It therefore works to preserve tradition in countries such as Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/en/brasilia/culture-in-brazil/world-heritage-in-brazil/|title=World Heritage in Brazil |publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]], certain artworks, structures, craft techniques and performing arts are considered by the Japanese government to be a precious legacy of the Japanese people, and are protected under the Japanese Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties.&lt;ref name="ACA"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.bunka.go.jp/bunkazai/pamphlet/pdf/pamphlet_en_03.pdf| title =Cultural Properties for Future Generations| date =June 2007| work =Administration of Cultural Affairs in Japan ― Fiscal 2009| publisher =[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]]| format =PDF| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090327083232/http://www.bunka.go.jp/bunkazai/pamphlet/pdf/pamphlet_en_03.pdf| archivedate =27 March 2009| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law also identifies people skilled at traditional arts as "[[Living National Treasure (Japan)|National Living Treasures]]", and encourages the preservation of their craft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://articles.sfgate.com/1999-05-30/books/17688560_1_living-treasures-art-works-authors |title=Treasures of Japan&amp;nbsp;– Its Living Artists|work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=30 May 1999 |accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For native peoples like the [[Māori people|Māori]] in New Zealand, there is conflict between the fluid identity assumed as part of modern society and the traditional identity with the obligations that accompany it; the loss of language heightens the feeling of isolation and damages the ability to perpetuate tradition.&lt;ref name="UVic"/&gt;

==Traditional cultural expressions==

The phrase "traditional cultural expressions" is used by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] to refer to "any form of artistic and literary expression in which traditional culture and knowledge are embodied. They are transmitted from one generation to the next, and include handmade textiles, paintings, stories, legends, ceremonies, music, songs, rhythms and dance."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf|title=ENGAGING - A Guide to Interacting Respectfully and Reciprocally with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People, and their Arts Practices and Intellectual Property|author=[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] et al|publisher=Australian Government: Indigenous Culture Support|year=2015|p=7|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330114112/http://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf|archivedate=30 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Youth Without Youth''''' is a 2007 [[fantasy film|fantasy]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written and directed by [[Francis Ford Coppola]], based on the [[Youth Without Youth (novella)|novella of the same name]] by [[Romania]]n author [[Mircea Eliade]]. The film is a co-production between the [[United States]], [[Romania]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[Germany]]. It was the first film that Coppola had directed in ten years, since 1997's ''[[The Rainmaker (1997 film)|The Rainmaker]]''. It was distributed through [[Sony Pictures Classics]] in the United States (where it was released on December 14, 2007) and by [[Pathé]] in the [[UK]] and [[France]]. The music was composed by [[Grammy Award]]-winning [[Argentina|Argentinian]] classical composer [[Osvaldo Golijov]]. In an interview, Coppola said that he made the film as a meditation on time and on consciousness, which he considers a "changing tapestry of illusion", but he stated that the film may also be appreciated as a beautiful love story, or as a mystery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italiansrus.com/pr/interview_coppola.htm |title=Interview With Francis Ford Coppola |work=Italiansrus.com |accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In 1938, Dominic Matei ([[Tim Roth]]), a 70-year-old professor of linguistics, pining after the love of his youth, Laura ([[Alexandra Maria Lara]]), travels to Bucharest, the city where he and she met at university. Feeling that his fruitless search for the origin of human language has condemned him to a solitary, wasted life, Dominic is intent on committing suicide after this one last journey. However, while crossing the street, he is abruptly yet non-lethally struck by lightning. In hospital, Professor Stanciulescu ([[Bruno Ganz]]) informs Dominic that, much to both their surprises, the lighting appears to have regenerated him into a much younger man. Soon after, while residing at the Professor's home, Dominic also discovers that he possesses strange, psychic capacities.

As Romania is invaded by Nazi Germany, Doktor Josef Rudolf ([[André Hennicke]]) begins to show an interest in Stanciulescu's miracle patient. Since Dominic's budding powers have blurred his perception of reality, he is bamboozled into mistaking a Nazi spy known only as the Woman in Room Six for an erotic fantasy, who discovers during their nights together that he has developed a talent for speaking in tongues. Meanwhile, an alternate persona, invisible to human eyes, presents itself to Dominic as his "Other" from outside space and time. When Dominic asks for proof, the "Other" obliges by bringing him two roses out of nowhere. Unbeknownst to Dominic, Stanciulescu has witnessed the event and overhears his friend ask himself, "Where do you want me to put the third rose?" Understanding the Nazis' designs, Stanciulescu persuades Dominic to escape from Romania.

Living like a spy, Dominic eventually winds up in Switzerland towards the end of the war, where he is confronted by Doktor Rudolf at gunpoint in an alleyway. Rudolf argues that Dominic's existence supports the Nazis' ideal of the superman, and that the coming nuclear conflicts can only be survived by a superior species of man. In the background, the "Other" confirms this to be the case. However, in refusing to cooperate, Dominic manifests telekinetic powers which manipulate Rudolf into shooting himself. Subsequently, Dominic returns to a normal existence and resumes his linguistic research. Having realised that the lightning strike has partially lent him the capacities and knowledge of future humanity, he develops a secret language for his audio diary, to be deciphered long after the nuclear apocalypse.

Many years later, Dominic encounters a woman named Veronica ([[Alexandra Maria Lara]]) while hiking in the Alps. The "Other" reveals her to be the reincarnation of Laura. When the mountains are hit by a violent thunderstorm, Dominic rushes to her rescue and finds her chanting in Sanskrit, which he greets her with to gain her trust. During her stay in hospital, Veronica now identifies herself as "Rupini", one of the first disciples of the [[Buddha]]. Suspecting she may now be afflicted with a condition similar to his own, Dominic calls the Roman College of Oriental Studies for aid, who inform him that Rupini's last act in life was to retire into a cave for meditation on Enlightenment. Since the cave's location is unknown, the scholars, led by Professor [[Giuseppe Tucci]] ([[Marcel Iures]]), agree to fund an expedition to find it in India, hoping Veronica's past self will guide them. The venture proves a success when a local Boddhisatva recognises "Rupini" and directs her to the place of meditation. Following this discovery, Veronica becomes herself again and falls for Dominic.

The couple elope to Malta, where for a time, they live happily together, until Dominic tells Veronica in her sleep that he has always loved her. This causes Veronica to writhe in bed as if possessed and begin chanting a language even he does not understand. The "Other" explains that she is speaking in ancient Egyptian, having travelled further back along the path of her past selves. For the next two weeks, Dominic learns how to control this state in Veronica, leading her to regress ever further in time and speak previously unknown tongues. However, Veronica's health begins to decline from exhaustion, and Dominic declares that he cannot continue these sessions, or even being close to Veronica, since his proximity to her is accelerating her age. Over the objections of both Veronica and the "Other", he leaves.

Despairing, Dominic returns to the town where he taught as a professor. His alter ego appears to him in a miror and reveals the future of mankind; nuclear warfare will unleash an electromagnetic pulse, giving birth to a new, powerful human species, of which Dominic is but the first member. Veronica symbolised the dawn of man, and he stood for the dusk. Outraged at the idea of sacrificing millions of lives in the name of evolution, Dominic shatters the mirror, causing the "Other" to vanish, yelling incoherently in an unfamiliar language. In the morning, townsfolk find Dominic's body, lying dead at the bottom of a staircase. As Veronica's voice is heard echoing "Where do you want me to put the third rose?", the rose appears in Dominic's lifeless grasp.

==Reception==
===Box office===
''Youth Without Youth'' grossed $244,397 in North America and $2.4 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $2.6 million.&lt;ref name=BOM /&gt;

===Critical response===
On [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 31% based on 103 reviews, with an [[average rating]] of 4.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Although visually appealing, Coppola's latest film mixes too many genres with a very confusing plot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/youth_without_youth/ |title=''Youth Without Youth'' (2007) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (website)|Fandango]] |accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 43 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/youth-without-youth |title=''Youth Without Youth'' Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave it high praise, writing, "In this film Mr. Coppola blurs dreams and everyday life and suggests that through visual and narrative experimentation he has begun the search for new ways of making meaning, new holy places for him and for us.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/14/movies/14yout.html |title=Youth Without Youth - Movie - Review |first=Manohla |last=Dargis |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', however, was "disappointed" by the "mishmash plotting" and "stilted script".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Weissberg |first=Jay |url=https://variety.com/2007/film/awards/youth-without-youth-2-1200555232/ |title=Youth Without Youth |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=20 October 2007 |accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rex Reed]] panned the film, writing, "You know a movie is doomed when the only star in it is Tim Roth. You know it's pretentious when the ads print the logo backward and upside down. Not one word of this bilge makes one lick of sense, and it is two hours and six minutes long. The only way to survive ''Youth Without Youth'' is dead drunk." [[Roger Ebert]] of the [[Chicago Sun-Times]] gave the film one-and-a-half out of four stars, stating that "[t]here is such a thing as a complex film that rewards additional viewing and study, but "Youth Without Youth," I am afraid, is no more than it seems: a confusing slog through metaphysical murkiness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=Youth Without Youth|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/youth-without-youth-2007|website=RogerEbert.com|publisher=Ebert Digital LLC|accessdate=2 August 2016|date=20 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Scout Tafoya of ''[[RogerEbert.com]]'' included the film in his video series "The Unloved", where he highlights films which received mixed to negative reviews that he believes to have artistic value. He stated that Coppola "made a film he would have wanted to see, with energy borrowed from his heroes. But this film is all him, really. What other major American director would throw out studio money just to scamper around Europe re-living the years of his father's prime? .... I saw the human struggling to change the world through his work, and the ways in which he failed himself, and I felt for him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tafoya|first1=Scout|title=The Unloved, Part 32: "Youth Without Youth" |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/mzs/the-unloved-part-32-youth-without-youth|website=RogerEbert.com |publisher=Ebert Digital LLC |accessdate=2 August 2016 |date=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was nominated for Best Cinematography at the [[23rd Independent Spirit Awards|2008 Independent Spirit Awards]].
