{{Xi Jinping sidebar}}
The '''2015 state visit of Xi Jinping to the United States''', which was from September 22 to 28, 2015, was the [[state visit]] of [[China]]'s [[paramount leader]] [[Xi Jinping]] to the [[United States]]. It was his seventh visit to the United States and his first visit after succeeding the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] in 2012. During the period of the visit, Xi attended the US–China Internet Industry Forum, visited the [[White House]] and met [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Barack Obama]], and attended the 70th anniversary of the [[United Nations]].

==Background==
Xi's visit occurred at a time of high tensions in [[China-US relations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[David Shambaugh]] |script-title=zh:從習近平訪美觀察中美關係的十大指標 |url=http://www.nanzao.com/tc/international/14ff4b37318fb11/shen-da-wei-cong-xi-jin-ping-fang-mei-guan-cha-zhong-mei-guan-xi-di-shi-da-zhi-biao |newspaper=[[South China Morning Post]] |language=Chinese |accessdate=September 26, 2015 |date=September 23, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150926164353/http://www.nanzao.com/tc/international/14ff4b37318fb11/shen-da-wei-cong-xi-jin-ping-fang-mei-guan-cha-zhong-mei-guan-xi-di-shi-da-zhi-biao |archivedate=September 26, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Wall Street Journal]] quoted experts who said Xi's US visit was to promote local technology companies and to ask the US government to not retaliate in response to accusations regarding the People's Republic of China having engaged in hacking activities, but Beijing has repeatedly denied the allegations of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China Seeks Out Unlikely Ally: U.S. Tech Firms|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-seeks-out-unlikely-ally-u-s-tech-firms-1442808042|accessdate=January 4, 2015|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=September 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese Foreign Minister [[Wang Yi (politician)|Wang Yi]] said Xi's visit was to promote trust between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=习近平今天开启访美行程 西雅图准备热情迎接|url=http://world.huanqiu.com/exclusive/2015-09/7541077.html|accessdate=September 26, 2015|newspaper=[[Global Times]]|language=Chinese|date=September 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before this visit, the United States [[Congressional-Executive Commission on China]] held a hearing on human rights. Experts and members of Congress in attendance called on President Obama to ask Xi Jinping to stop the persecution of [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]], [[Uyghurs]], religious groups, [[non-governmental organizations]], intellectuals, democracy advocates, and supporters of "universal suffrage" in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Urging China's President Xi To Stop State-Sponsored Human Rights Abuses|url=http://www.cecc.gov/events/hearings/urging-china's-president-xi-to-stop-state-sponsored-human-rights-abuses|publisher=Congressional-Executive Commission on China|date=September 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xi had previously visited the United States six times. His first visit was as part of a corn industry delegation to the state of [[Iowa]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Name-card from Xi Jinping's first visit to US 30 years ago goes viral|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/1860256/name-card-xi-jinpings-first-visit-us-goes-viral|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=September 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most recent visit in 2013 was informal, in which he went to [[Sunnylands]] in [[California]], and met with US President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=给留学生寄贺卡、老友叙旧：回顾习近平6次访美|url=http://news.qq.com/a/20150917/069937.htm?qqcom_pgv_from=aio|publisher=qq.com|date=September 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==

===September 22: Arrival at Seattle and Speech Giving===
On September 22, 2015, [[Xi Jinping]], and his wife, [[Peng Liyuan]], arrived at [[Paine Field]] and stepped off an [[Air China]] aircraft at about 9:30 am (Pacific Daylight Time). Before his arrival at the [[Westin Hotels &amp; Resorts|Westin Seattle Hotel]], protesters gathered downtown to highlight the Chinese government's human rights abuses and to voice other concerns, including [[Falun Gong]] practitioners. Supporters of Xi were also present with Chinese flags. The protesters dispersed by 6:00 pm.&lt;ref name="Day1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Live updates from Xi visit: Xi greeted by supporters, protesters upon arrival in Seattle |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/business/chinas-president-xi-arriving-this-morning/|newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=September 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the evening, Xi attended a banquet speech at the Westin Seattle Hotel, meeting with Governor of Washington State Jay Inslee, Mayor of Seattle Ed Murray, Senator Patty Murray, Congressman Rick Larsen, and former US Ambassador to China Gary Locke. In his speech, he mentioned several contentious issues in China–US relations, including on [[cybersecurity]] and China's economy.

He also talked about his teenage years working on a farm in [[Yanchuan County]], Shaanxi, China, during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. He linked this to the [[Chinese Dream]], an individual work ethic which would strengthen the Chinese nation as a whole. Xi reiterated that China is against [[currency war]]s and will not lower the [[renminbi]] rate to boost exports.&lt;ref name="Day1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="economic reforms"&gt;{{cite news|title=Xi Jinping says China open to foreign business amid economic reforms |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-34332843|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the topic of his [[Anti-corruption campaign in China|anti-corruption]] reforms, Xi said, "It has nothing to do with a power struggle. In this case, there's no ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]''" &amp;ndash; a reference to the [[Netflix]] political drama, which tops the list of most illegally downloaded shows in China.&lt;ref name="Day1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=He said what?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3502">'''Abdul Rashid''' ({{lang-ar| عبد الرشيد}}) is a male Muslim given name, and in modern usage, surname. It is built from the Arabic words ''[[Abd (Arabic)|Abd]]'', ''[[al-]]'' and ''[[Rashid (name)|Rashid]]''. The name means "servant of the right-minded", ''Ar-Rashīd'' being one of the [[names of God in the Qur'an]], which give rise to the [[List of Arabic theophoric names|Muslim theophoric names]].&lt;ref name=ahmed&gt;{{cite book| title=A Dictionary of Muslim Names| author=Salahuddin Ahmed| publisher = Hurst &amp; Company| location=London| year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rahman&gt;{{cite book| title=A Dictionary of Muslim Names| author= S. A. Rahman| publisher=Goodword Books|  location=New Delhi| year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter ''a'' of the ''al-'' is unstressed, and can be transliterated by almost any vowel, often by ''u''. Because the letter ''r'' is a [[sun and moon letters|sun letter]], the letter ''l'' of the ''al-'' is assimilated to it. Thus although the name is written in Arabic with letters corresponding to ''Abd al-Rashid'', the usual pronunciation corresponds to ''Abd ar-Rashid''. Alternative transliterations include ''‘Abd ar-Rasheed'' and others, all subject to variable spacing and hyphenation. 

The closely related name '''Abdel Raashid''' ({{lang-ar| عبد الراشد}}) is difficult to distinguish from the other in transliteration.

==Presidency==
[[File:Seal of the President of Nigeria.svg|thumb|right|[[Seal of the President of Nigeria|Seal of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria]] ]]
Nigeria had been ruled by military leaders since [[Muhammadu Buhari]] seized power from [[Shehu Shagari]] in a 1983 coup.&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ni.html |title=Nigeria |accessdate=9 June 2007 |date=31 May 2007 |work=The [[World Factbook]] Online |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gSwE0b5H?url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ni.html |archivedate=2 May 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although democratic elections had been held in 1993, they were annulled by General Ibrahim Babangida. Reported to have had an initial reluctance to accepting the position,&lt;ref name=on/&gt; Abubakar was sworn in as president on 9 June 1998 after the unexpected death of Abacha. He declared a weeklong period of national mourning.&lt;ref name=ifex&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifex.org/alerts/layout/set/print/content/view/full/6444/ |title=Successor to General Sani Abacha appointed |accessdate=7 June 2007 |date=9 June 1998 |work=IFEX Alerts |publisher=[[International Freedom of Expression Exchange]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005145336/http://www.ifex.org/alerts/layout/set/print/content/view/full/6444/ |archivedate=5 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days after assuming office, Abubakar promised to hold elections within a year and transfer power to an elected president.&lt;ref name=cia/&gt;
He established the [[Independent National Electoral Commission]] (INEC), appointing former Supreme Court Justice [[Ephraim Akpata]] as chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |archivedate=15 February 2011 
 |deadurl=no 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The INEC held a series of elections first for Local Government Areas in December 1998, then for State Assemblies and Governors, National Assemblies and finally for the President on 27 February 1999. Although efforts were made to ensure that the elections were free and fair, there were widespread irregularities that drew criticism from foreign observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Surprising some critics of the country's military,&lt;ref name=on/&gt; Abubakar kept his word and transferred power to elected president Obasanjo on 29 May 1999. During his administration Nigeria adopted a new constitution May 5, 1999, which went into effect when [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] became president.&lt;ref name=cia/&gt;

==Legacy==
Abubakar's legacy is mixed. A lecture circuit at [[Chicago State University]] in Chicago, Illinois, United States featuring him encountered opposition, because he had supported Abacha's government.&lt;ref name=ncp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nigeriaworld.com/letters/2001/feb/182pr.html |title= NCP, North America, protests Abdulsalami Lecture Series|accessdate=7 June 2007 |work= |publisher=[[National Conscience Party]]|last= Akande|first=Laolu |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225521/http://nigeriaworld.com/letters/2001/feb/182pr.html  |archivedate = 27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Abacha's administration was notorious for its [[human rights in Nigeria|human rights]] abuses).&lt;ref name=ncp/&gt;&lt;ref name=hour&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/africa/july-dec98/nigeria_10-21.html |title=Interview with Abubakar |accessdate=7 June 2007 |date=21 October 1998 |work=Online News Hour |publisher=[[MacNeil/Lehrer Productions]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wWgPLzGl?url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/africa/july-dec98/nigeria_10-21.html |archivedate=15 February 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also sued in that country by other Nigerians who claimed he was responsible for the death of 1993 president-elect [[Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola]], who died in custody after being prevented by the military from taking office, and for the violation of the rights of others during his administration.&lt;ref name=td&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisdayonline.com/nview.php?id=80050 |last=Aboyade |first=Funke |title='Conflicting Court Orders in Abdulsalami Case Avoidable' |accessdate=7 June 2007 |work=Thisday Online |publisher=Leaders &amp; Company Limited |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wWgQZhKX?url=http://www.thisdayonline.com/nview.php?id=80050 |archivedate=15 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abubakar helped in the Liberian peace movement by presiding over the 2003 peace talks between Charles Taylor and the opposing rebels. This is seen in the movie ''Pray the Devil Back to Hell''.

==Personal life==
Abubakar is married to Fati and they have six children together.&lt;ref name=on&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlinenigeria.com/people/ad.asp?blurb=64 |title=Abdulsalami Abubakar |accessdate=7 June 2007 |work=Online Nigeria |publisher=Devace Nigeria |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wWgNAHmQ?url=http://www.onlinenigeria.com/people/ad.asp?blurb=64 |archivedate=15 February 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7182">'''Antonio Vallejo-Nájera''' (1889–1960) was a Spanish psychiatrist.
== Early life ==

Vallejo-Nájera was born in [[Paredes de Nava]] in 1889. He studied medicine at the [[University of Valladolid]] and joined the army’s sanitary corps in 1910, taking part in the [[Rif War]] between 1912 and 1915. During [[World War I]] he was posted to the military department at the Spanish Embassy in [[Berlin]]. There he met well-known figures of German Psychiatry such as Gruhle, Schwalb and [[Kraepelin]]. He also conducted inspections of prisoner of war concentration camps, an activity for which he was awarded medals by Belgium and France after the war. On returning to Spain he worked at the Ciempozuelos Military Psychiatric Clinic. When the Civil War broke out he was a teacher of Psychiatry in the Military Sanitary Academy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychologyinspain.com/content/full/1997/1frame.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Vallejo Nájera promoted in Spain a personal notion of [[eugenics]], intending to reconcile German doctrines of [[racial hygiene]] from authors like Schwalb with the requirements of [[Catholic]] moral doctrine, opposed to state-imposed measures of eugenic restriction. He advocated ''eugamia'', a eugenic policy implemented through premarital orientation work based on the biopsychological assessment of a couple’s personality.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychologyinspain.com/content/full/1997/1frame.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spanish Civil War and Francoist repression==
During the [[Spanish Civil War]] he supported the [[National faction (Spanish Civil War)|nationalists]]. In 1938, he set up the ''Gabinete de Investigaciones Psicológicas de la Inspección de Campos de Concentración de Prisioneros de Guerra'' (Psychological Research Bureau of Inspection of Prisoner of War Concentration Camps), a center for psychological investigations. The bureau was established near the San Pedro de Cardeña concentration camp and had fourteen clinics in the nationalist zone. Vallejo Najera carried out experiments on female [[Spanish Republican Army]] and [[International Brigades]] prisoners to establish "the bio-psychic roots of [[Marxism]]" and find the "red gene".&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Paul. ''The Spanish civil war. Reaction, revolution &amp; revenge.'' Harper Perennial. 2006. London. p.310&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychologyinspain.com/content/full/1997/1frame.htm&lt;/ref&gt; For Vallejo Najera, Marxists were genetic retards&lt;ref&gt;Tremlett, Giles. ''Ghosts of Spain.'' Faber and Faber. London. 2006. p.63&lt;/ref&gt; and Marxism was a mental illness: "A priori, it seems probable that psychopaths of all types would join the Marxist ranks... Since Marxism goes together with social immorality... we presume those fanatics who fought with arms will show schizoid temperaments".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/01/spain.gilestremlett&lt;/ref&gt;

Vallejo’s conclusions were that the only way to prevent the racial dissolution of the Spanish was to take away the ''red'' children from their mothers in places "away from [[Democracy|democratic]] environments and where the exaltation of [[Scientific racism|bio-psychic racial qualities]] is encouraged".&lt;ref&gt;Tremlett, Giles. ''Ghosts of Spain.'' Faber and Faber. London. 2006. p.63&lt;/ref&gt; By 1943, 12,043 children had been taken from their mothers and handed over to orphanages or Francoist families,&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, Antony. ''The Battle for Spain; The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939'' Penguin books. London. 2006. p.407&lt;/ref&gt; but the number of children taken away from their parents may be closer to 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-30000-lost-children-of-the-franco-years-are-set-to-be-saved-from-oblivion-2173996.html&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, many children evacuated by the Republic to France, England and elsewhere, were forced to return against the will of their parents.&lt;ref&gt;Tremlett, Giles. ''Ghosts of Spain.'' Faber and Faber. London. 2006. p.63&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases birth records were destroyed&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/world/europe/01franco.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the children's names changed&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5802820.ece&lt;/ref&gt; in order to prevent any further contact with their parents.

Vallejo Najera contributed to the justification of the Francoist post-war repression. He said that the ''[[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|reds]]'' should: "suffer the punishment they deserve, with death the easiest of them all. Some will live in permanent [[exile]]... Others will lose their freedom, groaning for years in prisons, purging their crimes with forced work in order to earn their daily bread...".&lt;ref&gt;Tremlett, Giles. ''Ghosts of Spain.'' Faber and Faber. London. 2006. pp.61-62&lt;/ref&gt; According to Paul Preston the "investigations" of Vallejo-Najera provided the Francoist State with "scientific" arguments in order to "justify their views on the subhuman nature of their adversaries".&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Paul. ''The Spanish civil war. Reaction, revolution &amp; revenge.'' Harper Perennial. 2006. London. p.310&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Spanish psychiatrist Carlos Castillo del Pino: "For Vallejo Nagera, reds were degenerates and if they were allowed to breed they would enfeeble the Spanish race. Therefore, they had to be exterminated."&lt;ref&gt;http://vimeo.com/26232645&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life==
When the Civil War ended, Vallejo's support for Francoism was rewarded by his appointment as Professor of Psychiatry at the [[Complutense University of Madrid|University of Madrid]]. "He became one of the most influential figures in Spanish Psychiatry and Psychology in the forties and fifties: his name is among the 16 founders of the Spanish Psychological Society."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychologyinspain.com/content/full/1997/1frame.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychologyinspain.com/content/full/1997/1frame.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boman Irani''' (born 2 December 1959) is an [[India]]n film and theatre actor, voice artist and photographer of [[Irani (India)|Irani]] descent. He is widely known for his comedic and villain roles in [[Bollywood]] films such as ''[[Don (2006 Hindi film)|Don]]'', ''[[Munna Bhai MBBS]]'', ''[[3 Idiots]]'', ''[[Happy New Year (2014 film)|Happy New Year]]'', ''[[PK (film)|PK]]'' and ''[[Dilwale (2015 film)|Dilwale]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news18.com/news/movies/i-borrow-from-real-life-people-for-my-characters-says-boman-irani-1600431.html|title=I Borrow From Real-life People For My Characters, Says Boman Irani|work=News18|access-date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Irani was born on 2 December 1959, in [[Mumbai]]. He finished his schooling in [[St. Mary's School, Mumbai|St. Mary's School]], Mumbai. Irani was [[dyslexic]] and had [[ADHD]] and had a lisp.&lt;ref name="josh"&gt;{{cite web|title=Josh talks - Boman Irani|url=https://www.youtube.com|website=www.youtube.com|publisher=Josh talks|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He overcame his lisp eventually. He undertook a two-year waiter course at [[Mithibai College]] in Mumbai. After his polytechnic diploma course, he joined the [[Taj Mahal Palace &amp; Tower]] and worked there as a [[waiter]] and in room service.&lt;ref name=Hindustantimes1&gt;{{cite web|title=Boman Irani gets candid|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Boman-Irani-gets-candid/Article1-527275.aspx|work=Hindustan Times|accessdate=20 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110121104012/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Boman-Irani-gets-candid/Article1-527275.aspx|archivedate=21 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted and finally worked as a waiter at the rooftop French restaurant, Rendezvous. He worked at the Taj Mahal for two years.&lt;ref name="josh" /&gt;

==Career as a boxing photographer==
While he was at school, he would watch movies daily at the Alexander Cinema daily after school. His mother often encouraged him to watch the movies repeatedly, to observe their cinematography and art.&lt;ref name="josh" /&gt; Irani's father died three months before Irani was born, but had a farsan-making shop, which his mother took over thereafter. Irani also worked at this shop on Grant Road till he was 32 years old. This ancestral bakery and farsan shop was located in the [[Grant Road|Grant road]] area of Mumbai, between Novelty and Apsara Cinemas, and was also where he first met his wife.&lt;ref name="josh" /&gt;

While working at the Taj, using the tips that he received, Irani bought a camera and took sports pictures (school cricket and football matches), selling them for twenty to thirty rupees, which he continued till well after marriage.&lt;ref name="josh" /&gt; His epiphany came when he saved money for seven years to take his family for their first ever vacation to [[Ooty]], but they ended up in a desolate run-down hotel called Shawham Palace. Irani decided to take control of his life, and instead of living the petty existence of a photographer selling small photos, he would started to dream and live big and provide more for his family. Irani calls it his "zero number bulb moment".&lt;ref name=TheGenXTimes&gt;{{cite web|title=From waiter to a rising star: Boman Irani|url=http://www.thegenxtimes.com/editorials/from-waiter-to-a-rising-star-boman-irani/|work=The GenX Times|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irani continued to be a photographer, but now at the age of 32, went six months prior to the world boxing championships at Mumbai to meet Adajania, the then president of the Olympic boxing association of India, and requested to become the official photographer of the World Cup. When Adajania told him there was no need for him, Irani offered to work at his office for six months for free in return for a ring-side badge to cover the event. He continued to try to convince Adajania, and covered a state boxing match in a different manner than other photographers. Adajania was impressed by his photos and his passion and appointed Irani as the official photographer.&lt;ref name="josh" /&gt;

Meanwhile, he became the photographer for the Norwegian boxing team and photographed specific photos that they needed of [[Ole Klemetsen]]. When asked about his charges, Irani asked for the international rate. Irani took the required photos with his [[Pentax K1000|K-1000]].&lt;ref name="josh" /&gt;

==Career==
Irani began his acting career in theatre and moved to films in 2000. Irani gained attention for his role in the 2003 comedy ''[[Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.]]''. He later appeared in ''[[Lage Raho Munna Bhai]]'' for which he received several [[International Indian Film Academy|IIFA]] award nominations and in ''[[3 Idiots]]'' opposite [[Aamir khan]] which earned him a [[Filmfare Award]] and a [[Star Screen Award]] for Best Actor in a Villainous Role.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Theatre career===
Acting had been a passion to Irani during school and college days. He trained under acting coach Hansraj Siddhia from 1981 to 1983 and adopted professional acting methods.

Irani's mentor was [[Alyque Padamsee]] — the veteran theatre actor best known for his role as [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah]] in ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]''. He was introduced to Padamsee by [[Shiamak Davar]].&lt;ref name=Hindustantimes1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The making of an actor |url=http://bomanirani.com/bi_theat.htm |publisher=Bomanirani.com|accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irani's earliest theatrical appearance was in ''Roshni'' where he played a cameo at the Regional Theatre in [[Versova, Mumbai|Versova]]. He followed this up with serials like ''Family Ties'' and ''Mahatma vs Gandhi'', playing [[Gandhi]] after the role was turned down by [[Darshan Jariwala]]. His most illustrious play to date is ''I am not Bajirao'' which ran for 10&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=Hindustantimes1/&gt;

===Film career===
Irani started out in a number of advertisements such as [[Fanta]], [[CEAT Limited|Ceat]] and Krackjack biscuits (as Mr. Jack of the Krack and Jack duo).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bomanirani.com/bi_ads.htm |title=Actor – Ad Films – India |publisher=Boman Irani |date= |accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His small but significant role in ''[[Darna Mana Hai]]'' earned him acclaim. The film didn't fare too well, but his was one of the most remembered segments of the film along with [[Saif Ali Khan]].

After learning about [[UBS|UBS Switzerland AG]] dealings in the U.S., Birkenfeld resigned on October 5, 2005 and became a partner at Union Charter Ltd., where he specialized in wealth management.&lt;ref name="Birkenfeld Pleads Guilty"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aLI2YNVAxDLM|title=Ex-UBS Banker Birkenfeld Pleads Guilty in Tax Case (Update3)|last=Carlyn|first=Kolker and David Voreacos|date=19 June 2008|accessdate=29 August 2013|publisher=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, he disclosed to the U.S. [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] (DOJ) what he knew about UBS's illegal practices attempting to take advantage the [[Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006]], a law that could pay him up to 30% of any tax revenue recouped by the IRS.&lt;ref name="Roland"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20090303/REG/903039966 |title=Justice Dept. chastises UBS chairman over IRS fraud probe |work=Investment News |first=Neil |last=Roland |date=March 3, 2009 |accessdate=July 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because he did not provide full and complete information to U.S. authorities, Birkenfeld was arrested in Boston on 7 May 2008 when he deplaned from Switzerland arraigned at the U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida on 13 May.&lt;ref name="Ken Stier"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1928897,00.html |title=Why is the UBS Whistle-Blower Headed to Prison? |work=Time Magazine |first=Ken |last=Stier |date=October 6, 2009 |accessdate=July 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birkenfeld resigned his position with Union Charter on 3 June 2008 after agreeing to plead guilty to not disclosing accurate information.

Birkenfeld is viewed as a criminal and a "[[Treason|traitor]]" by some members of the Swiss public and [[Banking in Switzerland|banking community]] as he broke the country's [[Banking in Switzerland#Modern secrecy|banking secrecy]] laws.&lt;ref name="Birkenfeld deserves statue on Wall Street"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gonzalez|first=Juan|title=UBS whistleblower Bradley Birkenfeld deserves statue on Wall Street, not prison sentence|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/ubs-whistleblower-bradley-birkenfeld-deserves-statue-wall-street-prison-sentence-article-1.168809#ixzz2quw6PXA5|publisher=N.Y.

After Birkenfeld's award, the Swiss newspaper ''[[Blick]]'' claimed, “Birkenfeld was a blessing for the Swiss financial industry,” in that his revelations helped accelerate the industry's transition away from its reliance on [[Money laundering|“dirty” money]] by dooming the bank secrecy laws that enabled tax evasion.

Birkenfeld has compared the Swiss banking industry with [[Racket (crime)|gangsters]].  "In essence, bank secrecy is analogous to criminal racketeering — and the Swiss government, along with every Swiss private banker, is a co-conspirator."&lt;!-- Do NOT add any more details to this section, all relevant treatment of the event is at the main article.  --&gt;

== Post-banking life: 2015–present ==
Brad Birkenfeld's three-year period of [[parole]] ran through November 2015; a year previous Birkenfeld's attorney petitioned the U.S. District Court to allow Birkenfeld to travel abroad.&lt;ref name="Whistleblower can't leave US"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/102272941|title=Why this Swiss bank whistleblower can't leave US|last1=Javers|first1=Eamon|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While on parole, Birkenfeld engaged with a variety of charitable efforts: he allowed disadvantaged children to use his luxury suite at [[Boston Bruins]] hockey games and donated six electric bicycles to the [[Boston Police Department]] after the [[Boston Marathon bombing]]s.&lt;ref name="Whistleblower can't leave US" /&gt;

'''Carlos Rafael Rodríguez''' (May 23, 1913 – December 8, 1997) was a [[Cuba]]n [[Communist]] politician, who served in the cabinets of presidents [[Fulgencio Batista]] and [[Fidel Castro]].

Born in [[Cienfuegos]], he became [[mayor]] of the city when he was only 20. Four years later, he joined the [[Popular Socialist Party (Cuba)|Communist Party]] and was appointed editor of the party newspaper, ''Hoy''.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;Dillon.&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from university in 1939. Although he was a participant in the 1935 general strike against provisional President [[Carlos Mendieta]],&lt;ref name=Suchlicki106&gt;Suchlicki 106.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1942, Rodríguez joined the cabinet of President [[Fulgencio Batista]].&lt;ref&gt;When he was Army Chief of Staff, Batista had forced President [[Ramón Grau]] to resign and appointed Mendieta president.&lt;/ref&gt; A "dedicated Marxist", Rodríguez's participation in the Batista cabinet marked the high point of the regime's collaboration with the Communist Party.&lt;ref name=Suchlicki106 /&gt;

Rodríguez first met [[Fidel Castro]] through a mutual friend after Castro visited the Communist Party's bookstore a few days before his disastrous attack on the [[Moncada Barracks]] on July 26, 1953.&lt;ref name=Dominguez30&gt;Domínguez 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Rodríguez denounced the attack after it occurred,&lt;ref name=nytimes /&gt; he would eventually ally himself with Castro in the [[Cuban Revolution]]. In July 1958, he joined the [[26th of July Movement]] in the [[Sierra Maestra]] [[mountain range]] in support of its guerrilla war against Batista; it was the first such gesture of support by the Communist Party for the rebels.&lt;ref name=Dominguez30 /&gt;

Castro befriended him, and after his victory, he rewarded Rodríguez with top posts in the Cuban government. From 1962 to 1965, Rodríguez headed the [[National Institute of Agrarian Reform]], and was referred to by some in the foreign press as Cuba's economic czar.&lt;ref name=nytimes /&gt; In 1969, Castro sent him as an "observer" to the [[1969 International Meeting of Communist and Workers Parties|International Meeting of Communist and Workers Parties]] in [[Moscow]], where he gave an important speech declaring that Cuba would "stand unflinchingly by the [[USSR]]".&lt;ref&gt;Suchlicki 153–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The speech was one of a series of steps taken by the Castro regime to move closer to the Soviet Union after having publicly disagreed with the Soviets in the early- and mid-1960s. Rodríguez would remain a key figure in Soviet-Cuban relations, providing public statements during times of friendship and discord. Before being sidelined in 1997 with deteriorating health, he served on the [[Politburo]] and as Vice President. He suffered from [[Parkinson's disease]] and died in Havana, with Castro presiding over his burial ceremony.&lt;ref name=nytimes /&gt;

The '''early life of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Augustus]]''' began at his birth in [[Rome]] on September 23, 63 BC, and is considered to have ended around the assassination of [[Roman dictator|Dictator]] [[Julius Caesar]], his great-uncle and adoptive father, on March 15, 44 BC.

Augustus was born Gaius Octavius Thurinus in [[Rome]] on September 23, 63 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#5 5–6].&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the respectable, but undistinguished, [[Octavii]] family through his father, also named [[Gaius Octavius (praetor 61 BC)|Gaius Octavius]], and was the great-nephew of [[Julius Caesar]] through his mother [[Atia Balba Caesonia]]. The young Octavius had two older siblings: a half sister, [[Octavia Major]], from his father's first marriage, and a full sister, [[Octavia Minor]]. The Octavii were wealthy through their banking business in [[Velletri]] (in the [[Alban Hills]]), where the family was part of the local aristocracy. However, the family entered into the [[Roman Senate|senatorial]] ranks with the elder Octavius as its [[novus homo]]. The elder Octavius' entrance into the Senate came when he was appointed [[Quaestor]] in 69 BC.

In 61 BC the elder Octavius was elected [[Praetor]]. Following his praetorship, he would serve for two years as [[Roman governor|governor]] of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#1 1–4].&lt;/ref&gt; There, he proved himself a capable administrator. Upon returning to Italy in 59 BC, before he could stand for the [[Roman consul|Consulship]], he suddenly died in [[Nola]]. This left the young Octavius, then four years old, without a father.

Octavius' mother Atia took over his education in the absence of his father. He was taught as the average Roman aristocratic boy was, learning both [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] while being trained as an [[orator]]. When Octavius was six years old Atia remarried to [[Lucius Marcius Philippus (consul 56 BC)|Lucius Marcius Philippus]], a supporter of Julius Caesar and a former governor of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#4 4–8]; [[Nicolaus of Damascus]], ''[http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/nicolaus.html Augustus]'' 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Philippus cherished his new stepchildren as if they were his own. He was consul of 56 BC with [[Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Marcellinus]].

At  this time, the [[First Triumvirate]] between Julius Caesar, [[Pompey the Great]], and [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] was  starting  to collapse. By the time Octavius was ten in 53 BC, the alliance completely broke down with the death of Crassus in [[Parthia]]. Soon thereafter, Octavius made his first public appearance in 52 BC when he delivered the funeral oration for his grandmother [[Julia Minor (sister of Caesar)|Julia Minor]], sister of Caesar.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#8 8.1]; [[Quintilian]], [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/quintilian/quintilian.institutio12.shtml#6 12.6.1].&lt;/ref&gt; It was at this time that the young Octavius captured the attention of his great-uncle.

With Crassus dead, Caesar and Pompey began to fight each other for supremacy and power. In 50 BC, the Senate, led by Pompey, ordered Caesar to return to Rome from [[Gaul]] and to disband his army. The Senate had forbidden Caesar to stand for a second consulship in absentia. Without the consulship, Caesar would be without legal immunity and without the power of his army. Left with no other options, on January 10, 49 BC, Caesar crossed the Rubicon (the frontier boundary of Italy) with only one legion and ignited [[Caesar's civil war|civil war]].

The Senate and Pompey fled to Greece. Despite outnumbering Caesar, who only had his Thirteenth Legion with him, Pompey had no intention of fighting in Italy. Leaving [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Lepidus]] as prefect of Rome, and the rest of Italy under [[Mark Antony]] as tribune, Caesar made an astonishing 27-day route-march to [[Hispania]], rejoining two of his Gallic legions, where he defeated Pompey's lieutenants. He then returned east, to challenge Pompey in Greece where, on July 10, 48 BC at the [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (48 BC)|Battle of Dyrrhachium]], Caesar barely avoided a catastrophic defeat when the line of fortification was broken. He decisively defeated Pompey, despite Pompey's numerical advantage (nearly twice the number of infantry and considerably more cavalry), at the [[Battle of Pharsalus]] in an exceedingly short engagement in 48 BC.

==Early career (48 BC – 44 BC)==
[[File:201209071749b Berlin Pergamonmuseum, Aureus, FO Pergamon, kaiserzeitlich, SIGNIS REGENTIS, Capricornus als persönliches Zeichen Augustus' 19-18 v.u.Z.jpg|left|thumb|Aureus depicting [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]], which Augustus used as a "logo" in token of the illustrious horoscope that Theogenes cast for him in Apollonia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Augustus and Capricorn: Astrological Polyvalency and Imperial Rhetoric |author=Tamsyn Barton |journal=The Journal of Roman Studies |volume=85 |date=1995 |publisher=Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The same year as Caesar’s ultimate victory against Pompey, Octavius turned 15 and donned the [[toga|toga virillis]] on October 18.&lt;ref name=Suet8.1&gt;Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#8 8.1]&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after assuming the toga virillis, Octavius began his first official business upon being elected a [[pontiff]] in the [[College of Pontiffs]].&lt;ref name="Suet8.1"/&gt; It was Caesar who had nominated Octavius for this position, the first of many to come from Caesar. While it is unknown if Caesar took the time to explain the current military or political situation, Caesar did take an interest in Octavius. While celebrating the Festival of the Latins, Caesar appointed Octavius the [[Praefectus urbi]] until his return. While the position was solely honorary and possessed no authority, it allowed Octavius a place in the public eye.

From 46 BC on, Octavius was very close to Caesar and attended theaters, banquets, and other social gatherings with him. In September 46 BC, when Caesar celebrated his multiple triumphs, Octavius took part in the procession and was accorded military honors despite never having served in combat.&lt;ref name=Fagan&gt;[http://www.luc.edu/roman-emperors/auggie.htm Fagan, Garrett G., "Augustus (31 B.C. - 14 A.D.)", 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon, Octavius had built up considerable influence with Caesar to such a point that others would ask him to intercede with him on their behalf.

Following in the normal path of young Romans, Octavius needed experience with military affairs. Caesar proposed that Octavius join him in [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]] even though Octavius had fallen ill. Though he was now legally a man, his mother Atia was still a dominating figure in his life. According to [[Nicolaus of Damascus]], Atia protested Octavius joining Caesar, and the latter recognized the necessity of protecting Octavius’ health.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaus of Damascus, ''[http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/nicolaus.html Augustus]'' 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Though she consented for him to join Caesar in [[Hispania]], where he planned to fight the remaining forces under Pompey’s lieutenants, but Octavius again fell ill and was unable to travel.

As soon as he was well, Octavius, accompanied by a few friends (including [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]]), sailed to Hispania. He became shipwrecked and, after coming ashore with his companions, was forced to make it across hostile territory to reach Caesar's camp. Octavius’ actions greatly impressed his great-uncle, who proceeded to teach Octavius the ways of provincial administration. [[Suetonius]] in Chapter 68 of his ''Life of Augustus''&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#68 68], translated by [[John Carew Rolfe]].&lt;/ref&gt; writes that [[Lucius Antonius (brother of Mark Antony)|Lucius Antonius]], the brother of Mark Antony, accused Augustus for having "given himself to [[Aulus Hirtius]] in Spain for three hundred thousand [[sesterces]]." This alleged homosexual liaison must have taken place in 46 BC during the civil wars when Julius Caesar took Octavian to Spain and Aulus Hirtius was serving there. At the time the future Emperor Augustus was 17 years old.

Caesar and Octavius stayed in Hispania until June 45 BC, after which they returned to Rome. [[Velleius Paterculus]] reports that Caesar and Octavius shared the same carriage.&lt;ref&gt;Velleius Paterculus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2C*.html#59.3 2.59.3].&lt;/ref&gt; When back in Rome, Caesar deposited a new will with the [[Vestal Virgins]] in which he secretly named Octavius as the prime beneficiary.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#83 83].&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning to Rome, Caesar increasingly amassed more authority and control over the [[Roman Republic|Roman state]]. He was made Consul for 10 years and [[Roman Dictator|Dictator]] for the same period. He was allowed to name half of the magistrates each year and even allowed to name new [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]]. Among others, Caesar used this new power to elevate Octavius.

Hoping to continue Octavius’ education, at the end of 45 BC Caesar sent him, along with his friends Agrippa, [[Gaius Maecenas]], and [[Quintus Salvidienus Rufus]], to [[Apollonia, Illyria|Apollonia]] in [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]]. There, Octavius learned not only academics and self-control but military doctrine and tactics as well. Caesar, however, had more than just education in mind for Octavius. Macedonia was home of five [[Roman legion|legions]] and he hoped to use it as a launching ground for an upcoming war with [[Parthia]] in the Middle East.&lt;ref name="eck 9 10"&gt;Eck, 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation, Caesar had nominated Octavius to serve as [[Master of the Horse]] (Caesar’s chief lieutenant) for the year 43 BC, thus making Octavius the number-two man in the state at the age of 19.

However, the war with the Parthians never came nor did Octavius’ promotion. While still in Apollonia, word reached Octavius that Caesar had been assassinated on the [[Ides of March]] in 44 BC. It was then made public that Caesar had adopted Octavius as his son and main heir. In response, Octavius changed his name to Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus. Though modern scholars to avoid confusion commonly refer to him at this point as Octavian, he called himself "Caesar", which is the name his contemporaries also used. Rejecting the advice of some army officers to take refuge with his troops in Macedonia, Octavian sailed to Italy to claim his inheritance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3055">'''Elymas''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|l|ᵻ|m|ə|s}}, also known as '''Bar-Jesus''' ({{lang-grc|Βαριεσοῦ}}, {{lang-arc|Bar-Shuma}}, {{lang-la|Bariesu}}), is a [[Jews|Jew]] in the [[Acts of the Apostles]], chapter 13,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|13}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[New Testament]]. Acts of the Apostles calls him a [[Magi|magus]], which the [[King James Version of the Bible|King James Bible]] here translates as "[[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]]". He is represented as opposing the disciple [[Paul the Apostle]], who is called at this point for the first time with his [[Roman name]], and [[Barnabas]] in the city of [[Paphos]] on [[Cyprus]], when [[Sergius Paulus]], the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Proconsul]], wishes to hear [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] and [[Barnabas]] speak about [[Jesus]]. Because of this opposition, [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] claims that [[God]] had decided to make him temporarily [[Blindness|blind]]. A cloud of darkness immediately begins blocking his sight;&lt;ref&gt;"Immediately mist and darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking people to lead him by the hand;" {{bibleverse||Acts|13:11}}&lt;/ref&gt; after this [[Sergius Paulus]] is converted to [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;"When the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, for he was amazed at the teaching about the Lord."{{bibleverse||Acts|13:12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elymas’s intentions for [[Sergius Paulus|Sergius]] are unclear, only that he was desperate to keep him from receiving the word about Jesus. Perhaps he had the proconsul’s ear and was his advisor on matters of faith. This would make sense as [[Sergius Paulus|Sergius]] is obviously learned about Jewish teachings and Elymas is Jewish. The message [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] and [[Barnabas]] bring threatens the false-prophet’s usefulness to the island's most powerful administrator.

Bar-Jesus received the same curse that [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] himself did: temporary blindness.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|9:8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear from the passage that Bar-Jesus had the ear of the proconsul and was well known throughout the region. He was a self-proclaimed prophet of God&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|13:6}}&lt;/ref&gt; who may have had his own religious agenda.

== Name ==
Acts 13:8 says "Elymas the Magus (for so his name is translated) opposed them". "Elymas" is possibly derived from the Arabic ''‘alīm'' "learned" or "wise", and may be used to translate ''magos''.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Haenchen, ''The Acts of the Apostles: A Commentary'', Philadelphia: The Westminister Press,  1971, pg. 398; {{ISBN|0-664-20919-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bar-Jesus'' means "Son of [[Joshua]]" or "Son of [[Jesus]]" in Aramaic.

'''Louis Giovanni''' "'''Gianni'''" '''Russo''' (born December 12, 1943) is an American actor and singer. He is best known for his role as [[Carlo Rizzi (The Godfather)|Carlo Rizzi]] in ''[[The Godfather]]''.&lt;ref name="Jacobs"/&gt;

==Life and career==
Russo was born in Manhattan, raised in [[Little Italy, Manhattan|Little Italy]]&lt;ref name="Bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.giannirusso.com/bio/ |title=About Gianni Russo |website=Gianni Russo |access-date=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rosebank, Staten Island]].  After reprising the Rizzi character in a brief flashback scene at the end of ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', Russo went on to act in more than 35 movies, including ''[[Goodnight, My Love]]'' (1972), ''[[Lepke (film)|Lepke]]'' (1975, as [[Albert Anastasia]]), ''[[Laserblast]]'' (1978), ''[[Chances Are (film)|Chances Are]]'' (1989), ''[[The Freshman (1990 film)|The Freshman]]'' (1990), ''[[Side Out]]'' (1990), ''[[Another You]]'' (1991), ''[[Super Mario Bros. (film)|Super Mario Bros.]]'' (1993), ''[[Any Given Sunday]]'' (1999) and ''[[Seabiscuit (film)|Seabiscuit]]'' (2003).

Russo claims that he started a fledgling career in [[organized crime]] working as an errand boy and mob associate for [[Frank Costello]]&lt;ref name="Jacobs"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/09/nyregion/his-big-break-the-corleones-killed-him.html | title=His Big Break? The Corleones Killed Him; Godfather's Son-in-Law Is Singing, Selling and Enjoying Life | work=[[The New York Times]] | author-link=Andrew Jacobs (journalist) | first=Andrew | last=Jacobs | date=April 9, 2005 | accessdate=March 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an adolescent but later abandoned the dangerous and volatile lifestyle of organized crime.

Over the years since the beginning of his career, he has owned a [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] restaurant called Gianni Russo's State Street (closed in 1988), dated [[Dionne Warwick]] for more than a decade, and successfully defeated 23 federal criminal indictments on a variety of charges stemming from alleged organized crime associations.&lt;ref name="Jacobs"/&gt;

In 1988, he killed a man outside of his Las Vegas club and casino. A member of the Medellín drug cartel was harassing a female patron when he tried to intervene, the man stabbed him with a broken wine bottle. In return, Russo pulled out a gun and killed him.&lt;ref name="Jacobs"/&gt; The case was ruled a [[justifiable homicide]] and Russo was not charged.

Russo is also a singer. In 2004, he released a CD called ''Reflections'' that pays homage to [[Dean Martin]] and [[Frank Sinatra]].&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt;

Russo owns a wine brand, [[Gianni Russo Wines]] which debuted in 2009. &lt;ref&gt;https://italialiving.com/articles/food-wine/the-intriguing-life-of-gianni-russo-beyond-the-godfather/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gordon Thallon Stewart''' (9 February 1919 – 10 October 2016) was a Scottish epidemiologist and public health physician who served as the Henry Mechan Professor of Public Health at the [[University of Glasgow]] from 1972 to 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/announcements/deaths/deaths/14807410.Gordon_Thallon_Stewart/ |title=Gordon Thallon Stewart |date=2016-10-17 |work=[[Herald Scotland]]|access-date=2018-04-28 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH2549&amp;type=P |title=Biography of Gordon Stewart |website=[[University of Glasgow]] |access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Early life and education==
Stewart was born on 9 February 1919 in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire]], [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/obituaries/14904952.Obituary___Gordon_Stewart__expert_in_public_health_and_colleague_of_Fleming_who_helped_pioneer_the_use_of_penicillin/ |title=Obituary - Gordon Stewart, expert in public health and colleague of Fleming who helped pioneer the use of penicillin |date=2016-11-14 |work=Herald Scotland |access-date=2018-04-28 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the University of Glasgow in 1939 with a BSc degree.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; He later received an MB, ChB, and MD from the University of Glasgow in 1942, 1942, and 1949, respectively; he also received a diploma in tropical medicine and hygiene from the [[University of Liverpool]] in 1948.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;
==Career==
Stewart served as a surgeon-lieutenant in the [[Royal Navy]] from 1943 to 1946.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; He then held several hospital appointments, including senior registrar and tutor at the Wright-Fleming Institute at [[St Mary's Hospital, London]] from 1948 to 1952, where he worked alongside [[Alexander Fleming]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He became professor of pathology and bacteriology at the [[University of Karachi]] in 1952.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; He served as a consultant pathologist to the South West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board of the [[National Health Service]], as well as head of laboratories at the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]] Laboratories at [[Carshalton]], from 1954 to 1963.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; He then traveled to [[the United States]], where he served as Professor of Epidemiology and Pathology at the [[University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill]] until 1968, and as Watkins Professor of Epidemiology at [[Tulane University Medical Center]] until 1972.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; From 1972 to 1984, he was the Henry Mechan Professor of Public Health at the University of Glasgow.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;
==Roles in government investigations==
In 1974, Stewart was part of a government-appointed team tasked with investigating experimental, now-banned whooping cough vaccines given by the British government to orphans and mentally handicapped children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/BBC-UK-did-secret-experiments-on-kids/27321093879753/ |title=BBC: U.K. did secret experiments on kids |date=2004-08-30 |work=[[UPI]] |access-date=2018-04-28 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, he was commissioned to write a report on the whooping cough vaccine by Britain's chief scientific officer, but the report was never made public by the then-British Health Secretary [[Kenneth Clarke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jul/08/medicalscience.highereducation |title=Did toxic vaccines ruin lives? |last=McVeigh |first=Tracy |date=2001-07-08 |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=2018-04-28 |last2=Barnett |first2=Antony |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Views on vaccines==
In the 1970s, Stewart became well-known for his opposition to the [[pertussis vaccine]],&lt;ref name=nature&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cherry |first=Michael |date=April 2000 |title=Letter fuels South Africa's AIDS furore |url=http://www.nature.com/articles/35010218 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |language=En |volume=404 |issue=6781 |pages=911–911 |doi=10.1038/35010218 |issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he claimed to have supported until 1974, when he saw many vaccinated children who had still developed pertussis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yWATg4JNQKEC |title=How to Raise a Healthy Child: In Spite of Your Doctor |last=Mendelsohn |first=Robert S.|authorlink=Robert S.

He argued that "There are no grounds for saying a major epidemic is on the way and I don't agree with the way their figures have been collected." In the next two years, however, over 100,000 children were hospitalized with pertussis, and 600 of them died.&lt;ref name=deadly/&gt; In the mid-1980s, Stewart served as the lead witness for the prosecution in the case of Johnnie Kinnear, whose mental development was allegedly stunted due to his receipt of the pertussis vaccine. The case unraveled after contradictions were revealed between Kinnear's parents' testimony and hospital records, and Stewart's role in the pertussis vaccine controversy came to an end as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Baker |first=Jeffrey P. |date=2003-09-08 |title=The pertussis vaccine controversy in Great Britain, 1974-1986 |url=https://online.manchester.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/orgs/I3075-COMMUNITY-MEDN-1/DO%20NOT%20DELETE%20-%20PEP%20Quality%20and%20Evidence/QE-PEP-HTML5/media/F8430185-03E3-C538-8362-DE46812E97BE.pdf |journal=[[Vaccine (journal)|Vaccine]] |volume=21 |issue=25-26 |pages=4003–4010 |issn=0264-410X |pmid=12922137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart's public criticisms of vaccines contributed to a dramatic decrease in vaccination rates in the United Kingdom, and a resulting increase in cases of pertussis there.&lt;ref name=mnookin/&gt;&lt;ref name=embo/&gt; He later made an appearance in the 1982 [[WRC-TV]] news report "Vaccine Roulette", where his work was portrayed favorably.&lt;ref name=mnookin&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l_KwCOs3QhsC |title=The Panic Virus: The True Story Behind the Vaccine-Autism Controversy |last=Mnookin |first=Seth|authorlink=Seth Mnookin |date=2012-01-03 |publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]] |isbn=9781439158654 |pages=71–2 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The host of the report, Lea Thompson, introduced Stewart as a member of the Committee on Safety of Medicines, despite the fact that he had never been a member of this group.&lt;ref name=deadly&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=we7QDQAAQBAJ |title=Deadly Choices: How the Anti-Vaccine Movement Threatens Us All |last=Offit |first=Paul A. |authorlink=Paul Offit|date=2015-03-10 |publisher=[[Basic Books]] |isbn=9780465057962 |pages=50–1 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson also did not mention any of Stewart's previous associations with parents who believed their children had been injured by vaccines, nor did she note that his research had been used by some such parents as evidence in lawsuits.&lt;ref name=mnookin/&gt;

==Views on HIV/AIDS==
A former [[World Health Organization]] advisor on [[AIDS]], Stewart was described as one of two [[HIV/AIDS]] "dissidents to a degree" by ''[[the Guardian]]'' in 2000 (the other being [[Andrew Herxheimer]]).&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,338073,00.html |title=A fight for life  |date=2000-06-30 |work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-04-28 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart and Herxheimer both served on [[Thabo Mbeki]]'s presidential advisory panel on AIDS.&lt;ref name=beresford&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/may/07/davidberesford.robinmckie |title=Africa's Aids fate hangs in balance |last=Beresford |first=David |date=2000-05-06 |work=The Guardian |access-date=2018-04-28 |last2=McKie |first2=Robin |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1990 ''[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]]'' episode about HIV/AIDS, Stewart claimed that HIV had not spread significantly among heterosexuals in either the United States or Great Britain, dismissing the disease's spread in [[Africa]] as "something else". Epidemiologist [[Roy M. Anderson]] dismissed this claim, arguing that Stewart "would benefit from becoming aware of the scientific literature".&lt;ref name=nature/&gt; In 1995, he argued against giving [[azidothymidine]] to pregnant women who had AIDS, even though it had already been shown to be effective at preventing [[mother-to-child transmission]] of HIV.&lt;ref name=deadly/&gt; In 1997, he co-authored an article in ''[[Current Medical Research and Opinion]]'' along with several [[HIV/AIDS denialists]], including Eleni Papadopulos-Eleopulos of [[the Perth Group]].&lt;ref name=nature/&gt; In 2000, he told ''the Guardian'': "We have been criminally irresponsible - we have told people they have Aids when they are HIV positive and that's not true. We have told them there is no cure and no vaccine and they are going to die. We have caused endless stress and even suicide. Families have worried about whether their children are going to be infected. That's why it is such a panic disease. The medical establishment has made the panic."&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; With respect to his views on the cause of AIDS, he was an outspoken supporter of [[Peter Duesberg]]'s belief that it was not HIV, and argued that there was a conspiracy aimed at preventing such views from attracting public attention.&lt;ref name=beresford/&gt;

[[File:SOAOTO - Folio 044V.jpg|thumb|200px|Gilbert de Lannoy]]
[[File:Arsen 5104 f14 det.jpg|thumb|"Foliant de Ionnal" presents his text of ''L'Instruction de josne prince'' to "King Rudolph of Norway", c. 1468-70.]]
'''Guillebert de Lannoy''' (also Gilbert, Guilbert or Ghillebert; 1386–1462), was a [[Flemings|Flemish]] traveler and diplomat, chamberlain to the [[duke of Burgundy]], governor of the fort of [[Sluys]], and a [[knight of the Golden Fleece]].

He was the son of Guillebert I de Lannoy and Catherine of Molembais. He was a member of the noble [[Lannoy (noble family)|de Lannoy]] family.
His brothers were [[Hugo of Lannoy]] and [[Baldwin of Lannoy]], also founding Knights of the Golden Fleece.

Guillebert first served [[Jean de Werchin]], seneschal of Hainaut, and accompanied him to the East and to Spain. He then served [[John the Fearless]] in his war against the [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège]] and the [[Armagnac–Burgundian Civil War]]. He then joined the [[Teutonic Knights]] in the [[Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War]].
Ghillebert also fought in 1415 against the English in the [[Battle of Azincourt|Battle of Azincourt or Agincourt]], where he was wounded and captured. 
 
In the service of [[Philip the Good]], he discharged several diplomatic missions in [[France]], [[England]] (as Ambassador to [[Henry V of England]]), [[Teutonic Knights]], [[Poland]], [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], and [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and was one of the negotiators of the [[Treaty of Troyes]] (1420). In 1421 he was sent by [[Henry V of England]] to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] to inquire into the possibility of reviving the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], and wrote an account of his travels, ''Les Pelerinages de Surye et de Egipte'', which was published in 1826 and again in 1842.

His travels in the Baltic region and Russia are recounted in his book ''Voyages et Ambassades'', published in Mons in 1840 with subsequent editions. Around 1440 Lannoy wrote ''L'Instruction de josne prince'' ("Advice for a Young Prince"), which he dressed up with a fictional origin in the court of [[Norway]] "long, long ago", followed by a rediscovery of the manuscript text.  The [[dedication miniature]] in [[Charles the Bold]]'s copy of 1468-70 illustrates the Norwegian story, but using up-to-date Burgundian costume and, it seems, the faces of the ducal family.  Charles, around seven when the work was written, had no doubt always been the young prince Lannoy had in mind.&lt;ref&gt;Kren &amp; McKendrick, 235-237&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25216">The '''hijackers in the [[September 11 attacks]]''' were 19 men affiliated with [[al-Qaeda]]. 15 of the 19 were citizens of [[Saudi Arabia]], and the others were from the [[United Arab Emirates]] (2), [[Egypt]], and [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt; The hijackers were organized into four teams, each led by a pilot-trained hijacker with three or four "muscle hijackers," who were trained to help subdue the pilots, passengers, and crew.

The first hijackers to arrive in the United States were [[Khalid al-Mihdhar]] and [[Nawaf al-Hazmi]], who settled in [[San Diego County, California]], in January 2000. They were followed by three hijacker-pilots, [[Mohamed Atta]], [[Marwan al-Shehhi]], and [[Ziad Jarrah]] in mid-2000 to undertake flight training in [[South Florida]]. The fourth hijacker-pilot, [[Hani Hanjour]], arrived in San Diego in December 2000. The rest of the "muscle hijackers" arrived in early- and mid-2001.

==Selection==
[[Khalid al-Mihdhar]] and [[Nawaf al-Hazmi]] were both experienced and respected [[jihad]]ists in the eyes of al-Qaeda leader, [[Osama bin Laden]].

As for the pilots who would go on to participate in the attacks, three of them were original members of the [[Hamburg cell]] ([[Mohamed Atta]], [[Marwan al-Shehhi]] and [[Ziad Jarrah]]). Following their training at Al-Qaeda training camps in [[Afghanistan]], they were chosen by Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda's military wing due to their extensive knowledge of western culture and language skills, increasing the mission's operational security and its chances for success. The fourth intended pilot, [[Ramzi bin al-Shibh]], a member of the Hamburg cell, was also chosen to participate in the attacks yet was unable to obtain a visa for entry into the [[United States]]. He was later replaced by [[Hani Hanjour]], a Saudi national.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2349195.stm | work=BBC News | title=The Hamburg connection | date=August 19, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|xgLwu2FhfDM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mihdhar and Hazmi were also potential pilot hijackers, but did not do well in their initial pilot lessons in San Diego. Both were kept on as "muscle" hijackers, who would help overpower the passengers and crew and allow the pilot hijackers to take control of the flights. In addition to Mihdhar and Hazmi, thirteen other muscle hijackers were selected in late 2000 or early 2001. All were from Saudi Arabia, with the exception of [[Fayez Banihammad]], who was from the [[United Arab Emirates]].

Two hijackers, Hani Hanjour and Majed Moqed were identified by clerks as having bought single, first-class tickets for Flight 77 from Advance Travel Service in [[Totowa, New Jersey]] with $1,842.25 in cash.&lt;ref name="probe"/&gt; Renee May, a flight attendant on Flight 77, used a cell phone to call her mother in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. She said her flight was being hijacked by six individuals who had moved them to the rear of the plane. Unlike the other flights, there was no report of stabbings or bomb threats. According to the [[9/11 Commission Report]], it is possible that pilots were not stabbed to death and were sent to the rear of the plane.

Spoken messages (from Ziad Jarrah) intended for passengers were broadcast over the air traffic control system, presumably by mistake:

{{quote|Ladies and gentlemen, this is the captain. Please sit down. Keep remaining sitting(sic). We have a bomb on board. So sit.

==Investigation==

===Before the attacks===
{{side_box|right|text="[W]e've got to tell the Bureau about this. These guys clearly are bad. One of them, at least, has a multiple-entry visa to the U.S. We've got to tell the FBI." And then [the CIA officer] said to me, 'No, it's not the FBI's case, not the FBI's jurisdiction.'"&lt;br /&gt;[[Mark Rossini]], "The Spy Factory"&lt;ref name=rossini1&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/military/spy-factory.html | title=The Spy Factory | publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] | author=Bamford, James | authorlink=James Bamford | author2=Willis, Scott | date=February 3, 2009 | accessdate=July 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Before the attacks, FBI agent [[Robert Wright, Jr.]] had written vigorous criticisms of FBI's alleged incompetence in investigating terrorists residing within the United States. Wright was part of the Bureau's Chicago counter-terrorism task force and involved in project Vulgar Betrayal, which was linked to [[Yasin al-Qadi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://vids.rationalveracity.com/v/960/robert_wright_judicial_watch_briefing.html C-SPAN video], address to the National Press Club on May 30, 2002, with [[Judicial Watch]], via rationalveracity.com&lt;/ref&gt;

According to James Bamford, the [[NSA]] had picked up communications of al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi back in 1999, but had been hampered by internal bureaucratic conflicts between itself and the CIA and did not do a full analysis of the information it passed on to the agency. For example, it only passed on the first names, Nawaf and Khalid.&lt;ref&gt;Shadow Factory, James Bamford, Doubleday, 2008, Chapter 1: Intercept&lt;/ref&gt;

Bamford also claims that the CIA's [[Alec Station]] (a unit assigned to bin Laden) knew that al-Mihdhar was planning to come to New York as far back as January 2000. Doug Miller, one of three FBI agents working inside the CIA station, tried to send a message (a CIR) to the FBI to alert them about this, so they could put al-Mihdhar on a [[wikt:watchlist|watch list]]. His CIA boss, Tom Wilshire, deputy station chief, allegedly denied permission to Miller. Miller asked his associate [[Mark Rossini]] for advice; Rossini pressed Wilshire's deputy but was rebuffed also.&lt;ref&gt;Bamford, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/military/spy-factory.html Spy Factory], Nova, interview with Mark Rossini 2.3.2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Bamford also claims that al-Mihdhar and Hazmi wound up living with Abdussattar Shaikh for a time to save money. Shaikh was, coincidentally, an FBI informant, but since they never acted suspiciously around him, he never reported them. The CIA Bangkok station told Alec Station that Hazmi had gone to Los Angeles. None of this information made it back to the FBI headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;Bamford, Chapter 2: San Diego&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks===
Within minutes of the attacks, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] opened the largest FBI investigation in United States history, operation [[PENTTBOM]]. The suspects were identified within 72 hours because few made any attempt to disguise their names on flight and credit card records.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} They were also among the few non-U.S. citizens and nearly the only passengers with Arabic names on their flights, enabling the FBI to identify them using such details as dates of birth, known or possible residences, visa status, and specific identification of the suspected pilots.&lt;ref name=fbilist&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel01/091401hj.htm FBI Announces List of 19 Hijackers], ''FBI, national Press Release'' September 14, 2001  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221101634/https://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel01/091401hj.htm |date=February 21, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 27, 2001, the FBI released photos of the 19 hijackers, along with information about many of their possible nationalities and aliases.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel01/092701hjpic.htm The FBI releases 19 photographs of individuals believed to be the hijackers of the four airliners that crashed on 11 September 2001] ''FBI, national Press Release'' 27 September 2001  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523084715/https://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel01/092701hjpic.htm |date=May 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The suspected hijackers were from [[Saudi Arabia]] (fifteen hijackers), United Arab Emirates (two hijackers), [[Lebanon]] (one hijacker) and [[Egypt]] (one hijacker).

The passport of Satam al-Suqami was reportedly recovered "a few blocks from where the World Trade Center's twin towers once stood";&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2001/Sep-16-Sun-2001/news/17011253.html Las Vegas Review Journal], September 16, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1546927.stm Giuliani holds on to hope], BBC News, 16 September 2001&lt;/ref&gt; a passerby picked it up and gave it to a NYPD detective shortly before the towers collapsed. The passports of two other hijackers, Ziad Jarrah and Saeed al-Ghamdi, were recovered from the crash site of United Airlines Flight 93 in Pennsylvania, and a fourth passport, that of Abdulaziz al-Omari was recovered from luggage that did not make it onto [[American Airlines Flight 11]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/archive/hearing7/9-11Commission_Hearing_2004-01-26.htm |title=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States |publisher=9-11commission.gov |accessdate=2011-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[9/11 Commission Report]], 26 al-Qaeda terrorist conspirators sought to enter the United States to carry out a suicide mission. In the end, the FBI reported that there were 19 hijackers in all: five on three of the flights, and four on the fourth. On September 14, three days after the attacks, the [[FBI]] announced the names of 19 persons.&lt;ref name=fbilist/&gt; After a controversy about an earlier remark, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary [[Janet Napolitano]] stated in May 2009 that the [[9/11 Commission]] found that none of the hijackers entered the United States through Canada.

Nawaf al-Hazmi and Hani Hanjour, attended the [[Dar al-Hijrah]] Falls Church, Virginia, Islamic Center where the Imam [[Anwar al-Awlaki]] preached, in early April 2001. Through interviews with the FBI, it was discovered that Awlaki had previously met Nawaf al-Hazmi several times while the two lived in San Diego. At the time, Hazmi was living with Khalid al-Mihdhar, another 9/11 hijacker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Associated Press|title=Alleged shooter tied to mosque of 9/11 hijackers|date=November 8, 2009|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33777070/ns/us_news-tragedy_at_fort_hood/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hijackers of the same plane often had very strong ties as many of them attended school together or lived together prior to the attacks&lt;ref&gt;http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/941/863&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jane Lane''' (c. 1626 – 9 September 1689) played a heroic role in the [[escape of Charles II]] in 1651. The main significance of the story is the key part that the escape played in forming the character and the opinions of Charles.

==Origins==
Jane was the daughter of Thomas Lane and Anne Bagot of the parish of [[Bentley, West Midlands|Bentley and Hyde]] (near [[Walsall]]).  Her parents had married at [[Blithfield]], Staffordshire, in 1608. Their son, John, was born on April 8, 1609, the first child of what was to be four sons and five daughters. There are several early christening dates for a Jane Lane in the [[International Genealogical Index]] which have been estimated by contributors, most probably based on a spurious date for her marriage. However she was known as Jane '''Lane''' in 1651 and so was unmarried at that date.  Her eventual marriage to Sir Clement Fisher (of Packington Hall, Warwickshire) is known to have occurred on December 8, 1663, being performed by the Most Rev. [[Gilbert Sheldon]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].

Known birth (and other) dates for Jane Lane's siblings are:

* Colonel John Lane—born April 8, 1609
* Walter Lane—born May 1611
* William Lane—baptised August 7, 1625
* Richard Lane—youngest son (became a [[Groom of the Bedchamber]])
* Withy Lane (married John Petre). Withy is stated in the book Flight of the King (Alan Fea, 1908, Methuen) as being the eldest daughter of the family.
* Jane Lane
* Anne Lane (married Edward Birch)
* Mary Lane—born 1619 (married Edward Nicholas, Esq.)
* Elizabeth Lane

==The ride to Bristol with Charles II==
Following defeat at the [[Battle of Worcester]] on 3 September 1651, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] escaped and headed north into [[Shropshire]] and [[Staffordshire]] with several companions including [[James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]] and [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Henry, Lord Wilmot]]. A reward of £1000 was offered for the capture of the King. It is likely that the King and anyone helping him would have been executed for treason, if caught. The King had a distinctive appearance: very dark and six feet two inches tall (1.88 m). Furthermore, there were cavalry patrols specifically tasked with finding the King. At this time it was illegal for Catholics to travel more than five miles away from their homes without a pass from the Sheriff of the County. Helping the King would therefore be hazardous.

Wilmot had gone to Bentley Hall, the home of Colonel John Lane, who had been an officer in the Royalist Army since 1642. His sister was Jane Lane. She was described by [[John Evelyn]] as "an acute wit", "an excellent disputant" though "no beauty". Wilmot learned that Jane had obtained a permit from the military for herself and a servant to travel to the seaport of [[Bristol]], to visit a relation, Ellen Norton, who was having a baby. Lord Wilmot saw the opportunity of escaping through Bristol in the guise of the servant, since no lady would travel alone. On learning of the King's failure to reach Wales, Wilmot decided that the King should take advantage of the military pass and travel to Bristol as Jane Lane's servant, and then find a ship to take him to [[France]].&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;{{cite DNB |wstitle= Lane, Jane |first=James McMullen |last= Rigg |volume=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the King reached Bentley Hall early on 10 September 1651, he was quickly dressed as a tenant farmer’s son and adopted the alias ‘William Jackson’ for the next part of his journey. The party then set out, Charles riding the same horse as Jane Lane. They were accompanied by Withy Petre (Jane Lane’s sister), her husband John Petre, and Henry Lascelles, another related Royalist officer.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

Lord Wilmot refused to travel in disguise; he rode openly half a mile ahead of the party and if challenged he said he would claim to be out hunting. This was a risky yet useful decoy. The party rode through [[Rowley Regis]] then [[Quinton, Birmingham|Quinton]] to [[Bromsgrove]]. When they arrived at Bromsgrove they found that the horse ridden by Charles and Jane had lost a shoe. The King, playing the role of servant, took the horse to a blacksmith. 
[[Image:Charles II and Lady Jane.jpg|thumb|200px|Charles II and Lady Jane on the ride to [[Bristol]]]]
The King when he later told his story to [[Samuel Pepys]] and others said, 
{{quote|As I was holding my horse's foot, I asked the smith what news. He told me that there was no news that he knew of, since the good news of the beating the rogues of the Scots. I asked him whether there was none of the English taken that joined with the Scots, He answered he did not hear if that rogue, Charles Stuart, were taken; but some of the others, he said, were taken. I told him that if that rogue were taken, he deserved to be hanged more than all the rest, for bringing in the Scots. Upon which he said I spoke like an honest man; and so we parted.&lt;ref&gt;Count Grammont.

Fitzgerald Molloy. ''[http://www.fullbooks.com/Royalty-Restored-or-London-under-Charles-II1.html Royalty Restored or London under Charles II]'' Chapter II.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The party reached [[Wootton Wawen]] where cavalry had gathered outside the inn. Here John and Withy Petre went ahead of the party. The King, Jane and Henry Lascelles with great coolness rode through the troops. The party then continued through [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], and on to [[Long Marston, Warwickshire|Long Marston]] where they spent the night of 10 September at the house of John Tomes, another relation of Jane's.&lt;ref&gt;Pepys Transcription of the Kings Account of his Escape, Charles II's Escape from Worcester, edited by William Matthews, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; 

On Thursday 11 September, they continued through [[Chipping Campden]] and then to [[Cirencester]], where it is said they spent the night of 11 September at the Crown Inn. The next morning they travelled on to [[Chipping Sodbury]] and then to [[Bristol]], arriving at [[Abbots Leigh]] on the evening of 12 September. They stayed at the home of Mr and Mrs George Norton, who were also Jane’s friends. The Nortons were unaware of the King's identity during his three-day stay at Abbotsleigh. While staying there Charles deflected suspicion by asking a servant, who had been in the King's personal guard at the Battle of Worcester, to describe the King's appearance and clothing at the battle. The man looked at Charles and said, "The King was at least three fingers taller than [you]."

==Bristol to Trent==
Attempts were made to find a ship from Bristol to France but without success.  
Charles and Wilmot therefore decided to try the south coast.  
Ellen Norton had a miscarriage and felt that Jane should stay. Consequently, Jane had to counterfeit a letter apparently calling her back to Bentley so that she could leave with the King. 
On the morning of 16 September Charles and Jane set out and reached the Manor House, [[Castle Cary]]. 
The next day they reached [[Trent, Dorset|Trent]] in [[Dorset]].  They stayed at Trent House, the home of Colonel Francis Wyndham, another Royalist officer.  The King spent the next few days hiding at Trent whilst Wyndham and Wilmot attempted to find a ship from [[Lyme Regis]] or [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]]. It was whilst he was at Trent that the King witnessed a bizarre event where the local villagers were celebrating, believing that he had been killed at Worcester. It was also this point that Jane Lane and Lascelles returned home.

==Jane's exile==
However Jane heard on 14 October that the Council of State had been told she had helped with the escape.  Before Bentley Hall was searched, she left, walking to [[Great Yarmouth|Yarmouth]] posing as a "country wench" and travelled to France.  She arrived in Paris in December 1651 and was welcomed by the Court in exile.  She developed a strong friendship with the King and with [[Queen Henrietta Maria]].  The King held her in great esteem.  So much so that John Fisher reported a scurrillous rumour had circulated that she was the King's mistress.  Even the King's sister, [[Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Mary]], in a letter from Holland jokingly referred to Jane as the King's 'wife'.

In 1652, Charles arranged for Jane to become a lady-in-waiting for his sister Princess Mary in Holland. Throughout his exile Charles carried on affectionate correspondence with Jane Lane and often said that he wished he could help her more.  Jane received the following letter from Charles in reply to a letter in which Jane had said he had probably forgotten her by now: 

{{quote|1652 the last of June

Mrs. Lane, I did not thinke I should ever have begun a letter to you in [chiding?] but you give me so just cause by telling me you feare you are wearing out of [my?] memory that I cannot chuse but tell you I take it very unkindly that after [all?] the obligations I have to you 'tis possible for you to suspect I can ever [be so?] wanting to myselfe as not to remember them on all occasions to your advan[tage?], which I assure you, I shall and hope before long I shall have it in my power to give you testimonyes of my kindnesse to you which I desire. I am very [sorry?] to hear that your father and brother are in prison, but I hope it is of no [other?] score than the general claping of all persons who wish me well and I am the more sorry for it. Now it hath hindered you from coming along with my [sister?] that I might have assured you myself how truly I am

Your Most affectionate friend, For Mrs. Lane

Charles R.}}

==Restoration==
Only when the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] finally came did Jane return to England.  Charles was then able to give her a pension of £1000 per year and many gifts, including portraits of the King and a lock of his hair. Parliament also voted her £1000 to buy a jewel to commemorate her service.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; Her courageous loyalty earned for her family the right to add the three Lions of England to their [[coat of arms]]. (In later years the lions exempted the Lane family from a tax on coats of arms, as the royal arms were exempt.) 

She was married to [[Sir Clement Fisher, 2nd Baronet]] of [[Great Packington]] (1613–1683), on 8 December 1663 by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Fisher had served under Jane's brother, John Lane, as a captain in the [[English Civil War|First Civil War]].  There were no children from the marriage.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

In later life she lived extravagantly and there were arrears of £6500 in the payment of her pension.  Consequently, she was deeply in debt. Lady Fisher died at [[Packington Old Hall]], between [[Birmingham]] and [[Coventry]], on 9 September 1689 and was buried at Packington. Because of her debts, her estate was only £10.

Several paintings of Jane exist including one in the collection of the [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]] of the King and Jane Lane on a horse ([http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?search=ss&amp;sText=jane+lane&amp;LinkID=mp01588&amp;rNo=0&amp;role=sit NPG 5251]). It was part of a romanticised series about the escape painted by [[Isaac Fuller]] shortly after the Restoration.

'''John Middleton''' (1578–1623) was an [[England|English]] [[gigantism|giant]] commonly known as the ''Childe of Hale''. Most of what is known about him is based on [[oral tradition]] and [[legend]]s. Legend tells that he slept with his feet out of the window of his small house. Tales also credit him with great strength.

==Biography==
John Middleton was born in the village of [[Hale, Halton|Hale]], near [[Liverpool]]. According to contemporary accounts and his epitaph, Middleton grew to the height of {{convert|9|ft|3|in|m}}.
Also he slept with his feet hanging out the window of his house.
Because of his size, landlord and sheriff of [[Lancashire]] Gilbert Ireland hired him as a bodyguard. When King [[James I of England|James I]] stopped by in 1617 to knight Ireland, he also heard about Middleton and invited both of them to the court, which they accepted in 1620.

[[File:Childe of Hale - geograph.org.uk - 40602.jpg|thumb|Childe of Hale - geograph.org.uk - 40602]]

In London, John Middleton was presented to the King in a costume of large lace ruffs about his face and hands; a striped doublet of crimson and white; a blue girdle embroidered with gold; large plush white breeches with powdered blue flowers; green stockings; broad shoes in a light colour, having high red heels and tied with large bows of red ribbon and just below his knees were bandages of the same colour with large bows and by his side a sword was suspended by a broad belt over his shoulder. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Brasenose College has a portrait of Middleton in this dress and the painted outline of his hand. Middleton beat the King's champion in wrestling and in doing so broke the man's thumb. He received £20, a large amount of money in those times. Unfortunately, jealous of his wealth, Middleton's companions mugged him when he was returning to Hale. His money was stolen.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

John Middleton died impoverished in 1623. He was buried in the Hale churchyard with an epitaph, "Here lyeth the bodie of John Middleton the Childe of Hale. Nine feet three. Borne 1578 Dyed 1623."

There have been numerous local uses and commemorations of Middleton; a pub in Hale, named "The Childe of Hale", bears a copy of the [[Brasenose College]] portrait as its sign. Previously situated across the road from the church was a large tree trunk. In 1996 it was carved with representations of John Middleton, Hale Lighthouse and other local symbols. In 2011, due to disease and in the interests of public safety the tree trunk was removed by [[Halton Borough Council]]. In April 2013, the wooden sculpture was replaced by a bronze statue 3&amp;nbsp;m tall by local sculptor, Diane Gorvin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-22065684 BBC News: A tall tale: The Childe of Hale remembered] (accessed 12 April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4290">'''Karl Toman''' (2 January 1884 – 5 February 1950) was an [[Austria]]n politician and [[trade union]]ist. Toman hailed from a [[working class|working-class]] family. He went on to become a metal industry worker.&lt;ref name="de"&gt;Starch, Roland. ''[http://othes.univie.ac.at/4385/1/2009-04-06_0008790.pdf „Die KPÖ und die Komintern“]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Toman joined the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic Labour Party of Austria]] in 1898. In the run-up to the [[World War I|First World War]], Toman served as secretary of the Goldsmiths' Trade Union. He was taken as a [[prisoner of war]] in [[Russia]], and went on to fight on the Soviet side in the [[Russian Civil War]].&lt;ref name="de"/&gt; Toman becoming a leading figure in the [[Communist Party of Austria]]. He served as general secretary of the party for a brief period in 1920. He belonged to the party leadership until 1924.&lt;ref name="statsvet"&gt;''[http://www.sciecom.org/ojs/index.php/st/article/viewFile/2934/2497 Berör ytterligheterna varandra? Om renegater/överlöpare från kommunism/socialism till fascismAollaboration 1920-1945: En jämförande analys]''&lt;/ref&gt; Toman represented the Communist Party of Austria at the second (1920) and third congresses (1921) of the [[Communist International]]. He took part in the fifth congress of the Communist International in 1924 as a non-voting delegate, representing of the inner-party minority in Austria. He was expelled from the party on August 31, 1924.&lt;ref name="de"/&gt;

In August 1925 he was readmitted to the Communist Party as a member. He worked with the [[Red International of Labour Unions]] (Profintern), having been appointed secretary of the Trade Union Sector of the [[Central Committee]] of the Communist Party in 1928. At the Profintern congress of 1930, held in [[Moscow]], Toman was elected to the central council of the international body. He moved to Moscow, working as instructor at the Organizational Department of Profintern. Toman relocation to the Soviet Union was seen as a way of resolving the fractional frictions inside the Austrian Communist Party.&lt;ref name="de"/&gt;

In the Soviet Union, Toman was accused of mismanagement of funds. In September 1931 he was sacked from Profintern. He was given a new employment at a sailor's club in [[Leningrad]], politically demoted. Having returned to Austria in 1932, Toman was finally stripped of his Communist Party membership.&lt;ref name="de"/&gt;

Toman joined the [[Revolutionary Socialists (Austria)|Revolutionary Socialists]] in 1934. He was detained at the [[Wöllersdorf]] prison camp, but was released in 1935. After ''[[Anschluss]]'' (German annexation of Austria in 1938) Toman was threatened with imprisonment at the [[Dachau concentration camp]]. He was however able to negotiate a release from captivity, citing his expulsion from the Communist Party. He undertook a loyalty oath to the [[Third Reich]]. In April 1938 German authorities appointed him as a member of the local administration of [[Eichgraben]].&lt;ref name="de"/&gt; In January 1940 he joined the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] (NSDAP) and [[Sturmabteilung|SA]].&lt;ref name="de"/&gt;

Toman was captured by Soviet troops in May 1945. He died in a Soviet [[Gulag]] on February 5, 1950.&lt;ref name="de"/&gt; There are very few documented cases of former Austrian communists having joined the NSDAP, Toman being the most prominent amongst them. There is little written about Toman's political journey, but speculation points towards blunt opportunism.&lt;ref name="statsvet"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1875">'''Kenneth Brumley''' (born 1968) is one of the heaviest people ever recorded, whose [[weight]] was confirmed. He was featured on the [[Channel 4]] ''[[BodyShock]]'' documentary "Half Ton Dad", as a father of four, who weighed 1,033 pounds (468&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/science/microsites/B/bodyshock/half_ton_dad/index.html|title=Half-Ton Dad|publisher=Channel 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, Brumley played [[basketball]], [[baseball]] and [[American football]] which kept his weight average, but after a move to California at age 19, he stopped playing and the weight began to accumulate. At his heaviest, Brumley had a daily caloric intake of approximately 30,000 cal.&lt;ref name="Sun" /&gt;

According to Kenneth Brumley's statements in the documentary, he had been bed-bound for fifteen years. After he was accepted as a [[gastric bypass]] patient at the Renaissance Hospital in [[Houston]], a fire crew had to hammer down a wall in Brumley’s house to get him out.&lt;ref name="Sun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/real_life/article1159633.ece|title=Living hell of the half ton dad|first=David|last=Lowe|publisher=The Sun|date=13 May 2008|accessdate=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Renaissance Hospital, Brumley was treated by the specialist team that treated [[Renee Williams]], believed to have been the world's heaviest woman at the time. The first step in Brumley's treatment was a diet restricted to 1200 calories per day, which made him lose 167.5 pounds (76&amp;nbsp;kg) in only 40 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvscoop.tv/2008/05/tv_review_half_3.html|title=TV Review: Half Ton Dad|publisher=TV Scoop.tv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Konstanze Krüger''' (née ''Konstanze Deubner'', born 22 January 1968) is a [[Germany|German]] [[Zoology|zoologist]] and behaviour researcher. She is Professor of Horse Management at [[Nürtingen-Geislingen University of Applied Science]], and her special field of research is the social system of [[horse]]s.&lt;ref name="pferdplus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cavallo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mustangcamp" /&gt;

== Scientific career ==
Krüger studied veterinary medicine at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] (LMU). After completing her studies in 1996, she accepted a position as scientific assistant at the Institute for Animal Anatomy and Histology at the LMU in Munich.

From April 1999 to February 2006, she ran the Einthal Equestrian Park in Obertraubling, together with her husband. From June 2004, she held a research position at Biology 1 in the department of Zoology at the University of Regensburg, researching social learning and social cognition in horses. In October 2008 she organised the 1st International Equine Science Meeting.&lt;ref name="equine-science 2008" /&gt; On 1 March 2012, she became Germany’s first Professor of Horse Management, taking charge of the department at the [[Nürtingen-Geislingen University of Applied Science]]. In March 2012, she organised the 2nd International Equine Science Meeting at the University of Regensburg, sponsored by the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|DFG]].&lt;ref name="dfg" /&gt; In Okctober 2012, she was promoted to the position of Professor of Zoology at the University of Regensburg.&lt;ref name="uni-r" /&gt;

== Research focus ==
* Social cognition in horses &lt;ref name="horseandcountry.tv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eventingnation.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="horsetalk.co.nz"/&gt;
* Social ecology of horses
* Innovative Behaviour in horse &lt;ref name="Innovative Behaviour in Horses" /&gt;

== Methods ==
* Longterm field Studies
* Social Network Analysis
* Hierarchy Calculations
* Behaviour Test

== Practical application of research in equestrian sport and horse management ==
*Behaviour of horses in the "round pen technique"&lt;ref name="Krueger" /&gt;
: The behaviour of horses in the [[Join-Up-Method]] is a learned response specific to a particular location, and not a natural "language" as claimed by [[Monty Roberts]] in his books. The research explains how and why this training can be generalised to other people and places and therefore be an important tool in the training of horses.

*Horse sense: social status of horses (Equus caballus) affects their likelihood of copying other horses&lt;ref name="Krueger Heinze" /&gt;
:This research supports the opinion of many equestrian experts that it is wise to use an experienced horse to demonstrate new exercises to horses in training.&lt;ref name="Robert N. Oglesby DVM
" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Equus_Houpt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Equus Barakat, Christine; McCluskey, Mick" /&gt; It also reveals that only horses from the same social group are suitable demonstrators.

*Visual laterality in the domestic horse (Equus caballus) interacting with humans&lt;ref name="Farmer Krueger Byrne" /&gt;
: According to the situation, horses sometimes prefer to observe things with their left eye, and sometimes with the right. For every day training purposes, it is best to allow horses to observe a potentially dangerous object with its left eye until it calms down.

*Third-party interventions keep social partners from exchanging affiliative interactions with others&lt;ref name="Schneider Krueger" /&gt;
: This study demonstrates that it is important when keeping horses in groups to ensure that the groups are composed of horses of mixed ages.

== Scientific importance of the research ==
For the last 30 years, horses have been described as being incapable of demonstrating social learning (Baer et al. 1983.;&lt;ref name="Baer et al 1983" /&gt; Baker and Crawford 1986;&lt;ref name="Baker Crawford" /&gt; Clarke et al. 1996;&lt;ref name="Clarke et al 1996" /&gt; Lindberg et al. 1999&lt;ref name="Lindberg et al 1999" /&gt;) because the social complexity of horses was underestimated and the experimental designs were therefore not suitably constructed. In several studies this was taken into account, and for the first time horses did show social learning. This has important implications for other species in which social learning has similarly not been shown. The experimental design for these species should now be reconsidered and new experiments conducted in which the social aspects of the species are taken into account.

'''László Simon''' (July 16, 1948 &amp;ndash; September 9, 2009) was an [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[pianist]].

==Professional life==
László Simon was born in [[Miskolc]]. He studied under Zoltán Benkö in Budapest, and under [[Hans Leygraf]] in Stockholm and Hannoer. He also received article and pianistic suggestions from [[Claudio Arrau]] in New York. He would later be praised for his excellent performance in international piano competitions Casagrande (1971, 1st place, jointly shared), [[Geneva International Music Competition|Geneva]] and [[Ferruccio Busoni International Piano Competition|Busoni]] and received the King's Swedish Music Award. His recording of the twelfth ''[[Transcendental Études]]'' by [[Franz Liszt]] was later part of the evidence in the plagiarism scandal involving recordings by the English pianist [[Joyce Hatto]] (1928-2006),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/feb/25/entertainment/ca-hatto25|title=D ON THE BLOGS - This won't help the pianist's cause|date=25 February 2007|author=Chris Pasles|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became more famous as a result of the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Neue Zürcher Zeitung: [http://www.nzz.ch/2007/03/04/fe/articleEYQ9O.html Ein Schwindel von seltener Dreistigkeit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102192015/http://www.nzz.ch/2007/03/04/fe/articleEYQ9O.html |date=2009-01-02 }} Marth 4, 2007, accessed on September 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

László Simon was a respected piano teacher throughout the world. After working in Darmstadt, Hannover and Karlsruhe, he became a professor at the [[Berlin University of the Arts]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eclassical.com/performers/simon-laszlo/|title=László Simon |publisher=eClassical |date=|first=|last=|accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this position, he mentored the conductress [[Sung Shi-yeon|Shi-yeon Sung]] as well as the pianists [[Gergely Boganyi]], Li-Chun Su and [[You Ji-yeoun|Ji-yeoun You]]. He died in [[Berlin]], aged 61.

==Press coverage==

D.A.W.M.: ''Remarkable Liszt''. In: The Daily Telegraph (1975)

{{blockquote|Laszlo Simon ... is a distinguished artist, having not only a stupendous technique with an unusually large and sonorous tone, but also ripe experience and deep familiarity with the music of Schubert, Beethoven, and Liszt. Only a completely equipped player could have given such a remarkable performance of the Liszt Sonata, soaring into its heights and bringing out every modulation in its depth and without the slightest loss of tonal purity. Claritiy and directness of manner also served Mr Simon well in Beethoven's Sonata in D minor Op. 31 No. 2. The melodic line of the Adagio was beautifully shaped and having such a command of legato, he could probably have taken the whole movement a shade more slowly without losing impetus.}}

D.A.W.M.: ''László Simon''. In: The Daily Telegraph (Feb. 1977)

{{blockquote|The Hungarian pianist László Simon chose music by his great compatriots Liszt and Bartók, for his return visit to London last night. 
His strong and skilful fingers produced patterns of sound in Bartók's ''Suite'', the scherzo and the allegro third movement beinig played with a stronger tone than is usual. Mr Simon's prowess was in keeping with the brilliant, extrovert qualities of the Bartók Sonata, the big stretches in the last movement having no terrors for him, yet sometimes his playing was a little too rigid rhythmically to sustain the stark drama of the quick movements.
Mr Simon's performance of Liszt's ''Funérailles'' and ''Ricordanza'' were both exciting and lyrical, and the ''Mephisto Waltz'' revealed the technical command and the craftsmanlike apitude of this young and vital player.}}

Dominic Gill: ''Laszlo Simon''. In: London Financial Times (1977)

{{blockquote|The Hungarian pianist László Simon divided his recital in the Purcell Room last Friday between Bartók and Liszt. It was no fault of his that the extraordinary Liszt playing of Jorge Bolet the previous evening was still ringing so powerfully in our ears; but certain comparisons were unavoidable. They were also unfortunate, for Mr. Simon is an exceptionally talented young artist: he has a strong technique, and a searching, individual way with the familiar romantic repertory that showed a refreshing contempt for easy cliché: his manner is quick and confident, and he is not afraid, when necessary to push himself to his limits.}}

'''Maria Skobtsova''' (20 [8 [[Old Calendar]]] December 1891 in Riga – 31 March 1945 in [[Ravensbrück concentration camp]], Germany), known as ''Mother Maria'' ({{lang-ru|Мать Мария}}), Saint Mary (or Mother Maria) of Paris, born ''Elizaveta Yurievna Pilenko'' (Елизавета Юрьевна Пиленко), ''Kuzmina-Karavayeva'' (Кузьмина-Караваева) by her first marriage, ''Skobtsova'' (Скобцова) by her second marriage, was a [[Russian nobility|Russian noblewoman]], [[poet]], [[nun]], and member of the [[French Resistance]] during [[World War II]]. She has been [[canonization|canonized]] a [[saint]] in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].

==Life==
[[File:Maria Skobtsova Commemorative Plaque (Saint Petersburg) 19Jun10.JPG|thumb|left|220px|Maria Skobtsova Commemorative Plaque in Saint Petersburg]]
Born to an aristocratic family in 1891 in [[Riga]], [[Latvia]], then part of the [[Russian Empire]].  She was given the name Elizaveta Pilenko.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Koulomzin |first1= Sophie |year= |title= Mother Mary |journal= Upbeat |volume= 12 |issue= 1 |pages= |url= http://www.orthodoxed.org/files/Mother_Mary.pdf |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father died when she was a teenager, and she embraced [[atheism]]. In 1906 her mother moved the family to [[St. Petersburg]], where she became involved in radical intellectual circles. In 1910 she married a [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] by the name of [[Dmitriy Kuz'min-Karavaev]]. During this period of her life she was actively involved in literary circles and wrote much poetry. Her first book, Scythian Shards (Скифские черепки), was a collection of poetry from this period. By 1913 her marriage to Dimitriy had ended and the latter subsequently became Eastern Orthodox.

Through a look at the humanity of [[Christ]] — "He also died. He sweated blood. They struck his face" — she began to be drawn back into Christianity. She moved—now with her daughter, Gaiana—to the south of Russia where her religious devotion increased.

Furious at [[Leon Trotsky]] for closing the [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]] Congress, she planned his [[assassination]], but was dissuaded by colleagues, who sent her to [[Anapa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Paldiel |first1= Mordechai |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title= Saving the Jews : amazing stories of men and women who defied the "Final Solution |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=gRdUvDLC3pgC&amp;pg=PA211&amp;lpg=PA211&amp;dq=%22elizabeth+pilenko%22+saint&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=P-_545ZU-R&amp;sig=uz-S1wOh1buAmHDkKZ_jde5lm28&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KMCBS5HLEtWwngfk8KGdBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |year= 2000 |publisher= Scribner |location= Rockville, Maryland |isbn= 978-1-887563-55-0 |oclc= 231868099

In 1918, after the [[Bolshevik Revolution]], she was elected deputy mayor of Anapa in Southern Russia. When the [[anti-communist]] [[White Army]] took control of Anapa, the mayor fled and she became mayor of the town. The White Army put her on trial for being a Bolshevik. However, the judge was a former teacher of hers, Daniel Skobtsov, and she was acquitted. Soon the two fell in love and were married.

Soon, the political tide was turning again. In order to avoid danger, Elizaveta, Daniel, Gaiana, and Elizaveta's mother Sophia fled the country. Elizaveta was pregnant with her second child. They traveled first to [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (where her son Yuri was born) and then to [[Yugoslavia]] (where her daughter Anastasia was born). Finally they arrived in [[Paris]] in 1923. Soon Elizaveta was dedicating herself to theological studies and social work.

In 1926, Anastasia died of influenza. Gaiana was sent away to [[Belgium]] to boarding school. Soon, Daniel and Elizaveta's marriage was falling apart. Yuri ended up living with Daniel, and Elizaveta moved into central Paris to work more directly with those who were most in need.

Her bishop encouraged her to take vows as a nun, something she did only with the assurance that she would not have to live in a monastery, secluded from the world. In 1932, with Daniel Skobtov's permission, an ecclesiastical divorce was granted and she took monastic vows. In religion she took the name Maria. Her confessor was Father [[Sergei Bulgakov]]. Later, Fr. [[Dmitri Klepinin]] would be sent to be the chaplain of the house.

Mother Maria made a rented house in Paris her "convent". It was a place with an open door for refugees, the needy and the lonely. It also soon became a center for intellectual and theological discussion. In Mother Maria these two elements—service to the poor and theology—went hand-in-hand.

==Death==
After the [[Fall of France]] in 1940, Jews began approaching the house asking for [[baptism]]al certificates, which Father Dimitri would provide them. Many Jews came to stay with them. They provided shelter and helped many to flee the country. Eventually the house was closed down. Mother Maria, Fr. Dimitri, Yuri and Sophia were all arrested by the [[Gestapo]]. Fr. Dimitri and Yuri both died at the [[Dora concentration camp]].

Mother Maria was sent to the [[Ravensbrück concentration camp]]. On [[Holy Saturday]], 1945, she failed a selection and was sent to the [[Gas Chamber]].

==Canonization==
Mother Maria was [[Canonization|glorified]] (canonized a [[saint]]) by act of the [[Synod|Holy Synod]] of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate]] on 16 January 2004. The glorification of Mother Maria, together with Fr. Dimitri, Yuri, and Ilya Fondaminsky took place at the Cathedral of Saint Alexander Nevsky in Paris on 1 and 2 May 2004. Their feast day is 20 July.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ukrainian-orthodoxy.org/saints/saints_new/martyr.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Her life is dramatized in a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] film starring [[Lyudmila Kasatkina]].

According to [[Metropolitan Anthony (Bloom) of Sourozh]]:
"Mother Maria is a saint of our day and for our day; a woman of flesh and blood possessed by the love of God, who stood face to face with the problems of this century."

==Example of poetry==
In July, 1942, when the order requiring Jews to wear the [[yellow badge|yellow star]] was published, she wrote a poem entitled "Israel":

:Two triangles, a star,
:The shield of King David, our forefather.
:This is election, not offense.
:The great path and not an evil.
:Once more in a term fulfilled,
:Once more roars the trumpet of the end;
:And the fate of a great people
:Once more is by the prophet proclaimed.
:Thou art persecuted again, O Israel,
:But what can human malice mean to thee,
:who have heard the thunder from Sinai?

'''Mona Vasquez''' (1960 – 2 September 2011) was a former [[Scientologist]] who was active in [[Scientology]]'s headquarters in Europe, in [[Copenhagen]], in the 1980s.  She went on a [[hunger strike]] in August 1989 at Scientology's offices in [[Paris]] when she wanted to quit the program, in order to get her money back.  She did receive almost €60,000 back from Scientology.

Mona is a painter, and established&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Woljung |first=Eric |date=7 October 2004|title=Le monde de Mona Vasquez |url=http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2004/10/07/255987-le-monde-de-mona-vasquez.html |newspaper=La Depeche |location= |accessdate=19 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; artist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=L'artiste peintre Mona Vasquez inaugure la nouvelle galerie 113 |url= http://www.lindependant.fr/2011/05/13/l-artiste-peintre-mona-vasquez-inaugure-la-nouvelle-galerie-113,17651.php|newspaper=L'Independant |location= |date=13 May 2011|accessdate=19 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and poet.&lt;ref name="topique"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lamote  |first=Thierry |date= |title=Par-delà la manipulation mentale : la violence insidieuse de l'église de scientologie |url=http://cairn.info/revue-topique-2010-2-page-177.htm |journal=Topique |publisher= |volume=2 |issue=111 |pages=177–195 |doi=10.3917/top.111.0177|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has written an autobiography in which she recounts her experiences with Scientology, "Et Satan créa la Secte, Mémoires d’une rescapée".

==Experiences with Scientology==
Vasquez says she was initially introduced to Scientology by reading a friend's books.&lt;ref name=echo&gt;[http://www.anti-scientologie.ch/temoignage-echomagazine.htm Echo Magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618134347/http://anti-scientologie.ch/temoignage-echomagazine.htm |date=2006-06-18 }}, interview with Mona Vasquez, October 2004, "Scientology, a true control".&lt;br/&gt;"The first time where I was challenged by the sect, it was by a friend. I was at the end of my second year in Art school in [[Toulouse]]. I read all kinds of books and the first contact was done thus, in 1982. I saw nothing suspicious and the brainwashing started."&lt;/ref&gt; There, she says, she became part of an organisation under "tight control... from the mother church".&lt;ref name=ReportUrges&gt;{{cite web | first = John-Thor | last = Dahlburg | title = Report Urges Dissolution of Scientology Church in France | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2000/feb/29/news/mn-3701 | work =  | publisher = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = 2000-02-29 | accessdate = 2008-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She says she attempted to leave three times in this period, always coming back.&lt;ref&gt;[http://prevensectes.com/mona1.htm prison sans barreaux, scientologie, sortir d'une secte&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; After being convicted of making illegal loans, which she argued had been encouraged by Scientology, she was set free from jail on the condition that she not attempt to contact members of the Scientology organisation.&lt;ref name="lacroix"&gt;{{cite news |last=Mona |first=Vasquez |date=4 June 2004 |title=La prison sans barreaux |url=http://prevensectes.com/mona1.htm |newspaper=La Croix |location=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326080606/http://prevensectes.com/mona1.htm |archivedate=March 26, 2012|accessdate=19 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She finally rejected Scientology. With money tight, she sought the return of money she had paid to Scientology for books and training courses. After a ten-day hunger strike in Paris in August 1989 covered by [[France 2|Antenne 2]], the Scientology organization returned around ₣100,000 of her money to her.&lt;ref name=echo/&gt;

Since then, she has testified before the [[Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France]],&lt;ref name=ReportUrges/&gt; and continued to paint and write.

She died on 2 September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Décès de Mona Vasquez |url=http://www.unadfi.org/deces-de-mona-vasquez.html |publisher=[[UNADFI]] |language=French |accessdate=13 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120915094916/http://www.unadfi.org/deces-de-mona-vasquez.html |archivedate=15 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oliba Cabreta''' (c. 920 – 990 in [[Montecassino]]) was the [[count of Cerdanya]] from 965 and [[count of Besalú]] from 984 until his abdication in 988. 

==Life==
He was the fourth son of [[Miró II of Cerdanya|Miró II]] and [[Ava of Cerdanya|Ava]]. He inherited Cerdanya from his eldest brother [[Sunifred II of Cerdanya|Sunifred II]] and Besalú from his elder brother [[Miró III of Cerdanya|Miró III]]. He was originally under the tutelage of his mother from his father's death in 927. 

During his tenure, he added [[Berga]] and [[Ripoll]] to his domains. In 979, [[Roger I of Carcassonne]] ceded [[Capcir]] to him. In 984, he assumed the direction of all his father's counties when his last brother died without heirs. 

Oliba travelled twice to [[Rome]], first in 968 with the Abbot [[Garin of Cuixà]] and second in 988 on his journey to [[Montecassino]], the monastery to which he retired. He divided his lands betwixt his three eldest sons: [[Bernard I of Besalú|Bernard]] received Besalú and Ripoll, [[Wilfred II of Cerdanya|Wilfred]] received Cerdanya, and [[Abbot Oliva|Oliba]] received Berga. His fourth son, Berengar, became [[bishop of Elne]]. He also had a legitimate daughter named Adelaide, who married John d'Oriol, lord of [[Sales]]. By his mistress, Ingeberga de Besora, he had a daughter named Ingeberga who became [[abbess]] of [[Sant Joan de Ripoll]]. His wife [[Ermengard of Empúries]], daughter of Count [[Gausbert]], acted as [[regent]] for his sons and he lived out his days in Italy until 990. 

==Issue== 
He had issue:
* [[Bernard I, Count of Besalú]] (died 1020)
* [[Wifred II, Count of Cerdanya]] c. 970-1050
* [[Abbot Oliba]] c. 971–1046

'''Olivia Rossetti Agresti''' (30 September 1875 &amp;ndash; 6 November 1960) was a British activist, author, editor, and [[interpreting|interpreter]]. A member of one of England's most prominent artistic and literary families, her unconventional political trajectory began with [[anarchism]], continued with the [[League of Nations]], and ended with [[Italian fascism]]. Her involvement with the latter led to an important correspondence and friendship with [[Ezra Pound]], who mentions her twice in his ''[[The Cantos|Cantos]]''.

== Anarchism ==

Olivia Rossetti Agresti was born in London to [[William Michael Rossetti]], one of the seven founding members of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] and the editor of its literary magazine ''[[The Germ (periodical)|The Germ]]''. A granddaughter of [[Gabriele Rossetti]] and [[Ford Madox Brown]], she was hence a niece of [[Maria Francesca Rossetti]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Christina Rossetti]], as well as a first cousin of [[Ford Madox Ford]].

While still in their girlhood, Olivia and her sister, the future Helen Rossetti Angeli (1879-1969), began publishing an anarchist journal, ''The Torch'', in the basement of their family home. Despite their youth, this effort became the nucleus of a prominent anarchist salon which included [[Peter Kropotkin]] and [[Sergei Kravchinski]], and their publishing coups included the pamphlet ''Why I Am an Anarchist'' by [[George Bernard Shaw]]. Years later, using the pseudonym "Isabel Meredith", Olivia and Helen published ''A Girl Among the Anarchists'', a somewhat fictionalized memoir of their days as precocious child revolutionaries. These adventures were also chronicled by their cousin Ford Madox Ford in his 1931 memoir ''Return to Yesterday''.&lt;ref&gt;Olivia Rossetti Agresti Papers. Yale Collection of American Literature, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library Finding Aid. "[http://hdl.handle.net/10079/fa/beinecke.agresti]"&lt;/ref&gt;

A more permanent consequence of this political activity was Olivia's marriage in 1897 to the Italian anarchist and journalist Antonio Agresti (1866-1926), which led to her emigration from England to Italy. Olivia was to remain there for the rest of her life and she eventually became an Italian citizen. During her first years in Italy she continued with literary activities related to her political activism, including a biography of the Italian painter and revolutionary [[Giovanni Costa]].

== Internationalism ==

The second phase in Agresti's career began in 1904, when she met the American agricultural reformer [[David Lubin]]. A former department store and mail order magnate from [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], Lubin was in Rome seeking a state sponsor for his idea of an international clearinghouse for agricultural statistics. Unable to speak Italian, Lubin hired Agresti as his interpreter and thus began a close collaboration between the two which continued until Lubin's death.

With Agresti's assistance, Lubin's efforts in Italy made history. After gaining the unexpected support of Italy's king [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]], Lubin's vision became a reality with the 1905 founding of the [[International Institute of Agriculture]], headquartered in Rome. The first modern international organization, it was hailed as a significant forerunner of [[world government]] by such luminaries as [[H. G. Wells]] and [[Louis Brandeis]]. Agresti includes samples of Lubin's correspondence with Wells and Brandeis in her 1922 biography ''David Lubin: A Study in Practical Idealism''.

Following Lubin's death in 1919, Agresti waged a public campaign for close cooperation between the International Institute of Agriculture and the nascent [[League of Nations]], which soon employed her as a member of the staff to Italy's delegation. She continued as a staff interpreter for the League in Geneva from 1922 to 1930. Her last assignment as a professional interpreter occurred in 1945 when, at the personal request of Italy's prime minister, [[Alcide De Gasperi]], she accompanied him to London for meetings of the [[Council of Foreign Ministers]]. According to her unpublished memoirs, meetings at which Agresti interpreted included [[Ernest Bevin]] and [[Vyacheslav Molotov]].

== Fascism ==

By 1921 Agresti's early anarchist leanings, further leavened by years of exposure to Lubin's theories concerning [[cooperative]] organization of society, had transformed her into an enthusiastic supporter of [[corporatism]] and, consequently, of [[Benito Mussolini]]'s corporatist reorganization of the Italian economy. From 1921 to 1943 she edited the newsletter of the ''Associazione fra le Società per Azioni'', a group then closely allied with the Fascists, and in 1938 co-authored the theoretical work ''The Organization of the Arts and Professions in the Fascist Guild State'' with the Fascist journalist [[:It:Mario Missiroli|Mario Missiroli]].

In 1937, Agresti's editorship of economic journals brought her into professional contact with [[Ezra Pound]], then residing in Italy and writing articles in Italian on economic topics. Thus began a long correspondence between the two which lasted until 1959, the year before Agresti's death. Agresti seems to have been unaware of Pound's fame as a poet, and Pound unaware of Agresti's family ties to [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Ford Madox Ford]], two of the most important influences on his poetry, until years into the correspondence. Portions of this correspondence were edited and published in 1998 by the [[University of Illinois Press]].

Agresti became practically a member of Pound's extended family as the years progressed, and she and her two adopted Italian daughters were frequent guests at [[Schloss Brunnenburg]]. She was active for years in the international campaign to free Pound from his involuntary incarceration in a mental asylum by the government of the United States, and Pound in turn tried to assist her, then suffering from an impecunious old age, by finding a publisher for her memoirs. Pound refers to Agresti twice in his ''[[The Cantos|Cantos]]''.

'''Orville Elias Babcock''' (December 25, 1835 &amp;ndash; June 2, 1884) was an engineer, and [[American Civil War]] [[General officer|general]] in the [[Union Army]]. An aide to General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] during and after the war, he was [[President of the United States|President]] Grant's private secretary at the White House, Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds for [[Washington D.C.]], and a Florida-based federal inspector of lighthouses. Babcock continued to serve as lighthouse inspector under Grant's successors [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], [[James A. Garfield]], and [[Chester A Arthur]]. 

A native of Vermont, Babcock graduated third in his class at [[United States Military Academy at West Point|West Point]] in 1861, and served in the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] throughout the Civil War. As Assistant Engineer and [[aide-de-camp]] for district commander [[Nathaniel P. Banks]], in 1862 Babcock worked on fortifications to aid in defending the nation's capitol from Confederate attack. Babcock later served as [[aide-de-camp]] for Ulysses S. Grant and participated in the [[Overland Campaign]]. He was promoted to [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[brigadier general]] in 1865 and continued on Grant's staff during [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]. In 1867, Babcock warned Grant of a white supremacist insurgency that used Confederate symbolism to intimidate blacks in the South. 

After Grant became President in 1869, Babcock was assigned Grant's [[Secretary to the President of the United States]]—in modern terms, the chief of staff—and he served until his departure from the White House in 1876. Babcock's salary was paid by the U.S. Army and he was not subject to Congressional approval. Grant also appointed Babcock Superintendent of Public Buildings and Grounds for Washington, DC. Babcock, at the time, was young and ambitious, and considered the [[Iago]] of the Grant administration. In 1869, Grant sent Babcock on a mission to explore the possibility of annexing the island nation of [[Dominican Republic|Santo Domingo]] to the United States, but the Senate led by [[Charles Sumner]] rejected the proposal. 

Babcock's tenure under President Grant was embroiled in corruption charges, and his manipulation of both cabinet departments and appointments. Grant supported Babcock when Babcock was accused of corruption; Grant's shielding of Babcock from political attack stemmed primarily from their shared experiences on the battlefield during the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name=DOAB_1928_p460/&gt;  When Babcock was indicted as a member of the [[Whiskey Ring]] in 1875, Grant believed it was an indictment on his presidency. He provided a written deposition on Babcock's behalf—a first for a sitting president—which was admitted at Babcock's 1876 trial and resulted in his acquittal.  The news coverage of the Whiskey Ring and other Grant administration scandals caused public opinion to turn against Babcock. Upon his return from St. Louis, Babcock was reluctant to leave his post, as if nothing happened, but under pressure from Secretary Fish, Grant forced Babcock to leave the White House.  

President Grant would not desert his wartime comrade; in February 1877, he appointed Babcock Inspector of Lighthouses for the Federal Lighthouse Board's Fifth District, a low-profile post that did not attract undue public attention. In 1882, President [[Chester A. Arthur]] additionally appointed Babcock Inspector of Lighthouses for the Federal Lighthouse Board's Sixth District. Babcock was the chief engineer overseeing plans for the construction of [[Ponce de Leon Inlet Light|Mosquito Inlet Lighthouse]].  He died in 1884 on duty when he drowned off Mosquito Inlet in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]]. Babcock's historical reputation is mixed; his technical engineering expertise, efficiency, bravery in battle, and [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] loyalty were offset by his involvement in corruption, deception, and scandal. Uncommon for his times, Babcock showed no racism in relations with [[African Americans]] or mixed race peoples, which was a key factor in Grant's decision to send Babcock to Santo Domingo, whose population was predominantly mixed race, and consisted of individuals with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]], [[Demographics of Africa|African]], and [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] ancestry.

==Early life ==
Orville E. Babcock was born on December 25, 1835 in [[Franklin, Vermont|Franklin]], [[Vermont]], a small town located near the [[Canada–United States border|Canada–US border]] close to [[Lake Champlain]]. Babcock's father was Elias Babcock Jr. and his mother was Clara Olmsted.&lt;ref name=DOAB_1928_p460&gt;Dictionary of American Biography (1928), ''Babcock, Orville E.'', p. 460&lt;/ref&gt;  While growing up in Vermont he received a common education.&lt;ref name="NYT_6_4_1884"&gt;New York Times (June 4, 1884) , ''Gen. Babcock Drowned''&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 16, Babcock was appointed to the [[United States Military Academy|West Point Military Academy]] (USMA), where he graduated third in a class of 45 on May 6, 1861.&lt;ref name="NYT_6_4_1884"/&gt;  His high class ranking enabled Babcock to select his branch, and he chose the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Engineers]], as did most top graduates of his era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Evan C. |last2=Sword |first2=Wiley |date=2014 |title=Gateway to the Confederacy: New Perspectives on the Chickamauga and Chattanooga Campaigns, 1862-1863 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VwM6AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA116 |location=Chapel Hill, NC |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |page=116 |isbn=978-0-8071-5512-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Babcock |first=Stephen |date=1903 |title=Isaiah Babcock, Sr. and his descendants |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dtcUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA776 |location=New York, NY |publisher=Eaton &amp; Mains |page=776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil War (1861–1865) ==

===Constructed Washington D.C. defense works===
The [[American Civil War]] was beginning as Babcock was graduating; he was commissioned as a [[Brevet (military)|Brevet]] [[Second Lieutenant]] in the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]], and assigned to duty as an Assistant Engineer for the military district that included Washington.  His first mission was the undertaking of efforts to improve the defensive works of Washington, D.C. and protect the city from attack.&lt;ref name=DOAB_1928_p460/&gt; On July 13, 1861, Babcock was assigned to the Department of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=DOAB_1928_p460/&gt;  In August, he received his commission as a second lieutenant, to date from his West Point graduation in May; he was assigned to the Department of the Shenandoah, and constructed military fortifications on the [[Potomac River]] and in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] while also serving as [[aide-de-camp]] under Major General [[Nathaniel P. Banks]].&lt;ref name=DOAB_1928_p460/&gt; From August through November, Babcock worked again on improving the fortifications surrounding Washington, responding to increased apprehension the Union capital was vulnerable to attack and capture by the [[Confederate Army]].&lt;ref name="NYT_6_4_1884"/&gt;

===Peninsular campaign===

On November 17, 1861, Babcock was promoted to [[First Lieutenant#United States|First Lieutenant]], Corps of Engineers, and a week later was assigned to the [[Army of the Potomac]].&lt;ref name="NYT_6_4_1884"/&gt; During the months of February and March, 1862, while General Banks moved to Winchester, Virginia, Babcock set up military fortifications at [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harper's Ferry]] and guarded [[pontoon bridge|pontoon]] bridges crossing the Potomac River.&lt;ref name="NYT_6_4_1884"/&gt; During the [[Peninsular Campaign]], Babcock served bravely at the [[Siege of Yorktown (1862)|Siege of Yorktown]] with the Army of the Potomac's Engineer Battalion and was breveted as a captain to rank from May 4, 1862.&lt;ref name="NYT_6_4_1884"/&gt; For the next seven months, Babcock built bridges, roads, and field works. For his service, in November, 1862, Babcock was promoted to Chief Engineer Left Grand Division of the Army of the Potomac.&lt;ref name="NYT_6_4_1884"/&gt;

In December 1862, during the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]], Babcock served on Brigadier General [[William B. Franklin]]'s engineering staff.&lt;ref name=DOAB_1928_p460/&gt;

===Vicksburg, Blue Springs, Campbell's Station===

On January 1, 1863, Babcock was promoted to permanent captain and brevet [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]], and was named the Assistant Inspector General of the [[VI Corps (ACW)|VI Corps]] until February 6, when he was named the Assistant Inspector General and Chief Engineer of the [[IX Corps (ACW)|IX Corps]].&lt;ref name="NYT_6_4_1884"/&gt; As Chief Engineer of the IX Corps, Babcock surveyed and projected the defensive fortifications at [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] and Central Kentucky.&lt;ref name="NYT_6_4_1884"/&gt; Moving westward to help secure the Mississippi River from Confederate control and divide the Confederacy in two, Babcock fought with the IX Corps at the [[Battle of Vicksburg]] and the [[Battle of Blue Springs]], and the [[Battle of Campbell's Station]].&lt;ref name="NYT_6_4_1884"/&gt;

===Knoxville campaign===
[[file:Kurz &amp; Allison - Assault on Fort Sanders.jpg|thumb|left|220px|&lt;center&gt;'''Battle of Fort Sanders'''&lt;/center&gt;]]

Babcock was part of [[XXIII Corps (Union Army)|XXIII Corps]], and served under Union engineer Captain [[Orlando M. Poe]]. Poe and Union engineers, that included Babcock, built several fortifications in the form of bastioned earthworks near Knoxville. One was Fort Sanders, just west of downtown Knoxville across a creek valley. It was named for [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brig. Gen.]] [[William P. Sanders]], mortally wounded in a skirmish outside Knoxville on November 18, 1863.{{sfn|''The Longest Night''|pages=615-616}} The fort, had an innovative design, and was a salient in the line of earthworks that surrounded three sides of the city, rose {{convert|70|ft|m}} above the surrounding plateau and was protected by a ditch {{convert|12|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|8|ft|m}} deep.{{sfn|''The Longest Night''|pages=615-616}} An almost insurmountable vertical wall rose {{convert|15|ft|m}} above the ditch, slippery and frozen.{{sfn|''The Longest Night''|pages=615-616}} Inside the fort were 12 cannons and 440 men of the 79th New York Infantry. In front of the ditch, telegraph wires were strung at knee height across tree stumps, possibly the first use of such wire entanglements in the Civil War, to entangle Confederate soldiers that would assault the Fort.{{sfn|''The Longest Night''|pages=615-616}}

The Battle of Fort Sanders was brutal by 19th Century standards.{{sfn|''The Longest Night''|pages=615-616}} The Confederates moved to within 120-150 yards of the salient during the night of freezing rain and snow and waited for the order to attack.{{sfn|''The Longest Night''|pages=615-616}} Entangled by the telegraph wire, Confederate soldiers were shot by Union soldiers atop the wall.{{sfn|''The Longest Night''|pages=615-616}} After crossing the ditch, the Confederates were unable to dig footholds, men climbed upon each other's shoulders to attempt to reach the top of the wall. Union soldiers rained fire into the assault, including musketry, canister, and artillery shells thrown as hand grenades. A succession of color bearers was shot down as they planted their flags on the fort. For a brief time, three flags reached the top, those of the 16th Georgia, 13th Mississippi, and 17th Mississippi. After 40 minutes of battle, the Confederates broke and retreated. The battle ended in a lopsided Union victory.

After fighting in the [[Knoxville Campaign]], at the [[Battle of Fort Sanders]], Babcock became the Chief Engineer of the [[Department of the Ohio]] and was promoted to brevet major on November 29, 1863.&lt;ref name="NYT_6_4_1884"/&gt;

===Overland Campaign===

Babcock was promoted to lieutenant colonel in the regular army on March 29, 1864 and became the aide-de-camp to Lieutenant General [[Ulysses S. Grant]]  participating in [[Overland Campaign]] against General [[Robert E. Lee]] and the Confederate [[Army of Northern Virginia]].{{sfn|White|2016|p=xvii}} Babcock served in the [[Battle of the Wilderness]], the [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House]], and the [[Battle of Cold Harbor]].&lt;ref name="NYT_6_4_1884"/&gt;

For his gallant service at the Battle of the Wilderness, Babcock was appointed [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]], U.S. Volunteers, to rank from May 6, 1864.&lt;ref name=Eicher111&gt;{{cite book| author = | last = Eicher | first = John H. | author2 = | last2 = Eicher | first2 = David J. | authorlink2 = David J.

Sherman]] during [[Sherman's March to the Sea]] campaign.&lt;ref name="NYT_6_4_1884"/&gt;

===Appomattox: Lee surrenders to Grant===
[[image:Lee Surrenders to Grant at Appomattox.jpg |180px|right|thumb|Robert E. Lee surrender to Ulysses S. Grant at the McLean House on April 9, 1865]]
On April 9, 1865 after being defeated at the [[Appomattox Campaign|Battle of Appomattox]], Commanding Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]] formally surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia to [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. Babcock personally chose the site of surrender at the McLean House,&lt;ref name="NYT_6_4_1884"/&gt; personally escorted Lee to the meeting,&lt;ref name="NYT_6_4_1884"/&gt; and witnessed Grant and Lee discussing and signing the surrender terms.&lt;ref name="NYT_6_4_1884"/&gt;

For his meritorious contributions in the Civil War, Babcock was appointed brevet colonel, to rank from March 13, 1865.&lt;ref name=Eicher111/&gt;  On July 17, 1866, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] nominated Babcock for brevet brigadier general in the regular army, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the [[United States Senate]] confirmed the appointment on July 23, 1866.&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, 2001, p. 732.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the War, Babcock remained on Grant's staff throughout America's turbulent [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction Period]].  On July 25, 1866, Brig. Gen. Babcock was commissioned Colonel of Staff and aide-de-camp for General-in-Chief of the Army, Ulysses S. Grant.&lt;ref name="NYT_6_4_1884"/&gt;{{sfn|Kirshner 1999|p=133}} On March 21, 1867 Babcock received a Regular Army commission as a major in the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]].&lt;ref name="NYT_6_4_1884"/&gt;{{sfn|Kirshner 1999|p=133}}

On November 6, 1866, Babcock married Anne Eliza Cambell in [[Galena, Illinois]].{{sfn|Kirshner 1999|p=132}} Their marriage produced four children: Campbell E. Babcock, Orville E. Babcock, Jr., Adolph B. Babcock, and Benjamin Babcock. Benjamin died during infancy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newberry.org/collections/FindingAids/babcock/Babcock.html Inventory of the Orville E. Babcock Papers] (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Babcock moved to Washington D.C. to serve under Grant while Grant was Commanding General and President of the United States.

===Reported on South (1867)===
In mid-April Commanding General Grant dispatched Babcock and [[Horace Porter]], another member of Grant's staff, to report on the progress of Southern Reconstruction.{{sfn|Chernow|2017|p=588}} Babcock and Porter were optimistic on the plight of blacks who had embraced citizenship saying the "negro is learning very fast. They will soon be the best educated ''class'' in the South, if they continue at their present rate of progress."{{sfn|Chernow|2017|p=588}} However, Babcock discovered and informed Grant of a white supremacist insurgency and Confederate symbolism were developing that intimidated [[African Americans]], saying that in Georgia the "police in most of the cities are in a grey uniform, the real ''confederate'' uniform."{{sfn|Chernow|2017|p=588}}

===President Grant's military secretary (1869–1876)===
In 1868, Ulysses S. Grant was elected the 18th President of the United States. In 1869, General Babcock was assigned Grant's military [[Secretary to the President (US)|private secretary]].&lt;ref name="reeves59"&gt;{{cite book | last = Reeves | first = Thomas C. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Gentleman Boss | publisher = Alfred A. Knopf | year = 1975 | location = NY, NY | page = 59 | isbn = 0-394-46095-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babcock worked directly for President Grant.  Babcock, one of a few men who had daily access to President Grant at the White House, had unprecedented influence over President Grant and planted suspicions in Grant that enemies were out to politically destroy his administration. His influence even extended indirectly into many cabinet departments and he was at odds with reformers, that included Secretary Fish and Secretary Bristow, who both had desired to save Grant's reputation from scandal. When cabinet appointments came available, Grant listened to Babcock's recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward (1957), ''The Lowest Ebb''&lt;/ref&gt; Babcock, who was admired by Grant for his [[American Civil War|Civil War]] service, was young and ambitious and considered the [[Iago]] of the Grant administration.{{sfn|Simon 2002|p=249}}

====Gatekeeper to Grant====
Babcock was 33 years old at the time of Grant's inauguration.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=78}} He retained his position in the U.S. Army under Sherman, who under special arrangement with Grant was allowed to be the President's personal secretary.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=77}} Babcock did not require Senate confirmation for his appointment, while he retained his military salary.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=77}} Babcock's duties included involvement in patronage matters, finding dirt on Grant's administration critics, and feeding political stories to pro-Grant newspapers.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=78}}  

Babcock's office was in an anteroom on the second floor of the White House that led to President Grant's private office.{{sfn|Kirshner 1999|p=133}} In order to see Grant, visitors had to go through Babcock,{{sfn|Kirshner 1999|p=133}} a circumstance that caused many to resent Babcock's insider role, and created a negative perception among contemporaries that overrode Babcock's positive attributes.{{sfn|Kirshner 1999|p=133}}  Babcock also opened and answered most of Grant's personal letters,{{sfn|Kirshner 1999|p=133}} and historian [[Allan Nevins]] argued that Babcock's position was as at least as important as the Cabinet secretaries, and more powerful than most.{{sfn|Kirshner 1999|p=133}}

====Santo Domingo annextation (1869-1871)====
{{see|Annexation of Santo Domingo}}
[[image:Santo Domingo City Taylor 1871.tif|thumb|left|220px|&lt;center&gt;Santo Domingo City '''''1871'''''&lt;/center&gt;]]
After his appointment, in 1869, Babcock was involved as a special agent of President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in the attempt to annex the mostly black [[Caribbean]] island country of the [[Dominican Republic]] (''18,655 mi²''), then commonly called ''Santo Domingo''.{{sfn|Pletcher|1998|p=164}} At this time, federal land speculation was not uncommon, as Congress had in March 1867, [[Alaska Purchase|purchased Alaska]] (''663,300 mi²'') from the [[Russian Empire]].{{sfn|Chernow|2017|p=661}} Like his predecessor, [[Andrew Johnson]], Grant received inducements for Caribbean expansion particularly for [[Haiti]] and the Dominican Republic.{{sfn|Pletcher|1998|p=163}} Speculators William L. Cazneau and Joseph W. Fabens formed the ''Santo Domingo Company'' in New York to gain investment backers for the annexation of the Dominican Republic.{{sfn|Pletcher|1998|p=163}} Grant's Secretary of State [[Hamilton Fish]], was doubtful concerning Haitian annexation, believing the country to unstable, but he was initially more favorable to annexing the Dominican Republic after realizing investors were highly enthusiastic towards investing in the country.{{sfn|Pletcher|1998|p=163}} Fish, however, became suspicious of annexation when Fabens, representing promoters, approached Fish and asked him to support a plan of American annexation of the Dominican Republic.{{sfn|Pletcher|1998|p=164}} Grant, who was more favorable to wealthy business leaders and investors, supported annexation.{{sfn|Pletcher|1998|p=164}} Fish, supporting Grant out of loyalty, agreed to send Babcock on a reconnaissance mission, Grant's appointed special agent to the Dominican Republic.{{sfn|Pletcher|1998|pp=164-165}} 

Babcock was accompanied by Fabens and annexation supporter California Republican Senator [[Cornelius Cole]].{{sfn|Pletcher|1998|p=164}} Cazneau, who was on the island, formerly introduced the young and ambitious Babcock to the Dominican Republic President [[Buenaventura Báez]], and the two unknown to Fish, made a draft of annexation.{{sfnm|Pletcher|1998|1p=164|White|2016|2p=508}} According to the annexation draft made in September 1869, Samaná Bay would be sold to the United States for $2 million or the country would be annexed to the United States after paying of the Dominican Republic's national debt of $1.5 million.{{sfnm|Pletcher|1998|1p=164|White|2016|2p=508}} Babcock was a supporter of Congressional [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], and he saw Santo Domingo, not as a nation of blacks, but as a source of new opportunities in a post war world.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|p=340}}  
[[image:Jacob Dolson Cox Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Grant's Secretary of Interior Cox dared to question Santo Domingo annexation]]
When Babcock returned to the White House having a treaty, Fish and Secretary of Interior [[Jacob D. Cox]] were alarmed, since Babcock had no official standing.{{sfn|Brands|2012|p=453}} Fish told Cox, "Babcock is back...I pledge you my word he had no more diplomatic authority than any other casual visitor to the island."{{sfn|Brands|2012|p=453}}{{sfnm|Pletcher|1998|1p=164|White|2p=508}} At the next cabinet meeting Babcock was there in person and Grant told his silenced cabinet that Babcock was back and that he approved of the treaty, while it only needed a signature from the U.S. consular in Santo Domingo.{{sfn|Brands|2012|pp=453-454}} Cox spoke up and said, " But Mr. President, has it been settled, then, that we ''want'' to annex Santo Domingo ?" Grant was embarrassed and began puffing on his cigar, while the other cabinet members said nothing, Cox's question remained unanswered.{{sfn|Brands|2012|p=454}} Fish threatened to resign over the matter, but Grant convinced him to stay on the administration telling Fish he would not go around him again and he needed Fish's guidance and support.{{sfn|Brands|2012|p=454}} Fish agreed to remain on the cabinet, although he hoped Grant would drop the Santo Domingo annexation treaty.{{sfn|Brands|2012|p=454}}

Grant, however, did not drop the treaty, having believed annexation would help alleviate violent suppression of [[African Americans]] in the Southern states, as blacks would have a safe environment to work and live, in the Dominican Republic.  Fish sent Babcock back to the Dominican Republic on November 18, accompanied by Quartermaster [[Rufus Ingalls]], this time having official State Department status and instructions to draw up two formal treaties, signed on November 29, 1869.{{sfnm|Pletcher|1998|1p=164|White|2016|2p=509}} Grant, however, kept the treaties secret from Congress and the public, until mid-January 1870.{{sfn|Pletcher|1998|p=164}} After earnest public discussion, the treaties was formerly submitted to Congress in March, whereupon Senators joined in the debate.{{sfn|Pletcher|1998|p=164}}  Senator [[Charles Sumner]] strongly opposed the annexation treaties objecting to Babcock's secret negotiations, his use of naval power, and desiring to keep Santo Domingo an autonomous [[African American]] nation rather than annexation and potential statehood as Grant had proposed. The people of Santo Domingo overwhelmingly desired annexation voting 15,169 to 11 in its favor, according to a plebiscite held by Báez.{{sfn|Pletcher|1998|pp=164-165}} Senate Republicans led by Sumner split the party over the treaty while Senators loyal to Grant supported the treaty and admonished Babcock. The treaties however failed to pass the Senate causing continued bitterness and hostility between Grant and Sumner, both stubbornly trying to control the Republican Party. Although Babcock was suspected of being given investment land on Samaná Bay, a Congressional investigation found no conclusive evidence that Babcock would financially gain from the country's annexation.{{sfnm|McFeely|1974|1p=138|McFeely|1981|2p=343}} Babcock in the minority report was criticized for acquiescing in the imprisonment of Davis Hatch, an American abroad, who was an open critic of Báez.{{sfn|McFeely|1974|p=138}}

====Gold corner (September 1869)====
In 1869, Babcock invested money in the [[Jay Cooke &amp; Company]]'s [[Black Friday (1869)|Gold Ring]], a scam by wealthy New York [[tycoons]] [[Jay Gould]] and [[James Fisk (financier)|James Fisk]] to profit by [[cornering the market]] on gold.{{sfn|Chernow|2017|p=647}}  Starting in late April, Secretary of the Treasury [[George S. Boutwell]] had regulated the price of gold by monthly sales from the Treasury in exchange for [[United States Note#Post Civil War|greenbacks]].{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=128}}  As part of the Gold Ring's effort, Gould convinced Grant not to increase the Treasury's September gold sale, helping make it scarce and inflating the price.{{sfnm|Chernow|2017|1p=647|Calhoun|2017|2p=134}} Gould and Fisk then set up a buying operation, the New York Gold Room, where traders in their employ purchased as much gold as they could acquire, which artificially drove up the price.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|pp=140-141}}  When Grant became aware of the full extent of the attempt to corner the market in late September 1869, he ordered the release of $4,500,000 in Treasury gold, which caused the price to collapse.{{sfn|Chernow|2017|p=647}}  Gould and Fisk were thwarted, but at the expense of a decline in the stock market and the overall economy.{{sfn|Chernow|2017|p=647}}  Babcock and other individuals who secretly invested with him lost $40,000 (about $750,000 in 2018).{{sfn|Chernow|2017|p=647}}, and to satisfy his creditors, Babcock had to sign a [[Deed of trust (real estate)|trust deed]] on his property, which named [[Asa Bird Gardiner]] as trustee.{{sfn|Knott|1876|p=421}}  The extent of Babcock's involvement was not revealed to Grant until 1876, when his complicity in the Gold Ring was uncovered during the investigation of his involvement in the Whiskey Ring.&lt;ref name=Simon_2005&gt;Simon ''The Papers of Ulysses S. Grant: January 1-October 31, 1876'' , pages 47, 48&lt;/ref&gt;

====Corruption: Whiskey Ring (1875–1876)====
{{further |Ulysses S. Grant presidential administration scandals}}
[[image:Whiskeyring.jpg|thumb |200px |left |[[Thomas Nast]] cartoon depicting the [[Whiskey Ring]], published in ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' (March, 1876)]]
Dating back to the Presidency of [[Abraham Lincoln]] it was common for distillers and corrupt Internal Revenue agents to make false whiskey production reports and pocket unpaid tax revenue.{{sfn|McFeely|1974|p=154}} However, during the early 1870s, the corruption became more organized by distillers, who used the illegally obtained money for bribery and illegal election financing, to the point where every agent in St. Louis was involved in corruption.{{sfn|McFeely|1974|p=154}} This organized network, known as the [[Whiskey Ring]], extended nationally and involved "the printing, selling, and approving of forged federal revenue stamps on bottled whiskey."&lt;ref&gt;Fredman (1987), ''The Presidential Follies''&lt;/ref&gt;  

In June 1874, President Grant appointed [[Benjamin Bristow]] as Secretary of Treasury, with authority to investigate the Whiskey Ring and prosecute wrongdoers.  Bristow, a Kentuckian and Union Army veteran, was known for his honesty and integrity, and had served as the nation's first Solicitor General, also appointed by Grant.{{sfn|White|2016|p=556}} Bristow immediately discovered whiskey tax evasion among distillers and corrupt officials in the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Bureau.{{sfn|White|2016|p=557}} Bristow and [[Bluford Wilson]], the [[Solicitor of the United States Treasury|Treasury Solicitor]] obtained Grant's permission to use secret agents appointed from outside the Treasury Department; as a result of the evidence they obtained, on May 10, 1875 Treasury Department agents raided and shut down corrupt distilleries in St. Louis, Chicago, and Milwaukee, seizing company financial records and other files.{{sfn|White|2016|p=557}} 

Bristow then prosecuted the offenders by working with Grant's newly appointed Attorney General, [[Edwards Pierrepont]], a popular New York reformer who had been involved in shutting down New York City's corrupt [[William M. Tweed|Tweed Ring]].{{sfn|White|2016|p=557}} Information was soon discovered that Babcock was informing ring leader John McDonald in St. Louis of inspections by Bristow's agents, giving them time to hide incriminating evidence before agents arrived.{{sfn|White|2016|p=562}} Bristow believed Babcock was paid off by cash, two five-hundred-dollar bills, in one instance, hidden a inside cigar box, for this information and protection.{{sfn|White|2016|p=562}} McDonald was indicted in June, when Bristow obtained indictments against 350 distillers and government officials.{{sfn|White|2016|p=562}}

 }}

In July 1875, Bristow and Pierrepont met Grant, who was vacationing at Long Branch, and gave him evidence that Babcock was a member of the ring. {{sfnm|White|2016|1p=562|McFeely|1974|2p=156}} Grant told Pierrepont "Let no guilty man escape..." and said if Babcock was guilty then it was the "greatest piece of traitorism to me that a man could possibly practice."{{sfn|White|2016|p=562}} In October, Babcock was summoned in front of Grant, Bristow, and Pierrepont at the White House to explain two ambiguously signed "Sylph" telegrams hand written by Babcock.{{sfnm|White|2016|1p=563|Brands|2012|2p=557|McFeely|1981|3p=410}} The first message said, "''I have succeeded. They will not go. I will write you.''" (December 10, 1874) and the second one said, "''We have official information that the enemy weakens. Push things.''" (February 3, 1875){{sfn|Smith|2001|p=591}} Bristow had shown these messages to Grant at a cabinet meeting the same day.{{sfn|White|2016|p=563}} Babcock said something to Grant, unintelligible to Bristow and Pierrepont, and Grant appeared satisfied by Babcock's interpretation of the telegrams.{{sfnm|White|2016|1p=563|McFeely|1981|2p=410}} 

Pierrepont and Bristow, believing the matter to be crucial, insisted Babcock send a message to his telegraphic correspondent demanding that this individual come to Washington to give his version of the messages.{{sfnm|Brands|2012|1p=557|McFeely|1981|2p=411}} After Babcock seemed to be taking too long, Pierrepont went to check on him and found Babcock writing a warning to revenue agent John A. Joyce, his St. Louis confederate, to be on his guard.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|p=411}} Infuriated, Pierrepont grabbed Babcock's pen and dashed through his message yelling "You don't want to send your argument; send the fact, and go there and make your explanation. ''I'' don't understand this."{{sfnm|Brands|2012|1p=557|McFeely|1981|2p=411}} Grant, on the other hand, was divided between the loyalty he had for Babcock, and his desire for Bristow and Pierrepont, trustworthy members of his cabinet, to prosecute the Whiskey Ring.{{sfn|White|2016|p=562}} Since Babcock had no acceptable explanation for his messages, he was soon indicted November 4, 1875 for tax fraud.{{sfn|Brands|2012|p=557}}

As a military officer, on December 2, 1875 Babcock requested of Grant a military court martial, believing that an army tribunal would be favorable to his defense.{{sfn|McFeely|1974|p=157}} On December 8, 1875, U.S. Attorney [[David Patterson Dyer|David Dyer]] followed Bristow's instructions to deny Babcock a court martial, setting his St. Louis jury trial for February, 1876.{{sfn|White|2016|p=563}} When Babcock's trial in St. Louis came up in February, Grant decided to testify in Babcock's defense.{{sfn|White|2016|p=564}} By this time, Grant said his critics were using Babcock to go after his own presidency.{{sfn|White|2016|p=563}} After cabinet members objected to Grant testifying in St. Louis as unseemly for a President, it was settled that Grant would give a deposition at the White House.{{sfn|White|2016|p=564}}

=====St. Louis Trial (February 1876)=====
[[file:William Tecumseh Sherman.jpg|thumb|right|150px|General '''William T. Sherman''' testified at Babcock's trial.]]

On February 8, 1876 Babcock was put on trial, an event that lasted eighteen days.{{sfn|O'neil|2017}} Babcock's defense team was noted for its legal prowess, and included Grant's former Attorney General [[George Henry Williams|George Williams]], a top criminal defense lawyer, Emory Storrs, and a former appeals judge (New York), [[John K. Porter]].{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=522}} It took place at the U.S. Post Office and Custom House located at 218 North Third Street, and the status of the defendant made the trial a popular and well-attended spectacle.{{sfn|O'neil|2017}} Demand to attend the courtroom proceedings was so great that only persons with signed passes and Whiskey Ring defendants were allowed in.{{sfn|O'neil|2017}}  Babcock arrived in civilian clothes, including sky-blue pants, a silk hat, and a light jacket.{{sfn|O'neil|2017}} When court wasn't in session, Babcock stayed at the newly rebuilt [[Lindell Hotel]] on Sixth Street and Washington Avenue.{{sfn|O'neil|2017}} 

Grant's White House deposition took place on February 12; it was notarized by Chief Justice [[Morrison Waite]] and witnessed by both Bristow and Pierrepont.{{sfn|White|2016|p=564}} At the deposition Grant fully supported the Whiskey Ring prosecutions, but he willfully refused to testify against Babcock, despite having been informed by Bristow of Babcock's duplicity, saying he had "great confidence" in Babcock's integrity, and that his confidence in Babcock was "unshaken".{{sfnm|White|2016|1p=564|Chernow|2010|2p=806}} Grant's unprecedented testimony would prove to be devastating to for the Whiskey Ring prosecution team against Babcock.

On February 17, Babcock's defense read President Grant's powerful deposition that supported Babcock to the jury, and severely weakened any chance of Babcock being convicted.{{sfn|O'neil|2017}} The same day, General [[William T. Sherman]], testified at the trial, that Babcock's "character has been very good."{{sfn|O'neil|2017}}  Grant's deposition, Sherman's in-person tesitmony, and Babcock's shrewed defense counsel led to his acquittal by the St. Louis jury.{{sfn|White|2016|p=564}}  A rumor spread that Pierrepont had leaked information to Babcock that aided in his acquittal, but Pierrepont denied this and suggested that Babcock himself had started the rumor.&lt;ref name="reeves8081"&gt;{{cite book | last = Reeves | first = Thomas C. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Gentleman Boss | publisher = Alfred A.

====Return to Washington D.C.====
When Babcock returned to Washington, he went back to his White House office, as if there had been no trial. Grant's Secretary of State, [[Hamilton Fish]], was furious, and pressured Grant to force Babcock to leave, saying that Grant merely had to dismiss Babcock, because as a military officer Babcock was subject to orders and had no recourse.  Additionally Treasury Solicitor Wilson informed Grant that Babcock had been involved with the 1869 plot to [[Black Friday (1869)|corner the gold market]].{{sfn|Brands|2012|p=560}} Grant finally dismissed Babcock from the White House and appointed his son Ulysses Jr. in Babcock's place.{{sfn|White|2016|p=564}} It was later discovered that Babcock used his Whiskey Ring kickbacks to purchase from [[Henry Shelton Sanford]] on Christmas Day, 1874 a home and over 50 acres of grove land near what became the city of [[Sanford, Florida]].&lt;ref name="Robison"&gt;Robison (Jan 6, 2002), ''[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2002-01-06/news/0201040436_1_babcock-whiskey-ring-sanford Deeds, Letter Prove General's Ties to Sanford]'', Accessed on February 9, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Superintendent of public buildings and grounds (1869–1877)===
In addition to being Grant's private secretary Grant had appointed Babcock as the District of Columbia's Superintendent of Public Buildings and Grounds.{{sfn|BDOA_1906}}  He was involved in the beautification of the city and improvements to its infrastructure, but was also tied to allegations of corruption.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=527}} The city's territorial governor, [[Alexander Robey Shepherd]], a Grant appointee, operated aggressively and Babcock and Shepherd were accused of personally profiting from construction projects within the city limits.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=527}} Babcock's supervision included construction of the [[Chain Bridge (Potomac River)|Chain Bridge]] over the [[Potomac River]] and the [[Anacostia Railroad Bridge]].{{sfn|BDOA_1906}} He also supervised the construction of the east wing of the new [[Eisenhower Executive Office Building|State, War and Navy Building]].{{sfn|BDOA_1906}} Babcock retained the Superintendent's position after he was dismissed from the White House in 1876, and served until March 3, 1877, when the Grant administration ended.

====Safe burglary conspiracy (1876)====
On April 15, 1876, Babcock was indicted for involvement in the [[Ulysses S. Grant presidential administration scandals#Safe burglary conspiracy|Safe Burglary Conspiracy]].{{sfn|Coffey 2014|page=282}}{{sfn|McFeely|1974|pp=143-144}} In 1874, Richard Harrington, an Assistant [[United States Attorney]] for [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia|Washington, DC]] attempted to [[Frameup|frame]] Columbus Alexander, leader of the Memorialists, an organization critical of Shepherd's management of the city.{{sfn|Coffey 2014|page=282}}{{sfn|McFeely|1974|pp=139, 141-142}} Harrington hired dishonest [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents to break into the U.S. Attorney's safe, using explosives to make it obvious that a burglary had occurred.{{sfn|Coffey 2014|page=282}} To entrap Alexander, the conspirators took materials that were supposedly stolen from the safe to his home at night, intending to give them to him and then later arrest him for their possession.{{sfn|Coffey 2014|page=282}}{{sfn|McFeely|pp=141-142}}  Alexander thwarted this effort by refusing to answer the door.{{sfn|Coffey 2014|page=282}}{{sfn|McFeely|pp=141-142}}  At that point, the Secret Service agents arrested two other conspirators who pretended to be the supposed burglars, and had them sign false affidavits implicating Alexander in the burglary.{{sfn|Coffey 2014|page=282}}  The conspiracy collapsed when the Secret Service agents admitted at Alexander's trial that the charges were false, and Alexander was acquitted.{{sfn|Coffey 2014|page=282}}  The conspiracy was supposed to have included Babcock, who was said to have wanted to silence Alexander, a prominent Grant administration critic.{{sfn|Coffey 2014|page=282}} Babcock was allegedly the broker between Harrington and the Secret Service,{{sfn|McFeely|1974|pp=143-144}} but was exonerated of direct involvement, however his continued ties to scandal and corruption increased public pressure on Grant to remove him from the White House.{{sfn|Coffey 2014|page=276}}

==Inspector of lighthouses (1877–1884)==
On February 27, 1877 Grant appointed Babcock Inspector of Lighthouses of the Fifth District, a low-profile position that enabled Babcock to earn a living by making use of his engineering skills without drawing undue public attention to himself.{{sfn|BDOA_1906}}{{sfn|Government Printing Office 1898|p=224}} Babcock continued to serve under Grant and his successors [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], [[James A. Garfield]], and [[Chester A. Arthur]].

==Presidential election (1880)==
{{further|1880 Republican National Convention|Ulysses S. Grant}}

In September 1879, Grant returned from his famous world tour.  His popularity was as great as ever and Stalwart Republicans proposed to nominate him for a third term as president. Democrats sought to discredit his previous administration, including his cabinet and political appointees. On February 4, 1880, a color illustration by artist [[Joseph Keppler]] appeared in ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'' magazine, in which Keppler ridiculed Grant and his associates, including Babcock, for past involvement in corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Alexander Kahn, Richard Samuel West (October 2014), [https://books.google.com/books?id=5SfFBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=Puck+(February+4,+1880)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=c199ZrNBhr&amp;sig=NozHB28t6t5cjuBN5dgw8KT832U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwizjcGHjLfJAhWImYgKHYCqB4QQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false What Fools These Mortals Be!], p 49 --- Illustration by Joseph Keppler (February 4, 1880),''Puck'', v. 6, No. 152, pp. 782-783&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 14, 1880, Connecticut Senator [[William W. Eaton]], a Democrat read a memorial from Davis Hatch, who had been arrested in Santo Domingo in 1868 and was requesting reimbursement for the financial losses he said resulted from his imprisonment.{{sfn|New York Times (May 15, 1880)}}  According to Hatch, he was imprisoned on false charges and was going to be released, but Babcock, who visited the island nation in 1869 to secure an annexation treaty, interfered with Hatch's release from prison and was directly complicit in Hatch being falsely sentenced to a five month prison term.{{sfn|New York Times (May 15, 1880)}} Republican Senator [[Roscoe Conkling]] defended Babcock, saying that the Senate investigating committee's majority report fully exonerated him and that Eaton raised the issue only to try giving Democrats an advantage in an election year.{{sfn|New York Times (May 15, 1880)}}

In June 1880, the Republicans held their national convention in Chicago. Grant was nominated by Conkling, his main Stalwart supporter. Republicans deadlocked between Grant and the other frontrunners, [[James G. Blaine]] and [[John Sherman]], and selected the [[dark horse]] Garfield as their presidential candidate. Arthur was selected for the vice presidential nomination, and Garfield went on to win the general election, defeating Democratic nominee [[Winfield S. Hancock]].

The [[Ponce de Leon Inlet Light|Mosquito Inlet Lighthouse]] project started in 1883, and Babcock was the supervising engineer.&lt;ref name="Mike Pesca"/&gt;{{sfn|Garmon_2009}}  On June 2, 1884, Babcock and his associates were on duty were aboard the government schooner ''Pharos'' to deliver construction supplies, and were anxious to get to land because a [[subtropical storms|sudden storm]] created hazardous ocean conditions.{{sfn|Garmon_2009}}&lt;ref name="Mike Pesca"&gt;{{cite web| title=Orville Babcock's Indictment and the CIA Leak Case|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4986394|author=Mike Pesca|date=November 2, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Government Printing Office 1898|p=224}}  The captain decided not to cross over the [[shoal|inlet bar]] during the storm because the construction supplies weighed down the ship, and he feared [[ship grounding|grounding]] it.  As the storm worsened, Captain Newins of the nearby ''Bonito'' led seven men in a rowboat to the ''Pharos'' in order to retrieve the passengers.{{sfn|Garmon_2009}} In debating whether to wait out the storm on the ''Pharos'' or try to make land, Babcock told his associates that since Newins and his crew had rowed safely to the ''Pharos'', then they should be able to row to shore on tidal floods created by the storm.{{sfn|Garmon_2009}} After eating their lunch on the ''Pharos'', Babcock and his associates boarded a rowboat and started for the shore. As they approached the inlet bar, [[Swell (ocean)|swells]] capsized the boat several times, and it took on water. Babcock was thrown clear, but another person on the boat attached him to it by a lifeline.{{sfn|Garmon_2009}} The boat and crew were battered by waves, oars, and other debris, and Babcock's lifeline was torn loose from the boat, which resulted in his drowning death. Upon reaching the shore, others who had been in the boat recovered Babcock's body and unsuccessfully tried to [[resuscitate]] him. Three others, including two of Babcock's associates, were also killed; the bodies of Babcock's associates, Levi P. Luckey and Benjamin F. Sutter, were recovered several days later, but the body of the fourth victim, a member of the boat's crew, was not found.{{sfn|Garmon_2009}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=June 27, 1884 |title=The Mosquito Inlet Disaster: Captain Anderson's Account of the Drowning of Gen. Babcock and Mr. Luckey |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/87230746/ |newspaper=Washington Evening Star |location=Washington, DC |page=4 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lighthouse construction project continued after Babcock's death, and was completed in 1887.

==Historical reputation==
Scholars note Babcock's high class standing at West Point, engineering skills, and bravery during the American Civil War.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=78}} Babcock also has been noted positively for his association with the antislavery views of the [[Radical Republicans]], and for his dealings with [[African Americans]] from a position of equality, a trait which was uncommon for the white people of his era, even those who opposed slavery.  Historians also make positive mention of Babcock's post-White House career, noting that he served for eight years as a government lighthouse inspector and engineer, and did so capably and honestly.

However, historians are critical of Babcock's political power as Grant's White House military aide, shielded by Grant, and not subject to resignation.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|pp=78, 527}} Historians are also highly suspicious of Babcock's unauthorized Santo Domingo annexation pre-agreement.  His reputation was also marred by his involvement in the Gold Ring, the Whiskey Ring, and the Safe Burglary Conspiracy. Most historians agree that Babcock betrayed Grant while President, and remain perplexed at Grant's loyalty to his wartime comrade, including Grant's unprecedented White House deposition on Babcock's behalf. In defending Babcock, Grant was not fully candid with the truth in his own testimony, probably to protect his family and his presidency from further scandal.  With Babcock's reputation largely narrowed to observations about his corruption, loyalty to Grant, and wartime bravery, historians are generally not able to consider him in a wider context because he did not author an autobiography, nor has he been the subject of an extended biography. Historian [[William McFeely]] criticized Babcock for ignoring ethical values in the spirit of opportunism and personal gain.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|p=340}}

On November 22, 2016, [[Mississippi State University Libraries]] announced the digitalization of Babcock's private diaries.{{sfn|MSU Libraries digitize Civil War diaries and letters}} Babcock's diaries are part of Mississippi State University Libraries' Ulysses S. Grant Digital Collection.{{sfn|MSU Libraries digitize Civil War diaries and letters}} Babcock's diaries began in 1863 during the height of the [[American Civil War]], including his perspective on the [[Vicksburg campaign|siege of Vicksburg]] and his wartime experiences in Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, and Virginia.{{sfn|MSU Libraries digitize Civil War diaries and letters}} The diary collections also includes his famous post-war visit to Santo Domingo in 1869 serving as President Grant's special agent and personal secretary.{{sfn|MSU Libraries digitize Civil War diaries and letters}} The collection includes Babcock's  supplementary materials of speeches, correspondence, and newspaper clippings.{{sfn|MSU Libraries digitize Civil War diaries and letters}} The Mississippi State University Libraries said that Babcock's brokerage of the annexation of Santo Domingo, "began what became a string of controversies and scandals surrounding Babcock and his position as aide to the President."{{sfn|Orville Babcock Diaries}} The scandals culminated in Babcock's involvement in the Whiskey Ring, indictment for tax fraud in 1875, and corruption trial in St. Louis in 1876.{{sfn|Orville Babcock Diaries}} Throughout these scandals President Grant gave Babcock his confidence.{{sfn|Orville Babcock Diaries}}

According to presidential historian [[Charles W. Calhoun]], Babcock emerged as Grant's "political [[majordomo]], if not his jackel."{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=78}} Grant's Secretary of State [[Hamilton Fish]] said Babcock "has brains &amp; very many excellent &amp; gentlemanly qualities but is spoiled by his position &amp; a want of delicacy &amp; consideration for the official responsibilities &amp; proper authority (official) of civilians."{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=78}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2892">'''Pauline Léon''' (28 September 1768 – 5 October 1838), was a radical organizer and [[Feminism|feminist]] during the [[French Revolution]].

==Biography==
Léon was born to chocolate makers Pierre-Paul Léon and Mathrine Telohan in [[Paris]] on 28 September 1768.  Léon was one of six children.  Her father died in 1784, after which time Léon helped her mother with the chocolate business in exchange for room and board.  She was also responsible for helping to raise and support her siblings.  It is believed that she became a political radical after witnessing the execution of leaders of a bread riot.

On 6 March 1792 she addressed the Legislative Assembly on behalf of Parisian women, suggesting that a female militia be formed so that women could protect their homes from counter-revolutionary assaults. In July 1791 she signed the petition at the [[Champ de Mars, Paris|Champ de Mars]]. Léon was a founder of the [[Society of Revolutionary Republican Women]] (''Société des Républicaines-Révolutionnaires'') along with [[Claire Lacombe]] and became its president on 9 July 1793. Léon and Lacombe both held strong hatred towards [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]], mostly due to his wartime opinions and actions. The ''Société'' only lasted for about a year before authorities shut it down. She was also a leader of the Femmes Sans-Culottes in 1793. She also was a frequenter of the [[Cordeliers]] Club.  At age 29, she married [[Jean Théophile Victor Leclerc|Théophile Leclerc]], the leader of the ''[[Enragés]].''  They were later arrested together, but held separately in the Luxembourg prison from April to August, 1794.

Little is known about Léon's later life.  She died at home in Bourbon-Vendée on 5 October 1838.

'''Paull Shin''' (Shin Hobom, [[Korean language|Korean]]: 신호범; born September 27, 1935) was a member of the [[Washington State Legislature|Washington State Senate]], the first [[Korean Americans|Korean American]] ever elected to the Washington State Legislature.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xjF2AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Shin,+Paull%22+1935&amp;dq=%22Shin,+Paull%22+1935&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=psunUeCOI4HwiwLQtoDIDQ&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA]&lt;/ref&gt; Shin is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], elected from the [[Washington's 21st legislative district|21st Legislative District]], in southwest [[Snohomish County, Washington|Snohomish County]]. Cities within the district include [[Mukilteo, Washington|Mukilteo]] and portions of [[Everett, Washington|Everett]], [[Edmonds, Washington|Edmonds]], and [[Lynnwood, Washington|Lynnwood]]. Senator Shin currently served on the Senate Agriculture, Water &amp; Rural Economic Development and Trade &amp; Economic Development Committees.

Shin was born in [[Korea]] in 1935. Orphaned at the age of four, he lived on the streets of [[Seoul]] begging for food until the outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in 1950, at which point he became a houseboy to a group of [[U.S. Army]] officers. In 1954, one of them, a dentist named Ray Paull, adopted Shin and took him home to [[Salt Lake City, Utah]]. Despite never having been educated in Korea, and knowing little English, Shin completed a [[GED]] in 18 months. Shin went on to earn a BA in political science from [[Brigham Young University]], an MPIA from the [[University of Pittsburgh]], and an MA and PhD from the [[University of Washington]].

After being elected to the Washington State House of Representatives in 1992, Shin ran for the [[United States House of Representatives]] in Washington's 2nd district in 1994 and for Washington lieutenant governor in 1996, losing by a thin margin in each race. He was elected to the Washington State Senate in 1998.

On January 7, 2014, Shin resigned from the Washington State Senate effective immediately following his diagnosis with [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldnet.com/article/20140107/NEWS01/701079815/State-Sen.-Paull-Shin-resigns-citing-Alzheimer%26%23146s State Sen. Paull Shin resigns, citing Alzheimer’s]&lt;/ref&gt;

He and his wife Donna have two children and five grandsons.

'''Rebecca Cohen Henriquez''' (9 July 1864 – 23 May 1935) was a [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi Jewish]] woman from the Colonial Dutch island of
[[Curaçao]]. Based upon the custom of her community, she was unable to work and instead devoted her time to charitable activities. In 1895, she founded the first woman's club, known as Entre Nous, in the country. Besides hosting literary events, the club was responsible for the construction of the Queen Wilhelmina Park in [[Willemstad]]. She was invested as a Knight of the [[Order of the Liberator]] by Venezuela n 1902 and was invested as a Knight of the [[Order of Orange-Nassau]] in 1932.

==Early life==
Rebecca Cohen Henriquez was born on 9 July 1864 in [[Willemstad]] in the [[Curaçao and Dependencies|Colony of Curaçao and Dependencies]] of the [[Dutch Empire]] to Esther (née Henriquez) and Salomón Cohen Henriquez.{{sfn|Rutgers|2017}}{{sfn|Goldish|2002|p=15}} Her family, including her paternal grandparents, Esther (née Monsanto) and Daniel Cohen Henriquez, were part of the prosperous [[History of the Jews in Curaçao|Sephardi Jewish community]],{{sfn|Goldish|2002|p=15}} which had roots in the Iberian peninsula, but had immigrated to Curaçao from Amsterdam in 1681. Her father was the Advocate General of the colony and Cohen Henriquez was his youngest child of six siblings.{{sfn|Rutgers|2017}}

Until the 1870s, education or employment for women were unacceptable under the societal norms of the times, but in the last quarter of the decade, educational facilities began offering schooling for girls.{{sfn|Goldish|2002|p=19}} Cohen Henriquez began her schooling at the Colegio Smith and then transferred to the private girls' school, Colegio Colonial,{{sfn|Rutgers|2017}} which was operated by José R. Henriquez and his wife.{{sfn|Goldish|2002|p=19}} The school, in which classes were taught in Spanish, offered courses in astronomy, etiquette, geography, languages (Dutch, English and French), math, religion, reading, and writing.{{sfn|Rutgers|2017}}{{sfn|Goldish|2002|p=19}} She supplemented her education with lessons from her father in philosophy and Dutch literature.{{sfn|Rutgers|2017}}

==Activism==
As working was unacceptable for women of her class, when Cohen Henriquez finished her schooling, she participated in charitable works, providing food and financial support to the poor. She occupied her time with painting and embroidery creating goods which could be sold at bazaars she organized to raise money to provide assistance to others.{{sfn|Rutgers|2017}} Among the many activities for social welfare she engaged in was disaster and hurricane relief.{{sfn|''Het Vaderland''|1935|p=3}}

In 1883{{sfn|Goldish|2002|p=19}} (or 1895){{sfn|Rutgers|2017}} Cohen Henriquez organized fourteen alumni of Colegio Colonial, including herself and Rebecca Alvares Correa; Angela Baiz; Lelia, Leonor and Raquel Capriles; Elmire Cohen Henriquez,; Anna Gravenhorst; Henriette de Leao Laguna; Habita Mendes Chumaceiro; Rosabelle and Sarah Penso; Julieta Pinedo; and Nettie van Lier into the Entre Nous Club,{{sfn|Goldish|2002|p=20}} the first women's organization in Curaçao. Cohen Henriquez served as president of the organization from its founding until her death.{{sfn|Rutgers|2017}} All of the women except Anna Gravenhorst, who was Protestant, were from the Jewish community.{{sfn|Goldish|2002|p=20}} Besides their social improvement projects, the ladies of the club hosted cultural events featuring literary and music recitals.{{sfn|Rutgers|2017}} In 1902, she was granted permission from the Dutch crown to accept a knighthood in the 4th degree to the [[Order of the Liberator]] from [[Venezuela]].{{sfn|''Nieuwe Tilburgsche Courant''|1902|p=1}}

The women of the club, conceived, planned, and funded the creation of the Queen Wilhelmina Park of Willemstad. An unusual undertaking, the women proved that they were able to manage and complete the project on their own initiative. Using proceeds from their programs, in which the club members and their friends performed, Entres Nous raised sufficient funds by 1899 to begin construction in the central downtown area, known as Punda, of a park to create recreational space for the residents.{{sfn|Goldish|2002|p=20}} The plan was completed and officially opened in 1901, the first and only public park in the city and quickly became a social and cultural meeting center.{{sfn|Rutgers|2017}} Through the years, the club continued adding amenities, like benches, which were installed in 1907.{{sfn|''Amigoe di Curaçao''|1907|p=4}}

In 1930, Cohen Henriquez and the club decided to revitalize the park in honor of the fiftieth birthday of [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]].{{sfn|Rutgers|2017}} Through Cohen Henriquez's dedication to the cause, they raised ƒ15,000 (fifteen thousand Antillean guilders) to commission a statue from the [[Florence|Florentine]] sculptor Pietro Ceccarelli.{{sfn|Rutgers|2017}} Cohen Henriquez was invested as a knight of the [[Order of Orange-Nassau]] in 1932,{{sfn|''Amigoe di Curaçao''|1932|p=4}} becoming the first women to ever receive the Order of Orange-Nassau in Curaçao.{{sfn|Rutgers|2017}} The statue was created in Italy and shipped to Curaçao arriving on 29 December 1932. The statue, made of [[Carrara marble]] stood two and a half meters above the 3.5 meter pedestal{{sfn|''De Tijd''|1933|p=8}} and was unveiled during a ceremony held on 19 January 1933.{{sfn|Rutgers|2017}}

==Death and legacy==
Cohen Henriquez died on 23 May 1935 in Willemstad.{{sfn|''Het Vaderland''|1935|p=3}} A marble plaque was erected in Queen Wilhelmina Park to memorialize her contributions to the creation of the park and her community service.{{sfn|Goldish|2002|p=20}}

'''Robert C. Seacord''' (born June 5, 1963) is an American [[computer security]] specialist and [[writer]].  He is the author of books on [[computer security]], [[legacy system]] modernization, and [[component-based]] software engineering.

== Education ==
Seacord earned a [[Bachelor's degree]] in [[computer science]] from [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] in December 1983. He has also completed graduate-level courses at [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie-Mellon University]] in software design, creation and maintenance; user interfaces; software project management; formal methods; human factors; operating systems; and entrepreneurship.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

== Career ==
Seacord began programming professionally for [[IBM]] in 1984, working in processor development, then communications and operating system software, and software engineering. He led the Secure Coding Initiative in the  CERT Division’s [[Software Engineering Institute]] (SEI) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania until 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.us-cert.gov/bsi/about-us/authors/robert-c-seacord|title=Robert C. Seacord {{!}} US-CERT|website=www.us-cert.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also has worked at the [[X Consortium]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he developed and maintained code for the Common Desktop Environment and the X Window System. He returned to SEI in 1996, working on component-based software engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1315064|title=Robert Seacord on the CERT C Secure Coding Standard|last=Chisnall|first=David|last2=Seacord|first2=Robert C.|date=2008-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seacord joined [[NCC Group]] in 2015&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/about-us/newsroom-and-events/press-releases/2015/november/renowned-secure-coding-expert-and-author-joins-ncc-groups-us-team/|title=Renowned secure coding expert and author joins NCC Group’s US team|last=|first=|date=4 November 2015|website=www.nccgroup.trust|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently a Technical Director. Seacord was an [[adjunct professor]] in the [[Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science]] and in the [[Information Networking Institute]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He was also a part-time faculty member at the [[University of Pittsburgh]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}. In early 2018, Seacord tweeted that "As a Carnegie Mellon professor, I didn’t spend a lot of time catering to struggling students. I think this diverts resources from those who are going to succeed and make a difference." The tweet was quickly deleted but was later reported about in [[The Tartan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thetartan.org/2018/2/5/news/tweets|title=CMU students and professors react to controversial tweet|last=Green|first=Lydia|date=February 5, 2018|work=The Tartan|access-date=7 February 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seacord is on the Advisory Board for the [[Linux Foundation]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/advisory-board/|title=Advisory Board}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a technical expert for the ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG14 international standardization working group for the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/asset_files/certresearchreport/2009_013_001_54244.pdf#page=74|title=CERT Research Annual Report|date=2009|website=|page=76|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a veteran of the [[Battle of San Jacinto]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tamu.edu/ccbn/dewitt/kleberg.htm Texas A&amp;M University on Kleberg Family]&lt;/ref&gt; and the brother of [[Louis Kleberg]].  He arrived in Texas in 1836 with his wife Philippine Sophie Rosalie "Rosa" von Roeder, who was a child of the at one-time aristocratic von Roeder family, which was allied with the wealthy and aristocratic Sack family of Nordrhein Westphalia.   Robert and Rosa had eleven children, seven of whom lived to adulthood; Clara, Johanna, Caroline, Rudolph, Marcellus, and Robert, Jr.
 
He is the namesake of [[Kleberg County, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hck10&lt;/ref&gt;  His sons also achieved success.  Rudolph Kleberg (1847-1924) became a United States congressman, Marcellus Kleberg (1849-1913) studied law and served as city attorney for Galveston, Texas, and the youngest Kleberg son, Robert Justus Kleberg, Jr. (1853-1932) managed the King Ranch and later married Alice Gertrudis King, the youngest daughter of cattle baron, Captain [[Richard King (Texas)|Richard King]].

'''Rufino Jiao Santos''' (August 26, 1908 - September 3, 1973) was the 29th [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila|Archbishop of Manila]] from February 10, 1953 until his death on September 3, 1973, and was the first [[Philippines|Filipino]] elevated to the rank of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Barangay]] Sto. Niño, [[Guagua, Pampanga]], Santos was the fourth of seven children of Gaudencio Santos, an overseer of farmland near [[Mount Arayat]], and Rosalia Jiao. Rufino's three elder brothers were Manuel, Emiliano, and Quirino; his three sisters were Clara, Jovita, and Exequiela. Santos, nicknamed "Pinong", grew up in a house located 30 meters from what is now the Immaculate Conception Parish. He was active in church activities as an [[acolyte]], and was later a choir member of the Manila Cathedral School. Two factors influenced his priestly vocation: his stint as an altar server, and the encouragement of Father Jose Tahon, [[Manila Cathedral]]'s parish priest.

He entered [[San Carlos Seminary]] on July 25, 1921, and earned a Baccalaureate in [[Canon Law]] in 1929 and a Doctorate in Sacred [[Theology]] in July 1931 at [[Pontificia Universita Gregoriana]]. In 1927, the 19-year-old Santos and Leopoldo A. Arcaira, 24&amp;mdash;both outstanding students of San Carlos Seminary&amp;mdash;were the first recipients of the scholarships at the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] in [[Rome]], Italy.

Pinong was granted a [[Papal dispensation]] to be ordained below the canonical age of 24. On Oct. 25, 1931, two months shy of his 23rd birthday, Rufino J. Santos was ordained priest at the [[Basilica of Saint John Lateran]] in [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pia.gov.ph/?m=12&amp;r=&amp;y=&amp;mo=&amp;fi=p080827.htm&amp;no=06  pia.gov.ph, PGMA unveils commemorative statue of Cardinal Santos in Pampanga]&lt;/ref&gt; He then served as assistant parish priest in [[Imus, Cavite]] and as a parish priest in [[Marilao]], Bulacan.

His later successor as Archbishop, Cardinal [[Gaudencio Rosales]], said during the [[Second World War]],

{{cquote|"Santos saved the life of Manila Archbishop [[Michael J. O'Doherty|Michael O'Doherty]] by admitting to the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Army]] that it was he, as a secretary of the archbishop, who donated food to the poor, including Filipino guerrillas. Refusing to collaborate with the Japanese Army, Santos was sentenced to death but was plucked out by the Combined American and Filipino liberation forces on the night of his execution."}}

===Archbishop of Manila===
In 1953, Santos was appointed [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila|Archbishop of Manila]] on February 10 and was installed on March 25 on the same year. [[Pope John XXIII]] made him a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] on 28 March 1960. He was the first native Filipino to become a cardinal. Santos paved the way for the founding of Catholic Charities (eventually known as [[Caritas Manila]]) and the reconstruction of St. Paul Hospital (now the Cardinal Santos Medical Center), which was established by the [[Maryknoll Sisters]], and damaged by American bombardment during the [[Second World War]]. Santos also re-instituted the Philippine Trust Company and the Catholic Travel Office.

During his years in Manila, he rebuilt the [[Manila Cathedral]], which had been destroyed by Allied bombardment during the 1945 [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Liberation of Manila]]. It was dedicated on December 10, 1958. He hosted the visit of [[Pope Paul VI]] to the Philippines to attend the Asian Bishops’ Meeting. Santos served as the [[Archbishop of Manila]] from 1953 to 1973.

Santos established the Church-run [[Radio Veritas]] and built important structures including the Our Lady of Guadalupe Minor Seminary along [[EDSA (road)|EDSA]] in Makati City; the Pius XII Catholic Center in [[Paco, Manila]]; and Villa San Miguel, the Archbishop's palace in Mandaluyong.&lt;ref name="gmanews.tv"&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/115604/Pampanga-venue-of-1st-Filipino-cardinals-centennial gmanews.tv, Pampanga venue of 1st Filipino cardinal's centennial]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunstar.com.ph/blogs/citizenwatch/?p=1279 sunstar.com.ph, Rosales, Arroyo guests at Cardinal Santos centennial]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardinal Rosales said that Santos was a [[diabetes|diabetic]] and that he suffered from a malignant [[brain tumor]].&lt;ref name="newsinfo.inquirer.net"&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/regions/view/20080826-156987/Arroyo-joins-Pampanga-rites-for-1st-Filipino-cardinal  newsinfo.inquirer.net, Arroyo joins Pampanga rites for 1st Filipino cardinal]&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Manila on 3 September 1973, 8 days after his 65th birthday. Following his death, a diplomatic report from the United States Embassy in Manila assessed his activities:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Santos' opposition to "Social Action" programs, which he frequently expressed in heavy-handed fashion, did much to perpetuate the Church's image as a conservative organization, allied with the country's economic and social elite.&lt;ref&gt;[https://aad.archives.gov/aad/createpdf?rid=64370&amp;dt=2472&amp;dl=1345 William Healy Sullivan (US Ambassador to the Philippines) to the Sec. of State, September 4, 1973]&lt;/ref&gt;

Caritas Manila’s history began with a Cardinal that "walked the talk".

Cardinal Santos, the first Filipino Cardinal, became the 29th Archbishop of Manila in a post-war scenario that saw a nation plagued with the following: a high dependency on the upper class in the  country's social, economic and political growth; a growing inequality in the distribution of wealth; a critical unfairness in labor, land and tenancy—all catalysts to the resurgence of the communist movement. It was to this disparate social order that Cardinal Santos spoke upon his installation:

{{cquote|I have thought of organizing a social welfare for uplifting the spirit and soul of these unfortunate members of our community. The Archdiocese will lead in this undertaking with an initial amount of fifty to one hundred thousand pesos. Then I expect the more fortunate of the faithful in the Archdiocese to contribute their help in the amount of 1 [[Philippine peso|peso]] a month for the same purpose, in order that we may budget some two hundred to two hundred fifty thousand pesos a year for buying food, clothing and medicines for distribution among our poor brethren, and the education of their children.}}

This plan took shape soon after when the Cardinal appointed an eleven-man Administrative Board on October 1, 1953. And so a new era had dawned when the establishment of Caritas Manila (first known as Catholic Charities) brought structure and organization to the way the Church’s charitable works in the Archdiocese of Manila were being implemented.

The initial years were largely a period of identifying those who needed help the most, prioritizing and allocating medical aid, food and clothing when needed.  These were superseded by programs that harnessed talents and opened up work opportunities for Manila's teeming masses, such as the educational assistance program and job placement program. Nonetheless, it was medical assistance, crisis intervention and emergency relief that had the greatest impact, reaching thousands of the sick and indigent. Cardinal Santos was "reviled" for his "conservatism on social issues and business acumen" [http://news.inq7.net/opinion/index.php?index=38story_id=41100&amp;col=848published_site=25]. However, it was his vision and altruism that had made Caritas Manila a success and his most noteworthy accomplishment.

===Birth centennial===
The [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines|CBCP]] announced that Cardinal [[Gaudencio Rosales]] would lead the August 26, 2008 centennial rites for Santos at his hometown of Sto. Nino, [[Guagua, Pampanga|Guagua]], Immaculate Conception Parish Church. [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] was to lead the event by unveiling a historical marker and a 6-foot statue of Santos (sculpted by Edillardo Paras) and donated by [[Cesar L. Villanueva]]'s wife, Arlyn Sicangco-Villanueva, president of [[Holy Angel University]] in [[Angeles City, Pampanga]]. The rites also included the exhibit of Cardinal Santos [[memorabilia]], loaned by the Archdiocese of Manila and the Kapampangan Museum at Clark.&lt;ref name="gmanews.tv"/&gt; The bronze statue will sit atop a 7-foot concrete pedestal outside the Rufino J. Cardinal Santos Convention Hall adjacent to the parish church. Villanueva also presented to the President, a copy of the book “Padre Pinong, the First Filipino Cardinal” authored by Francis Musni.&lt;ref name="newsinfo.inquirer.net"/&gt;

On September 3, 2018, his 110th birth anniversary, to commemorate the legacy of Cardinal Santos, and for the preparation for the 60th anniversary of the renovation of the post-war [[Manila Cathedral]], a mass and the cremonial tradition of raising of the galero was officiated by the present Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal [[Luis Antonio Tagle]].

'''Samuel Ben-Or Avital''' is a professionally trained [[mime artist]], teacher of mime, kinesthetic awareness, and [[Kabbalah]]. Born In Morocco, Avital later traveled to Paris where he studied with the French masters of mime, [[Etienne Decroux]], [[Jean-Louis Barrault]], and [[Marcel Marceau]]. Avital has performed in New York with the Pantomime Theater of New York, off-Broadway, and has toured North and South America. At the present Avital teaches [[Kabbalah]] in Colorado in the United States although he is best known as a mime.

==History==
Samuel Avital was born Shmuel Abitbol in 1932,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Avital |first=Samuel Ben-Or |title=The Invisible Stairway: Kabbalistic Meditations on the Hebrew Letters |location=Boulder |publisher=Kol-Emeth Publishers |year=2003 |pages=258-260}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the small town of Sefrou,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Rocky Mountain News]] |location=Denver, CO
|date=September 26, 1971 |title=Avital, Elfin Apostle of Silence |first=William |last=Gallo}}&lt;/ref&gt; near Fez, in the Atlas Mountains in Morocco. At the age of 14, Avital left his home in Sefrou to travel (via Algiers and France) to the newly established state of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The National Jewish Monthly |issue=February 1976 |title=Space, Silence and Kabbala |first=Myra |last=Sklarew |authorlink=Myra Sklarew}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There he spent the next ten years living in a ''kibbutz'' and studying physics, agronomy, theology, and theatre.&lt;ref name="The Denver Post 1985"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Denver Post]] |date=November 20, 1985 |title=Boulder Mime Invites Audience Truly to Get Into the Act |first=Arlynn |last=Nellhaus}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1958, he traveled to Paris, France, to study dance and drama at the Sorbonne, as well as to study mime with the French masters, Etienne Decroux, Jean-Louis Barrault, and Marcel Marceau.&lt;ref name="Rocky Mountain News 1983"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Rocky Mountain News]] |location=Denver, CO |date=December 30, 1983 |title=Mime’s Silent World Enhances Creativity, Increases Honesty |first=Larry |last=Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avital later performed with the Compagnie de Mime under the direction of Decroux' son, Maximilien Decroux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Avital |first=Samuel |title=Mime and Beyond: The Silent Outcry |location=Prescott Valley, AZ |publisher=HOHM Press |year=1985 |page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pantomime-mime.com/pantomime/Samuel_Avital|title=Pantomime  Samuel Avital|work=pantomime-mime.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004202810/http://www.pantomime-mime.com/pantomime/Samuel_Avital|archivedate=2015-10-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Avital joined his friend (and a fellow student of Etienne Decroux), Moni Yakim, in New York, performing with him in his Pantomime Theatre of New York. At the same time, he also performed off-Broadway, and later began to tour throughout North and South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Avital |first=Samuel |title=Mime and Beyond: The Silent Outcry |location=Prescott Valley, AZ |publisher=HOHM Press |year=1985 |page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, he was invited to teach in the Theater Department at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Well Known Mime To Present Show |newspaper=The La Marque Times |location=La Marque, Texas |date=April 6, 1972 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, he moved to Boulder, Colorado and founded Le Centre Du Silence Mime School, which has held an annual International Summer Mime Workshop ever since.&lt;ref name="The Denver Post 1985"/&gt;  As an extension of this work, Avital has also developed a unique method of bodywork called, BodySpeak, for cultivating kinesthetic awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jane |last=Evenson |title=The ultimate object: Overcoming self-created obstacles through mime |journal=Journal of Bodywork &amp; Movement Therapies |volume=5 |number=2 |year=2001 |pages=101-109 |doi=10.1054/jbmt.2000.0220}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Avital |first=Samuel |title=The BodySpeak Manual: Moving Mind and Body |location=Boulder |publisher=1st Books Library |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kabbalah teaching==
In recent years, Avital has begun teaching Kabbalah publicly in a series of seminars called, Gathering the Sparks, in Boulder, Colorado. Though less well known as a teacher of Kabbalah than as a mime artist, Avital was steeped in the Jewish mystical tradition from his youth and has taught a number of students privately through the years.&lt;ref name="Rocky Mountain News 1983"/&gt;  Avital is descended from a long line of distinguished Moroccan rabbis, jurists, and poets, nearly all of whom were also learned in the secret teachings of the Kabbalah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Avital |first=Samuel Ben-Or |title=The Invisible Stairway: Kabbalistic Meditations on the Hebrew Letters |location=Boulder |publisher=Kol-Emeth Publishers |year=2003 |pages=258-265}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Publications==
In addition to numerous articles, Avital is the author of several books, including the classic: ''Le Centre Du Silence Mime Work'' (1975), followed by a German edition entitled, ''Mimenspiel'' (1985), ''The Mime Workbook'' (1977),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Mime Workbook |journal=[[American Libraries]] |volume=9 |number=3 |year=1978 |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mime and Beyond: The Silent Outcry'' (1985), ''The Conception Mandala: Creative Techniques for Inviting a Child into Your Life'' (1992, co-authored with Mark Olsen), ''The BodySpeak Manual: Moving Mind and Body'' (2001), and ''The Invisible Stairway: Kabbalistic Meditations on the Hebrew Letters'' (2003).

'''Seeta''' (or '''Sita''') '''Devi''' (1912–1983), born '''Renee Smith''', was one of the early stars of [[silent films]] in the [[Indian Cinema|Indian film industry]].&lt;ref name="hansen"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Stri Bhumika: Female Impersonators and Actresses on the Parsi Stage|last=Hansen|first=Kathryn|publisher=Economic and Political Weekly|date=29 August 1998|volume=33|issue=35|jstor=4407133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[Image:Seeta Devi as Gopa in film, Prem Sanyas (The Light of Asia) 1925.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Seeta Devi as Gopa in secene from film, ''[[Prem Sanyas]]'' (''The Light of Asia'') 1925]]
[[Himanshu Rai]] cast Smith, an [[Anglo-Indian]], in ''[[Prem Sanyas]]'', the movie which is better known by its English title: ''The Light of Asia''. This was her debut film as Seeta Devi, and it made her a star immediately. Later she acted under the banner of [[Madan Theatre]]s as well.

Three of her most successful films were: ''The Light of Asia'', ''Shiraz'', and ''Prapancha Pash''. All three of these films were made through the collaboration of German film director [[Franz Osten]] and Indian actor-producer Himanshu Rai along with [[Bavaria]]n company '''Emelka'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001341/134149eo.pdf "Indian Films and Western Audiences", an article by Jerzy Toeplitz, from Unesco website]&lt;/ref&gt; This unique [[trilogy]] were connected to three different religions and based on three different stories of Indian history/mythology: ''The Light of Asia'' was based on the life of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], ''Shiraz'' was based on construction of the [[Taj Mahal]] and ''Prapancha Pash'', better known by its English title ''[[A Throw of Dice]]'', was based on a story from the [[Mahabharata]]. Seeta Devi was the leading actress in all these three films, though the role in ''Shiraz'' was that of 'the other woman'.

Three of her other successful films, ''Durgesh Nandini'', ''Kapal Kundala'' and ''Krishnakanter Will'' were based on popular novels of [[Bankim Chandra Chatterjee]].

Many believed that Renee Smith and her sister Percy Smith alternatively appeared as 'Seeta Devi'.&lt;ref name="hansen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/specials/slideshows/20s/20-4.htm A slideshow from Hindustan Times website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523012330/http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/specials/slideshows/20s/20-4.htm |date=2008-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Susanna Tamaro''' ({{IPA-it|suˈzanna taˈmaːro}}; [[Trieste]], 12 December 1957) is an Italian [[novelist]]. She has also worked as a scientific documentarist and movie maker direction assistant.

==Biography==
{{Prose|section|date=September 2009}}
Susanna Tamaro was born in a middle class [[family]] in Trieste. Her mother is related to the Italian writer [[Italo Svevo]]. In 1976 Tamaro obtained a teaching diploma, and she received a scholarship to study at the ''[[Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia]]'', an Italian [[school]] of [[film|cinema]], where she obtained a [[diploma]] in [[Film direction|direction]].

In 1978, she started wring her first short stories and in 1981 she wrote her first novel: ''Illmitz''. It was rejected by all the publishing houses she approached and to these days it is unpublished.

In the 1980s she collaborated with [[RAI]].

In 1989, her novel ''La testa fra le nuvole'' (''Head in Clouds'') was published by Marsilio. She fell ill with asthmatic [[bronchitis]] and was forced to move from [[Rome]] to [[Orvieto]], in [[Umbria]]. Her second novel ''Per voce sola'' (''Just For One Voice'') (1991) won the [[International PEN]] price and was translated into several languages. In 1991, she wrote  a book for children ''Cuore di ciccia''.

In 1994, she wrote ''Va' dove ti porta il cuore'' (in English ''Follow your Heart''). The book was an international bestseller and it became the "Italian book most sold in the 20th century".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corriere.it/cultura/libri/11_aprile_27/tamaro-bibliografia_d76f6afa-70dd-11e0-ab04-b531fdc27c0d.shtml Article from ''Corriere della Sera]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The plot of ''Follow Your Heart'' revolves around Olga, an elderly woman who decides to write a long letter to her granddaughter in America. Olga reflects on her life and reveals to her granddaughter their family's secrets. This novel was translated into more than 35 languages. In 1996, the Italian director, [[Cristina Comencini]], made a [[film]] based on the novel. In 2006, she wrote ''Ascolta la mia voce'' (''Listen to my voice''), a sequel of ''Follow your Heart''. This novel was translated in twelve languages.

From 1996 to 1998 she contributed to ''[[Famiglia Cristiana]]'', a popular Italian [[magazine]]. In 1997, she published the novel "Anima Mundi," chronicling the story of a friendship between two women.

In 2001 she wrote ''Raccontami''; in 2002 ''Più fuoco, più vento''; in 2003 ''Fuori''. In this novel, Tamaro revealed her position as [[pro-life]], [[euthanasia]] and scientific [[research]] on [[embryos]]. She is largely sympathetic to the position taken by the [[Catholic Church]] on these topics.

In 2008, she published ''Luisito- A Love Story''.

In September 2018 she announced the release of her next book and anticipated that in it she tells of being affected by [[Asperger syndrome]] since the early years of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} {{cite news |last=Tamaro | first=Susanna |title=La sfida di Susanna Tamaro: «La mia vita con l’Asperger» |url=https://www.corriere.it/cultura/18_settembre_16/susanna-tamaro-il-tuo-sguardo-illumina-il-mondo-solferino-brano-7569698e-b9c6-11e8-a205-6445d272b52d.shtml |newspaper=[[Corriere della Sera]] |date=17 September 2018 |accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theodore Brewster Taylor''' (more commonly known as Ted Taylor) was an accomplished American [[Theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]], specifically concerning [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. His higher education includes a PhD from [[Cornell University]] in theoretical physics, and though Taylor is relatively unknown to the public, his most noteworthy contributions to the field of nuclear weaponry were his small bomb developments at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos Laboratory]] in New Mexico.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Curve_of_Binding_Energy.html?id=qVmZWWqrO5IC|title=The Curve of Binding Energy: A Journey into the Awesome and Alarming World of Theodore B.

==Early life==

Ted Taylor was born in [[Mexico City]], Mexico on July 11, 1925.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His mother and father were both Americans; his mother, Barbara Southworth Howland Taylor, held a PhD in [[Mexican literature]] from the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://snaccooperative.org/ark:/99166/w61d86g2|title=Taylor, Barbara Howland @ SNAC|website=snaccooperative.org|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his father, Walter Clyde Taylor, was the director of a [[YMCA]] in Mexico City.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His father had been a widower with three sons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He then married Barbara in 1922, who was a widow with a son of her own.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Therefore, Ted had four older half brothers, and they were old enough that Ted was essentially raised as an only child.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, both of his maternal grandparents were [[Congregational church|congregationalist]] [[Missionary|missionaries]] in Guadalajara Ted grew up in a house in Cuernavaca which had no electricity and was on the street corner of Atlixco 13.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His home was quiet and religious.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was also filled with literature, mainly atlases and geographies, which he would read by candlelight.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This habituation followed him into adulthood, never quite adapting to the societal standards for electricity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Taylor showed interest in chemistry, specifically [[pyrotechnics]], when he received a chemistry set at the age of ten.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This fascination was enhanced when his neighborhood, Atlixco 13, added a chemistry laboratory that served a small and exclusive university in the area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through the lab Ted had access to items from local druggists that otherwise would not have been readily available.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These items included corrosive chemicals, explosive chemicals, nitric acid, and sulphuric acid, which allowed him to conduct his own experiments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Taylor often looked at the 1913 [[New International Encyclopedia]], which contained extensive chemistry, for new concoctions to make.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These included sleeping drugs, small explosives, [[Nitrocellulose|guncotton]], [[precipitates]], and many more.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His mother was extremely tolerant of his experimentation; however, she prohibited any experiments that involved [[nitroglycerin]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He attended the [[ASF Mexico|American School]] in Mexico City from elementary school through high school.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Taylor had a passion for music and in the mornings before school he would quietly sit for an hour and listen to his favorite songs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He was a gifted student and finished the fourth through sixth grades in one year.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Being an accelerated student, Taylor found himself three years younger than all of his friends as he emerged into his teens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Taylor graduated early from high school in 1941 at the age of 15.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After graduation he left Mexico to attend the [[Phillips Exeter Academy|Exeter Academy]], located in New Hampshire, for one year while he waited to meet the age requirements for universities in America.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While at the Academy he developed an interest in physics, though he displayed poor academic performance in his courses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; At Exeter he took Modern Physics which was taught by Elbert P. Little, a teacher who was greatly admired at the university.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Elbert P. Little gave Ted a letter grade D on his final winter term examination, however he quickly brushed this failure off.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Shortly after he confirmed that he wanted to be a physicist.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Apart from education, he also developed an interest in throwing [[Discus throw|discus]] at Exeter.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This interest continued into his college career, as he continued to throw discus at Caltech.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He enrolled at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1942 and then spent his second and third years in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program|Navy V-12 program]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  This accelerated his schooling and he graduated with a bachelor's degree in physics from the university in 1945 at just nineteen years old.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After graduation, he attended the [[United States Naval Reserve Midshipmen's School|midshipman school]] at [[Throggs Neck|Throgs Neck]], in Bronx, New York for one year to fulfill his naval [[active duty]] requirement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By the end of his time in the Navy he had received the status of Junior Grade Lieutenant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The Navy let him out in the summer of 1946 and he enrolled in a graduate program in [[theoretical physics]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During his graduate schooling, Ted worked part-time at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|Berkeley Radiation laboratory]], mainly on the [[cyclotron]] and a beta-ray spectrograph.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After failing an oral preliminary examination on mechanics and heat, and a second prelim in modern physics in 1949, Taylor was disqualified from the graduate program.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Taylor married Caro Armin in 1948 and had five children in the following years- Clare Hastings, Katherine Robertson, Christopher Taylor, Robert Taylor, and Jeffrey Taylor.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/05/us/theodore-taylor-a-designer-of-abombs-who-turned-against-them-dies-at-79.html|title=Theodore Taylor, a Designer of A-Bombs Who Turned Against Them, Dies at 79|last=Fox|first=Margalit|date=2004-11-05|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caro Armin was majoring in Greek at [[Scripps College]], a Liberal Arts University in Claremont California.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The drive from the California Institute of Technology was a relatively short commute, so Taylor went down to visit her whenever he could.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both Caro and Taylor were very shy people, and unsure of what the future held.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When they first met they both believed that Ted would be a college professor in a sleepy town, and that Caro would be a librarian.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They felt that these professions in a small college town was their speed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After 44 years of marriage the couple divorced in 1992.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Taylor eventually gained acceptance into a physics PhD program at the [[Cornell University|University of Cornell]] in 1953 and completed the program in 1954.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; At Cornell, Ted maintained his childhood passion for music and had his room equipped with a speaker system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This was uncommon among his [[Experimental physics|experimentalist physicist]] peers, but his [[Theoretical physics|theoretical physicists]] embraced the music.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While at Cornell Taylor picked up the hobby of [[Cue sports|billiards]], and in the afternoons after school he played billiards for almost ten hours a week.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He believed that billiards related to [[particle physics]]; of capture cross-sections and [[neutron scattering]], of infinite reflectors and fast-neutron-induced fission chain reaction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The behavior of the interacting balls on the table, and the nature of their [[elastic collision]]s, all within the confining framework of the reflector cushions, helped him to conceptualize these difficult abstractions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Early career==

Prior to Taylor's work at Los Alamos, he had actually firmly declared an anti-nuclear weapons stance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While at the midshipmen school, he received news of the [[Little Boy|atomic bomb that the U.S. dropped on Hiroshima Japan]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He immediately wrote a letter home discussing the perils of nuclear proliferation and his fears that it would lead to the end of mankind in the event of another war.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He showed some optimism though, as he felt with proper leadership the nuclear bomb could actually result in the end of wars on earth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Either way, he was still very curious about the field of [[nuclear physics]] after his time as an undergraduate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Theodore Taylor began his work in nuclear physics in 1949 when he was hired to a junior position at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] in the Theoretical Division.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He received this job after failing out of the PhD program at Berkley; [[J. Carson Mark]] connected Taylor with a leader at Los Alamos and recommended him for a position.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Taylor was unsure of the details about his new job at Los Alamos prior to his arrival.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He had only been briefed that his first assignment was to investigate the [[Neutron transport|Neutron Diffusion Theory]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; which is a theoretical analysis of neutron movement within a [[nuclear core]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nuclear-power.net/nuclear-power/reactor-physics/neutron-diffusion-theory/|title=Neutron Diffusion Theory - Nuclear Power|website=www.nuclear-power.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at work at Los Alamos, his strictly anti-nuclear development beliefs changed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His theory on preventing nuclear war turned to developing bombs of unprecedented power in an attempt to make people, including governments, so afraid of nuclear warfare that they wouldn’t dare engage in this sort of altercation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He continued in his junior position at Los Alamos until 1953, when he took a temporary leave of absence to obtain his PhD from [[Cornell University|Cornell]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He returned to the program in 1954, and by 1956 he was famous for his work in small bomb development.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In fact, [[Freeman Dyson]] is quoted as saying, "A great part of the small-bomb development of the last five years [at Los Alamos] was directly due to Ted".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although the majority of the brilliant minds at Los Alamos were focused on developing the [[Fusion Bomb|fusion bomb]], Ted remained hard at work on improving [[fission bomb]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His innovations in this area of study were so important that he was eventually given the freedom to choose whatever he wanted to study, instead of being confined to the narrow scope of direct orders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Eventually, Ted's stance on nuclear warfare and weapon development changed, and thus altered his projected career path. In 1956, Taylor left his position at Los Alamos and went to work for a company called [[General Atomics]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Here, he developed [[TRIGA]], which was a reactor that produced isotopes used in the medical field.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Taylor then began working on [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]], which was a project that sought to develop a form of space travel that relied on nuclear energy as the fuel source, in 1958.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The spacecraft was proposed to utilize a series of nuclear fission reactions as its source of propellant, thus improving space travel while eliminating the earth's source of fuel for nuclear weaponry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In collaboration with his close friend [[Freeman Dyson]], Taylor lead the project development team for six years until the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty|1963 Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] was instituted.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After this treaty, the project was no longer viable because they could not test their developments.

Taylor was also featured in the 1984 [[PBS]] series, ''[[The Voyage of the Mimi]]'', starring a young [[Ben Affleck]].

== Late career ==
Theodore Taylor's career shifted again after project Orion. He developed an even greater fear of the potential ramifications of his entire life’s work, and began taking precautionary measures to mitigate those concerns. In 1964 he served as the deputy director of the [[Defense Atomic Support Agency]] (a branch within the Department of Defense), where he managed the U.S. nuclear weapons inventory.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A17358-2004Nov1.html|title=Theodore Taylor Dies; Tried To Redirect Nuclear Power (washingtonpost.com)|website=www.washingtonpost.com|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 1966 he created a consulting firm called the International Research and Technology Corporation, located in [[Vienna]], Austria, which sought to prevent the development of more nuclear weapons programs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Taylor also worked as a visiting professor at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] and [[Princeton University]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His focus eventually turned to [[renewable energy]], and In 1980 Taylor started a company called Nova Incorporated, which focused on nuclear energy alternatives as a means of supplementing the energy requirements of the earth.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He studied energy capture from sources like cooling [[ice pond]]s and heating [[solar pond]]s, and eventually turned to energy conservation within buildings.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Concerning this work in energy conservation, he founded a not-for-profit organization in Montgomery County, Maryland called Damascus Energy, which focuses on energy efficiency within the home.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Theodore Taylor also served on the President of the United States' commission concerning the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island Accident]],&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; working to mitigate the issues associated with the reactor meltdown.

== Legacy ==
Theodore Taylor was involved in many important projects and made numerous contributions to nuclear development for the United States. During his time at Los Alamos, He was responsible for designing the smallest fission bomb of the era, named [[Davy Crockett (nuclear device)|Davy Crockett]], which weighed only 60 pounds, measured approximately 12 inches across, and could produce between 10 and 20 kilotons of force.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This device was formerly known as the M28 Weapons System.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bolger|first=Daniel|date=July 2014|title=The Crockett's Red Glare|url=|journal=Army Magazine|volume=64|pages=55–57|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Davy Crockett itself was the M388 Atomic Round fired from the weapons system, which functioned similarly to how any other modern rocket propelled round would ([[RPG-7|See RPG]]).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It was a mounted weapons system, which means that it would be set up, aimed, and fired as a [[crew-served weapon]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Taylor also designed fission bombs even smaller than Davy Crockett, but those were not developed until long after he left Los Alamos.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, he even designed a bomb so small that it weighed only 20 pounds, but it was never actually developed and tested.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, Taylor designed the [[Mark 18 nuclear bomb|Super Alloy Bomb]], also known as the "SOB," which still holds the record for the largest fission explosion ever tested, producing over 500 kilotons of force.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, Taylor was credited with developing multiple techniques that improved the fission bomb. For example, he was largely responsible for the development of [[Boosted fission weapon|boosting]], which is a technique that improves the reaction yield and efficiency of a nuclear reaction.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This technique was a re-invention of the implosion mechanism that was used in the bomb detonated at Hiroshima.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He theorized a series of nuclear reactions within the implosion mechanism that, in combination, trigger the large chain reaction to detonate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This eliminated much of the energy waste and necessity for precision of the original reaction mechanism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This technique is still found in all U.S. fission nuclear weapons today.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He also was responsible for developing a technique that greatly reduced the size of atomic bombs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; First tested in a bomb called “Scorpion,” it utilized a reflector made of [[beryllium]], which was drastically lighter than the metals that generally were used as reflectors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After these types of  breakthroughs, Taylor became more of an important figure at Los Alamos.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He was included in high priority situations reserved for important personnel, and was even taken to the [[The Pentagon|pentagon]] as a consultant on strategies and the potential outcomes of a nuclear war with Russia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In total, Taylor was responsible for the development of eight bombs- the Super Alloy Bomb, Davey Crockett, Scorpion, Hamlet, Bee, Hornet, Viper, and the Puny Plutonium bomb.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The latter, called the Puny Plutonium bomb, was the first ever dud in the history of U.S. nuclear tests.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, he produced the bomb called Hamlet after receiving direct orders from military officials to pursue a project in bomb efficiency, which ended up being the most efficient bomb in the history of the U.S.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Apart from bombs, Ted also explored concepts of producing large amounts of nuclear fuel in an expedited manner. His plans, known as MICE (Megaton Ice Contained Explosions), essentially sought to plant a thermonuclear weapon deep in the ice and detonate it, resulting in a giant underground pool of radioactive materials that could then be retrieved.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While his idea had merit, He ultimately received little support for this concept and the project never came to fruition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Publications and other works ==
Ted Taylor was an accomplished author in the latter part of his career. He worked in cooperation with many specialists in other fields to publish his work on anti-nuclear proliferation and sustainable nuclear energy. Perhaps the greatest fear that propelled him to work so fervently in these areas was the realization that the consequences of nuclear material ending up in the wrong hands could be severe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Nuclear Theft: Risks and Safeguards'' is a book that Theodore Taylor wrote in collaboration with Mason Willrich in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.issuelab.org/resource/nuclear-theft-risks-and-safeguards.html|title=Nuclear Theft: Risks and Safeguards|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to reviews, the book predicted a future where nuclear energy was the primary energy source in the United States, and therefore needed enhanced protective measures to protect the public.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quester|first=George H.|date=1975|title=Review of Nuclear Theft: Risks and Safeguards|jstor=2148706|journal=Political Science Quarterly|volume=90|issue=1|pages=136–138|doi=10.2307/2148706}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Taylor and Willrich provide multiple recommendations on ways to prevent nuclear material from ending up in the wrong hands, as they anticipated that there would be multiple more sources of nuclear byproducts and therefore more opportunity for nuclear theft.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This book likely was a culmination of much of Ted's work in the field, as he often toured nuclear reactor sites and provided insight on potential weak points in their security measures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Taylor also Co-authored the book, ''The Restoration of the Earth,'' with Charles C. Humpstone, which, according to reviews, focused on techniques to enhance [[sustainability]], as well as expanded on different sources of energy that could be used alternatively to meet the power needs of the earth.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/restoration-earth-Theodore-B-Taylor/dp/0060142316|title=The restoration of the earth|last=results|first=search|date=1973|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|isbn=9780060142315|edition= 1st|location=New York|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book was also a culmination of his focus on nuclear security and the ramifications of the use of nuclear weaponry.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In it he addressed the potential effects of [[nuclear fallout]] on the environment.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This 1973 hardcover discussed potential sources of energy in the year 2000, along with the conceptualization of safer alternatives to the methods of acquiring nuclear energy that were available at the time.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In fact, Taylor indirectly referenced a concept for a nuclear reactor which is inherently similar to a reactor that he patented in 1964.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Theodore Taylor spent much of his time studying the risk potential of the nuclear power fuel cycle after learning about the detrimental effects that his nuclear weapons had on the environment, so he sought to explore new opportunities for safer use of nuclear power.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In his writing, Taylor argued that the most dangerous and devastating events that could possibly occur during nuclear research would most likely happen at reactors that are incapable of running efficiently and maintaining a safe temperature.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Taylor went on to state that the prioritization of safety in nuclear reactors is relatively low compared to how it should be, and that if one were to create a nuclear reactor with the capability of cooling down—without the initiation of a fission reaction—then efforts at harvesting nuclear energy would be more incentivized and exponentially safer.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Taylor also wrote the book ''Nuclear Proliferation: Motivations, Capabilities and Strategies for Control'' with Harold Feiveson and Ted Greenwood.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1977-01-01|title=Nuclear proliferation: motivations, capabilities, and strategies for control|url=https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7286490|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book explains the two most dangerous mechanisms by which nuclear proliferation could be devastating for the world, as well as how to disincentivize nuclear proliferation within destabilizing political systems.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Taylor further collaborated with [[George Gamow]] on a study called, "What the World Needs Is a Good Two-Kiloton Bomb," which investigated the concept of small nuclear artillery weapons.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This paper reflected another shift in Taylor’s beliefs about nuclear weapons. He had changed from his deterrent position to a position that sought to develop small yield nuclear weapons that could target specific areas and minimize collateral damage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Ted Taylor was not only involved in the publication of the aforementioned books, but he, along with a few of his colleagues, was also responsible for a number of patents involving nuclear physics. Taylor is credited with patenting a nuclear reactor with a prompt negative temperature coefficient and fuel element, along with a patent protecting their discovery of an efficient method of producing isotopes from thermonuclear explosions.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Citation|title=Production of isotopes from thermonuclear explosions|date=1959-04-21|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US3331744A/en|accessdate=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Citation|title=Reactor with prompt negative temperature|date=1964-03-31|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US3127325A/en|accessdate=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patent concerning the production of isotopes from thermonuclear explosions was groundbreaking because of its efficiency and cost effectiveness.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It also provides a means for attaining necessary elements that otherwise are difficult to find in nature.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; prior to this discovery, the cost per neutron in a nuclear reaction was relatively high.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The patent concerning the prompt negative temperature coefficient was groundbreaking because it provided a markedly safer reactor even in the event of misuse.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; With the negative temperature coefficient, the reactor can mitigate sudden surges of reactivity propelled into the system.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; These patented realizations would later become vital components in the future of nuclear technology.

''The Curve of Binding Energy'', by John McPhee, is written primarily about the life of Theodore Taylor, as he and McPhee traveled together quite often—spending a great deal of time with one another.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is evident that during their time together, McPhee was very inclined to learn from Taylor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many of Taylor’s personal opinions regarding nuclear energy and safety are mentioned throughout McPhee’s writing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; McPhee voices one of Taylor’s bigger concerns in particular—that plutonium can be devastating if left in the wrong hands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to McPhee, Taylor suspected that if plutonium were to be acquired by someone with ill-intentions and handled improperly, the aftermath could be catastrophic—as plutonium is a rather volatile element and can be lethal for anyone within hundreds of miles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This clearly can be avoided, Taylor suggests, if nuclear reactors are protected and all sources of nuclear fuel elements are heavily guarded.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ultimately, it is evident that most of Taylor’s writing—along with McPhee’s narration of Taylor’s viewpoints and suggestions—is ahead of its time and still applicable today.

==The Santa Claus Machine and Pugwash==
According to Freitas and Merkle,&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Freitas Jr., Ralph C. Merkle, Kinematic Self-Replicating Machines, Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX, 2004; http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM.htm&lt;/ref&gt; the only known extant source on Taylor’s concept of the “[[Santa Claus machine]]” is found in Nigel Calder's  ''Spaceships of the Mind''.&lt;ref&gt;Calder, Nigel ''Spaceships of the Mind'', Viking Press, New York, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept would use a large [[mass spectrometer]] to separate an ion beam into atomic elements for later use in making products.

Taylor was a member of the [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs]] and attended several of its meetings during the 1980s. After his retirement he lived in [[Wellsville, New York]].

He died on October 28, 2004 of coronary artery disease.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost-obituary"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A17358-2004Nov1.html|title=Theodore Taylor Dies; Tried To Redirect Nuclear Power|publisher=Washington Post|date=2004-11-02|accessdate=2008-04-25 | first=Joe | last=Holley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freeman Dyson On Ted Taylor==
[[Freeman Dyson]] said of Taylor, "Very few people have Ted's imagination. ... I think he is perhaps the greatest man that I ever knew well.  And he is completely unknown."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McPhee|first1=John|title=The Curve of Binding Energy: A Journey into the Awesome and Alarming World of Theodore B.

'''Thomas Andrews Drake''' (born 1957) is a former senior executive of the U.S. [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), a decorated [[United States Air Force]] and [[United States Navy]] veteran, and a [[whistleblower]]. In 2010, the government alleged that Drake mishandled documents, one of the few such [[Espionage Act]] cases in U.S. history. Drake's defenders claim that he was instead being persecuted for challenging the [[Trailblazer Project]].&lt;ref name=shane3/&gt;&lt;ref name="afp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="doj"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wapo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jdsupra"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hosenball"/&gt; He is the 2011 recipient of the [[The Ridenhour Prizes|Ridenhour Prize for Truth-Telling]] and co-recipient of the [[Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence]] (SAAII) award.

On June 9, 2011, all 10 original charges against him were dropped. Drake rejected several deals because he refused to "plea bargain with the truth". He eventually pleaded to one misdemeanor count for exceeding authorized use of a computer;&lt;ref name="josh_gerstein 11.9.6"/&gt; [[Jesselyn Radack]] of the [[Government Accountability Project]], who helped represent him, called it an act of "[[civil disobedience]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/06/11/984192/-Too-Classified-to-Try-Myth-in-Failed-Drake-Prosecution?via=blog_591987 Jesselyn Radack], Daily Kos blog, 2011 6 11&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Drake's father was a [[World War II]] veteran and his mother a secretary for [[Pearl S. Buck]]. He entered the U.S. Air Force in 1979, becoming an Airborne Voice Processing Specialist, with a fluency in [[German language|German]], and went on [[ELINT]] (electronic intelligence) missions.&lt;ref name=bishop11/&gt; It was in that capacity that he encountered the surveillance state of [[East Germany]] and the [[Stasi]], which informed his worldview and to which he compares developments in the United States since the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref name="TRNN award"/&gt; Drake left the Air Force in 1989. He was also in the U.S. Navy, where he analyzed intelligence for the National Military Joint Intelligence Center.&lt;ref name=exhe/&gt; According to the Washington Post, he also at one time worked with the CIA.&lt;ref name=WP20100714/&gt; In 1989, Drake began work as an NSA contractor, evaluating [[software]].&lt;ref name=shane3/&gt;&lt;ref name=WP20100714/&gt; As a contractor, he worked on projects like JACKPOT and LIBRARIAN, becoming an expert in the quality-testing of software and working on a system for measuring the quality of computer code at the NSA. Drake also continued his academic studies.&lt;ref name=exhf/&gt;&lt;ref name=qweek98/&gt;

In 2000, he was hired as a software systems quality specialist and management and information technology consultant for [[Columbia, Maryland|Columbia]], Maryland-based Costal Research &amp; Technology Inc. (CRTI), a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], Virginia-based Computer Systems Management, Inc. (CSMI).&lt;ref name=dtic1/&gt;&lt;ref name=zoom1/&gt; In late 2001, he went to work at the NSA as a full-time employee at the [[National Security Agency|Signals Intelligence Directorate]] at [[Fort George G. Meade|Fort Meade]], [[Maryland]], with his actual first day on the job as an NSA employee being [[September 11, 2001]].&lt;ref name="jdsupra"/&gt;&lt;ref name=motion53/&gt;&lt;ref name=mayer2011/&gt; In 2002, he became a Technical Director for Software Engineering Implementation within the Cryptologic Systems and Professional Health Office. In 2003, Drake became a Process Portfolio Manager within NSA's newly formed [[National Security Agency|Directorate of Engineering]]. He held a Top Secret [[security clearance]].&lt;ref name="jdsupra"/&gt; During the congressional investigations into 9/11, he testified about NSA failures.&lt;ref name=WP20100714/&gt; In 2006 he was reassigned to the [[National Defense University]],&lt;ref name=WP20100714/&gt; where he became the NSA Chair and an Assistant Professor of Behavioral Sciences within the [[Industrial College of the Armed Forces]] (ICAF).&lt;ref name="jdsupra"/&gt; Drake was forced to leave the NDU in 2007 when his security clearance was suspended, and he resigned from the NSA the next year.&lt;ref name="afp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jdsupra"/&gt;&lt;ref name=shane2/&gt; Drake then went to work at [[Strayer University]] but was forced from that job after his indictment of April 2010.&lt;ref name=shane2/&gt; He found work at an [[Apple Store]].&lt;ref name="WP20100714"/&gt;&lt;ref name=shane2/&gt; He then founded Knowpari Systems, a consulting firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.web2summit.com/web2011/public/schedule/speaker/125377|title=Speaker: Thomas Drake: Web 2.0 Summit 2011 - Co-produced by UBM TechWeb &amp; O'Reilly Conferences, October 17 - 19, 2011, San Francisco|publisher=|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Drake was awarded the [[The Ridenhour Prizes|Ridenhour Prize]] for Truth Telling&lt;ref name="ridenhourorg"/&gt; and was co-recipient of the [[Sam Adams Award|Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence (SAAII) award]].

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Whistleblowing on Trailblazer, and government response ==
{{NSA surveillance}}

=== Drake action within the NSA ===
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the NSA desired new tools to collect intelligence from the growing flood of information pouring out of the new digital networks like the internet. Drake became involved in the internal NSA debate between two of these tools, the [[Trailblazer Project]] and the [[ThinThread]] project.&lt;ref name=hosenball/&gt;&lt;ref name=shane2/&gt; He became part of the "minority" that favored ThinThread for several reasons,&lt;ref name=shane2/&gt; including its theoretical ability to protect the privacy of US individuals while gathering intelligence.&lt;ref name=WP20100714/&gt; Trailblazer required billions of dollars, dwarfing the cost of ThinThread. Drake eventually became "disillusioned, then indignant" regarding the problems he saw at the agency.&lt;ref name=WP20100714/&gt; Around 2000, NSA head [[Michael Hayden (general)|Michael Hayden]] chose Trailblazer over ThinThread; ThinThread was cancelled and Trailblazer ramped up, eventually employing [[IBM]], [[Leidos|SAIC]], [[Boeing]], [[Computer Sciences Corporation|CSC]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;James Bamford, ''[[The Shadow Factory]]'', Chapter "Trailblazer",  published by Doubleday, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Drake worked his way through the legal processes that are prescribed for government employees who believe that questionable activities are taking place in their departments.&lt;ref name=shane2/&gt; In accordance with whistleblower protection laws such as the [[Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act]], Drake complained internally to the designated authorities: to his bosses, the NSA Inspector General, the Defense Department Inspector General, and both the House and Senate Congressional intelligence committees.&lt;ref name=shane1/&gt;

He also kept in contact with [[Diane Roark]], a staffer for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] on the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Intelligence Committee]] of the [[U.S. Congress]] (the House committee responsible for oversight of the executive branch's intelligence activities).&lt;ref name=shane2/&gt; Roark was the "staff expert" on the NSA's budget,&lt;ref name=hosenball/&gt; and the two of them had met in 2000.&lt;ref name=WP20100714/&gt;

In September 2002, Roark and three former NSA officials, [[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]], J. Kirk Wiebe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whistleblower.org/program-areas/homeland-security-a-human-rights/surveillance/nsa-whistleblowers-bill-binney-a-j-kirk-wiebe|title=NSA Whistleblowers William (Bill) Binney, J. Kirk Wiebe |work=Government Accountability Project |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ed Loomis,&lt;ref name=harri1/&gt; filed a [[Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense|DoD Inspector General]] report regarding problems at NSA, including Trailblazer.&lt;ref name=WP20100714/&gt; Drake was a major source for the report, and gave information to [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] during its investigation of the matter.&lt;ref name=WP20100714/&gt; Roark tried to notify her superior, then-Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, [[Porter Goss]].&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt; She also attempted to contact [[William Rehnquist]], the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court at the time.&lt;ref name=WP20100714/&gt; In addition, Roark made an effort to inform [[Dick Cheney|Vice President Dick Cheney's]] legal counsel [[David Addington]], who had been a Republican staff colleague of hers on the committee in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=mayer2011/&gt; Addington was later revealed by a Washington Post report to be the author of the controlling legal and technical documents for the Bush administration's [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|warrantless surveillance program]], typing the documents on a [[TEMPEST|Tempest]]-shielded computer across from his desk in room 268 of the [[Eisenhower Executive Office Building]] and storing them in a vault in his office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/13/AR2008091302284_pf.html |title=Conflict Over Spying Led White House to Brink |author = Barton Gelman |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2008-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/nation/jan-june13/snowden2_06-28.html |title=To What Extent Did the Government Monitor Phone, Internet Activity After 9/11?  |publisher=PBS Newshour |date=June 28, 2013 |accessdate=June 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/jun/27/nsa-inspector-general-report-document-data-collection |title=NSA inspector general report on email and internet data collection under Stellar Wind – full document |publisher=The Guardian |date=June 27, 2013 |accessdate=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roark got no response from all three men.

=== NSA own inquiry and acknowledgement ===
By 2003, the NSA Inspector General (IG)&lt;ref name=WP20100714/&gt; had declared Trailblazer an expensive failure.&lt;ref name=spacew1/&gt; It cost more than 1 billion dollars.&lt;ref name=hosenball/&gt;&lt;ref name=shane1/&gt;&lt;ref name="BaltimoreSun0601"/&gt;&lt;ref name=econ1/&gt;

In 2004, the DoD IG produced a final report of its investigation that had been prompted by Roark &amp; the others in 2002. The report basically agreed with their assertions and found very serious flaws at NSA. For a time, the NSA was even banned from starting projects over a certain size, for fear it would waste the money. However, there were no plans to release this DoD IG report to the public at the time.&lt;ref name=harri1/&gt;

=== Eventual whistleblowing ===
In a 2011 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' article, journalist [[Jane Mayer]] wrote that Drake felt the NSA was committing serious crimes against the American people, on a level worse than what President [[Richard Milhous Nixon|Nixon]] had done in the 1970s. Drake reviewed the laws regarding disclosure of information, and decided that if he revealed [[unclassified]] information to a reporter, then the worst thing that would happen to him was probably that he would be fired.&lt;ref name=mayer2011/&gt;

In November 2005, Drake contacted Siobhan Gorman of ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' newspaper, sending her emails through [[Hushmail]] and discussing various topics.&lt;ref name=hosenball/&gt;&lt;ref name=shane2/&gt; He claims that he was very careful not to give her sensitive or classified information; it was one of the basic ground rules he set out at the beginning of their communication. This communication occurred around 2006.&lt;ref name=wired1/&gt; Gorman wrote several articles about waste, fraud, and abuse at the NSA, including articles on Trailblazer. She received an award from the Society of Professional Journalists for her series exposing government wrongdoing.&lt;ref name=hosenball/&gt; Judge [[Richard D. Bennett|Richard Bennett]] later ruled that "there is no evidence that Reporter&amp;nbsp;A relied upon any allegedly classified information found in Mr. Drake's house in her articles".&lt;ref name=Memorandum/&gt;

=== 2007 FBI raids ===
In July 2007, armed [[FBI]] agents raided the homes of Roark, Binney, and Wiebe, the same people who had filed the complaint with the DoD Inspector General in 2002.&lt;ref name=harri1/&gt; Binney claims they pointed guns at his wife and himself. Wiebe said it reminded him of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=mayer2011/&gt; None of these people were charged with any crimes. In November 2007, there was a raid on Drake's residence. His computers, documents, and books were confiscated. He was never charged with giving any sensitive information to anyone; the charge actually brought against him is for 'retaining' information ({{uscsub|18|793|e}}).&lt;ref name=motion53/&gt; The FBI tried to get Roark to testify against Drake; she refused.&lt;ref name=mayer2011/&gt; Reporter Gorman was not contacted by the FBI.&lt;ref name=WP20100714/&gt;&lt;ref name=shane2/&gt;

Drake initially cooperated with the investigation, telling the FBI about the alleged illegality of the NSA's activities.&lt;ref name=mayer2011/&gt; The government created a 'draft indictment' of Drake, prepared by prosecutor Steven Tyrrell. It listed charges as "disclosing classified information to a newspaper reporter and for conspiracy". Diane Roark, Binney, Wiebe, and Loomis (the complainants to the DoD IG in 2002) were also allegedly listed as "unindicted co-conspirators".&lt;ref name=harri1/&gt; In 2009 a new prosecutor came on the case, [[William Welch&amp;nbsp;II]],&lt;ref name=WP20100714/&gt;&lt;ref name=mayer2011/&gt; and changed the indictment. Some charges were removed, as was any naming of 'co-conspirators'. The new case only contained charges against Drake.&lt;ref name=harri1/&gt;

Prosecutors wanted Drake to plead guilty, but he refused. He believed that he was innocent of the charges against him.&lt;ref name=WP20100714/&gt; The government wanted him to help prosecute the other whistleblowers. He refused this as well.&lt;ref name=mayer2011/&gt; He later explained his motivations to the [[Ridenhour Prizes]] organization:

{{quote|I did what I did because I am rooted in the faith that my duty was to the American people ... I knew that you did not spy on Americans and that we were accountable for spending American taxpayer monies wisely.&lt;ref name=ridenhour/&gt;}}

=== Indictment ===
In April 2010, Drake was indicted by a Baltimore, Maryland [[grand jury]] on the following charges:&lt;ref name=shane3 /&gt;&lt;ref name="afp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="doj" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jdsupra" /&gt;
* Willful Retention of National Defense Information {{uscsub|18|793|e}} (5 counts)
** (793(e) is a modification of the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] made under the [[McCarran Internal Security Act]] of 1950)
* Obstructing justice {{uscsub|18|1519}} (1 count)
* Making a False Statement {{uscsub|18|1001|a}} (4 counts)

The [[indictment]] contained many other allegations; most of them did not relate to the actual charges against him. He was not specifically charged with unauthorized disclosure of classified information, nor was he charged at all under {{uscsub|18|798}}, the "SIGINT" statute.&lt;ref name=secnews1 /&gt; The indictment gave details about his communications with Roark and with Gorman, but he was not charged with any crime directly relating to those communications.&lt;ref name="jdsupra" /&gt; The indictment also did not list the names of Gorman or Roark, but they were confirmed by reporters (e.g. Mark Hosenball of ''Newsweek'').&lt;ref name=shane3 /&gt;&lt;ref name="hosenball" /&gt; Roark's lawyer claimed that the indictment contains a "mischaracterization of the facts" about the relationship between her client and Drake.&lt;ref name=hosenball /&gt; Roark herself later spoke out in support of Drake and the other whistleblowers of the Trailblazer project.&lt;ref name=mayer2011 /&gt;

The "willful retention" charges regarded five documents allegedly "related to the national defense" that were found at Drake's residence. The five documents in question were referred to as "What a Success,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/sgp/news/2012/07/nsa-wws.pdf |title=What A Success e-mail message |work=[[National Security Agency]] response to [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] request |date=July 20, 2012 |accessdate=March 22, 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HE81jeEm|archivedate=2013-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; "the Regular Meetings," "Volume is our Friend," "Trial and Testing," and "Collections Sites."&lt;ref name=indictment /&gt; "What a Success" was declassified a few months after Drake was indicted, and should never have been classified in the first place, according to an official complaint filed by J.&amp;nbsp;William Leonard, a former director of the [[Information Security Oversight Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2013/03/complaint_dismissed/ |title=Classification Complaint Arising from Thomas Drake Case Dismissed |last=Aftergood |first=Steven |publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]] Secrecy news |date=March 19, 2013 |accessdate=March 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Regular Meetings" was marked "UNCLASSIFIED" and posted on [[NSANet]] but prosecution argues the defendant should have known it was really classified. Drake's team also argued that the latter three of the five named documents were part of a collection of thousands of unclassified papers related to the DoD Inspector General Report (mentioned above). Drake's defense attorneys argued this meant that the defendant brought home the material accidentally, not "willfully."&lt;ref name=response76 /&gt;

The obstruction charge was related to Drake allegedly deleting documents while he was purportedly aware that the FBI was investigating leaks to the media, and that the FBI was contemplating investigating leaks to Siobhan Gorman of ''The Baltimore Sun''.&lt;ref name="jdsupra" /&gt; The false statements charge was filed in relation to the FBI's questioning of Drake without a lawyer present in the initial stages of the investigation when he was cooperating with them. One count is for alleged statements made by him regarding whether he had willfully taken certain documents home. Another count is for allegedly lying about the purported transmission of classified information to Gorman.&lt;ref name="doj" /&gt;&lt;ref name=mayer2011 /&gt; Drake's defenders point out that the government's own expert found that he had not destroyed any evidence. They also point out that Drake was careful not to give any classified information to Gorman, and that many of the documents in question were 'retroactively classified' after they were seized from his home by the FBI.&lt;ref name=mayer2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Radack_KOS /&gt;

The federal offices involved in filing the indictment included the DOJ [[Public Integrity Section]], DOJ [[United States Department of Justice Criminal Division|Criminal Division]], DOJ [[United States Department of Justice National Security Division|National Security Division]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], and the [[National Security Agency|NSA Office of Security &amp; Counterintelligence]].&lt;ref name="doj" /&gt; Drake was represented by James Wyda and Deborah Boardman, federal [[public defender]]s.&lt;ref name="wapo" /&gt;&lt;ref name=polit.11.3.14 /&gt;

Drake was also a client of the [[Government Accountability Project]], a whistleblower non-profit. [[Jesselyn Radack]], director of Homeland Security and Human Rights for GAP, worked with Drake. Author and NSA authority [[James Bamford]] was a consultant for Drake's defense as well.&lt;ref name=bish1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Radack_bio /&gt;

Government prosecutor [[William Welch II|William M. Welch II]], who had previously been charged with [[contempt of court|contempt]] and removed from the [[Ted Stevens]] case, served as the government's initial Senior Litigation Counsel,&lt;ref name="lawcom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mainjusticecom" /&gt; John P. Pearson of the DOJ [[Public Integrity Section]] was the government's Trial Attorney, and [[Lanny A. Breuer]] was in charge of overseeing the prosecution.&lt;ref name=mayer2011 /&gt;

Federal Judge Richard D. Bennett was responsible for hearing handling the case, and initially set trial for June 2011.&lt;ref name=naka2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=josh_gerstein.2011.3.17 /&gt;

The Drake case has been written about in the ''Washington Post'', the ''New York Times'', Agence France-Press, ''[[Newsweek]]'', ''Wired'', the Washingtonian.com, the [[Federation of American Scientists]]' Secrecy News, ''Politico'', and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;See other refs&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jesselyn Radack]], of the [[Government Accountability Project]], has also discussed the case.&lt;ref&gt;''The Huffington Post'': [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jesselyn-radack/why-thomas-drake-is-not-a_b_864322.html Why Thomas Drake Is Not an Enemy of the State.] May 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. government publicly stated that the prosecution of Thomas Drake was not intended to [[chilling effect (law)|deter government employees from reporting problems]]. "Whistle-blowers are the key to many, many department investigations—we don't retaliate against them, we encourage them," Matthew A. Miller, a spokesman for the Justice Department, said. "This indictment was brought on the merits, and nothing else."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shane|first=Scott|title=Obama Takes a Hard Line Against Leaks to Press|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/12/us/politics/12leak.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=29 December 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Court proceedings ====
In the spring of 2011,{{when|date=June 2011}} the prosecution made several moves to restrict the normally open proceedings of a jury trial in a United States courtroom, as reported by Gerstein at ''[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]'' and others. This was done under the legal auspices of the [[Classified Information Procedures Act]] (CIPA), which attempts in theory to prevent the release of classified information during open trials. The prosecution also moved to use the controversial "[[silent witness rule]]," in which exhibits are hidden from the public by the use of "code words" in court. The government had only attempted to use the rule a handful of times previously; its legality has been challenged under the [[Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States|Fifth]] and [[Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States|Sixth Amendments]].&lt;ref name=josh_gerstein11.3.14 /&gt; The government also moved to restrict cross-examination of witnesses,&lt;ref name=fasmotion57 /&gt; to restrict jurors from reading the Siobhan Gorman ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' articles about problems with NSA and [[Trailblazer Project|Trailblazer]],&lt;ref name=josh_gerstein11.3.10 /&gt; and to prevent the defense from making arguments or introducing evidence to the courtroom about [[whistleblowing]] or overclassification.&lt;ref&gt;See under "external links," the FAS website of the court documents&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the prosecution also had the court [[Under seal|seal]] two exhibits the defense had already published in one of its public court filings, which listed various documents the prosecution would try to use at trial.&lt;ref name=josh_gerstein.11.3.17 /&gt;&lt;ref name=fas.org2011.71.exh /&gt;

The prosecution argued that the [[Classified Information Procedures Act|CIPA]] also applied to non-classified information and attempted to have unclassified information presented at trial in [[redaction|redacted]] form only.&lt;ref name=fasunclass /&gt;

===== Government arguments =====
Referring to Siobhan Gorman's ''Baltimore Sun'' news stories, the government legally pleaded that the "newspaper articles are unduly prejudicial. The only purpose for the admission of these newspaper articles is to put NSA on trial." The prosecution also contended that it had no legal obligation to prove Drake's intent to harm national security, saying that it "does not have to prove that defendant intended to harm the country" under the specific part of the Espionage Act that Drake was charged with; {{uscsub|18|793|e}}. As for the 'overclassification' defense, the government argued that such a defense claim would be 'confusing to the jury' and thus irrelevant to the charges.&lt;ref name=FAS_Overclass /&gt; The government also argued that any discussion at trial of the legal concept of whistle-blowing would likewise be irrelevant to the charges.

===== Final disposition =====
In early June, shortly after the May 22, 2011, broadcast of a ''60 Minutes'' episode on the Drake case, the government dropped all of the charges against Drake and agreed not to seek any jail time in return for Drake's agreement to plead guilty to a single misdemeanor of misusing the agency's computer system.

At the July sentencing hearing the presiding judge, [[Richard D. Bennett]] of Maryland's Federal District Court, issued harsh words for the government, saying that it was "unconscionable" to charge a defendant, two years after his home was searched, with a list of serious crimes that could have resulted in 35 years in prison, only to drop the 10 counts of the indictment on the eve of trial.&lt;ref name=transcript &gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/sgp/jud/drake/071511-transcript.pdf |title=Transcript of Sentencing Proceeding, ''United States of America v. Thomas A. Drake'' |publisher=United States District Court of Maryland |date=July 15, 2011 |accessdate=August 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expressing his "irritation" with the prosecution, Bennett also completely rejected the government's request for a $50,000 fine, despite the sentencing guidelines recommending a fine of $500-$5,000. He noted that Drake had been financially devastated, spending $82,000 on his defense, losing his $154,600 job at the NSA and his pension, and being fired from his university teaching position. He sentenced Drake to one year of probation and 240 hours of community service.&lt;ref name=transcript /&gt;

=== Since 2012 ===
Drake appeared on ''[[The Daily Show]]'' on August 6, 2012, to talk about the history of his case,&lt;ref&gt;Episode #17135: [http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/mon-august-6-2012/a-leak-of-their-own---license-to-spill A Leak of Their Own - License to Spill]&lt;/ref&gt; and in September sent an audio message of support to [[CryptoParty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/cryptoparty|title=cryptoparty|publisher=SoundCloud|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 15, 2013, Drake spoke at a [[National Press Club]] Luncheon about the national intelligence community and its attitude towards whistle-blowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/311537-1|title=NSA Whistleblower Discusses Intelligence Community|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drake inspired [[Edward Snowden]] to leak information on the NSA spying program [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;WNYC June 26, 2013, The Takeaway. available at http://www.thetakeaway.org/2013/jun/26/nsa-leaker-thomas-drake-edward-snowdens-case/ accessed 7-7-13&lt;/ref&gt; Snowden went public rather than reporting within the system due to the reprisals against Drake (and other whistleblowers), which led the Assistant [[Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense|Defense Dept Inspector General]] (DoD IG) in charge of the [[Department of Defense Whistleblower Program|whistleblower unit]], [[John Crane (government official)|John Crane]], to himself become a whistleblower when it became apparent that Drake's identity had been leaked by DoD IG to the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Dept]].&lt;ref name="Spiegel"&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/ex-us-official-reveals-risks-faced-by-internal-govt-critics-a-1093360.html "Blowing the Whistle: Former US Official Reveals Risks Faced by Internal Critics"], by Mark Hertsgaard, Felix Kasten, Marcel Rosenbach, and Holger Stark; ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' 05/22/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Drake has become an activist against the [[surveillance state]], frequently giving interviews and speaking at events such as [[Restore the Fourth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeIeU8T1fbA|title=Thomas Drake (NSA Whistleblower) speaks at Restore the Fourth DC|date=10 July 2013|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the themes of his speeches and interviews is a "privacy exercise" as follows "Put your entire life in a box, your documents, bank accounts, your passwords, everything—and give it to a complete stranger—a fellow American for safekeeping. Would you do it?" he states that he has yet to encounter a "yes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m_GvpuVxV8|title=Whistleblowers, Part Two: Thomas Drake|date=9 June 2013|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a September 2013 interview, Drake reaffirmed his belief that the problems of the NSA are so chronic and systemic that the only solution would be to completely dismantle and subsequently rebuild the entire organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vocativ.com/09-2013/should-the-nsa-be-dismantled-an-interview-with-whistle-blower-thomas-drake/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 19, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055135/http://www.vocativ.com/09-2013/should-the-nsa-be-dismantled-an-interview-with-whistle-blower-thomas-drake/ |archivedate=September 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 3, 2014, Drake along with former Technical Director of the NSA [[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]] gave testimony to the [[German Parliamentary Committee investigating the NSA spying scandal]]. He described the close cooperation between the NSA and the German secret service [[Bundesnachrichtendienst|BND]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/thomas-drake-im-nsa-untersuchungsausschuss-13027055.html Bundesnachrichtendienst "ein Wurmfortsatz der NSA"], FAZ July 4, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/ex-nsa-mitarbeiter-drake-bnd-unterstuetzte-drohnenkrieg-der-usa-a-979130.html|title=Ex-NSA-Mitarbeiter Drake: BND unterstützte Drohnenkrieg der USA|date=4 July 2014|work=Der Spiegel|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 10, 2015, Drake appeared on a [[PEN American Center]] panel at the [[Newseum]] about "Secret Sources: Whistleblowers, National Security and Free Expression."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Secret Sources: Whistleblowers, National Security, and Free Expression |url=http://www.pen.org/event/2015/10/22/secret-sources-whistleblowers-national-security-and-free-expression|publisher=PEN American Center|accessdate=2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Espionage Act and whistleblowing ==
Drake is one of four individuals in the history of the United States who has been charged specifically with "willful retention" of "national defense" information under {{uscsub|18|793|e}}. Most prosecutions are for "delivery" of classified information to a third party—something that Drake was not charged with. This particular portion of the [[Espionage Act of 1917|Espionage Act]] was created in 1950 during the [[Second Red Scare]], as part of the [[McCarran Internal Security Act]].&lt;ref name=shane1 /&gt; [[Anthony Russo (whistleblower)|Anthony Russo]] and [[Daniel Ellsberg]] were the first to be prosecuted for the "retention" of what came to be known as the [[Pentagon Papers]], which Ellsberg gave to the ''New York Times'', eventually resulting in another landmark Espionage Act case in 1971, ''[[New York Times Co. v. United States]]''. The prosecution of Russo and Ellsberg was dismissed in 1972 because of government misconduct. The second prosecution was of [[Samuel Loring Morison]] in 1985, a Navy analyst who sold satellite photographs to ''[[Jane's Defense Weekly]]''; he was later pardoned by President [[Bill Clinton]]. The third was the [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee]] case in 2005, ''[[United States v. Franklin, Rosen, and Weissman]]''.&lt;ref name=shane3 /&gt;

==Founding member of the Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity==

Drake is a founding member of the [[Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity]].&lt;ref name=AndyWorthington2015-09-15/&gt;
In September 2015, Drake and 27 other members of VIPS steering group wrote a letter to the President challenging a recently published book, that claimed to rebut the report of the [[United States]] [[United States Senate Intelligence Committee|Senate Intelligence Committee]] on the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s use of torture.

== Related media works ==
In 2014, a documentary called ''Silenced'', in which Drake was featured, was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Silenced 2014|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2827908/?ref_=ttrel_rel_tt|website=IMDB|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=screenings schedule|url=http://silencedfilm.com/screenings/|website=Silence Documentary Film|publisher=Reframed Pictures, James Spione, et al|accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was nominated for an Emmy Award in 2016. Having an analogous theme as the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Oscar]]-winning documentary ''[[Citizenfour]]'', which portrays similar treatment of [[Edward Snowden]], ''Silenced'' has been the official selection and recipient of several awards from multiple [[film festival]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Silenced: A James Spione whistleblower documentary|url=http://silencedfilm.com/|website=Silenced Film 2014|publisher=Reframed Pictures, James Spione, et al|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; even before its release to major cable networks in March 2015.

Also in 2014, Drake's involvement with Thinthread, his subsequent indictment, etc., along with others associated with his activities (Roark, Binney, Wiebe, Loomis), and Snowden were featured in a PBS documentary, "United States of Secrets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PBS Frontline, "United States of Secrets "|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/united-states-of-secrets/|accessdate=23 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drake is featured throughout the 2016 documentary ''[[Nothing to Hide (2016 film)|Nothing to Hide]]'', regarding [[government surveillance]] and [[internet privacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nothing To Hide 2016|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7330532/|website=IMDB|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is consistent with the reference quoted. I suspect that someone originally misquoted "severe" as "several" which then got rephrased to "series of" when "severe" would have been correct.</comment>

'''Tom Bell''' (1825 – October 4, 1856) was a western outlaw and physician known as the "Outlaw Doc".  He is the first [[outlaw]] to organize a [[stagecoach]] [[robbery]] in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Biography==
Born '''Thomas J. Hodges''' in [[Rome, Tennessee]], he saw action in the [[Mexican–American War]] as a surgeon. Following the war he traveled to California during the [[California Gold Rush]] but was unsuccessful as a prospector, later drifting around California as a gambler and as a doctor at times for several years. The outlaw "Doc Hedges" was arrested for stealing five mules. When he was arrested in 1855, wanting to confuse the peace officers, he gave the name Tom Bell, a small time cattle rustler. In 1855 he was serving time in [[Angel Island (California)|Angel Island]] Prison for robbery when he met [[Bill Gristy]] and successfully escaped several weeks later. He escaped with the help of his profession as a doctor by faking a severe illness that fooled the prison doctor, which allowed him to escape. With Gristy, Bell formed an outlaw [[List of Old West gangs|gang]] of five men and began robbing stages for several months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thetahoeweekly.com/2013/06/sierra-stories/|title=Death knell for Tom Bell - Tahoe Weekly|date=2013-06-05|work=Tahoe Weekly|access-date=2017-11-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 12, 1856, after their spy spotted the Camptonville-Maryville stage carrying $100,000 worth of gold bullion, the gang unsuccessfully attempted to rob it. In an exchange of gunfire a woman passenger was killed and two male passengers were wounded before the gang was driven off by the stagecoach guards. The woman passenger on board who was killed by the attempt, was a black woman by the name of Mrs. Tilghman, the wife of a popular barber from Maryville.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GALEv2uoSJkC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=Mrs.+Tilghman+Marysville&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OL_fCNnLVt&amp;sig=CJBlmoRVS0E6shd4zo0KiQR3Chg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6b7jTY3jE4y4sQPLrpQW&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Mrs.%20Tilghman%20Marysville&amp;f=false|title=Blacks in Gold Rush California|last=Lapp|first=Rudolph M.|date=1977|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300065450|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The robbery and death of the woman passenger angered citizens, and both a sheriff's [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse]] and [[vigilance committee|citizen vigilantes]] conducted a massive search for the gang. By late September Gristy was captured. Under threat of being turned over to the irate [[Lynching|lynch mob]] outside the jail, he confessed the location of Bell. The [[Stockton, California|Stockton]] Sheriff raced to arrest him. When he found Bell near [[Firebaugh, California#History|Firebaugh's Ferry]] on October 4, 1856, an impromptu posse commanded by Judge [[George Gordon Belt]], a [[Merced River]] rancher, had already hanged him.

Despite the lack of success Bell had in his attempted [[stagecoach]] robbery, his example was soon followed by other outlaws with more success.

In a 2006 interview, Petty said he knew he wanted to be in a band the moment he saw the [[the Beatles|Beatles]] on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tom Petty Knows 'How It Feels'|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18580517|work=[[Fresh Air]]|publisher=NPR|date=July 27, 2006|access-date=April 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The minute I saw the Beatles on the ''Ed Sullivan Show''—and it's true of thousands of guys—there was the way out. There was the way to do it. You get your friends and you're a self-contained unit. And you make the music. And it looked like so much fun. It was something I identified with. I had never been hugely into sports.&amp;nbsp;... I had been a big fan of Elvis. But I really saw in the Beatles that here's something I could do. I knew I could do it. It wasn't long before there were groups springing up in garages all over the place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Crandall |first=Bill |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/10-musicians-who-saw-the-beatles-standing-there/ |title=10 Musicians Who Saw the Beatles Standing There |publisher=CBS News |date=February 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He dropped out of high school at age 17 to play bass with his newly formed band.&lt;ref name=biography.com /&gt;

In an interview with the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] in 2014, Petty stated that the [[the Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] were "my punk music".&lt;ref name="RollingStone14"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/tom-petty-rolling-stones-were-my-punk-music-20140717|title=Tom Petty: Rolling Stones Were 'My Punk Music'|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=October 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He credited the group with inspiring him by demonstrating that he and musicians like him could make it in rock and roll.&lt;ref name="RollingStone14" /&gt;

Petty also overcame a difficult relationship with his father, who found it hard to accept that his son was "a mild-mannered kid who was interested in the arts" and subjected him to verbal and physical abuse on a regular basis.

==Career==
===1976–1987: Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers===
{{main|Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers}}
Shortly after embracing his musical aspirations, Petty started a band known as the Epics, later to evolve into [[Mudcrutch]]. The band included future Heartbreakers [[Mike Campbell (musician)|Mike Campbell]] and [[Benmont Tench]] and was popular in Gainesville, but their recordings went unnoticed by a mainstream audience. Their only single, "Depot Street", released in 1975 by [[Shelter Records]], failed to chart.&lt;ref name="mudcrutch1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenberg|first1=Rudi|title=Tom Petty Turned Back the Clock with Mudcrutch at the 9:30 Club in D.C. on June 6|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2016/06/07/tom-petty-turned-back-the-clock-with-mudcrutch-at-the-930-club-in-d-c-on-june-6|website=The Washington Post|access-date=October 3, 2017|date=June 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Mudcrutch split up, Petty reluctantly agreed to pursue a solo career. Tench decided to form his own group, whose sound Petty appreciated. Eventually, Petty and Campbell collaborated with Tench, [[Ron Blair]] and [[Stan Lynch]], forming the first lineup of the Heartbreakers. Their [[Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers (album)|eponymous debut album]] gained minute popularity amongst American audiences, achieving greater success in Britain. The single "[[Breakdown (Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers song)|Breakdown]]" was re-released in 1977, and peaked at {{Numero|40}} in early 1978 after the band toured in the United Kingdom in support of [[Nils Lofgren]]. The debut album was released by [[Shelter Records]], which at that time was distributed by [[ABC Records]].&lt;ref name="all music"&gt;{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|title=Tom Petty: Biography|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5137/biography|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=AllMusic|year=2006|access-date=April 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers 1977.jpg|thumb|left|Petty (''center'') with the Heartbreakers in 1977]]
Their second album, ''[[You're Gonna Get It!]]'', was the band's first [[Top 40]] album,&lt;ref name="all music" /&gt; featuring the singles "[[I Need to Know (Tom Petty song)|I Need to Know]]" and "[[Listen to Her Heart]]". Their third album, ''[[Damn the Torpedoes (album)|Damn the Torpedoes]]'', quickly went [[RIAA certification|platinum]], selling nearly two million copies; it includes their breakthrough singles "[[Don't Do Me Like That]]", "[[Here Comes My Girl]]" and "[[Refugee (Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers song)|Refugee]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers: History of the Band|url=http://www.mudcrutch.com/index.php?pageid=heartbreakers_history|work=Mudcrutch Farm|access-date=April 12, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415150228/http://www.mudcrutch.com/index.php?pageid=heartbreakers_history|archivedate=April 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1979, [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]] performed at a [[Musicians United for Safe Energy]] concert at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Finn|first=Natalie|title=Raitt, Browne &amp; Nash Rerock Against Nukes|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=08ca35ba-fcf8-4e5d-89a3-db9ecaf79907|publisher=E!|date=October 23, 2007|access-date=April 12, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530083723/http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=08ca35ba-fcf8-4e5d-89a3-db9ecaf79907|archivedate=May 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their rendition of "[[Cry to Me]]" was featured on the resulting album, ''[[No Nukes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|title=''No Nukes'': Overview|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r315362|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=April 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 4th album ''[[Hard Promises]]'', released in 1981, became a top-ten hit, going platinum and spawning the hit single "[[The Waiting (song)|The Waiting]]". The album also featured Petty's first duet, "Insider" with [[Stevie Nicks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beviglia|first1=Jim|title=Behind The Song: Stevie Nicks with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers|url=http://americansongwriter.com/2016/02/behind-the-song-stevie-nicks-with-tom-petty-and-the-heartbreakers/|website=American Songwriter|access-date=October 3, 2017|date=February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bass player [[Ron Blair]] quit the group and was replaced on the fifth album, ''[[Long After Dark]]'' (1982), by [[Howie Epstein]]; the resulting lineup lasted until 1994. In 1985, the band participated in [[Live Aid]], playing four songs at [[John F. Kennedy Stadium]], in [[Philadelphia]]. ''[[Southern Accents]]'' was also released in 1985. This album included the hit single "[[Don't Come Around Here No More]]", which was produced by [[David A. Stewart|Dave Stewart]]. The song's video featured Petty dressed as the [[Hatter (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Mad Hatter]], mocking and chasing Alice from the book ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', then cutting and eating her as if she were a cake. The ensuing tour led to the live album ''[[Pack Up the Plantation: Live!]]'' and an invitation from [[Bob Dylan]]—Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers joined him on his [[True Confessions Tour]]. They also played some dates with the [[Grateful Dead]] in 1986 and 1987. Also in 1987, the group released ''[[Let Me Up (I've Had Enough)]]'' which includes "[[Jammin' Me]]" which Petty wrote with Dylan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jammin' Me: Review | url={{Allmusic|class=song|id=t2462926|pure_url=yes}} | publisher=AllMusic|access-date=April 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1988–1991: Traveling Wilburys and solo career===
{{Main|Traveling Wilburys|Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers}}
In 1988, Petty joined [[George Harrison]]'s group, the [[Traveling Wilburys]], which also included [[Bob Dylan]], [[Roy Orbison]], and [[Jeff Lynne]]. The band's first song, "[[Handle with Care (song)|Handle with Care]]", was intended as a B-side of one of Harrison's singles, but was judged too good for that purpose and the group decided to record a full album, ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1]]''. A second Wilburys album, mischievously titled ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3]]'' and recorded without the recently deceased Orbison, followed in 1990. The album was named ''Vol. 3'' as a response to a series of bootlegged studio sessions being sold as ''Travelling Wilburys Vol. 2''. Petty incorporated Traveling Wilburys songs into his live shows, consistently playing "Handle with Care" in shows from 2003 to 2006, and for his 2008 tour adding "surprises" such as "[[End of the Line (Traveling Wilburys song)|End of the Line]]" to the set list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graff|first1=Gary|title=Tom Petty / May 31, 2008 / Auburn Hills, Mich.

In 1989, Petty released ''[[Full Moon Fever]]'', which featured hits "[[I Won't Back Down]]", "[[Free Fallin']]" and "[[Runnin' Down a Dream]]". It was nominally his first solo album, although several Heartbreakers and other well-known musicians participated: [[Mike Campbell (musician)|Mike Campbell]] co-produced the album with Petty and Jeff Lynne of [[Electric Light Orchestra]], and backing musicians included Campbell, Lynne, and fellow Wilburys Roy Orbison and George Harrison ([[Ringo Starr]] appears on drums in the video for "[[I Won't Back Down]]", but they were actually performed by Phil Jones).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Readers' Poll: Tom Petty's 10 Best Songs|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/readers-poll-tom-pettys-10-best-songs-20130619/5-i-wont-back-down-0964154|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=October 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petty and the Heartbreakers reformed in 1991 and released ''[[Into the Great Wide Open]]'', which was co-produced by Lynne and included the hit singles "[[Learning to Fly (Tom Petty song)|Learning To Fly]]" and "[[Into the Great Wide Open (song)|Into the Great Wide Open]]", the latter featuring [[Johnny Depp]] and [[Faye Dunaway]] in the music video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patridge|first1=Kenneth|title=Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' 'Into the Great Wide Open' at 25: Classic Track-by-Track Album Lookback|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7423932/tom-petty-heartbreakers-into-the-great-wide-open-25-years|website=Billboard|access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before leaving MCA Records, Petty and the Heartbreakers got together to record, live in the studio, two new songs for a ''[[Greatest Hits (Tom Petty album)|Greatest Hits]]'' package: "[[Mary Jane's Last Dance]]" and [[Thunderclap Newman]]'s "[[Something in the Air (song)|Something in the Air]]". This was Stan Lynch's last recorded performance with the Heartbreakers. Petty commented "He left right after the session without really saying goodbye." The package went on to sell over ten million copies, therefore receiving [[RIAA certification|diamond certification by the RIAA]].&lt;ref name="gpawards"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gold &amp; Platinum – Tom Petty|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&amp;se=tom+petty#search_section|publisher=RIAA|access-date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1991–2017: Move to Warner Bros. Records===
In 1989, while still under contract to MCA, Petty secretly signed a lucrative deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]], to which the Traveling Wilburys had been signed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Philips |first=Chuck |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-04-05/entertainment/ca-575_1_tom-petty |title=Petty's Secret Deal Isn't for Petty Cash |work=Los Angeles Times |date=April 5, 1992 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first album on his new label, 1994's ''[[Wildflowers (Tom Petty album)|Wildflowers]]'' (Petty's second of three solo albums), included the singles "[[You Don't Know How It Feels]]", "You Wreck Me", "It's Good to Be King", and "A Higher Place". The album, produced by [[Rick Rubin]], sold over three million copies in the United States.&lt;ref name="gpawards" /&gt;

In 1996, Petty, with the Heartbreakers, released a soundtrack to the movie ''[[She's the One (1996 film)|She's the One]]'', starring [[Cameron Diaz]] and [[Jennifer Aniston]] (see ''[[Songs and Music from "She's the One"]]''). The album's singles were "Walls (Circus)" (featuring [[Lindsey Buckingham]]), "Climb that Hill", and a song written by [[Lucinda Williams]], "Change the Locks". The album also included a cover of "Asshole", a song by [[Beck]]. The same year, the band accompanied [[Johnny Cash]] on ''[[Unchained (Johnny Cash album)|Unchained]]'' (provisionally entitled "Petty Cash"), for which Cash would win a [[Grammy]] for [[Best Country Album]] (Cash would later cover Petty's "[[I Won't Back Down]]" on ''[[American III: Solitary Man]]'').&lt;ref name="uncutpettycash"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tom Petty: From the Unchained Sessions to 'I Won't Back Down' – Uncut|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/features/tom-petty-from-the-unchained-sessions-to-i-won-t-back-down-37575|website=Uncut|access-date=October 3, 2017|date=February 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acting===
Petty's first appearance in film took place in 1978, when he had a cameo in ''[[FM (film)|FM]]''.&lt;ref name="forbes100217"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonthompson/2017/10/02/tom-petty-his-legacy-in-film-and-tv/|work=Forbes|title=Tom Petty: His Legacy In Film And TV|first=Simon|last=Thompson|date=October 2, 2017|access-date=October 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later had a small part in 1987's ''[[Made in Heaven (1987 film)|Made in Heaven]]'' and appeared in several episodes of ''[[It's Garry Shandling's Show]]'' between 1987 and 1990, playing himself as one of [[Garry Shandling]]'s neighbors.&lt;ref name="forbes100217" /&gt; Petty was also featured in Shandling's other show, ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'', as one of the [[Story within a story]] final guests. In the episode, Petty gets bumped from the show and nearly comes to blows with [[Greg Kinnear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://tv.avclub.com/10-episodes-that-made-the-larry-sanders-show-one-of-the-1798236590|agency=The AV Club|title=10 episodes that made The Larry Sanders Show one of the best comedies of the ’90s|first=Kyle|last=Ryan|access-date=October 3, 2017|date=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petty appeared in the 1997 film ''[[The Postman (film)|The Postman]]'', directed by and starring [[Kevin Costner]], as the Bridge City Mayor (from the dialogue it is implied that he is playing a [[future history]] version of himself).&lt;ref name="forbes100217" /&gt; In 2002, he appeared on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' in the episode "[[How I Spent My Strummer Vacation]]", along with [[Mick Jagger]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[Elvis Costello]], and [[Brian Setzer]]. In it, Petty spoofed himself as a [[tutor]] to [[Homer Simpson]] on the art of lyric writing, composing a brief song about a drunk girl driving down the road while concerned with the state of public schools. Later in the episode, he loses a toe during a riot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/4966372/tom-petty-simpsons-cameo/|work=Time|date=October 2, 2017|access-date=October 3, 2017|title=Tom Petty's Simpson Cameo Perfectly Captured the Thinking Rock Star's Dilemma|first=Cady|last=Lang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petty had a recurring role as the voice of [[List of characters in King of the Hill#Other Hill and Platter relatives|Elroy "Lucky" Kleinschmidt]] in the animated comedy series ''[[King of the Hill]]'' from 2004 to 2009.&lt;ref name="forbes100217" /&gt; In 2010, Petty made a five-second [[cameo appearance|cameo]] appearance with comedian [[Andy Samberg]] in a musical video titled "Great Day" featured on the bonus DVD as part of [[The Lonely Island]]'s new album ''[[Turtleneck &amp; Chain]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisisinsider.com/10-best-songs-by-the-lonely-island-2016-5|work=INSIDER|title=RANKED: The 13 best songs by The Lonely Island|first=Ian|last=Phillips|date=June 2, 2016|access-date=October 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on artistic control==
Petty was known as a staunch guardian of his [[artistic control]] and [[artistic freedom]]. In 1979, he was involved in a legal dispute when [[ABC Records]] was sold to [[MCA Records]]. He refused to be transferred to another record label without his consent. In May 1979, he filed for bankruptcy and was signed to the new MCA subsidiary [[Backstreet Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Runnin' Down a Dream: Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers|first=Tom|last=Petty|year=2007|publisher=Chronicle Books|p=79|isbn=978-0-811-86201-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1981, the upcoming Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers album, which would become ''[[Hard Promises]]'', was slated to be the next MCA release with the new list price of $9.98, following [[Steely Dan]]'s ''[[Gaucho (album)|Gaucho]]'' and the [[Olivia Newton-John]]/[[Electric Light Orchestra]] ''[[Xanadu (soundtrack)|Xanadu]]'' soundtrack. This so-called "superstar pricing" was $1.00 more than the usual list price of $8.98.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Goldstein |first=Patrick |title=Petty Battling MCA Over Record Price Hike |work=Los Angeles Times |date=February 1, 1981 |page=N72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petty voiced his objections to the price hike in the press and the issue became a popular cause among music fans. Non-delivery of the album and naming it ''Eight Ninety-Eight'' were considered, but eventually MCA decided against the price increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Marsh |first=Dave |title=Tom Petty |work=Musician |date=July 1981 |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Petty sued tire company [[Goodrich Corporation|B.F. Goodrich]] for $1&amp;nbsp;million for using a song very similar to his song "Mary's New Car" in a TV commercial. The ad agency that produced the commercial had previously sought permission to use Petty's song but was refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Goldstein |first=Patrick |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-03-08/entertainment/ca-13300_1_tom-petty |title=B.f.

Some have claimed that the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] single "[[Dani California]]", released in May 2006, is very similar to Petty's "[[Mary Jane's Last Dance]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wgmd.com/newspost/fullnews.php?id=1142 |title=WGMD |publisher=[[WGMD]] |date=September 8, 2006 |access-date=January 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825150814/http://www.wgmd.com/newspost/fullnews.php?id=1142 |archivedate=August 25, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/31/104324.php |title=Red Hot Chili Peppers Accused of Plagiarism |date=May 31, 2006 |publisher=BC Magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613063323/http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/31/104324.php |archivedate=June 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petty told ''[[Rolling Stone]] Magazine'', "I seriously doubt that there is any negative intent there. And a lot of rock 'n' roll songs sound alike. Ask [[Chuck Berry]]. [[The Strokes]] took '[[American Girl (Tom Petty song)|American Girl]]' for their song '[[Last Nite]]', and I saw an interview with them where they actually admitted it. That made me laugh out loud. I was like, 'OK, good for you' ... If someone took my song note for note and stole it maliciously, then maybe &lt;nowiki&gt;[I'd sue]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. But I don't believe in lawsuits much. I think there are enough [[frivolous lawsuit]]s in this country without people fighting over pop songs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Neil |last=Strauss|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10698880/tom_pettys_last_dance/4 |title=''Rolling Stone'' Interview, 2006 |work=Rolling Stone |date=June 30, 2006 |access-date=January 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, it was revealed that Petty and [[Jeff Lynne]] would receive royalties from [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]]'s song "[[Stay with Me (Sam Smith song)|Stay with Me]]" after its writers acknowledged similarities between it and "[[I Won't Back Down]]". Petty and co-composer Lynne were awarded 12.5% of the royalties from "Stay with Me", and their names were added to the [[ASCAP]] song credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/01/tom-petty-awarded-songwriting-royalties-for-sam-smiths-stay-with-me/|title=Update: Tom Petty awarded songwriting royalties for Sam Smith's "Stay With Me"|work=Consequence of Sound|access-date=August 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petty clarified that he did not believe Smith plagiarized him, saying, "All my years of songwriting have shown me these things can happen. Most times you catch it before it gets out the studio door but in this case it got by. Sam's people were very understanding of our predicament and we easily came to an agreement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kreps|first1=Daniel|title=Tom Petty on Sam Smith Settlement: 'No Hard Feelings.

==Personal life==
Petty married Jane Benyo in 1974, and they divorced in 1996.&lt;ref name=biography.com /&gt; Benyo once told mutual friend [[Stevie Nicks]] that she had met Petty at "the age of seventeen".

In May 1987, an [[arson]]ist set fire to Petty's house in [[Encino, California]]. Firefighters were able to salvage the basement [[recording studio]] and the original tapes stored there, as well as his [[Gibson Dove]] acoustic guitar. His signature gray [[top hat]], however, was destroyed.

On January 19, 2018, the [[Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner]] announced that Petty had died accidentally from mixed drug toxicity,&lt;ref name="codrs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tom Petty's Cause of Death: Accidental Overdose|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/tom-pettys-cause-of-death-accidental-overdose-w515472|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=January 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a combination of [[fentanyl]], [[oxycodone]], [[acetylfentanyl]] and despropionyl fentanyl (all [[opioids]]); [[temazepam]] and [[alprazolam]] (both [[sedatives]]); and [[citalopram]] (an antidepressant).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/19/health/tom-petty-cause-of-death/index.html |title=Tom Petty died of accidental drug overdose, medical examiner says |publisher=CNN|date=January 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement on his official website, Petty's wife and daughter said he had multiple medical problems, including [[emphysema]], knee difficulties "and most significantly a [[hip fracture|fractured hip]]". He was prescribed pain medication for these issues and informed on the day of his death that his fractured hip had graduated to a full break. The statement read, "[it] is our feeling that the pain was simply unbearable and was the cause for his over use of medication.[..] We feel confident that this was, as the coroner found, an unfortunate accident".&lt;ref name="famstat"&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement|url=http://www.tompetty.com/statement|website=TomPetty.com Official Website|accessdate=January 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 28, 2018, four days before the first anniversary of his death, Petty's wife Dana gave an interview to ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]'' about her husband's death saying that Petty put off hip surgery his doctors had recommended for some time. "He would do anything to help anyone – his bandmates, the crew, the fans – and that's why he did the last tour with a fractured hip. He was adamant. He found out a few days before the tour was gonna start – and that he had emphysema." Dana said that he was relying on drugs on the road to keep his hip pain under control but was looking forward to not needing them anymore. "That's why he wouldn't go to the hospital when his hip broke. He'd had it in mind it was his last tour and he owed it to his long-time crew, from decades some of them, and his fans." Dana said that Petty was in a good mood the day before his death, excited about the future saying, "He had those three shows in L.A. and the day before he died he was pounding his chest going, 'I'm on top of the world!' Never had he been so proud of himself, so happy, so looking forward to the future – and then he's gone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8477364/tom-petty-box-set-interview |title=Tom Petty's Widow and Bandmates Reflect on His Unreleased Material - And What's Next |publisher=Billboard|date= September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==
Petty owned and used a number of guitars over the years. From 1976 to 1982, his main instrument was a sunburst 1964 [[Fender Stratocaster]]. He also used a number of [[Rickenbacker]] guitars from 1979 onward, notably a 1965 Rose Morris 1993 and 1987 reissue of the Rose Morris 1997,{{clarify|date=October 2017|reason=What do these dates mean?}} a 1967 [[Rickenbacker 360/12|360/12]] and 1989 660/12TP. The Rickenbacker 660/12TP was designed by Petty (specifically the neck) and featured his signature from 1991 to 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ed |last=Roman |url=http://www.celebrityrockstarguitars.com/rock/petty.htm |title=Tom Petty Guitars |publisher=Celebrityrockstarguitars.com |access-date=January 27, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919093952/http://celebrityrockstarguitars.com/rock/petty.htm |archive-date=September 19, 2010 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For acoustic guitars, Petty had a signature [[C. F. Martin &amp; Company|C.F. Martin]] HD-40, and wrote virtually all of his songs on a [[Gibson Dove]] acoustic saved from his 1987 house fire. He also used a [[Gibson J-200]] in a natural finish and a late 1970s [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild]] D25 12-string acoustic.

Petty's later amplifier setup featured two [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] Vibro-King 60-watt combos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guitaredge.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=107:backstage-pass-tom-petty&amp;catid=48:backstage-pass&amp;Itemid=69 |title=Backstage Pass: Tom Petty |publisher=Guitaredge.com |access-date=January 27, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007124016/http://www.guitaredge.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=107:backstage-pass-tom-petty&amp;catid=48:backstage-pass&amp;Itemid=69 |archivedate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other political activity==
In March 2018, inspired by several high school and college students (some from out-of-state) running for [[Governor of Kansas|Governor]] of [[Kansas]] in the [[Kansas gubernatorial election, 2018|midterm election]], Supreme stated that "I certainly did not want to draw away any votes from any teenagers running in the Governor’s race," instead opting to run for [[Kansas Attorney General|Attorney General]], becoming the sole challenger to incumbent Republican [[Derek Schmidt]]. The lack of requirements in order to run for office, as outlined in the state's [[Wyandotte Constitution|Constitution]], has been heralded by Supreme: "This is indeed a very interesting and attractive loophole,” he said. “I think that’s a very good thing for democracy."

'''Willem de Waal''' (born 17 February 1978 in [[Paarl]], [[South Africa]]) is a South African [[rugby union]] footballer who is currently playing for [[Benetton Rugby|Benetton Treviso]] in the [[Pro14]] competition. He plays in the position of fly-half. Like [[Joost van der Westhuizen]] at scrum-half, de Waal is unusually big for a fly-half.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Career==
De Waal played rugby for [[Stellenbosch University]] before making his provincial debut with the [[Leopards (rugby team)|Leopards]] in 2002. He then moved to the [[Free State Cheetahs]] in 2004 where he would experience his greatest success so far. In each of his four seasons at the club, the Cheetahs made it to the final of the [[Currie Cup]], winning twice and sharing one.

De Waal has also played at [[Super Rugby]] level, making his debut with the [[Bulls (rugby)|Bulls]] in 2004 before joining the [[Cats (rugby club)|Cats]] in 2005. When the competition expanded to 14 teams in [[2006 Super 14 season|2006]], the Cats split into two separate franchises – the [[Lions (Super rugby franchise)|Lions]] and the [[Cheetahs (rugby union)|Cheetahs]], which de Waal joined.

On 24 July 2007, it was announced that de Waal signed a two-year deal with French [[Pro D2|Second Division]] club [[RC Narbonne]]. He returned to [[South Africa]] after one season and secured a spot in the 2009 [[Stormers]] squad, his fourth different super rugby team. He also played in the Currie Cup for [[Western Province (rugby team)|Western Province]] that same season.

'''Raymond Wong Yuk-man''' ({{zh|t=黃毓民}}; born 1 October 1951) is a Hong Kong politician, author, current affairs commentator and radio host. He is a former member of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] (LegCo), representing the [[geographical constituency]] of [[Kowloon West (constituency)|Kowloon West]]. He worked in [[Commercial Radio Hong Kong]] and hosted many popular phone-in programmes.

He was the head of Department in the Faculty of Communication and Journalism of [[Chu Hai College]] in [[Tsuen Wan]], Hong Kong, which he also hold a [[Master's degree|Master]] degree in history in there. He is a [[Radical democracy|radical]] [[populism|populist]] and a former chairman of the [[League of Social Democrats]] (LSD). He is known for his outspoken manners, his harsh criticism of the [[Chinese Government]], and his ferocious speeches in defence of the rights of the [[lower classes]]; consequently, he has been given the nicknames ''Mad Dog'' ({{linktext|癲|狗}}) and "Rogue Professor" ({{linktext|流氓|教授}}).&lt;ref name="stan1"&gt;The Standard HK. "[http://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking_news_detail.asp?id=7898&amp;icid=3&amp;d_str=20081015 The Standard.com]." ''Three lawmakers ejected from legislature.'' Retrieved on 5 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He currently hosts "Wong Yuk-man Channel," a popular radio programme on [[MyRadio]], which is a Hong Kong-based internet radio station founded in 2007, and as well as [[Proletariat Political Institute]].

==Early life, publishing venture and talk shows==
Wong was born in 1 October 1951 in British Hong Kong with the family root of [[Lukfung]], [[Kwangtung]]. Wong's father was a close friend of Heung Chin, a general of [[Kuomintang|Nationalist Party of China]] and founder of the [[Sun Yee On]] , one of the leading [[triad (underground society)|triads]] in Hong Kong. He was under the patronage of the Heung family and was sent aboard to study in Taiwan. After he graduated from the Taiwan-affiliated [[Chu Hai College]] with a master's degree in history, Wong worked as a journalist and taught at Chu Hai College.&lt;ref name="bite"/&gt;

He first made his name in the early 1990s when he co-hosted [[Asia Television]]'s controversial and hugely popular political commentary programme ''News Tease''. He savaged [[pro-Beijing camp|pro-Beijing]] politicians until the show was axed after 64 episodes in 1994, allegedly under pressure from the mainland authorities.&lt;ref name="bite"&gt;{{cite news|title=People Power feels 'Mad Dog' Wong Yuk-man's bite|date=22 May 2013|newspaper=South China Morning Post|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1242982/people-power-feels-mad-dog-wong-yuk-mans-bite}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Wong used his entire savings - HK$500,000 - to launch ''News File'' magazine, but it closed down within two years and left him heavily in debt.&lt;ref name="bite"/&gt; On 18 March 1996, he established ''Mad Dog Daily'', a tabloid with a clear "Anti-communism" and "Anti-[[Tung Chee Hwa|Tung]]" stance. However, the paper suffered from a low sales volume, which Wong jokingly blamed on its "journalistic integrity" and refusal to participate in [[Yellow journalism|sensationalist journalism]].&lt;ref&gt;YouTube video of show by Wong Yuk-man https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TJXeONGdms&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Asian financial crisis]], it transformed into a magazine in October 1997, and then was suspended shortly afterwards. As a result, Wong had to bear debts that amounted to a total of 15&amp;nbsp;million HKD. He repaid this debt in a matter of years by working on talk shows and other TV programmes.

In 2000, Wong established "CyberHK", an [[Information technology|IT]] company that was also unsuccessful, falling victim to the [[dot-com bubble]] of 2001 and putting Wong into debt again. To settle the debts, Wong concentrated on his radio talk shows, writing articles for newspapers, and running his beef noodle restaurant. His popularity hit a peak by hosting two weekly shows for [[Commercial Radio Hong Kong]]; had three weekly slots on [[Radio Television Hong Kong]], both on television and radio; and appeared on prime-time TV at least once a week.&lt;ref name="bite"/&gt;

In 2003, Wong converted to Christianity during the [[SARS epidemic]] in Hong Kong. He was attracted to [[liberation theology]] after his contact with the least-privileged in society during the crisis. He was active in mobilising support for the [[Hong Kong 1 July marches]].

In 2004, he took a sabbatical from his talk show "Close Encounters of a Political Kind", after being beaten up by gangsters allegedly paid by the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Government]], citing "political pressure". Following a self-imposed three-month exile in Canada, he returned to Hong Kong where he was sacked from his weeknight political phone-in radio programme, and moved to a late Saturday night slot (with significantly fewer listeners).  In less than a year, the programme was cancelled and Wong was effectively and controversially taken off-air.  This event was significant for Hong Kong as it meant that there was no longer any outspoken and critical radio talk show host on any Hong Kong radio station.  During his time off-air, he continued to run his beef noodle restaurant in [[Mongkok]].

==Political career==

===Founding of League of Social Democrats===
In 2006, he co-founded the [[League of Social Democrats]], a self-described [[social democratic]] [[List of political parties in Hong Kong|political party]] which aimed to be a "clear-cut opposition party" and defend the interests of the grassroots. In 2007, he made a comeback to phone-in radio talk show, hosting a weekly political radio programme "Wong Yuk-man Channel" on [[MyRadio]]. The show quickly gained popularity and some videos of his broadcasts – captured by a studio camera and uploaded to YouTube – have become some of the most-watched videos in Hong Kong. "Wong Yuk-man Channel" has subsequently become a twice-weekly radio programme, now extended from one hour to 1½ hours. In 2008, he was appointed a trustee of the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]].

Wong Yuk-man refused to co-operate with the other [[pan-democracy camp|pan-democratic parties]] [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Civic Party]] and strongly criticised the two parties for nominating [[Alan Leong]] as Chief Executive candidate in the [[Hong Kong Chief Executive election, 2007|2007 election]], saying that they are not qualified as democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lsd.org.hk/index.php/doc/detail/1452|script-title=zh:社民連與民主公民兩黨割席|date=24 November 2006|newspaper=Sing Pao|language=Chinese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222143045/http://www.lsd.org.hk/index.php/doc/detail/1452|archivedate=22 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 2008|2008 Hong Kong Legislative election]], he ran in the [[Kowloon West (constituency)|Kowloon West constituency]] on a platform of "Without struggle there is no change". During the campaign he lambasted the Civic Party's [[Claudia Mo Man-ching]] in the same way he did the candidates from the pro-Beijing, pro-government flagship party, the [[Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong]] (DAB), accusing the Civic Party of applying double standards in its fight for democracy, and being elitist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Infighting threatens pro-democracy camp|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/651224/infighting-threatens-pro-democracy-camp|first=Chris|last=Yeung|date=3 September 2008|newspaper=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wong ultimately gained a seat in the Legislative Council with the second highest number of votes in his constituency. while Mo lost in the election.

===Legislative Council===

====Banana throwing incident====
Wong Yuk-man introduced a number of innovative actions to Hong Kong politics. On 15 October 2008, during [[Hong Kong Chief Executive]] [[Donald Tsang]]'s delivery of the Annual Policy Address, Wong and his colleagues [[Leung Kwok-hung]] and [[Albert Chan]] interrupted Tsang's speech and heckled.&lt;ref name="sing1"&gt;Singtao.com. "[http://edu.singtao.com/eng-s/liberal_details.asp?article_id=116&amp;catid=2 Singtao.com]." ''Challenging the system.'' Retrieved on 3 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Tsang suggested that the HK$625 a month (US$80) [[Old Age Allowance]] paid to all senior citizens aged 65 or above be raised to HK$1000 a month (US$130), but with a means test introduced. Wong believed that this turned what was a gesture of respect to elderly people into welfare and is disrespectful to old people. Wong interrupted Tsang's speech and threw a bunch of bananas at him.&lt;ref name="stan1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sing1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Earthtimes.org. "[http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/237102,hong-kong-leader-pelted-with-bananas-during-keynote-speech.html Earthtimes.org]." ''Hong Kong leader pelted with bananas during keynote speech .'' Retrieved on 5 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The three LSD members were ejected from the chamber for the act.&lt;ref name="stan1" /&gt;

The incident triggered much debate amongst scholars, commentators, fellow politicians, and the general public. The reception has been mixed&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|7zlqTOy3bHo|''Video1''}}. Retrieved on 5 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|6zZFR7s2Jz8|''Video2''}}. Retrieved on 5 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; with even some pro-democratic politicians condemning the attack. One of the most prominent figures in the pro-democratic camp, [[Anson Chan]], released a formal statement criticising the stunt.&lt;ref&gt;Yahoo.com. "[http://hk.news.yahoo.com/article/081019/4/8smi.html Hk.Yahoo.com]." ''Article.'' Retrieved on 5 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the elderly of Hong Kong poured onto the streets in a demonstration of mass support for Wong; some even urged him to do it again. Wong himself has claimed that this controversial move had been successful in raising awareness about the discussion of benefits for the elderly. Indeed, within a week the government raised the ''fruit money'' to HK$1000 a month and dropped the proposal for means testing.

====2009 Budget Report====
Wong caused another uproar when he attempted to snatch the 2009-10 Budget Report midway through reading by the Financial Secretary [[John Tsang|John Tsang Jun-Wah]], saying that it did not address any policies to help [[Working class|lower class]] and [[lower middle class]] citizens in the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|financial turmoil]]. Some LegCo members, including several members of the [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]], and the [[Pro-Beijing camp|pro-Beijing]] media together denounced Wong's actions as violent. Wong, however, stated that he did not cause any physical harm to anyone, nor was it his intention to do so. Demonstrators took to the streets in support of Wong and his actions.

Despite criticism, Wong commented that, in contrast to past attitudes, Hong Kong society was conservative and many people did not understand or appreciate his actions.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Yet he continued to gain support from a niche of the local population, especially those from the grass-roots, for his relatively radical approach.

=== "Five Constituencies Referendum" and the People Power===
{{Main|Hong Kong by-election, 2010}}
In late-2009 and early 2010, a debate ensued amidst the pro-democracy camp on a more radical approach towards gaining [[universal suffrage]]. An agreement was reached between the [[Civic Party]] and Wong's [[League of Social Democrats]] for five members of their representation in the Legislative Council to resign and participate in a by-election, to create a [[Five Constituencies Referendum|referendum]] on the implementation of universal suffrage by 2012. In January 2010, Wong, another four lawmakers, [[Albert Chan]], [[Tanya Chan]], [[Leung Kwok-hung]] and [[Alan Leong]] resigned and participated in the ensuing by-election.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/26/hong-kong-democracy-bid Hong Kong MPs quit in attempt to push Beijing towards direct elections]&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 May 2010, he was re-elected as a lawmaker in [[Hong Kong by-election, 2010|the by-election]],.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rthk.org.hk/rthk/news/englishnews/20100517/news_20100517_56_668722.htm Pro-democracy lawmakers win by-elections]&lt;/ref&gt;  The turn-out was only 17.7 percent of registered voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Media, Social Mobilisation and Mass Protests in Post-colonial Hong Kong: The Power of a Critical Event|first1=Francis L. F.|last1=Lee|first2=Joseph M.|last2=Chan|publisher=Routledge|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wong Yuk-man denounced the Democratic Party for negotiating with Beijing and voting for the reform package which he saw as "selling out democracy" and defecting to the [[Communist Party of China]]. LSD protesters attacked the Democratic Party in the following [[July 1 marches#2010|2010 July 1 march]].

In January 2010, Wong stepped down as Chairman of the LSD, handing the chairmanship to [[Andrew To Kwan-hang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wong Yuk-man hands league chairmanship to Andrew To|date=1 February 2010|first=Albert|last=Wong|newspaper=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, Wong and Albert Chan announced that they were resigning from the League of Social Democrats over differences with his successor Andrew To's leadership over what stance to take towards the Democratic Party after Wong Yuk-man's protege [[Edward Yum]] failed in passing a no-confidence motion against To.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PARTY LINE UPDATES: Democrats in Disarray|date=24 January 2011|first=Suzanne|last=Pepper|url=https://chinaelectionsblog.net/2011/01/24/party-line-updates-democrats-in-disarray/}}&lt;/ref&gt; As two of the party's three legislators, the move left the party and the remaining legislator, [[Leung Kwok-hung]] ('Long Hair'), in a difficult position.  Wong also said that factional fighting within the party has become so hostile that it was beyond his and Chan's ability to rectify the situation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rthk.org.hk/rthk/news/englishnews/news.htm?main&amp;20110123&amp;56&amp;729151 Wong Yuk-man, Albert Chan quit party], RTHK, 23 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; With Chan, he went on to launch [[People Power (Hong Kong)|People Power]], under which name he continued to sit in Legco.

In the [[July 1 marches#2011|2011 July 1 march]] after leading activists on a march from [[Wan Chai]] to [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], Wong Yuk-man and Albert Chan organised their supporters to break through a police cordon, occupied a major road in Central and scuffled with the police, bringing traffic to a standstill. Wong and Chan were later arrested for unlawful assembly. They were later convicted in April 2013. Eastern Court magistrate Joseph To Ho-shing accused Wong of being "untrustworthy" and lying in a bid to escape the charges. Wong called on his supporters to be "well-prepared for a long struggle" against the government and said he feared for the day when local courts would be "manipulated by the Communist Party."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mad Dog snarls at 'political trial'|first=Eddie|last=Luk|date=30 April 2013|newspaper=The Standard|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=133323&amp;con_type=3|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221220602/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=133323&amp;con_type=3|archivedate=21 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wong decided to challenge the Democratic Party in the [[Hong Kong local elections, 2011|2011 District Council elections]]. People Power put forward 62 candidates, many of whom ran in constituencies against Democratic Party candidates. The party won just one seat, in Fung Cheung, where the its candidate [[Johnny Mak Ip-sing]] did not face another candidate from the pro-democracy camp. Given the poor showing, Albert Chan admitted that the strategy had failed. Nevertheless, he insisted that the party would 'stay the course'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rthk.org.hk/rthk/news/elocal/news.htm?elocal&amp;20111109&amp;56&amp;796800 People Power admit election mistakes], RTHK, 9 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 May 2013, Wong Yuk-man announced his resignation from People Power. It was believed to be related to his earlier split with [[Stephen Shiu Yeuk-yuen]], the owner of the [[Hong Kong Reporter]] and People Power's financial support over the [[Occupy Central with Love and Peace|Occupy Central]] plan, which he strongly disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lawmaker Wong Yuk-man quits People Power|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1241918/lawmaker-wong-yuk-man-quits-people-power|date=20 May 2013|accessdate=20 May 2013|newspaper=South China Morning Post|first=Joshua|last=But}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turn to localism===
From 2013, Wong became increasingly sympathetic to the [[localism in Hong Kong|localist]] cause. Together with his protege [[Wong Yeung-tat]], they organised [[memorials for the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], as opposed to the main candlelight vigil held by pan-democrats' [[Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China]] (HKASPDMC), which they criticised it for having a Chinese nationalistic theme. They organised its alternative 4 June rally in [[Tsim Sha Tsui]]. The alternative event attracted 200 people in 2013 and 7,000 in 2014, compared with 180,000 and 150,000 respectively for the main event.&lt;ref&gt;Ip, Kelly; Phneah, Jeraldine; NectarGan (5 June 2013) [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=134342&amp;sid=39765760&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20130605&amp;isSearch=1&amp;sear_year=2013 "Undampened"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714232246/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=134342&amp;sid=39765760&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20130605&amp;isSearch=1&amp;sear_year=2013 |date=14 July 2014 }}.

===Glass throwing incident===
On 3 July 2014 during a Q&amp;A session of the Legislative Council, Wong was accused of intentionally hurting [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Leung Chun-ying]] by hurling a glass at him in a protest. Wong was charged of common assault. He claimed that he was first intentionally throwing papers towards a location where no one was standing, and he switched to throwing water only when there were not many documents left on the table. He said the glass was released accidentally as security guards were pulling him back. He was later convicted on 19 October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wong Yuk-man convicted of common assault for throwing glass at Hong Kong chief executive|date=19 October 2016|newspaper=South China Morning Post|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-crime/article/2029499/wong-yuk-man-convicted-common-assault-throwing-glass-hong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 September 2018, Wong Yuk-man's assault conviction for hurling glass at [[Leung Chun-ying]] is overturned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-lawmaker Wong Yuk-man’s assault conviction for hurling glass at former Hong Kong leader CY Leung is overturned|date=27 September 2018|newspaper=South China Morning Post|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/2166041/ex-lawmaker-wong-yuk-mans-assault-conviction-hurling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016 Legislative Council election===
In the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 2016|2016 Legislative Council election]], he ran a campaign with militant localist group [[Civic Passion]] and [[Chin Wan]] to promote their political platform in amending the Basic Law to achieve full autonomy for Hong Kong. He was under attack by his former supporter Ho Chi-kwong, who accused him of his "unethical" political past. He received an unexpected loss, losing to [[Yau Wai-ching]] from the localist [[Youngspiration]] by only 424 votes. He blamed his failure on making "too many enemies in his political career" and "not enough effort". He said he would focus on developing the online radio station My Radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Time for a break: Legco radical Wong Yuk-man to focus on radio station after losing to localist|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2015124/time-break-legco-radical-wong-yuk-man-focus-radio-station|date=5 September 2016|newspaper=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 April 2017, Wong announced his intention to quit politics, not taking part in political affairs, not participating or organising any political groups, and not joining any elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hong Kong veteran politician Wong Yuk-man ‘quitting politics’|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2087784/hong-kong-veteran-politician-wong-yuk-man-quitting-politics|date=14 April 2017|newspaper=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
During the outbreak of [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]] in 2003, Wong became a Christian and baptized in 2008. He helped [[Media Evangelism Limited]], a Christian media organisation in Hong Kong, advertise its films and programmes. In 2006, Wong recorded songs with the Amazing Grace Worship Music Ministry.

However, soon as he expressed his [[Liberal Christian|liberal]] views, many mainstream Protestant churches criticize his position on gay rights. Wong support laws to protect discrimination against gays. He advocated gays should be protected from [[domestic violence]], which was criticised by evangelical churches. He referred to the [[The Society For Truth And Light|Society for Truth and Light]], a conservative [[Christian right]] organisation, as a "terrorist organisation," and said many of its activities were "nonsense", promoting the "[[Taliban]]ization" of Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armbell.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8634&amp;mforum=liberalhk]&lt;/ref&gt; He was a guest of the [[International Day Against Homophobia]] protest in Hong Kong on 21 May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Inmediahk.net |url=http://www.inmediahk.net/public/article?item_id=116204&amp;group_id=82 |script-title=zh:豪雨‧豪情——親歷第二屆國際不再恐同日香港區遊行 |accessdate=5 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
