'''Abdullah Saleh Al Mulla''' (died 1955) was [[Secretary of State]] in [[Kuwait]] under the Emirs Sheikh [[Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah]] and Sheikh [[Abdullah III Al-Salim Al-Sabah]]. He was one of the first Kuwaitis to be educated in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] during the early 1900s, and the country's first Secretary of State that was able to directly deal with the Western world during a pivotal period of Kuwait's history, the discovery of oil.

During his tenure as Secretary of State, and given his fluency in the English language, he acted on behalf of the [[Emir]] in discussions with major international [[oil]] companies to start exploration and drilling for oil in Kuwait. He Mulla was instrumental in negotiating agreeable terms between the Kuwaiti government and the companies, which eventually led to the first oil wells in Kuwait. He was also the first to recommend and negotiate on behalf of the Kuwaiti government for the installation and commissioning of Kuwait's first desalination plant located in [[Shuwaikh]], as well as the first to coordinate the commissioning of Kuwait's first major power station.

In recognition of his efforts in strengthening bilateral relations between Kuwait and the United Kingdom, he was recognized as a recipient of the Most Excellent [[Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in 1953.

In 1938, Abdullah Al Mulla started his private business, which today has grown into a multi-national conglomerate,  the [[Al Mulla Group]]. He died in  1955 due to a brain hemorrhage, but  the conglomerate has continued to grow, and his legacy continued with his sons Bader, Najeeb, Anwar, Nabil, and Lutfi, all of whom have been involved in helping the business.

== History ==

The first survey was conducted in 1999-2000 to assess the business environment and performance of firms in the countries of [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Central Asia]]. The sample included about 4000 firms.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Since then three other rounds of the survey have been conducted.&lt;ref name="TurleyLuke2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OECD2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=OECD|title=Progress in Policy Reforms to Improve the Investment Climate in South East Europe Investment Reform Index 2006: Investment Reform Index 2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rtLVAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA92|date=13 November 2007|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=978-92-64-03724-3|pages=92–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 2008-2009 survey covered more than 11,000 firms.  The 2008 round survey questionnaire and the sampling methodology were significantly modified, making direct cross-period comparisons problematic.
This survey was conducted in the following 28 countries: [[Albania]], [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Belarus]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Estonia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Hungary]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan|Kyrgyz Republic]], [[Montenegro]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Macedonia (country)|Macedonia]], [[Moldova]], [[Poland]], [[Russia|Russian Federation]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovakia|Slovak Republic]], [[Slovenia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Ukraine]], [[Uzbekistan]].

== Other business surveys ==

Several other projects are conducted with a similar purpose of describing business environment in different countries, most notably ''The [[Doing Business Report]]''. Unlike ''The Doing Business Report'', BEEPS are only conducted in the countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia.&lt;ref name="BourguignonJacquet2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hellman, Joel, et al.

'''Barbara "Basia" Piasecka Johnson''' (born '''Barbara Piasecka'''; February 25, 1937 – April 1, 2013) was a Polish [[humanitarian]], [[philanthropist]], art connoisseur and [[art collector|collector]].

==Early life==
Piasecka Johnson was born in [[Staniewicze]] near [[Grodno]], [[Poland]] (now in [[Belarus]]). Her father was a farmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/10/nyregion/the-family-behind-the-company.html | title=The Family Behind the Company | work=New York Times | date=2005-04-10 | accessdate=2013-10-08 | last=Warner | first=Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/lifestyle/article-23795269-casey-johnson---death-of-a-gossip-girl.do |title=Casey Johnson - death of a gossip girl |work=London Evening Standard |date=14 January 2010 |accessdate=8 October 2013 |author=Ellwood, Mark |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605063817/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/lifestyle/article-23795269-casey-johnson---death-of-a-gossip-girl.do |archivedate=5 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from [[Wroclaw University]] with a [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in Art History. She left Poland in 1968, with $100 in her possession.&lt;ref name="people1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20093724,00.html | title=The Band-Aid Heir Left All He Owned to His Widow, but His Children Claim It Was Just Seward's Folly | work=People | date=26 May 1986 | accessdate=2013-10-08 | last=McMurran | first=Kristin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Piasecka was hired as a cook by Esther Underwood Johnson, then wife of [[John Seward Johnson I]]. She then worked as the Johnsons' [[Maid|chambermaid]].&lt;ref name="people1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GI-EVgqxHmgC&amp;pg=PA158 | title=The Purchase of Intimacy | publisher=Princeton University Press | date=2009 | accessdate=2013-10-08 | author=Zelizer, Viviana A. | pages=158–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One time seeing his admiration for one of the paintings he had bought, she said casually that he overpaid for it because it is not a picture of a master, but his disciple and by using the dates proved it. Johnson was shocked about her knowledge and expertise, and appointed her as consultant to his purchases of works of art. A year after she became Johnson's chambermaid, she became his [[curator]] for the Seward Johnson's art collection.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;

==Personal life==

The '''Chartered Institute of Public Relations''' (CIPR) is a professional body in the [[United Kingdom]] for [[public relations]] practitioners. Founded as the Institute for Public Relations in 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Alison Theaker, The Public Relations Handbook Routledge 2004 p.15&lt;/ref&gt; CIPR was awarded Chartered status by the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]] in 2005 and added "Chartered" to its name.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prweek.com/article/462473/opinion-leader---ipr-charter-status-beginning accessed 23/5/2017&lt;/ref&gt; As of late 2012, CIPR had 10,095 members. The association provides training and education, publishes a code of conduct and hosts awards and events. It is governed by a Board of Directors led by a President who is elected each year.

==History==
Discussions at the first Public Relations Officers conference in November 1946&lt;ref name="web"/&gt; led to the foundation of the Institute of Public Relations (IPR) in February 1948.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite news

The Privy Council said that in order to be awarded chartered status, the organisation would have "adopt and publish professional ethical standards relevant to the practice of public relations and to maintain procedures for the regulation of members' professional conduct and discipline."&lt;ref name="journal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tobin|first1=Natasha|title=Can the professionalisation of the UK public relations industry make it more trustworthy?|journal=[[Journal of Communication Management]]|volume=9|issue=1|year=2005|pages=56–64|issn=1363-254X|doi=10.1108/13632540510621498|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/journal-of-communication-management-an-international-journal/oclc/807840227}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute's first code of conduct was published seven years later in 1963.&lt;ref name="web"/&gt; As of 2003 few members have been expelled for breaches in the code.&lt;ref&gt;L’Etang, J. (2003) ‘The myth of the ‘‘ethical guardian’’. An examination of its origins, potency and illusions’, ''Journal of Communication Management'', Vol. 8, No. 1, pp. 53–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

To support its bid for chartered status, IPR created a joint report with the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] in 2003 based on a survey of 812 professionals.&lt;ref name="journal"/&gt; The following year the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] told IPR it needed to do more for the public good and professional development to qualify. By 2005, the privy council decided that IPR and its members act in a way that contributes to the public good and granted it chartered status.&lt;ref name="oney"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zetter2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lionel Zetter|title=Lobbying: The Art of Political Persuasion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G4CRBiw8jUUC&amp;pg=PA10|accessdate=2 January 2013|date=1 November 2008|publisher=Harriman House Limited|isbn=978-1-905641-69-7|pages=10–}}&lt;/ref&gt; IPR added "Chartered" to its name.&lt;ref name="oney"&gt;{{cite news

CIPR changed its membership structure in 2011. Affiliate-level memberships were removed and the requirement for six years of experience to attain full membership status was reduced to two.&lt;ref name="membership"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=PR Week|date=18 November 2011|title=CIPR ditches 'broken' entry rules|first=Matt|last=Cartmell|pp=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, CIPR responded to a report&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=Intellectual Property Office|url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipreview.htm|first=Ian|last=Hargreaves|title=A review of Intellectual Property and Growth|accessdate=27 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112213030/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipreview.htm|archivedate=12 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the UK's [[Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)|Intellectual Property Office]]. CIPR felt that copyright policy decisions were prioritizing commercial interests over the public good. They expressed concern that the [[Newspaper Licensing Agency]] (NLA) was both the most popular provider of newspaper clippings to public relations professionals in the UK and the organization that enforces the intellectual property rights of newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=CIPR- Response to Review of Intellectual Property and Growth|date=March 2011|url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipreview-c4e-sub-cipr.pdf|accessdate=27 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530001359/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipreview-c4e-sub-cipr.pdf|archivedate=30 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011 the [[Bureau of Investigative Journalism]] shot a covert video interview with [[Bell Pottinger]] executives, in which the executives referred to their "dark arts" for manipulating English Wikipedia entries for their clients.&lt;ref name="Indep"&gt;{{cite news|last=Newman|first=Melanie|last2=Wright|first2=Oliver |title=Caught on camera: top lobbyists boasting how they influence the PM ''Special undercover investigation: Executives from Bell Pottinger reveal 'dark arts' they use to burnish reputations of countries accused of human rights violations''|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/caught-on-camera-top-lobbyists-boasting-how-they-influence-the-pm-6272760.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month CIPR announced it would work with the Wikipedia community to create guidance for public relations professionals on how to participate ethically on English Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

According to ''PRWeek'' and ''CorpComms Magazine'' the most important aspect of CIPR's guidance is that PR professionals not directly edit English  Wikipedia articles about their clients or employers.

==Lobbying==
In 2009 CIPR provided an official response to a report by the [[Public Administration Select Committee]]'s (PASC) that suggested the creation of a new government entity to oversee and regulate lobbyists. The report suggested the creation of a requirement for lobbyists to register themselves and record their activities. CIPR's position was that regulation would complement CIPR's code of ethics, but that it was more important to regulate members of the [[House of Lords]] that were being lobbied to. CIPR also said that lobbying regulation should focus on regulating individuals instead of companies.&lt;ref name="alter"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/ciprresponse.pdf|work=CIPR response to PASC report on lobbying July 2009|title=Chartered Institute of Public Relations – response to recommendations made by Public Administration Select Committee on Lobbying|publisher=CIPR|date=July 2009|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=Public Administration Select Committee|date=9 December 2008|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmpubadm/36/36i.pdf|title=Lobbying: Access and influence in Whitehall|accessdate=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=PRWeek|title=The week in lobbying|url=http://www.prweek.com/uk/news/895788/week-lobbying/?DCMP=ILC-SEARCH|date=1 April 2009|accessdate=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, CIPR joined The Public Relations Consultants Association and the Association of Professional Political Consultants in criticizing the UK government's definition of a lobbyist. CIPR's Director of Policy said the definition of lobbying was so narrow it would be "self-defeating" because few lobbyists would be defined as one. CIPR and other public relations trade associations support a registrar for lobbyists, though UK government estimates the cost of a registrar to be 500,000 pounds its first year and 200,000 every year thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UK trade bodies attack lobbying bill's definition|first=Daniel|last=Farey-Jones|date=17 July 2013|accessdate=1 August 2013|url=http://www.prweekus.com/uk-trade-bodies-attack-lobbying-bills-weak-definition/article/303479/|newspaper=PRWeek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015 the CIPR launched the UK Lobbying Register to replace the joint voluntary register previously run in conjunction with The Public Relations Consultants Association and the Association of Professional Political Consultants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prweek.com/article/1354041/ukpac-closes-hands-responsibility-lobbying-register-cipr accessed 23/5/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Of non-legal obligations, '''collateral assurance''' is a [[Surety bond|bond]] made over and beyond the [[deed]] itself, for the performance of an agreement, or [[Covenant (law)|covenant]], made between two individuals; so called, for being external, and without the nature and essence of a covenant.  A collateral assurance is separate but subservient to the principal contract.  It usually allows for damages to be paid when the assurance is broken without allowing the principal agreement to be voided.  [[Warranties]] are examples of this sort of assurance.

'''''Daily News Record''''' (or '''''DNR''''') was an [[United States|American]] fashion [[trade journal]] published by [[Fairchild Publications, Inc.]]. ''DNR'' started in 1890 when [[Edmund Fairchild]] used the wealth he had accumulated selling soap to purchase the ''[[Chicago Herald Gazette]]'', a newspaper which focused on the men’s clothing business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dellamoda.it/fashion_dictionary/f/fairchild_publications.php "Fairchild Publications"], Fashion Dictionary, 2006, ed. Baldini Castoldi Dalai, {{ISBN|978-88-6073-015-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with his brother Luis, Fairchild published a mimeographed paper which they called the ''Daily Trade Record'' and distributed at [[1893 Chicago World's Fair]].

The paper was so successful that the pair decided to continue publication even after the fair finished. It acquired its current name some time later, and included a small feature about women’s wear. In July, 1910, this feature was split from the paper, and given its own publication that is today ''[[Women's Wear Daily]]''.

In 1999, the parent company of the ''Daily News Record'', [[Fairchild Fashion Media|Fairchild Publications]], Inc. was acquired by [[Condé Nast Publications]] after briefly being owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]] (which had acquired when it purchased [[Capital Cities Communications]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/23/business/media-conde-s-latest-acquisition-has-fashion-industry-fidgeting.html "MEDIA; Conde's Latest Acquisition Has Fashion Industry Fidgeting"], ''The New York Times'', Aug. 23, 1999, by Alex Kuczynski&lt;/ref&gt;

The staff was told of ''DNR'''s folding at an afternoon meeting on November 20, 2008, by [[editor in chief]] John Birmingham. Its men's fashion coverage was absorbed into ''Women's Wear Daily'' and is featured every week.

{{Unreferenced|date=April 2008}}

'''Dermot FitzGerald''' (20 March 1935 – 5 February 2006) was a leading Irish businessman and philanthropist. A descendant of the aristocratic [[Earls of Desmond]], FitzGerald was born in Limerick, Ireland to a southern Irish Protestant family. His father, Gerald FitzGerald, was a bank manager. He attended [[Wesley College, Dublin|Wesley College]], a prestigious Dublin school run by his maternal uncle Gerald Myles. Upon graduating he joined a host of notable alumni such as playwright [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[Chaim Herzog]], the sixth [[President of Israel]].

In the late 1950s, FitzGerald emerged as a pioneer of [[scuba diving]] in Ireland. FitzGerald's work in the fledgling field of [[underwater photography]] unveiled and displayed the marine life of the Irish coastline to a wondrous audience. At a time when the Irish authorities had no diving capability, FitzGerald was often summoned to lead dives on behalf of the government.

FitzGerald began his business career as a trainee in a small accounting firm. Following a series of mergers, FitzGerald quickly rose through the ranks and was ultimately appointed the head partner of [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]]. In the 1980s, as the Irish economy was experiencing a crippling recession, FitzGerald emerged as a leading insolvency practitioner. His business reputation flourished after a string of successes in rescuing failing businesses. In 1986, FitzGerald was the defendant in a landmark legal case brought by Irish tobacco giant Carroll Group. The court issued judgement in favor of FitzGerald. The precedent set by [http://www.ucc.ie/law/irlii/cases/7401p_86.htm Carroll Group v Bourke] defines the legal treatment of "reservation of title". In recognition of his distinguished business career, FitzGerald was featured in Maureen Cairnduff's "Who's Who in Ireland: The Influential 1000".

Upon retirement, FitzGerald devoted much of his time to philanthropic activities. He was instrumental in introducing Ireland to the concept of assisted living communities for the elderly. With the help of his wife, Valerie, and friend Reverend Desmond Bain, the President of the Methodist Church in Ireland, FitzGerald founded and developed the first assisted living community in Adare, Ireland, in 1994.

Dermot FitzGerald died of cancer in 2006 in his native Limerick, Ireland.

'''Donald MacNeil Fairfax''' (March 10, 1818 &amp;ndash; January 10, 1894) was an officer in the [[United States Navy]] during the [[American Civil War]].

==Early life and family==

|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; he was born at the family seat of [[Mount Eagle (plantation)|Mount Eagle]], [[Virginia]]. Fairfax entered the Navy as a [[midshipman]] on August 12, 1837.  He was the only member of the family who took the Union side in the [[American Civil War]].

==The Trent Affair==
As executive officer in {{USS|San Jacinto|1850|2}}, he was a participant in the 1861 "[[Trent Affair]]," a diplomatic controversy involving the U.S. Navy's removal of Confederate commissioners from the British mail-steamer, {{RMS|Trent}}. On November 8, 1861, Fairfax boarded ''Trent'' to remove [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] commissioners [[James M. Mason]] and [[John Slidell]], after the ship had been stopped by his captain, [[Charles Wilkes]].

Wilkes had given Fairfax the following written instructions:
{{quote|On boarding her you will demand the papers of the steamer, her clearance from Havana, with the list of passengers and crew.

Should Mr. Mason, Mr. Slidell, [[George Eustis, Jr.|Mr. Eustice]] [sic] and Mr. McFarland be on board make them prisoners and send them on board this ship and take possession of her [the ''Trent''] as a prize. … They must be brought on board.

All trunks, cases, packages and bags belonging to them you will take possession of and send on board this ship; any dispatches found on the persons of the prisoners, or in possession of those on board the steamer, will be taken possession of, examined, and retained if necessary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=D. Macneil Fairfax| chapter=Captain Wilkes’s Seizure of Mason and Slidell |title=Battles and Leaders of the Civil War: North to Antietam| editor=Robert Underwood Johnson, Clarence Clough Buel| year=1885| pages=136–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Fairfax demanded the passenger list, but Mason and Slidell identified themselves. He escorted Mason by the collar, to the cutter, and with two officers took hold of Slidell from the main cabin.  He failed to claim ''Trent'' as a prize, citing the loss of manpower of a prize crew (avoiding a worse incident).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=Lincoln and His Admirals| pages=76–77| author=Craig L. Symonds| publisher=Oxford University Press| year=2008| isbn=978-0-19-531022-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil War Service==
Fairfax's distinguished service in the Civil War included command of the {{USS|Cayuga|1861|2}}, {{USS|Nantucket|1862|2}} and {{USS|Montauk|1862|2}}.

Fairfax was later promoted to flag rank, retiring as a [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] on September 30, 1881.  He retired to [[Hagerstown, Maryland]] where he served on the vestry of [[Saint John's Church (Hagerstown, Maryland)|Saint John's Church]].  Admiral Fairfax died in 1894.

ETA is also one of the 13 COLEMs (Commercial Operator License Examination Manager) for U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wireless.fcc.gov/commoperators/index.htm?job=cole|title=Commercial Radio Operator License Program|work=fcc.gov|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ETA works with technicians, educators, and military personnel. ETA also partners with companies such as [[Motorola Solutions]] to provide certification to their employees.

==History==
In 1965 the U.S. Labor Department, Bureau of Apprenticeship &amp; Training (BAT) instigated a jobs program in cooperation with NEA (National Electronics Association). Local school systems, local TV association members and USDL worked together on an 8,000 hour apprenticeship program aimed at solving the labor shortage problem while finding new vocations for those put out of work by modern technology. This new program would reward trainees, but would not cover experienced technicians. Because of this, the Certified Electronics Technician (CET) program was created.

In 1970 a group of technicians decided to form an organization to promote the CET program and the electronics industry as a whole. This organization would be called the International Society of Certified Electronics Technicians (ISCET). It became a subdivision of NEA.

In the mid-1970s NEA and NATESA merged to form the National Electronic Service Dealers Association (NESDA) with ISCET remaining as a subdivision. Due to a power struggle within the organization, ETA was formed in 1978 by a group of former NESDA members and officers. Among those were Richard "Dick" Glass and Ron Crow, two of the original founders of the CET program and only administrators at that time. This made it easy to continue the CET program with the new organization.

'''Energy monitoring and targeting''' (M&amp;T) is an energy efficiency technique based on the standard [[management]] axiom stating that “you cannot manage what you cannot measure”. M&amp;T techniques provide [[Energy engineering|energy manager]]s with feedback on operating practices, results of energy management projects, and guidance on the level of energy use that is expected in a certain period. Importantly, they also give early warning of unexpected excess consumption caused by equipment malfunctions, operator error, unwanted user behaviours, lack of effective maintenance and the like.

The foundation of M&amp;T lies in determining the normal relationships of energy consumptions to relevant driving factors (HVAC equipment, production though puts, weather, occupancy available daylight, etc.) and the goal is to help business managers:

* Identify and explain excessive energy use
* Detect instances when consumption is unexpectedly higher or lower than would usually have been the case
* Visualize energy consumption trends (daily, weekly, seasonal, operational…)
* Determine future energy use and costs when planning changes in the business
* Diagnose specific areas of wasted energy
* Observe how changes to relevant driving factors impact energy efficiency
* Develop performance targets for energy management programs
* Manage energy consumption, rather than accept it as a fixed cost

The ultimate goal is to reduce energy costs through improved [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and energy management control. Other benefits generally include increased resource efficiency, improved [[production, costs, and pricing|production]] budgeting and reduction of [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions.

==History==
M&amp;T is an established technique that was first launched as a national program in the [[UK]] in 1980, and has since then spread throughout Europe. These techniques are now{{When|date=July 2014}} also rapidly growing in America.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Goals and benefits==
Throughout the numerous M&amp;T projects implemented since the 1980s, a certain number of benefits have proved to be recurrent:
* Energy cost savings: generally 5% of the original energy expenses, according to [[The Carbon Trust]]. Carbon Trust has conducted a study over 1000 [[Small Business|small businesses]] and has concluded that on average an organization could save 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advanced metering for SMEs |url=https://www.carbontrust.com/media/77244/ctc713_advanced_metering_for_smes.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151209000820/https://www.carbontrust.com/media/77244/ctc713_advanced_metering_for_smes.pdf |archivedate=December 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reduction in [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] emissions: lower energy consumption helps reduce emissions
* Financing: measured energy reductions help obtain [[grant (money)|grants]] for energy efficiency projects
* Improved product and service costing: [[Utility submeter|sub-metering]] allows the division of the energy bill between the different processes of an [[industry]], and can be calculated as a [[production cost]]
* Improved [[budgeting]]: M&amp;T techniques can help forecast energy expenses in the case of changes in the business, for example
* Waste avoidance: helps diagnose energy waste in any process.

==Technique==

=== Key principles ===
Monitoring and Targeting techniques rely on three main principles, which form a constant [[feedback]] cycle, therefore improving control of energy use.

====Monitoring====
Monitoring [[information]] of energy use, in order to establish a basis for energy management and explain [[deviation (statistics)|deviations]] from an established pattern. Its primary goal is to maintain said pattern, by providing all the necessary data on energy consumption, as well as certain [[driving factors]], as identified during preliminary investigation ([[production, costs, and pricing|production]], weather, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodengineeringmag.com/articles/90655-energy-management-crunching-the-numbers|title=Energy management: crunching the numbers|last=Labs|first=Wayne|date=13 May 2013|publisher=Food Engineering Magazine|accessdate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reporting====
The final principle is the one which enables ongoing control of energy use, achievement of targets and verification of savings: reports must be issued to the appropriate managers. This in turn allows [[decision-making]] and actions to be taken in order to achieve the targets, as well as confirmation or denial that the targets have been reached.

===Procedures===
Before the M&amp;T measures themselves are implemented, a few preparatory steps are necessary. First of all, key energy consumers on the site must be identified. Generally, most of the energy consumption is concentrated in a small number of processes, like heating, or certain [[machinery]]. This normally requires a certain survey of the [[building]] and the equipment to estimate their energy consumption level.

It is also necessary to assess what other [[measurements]] will be required to [[analysis|analyze]] the consumption appropriately. This data will be used to [[chart]] against the energy consumption: these are underlying factors which influence the consumption, often [[production, costs, and pricing|production]] (for industry processes) or exterior [[temperature]] (for heating processes), but may include many other variables.

Once all variables to be measured have been established, and the necessary meters installed, it is possible to initiate the M&amp;T procedures.

====Measure====
The first step is to compile the data from the different meters.  Low-cost energy feedback displays have become available. The frequency at which the data is compiled varies according to the desired reporting interval, but can go once every 30 seconds to once every 15 minutes. Some measurements can be taken directly from the meters, others must be calculated. These different measurements are often called streams or channels.

Driving factors such as production or [[degree day]]s also constitute streams and must be collected at intervals to match.

====Define the base-line====
The data compiled must then be plotted on a [[chart|graph]] in order to define the general consumption base-line. Consumption rates are plotted in a [[scatter plot]] against [[production, costs, and pricing|production]] or any other variable previously identified, and the [[best fit line]] is identified. This graph is the image of the business’ average energy performance, and conveys a lot of information:

* The [[y-intercept]] gives the minimal consumption in the absence of the variable (no [[production, costs, and pricing|production]], zero [[degree-day]]...). This is the base load of the system, the minimal consumption when it is not operating.
* The [[slope]] represents the relationship between the consumption and the previously identified [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]]. This represents the efficiency of the process.
* The scatter is the degree of variability of the consumption with operational factors.
The [[slope]] is not used quite as often for M&amp;T purposes. However, a high [[y-intercept]] can mean that there is a fault in the process, causing it to use too much energy with no performance, unless there are specific distinctive features which lead to high base loads. Very scattered points, on the other hand, may reflect other significant factors playing in the variation of the energy consumption, other than the one plotted in the first place, but it can also be the illustration of a lack of control over the process.

====Monitor variations====
The next step is to monitor the difference between the expected consumption and the actual measured consumption. One of the tools most commonly used for this is the [[control chart|CUSUM]], which is the CUmulative SUM of differences. This consists in first calculating the difference between the expected and actual performances (the [[best fit line]] previously identified and the points themselves).

The [[CUSUM]] can then be plotted against time on a new [[chart|graph]], which then yields more information for the energy efficiency specialist. [[Variance]]s scattered around zero usually mean that the process is operating normally. Marked variations, increasing or decreasing steadily usually reflect a modification in the conditions of the process.

[[Image:CUSUM graph.jpg|right|Example of a CUSUM graph]]In the case of the [[control chart|CUSUM]] graph, the [[slope]] becomes very important, as it is the main indicator of the [[savings]] achieved. A [[slope]] going steadily down indicates steady [[savings]]. Any variation in the [[slope]] indicates a change in the process. For example, in the graph on the right, the first section indicated no [[savings]]. However, in September (beginning of the yellow line), an energy efficiency measure must have been implemented, as [[savings]] start to occur. The green line indicates an increase in the [[savings]] (as the [[slope]] is becoming steeper), whereas the red line must reflect a modification in the process having occurred in November, as [[savings]] have decreased slightly.

====Identify causes====
Energy efficiency specialists, in collaboration with building [[managers]], will decipher the [[control chart|CUSUM]] graph and identify the causes leading to variations in the consumption. This can be a change in [[behaviour]], a modification to the process, different exterior conditions, etc. These changes must be monitored and the causes identified in order to promote and enhance good behaviour, and discourage bad ones.

====Set targets====
Once the base line has been established, and causes for variations in energy consumption have been identified, it is time to set targets for the future. Now with all this information in hand, the targets are more realistic, as they are based on the building’s actual consumption.
Targeting consists in two main parts: the measure to which the consumption can be reduced, and the [[timeframe]] during which the compression will be achieved.

A good initial target is the [[best fit line]] identified during step 2. This line represents the [[average]] historical performance. Therefore, keeping all consumption below or equal to the historical average is an achievable target, yet remains a challenge as it involves eliminating high consumption peaks.

Some companies, as they improve their energy consumption, might even decide to bring their [[average]] performance down to their historical best. This is considered a much more challenging target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicenergy.com/live-energy-monitoring/building-energy-use/case-studies/|title=Building Energy Generation &amp; Usage|work=Case Studies|publisher=Logic Energy|accessdate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Monitor results====
This brings us back to step 1: measure consumption. One of the specificities of M&amp;T is that it is an ongoing process, requiring constant [[feedback]] in order to consistently improve performance. Once the targets are set and the desired measures are implemented, repeating the procedure from the start ensures that the managers are aware of the success or failure of the measures, and can then decide on further action.

===Examples===
An example with some features of an M&amp;T application is the [[ASU Campus Metabolism]], which provides real-time and historic energy use and generation data for facilities of [[Arizona State University]] on a public web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cm.asu.edu/|title=DGLux5 by DGLogik|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many utilities also offer customers electric interval data monitoring services. [[Xcel Energy]] is an example of an investor owned utility that offers its customer electric and natural gas monitoring services under the product name InfoWise from Xcel Energy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xcelenergy.com/infowise/|title=InfoWise from Xcel Energy - Xcel Energy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is administered by Power TakeOff,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.PowerTakeOff.com|title=PowerTakeOff – EMIS Behavioral Programming|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a third party partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xcelenergy.com/infowise/|title=InfoWise from Xcel Energy - Xcel Energy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ernst &amp; Young''' ([[doing business as]] '''EY''') is a [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[professional services]] firm headquartered in [[London]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom]]. EY is one of the largest professional services firms in the world and is one of the "[[Big Four (audit firms)|Big Four]]" accounting firms.

EY operates as a network of member firms which are separate legal entities in individual countries. It has 250,000 employees in over 700 offices around 150 countries in the world. It provides [[assurance services|assurance]] (including [[financial audit]]), [[tax]], [[management consulting|consulting]] and [[Corporate services|advisory services]] to companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EY at a glance |publisher=EY |accessdate=2013-07-03 |url=http://www.ey.com/UK/en/Newsroom/Facts-and-figures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm dates back to 1849 with the founding of Harding &amp; Pullein in England. The current firm was formed by a merger of Ernst &amp; Whinney and Arthur Young &amp; Co. in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A timeline of our history |url=http://www.ey.com/gl/en/about-us/our-people-and-culture/our-history/about-ey---key-facts-and-figures---history---timeline |accessdate=2016-09-24 |publisher=EY |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927092457/http://www.ey.com/gl/en/about-us/our-people-and-culture/our-history/about-ey---key-facts-and-figures---history---timeline |archive-date=27 September 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was known as Ernst &amp; Young until 2013 when it underwent a rebranding to EY. The acronym "EY" was already an informal name for the firm prior to its official adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ernst &amp; Young re-brands |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/sectors/financial-services/ernst-young-re-brands-1.1449229 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130702220058/http://www.irishtimes.com/business/sectors/financial-services/ernst-young-re-brands-1.1449229 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 July 2013 |work=[[The Irish Times]] |date=2013-07-01 |first=Fiona |last=Reddan |accessdate=2013-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early history===
EY is the result of a series of mergers of ancestor organizations. The oldest originating partnership was founded in 1849 in England as Harding &amp; Pullein.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www.ey.com/GL/en/About-us/Our-history "Ernst &amp; Young – History"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715172635/http://www.ey.com/GL/en/About-us/Our-history |date=15 July 2009 }}. Ernst &amp; Young. Retrieved 9 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In that year the firm was joined by Frederick Whinney. He was made a partner in 1859 and with his sons in the business, it was renamed Whinney Smith &amp; Whinney in 1894.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

In 1903, the firm of '''Ernst &amp; Ernst''' was established in [[Cleveland]] by [[Alwin C. Ernst]] and his brother Theodore and in 1906, '''Arthur Young &amp; Co. ''' was set up by the Scotsman [[Arthur Young (accountant)|Arthur Young]] in Chicago.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

As early as 1924, these American firms allied with prominent British firms, Young with Broads Paterson &amp; Co. and Ernst with Whinney Smith &amp; Whinney.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; In 1979, this led to the formation of Anglo-American Ernst &amp; Whinney, creating the fourth largest [[accountancy]] firm in the world.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Also in 1979, the European offices of Arthur Young merged with several large local European firms, which became member firms of Arthur Young International.

===Mergers===
In 1989, the number four firm Ernst &amp; Whinney merged with the then number five, Arthur Young, on a global basis to create Ernst &amp; Young.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE2DE1E38F93BA25756C0A96F948260 "Reports Say Arthur Young and Ernst May Merge"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. May 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1997, EY announced plans to merge its global practices with [[KPMG]] to create the largest professional services organization in the world, coming on the heels of another merger plan announced in September 1997 by [[Price Waterhouse]] and [[Coopers &amp; Lybrand]]. These plans were abandoned in February 1998 due to client opposition, antitrust issues, cost problems and difficulty of merging the two diverse firms and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/56509.stm "Accountancy Merger Off"]. [[BBC News]]. 23 February 1998. Retrieved 9 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

EY had built up its consulting arm heavily during the 1980s and 1990s. The [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] and members of the investment community began to raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest between the consulting and auditing work amongst the Big Five and in May 2000, EY was the first of the firms to formally and fully separate its consulting practices via a sale to the French IT services company [[Capgemini]] for $11&amp;nbsp;billion, largely in stock, creating the new company of Capgemini Ernst &amp; Young, which was later renamed [[Capgemini]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503E6D81339F932A35750C0A9669C8B63 "Capgemini to Acquire Ernst &amp; Young Consulting Business"].

In April 2009, [[Reuters]] reported that EY launched an initiative encouraging its staff in [[China]] to take 40 days of low-pay leave between July 2009 and June 2010 due to the economic turndown. Those who participated got 20% of regular salary plus benefits of a full-time employee. The initiative applied to employees in [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and [[mainland China]], where the firm's employees are 8,500 in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKHKG25976420090416|title=Ernst &amp; Young China Staff to Take Low-Pay Leave|author=Chen, George|date=16 April 2009|publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global structure==
EY is the most globally managed of the Big Four firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accountingverse.com/articles/big-4-accounting-firms.html|title=Big 4 Accounting Firms|last=|first=|date=|website=AccountingVerse|access-date=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; EY Global sets global standards and oversees global policy and consistency of service, with client work performed by its member firms.

Each EY member country is organized as part of one of four areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webcpa.com/news/27572-1.html "Ernst &amp; Young Consolidates Global Structure"]. Webcpa. Retrieved 9 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This is different from other [[professional services networks]], which are more centrally managed.

The four areas are:
* [[Europe, the Middle East and Africa|EMEIA]]: Europe, Middle East, [[India]] and [[Africa]]
* Americas
* [[Asia-Pacific]]
* [[Japan]]
Each area has an identical business structure and a management team, which is led by an Area Managing Partner who is part of the Global Executive board.

===Operations in India===
In [[India]], since [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of India|ICAI]] regulations do not permit foreign firms to carry out company audits, Ernst and Young carries them out through ''SR Batliboi &amp; Co'', an accountancy firm headquartered in Mumbai.&lt;ref name="batliboi"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ernst &amp; Young In Consultancy Venture With S R Batliboi |url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/specials/ernst-young-in-consultancy-venture-with-s-r-batliboi-197111201114_1.html |accessdate=1 October 2018 |publisher=Business Standard |date=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They carry out audits for large companies such as [[Vedanta Limited]] and V-Guard under partnerships called S.R.Batliboi &amp; Co LLP and S.R.Batliboi &amp; Co Associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Investor relations - financial results June 2015 |date=1 July 2015 |publisher=ViGuard India |location=Kochi |url=https://www.vguard.in/uploads/investor_relations/v_guard_unaudited_financial_results_june2015_2.pdf |accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dave |first1=Sachin |title=Auditors under close watch, Big 4 tells its partners to take it easy with targets |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/consultancy-/-audit/sector-under-scrutiny-big-4-ease-revenue-targets-for-audit-partners/articleshow/64597730.cms |accessdate=1 October 2018 |publisher=Economic Times |date=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Factory-kitchen''' or '''kitchen factory''' ({{lang-ru|Фабрика-кухня}}) was a large mechanized enterprise of [[food service]] in the [[Soviet Union]], originated in 1920-1930s. Its main purpose was centralized preparation of food (both prefabrication and full processing) supplied for communal dining rooms or for personal purchase. Factory-kitchens were characteristic of their unique architecture. Sometimes the term is inadequately translated as '''communal kitchen''', the latter being a kitchen in a Soviet [[communal apartment]].

The idea of centralized food preparation was part of the emancipation of the women from the household work in early Soviet Union, and to better tap into women's workforce. Along with the [[house-commune]]s (дом-коммуна), factory-kitchens were to get rid of "the yoke of the household economy". Slogans of the day were "Away with Pots and Pans!" and "The Saucepan is an Enemy of the [[party cell|Party Cell]].&lt;ref name= stites&gt;[[Richard Stites]],  ''The Women's Liberation Movement in Russia: Feminism, Nihilism, and Bolshevism, 1860-1930'', 1978, {{ISBN|0691100586}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qy679HV7AmkC&amp;q=kitchen#v=snippet&amp;q=kitchen&amp;f=false p. 409]&lt;/ref&gt;

Various propagandists explained how "a single person can prepare from fifty to hundred dinners a day".&lt;ref name= stites/&gt; A children's book ''A Cook for a Whole City''&lt;ref&gt;Т.Габбе, З.Задунайская.

'''Sir''' '''Felix Booth''', [[Baronet|1st Baronet]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (1775 [[Roydon, Essex]] – 24 January 1850 [[Brighton]], Sussex) was a wealthy UK [[gin]] [[distillation|distiller]], and promoter of [[Arctic exploration]], with various places in [[Nunavut]], Canada being named after him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/2/101002876/ www.oxforddnb.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and family==
{{unreferenced | section|date=January 2017}}
Sir Felix Booth's ancestry can be traced back to the marriage of William de Booth in abt 1250 in Branston Lancashire. Five generations later, Sir John Booth b abt 1350 wed twice, firstly to Lady Joan Trafford in abt 1378 at Barton upon Inwell and secondly to Lady Maude Savage in abt 1412 at Barton upon Inwell Lancashire, collectively producing thirteen children. There was a parting of the ways with their children when their son Thomas Booth (1395–1482) (later knighted) moved from Lancashire to Lincolnshire and married Isabella Carrington in 1431 at Killingholme,and their other son named Robert Booth (b 1384) (later knighted) married Dulcia Venabales on 3 May 1409 at Eccles Lancashire and became the start of the "Booths of Dunham Massey" dynasty in Cheshire.

Sir Thomas and Isabella Booth née Carrington, now living in Lincolnshire, had seven offspring in [[North Killingholme|Killingholme]] from which two Booth streams eventuated with their son Thomas Booth marrying Ann Ashton in abt 1456 at Goxhill Lincolnshire and starting the "Booths of Goxhill" dynasty, whilst their son Henry Booth married Elizabeth Gascaryk in 1460 at Killingholme Lincolnshire and started the "Booths of Killingholme" dynasty. Sir Felix Booth's ancestry has derived from the "Booths of Killingholme" dynasty.

Five generations later, John Booth of Killingholme born abt 1555 married Martha Butler in abt 1573 at Goxhill and they had four offspring, from which their son George Booth b 1582 married Elizabeth Monkton in abt 1605 at Killingholme. Their son William Booth b 1608 married Elizabeth Wright on 13 June 1631 at Market Rasen. William and Elizabeth Booth's marriage produced ten offspring, from which their son Thomas Booth b 1637 (who would become Sir Felix Booth's 2x great-grandfather) married Elizabeth Middlemore on 23 November 1670 at Market Rasen, producing four sons and four daughters: their first son John Booth b 1672 (who would become Sir Felix Booth's 1x great-grandfather) marrying Elizabeth Sanderson on 20 June 1700 at Ulceby, their third son Robert Booth b 1677 marrying Katherine Clinton, daughter of Francis Clinton 6th Earl of Lincoln and their fourth son Peniston Booth marrying Katherine Jones, daughter of Reverend Canon Dr Edward Jones.

From the marriage of John Booth and Elizabeth Sanderson on 20 June 1700 at Ulceby, their second son William Booth b 1703 married Alice Green on 25 July 1729 at Ulceby and they would have eight children comprising six boys and two girls. It would be their first son Richard Booth b 22 July 1730 who would be Sir Felix Booth's first cousin once removed. Richard married Ann Hill in 1753 at Irby upon Humber near Caistor and lived permanently in the village of Caistor. Richard and Ann had nine children comprising six sons and three daughters and their last born son Samuel Booth b 1773 married Ann (maiden name not known)in abt 1803 and had a son named Felix Booth b 1805. Richard Booth died in 1800 aged 70. It was reported in the Gentleman's Magazine in 1840 that "the late Richard Booth's daughter Miss Elizabeth Booth of Caistor Lincolnshire died on 22nd April 1840 in her 82nd year. She was a cousin to Sir Felix Booth".

From the marriage of John Booth and Elizabeth Sanderson on 20 June 1700 at Ulceby, their third son John Booth b 1711(who would become Sir Felix Booth's grandfather) made his way to London and became involved in the distillery business, from which a major British company would evolve. John Booth married a Mary (maiden name may possibly be Watts and the marriage date may possibly be 3 January 1739 at Westminster London, but not substantiated) and by 1740, John Booth was aged 29 years and Booth's Gin was very popular. John and Mary produced at least four offspring including their son Philip Booth who was born during 1745 (substantiated by his obituary saying he died on 5 May 1818 aged 73). A second son John Booth was born abt 1750 and reference to him was reported in the Gentleman's Magazine in 1804 when it said "John Booth's youngest daughter Jane died in her seventeenth year at Caistor Lincolnshire". She was presumably visiting or staying with her Uncle Richard Booth and Aunt Ann Booth. Nothing is known about the remaining offspring.

Around 1760, Philip Booth joined his father John in the family business and in abt 1772, he married Elisabeth Wallis, whose father lived – as did Philip – in the new and fashionable Russell Square on the Bedford Estate in Bloomsbury London. Philip and Elisabeth produced seven children, comprising four sons and three daughters, Elizabeth abt 1773 + William b 25 July 1774 + John Gillyat b 17 March 1776 + Mary b 15 August 1777 + Philip b 1778 + Felix b 16 July 1780 + Alice b 4 August 1782. In the Directory of Merchants for 1778, when Philip was aged 33, there is the entry of the firm Philip Booth and Company, Distillers, of 55 Turnmill Street in Clerkenwell London.  Philip's three sons William, John Gillyat and Felix would join the family business and be groomed as successors.  However shortly before Philip's death in 1818, the original family partnership was dissolved and a new one established between the brothers John Gillyat aged 40 and Felix aged 36. Together they had – to a great extent – rebuilt the Turnmill Street premises and it would be Felix who subsequently obtained sole control of the business.

With energy and drive, Felix expanded the business by building a second distillery at Brentford on the river Thames just six miles from Hyde Park Corner and purchasing the neighbouring brewery of Hazard and Company, which he renamed as the Red Lion Brewery. By establishing a distillery in Edinburgh Scotland, Felix Booth could then boast that he was the owner of the biggest distilling business in England. In 1828, now aged 48, he was elected a Sheriff of the City of London and the County of Middlesex. Felix had now accumulated considerable wealth and decided to use his money to privately fund a voyage of exploration to the Artic Seas, financing Captain Ross and his twenty two companions, equipped with stores and supplies to last several years, on a voyage on the paddle-steamer "Victory". They departed Woolwich Reach on 23 May 1829 and returned to Hull Yorkshire on 18 October 1833, having survived many exploratory experiences. Whilst Captain Ross had failed to open up a North-West passage, he had dramatically narrowed the field for future expeditions by mapping an area of over half-million square miles. For Felix Booth's financial contribution to such an effort, he was knighted by the King and had a baronetcy bestowed upon him 'as a reward for his patriotism in fitting out at his sole cost an expedition in the endeavour to discover a North-West Passage'.
 
In 1832, Sir Felix Booth bought the site of the old [[Ophthalmology|Ophthalmic Hospital]] in [[Albany Street]], [[Regent's Park]] as a site for his [[distillery]]. In 1840, he went into partnership with William Grimble to experiment with producing vinegar from the spirits left over from the manufacturing process. The site was in the NE corner of [[Cumberland Market]]. The venture was unsuccessful so Sir Felix reverted to the more conventional method of vinegar brewing.

Between 1840 and 1843, Sir Felix Booth was faced with a blackmail situation and it was ultimately taken to court in 1843. Sir Felix had a second cousin once removed also named Felix Booth b 1805, being the grandson of Richard Booth of Caistor Lincolnshire. Felix, no doubt envious of Sir Felix's wealth, threatened – with the intent to exhort money – to reveal to the police that Sir Felix had committed unlawful sexual crimes. Sir Felix attended the hearing in Hull Yorkshire, vigorously denying the claims asserted by Felix.  Sir Felix admitted to the court that he had fathered a male child with a Scottish woman in Edinburgh that he was very fond of and had financially assisted the child through his growth years. This situation had made Felix insanely jealous. The 'love child' was referred in the court as simply Mr Marr. The court ruled Sir Felix to be innocent and Felix was found guilty of blackmail and sentenced to twenty years transportation to Australia.

William Bradley (1801–1857), one of England's leading painters / engravers of the era painted a portrait of Sir Felix Booth around 1850, coloured in a mettzo-tint style and it was hung in the Court Room of the Coopers Company until its destruction in an air raid over London during World War 2.

Sir Felix Booth died unexpectedly of heart failure whilst staying in a seaside hotel at Brighton in 1850, aged 69. His funeral procession was staged with all the solemn pageantry of the Victorian period and passed respectful bare-headed villagers lining the roadside in Edmonton and Hoddesdon. Six horses, preceded by outriders, drew the hearse, six coaches of mourners followed it and Sir Felix's private carriage, empty of passengers, brought up the rear. It was said that "Sir Felix Booth dies generally and justly lamented. he was in every respect a princely citizen of London. His immense wealth, acquired by his own industry, was devoted to the benefit or enjoyment of others. His disposition was amiable and his habits splendid. He took delight in hospitality and in acts of kindness and charity".

Sir Felix Booth had not married but his illegitimate son John Marshall Marr – mentioned in the 1843 Hull Court hearing as simply Mr Marr – married Emma Minchin on 26 September 1836 at Exeter Devon and they produced eight daughters and four sons, named George b 1837 + William b 1845 + Arthur b 1852 + John b 1855. John Marshall Marr was adequately benefited in the Will of Sir Felix Booth.

As of 2015, ''Booth's Gin'' remains licensed by [[Diageo]].

==Geographical expeditions==
Fascinated by science, Booth financed [[John Ross (Arctic explorer)|John Ross]]'s 1829 expedition to find the [[Northwest Passage]]. The [[Boothia Peninsula]] and [[Gulf of Boothia]] are named after him.

He provided £17,000 for the expenses of the expedition, to which [[John Ross (Arctic explorer)|Captain (''later'' Sir John) Ross]] had added £3,000, and the result was an immense stride in the progress of [[Geoinformatics|geographical science]]. The grateful [[commander]] bestowed the name of his [[patron]] upon several of his discoveries on land and sea – ''[[Gulf of Boothia]]'', ''Isthmus of Boothia'', ''Continent of Boothia Felix'', ''Felix Harbor'', ''Cape Felix'', and ''Sheriff's Harbor'': the district with the islands, rivers, lakes, &amp;c., extending to 74° N. latitude along the north-eastern portion of North America.

The discovery most important to geographical science was that of the [[North Magnetic Pole|magnetic pole]] at 96° 46' 45" W. longitude, and 70° 5' 17".{{sfn|Gibson|1886}}

==Honours and distinctions==
Having served as [[Alderman]] and [[Livery company|Master]] of the [[Worshipful Company of Coopers]], Booth was elected a [[Sheriff of London]] in 1828.

A founding [[Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society]], Booth was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] on 10 April 1834;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=4&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27booth%27%29| title= Library and Archive Catalogue| publisher = Royal Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; his sponsorship of the successful [[:wikt:expedition|expedition]] was rewarded by King William IV with a [[baronetcy]], on 27 March 1835,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=19212 |date=21 November 1834 |page=2085}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[remainder (law)|remainder]] to heirs male of his eldest brother.{{sfn|Gibson|1886}}

Friedrich Paulsen was born in the tiny port hamlet of Dagebüll on the [[Nordfriesland|North Frisian]] coast. Both his parents originated from the neighbouring island of [[Föhr]].

In 1933 during his studies at [[Kiel]] Paulsen suffered from harassments and threats by the [[Nazism|National Socialists]] due to his opposing political believes. Therefore, he fled to [[Malmö]], Sweden via [[Basel]] in Switzerland to avoid his internment at a [[concentration camp]]. In [[Sweden]], whose citizen he became in 1941, he laid the foundation for the establishment of FERRING (1950) by his research on [[hormone]]s and their synthentical production. Upon accepting the Swedish citizenship he changed his given name Friedrich to ''Frederik''.

After his withdrawal from the company's management he died in 1997 at the age of 87 in Alkersum on Föhr. His son [[Frederik Paulsen Jr]] is the current [[chairman]] of Ferring Pharmaceuticals.

'''Jaime Zóbel de Ayala y Pfitz''', [[Philippine Legion of Honor|PLH]] (born 1934), also known as '''Jaime Zóbel''', is a prominent [[Spanish Filipino|Filipino]] businessman, [[philanthropist]] and [[Art photography|art photographer]]. He is the chairman emeritus of [[Ayala Corporation]]. He has received numerous awards for business leadership, philanthropy and photography.

==Early life and family==

Zóbel was born in 1934 to Alfonso Zóbel de Ayala (1904-1967) and Carmen Pfitz y Herrero (1909-1999). His siblings are Maria Victoria ("Vicky") and Alfonso Jr. ("Alfonsito"). He is a grandson of [[Enrique Zobel de Ayala|Enrique Zóbel de Ayala]] and Consuelo de Ayala.

He is married to Beatriz Miranda. Together they have two sons ([[Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala|Jaime Augusto]] and [[Fernando Zobel de Ayala|Fernando]]) and five daughters (Beatriz Susana ("Bea Jr."), Patricia, Cristina, Monica and Sofia).

==Education==

After early education in the Philippines, Zóbel attended [[Harvard University]], where he graduated in 1957 with a Bachelor of Arts in architectural sciences.  He attended the Advanced Management Program in the Far East, conducted by the Faculty from the [[Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration]] in [[Baguio]], [[Philippines]] in 1963.

==Business career==

Zóbel joined Ayala y Compañía in 1958 as executive assistant upon the invitation of his father. His father placed him under the wing of his cousin [[Enrique Zobel|Enrique]] and uncle Col. Joseph McMicking. As an executive assistant in the company, he took down notes during management meetings and gradually learned the ropes of the family business. He was later transferred to the training section of the insurance companies of the Ayala group.  In 1975, he became president of Filipinas Life Assurance Company (now, BPI-Philam Life Assurance Corporation). In 1984, he succeeded Enrique, as chairman and president of [[Ayala Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philstar.com/starweek-magazine/330709/jaime-zobel-de-ayala-artist-businessman&lt;/ref&gt; Zóbel successfully steered Ayala through the tense, final years of the [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos]] administration. In 1988, the real estate division was spun off as [[Ayala Land|Ayala Land, Inc.]] Ayala Corporation also ventured into new businesses, like automotive (Ayala Automotive Holdings Corporation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ayala.com.ph/ayalaat175mag/makati.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111172325/http://www.ayala.com.ph/ayalaat175mag/makati.html |archivedate=2013-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zóbel stepped down as president of Ayala in 1994 and was succeeded by his son, Jaime Augusto. He continued as chairman until his retirement in 2006 and became the chairman emeritus of Ayala since.

==Photography==
Zóbel joined the Camera Club of the Philippines in the mid-1970s and began taking photography more seriously.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philstar.com/sunday-life/143833/don-jaime-zobel-de-ayala-zen-and-now&lt;/ref&gt; He is the first Filipino amateur photographer to be confirmed “Licentiate” by the [[Royal Photographic Society]] of the United Kingdom, and has received similar commendations from the French and Spanish governments for his contributions to art and culture. He exhibits regularly in the Philippines and abroad, and has produced several critically acclaimed books. He continues to break new ground in art photography with explorations in various art media.

'''''Jobs''''' is a 2013 American [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[drama film|drama]] film based on the life of [[Steve Jobs]], from 1974 while a student at [[Reed College]] to the introduction of the [[iPod]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/show_story.php?id=30653/|title=Palo Alto Online Film Review: Jobs|author=Peter Canavese |publisher=Palo Alto Online|date=August 16, 2013|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is directed by [[Joshua Michael Stern]], written by Matt Whiteley, and produced by Stern and Mark Hulme. Steve Jobs is portrayed by [[Ashton Kutcher]], with [[Josh Gad]] as [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]]'s co-founder [[Steve Wozniak]]. ''Jobs'' was chosen to close the [[2013 Sundance Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="sundance"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sundance.org/festival/release/2013-sundance-film-festival-announces-films-in-premieres-and-documentary-pr/ |title=2013 Sundance Film Festival Announces Films in Premieres and Documentary Premieres |work=Sundance.org |publisher=Sundance Institute |date=December 3, 2012 |accessdate=December 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222004405/http://www.sundance.org/festival/release/2013-sundance-film-festival-announces-films-in-premieres-and-documentary-pr/ |archivedate=December 22, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gibbs"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/28/sundance-festival-jobs-first-look-review |title=Sundance film festival 2013: Jobs – first look review |date=January 28, 2013 |last=Gibbs |first=Ed |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The film opens in 2001 with a middle-aged [[Steve Jobs]] ([[Ashton Kutcher]]) introducing the [[iPod]] at an Apple Town Hall meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://everystevejobsvideo.com/original-ipod-introduction-apple-special-event-2001/|title=Original iPod introduction – Apple Special Event (2001)|last=|first=|date=|website=EverySteveJobsVideo|access-date=2017-10-09|quote=October 2001 (Location: Apple Town Hall). Steve was 46 years old.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It then flashes back to [[Reed College]] in 1974. Jobs had already dropped out due to the high expense of tuition, but was still attending classes with the approval of Dean Jack Dudman ([[James Woods]]) who took him under his wing. Jobs is particularly interested in a course on calligraphy. He meets up with his friend [[Daniel Kottke]] ([[Lukas Haas]]) who is excited to see that Jobs is holding a copy of [[Be Here Now (book)|''Be Here Now'']]'' ''by [[Ram Dass|Baba Ram Dass]]. Influenced by this book and his experiences with [[History of lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], Jobs and Kottke spend time in [[Hippie trail|India]].

Two years later, Jobs is back in [[Los Altos, California]] living at home with his adoptive parents Paul ([[John Getz]]) and Clara ([[Lesley Ann Warren]]). He is working for [[Atari]] and develops a partnership with his friend [[Steve Wozniak]] ([[Josh Gad]]) after he sees that Wozniak has built a personal computer (the [[Apple I]]). They name their new company [[Apple Computer]], though there already is a company called [[Apple Records]] that is owned by [[The Beatles]] (Wozniak then teases Jobs that this is symbolic of his preference for [[Bob Dylan]]). Wozniak gives a demonstration of the Apple I at the [[Homebrew Computer Club]]. Jobs is later approached by [[Paul Terrell]] ([[Brad William Henke]]) who shows interest in the Apple I. Knowing that he and Wozniak will need a studio in which to build them, Jobs convinces his father Paul to allow them to use the family garage (set up as a carpentry/tool center) for his new company. Realizing that they cannot build these computers alone, Jobs also recruits Kottke, [[Bill Fernandez]] ([[Victor Rasuk]]), and [[Chris Espinosa]] (Eddie Hassell) to the Apple team.&lt;ref name=slashdot/&gt;

Terrell, however, is disappointed by the Apple I, a reaction which inspires Jobs to start again with a second model. He hires [[Rod Holt]] ([[Ron Eldard]]) to reconceptualize the power supply for what would be called the [[Apple II]]. In addition, after many failed attempts, Jobs finally wins the interest of a venture capitalist, [[Mike Markkula]] ([[Dermot Mulroney]]), who also joins Apple. They release the Apple II at the 1977 [[West Coast Computer Faire]] where it is a remarkable success. Suddenly Jobs and the company are very successful.

The success also causes Jobs to distance himself from his friends and his high school girlfriend [[Chrisann Brennan]] ([[Ahna O'Reilly]]). When Brennan tells him she is pregnant with their child, he promptly ends their relationship. Brennan eventually gives birth to [[Lisa Brennan-Jobs|Lisa Brennan]] whom Jobs continues to deny as his daughter. He also brings in [[John Sculley]] ([[Matthew Modine]]) to become the CEO of the company. As his behavior becomes more erratic (for example firing an employee for not appreciating his investment in using fonts), Jobs is moved away from [[Apple Lisa|The Lisa]] to the [[Macintosh#History|Macintosh Group]] where he works with Bill Atkinson, [[Burrell Smith]] (Lenny Jacobson), Chris Espinosa, and [[Andy Hertzfeld]] ([[Elden Henson]]). He also forces the original team leader of the Macintosh group, [[Jef Raskin]], out of it. Though the Macintosh is introduced with a great deal of fanfare in 1984, Jobs is forced out of the company by Sculley in 1985.

The film jumps forward to 1996. Jobs is married to [[Laurene Powell Jobs]] ([[Abby Brammell]]) and has accepted Lisa (Annika Bertea) as his daughter (she now lives with them). He has a son, Reed (Paul Baretto) and is also running the company [[NeXT]] which Apple decides to buy. He is asked by then-CEO [[Gil Amelio]] to return to Apple as a consultant. Jobs does so and soon he is named the new CEO, ultimately firing Amelio and his ex-friend Markkula (who refused to support him when he was forced out of Apple 11 years prior). Jobs becomes interested in the work of [[Jony Ive]] (Giles Matthey) and works to reinvent Apple. The film ends with Jobs recording the [[Think Different#Text|dialogue for the ''Think Different'']] commercial in 1997. Before the credits, there are original photos of all the main characters paired with clips from the film of the actor playing the part, plus a dedication to Steve Jobs.

===Development===
[[File:Jobsmovie Los Altos.JPG|thumb|Crew filming ''Jobs'' at Steve Jobs' childhood home in [[Los Altos, California]].]]
Screenwriter Matt Whiteley began work on the screenplay around the time Steve Jobs took medical leave from Apple to battle pancreatic cancer.&lt;ref name=mercurynews/&gt; Director Joshua Michael Stern stated in an interview that all material for the screenplay was collected via research and interviews:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mark Hulme, our producer, had an expert team of researchers to comb through all public records and interviews that had anything to do with Steve Jobs. Mark, the screenwriter and the research team, also took it upon themselves to interview quite a large pool of people who either worked at Apple or worked with Steve to make sure we portrayed as accurate a portrait and telling of the events possible within the constraints of the film's length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bohemianrhapsodyclub.weebly.com/uploads/7/0/0/4/7004357/jobs_production_notes.pdf|title=Q&amp;A with JOBS director, Joshua Michael Stern|date=|author=|publisher=MELBOURNE PUBLICITY|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

We shot near the [[Red Fort]] and the famous Jama Masjid for two full days with multiple cameras spread across everywhere.

==Release==
The ''Business Insider'' described the film's opening as a [[box office flop]], earning $6.7 million in its first weekend and placed seventh overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/ashton-kutchers-steve-jobs-movie-bombed-2013-8 |title=Ashton Kutcher's Steve Jobs Movie Bombed |publisher=Business Insider |date=2013-08-19 |accessdate=2014-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''[[E! Online]]'' said, "Critics have taken the film to task for a reach that falls far short of its ambition, marred by its superficial and unsatisfying portrait of an icon who deserved better."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Loinaz | first=Alexis L. | url=http://www.eonline.com/news/449465/jobs-reviews-are-in-ashton-kutcher-s-steve-jobs-homage-not-quite-the-apple-of-critics-eyes|title=''Jobs'' Reviews Are In: Ashton Kutcher's Steve Jobs Homage Not Quite the Apple of Critics' Eyes | work=[[E! Online]] | publisher=[[E!]] | date=August 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Forbes]]'' reported that the consensus among critics was "mixed positives for Kutcher's performance" and a "thumbs down for Joshua Michael Stern's film."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Elmer-DeWitt | first=Philip | url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2013/08/16/apple-jobs-kutcher-reviews/ | title=Ashton Kutcher's ''Jobs'': What the critics are saying | work=[[Forbes]] | date=August 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a 28% rating, based on 130 reviews, with a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] of 4.9/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "An ambitious but skin-deep portrait of an influential, complex figure, ''Jobs'' often has the feel of an over-sentimentalized made-for-TV biopic."&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jobs (2013)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jobs_2013/|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Review aggregator [[Metacritic]] gave the film a score of 44 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/jobs|title=Jobs Reviews|accessdate=June 26, 2013|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert X. Cringely]], author of ''[[Accidental Empires]]'' and creator of the documentaries ''[[Triumph of the Nerds]]'' and ''[[Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview]]'', argues that "the film is beautifully shot and Kutcher's portrayal of Jobs, while not spot-on, is pretty darned good. He certainly has the look down and the walk. But Ashton Kutcher also produced this film and he's definitely a better actor than producer. There are a lot of historical inaccuracies that just don't have to be there. ... The great failing of this film is the same failing as with [[Steve Jobs (book)|Walter Isaacson's book]]: something happened during Steve's [[NeXT]] years (which occupy less than 60 seconds of this 122 minute film) that turned Jobs from a brat into a leader, but they don't bother to cover that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cringely.com/2013/08/19/ashton-kutchers-steve-jobs-somehow-misses-the-whole-point/|title=Ashton Kutcher's Steve Jobs somehow misses the whole point|date=August 19, 2013|website=cringely.com|last=Cringely|first=Robert X.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' states that "at its best, it's a good picture, and at its worst, it's almost good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Jobs-review-Kutcher-s-fine-but-film-s-timing-4735382.php|title=''Jobs'' review: Kutcher's fine, but film's timing is off|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|first=Mick|last=LaSalle|date=August 15, 2013|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' suggests that "Kutcher nails the genius and narcissism. It's a quietly dazzling performance" but also notes that "''Jobs'' is a one-man show that needed to go for broke and doesn't. My guess is that Jobs would give it a swat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/jobs-20130815|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|title=''Jobs''|first=Peter|last=Travers|date=August 15, 2013|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contributor for [[Roger Ebert|rogerebert.com]], Susan Wloszczyna, gave the movie 2/4 stars, saying that, "Rather than attempting a deeper plunge behind the whys and wherefores of the elite business-model gospel according to [[Apple Inc.]] guru Steve Jobs and – more importantly – what it says about our culture, the filmmakers follow the easy rise-fall-rise-again blueprint familiar to anyone who has seen an episode of VH1's ''Behind the Music''."&lt;ref name=RogerE&gt;{{cite web|last=Wloszczyna|first=Susan|title=Jobs|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/jobs-2013|publisher=RogerEbert.com|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She further discusses how Kutcher's performance and the overall movie failed to portray Jobs in iconic manner that current pop culture suggests even after Jobs' passing. In a movie review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', writer [[Manohla Dargis]] writes that ''Jobs'' was "inevitably unsatisfying"&lt;ref name="New York Times Movie Review"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|title=Portrait of the Artist Behind Apple Ashton Kutcher in a Biopic About Steve Jobs|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/16/movies/ashton-kutcher-in-a-biopic-about-steve-jobs.html|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a result of a poor performance of the filmmakers rather than the actors themselves.

==Historical Accuracy==
In a January 2013 interview with ''[[The Verge]]'', [[Steve Wozniak]] notes that he was approached by the crew of ''Jobs'' and given an early script to read. He read it as far as he "could stomach it and felt it was crap. [[Steve Jobs (film)|The Sony people]] got in contact with me too and in the end I went with them. You can't do both [films] and be paid."&lt;ref name=vergejan/&gt; At around the same time, he responded to the first promotional clip for the film on ''[[Gizmodo]]'' by stating that the "personalities are very wrong, although mine is closer ... our relationship was so different than what was portrayed."&lt;ref name="vergejan"&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Ross|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/26/3919472/steve-wozniak-turned-down-offer-to-work-on-jobs-after-reading-early-script/in/2794100|title=Steve Wozniak turned down offer to work on ''Jobs'' after reading early script: 'I felt it was crap'|work=[[The Verge]]|date=January 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, before the wide release of the film, Kutcher responded to these critiques in a few interviews. In an interview with the [[Associated Press]], Kutcher stated that: "Steve Wozniak is being paid by another company to support their Steve Jobs film. It's personal for him, but it's also business. We have to keep that in mind. He was also extremely unavailable to us when producing this film. He's a brilliant man and I respect his work, but he wasn't available to us as a resource, so his account isn't going to be our account because we don't know exactly what it was. We did the best job we could. Nobody really knows what happened in the rooms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/qanda-ashton-kutcher-talks-about-becoming-apple-co-founder-steve-jobs/2013/08/13/46587d3e-041c-11e3-bfc5-406b928603b2_story.html|title=Q&amp;A: Ashton Kutcher talks about becoming Apple co-founder Steve Jobs|agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=Washington Post|date=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reiterated this point in an interview with ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' by stating that Wozniak "is being paid by another movie studio to help support their Steve Jobs film, so he's gonna have an opinion that is connected to that, somewhat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carlson|first=Erin|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jobs-ashton-kutcher-responds-steve-602679|title=''Jobs'': Ashton Kutcher Responds to Steve Wozniak's Criticism of Film (Video)|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=August 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wozniak responded to Kutcher's comments as well as to the film itself on ''Gizmodo'' by stating that "either film would have paid me to consult, but the ''Jobs ''one already had a script written. I can't take that creative leadership from someone else. And I was turned off by the ''Jobs'' script. But I still hoped for a great movie." He also believed several individuals portrayed in the film were inaccurately and/or unfairly portrayed including himself and Steve Jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wozniak|first=Steve|url=https://gizmodo.com/jobs-reviewed-by-steve-wozniak-1153771108|title=''Jobs'', Reviewed by Steve Wozniak|publisher=[[Gizmodo]]|date=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wozniak reiterated these points in an interview with [[Bloomberg Television]] adding that he is "really easy to get a hold of, [Kutcher] could have called me and consulted over the phone any time."&lt;ref name=vergaug17/&gt; ''The Verge'' noted that "Wozniak was in fact invited to consult on the film, but declined after reading the script, saying he and his wife were 'abhorred' by it. Wozniak was a consultant on [[Aaron Sorkin]]'s [[Steve Jobs (film)|2015 ''Steve Jobs'' film]]. When asked why he did not at least correct the inaccuracies he saw, Wozniak said, 'I have a very busy life, and it came at a very busy time in my life.'"&lt;ref name="vergaug17"&gt;{{cite news|last=Toor|first=Amar|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/17/4630596/steve-wozniak-on-steve-jobs-movie-ashton-kutcher|title=Steve Wozniak says 'there were a lot of things wrong' with ''Jobs'' movie|work=[[The Verge]]|date=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Slashdot]]'', [[Daniel Kottke]] states that he consulted on early versions of the screenplay and notes that "Ashton's very good. I have no complaints with him at all, no complaints with his portrayal of Jobs. The complaint that people would rightly have about the film is that it portrays Woz as not having the same vision as Steve Jobs, which is really unfair." He also said that the early versions of the screenplay "were painful. Really painful. I forwarded the first draft to [[Mike Markkula]] because they wanted his feedback, and Mike took such a bad reaction to it, he wouldn't have anything more to do with the project. By the time it got to the fourth draft, it was okay. It wasn't making me cringe."&lt;ref name=slashdot/&gt; Kottke also outlines various areas that were both accurate and inaccurate in the film. [[Bill Fernandez]] was part of the same interview but states that he didn't see the film because "the whole thing is a work of fiction, and I don't want to be upset by all the things that the screenwriter has invented and don't represent the truth." Kottke responded that he didn't think of the film as fiction because "I was involved early on in the film, and they really, sincerely tried to make it as accurate as they could."&lt;ref name="slashdot"&gt;{{cite news|last=Assar|first=Vijith|url=http://insights.dice.com/2013/08/16/early-apple-employees-talk-memories-of-steve-jobs-new-movie-2/|title='Early Apple Employees Talk Memories of Steve Jobs, New Movie| work=[[Slashdot]]|date=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same interview, Fernandez and Kottke commented on the characterization of [[Rod Holt]] (portrayed by actor [[Ron Eldard]]). Kottke disputed the characterization, noting that: "What completely cracked us all up is the scene where Rod arrives for the first time. Rod comes up wearing leathers, riding up on a motorcycle with long hair ... he's like this motorcycle dude. It just cracked us all up."&lt;ref name=slashdot/&gt; Fernandez, who had not seen the film at the time of the interview, was also surprised by this portrayal. Holt, however, (according to Kottke), "thought it was hilarious."&lt;ref name=slashdot/&gt; As for why he may have been characterized this way, Kottke states that, "Rod was really into dirt bikes. And I never saw him riding one, but he talked about it all the time. So the author just had him riding up on a motorcycle. I liked that guy. I met him on the set. I had no idea who he was when I met him because he doesn't look at all like Rod, he has long straight hair and he's wearing leathers."&lt;ref name=slashdot/&gt; Fernandez, who was equally amused by this vision of Holt responded by asking, "Who could this possibly be in the Apple universe? ... It seems to me that there's a lot of fan fiction about Apple Computer and about Steve Jobs, and I think that this is the biggest, flashiest piece of fan fiction that there's been to date.
&lt;ref name=slashdot/&gt;

[[Chris Espinosa]] stated on Twitter, "FYI My position at Apple precludes my commenting on the #JobsMovie with the press or public. But I can say that I enjoyed watching the film."&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/cdespinosa/status/368618820409126914 Chris Espinosa@Twitter]. August 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The TV show ''[[John Wants Answers]]'' took Wozniak, Kottke, and [[Andy Hertzfeld]] through the film scene by scene and discussed how the events actually occurred.&lt;ref name="johnwants"&gt;{{cite news|last=Vink|first=John|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gICwMQQ48Dk|title=The Cast of ''Jobs''|work=[[John Wants Answers]]|publisher=KMVT 15|date=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Original soundtrack ==
A number of [[classic rock]], [[classical music]], and contemporary works appeared in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2357129/soundtrack|title=Jobs (2013)|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commercial film soundtrack focuses on an original score by John Debney and includes some but not all of the classical and [[classic rock]] works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Jobs-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B00EIRCJBO |title='&amp;#39;JOBS'&amp;#39;: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Paul Getty III''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|ɛ|t|i}}; November 4/5, 1956 – February 5, 2011), was the grandson of American oil tycoon [[J. Paul Getty]]. While living in Rome in 1973, he was kidnapped for a $17 million ransom. His grandfather was reluctant to pay, as it could have put his other grandchildren in danger. After his severed ear was received by a newspaper, a deal was done, and Getty was released. He developed drug and alcohol addiction, leading to paraplegia
for life.

==Early life==
Getty was born in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]].&lt;ref name="T obit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8309645/John-Paul-Getty-III.html |title=Getty obituary |work=The Daily Telegraph|date= |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mail"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1354353/John-Paul-Getty-III-dies-54-paralysed-30-years.html |title=Finally He Is Out Of Pain: Tragic Oil Heir, John Paul Getty III, Dies at 54, After Being Paralyzed For 30 years |work=Daily Mail |date=7 February 2011 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/obituary-john-paul-getty-iii-grandson-of-oil-tycoon-who-had-ear-cut-off-in-kidnapping-1-1500341|title=Obituary: John Paul Getty III, grandson of oil tycoon, who had ear cut off in kidnapping|work=[[The Scotsman]]|date=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent most of his childhood in Rome while [[John Paul Getty Jr.|his father]] headed the Italian division of the [[Getty family]] oil business. His parents divorced in 1964 when he was eight years old, and his father married model and actress [[Talitha Getty|Talitha Pol]] in 1966. The family adopted a hippie lifestyle, spending much time in Britain and Morocco during the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://dossierjournal.com/style/fashion/talitha-getty-the-myth-and-the-muse/|title=Style » Talitha Getty: The Myth and the Muse|publisher=Dossier Journal|date=|accessdate=1 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222110046/http://dossierjournal.com/style/fashion/talitha-getty-the-myth-and-the-muse/|archive-date=22 February 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Getty remained in Italy with his mother Gail and attended [[St. George's British International School]] in Rome.&lt;ref name="sanchez"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Tony|last=Sanchez|title=Up and Down with the Rolling Stones: The Inside Story|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1996|pages=242|isbn=0-306-80711-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In early 1972, Getty was expelled from St. George's after painting offensive six-feet high wording in a hallway of the school, aimed at the school's headmaster. Later that year, his stepmother died of a heroin overdose in Rome,&lt;ref name="sanchez"/&gt; and his father moved back to the [[United Kingdom]], partly to escape charges of drug possession which he was facing in Italy. Paul remained in Italy where he lived a bohemian lifestyle, living in a [[Squatting|squat]], frequenting nightclubs and taking part in left-wing demonstrations. He had considerable artistic talent and reportedly earned a living making jewelry, selling his paintings and cartoons, and appearing in movies as an extra.&lt;ref name="nytimesObit"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/world/europe/08gettyobit.html J.

== Kidnapping ==
Getty was kidnapped in the [[Palazzo Farnese]] in Rome at 3 a.m. on July 10, 1973, when he was 16.&lt;ref name="T obit"/&gt; According to his girlfriend Martine Schmidt, he had toyed with the idea of getting himself kidnapped by petty criminals when the couple were struggling to make ends meet, but he had changed his mind because both of them started getting work modelling for photographers. She stated that "Paul didn't want to be kidnapped anymore, but [the kidnappers] were following him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/04/trust-fx-john-paul-getty-kidnapping| title=Trust: Did Paul Getty Really Stage His Kidnapping, as 'Trust' Suggests?| author=Julie Miller| publisher=Vanity Fair| date=8 April 2018| access-date=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was blindfolded, transported, and imprisoned in a cave.&lt;ref name="Gucci2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patricia Gucci|title=In the Name of Gucci: A Memoir|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xdNfCgAAQBAJ|date=10 May 2016|publisher=Crown/Archetype|isbn=978-0-8041-3894-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kidnappers issued a ransom note demanding $17 million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US|17000001|1973|r=-6}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}) in exchange for his safe return. When that message arrived, some family members suspected that the kidnapping was merely a ploy by Getty.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The kidnappers sent a second demand, but its arrival was delayed by an Italian postal strike.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/1427781/Sir-Paul-Getty-obituary.html|title=Sir Paul Getty|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=17 April 2003|accessdate=1 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Paul Getty Jr.]] asked his father [[J. Paul Getty]] for the money, but his father refused, arguing that his 13 other grandchildren could also become kidnap targets if he paid.&lt;ref name="nytimesObit"/&gt; As time wore on, Paul's treatment by his captors grew worse; they took away his radio, killed a bird that he had taken as a pet, and began playing [[Russian roulette]] against his head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/04/trust-fx-brendan-fraser| title=Trust: The Story Behind Brendan Fraser's Brilliant, Oddball Character| author=Julie Miller| publisher=Vanity Fair| date=1 April 2018| access-date=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1973, a daily newspaper received an envelope containing a lock of hair, a human ear, and a threat from the kidnappers to mutilate Paul further unless they were paid $3.2 million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US|3200000|1973|r=-5}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}). The letter read, "This is Paul's first ear. If within ten days the family still believes that this is a joke mounted by him, then the other ear will arrive. In other words, he will arrive in little bits."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/07/AR2011020706089.html Washington Post, report on Getty's death], 7 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Paul's health began to decline rapidly as his wound became infected, combined with pneumonia caused by the cold winter temperatures which were descending. His captors were alarmed at this sudden decline and gave him large doses of [[penicillin]] to treat the infection, which caused him to develop an allergy to the antibiotic and further affected his health.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich|first=John|last=Pearson| year=1995| p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Getty's biographer [[John Pearson (author)|John Pearson]] attributed his later alcoholism to the large amounts of brandy that he was plied with in the last few months of his captivity to keep him warm and numb his pain.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;
 
After Paul's ear was sent, his grandfather negotiated a deal to get him back for about $2.9 million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US|2900000|1973|r=-5}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}). He paid $2.2 million—the maximum amount that was tax deductible—and lent the remainder to his son, who was responsible for repaying the sum at 4% interest.&lt;ref name="NYT Obituary"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/world/europe/08gettyobit.html J. Paul Getty III, 54, Dies; Had Ear Cut Off by Captors], ''The New York Times'', 7 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Paul was found alive on  December 15, 1973, in a petrol station of [[Lauria]] in the [[province of Potenza]] shortly after the ransom was paid.&lt;ref name="tim280174"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,911066,00.html Catching the Kidnappers], ''Time'', 28 January 1974&lt;/ref&gt; At his mother's suggestion, he called his grandfather to thank him for paying the ransom, but J. Paul Getty refused to come to the phone.&lt;ref name="NYT Obituary"/&gt;

Nine of the kidnappers were apprehended, including [[Girolamo Piromalli]] and [[Saverio Mammoliti]], high-ranking members of the [['Ndrangheta]], a Mafia organization in [[Calabria]].&lt;ref name=tim280174/&gt; Two of the kidnappers were convicted and sent to prison; the others were acquitted for lack of evidence, including the 'Ndrangheta bosses. Most of the ransom money was never recovered.&lt;ref name="NYT Obituary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="L.A. Times"&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-john-paul-getty-iii-20110208,0,1147525.story "J. Paul Getty III dies at 54; scion of oil dynasty"], ''Los Angeles Times'', 7 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, Getty had an operation to rebuild the ear that his kidnappers had cut off.&lt;ref name="T obit"/&gt;

==Later life and death==
In 1974, Getty married German Gisela Martine Zacher (née Schmidt) who was five months pregnant. He had known her and her twin sister Jutta since before his kidnapping, and he was 18 years old when his son [[Balthazar Getty|Balthazar]] was born in 1975. The couple divorced in 1993.&lt;ref name="T obit"/&gt;

Getty acted in some European films, playing supporting parts in [[Raúl Ruiz (director)|Raúl Ruiz]]'s ''[[The Territory]]'' and in [[Wim Wenders]]'s ''[[The State of Things (film)|The State of Things]]''.&lt;ref name="TelegraphObituary"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8309645/John-Paul-Getty-III.html John Paul Getty III obituary], ''The Daily Telegraph'', (London). 7 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He and his wife lived for a time in New York City where they consorted with [[Andy Warhol]]'s art crowd.&lt;ref name="NYT Obituary"/&gt;

Getty was permanently affected by his kidnapping and suffered from drug and alcohol addiction during the years that followed.&lt;ref name="NYT Obituary"/&gt; In 1981, he drank a [[Valium]], [[methadone]], and alcohol cocktail which caused liver failure and a stroke, leaving him quadriplegic, partially blind, and unable to speak.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/world/europe/08gettyobit.html J. Paul Getty III, 54, Dies; Had Ear Cut Off by Captors] ''The New York Times'', 7 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2956897.stm "Obituary for John Paul Getty II"], BBC News, 17 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, his mother cared for him, and he sued his father for $28,000 a month to cover his medical needs.&lt;ref name="NYT Obituary"/&gt; He never fully recovered and remained severely handicapped for the rest of his life. By 1987, however, he was able to regain some degree of autonomy, and he was able to ski when strapped to a metal frame.&lt;ref name="TelegraphObituary"/&gt;

In 1999, Getty and several other members of his family became citizens of the [[Republic of Ireland]] in return for investments of approximately £1 million each, under a law which has since been repealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.innewstoday.net/jean-paul-getty-iii-dead-5-facts-on-the-oil-heir-and-father-of-actor-balthazar-getty/ |title=Jean Paul Getty III Dead; 5 Facts on the Oil Heir and Father of Actor Balthazar Getty |publisher=In News Today |date=8 February 2011 |accessdate=1 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320030149/http://www.innewstoday.net/jean-paul-getty-iii-dead-5-facts-on-the-oil-heir-and-father-of-actor-balthazar-getty/ |archive-date=20 March 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Getty died at his father's estate at [[Wormsley Park]], [[Buckinghamshire]], on February 5, 2011, aged 54, following a long illness. He had been in poor health since his 1981 drug overdose.&lt;ref name="Mail"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
[[A. J. Quinnell]] used Getty's kidnapping as one piece of inspiration for his book ''[[Man on Fire (Quinnell novel)|Man on Fire]]''.&lt;ref name="Davies221"&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Nancy|editor-last=Billias|author-last=Davies|author-first=Paul|title=Promoting and Producing Evil|chapter=Be not overcome by evil but overcome evil with good': The Theology of Evil in ''Man on Fire''|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TsHbw1FfQx4C&amp;pg=PA221#v=onepage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TsHbw1FfQx4C|year=2010|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=90-420-2939-0|pages=219–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1995 book ''Painfully Rich: the Outrageous Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Heirs of J.

[[File:Count Zborowski With Chitty Bang Bang 1 At Brooklands.jpg|thumb|300px|Louis Zborowski in the driving seat of ''[[Chitty Bang Bang|Chitty Bang Bang 1]]'' at [[Brooklands]]]]
Count '''Louis Vorow Zborowski''' (20 February 1895 – 19 October 1924) was an English racing driver and automobile engineer.

==Background==
His father, [[Eliot Zborowski|William Eliot Morris Zborowski]] (1858–1903) was also a racing driver, and died in a racing crash, in 1903 at [[La Turbie]] Hillclimb in [[Nice]], France. His mother was a wealthy American [[Beneficiary|heiress]], born Margaret Laura Astor Carey (1853–1911), a granddaughter of [[William Backhouse Astor, Sr.]] and Margaret Rebecca Armstrong of the prominent [[Astor family]]. She had been Madame de Stuers before her divorce and marriage in 1892 to Eliot Zborowski.

==Early life==
[[File:Louis Vorow Zborrowski by Julian Russell Story (1857-1919).jpg|thumb|upright|Louis Zborowski as child ([[Julian Russell Story]], 1898)]]
After the death of his father in 1903, in 1910 his mother bought the [[Higham Park]] estate at [[Bridge, Kent|Bridge]] near [[Canterbury]] in Kent. Paying £17,500 to the executors of the estate of London banker William Gay, the sale included a farm, {{convert|225|acre}} and twelve houses.&lt;ref name=Telg3334542/&gt; Mrs. Zborowski immediately commissioned a £50,000 refurbishment of the house from the architect Joseph Sawyer.&lt;ref name=Telg3334542/&gt;

On her death in 1911, 16-year-old Louis instantly became the fourth richest under-21-year-old in the world, with cash of £11 million and real estate in the United States, including {{convert|7|acre}} of [[Manhattan]] and several blocks on [[Fifth Avenue]], New York.&lt;ref name=Telg3334542&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/3334542/57-rooms-down-30-more-to-go....html|title=57 rooms down, 30 more to go.....|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=28 August 2004|accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early racing career==
Zborowski's career as an amateur racing driver encompassed a wide experience of marques and events. He was an early patron of [[Aston Martin]], and raced for them at [[Brooklands]] and in the [[1923 French Grand Prix]]. In 1921 Zborowski was to drive one of the [[Grand Prix Sunbeams 1921, 1922 TT|1921 Grand Prix Sunbeams]] representing Britain at [[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] but this did not transpire and instead he raced the car at the International [[Shelsley Walsh Speed Hill Climb|Shelsley Walsh]] - England’s foremost Speed Hill-Climb.&lt;ref&gt;May, C.A.N. (1945). Shelsley Walsh, England’s International Speed Hill-Climb. P25, 28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Car designs==
Zborowski designed and built four of his own racing cars in the stables at Higham Park, assisted by his engineer and co-driver Captain [[Clive Gallop]], who was later racing engineer to the "[[Bentley Boys]]".

The first car was powered by a 23,093&amp;nbsp;cc six-cylinder Maybach aero engine and called "[[Chitty Bang Bang]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second "[[Chitty Bang Bang]]" was powered by 18,825&amp;nbsp;cc [[Benz Bz.IV|Benz aero engine]]. A third car was based on a Mercedes 28/95, but fitted with a 14,778&amp;nbsp;cc 6-cylinder Mercedes aero engine and was referred to as the White Mercedes. These cars achieved some success at Brooklands.

Another car, also built at Higham Park with a huge 27-litre American [[Liberty L-12|Liberty]] aero engine, was called the "Higham Special". After Zborowski's death the "Higham Special" was purchased by [[J.G. Parry-Thomas]] to make bids on the [[land speed record]]. Designer/driver Thomas improved the car and christened her "[[Babs (Land speed record car)|Babs]]". In April 1926 [[J.G. Parry-Thomas]] successfully took the Land Speed Record at over 170&amp;nbsp;mph at [[Pendine Sands]]. Thomas' second attempt at the same location in 1927 turned out fatal. At over 100&amp;nbsp;mph the car overturned and caught fire, killing the driver. "[[Babs (Land speed record car)|Babs]]" has been restored and can be seen either at the [[Pendine Sands]] museum of speed in the summer months or in the [[Brooklands Museum]] during other months of the year.

In January 1922 Louis, his wife Vi, Clive Gallop and Pixi Marix together with a couple of mechanics took Chitty Bang Bang 2 and the White Mercedes across the Mediterranean for a drive into the Sahara Desert, in the tracks of [[Citroën]]'s [[Kégresse track|Kégresse-track]]-equipped expedition.

==Later career and death==
In the 1923 [[Indianapolis 500]] Zborowski drove a [[Bugatti]]. He drove in the 1923 [[Italian Grand Prix]] at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]] in a car designed by American engineer [[Harry Arminius Miller]], the single-seat "American Miller 122".

Zborowski joined the [[Mercedes-Benz in motorsport|Mercedes]] team in 1924 but died in one of their cars, after hitting a tree during the [[1924 Italian Grand Prix|Italian Grand Prix]] at Monza. He was just 29 years old.

==Legacy==
Zborowski was a railway enthusiast and a {{RailGauge|15in}} gauge railway circuit, the Higham Railway, was built around his estate in Kent. This line was part of the inspiration behind the joint decision by Zborowski and his racing friend Captain J.E.P. Howey to construct a long-distance passenger-carrying railway line in the same gauge. Many locations were investigated, but this eventually led to the founding of the {{convert|14|mi|km|adj=on}} long [[Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway]] in Kent, which remains a popular tourist attraction and means of local transport. Zborowski ordered a steam locomotive from [[Bassett-Lowke]], which ran on the Higham Railway in 1924. The locomotive was purchased by the [[Fairbourne Railway]] in Wales following the Count's death and named "Count Louis" in his honour. The locomotive remained at the Fairbourne until 1988. Zborowski also ordered the first locomotives for the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway from [[Davey Paxman &amp; Co.]] of [[Essex]]. The order (and the project) was continued by Capt Howey alone, following the Count's death.

The children's book by [[Ian Fleming]], ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (novel)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'', and the subsequent [[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (film)|musical film]], were inspired by the romance of Zborowski's exploits. Fleming had watched Zborowski race at [[Brooklands]] as a school boy, and later visited Higham  Park (then known as Highland Court) as a friend of its later owner, Walter Whigham the chairman of [[Robert Fleming &amp; Co.]] [[merchant bank]] founded by Ian's grandfather.&lt;ref name=Telg3334542/&gt; In the third book, Zborowski is a major character, where his relationship to Chitty is explored and his future deadly crash is alluded to.

In November 2014 his post became the '''Minister for Business, Energy and Tourism''', as part of the [[first Sturgeon government]]. The post was retitled as '''Minister for Business, Innovation and Energy''' as part of the [[second Sturgeon government]], and renamed again in June 2018 to Business, Fair Work and Skills.&lt;ref name="june2018"/&gt;

The NDIA publishes a magazine, the ''[[National Defense (magazine)|National Defense]]'', and holds over 80 symposia a year.

==Organization==
The group  has approximately 1,600 corporate members and over 65,000 individual and government members. Affiliated members include the [[Association for Enterprise Information]] (AFEI), the [[National Training and Simulation Association]] (NTSA), the [[Precision Strike Association]] (PSA), and [[Women in Defense (organisation)|Women in Defense]] (WID). It connects government officials, military and industry professionals, and organizations that represent the branches of the [[US military|armed forces]], homeland security, and first responders. It has divisions and working groups covering several niche areas. Its members often use the organization to forge business contacts through networking and participating in national   and local events.

Logistics, policy, combat, and acquisition form the base for most symposia, over 80 are held annually. Defense professionals from the private industry, government, military and first responders from the public and private sectors attend these programs for information from subject matter experts and to make contacts in industry and government. About 25 exhibitions each year include defense-related industry and government exhibits. These events and exhibitions are designed to facilitate information sharing and networking opportunities.

The association publishes a magazine, the ''[[National Defense (magazine)|National Defense]]''. Recently, they created a STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) Division,  promoting educational opportunities for   youth to ensure a skilled technical work force, and   developing cutting-edge manufacturing techniques to support the military industry.&lt;ref name="TID"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tradeandindustrydev.com/issues/ID-385-article.aspx|title=NDIA Expands Opportunities for Defense Professionals |last=Farrell Jr.|first=Lawrence P. |publisher=Trade and Industry Development|accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Technical Information Division has responsibility for the NDIA configuration and data management (CDM) professional certification program. This   includes preparation training for certification, the administration of examinations, and the award of certifications. NDIA has established two CDM certification levels: Certified Configuration and Data Manager (CCDM) and Certified Configuration and Data Specialist (CCDS).

==Chapters==
{{As of|2009}}, NDIA has 28 chapters across the United States.&lt;ref name="chapter_presidents"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndia.org/MembershipAndChapters/NDIAChapters/Pages/NDIA_Chapter_Presidents.aspx|title=NDIA Chapter Presidents|publisher=National Defense Industrial Association|accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Divisions ==
NDIA consists of 28 Divisions and seven Industrial Working Groups that aims to promote defense through access, influence and education.&lt;ref name="divisions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndia.org/DIVISIONS/Pages/default.aspx|title=Divisions|publisher=National Defense Industrial Association|accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Naushad N. Merali, CBS''' (born 2 January 1951 in [[Nairobi]], Kenya) is the founder of the Kenyan mobile service provider [http://kencell.co.ke Kencell] along with French media giant [[Vivendi]].&lt;ref name="merali"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/mfonobongnsehe/2011/11/16/10-african-millionaires-to-watch/ ''Naushad Merali''] information at Forbes.com&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Highway Secondary School]] in the suburbs of [[Nairobi]], Kenya. As one of Kenya's leading [[industrialists]], Merali has brought commercial development in Kenya for more than 30 years and is constantly expanding his businesses throughout East Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.changes-challenges.org/NMerali ''Naushad M. Merali''] information at Changes-Challenges.org&lt;/ref&gt;

His wife is Zarin Merali, who is a director for the Kenyan Paraplegic Organisation.&lt;ref name="orgstructure"&gt;[http://www.kenyanparaplegic.com/about-us/organization-structure.html?start=1 ''Zarin Merali''] information at KenyanParalegic.com&lt;/ref&gt; She is also an interior design consultant.&lt;ref name="orgstructure"/&gt;

Merali's ancestors were believed to have emigrated from the state of [[Gujarat]] in what is now known as [[India]]. His mother's maiden name is assumed to be [[Patel]]; a surname occupied by famous Indian businessmen and 33% of all American mid-sized hotel owners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kenyanentrepreneur.com/naushad-merali-who-is-this-man?cid=71065 ''Maybe he is a Patel, I hear Indian …''] at Kenyan Entrepreneur&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kamdar"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamdar|first=Mira|title=Planet India: how the fastest-growing democracy is transforming America and the world|year=2007|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-9685-4|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RFPlNrRxaFMC&amp;pg=PA29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ungar|first=Sanford J.|title=Fresh blood: the new American immigrants|year=1998|publisher=U of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-06702-0|page=32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mwUWHicTMZsC&amp;pg=PA32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
From the 1980s to March 2005, Merali was the director of the now-defunct W.P.H. Kenya Tea company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marsgroupkenya.org/pdfs/august_07/KTM/KTM_report_page_94.pdf ''Report page for W.P.H. Kenya Tea 1994''] at Mars Group Kenya&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, he managed to purchase 60% ownership of the business from Vivendi for $230&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="merali"/&gt; Merali would transfer ownership only an hour later to [[Celtel]] for a $20&amp;nbsp;million profit.&lt;ref name="merali"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balancingact-africa.com/news/en/issue-no-210/money/the-celtel-purchase/en ''THE CELTEL PURCHASE OF KENCELL – THE STORY BEHIND THE DEAL''] at BalancingAct-Africa.com&lt;/ref&gt; While owning 5% of [[Bharti Airtel]]'s Kenyan wireless phone operations, Merali spends his time steering the affairs of the [[Sameer Group]].&lt;ref name="merali"/&gt; The Sameer Group is a [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] of 15 Kenyan companies that range from financial services to agriculture and even information technology.&lt;ref name="merali"/&gt; Three of these companies appear on the [[Nairobi Stock Exchange]] and Merali is worth $210&amp;nbsp;million as of 2 November 2011.&lt;ref name="merali"/&gt; He is reported to have shares in the [[Commercial Bank of Africa]] as of 2003.&lt;ref name="wapratio"&gt;[http://wap.ratio-magazine.com/inner.php?id=266 ''Kenya: Libyan Government to Purchase Equatorial Commercial Bank''] at Ratio-Magazine.com&lt;/ref&gt; Merali's purchase of the Grand Regency Hotel during that year caused a lot of controversy in the Kenya area.&lt;ref name="wapratio"/&gt;

Merali also holds positions at the ''Kenya Export Promotion Council'', the ''International Who's Who of Professionals'', and the ''National Investment Council of Kenya''.&lt;ref name="sameergroup"&gt;[http://www.sameer-group.com/inner.asp?cat=mgmt&amp;pcat=about ''Naushad Merali''] career information at Sameer-Group.com&lt;/ref&gt; The President of Kenya has appointed him to positions such as membership in the ''Kenya Export Promotion Council'', membership in ''The National Poverty Eradication Commission of Kenya'', and membership in ''The Presidential Committee on Employment''.&lt;ref name="sameergroup"/&gt; He appeared at the 2011 [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos]] as one of the African delegates along – making him one of the three Kenyan delegates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abndigital.com/page/micro-sites/davos-2011/south-african-delegates/index List of Africa delegates at the 2011 World Economic Forum] at ABNDigital.com&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2011, [[Kenya Data Networks]] – one of his business ventures – is facing financial problems and the shareholders are ready to cause a shakedown in the entire management team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/InsidePage.php?id=2000043539&amp;cid=457 ''Merali's Midas Touch''] at StandardMedia.co.ke&lt;/ref&gt; These financial problems came to frutition by 2013 when Merali relinquished control of the company.

In 2012, Merali invested in construction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africaintelligence.com/ION/business-circles/2012/03/24/naushad-merali-tempted-by-property,99999054-ART ''Naushad Merali tempted by property''] at Africa Intelligence&lt;/ref&gt; Two of Merali's former firms, [[Kenya Data Networks]] and Swift Global are in the process of being merged into Great Britain's Liquid Telecoms as of February 2013. Many executive positions could be declared redundant as a result of this multinational merger. Both retail and wholesale services for the lower end of the consumer spectrum were provided by both of these firms as individual companies; as rival Internet service provider [[Safaricom]] already had a firm grasp on the upper end of the market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Corporate-News/UK-firm-seeks-nod-to-merge-former-Merali-companies/-/539550/1694490/-/wf61dwz/-/index.html ''UK firm seeks regulator’s nod to merge former Merali companies''] at Business Daily Africa&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Northern bleached softwood kraft''' ('''NBSK''') is the paper industry's benchmark grade of [[wood pulp|pulp]]. Market NBSK is produced mainly in Canada and the [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] countries. Some NBSK is also produced in north-western United States and in Russia. NBSK [[Futures contract|futures]] are traded on the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]].

==Properties==
This [[Pulp (paper)|pulp]] grade is very diverse. All NBSK pulps have long fibers and is often used as reinforcement pulp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Nanko | first = Hirko |author2=Button, Allan |author3=Hillman, Dave | title = The World of Market Pulp | publisher = WOMP, LLC | year = 2005 | location = Appleton, WI, USA | pages = 10–13 | url =  | doi =  | id =  | isbn = 0-615-13013-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NBSK from [[British Columbia]] is mainly from Lodgepole Pine, with a significant amount of White Spruce. [[Western Red Cedar|Redcedar]], [[douglas fir]], [[Tsuga|hemlock]], and [[larch]] make up a smaller portion of the chip furnish.  NBSK is known for having longer fiber lengths and larger fiber diameter than anywhere else in the world due to very long growing season and mild climate.

NBSK from [[Siberia]] is made from [[pine]], spruce and [[european larch]] and tend to be shorter and thinner than other NBSK pulps due to the short growing season. The larch makes up about 15% of the wood furnish and gives a rather coarse fiber that makes Siberian NBSK less desirable as reinforcement pulp.

The only single species NBSK is of plantation [[Radiata pine]] from New Zealand, [[Brazil]] and [[Chile]]. It has good brightness and cleanliness that is appreciated in [[printing and writing paper]]s.

NBSK from [[Scandinavia]] is only from [[scots pine]] and [[norway spruce]] in the normal mix 7:3. The mix might vary much with the season as norway spruce grows on wetter lands that is easier accessed in the winter when the ground is frozen.

==Applications==
The most common use of NBSK is as reinforcement fibres when making [[paper]] or as raw material for [[kraft paper]]. It is also used in [[tissue paper]].

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Pcb3.jpg|thumb|right|Pierre Bellanger]] --&gt;
'''Pierre Bellanger''' (born 1958) is founder and CEO of [[Skyrock (radio)|Skyrock]], a French commercial radio station, and founder of [[skyrock (social network site)|skyrock.com]], a French-language social network.

== Biography ==
Bellanger created Skyrock in 1985 as a national FM station in France. Today, it ranks as the country's most popular radio station among 13- to 24-year-olds, with four million listeners each day.

As a biology student in late 1970s Paris, Bellanger participated in the [[Pirate radio|free radio]] movement that helped to topple the state's monopoly on broadcasting. Since then, as an entrepreneur in media and Internet, he has created a TV station, several radio stations, as well as numerous cable and satellite services. His interactive experience began in the mid-1980s with the [[Minitel]] and phone services. His first Internet company was created in 1994 as a joint venture with France Telecom.

Bellanger is the author of two books: ''The Future of Radio'' (1992) and ''La convergence, c'est le code''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skyrock.fm/bellanger/la_convergence_c_est_le_code.pdf La convergence, c'est le code]&lt;/ref&gt; (2003). In 2006, the French Ministry of Culture and Communication named him to the Counsel for Strategic Analysis of Cultural and Communications Industries.

In 2004, Bellanger helped to spearhead the French government's introduction of the Dispositif Alerte-Enlèvement, modeled on the North American [[AMBER Alert]] systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1851">The '''American Progressive Bag Alliance''' (APBA) represents the U.S. plastic bag manufacturing and recycling industry, which employs nearly 25,000 workers in 40 states. Founded in 2005, the APBA proactively promotes product lines and leads numerous public policy initiatives that serve as the frontline defense against plastic bag bans and taxes nationwide.

With the support of the industry’s workers, the APBA promotes American-made plastic products that are the smartest, most environmentally-friendly choice at the checkout counter for both retailers and consumers.

==Activities==
Plastic retail bags – the kind you get from your grocer or at the corner store — are being targeted for bans and taxes in communities around the country. Bans and taxes have a negative impact on working families and seniors on fixed incomes, but they don’t help the environment in any meaningful way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bagtheban.com/learn-the-facts/environment/|title=Plastic Bags and the Environment|last=|first=|date=|website=Bag the Ban|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the support of the industry’s workers, the APBA works throughout the country to promote American-made plastic products that are the smartest, most environmentally-friendly&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.mst.dk/Udgiv/publications/2018/02/978-87-93614-73-4.pdf|title=Life cycle assessment of grocery carrier bags|last=|first=|date=February 2018|website=Ministry of Environment and Food of Denmark|publisher=The Danish Environmental Protection Agency|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; choice at the checkout counter for both retailers and consumers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2445">'''Raymond Pitcairn''' (1885 – July 12, 1966), son of [[PPG Industries]] founder [[John Pitcairn, Jr.|John Pitcairn]], was a lawyer, a businessman, a collector of ancient and medieval art, and an amateur architect. He supervised the building of the [[Bryn Athyn Cathedral]] and his own castle-mansion of [[Glencairn Museum|Glencairn]].&lt;ref name="dynasty"&gt;{{Citation | last = Jaffe | first = Dennis T. | author-link =  | last2 = Jungé | first2 = Dirk | author2-link =  | last3 = Paul | first3 = Joseph | title = Reinventing a family dynasty | journal = : Family Business Magazine | volume =  | issue = Winter | pages =  | date =  | year = 2004 | url = http://www.dennisjaffe.com/articles/PitcairnFamily.pdf | doi =  | id =  | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt; | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090106042717/http://www.dennisjaffe.com/articles/PitcairnFamily.pdf | archivedate = 2009-01-06 | df =  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitcairn was also quite politically active. A Republican, he served as one of the delegates to Pennsylvania's convention to ratify the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment]] in 1933, and was one of Pennsylvania's delegates to the [[1956 Republican National Convention]].

The [[Office of the Telecommunications Authority]] (OFTA) is the legislative body responsible for regulating the [[telecommunications]] industry in Hong Kong. The OFTA has liberalized all telecom sectors and there are no foreign ownership restrictions. 

In the local fixed-line market there is neither a pre-set limit on the number of licenses issued nor deadline for applications. {{As of|2004}}, there are nine [[fixed-line]] licensees: [[PCCW-HKT]], [[New World Telephone Limited]], [[Wharf T &amp; T Limited]], [[Hutchison Global Crossing Limited]], [[Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited]], [[Eastar Technology Limited]], [[CM Tel. (HK) Limited]], [[TraxComm Limited]] and [[HKC Network Limited]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Lai, D. Murphy, "Hong Kong’s Telecommunications Industry", Stat-USA Market Research Reports. 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the telephone density is, with 56 lines per 100 people, among the highest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;"Hong Kong: The Facts. Telecommunications", Information Services Department. Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government. 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2004}} there are 197 licensed [[Internet Service Provider]]s (ISP) in Hong Kong, providing [[dial-up]] or broadband services. Hong Kong is the second after [[South Korea]] in terms of broadband penetration rate (53%).

With regard to mobile services, the OFTA awarded four [[3G]] licenses in 2001: [[Hong Kong CSL Limited]], [[Hutchison 3G (HK) Limited]], [[SmartTone 3G Limited]] and [[Sunday 3G (HK) Limited]] The first 3G mobile services were launched in January 2004.&lt;ref&gt;"Hong Kong: The Facts. Telecommunications", Information Services Department. Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government. 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, these four 3G operators, together with [[New World Mobility]] and [[Peoples Telephone Company Limited]] operate a total of eleven [[GSM]] networks. Thus the mobile density {{As of|2004|lc=on}} is one of the highest in the world (106.3%).&lt;ref&gt;"Hong Kong: The Facts. Telecommunications", Information Services Department.

'''Victor Roberto Muller''' (born September 13, 1959) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] businessman, founder of [[Spyker Cars]], [[CEO]] of [[Spyker N.V.]], and former Chairman and CEO of [[Saab Automobile|Saab Automobile AB]].&lt;ref name=Muller /&gt;

==Education and early career==
Muller studied Law at [[Leiden University]]. After graduating with an [[Master of Laws|LL.M.]] degree in 1984, he became a lawyer for the [[Amsterdam]] office of law firm [[Baker &amp; McKenzie]]. In 1989, he joined the management team of [[offshore company]] [[Heerema]] in [[Leiden]]. A management buyout made him part owner of salvage and towing company Wijsmuller in [[IJmuiden]]. From 1992 onwards, Muller led several companies, such as ''[[Emergo Mode Groep]]'' (Emergo Fashion Group), which would be launched on the [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]] as [[McGregor Fashion Group]].

==Spyker Cars==
Muller and [[Maarten de Bruijn]] bought the name to the Dutch car company [[Spyker Cars]] in 2000, renewing the Spyker name which had been used surrounding car production in the 1920s. Muller was the CEO of the company until May 16, 2007, when he was succeeded by [[Michiel Mol]]. Muller continued to work for the company as chief designer for a period, but returned to the CEO seat later the same year, due to the split up between Spyker Cars and [[Spyker F1]] (later [[Force India]]) while Mol continued as CEO for the latter.

Muller was found guilty of sharing insider information in 2007. He sent an email to bank Theodoor Gilissen, requesting they not sell shares used as security for a personal loan. In the email Muller stated that Spyker would soon release a favourable press-release, which would increase the value of his shares. Victor Muller was initially fined €96,000. The fine was reduced in May 2012 to €11,400.&lt;ref name="Mynewsdesk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/pressroom/ekerlids_forlag_ab/pressrelease/view/ny-bok-cirkus-muller-av-jens-b-nordstroem-604968 |title=Ekerlids Förlag AB - Ny bok: Cirkus Muller av Jens B Nordström |publisher=Mynewsdesk |date=2011-03-26 |accessdate=2012-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 December 2014 Spyker NV was granted a financial restructuring by the Dutch court "Midden Nederland". Spyker needs protection from creditors for its liquidity problems. Victor R. Muller, Spyker founder and chief executive, said “Over the past few years, Spyker has faced a number of serious difficulties and challenges resulting from, among others, the legacy of the F1 era and the acquisition of Saab Automobile AB,”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://online.wsj.com/articles/dutch-sports-car-maker-spyker-files-for-restructuring-1417539150/
|title= Dutch Sports-Car Maker Spyker Files for Restructuring|date=2014-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 December 2014 Spyker NV was declared bankrupt by the Dutch court "Midden Nederland". Victor R. Muller, Spyker founder and chief executive, said “In 2000 our objective was to found a global sports car manufacturer, and we did just that. During this time we deployed several challenging activities. These have affected the company , and contributed to our decline,”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bnr.nl/radio/bnr-nationale-autoshow/674396-1412/sportwagenfabrikant-spyker-failliet/
|title= Sportwagenfabrikant Spyker failliet|date=2014-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once in an interview with Tech Toys 360 by Channel Discovery Science, he told that the first word he said in his childhood was Car. He was interested in cars from his childhood. He started collecting cars before he got driving lincence. He was much passionated about cars that it seems he was born just for car

==Saab Automobile AB==
Muller was also the chairman of the company [[Spyker N.V.|Swedish Automobile]], which was formed after the takeover of [[Saab Automobile]] by [[Spyker Cars]]. Saab Automobile was declared bankrupt in December 2011. A meeting on Saab's bankruptcy was held at the District Court of Vänersborg on the 16 April 2012. In April 2012, the Swedish curators made public that SAAB has a debt of over US$2 [[1,000,000,000|billion]] after subtracting the value of assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.konkursboet.se/ |title=Saab bankruptcy site |publisher=Konkursboet |date=December 2011 |accessdate=2012-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422092741/http://en.konkursboet.se/ |archivedate=2012-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303772904577335704135209644 |title= Saab Auto Left $2 Billion in Debts | publisher=Wall Street Journal |date= April 2012|accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, a Swedish biography of Victor Muller was published, [[Cirkus Muller]], by journalist [[Jens B Nordström]].&lt;ref name="Mynewsdesk"/&gt;

In August 2012, Muller, stated that Spyker Cars will sue General Motors over Saab's bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-06/spyker-sues-gm-for-3-billion-over-saab-bankruptcy.html |title='Spyker Sues GM for $3 Billion Over Saab Bankruptcy'|publisher=Bloomberg |date=2012-06-08 |accessdate=2012-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Muller, stated, "Ever since we were forced to file for Saab Automobile’s bankruptcy in December of last year, we have worked relentlessly on the preparation for this lawsuit, which seeks to compensate Spyker and Saab for the massive damages we have incurred as a result of GM’s unlawful actions". On 22 June 2013, a [[United States District Court Judge|District Court Judge]] dismissed the case. According to Judge [[Gershwin A. Drain]], "General Motors had a contractual right to approve or disapprove the proposed transaction," and "The court is going to grant the motion to dismiss the matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/automotive/sns-rt-us-saab-gmbre95912l-20130610,0,2049845.story |title='Saab parent's $3 billion lawsuit vs GM thrown out by U.S. judge|publisher= Chicago Tribune |date=2013-07-06 |accessdate=2013-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spyker Cars NV appealed the ruling. The appeal was heard at the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati. The court said on Friday October 24, 2014 that GM did not intentionally interfered with the Dutch company's effort to sell Saab to Zhejiang Youngman Lotus Automobile Co, leading to Saab's bankruptcy. Judge Eugene Siler said GM's actions were not malicious, and that it had "legitimate business concerns" about the sale, including who would benefit from Saab's use of its technology. Siler said that Spyker's claim was "fatally flawed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/24/us-gm-spyker-saab-idUSKCN0ID22E20141024 |title='U.S. appeals court rules for GM over Spyker's Saab sale'|publisher= Reuters|date=2014-10-24 |accessdate=2014-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since May 2013, Muller, has been a prime suspect of corporate tax evasion. As of 19 February 2016 Muller will be prosecuted by the Swedish tax authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/22/us-sweden-saab-idUSBRE94L18420130522/|title=Sweden to summon former Saab chairman in tax inquiry|publisher=Reuters |date= May 22, 2013|accessdate=2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Victor Van Hoegaerden''' (1828 in [[Brussels]] – 1905) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] businessman and governor of the [[National Bank of Belgium]] (NBB) from 1891 until 1905.

==Career==
He started his career as a businessman establishing [[Weaving|weaving mill]]s in [[Ohain, Belgium|Ohain]], [[Lokeren]], [[Tubize]], [[Zele]] and [[Ghent]]. The mills of Tubize, Zele and Ghent would, years later, grow into the ''Usines Cotonnières de Belgique''. From the establishment of the ''Caisse Générale d'Épargne et de Retraite'' in 1865, he became a member of its management board and became its president in 1889.

In 1869 he was appointed to the discount committee of the NBB, and a year later he became a director. He succeeded [[Eugène Anspach]] as vice-governor of the NBB in 1888 and as governor in 1891. His term as governor of the NBB coincided with an economic revival after the economic depression which had lasted from 1873 until 1895.

Under his leadership the Public Depository as a new department was established at the bank. From now on people could deposit all sorts of valuables or securities, and the bank would take charge of the deposits. On 26 March 1900 the law came into force which for the second time extended the term of the Bank by thirty years.
