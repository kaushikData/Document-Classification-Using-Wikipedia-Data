      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2849">The '''Accelerated Reduction/Elimination of Toxics''' (ARET) program was a Canadian program established in the early 1990s with the goal of using voluntary measures to reduce or eliminate harmful substances.

==Formation==
The program was started by the [[New Directions Group]] (NDG), a group of senior industry representatives and [[Environmental Non-Government Organizations]] (ENGOs). After [[Environment Canada]] formally supported the initiative in 1991, the [[ARET Stakeholder committee]] was formed to participate in the program. The committee consisted of representatives from industry, provincial and federal governments, health and environmental groups, and labour organizations.  

The committee first evaluated a list of over 2000 chemicals, scoring them on the basis of toxicity, persistence, and [[bioaccumulation]] capability. By 1994, the evaluation was complete and a resulting list of 117 toxic substances were slated by the committee for voluntary elimination or reduction by the year 2000.

==Goals==

===Short-term goals===
* Reduce persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substance emissions by 90 percent
* Reduce all other toxic substance emissions by 50 percent

===Long-term goals===
* Virtual elimination of releases of 30 persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances
* Reduction of another 87 toxic substances to levels insufficient to cause harm

==Results==
The success of the ARET program is disputed. While [[Environment Canada]] states that over 70,000 tonnes of toxic substances were prevented from release because of the success of the program, the [[multi-stakeholder]] nature of the committee lead to disagreements over which substances would be given priority. Environmental and labour groups withdrew from the committee over the emphasis placed on ''reductions'', rather than ''eliminations'', of these substances by industry representatives. [[Nils Axel Braathen]] also claims that knowing to what extent the reductions were actual improvements from the "business-as-usual" reduction scenario is very difficult, meaning that the net environmental benefits were questionable.

'''Alkaline water electrolysis''' has a long history in the chemical industry. It is a type of [[electrolyzer]] that is characterized by having two [[electrodes]] operating in a liquid alkaline electrolyte solution of [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) or [[sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH).  These electrodes are separated by a diaphragm, separating the product gases and transporting the hydroxide ions  (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) from one electrode to the other.&lt;ref name="carmo2013a"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carmo|first=M|author2=Fritz D |author3=Mergel J |author4=Stolten D |title=A comprehensive review on PEM water electrolysis|journal=Journal of Hydrogen Energy|volume=38|issue=12|pages=4901|year=2013|doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.01.151|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.01.151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alkaline Water Electrolysis|url=http://www.eolss.net/sample-chapters/c08/e3-13-03-02.pdf|publisher=Energy Carriers and Conversion Systems|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent comparison showed that state-of-the-art nickel based water electrolyzers with alkaline electrolytes lead to competitive or even better efficiencies than acidic [[polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis|polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolysis]] with platinum group metal based electrocatalysts.&lt;ref name="schalenbach2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schalenbach|first=M|author2=Tjarks G |author3=Carmo M | author4=Lueke W |author5=Mueller M |author6=Stolten D|title=Acidic or Alkaline?

Electrolysis requires minerals to be present in solution. Tap, well, and ground water contains various minerals, some of which are alkaline while others are acidic. Water above a pH of 7.0 is considered alkaline; below 7.0 it is acidic.  Electrolysis can occur only if the water is acidic or alkaline. The requirement is that there must be ions in the water to conduct electricity for the [[Electrolysis of water|water electrolysis]] process to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USGS Water Science School|url=http://water.usgs.gov/edu/electrical-conductivity.html|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Argonne National Laboratory Newton Ask a Scientist|url=http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/chem07/chem07289.htm|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical Details==
The electrodes are typically separated by a thin porous foil (with a thickness between 0.050 to 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm), commonly referred to as diaphragm or separator.&lt;ref name="schalenbach2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schalenbach|first=M|author2=Zeradjanin AR |author3=Kasian O | author4=Cherevko S |author5=Mayrhofer KJJ | title=A Perspective on Low-Temperature Water Electrolysis – Challenges in Alkaline and Acidic Technology |journal=International Journal of Electrochemical Science|volume=13|pages=1173|year=2018|doi=10.20964/2018.02.26|url=http://www.electrochemsci.org/papers/vol13/130201173.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The diaphragm is non-conductive to electrons, thus avoiding electrical shorts between the electrodes while allowing small distances between the electrodes. The ionic conductivity is supplied by the aqueous alkaline solution, which penetrates in the pores of the porous diaphragm. The state-of-the-art diaphragm is Zirfon, a composite material of [[zirconia]] and Polysulfone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AGFA Zirfon Perl Product Specification| url=http://www.agfa.com/specialty-products/solutions/membranes/zirfon-perl-utp-500/|accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The diaphragm further avoids the mixing of the produced hydrogen and oxygen at the cathode and anode,&lt;ref name="schalenbach2016zirfon"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schalenbach|first=M|author2=Lueke W |author3=Stolten D| title=Hydrogen Diffusivity and Electrolyte Permeability of the Zirfon PERL Separator for Alkaline Water Electrolysis |journal= Journal of the Electrochemical Society |volume=163|pages=F1480|year=2016|doi= 10.1149/2.1251613jes|url=http://jes.ecsdl.org/content/163/14/F1480.short }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haug2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haug|first=P|author2=Koj M |author3=Turek T| title=Influence of process conditions on gas purity in alkaline water electrolysis|journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|volume=42|pages=9406|year=2017|doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.12.111| url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319916336588}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively. 
Typically, Nickel based metals are used as the electrodes for alkaline water electrolysis.&lt;ref name="schalenbach2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schalenbach|first=M|author2=Zeradjanin AR |author3=Kasian O | author4=Cherevko S |author5=Mayrhofer KJJ | title=A Perspective on Low-Temperature Water Electrolysis – Challenges in Alkaline and Acidic Technology |journal=International Journal of Electrochemical Science|volume=13|pages=1173|year=2018|doi=10.20964/2018.02.26|url=http://www.electrochemsci.org/papers/vol13/130201173.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Considering pure metals, Ni is the most active non-noble metal &lt;ref name="Quanio2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Quaino|first=P|author2=Juarez F |author3=Santos E| author4=Schmickler W| title=Volcano plots in hydrogen electrocatalysis–uses and abuses |journal=Beilstein journal of nanotechnology |volume=42|pages=9406|year=2014|doi= 10.3762/bjnano.5.96 | pmc=4077405 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
. The high price of good noble metal electrocatalysts such as platinum group metals and their dissolution during the oxygen evolution &lt;ref name="Schalenbach-dissolution"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schalenbach |first=M |author2= et al. | title=The electrochemical dissolution of noble metals in alkaline media |journal= Electrocatalysis|volume=2|pages=153|year=2018|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12678-017-0438-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a drawback. Ni is considered as more stable during the oxygen evolution.&lt;ref name="Cherevko2016 "&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cherevko |first=S |author2= et al. | title=Oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions on Ru, RuO2, Ir, and IrO2 thin film electrodes in acidic and alkaline electrolytes: A comparative study on activity and stability |journal=Catalysis Today |volume=262|pages=170|year=2016|doi= 10.1016/j.cattod.2015.08.014| url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920586115004940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High surface area Ni catalysts can be achieved by dealloying of Nickel-Zinc or Nickel-Aluminium alloys in alkaline solution, commonly referred to as Raney Nickel. In cell tests the best performing electrodes thus far reported consisted of plasma vacuum sprayed Ni alloys on Ni meshes &lt;ref name="Schiller1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schiller |first=G |author2=Henne R|author3=Borock V| title=Vacuum Plasma Spraying of High-Performance Electrodes for Alkaline Water Electrolysis |journal=Journal of Thermal Spray Technology |volume=4|pages=185|year=1995| url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02646111 |bibcode=1995JTST....4..185S|doi=10.1007/BF02646111}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="Schiller1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schiller |first=G |author2=Henne R|author3=Mohr P| author4=Peinecke V| title=High Performance Electrodes for an Advanced Intermittently Operated 10-kW Alkaline Water Electrolyzer |journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|volume=23|pages=761|year=1998|doi= 10.1016/S0360-3199(97)00122-5| url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319997001225}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and hot dip galvanized Ni meshes &lt;ref name="Schalenbach2018-3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schalenbach |first=M |author2= et al. | title= An alkaline water electrolyzer with nickel electrodes enables efficient high current density operation|journal= International Journal of Hydrogen Energy | year=2018|doi= 10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.04.219 | url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036031991831440X }}&lt;/ref&gt;
. The latter approach might be interesting for large scale industrial manufacturing as it is cheap and easily scalable.

==Advantages compared to PEM water electrolysis==
In comparison to polymer electrolyte water electrolysis, another established technology to conduct low temperature water electrolysis, advantages of alkaline water electrolysis are mainly:&lt;ref name="schalenbach2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schalenbach|first=M|author2=Zeradjanin AR |author3=Kasian O | author4=Cherevko S |author5=Mayrhofer KJJ | title=A Perspective on Low-Temperature Water Electrolysis – Challenges in Alkaline and Acidic Technology |journal=International Journal of Electrochemical Science|volume=13|pages=1173|year=2018|doi=10.20964/2018.02.26|url=http://www.electrochemsci.org/papers/vol13/130201173.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1) Cheaper catalysts compared to the platinum metal group based catalysts used for PEM water electrolysis. (2) Higher durability due to an exchangeable electrolyte and lower dissolution of anodic catalyst. (3) Higher gas purities due to lower gas diffusivity in alkaline electrolyte.

'''Aluminium oxide''' ([[IUPAC]] name) or '''aluminum oxide''' ([[American English]]) is a [[chemical compound]] of [[aluminium]] and [[oxygen]] with the [[chemical formula]] {{aluminium}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{oxygen}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is the most commonly occurring of several [[Aluminium oxide (compounds)|aluminium oxides]], and specifically identified as '''aluminium(III) oxide'''.  It is commonly called '''alumina''' (regardless of whether the element is spelled aluminum or aluminium), and may also be called '''aloxide''', '''aloxite''', or '''alundum''' depending on particular forms or applications.  It occurs naturally in its crystalline [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphic]] [[phase (matter)|phase]] α-Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as the [[mineral]] [[corundum]], varieties of which form the precious [[gemstone]]s [[ruby]] and [[sapphire]].  Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is significant in its use to produce aluminium metal, as an [[abrasive]] owing to its [[hardness]], and as a [[refractory]] material owing to its high melting point.&lt;ref name=azom&gt;{{cite web|title = Alumina (Aluminium Oxide) – The Different Types of Commercially Available Grades|url = http://www.azom.com/details.asp?ArticleID=1389|publisher = The A to Z of Materials|accessdate = 2007-10-27|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071010063029/http://www.azom.com/details.asp?ArticleID=1389|archivedate = 10 October 2007|deadurl = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural occurrence==
[[Corundum]] is the most common naturally occurring [[crystallinity|crystalline]] form of aluminium oxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9WyXTae58DgC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=Corundum+is+the+most+common+naturally+occurring+crystalline+form+of+aluminium+oxide.#v=onepage&amp;q=Corundum%20is%20the%20most%20common%20naturally%20occurring%20crystalline%20form%20of%20aluminium%20oxide.&amp;f=false|title=Atomic Layer Deposition Applications 6|last=Elam|first=J.

Rubies are given their characteristic deep red color and their [[laser]] qualities by traces of [[chromium]]. Sapphires come in different colors given by various other impurities, such as iron and titanium.

Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is an [[Insulator (electricity)|electrical insulator]] but has a relatively high [[thermal conductivity]] ({{nowrap|30 Wm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}})&lt;ref name="properties"&gt;[http://www.makeitfrom.com/data/?material=Alumina Material Properties Data: Alumina (Aluminum Oxide)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401131344/http://www.makeitfrom.com/data/?material=Alumina |date=2010-04-01 }}.

In its most commonly occurring crystalline form, called [[corundum]] or α-aluminium oxide, its hardness makes it suitable for use as an [[abrasive]] and as a component in [[cutting tools]].&lt;ref name = azom/&gt;

Aluminium oxide is responsible for the resistance of metallic aluminium to [[weathering]]. Metallic aluminium is very reactive with atmospheric oxygen, and a thin [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation layer]] of aluminium oxide (4&amp;nbsp;nm thickness) forms on any exposed aluminium surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://cacs.usc.edu/papers/Campbell-nAloxid-PRL99.pdf| doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.82.4866| title=Dynamics of Oxidation of Aluminium Nanoclusters using Variable Charge Molecular-Dynamics Simulations on Parallel Computers| year=1999| author=Campbell, Timothy| journal=Physical Review Letters| volume=82| page=4866| last2=Kalia| first2=Rajiv| last3=Nakano| first3=Aiichiro| last4=Vashishta| first4=Priya| last5=Ogata| first5=Shuji| last6=Rodgers| first6=Stephen| bibcode=1999PhRvL..82.4866C| issue=24| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701230226/http://cacs.usc.edu/papers/Campbell-nAloxid-PRL99.pdf| archivedate=2010-07-01| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This layer protects the metal from further oxidation. The thickness and properties of this oxide layer can be enhanced using a process called [[anodising]]. A number of [[alloys]], such as [[aluminium bronze]]s, exploit this property by including a proportion of aluminium in the alloy to enhance corrosion resistance. The aluminium oxide generated by anodising is typically [[amorphous]], but discharge assisted oxidation processes such as [[plasma electrolytic oxidation]] result in a significant proportion of crystalline aluminium oxide in the coating, enhancing its [[hardness]].

Aluminium oxide was taken off the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s chemicals lists in 1988. Aluminium oxide is on the EPA's [[Toxics Release Inventory]] list if it is a fibrous form.&lt;ref name=TRI&gt;{{cite web|title=EPCRA Section 313 Chemical List For Reporting Year 2006 |url=http://www.epa.gov/tri/chemical/chemical%20lists/RY2006ChemicalList.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080522232533/http://www.epa.gov/tri/chemical/chemical%20lists/RY2006ChemicalList.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-05-22 |format=PDF |publisher=US EPA |accessdate=2008-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amphoteric nature===
Aluminium oxide is an [[amphoteric]] substance, meaning it can react with both [[acids]] and [[base (chemistry)|bases]], such as [[hydrofluoric acid]] and [[sodium hydroxide]], acting as an acid with a base and a base with an acid, neutralising the other and producing a salt.

==Production==
Aluminium [[hydroxide]] minerals are the main component of [[bauxite]], the principal [[ore]] of [[aluminium]]. A mixture of the minerals comprise bauxite ore, including [[gibbsite]] (Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[boehmite]] (γ-AlO(OH)), and [[diaspore]] (α-AlO(OH)), along with impurities of [[iron oxide]]s and hydroxides, quartz and [[clay minerals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/bauxite/|publisher = USGS| accessdate = 2009-05-05| title = Bauxite and Alumina Statistics and Information| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090506220703/http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/bauxite/| archivedate= 6 May 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bauxites are found in [[laterite]]s. Bauxite is purified by the [[Bayer process]]:

: Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + NaOH → NaAl(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
: Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + NaOH → NaAl(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

Except for SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the other components of bauxite do not dissolve in base. Upon filtering the basic mixture, Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is removed. When the Bayer liquor is cooled, Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; precipitates, leaving the silicates in solution.

: NaAl(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → NaOH + Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

The solid  Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; [[Gibbsite]] is then [[calcined]] (heated to over 1100&amp;nbsp;°C) to give aluminium oxide:&lt;ref name = azom/&gt;

: 2&amp;thinsp;Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3&amp;thinsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The product aluminium oxide tends to be multi-phase, i.e., consisting of several phases of aluminium oxide rather than solely [[corundum]].&lt;ref name=Paglia/&gt; The production process can therefore be optimized to produce a tailored product. The type of phases present affects, for example, the solubility and pore structure of the aluminium oxide product which, in turn, affects the cost of aluminium production and pollution control.&lt;ref name=Paglia/&gt;

For its application as an electrical [[insulator (electricity)|insulator]] in [[integrated circuits]], where the conformal growth of a thin film is a prerequisite and the preferred growth mode is [[atomic layer deposition]], Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; films can be prepared by the chemical exchange between trimethylaluminum Al(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Higashi GS, Fleming |title= Sequential surface chemical reaction limited growth of high quality Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; dielectrics |journal=Appl.

Annual world production of aluminium oxide in 2015 was approximately 115 million [[tonne]]s, over 90% of which is used in the manufacture of aluminium metal.&lt;ref name="azom" /&gt; The major uses of speciality aluminium oxides are in refractories, ceramics, polishing and abrasive applications. Large tonnages of aluminium hydroxide, from which alumina is derived, are used in the manufacture of [[zeolites]], coating [[Titanium dioxide|titania]] pigments, and as a fire retardant/smoke suppressant.

==Applications==
{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2018}}
Over 90% of the aluminium oxide, normally termed Smelter Grade Alumina (SGA), produced is consumed for the production of aluminium, usually by the [[Hall–Héroult process]]. The remainder, normally called speciality alumina is used in a wide variety of applications which reflect its inertness, temperature resistance and electrical resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter = Properties and uses of aluminium oxides and aluminium hydroxides|first = K.

*Filler:
Being fairly chemically inert and white, aluminium oxide is a favored filler for plastics. Aluminium oxide is a common ingredient in [[sunscreen]] and is sometimes also present in cosmetics such as blush, lipstick, and nail polish.

*Glass:
Many formulations of [[glass]] have aluminium oxide as an ingredient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=C2_LBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=some+glass+contain+aluminum+oxide#v=onepage&amp;q=some%20glass%20contain%20aluminum%20oxide&amp;f=false|title=Sterile Drug Products: Formulation, Packaging, Manufacturing and Quality|last=Akers|first=Michael J.|date=2016-04-19|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781420020564|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Catalysis:
Aluminium oxide catalyses a variety of reactions that are useful industrially. In its largest scale application, aluminium oxide is the catalyst in the [[Claus process]] for converting hydrogen sulfide waste gases into elemental sulfur in refineries. It is also useful for dehydration of [[alcohol]]s to alkenes.

Aluminium oxide serves as a [[catalyst support]] for many industrial catalysts, such as those used in [[hydrodesulfurization]] and some [[Ziegler-Natta]] polymerizations.

*Purification:
Aluminium oxide is widely used to remove water from gas streams.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, L. Keith; Misra, Chanakya; Perrotta, Anthony J.; Wefers, Karl and Williams, F. S. (2002)  "Aluminum Oxide" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a01_557}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Abrasive:
Aluminium oxide is used for its hardness and strength. It is widely used as an [[abrasive]], including as a much less expensive substitute for [[industrial diamond]]. Many types of [[sandpaper]] use aluminium oxide crystals. In addition, its low heat retention and low [[specific heat]] make it widely used in grinding operations, particularly [[metalworking|cutoff]] tools. As the powdery abrasive mineral [[aloxite]], it is a major component, along with [[silica]], of the [[Cue stick|cue tip]] "chalk" used in [[Cue sports|billiards]]. Aluminium oxide powder is used in some [[Compact disc|CD]]/[[DVD]] [[polishing]] and scratch-repair kits. Its polishing qualities are also behind its use in toothpaste.

*Paint:
{{Main|Alumina effect pigment}}
Aluminium oxide flakes are used in paint for reflective decorative effects, such as in the automotive or cosmetic industries.

*Composite fiber:
Aluminium oxide has been used in a few experimental and commercial fiber materials for high-performance applications (e.g., Fiber FP, Nextel 610, Nextel 720).&lt;ref name=mallick&gt;{{cite book|last=Mallick|first=P.K.|title=Fiber-reinforced composites materials, manufacturing, and design|year=2008|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=0-8493-4205-8|pages=Ch.2.1.7|edition=3rd ed., [expanded and rev. ed.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alumina [[nanofibers]] in particular have become a research field of interest.

*Personal armor:
Some body armors utilize alumina ceramic plates, usually in combination with aramid or UHMWPE backing to achieve effectiveness against even most rifle threats. Alumina ceramic armor is readily available to most civilians in jurisdictions where it is legal, but is not considered military grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ballistic Resistance of Body Armor |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/223054.pdf |website=US Department of Justice |publisher=NIJ |accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Abrasion protection:
Aluminium oxide can be grown as a coating on aluminium by [[anodizing]] or by [[plasma electrolytic oxidation]] (see the "Properties" above). Both the [[hardness]] and abrasion-resistant characteristics of the coating originate from the high strength of aluminium oxide, yet the porous coating layer produced with conventional direct current anodizing procedures is within a 60-70 Rockwell hardness C range &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Joseph H.|last=Osborn|title=understanding and specifying anodizing: what a manufacturer needs to know|url=http://www.omwcorp.com/understandingano/anoindex.html|website=OMW Corporation|year=2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120010024/http://www.omwcorp.com/understandingano/anoindex.html|archivedate=2016-11-20|accessdate=2018-06-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is comparable only to hardened carbon steel alloys, but considerably inferior to the hardness of natural and synthetic corundum. Instead, with [[plasma electrolytic oxidation]], the coating is porous only on the surface oxide layer while the lower oxide layers are much more compact than with standard DC anodizing procedures and present a higher crystallinity due to the oxide layers being remelted and densified to obtain α-Al2O3 clusters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modern Surface Engineering Treatments, chapter 4 ''Plasma Oxidation Coatings on Lightweight Metals''|first1=Q|last1=Li|first2=J|last2=Liang|first3=Q|last3=Wang|website=INTECH 2013|url=http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs-wm/44294.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304114502/http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs-wm/44294.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with much higher coating hardness values circa 2000 Vickers hardness.

[[Image:2005alumina.PNG|thumb|Aluminium oxide output in 2005]]Alumina is used to manufacture tiles which are attached inside pulverized fuel lines and flue gas ducting on coal fired power stations to protect high wear areas. They are not suitable for areas with high impact forces as these tiles are brittle and susceptible to breakage.

In chemistry laboratories, aluminium oxide is a medium for [[chromatography]], available in [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] (pH&amp;nbsp;9.5), [[acid]]ic (pH&amp;nbsp;4.5 when in water) and neutral formulations.

Health and medical applications include it as a material in [[hip replacement]]s&lt;ref name="azom" /&gt; and [[Oral contraceptive pill|birth control pills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=75bb0024-8f1a-4036-9acd-006ea430f3b7#|title=DailyMed - JUNEL FE 1/20- norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol, and ferrous fumarate|website=dailymed.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2017-03-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313130132/https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=75bb0024-8f1a-4036-9acd-006ea430f3b7|archivedate=2017-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aluminium oxide is an electrical [[insulator (electricity)|insulator]] used as a substrate ([[silicon on sapphire]]) for [[integrated circuits]] but also as a [[quantum tunneling|tunnel barrier]] for the fabrication of [[superconducting]] devices such as [[single electron transistor]]s and superconducting quantum interference devices ([[SQUID]]s).

Aluminum oxide being a dielectric with relatively large band gap is used as an insulating barrier in [[capacitors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Belkin|first1=A.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Recovery of Alumina Nanocapacitors after High Voltage Breakdown|journal=Sci.

Insulation for high-temperature furnaces is often manufactured from aluminium oxide.  Sometimes the insulation has varying percentages of silica depending on the temperature rating of the material.  The insulation can be made in blanket, board, brick and loose fiber forms for various application requirements.

Small pieces of aluminium oxide are often used as [[boiling chips]] in chemistry.

It is also used to make [[spark plug]] [[insulator (electricity)|insulator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TYBh3fBQrVwC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=Aluminum+oxide+is+also+used+to+make+spark+plug+insulators&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjztcjU2bfXAhVny1QKHawqBYIQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Aluminum%20oxide%20is%20also%20used%20to%20make%20spark%20plug%20insulators&amp;f=false|title=Aluminum|last=Farndon|first=John|date=2001|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=9780761409472|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171204203316/https://books.google.com/books?id=TYBh3fBQrVwC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=Aluminum+oxide+is+also+used+to+make+spark+plug+insulators&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjztcjU2bfXAhVny1QKHawqBYIQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Aluminum%20oxide%20is%20also%20used%20to%20make%20spark%20plug%20insulators&amp;f=false|archivedate=2017-12-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Automatic_lubrication_system.jpg|thumb|right|automatic lubrication system installed on CNC machine]]

An '''automatic lubrication system''' ('''ALS'''), often referred to as a '''centralized lubrication system''', is a system that delivers controlled amounts of [[lubricant]] to multiple locations on a machine while the machine is operating.  Even though these systems are usually fully automated, a system that requires a manual pump or button activation is still identified as a centralized lubrication system. The system can be classified into two different categories that can share a lot of the same components. &lt;br /&gt;

'''Oil systems''': [[Oil]] systems primary use is for stationary manufacturing equipment such as [[Numerical control|CNC milling]]&lt;br /&gt;

'''Grease systems''': [[Grease (lubricant)|Grease]] primary use is on mobile units such as [[truck]]s, [[mining]] or [[construction equipment]].&lt;br /&gt;

Oil versus grease can vary even though their primary use is mostly stationary for oil and mobile for grease, some stationary manufacturing equipment will use grease systems.

== Reason for an automatic lubrication system ==
Automatic lubrication system is designed to apply lubricant in small, measured amounts over short, frequent time intervals.  Time and human resource constraints and sometimes the physical location on machine often makes it impractical to manually lubricate the points.  As a result, production cycles, [[MTBF|machine availability]], and manpower availability dictate the intervals at which machinery is lubricated which is not optimal for the point requiring lubrication.  Auto lube systems are installed on machinery to address this problem.

== Benefits ==
Auto lube systems have many advantages over traditional methods of manual lubrication:
# All critical components are lubricated, regardless of location or ease of access 
# Lubrication occurs while the machinery is in operation causing the lubricant to be equally distributed within the [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] and increasing the machine’s availability. 
# Proper lubrication of critical components ensures safe operation of the machinery.
# Less [[wear]] on the components means extended component life, fewer [[breakdown (vehicle)|breakdowns]], reduced [[downtime]], reduced [[replacement costs]] and reduced maintenance costs
# Measured lubrication amounts means no wasted lubricant
# Safety - no climbing around machinery or inaccessible areas ([[gases]], [[exhaust gas|exhaust]], confined spaces, etc.)
# Lower energy consumption due to less [[friction]]
# Increased overall productivity resulting from increase in machine availability and reduction in downtime due to breakdowns or general maintenance
#in this system lubrication the engine parts are lubricated under pressure feed

== Components  ==
A typical system consists of controller/timer, [[pump]] w/[[reservoir]], supply line, [[valves|metering valves]], and [[feed line]]s. Regardless of the manufacturer or type of system, all automatic lubrication systems share these 5 main components:&lt;ref name="mohawk"&gt;Mohawk College of Applied Arts and Technology: ''Reasons for Lube Systems; MATLLUB04''. January 2007, ''[http://www.flocomponents.com/ FLO Components Ltd]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Controller/Timer – activates the system to distribute lubrication can be linked to a POS system. 
# Pump with Reservoir – stores and provides the lubricant to the system
# Supply Line – line that connects the pump to the metering valves or injectors. The lubricant is pumped through this.
# Metering Valves/Injectors– component that measures/dispenses the lubricant to the application points.
# Feed lines - line that connects the metering valves or injectors to the application points. The lubricant is pumped through this.

==  Types ==
There are several different types of automatic lubrication systems including:
* Single Line Parallel systems
* Dual Line Parallel systems
* Single Point Automatics
* Single Line Progressive systems (or Series Progressive)
* Single Line Resistance
* Oil Mist and Air-Oil systems
* Oil re-circulating 
* Chain lube systems
The 4 most commonly used Automatic Lubrication System types are:
* Single Line Parallel, 
* Dual Line Parallel and 
* Single Line Progressive.&lt;ref name="mohawk" /&gt;
* Multi port direct lubricators
 

=== Single line progressive ===
[[Image:Single Line Progressive Automatic Lubrication System.png|thumb|250px|alt=Single Single Line Progressive Automatic Lubrication System|Single Line Progressive Automatic Lubrication System]]
A single line progressive system uses lubricant flow to cycle individual metering valves and valve assemblies.  The valves consist of dispensing pistons moving back and forth in a specific bore.  Each piston depends on flow from the previous piston to shift and displace lubricant.  If one piston doesn’t shift, none of the following pistons will shift.  Valve output is not adjustable.  

Operation begins when the controller/timer sends a signal to the pump to start the lube event. The pump then feeds lubricant into the supply line which connects to the primary metering valve, for either a preprogrammed amount of time or number of times as monitored through a designated piston cycle switch.  Lubricant is fed to the multiple lubrication points one after another via secondary progressive metering valves sized for each series of lubrication points, and then directly to each point via the feed lines.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lincoln Industrial Corporation]]: ''Quicklub Centralized &amp; Automated Lubrication Systems''. April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Single line parallel ===
[[Image:Single Line Parallel Automatic Lubrication System.png|thumb|250px|alt=Single Line Parallel Automatic Lubrication System|Single Line Parallel Automatic Lubrication System]]
The first single-line parallel system for industry was introduced in 1937 by [[Lincoln Industrial Corporation|Lincoln Engineering]] (now known as Lincoln Industrial) in the United States.
  
A single line parallel system can service a single machine, different zones on a single machine or even several separate machines and is ideal when the volume of lubricant varies for each point. In this type of system, a central [[pump station]] automatically delivers lubricant through a single supply line to multiple branches of [[injector]]s.  Each injector serves a single lubrication point, operates independently and may be individually adjusted to deliver the desired amount of lubricant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lincoln Industrial Corporation]]: ''Centro-Matic Automated Lubrication Systems''. December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Operation begins when the controller/timer sends a signal to the pump starting the lube cycle.  The pump begins pumping lubricant to build up pressure in the supply line connecting the pump to the injectors.  Once the required pressure is reached, the lube injectors dispense a predetermined amount of lubricant to the lubrication points via feed lines.&lt;ref name="MLM"&gt;Paul Conley, Lincoln Industrial Corporation and Raj Shah, Koehler Instrument Company: ''Ventmeter Aids Selection of Grease for Centralized Lubrication Systems''. In: ''Machinery Lubrication Magazine''. January 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the entire system reaches the required pressure, a pressure switch sends a signal to the controller indicating that grease has cycled through to all the distribution points.  The pump shuts off.  Pressure is vented out of the system and grease in the line is redirected back to the pump reservoir, until the normal system pressure level is restored.&lt;ref name="MLM" /&gt;

=== Dual line parallel ===
[[Image:Dual Line Parallel Automatic Lubrication System.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=Dual Line Parallel Automatic Lubrication System|Dual Line Parallel Automatic Lubrication System]]

A dual line parallel system is similar to the single line parallel system in that it uses hydraulic pressure to cycle adjustable valves to dispense measured shots of lubricant.  It has 2 main supply lines which are alternatively used as pressure / vent lines.  The advantage of a two-line system is that it can handle hundreds of lubrication points from a single pump station over several thousand feet using significantly smaller tubing or pipe. 

Operation begins when the controller/timer sends a signal to the pump to start the lubrication cycle.  The pump begins pumping lubricant to build up pressure in the first (the pressure) supply line while simultaneously venting the second (vent) return line.  Once the required pressure is reached, a predetermined amount of lubricant is dispensed by the metering devices to half of the lubrication points via feed lines.  

Once the pressure switch monitoring main supply line pressure indicates a preset pressure in the line has been reached, the system is hydraulically closed.  The controller shuts off the pump and signals a changeover valve to redirect lubricant to the second main supply line.&lt;ref name="Cartwright"&gt;Steve Cartwright; LubriSource Inc. ''Product Guide - Centralized Lubrication Systems''. In: ''Machinery Lubrication Magazine''. July 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The next time the controller activates the system, the second main line now becomes the pressure line while the first line becomes the vent line. The second line is pressurized and the entire process is repeated lubricating the remaining lube points.&lt;ref name="Cartwright" /&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Multi point direct lubricator'''&lt;/big&gt;

When the controller in the pump or external controller activates the drive motor, a set of cams turns and activates individual injectors or pump elements to dispense a fixed amount of lubricant to each individual lubrication point.  Systems are easy to design,  direct pump to lube point without added accessories and easy to troubleshoot.

The '''biconic cusp''' was an early method for modeling [[plasma confinement]].&lt;ref&gt;Containment in a cusped Plasma System, Dr. Harold Grad, NYO-9496&lt;/ref&gt;  They were studied at the [[Courant Institute]] by [[Harold Grad]] in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

== Description ==

The [[magnetic field]]s in this system were made by [[electromagnets]] placed close together.  This was a theoretical construct used to model how to contain [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]].  The fields were made by two coils of wire facing one another.  These [[electromagnets]] had poles which faced one another and in the center was a [[Null (physics)|null point]] in the magnetic field.  This was also termed a zero point field.  These devices were explored theoretically by Dr. [[Harold Grad]] at NYU's [[Courant Institute]] in the late 1950s and early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;J Berowitz, H Grad and H Rubin, in proceedings of the second United Nations International conference on peaceful uses of atomic energy, Geneva, 1958, Vol 31, Page 177&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grad, H. Theory of Cusped Geometries, I. General Survey, NYO-7969, Inst. Math. Sci., N.Y.U., December 1, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berkowitz, J., Theory of Cusped Geometries, II. Particle Losses, NYO-2530, Inst. Math. Sci., N.Y.U., January 6, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the fields were planar symmetric this plasma system was simple to model.

== Particle behavior ==

Simulations of these geometries revealed the existence of three classes of particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The motion of a charged particle near a zero field point |vauthors = Van Norton R|year=1961 |publisher=New York University: Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, |location= New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first class moved back and forth far away from the [[null (physics)|null point]].  These particles would be reflected close to the poles of the electromagnets and the plane cusp in the center.  This reflection was due to the [[magnetic mirror]] effect.&lt;ref&gt;M. P. Srivastava and P. K. Bhat (1969). Motion of a charged particle in superposed Heliotron and biconical cusp fields. Journal of Plasma Physics, 3, pp 255-267. doi:10.1017/S0022377800004359.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. Chen, Introduction to Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion (Plenum, New York, 1984), Vol. 1, pp. 30–34. {{ISBN|978-0-306-41332-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These are very stable particles, but their motion changes as they radiate energy over time.  This radiation loss arose from acceleration or deceleration by the field and can be calculated using the [[larmor formula]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Larmor, "On a dynamical theory of the electric and luminiferous medium", Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society 190, (1897) pp. 205–300 (Third and last in a series of papers with the same name)&lt;/ref&gt; The second particle moved close to the [[null (physics)|null point]] in the center.  Because particles passed through locations with no [[magnetic field]], their motions could be straight, with an infinite [[gyroradius]].  This straight motion caused the particle to make a more erratic path through the fields.  The third class of particles was a transition between these types.  Biconic cusps were recently revived because of its similar geometry to the [[Polywell]] fusion reactor.&lt;ref&gt;Low Beta Confinement in a Polywell Modeled with conventional point cusp theories, Physics of Plasma 18.112501 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|coal seam}}'''Coal''' is a [[combustible]] black or brownish-black [[sedimentary rock]] usually occurring in [[stratum|rock strata]] in layers or [[vein (geology)|vein]]s called '''coal beds&lt;!-- redirected term title--&gt;''' or '''coal seams'''. The harder forms, such as [[anthracite|anthracite coal]], can be regarded as [[metamorphic rock]] because of later exposure to elevated temperature and [[pressure]]. Coal is composed primarily of [[carbon]], along with variable quantities of other elements, chiefly [[hydrogen]], [[sulfur]], [[oxygen]], and [[nitrogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blander|first=M|title=Calculations of the Influence of Additives on Coal Combustion Deposits|url=http://www.anl.gov/PCS/acsfuel/preprint%20archive/Files/Volumes/Vol34-2.pdf|publisher=Argonne National Laboratory|accessdate=17 December 2011|page=315|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528174436/http://www.anl.gov/PCS/acsfuel/preprint%20archive/Files/Volumes/Vol34-2.pdf|archivedate=28 May 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal is a [[fossil fuel]] that forms when dead [[plant matter]] is converted into [[peat]], which in turn is converted into [[lignite]], then sub-bituminous coal, after that [[bituminous coal]], and lastly [[anthracite]]. This involves biological and geological processes.

[[Coal mining in China|China mines]] almost half the world's coal followed by [[Coal mining in India|India]] with about a tenth.    [[Coal in Australia|Australia]] accounts for about a third of world coal exports followed by [[Energy in Indonesia#Coal|Indonesia]] and [[Coal in Russia|Russia]]; while the largest importer is [[Energy in Japan|Japan]].

Throughout human history, coal has been used as an [[energy resource]], primarily burned for the production of electricity and heat, and is also used for industrial purposes, such as refining metals. Coal is the largest source of energy for the [[Electricity generation|generation of electricity]] worldwide, as well as the largest worldwide [[wiktionary:anthropogenic|anthropogenic]] source of [[carbon dioxide]]. The extraction and use of coal [[Coal worker's pneumoconiosis|makes people ill]] and [[Environmental impact of the coal industry|damages the environment]], including by [[climate change]].&lt;ref name="psr_coal-damages-health"/&gt; Therefore, as part of the worldwide [[energy transition]], many countries have stopped using or use less coal.

==Etymology==
The word originally took the form ''col'' in [[Old English]], from [[Proto-Germanic]] *''kula''(''n''), which in turn is hypothesized to come from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] root *''g''(''e'')''u-lo-'' "live coal".&lt;ref name=etym&gt;{{OEtymD|coal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] cognates include the [[Old Frisian]] ''kole'', [[Middle Dutch]] ''cole'', [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''kool'', [[Old High German]] ''chol'', [[German language|German]] ''Kohle'' and [[Old Norse]] ''kol'', and the [[Irish language|Irish]] word ''gual'' is also a cognate via the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] root.&lt;ref name=etym/&gt;

==Formation==
[[File:Struktura chemiczna węgla kamiennego.svg|thumb|Example chemical structure of coal]]

At various times in the geologic past, the Earth had dense forests&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fe.doe.gov/education/energylessons/coal/gen_howformed.html|title=How Coal Is Formed|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118113211/http://www.fe.doe.gov/education/energylessons/coal/gen_howformed.html|archivedate=18 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in low-lying wetland areas. Due to natural processes such as flooding, these forests were buried underneath soil. As more and more soil deposited over them, they were compressed. The temperature also rose as they sank deeper and deeper. As the process continued the plant matter was protected from [[biodegradation]] and [[oxidation]], usually by mud or acidic water. This trapped the carbon in immense [[peat bog]]s that were eventually covered and deeply buried by sediments. Under high pressure and high temperature, dead vegetation was slowly converted to coal. As coal contains mainly carbon, the conversion of dead vegetation into coal is called carbonization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_29tNNeQKeMC&amp;pg=PA18| title = Paleobotany: The biology and evolution of fossil plants| isbn = 978-0-12-373972-8| author1 = Taylor, Thomas N| author2 = Taylor, Edith L| author3 = Krings, Michael| year = 2009| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160516231216/https://books.google.com/books?id=_29tNNeQKeMC&amp;pg=PA18| archivedate = 16 May 2016| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wide, shallow seas of the [[Carboniferous]] Period provided ideal conditions for coal formation, although coal is known from most geological periods. The exception is the coal gap in the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]], where coal is rare. Coal is known from [[Precambrian]] strata, which predate land plants—this coal is presumed to have originated from residues of algae.&lt;ref name="Tyler1957"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1130/0016-7606(1957)68[1293:ACFPUH]2.0.CO;2 | last1 = Tyler | first1 = S.

[[File:Coal Rank USGS.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Coal ranking system used by the [[United States Geological Survey]]]]

As geological processes apply [[pressure]] to dead [[biotic material]] over time, under suitable conditions, its [[metamorphic grade]] or rank increases successively into:
* [[Peat]], a precursor of coal
* [[Lignite]], or brown coal, the lowest rank of coal, used almost exclusively as fuel for electric power generation
** [[jet (lignite)|Jet]], a compact form of lignite, sometimes polished; used as an ornamental stone since the [[Upper Palaeolithic]]
* [[Sub-bituminous coal]], whose properties range between those of lignite and those of bituminous coal, is used primarily as fuel for steam-electric power generation and is also an important source of light [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s for the [[chemical synthesis]] industry.{{cn|date=December 2018}}
* [[Bituminous coal]], a dense sedimentary rock, usually black, but sometimes dark brown, often with well-defined bands of bright and dull material It is used primarily as fuel in steam-electric power generation and to make [[coke (fuel)|coke]].
* [[Anthracite]], the highest rank of coal is a harder, glossy black coal used primarily for residential and commercial [[space heating]].
* [[Graphite]] is one of the more difficult coals to ignite and not commonly used as fuel; it is most used in pencils, or powdered for [[lubrication]].

[[Cannel coal]] (sometimes called "candle coal") is a variety of fine-grained, high-rank coal with significant hydrogen content. It consists primarily of "[[exinite]]" [[maceral]]s, now termed "liptinite".

There are several international standards for coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Standards catalogue 73.040 - Coals |url=https://www.iso.org/ics/73.040/x/ |publisher=[[ISO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classification of coal is generally based on the content of [[coal volatiles|volatiles]]. However the most important distinction is between thermal coal (also known as steam coal), which is burnt to generate electricity via steam; and [[metallurgical coal]] (also known as coking coal), which is burnt at high temperature to make [[steel]].

===Hilt's law===

{{main|Hilt's law}}

[[Hilt's law]] is a geological observation that (within a small area) the deeper the coal is found, the higher its rank (or grade). It applies if the thermal gradient is entirely vertical; however, [[metamorphism]] may cause lateral changes of rank, irrespective of depth.

A few [[integrated gasification combined cycle]] (IGCC) power plants have been built, which burn coal more efficiently.

===Coking coal and use of coke to smelt iron===
{{Main|Coke (fuel)}}
[[File:Coke Ovens Abercwmboi.jpg|right|thumb|Coke oven at a [[smokeless fuel]] plant in [[Wales]], United Kingdom]]

Coke is a solid carbonaceous residue derived from coking coal (a low-ash, low-sulfur bituminous coal, also known as [[metallurgical coal]]), which is used in manufacturing [[steel]] and other iron products.&lt;ref name="World Coal Steel"&gt;{{cite web|title=How is Steel Produced?|url=https://www.worldcoal.org/coal/uses-coal/how-steel-produced|publisher=[[World Coal Association]]|accessdate=April 8, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170412114829/https://www.worldcoal.org/coal/uses-coal/how-steel-produced|archivedate=12 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coke is made from coking coal by baking in an oven without oxygen at temperatures as high as 1,000&amp;nbsp;°C, driving off the volatile constituents and fusing together the fixed carbon and residual ash. Metallurgical coke is used as a [[fuel]] and as a [[reducing agent]] in [[smelting]] [[iron ore]] in a [[blast furnace]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steelonthenet.com/cost-bof.html Blast furnace steelmaking cost model] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114013811/http://www.steelonthenet.com/cost-bof.html |date=14 January 2016 }}. Steelonthenet.com. Retrieved on 24 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The carbon monoxide produced by its combustion reduces [[iron oxide]] ([[hematite]]) in the production of the [[iron]] product. 

Waste carbon dioxide is also produced (&lt;chem id="2Fe2O3 + 3C "&gt;2Fe2O3 + 3C -&gt; 4Fe + 3CO2 &lt;/chem&gt;) together with [[pig iron]], which is too rich in dissolved carbon so must be treated further to make steel.

Coking coal should be low in ash, [[sulfur]], and [[phosphorus]], so that these do not migrate to the metal.&lt;ref name="World Coal Steel"/&gt; 
The coke must be [[Coke strength after reaction|strong enough]] to resist the weight of overburden in the blast furnace, which is why coking coal is so important in making steel using the conventional route. Coke from coal is grey, hard, and porous and has a heating value of 29.6 MJ/kg. Some cokemaking processes produce byproducts, including [[coal tar]], [[ammonia]], light oils, and [[coal gas]].

[[Petroleum coke]] (petcoke) is the solid residue obtained in [[oil refining]], which resembles coke but contains too many impurities to be useful in metallurgical applications.

====Alternatives to coke====
Scrap steel can be recycled in an [[electric arc furnace]] and an alternative to making iron by smelting is [[direct reduced iron]], where any carbonaceous fuel can be used to make sponge or pelletised iron. To reduce carbon dioxide emissions in future [[hydrogen]] might be used as the reducing agent and [[biomass]] or waste as the source of carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Coking Coal for steel production and alternatives |url=https://leard.frontlineaction.org/coking-coal-steel-production-alternatives/ |publisher=Front Line Action on Coal |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gasification===
{{Main|Coal gasification|Underground coal gasification}}
Coal gasification, as part of an [[integrated gasification combined cycle]] (IGCC) coal-fired power station, is used to produce [[syngas]], a mixture of [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) and the hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gas to fire gas turbines to produce electricity. Syngas can also be converted into transportation fuels, such as [[gasoline]] and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], through the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]]; alternatively, syngas can be converted into [[methanol]], which can be blended into fuel directly or converted to gasoline via the methanol to gasoline process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/research/coal/energy-systems/gasification/gasifipedia/methanol-to-gasoline |title=Conversion of Methanol to Gasoline |publisher=National Energy Technology Laboratory |accessdate=16 July 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717225057/http://www.netl.doe.gov/research/Coal/energy-systems/gasification/gasifipedia/methanol-to-gasoline |archivedate=17 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gasification combined with Fischer-Tropsch technology is used by the [[Sasol]] chemical company of [[South Africa]] to make motor vehicle fuels from coal and natural gas. Alternatively, the hydrogen obtained from gasification can be used for various purposes, such as powering a [[hydrogen economy]]{{cn|date=December 2018}}, making ammonia, or upgrading fossil fuels{{cn|date=December 2018}}.

During gasification, the coal is mixed with [[oxygen]] and [[steam]] while also being heated and pressurized. During the reaction, oxygen and water molecules [[Redox|oxidize]] the coal into carbon monoxide (CO), while also releasing [[hydrogen]] gas (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). This process has been conducted in both underground coal mines and in the production of [[town gas]] which was piped to customers to burn for illumination, heating, and cooking.

: 3C (''as Coal'') + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3CO

If the refiner wants to produce gasoline, the syngas is collected at this state and routed into a Fischer-Tropsch reaction. This is known as indirect coal liquefaction. If hydrogen is the desired end-product, however, the syngas is fed into the [[water gas shift reaction]], where more hydrogen is liberated.

: CO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

===Liquefaction===
{{Main|Coal liquefaction}}

Coal can be converted directly into [[synthetic fuel]]s equivalent to gasoline or diesel by [[hydrogenation]] or [[carbonization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/research/Coal/energy-systems/gasification/gasifipedia/direct-liquefaction|title=Direct Liquefaction Processes|publisher=National Energy Technology Laboratory|accessdate=16 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725082303/http://www.netl.doe.gov/research/Coal/energy-systems/gasification/gasifipedia/direct-liquefaction|archivedate=25 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal liquefaction emits more carbon dioxide than liquid fuel production from [[crude oil]]. Mixing in biomass and using CCS would emit slightly less than the oil process but at a high cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Economic and environmental analyses of coal and biomass to liquid fuels |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360544217315700}}&lt;/ref&gt; State owned [[China Energy Investment]] runs a coal liquefaction plant and plans to build 2 more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CHN Energy to build new coal-to-liquid production lines |url=http://en.silkroad.news.cn/2018/0813/106231.shtml |agency=Xinhua News Agency |date=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refined coal===
{{Main|Refined coal}}
Refined coal is the product of a coal-upgrading technology that removes moisture and certain pollutants from lower-rank coals such as sub-bituminous and lignite (brown) coals. It is one form of several precombustion treatments and processes for coal that alter coal's characteristics before it is burned. The goals of precombustion coal technologies are to increase efficiency and reduce emissions when the coal is burned. Depending on the situation, precombustion technology can be used in place of{{cn|date=December 2018}} or as a supplement to postcombustion technologies to control emissions from coal-fueled boilers.

===Use in foundry components {{anchor|Industrial processes|Sea coal}}===
Finely ground bituminous coal, known in this application as sea coal, is a constituent of [[foundry sand]]. While the molten metal is in the [[Molding (process)|mould]], the coal burns slowly, releasing [[Reducing agent|reducing gases]] at pressure, and so preventing the metal from penetrating the pores of the sand. It is also contained in 'mould wash', a paste or liquid with the same function applied to the mould before casting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rao|first=P.

When heated, the coal decomposes and the bod becomes slightly friable, easing the process of breaking open holes for tapping the molten metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirk|first=Edward|title=Cupola Furnace – A Practical Treatise on the Construction and Management of Foundry Cupolas|publisher=Baird|location=Philadelphia, PA|year=1899|page=95|chapter=Cupola management|oclc=2884198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production of chemicals===
[[File:Coal to chemicals routes diagram.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|Production of chemicals from coal]]

Chemicals have been produced from coal since the 1950s. Coal is an important{{cn|date=December 2018}} feedstock in production of a wide range of chemical fertilizers and other chemical products. The main route to these products is [[coal gasification]] to produce [[syngas]]. Primary chemicals that are produced directly from the syngas include [[methanol]], [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon monoxide]], which are the chemical building blocks from which a whole spectrum of derivative chemicals are manufactured, including [[olefins]], [[acetic acid]], [[formaldehyde]], [[ammonia]], [[urea]] and others. The versatility of [[syngas]] as a precursor to primary chemicals and high-value derivative products provides the option of using relatively inexpensive{{cn|date=December 2018}} coal to produce a wide range of valuable commodities.

Because the slate of chemical products that can be made via coal gasification can in general also use feedstocks derived from [[natural gas]] and [[petroleum]], the chemical industry tends to use whatever feedstocks are most cost-effective. Therefore, interest in using coal tends to increase for higher oil and natural gas prices and during periods of high global economic growth that may strain oil and gas production. Also, production of chemicals from coal is of much higher interest in countries like South Africa, China, India and the United States where there are abundant coal resources. The abundance of coal combined with lack of natural gas resources in China is strong inducement for the coal to chemicals industry pursued there. Similarly, Sasol has built and operated coal-to-chemicals facilities in South Africa.

Coal to chemical processes require substantial quantities of water. Much coal to chemical production is in China&lt;ref name=OILDRUM9371&gt;{{cite web|title=China's Coal to Chemical Future|url=http://www.theoildrum.com/node/9371|publisher=The Oil Drum.Com|accessdate=3 March 2013|author="Rembrandt"|format=Blog post by expert|date=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ICIS022712&gt;{{cite news|title=China develops coal-to-olefins projects, which could lead to ethylene self-sufficiency|url=http://www.icis.com/Articles/2012/02/27/9535534/china-develops-coal-to-olefins-projects-which-could-lead-to-ethylene.html|author= Yin, Ken|accessdate=3 March 2013|newspaper=ICIS Chemical Business|date=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; where coal dependent provinces such as [[Shanxi]] are struggling to control its pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Smog war casualty: China coal city bears brunt of pollution crackdown |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-pollution-economy-insight/smog-war-casualty-china-coal-city-bears-brunt-of-pollution-crackdown-idUSKCN1NV2RB |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States coal-fired power plants were estimated in 2004 to cause nearly 24,000 premature deaths every year, including 2,800 from [[lung cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5174391/ "Deadly power plants?

Breathing in [[coal dust]] causes [[coalworker's pneumoconiosis]] which is known colloquially as "black lung", so-called because the coal dust literally turns the lungs black from their usual pink color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/lung/tc/black-lung-disease-topic-overview|title=Black Lung Disease-Topic Overview|work=WebMD|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710021533/http://www.webmd.com/lung/tc/black-lung-disease-topic-overview|archivedate=10 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States alone, it is estimated that 1,500 former employees of the coal industry die every year from the effects of breathing in coal mine dust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umwa.org/?q=content/black-lung|title=Black Lung|date=|work=umwa.org|accessdate=7 January 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203042713/http://www.umwa.org/?q=content%2Fblack-lung|archivedate=3 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 10% of coal is ash:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150720233354/http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energy-and-you/affect/coal.html|archivedate=20 July 2015|url=http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energy-and-you/affect/coal.html|title=Coal|work=epa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coal ash]] is hazardous and toxic to human beings and other living things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psr.org/environment-and-health/code-black/coal-ash-toxic-and-leaking.html|title=Coal Ash: Toxic – and Leaking|work=psr.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715170100/http://www.psr.org/environment-and-health/code-black/coal-ash-toxic-and-leaking.html|archivedate=15 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal ash contains the radioactive elements [[uranium]] and [[thorium]]. Coal ash and other solid combustion byproducts are stored locally and escape in various ways that expose those living near coal plants to radiation and environmental toxics.&lt;ref name="sa-coal-ash-more-rdactiv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste|title=Coal Ash Is More Radioactive than Nuclear Waste|author=Hvistendahl, Mara|work=Scientific American|date=13 December 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710171812/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste/|archivedate=10 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huge amounts of coal ash and other waste is produced annually. Use of coal generates hundreds of millions of tons of ash and other waste products every year. These include [[fly ash]], [[bottom ash]], and [[flue-gas desulfurization]] sludge, that contain [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[uranium]], [[thorium]], [[arsenic]], and other [[heavy metals]], along with non-metals such as [[selenium]].&lt;ref&gt;World Coal Association [http://www.worldcoal.org/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=127 "Environmental impact of Coal Use"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223203113/http://www.worldcoal.org/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=127 |date=23 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Lung Association]], the [[American Nurses' Association]], and the [[Physicians for Social Responsibility]] released a report in 2009 which details in depth the detrimental impact of the coal industry on human health, including workers in the mines and individuals living in communities near plants burning coal as a power source. This report provides medical information regarding damage to the lungs, heart, and nervous system of Americans caused by the burning of coal as fuel. It details how the air pollution caused by the plume of coal smokestack emissions is a cause of [[asthma]], [[strokes]], reduced [[intelligence]], [[artery]] blockages, [[heart attacks]], [[congestive heart failure]],[[cardiac arrhythmias]], [[mercury poisoning]], [[Stenosis|arterial occlusion]], and [[lung cancer]].&lt;ref name="psr_coal-damages-health"&gt;[http://www.psr.org/news-events/press-releases/coal-pollution-damages-human-health.html Coal Pollution Damages Human Health at Every Stage of Coal Life Cycle, Reports Physicians for Social Responsibility] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150731182839/http://www.psr.org/news-events/press-releases/coal-pollution-damages-human-health.html |date=31 July 2015 }}. ''Physicians for Social Responsibility''. psr.org (18 November 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the Chicago School of Public Health released a largely similar report, echoing many of the same findings.&lt;ref&gt;Burt, Erica; Orris, Peter and Buchanan, Susan (April 2013) [http://noharm.org/lib/downloads/climate/Coal_Literature_Review_2.pdf Scientific Evidence of Health Effects from Coal Use in Energy Generation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714193454/http://noharm.org/lib/downloads/climate/Coal_Literature_Review_2.pdf |date=14 July 2015 }}. University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health, Chicago, Illinois, US&lt;/ref&gt;

Though coal burning has increasingly been supplanted by less-toxic natural gas use in recent years, a 2010 study by the Clean Air Task Force still estimated that "air pollution from coal-fired power plants accounts for more than 13,000 premature deaths, 20,000 heart attacks, and 1.6 million lost workdays in the U.S. each year." The total monetary cost of these health impacts is over $100 billion annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rmi.org/RFGraph-health_effects_from_US_power_plant_emissions Estimated health effects from U.S. coal-fired power plant emissions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721050649/http://www.rmi.org/RFGraph-health_effects_from_US_power_plant_emissions |date=21 July 2015 }}. Rocky Mountain Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study in the ''Economic Journal'' found that for Britain during the period 1851–1860, "a one standard deviation increase in coal use raised infant mortality by 6–8% and that industrial coal use explains roughly one-third of the urban mortality penalty observed during this period."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beach|first=Brian|last2=Hanlon|first2=W.

===Environmental effects===

[[Coal mining]] and coal fueling of [[power station]] and industrial processes can cause major environmental damage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/coalvswind/c02c.html Environmental impacts of coal power: air pollution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115204952/http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/coalvswind/c02c.html |date=15 January 2008 }}. Union of Concerned Scientists&lt;/ref&gt;

Water systems are affected by coal mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Environmental Impact of Coal Mining on Water Regime and Its Management|author=Tiwary, R. K. |journal=Water, Air, &amp; Soil Pollution|year=2001|volume=132|pages=185–99|doi=10.1023/a:1012083519667}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, mining affects [[groundwater]] and [[water table]] levels and acidity. Spills of fly ash, such as the [[Kingston Fossil Plant coal fly ash slurry spill]], can also contaminate land and waterways, and destroy homes. Power stations that burn coal also consume large quantities of water. This can affect the flows of rivers, and has consequential impacts on other land uses. In areas of [[water scarcity]] such as the [[Thar Desert]] in [[Pakistan]] coal mining and coal power plants would use significant quantities of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=PAKISTAN’S COAL TRAP |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1387151 |work=Dawn |date=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest known impacts of coal on the [[water cycle]] was [[acid rain]]. Approximately 75 Tg/S per year of [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is released from burning coal. After release, the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to gaseous H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which scatters solar radiation, hence its increase in the atmosphere exerts a cooling effect on climate. This beneficially masks some of the warming caused by increased greenhouse gases. However, the sulfur is precipitated out of the atmosphere as acid rain in a matter of weeks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The oxidation rate and residence time of sulphur dioxide in the arctic atmosphere|author1=Barrie, L.A. |author2=Hoff, R.M. |journal=Atmospheric Environment|volume=18|issue=12|year=1984|pages=2711–22|doi=10.1016/0004-6981(84)90337-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years. Release of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; also contributes to the widespread acidification of ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;Human Impacts on Atmospheric Chemistry, by PJ Crutzen and J Lelieveld, Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Vol. 29: 17–45 (Volume publication date May 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Disused coal mines can also cause issues. Subsidence can occur above tunnels, causing damage to infrastructure or cropland. Coal mining can also cause long lasting fires, and it has been estimated that thousands of [[coal seam fire]]s are burning at any given time.&lt;ref name="Deep underground"&gt;{{cite news |work=Time Magazine |date=23 July 2010 |url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,2006195,00.html |author=Cray, Dan |title=Deep Underground, Miles of Hidden Wildfires Rage |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728003147/http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,2006195,00.html |archivedate=28 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there is a [[Coal seam fire#Germany|coal seam fire in Germany]] that has been burning since 1668, and is still burning in the 21st century.&lt;ref name="mineralienatlas"&gt;{{cite web | title = Das Naturdenkmal Brennender Berg bei Dudweiler | trans-title = The natural monument Burning Mountain in Dudweiler | language = German | work = Mineralienatlas | accessdate = 3 October 2016 | url = https://www.mineralienatlas.de/?l=3741 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of coke from coal produces [[ammonia]], coal tar, and gaseous compounds as by-products which if discharged to land, air or waterways can act as environmental pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = World Of Coke: Coke is a High Temperature Fuel|url = http://www.ustimes.com/WorldOfCoke/|website = www.ustimes.com|access-date = 16 January 2016|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151127154337/http://www.ustimes.com/WorldOfCoke/|archivedate = 27 November 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Whyalla steelworks]] is one example of a coke producing facility where liquid ammonia is discharged to the marine environment.

===Global Warming===

The largest and most long term effect of coal use is the release of carbon dioxide, a [[greenhouse gas]] that causes [[climate change]] and [[global warming]]. Coal is the largest contributor to the human-made increase of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/2007/IowaCoal_20071105.pdf Direct Testimony of James E. Hansen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203050832/http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/2007/IowaCoal_20071105.pdf |date=3 February 2009 }}. State of Iowa&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 world gross [[carbon dioxide emissions]] from coal usage were 14.5 giga tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Emissions |url=http://www.globalcarbonatlas.org/en/CO2-emissions |publisher=Global Carbon Atlas |accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For every megawatt-hour generated, coal-fired electric power generation emits around a tonne of carbon dioxide, which is double the approximately 500&amp;nbsp;kg of carbon dioxide released by a [[natural gas]]-fired electric plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=73&amp;t=11|title=How much carbon dioxide is produced when different fuels are burned?|date=|work=eia.gov|accessdate=7 January 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112095655/http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=73&amp;t=11|archivedate=12 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this higher carbon efficiency of natural gas generation, as the market in the United States has changed to reduce coal and increase natural gas generation, carbon dioxide emissions may have fallen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4d68744a-9cf8-11e5-b45d-4812f209f861.html#axzz3wP8OU8tQ|title=COP21: New research points to falling carbon dioxide emissions|date=|work=Financial Times|accessdate=7 January 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110151219/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4d68744a-9cf8-11e5-b45d-4812f209f861.html#axzz3wP8OU8tQ|archivedate=10 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those measured in the first quarter of 2012 were the lowest of any recorded for the first quarter of any year since 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Nuwer, Rachel (17 August 2012).

===Coal pollution mitigation===
{{Main|Coal pollution mitigation}}
{{See also|Clean coal technology}}

"Clean" coal technology usually addresses atmospheric problems resulting from burning coal. Historically, the primary focus was on SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, the most important gases which caused [[acid rain]], and [[particulates]] which cause visible air pollution and deleterious effects on human health. SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be removed by [[flue-gas desulfurization]] and NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by [[selective catalytic reduction]] (SCR). Particulates can be removed with [[electrostatic precipitator]]s. Although perhaps less efficient [[wet scrubber]]s can remove both gases and particulates. And [[mercury (element)|mercury]] emissions can be reduced up to 95%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mercury control from coal combustion |url=http://web.unep.org/globalmercurypartnership/our-work/mercury-control-coal-combustion |publisher=[[UNEP]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However capturing carbon dioxide emissions is generally not economically viable.

==== Standards ====
Local pollution standards include GB13223-2011 (China), India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=How can Indian power plants cost-effectively meet the new sulfur emission standards? Policy evaluation using marginal abatement cost-curves |journal=Energy Policy|volume=121|pages=124–137|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2018.06.008|year=2018 |last1=Sugathan |first1=Anish |last2=Bhangale|first2=Ritesh|last3=Kansal|first3=Vishal|last4=Hulke|first4=Unmil}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Industrial Emissions Directive]] (EU) and the [[Clean Air Act (United States)]].

==== Satellite Monitoring ====

Satellite monitoring is now used to crosscheck national data, for example that Chinese control of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has only been partially successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Quantifying coal power plant responses to tighter SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions standards in China|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=115|issue=27|pages=7004–7009|doi=10.1073/pnas.1800605115|pmid=29915085|pmc=6142229|year=2018 |last1=Karplus |first1=Valerie J. |last2=Zhang|first2=Shuang|last3=Almond|first3=Douglas}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also revealed that low use of technology such as SCR has resulted in high NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions in South Africa and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New satellite data analysis reveals world’s biggest NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions hotspots |url=https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/19072/greenpeace-analysis-of-new-satellite-data-reveals-worlds-biggest-no2-emissions-hotspots/ |publisher=Greenpeace International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gasification====
A few [[Integrated gasification combined cycle]] (IGCC) coal-fired power plants have been built with [[coal gasification]]. Although they burn coal more efficiently and therefore emit less pollution, the technology has not generally proved economically viable for coal, except possibly in Japan although this is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Universal failure: How IGCC coal plants waste money and emissions Nove |url=http://www.kikonet.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IGCC-and-emissions_eg_final.pdf |publisher=Kiko Network |accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Japan says no to high-emission coal power plants |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Japan-says-no-to-high-emission-coal-power-plants |work=Nikkei Asian Review |date=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Carbon capture and storage====

Although still being intensively researched and considered economically viable for some uses other than with coal; [[carbon capture and storage]] is being tested at the [[Petra Nova]] and [[Boundary Dam]] coal-fired power plants and so far has been found to be technically feasible but not economically viable for use with coal, due to reductions in the cost of solar PV technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Coal with Carbon Capture and Sequestration is not as Land Use Efficient as Solar Photovoltaic Technology for Climate Neutral Electricity Production |journal=[[Nature]] |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-31505-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transition away from coal==
In order to meet global climate goals and provide power to those that don't currently have it coal power must be reduced from nearly 10,000TWh to less than 2,000TWh by 2040.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Coal dumped as IEA turns to wind and solar to solve climate challenge |url=https://reneweconomy.com.au/coal-dumped-as-iea-turns-to-wind-and-solar-to-solve-climate-challenge-66916/ |work=Renew Economy |date=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries, such as the [[Powering Past Coal Alliance]], have now transitioned away from coal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sartor |first1=O. |title=Implementing coal transitions Insights from case studies of major coal-consuming economies |date=2018 |publisher=IDDRI and Climate Strategies. |url=https://coaltransitions.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/coal_synthesis_final.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; some using the ideas of a "just transition", for example to use some of the benefits of transition to provide early pensions for coal miners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Spain to close most coalmines in €250m transition deal |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/26/spain-to-close-most-coal-mines-after-striking-250m-deal |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump Loves It. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/opinion/epa-climate-environment-trump.html |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal alone may cost Australia billions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Labor opposes plan to indemnify new coal plants and warns it could cost billions |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/24/labor-opposes-plan-to-indemnify-new-coal-plants-warns-it-could-cost-billions |work=The Guardian |date=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas costs to some smaller companies or cities could be on the scale of millions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Superfund Scandal Leads to Prison Time for Coal Lobbyist, Lawyer |url=https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/birmingham-superfund-scandal-leads-prison-time-for-coal-lobbyist-lawyer-drummond |publisher=Sierra Club |date=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economies most damaged by coal (via climate change) may be India and the US as they are the countries with the highest [[social cost of carbon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Country-level social cost of carbon |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0282-y |accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China is the largest producer of coal in the world. It is the world's largest energy consumer, and [[coal in China]] supplies 60% of its primary energy. However two fifths of China's coal power stations are estimated to be loss-making.&lt;ref name="CarbTrk2018" /&gt;

Air pollution from coal storage and handling costs the USA almost 200 dollars for every extra ton stored, due to PM2.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The local air pollution cost of coal storage and handling: Evidence from U.S. power plants |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0095069618302523}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal pollution costs the EU €43 billion each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The human cost of coal in the UK: 1600 deaths a year|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22029461.800-the-human-cost-of-coal-in-the-uk-1600-deaths-a-year.html|publisher=New Scientist|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424025154/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22029461.800-the-human-cost-of-coal-in-the-uk-1600-deaths-a-year.html|archivedate=24 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measures to cut air pollution have beneficial long-term economic impacts for individuals and countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2014/02/environmentalism|title=Environmentalism|date=4 February 2014|work=The Economist|accessdate=7 January 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128191945/http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2014/02/environmentalism|archivedate=28 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Air Pollution and Health in Bulgaria |url=http://env-health.org/IMG/pdf/heal_briefing_air_bulgaria_eng.pdf |publisher=HEAL |accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsidies===
Broadly defined total subsidies for coal in 2015 have been estimated at around 2.5 trillion USD, about 3% of global [[GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=How Large Are Global Fossil Fuel Subsidies? |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X16304867}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government funding for new coal power plants is being supplied via [[Exim Bank of China]],&lt;ref name="Urgewald 2018"&gt;{{cite web |title=Regional Briefings for the 2018 Coal Plant Developers List |url=https://coalexit.org/sites/default/files/inline-files/Regional%20Briefings%20CPDL_10-04-2018_final.pdf |publisher=Urgewald |accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Japan Bank for International Cooperation]] and Indian public sector banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The World Needs to Quit Coal.

===Stranded assets===
Some coal-fired power stations could become [[stranded assets]], for example [[China Energy Investment]], the world's largest power company, risks losing half its capital.&lt;ref name="CarbTrk2018" /&gt; However state owned electricity utilities such as [[Eskom]] in South Africa, [[Perusahaan Listrik Negara]] in Indonesia, [[Sarawak Energy]] in Malaysia, [[Taipower]] in Taiwan, [[EGAT]] in Thailand, [[Vietnam Electricity]] and [[EÜAŞ]] in Turkey are building or planning new plants.&lt;ref name="Urgewald 2018" /&gt;

==Politics==
Countries building or financing new coal-fired power stations, such as Japan, face mounting international criticism for obstructing the aims of the [[Paris Agreement]].&lt;ref name="Cornot-Gandolfe 2018" /&gt;

===Corruption===
Allegations of corruption are being investigated in India&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Coal scam: Naveen Jindal, others summoned |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/coal-scam-naveen-jindal-others-summoned-as-accused-in-money-laundering-case/articleshow/65405188.cms |work=Times of India |date=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=China Tackling Corruption, Safety Concerns in Coal Production |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/china-tackling-corruption-safety-concerns-coal-production |publisher=Worldwatch |accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy density==
{{Main|Energy value of coal}}
The [[energy density]] of coal, i.e. its [[heating value]], is roughly 24 [[megajoule]]s per kilogram&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Fisher | first = Juliya | title = Energy Density of Coal | work = The Physics Factbook | url = http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/JuliyaFisher.shtml | year = 2003 | accessdate = 25 August 2006 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061107152122/http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/JuliyaFisher.shtml | archivedate = 7 November 2006 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (approximately 6.7 [[kilowatt-hours]] per kg). For a coal power plant with a 40% efficiency, it takes an estimated {{convert|325|kg|abbr=on}} of coal to power a 100&amp;nbsp;W lightbulb for one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = How much coal is required to run a 100-watt light bulb 24 hours a day for a year?| work = Howstuffworks| url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/question481.htm| accessdate = 25 August 2006| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060807235142/http://science.howstuffworks.com/question481.htm| archivedate = 7 August 2006| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2006, the average efficiency of electricity-generating power stations was 31%; in 2002, coal represented about 23% of total global energy supply, an equivalent of 3.4 billion tonnes of coal, of which 2.8 billion tonnes were used for electricity generation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euractiv.com/energy/analysis-efficiency-coal-fired-power-stations-evolution-prospects/article-154672 Analysis: Efficiency of coal-fired power stations – evolution and prospects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001195938/http://www.euractiv.com/energy/analysis-efficiency-coal-fired-power-stations-evolution-prospects/article-154672 |date=2011-10-01 }}.

==Underground fires==
{{Main|Coal seam fire}}
Thousands of coal fires are burning around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sino German Coal fire project |url=http://www.coalfire.caf.dlr.de/projectareas/world_wide_distribution_en.html |accessdate=9 September 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050830091254/http://www.coalfire.caf.dlr.de/projectareas/world_wide_distribution_en.html |archivedate=30 August 2005 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those burning underground can be difficult to locate and many cannot be extinguished. Fires can cause the ground above to subside, their combustion gases are dangerous to life, and breaking out to the surface can initiate surface [[wildfire]]s. Coal seams can be set on fire by [[spontaneous combustion]] or contact with a [[mine fire]] or surface fire. Lightning strikes are an important source of ignition. The coal continues to burn slowly back into the seam until oxygen (air) can no longer reach the flame front. A grass fire in a coal area can set dozens of coal seams on fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Committee on Resources-Index |url=http://resourcescommittee.house.gov/archives/108/testimony/johnmasterson.htm |accessdate=9 September 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050825231038/http://resourcescommittee.house.gov/archives/108/testimony/johnmasterson.htm |archivedate=25 August 2005 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Snapshots 2003 |work=fire.blm.gov |url=http://www.fire.blm.gov/textdocuments/6-27-03.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218013724/http://www.fire.blm.gov/textdocuments/6-27-03.pdf |archivedate=18 February 2006 |accessdate=9 September 2005 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal fires in China burn an estimated 120 million tons of coal a year, emitting 360 million metric tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, amounting to 2–3% of the annual worldwide production of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from [[fossil fuel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EHP 110-5, 2002: Forum |url=http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/docs/2002/110-5/forum.html |accessdate=9 September 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050731081620/http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/docs/2002/110-5/forum.html |archivedate=31 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview about ITC's activities in China |url=http://www.itc.nl/personal/coalfire/activities/overview.html |accessdate=9 September 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050616004903/http://www.itc.nl/personal/coalfire/activities/overview.html |archivedate=16 June 2005 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Centralia, Pennsylvania]] (a [[Borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]] located in the [[Coal Region]] of the United States), an exposed vein of anthracite ignited in 1962 due to a trash fire in the borough landfill, located in an abandoned [[anthracite coal|anthracite]] [[Surface mining|strip mine]] pit.

At Kuh i Malik in [[Yagnob Valley]], [[Tajikistan]], coal deposits have been burning for thousands of years, creating vast underground labyrinths full of unique minerals, some of them very beautiful.

The reddish siltstone rock that caps many ridges and buttes in the [[Powder River Basin]] in [[Wyoming]] and in western [[North Dakota]] is called ''porcelanite'', which resembles the coal burning waste "clinker" or volcanic "[[scoria]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=North Dakota's Clinker | url=http://www.state.nd.us/ndgs/ndnotes/ndn13_h.htm | accessdate=9 September 2005 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050914120008/http://www.state.nd.us/ndgs/NDNotes/ndn13_h.htm | archivedate=14 September 2005 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinker is rock that has been fused by the natural burning of coal.

==Market trends==
Of the [[List of countries by coal production|countries which produce coal]] China mines by far the most, almost half the world's coal, followed by less than 10% by India. China is also by far the largest consumer. Therefore, market trends depend on [[Energy policy of China|Chinese energy policy]]. Although the effort to reduce pollution means that the global long term trend is to burn less coal, the short and medium term trends may differ, in part due to Chinese financing of new coal-fired power plants in other countries.&lt;ref name="Cornot-Gandolfe 2018"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cornot-Gandolfe |first1=Sylvie |title=A Review of Coal Market Trends and Policies in 2017|date=May 2018 |publisher=Ifri |url=https://www.ifri.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/cornot_gandolphe_coal_exit_2018.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peak coal===
[[File:Coal mine Wyoming.jpg|thumb|A coal mine in [[Wyoming]], United States. The United States has the world's largest coal reserves.]]

{{main|Peak coal}}

Although many countries have coal underground not all will be consumed.

Of the three fossil fuels, coal has the most widely distributed reserves; coal is mined in over 100 countries{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}, and on all continents except Antarctica. The largest reserves are found in the United States, Russia, China, Australia and India:

Some cultures hold that children who misbehave will receive only a lump of coal from [[Santa Claus]] for Christmas in their [[christmas stocking]]s instead of presents.

It is also customary and considered lucky in Scotland and the North of England to give coal as a gift on New Year's Day. This occurs as part of [[First-Foot]]ing and represents warmth for the year to come.

'''Cocamidopropyl betaine''' ('''CAPB''') is a mixture of closely related [[organic compound]]s derived from [[coconut oil]] and [[dimethylaminopropylamine]].&lt;ref&gt;Christian Nitsch, Hans-Joachim Heitland, Horst Marsen, Hans-Joachim Schlüussler, "Cleansing Agents" in ''Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{doi|10.1002/14356007.a07_137}}&lt;/ref&gt; CAPB is available as a viscous pale yellow solution and it is used as a [[surfactant]] in personal care products.  The name reflects that the major part of the molecule, the [[lauric acid]] group, is derived from coconut oil.  Cocamidopropyl betaine to a significant degree has replaced [[cocamide DEA]].

==Production==
Despite the name cocamidopropyl betaine is not synthesized from [[glycine betaine|betaine]]. Instead it is produced in a two step manner, beginning with the reaction of [[dimethylaminopropylamine]] (DMAPA) with fatty acids from coconut oil (mainly [[lauric acid]] or its methyl ester). The primary amine in DMAPA is more reactive than the tertiary amine, leading to its selective addition to form an amide. In the second step [[chloroacetic acid]] reacts with the remaining tertiary amine to form quaternary a ammonium center (a quaternization reaction).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Amines: Synthesis, Properties and Applications | author = Stephen A. Lawrence | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = 2004 | page = 281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==
CAPB is a [[fatty acid amide]] containing a long hydrocarbon chain at one end and a polar group at the other.  This allows CAPB to act as a surfactant and as a [[detergent]].  It is a [[zwitterion]], consisting of both a [[quaternary ammonium cation]] and a [[carboxylate]].

== Specifications and properties==
Cocamidopropyl betaine is used as a foam booster in shampoos.&lt;ref name="RiegerRhein1997"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Reich|first=Charles|editor1=Martin M. Rieger|editor2=Linda D. Rhein|encyclopedia=Surfactants in Cosmetics|title=Hair Cleansers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2DcyKqj6dDsC&amp;pg=PA361|accessdate=9 December 2012|edition=2nd|series=Surfactant Science Series|volume=68|year=1997|publisher=Marcel Dekker, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8247-9805-5|page=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a medium strength surfactant also used in bath products like [[hand soap]]s.  It is also used in [[cosmetics]] as an [[emulsifying agent]] and [[thickener]], and to reduce irritation purely ionic [[surfactant]]s would cause. It also serves as an [[antistatic agent]] in [[hair conditioner]]s, which most often does not irritate [[skin]] or [[mucous membrane]]s. However, some studies indicate it is an allergen.&lt;ref name="deGroot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BrandR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mowad"/&gt; It also has [[antiseptic]] properties, making it suitable for personal sanitary products. It is compatible with other cationic, anionic, and nonionic surfactants.

CAPB is obtained as an aqueous solution in concentrations of about 30%.

Typical impurities of leading manufacturers today:
*[[chloroacetic acid|Sodium monochloroacetate]]	&lt; 5 ppm
*[[Amidoamine]] (AA)		   &lt; 0.3%
*[[dimethylaminopropylamine]] (DMAPA) 			   &lt; 15 ppm
*[[Glycerol]]			&lt; 3%

The impurities AA and DMAPA are most critical, as they have been shown to be responsible for skin sensitation reactions. These by-products can be avoided by a moderate excess chloroacetate and the exact adjustment of pH value during betainization reaction accompanied by regular analytical control.

'''Critical exponents''' describe the behavior of physical quantities near continuous [[phase transitions]]. It is believed, though not proven, that they are universal, i.e. they do not depend on the details of the physical system, but only on
* the dimension of the system
* the range of the interaction
* the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] dimension

These properties of critical exponents are supported by experimental data. Analytical results can be theoretically achieved in [[mean field theory]] for higher-dimensional systems (4 or more dimensions). The theoretical treatment of lower-dimensional systems (1 or 2 dimensions) is more difficult and requires the [[renormalization group]] approach.
Phase transitions and critical exponents appear also in percolation systems.
However, here the critical dimension above which mean field exponents are valid is 6 and higher dimensions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-84868-1_2|title=Fractals and Disordered Systems|last=Bunde|first=Armin|last2=Havlin|first2=Shlomo|date=1996|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|year=|isbn=9783642848704|location=|pages=59–114|language=en|chapter=Percolation I|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-84868-1_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mean field critical exponents are also valid for random graphs, such as Erdős–Rényi graphs, which can be regarded as infinite dimensional systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511780356.001|title=Complex Networks: Structure, Robustness and Function|last=Cohen|first=Reuven|last2=Havlin|first2=Shlomo|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9780521841566|location=|pages=1–6|language=en|chapter=Introduction|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511780356.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
[[Phase transitions]] occur at a certain temperature, called the [[critical temperature]] {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}}. We want to describe the behavior of a physical quantity {{math|''f''}} in terms of a [[power law]] around the critical temperature; we introduce the [[reduced temperature]]

:&lt;math&gt;\tau := \frac{T-T_\mathrm{c}}{T_\mathrm{c}}&lt;/math&gt;

which is zero at the [[phase transition]], and define the critical exponent &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;k \, \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \, \lim_{\tau \to 0}\frac{\log |f(\tau)| }{\log |\tau|}&lt;/math&gt;

This results in the power law we were looking for:
:&lt;math&gt; f(\tau) \propto \tau^k \,, \quad \tau\approx 0 &lt;/math&gt;

It is important to remember that this represents the asymptotic behavior of the function {{math|''f''(''τ'')}} as {{math|''τ'' → 0}}.

More generally one might expect
:&lt;math&gt;f(\tau)=A \tau^k \left(1+b\tau ^{k_1} + \cdots\right) &lt;/math&gt;

==The most important critical exponents==
Below {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}} the system has two different phases characterized by an [[order parameter]] {{math|''Ψ''}}, which vanishes at and above {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Let us consider the [[disordered phase]] ({{math|''τ'' &gt; 0}}), [[ordered phase]] ({{math|''τ'' &lt; 0}}) and [[critical temperature]] ({{math|''τ'' {{=}} 0}}) phases separately. Following the standard convention, the critical exponents related to the ordered phase are primed. It is also another standard convention to use superscript/subscript + (−) for the disordered (ordered) state. We have [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] in the ordered phase. So, we will arbitrarily take any solution in the phase.

The critical exponents can be derived from the specific free energy {{math|''f''(''J'',''T'')}} as a function of the source and temperature. The correlation length can be derived from the [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] {{math|''F''[''J'';''T'']}}.

These relations are accurate close to the critical point in two- and three-dimensional systems. In four dimensions, however, the power laws are modified by logarithmic factors. This problem does not appear in [[dimensional regularization|3.99 dimensions]], though.{{Citation needed|reason=This is not common knowledge|date=May 2018}}

== Mean field critical exponents of Ising-like systems ==

The classical [[Landau theory]] (also known as [[mean field theory]]) values of the critical exponents for a scalar field (of which the Ising model is the prototypical example) are given by

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \alpha^\prime = 0\,, \quad \beta = \tfrac{1}{2}\,, \quad \gamma = \gamma^\prime = 1\,, \quad \delta = 3&lt;/math&gt;

If we add derivative terms turning it into a mean field [[Ginzburg–Landau theory]], we get

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = 0\,, \quad \nu = \tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

One of the major discoveries in the study of critical phenomena is that mean field theory of critical points is only correct when the space dimension of the system is four or higher (which unfortunately excludes many of the experimentally relevant cases). This dimension is called the [[critical dimension#Upper critical dimension in field theory|upper critical dimension]]. The problem with mean field theory is that the critical exponents do not depend on the space dimension. This leads to a quantitative discrepancy in space dimensions 2 and 3, where the true critical exponents differ from the mean field values. It leads to a qualitative discrepancy in space dimension 1, where a critical point in fact no longer exists, even though mean field theory still predicts there is one. The space dimension where mean field theory becomes qualitatively incorrect is called the lower critical dimension.

== Experimental values ==

The most accurately measured value of {{math|''α''}} is −0.0127(3) for the phase transition of [[superfluid]] [[helium]] (the so-called [[lambda transition]]). The value was measured on a space shuttle to minimize pressure differences in the sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Specific heat of liquid helium in zero gravity very near the lambda point |last1=Lipa |first=J. A. |journal=Physical Review B |volume=68 |page=174518 |year=2003 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.68.174518 |last2=Nissen |first2=J. |last3=Stricker |first3=D. |last4=Swanson |first4=D. |last5=Chui |first5=T. |arxiv=cond-mat/0310163 |bibcode=2003PhRvB..68q4518L |issue=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This value is in a significant disagreement with the most precise theoretical determination by a combination of [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] and high temperature expansion techniques. Other techniques give results in agreement in the experiment but are less precise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |year=2007 |title=Critical phenomena and renormalization-group ﬂow of multi-parameter Φ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; ﬁeld theories |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/0709.1014v2.pdf |first=Ettore |last=Vicari |page=7 (Table 2) |conference=The XXV International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory, July 30 - August 4, 2007, Regensburg, Germany |arxiv=0709.1014v2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scaling functions ==
In light of the critical scalings, we can reexpress all thermodynamic quantities in terms of dimensionless quantities. Close enough to the critical point, everything can be reexpressed in terms of certain ratios of the powers of the reduced quantities. These are the scaling functions.

The origin of scaling functions can be seen from the renormalization group. The critical point is an [[infrared fixed point]]. In a sufficiently small neighborhood of the critical point, we may linearize the action of the renormalization group. This basically means that rescaling the system by a factor of {{math|''a''}} will be equivalent to rescaling operators and source fields by a factor of {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;''Δ''&lt;/sup&gt;}} for some {{math|''Δ''}}. So, we may reparameterize all quantities in terms of rescaled scale independent quantities.

== Scaling relations ==
It was believed for a long time that the critical exponents were the same above and below the critical temperature, e.g. {{math|''α'' ≡ ''α''′}} or {{math|''γ'' ≡ ''γ''′}}. It has now been shown that this is not necessarily true: When a continuous symmetry is explicitly broken down to a discrete symmetry by irrelevant (in the renormalization group sense) anisotropies, then the exponents {{math|''γ''}} and {{math|''γ''′}} are not identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leonard|first1=F.|last2=Delamotte|first2=B.|year = 2015|title=Critical exponents can be different on the two sides of a transition| url = | journal = Phys. Rev. Lett. | volume = 115 | issue = 20| page = 200601 | arxiv = 1508.07852|bibcode = 2015PhRvL.115t0601L| doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.200601 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical exponents are denoted by Greek letters. They fall into [[universality classes]] and obey the [[scaling relation]]s

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\nu d &amp;= 2 - \alpha = 2\beta + \gamma = \beta(\delta + 1) = \gamma \frac{\delta + 1}{\delta - 1} \\
2 - \eta &amp;= \frac{\gamma}{\nu} = d \frac{\delta - 1}{\delta + 1}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These equations imply that there are only two independent exponents, e.g., {{math|''ν''}} and {{math|''η''}}. All this follows from the theory of the [[renormalization group]].

== Anisotropy ==

There are some [[anisotropic]] systems where the correlation length is direction dependent. For percolation see Dayan et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dayan|first=I.|last2=Gouyet|first2=J.F.|last3=Havlin|first3=S.|date=1991|title=Percolation in multi-layered structures|url=|journal=J. Phys. A|volume=24|issue=6|pages=L287|via=|bibcode=1991JPhA...24L.287D|doi=10.1088/0305-4470/24/6/007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Directed percolation can be also regarded as anisotropic percolation. In this case the critical exponents are different and the upper critical dimension is 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kinzel|first=W.|date=1982|editor-last=Deutscher|editor-first=G.|title=Directed Percolation|url=|journal=Percolation and Processes|location=Bristol|publisher=Adam Hilger Pub. Co.|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Multicritical points ==
More complex behavior may occur at [[multicritical point]]s, at the border or on intersections of critical manifolds. For a simple model with multicritical points see reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Majdandzic|first=A.|last2=Podobnik|first2=B.|last3=Buldyrev|first3=S.V.|last4=Kenett|first4=D.Y.|last5=Havlin|first5=S.|last6=Stanley|first6=H.E.|date=2014|title=Spontaneous recovery in dynamical networks|url=|journal=Nature Physics|volume=10|pages=34|via=|bibcode=2014NatPh..10...34M|doi=10.1038/nphys2819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Static versus dynamic properties==
The above examples exclusively refer to the static properties of a critical system. However dynamic properties of the system may become critical, too. Especially, the characteristic time, {{math|''τ''&lt;sub&gt;char&lt;/sub&gt;}}, of a system diverges as {{math|''τ''&lt;sub&gt;char&lt;/sub&gt; ∝ ''ξ&lt;sup&gt;z&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, with a ''dynamical exponent'' {{math|''z''}}. Moreover, the large ''static universality classes'' of equivalent models with identical static critical exponents decompose into smaller ''dynamical universality classes'', if one demands that also the dynamical exponents are identical. For critical exponents for dynamics in percolation systems see reference.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The critical exponents can be computed from [[conformal field theory]].

See also [[anomalous scaling dimension]].

== Transport properties ==
Critical exponents also exist for transport quantities like [[viscosity]] and [[heat conductivity]]. A recent study suggests that critical exponents of percolation play an important role in city traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeng|first=Guanwen|last2=Li|first2=Daqing|last3=Gao|first3=Liang|last4=Gao|first4=Ziyou|last5=Havlin|first5=Shlomo|date=2017-09-10|title=Switch of critical percolation modes in dynamical city traffic|arxiv=1709.03134|bibcode=2017arXiv170903134Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Self-organized criticality ==
Critical exponents also exist for self organized criticality for [[dissipative system]]s.

==Percolation Theory==
Phase transitions and critical exponents appear also in percolation processes where the concentration of occupied sites or links play the role of temperature. See [[percolation critical exponents]]. For percolation the critical exponents are different from Ising. For example, in the mean field &lt;math&gt;\delta = 2&lt;/math&gt;  for  percolation&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; compared to &lt;math&gt;\delta = 3&lt;/math&gt; for Ising.

A good dielectric gas should have high [[dielectric strength]], high thermal stability and chemical inertness against the construction materials used, non-flammability and low [[toxicity]], low [[boiling point]], good [[heat transfer]] properties, and low cost.&lt;ref name="hveng"&gt;{{cite book|author1=M S Naidu|author2=NAIDU M S|title=High Voltage Engineering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RF-MvfqYMagC&amp;pg=PA35|accessdate=17 April 2011|date=22 November 1999|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-136108-8|pages=35–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common dielectric gas is [[air]], due to its ubiquity and low cost. Another commonly used gas is a dry [[nitrogen]].

In special cases, e.g., high voltage switches, gases with good dielectric properties and very high [[breakdown voltage]]s are needed. Highly [[electronegative]] elements, e.g., [[halogen]]s, are favored as they rapidly [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombine]] with the [[ion]]s present in the discharge channel. The halogen gases are highly [[corrosive]]. Other compounds, which dissociate only in the discharge pathway, are therefore preferred; [[sulfur hexafluoride]], [[organofluorides]] (especially [[perfluorocarbon]]s) and [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s are the most common.

The breakdown voltage of gases is roughly proportional to their [[density]]. Breakdown voltages also increase with the gas pressure. Many gases have limited upper pressure due to their [[liquefaction]].

The decomposition products of [[halogenated compound]]s are highly corrosive, hence the occurrence of [[corona discharge]] should be prevented.

Build-up of [[moisture]] can degrade dielectric properties of the gas. [[Moisture analysis]] is used for early detection of this.

Dielectric gases can also serve as [[coolant]]s.

[[Vacuum]] is an alternative for gas in some applications.

Mixtures of gases can be used where appropriate. Addition of sulfur hexafluoride can dramatically improve the dielectric properties of poorer insulators, e.g. helium or nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul G. Slade|title=The vacuum interrupter: theory, design, and application|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uJT4mENgMbQC&amp;pg=PA433|accessdate=17 April 2011|year=2008|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-9091-3|pages=433–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multicomponent gas mixtures can offer superior dielectric properties; the optimum mixtures combine the electron attaching gases ([[sulfur hexafluoride]], [[octafluorocyclobutane]]) with molecules capable of thermalizing (slowing) accelerated electrons (e.g. [[tetrafluoromethane]], [[fluoroform]]. The insulator properties of the gas are controlled by the combination of electron attachment, [[electron scattering]], and [[electron ionization]].&lt;ref&gt;Ramapriya Parthasarathy [http://scholarship.rice.edu/bitstream/handle/1911/18011/3021170.PDF?sequence=1 Use of Rydberg Atoms as a Microscale Laboratory to Probe Low-Energy Electron-Molecule Interactions]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Atmospheric pressure]] significantly influences the insulation properties of air. High-voltage applications, e.g. xenon flash lamps, can experience electrical breakdowns at high altitudes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3542">In [[mathematics]], the '''distortion''' is a measure of the amount by which a [[function (mathematics)|function]] from the [[Euclidean plane]] to itself distorts circles to ellipses.  If the distortion of a function is equal to one, then it is [[conformal map|conformal]]; if the distortion is bounded and the function is a [[homeomorphism]], then it is [[quasiconformal mapping|quasiconformal]].  The distortion of a function ƒ of the plane is given by

:&lt;math&gt;H(z,f)  = \limsup_{r\to 0}\frac{\max_{|h|=r}|f(z+h)-f(z)|}{\min_{|h|=r}|f(z+h)-f(z)|}&lt;/math&gt;

which is the limiting eccentricity of the ellipse produced by applying ƒ to small circles centered at&amp;nbsp;''z''.  This geometrical definition is often very difficult to work with, and the necessary analytical features can be extrapolated to the following definition.  A mapping ''ƒ''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;Ω&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; from an open domain in the plane to the plane has finite distortion at a point ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;Ω if ''ƒ'' is in the [[Sobolev space]] W{{su|p=1,1|b=loc}}(Ω,&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian determinant]] J(''x'',ƒ) is locally integrable and does not change sign in Ω, and there is a measurable function ''K''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1 such that

:&lt;math&gt;|Df(x)|^2 \le K(x)|J(x,f)| &lt;/math&gt;

almost everywhere.  Here ''Df'' is the [[weak derivative]] of ƒ, and |''Df''| is the [[Hilbert–Schmidt norm]].

For functions on a higher-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, there are more measures of distortion because there are more than two [[Principal axis theorem|principal axes]] of a symmetric tensor.  The pointwise information is contained in the ''distortion tensor''

:&lt;math&gt;G(x,f) =
\begin{cases}
|J(x,f)^{-2/n}D^Tf(x)Df(x)&amp;\text{if }J(x,f)\not=0\\
I &amp;\text{if }J(x,f)=0.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The outer distortion ''K''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; and inner distortion ''K''&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; are defined via the [[Rayleigh quotient]]s

:&lt;math&gt;K_O(x) = \sup_{\xi\not=0}\frac{\langle G(x)\xi,\xi\rangle^{n/2}}{|\xi|^n},\quad K_O(x) = \sup_{\xi\not=0}\frac{\langle G^{-1}(x)\xi,\xi\rangle^{n/2}}{|\xi|^n}.&lt;/math&gt;

The outer distortion can also be characterized by means of an inequality similar to that given in the two-dimensional case.  If Ω is an open set in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, then a function {{nowrap|&amp;fnof; &amp;isin; W{{su|p=1,1|b=loc}}(&amp;Omega;,'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} has finite distortion if its Jacobian is locally integrable and does not change sign, and there is a measurable function ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''O''&lt;/sub&gt; (the outer distortion) such that

:&lt;math&gt;|Df(x)|^n \le K_O(x)|J(x,f)| &lt;/math&gt;

almost everywhere.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1896">'''Electron Power Systems, Inc.''' of [[Acton, Massachusetts]], [[United States]], claims to have developed a technology for maintaining small stable [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] toroids called '''electron spiral toroids''' ('''ESTs''') which remain stable in [[Earth's atmosphere]] without the use of any special [[magnetic field]]s. They claim to have created these toroids in the laboratory, and to have developed a mathematical model for them that is similar to some explanations for [[ball lightning]]. An EST may be a special case of a [[spheromak]].

Because of EST's claimed lack of need for an external stabilizing magnetic field, EPS hope to be able to create small efficient [[fusion reactor]]s by colliding magnetically accelerated ESTs together at speeds high enough to induce ballistic [[nuclear fusion]].

Their model for their reported toroidal phenomena was extensively criticised by a December 2000 technical report commissioned by NASA. {{As of|2004}}, EPS claim to have met the criticisms of the NASA report, and to have demonstrated that their model is mathematically sound, and state that they are ready to proceed with development of their technology.

'''Energy in Angola''' describes [[World energy resources and consumption|energy]] and [[Electricity generation|electricity]] production, consumption and export from [[Angola]]. The energy policy of Angola reflects [[energy policy]] and the [[politics of Angola]].

[[Biomass]] accounts for 58% of the country's energy consumption; oil accounts for 35%, gas 4% and hydroelectric power 3%.

Primary energy use in 2009 in Angola was 138 TWh and 7 TWh per million persons.&lt;ref name=IEA2010&gt;[http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2011/key_world_energy_stats.pdf IEA Key energy statistics 2011] Page: Country specific indicator numbers from page 48&lt;/ref&gt;

Angolans suffer frequent daily blackouts{{when|date=November 2016}}. In 2012, days before the election, the government announced $17B US in planned energy investment, designed to alleviate the paucity of available energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/21561939 | work=The Economist | title=By hook or by crook | date=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- wasn't son of president in charge of that? --&gt;

[[Demographics of Angola|Angolan]] [[World population|population]] has increased 19.4 percent in the five years 2004-2009.

==Hydroelectricity==
[[Angola]] has extensive hydroelectric power resources that far exceed its present needs. The [[Capanda Dam]], on the [[Cuanza River]], provides [[Luanda]]'s industries with cheap power. Two dams on the [[Catumbela River]] produce power for the [[Lobito]] and [[Benguela]] areas ([[Lomaum Dam]]). [[Cambambe Hydroelectric Power Station|Matala Dam]] 180&amp;nbsp;km of [[Lubango]] provides power to [[Lubango]] and [[Moçâmedes]]. The [[Ruacaná Falls Dam]], near the [[Namibia]]n border, was completed in the late 1970s, but the power station is in Namibia. A 520&amp;nbsp;MW hydroelectric station on the Cuanza River at Kapanda was tentatively scheduled to have begun production in early 2003. As of late 2002, only three of the country's six dams (Cambambe, Biopo, and Matala) were operational; US$200&amp;nbsp;million has been allocated to repair the remaining dams, which suffered major damage in the civil war. In 2002, electricity generation was 1.728&amp;nbsp;TW·h, of which 34.5% came from fossil fuels and 65.5% from hydropower. In the same year, consumption of electricity totaled 1.607&amp;nbsp;TW·h. Total capacity in 2002 was 700&amp;nbsp;MW. Electricity is produced by [[Empresa Nacional de Electricidade de Angola]].

==Crude oil==
Angola ranks second in crude oil production in sub-Saharan Africa. Oil has been Angola’s chief export since 1973; it  also accounts for half the gross domestic product&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://panamapapers.investigativecenters.org/angola-2/|title=Real owners of Angolan oil royalty beneficiary unknown|author= Khadija Sharife|via=African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting|publisher=International Consortium of Investigative Journalists|work=#Panama Papers|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and is the leading source of government revenue, accounting for $2.9 billion in exports in 1994, or 95% of the total. At the end of 2004, Angola had proven oil reserves of 8.8 billion barrels (1.40&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Oil reserves are along the Atlantic coast, mostly off the shore of [[Cabinda Province]] and the northern border area between {{ILL|Quinzau|sv}} and [[Soyo]]. In 1999, several oil companies were engaged in oil production, of which the largest was a subsidiary of [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], Cabinda Gulf Oil Company. This company has a 49/51% participation agreement with [[Sonangol]], the state's oil company. Other firms included [[Fina Petróleos de Angola]] (a Belgian subsidiary), [[Elf Aquitaine]], and [[Texaco]]. In 2004, crude oil production averaged {{convert|991000|oilbbl/d}}. [[ExxonMobil]] subsidiary [[Esso]] began development of a section of the Xikomba offshore oilfield in August 2002. Production there ceased in August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-08-03/exxon-mobil-to-end-oil-production-at-xikomba-field-in-angola-1-|title=Exxon Mobil Ends Oil Output at Xikomba Field in Angola |publisher=Bloomberg|date=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lobito refinery===
Development has been planned but much delayed, of a new {{convert|200000|oilbbl/d|adj=on}} refinery in the city of [[Lobito]], on the coast. The Angolan state-owned oil company Sonangol would have a 70 percent stake in the [[Sonaref]] refinery at Lobito, its then-head Carlos Saturnino said in 2006, and the Chinese oil company [[Sinopec]] would retain the remainder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.macauhub.com.mo/en/2006/03/22/729/|title=Angola’s Sonangol to have 70 percent stake in Lobito refinery |date=March 22, 2006|publisher=Macauhub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oil in the Angolan economy===
Angola's economy was profoundly affected by the sharp drop in oil prices in 2014. This is even though new skyscrapers, appeared in Luanda; offices, shopping centres and apartment buildings proliferated in a "mini-golden age" as leading economist [[Alves da Rocha]] called it, from 2003-2008. Yet "probably three quarters" of the population of Luanda live in "tumbledown slums".&lt;ref name=FT&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/f38ab97a-c752-11e1-8865-00144feabdc0|title= Nation dominated by a rich elite: A petro-economy offers opportunities only for the few|author1=Tom Burgis| author2=David White|date=July 17, 2012|publisher=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two thirds of the 16.5 million people in Angola live on less than $2 a day, according to the [[World Bank]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/ozatp-angola-refinery-idAFJOE67O0HH20100825|title=Angola to start building new refinery this year|date=August 25, 2010 | agency=Reuters|author=Carolina Barros}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the oil industry employs less than one percent of the workforce.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt;

Foreigners, including Chinese construction companies and several hundred thousand Chinese workers, and as many or more Portuguese and Brazilian trade and finance consultants and managers. Oil clompanies set up shop in Angola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cmi.no/news/1671-angola-from-boom-to-bust-to-breaking-point|title=Angola from boom to bust – to breaking point|date= April 8, 2016|website=CMI|publisher=Chr. Michelsen Institute for Science and Intellectual Freedom|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural gas==
Gross natural gas production totaled {{convert|8.4|km3|ft3|abbr=on}} in 2002. Total natural gas reserves were estimated at 9,7 trillion cubic feet as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;US Energy Information Administration&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic demand for refined petroleum products is expected to increase as the economy gradually rebuilds following the end of the civil war, and the environmental impact would be positive, according to project advocates, since the gas is a byproduct of crude oil extraction that would otherwise be flared. As of 2002, Sonangol and Chevron Texaco had joined forces in a $2&amp;nbsp;billion project to develop liquefied natural gas from natural gas in Angola's off shore fields. Production was slated to begin in 2007 but Angola LNG made its first shipment in June 2013. A system failure brought a design flaw to light in 2014, and production was expected to resume in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chevron.com/~/media/chevron/projects/documents/angolafactsheet|title=Angola Fact Sheet|date=May 2015|publisher=Chevron Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environment==

===Oil spills in Angola===
Angola fined [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron Texaco]] $2m for causing environmental damage in 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2077836.stm |title=Business &amp;#124; Angola fines Chevron for pollution |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-07-01 |accessdate=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; to fisheries caused by obsolete tubes at the Cabinda oilfield. Chevron promised to spend $108 m replacing the pipes. The company pumps almost three-quarters of Angola's oil, and also reduced crude production about 12%, after a pipeline leak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/2077836.stm|date=July 1, 2002|title=Angola fines Chevron for pollution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Energy in Common''' (EIC) was a [[not-for-profit]] organization issuing [[microloans]] specifically and only for [[renewable energy]] technologies. EIC was founded by Hugh Whalan and Scott Tudman in 2009 (website launch 2010). It has the very ambitious goal of delivering renewable energy to 15 million people in the next five years, while fighting poverty by empowering developing world entrepreneurs through [[microloans]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Popova. Energy In Common: New Microfinance Venture Fights Poverty with Clean Energy. [[The Huffington Post]]. April 19, 2010. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/maria-popova/energy-in-common-new-micr_b_542278.html&lt;/ref&gt; EIC represents one of the most promising contenders in the growing green microfinance sector. As of 2012, it has ceased operations due to a lack of funds after their overseas partners defaulted on their loan obligations.    

EIC operates very similarly to [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]]. In the case of Kiva, lenders provide funds with zero return expected to [[developing world]] entrepreneurs to invest in their businesses (typical loans are for things like seeds for farming). EIC does this as well, but specifically focuses on purchasing [[renewable energy]] systems like [[solar photovoltaic panels]].

What makes EIC particularly unique in the [[microfinance]] non-profit sector is that they have created a model to measure the [[greenhouse gas emission]] reductions that are created by their loans.  The EIC model helps provide funding to developing world entrepreneurs for energy solutions and also helps to channel additional funding into mitigating climate change.

== Method of operation ==
# EIC enables individuals to lend money to poor entrepreneurs in the developing world via website using a Kiva-like model that connects individual lenders and borrowers. Upon choosing a borrower the lender can decide how much to lend - either a fraction or the entire loan requested by the borrower. The minimum loan is set at $25 for the standard microloans and $5 for their innovative '''nanoloans''' (discussed below). The total of a given range is usually found between $40 and a thousand dollars. When enough individual lenders have provided the fractional loans to a borrower and the total amount required has been reached, the loan is dispersed by the EIC. All of the EIC loans are meant to directly alleviate poverty and mitigate [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions.
# EIC has partnered with several microfinance institutions (MFI)s. The MFIs provide EIC with lists of potential borrowers, which are screened by the EIC before any individual borrower is profiled. MFIs are responsible for disbursing the loan directly to the borrower and all maintenance and support services to the borrower after the energy product is purchased.  To cover the expenses related to this responsibility, the MFIs receives all of the interest charged to the customer for the loan. For their part, the EIC helps their MFIs partners with sourcing reliable energy technologies. Currently, EIC works with four MFIs all based in Sub-Saharan Africa, but has plans to expand into other regions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nextbillion.net/blog/energy-in-common&lt;/ref&gt;
# When a loan is repaid, funds are deposited back into the lender's account and EIC calculates the individual project's GHG emission reductions. These GHG emission reductions can be used by a lender to offset their carbon emissions through a tax deductible donation to EIC. Presumably the carbon credits may also be sold to third parties. The total carbon emission offsets are determined for a project by subtracting the carbon emissions before and after the energy loan was provided.

==Appropriate technologies funded by EIC==
The following list of primarily [[renewable energy]] technologies:&lt;ref&gt;Energy Technologies. EIC. Available: http://www.energyincommon.org/about/energytechnologies.cfm visited Jan 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biodigesters===

[[Biodigesters]] convert organic wastes such as [[food waste]], [[human waste]] and [[animal waste]] into nutrient rich liquid [[fertilizer]] and [[biogas]] (thus a renewable fuel made up primarily of [[methane]]). A biodigester is made up of a bag or tank that holds the organic 'wastes' over a period in which bacteria breaks down the organic matter and produces biogas. Biogas is used as a replacement for [[kerosene]], [[firewood]], or any other combustible fuel source used in the developing world such as cow dung. Biodegesters thus produce renewable energy, cut down on odors and pathogens in organic materials, reduce surface and groundwater contamination, improve [[indoor air quality]] and provide a source of high quality [[organic fertilizer]] as a byproduct—that has been shown to improve crop yields and decrease fertilizer costs.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Clean burning stoves===

[[Clean burning stoves]] improve the fuel utilization over common stoves. There are several types but the ones funded often burn propane instead of less efficient fuels such as [[wood]], [[charcoal]], or [[Feces|dung]]. This is somewhat controversial as currently this allows for economic savings although clearly there is a potential to have negative effects of becoming dependent on a non-renewable energy source, which in many cases needs to be imported. Less controversial, is a clean burning stove that uses  wood, charcoal, or dung, but burns more efficiently. These stoves funded by EIC are designed to increase the airflow to the fuel source, creating a better flame and reducing the amount of fuel required to provide a given amount of heat to the target (e.g. it takes less fuel wood to cook dinner). Both types of clean burning stoves reduce the costs associated with fuel use and improve the [[indoor air quality]] within the homes of the users.

=== Solar powered LED lighting ===

The [[LED]] lamps combine a small solar [[photovoltaic]] panel with a [[rechargeable battery]] and an array of [[LED lights]] into an effective lighting system, which is used to replace dangerous (indoor air quality, GHG emitting, and fire hazard) [[kerosene]] lamps. LED lights are known to be very efficient, which prolongs illumination time on the charging made available by the PV.

=== Solar photovoltaic home systems ===

A typical solar photovoltaic home system funded by EIC consists of a small [[solar panel]] (both pole or roof mounted) connected to a [[charge controller]] and a small [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]. The stored solar electricity can be used both in the day and after dark to power lights and an electrical socket for other electrical equipment (e.g. cell phone charger, [[OLPC]], radio, TV, or computer).

==Carbon offsets ==
EIC creates [[carbon offsets]] from emission reductions that have occurred over the loan term and only once the loan term has finished. In this way, lenders and those that make donations to retire [[carbon credits]] can be sure that all emission reductions have already happened.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energyincommon.org/about/glossary.cfm#carbonprocess&lt;/ref&gt;
They do this by providing a detailed questionnaires before, during and after the loan, and in-depth field surveys conducted by both by EIC and independent auditing firms in order to sell the [[carbon offsets]]. The particularly clever part is that loaners may then buy the carbon credits and get a tax credit from EIC.

==Nanoloans==
In order to overcome the initial investment barrier that many people have when considering microfinance EIC developed the "Nanoloan" concept. For most microfinance institutions (e.g. [[Kiva]]) the minimum loan is $25 and the average time until repayment is about 18 months. This can put a lot of well-intentioned people off of the concept. EIC Nanoloans are a limited run of $5 loans, specifically designed to be repaid in just 60 days.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energyincommon.org/nanoloans/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; The object of offering nanoloans is to introduce new lenders to the entire microlending process fast.

== EIC impact ==
EIC has been covered extensively in the green alternative press including The Huffington Post,&lt;ref&gt;M. Popova. Energy In Common: New Microfinance Venture Fights Poverty with Clean Energy. [[The Huffington Post]]. April 19, 2010. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/maria-popova/energy-in-common-new-micr_b_542278.html&lt;/ref&gt; Mother Nature Network,&lt;ref&gt;S. Gunther. Energy In Common: It's like Kiva, but greener.'' Mother Nature Network''. April 26, 2010. Available: http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/energy/blogs/energy-in-common-its-like-kiva-but-greener&lt;/ref&gt; GreenBiz, the Next Billion&lt;ref&gt;M. Bueno. Pushing Forward Energy Microfinance: Energy in Common. ''Next Billion''.

== Change of CEO in 2011 ==
Hugh Whalan, who co-founded the organisation in 2009, left EIC in July 2011 to start a for-profit solar distribution and lending business in Ghana. Scott Tudman has been CEO since.  

==Suspension of lending activities==
Energy in Common announced on its Facebook page on September 19, 2013 that all lending activities had been suspended and that loan recovery from delinquent borrowers were underway. Subsequent replies on Facebook by lenders have gone unaddressed &lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/energyincommon/posts/575473849180769&lt;/ref&gt; and there have been other reports of concerns being reported without reply.&lt;ref&gt;http://greatnonprofits.org/org/energy-in-common-inc&lt;/ref&gt; There has been no activity on its Twitter feed since June 26, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/EnergyinCommon&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arugula''' {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|r|uː|ɡ|u|l|ə}} or '''rocket''' (''Eruca sativa''; syns. ''E. vesicaria'' subsp. ''sativa'' (Miller) Thell., ''Brassica eruca'' L.) is an edible [[annual plant]] in the family [[Brassicaceae]] used as a [[leaf vegetable]] for its fresh peppery flavor. Other common names include '''garden rocket''',&lt;ref name="fnwe" /&gt; (British, Australian, South African, Irish and New Zealand English),&lt;ref name="blamey" /&gt; and '''eruca'''.&lt;ref name="blamey" /&gt; Some additional names are "rocket salad",&lt;ref name="usda"&gt;USDA Plants Profile: [http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=ERVES ''Eruca vesicaria'' subsp. ''sativa'']&lt;/ref&gt; "rucola", "rucoli", "rugula", "[[colewort]]", and "roquette". ''Eruca sativa'', which is widely popular as a [[salad vegetable]], is a species of ''[[Eruca]]'' native to the [[Mediterranean]] region, from [[Morocco]] and [[Portugal]] in the west to [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Turkey]] in the east.&lt;ref name="mc"&gt;Med-Checklist: [http://ww2.bgbm.org/mcl/PTaxonDetail.asp?NameId=23937&amp;PTRefFk=1275 ''Eruca sativa''.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="blamey"&gt;Blamey, M. &amp; Grey-Wilson, C. (1989). ''Flora of Britain and Northern Europe''. {{ISBN|0-340-40170-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Eruca sativa'' grows {{convert|20|–|100|cm|in|0}} in height. The [[pinnation|pinnate]] leaves have four to ten small, deep, lateral [[Lobes (leaf)|lobes]] and a large terminal lobe. The [[flower]]s are {{convert|2|–|4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter, arranged in a [[corymb]] in typical Brassicaceae fashion, with creamy white [[petal]]s veined in purple, and having yellow [[stamen]]s;  the [[sepal]]s are shed soon after the flower opens. The [[fruit]] is a [[Siliqua (plant)|siliqua]] (pod) {{convert|12|–|35|mm|in|1}} long with an apical beak, and containing several [[seed]]s (which are edible). The species has a [[chromosome number]] of 2''n'' = 22.&lt;ref name="blamey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fnwe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rhs"&gt;Huxley, A., ed. (1992). ''New RHS Dictionary of Gardening''.

== Name ==
The Latin adjective ''[[sativa]]'' in the plant's [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial]] name is derived from ''satum'', the [[supine]] of the verb ''sero'', meaning "to sow", indicating that the seeds of the plant were sown in gardens. ''Eruca sativa'' differs from ''E. vesicaria'' in having early [[deciduous]] [[sepal]]s.&lt;ref name="fnwe" /&gt; Some botanists consider it a [[subspecies]] of ''[[Eruca vesicaria]]'': ''E. vesicaria'' subsp. ''sativa''.&lt;ref name="fnwe"&gt;Flora of NW Europe: [http://ip30.eti.uva.nl/BIS/flora.php?selected=beschrijving&amp;menuentry=soorten&amp;id=2395 ''Eruca vesicaria'']&lt;/ref&gt; Still others do not differentiate between the two.&lt;ref name="fe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rbg-web2.rbge.org.uk/cgi-bin/nph-readbtree.pl/feout?FAMILY_XREF=&amp;GENUS_XREF=Eruca&amp;SPECIES_XREF=&amp;TAXON_NAME_XREF=&amp;RANK=|title=Flora Europaea Search Results|work=rbge.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English [[common name]] ''rocket'' derives from the French ''roquette'', a diminutive of the Latin word ''eruca'', which once designated a particular plant in the family Brassicaceae (probably a type of [[cabbage]]).&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt; ''Arugula'' ({{IPAc-en|ə|'|r|u:|ɡ|ə|l|ə|}}), the common name now widespread in the United States and Canada, entered [[American English]] from a non-standard [[dialect]] of Italian. The standard Italian word is ''rucola'', a diminutive of the Latin "eruca". The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' dates the first appearance of "arugula" in American English to a 1960 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' by food editor and prolific cookbook writer [[Craig Claiborne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Craig |last=Claiborne |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1960/05/24/105436430.pdf |title=A Green by Any Name: Pungent Ingredient Is Cause of Confusion for City Shopper; Arugula – or Rocket – Is the Secret of Experts' Salads |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 24, 1960 |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is sometimes [[conflation|conflated]] with ''[[Diplotaxis tenuifolia]]'', known as "perennial wall rocket", another plant of the family Brassicaceae that is used in the same manner.

==Ecology==
''Eruca sativa'' typically grows on dry, disturbed ground and is also used as a food by the [[larva]]e of some [[moth]] species,&lt;ref name="blamey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fnwe" /&gt; including the [[Garden carpet|garden carpet moth]]. ''Eruca sativa'' roots are also susceptible to [[Nematode#Agriculture and horticulture|nematode]] infestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartgardener.com/plants/599-arugula-arugula/guide/pests/771-nematodes|title=Arugula: Arugula|work=smartgardener.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultivation and history==
A pungent, leafy green vegetable resembling a longer-leaved and open [[lettuce]], ''Eruca sativa'' is rich in [[vitamin C]] and [[potassium]].&lt;ref&gt;NutritionData.com, [http://www.nutritiondata.com/facts-C00001-01c20mn.html Arugula, Raw]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the leaves, the flowers, young seed pods and mature seeds are all edible.

Joseph J. Mooney in his 1916 English translation, [http://virgil.org/appendix/moretum.htm "The Salad"], calls it "colewort" and notes, "The Latin ''moretum'', which is usually translated "salad", would be better called "cheese and garlic paste", i.e., [[Pesto#History|pesto]].

Riley continues that "nowadays rocket is enjoyed innocently in [[mixed salad]]s, to which it adds a pleasing pungency".&lt;ref&gt;Gillian Riley, ''The Oxford Companion to Italian Food'' (Oxford University Press, 2008), p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rocket was traditionally collected in the wild or grown in home gardens along with such herbs as parsley and basil. It is now grown commercially in many places, and is available for purchase in supermarkets and farmers' markets throughout the world. It is also [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalised]] as a wild plant away from its native range in temperate regions around the world, including northern Europe and North America.&lt;ref name="usda" /&gt;&lt;ref name="blamey" /&gt; In India, the mature seeds are known as Gargeer. This is the same name in Arabic, جرجير (''{{transl|ar|ALA|gargīr}}''), but used in Arab countries for the fresh leaves.

Mild frost conditions hinder the plant's growth and turn the green leaves red.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Secret of the Local Red Arugula|url=http://www.princetoneats.org/the-secret-of-the-local-red-arugula|accessdate=May 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minnesota Spring |url=http://www.northlandpress.com/MNspring5713.html|accessdate=May 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
In Italy, raw rocket is often added to a pizza  at the end of or just after baking. It is also used cooked in [[Apulia]], in southern Italy, to make the pasta dish ''cavatiéddi'', "in which large amounts of coarsely chopped rocket are added to pasta seasoned with a homemade reduced tomato sauce and [[pecorino]]",&lt;ref name="Reilly, p. 446"&gt;Reilly, ''The Oxford Companion to Italian Food'', p. 446&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in "many unpretentious recipes in which it is added, chopped, to sauces and cooked dishes" or in a sauce (made by frying it in olive oil and garlic) used as a condiment for cold meats and fish.&lt;ref name="Reilly, p. 446"/&gt; In the [[Slovenian Littoral]], it is often combined with boiled potatoes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnevnik.si/tiskane_izdaje/nedeljski/1042295643|title=Solata s krompirjem  in rukolo|website=dnevnik.si}}&lt;/ref&gt; used in a soup,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zurnal24.si/recepti/krompirjeva-juha-z-rukolo-208924/clanek|title=Krompirjeva juha z rukolo|work=zurnal24}}&lt;/ref&gt; or served with the cheese [[burek]], especially in the town of [[Koper]].
It is also used with salad, tomatoes and [[mozzarella]] cheese.
In [[Rome]] rucola is used with special meat dish called ''straccietti'' that are thin slices of beef with raw rocket and Parmesan cheese.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

A sweet, peppery [[digestif|digestive alcohol]] called ''rucolino'' is made from rocket on the island of [[Ischia]] in the [[Gulf of Naples]].  This [[liqueur]] is a local specialty enjoyed in small quantities following a meal in the same way as a [[limoncello]] or [[grappa]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In Brazil and Argentina, where its use is widespread, rocket is eaten raw in salads. A popular combination is rocket mixed with [[mozzarella]] cheese (normally made out of buffalo milk) and sun-dried tomatoes.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In Cyprus, the plant is used in salads and omelettes.  An omelette with rocket (Greek ''rokka'') is common in Cypriot restaurants. {{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In the [[Gulf Countries]] the plant is used raw in the salads mixed with other vegetables or alone. In Eastern Saudi Arabia it is widely believed the plant has a lot of health benefits and recommended for newlywed couples.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In Egypt, the plant is commonly eaten raw as a side dish with many meals, with [[ful medames]] for breakfast, and regularly accompanies local seafood dishes.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In Turkey, similarly, the rocket is eaten raw as a side dish or salad with fish, but is additionally served with a sauce of extra virgin olive oil and lemon juice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Oktay Usta'dan Roka Salatası Resimli Tarifi|url = http://oktayusta.samanyoluhaber.com/oktay-ustadan-roka-salatasi-tarifi/|accessdate = 2015-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
This ''Eucalypt'' is an evergreen tree that typically grows to a height of {{convert|25|to|45|m|ft|0}} but can also be gnarled shrub when growing conditions are unfavourable.&lt;ref name=seed/&gt;&lt;ref name=waf/&gt; The tree has a straight [[Bole (botany)|bole]] with no branches present on the trunk for up to {{convert|30|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. The trunk can have a diameter of up to {{convert|2|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. The appearance of the bark is variable depending conditions but is typically persistent and subfibrous, smooth to shallow with close longitudinal fissures and red-brown to brown in colour. It will sometimes have a rougher texture mostly at the base of the trunk.&lt;ref name=waf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldagroforestry.org/treedb2/speciesprofile.php?Spid=821|title=''Eucalyptus urophylla''|accessdate=8 October 2018|publisher=WorldAgroforestryCenter|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discolourous evergreen adult leaves have a subopposite to alternate, arrangement and are a broadly [[lanceolate]] shape with a length of {{convert|10|to|15|cm|0}} and a width of {{convert|5|to|8|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=waf/&gt;
''E. urophylla'' will commence flowering after two or three years during the [[dry season]].&lt;ref name=seed/&gt;
It produces a simple axillary [[inflorescence]] called a [[conflorescence]] with a solitary umbels containing five to eight flowers that are {{convert|8|to|22|mm|in|3}} in length.&lt;ref name=waf/&gt; 
After flowering it produces a gum-nut or fruit. The fruit has the shape of a typical ''Eucalypt'' capsule. It is cup-shaped and contains three to valves with a double [[Operculum (botany)|operculum]].&lt;ref name=seed&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dfsc.dk/pdf/Seedleaflets/Eucalyptu_%20urophylla_89_int.pdf|title=''Eucalyptus urophylla'' S. T. Blake|work=Seed Leaflet|accessdate=8 October 2018|date=August 2004|publisher=Forest &amp; Landscape Denmark}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fruit contains four to six small black semicircular seeds.&lt;ref name=waf/&gt; The seeds are mature six months after flowering.&lt;ref name=seed/&gt;

The species can be quite variable with regard to bark, fruit size and shape.&lt;ref name=seed/&gt;

==Taxonomy==
The species was first described in 1977 by the botanist [[Stanley Thatcher Blake]] as part of the work ''Four new species of Eucalyptus'' as published in the [[Scientific journal|journal]] ''[[Austrobaileya]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bie.ala.org.au/species/http://id.biodiversity.org.au/name/apni/119689#names|title=''Eucalyptus urophylla'' S.T.Blake|accessdate=8 October 2018|work=Atlas of Living Australia|publisher=[[Global Biodiversity Information Facility]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Botanical nomenclature|specific epithet]] for this species is taken from the [[Greek (language)|Greek]] words  ''uro-'' meaning ''elongated appendage'' and ''phylla'' meaning ''leaves'' referring to the shape of the leaves.&lt;ref name=waf/&gt;

It has been used to produce [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] species as it appears to be insect-resistant, including a timber with a trade name of "Lyptus", hybridised with ''[[Eucalyptus grandis]]'', commonly known as the rose gum or flooded gum.&lt;ref name=fao&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/008/y5901e/Y5901E15.htm|title=Conservation status of natural populations of ''Eucalyptus urophylla''|accessdate=8 October 2018|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organisations of the United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution and ecology==
The species is native to [[Indonesia]] and has a scattered distribution in south eastern areas.&lt;ref name=waf/&gt; It has a scattered distribution and is known on seven islands in total; [[Adonara]], [[Alor Island|Alor]], [[Flores]], [[Lembata]], [[Pantar]], [[Timor]] and [[Wetar]]. It has a natural range of around {{Convert|500|km|mi|0}}.&lt;ref name=cifor/&gt; ''E. urophylla'' has an altitude range from [[sea level]] up to around {{convert|3000|m|ft|0}}. It is [[endemism|endemic]] to monsoonal areas with two to eight dry months per year. It can tolerate nutrient poor soils that are damp and well aerated.&lt;ref name=seed/&gt; Most of the soils it is found in are volcanic in origin.&lt;ref name=cifor/&gt; It often dominates in open, usually secondary [[montane forest]]s where it is found on mountain slopes and in valleys. It is often found in soils based on [[basalt]], schist and slate but rarely round [[limestone]].&lt;ref name=waf/&gt;

It has been introduced as a plantation timber to areas beyond its native range. The species was planted in [[Java]] in 1890 and [[Brazil]] in 1919, it was introduced to [[Australia]] in 1966 and more recently to [[Cameroon]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Gabon]], [[French Guiana]], [[Ivory Coast]] and [[Madagascar]] in [[Africa]] and [[Malaysia]], [[Vietnam]], southern [[China]] and [[Papua New Guinea]] in [[Asia]].&lt;ref name=cifor/&gt;

It is recognised as an invasive weed in [[Brazil]] and is known to be a minor host of ''[[Spodoptera frugiperda|fall armyworm]]''.&lt;ref name=cabi/&gt;

==Uses==
The tree is used to make a variety of products including [[charcoal]], furniture, building poles, fenceposts, wall paneling, [[fibreboard]]&lt;ref name=cabi&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/22896|title=''Eucalyptus urophylla'' (Timor mountain gum)|accessdate=9 October 2018|work=Invasive Species Compendium|publisher=[[Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; pulp and paper and fuel.&lt;ref name=cifor/&gt;
In Vietnam alone there are {{convert|200000|ha|sqmi|0}} of ''E. urophylla'' plantations. 

It can be used for reforestation purposes in its native range.&lt;ref name=cifor/&gt;

== History ==
Hobart was founded in 1897 as the '''Hobart Electric Manufacturing Company''' in [[Troy, Ohio]], by Clarence Charles Hobart (1855-1932).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vintagemachinery.org/mfgindex/detail.aspx?id=1966 |title=Hobart Manufacturing Co. - History |date=24 December 2013 |website=Vintage Machinery}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=Hobart&amp;GSiman=1&amp;GScnty=2094&amp;GRid=37336274&amp; |title=Clarence Charles Hobart |website=Find a Grave}}&lt;/ref&gt; To increase motor sales, the company attached motors to [[Coffee preparation#Grinding|coffee mill]]s and [[meat grinder]]s, creating a powered food production machine.

The company reorganized in 1913 as '''The Hobart Manufacturing Company''' and became Hobart Corporation in 1974. The former [[Kitchen Aid]] division was formed in 1919.  In 1934 Hobart bought the Dayton Scale Company (an IBM division) from IBM. [[Dart &amp; Kraft#Dart merger|Dart &amp; Kraft]] acquired Hobart in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/18/business/dart-kraft-and-hobart-in-460-million-merger.html |title=DART &amp; KRAFT AND HOBART IN $460 MILLION MERGER |date=18 Feb 1981 |first=Robert J. |last=Cole |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kitchen Aid was sold to [[Whirlpool Corp.]] in 1986&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/30/business/whirlpool-cleared-to-buy-kitchenaid.html |work=The New York Times |date=30 January 1986 |access-date=28 November 2018 |title=Whirlpool Cleared To Buy Kitchenaid}}&lt;/ref&gt; after getting an offer, for $150 million in January 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/02/business/whirlpool-amends-kitchenaid-plan.html |title=Whirlpool Amends Kitchenaid Plan |date=2 July 1985 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dart &amp; Kraft split in 1986, with Hobart becoming part of Premark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/09/business/company-news-dart-kraft-calls-spinoff-premark.html |title=Dart &amp; Kraft Calls Spinoff 'Premark'|work=The New York Times |date=9 September 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Premark was acquired by [[Illinois Tool Works]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-09-10/business/9909100202_1_itw-premark-international-illinois-tool-works |title=ITW Makes Big Leap With Premark |work=Chicago Tribune |date=10 September 1999 |first=Sallie L. |last=Gaines}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Hobart became a part of [[Illinois Tool Works]] Food Equipment Group.

The '''January 2018 North American blizzard''' was a powerful [[blizzard]] that caused severe disruption along the [[East Coast of the United States]] and [[Atlantic Canada|Canada]]. It dumped [[snow]] and [[ice]] in places that rarely receive wintry precipitation, even in the winter, such as [[Florida]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and produced snowfall accumulations of over {{convert|2|ft|cm}} in the [[Mid-Atlantic states]], [[New England]], and Atlantic Canada. The storm originated on January 3 as an area of low pressure off the coast of the Southeast. Moving swiftly to the northeast, the storm explosively deepened while moving parallel to the Eastern Seaboard, causing significant snowfall accumulations. The storm received various unofficial names, such as ''Winter Storm Grayson'', ''Blizzard of 2018'' and ''Storm Brody''. The storm was also dubbed a "historic [[bomb cyclone]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2018/01/04/historic-bomb-cyclone-unleashes-blizzard-conditions-from-coastal-virginia-to-new-england-frigid-air-to-follow/ |title=Historic ‘bomb cyclone’ unleashes blizzard conditions from coastal Virginia to New England. Frigid air to follow. |last=Samenow |first=Jason |date=January 4, 2018 |work=Washington Post |access-date=January 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 3, blizzard warnings were issued for a large swath of the coast, ranging from [[Norfolk, Virginia]] all the way up to [[Maine]]. Several states, including [[North Carolina]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Massachusetts]] declared [[state of emergency|states of emergency]] due to the powerful storm. Hundreds of flights were canceled ahead of the blizzard. Overall, 22 people were confirmed to have been killed due to the storm, and at least 300,000 residents in the [[United States]] lost power in total.

==Meteorological synopsis==
{{storm path|January 2018 Nor'easter track.png}}
Early on January 1, [[Weather Prediction Center|the Weather Prediction Center (WPC)]] began to anticipate the possibility of a northward-tracking [[low-pressure area|area of low pressure]] that would bring wintry precipitation to much of the [[East Coast of the United States]] in the first week of January,&lt;ref name="WWFD-0101-0817" /&gt; exacerbating an [[2017–18 North American cold wave|extended period of anomalously cold weather]].&lt;ref name="WWFD-0102-2145" /&gt; Due to [[numerical weather models|modeling]] confining of precipitation to relatively narrow bands at the time, initial forecasts on the storm's impacts were uncertain.&lt;ref name="WWFD-0101-0817"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Petersen|first1=Daniel|title=Probabilistic Heavy Snow and Icing Discussion 08:17Z January 1, 2018|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/hpcdiscussions.php?disc=qpfhsd&amp;version=6&amp;fmt=reg|website=Winter Weather Forecast Discussion|publisher=National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center|accessdate=January 3, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103232805/http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/hpcdiscussions.php?disc=qpfhsd&amp;version=6&amp;fmt=reg|archive-date=January 3, 2018|location=College Park, Maryland|date=January 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storm's development was forecast to originate from the eastward progression of a [[shortwave (meteorology)|shortwave trough]] originating from the northern [[Rocky Mountains]],&lt;ref name="WWFD-0101-2116"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pereira|first1=Frank|title=Probabilistic Heavy Snow and Icing Discussion 21:16Z January 1, 2018|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/hpcdiscussions.php?disc=qpfhsd&amp;version=5&amp;fmt=reg|website=Winter Weather Forecast Discussion|publisher=National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center|accessdate=January 3, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103234014/http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/hpcdiscussions.php?disc=qpfhsd&amp;version=5&amp;fmt=reg|archive-date=January 3, 2018|location=College Park, Maryland|date=January 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as the anticipated event drew closer, the system's genesis grew increasingly complex with the development of two separate disturbances in the [[jet stream]] over the upper [[Mississippi Valley]] and the eastern extent of the Rocky Mountains; these two would shape the eventual coverage of wintry precipitation associated with the storm.&lt;ref name="WWFD-0102-2145"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Musher|first1=Michael|title=Probabilistic Heavy Snow and Icing Discussion 21:45Z January 2, 2018|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/hpcdiscussions.php?disc=qpfhsd&amp;version=3&amp;fmt=reg|website=Winter Weather Forecast Discussion|publisher=National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center|accessdate=January 3, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103235726/http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/hpcdiscussions.php?disc=qpfhsd&amp;version=3&amp;fmt=reg|archive-date=January 3, 2018|location=College Park, Maryland|date=January 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the troughs pushed eastward, [[frontogenesis]] along the trough and a resulting increase in moisture allowed for [[freezing rain]] to commence over areas of northern [[Florida]] and southern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] early on January 3.&lt;ref name="MD1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jewell|first1=Ryan|title=Mesoscale Discussion 1|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/2018/md0001.html|website=Storm Prediction Center|publisher=National Weather Service|accessdate=January 4, 2018|location=Norman, Oklahoma|date=January 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day, rapid [[cyclogenesis]] led to the formation of the forecast low-pressure area north of the [[Bahamas]] and east of [[Jacksonville, Florida]],&lt;ref name="WWFD-0103-2121"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Musher|first1=Michael|title=Probabilistic Heavy Snow and Icing Discussion 21:21Z January 3, 2018|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/hpcdiscussions.php?disc=qpfhsd&amp;version=3&amp;fmt=reg|website=Winter Weather Forecast Discussion|publisher=National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center|accessdate=January 3, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180104000655/http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/hpcdiscussions.php?disc=qpfhsd&amp;version=0&amp;fmt=reg|archive-date=January 3, 2018|location=College Park, Maryland|date=January 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Waves in Jeddore Harbour 2018-01-05.jpg|thumb|left|Waves breaking in [[Jeddore, Nova Scotia|Jeddore Harbour]] during the storm on January 5.]]
New Jersey experienced as much as {{convert|17.0|in}} of snow in some places, with Islip on Long Island, NY reaching {{convert|16|in}} of snow; however, tropical storm-force winds blew the snow into banks as high as {{convert|3|ft}} in certain areas.

===New England===
Being the most geographically proximate to the storm's track, Massachusetts bore the highest impacts of all American states. Winds gusted to hurricane-force at {{convert|76|mph}} on [[Nantucket]] and over {{convert|70|mph}} on mainland Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NWS Boston storm summary PNS|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106041052/http://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=NWS&amp;issuedby=BOX&amp;product=PNS&amp;format=txt&amp;version=5&amp;glossary=0|accessdate=January 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atlantic Canada===
After ravaging New England, the storm moved on to [[Atlantic Canada]] on January 4 and 5. Heavy snow fell in New Brunswick, peaking at {{convert|60|cm}} in [[Bathurst, New Brunswick|Bathurst]]. [[Sydney, Nova Scotia|Sydney]] reported snowfall rates of up to 8&amp;nbsp;cm per hour, in heavy bands of [[thundersnow]]. While snowfall amounts closer to the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia were very low, winds gusting up to {{convert|203|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} were reported in [[Saint-Joseph-du-Moine, Nova Scotia|Saint-Joseph-du-Moine]], causing widespread power outages. At the peak of the storm, nearly 130,000 [[Nova Scotia Power]] customers were left without power, while in [[New Brunswick]], around 19,000 [[NB Power]] customers were left without power. Offshore waves reached heights of {{convert|16|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/winter-storm-wind-rain-snow-storm-surge-blizzard-east-atlantic-canada-maritimes-newfoundland-nova-scotia-pei/92924/|title=Hurricane force winds, 50+ cm of snow slams the Maritimes|first=Pelmorex Weather Networks|last=Inc.|website=The Weather Network|accessdate=January 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bermuda===
On 5 January 2018, the storm was also responsible for a persistent thunderstorm that brought {{convert|1.84|in}} of rain and gale force winds to the island of [[Bermuda]].  However, due to the island’s latitude, no sub-zero temperatures were felt.  There were wind gusts of up to {{convert|52|mph|km/h kn}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Owain Johnston-Barnes |url=http://mobile.royalgazette.com/news/article/20180105/storm-grayson-blamed-for-poor-weather&amp;template=mobileart |title=Storm Grayson blamed for poor weather &amp;#124; The Royal Gazette:Bermuda News - Mobile |publisher=Mobile.royalgazette.com |date=2018-01-05 |accessdate=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cruise ships===
On 4 January 2018, both the ''[[Norwegian Breakaway]]'' and the ''[[Norwegian Gem]]'' traveled through the storm causing major flooding in passenger staterooms. The ''Breakaway'', with 4,000 passengers, was sailing from [[the Bahamas]] back to [[New York City]] when it sustained flooding throughout the passenger cabins as well as elevators and the hallways. Some rooms were so badly flooded that some passengers slept in the public spaces. Footage of the ordeal showed the sides of the ship being hit by waves as high as {{convert|30|ft}}. At some points in the trip, the ship tilted so much that some passengers fell out of their beds. There was widespread damage to the interior as glasses fell out of shelves and some furniture toppled over. Paintings in the art gallery could be seen falling off the walls as the ship tilted to the shape of the waves. Seasickness was widespread as guests could be seen vomiting. While the Norwegian Cruise Line did formally apologize, some guests were traumatized to the point of refusing to cruise again. The incident has sparked outrage, with some customers threatening a class action lawsuit. The ship’s late arrival cut the following 14-day cruise short by one day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/norwegian-cruise-line-breakaway-passengers-bomb-cyclone-winter-storm-2018/?setDevice=amp |title="It was hell for me": Woman recalls cruise ship ride during "bomb cyclone" |publisher=CBS News |date= |accessdate=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2018/01/05/cruise-through-storm/ |title=Norwegian Cruise Sailed Through Thick Of Winter Storm « CBS New York |publisher=Newyork.cbslocal.com |date=2018-01-05 |accessdate=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/travel/2018/01/07/norwegian-cruise-line-passengers-on-ship-that-sailed-through-bomb-cyclone-describe-nightmare-ride.html |title=Norwegian Cruise Line passengers on ship that sailed through 'bomb cyclone' describe 'nightmare' ride |publisher=Fox News |date=2018-01-06 |accessdate=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kakrapar Atomic Power Station''' is a [[nuclear power]] station in [[India]], which lies in the proximity of the city of [[Vyara]] in the state of [[Gujarat]]. It consists of two 220&amp;nbsp;MW [[pressurised water reactor]] with [[heavy water]] as moderator (PHWR).  KAPS-1 went critical on 3&amp;nbsp;September 1992 and began commercial electricity production a few months later on 6&amp;nbsp;May 1993. KAPS-2 went critical on 8&amp;nbsp;January 1995 and began commercial production on 1 September 1995. In January 2003, [[CANDU Owners Group]] (COG) declared KAPS as the best performing pressurised heavy water reactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurian|first=Vinson|title=Indian N-reactors set new global benchmark|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/2003/03/27/stories/2003032702500400.htm|newspaper= [[The Hindu Business Line]]|date=26 March 2003|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction costs originally were estimated to be ₹ 382.52&amp;nbsp;crore, the plant was finally finished at a price of ₹ 1,335&amp;nbsp;crore. Construction of units 3 &amp; 4 started in November 2010.&lt;ref name="wnn-2211107"/&gt;

== Incidents ==
* 1998 KAPS-1 was switched off because of a leakage in the cooling loop for 66 days.
* 10 March 2004 the (at the time of) supply for the control rods were irreparably damaged during maintenance work. In response, poisons were added to the system and the reactor was shut off.
* On 22 August 2006 it was reported by village inhabitants the area around the power station had been penetrated. A search by the police did not result in any findings.
* On 11 March 2016, KAPS-1 automatically shut down due to a leak of heavy coolant water, leaving both reactors non-operational.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.aerb.gov.in/AERBPortal/pages/English/prsrel/p11032016.pdf |format= [[PDF]] |website= [[Atomic Energy Regulatory Board|aerb.gov.in]] |title= Shutdown of Unit-1 of KAPS Nuclear Power Plant following an incident leakage from Coolant System |first= S. |last= Harikumar |date= 2016-03-11 |accessdate= 2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/report/more-than-100-hours-later-kakrapar-nuclear-leak-not-fixed/20160316.htm|title=More than 100 hours later, Kakrapar nuclear leak not fixed|last=|first=|date=16 March 2016|work=|access-date=18 April 2016|via=Rediff.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leak was plugged ten days later. {{Asof|March 2017}} both reactors are still shut down and expected to remain so for at least another year.&lt;ref name=timesofindia&gt;{{cite news|url= https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/ahmedabad-no-power-from-kakrapar-plant-for-at-least-a-year/articleshow/57585243.cms |title= Ahmedabad: No power from Kakrapar plant for at least a year |website= [[The Times of India|timesofindia.indiatimes.com]] |date= 2017-03-11 |accessdate= 2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Macassar oil''' is a compounded [[Vegetable fats and oils|oil]] used primarily by Western European men throughout the 1800s and early 1900s as a [[hair conditioner]] to groom and style the hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.detailsformen.com/Articles_Detail.aspx?PCID=35 |title=Men's Hair Care Lesson: How Conditioner Works |publisher=Detailsformen.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141006095312/https://www.detailsformen.com/Articles_Detail.aspx?PCID=35 |archivedate=2014-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was popularised by Alexander Rowland (1747-1823), a celebrated London barber. It was then not uncommon for barbers to make their own hair preparations, and around 1783 Rowland began offering Rowland's Macassar Oil. Within two decades it had become hugely popular, and was aggressively advertised with extravagant claims of its effectiveness, becoming one of the first nationally advertised products.

The words ''Macassar Oil'' were registered as a trademark by A. Rowland &amp; Sons, in 1888. Rowland's son (also named Alexander) later stated that a relative living in the island of [[Celebes]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]] had helped in procurement of the basic ingredient.

Macassar oil is often made with [[coconut oil]] or [[palm oil]] or that of ''[[Schleichera oleosa]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghosh |first1=P |last2=Chakraborty |first2=P |last3=Mandal |first3=A |last4=Rasul |first4=M G |last5=Chakraborty |first5=Madhumita |last6=Saha |first6=A |title=Triterpenoids from ''Schleichera oleosa'' of Darjeeling Foothills and Their Antimicrobial Activity |journal=Indian Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences |date=Mar–Apr 2011 |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=231–233 |pmc=3267311 |pmid=22303070 |doi=10.4103/0250-474x.91568}}&lt;/ref&gt;  combined with [[ylang-ylang]] oil (obtained by processing the flowers of the ylang-ylang tree, ''Cananga odorata'') and other fragrant oils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essentialoils.co.za/essential-oils/ylang-ylang.htm |title=Ylang-ylang essential oil information |publisher=Essentialoils.co.za |date=2014-05-29 |accessdate=2014-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macassar oil was so named because it was reputed to have been manufactured from ingredients purchased in the port of [[Makassar]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/abc3/myplace/narrowband/1798/oil.htm |title=Macassar Oil |publisher=Abc.net.au |date= |accessdate=2014-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[George Gordon, Lord Byron|Byron]] facetiously called it "thine incomparable oil, Macassar" in the first canto of ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'', and [[Lewis Carroll]] also mentions "Rowland's Macassar Oil" in the poem "[[Haddocks' Eyes]]" from ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''.
[[File:An obese bald-headed old man seated in an armchair while a s Wellcome V0019909.jpg|thumb|Illustration by [[Thomas Rowlandson]] from around 1814 making fun of the false claim in some advertisements that Macassar oil would stimulate hair growth on balding men. ]]
Due to the tendency for the oil to transfer from the user's hair to the back of his chair, the [[antimacassar]] was developed. This is a small cloth ([[crochet]]ed, embroidered or mass-produced), placed over the back of a chair to protect the upholstery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Dickens]], ''[[Sketches by Boz]]'' 1836: Tales: Ch 4, The Tuggses at Ramsgate&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8024">[[File:Marine-loading-arm.jpg|thumb|right|One of three marine loading arms connects this [[oil tanker]] to the pier.|239x239px]]
[[File:JLA Marine Loading Arms.jpg|thumb|One of two marine loading arms connected to an [[oil tanker]] by Dutch company [http://www.jla-loadingarms.com/ JLA Loading Technology].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jla-loadingarms.com/|title=Marine Loading Arms|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;|340x340px]]
A '''marine loading arm''', also known as a '''mechanical loading arm''', '''loading arm''', or '''MLA''' is a [[mechanical arm]] consisting of articulated steel pipes that connect a [[tankship]] such as an [[oil tanker]] or [[chemical tanker]] to a cargo terminal.  [[Genericized trademark]]s such as '''Chiksan''' (often misspelled '''Chicksan''') are often used to refer to marine loading arms.&lt;ref name="h83"&gt;Huber, 2001, p.83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hkg7"&gt;Hayler and Keever, 2001, p. G-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation and design==
A marine [[loading arm]] is an alternative to direct hose hookups that is particularly useful for larger vessels and transfers at higher loading rates and pressures.&lt;ref name="h83"/&gt;  Controlled manually or hydraulically, a loading arm employs swivel joints and can, to some extent, follow the movement of a moored vessel.&lt;ref name="h83"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hk1410"&gt;Hayler and Keever, 2001, p. 14-10 to 14-11.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many loading arm systems feature quick-connect fittings.&lt;ref name="h83"/&gt;  [[Gasket]] or [[o-ring]] arrangements are required to make a  secure seal to the ship's manifold flange.&lt;ref name="h83"/&gt;  A loading arm must be drained or closed off before the connection is broken off.&lt;ref name="h84"&gt;Huber, 2001, p.84.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is usually done in two ways. For fuels such as gas oil and diesel, the lines can be blown out with high pressure air. In the case of fuels such as kerosene or petrol, the lines can be stripped with pumps.

Loading arms can handle both liquids and gases, in a wide range of viscosities and temperatures.&lt;ref name="fmcchik"/&gt;  Cargoes from [[liquid sulphur]] to [[liquefied natural gas]] are moved through marine loading arms.&lt;ref name="fmcchik"/&gt;  Loading arms service vessels in a wide range of sizes, from small [[river barges]] to the largest [[supertanker]]s.&lt;ref name="fmcchik"/&gt;

Various designs exist, and specific installations can be tailored for a given port based on considerations such as vessel size, cargo flow rate and cargo temperature.&lt;ref name="fmcchik"/&gt;  Environmental constraints, such as the range of tide, wind conditions, and earthquake tolerance, can also affect choice of loading arm.&lt;ref name="fmcchik"&gt;FMC Technologies, 2005, ''Chiksan Marine Loading Arms''.&lt;/ref&gt;  A loading arm installation may include add-ons such as hydraulic or manual quick connect couplers, position monitoring systems, emergency release systems, and piggyback vapor return lines.&lt;ref name="fmcchik"/&gt;

Compared to cargo hoses, the loading arm's main drawback is its comparative lack of flexibility.&lt;ref name="h83"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Chassiron main deck.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Chemical tanker|chemical]] or [[oil tanker]] connected to the pier with a marine loading arm.]]Since the earliest days of tankships, the need to safely and efficiently transfer bulk liquid to a moored ship has been fundamental.  An insufficient solution to this problem led to one of the world's first oil tanker disasters.&lt;ref name="to55"&gt;Tolf, 1976, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1881, the [[Branobel]] tanker ''Nordenskjöld'' was taking on [[kerosene]] in [[Baku]].&lt;ref name="to55"/&gt;  The ship was connected to the pier with a simple piece of pipe.&lt;ref name="to55"/&gt;  While loading, the ship was hit by a gust of wind and the cargo pipe carrying was jerked away from the hold.&lt;ref name="to55"/&gt;  Kerosene then spilled onto the deck and down into the engine room, where mechanics were working in the light of kerosene lanterns.&lt;ref name="to55"/&gt;  The ship then exploded, killing half the crew.&lt;ref name="to55"/&gt;  [[Ludvig Nobel]] responded to the disaster by creating a flexible, leakproof loading pipe which was much more resistant to spills.&lt;ref name="to56"&gt;Tolf, 1976, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiksan brand marine loading arm manufacturer [[FMC Technologies]] claims to have built the world's first all-steel marine loading arm in 1956 and to have over 8,000 units installed worldwide.&lt;ref name="fmcabout"&gt;FMC Technologies, 2005, ''About Us''.&lt;/ref&gt;

It may provide or confirm basic enthalpy data that have always been needed for the calculation of [[phase diagram]]s of metals, and that are now currently approached by [[CALPHAD]]. The method has been introduced by Miedema in a couple of papers appeared in 1973 in Philips Technical Review Magazine entitled "A simple model for alloys".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miedema|first=A.R.|year=1973|title=A simple model for alloys.

There is the qualitative rule that states that the greater the difference in the electronegativity of two metals, the greater the heat of formation - and hence the stability. Then there is the [[Hume-Rothery rules|Hume-Rothery rule]], which states that two metals that differ by more than 15% in their atomic radius will not form substitutional solid solutions. This rule can only be used reliably (90 % success) to predict poor solubility; it cannot predict good solubility. The author has proposed a simple atomic model, which is empirical like the other two rules, but nevertheless has a clear physical basis and predicts the alloying behaviour of transition metals accurately in 98 % of cases. The model is very suitable for graphical presentation of the data and is therefore easy to use in practice."

==Implication of Miedema's model on an informatics guided classification of miscible and immiscible binary alloy systems==


A recent open journal work &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang |first=R.F.|year=2017|title=An informatics guided classification of miscible and immiscible binary alloy systems |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-09704-1.pdf |journal=Scientific Reports Volume 77, Issue 1, 1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizes the capabilities of Miedema's approach in the classification of miscible and immiscible systems of binary alloys. These are extremely relevant in the design of multicomponent alloys. The paper by mining data from hundreds of experimental phase diagrams, and thousands of thermodynamic data sets from experiments and high-throughput first-principles (HTFP) calculations,  obtains a comprehensive classification of alloying behavior for 813 binary alloy systems consisting of transition and lanthanide metals. "Impressively, the classification by the miscibility map yields a robust
validation on the capability of the well-known Miedema’s theory (95% agreement) and shows good agreement with the HTFP method (90% agreement). These  2017 results demonstrate that "a state-of-the art physics-guided data mining can provide an efficient pathway for knowledge discovery in the next generation of materials design".

However, in [[quantum physics]], [[organic chemistry]], and [[biochemistry]], the term ''molecule'' is often used less strictly, also being applied to [[polyatomic ion]]s.

In the [[kinetic theory of gases]], the term ''molecule'' is often used for any gaseous [[particle]] regardless of its composition. According to this definition, [[noble gas]] atoms are considered molecules as they are monatomic molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Chandra| first= Sulekh| title= Comprehensive Inorganic Chemistry| date= 2005| publisher= New Age Publishers| isbn= 81-224-1512-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A molecule may be [[homonuclear]], that is, it consists of atoms of one [[chemical element]], as with [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;); or it may be [[heteronuclear]], a [[chemical compound]] composed of more than one element, as with [[water (molecule)|water]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). Atoms and complexes connected by [[non-covalent interactions]], such as [[hydrogen bond]]s or [[ionic bond]]s, are generally not considered single molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title= Molecule|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|date =22 January 2016|url=http://global.britannica.com/science/molecule|access-date=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molecules as components of matter are common in organic substances (and therefore biochemistry). They also make up most of the oceans and atmosphere. However, the majority of familiar solid substances on Earth, including most of the minerals that make up the [[Crust (geology)|crust]], [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], and [[Earth core|core of the Earth]], contain many chemical bonds, but are ''not'' made of identifiable molecules. Also, no typical molecule can be defined for [[ionic crystal]]s ([[salt (chemistry)|salts]]) and covalent crystals ([[network solid]]s), although these are often composed of repeating [[unit cell]]s that extend either in a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] (such as in [[graphene]]) or three-dimensionally (such as in [[diamond]], [[quartz]], or [[sodium chloride]]). The theme of repeated unit-cellular-structure also holds for most condensed phases with [[metallic bond]]ing, which means that solid metals are also not made of molecules. In [[glass]]es (solids that exist in a vitreous disordered state), atoms may also be held together by chemical bonds with no presence of any definable molecule, nor any of the regularity of repeating units that characterizes crystals.

== Molecular science ==

The science of molecules is called ''molecular chemistry'' or ''[[molecular physics]]'', depending on whether the focus is on chemistry or physics. Molecular chemistry deals with the laws governing the interaction between molecules that results in the formation and breakage of [[chemical bond]]s, while molecular physics deals with the laws governing their structure and properties. In practice, however, this distinction is vague. In molecular sciences, a molecule consists of a stable system ([[bound state]]) composed of two or more [[atom]]s. [[Polyatomic ion]]s may sometimes be usefully thought of as electrically charged molecules. The term ''unstable molecule'' is used for very [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]] species, i.e., short-lived assemblies ([[Resonance (chemistry)|resonances]]) of electrons and [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], such as [[radical (chemistry)|radicals]], molecular [[ion]]s, [[Rydberg molecule]]s, [[transition state]]s, [[van der Waals bonding|van der Waals complexes]], or systems of colliding atoms as in [[Bose–Einstein condensate]].

== History and etymology ==
{{Main|History of molecular theory}}

According to [[Merriam-Webster]] and the [[Online Etymology Dictionary]], the word "molecule" derives from the [[Latin]] "[[Mole (unit)|moles]]" or small unit of mass.
* '''Molecule''' (1794)&amp;nbsp;– "extremely minute particle", from French ''{{linktext|molécule}}'' (1678), from [[New Latin]] ''{{linktext|molecula}}'', diminutive of Latin ''{{linktext|moles}}'' "mass, barrier". A vague meaning at first; the vogue for the word (used until the late 18th century only in Latin form) can be traced to the philosophy of [[René Descartes|Descartes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|molecule|accessdate=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=molecule|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/molecule|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of the molecule has evolved as knowledge of the structure of molecules has increased. Earlier definitions were less precise, defining molecules as the smallest [[list of particles#Molecules|particles]] of pure [[chemical substance]]s that still retain their [[chemical compound|composition]] and chemical properties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/glossary/m.shtml#molecule Molecule Definition] ([[Frostburg State University]])&lt;/ref&gt; This definition often breaks down since many substances in ordinary experience, such as [[rock (geology)|rocks]], [[salt (chemistry)|salts]], and [[metal]]s, are composed of large crystalline networks of [[chemical bond|chemically bonded]] atoms or [[ion]]s, but are not made of discrete molecules.
{{clear}}

== Bonding ==

Molecules are held together by either [[covalent bonding]] or [[ionic bonding]]. Several types of non-metal elements exist only as molecules in the environment. For example, hydrogen only exists as hydrogen molecule. A molecule of a compound is made out of two or more elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hutchinson unabridged encyclopedia with atlas and weather guide|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/hutchinson-unabridged-encyclopedia-with-atlas-and-weather-guide/oclc/696918830|website=worldcat.org|publisher=Oxford, England|accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Covalent ===
{{main|Covalent bonding}}
[[File:Covalent bond hydrogen.svg|thumb|right|A covalent bond forming H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (right) where two [[hydrogen atom]]s share the two electrons]]
A covalent bond is a [[chemical bond]] that involves the sharing of [[electron pair]]s between [[atom]]s. These electron pairs are termed ''shared pairs'' or ''bonding pairs'', and the stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms, when they share electrons, is termed ''covalent bonding''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author2= Brad Williamson; Robin J. Heyden| last= Campbell| first= Neil A.| title= Biology: Exploring Life| url= http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html| accessdate= 2012-02-05| year= 2006| publisher= [[Pearson Prentice Hall]]| location= Boston, Massachusetts| isbn= 0-13-250882-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ionic ===
{{main|Ionic bonding}} [[File:NaF.gif|thumb|left|[[Sodium]] and [[fluorine]] undergoing a redox reaction to form [[sodium fluoride]]. Sodium loses its outer [[electron]]  to give it a stable [[electron configuration]], and this electron enters the fluorine atom [[exothermic]]ally.]]

Ionic bonding is a type of [[chemical bond]] that involves the [[electrostatic]] attraction between oppositely charged [[ion]]s, and is the primary interaction occurring in [[ionic compound]]s. The ions are atoms that have lost one or more [[electron]]s (termed [[cation]]s) and atoms that have gained one or more electrons (termed [[anion]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6VdROgeQ5M8C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=ionic+bonding+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi34bOG_6nTAhVnl1QKHRLZBeoQ6AEILTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=ionic%20bonding%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false|title=Elements of Metallurgy and Engineering Alloys|last=Campbell|first=Flake C.|date=2008-01-01|publisher=[[ASM International]]|isbn=9781615030583|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This transfer of electrons is termed ''electrovalence'' in contrast to [[covalent bond|covalence]]. In the simplest case, the cation is a [[metal]] atom and the anion is a [[nonmetal]] atom, but these ions can be of a more complicated nature, e.g. molecular ions like NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. Basically, an ionic bond is the transfer of electrons from a metal to a non-metal for both atoms to obtain a full valence shell.

== Molecular size ==

Most molecules are far too small to be seen with the naked eye, but there are exceptions. [[DNA]], a [[macromolecule]], can reach [[macroscopic]] sizes, as can molecules of many [[polymer]]s. Molecules commonly used as building blocks for organic synthesis have a dimension of a few [[angstrom]]s (Å) to several dozen Å, or around one billionth of a meter. Single molecules cannot usually be observed by [[light]] (as noted above), but small molecules and even the outlines of individual atoms may be traced in some circumstances by use of an [[atomic force microscope]]. Some of the largest molecules are [[macromolecule]]s or [[supermolecule]]s.

The smallest molecule is the [[diatomic]] [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), with a bond length of 0.74 Å.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Roger L. DeKock |author2=Harry B.

== Molecular formulas ==

=== Chemical formula types ===
{{Main|Chemical formula}}

The [[chemical formula]] for a molecule uses one line of [[chemical element]] symbols, numbers, and sometimes also other symbols, such as parentheses, dashes, brackets, and ''plus'' (+) and ''minus'' (−) signs. These are limited to one typographic line of symbols, which may include subscripts and superscripts.

A compound's [[empirical formula]] is a very simple type of chemical formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6wUmteTIc18C&amp;pg=PA288&amp;dq=empirical+formula&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiv64bBh6rTAhUSwmMKHb3vB0IQ6AEIOjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=empirical%20formula&amp;f=false|title=The Practice of Chemistry|last=Wink|first=Donald J.|last2=Fetzer-Gislason|first2=Sharon|last3=McNicholas|first3=Sheila|date=2003-03-01|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780716748717|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the simplest [[integer]] [[ratio]] of the [[chemical element]]s that constitute it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chemteam.info/Mole/EmpiricalFormula.html|title=ChemTeam: Empirical Formula|website=www.chemteam.info|access-date=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, water is always composed of a 2:1 ratio of [[hydrogen]] to [[oxygen]] atoms, and ethyl [[alcohol]] or [[ethanol]] is always composed of [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], and [[oxygen]] in a 2:6:1 ratio. However, this does not determine the kind of molecule uniquely&amp;nbsp;– [[dimethyl ether]] has the same ratios as ethanol, for instance. Molecules with the same [[atom]]s in different arrangements are called [[isomer]]s. Also carbohydrates, for example, have the same ratio (carbon:hydrogen:oxygen= 1:2:1) (and thus the same empirical formula) but different total numbers of atoms in the molecule.

The [[molecular formula]] reflects the exact number of atoms that compose the molecule and so characterizes different molecules. However different isomers can have the same atomic composition while being different molecules.

The empirical formula is often the same as the molecular formula but not always. For example, the molecule [[acetylene]] has molecular formula C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but the simplest integer ratio of elements is CH.

The [[molecular mass]] can be calculated from the [[chemical formula]] and is expressed in conventional [[atomic mass unit]]s equal to 1/12 of the mass of a neutral carbon-12 (&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;[[carbon|C]] [[isotope]]) atom. For [[network solid]]s, the term [[formula unit]] is used in [[stoichiometric]] calculations.

[[File:Atisane3.png|thumb|right|upright=1.8|[[Three-dimensional space|3D]] (left and center) and [[2D geometric model|2D]] (right) representations of the [[terpenoid]] molecule atisane]]

For molecules with a complicated 3-dimensional structure, especially involving atoms bonded to four different substituents, a simple molecular formula or even semi-structural [[chemical formula]] may not be enough to completely specify the molecule. In this case, a graphical type of formula called a [[structural formula]] may be needed. Structural formulas may in turn be represented with a one-dimensional chemical name, but such [[chemical nomenclature]] requires many words and terms which are not part of chemical formulas.

Molecules have fixed [[mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] geometries—bond lengths and angles— about which they continuously oscillate through vibrational and rotational motions. A pure substance is composed of molecules with the same average geometrical structure. The chemical formula and the structure of a molecule are the two important factors that determine its properties, particularly its [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]]. [[Isomers]] share a chemical formula but normally have very different properties because of their different structures. [[Stereoisomer]]s, a particular type of isomer, may have very similar physico-chemical properties and at the same time different [[biochemistry|biochemical]] activities.

[[File:Dehydrogenation of H2TPP by STM.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Hydrogen can be removed from individual [[Tetraphenylporphyrin|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TPP]] molecules by applying excess voltage to the tip of a [[scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM, a); this removal alters the current-voltage (I-V) curves of TPP molecules, measured using the same STM tip, from [[diode]] like (red curve in b) to [[resistor]] like (green curve). Image (c) shows a row of TPP, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TPP and TPP molecules. While scanning image (d), excess voltage was applied to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TPP at the black dot, which instantly removed hydrogen, as shown in the bottom part of (d) and in the rescan image (e). Such manipulations can be used in [[single-molecule electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/srep08350|pmid=25666850|pmc=4322354|title=N and p type character of single molecule diodes|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=5|page=8350|year=2015|bibcode= 2015NatSR...5E8350Z|author1=Zoldan|first1=V. C.|last2=Faccio|first2=R|last3=Pasa|first3=A. A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Molecular spectroscopy''' deals with the response ([[frequency spectrum|spectrum]]) of molecules interacting with probing signals of known [[energy]] (or [[frequency]], according to [[Planck's constant|Planck's formula]]). Molecules have quantized energy levels that can be analyzed by detecting the molecule's energy exchange through [[absorbance]] or [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]].&lt;ref name="iupac2"&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Spectroscopy|file=S05848|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Spectroscopy does not generally refer to [[diffraction]] studies where particles such as [[neutron]]s, [[electron]]s, or high energy [[X-ray]]s interact with a regular arrangement of molecules (as in a crystal).

[[Microwave spectroscopy]] commonly measures changes in the rotation of molecules, and can be used to identify molecules in outer space. [[Infrared spectroscopy]] measures changes in vibration of molecules, including stretching, bending or twisting motions. It is commonly used to identify the kinds of bonds or [[functional group]]s in molecules. Changes in the arrangements of electrons yield absorption or emission lines in ultraviolet, visible or [[near infrared]] light, and result in colour. Nuclear resonance spectroscopy actually measures the environment of particular nuclei in the molecule, and can be used to characterise the numbers of atoms in different positions in a molecule.

== Theoretical aspects ==

The study of molecules by [[molecular physics]] and [[theoretical chemistry]] is largely based on [[quantum mechanic]]s and is essential for the understanding of the [[chemical bond]]. The simplest of molecules is the [[hydrogen molecule-ion]], H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and the simplest of all the chemical bonds is the [[one-electron bond]]. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is composed of two positively charged [[proton]]s and one negatively charged [[electron]], which means that the [[Schrödinger equation]] for the system can be solved more easily due to the lack of electron–electron repulsion. With the development of fast digital computers, approximate solutions for more complicated molecules became possible and are one of the main aspects of [[computational chemistry]].

When trying to define rigorously whether an arrangement of atoms is ''sufficiently stable'' to be considered a molecule, IUPAC suggests that it "must correspond to a depression on the [[potential energy surface]] that is deep enough to confine at least one vibrational state".&lt;ref name="iupac" /&gt; This definition does not depend on the nature of the interaction between the atoms, but only on the strength of the interaction. In fact, it includes weakly bound species that would not traditionally be considered molecules, such as the [[helium]] [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]], [[helium dimer|He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], which has one vibrational [[bound state]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anderson JB |title=Comment on "An exact quantum Monte Carlo calculation of the helium-helium intermolecular potential" [J.

Whether or not an arrangement of atoms is ''sufficiently stable'' to be considered a molecule is inherently an operational definition. Philosophically, therefore, a molecule is not a fundamental entity (in contrast, for instance, to an [[elementary particle]]); rather, the concept of a molecule is the chemist's way of making a useful statement about the strengths of atomic-scale interactions in the world that we observe.

[[File:Incline.svg|right|thumb|''F&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'' represents the '''normal force''']]
 
In [[mechanics]], the '''[[normal (geometry)|normal]] force''' &lt;math&gt; F_n\ &lt;/math&gt; is the component of a [[contact force]] that is perpendicular to the surface that an object contacts. For example, the surface of a floor or table that prevents an object from falling. In this instance ''normal'' is used in the [[geometry|geometric]] sense and means [[perpendicular]], as opposed the common language use of ''normal'' meaning common or expected. For example, a person standing still on flat ground is supported by a [[ground reaction force]] that consists of only a normal force. If the person stands on a slope and does not slide down it, then the total ground reaction force can be divided into two components: a normal force perpendicular to the ground and a frictional force parallel to the ground. In another common situation, if an object hits a surface with some speed, and the surface can withstand it, the normal force provides for a rapid deceleration, which will depend on the flexibility of the surface and the object.

==Equations==
[[File:Friction relative to normal force (diagram).png|thumb|widthpx|Weight (''W''), the frictional force (''F''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;), and the normal force (''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) acting on a block. Weight is the product of mass (''m'') and the acceleration of gravity (''g'').]]

In a simple case such as an object resting upon a table, the normal force on the object is equal but in opposite direction to the gravitational force applied on the object (or the [[weight]] of the object), that is, &lt;math&gt;N = mg&lt;/math&gt;, where ''m'' is mass, and ''g'' is the [[standard gravity|gravitational field strength]] (about 9.81 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on Earth). The normal force here represents the force applied by the table against the object that prevents it from sinking through the table and requires that the table is sturdy enough to deliver this normal force without breaking.  However, it is easy to assume that the normal force and weight are action-reaction force pairs (a common mistake).  In this case, the normal force and weight need to be equal in magnitude to explain why there is no upward acceleration of the object.  For example, a ball that bounces upwards accelerates upwards because the normal force acting on the ball is larger in magnitude than the weight of the ball. 

Where an object rests on an incline, the normal force is perpendicular to the plane the object rests on.  Still, the normal force will be as large as necessary to prevent sinking through the surface, presuming the surface is sturdy enough.  The strength of the force can be calculated as: 

:&lt;math&gt;N = mg \cos(\theta) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the normal force, ''m'' is the mass of the object, ''g'' is the gravitational field strength, and ''θ'' is the angle of the inclined surface measured from the horizontal. 

The normal force is one of the several forces which act on the object. In the simple situations so far considered, the most important other forces acting on it are [[friction]] and the force of [[gravity]].

===Using vectors===
In general, the magnitude of the normal force, ''N'', is the projection of the net surface interaction force, ''T'',  in the normal direction, ''n'', and so the normal force [[Euclidean vector|vector]] can be found by scaling the normal direction by the net surface interaction force. The surface interaction force, in turn, is equal to the dot product of the unit normal with the [[Cauchy stress tensor]] describing the stress state of the surface. That is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N}=\mathbf{n}\, N = \mathbf{n}\, (\mathbf{T}\cdot \mathbf{n}) = \mathbf{n}\, (\mathbf{n}\cdot \mathbf{\tau} \cdot \mathbf{n}).&lt;/math&gt;
:or, in [[indicial notation]],
:&lt;math&gt;\ N_i = n_i N = n_i T_j n_j = n_i n_k \tau_{jk} n_j.&lt;/math&gt;

The parallel shear component of the contact force is known as the [[friction|frictional force]] (&lt;math&gt; F_fr\ &lt;/math&gt;).

The static [[coefficient of friction]] for an object on an inclined plane can be calculated as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

: &lt;math&gt;\mu_s=\tan(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

for an object on the point of sliding where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the slope and the horizontal.

==Physical origin==

As explained before, the normal force is a contact force, that is, the resultant of the forces between the [[Molecule|constituents]] of the actual constraint, and the constituents of the object. When the object and the constraint (a wall, a table, another object, or any surface) are pressed against each other, the [[van der Waals force]], a force that grows very large very quickly, opposes this and for this reason, the two objects cannot penetrate each other. If the two objects are then separated, even by a very small distance, the normal force disappears. This is because the [[intermolecular force]] quickly vanishes past the point of equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bettini|first1=Alessandro|title=A Course in Classical Physics 1 - Mechanics|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-29256-4|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications in real life==
In an elevator either stationary or moving at constant velocity, the normal force on the person's feet balances the person's weight. In an elevator that is accelerating upward, the normal force is greater than the person's ground weight and so the person's perceived weight increases (making the person feel heavier). In an elevator that is accelerating downward, the normal force is less than the person's ground weight and so a passenger's perceived weight decreases. If a passenger were to stand on a weighing scale, such as a conventional bathroom scale, while riding the elevator, the scale will be reading the normal force it delivers to the passenger's feet, and will be different than the person's ground weight if the elevator cab is ''accelerating'' up or down.  The weighing scale measures normal force (which varies as the elevator cab accelerates), not gravitational force (which does not vary as the cab accelerates).

When we define upward to be the positive direction, constructing [[Newton's second law]] and solving for the normal force on a passenger yields the following equation:
:&lt;math&gt;N = m(g + a)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Oleic acid''' is a [[fatty acid]] that occurs naturally in various [[animal fat|animal]] and [[vegetable oil|vegetable fats and oils]]. It is an odorless, colorless oil, although commercial samples may be yellowish.  In chemical terms, oleic acid is classified as a [[monounsaturated fat|monounsaturated]] [[omega-9 fatty acid|omega-9]] [[fatty acid]], abbreviated with a [[lipid number]] of 18:1 [[cis–trans isomerism|''cis'']]-9.  It has the formula CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;CH=CH(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;COOH.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; The name derives from the Latin word ''oleum'', which means oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=An Etymological Dictionary of Chemistry and Minerology|journal=Nature|volume=124|issue=3134|last=Bailey and Bailey|first=Dorothy and Kenneth|year=1929|isbn=|pages=789–790|bibcode=1929Natur.124..789V|doi=10.1038/124789b0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most common fatty acid in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/965#section=Top|title=9-Octadecenoic acid|publisher=PubChem, National Center for Biotechnology Information, US National Library of Medicine|date=14 July 2018|accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==
Fatty acids (or their salts) do not often occur as such  in biological systems.  Instead fatty acids like oleic acid occur as their [[ester]]s, commonly [[triglyceride]]s, which are the greasy materials in many natural oils.  Fatty acids can be obtained by the [[saponification]] of [[triglyceride]]s.

[[Triglyceride]]s of oleic acid comprise the majority of olive oil. [[Olive oil acidity|Free oleic acid]] renders olive oil inedible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Olive Oil and Olive-Pomace Oil Grades and Standards {{!}} Agricultural Marketing Service|url = http://www.ams.usda.gov/grades-standards/olive-oil-and-olive-pomace-oil-grades-and-standards|website = www.ams.usda.gov|access-date = 2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also makes up 59-75% of [[pecan oil]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.07.024 |title=Phytochemical constituents and antioxidant capacity of different pecan Carya illinoinensis (Wangenh.)

==Production and chemical behavior==
The [[biosynthesis]] of oleic acid involves the action of the enzyme [[stearoyl-CoA 9-desaturase]] acting on stearoyl-CoA.  In effect, [[stearic acid]] is [[Dehydrogenation|dehydrogenated]] to give the monounsaturated derivative oleic acid.

Oleic acid undergoes the reactions of carboxylic acids and [[alkene]]s. It is soluble in aqueous base to give [[soap]]s called oleates. Iodine adds across the double bond. Hydrogenation of the double bond yields the [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] derivative [[stearic acid]].  [[Redox|Oxidation]] at the [[double bond]] occurs slowly in air, and is known as [[rancidification]] in foodstuffs or [[drying oil|drying]] in coatings. [[Redox|Reduction]] of the [[carboxylic acid]] group yields [[oleyl alcohol]]. [[Ozonolysis]] of oleic acid is an important route to [[azelaic acid]]. The coproduct is nonanoic acid:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1002/14356007.a08_523 |chapter=Dicarboxylic Acids, Aliphatic |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |year=2000 |last1=Cornils |first1=Boy |last2=Lappe |first2=Peter |isbn=978-3-527-30673-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Esters of azelaic acid find applications in lubrication and plasticizers.

==Related compounds==
The [[Cis–trans isomerism|stereoisomer]] of oleic acid is called [[elaidic acid]] or [[Elaidic acid|trans-9-octadecenoic acid]]. These isomers have distinct physical properties and biochemical properties. Elaidic acid, the most abundant trans fatty acid in diet, appears to have an adverse effect on health.&lt;ref&gt;Tardy, Anne-Laure; Morio, Beatrice; Chardigny, Jean-Michel; Malpuech-Brugere, Corinne "Ruminant and industrial sources of trans-fat and cardiovascular and diabetic diseases" Nutrition Research Reviews 2011, volume 24, pp. 111-117. {{DOI|10.1017/S0954422411000011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reaction that converts oleic acid to elaidic acid is called [[elaidinization]].

Another naturally occurring isomer of oleic acid is [[petroselinic acid]].

In chemical analysis, fatty acids are separated by gas chromatography of their methyl ester derivatives.  Alternatively, separation of unsaturated isomers is possible by argentation thin-layer chromatography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Breuer | first1 = B. | last2 = Fock | first2 = H.

==Uses==
The principal use of oleic acid is as a component in many foods, in the form of its triglycerides.  It is a component of the normal human diet as a part of animal fats and vegetable oils.

Oleic acid as its sodium salt is a major component of soap as an [[Emulsion|emulsifying agent]].

===Niche uses===
Oleic acid is also used to induce lung damage in certain types of animals, for the purpose of testing new drugs and other means to treat lung diseases.

==Health effects==
Oleic acid is a common [[monounsaturated fat]] in human diet. Monounsaturated fat consumption has been associated with decreased [[Low-density lipoprotein|low-density lipoprotein (LDL)]] cholesterol, and possibly increased [[High-density lipoprotein|high-density lipoprotein (HDL)]] cholesterol.&lt;ref&gt;

It now refers to any virus with a [[DNA]] or RNA genome causing cancer and is synonymous with "tumor virus" or "cancer virus". The vast majority of human and animal viruses do not cause cancer, probably because of longstanding co-evolution between the virus and its host. Oncoviruses have been important not only in epidemiology, but also in investigations of cell cycle control mechanisms such as the Retinoblastoma protein.

The [[World Health Organization]]'s [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] estimated that in 2002, infection caused 17.8% of human cancers, with 11.9% caused by one of seven viruses.&lt;ref name=Parkin06&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Parkin DM | title = The global health burden of infection-associated cancers in the year 2002 | journal = Int. J. Cancer | volume = 118 | issue = 12 | pages = 3030–44 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16404738 | doi = 10.1002/ijc.21731 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These cancers might be easily prevented through vaccination (e.g., [[HPV vaccine|papillomavirus vaccines]]), diagnosed with simple blood tests, and treated with less-toxic antiviral compounds.

==Background==
Generally, tumor viruses cause little or no disease after infection in their hosts, or cause non-[[neoplastic]] diseases such as acute hepatitis for [[hepatitis B virus]] or mononucleosis for [[Epstein–Barr virus]]. A minority of persons (or animals) will go on to develop cancers after infection. This has complicated efforts to determine whether or not a given virus causes cancer. The well-known [[Koch's postulates]], 19th-century constructs developed by [[Robert Koch]] to establish the likelihood that ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' will cause [[anthrax]] disease, are not applicable to viral diseases. (Firstly, this is because viruses cannot truly be isolated in pure culture—even stringent isolation techniques cannot exclude undetected contaminating viruses with similar density characteristics, and viruses must be grown on cells. Secondly, asymptomatic virus infection and carriage is the norm for most tumor viruses, which violates Koch's third principle. Relman and Fredericks have described the difficulties in applying Koch's postulates to virus-induced cancers.&lt;ref name="pmid8665474"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fredricks DN, Relman DA | title = Sequence-based identification of microbial pathogens: a reconsideration of Koch's postulates | journal = Clin. Microbiol. Rev. | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 18–33 | date = January 1996 | pmid = 8665474 | pmc = 172879 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the host restriction for human viruses makes it unethical to experimentally transmit a suspected cancer virus.) Other measures, such as [[Bradford Hill criteria|A. B. Hill's criteria]],&lt;ref name="pmid14283879"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Hill AB |title = The Environment and Disease: Association or Causation? |journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=58 |issue= 5|pages=295–300 |date=May 1965 |pmid = 14283879 |pmc = 1898525 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are more relevant to cancer virology but also have some limitations in determining causality.

Tumor viruses come in a variety of forms: Viruses with a [[DNA]] [[genome]], such as [[adenovirus]], and viruses with an RNA genome, like the [[Hepatitis C virus]] (HCV), can cause cancers, as can retroviruses having both DNA and RNA genomes ([[Human T-lymphotropic virus]] and [[hepatitis B virus]], which normally replicates as a mixed double and single-stranded DNA virus but also has a retroviral replication component). In many cases, tumor viruses do not cause cancer in their native hosts but only in dead-end species. For example, adenoviruses do not cause cancer in humans but are instead responsible for colds, conjunctivitis and other acute illnesses. They only become tumorigenic when infected into certain rodent species, such as Syrian hamsters. Some viruses are tumorigenic when they infect a cell and persist as circular [[episome]]s or plasmids, replicating separately from host cell DNA ([[Epstein–Barr virus]] and [[Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus]]). Other viruses are only carcinogenic when they integrate into the host cell genome as part of a biological accident, such as polyomaviruses and papillomaviruses.

A direct oncogenic viral mechanism&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Parsonnet, Julie |title=Microbes and malignancy: infection as a cause of human cancers |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1999 |pages= |isbn=978-0-19-510401-1}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; involves either insertion of additional viral oncogenic genes into the host cell or to enhance already existing oncogenic genes ([[proto-oncogenes]]) in the genome. Indirect viral oncogenicity involves chronic nonspecific inflammation occurring over decades of infection, as is the case for HCV-induced liver cancer. These two mechanisms differ in their biology and epidemiology: direct tumor viruses must have at least one virus copy in every tumor cell expressing at least one protein or RNA that is causing the cell to become cancerous. Because foreign virus [[antigen]]s are expressed in these tumors, persons who are immunosuppressed such as AIDS or transplant patients are at higher risk for these types of cancers. Chronic indirect tumor viruses, on the other hand, can be lost (at least theoretically) from a mature tumor that has accumulated sufficient mutations and growth conditions (hyperplasia) from the chronic inflammation of viral infection. In this latter case, it is controversial but at least theoretically possible that an indirect tumor virus could undergo "hit-and-run" and so the virus would be lost from the clinically diagnosed tumor. In practical terms, this is an uncommon occurrence if it does occur.

==History==
{{see also|History of cancer}}
The theory that cancer could be caused by a virus began with the experiments of Oluf Bang and Vilhelm Ellerman in 1908 who first show that avian erythroblastosis (a form of chicken leukemia) could be transmitted by cell-free extracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Ellerman C, Bang O |title=Experimentelle Leukämie bei Hühnern |journal=Zentralbl. Bakteriol. Parasitenkd. Infectionskr. Hyg. Abt.

By the early 1950s it was known that viruses could remove and incorporate genes and genetic material in cells. It was suggested that these new genes inserted into cells could make the cell cancerous. Many of these viral oncogenes have been discovered and identified to cause cancer.

The main viruses associated with human cancers are [[human papillomavirus]], hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus, [[Epstein–Barr virus]], [[human T-lymphotropic virus]], [[Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus]] (KSHV) and [[Merkel cell polyomavirus]]. Experimental and epidemiological data imply a causative role for viruses and they appear to be the second most important risk factor for cancer development in humans, exceeded only by tobacco usage.&lt;ref name="zur Hausen-viruses"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=zur Hausen H |title=Viruses in human cancers |journal=Science |volume=254 |issue=5035 |pages=1167–73 |date=November 1991 |pmid=1659743 |doi=10.1126/science.1659743}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mode of virally induced tumors can be divided into two, ''acutely transforming'' or ''slowly transforming''. In acutely transforming viruses, the viral particles carry a gene that encodes for an overactive oncogene called viral-oncogene (v-onc), and the infected cell is transformed as soon as v-onc is expressed. In contrast, in slowly transforming viruses, the virus genome is inserted, especially as viral genome insertion is an obligatory part of [[retrovirus]]es, near a proto-oncogene in the host genome. The viral [[promoter (biology)|promoter]] or other transcription regulation elements in turn cause overexpression of that proto-oncogene, which in turn induces uncontrolled cellular proliferation. Because viral genome insertion is not specific to proto-oncogenes and the chance of insertion near that proto-oncogene is low, slowly transforming viruses have very long tumor latency compared to acutely transforming viruses, which already carry the viral oncogene.

Hepatitis viruses, including [[hepatitis B]] and [[hepatitis C]], can induce a chronic viral infection that leads to [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]] in 0.47% of hepatitis B patients per year (especially in Asia, less so in North America), and in 1.4% of hepatitis C carriers per year. Liver cirrhosis, whether from chronic viral hepatitis infection or alcoholism, is associated with the development of liver cancer, and the combination of cirrhosis and viral hepatitis presents the highest risk of liver cancer development. Worldwide, liver cancer is one of the most common, and most deadly, cancers due to a huge burden of [[viral hepatitis]] transmission and disease.

Through advances in cancer research, vaccines designed to prevent cancer have been created. The hepatitis B vaccine is the first vaccine that has been established to prevent cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) by preventing infection with the causative virus.  In 2006, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] approved a [[human papilloma virus]] vaccine, called [[Gardasil]]. The vaccine protects against four HPV types, which together cause 70% of cervical cancers and 90% of genital warts. In March 2007, the US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) [[Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices]] (ACIP) officially recommended that females aged 11–12 receive the vaccine, and indicated that females as young as age 9 and as old as age 26 are also candidates for immunization.

==DNA Oncoviruses==

===Introduction===

DNA oncoviruses typically impair two families of tumor suppressor proteins: tumor proteins [[p53]] and the [[retinoblastoma protein]]s (Rb). It is evolutionarily advantageous for viruses to inactivate p53 because p53 can trigger cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in infected cells when the virus attempts to replicate its DNA.&lt;ref name= Ma&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mantovani F, Banks L | title = The human papillomavirus E6 protein and its contribution to malignant progression | journal = Oncogene | volume = 20 | issue = 54 | pages = 7874–87 | date = November 2001 | pmid = 11753670 | doi = 10.1038/sj.onc.1204869 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Rb proteins regulate many essential cell functions, including but not limited to a crucial cell cycle checkpoint, making them a target for viruses attempting to interrupt regular cell function.&lt;ref name= Fm&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Felsani A, Mileo AM, Paggi MG | title = Retinoblastoma family proteins as key targets of the small DNA virus oncoproteins | journal = Oncogene | volume = 25 | issue = 38 | pages = 5277–85 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16936748 | doi = 10.1038/sj.onc.1209621 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While several DNA oncoviruses have been discovered, three have been studied extensively. [[Adenoviruses]] can lead to tumors in rodent models but do not cause cancer in humans; however, they have been exploited as delivery vehicles in gene therapy for diseases such as cystic fibrosis and cancer.&lt;ref name= GastonK&gt;{{cite book | veditors = Gaston, K| year=2012 | title=Small DNA Tumor Viruses | publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]] | isbn= 978-1-904455-99-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simian virus 40]] (SV40), a [[polyomavirus]], can cause tumors in rodent models but is not oncogenic in humans.&lt;ref name= Po&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Poulin DL, DeCaprio JA | title = Is there a role for SV40 in human cancer? | journal = J.

All three of these DNA oncoviruses are able to integrate their DNA into the host cell, and use this to transcribe it and transform cells by bypassing the G1/S checkpoint of the cell cycle.

===Integration of viral DNA===

DNA oncoviruses transform infected cells by integrating their DNA into the host cell’s genome.&lt;ref name= Sa&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sambrook J, Greene R, Stringer J, Mitchison T, Hu SL, Botchan M | title = Analysis of the sites of integration of viral DNA sequences in rat cells transformed by adenovirus 2 or SV40 | journal = Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. | volume = 44 Pt 1, | issue = | pages = 569–84 | date = 1980 | pmid = 6253158 | doi = 10.1101/sqb.1980.044.01.059 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DNA is believed to be inserted during transcription or replication, when the two annealed strands are separated.&lt;ref name= Sa/&gt; This event is relatively rare and generally unpredictable; there seems to be no deterministic predictor of the site of integration.&lt;ref name= Sa/&gt; After integration, the host’s cell cycle loses regulation from Rb and p53, and the cell begins cloning to form a tumor.

===The G1/S Checkpoint===

Rb and p53 regulate the transition between [[G1 phase|G1]] and [[S phase]], arresting the cell cycle before DNA replication until the appropriate checkpoint inputs, such as DNA damage repair, are completed.&lt;ref name= Mo&gt;{{cite book | author= Morgan, D. O. | year=2007 | title=The cell cycle: principles of control | publisher=New Science Press | isbn= 978-1-904455-99-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; p53 regulates the p21 gene, which produces a protein which binds to the Cyclin D-Cdk4/6 complex.&lt;ref name= Le&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Levine AJ | title = The common mechanisms of transformation by the small DNA tumor viruses: The inactivation of tumor suppressor gene products: p53 | journal = Virology | volume = 384 | issue = 2 | pages = 285–93 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19081592 | doi = 10.1016/j.virol.2008.09.034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This prevents Rb phosphorylation and prevents the cell from entering S phase.&lt;ref name= Le/&gt; In mammals, when Rb is active (unphosphorylated), it inhibits the [[E2F]] family of transcription factors, which regulate the [[Cyclin E]]-[[Cdk2]] complex, which inhibits Rb, forming a positive feedback loop, keeping the cell in G1 until the input crosses a threshold.&lt;ref name= Mo/&gt; To drive the cell into S phase prematurely, the viruses must inactivate p53, which plays a central role in the G1/S checkpoint, as well as Rb, which, though downstream of it, is typically kept active by a positive feedback loop.

===Inactivation of p53===

Viruses employ various methods of inactivating p53. The [[adenovirus E1B protein]] (55K) prevents p53 from regulating genes by binding to the site on p53 which binds to the genome.&lt;ref name= Ma/&gt; In SV40, the [[large T antigen]] (LT) is an analogue; LT also binds to several other cellular proteins, such as [[p107]] and [[p130]], on the same residues.&lt;ref name= Dc&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = DeCaprio JA | title = How the Rb tumor suppressor structure and function was revealed by the study of Adenovirus and SV40 | journal = Virology | volume = 384 | issue = 2 | pages = 274–84 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19150725 | doi = 10.1016/j.virol.2008.12.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; LT binds to p53’s binding domain on the DNA (rather than on the protein), again preventing p53 from appropriately regulating genes.&lt;ref name= Ma/&gt; HPV instead degrades p53: the HPV protein E6 binds to a cellular protein called the E6-associated protein (E6-AP, also known as [[UBE3A]]), forming a complex which causes the rapid and specific [[ubiquitination]] of p53.&lt;ref name= Sc&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Scheffner M, Huibregtse JM, Vierstra RD, Howley PM | title = The HPV-16 E6 and E6-AP complex functions as a ubiquitin-protein ligase in the ubiquitination of p53 | journal = Cell | volume = 75 | issue = 3 | pages = 495–505 | date = November 1993 | pmid = 8221889 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(93)90384-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inactivation of Rb===

Rb is inactivated (thereby allowing the G1/S transition to progress unimpeded) by different but analogous viral oncoproteins. The [[adenovirus early region 1A]] (E1A) is an oncoprotein which binds to Rb and can stimulate transcription and transform cells.&lt;ref name= Ma/&gt; SV40 uses the same protein for inactivating Rb, LT, to inactivate p53.&lt;ref name= Le/&gt; HPV contains a protein, E7, which can bind to Rb in much the same way.&lt;ref name= Dy&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dyson N, Howley PM, Münger K, Harlow E | title = The human papilloma virus-16 E7 oncoprotein is able to bind to the retinoblastoma gene product | journal = Science | volume = 243 | issue = 4893 | pages = 934–7 | date = February 1989 | pmid = 2537532 | doi = 10.1126/science.2537532 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rb can be inactivated by phosphorylation, or by being bound to a viral oncoprotein, or by mutations—mutations which prevent oncoprotein binding are also associated with cancer.&lt;ref name= Dc/&gt;

===Variations===

DNA oncoviruses typically cause cancer by inactivating p53 and Rb, thereby allowing unregulated cell division and creating tumors. There may be many different mechanisms which have evolved separately; in addition to those described above, for example, the [[Hepatitis B virus]] (an RNA virus) inactivates p53 by sequestering it in the cytoplasm.&lt;ref name= Ma/&gt;

SV40 has been well studied and does not cause cancer in humans, but a recently discovered analogue called [[Merkel cell polyomavirus]] has been associated with [[Merkel cell carcinoma]], a form of skin cancer.&lt;ref name= Fe&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Feng H, Shuda M, Chang Y, Moore PS | title = Clonal integration of a polyomavirus in human Merkel cell carcinoma | journal = Science | volume = 319 | issue = 5866 | pages = 1096–100 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18202256 | pmc = 2740911 | doi = 10.1126/science.1152586 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rb binding feature is believed to be the same between the two viruses.&lt;ref name= Fe/&gt;

==RNA Oncoviruses==

===Brief history===
In the 1960s, the replication process of RNA virus was believed to be similar to other single-stranded RNA. Single-stranded RNA replication involves RNA-dependent RNA synthesis which meant that virus-coding enzymes would make partial double-stranded RNA. This belief was proven to be incorrect because there were no double-stranded RNA found in the retrovirus cell. In 1964, Howard Temin proposed a provirus hypothesis, but shortly after reverse transcription in the retrovirus genome was discovered.

===Description of virus===
All retroviruses have three major coding domains; ''gag, pol ''and'' env''. In the ''gag'' region of the virus, the synthesis of the internal virion proteins are maintained which make up the matrix, capsid and nucleocapsid proteins. In ''pol'', the information for the reverse transcription and integration enzymes are stored. In ''env'', it is derived from the surface and transmembrane for the viral envelope protein. There is a fourth coding domain which is smaller, but exists in all retroviruses. ''Pol'' is the domain that encodes the virion protease.

===Retrovirus enters host cell===
The retrovirus begins the journey into a host cell by attaching a surface glycoprotein to the cell's plasma membrane receptor. Once inside the cell, the retrovirus goes through reverse transcription in the cytoplasm and generates a double-stranded DNA copy of the RNA genome. Reverse transcription also produces identical structures known as long terminal repeats (LTRs). Long terminal repeats are at the ends of the DNA strands and regulates viral gene expression. The viral DNA is then translocated into the nucleus where one strand of the retroviral genome is put into the chromosomal DNA by the help of the virion intergrase. At this point the retrovirus is referred to as provirus. Once in the chromosomal DNA, the provirus is transcribed by the cellular RNA polymerase II. The transcription leads to the splicing and full-length mRNAs and full-length progeny virion RNA. The virion protein and progeny RNA assemble in the cytoplasm and leave the cell, whereas the other copies send translated viral messages in the cytoplasm.

==Classification==

===DNA viruses===
*[[Human papilloma virus]] (HPV), a DNA virus, causes [[Malignant transformation|transformation]] in cells through interfering with tumor suppressor proteins such as [[p53]]. Interfering with the action of p53 allows a cell infected with the virus to move into a different stage of the cell cycle, enabling the virus genome to be replicated. Forcing the cell into the S phase of the [[cell cycle]] could cause the cell to become transformed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Scheffner M, Werness BA, Huibregtse JM, Levine AJ, Howley PM |title=The E6 oncoprotein encoded by human papillomavirus types 16 and 18 promotes the degradation of p53 |journal=Cell |volume=63 |issue=6 |pages=1129–36 |date=December 1990 |pmid=2175676 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(90)90409-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some types of HPV increase the risk of, e.g., [[cervical cancer]].

Not all oncoviruses are [[DNA virus]]es.  Some [[RNA virus]]es have also been associated such as the [[hepatitis C virus]] as well as certain retroviruses, e.g., [[human T-lymphotropic virus]] (HTLV-1) and [[Rous sarcoma virus]] (RSV).

'''Overdrive voltage''', usually abbreviated as '''V&lt;sub&gt;OV&lt;/sub&gt;''', is typically referred to in the context of [[MOSFET]] [[transistors]].  The overdrive voltage is defined as the voltage between transistor gate and source (V&lt;sub&gt;GS&lt;/sub&gt;) in excess of the [[threshold voltage]] (V&lt;sub&gt;TH&lt;/sub&gt;) where V&lt;sub&gt;TH&lt;/sub&gt; is defined as the minimum voltage required between gate and source to turn the transistor on (allow it to conduct electricity).  Due to this definition, overdrive voltage is also known as "excess gate voltage" or "effective voltage."&lt;ref&gt;Sedra and Smith, Microelectronic Circuits, Fifth Edition, (2004) Chapter 4, {{ISBN|978-0-19-533883-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Overdrive voltage can be found using the simple equation: V&lt;sub&gt;OV&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;GS&lt;/sub&gt; − V&lt;sub&gt;TH&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Technology==
V&lt;sub&gt;OV&lt;/sub&gt; is important as it directly affects the output drain terminal current (I&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;) of the transistor, an important property of amplifier circuits.  By increasing V&lt;sub&gt;OV&lt;/sub&gt;, I&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; can be increased until [[Saturation current|saturation]] is reached.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee105/fa07/lectures/Lecture%2024.ppt Lecture Note of Prof Liu, UC Berkeley]&lt;/ref&gt;

Overdrive voltage is also important because of its relationship to V&lt;sub&gt;DS&lt;/sub&gt;, the drain voltage relative to the source, which can be used to determine the region of operation of the MOSFET.  The table below shows how to use overdrive voltage to understand what region of operation the MOSFET is in:

| Saturation (CCR)
| The MOSFET is delivering a high amount of current, and changing V&lt;sub&gt;DS&lt;/sub&gt; won't do much.
|-
| V&lt;sub&gt;DS&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; V&lt;sub&gt;OV&lt;/sub&gt;; V&lt;sub&gt;GS&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; V&lt;sub&gt;TH&lt;/sub&gt;
| Triode (Linear)
| The MOSFET is delivering current in a linear relationship to the voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;DS&lt;/sub&gt;).
|-
| V&lt;sub&gt;GS&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; V&lt;sub&gt;TH&lt;/sub&gt;
| Cutoff
| The MOSFET is turned off, and should not be delivering any current.
|}

A more physics-related explanation follows:

In an NMOS transistor, the channel region under zero bias has an abundance of holes (i.e., it is p-type silicon).  By applying a negative gate bias (V&lt;sub&gt;GS&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0) we attract MORE holes, and this is called accumulation.  A positive gate voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;GS&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0) will attract electrons and repel holes, and this is called depletion because we are depleting the number of holes.  At a critical voltage called the THRESHOLD VOLTAGE (V&lt;sub&gt;TH&lt;/sub&gt;) the channel will actually be so depleted of holes and rich in electrons that it will INVERT to being n-type silicon, and this is called the inversion region.

As we increase this voltage, V&lt;sub&gt;GS&lt;/sub&gt;, beyond V&lt;sub&gt;TH&lt;/sub&gt;, we are said to be then OVERDRIVING the gate by creating a stronger channel, hence the OVERDRIVE VOLTAGE (Called often V&lt;sub&gt;ov&lt;/sub&gt;, V&lt;sub&gt;od&lt;/sub&gt;, or V&lt;sub&gt;on&lt;/sub&gt;) is defined as (V&lt;sub&gt;GS&lt;/sub&gt; − V&lt;sub&gt;TH&lt;/sub&gt;)

'''Palagonite''' is an alteration product from the interaction of water with [[volcanic glass]] of chemical composition similar to [[basalt]]. Palagonite can also result from the interaction between water and basalt melt. The water flashes to steam on contact with the hot [[lava]] and the small fragments of lava react with the steam to form the light colored palagonite [[tuff]] [[Volcanic cone|cones]] common in areas of basaltic eruptions in contact with water. An example is found in the [[pyroclastic]] cones of the [[Galapagos Islands]]. [[Charles Darwin]] recognized the origin of these cones during his visit to the islands.   Palagonite can also be formed by a slower [[weathering]] of lava into palagonite, resulting in a thin, yellow-orange rind on the surface of the rock.  The process of conversion of lava to palagonite is called ''palagonitization.''

Palagonite soil is a light yellow-orange dust, comprising a mixture of particles ranging down to sub-micrometer sizes, usually found mixed with larger fragments of lava.  The color is indicative of the presence of [[Iron oxide|iron]] in the +3 [[oxidation state]], embedded in an amorphous [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]].

'''Palagonite tuff''' is a [[tuff]] composed of [[sideromelane]] fragments and coarser pieces of [[basalt]]ic rock, embedded in a palagonite matrix. A composite of sideromelane [[Aggregate (geology)|aggregate]] in palagonite matrix is called [[hyaloclastite]].

==Palagonite on Mars==
Based on infrared [[spectroscopy]], the fine-grained component of [[Mauna Kea|Mauna-Kea]] palagonite is the terrestrial material with the best match to the spectral properties of Martian dust, and is believed to be similar in composition and in origin to dusty component of the surface [[regolith]] of [[Mars]].&lt;ref&gt;R.B.

[[Image:Snake and Fish.jpg|thumb|[[Northern water snake]] (''Nerodia sipedon'') eating a fish]]
A '''piscivore''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɪ|s|ᵻ|v|ɔər}} is a [[carnivore|carnivorous]] animal that eats primarily [[fish]]. Piscivorous is equivalent to the Greek-derived word '''ichthyophagous'''. Fish were the diet of early [[tetrapod]]s (amphibians); [[insectivory]] came next, then in time, reptiles added [[herbivory]].&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/38/12/1079 | author= Sahney, S., Benton, M. J. &amp; Falcon-Lang, H. J. | year=2010 | title= Rainforest collapse triggered Pennsylvanian tetrapod diversification in Euramerica | journal=Geology | volume = 38 | pages = 1079–1082 | format=PDF | doi=10.1130/G31182.1 | issue=12| bibcode=2010Geo....38.1079S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some animals, such as the [[sea lion]] and [[alligator]], are not completely piscivorous, often preying on aquatic invertebrates or land animals in addition to fish, while others, such as the [[bulldog bat]] and [[gharial]], are strictly dependent on fish for food. [[Human]]s can live on fish-based diets as can their carnivorous domesticated pets, such as dogs and cats.  The name "piscivore" is derived from the [[Latin]] word for fish, ''[[wikt:piscis#Latin|piscis]]''. Some creatures, including [[cnidarian]]s, [[octopus]]es, [[squid]], [[spider]]s, [[shark]]s, [[cetacean]]s, [[grizzly bear]]s, [[jaguar]]s, [[wolf|wolves]], [[snake]]s, [[turtle]]s, and [[sea gull]]s, may have fish as significant if not dominant portions of their diets.

The ecological effects of piscivores can extend to other food chains.  In a study of [[cutthroat trout]] stocking, researchers found that the addition of this piscivore can have noticeable effects on non-aquatic organisms, in this case bats feeding on insects emerging from the water with the trout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rudman|first=Seth M.|last2=Heavyside|first2=Julian|last3=Rennison|first3=Diana J.|last4=Schluter|first4=Dolph|date=2016-12-01|title=Piscivore addition causes a trophic cascade within and across ecosystem boundaries|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/oik.03204/abstract|journal=Oikos|language=en|volume=125|issue=12|pages=1782–1789|doi=10.1111/oik.03204|issn=1600-0706}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There exists classifications of primary and secondary piscivores. Primary piscivores, also known as "specialists", shift to this habit in the first few months of their lives. Secondary piscivores will move to eating primarily fish later in their lifetime. It is hypothesized that the secondary piscivores' diet change is due to an adaptation to maintain efficiency in their use of energy while growing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Fish Biology and Fisheries|last=Hart|first=Paul|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=2002|isbn=0632054123|location=350 Main Street, Malden, MA 02148|pages=267–283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ismet Cakar, a chemical engineer, began making early contributions to polyester resin modification and gelcoat UV stabilizers. Cakar worked on [[polymerization]] and resins at Ilkester, leaving to found a start-up. In 1983, Cakar launched the company that would become Poliya. Early on, Poliya recognized that composite materials would need special functions under different usage conditions (UV resistant, chemical resistant, etc.), and these composite resins would be required in various low weight and corrosion resistant applications which would require similar modification technology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3187">'''Power cycling''' is the act of turning a piece of equipment, usually a [[computer]], off and then on again. Reasons for power cycling include having an electronic device reinitialize its set of configuration parameters or recover from an unresponsive state of its mission critical functionality, such as in a [[Crash (computing)|crash]] or [[Hang (computing)|hang]] situation. Power cycling can also be used to reset network activity inside a modem. It can also be among the first steps for troubleshooting an issue.

==Overview==
Power cycling can be done manually, usually using a switch on the device to be cycled; automatically, through some type of device, system, or [[network management]] monitoring and control; or by remote control; through a communication channel.

In the [[data center]] environment, remote control power cycling can usually be done through a [[power distribution unit]], over [[TCP/IP]]. In the home environment, this can be done through [[home automation]] [[Power line communication|powerline]] communications or IP protocols. Most [[Internet Service Provider]]s publish a 'how-to' on their website showing their customers the correct procedure to power cycle their devices.

Power cycling is a standard diagnostic procedure usually performed first when the computer freezes. However, frequently power cycling a computer can cause [[thermal stress]].&lt;ref name="Mueller2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Scott Mueller|title=Upgrading and Repairing PCs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eV1_LjW3pTkC&amp;pg=PA1195|year=2003|publisher=Que Publishing|isbn=978-0-7897-2745-9|page=1195|chapter=21: Power Cycling|series=Upgrading and Repairing Series|accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reset (computing)|Reset]] has an equal effect on the software but may be less problematic for the hardware as power is not interrupted.

==Historical uses==
On all [[Apollo program|Apollo]] missions to the moon, the landing radar was required to acquire the surface before a landing could be attempted.  But on [[Apollo 14]], the landing radar was unable to lock on.  Mission control told the astronauts to cycle the power.  They did, the radar locked on just in time, and the landing was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Digital Apollo: Human and Machine in Spaceflight |author=David A. Mindell |publisher=MIT Press |date=2011}}  Page 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta]] mission to comet [[67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko]], the [[Philae (spacecraft)|Philae]] lander did not return the expected telemetry on awakening after arrival at the comet.  The problem was diagnosed as "somehow a glitch in the electronics",  engineers cycled the power, and the lander awoke correctly. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Video: Flight director updates status of comet lander |last=Clark |first=Stephen |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/2014/11/11/video-flight-director-updates-status-of-comet-lander/ |website=spaceflightnow.com |date=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''roly-poly toy''', '''round-bottomed doll''', '''tilting doll''', '''tumbler''' or '''wobbly man''' is a round-bottomed toy, usually egg-shaped, that tends to right itself when pushed at an angle, and does this in seeming contradiction to the force of gravity. The toy is typically hollow with a weight inside the bottom [[Sphere#Hemisphere|hemisphere]]. The placement of this weight is such that the toy has a [[center of mass]] below the center of the hemisphere, so that any tilting raises the center of mass. When such a toy is pushed over, it wobbles for a few moments while it seeks the upright orientation, which has an [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] at the minimum [[gravitational potential energy]].

Different toy manufacturers and different cultures have produced different-looking roly-poly toys: the ''[[okiagari-koboshi]]'' and some types of [[Daruma doll]] of [[Japan]], the ''nevаlyashka'' ("untopply") or ''van'ka-vstan'ka'' ("Ivan-get-up") of [[Russia]], and Playskool's [[Weeble]]s. Japanese ''okiagari'' means "to get up (''oki'') and arise (''agari'')"; the self-righting characteristic of the toy has come to symbolize the ability to have success, overcome adversity, and recover from misfortune.&lt;ref&gt;Kyburz, Josef A., "{{-'}}Omocha': Things to Play (or Not to Play) With" ''Asian Folklore Studies'', Vol. 53, No. 1 (1994), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Traditional Chinese examples are hollow clay figures of plump children, but "many Chinese folk artists shape their tumblers in the image of clownish [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarins]] as they appear on stage; in this way they mock the inefficiency and ineptitude of the bureaucrats".&lt;ref&gt;Lang Shaojun, "Traditional Chinese Painting in the Twentieth Century", ''Three Thousand Years of Chinese Painting'' (New Haven: Yale UP, 1997), p. 312. {{ISBN|0-300-07013-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A toy manufacturer recommends roly-poly toys for small children just developing [[motor skill]]s; a child can bat at it without its rolling away.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040309095802/http://www.fisher-price.com/AU/playstages/play.asp?lMinAge=33&amp;lMaxAge=42 Fisher-Price - All About Play ... stages, toys &amp; tips: Roly-poly bat-at toys]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dynamogene Theater stages a performance called "Monsieur Culbuto", allowing the audience to interact with a human dressed as a roly-poly toy.

The [[Noddy (character)|Noddy]] stories by [[Enid Blyton]] features the character Mr. Wobblyman, who is based on this type of toy. 

One of the puppets/non-human presenters in the TV show ''Playbus'' (later ''[[Playdays]]'') was a roly-poly [[clown]] called Wobble.

[[File:Schwimmenden Strom-Boje.JPG|thumb|A small and floating run-of-the-river power plant in Austria.]]

'''Run-of-river hydroelectricity''' ('''ROR''') or '''run-of-the-river hydroelectricity''' is a type of [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] generation plant whereby little or no water storage is provided. Run-of-the-river power plants may have no water storage at all or a limited amount of storage, in which case the storage reservoir is referred to as [[pondage]]. A plant without pondage is subject to seasonal river flows, thus the plant will operate as an [[intermittent energy source]]. Conventional hydro uses [[reservoir]]s, which regulate water for flood control and [[dispatchable generation|dispatchable]] electrical power.

== Concept ==

Run-of-the-river or ROR hydroelectricity is considered ideal for streams or rivers that can sustain a minimum flow or those regulated by a lake or reservoir upstream.&lt;ref name="Dwivedi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dwivedi|first=A.K.

A small dam is usually built to create a headpond ensuring that there is enough water entering the [[penstock]] pipes that lead to the [[turbines]] which are at a lower elevation.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt; Projects with pondage, as opposed to those without pondage, can store water for daily load demands.&lt;ref name="Dwivedi"/&gt; In general, projects divert some or most of a river's flow (up to 95% of mean annual discharge)&lt;ref name="one"&gt;Knight Piesold Consulting.

Knight Piesold Consulting.&lt;/ref&gt; through a pipe and/or tunnel leading to electricity-generating turbines, then return the water back to the river downstream.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;Douglas T, Broomhall P, Orr C. (2007). [http://www.rivershed.com/documents/Guide_to_RunRiver.pdf Run-of-the-River Hydropower in BC: A Citizen's Guide to Understanding Approvals, Impacts and Sustainability of Independent Power Projects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828221010/http://www.rivershed.com/documents/Guide_to_RunRiver.pdf |date=2008-08-28 }}. Watershed Watch.&lt;/ref&gt;

ROR projects are dramatically different in design and appearance from conventional hydroelectric projects. Traditional hydro dams store enormous quantities of water in [[reservoirs]], sometimes flooding large tracts of land. In contrast, run-of-river projects do not have the [[Reservoir#Environmental_impact|disadvantages associated with reservoirs]], which is why they have less environmental impact.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;Hydromax Energy Limited. [http://www.hydromaxenergy.com/Green+Power/Green+Power.htm Hydromax Energy Limited website]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edison Sault hydroelectric power plant.JPG|thumb|Saint Marys Falls - run of the river (1902)]]
The use of the term "run-of-the-river" for power projects varies around the world. Some may consider a project ROR if power is produced with no water storage while limited storage is considered ROR by others. Developers may mislabel a project ROR to soothe public perception about its environmental or social effects. The [[Bureau of Indian Standards]] describes run-of-the-river hydroelectricity as:&lt;ref name=INDDAM/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A power station utilizing the run of the river flows for generation of power with sufficient pondage for supplying water for meeting diurnal or weekly fluctuations of demand. In such stations, the normal course of the river is not materially altered.&lt;ref name=INDDAM&gt;{{cite web|title=Damming Northeast India|first=Neeraj Vagholikar|last=Partha J. Das1|url=http://www.conflicts.indiawaterportal.org/sites/conflicts.indiawaterportal.org/files/Damming%20Northeast%20India,%20Single%20page%20format.pdf|publisher=Kalpavriksh, Aaranyak and ActionAid India|pages=4–5|accessdate=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Many of the larger ROR projects have been designed to a scale and generating capacity rivaling some traditional hydro dams.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;Plutonic Power (2008). [http://www.ceaa.gc.ca/050/documents/33401/33401E.pdf Revised Project Description for Bute Inlet Hydroelectric Project Requirements. P1]. Plutonic Power.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the [[Beauharnois Hydroelectric Generating Station]] in Quebec is rated at 1,853 MW.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hydroquebec.com/generation/centrale-hydroelectrique.html&lt;/ref&gt; Some run of the river projects are downstream of other dams and reservoirs. The run of the river project didn't build the reservoir, but does take advantage of the water supplied by it. An example would be the 1995 1,436 MW [[La Grande-1 generating station]]. Previous upstream dams and reservoirs are part of the 1980s [[James Bay Project]].

== Advantages ==

When developed with care to footprint size and location, ROR hydro projects can create sustainable energy minimizing impacts to the surrounding environment and nearby communities.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;  Advantages include:

=== Cleaner power, fewer greenhouse gases ===

Like all hydro-electric power, run-of-the-river hydro harnesses the natural potential energy of water, eliminating the need to burn coal or [[natural gas]] to generate the electricity needed by consumers and industry. Moreover, run-of-the-river hydro-electric plants do not have reservoirs thus eliminating the methane and carbon dioxide emissions caused by the decomposition of organic matter in the reservoir of a conventional hydro-electric dam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reservoir Emissions|url=https://www.internationalrivers.org/campaigns/reservoir-emissions|website=International Rivers|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a particular advantage in tropical countries where methane generation can be a problem.

=== Less flooding/reservoirs ===
Without a reservoir, flooding of the upper part of the river does not take place.  As a result, people remain living at or near the river and existing habitats are not flooded. Any pre-existing pattern of flooding will continue unaltered, presenting a flood risk to the facility and downstream areas.

== Disadvantages ==

=== "Unfirm" power ===

Run-of-the-River power is considered an "unfirm" source of power: a run-of-the-river project has little or no capacity for energy storage&lt;ref name="six"&gt;Douglas, T. (2007). [http://www.watershed-watch.org/publications/files/Run-of-River-long.pdf "Green" Hydro Power: Understanding Impacts, Approvals, and Sustainability of Run-of River Independent Power Projects in British Columbia]. Watershed Watch.&lt;/ref&gt; and hence can't co-ordinate the output of electricity generation to match consumer demand. It thus generates much more power during times when seasonal river flows are high (i.e., spring freshet),&lt;ref name="five"&gt;Wilderness Committee. [http://www.ceaa.gc.ca/050/documents/33144/33144E.pdf Wilderness Committee Comments on the Draft Terms of Reference, Bute Inlet Hydroelectric Private Power Project. Letter to Kathy Eichenberger, Project Assistant Director. P1]. Wilderness Committee.&lt;/ref&gt; and depending on location, much less during drier summer months or frozen winter months.

=== Availability of sites ===
[[File:Raquette (1).jpg|thumb|Rapids can provide enough hydraulic head]]
The potential power at a site is a result of the [[Hydraulic head|head]] and flow of water. By damming a river, the head is available to generate power at the face of the dam. Where a dam may create a reservoir hundreds of kilometres long, in run of the river the head is usually delivered by a canal, pipe or tunnel constructed upstream of the power house. Due to the cost of upstream construction, a steep drop is desirable, such as falls or rapids.

=== Environmental impacts ===

Small, well-sited ROR projects can be developed with minimal environmental impacts.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;  Larger projects have more environmental concerns. In the case of fish-bearing rivers a ladder may be required and dissolved gases downstream may affect fish.

In British Columbia the mountainous terrain and wealth of big rivers have made it a global testing ground for [[Independent power producers in British Columbia|10-50Mw run-of-river technology]].  As of March 2010, there were 628 applications pending for new water licences solely for the purposes of power generation – representing more than 750 potential points of river diversion.&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;IPPwatch.com website. [http://www.ippwatch.info/w/ IPPwatch.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113212256/http://www.ippwatch.info/w/ |date=2011-01-13 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concerns==

The '''Sasaram back-to-back HVDC station'''  is a back-to-back [[HVDC]] connection between the eastern and northern regions in India, located close to the city of [[Sasaram]], in [[Bihar]] state in northeastern India.  The station  is owned by [[Power Grid Corporation of India]].

The converter station consists one pole with a nominal power transmission rating of 500&amp;nbsp;MW.   The converter station was built by [[Alstom]] between 1999 and 2002 and has nominal DC voltage and current ratings of 205&amp;nbsp;kV, 2475 A.&lt;ref&gt;Nayak, R.N., Kumar, D., Kayibabu, B.N., Gulati, R., Baker, M.H., System benefits derived from the 500&amp;nbsp;MW back-to-back HVDC scheme at Sasaram, India,  [[International Council on Large Electric Systems|CIGRÉ]] session, Paris, 2004, paper reference B4-208&lt;/ref&gt;  The design is very similar to that of the [[Chandrapur back-to-back HVDC converter station|Chandrapur]] and [[Vizag back-to-back HVDC converter station|Vizag 1]] converter stations also built for Power Grid.

In 2006 the Eastern and Northern regions were made part of the combined NEW grid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powergridindia.com/_layouts/PowerGrid/User/ContentPage.aspx?PId=78&amp;LangID=English One Nation – One Grid], Powergrid website (retrieved 18 November 2015). &lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the converter station is no longer required for its original purpose of asynchronously linking the Eastern and Northern grids, although it can still be used as an embedded power flow device to help control power flow within the AC system.   The converter station could potentially be shifted to elsewhere to export/import power from other countries.

'''Shakes''' are cracks in timber.   Arising in cut timber they generally cause a reduction in strength.  When found in a log they can result in a significant amount of waste, when a log is converted to lumber.  Apart from heart shakes, often found in trees felled past their best, shakes in a log have no effect on the strength of shake free lumber obtained therefrom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Practical Home Woodworking|publisher=Odhams|date=1952|pages=62–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are often seen in oak-framed buildings, which are constructed of [[green oak]] which cracks while drying.  Due to the immense strength of the oak beams, they are not a cause for concern in a properly engineered building, and are considered part of the charm of the style.

==Heart shake==
Heart shake is a crack in the heartwood, near the centre of the tree.  It is caused by poor seasoning, or by using trees felled past maturity.

==Star shake==
A crack or cracks propagating from near the  edge of the log towards the centre, usually along the line of the [[Medullary ray (botany)|medullary ray]]s.   The cause is often rapid or uneven seasoning, causing the outside of the log to shrink faster than the heart.  Exposure to the elements can cause star shakes, as can frost during the growth of the tree.

==Frost shake==
Frost shake begins on the outside where moisture from rain or other means has penetrated, and freezes, causing damage to the wood on the inside.

==Cup or ring shake==
A cup or ring shake follows the line of annual rings.  The separation of the rings is generally caused during the growth of the tree, either by a check in the growth, or by bending and twisting under high winds.

==Thunder shake or upset==
Thunder shake is across the grain, and hard to detect until the boards are being planed.  It is caused by shock to the wood, such as thunder, or concussion during felling.  This fault seriously weakens the timber.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2867">'''Shand Mason''' was a British company which designed and manufactured [[steam power]]ed [[fire engines]] and other fire-fighting equipment during the 19th century and early 20th centuries.

==History==
[[File:1882 Horse-drawn Shand, Mason &amp; Co. steam fire engine pic3.JPG|thumb|250px|right|1882 Shand Mason and Co fire engine]]
[[File:1889 Pride of Ashburton (25624312204).jpg|thumb|1889 steam pumper, ''Pride of Ashburton'']]
The company that eventually became Shand Mason was founded in 1760 by Samuel Phillips, and incorporated as Phillips and Hopwood in 1797. In 1818, after William Joshua Tilley had joined the business, it became Hopwood and Tilley and later Tilley &amp; Co. In 1850, when Tilley retired from the business, his two sons-in-law James Shand and Samuel Mason continued the business as '''Shand and Mason''', later '''Shand Mason &amp; Co'''.&lt;ref name="Grace's"&gt;{{cite web|title=Shand, Mason and Co|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Shand,_Mason_and_Co|website=Grace's Guide|accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company operated from premises at 75 Upper Ground, Blackfriars, just south of the [[River Thames]] in London, and having initially manufactured manually operated pumps,&lt;ref name="LFB SM pump"&gt;{{cite web|title=Shand Mason six inch manual pump|url=http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/150/shand-mason-six-inch-manual-pump.asp|website=London Fire|accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; secured various patents to improve the design and construction of steam fire engines.&lt;ref name="Grace's" /&gt;

While the first steam-powered fire engine had been developed by [[John Braithwaite (engineer)|John Braithwaite]] and [[John Ericsson]] in 1829, the first commercially successful fire-engine was a water-borne version developed by Shand Mason &amp; Co, which went into service in 1855.&lt;ref name="Beamish"&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction and Development of the Shand-Mason Steam Fire Engine.|url=http://beamishtransportonline.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Shand-Mason-Optimized.pdf|website=Beamish Transport Online|accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this point and particularly from the 1860s, the company worked with the chief of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, [[Eyre Massey Shaw]] and with competitor [[Merryweather &amp; Sons]], to perfect designs for land-based use by the London brigade and other municipalities. Its first land-based engine used by the Brigade was produced in 1860.&lt;ref name="Beamish" /&gt;

Its engines were initially horse-drawn, but later installed on [[fireboat]]s (Europe's first, the ''Fire Queen'' was built by Shand Mason for service in [[Bristol]]'s docks in the 1880s), and mounted on motor vehicles. The business was eventually taken over by Merryweather &amp; Sons in 1928.&lt;ref name="Grace's" /&gt;

A '''shingle weaver''' (US) or '''shingler'''&lt;ref&gt;Waters, Colin (2002). ''A Dictionary of Old Trades, Titles and Occupations'', Newbury: Countryside Books, p. 257. {{ISBN|978-1-85306-794-5}}. The Oxford English Dictionary supports this usage and adds the meaning of one who applies shingles to houses.&lt;/ref&gt; (UK) is an employee of a wood products [[mill (factory)|mill]] who engages in the creation of wooden [[Roof shingle|roofing shingles]] or the closely related product known as "[[shake (shingle)|shakes]]."&lt;ref&gt;In general, shingles are thinner pieces of wood which have been sawed on both sides, while shake is thicker material that is rough split on one side and sawed on the other. Shake may also be rough split on both sides of the board, in which case it would not have been made by a "shingle weaver." See: Cedar Shake and Shingle Bureau, [http://www.cedarbureau.org/faq/product.htm "Frequently Asked Questions."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209042820/http://www.cedarbureau.org/faq/product.htm |date=2010-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of the United States, historically the leading producer of this product, such shingles are generally made of [[Thuja plicata|Western Red Cedar]], an aromatic and disease-resistant wood indigenous to the area. The use of the term "weaver" for a shingle maker related to the way in which the workers fitted the shingles together in bundles but the meaning has extended to anyone who works in a shingle mill.&lt;ref&gt;George Milton Janes, "The Shingle Weavers", ''The Quarterly Journal of the University of North Dakota'', Vol. 11, no. 2. January 1921. 135. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical overview==

===Early manufacturing process===

During the late 19th and early 20th Century, the production of wooden roofing shingles was an extremely dangerous process in which the shingle weaver hand-fed pieces of raw wood onto an automated [[saw]]. Despite the danger of the profession, the industry was a large one throughout [[Washington state|Washington]] and [[Oregon]], and by 1893 [[Washington state]] alone had 150 mills which converted [[Thuja plicata|Western Red Cedar]] into shingles and shakes for the roofing and siding of American homes.

The craft of shingle making demanded a high skill level and considerable manual dexterity.&lt;ref name="Rev30"&gt;Harvey O'Connor, ''Revolution in Seattle: A Memoir.'' New York: Monthly Review Press, 1964; pg. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternate origin for the name "weaver" is that it was this nimble motion of the hands of the [[wikt:sawyer|sawyer]]s around the spinning blades of their saws that provided the origin of the term for the maker of shingles — the woodworkers being likened to skilled operators of [[loom]]s.

''[[Sunset (magazine)|Sunset]]'' magazine described the job of the shingle weavers for its readers:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The saw on his left sets the pace. If the singing blade rips 50 rough shingles off the block every minute, the sawyer must reach over to its teeth 50 times in 60 seconds; if the automatic carriage feeds the odorous wood 60 times into the hungry teeth, 60 times he must reach over, turn the shingle, trim its edge on the gleaming saw in front of him, cut the narrow strip containing the [[knot]] hole with two quick movements of his right hand, and toss the completed board down the chute to the packers, meanwhile keeping eyes and ears open for the sound that asks him to feed a new block into the untiring teeth. Hour after hour the shingle weaver's hands and arms, plain, unarmored flesh and blood, are staked against the screeching steel that cares not what it severs. Hour after hour the steel sings its crescendo note as it bites into the wood, the sawdust cloud thickens, the wet sponge under the sawyer's nose fills with fine particles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
"If 'cedar asthma,' the shingle weaver's [[occupational disease]], does not get him, the steel will. Sooner or later he reaches over a little too far, the whirling blade tosses drops of deep red into the air, and a finger, a hand, or part of an arm comes sliding down the slick chute."&lt;ref&gt;''Sunset'' magazine, quoted in O'Connor, ''Revolution in Seattle,'' page 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Unionization efforts===

The first attempt to unionize shingle weavers came in [[Michigan]] in 1886. This union lasted only a few years, due in large measure to the industry moving westward to the new state of Washington, which entered the United States as the 42nd state in November 1889.&lt;ref name="Emerson"&gt;Philip C. Emerson, [http://depts.washington.edu/labhist/strike/emerson.shtml "The International Shingle Weavers of America: An Historical Essay,''] Seattle General Strike Project, University of Washington, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Pacific Northwest, shingle weavers began to [[trade union|unionize]] as early as 1890, when the shingle weavers of the [[Puget Sound]] area of Western Washington banded together to establish the West Coast Shingle Weavers’ Union.&lt;ref name="Emerson" /&gt; In short order, locals of the union were established in [[Ballard, Washington|Ballard]], [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], [[Snohomish, Washington|Snohomish]], [[Arlington, Washington|Arlington]], [[Chehalis, Washington|Chehalis]], and [[Sedro-Wooley, Washington|Sedro-Wooley]].&lt;ref name="Emerson" /&gt; This first foray into [[craft unionism]] proved to be short-lived, however, as an ill-timed strike crushed by an economic downturn in 1893 effectively put an end to the organizing effort.&lt;ref name="Emerson" /&gt;

In 1901 a more successful attempt at unionization of the shingle makers' trade was made with the establishment of the [[International Shingle Weavers of America]].

In January 1903 a newspaper called ''The Shingle Weaver'' was established in Ballard as the official journal of the new union. The paper later moved to [[Everett, Washington]] and finally to [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] during the course of its decade of publication before changing its name to ''The Timber Worker'' in February 1913.&lt;ref&gt;A few surviving copies of ''The Shingle Weaver'' (1903-1913) are available on microfilm from the [[University of Washington]] in Seattle and the [[University of Illinois]] in [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]]. For a bibliographic record, see http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn90099723/holdings/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, a wage cut for shingle weavers in the mills of Everett, Washington began a process of events which led to a strike the following year by the radical union the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] and its suppression by force and violence. On November 5, 1916, events culminated in a pitched gun battle known to history as the "[[Everett massacre]]," in which 5 strikers and 2 so-called "citizen deputies" were killed and approximately 45 others wounded.

The '''slug''' is a derived unit of [[mass]] in the weight-based [[Units of measurement|system of measures]], most notably within the British [[Imperial units|Imperial measurement system]] and in the United States [[United States customary units|customary measures system]]. Systems of measure either define mass and derive force or define a base force and derive a mass unit.&lt;ref&gt;See Elementary High School physics and chemistry text books/fundamentals.&lt;/ref&gt;  A slug is defined as the mass that is accelerated by 1&amp;nbsp;ft/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; when a force of one [[pound (force)|pound]] (lbf) is exerted on it.

:&lt;math&gt;
  1\,\text{slug} = 1\,\frac{\text{lbf}{\cdot}\text{s}^2}{\text{ft}}
  \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
  1\,\text{lbf} = 1\,\frac{\text{slug}{\cdot}\text{ft}}{\text{s}^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

One slug has a mass of {{convert|14.59390|kg|lb|order=flip|lk=on|abbr=on}} based on [[standard gravity]], the [[Foot (unit)#International foot|international foot]], and the [[Pound (mass)#Avoirdupois pound|avoirdupois pound]].&lt;ref name=Shigley&gt;Shigley, Joseph E. and Mischke, Charles R.

== History ==
The ''slug'' is part of a subset of units known as the [[Foot–pound–second system#Variants|gravitational FPS system]], one of several such specialized systems of mechanical units developed in the late 19th and the 20th century.  ''Geepound'' was another name for this unit in early literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unit2unit.eu/lb_gee.html gee]. unit2unit.eu&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "slug" was coined before 1900 by British physicist [[Arthur Mason Worthington]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Worthington, Arthur Mason |title= Dynamics of Rotation: An Elementary Introduction to Rigid Dynamics |publisher= Longmans, Green, and Co. |year= 1900 |edition= 3rd |page= 9 |url= https://archive.org/stream/dynamicsofrotati00wortuoft#page/8/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it did not see any significant use until decades later.  A 1928 textbook says:
{{quote|text=No name has yet been given to the unit of mass and, in fact, as we have developed the theory of dynamics no name is necessary.  Whenever the mass, ''m'', appears in our formulae, we substitute the ratio of the convenient force-acceleration pair ''(w/g)'', and measure the mass in lbs. per ft./sec.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or in grams per cm./sec.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.|author=Noel Charlton Little, ''College Physics'', Charles Scribner's Sons, 1928, p. 165.}}

The slug is listed in the Regulations under the Weights and Measures (National Standards) Act, 1960.  This regulation defines the units of weights and measures, both regular and metric, in Australia.

The '''specific weight''' (also known as the '''unit weight''') is the [[weight]] per unit [[volume]] of a material.  The symbol of specific weight is '''γ''' (the Greek letter [[Gamma]]).

A commonly used value is the specific weight of [[water]] on [[Earth]] at 4°C which is 9.807 kN/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or 62.43 [[Pound (force)|lbf]]/ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;ref name="FE"&gt; National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (2005). Fundamentals of Engineering Supplied-Reference Handbook (7th ed.). Clemson: National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying. {{ISBN|1-932613-00-5}}
 &lt;/ref&gt;

The terms ''[[specific gravity]]'', and less often ''specific weight'', are also used for [[relative density]].

==General formula==

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \rho \, g&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the specific weight of the material ([[weight]] per unit [[volume]], typically N/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; units)
:&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the [[density]] of the material ([[mass]] per unit volume, typically kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is [[standard gravity|acceleration due to gravity]] (rate of change of [[velocity]], given in m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and on Earth usually given as 9.81 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)

==Changes of specific weight==
Unlike density, specific weight is not [[wikt:absolute|absolute]].  It depends upon the value of the [[gravitational acceleration]], which varies with location.  A significant influence upon the value of specific gravity is the [[temperature ]] of the material.  [[Pressure]] may also affect values, depending upon the [[bulk modulus]] of the material, but generally, at moderate pressures, has a less significant effect than the other factors. &lt;ref name="fluids" /&gt;

==Uses==

===Fluid mechanics===

In [[fluid mechanics]], specific weight represents the [[force]] exerted by [[gravity]] on a unit volume of a fluid.  For this reason, units are expressed as force per unit volume (e.g., N/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or lb/ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).  Specific weight can be used as a characteristic [[List of materials properties|property]] of a fluid. &lt;ref name="fluids" /&gt;

===Soil mechanics===

Specific weight is often used as a property of soil to solve [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthwork]] problems.

In soil mechanics, specific weight may refer to:
*'''Moist unit weight''', which is the unit weight of a soil when void spaces of the soil contain both water and air.

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \frac{(1+w)G_s\gamma_w}{1+e}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the moist unit weight of the material 
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_w&lt;/math&gt; is the unit weight of water
:w is the [[moisture content]] of the material 
:Gs is the [[specific gravity]] of the solid
:e is the [[void ratio]]

*'''Dry unit weight''', which is the unit weight of a soil when all void spaces of the soil are completely filled with air, with no water.
The formula for dry unit weight is:
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_d = \frac{G_s\gamma_w}{1+e} = \frac{\gamma}{1+w}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the moist unit weight of the material 
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_d&lt;/math&gt; is the dry unit weight of the material 
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_w&lt;/math&gt; is the unit weight of water
:w is the [[moisture content]] of the material 
:Gs is the [[specific gravity]] of the solid
:e is the [[void ratio]]

*'''Saturated unit weight''', which is the unit weight of a soil when all void spaces of the soil are completely filled with water, with no air.

The formula for saturated unit weight is:
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_s = \frac{(G_s+e)\gamma_w}{1+e}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_s&lt;/math&gt; is the saturated unit weight of the material 
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_w&lt;/math&gt; is the unit weight of water
:w is the [[moisture content]] of the material 
:Gs is the [[specific gravity]] of the solid
:e is the [[void ratio]]&lt;ref name="soils"&gt;Das, Braja M. (2007). ''Principles of Geotechnical Engineering''. Canada: Chris Carson.  {{ISBN|0-495-07316-4}}. &lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Submerged unit weight''', which is defined as the difference between the saturated unit weight and the unit weight of water. &lt;ref name="Intelligent Compaction"&gt; The Transtec Group, Inc. (2012). ''Basic Definitions and Terminology of Soils''. http://www.intelligentcompaction.com/downloads/IC_RelatedDocs/SoilCmpct_Basic%20definitions%20of%20Soils.pdf (Page viewed December 7, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt; It is often used in the calculation of the [[effective stress]] in a soil. 

The formula for submerged unit weight is:
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma^{'} = \gamma_s - \gamma_w&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma^{'}&lt;/math&gt; is the submerged unit weight of the material
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_s&lt;/math&gt; is the saturated unit weight of the material 
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_w&lt;/math&gt; is the unit weight of water

===Civil and mechanical engineering===

Specific weight can be used in [[civil engineering]] and [[mechanical engineering]] to determine the weight of a structure designed to carry certain loads while remaining intact and remaining within limits regarding [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]].

Several tetraquark candidates have been reported by particle physics experiments in the 21st century. The quark contents of these states are almost all q{{overline|q}}Q{{overline|Q}}, where q represents a light ([[up quark|up]], [[down quark|down]] or [[strange quark|strange]]) quark, Q represents a heavy ([[charm quark|charm]] or [[bottom quark|bottom]]) quark, and antiquarks are denoted with an overline. The existence and stability of tetraquark states with the qq{{overline|Q}}{{overline|Q}} (or {{overline|q}}{{overline|q}}QQ) have been discussed by theoretical physicists for a long time, however these have not been yet reported by experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Si-Qiang|first1=Luo|last2=Kan|first2=Chen|last3=Xiang|first3=Liu|last4=Yan-Rui|first4=Liu|last5=Shi-Lin|first5=Zhu|title=Exotic tetraquark states with the ''qq{{overline|Q}}{{overline|Q}}'' configuration|journal=European Physical Journal C|date=25 October 2017|volume=77:709|issue=10|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1140%2Fepjc%2Fs10052-017-5297-4.pdf|accessdate=26 November 2017|doi=10.1140/epjc/s10052-017-5297-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8513">A '''Virtual Valve Amplifier (VVA)''' is software algorithm designed and sold by Diamond Cut Productions, Inc. for simulating the sound of various [[valve amplifier]] designs.  It can be found within their DC8 and Forensics8 software programs.

A VVA can be used to color the sound of a digital recording by adding "tube-warmth" or "fat-bass" in addition to adding subtle harmonics to enhance very old or muffled recordings.  The algorithms behind a VVA are based on real [[vacuum tube]] [[Electronic circuit|circuit]]s and [[Linearity|non-linearities]], mathematically simulating the large-signal transfer functions of various vacuum tubes and [[output transformer]]s found in amplifier designs. A majority of this data was originally derived from extensive bench measurements on real vacuum tube amplifier circuits under varying operating conditions by engineers Craig Maier and Rick Carlson in the early 1990s.  A VVA is a direct mathematical reconstruction of the same signal passing through a physical electron tube amplifier.  The VVA algorithm can be found in the Diamond Cut DC8 and DC Forensics8 software packages.  It is also sold as a VST plug-in.

==Basic operating parameters==
VVA designs generally include a number of parameters that may be configured to change the sound and operating characteristics of the amplifier design:

===Operating point===
Historically referred to as the "Q" or bias point by engineers, the operating point of a vacuum tube is a condition generally fixed by the amplifier manufacturer. In general, the operating point determines the device's bias value at zero signal input and determines the distribution of harmonics introduced into the output of the amplifier.  Tubes that operate with a higher operating point close to cutoff give more "headroom", enabling greater volume gains to be applied before signal degradation in the form of "breakup" or saturation results. By contrast, a lower operating point introduces more harmonic distortion into the final output as a result of the different non-linearity distribution near cut-off as compared to operation in the nominally linear portion of the characteristic.  Some [[guitar amplifier]]s are designed to produce this type of distortion as its sound effect is considered desirable.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tubedepot.com/whisbipo.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ampbooks.com/home/amp-technology/vacuum-tube-definitions/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drive===
This describes how loudly the "physical" equivalent of the virtual valve amplifier is set.  However, the output level of a VVA generally remains constant independent of drive due to internal gain compensation algorithms.  Instead, the drive determines the amount of distortion that can be introduced into the output signal.  As such, the Drive of a VVA describes the degree of modulation applied to a given vacuum tube amplifier circuit centered about the set operating point.  The higher the drive level setting, the greater will be the production of predominantly even order harmonics due to the circuit's asymmetrical non-linearity.  As a result, the VVA "effect" increases with increasing drive.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tubedepot.com/whisbipo.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ampbooks.com/home/amp-technology/vacuum-tube-definitions/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common vacuum tube types==

===Triode 12AX7/ECC83===
This is a high-mu dual [[triode]] that is generally incorporated into an RC coupled class A audio pre-amplifier configuration and its design is optimized to minimize [[harmonic distortion]].  This vacuum tube is still the industry standard pre-amplifier valve.  It has a relatively flat linear operating region in the middle of its dynamic operating range, producing relatively lower levels of distortion compared to some of the other devices listed here.  But, by moving the Operating Point to either the saturation or cutoff extreme, more "tube-warmth" effect can be produced by this device. Some VST effects emulate this tube.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xeniumaudio.com/downloads.php#XTube&lt;/ref&gt;

===Triode 12AT7/ECC81===
The 12AT7 high-mu dual triode was designed primarily for RF mixing applications where it was incorporated into the oscillator/mixer stage and used to heterodyne incoming RF signals with the local oscillator to create an intermediate frequency in TV and FM sets. Thus, it is intentionally designed to be extremely non-linear.   Thus, circuits based around the 12AT7 exhibit a larger degree of non-linearity throughout the entire dynamic operating range, including the middle.  As a result, it produces greater even-order harmonic distortion (less objectionable than odd-order distortion).

===Triode 12AU7/ECC82===
The 12AU7 is a medium-mu dual triode often found in the driver / phase inverter stage of a push-pull power amplifier and also results in significant non-linearity in the middle of its dynamic operating curve.

===Pentode 6EJ7===
The 6EJ7 [[pentode]] and its equivalents are often found in high-gain vacuum tube microphone amplifiers which require the sharp cutoff of a pentode.  It generally produces a very pleasant "tube-warmth" effect when the operating point is properly set.  This device is the same as the European type EF183.

===Pentode 6267/EF86 ===
The 6267 / EF86 pentode was a vacuum tube well suited for use in low-level pre-amplifiers where low noise and minimal [[microphonics]] were important.  Its high-gain characteristics and family of operating curves make for useful harmonic distortion and signal compression properties{{Clarify|date=May 2013}}.

==Common vacuum tube amplifier types==
Circuits may be "single-ended", using a single output device (or several connected in parallel), or "[[Push-pull output|push-pull]]", using paired devices configured to cancel out even-order distortion products and reduce output transformer magnetisation. [[Grid bias|Bias]] of a push-pull amplifier may be set to make both sides conduct at all times ([[amplifier class]] A), to make only one side conduct at a time (class B), or intermediate (class AB). Class A uses more power for the same output (i.e., is less efficient), can produce less output power from the same devices, and produces lower distortion, than classes AB and B.

=== 2-Stage Class A===
These devices generally consisted of a 12AU7 medium-mu triode driving a single 6L6GC beam power pentode audio output valve or similar.  Its effects are distinctive due to convolution of the non-linearity of the triode interacting with those of the pentode, with both devices operating in class-A mode.  The 6L6GC is similar in performance to the industrial type 5881, and also the European type KT66.

===2-Stage Class AB===
Often consisting of a 12AU7 phase inverter / driver, pushing a pair of 6L6GC beam power pentodes.  The symmetrical  push-pull circuit cancels out and reduces even-order distortion products compared with a single-ended circuit.  The operating point is hard-wired and cannot be adjusted.

===2A3 push-pull===
Also known as a "retro–triode" amplifier, it was invented in the 1930s and incorporated a directly heated cathode resulting in a high power output. It was often used in theatrical applications and public address systems. This vacuum amplifier typically exhibits a more linear output transfer characteristic than its pentode push-pull counterpart and as a result produces a characteristic clean sound.  The particular devices used to create the 2A3 VVA models were of the "dual–plate" variety taken from unused stock manufactured for the military by RCA Victor in 1953.  This configuration is favoured by many jazz musicians including [[Les paul|Les Paul]] who reportedly used this amplifier configuration to cut all the records made from his home studio.&lt;ref&gt;DC 7.5 &amp; DC 7 User's Manual&lt;/ref&gt;

===2A3 single-ended===
This is a single ended class A vacuum tube power amplifier implemented using the 2A3 power triode.  It exhibits reasonably good linearity with dominant even distortion products.

===Vacuum tube exciter===
{{Unreferenced|section|date=May 2013|reason=Unreferenced and unclear}}
Because of the non-linear properties and distortion products of vacuum tubes and their associated amplification circuits, they are useful in the simulation of a vacuum tube rectifier (6X4) to produce harmonics. Asymmetry between the positive- and negative-going transfer function establishes the relationship between the degree of even and odd harmonics produced.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond Cut DC8 Users Guide&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Yellow River oil spill''' was an [[oil spill]] in the [[Yellow River]] in [[Shaanxi]], [[China]] which took place due to the rupturing of a segment of [[Lanzhou-Zhengzhou oil pipeline]] on December 30, 2009. Approximately {{convert|150000|l|usgal|abbr=on}} of [[diesel oil]] flowed down the [[Wei River]] before finally reaching the Yellow River, the source of drinking water for millions of people, on January 4, 2010.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8438362.stm|title=China water warning as oil spill hits Yellow River |date=4 January 2010| work=BBC News |accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TIME"&gt;{{cite news | author=Jessie Jiang |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1951412,00.html?xid=rss-topstories|title=After Oil Spill, China's Polluted Rivers in Spotlight|date=4 January 2010| work=Time |accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Lanzhou-Zhengzhou oil pipeline project was approved in 2007 and opened for operation in March 2009. It is a part of the {{convert|2070|km|abbr=on}}-long [[Lanzhou-Zhengzhou-Changsha pipeline]] with a capacity of transporting 15 million tons of oil per year.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idINPEK17778220090331|title=China Lanzhou-Zhengzhou oil pipeline in operation|date=March 31, 2009| work=Reuters|accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[China National Petroleum Corporation]] (CNPC), the rupture took place on December 30, 2009 due to an accident near [[Weinan]] where construction was underway by third-party workers.&lt;ref name="TIME" /&gt; However, the incident was not publicized until January 3, 2010.&lt;ref name="tg"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jan/04/oil-spill-china-yellow-river|title=Chinese environment officials fail to stop oil slick from polluting Yellow river|last=Watts|first=Jonathan|date=4 January 2010| work=The Guardian|accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deputy director of the [[Yellow River Water Resources Commission]] called for an investigation into the accident, refuting CNPC's claim that the accident was caused by third-party construction workers.&lt;ref name="Xinhua"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2010-01/05/content_12759672.htm|title=Spill spread may affect drinking water supply |date=5 January 2010| work=Xinhua News |accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spill control efforts==
