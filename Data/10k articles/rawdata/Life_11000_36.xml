      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3705">'''Abraham Kohn''' (June 13, 1806&lt;ref&gt;''[http://sammlungen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/cm/periodical/pageview/3244483 Abraham Kohn]'', [[Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums]]&lt;br&gt; 20 October 1856, p. 580. Date given according to Hebrew calendar, 27 [[Sivan]].&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Zalužany]], [[Bohemia]] &amp;ndash; September 7, 1848 at [[Lemberg, Galicia]]) was the liberal Chief [[Rabbi]] of Lemberg, and was poisoned to death.

In 1828, he entered the [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]], where he applied himself to philosophy, while devoting his spare time to rabbinical studies. In July, 1833, he was appointed rabbi of [[Hohenems, Vorarlberg]], where he remained for eleven years. Besides organizing various charitable societies, he greatly improved the educational facilities for the young, and introduced many reforms into the public service. In May, 1844, he accepted the rabbinate of Lemberg. Here in a comparatively short time he opened a well-equipped "Normalschule" of which he was the superintendent, dedicated a new reform temple, abolished many old abuses, and did not rest until the degrading tax on [[kosher]] meat and [[Sabbath candles]], imposed upon the [[Jewish]] community by the government, was removed.

In 1902 the Lviv/Lemberg  Jewish community commissioned a portrait of Abraham Kohn. The posthumous portrait was painted by a Lviv-based Jewish painter Wilhelm Wachtel (1875-1952).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://judaicaukrainica.ukma.edu.ua/volume2015/04|title=Anastasiia O. Simferovska.

==Death==
While the less traditional element rallied about him, the traditionalists of the community  bitterly protested changes to their religion. On September 6, 1848, Abraham Ber Pilpel, said to be hired by a fanatical clique, entered Kohn's kitchen and poisoned the family's dinner with [[arsenic]]. While the other members of his family recovered, Kohn and his youngest daughter (cf. "Reformed Judaism and its Pioneers" by E. Schreiber, where he writes that the only victim of the murder was Rabbi Kohn himself and the rest of the family recovered), died the following day. After Kohn died Pilpel stood trial for his murder and was convicted. However, on appeal this was overturned. After the verdict was overturned, it was again reviewed by the highest court and the appellate court's judgment was upheld.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="811">'''Adiva''' was the first wife of [[Boleslaus II of Bohemia]]. It has been speculated that she was the progeny of [[Edward the Elder]], [[King of England]], and his second wife Aelfflaed, but the evidence for this is weak. Favouring the conjecture is the similarity of her name to certain Anglo-Saxon forms, and the introduction of English-influenced coinage into [[Bohemia]]. Nevertheless, since there are a handful of other possible candidates, the evidence for the hypothesis must be counted insufficient.

She and Boleslaus had the following children:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3834">'''Alingga''' ({{zh|c=阿靈阿|p=Ēlíng'ē}}, [[Manchu language|Manchu]]: {{ManchuSibeUnicode|ᠠᠯᡳᠩᡤᠠ}}; ''c''.1670&amp;ndash;1716), of the [[Niohuru]] clan, was a Manchu noble of the [[Bordered Yellow Banner]]. An official at court during the late reign of the [[Kangxi Emperor]], Alingga played a major role in the succession struggle between the sons of the emperor. Born into a prominent imperial family as the son of [[Ebilun]], Alingga's sister was one of the Kangxi Emperor's highly ranked consorts, and his daughter married [[Yunli]], the Prince Guo.

==Biography==
Alingga's birthdate is unknown. He was the seventh son of [[Ebilun]], one of the main advisors to the [[Kangxi Emperor]] in the latter's early reign, Alingga grew up in a prominent household. He initially was an imperial bodyguard, then ''niru'' (佐領). Alingga became a top officer of the emperor's personal protection unit and the Manchu head of the Bordered Yellow Banner military force. His elder sister was the Wenxi Guifei (溫僖貴妃), a highly ranked imperial consort of the Kangxi Emperor. After the ''Guifei'' died, Alingga represented his family in mourning her.

Alingga did not get along with his older brother Faka (法喀) and frequently attempted to cast sorcery spells against him. Alingga had inherited the first-class duke title originally bestowed upon Faka after the death of their father. Faka complained about Alingga's behavior to the emperor. The emperor, incensed at Alingga, dismissed him from his posts but retained his noble title. He was later restored as a first-class bodyguard and a leader of the Plain Blue Banner Mongol forces. He later was named an officer of the imperial guard, and minister responsible for ''[[Lifan Yuan]]''. In 1708, the 47th year of Kangxi's reign, Alingga became one of the most vocal supporters of [[Yunsi]] for the position of crown prince, and was criticized by the emperor, as Yunsi was not in imperial favor. Alingga died in 1716, the 55th year of Kangxi's reign. His daughter became wife to [[Yunli]], the Prince Guo. He was also father of [[Arsungga]], a major official during the reign of the [[Yongzheng Emperor]].

The Yongzheng Emperor reserved particular scorn for Alingga, possibly as a result of the latter's endorsement of Yunsi during the battle for succession. In 1736, the Yongzheng Emperor said to his assembled officials, "in today's court, the most treacherous, most selfishly bent on seeking their own gain; the worst of them are Alingga and Kuiju".&lt;ref&gt;Kuiju (揆叙) was the son of [[Mingju]]&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor accused Alingga of spreading rumors in order to support the cause of Yunsi assuming the position of crown prince. Additionally, the emperor placed on Alingga's tombstone the remarks "he was not a good subject, not a good younger brother, violent, and mediocre."&lt;ref&gt;Original in Chinese: 令夺官，遣往奉天守其祖墓；并将阿灵阿墓碑改镌‘不臣不弟暴悍贪庸阿灵阿之墓’，以正其罪&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Alingga appeared as a character in numerous Chinese television series, including ''[[Yongzheng Dynasty]]'', ''[[Scarlet Heart]]'', and ''[[Palace II]]''. Contemporary understandings of Alingga are basically derived from two sources - the ''[[Draft History of Qing]]'', which features a short biography of him, and various edicts issued by the [[Yongzheng Emperor]], who despised him. It is therefore difficult to ascertain what kind of life he truly led or his personal character, as the Yongzheng Emperor's opinions is likely due to Alingga's allegiance to the emperor's political rivals.

      <comment>Beatrice Han-Pile in "Nietzsche and Amor Fati" (EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY) cites "for all its importance, there is very little material on amor fati in Nietzsche’s work. All in all, I was able to identify only seven passages, four in the published work, one in the Will to Power, one in the Nachlass and one in Nietzsche’s correspondence."</comment>

{{italic title}}
'''''Amor fati''''' ({{abbr|lit.|literally}} "love of fate") is a [[Latin]] phrase that may be translated as "love of fate" or "love of one's fate".  It is used to describe an attitude in which one sees everything that happens in one's life, including [[suffering]] and [[grief|loss]], as good or, at the very least, necessary, in that they are among the facts of one's life and existence, so they are always necessarily there whether one likes them or not. Moreover, ''amor fati'' is characterized by an acceptance of the events or situations that occur in one's life.&lt;ref name="ds"&gt;{{cite web|title=Amor Fati: The Formula for Human Greatness|url=https://dailystoic.com/amor-fati-love-of-fate/|publisher=Daily Stoic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This acceptance does not necessarily preclude an attempt at change or improvement, but rather, it can be seen to be along the lines of what [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] apparently means by the concept of "[[Eternal recurrence#Friedrich Nietzsche|eternal recurrence]]": a sense of contentment with one's life and an acceptance of it, such that one could live exactly the same life, in all its minute details, over and over for all eternity.

==Concept==
The concept of ''amor fati'' has been linked to [[Epictetus]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Enchiridion of Epictetus]]'' Ch. VIII: "Do not seek for things to happen the way you want them to; rather, wish that what happens happen the way it happens: then you will be happy."—as quoted in [[Pierre Hadot]] (1998), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3dLVyyDE-vQC&amp;redir_esc=y The Inner Citadel: The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius]'', p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been linked to [[Meditations|the writings]] of [[Marcus Aurelius]],&lt;ref&gt;''Meditations'' IV.23: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"All that is in accord with you is in accord with me, O World! Nothing which occurs at the right time for you comes too soon or too late for me. All that your seasons produce, O Nature, is fruit for me. It is from you that all things come: all things are within you, and all things move toward you." — as quoted in [[Hadot]] (1998), p. 143.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  who did not himself use the words (he wrote in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], not Latin).&lt;ref name="rg"&gt;{{cite web|title=An Interview with the Master: Robert Greene on Stoicism|url=https://dailystoic.com/robert-greene-interview/|publisher=Daily Stoic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase is used in a few of Nietzsche's writings and is representative of the general outlook on life that he articulates in section 276 of ''[[The Gay Science]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;I want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in things; then I shall be one of those who makes things beautiful. ''Amor fati'': let that be my love henceforth! I do not want to wage war against what is ugly. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse those who accuse. ''Looking away'' shall be my only negation. And all in all and on the whole: some day I wish to be only a Yes-sayer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It is important to note that Nietzsche in this context refers to the "Yes-sayer", not in a political or social sense, but as a person who is capable of uncompromising acceptance of reality ''per se''.

Quotation from "Why I Am So Clever" in ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'', section 10:&lt;ref&gt;''Basic Writings of Nietzsche''. trans. and ed. by Walter Kaufmann (1967), p. 714.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;My formula for greatness in a human being is ''amor fati'': that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity.  Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it&amp;mdash;all idealism is mendacity in the face of what is necessary&amp;mdash;but ''love'' it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Furthermore, Nietzsche's spirit of acceptance occurs in the context of his radical embrace of suffering.  For to love that which is necessary, demands not only that we love the bad along with the good, but that we view the two as inextricably linked.  In section 3 of the preface of ''[[The Gay Science]]'', he writes:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/nietzsche-moral-political/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Leiter|first=Brian|date=2015-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Only great pain is the ultimate liberator of the spirit….I doubt that such pain makes us ‘better’; but I know that it makes us more profound.    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Anaxagoras''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|n|æ|k|ˈ|s|æ|g|ə|r|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἀναξαγόρας}}, ''Anaxagoras'', "lord of the assembly"; {{circa|510|428}}&amp;nbsp;BC) was a [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Pre-Socratic]] [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]]. Born in [[Clazomenae]] at a time when [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] was under the control of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], Anaxagoras came to [[Athens]]. According to [[Diogenes Laertius]] and [[Plutarch]], in later life he was charged with [[impiety]] and went into exile in [[Lampsacus]]; the charges may have been political, owing to his association with [[Pericles]], if they were not fabricated by later ancient biographers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Filonik|first=Jakub|date=2013|title=Athenian impiety trials: a reappraisal|journal=Dike|issue=16|pages=26–33|doi=10.13130/1128-8221/4290|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to the claims of [[Parmenides]] on the impossibility of change, Anaxagoras described the world as a mixture of primary imperishable ingredients, where material variation was never caused by an absolute presence of a particular ingredient, but rather by its relative preponderance over the other ingredients; in his words, "each one is... most manifestly those things of which there are the most in it".&lt;ref name=Curd&gt;{{cite book |author=Anaxagoras |editor1-last=Curd|editor1-first=Patricia|title=A Presocratics Reader|publisher=Hackett|isbn=978-1-60384-305-8|chapter=Anaxagoras of Clazomenae|quote=B12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced the concept of ''[[Nous]]'' ([[Cosmos|Cosmic]] Mind) as an ordering force, which moved and separated out the original mixture, which was [[homogeneous]], or nearly so.

He also gave a number of novel scientific accounts of natural phenomena. He produced a correct explanation for [[eclipse]]s and described the sun as a fiery mass larger than the [[Peloponnese]], as well as attempting to explain [[rainbows]] and [[meteors]].

==Biography==
Anaxagoras is believed to have enjoyed some wealth and political influence in his native town of [[Clazomenae]]. However, he supposedly surrendered this out of a fear that they would hinder his search for knowledge.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Anaxagoras|volume=1|page=943|first=William|last=Wallace|authorlink=William Wallace (philosopher)|first2=John Malcolm|last2=Mitchell}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman author [[Valerius Maximus]] preserves a different tradition: Anaxagoras, coming home from a long voyage, found his property in ruin, and said: "If this had not perished, I would have"—a sentence described by Valerius as being "possessed of sought-after wisdom!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anaxagoras of Clazomenae: Fragments and Testimonia : a text and translation with notes and essays |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2007 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PA6HMrSrjfkC&amp;pg=PA90 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Val. Max., VIII, 7, ext., 5: ''Qui, cum e diutina peregrinatione patriam repetisset possessionesque desertas vidisset, "non essem - inquit "ego salvus, nisi istae perissent." Vocem petitae sapientiae compotem!''&lt;/ref&gt;

Anaxagoras was a Greek citizen of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] and had served in the Persian army; he may have been a member of the Persian regiments that entered mainland Greece during the [[Greco-Persian Wars]].{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=66}} Though this remains uncertain, "it would certainly explain why he came to [[Athens]] in the year of [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]], 480/79 B.C."{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=66}} Anaxagoras is said to have remained in Athens for thirty years. [[Pericles]] learned to love and admire him, and the poet [[Euripides]] derived from him an enthusiasm for science and humanity.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; 

Anaxagoras brought philosophy and the spirit of scientific inquiry from [[Ionia]] to Athens.  His observations of the celestial bodies and the fall of [[meteorite]]s led him to form new theories of the universal order, and to a putative prediction of the impact of a [[Aegospotami|meteorite in 467]].&lt;ref&gt;Couprie, Dirk L. "How Thales Was Able to" Predict" a Solar Eclipse Without the Help of Alleged Mesopotamian Wisdom." Early Science and Medicine 9.4 (2004): 321-337&lt;/ref&gt; He attempted to give a scientific account of [[eclipse]]s, [[meteor]]s, [[rainbow]]s, and the [[sun]], which he described as a mass of blazing metal, larger than the [[Peloponnese]]. The heavenly bodies, he asserted, were masses of stone torn from the earth and ignited by rapid rotation.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; He was the first to give a correct explanation of eclipses, and was both famous and notorious for his scientific theories, including the claims that the sun is a mass of red-hot metal, that the moon is earthy, and that the stars are fiery stones.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/anaxagoras/ Anaxagoras biography]&lt;/ref&gt; He thought the earth was flat and floated supported by 'strong' air under it and disturbances in this air sometimes caused earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;Burnet J. (1892) ''Early Greek Philosophy'' A. &amp; C. Black, London, {{OCLC|4365382}}, and subsequent editions, 2003 edition published by Kessinger, Whitefish, Montana, {{ISBN|0-7661-2826-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These speculations made him vulnerable in Athens to a charge of impiety. [[Diogenes Laertius]] reports the story that he was prosecuted by Cleon for impiety, but Plutarch says that Pericles sent his former tutor, Anaxagoras, to Lampsacus for his own safety after the Athenians began to blame him for the [[Peloponnesian war]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/pericles.1b.txt Plutarch, ''Pericles'']&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Laertius, Pericles spoke in defense of Anaxagoras at his trial, {{circa|450|lk=no}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = A.E. | year = 1917 | title = On the date of the trial of Anaxagoras | url = | journal = Classical Quarterly | volume = 11| pages = 81–87 | doi=10.1017/s0009838800013094}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, Anaxagoras was forced to retire from Athens to [[Lampsacus]] in [[Troad]] ({{circa|434}}{{snd}}433). He died there in around the year 428. Citizens of Lampsacus erected an altar to Mind and Truth in his memory, and observed the anniversary of his death for many years.

Anaxagoras wrote a book of philosophy, but only fragments of the first part of this have survived, through preservation in work of [[Simplicius of Cilicia]] in the 6th century AD.

==Philosophy==
[[Image:Anaxagoras Nuremberg Chronicle.jpg|right|thumb|Anaxagoras, depicted as a medieval scholar in the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'']]
According to Anaxagoras all things have existed in some way from the beginning, but originally they existed in infinitesimally small fragments of themselves, endless in number and inextricably combined throughout the universe. All things existed in this mass, but in a confused and indistinguishable form.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; There was an infinite number of homogeneous parts ({{lang|el|ὁμοιομερῆ}}) as well as heterogeneous ones.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;
{{Cite DGRBM |last=Schmitz |first=Leonhard |title=Anaxagoras|volume=1|page=|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DA%3Aentry+group%3D21%3Aentry%3Danaxagoras-bio-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of arrangement, the segregation of like from unlike and the summation of the whole into totals of the same name, was the work of [[Nous|Mind or Reason]] ({{lang|el|νοῦς}}). Mind is no less unlimited than the chaotic mass, but it stood pure and independent, a thing of finer texture, alike in all its manifestations and everywhere the same. This subtle agent, possessed of all knowledge and power, is especially seen ruling in all the forms of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Diels|editor1-first=Hermann|title=Die fragmente der Vorsokratiker griechisch und deutsch|quote=B12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first appearance, and the only manifestation of it which Anaxagoras describes, is Motion. It gave distinctness and reality to the aggregates of like parts.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Decease and growth represent a new aggregation ({{lang|el|σὐγκρισις}}) and disruption ({{lang|el|διάκρισις}}). However, the original intermixture of things is never wholly overcome.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Each thing contains in itself parts of other things or heterogeneous elements, and is what it is, only on account of the preponderance of certain homogeneous parts which constitute its character.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt; Out of this process arise the things we see in this world.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;

==Literary references==
Anaxagoras is mentioned by [[Socrates]] during his trial in [[Plato]]'s "[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]".  In the [[Phaedo]], Plato portrays Socrates saying of Anaxagoras that as a young man: 'I eagerly acquired his books and read them as quickly as I could' &lt;ref&gt;Plato, Phaedo, 85b&lt;/ref&gt;.

In a quote chosen to begin [[Nathanael West]]'s first book "[[The Dream Life of Balso Snell]]", [[Marcel Proust]]'s character Bergotte says, "After all, my dear fellow, life, Anaxagoras has said, is a journey."

Anaxagoras appears as a character in ''[[Faust, Part Two|Faust, Part II]]'' by [[Goethe|Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].

Anaxagoras appears as a character in ''The Ionia Sanction'', by [[Gary Corby]].

Anaxagoras is referred to and admired by Cyrus Spitama, the hero and narrator of ''[[Creation (novel)|Creation]]'', by [[Gore Vidal]]. The book contains this passage, explaining how Anaxagoras became influential:

:[According to Anaxagoras] One of the largest things is a hot stone that we call the sun. When Anaxagoras was very young, he predicted that sooner or later a piece of the sun would break off and fall to earth. Twenty years ago, he was proved right. The whole world saw a fragment of the sun fall in a fiery arc through the sky, landing near [[Aegospotami]] in Thrace. When the fiery fragment cooled, it proved to be nothing more than a chunk of brown rock. Overnight Anaxagoras was famous. Today his book is read everywhere. You can buy a secondhand copy in the Agora for a drachma.&lt;ref&gt;Vidal, Gore, ''Creation: restored edition'', chapter 2, Vintage Books (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William H. Gass]] begins his novel, ''The Tunnel'' (1995), with a quote from Anaxagoras: "The descent to hell is the same from every place."

He is also mentioned in Seneca's Natural Questions (Book 4B, originally Book 3: On Clouds, Hail, Snow) It reads: "Why should I too allow myself the same liberty as Anaxagoras allowed himself?"

[[Dante Alighieri]] places Anaxagoras in the First Circle of Hell (Limbo) in his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' (''[[Inferno_(Dante)|Inferno]]'', Canto IV, line 118).

'''Apolysis''' ({{lang-grc|ἀπόλυσις}} "discharge, lit. absolution") is the separation of the [[cuticle]] from the [[Epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]] in [[arthropod]]s and related groups ([[Ecdysozoa]]). Since the cuticle of these animals is also the skeletal support of the body and is inelastic, it is shed during growth and a new covering of larger dimensions is formed. During this process, an arthropod becomes dormant for a period of time. [[Enzyme]]s are secreted to digest the inner layers of the existing cuticle, detaching the animal from the outer cuticle. This allows the new cuticle to develop without being exposed to the environmental elements.&lt;ref name="McGavin 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=McGavin|first=George C|title=Essential Entomology: An Order-by-Order Introduction|year=2001|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|isbn=9780198500025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Triplehorn 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Triplehorn|first=Charles A|title=Borror and DeLong's introduction to the study of insects.|year=2005|publisher=Thomson, Brooks/Cole|location=Australia|isbn=9780030968358|edition=7th|author2=Johnson, Norman F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jurenka&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jurenka, Russell |title=Insect Physiology |journal=Physiology and Maintenance |url=http://www.eolss.net/sample-chapters/c03/E5-25-53-00.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After apolysis, [[ecdysis]] occurs. Ecdysis is the actual emergence of the arthropod into the environment and always occurs directly after apolysis. The newly emerged animal then hardens and continues its life.

'''Backpropagation through time''' (BPTT) is a [[gradient]]-based technique for training certain types of [[recurrent neural network]]s. It can be used to train [[Recurrent neural network#Elman networks and Jordan networks|Elman networks]]. The algorithm was independently derived by numerous researchers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243781476|chapter=A Focused Backpropagation Algorithm for Temporal Pattern Recognition|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-08-21

==Algorithm==
[[Image:Unfold through time.png|right|thump|500px|BPTT unfolds a recurrent neural network through time.]]

The training data for a recurrent neural network is an ordered sequence of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; input-output pairs, &lt;math&gt;\langle \mathbf{a}_0,\mathbf{y}_0 \rangle, \langle\mathbf{a}_1,\mathbf{y}_1 \rangle,\langle\mathbf{a}_2,\mathbf{y}_2\rangle,...,\langle\mathbf{a}_{k-1},\mathbf{y}_{k-1}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. An initial value must be specified for the hidden state &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_0&lt;/math&gt;. Typically, a vector of all zeros is used for this purpose.

BPTT begins by unfolding a recurrent neural network in time. The unfolded network contains &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; inputs and outputs, but every copy of the network shares the same parameters. Then the [[backpropagation]] algorithm is used to find the gradient of the cost with respect to all the network parameters.

Consider an example of a neural network that contains a [[recurrent neural network|recurrent]] layer &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and a [[feedforward neural network|feedforward]] layer &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. There are different ways to define the training cost, but the total cost is always the average of the costs of each of the time steps. The cost of each time step can be computed separately. The figure above shows how the cost at time &lt;math&gt;t + 3&lt;/math&gt; can be computed, by unfolding the recurrent layer &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; for three time steps and adding the feedforward layer &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. Each instance of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in the unfolded network shares the same parameters. Thus the weight updates in each instance (&lt;math&gt;f_1, f_2, f_3&lt;/math&gt;) are summed together.

==Pseudo-code==
Pseudo-code for a truncated version of BPTT, where the training data contains &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; input-output pairs, but the network is unfolded for &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; time steps:

&lt;pre&gt;
Back_Propagation_Through_Time(a, y)   // a[t] is the input at time t. y[t] is the output
    Unfold the network to contain k instances of f
    do until stopping criteria is met:
        x = the zero-magnitude vector;// x is the current context
        for t from 0 to n - k         // t is time. n is the length of the training sequence
            Set the network inputs to x, a[t], a[t+1], ..., a[t+k-1]
            p = forward-propagate the inputs over the whole unfolded network
            e = y[t+k] - p;           // error = target - prediction
            Back-propagate the error, e, back across the whole unfolded network
            Sum the weight changes in the k instances of f together.
            Update all the weights in f and g.
            x = f(x, a[t]);           // compute the context for the next time-step
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Advantages==
BPTT tends to be significantly faster for training recurrent neural networks than general-purpose optimization techniques such as [[evolutionary programming|evolutionary]] optimization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sjöberg|first=Jonas|last2=Zhang|first2=Qinghua|last3=Ljung|first3=Lennart|last4=Benveniste|first4=Albert|last5=Delyon|first5=Bernard|last6=Glorennec|first6=Pierre-Yves|last7=Hjalmarsson|first7=Håkan|last8=Juditsky|first8=Anatoli|title=Nonlinear black-box modeling in system identification: a unified overview|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0005109895001208|journal=Automatica|volume=31|issue=12|pages=1691–1724|doi=10.1016/0005-1098(95)00120-8|year=1995|citeseerx=10.1.1.27.81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==
BPTT has difficulty with local optima. With recurrent neural networks, local optima are a much more significant problem than with feed-forward neural networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The recurrent feedback in such networks tends to create chaotic responses in the error surface which cause local optima to occur frequently, and in poor locations on the error surface.

[[Image:Moorman photo of JFK assassination.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.3|The [[Mary Moorman|Moorman photograph]] (detail) showing the fatal shot; "Badge Man" is reputedly located behind the stockade fence at photo center]]
'''Badge Man''' is a name given to an unknown figure that is reputedly visible within the famous [[Mary Moorman|Mary Moorman photograph]] of the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy]]. Some researchers have theorized that this figure is a sniper firing a weapon at the President from the [[grassy knoll]] in [[Dealey Plaza]]. Even though an alleged [[muzzle flash]] obscures much of the detail, the "Badge Man" has been described as a person wearing some kind of police uniform – the moniker itself derives from a bright spot on the chest, which is said to resemble a gleaming [[badge]].

Speculation about the "Badge Man" figure helped create [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories]] regarding a plot made by members of the [[Dallas Police Department]] to kill President Kennedy. In response, abundant skeptics proposed numerous alternative interpretations of the image.

==The Moorman photograph==
During the Presidential motorcade through [[Dealey Plaza]], Dallas resident [[Mary Moorman]] took a series of photographs with her [[Instant camera|Polaroid camera]]. Her nonprofessional photos captured images of all of the [[SS-100-X|presidential limousine]] occupants, several other close witnesses (including [[Abraham Zapruder]] filming), two Dallas police motorcycle Presidential escorts, and much of the Plaza's [[grassy knoll]]. The "Badge Man" is reputedly visible in Moorman's fifth and most famous photo of the area, taken at the moment of the head shot that killed the President. This photo has been calculated to have been captured between [[Zapruder film]] frames 315 and 316, which was less than one-sixth of a second after President Kennedy was fatally shot in the head at frame 313.&lt;ref name=RH885&gt;{{Cite book |title=Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy |last=Bugliosi |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Bugliosi |year=2007 |publisher=W.W. Norton |location=New York |isbn=978-0-393-04525-3 |page=885 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims and speculations==
[[Image:Badgeman.jpg|right|thumb|Jack White's enlargement of the alleged "Badge Man" area]]
[[File:Badgeman coloured.jpg|right|thumb|White's speculative colorized version]]
In 1982, Gary Mack, the longtime curator and archivist for The [[Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza]] (the former [[Texas School Book Depository]]), was the first person to claim discovery of the "Badge Man" figure.&lt;ref name="Myers"/&gt; In Mack's visual interpretation, a uniformed police officer can be seen standing behind the stockade fence, with his face obscured by a [[muzzle flash]], but a [[Badge|small bright object]] is visible on his chest.&lt;ref name="Myers"/&gt;&lt;ref name=RH866&gt;Bugliosi, p. 866.&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of the "Badge Man" figure's existence helped perpetuate [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories]] that have alleged that members of the [[Dallas Police Department]] had killed Kennedy and simultaneously framed [[Lee Harvey Oswald]].&lt;ref name=Miami&gt;{{cite news|title= JFK Assassination Theorists |author= Alex Heard |newspaper= Miami New Times |date= December 25, 1991 |url= http://www.miaminewtimes.com/content/printVersion/233678/ |accessdate=November 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his initial observations, Mack was assisted by photographer and assassination researcher Jack White, who continued his experimentation with the Moorman photograph. In the mid-1980s, White put forward a new version, enhanced in contrast and brightness, which he claimed revealed the policeman figure in higher clarity.&lt;ref name="Myers"/&gt;

White's research was shown and discussed in the 1988 documentary series ''[[The Men Who Killed Kennedy]]''. In it, a closeup of the enhanced "Badge Man" figure is repeated onscreen as a voice-over describes three shooters at Dealey Plaza, which is said to be in league with the [[American Mafia|Mafia]].&lt;ref name=RH903ff&gt;Bugliosi, 903–904.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the three is described as standing in the "Badge Man"'s position, behind the stockade fence on the grassy knoll. The narration identifies this shooter as [[Lucien Sarti]], a French national and alleged contract killer.&lt;ref name=RH903ff/&gt;

To the anatomical right (photo left) of the supposed "Badge Man" figure, some researchers claim there is a second person seen, the self-proclaimed witness [[Gordon Arnold]], who claimed in 1978 that he was filming the motorcade while wearing his [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] uniform when a shot passed close to his left ear.&lt;ref name=Miami/&gt;

==Counter-claims==
The Moorman photograph was seen contemporaneously in world media through [[UPI]], but the [[Warren Commission]] did not include it in the volumes of its 1964 report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=JFK: The Documented Screenplay |last=Stone |first=Oliver |authorlink=Oliver Stone |author2=Zachary Sklar |year=1992 |publisher=[[Hal Leonard Corporation]] |isbn= 9781557831279 |page=122 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GyskeQlVFfkC&amp;pg=PA122 |accessdate=24 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] (1976–1978) sent a high-quality negative version of the Moorman photo to the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] (RIT) for enlargement, enhancement, and analysis. The RIT's report states that it found no evidence of human forms anywhere in the background, and the specific area behind the stockade fence was deemed to be so [[Underexposure#Overexposure and underexposure|underexposed]] that it was impossible to glean any information from it.&lt;ref name=RH885/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;HSCA, Volume VI, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers have claimed that the "Badge Man" image is sunlight reflecting off a glass bottle and not a human figure. Some photos and films taken immediately after the assassination do, in fact, show a bottle sitting  on top of the retaining wall.&lt;ref name=RH866/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reitzes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Reitzes|first=David|url=http://www.jfk-online.com/jfk100badge3.html|title=Badge Man|work=The JFK 100|accessdate=April 9, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110515011130/http://www.jfk-online.com/jfk100badge3.html| archivedate= May 15, 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researcher and computer animator [[Dale K. Myers|Dale Myers]] believes the measurements of the Grassy Knoll area give proof that the alleged figure would have been in an impossible position to fire a weapon at the motorcade, saying "if [the Badge Man were] truly a human being of average height and build, [he] was located  12–18 feet (3.7–5.5 m) behind the fence line and elevated 3–4 feet (0.91–1.2 m) above the ground."&lt;ref name="Myers"&gt;Myers, Dale K.

The '''Chicxulub impactor''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|iː|k|ʃ|ə|l|uː|b}} {{respell|CHEEK|shə-loob}}), also known as the '''K/Pg impactor''' and (more speculatively) as the '''Chicxulub asteroid''', was an [[asteroid]] or other celestial body some {{convert|10|to|15|km|0}} in diameter&lt;ref name="AGU-20140409"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sleep |first1=Norman H. |last2=Lowe |first2=Donald R. |title=Scientists reconstruct ancient impact that dwarfs dinosaur-extinction blast |url=https://news.agu.org/press-release/scientists-reconstruct-ancient-impact-that-dwarfs-dinosaur-extinction-blast/ |date=9 April 2014 |journal=[[American Geophysical Union]] |accessdate=30 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC_2017&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-39922998 |title=Dinosaur asteroid hit 'worst possible place' |last=Amos |first=Jonathan |date=15 May 2017 |website=[[BBC News Online]] |access-date=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which struck the Earth at the end of the [[Cretaceous|Cretaceous period]], approximately 66 [[Myr|million years ago]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dinosaur extinction: Scientists estimate 'most accurate' date|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-21379024|website = BBC News|accessdate = 2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating the [[Chicxulub crater]]. It impacted a few miles from the present-day town of [[Chicxulub, Yucatán|Chicxulub]] in [[Mexico]], after which the impactor and its crater are named. Because the estimated date of the object's impact and the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]] (K–Pg boundary) coincide, there is a scientific consensus that its impact was the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] which caused the death of most of the planet's non-avian [[dinosaur]]s and many other species.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = International Consensus — Link Between Asteroid Impact and Mass Extinction Is Rock Solid|url = http://www.lpi.usra.edu/features/chicxulub/|website = www.lpi.usra.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://eesc.columbia.edu/courses/w4937/Readings/Schulte.etal.2010.pdf |title=The Chicxulub Asteroid Impact and Mass Extinction at the Cretaceous-Paleogene Boundary |last=Schulte |first=Peter |date=March 5, 2010 |journal=Science |doi=10.1126/science.1177265 |pmid=20203042 |access-date=2015-06-25 |volume=327 |pages=1214–8 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150625001637/http://eesc.columbia.edu/courses/w4937/Readings/Schulte.etal.2010.pdf |archivedate=June 25, 2015 |bibcode = 2010Sci...327.1214S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impactor's crater is over {{convert|150|km|abbr=off}} in diameter&lt;ref name="eid"&gt;{{Cite Earth Impact DB | name = Chicxulub | accessdate = December 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the [[List of impact craters on Earth#Largest craters (10 Ma or more)|second largest]] known [[impact crater]] on Earth.

==Parent body==
There are several competing models for the impactor's origin and its relationship to other asteroids that still exist in the Solar System. In September 2007, [[William F. Bottke]], David Vokrouhlický, and David Nesvorný proposed an origin for the impactor in an article published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. This argued that a collision in the asteroid belt 160 million years ago resulted in the [[Baptistina family]] of asteroids, the largest surviving member of which is [[298 Baptistina]]. They proposed that the Chicxulub impactor was an asteroid member of this group, referring to the large amount of carbonaceous material present in microscopic fragments at the site, suggesting that it was a member of a rare class of asteroids called [[carbonaceous chondrite]]s, like Baptistina. According to Bottke, the Chicxulub impactor was a fragment of a much larger parent body about {{convert|170|km|mi|abbr=on}} across, with the other impacting body being around 60&amp;nbsp;km (40&amp;nbsp;mi) in diameter. 

However, in 2011 new data from the [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] revised the date of the collision which created the [[Baptistina family]] to about 80 million years ago, casting doubt on the hypothesis, as typically the process of resonance and collision of an asteroid takes many tens of millions of years.&lt;ref name=Universe&gt;Tammy Plotner, ''[http://www.universetoday.com/89050/did-asteroid-baptistina-kill-the-dinosaurs-think-other-wise/#more-89050 Did Asteroid Baptistina Kill the Dinosaurs? Think other WISE...]'' in ''Universe Today'' (2011) at universetoday.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Other work has associated the asteroid [[P/2010 A2]], a member of the [[Flora family]] of asteroids, as a possible remnant cohort of the Chicxulub impactor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/02/02/us-space-asteroid-idUSTRE61154120100202 "Smashed asteroids may be related to dinosaur killer"] Reuters, February 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Child bereavement''' occurs when a child loses someone of importance in their life. There is substantial research regarding grief in adults, but there is less focus in literature about grief among children.&lt;ref name=Melhem2011&gt;Melhem, N. M. (2011). Grief in Children and Adolescents Bereaved by Sudden Parental Death. Archives of General Psychiatry, 68(9), 911&lt;/ref&gt; Children will experience instances in their life that could involve losing a parent, sibling, or friend through suicide, unintentional injury, homicide, or natural causes.&lt;ref name=Melhem2011/&gt; The levels of grief and bereavement differ among children, including uncomplicated and complicated bereavement.&lt;ref name=Worden1996&gt;Worden, J. W. (1996). Children and grief: When a parent dies&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike adults, children may experience and express their grief and bereavement through behaviors, and are less likely to outwardly express their emotions.&lt;ref name=Osterweis1989&gt;Osterweis, M., Solomon, F., &amp; Green, M. (1989). Bereavement: reactions, consequences, and care. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press&lt;/ref&gt; The children who experience bereavement and grief can receive treatment involving group intervention,&lt;ref name=Pfeffer2002&gt;Pfeffer, C. R., Jiang, H., Kakuma, T., Hwang, J., &amp; Metsch, M. (2002). Group Intervention for Children Bereaved by the Suicide of a Relative. Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry, 41(5), 505-513.&lt;/ref&gt; play therapy,&lt;ref name=Fiorini2006&gt;Fiorini, J., &amp; Mullen, J. A. (2006). Counseling children and adolescents through grief and loss. Champaign, IL: Research Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and cognitive behavioral therapy.&lt;ref name=Cohen2006&gt;Cohen, J. A., Mannarino, A. P., &amp; Deblinger, E. (2006). Treating trauma and traumatic grief in children and adolescents. New York, NY: The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Different forms of treatment for children experiencing bereavement and or grief can help to reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, social adjustment, and posttraumatic stress.&lt;ref name=Pfeffer2002/&gt; Research has shown that it is important to be aware of the difficulties in predicting how losing a closed one can impact a child’s emotionality and how their coping abilities will differ across ages and cultures.&lt;ref name=Osterweis1989/&gt;

== Background ==
Across cultures the loss of a parent is consistently rated as one of the most difficult experiences that a child will endure.&lt;ref name = Yamamoto1996&gt;Yamamoto, K., Davis, O.L., Dylak, S., Whittaker, J., Marsh, C., &amp; Westhuizen, P. C. van der. (1996). Across six nations: Stressful events in the lives of children. Child Psychiatry and Human Development, 26(3), 139-150.&lt;/ref&gt; In western countries, 5% of children will experience the loss of a parent.&lt;ref name=Currier2007&gt;Currier, J. M., Holland, J. M., &amp; Neimeyer, R. A. (2007). The effectiveness of bereavement interventions with children: A meta-analytic review of controlled outcome research. Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, 36(2), 253–259&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US census Bureau of Statistics2012"&gt;US Bureau of Census. Suicide Deaths and Rates. Washington, DC: National Center for Health Statistics; 2012:87-97&lt;/ref&gt; Across the world the loss of a parent is seen as a significant life event for a child.&lt;ref name=Yamamoto1996/&gt; However, the process of grieving can look different for each child based on their age, the quality of the relationship with the deceased parent, and the characteristics of the death.

An individual’s culture is an important factor that will influence the bereavement process. What one culture believes to be maladaptive another culture may view as healthy; there is no universally accepted view of the bereavement process &lt;ref name=Carter1989&gt;Carter, S. L. (1989). Themes of Grief. Nursing Research, 38(6), 354&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bereavement ==
There are two categories of bereavement that children experience after the loss of a parent; complex bereavement and uncomplicated bereavement. Uncomplicated bereavement is the normal process that most children will experience. Children who experience uncomplicated bereavement and receive adequate parenting following the death of a parent appear to not be at risk of developing a mental health condition in the future.&lt;ref name=Warden1996&gt;Worden, J. W. (1996). Children and grief: When a parent dies.&lt;/ref&gt; Complicated bereavement occurs when an individual fails to return to their pre-bereavement emotional and behavioral functioning &lt;ref name="Cutcliffe, J. R.1998"&gt;Cutcliffe, J. R.1998. Hope, counselling and complicated bereavement reactions. Journal of Advanced Nursing, 28(4), 754-761&lt;/ref&gt;
The precise definition and duration of the bereavement process has been a source of controversy over the decades.&lt;ref name="Wakefield, J. C.,2012"&gt;Wakefield, J. C., &amp; First, M. B. (2012). Validity of the bereavement exclusion to major depression: does the empirical evidence support the proposal to eliminate the exclusion in DSM-5? World Psychiatry, 11(1), 3–10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Kendler, K. S., Myers, J., &amp; Zisook, S.2008"&gt;Kendler, K. S., Myers, J., &amp; Zisook, S. (2008). Does Bereavement-Related Major Depression Differ From Major Depression Associated With Other Stressful Life Events? American Journal of Psychiatry, 165(11), 1449–1455&lt;/ref&gt; According to the DSM-V, Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder, requires that the child loss someone that they had a close relationship with; and during a 6 month period the child must experience on more days than not one of the following symptoms, a yearning for the deceased individual, sorrow or emotional pain for the dead, preoccupation with the death, or preoccupation surrounding the circumstances around the death.&lt;ref name="American Psychiatric Association2013"&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2013) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-5(5th ed.). Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, six more symptoms must be experienced on more days than not that are related to reactive distress to death or social/identity disruption.&lt;ref name="American Psychiatric Association2013"/&gt;

== Development considerations ==
Children can be vulnerable to life events following loss.&lt;ref name=Osterweis1989/&gt; The vulnerability is due to developmental immaturity and the lack of developed coping abilities.&lt;ref name=Osterweis1989/&gt; It is common to assume children will grieve in a similar fashion to adults, but their symptoms and duration of grief following loss appears differently.&lt;ref name=Osterweis1989/&gt; This may include children repeatedly asking questions about death for reassurance that nothing has changed and reenacting the death or funeral activities.&lt;ref name=Osterweis1989/&gt; Additionally, children’s emotions may be expressed differently than adults; adults may express their grief through sadness, but children may misbehave or have outbursts.&lt;ref name=Osterweis1989/&gt; Research emphasizes the importance of being cognizant of and not to expect children to display their emotions outwardly like adults, but rather that their behaviors could indicate their internal distress.&lt;ref name=Osterweis1989/&gt;

== Treatment ==
A large portion of children may experience loss and bereavement at some point during their childhood.&lt;ref name=Pfeffer2002/&gt; After these losses occur, there are a variety of types of treatment techniques that can be implemented, including Play Therapy, Group Therapy, and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.&lt;ref name=Pfeffer2002/&gt; Play therapy for loss during childhood uses activities like drawing or games that aid in having the children talk about their feelings.&lt;ref name=Pfeffer2002/&gt; Another effective form of therapy is Group Therapy tailored for loss during childhood, where a group of peers, similar in age, share and talk about their feelings and the bereavement process with a facilitator leading the group.&lt;ref name=Pfeffer2002/&gt; Lastly, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for loss during childhood includes using cognitive techniques to assist the child in changing their behavior and using more effective coping techniques.&lt;ref name=Cohen2006/&gt;


The different forms of treatment aiming to assist children in coping with loss and bereavement also help to reduce their symptoms of anxiety, depression, adjustment issues, and posttraumatic stress.&lt;ref name=Pfeffer2002/&gt; By using empirically driven forms of therapy for children who have experienced loss, children can reduce their symptoms and will be less likely to drop out of treatment by focusing on the feelings and reaction they have to the death or suicide of someone close.&lt;ref name=Pfeffer2002/&gt;

A '''coffin portrait''' ({{lang-pl|Portret trumienny}}) was a realistic [[portrait]] of the deceased person put on [[coffin]]s for the funeral and one of the elements of the [[castrum doloris]], but removed before the burial. It became a tradition to decorate coffins of deceased nobles (''[[szlachta]]'') with such [[funerary art]] in the times of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], particularly in the 17th and 18th centuries, the time of the [[baroque in Poland]] and [[Sarmatism]]. The tradition was limited to Commonwealth countries,{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} although the term may also describe the [[Fayum mummy portraits|Ancient Egyptian mummy portraits]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

==Design==
They were commonly painted on [[sheet metal]] (copper, tin or lead plates) and fixed on the narrow ends of the coffins at the side where the head of the deceased lay. On the opposite of the coffin there was usually an [[epitaph]], and the sides held a [[coat of arms]]. The shape of the upper edges of the portraits was based on the shape of the coffin, and the lower edges were often used to turn the whole into a [[hexagon]] or [[octagon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mariusz Karpowicz |coauthors= |title=Baroque in Poland |year=1991 |editor=  |page=68 |pages= |chapter= | chapterurl = |publisher= Arkady |location= |isbn=83-213-3412-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A3lZAAAAIAAJ&amp;pgis=1 |format= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[funeral]], the coffin portrait would often be hung on the walls of the church that the deceased had contributed to. In time, they increased in size – from 40 x 45&amp;nbsp;cm in the 17th century, to 70 x 72&amp;nbsp;cm in the 18th century.

[[File:Portrety trumienne.jpg|thumb|200px|Coffin portraits on display at [[Poznań Cathedral]], painters unknown.]]

The portraits were highly realistic, with the intent to create an impression that the deceased is taking part in their own funeral; that impression was reinforced often by the subject of the portrait gazing directly at the viewers. Some of them were painted during the life of the deceased.

==Cultural importance==
Historian [[Bernard O'Connor (historian)|Bernard O'Connor]] in his memoirs of 1696 wrote: "There is so much pomp and ceremony in Polish funerals that you would sooner take them to be a triumphant event than the burial of the dead". Indeed, for Polish nobles ([[szlachta]]), a proper funeral was extremely important. Those who could afford it spent lavishly on the funeral ceremonies, turning them into major events. But even the poor would try to have at least a basic coffin portrait, albeit those, painted by amateur painters, usually have little or no artistic merit.

Until the 20th century, the coffin portraits were ignored by scholars; those painted on silver or tin were stolen from churches and monasteries and then melted down, others were destroyed by treasure hunters and thieves, or simply fell to the ravages of time. Today the surviving coffin portraits provide a wealth of knowledge about culture (clothing, hairstyles and jewellery) of the Commonwealth nobility. Many coffin portraits are still displayed in various churches across Poland; hundreds are held in various museums.

The oldest coffin portrait in Poland is that of the king [[Stephen Báthory of Poland|Stefan Batory]] from the late 16th century. The most recent one is that of priest Marcin Porczyński from 1809.

The '''[[Coroner]] of the King's/Queen's Household''' was an office of the [[Medical Household]] of the [[Royal Household]] of the [[Monarch|Sovereign]] of the United Kingdom. It was abolished in 2013.

==History==

===The title===

The office of Coroner of The King's or Queen's Household, reporting to the [[Lord Steward]] of the Household, dates back at least to the 13th century, and possibly even earlier,&lt;ref&gt;At the [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmpublic/coroners/090224/pm/90224s12.htm committee stage] of the 2009 Coroners and Justice Bill, Henry Bellingham MP said "The post of coroner to the King or Queen's household is also an ancient one and I have worked out that it dates back to William I."&lt;/ref&gt; although not always given this exact name. As R.F. Hunnisett put it, "Another privileged area was peripatetic. This was the verge, which extended for twelve miles around the king's court. It had its own coroner, called the coroner of the king's household, coroner of the Marshalsea, or coroner of the verge ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hunnisett|1961|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a mention of the role in [[Law French]] by Bretton in 1290, "''Et en noster hostel soit un Corouner, qi face le mester de la Coroune par mi la verge''" (In our household let there be a Coroner to execute the business of the Crown throughout the verge)&lt;ref&gt;Quoted as such in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' and translated in {{harvnb|Nichols|1901|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a "William of Walden, coroner of the king's household" mentioned in 1333.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gross|1896}} "It happened at Everdon on Friday the feast of the Apostles Philip and James in the sixth year of King Edward the Third that Adam Wandeville was found dead. Inquest was taken before William of Walden, coroner of the king's household, and John of Tew, coroner of the county, concerning the death of the said Adam by the oath of [twelve] jurors."&lt;/ref&gt; A Robert of Hamond was described in 1480 as "coroner of the kynges houshold",&lt;ref&gt;Also according to the ''Oxford English Dictionary'', quoting Caxton's ''Chronicles of England'' (ccxxi. 212)&lt;/ref&gt; and we also have it in [[List of legal Latin terms|legal Latin]] in 1593 as ''Coronatore hospicij dicte domine Regine'', which [[John Leslie Hotson|Leslie Hotson]] translated as "Coroner of the household of our said lady the Queen" in his book on the death of the playwright [[Christopher Marlowe]], inquired into by the then Coroner of the Queen's Household, [[William Danby (coroner)|William Danby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hotson|1925|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shared responsibility===

According to Hunnisett, "during the thirteenth century, no other coroner was allowed to act within the verge, with the result that many felonies were not presented to the justices in eyre after the king's court had moved on...",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hunnisett|1961|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard Clarke Sewell]] tells us that "Anciently the Coroner of the Verge had power to do all things within the Verge belonging to the office of the Coroner, to the exclusion of the Coroner of the County, but this clearly caused problems, which two acts were intended to solve."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sewell|1843|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These two acts were, first, in 1300 (28 ''Edward I'' c.3, s.2.) the ''Articuli super cartas'' (Articles upon the charters), which said "...it is ordained, that from henceforth in cases of the death of men, whereof the Coroner's Office is to make view and Enquest, it shall be commanded to the Coroner of the County, that he, with the Coroner of the (King's) House, shall do as belongeth to his office and inroll it." Second, in 1311 (5 ''Edward II'' C.27.) there were the "New ordinances", which said "...&amp;nbsp;We do ordain, that from henceforth in case of homicide, whereof the Coroner's office is to make view and Inquest, it shall be commanded to the Coroner of the Country or of the Franchises where the dead persons shall be found, that he, together with the Coroner of the Household do execute the office which thereunto pertaineth, and shall enter it in his Roll..."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wellington|1905|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wellington described the result of the first statute thus: "By this statute (the whole of which is repealed by Coroner's Act, 1887), the Coroner of the county had to join with the Coroner of the Verge; but, without the assistance of the latter officer, the Coroner of the county could not act within the Verge. So neither could the Coroner of the Verge act in such cases, unless he be associated with the Coroner of the county; and this had to appear upon the inquisition, or otherwise it would be erroneous and void." In other words, wherever an inquest needed to be held within the verge it was to be presided over by the two coroners jointly. 

There was an exception to this, however, which was when an individual occupied both roles.&lt;ref&gt;Just as the most recent Coroner of The Queen's Household, [[Michael Burgess (coroner)|Michael Burgess]] is also coroner for Surrey, and his predecessor John Burton was also coroner for West London, according to an [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/how-much-does-he-earn-no-21-dr-john-burton-coroner-for-west-london-1428814.html item] in ''The Independent'' newspaper of 13 March 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to a case in 1589, where one Richard Vale was both Coroner of the Queen's Household and one of the coroners for Middlesex, [[Edward Coke|Sir Edward Coke]] reported that, despite Vale having presided alone where two coroners would have been expected, "it was resolved that the indictment was well taken, for the intent and meaning of the act was performed, and the mischief recited in the act avoided as well when one person is coroner of the houshold ''(sic)'', and of the county also, as if there should be two several persons."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coke|1777|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One other Act, in 1541/2, had also sought to clarify the relationship between the coroners of the county and the royal household. This was an "Act for Murder and Malicious Bloodshed within the Court" (33 ''Henry VIII'' C.12.), concerning deaths within the precincts of the Court itself. This stated "that all inquisitions upon the view of persons slain or hereafter to be slain within any of the King's said Palaces or houses or other house or houses aforesaid, shall be by authority of this Act had and taken hereafter for ever by the Coroner for the time being of the household of our Sovereign Lord the King or his heirs without any adjoining or assisting of another Coroner of any Shire within this Realm".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wellington|1905|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Coroners Act 1887===

In 1756, ''The Coroner's Guide'' was saying that "if a Murder be committed within the Verge, and the King removes before an Inquisition taken by The Coroner of the King's Household, the Coroner of the County and the Coroner of the King's House shall inquire of the same.".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anonymous|1756|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to imply that the joint responsibility applied only when the court moved between the time of the death and the inquest. And it does appear that the shared responsibility occurred less and less over the years. In an essay written in 1812, the anonymous author even felt able to write "The duty of the coroner of the verge is, although I believe now wholly disregarded, in deaths happening within the verge, to sit, jointly with the coroner of the county to take the inquisitions&amp;nbsp;... I should apprehend, therefore, that all inquests as they are now, I believe, taken by the coroner of the county singly, when the question should be discussed, will be held to be bad."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anonymous|1812|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coroners Act 1887, section 29, therefore removed this requirement—in fact doing away with the idea of the verge altogether—and leaving only those parts of the Henry VIII legislation mentioned above. Since then, their function was to investigate the death of anyone whose body was lying "within the limits of any of the Queen's palaces; or within the limits of any other house where Her Majesty is then residing."

===Abolition===

If the Coroner empanelled a jury to investigate the death, all members of the jury had to be chosen from among the members of the Royal Household. This led to some controversy concerning the independence of the jury in the 2006 second inquest into the [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|death]] of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]. Section 46 of the [[Coroners and Justice Act 2009]] abolished the office, effective 25 July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/section/46 Coroners and Justice Act 2009, section 46]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1869/made Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (Commencement No. 15, Consequential and Transitory Provisions) Order 2013, para. 2(e)]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13393">The '''Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace''' was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on September 13, 1999. This occurred after ten months of negotiations in the context of preparations for the [[International Year for the Culture of Peace]].

UN resolution A/53/243..&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un-documents.net/a53r243a.htm UN resolution A/53/243&lt;/ref&gt; called for the programme of action to include eight action areas:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Culture of peace through education
* Sustainable economic and social development
* Respect for all human rights
* Equality between women and men
* Democratic participation
* Understanding, tolerance and solidarity
* Participatory communication and the free flow of information and knowledge
* International peace and security
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As explained by [[UNESCO]], "each of these areas of action have been priorities of the United Nations since its foundation; what is new is their linkage through the culture of peace and non-violence into a single coherent concept. Linkages have often been made (for example, democracy, development and peace; equality between women and men with development and peace, and so forth). This is the first time, however, that all these areas are interlinked so that the sum of their complementarities and synergies can be developed."&lt;ref&gt;http://undocs.org/en/A/55/377 International Decade for a Culture of Peace and
Non-Violence for the Children of the World: Report of the Secretary-General&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture of Peace== 

United Nations consideration of the culture of peace began in 1992 with the adoption by [[UNESCO]] of a Culture of Peace Programme.  As the programme developed during the following decade, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] began requesting information from UNESCO about its progress.  The General Assembly then declared the Year 2000 as the [[International Year for the Culture of Peace]] and requested UNESCO to submit a draft Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace, which the General Assembly adopted on September 13, 1999.  The General Assembly also declared the Decade 2001-2010 as the [[International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World|International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World]].

Since his retirement from UNESCO where he had promoted the culture of peace in his capacity as Director-General, [[Federico Mayor]] has coordinated the Fundacion Cultura de Paz.  Since his retirement from UNESCO where he chaired the task force for the International Year for the Culture of Peace, [[David Adams (peace activist)|David Adams]] has coordinated the [[Culture of Peace News Network]] which was established for the [[International Year for the Culture of Peace]].

== United Nations Resolution A/53/243 ==

After stating that "the creation of the United Nations system itself, based upon universally shared values and goals, has been a major act towards transformation from a culture of war and violence to a culture of peace and non-violence", the UN General Assembly, in its resolution 52/13 of 20 November 1997, requested UNESCO to submit to its next session a draft declaration and programme of action on a culture of peace&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un-documents.net/a52r13.htm Resolution A/52/13&lt;/ref&gt;.  UNESCO supplied the requested document &lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001130/113034e.pdf Draft Declaration and Programme of Action submitted by UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;which was then taken under consideration by the General Assembly, beginning in December 1998.  The document encountered resistance and the situation at first was not encouraging&lt;ref&gt;http://culture-of-peace.info/history/Adoption.html Adoption of Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace&lt;/ref&gt;. One reason was the fact that the draft declaration referred to a "human right to peace," a concept vigorously opposed by the Great Powers&lt;ref&gt;http://roche.apirg.org/public_html/writings/documents/nuclear/LiuCentrePresentation.pdf 
The Human Right to Peace&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The programme of action also calls for a global movement for a culture of peace and the sharing of information among "actors on their initiatives in this regard".

Addressing the General Assembly, Ambassador [[Anwarul Karim Chowdhury]] of Bangladesh, who had chaired the informal consultation process, called it a unique and universal document: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I believe that this document is unique in more than one way. It is a universal document in the real sense, transcending boundaries, cultures, societies and nations. Unlike many other General Assembly documents, this document is action-oriented and encourages actions at all levels, be they at the level of the individual, the community, the nation or the region, or at the global and international levels.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/53/PV.107 United Nations General Assembly Official Records, Fifty-third Session, 107th plenary meeting&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Manifesto 2000 for a culture of peace and nonviolence ==

The Manifesto was drafted for the International Year for the Culture of Peace by a group of Nobel Peace Prize winners in order to translate the resolutions of the United Nations into everyday language addressed to all people.&lt;ref&gt;http://decade-culture-of-peace.org/iycp/iycp-uk/manifeste/uk_pour_en_savoir_plus.htm UNESCO Information about the Manifesto&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manifesto asked individuals to pledge "in my daily life, in my family, my work, my community, my country and my region, to"&lt;ref&gt;http://decade-culture-of-peace.org/iycp/iycp-uk/manifeste/uk_manifeste.htm Manifesto text&lt;/ref&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Respect the life and dignity of each human being without discrimination or prejudice;
* Practise active nonviolence, rejecting violence in all its forms: physical, sexual, psychological, economic and social, in particular towards the most deprived and vulnerable such as children and adolescents;
* Share my time and material resources in a spirit of generosity to put an end to exclusion, injustice and political and economic oppression;
* Defend freedom of expression and cultural diversity, giving preference always to dialogue and listening without engaging in fanaticism, defamation and the rejection of others;
* Promote consumer behaviour that is responsible and development practices that respect all forms of life and preserve the balance of nature on the planet;
* Contribute to the development of my community, with the full participation of women and respect for democratic principles, in order to create together new forms of solidarity;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Manifesto was translated into more than 50 languages and personally signed by many
Heads of State and Government.  It was diffused throughout the world and individuals were invited to sign and commit themselves to practise its principles in everyday life. As a result, by the end of the International Year, it had been signed by over 74 million individuals, including by more than 1 million each from Brazil, Colombia, India, Japan, Kenya, Nepal and Republic of Korea.&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001223/122350e.pdf Report on the Progress Made by Unesco in the Implementation of the Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace and on Cooperation with the United Nations System in this Field &lt;/ref&gt;

Detailed data entries for the 20 countries with more than 100,000 signatures are shown on the UNESCO website for the Year&lt;ref&gt;http://decade-culture-of-peace.org/iycp/iycp-uk/uk_sum_monde.htm World Information Board&lt;/ref&gt;

== UNESCO Culture of Peace Programme ==

The culture of peace resolution and the Manifesto 2000 campaign were the culmination of a decade-long Culture of Peace Programme at UNESCO.  The Programme was adopted by the UNESCO Executive Board in the fall of 1992, in order to ″heal the social wounds of war by local activities of reconciliation and co-operation in countries where Security Council peace-keeping operations are already being implemented or may be anticipated because of developing violence.″&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0009/000938/093829eo.pdf Co-operation to promote a culture of peace&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major test of the Culture of Peace Programme was in El Salvador&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0009/000958/095819eo.pdf Action programme to promote a culture of peace&lt;/ref&gt; using the methodology of "cross-conflict participation" by which the reconciliation of those who had been fighting against each other in the past was promoted by their joint participation in the planning and implementation of projects designed to benefit all concerned in fields such as education, culture, communication and science&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmu.edu/programs/icar/ijps/vol1_2/UNESCO.htm The UNESCO culture of peace programme in El Salvador: An initial report&lt;/ref&gt;

The national culture of peace programmes did not receive the needed political and financial support from the UNESCO Member States, and were all discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;http://culture-of-peace.info/history/page10.html Early History of the Culture of Peace: National Culture of Peace Projects (1993-1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the most important year in the development of UNESCO/UN culture of peace initiative, three separate initiatives converged: the proclamation of the [[International Year for the Culture of Peace]] (2000)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un-documents.net/a52r15.htm Proclamation of the year 2000 as the International Year for the Culture of Peace&lt;/ref&gt;; the proposal for the UN Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace (see above); and the initiative of the Nobel Peace Laureates "Campaign for the Children of the World"&lt;ref&gt; https://www.un.org/press/en/1997/19970904.unesco4.sep.html Press conference on appeal for launching decade for culture of non-violence&lt;/ref&gt; that would eventually become the [[International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World|International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World]] (2001-2010).

In recent years UNESCO has continued to actively promote the culture of peace in Africa with programs co-ordinated by its field office in Gabon and in cooperation with governments and foundations in Angola and Côte d'Ivoire.&lt;ref&gt;http://cpnn-world.org/new/?p=11285 Will UNESCO once again play a role in the culture of peace?&lt;/ref&gt;

== United Nations High-Level Meetings on the Culture of Peace ==

Beginning in 2012 the President of the United Nations General Assembly has convened in September a High-Level Forum on the Culture of Peace.  The themes of the 2012 Forum were education, youth outreach, and women’s empowerment. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon opened the Forum, saying “When we look at the suffering in our world, we know how urgently we need a culture of peace.”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/press/en/2012/ga11281.doc.htm General Assembly High-Level Forum on Culture of Peace&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012, similar High-Level Forums have been held at United Nations Headquarters each September.

==  Fundación Cultura de Paz ==

On his retirement as Director-General of UNESCO, Federico Mayor established the Fundación Cultura de Paz to continue the work he had supervised while at UNESCO.  The Fundación has sponsored many events and projects over the years, including the midterm&lt;ref&gt; http://www.fund-culturadepaz.org/spa/INFORME_CULTURA_DE_PAZ/INFORME/InformeENG.pdf World Report on the Culture of Peace&lt;/ref&gt; and final &lt;ref&gt;http://www.fund-culturadepaz.org/spa/DOCUMENTOS/Report_on_the_Decade_for_a_Culture_of_Peace.pdf Final civil society report on the Decade&lt;/ref&gt; reports for the International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World. Mayor is frequently invited to address audiences around the world on the subject of the culture of peace &lt;ref&gt; http://fund-culturadepaz.org/eng/07/cent07ENG.htm News&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fundación maintains an updated History of the Culture of Peace which contains references to hundreds of documents and events that have followed up the recommendations of the Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fund-culturadepaz.org/doc/HistoryCultureofPeace.pdf History of the Culture of Peace&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture of Peace News Network ==

The [[Culture of Peace News Network]], begun at UNESCO as part of the [[International Year for the Culture of Peace]], has been continued as a source of news of events that promote the culture of peace.  It is updated more or less daily with articles from around the world promoting at least one of the eight program areas of the culture of peace, and a review of the news is sent out as a bulletin each month.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kosmosjournal.org/article/the-invisible-yet-existent-culture-of-peace/ The Invisible Yet Existent Culture of Peace&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Death in the Terminal''''' is a 2016 [[Israel]]i [[Rashomon effect|Rashomon style]] [[documentary]] film recounting the events of the October 2015 [[Beersheva bus station shooting]].

The film reconstructs the first 18 minutes after the shooting, when an [[Eritrea]]n refugee was mistaken for a terrorist, shot by a security guard and beaten by bystanders.&lt;ref name=journal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishjournal.com/hollywood/223774/violence-distrust-erupt-israeli-film-death-terminal/|title=Violence, distrust erupt in Israeli film ‘Death in the Terminal’|first=Avishay|last=Artsy|date=30 August 2017|accessdate=10 October 2017|work=Jewish Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CCTV|Security camera footage]] is [[Cross-cutting|inter-cut]] with eyewitness interviews and video from mobile phones.&lt;ref name=hollywood/&gt; However, the film does not reveal until two-thirds of the way through that the man on the ground is innocent,&lt;ref name=tablet/&gt; leaving the audience to assume until then that he is the terrorist.&lt;ref name=tablet/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9397">The '''death of Aristotelis Goumas''' took place on August 12, 2010, in [[Himarë]], [[Albania]], when the motorcycle of 37-year-old ethnic [[Greeks|Greek]] shopkeeper Aristotelis Goumas was hit by a car driven by three [[Albanians|Albanian]] men from [[Vlorë]]. According to eyewitnesses the death occurred after an altercation in Goumas' store, when the three men demanded that Goumas not speak to them in [[Greek language|Greek]] in his own store, which Goumas refused.  The suspects reportedly drove over the victim at least twice to make sure he was dead.

The death sent shockwaves through the [[Greeks in Albania|ethnic Greek community of Albania]], and demonstrators blocked the main highway from Vlorë to [[Sarandë]], which passes through the region.  The event was reported by all major news outlets in both countries, and was strongly condemned by both the Greek and Albanian governments.  Three suspects have been charged with murder and are awaiting trial.

==Incident==
On the morning of Thursday, August 12, 2010, three Albanian men from the town of [[Vlorë]] accosted Goumas in his store in the predominantly ethnic Greek town of Himarë, and demanded that he not speak to them in Greek according to eyewitnesses.&lt;ref name=nea1&gt;{{Cite web

The Albanian police were slothish at first, having ignored the victim's many pleas to them in the days beforehand. Only after the outcry following the murder did they being to treat the incident as a homicide and launch a manhunt in the region; they arrested seven individuals aged 19 to 22, while the main suspect remained at large.&lt;ref name=nea1/&gt;&lt;ref name=kathimerini/&gt; The main suspect, Ilir Mukaj from Vlorë, surrendered to police late on Sunday, August 15.&lt;ref name=nea2/&gt;&lt;ref name=kathimerini/&gt;  Seven people were eventually charged in all:  Three for the murder of Goumas, and the other four for hiding the murder suspects.&lt;ref name=nea3/&gt;

Several days after the incident, two cars driving on the road from Vlorë to Sarandë stopped in front of the Goumas family residence and fired bullets into the air. The Goumas family, which was in the house at the time, notified the police, who took eyewitness statements and collected bullet casings. According to diplomatic sources, there has recently been an upsurge in nationalist activity among Albanians, especially following the ruling of the [[International Court of Justice]] in favour of [[Kosovo]]'s independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Charlotte of Brunswick-Lüneburg''' (Charlotte Felicity; 8 March 1671&amp;ndash;29 September 1710) was a German noblewoman. She was born into the [[House of Hanover]] and later married into the [[House of Este]]. She was thus the [[List of Modenese consorts|Duchess of Modena]] by marriage. She died in childbirth. Some sources refer to her simply as ''Charlotte''.

==Biography==
[[File:Duchess Charlotte of Brunswick-Lüneburg as Diana by Jean Michelin.jpg|thumb|left|Duchess Charlotte of Brunswick-Lüneburg as Diana by Jean Michelin.]]
Born at [[Schloss Herrenhausen]] in Hanover, a palace later destroyed in [[World War II]], she was the eldest surviving daughter&lt;ref&gt;An older sister, Anne Sophie died in 1672 at the age of 2&lt;/ref&gt; of [[John Frederick, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]] and his wife, [[Benedicta Henrietta of the Palatinate]]. Her father had been the ruler of Brunswick-Lüneburg since 1665 and her parents had been married since 1668.

Charlotte had two younger sisters: Princess Henrietta and [[Wilhelmina Amalia of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Princess Wilhelmina Amalia]], who made a prestigious marriage in 1699 to the Holy Roman Emperor, [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]]. 

Charlotte married [[Rinaldo d'Este, Duke of Modena|Rinaldo d'Este]] in [[Modena]] on 11 February 1696. The youngest child of [[Francesco I d'Este, Duke of Modena]] and his third wife [[Lucrezia Barberini]], Rinaldo had been created a cardinal in 1685, but he left the church in 1694 to succeed his nephew [[Francesco II d'Este, Duke of Modena|Francesco II]] as Duke of Modena. Rinaldo wanted to encourage relations between Modena and Brunswick, whose ruling house was the [[House of Hanover]]. The marriage was celebrated splendidly despite financial problems in Modena; the artist [[Marcantonio Franceschini]] was commissioned to paint a room, the ''Salone d'onore'' at the ducal palace in honour of the marriage.

Charlotte fled Modena for [[Bologna]] in 1702 along with the rest of the Modenese royal family in order to avoid French troops in Italy due to the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. 

Her husband was sixteen years older than Charlotte, but the two had seven children. After her death, her son Francesco, the ducal heir, married in 1721 [[Charlotte Aglaé d'Orléans]], the daughter of [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Philippe d'Orléans]], the [[Régence|Régent]] of France during the childhood of King [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]. Her second daughter, Enrichetta, went on to marry first in 1727 [[Antonio Farnese, Duke of Parma]] and, after his death in 1731, Leopold, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt.

Charlotte died at the [[Ducal Palace of Modena]] after giving birth to a daughter in September 1710. The child also died. She was buried at the Church of San Vincenzo in Modena. Her son succeeded as Duke of Modena in 1737.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4626">'''Louis André Ernest Cloquet''' (born 11 October 1818, [[Paris]]; died 1855, [[Tehran]]) was a [[physician]] in [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Iran]] of [[French people|French]] origin during the reigns of [[Mohammad Shah Qajar]] (1834–1848) and [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar]] (1848–1896). He also served as the French minister to the court at Tehran from 1846 to 1855.

==Biography==
Cloquet the son of the noted French anatomist [[Hippolyte Cloquet]], and he also chose to become an anatomist. He was the nephew of another noted French physician, [[Jules Germain Cloquet]].{{sfn|Fisher|Avery|Hambly|Melville|1991|page=586}} From 1840 Ernest worked at various clinical offices in Paris, and was a regular contributor to the ''Société anatomique''.{{sfn|Richter-Bernburg|1992|page=718}} In 1846, with his [[thesis]] named ''De l’hématocèle vaginale'', he was awarded his doctors degree in [[medicine]], and later that year he was attached to the French mission in Tehran.{{sfn|Richter-Bernburg|1992|page=718}} He was appointed ambassador to the court and became the personal physician of the king (''[[shah]]''), succeeding another Frenchman named Dr. Labat.{{sfn|Richter-Bernburg|1992|page=718}} His regular attendance during the last illness of the then incumbent King Mohammad Shah Qajar earned him a good professional reputation.{{sfn|Richter-Bernburg|1992|page=718}} Not long after Naser al-Din Shah Qajar's ascension to the throne, Cloquet was officially re-confirmed by the King in his functions.{{sfn|Richter-Bernburg|1992|page=718}} He was also appointed as an instructor in the newly founded [[Dar ul-Funun (Persia)|Dār al-Fonūn]] University.{{sfn|Richter-Bernburg|1992|page=718}}

Following a failed attempt on the King's life in 1852 by followers of the [[Báb]], Cloquet treated him and removed a bullet from one of his wounds.{{sfn|Richter-Bernburg|1992|page=718}} When subsequently many followers of the Bab were arrested and executed, high-ranking officials at the king's court were formally invited to show their loyalty by personally participating in the executions; Cloquet did not participate, stating that it would violate his [[Hippocratic oath]].{{sfn|Richter-Bernburg|1992|page=718}}

He carried out a programme of research on [[cholera]]. Cloquet himself witnessed two outbreaks{{snd}}in 1846 and 1853.{{sfn|Richter-Bernburg|1992|page=718}} He made observations regarding the sanitary conditions of the nation as well as its climate.

In November 2015 Alex Elsea, Marla's nephew, launched FlyLady Premium, a paid virtual [[Mentorship|mentoring]] service which adds extra support to followers of the FlyLady methodology in small private online groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.exitevent.com/article/duke-u-students-flylady-premium-refreshes-160602|title=Duke Student's Startup Refreshes 17-Year-Old Home Organizing Guru FlyLady|newspaper=ExitEvent|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; FlyLady Premium released an app, ''FlyLadyPlus''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flyladyplus/id1115477521?mt=8|title=FlyLadyPlus on the App Store|website=App Store|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; in July 2016.  Later in 2016, FlyLady herself released a subscription-based iOS reminder app, ''FlyLady Messenger.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flylady-messenger/id1148739578?mt=8|title=FlyLady Messenger on the App Store|website=App Store|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Marla Cilley, founder of FlyLady, is from North Carolina.&lt;ref name="Deirdre_tidy_soul"&gt;{{cite news 
 | author = Deirdre Donahue
 | title = FlyLady says a tidy soul comes first
 | url = https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2002-09-30-cilley_x.htm 
 | publisher = [[USA Today]]
 | date=  2002-09-30
 | accessdate = 2007-07-21
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Cilley joined a web forum called ''SHE's Online'', based on the [[housekeeping]] system created by Pam Young and Peggy Jones, ("The Slob Sisters") detailed in their book ''Sidetracked Home Executives: From Pigpen to Paradise'' (1977)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Young
 | first = Pam
 | authorlink =

 | title = Sidetracked home executives: From pigpen to paradise
 |date=January 1977
 | publisher = Binford &amp; Mort 
 | ASIN = B000H590VI
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book covers many of the key topics that were adapted to become the FlyLady system; daily task lists, routines, "slipshod cleaning", and a systematic view to housekeeping. FlyLady refers to Pam and Peggy as her mentors and inspiration.

Marla first created an email group (first on [[e-Groups]], then [[Yahoo! Groups]]), then published her website, Flylady.net, in February 2001.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news 
 | author = Elizabeth Lund
 | title =  When domestic chaos threatens, FlyLady buzzes to the rescue
 | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-88627392.html
 | publisher = [[The Christian Science Monitor]]
 | date=  2002-07-10
 | accessdate = 2007-07-21
}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

The name FlyLady was Marla Cilley's screen name, as she was a fly-fishing fan and instructor.  One of the members of the FlyLady e-mail list later created a "[[backronym]]" for FLY: '''F'''inally '''L'''oving '''Y'''ourself.&lt;ref name="Deirdre_tidy_soul"/&gt;

==Methodology==
FlyLady's methodology is outlined in Cilley's book ''Sink Reflections'' ([[Bantam Books]], {{ISBN|0-553-38217-9}}) and on the web site.  The system encourages "baby steps" to develop routines and habits to organize and maintain your home.  The primary focus is on "Finally Loving Yourself" by making your life easier by decluttering, menu planning, "anti-procrastination" day, and establishing routines, as well as financial and health-related self-care&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 | publisher = [[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]
 | page = J1
 | date=  2006-04-22
 | accessdate = 2007-07-21
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Marla Cilley and co-author Leanne Ely also released a [[New York Times]] bestselling book called ''Body Clutter: Love Your Body, Love Yourself'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Cilley
 | first = Marla

 |author2=Leanne Ely

 | isbn = 978-1-4165-3462-4
}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aims to apply the FlyLady's housekeeping methodology to caring for the reader's body, through self-examination and increased self-respect.

Key points in the FlyLady system include:

;Babysteps and Routines
:New recruits to the FlyLady system are called "Flybabies" and are introduced to "babysteps" - a series of 31 small daily tasks which introduce and then reinforce aspects of cleaning and decluttering, building up to creating personalized routines for morning, afternoon and evening. Once these routines are established, the "Flybaby" has "graduated" and will no longer need the [[Instructional scaffolding|scaffolding]] of the emails.

;Shine Your Sink
:Cilley's first instruction to new members is "Go shine your [[sink]]!"  She asserts that even in a messy kitchen, the cleaned-out and polished sink provides positive reinforcement to the person who cleaned it, encouraging further cleaning in the rest of the room and home.

;15 Minutes at a Time
:Cilley recommends using a [[timer]] to work for only 15 minutes at a time. The short time commitment helps stop procrastination, and reduces opportunities to get sidetracked or bored.

;Clutter Cannot Be Organized
:Cilley recommends that her followers get rid of excess items in their homes, and bring in fewer items, rather than attempting to organize them. This reduction "decluttering" is done 15 minutes at a time. One such exercise is FlyLady's "27-fling Boogie," in which the follower quickly selects 27 items in their home to discard and 27 items to  give away.

;Weekly Routines
:Marla advises the use of weekly routines, whereby each weekday is assigned an additional task or focus; Monday is daily cleaning, Wednesday is errand day, Thursday is grocery day and Friday is "desk day", focusing on paperwork and finances, as well as the day to declutter the car.

;Weekly Home Blessing
:Cilley's adaption of the Pam Young and Peggy Jones' "Slipshod cleaning" is the one-hour housecleaning mission called the "weekly home blessing."  Using their timers, followers are instructed to vacuum, dust, mop, empty trash, change bedsheets and clean up old magazines. Each task is allocated ten minutes only.

;Get Dressed to Shoes
:Cilley insists that her followers "get dressed to [[Sneakers|lace-up shoes]]" before beginning their housekeeping tasks - or contacting her for an interview.&lt;ref name="Beem"&gt;{{cite news

 | publisher = [[Deseret News]]
 | date=  2010-03-30
 | accessdate = 2011-05-05
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Zones
:Flylady divides a house into five sections or zones, which are allocated to the five weeks or partial weeks of the month. Each day the email list will provide a "mission" with a detailed cleaning task in the current zone.

;Control Journal
:Flylady advises the use of a "Control Journal," a household management notebook or binder, to store the owner's routines, lists and other important household information.

;Flylady Reminders
:Daily reminders of the routines, zones and missions, as well as "testimonials" of the system and products, are sent to subscribers of the FlyLady list.

;Perfectionism leads to Procrastination
:FlyLady asserts that the most frequent reason for [[procrastination]] and inefficiency is [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]], as people won't start a task if they think they don't have the time or the ability to do it perfectly. Some frequently repeated sayings in this respect are "good enough is good enough" or "housework done incorrectly still blesses your family".

;No Whining
:FlyLady often repeats that her Facebook page is a "No Whining Zone", and that "If you can't say anything nice, say nothing at all".

'''Football hooliganism'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/find_out/guides/sport/international_football/newsid_3089000/3089728.stm | title=What is football hooliganism? | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the term used to describe disorderly, violent or destructive behaviour perpetrated by spectators at [[association football]] events.&lt;ref name="independent38673"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Another sorry outbreak of the English disease|work=[[The Independent]]|date=17 June 2004|url=http://comment.independent.co.uk/leading_articles/article38673.ece|accessdate=2007-07-25|location=London|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930155241/http://comment.independent.co.uk/leading_articles/article38673.ece|archivedate=30 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Football [[hooliganism]] normally involves conflict between gangs, in English known as football [[List of hooligan firms|firm]]s (the term derives from the British slang for a criminal gang), formed for the purpose of intimidating and physically attacking supporters of other teams. Other English-language terms commonly used in connection with hooligan firms include "army", "boys", "[[Casual (subculture)|casuals]]", and "crew".  Certain clubs have long-standing rivalries with other clubs and hooliganism associated with matches between them (sometimes called [[local derby|local derbies]]) is likely to be more severe.

Conflict may take place before, during or after matches. Participants often select locations away from stadiums to avoid arrest by the police, but conflict can also erupt spontaneously inside the stadium or in the surrounding streets.&lt;ref name="Tribune001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="novasports.gr" /&gt; In extreme cases, hooligans, police, and bystanders have been killed, and body-armoured [[riot police]] have intervened with [[tear gas]], [[police dogs]], [[armoured fighting vehicle|armoured vehicles]] and [[water cannon]]s.&lt;ref name="soccerphile001"/&gt; Hooligan-led violence has been called "aggro" (short for "aggravation") and "bovver" (the [[Cockney]] pronunciation of "bother", i.e. trouble).

Hooligans who have the time and money, may follow national teams to away matches and engage in hooligan behaviour against the hooligans of the home team.  They may also become involved in disorder involving the general public.  While national-level firms do not exist in the form of club-level firms, hooligans supporting the national team may use a collective name indicating their allegiance.

==Behavior==

Football hooliganism involves a wide range of behaviour, including:
* taunting
* spitting
* unarmed fighting
* throwing of objects on to the pitch, either in an attempt to harm players and officials or as a gesture of insult.
*throwing of objects at opposing supporters, including stones, bricks, coins, flares and [[Molotov cocktail]]s.&lt;ref name="Tribune001"/&gt;&lt;ref name=novasports.gr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.novasports.gr/default.asp |title=novasports.gr |publisher=novasports.gr |date= |accessdate=2010-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314052754/http://www.novasports.gr/default.asp |archivedate=14 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* fighting with weapons including [[baseball bats|sports bats]], glass bottles, rocks, [[rebar]], knives, [[machetes]] and [[firearms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwworld.de/dw/article/0,2144,1701053,00.html |title=German Hooligans Make Mark in Bratislava &amp;#124; World Cup 2006 &amp;#124; Deutsche Welle &amp;#124; 05.09.2005 |publisher=Dwworld.de |date= |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* disorderly crowd behaviour such as pushing, which may cause stadium fixtures such as fences and walls to collapse.  Similar effects can occur when law-abiding crowds try to flee disorder caused by hooligans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1094303.stm |title=Fence collapse hits soccer final |publisher=BBC News |date=30 December 2000 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
The first instance of football violence is unknown, but the [[phenomenon]] can be traced back to [[History of England#14th century|14th-century England]]. In 1314, [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] banned football (at that time, a violent, unruly activity involving rival villages kicking a [[pig's bladder]] across the local [[heath]]) because he believed the disorder surrounding matches might lead to [[Rebellion|social unrest]], or even [[treason]].&lt;ref name="Guardian061213"&gt;{{Cite news|title=When did football hooliganism start?|publisher=The Guardian|date=13 December 2006|url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/news/theknowledge/0,9204,618130,00.html|accessdate=2007-07-25 | location=London | first=Sean | last=Ingle}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[University of Liverpool]] academic [[Academic paper#Scholarly paper|paper]], conflict at an 1846 match in [[Derby]], England, required a reading of the "[[riot act]]" and two groups of [[dragoon]]s to effectively respond to the disorderly crowd. This same paper also identified "[[pitch invasion]]s" as a common occurrence during the 1880s in English football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FIG FACT-SHEET FOUR: HOOLIGANISM|url=http://www.liv.ac.uk/footballindustry/hooligan.html|work=University of Liverpool FIG Factsheet|publisher=Liverpool FC|accessdate=9 May 2012|author=Pearson, G.|date=December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded instances of football hooliganism in the [[History of association football#From amateurism to professionalism|modern game]] allegedly occurred during the 1880s in England, a period when [[gang]]s of supporters would intimidate neighbourhoods, in addition to attacking referees, opposing supporters and players. In 1885, after [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] beat [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] 5–0 in a friendly match, both teams were [[wikt:pelt|pelted]] with stones, attacked with sticks, punched, kicked and spat at. One Preston player was beaten so severely that he lost consciousness and press reports at the time described the fans as "howling roughs".&lt;ref name="Guardian061213"/&gt; The following year, Preston fans fought [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] fans in a railway station—the first alleged instance of football hooliganism outside of a match. In 1905, a number of Preston fans were [[Trial|tried]] for hooliganism, including a "[[Public intoxication|drunk and disorderly]]" 70-year-old woman, following their match against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]].&lt;ref name="Guardian061213"/&gt;

Although instances of football crowd violence and disorder have been a feature of association football throughout its history&lt;ref name="Dunning"&gt;Dunning, E, Murphy, P and Williams, J., 'The Roots of Football Hooliganism' 1988, Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]]'s ground was reportedly closed in 1920, 1934 and 1950 after crowd disturbances), the phenomenon only started to gain the media's attention in the late 1950s due to the re-emergence of violence in [[History of association football#South America|Latin American football]]. In the 1955–56 English football season, [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] fans were involved in a number of incidents and, by the 1960s, an average of 25 hooligan incidents were being reported each year in England. The label "football hooliganism" first began to appear in the English media in the mid-1960s,&lt;ref name="Stott"&gt;Stott, C. and Pearson, G., 'Football Hooliganism: Policing and the War on the English Disease', 2007 London: Pennant Books&lt;/ref&gt; leading to increased media interest in, and reporting of, acts of disorder. It has been argued that this in turn created a 'moral panic' out of proportion with the scale of the actual problem.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;Hall, S, 'The Treatment of 'Football Hooligans' in the Press', in Ingham et al., (1978) Football Hooliganism: The Wider Context, London: Inter-Action Inprint&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Football hooliganism has factors in common with juvenile delinquency and what has been called "ritualized male violence".&lt;ref&gt;Ramón Spaaij, Understanding Football Hooliganism: A Comparison of Six Western European Countries&lt;/ref&gt; Sports Studies scholars Paul Gow and Joel Rookwood at [[Liverpool Hope University]] found in a 2008 study that "Involvement in football violence can be explained in relation to a number of factors, relating to interaction, identity, legitimacy and power. Football violence is also thought to reflect expressions of strong emotional ties to a football team, which may help to reinforce a supporter’s sense of identity."&lt;ref name="joelrookwood.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joelrookwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Paper-6-Gow-and-Rookwood-Vol-2-2009.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031101939/http://www.joelrookwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Paper-6-Gow-and-Rookwood-Vol-2-2009.pdf |archivedate=31 October 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]] one study from 1986 claimed that alcohol, irregular tickets sales,  the disinterest of the organisers and the "'cowardly ineptitude'" of the police had led to the tragedy. Gow and Rookwood's 2008 study, which used interviews with British football hooligans found that while some identified structural social and physiological causes (e.g. aggression produces violent reactions) most interviewees claimed that media reports (especially in newspapers) and the police's handling of hooligan related events were the main causes of hooliganism.&lt;ref name="joelrookwood.com"/&gt; [[Politics|Political]] reasons may also play in part in hooliganism, especially if there is a political undertone to such a match (e.g. unfriendly nations facing each other).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/devon/hi/people_and_places/newsid_9176000/9176519.stm|title=Why does football violence happen?|date=10 November 2010|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an attempt to explain the hooliganism phenomena in Brazil, Nepomuceno and other scholars at Federal University of Pernambuco has accessed 1363 hooligan incidents before and after an alcohol sanction enforced during 8 years. While alcohol presented low evidence to contribute for the incidents of violence, the knockout phases, finals, competitiveness (derby matches), small score boundaries and the pride levels were some of the potentials for the violence among sports spectators. Months after the work being conducted, the State Legislature of Pernambuco decided to abolish the sanction to allow alcohol intake in stadiums.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nepomuceno|first=Thyago Celso C.|last2=de Moura|first2=Jadielson Alves|last3=e Silva|first3=Lúcio Câmara|last4=Cabral Seixas Costa|first4=Ana Paula|date=December 2017|title=Alcohol and violent behavior among football spectators: An empirical assessment of Brazilian's criminalization|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlcj.2017.05.001|journal=International Journal of Law, Crime and Justice|volume=51|pages=34–44|doi=10.1016/j.ijlcj.2017.05.001|issn=1756-0616}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for the [[BBC]] in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22158585 |title=BBC Sport – Millwall &amp; Newcastle violence: Who is to blame for football chaos? |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=15 April 2013 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Bond stated that in the UK, {{quote|text=[h]igh-profile outbreaks of violence involving fans are much rarer today than they were 20 or 30 years ago. The scale of trouble now compared to then doesn't bear comparison – either in terms of the number of people involved or the level of organisation.  Football has moved on thanks to [[ban (law)|banning orders]] and better, more sophisticated policing.
And while it is too simplistic to say that the higher cost of watching football has pushed unsavoury elements out, there has been a shift in the way people are expected to behave inside grounds. Offensive chants are still way too commonplace but actual fighting doesn't happen very often.}}

==Subculture==
Football hooligans often appear to be less interested in the football match than in the associated violence. They often engage in behaviour that risks their being arrested before the match, denied admittance to the stadium, ejected from the stadium during the match or banned from attending future matches. Hooligan groups often associate themselves with, and congregate in, a specific section (called an ''end'' in England) of their team's stadium, and sometimes they include the section's name in the name of their group. In the United Kingdom, 1960s and early 1970s football hooliganism was associated with the [[skinhead]] subculture. Later, the [[casual (subculture)|casual]] subculture transformed the British football hooligan scene. Instead of wearing working class skinhead-style clothes, which readily identified hooligans to the police, hooligans began wearing [[Designer clothing|designer clothes]] and expensive "offhand" [[Sportswear (fashion)|sportswear]] (clothing worn without careful attention to practical considerations), particularly [[Stone Island]], [[Prada]], [[Burberry]], [[CP Company]], [[Sergio Tacchini]] and [[Adidas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FASHION: On the Street; A Rainbow of Raincoats|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/02/style/fashion-on-the-street-a-rainbow-of-raincoats.html|accessdate=9 May 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2 April 1989|author=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-hooligan measures==
Police and civil authorities in various countries with hooligan problems have taken a number of measures, including:
* banning items that could be used as weapons or missiles in stadiums, and searching suspected hooligans
* banning identified hooligans from stadiums, either formally via judicial orders, or informally by denying them admittance on the day
* moving to [[All-seater stadium|all-seated stadiums]], which reduces the risk of disorderly crowd movement
* segregating opposing fans, and fencing enclosures to keep fans away from each other and off the pitch
* banning opposing fans from matches and/or ordering specific matches to be played behind closed doors
* compiling registers of known hooligans
* restricting the ability of known hooligans to travel overseas.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
Football hooliganism in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] is particularly associated with the supporters of clubs such as [[FK Sarajevo]] ([[Horde Zla]]), [[FK Željezničar Sarajevo]] ([[The Maniacs]]), [[FK Velež Mostar]] ([[Red Army Mostar|Red Army]]), [[HŠK Zrinjski Mostar]] (Ultrasi) and [[FK Borac Banja Luka]] (Lešinari).  Other clubs with hooligans as supporters include [[FK Sloboda Tuzla]] (Fukare), [[NK Čelik Zenica]] (Robijaši) and [[NK Široki Brijeg]] (Škripari).

Hooliganism reflects local ethnic divisions and tensions.  Bosniak oriented groups are fans of FK Sarajevo, FK Željezničar and FK Velež Mostar.  Serb oriented groups are fans of FK Borac Banja Luka, [[FK Slavija]], and [[FK Drina Zvornik]] (Vukovi). Croat oriented groups are fans of [[NK Široki Brijeg]] (Škripari) and HŠK Zrinjski Mostar.

Many fans are associated with fascist ideologies, supporting and glorifying extremist movements such as the [[Ustaše]], [[Chetniks]] and [[Nazi]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lampa Studio d.o.o. – www.lampa.ba |url=http://sportsport.ba/bh_fudbal/ne-nacizmu/46262 |title=Ne nacizmu! |publisher=SportSport.ba |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 [[2009 NK Široki Brijeg–FK Sarajevo football riots|riots]] between supports of [[Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Premier League]] club sides [[NK Široki Brijeg]] and [[FK Sarajevo]] left [[Horde Zla]] supporter Vedran Puljić (from [[Sarajevo]]) dead from a gunshot wound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://riotonline.com/blog/2009/10/fc-sarajevo-fan-dies-in-riots/ |title=FC Sarajevo fan dies in riots! &amp;#124; Riot terrace fashion blog |publisher=Riotonline.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooliganism has also been present in lower leagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lampa Studio d.o.o. – www.lampa.ba |url=http://sportsport.ba/bh_fudbal/veliki-neredi-u-jablanici-spasavala-se-ziva-glava/106331 |title=Veliki neredi u Jablanici, spašavala se živa glava |publisher=SportSport.ba |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riots have been common in Jablanica because fans of different clubs tend to meet and clash there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lampa Studio d.o.o. – www.lampa.ba |url=http://sportsport.ba/bh_fudbal/sprijecen-sukob-navijaca-borca-i-zrinjskog-u-jablanici/104194 |title=Spriječen sukob navijača Borca i Zrinjskog u Jablanici |publisher=SportSport.ba |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Croatia===
Football hooliganism in [[Croatia]] has seen riots over inter-ethnic resentments and the politics that were reignited by the breakup of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav federation]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="soccerphile001"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Podnar |first=Ozren| title=The Day Yugoslav Soccer Died |publisher=Soccerphile |url=http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/news/balkans-soccer/football-war.html |accessdate=2007-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the best known [[List of hooligan firms|hooligan firms]] are [[Torcida Split|Torcida]] ([[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]]) and [[Bad Blue Boys]] ([[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]]).&lt;ref name="soccerphile002"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Podnar |first=Ozren| title=The Ultra Scene in Croatia and Serbia: Football Hooliganism Balkan Style |publisher=Soccerphile |url=http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/news/balkans-soccer/hooligans.html |accessdate=2007-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the groups are not just hooligan firms; they are more like the South American [[Torcida]] supporters groups and [[Ultras]] groups, with organised [[Tifo]]s and so on.

On 13 May 1990 (before the breakup of Yugoslavia) Serbian club [[Red Star Belgrade]] was in [[Zagreb]] to play [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]] at the [[Maksimir Stadium]]. Red Star was accompanied by 3000 Delije, the organized supporters of the club. Before the match a number of small fights broke out. Police reinforcements soon arrived with [[armoured fighting vehicle|armoured vehicles]] and [[water cannon]]s, focusing to separate the fans. Dinamo's player [[Zvonimir Boban]] kicked one policeman, defending a Dinamo's fan beaten by the police. The fighting lasted for over an hour and hundreds of people were injured. Football hooliganism in Croatia is sometimes connected with racism and nationalism,&lt;ref name="soccerphile001"/&gt; although the racist remarks, if any appear, are pointed solely to opposing club's players, never to own squad.

Ethnic tension between Croats and Serbs has also led to fighting at a football match in Australia. On 13 March 2005, [[Sydney United FC|Sydney United]] (who have a large Croatian following, and were established by Croatian immigrants) and [[Bonnyrigg White Eagles Football Club|Bonnyrigg White Eagles]] (who have a large Serbian following and were established by Serbian immigrants) met in Sydney in the [[New South Wales Premier League]]. About 50 fans clashed, resulting in two police officers getting injured and five fans being arrested. [[Football NSW]] held an inquiry into the events. Both clubs denied that the fight was racially motivated or that there was any ethnic rivalry.&lt;ref name="SMH050314"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Football riot's stupidity, not ethnic, say clubs|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=14 March 2005|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Football/Football-riots-stupidity-not-ethnic-say-clubs/2005/03/14/1110649117701.html|accessdate=2007-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
P
Croatian hooligans are also notorious for staging large illegal pyroshows at stadiums, where signal flares and smoke bombs are hurled onto the pitch causing postponement or cancellation of the match. A large incident occurred in 2003 in Rome during the Hajduk-Roma match when 900 Torcida fans threw signal flares at Roma fans resulting in various injuries and clashes with the police.

Another incident occurred in [[Genoa]] in 2007 when masked Torcida fans attacked the police with bricks, bottles and stones. Rioting continued in the stadium when Torcida fans threw chairs into the pitch and made [[nazi]] salutes. A riot occurred in 2006 in [[Osijek]] during the Osijek-Dinamo match. Several clashes between the Bad Blue Boys and [[Kohorta Osijek|Kohorta]] occurred before the match in which one Osijek fan received several stab wounds after which Osijek fans attacked the police and Dinamo fans with signal flares and stones.

A large riot occurred in 2008 in [[Prague]] prior to the [[Sparta Prague]]-Dinamo match. Riots were ignited with the support of Sparta's ultrafans to Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić.&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}}[http://www.index.hr/sport/clanak/bbb-se-susrecu-s-ljubiteljima-karadzica-i-mladica-kojima-ogradu-krasi-srpska-zastava/400226.aspx Index.hr] BBB se susreću s ljubiteljima Karadžića i Mladića, 8 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- just see the pictures --&gt; Approximately 500 Bad Blue Boys rioted in the city centre breaking shops and attacking police with chairs, signal flares and stones. Approximately 300 Bad Blue Boys were detained and 8 police officer were injured. Prior to the riots some Bad Blue Boys provoked local [[Romani people]] by giving [[nazi]] salutes.

A large riot occurred in 2010 on 1.May at the [[Maksimir stadium]] when the Bad Blue Boys clashed with the police resulting in many arrests and one critically injured police officer. After the match violent clashes continued in which one Dinamo fan was shot by police officers. A large incident occurred in 2009 prior to the [[FC Timişoara]]-Dinamo match. 400 Bad Blue Boys rioted in the city centre and attacked local people. After the incident [[Romanians|Romanian]] police detained a large number of Dinamo fans but the situation escalated again at the [[FC Timişoara]] stadium when 200 Bad Blue Boys tore down the pitch fence and attacked the police with chairs and bats resulting in several injured police officers. During the clash Dinamo fans fired signal missiles at [[FC Timişoara]] fans resulting in severe injuries.
Many [[Croats|Croatian]] hooligan groups have also displayed [[nazi]] flags at matches and have [[neo-nazi]] [[skinheads]] in their ranks. Several incidents occurred when Bad Blue Boys and Torcida made racist chants towards opposing club's football players of [[Black people|African]]&lt;!-- Charlize Theron and Richard Gibson are also of African descent --&gt; descent and hurled bananas in the pitch. In 2010, a [[Cameroon]] player was attacked in [[Koprivnica]] resulting in severe injuries.

In December 2010. 10–15 Tornado ([[Zadar]]) hooligans attacked a [[FK Partizan|Partizan]] traveling coach with stones and bricks resulting in one injured person. In December 2010 30–40 [[Bad Blue Boys]] attacked a [[PAOK]] traveling coach with stones, bricks and flares setting the traveling coach on fire and inflicting injuries on several passengers.

In November 2014, during a [[Euro 2016]] qualifying game in [[Milan, Italy]] hooligans from Croatia threw flares and fireworks onto the field and the game had to be briefly suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2836967/Italy-1-1-Croatia-European-Championship-qualifier-suspended-10-minutes-second-half.html|title=Italy 1-1 Croatia: European Championship qualifier suspended for 10 minutes in second-half - Daily Mail Online|date=16 November 2014|work=Mail Online|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyprus===
Football hooliganism in Cyprus has been an issue for the past few decades and incidents are generally associated with the 5 major Cypriot clubs.

[[Anorthosis Famagusta FC]] fans have been in involved in many incidents on most occasions involving their ultras group "Mahites".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sigmalive.com/news/local/103398/epeisodia-ston-petosfairiko-agona-anagennisi-anorthosi|title=Επεισόδια στον πετοσφαιρικό αγώνα Αναγέννηση- Ανόρθωση|author=sigmalive/ΚΥΠΕ|date=22 February 2014|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two clubs in Limassol, [[AEL Limassol]] and [[Apollon Limassol]] have also been involved in numerous incidents, especially in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsbeast.gr/sports/arthro/680998/epeisodia-amaurosan-to-derbi-ael-apoel/|title=Επεισόδια αμαύρωσαν το ντέρμπι ΑΕΛ-ΑΠΟΕΛ|work=Newsbeast.gr|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philenews.com/el-gr/koinonia-eidiseis/160/153504/krisimos-travmatismos-nearou-sto-filiko-anorthosi-apollon|title=Κρίσιμος τραυματισμός νεαρού στο φιλικό Ανόρθωση-Απόλλων|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ant1iwo.com/kypros/2013/11/03/treis-syllhceis-gia-ta-epeisodia-ston-ag/|title=ANT1 internet world - Τρεις συλλήψεις για τα επεισόδια στον αγώνα Απόλλων - ΑΠΟΕΛ|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of [[APOEL FC]] and [[AC Omonia Nicosia]], the two most successful and most popular clubs in the country are notorious for hooliganism. The most violent cases of hooliganism in Cyprus usually involve the two teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philenews.com/el-gr/koinonia-eidiseis/160/200575/ektetamena-epeisodia-exo-apo-to-oikima-tou-apoel|title=Εκτεταμένα επεισόδια έξω από το οίκημα του ΑΠΟΕΛ|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport24.gr/football/Cyprus/epeisodia-sthn-kupro.2792956.html|title=Επεισόδια και διακοπή στο ΑΕΛ - ΑΠΟΕΛ|author=Φώντας Σέμπρος|date=17 May 2014|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ant1iwo.com/kypros/2012/05/17/skhniko-polemoy-sth-lemeso-videos/{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport24.gr/multimedia/video/anorthwsh-omonoia-epeisodia.1977896.html|title=Ανόρθωση - Ομόνοια (επεισόδια)|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009 APOEL fans entered the Omonia stand and engaged in fistfights with Omonia fans eventually throwing one down the stand stairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.article&amp;id=42915|title=Σοβαρά επεισόδια και διακοπή του ντέρμπι ΑΠΟΕΛ-Ομόνοια|work=Ελευθεροτυπία|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 6 months later in November fans of the two teams clashed close to the [[GSP Stadium]] when APOEL fans tried to hijack a futsal tournament organized by Omonia.

The rivalry between Omonia and APOEL has its roots in politics. APOEL fans are in their majority right wing whereas Omonia fans are left wing. Communist symbols in the Omonia stand and right wing or even fascist symbols in the APOEL stand are not uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leftwingsoccer.com/politics-of-cypriot-football/|title=Left-Wing Soccer – Understanding the Political Divide in Cypriot Football|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Limassol rivalry between Apollon and AEL Limassol is more a matter of what team dominates over the city.&lt;ref name="free-project.eu"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.free-project.eu/documents-free/Working%20Papers/Performing%20Fan%20Identities%20Role%20Politics%20Antagonistic%20Communication%20Football%20Fans%20Cyprus%20%28S%20Stylianou%20V%20Theodoropoulou%29.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623144937/http://www.free-project.eu/documents-free/Working%20Papers/Performing%20Fan%20Identities%20Role%20Politics%20Antagonistic%20Communication%20Football%20Fans%20Cyprus%20%28S%20Stylianou%20V%20Theodoropoulou%29.pdf |archive-date=23 June 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hooliganism in the case of Anorthosis is also politically linked, especially when the club plays a left wing team such as Omonia. Other incidents between clubs of different cities that are of the same political orientation are associated with intercity rivalries, particularly when a club from Limassol faces a club from Nicosia.&lt;ref name="free-project.eu"/&gt;

===France===

[[File:Supporters LOSC vs PSV Eindhoven.png|thumb|This photo of a match in [[Lille]] shows the use of flares by PSV Eindhoven supporters in football hooliganism.]]
Football hooliganism in France is often rooted in [[social conflict]], including racial tension. In the 1990s, fans of [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] (PSG) fought with supporters from Belgium, England, Germany, Italy and Scotland.&lt;ref name = "Bay"&gt;{{Cite news| title =Racist insults infiltrate French soccer stadium|url =http://www.baystatebanner.com/archives/stories/2006/04/042006-07.htm | publisher =[[The Boston Bay State Banner]]| date= 20 April 2006 | accessdate = 2006-10-21|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060715011039/http://www.baystatebanner.com/archives/stories/2006/04/042006-07.htm |archivedate = 15 July 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a long-standing north/south rivalry between PSG (representing Paris and by extension northern France) and [[Olympique de Marseille]] (representing the South of France) which has encouraged authorities to be extremely mobilised during games between the two teams. Violent fights and post-game riots including car burning, and shop windows smashing have been a regular fixture of PSG-OM games. In 2000, the bitter rivalry turned particularly violent.&lt;ref name="BBC3"&gt;{{Cite news| title = PSG act after fan hurt

On 24 November 2006 a PSG fan was shot and killed by police and another seriously injured during fighting between PSG fans and the police. The violence occurred after PSG lost 4–2 to [[Israeli people|Israeli]] club [[Hapoel Tel Aviv F.C.|Hapoel Tel Aviv]] at the Parc des Prince in a [[UEFA Cup]] match. PSG fans chased a fan of Hapoel Tel Aviv, shouting racist and anti-semitic slogans. A plainclothes police officer who tried to protect the Hapoel fan was attacked, and in the chaos, one fan was shot dead and another seriously injured. In response, the French Interior Minister, [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] held a meeting with the president of the French Football League, Frederic Thiriez to discuss racism and violence in football. The director-general of the French police, Michel Gaudin, insisted that measures against football hooliganism had reduced racist incidents to six that season from nineteen in the previous season. Gaudin also stated that 300 known hooligans could be banned from matches.&lt;ref name="BBC2"&gt;{{Cite news| title = France faces up to football hooliganism |url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6189888.stm | publisher = BBC| date= 27 November 2006 | accessdate = 2007-04-29 | first=Caroline | last=Wyatt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fan who was shot, was linked with the ''Boulogne Boys'', a group of fans who modelled themselves on British hooligans in the 1980s. The group's name comes from the [[Kop of Boulogne]] (KOB), one of the two main home fan stand at the Parc des Princes.

The KOB themselves held a silent memorial march attended by 300 and accused the police office of murdering the fan.

The threat of dissolution of fan groups has also tempered the outward rivalry and violence of a number of fans. Known violent fans under ban sentences are to report to the nearest Police station on nights of game, to prove they are not anywhere in proximity to the stadium.

On 11 June 2016, during a Euro 2016 match in [[Marseille]] between Russia and England, violent conflict broke out between the fans and left 35 injured.

===Greece===
[[File:Panathinaikos-paok 1989.jpg|thumb|Hooligans of "GATE 13" Panathinaiko's attacking supporters of "GATE 4" Paok and punched in field of Leoforos Alexandras stadium.]]
The first incidents between Football fans in Greece were recorded in June 1930, after the match between [[Aris Thessaloniki]] and [[Panathinaikos F.C.]] at Thessaloniki. While Panathinaikos fans where arriving at the port of [[Piraeus]] from [[Thessaloniki]], Olympiakos fans, who had not forgotten the big loss of their team (8–2) by [[Panathinaikos F.C.]] rioted with the green fans. 
The word "hooliganism" was recorded at the early '60s where Greek students in the UK who had experienced the phenomenon of hooliganism there first taught the term to the journalists who were unable to explain why the fans were fighting each other and gave this situation a name.
In 1962, after [[Panathinaikos F.C.]] and [[P.A.O.K. F.C.]] match incidents, newspapers wrote for the first time that hooligans (Χούλιγκανς) vandalized [[Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium]].
It was on 19 November 1966 that a big flag, at the 13th gate of [[Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium]] announced the arrival of a new group on the scene. [[Gate 13]] would be the first organized group that over the years became a part of the club by affecting club decisions and by following the club on all possible occasions.
[[P.A.O.K. F.C.]] fans made Gate 4 in 1978 and [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] fans create the Gate 7 in 1981.
In 1982, between Aris FC – Paok FC match incidents, Aris Dimitriadis was stabbed and later died in Thessaloniki's hospital. On 26 October 1986, at the Alkazar stadium of Larissa Charalambos Blionas was killed by a flare pistol thrown by the Paok fans. One month later anastasios Zontos was stabbed to death in Omonoia square in the center of Athens before the match [[AEK Athens F.C.]] &amp; [[P.A.O.K. F.C.]]. In January 1991, before the derby of Aek F.C. and Olympiakos F.C., George Panagiotou died in the incidents between hooligans outside Nea Filadelfia's stadium hit by flare pistol.
On 15 May 2005, in [[Thessaloniki]] derby [[Iraklis Thessaloniki F.C.|Iraklis]]-[[Aris F.C. (Thessaloniki)|Aris F.C.]], Aris' hooligans called ''Ierolohites'' invaded the pitch when the score was 2–1 for Iraklis. A football player Tasos Katsambis was injured during the clashes. The match was halted and [[Aris F.C. (Thessaloniki)|Aris]] was punished with a 4-point deduction which led to their relegation to the [[Second Division (Greece)|Second Division]].
In April 2007, all sports stadiums were closed down in [[Greece]] for two weeks following the death of a fan in a pre-arranged fight between hooligans in [[Athens]] on 29 March. The fight involved 500 fans of rival [[Super League Greece]] clubs [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]], which is based in Athens, and [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], which is based in nearby [[Piraeus]]. The [[Politics of Greece|Greek government]] immediately suspended all team sports in Greece and severed the ties between teams and their supporters' organizations.&lt;ref name="Tribune001"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Kitsantonis | first = Niki | title = Soccer: Greece wrestles with fan violence| work=International Herald Tribune | date = 19 April 2007 | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/04/19/sports/GREEKS.php | accessdate = 2007-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Third Division (Greece)|Third Division]] match between [[Panetolikos]] and [[Ilioupoli GS|Ilioupoli]] was stopped for thirty minutes when players and fans clashed following a Panetolikos disallowed goal.

On 18 April, rival fans clashed with each other and riot police in [[Ioannina]] during and after a [[Greek football Cup|Greek Cup]] semi-final match between local rivals [[PAS Giannena]] and [[AEL 1964|Larissa]]. There was trouble during the game in which Larissa won 2–0. Fans set fire to [[Waste container|rubbish bins]] and smashed shop windows, while police tried to disperse them by firing tear gas.&lt;ref name="Tribune001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="novasports.gr" /&gt;

On 10 October 2009, a group of about 30 hooligans disrupted an "Under 17" match between local rivals PAOK and [[Aris Thessaloniki]]. Among the injured were a group of Aris Thessaloniki players and their coach, a veteran PAOK player and another official. On 7 October 2011, a group of Greek supporters firebombed the away section of a Euro 2012 qualifying match against Croatia in Athens.
On 18 March 2012, during the match for the Super League Greek Championship in Athens Olympic Stadium between Panathinaikos and Olympiakos, home team Panathinaikos's fans who were inside the stadium attacked police forces with Molotov bombs, causing extended damages to the stadium, while police forces were unable to keep peace.

Before the match clashes broke up between [[AEK Athens|AEK]] and [[Aigaleo FC|Aigaleo]] fans. Indeed, the clashes resulted in the arrest of a security guard of the stadium who was accused of participating in the clashes among [[Aigaleo]] hooligans and also accused of committing attempted murder against an [[AEK Athens|AEK]] fan.

On 15 September 2014, in [[Nea Alikarnassos]], the team Herodotus&lt;ref&gt;[[:el:Π.Α.Σ.Α. Ηρόδοτος]]&lt;/ref&gt; was hosting [[Ethnikos Piraeus]] , a [[Third Division (Greece)|Third Division]] match.

One of the biggest riots occurred at a [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA – Group 2)|World Cup qualifying match]] between Poland and England on 29 May 1993 in [[Chorzów]].

Arranged football hooligan fights in Poland are known as ''[[wikt:ustawka|ustawki]]''; they became common in Poland since the late 90s. On 30 March 2003, [[Polish police]] arrested 120 people after rival football supporters fought during a match between [[Śląsk Wrocław]] and [[Arka Gdynia]].&lt;ref name="BBC2901451"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Man killed in Polish football riot | publisher = BBC News | date = 30 March 2003 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2901451.stm | accessdate = 2007-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Wrocław football riot 2003|riot]], [[hooliganism|hooligans]] pelted police officers with stones and fought a running battle with knives and axes.

The most notable hooligan incidents happened in [[Kraków]] where supporters of the [[Wisła Kraków]] and [[KS Cracovia]] teams have a rivalry that reportedly extended to killings of opposing fans.

Country-wide riots involving football fans were seen in [[Słupsk street riots 1998|1998 in Słupsk]] and [[Knurów riots 2015|2015 in Knurów]], both incidents sparked by a killing of a fan by the police.

===Serbia===
The most prominent groups of hooligans are associated with [[Belgrade]] and [[Serbia]]'s two main clubs, [[Red Star Belgrade]] and [[FK Partizan|Partizan Belgrade]]. They are known as the ''[[Delije]]'' ("Heroes") and ''[[Grobari]]'' ("Gravediggers"), respectively. [[FK Rad]] is a less-successful Belgrade club, whose associated hooligans, known locally as "''United Force''", have notoriously been involved in many violent incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,1123137,00.html |title=The Observer: Football, blood and war |publisher=Observer.guardian.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-03-24 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 December 2007, a plainclothes police officer was seriously injured when he was attacked during a [[Serbian Superliga]] match between [[Red Star Belgrade]] and [[FK Hajduk Kula|Hajduk Kula]].&lt;ref&gt;The officer was attacked with burning flares and broken seats and he had to fire warning shots in the air in self-defence. He was treated for burns, cuts and bruises in a nearby hospital. The following day, the [[Football Association of Serbia]] requested government help to help crack down on football hooliganism in the country.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReutersidUKL0320214820071203"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Milosavljevic| first = Zoran| title = Soccer-Serbian government to take tougher stance on hooligans| publisher = Reuters | date = 13 December 2007 | url = http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldFootballNews/idUKL0320214820071203 | accessdate = 2007-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 April 2008 a football fan was killed near [[Novi Sad]] after clashes between [[FK Partizan]]'s [[Grobari]] and fans of [[FK Vojvodina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldFootballNews/idUKL1686240920080416 |title=Soccer-Serbian FA issues anti-hooliganism appeal |publisher=Uk.reuters.com |date=16 April 2008 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same week, after a Red Star Belgrade-Partizan cup match, three people were injured and a bus destroyed by hooligans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=04&amp;dd=17&amp;nav_category=12&amp;nav_id=294429 |title=Vesti – Nova divljanja huligana – Internet, Radio i TV stanica; najnovije vesti iz Srbije |publisher=B92 |date= |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Praha, Staré Město, Můstek, tag HCZ.JPG|thumb|Football firm [[graffiti]] in Prague.]]
On 19 September 2008 a Serbian football hooligan was sentenced to ten years in jail for an attack against a police officer at a [[Red Star Belgrade]]–[[FK Hajduk Kula|Hajduk Kula]] game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=09&amp;dd=19&amp;nav_id=53610|title=Red Star hooligan sentenced to 10 years|work=B92.net|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 October 2010 Serbia's Euro 2012 Qualifying clash with Italy was abandoned after only 6 minutes after several Serbian fans threw flares and fireworks onto the pitch and caused severe trouble in and out of the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsbeta.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/9086046.stm |title=BBC Sport – Football – Uefa begins investigation into Serbia fan violence |publisher=Newsbeta.bbc.co.uk |date=13 October 2010 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partizan Belgrade were disqualified from the UEFA Cup, after crowd trouble in Mostar, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina.

They attacked him and other fans with baseball bats and flares while wearing surgical masks. The hooligans received up to 35 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12279960 | work=BBC News | title=Serbia football fans jailed for 2009 Brice Taton murder | date=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
Football [[hooliganism]] in Spain arises from three main sources. The first is racism, as some [[black people|black]] players have been victims of [[list of ethnic slurs|ethnic slurs]]. [[Samuel Eto'o]], a former [[FC Barcelona]] player from [[Cameroon]], has denounced the problem.

The second source is the strong [[Major football rivalries|rivalry]] between [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]. After transferring from Barcelona to Real Madrid, [[Luís Figo]]'s appearance in Barcelona's [[Camp Nou|Nou Camp]] Stadium triggered a strong reaction. The crowd threw bottles, mobile phones and other things (including a pig's head). Although nobody was injured the match was followed by a large discussion on fan violence in the Spanish [[La Liga|Primera División]].

Hooliganism is also rooted in deep political divisions arising from the [[General Franco]] fascist regime days (some [[Real Madrid]], [[Atlético Madrid]], [[Espanyol]], [[Real Betis Balompie]] or [[Valencia CF]] ultras are linked to franquista groups), the communist ones, (such as [[Deportivo de La Coruña|Deportivo La Coruña]], [[Athletic Club Bilbao]], [[Sevilla FC]], [[Celta de Vigo]], [[Rayo Vallecano]]) and the independentist movements in [[Catalonia]] (like [[FC Barcelona]]), [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque]] region. In Spain, organized hooligan groups are popularly called ''grupos ultra''. Three notorious ones are the [[Boixos Nois]], the Frente Atlético and the Ultras Sur, supporter groups of FC Barcelona, Atlético Madrid and Real Madrid respectively.

In 1991, [[Frederiq Roiquier]], a French supporter of [[Espanyol de Barcelona]] was killed by [[FC Barcelona]] hooligans which mistook him for an Espanyol hooligan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elpais.com/diario/1991/01/30/deportes/665190001_850215.html |title=Un 'ultra' azulgrana afirma que la muerte de un joven francés fue rigurosamente planeada &amp;#124; Edición impresa &amp;#124; EL PAÍS |publisher=Elpais.com |date=30 January 1991 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 a 13-year-old child died in [[Espanyol]] stadium before a flare impact in his thorax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-65085 |title=MURIÓ UN NIÑO POR BENGALA EN ESPAÑA – Archivo – Archivo Digital de Noticias de Colombia y el Mundo desde 1.990 |publisher=eltiempo.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Aitor Zabaleta, a supporter of [[Real Sociedad]] was killed by an [[Atlético Madrid]] hooligan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/247076/l/ |title=El Tribunal Supremo confirma la pena por desórdenes contra Ricardo Guerra y otros miembros del grupo ultra Bastión |trans-title=The Supreme Court confirmed the sentence for disorderly conduct against Ricardo Guerra and other group members ultra Bastión |language=Spanish |publisher=20 Minutos |date=13 June 2007 |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was linked to a neo-Nazi group (Bastión), just before a match between these two teams. In 2003, a supporter of [[Deportivo de La Coruña|Deportivo La Coruña]] was killed in riots by Deportivo hooligans, when he tried to protect a supporter of the opposing team, [[SD Compostela]]. Since then, authorities have made attempts to bring hooliganism more under control. In 2007, there were acts of hooliganism before a match between Atlético Madrid and Real Madrid, with several cars being destroyed and policemen injured by flares and bottles which were thrown at them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title =Vandal incidents in Madrid|url =http://www.elcomerciodigital.com/prensa/20070225/deportes/vandalismo-frente-atletico_20070225.html | publisher =[[El Correo Digital]]| date= 24 February 2007| accessdate = 2007-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many black foreign players have been racially abused, such as at a 2004 friendly match between Spain and England, in which black England players such as [[Shaun Wright-Phillips]] and [[Ashley Cole]] endured [[monkey chants]] from Spain supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/monkey-chants-force-clampdown-on-spains-racist-football-fans-525020.html |title='Monkey chants' force clampdown on Spain's racist football fans – Europe, World |publisher=The Independent |date=29 January 2006 |accessdate=2010-03-24 | location=London | first=Graham | last=Keeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; There also have been local disputes between rival teams, for example between [[Cádiz Club de Fútbol]] and [[Xerez CD]], [[Real Betis Balompie]] and [[Sevilla FC]] or [[Deportivo de La Coruña]] and [[Celta de Vigo]].

Hooligan violence in Spain decreased since the late '90s due to an alcohol ban in sporting events as well as hooligan laws which attempt fines up to 600,000 euros and bans of two years without access to stadiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csd.gob.es/csd/informacion/legislacion-basica/ley-del-deporte |title=Ley del Deporte – Portal del Consejo Superior de Deportes |language=es |publisher=Csd.gob.es |date=1 January 2000 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2003 [[FC Barcelona]] hooligans, the [[Boixos Nois]] are not allowed to enter in [[Camp Nou]]. The hardcore of Barcelona hooligans subgroups were involved in police operations against organized crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/sociedad/20100919/casuals-una-mafia-catalana/486250.shtml |title=Casuals, una mafia catalana – Sociedad – El Periódico |publisher=Elperiodico.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, after a hooligan incident versus [[Espanyol]], [[FC Barcelona]] very publicly took a stand on violence, saying it hoped to stamp out violence for good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fcbarcelona.cat/web/english/noticies/club/temporada08-09/09/n080928105461.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120801194615/http://www.fcbarcelona.cat/web/english/noticies/club/temporada08-09/09/n080928105461.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1 August 2012 |title=FCBarcelona.cat |publisher=FCBarcelona.cat |date=28 September 2008 |accessdate=2010-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 [[Atlético Madrid]] hooligans clashed with Aberdeen FC hooligans prior to a [[UEFA Cup]] match.In 2009 and 2010 [[Atlético Madrid]] hooligans also clashed with [[FC Porto]] and [[Sporting Clube de Portugal]] in Portugal during [[UEFA Cup]] games.
In 2012 a [[Rayo Vallecano]] Hooligan was arrested during riots in 14-November general strike and accused of terrorism.

In 2014, debate about eradicating Spanish hooligans arose after Frente Atlético members murdered a Riazor Blues member, [[Deportivo La Coruña]] radicals; and after members of the [[Boixos Nois]] stabbed two [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|PSG]] supporters in Barcelona.

In 2016, Football-related violence came once again to the public debate after a Fight between [[Sevilla FC]] and [[Juventus FC]] Supporters that occurred the day before their [[UEFA Champions League]] group stage match. 2 Juventus supporters were stabbed (one of them was seriously injured but survived after being hospitalized) and a Sevilla supporter was hospitalized with head wounds caused by a glass bottle.

===Sweden===
Hooliganism began in Sweden at the turn of the 20th century as fans of [[AIK Fotboll|AIK]], [[Hammarby IF|Hammarby]] and [[Djurgårdens IF Fotboll|Djurgården]] have been reported fighting after derbies in [[Stockholm]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Modern hooliganism began in 1970 when fans of [[IFK Göteborg]] invaded the pitch, destroyed the goalposts and fought the police at the end of a match that relegated Göteborg from the [[Allsvenskan]], although Hooliganism in Sweden became a growing problem in the 1980s, but [[pitch invasion]]s and violence at football grounds decreased in the late 1990s; when hooligan firms started pre-arranging their fights away from the grounds and the regular supporters. Seven clubs that have large organised hooligans firms are [[AIK Fotboll|AIK]] (Firman Boys), [[IFK Göteborg]] (Wisemen) [[Djurgårdens IF Fotboll|Djurgårdens IF]] (DFG) [[Hammarby IF]] (KGB) [[Malmö FF]] (True Rockers) [[GAIS]] (Gärningsmännen) and [[Helsingborgs IF]] (Frontline). But several other football, bandy and ice hockey clubs have active hooligan followings.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite news| title =First Swedish football death |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/not_in_website/syndication/monitoring/media_reports/2169007.stm | publisher =BBC News| date= 2 August 2002 | accessdate = 2007-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2002, 12 members of the Wisemen stood trial for inflicting life-threatening injuries on a [[Hammarby IF|Hammarby]] fan in 2001.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

In August 2002, [[Tony Deogan]], a member of the Wisemen, was killed after a pre-arranged fight against Firman Boys.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; A second fatality occurred in March 2014, when a 43-year-old [[Djurgårdens IF Fotboll|Djurgården]] supporter was killed in [[Helsingborg]] in an assault on his way to Djurgården's opening match in the [[2014 Allsvenskan]] against [[Helsingborgs IF|Helsingborg]]. After the man's death became known, Djurgården supporters invaded the pitch after 42 minutes of play, prompting officials to abandon the match.&lt;ref name="Djurgården fan killed"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/fotboll/sverige/allsvenskan/djurgarden/article18634468.ab |title=Djurgårdssupporter misshandlad till döds |work=[[Aftonbladet]] |language=Swedish |last1=Svensson |last2=Wagner |first1=Olof |first2=Michael |date=30 March 2014 |accessdate=2014-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tragedy in Helsingborg"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://svenskfotboll.se/allsvenskan/arkiv/allsvenskan/tt/2014/03/helsingborg-djurgarden-avbruten/ | title=Djurgårdssupporter död efter bråk | publisher=The Swedish Football Association | work=svenskfotboll.se | date=30 March 2014 | accessdate=2 April 2014 | language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, hooligan incidents are rare due to the fact that the stadiums are small and teams are little.

One incident, dubbed the [[2006 Basel Hooligan Incident]], 13 May 2006, occurred on the last day of the 2005–06 season, when [[FC Zürich]] defeated [[FC Basel]] at [[St. Jakob Park]] to win the Swiss championship with a last-minute goal. After the final whistle, angry Basel hooligans stormed the field and attacked Zürich players. The Zürich team were forced to celebrate in the upper deck of the stands while the fighting continued. There was similar fighting in the streets that night.&lt;ref name="nzz.ch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzz.ch/2006/11/23/eng/article7274780.html |accessdate=6 December 2006 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nzz.ch"/&gt;

===Turkey===

According to the ''[[Turkish Daily News]]'', hooligan groups are well organised, have their own "leaders", and often consist of organised [[street fighting|street fighters]]. These groups have a "racon" (code of conduct), which states that the intention must be to [[injury|injure]] rather than [[murder|kill]] and that a stab must be made below the waist.&lt;ref name="fatalmistakes"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Chain of Fatal Mistakes | url = http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/h.php?news=chain-of-fatal-mistakes-2000-04-16 | publisher = [[Turkish Daily News]]| date = 16 April 2000| accessdate = 2006-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other hooligans have fired firearms into the air to celebrate their team's victory, which has been known to accidentally kill innocent people watching the celebrations on their balconies.&lt;ref name="passionofturks"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Passion of Turkish fans| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/704374.stm| publisher = BBC News| date = 6 April 2000| accessdate = 2006-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="givingperspective"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Giving perspective to football violence| url = http://www.soccernet.com/euro2000/columns/20000521featmike.html| publisher = [[Soccernet]]| date = 20 May 2000| accessdate = 2006-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trouble has arisen during matches between Istanbul rivals Galatasaray and Fenerbahçe.&lt;ref name="passionofturks" /&gt; However, the [[Turkish Football Federation]] has tightened security to try and contain the hooliganism. During the 2005 [[Turkish Football Cup|Turkish cup final]] between [[Galatasaray S.K. (football team)|Galatasaray]] and [[Fenerbahçe S.K.|Fenerbahçe]], 8,000 police, [[Football steward|stewards]] and officials were employed to prevent violence.&lt;ref name="istanbulready"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Istanbul ready to host final| url = http://www.newagebd.com/2005/may/15/spt.html| publisher = New Age Sports| location = Bangladesh| date = 15 May 2005| accessdate = 2006-10-06| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061028021547/http://www.newagebd.com/2005/may/15/spt.html| archivedate = 28 October 2006| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the Turkish Football Federation introduced new measures to combat the threat of hooliganism and have made new regulations that allow the Professional Football Disciplinary Board to fine clubs up to YTL 250,000 for their fans behavior.

Before Galatasaray's [[UEFA Cup 1999-00#Semi-finals|semi-final UEFA Cup match]] with [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] in 2000, two Leeds fans, Christopher Loftus and Kevin Speight, were [[2000 UEFA Cup semi-final violence|stabbed to death]] in [[Istanbul]] following street fights between Turkish and British hooligans.&lt;ref name="fatalmistakes"/&gt; UEFA allowed the game to proceed and Galatasaray won 2–0.

Ali Ümit Demir was arrested and sentenced to 15 years imprisonment for the stabbing, but the sentence was reduced to 5 years on the basis of heavy provocation, while five others were given lesser sentences of under four months.&lt;ref name="wcarchives"/&gt; The families of those accused of attacking with knives are reported to have defended their actions and approved of their children punishing the "rude British people".&lt;ref name="fatalmistakes" /&gt; Galatasaray fans were banned from traveling to the return match to try and avoid further clashes between fans, although there were reports of attacks by Leeds fans on Turkish television crews and the police.&lt;ref name="wildscenes"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Wild scenes greet Turkey's heroes| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/721664.stm| publisher = BBC News| date = 21 April 2000| accessdate = 2006-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the Assistant Chief Constable in charge of policing the game believed that the number of arrests was "no worse than a normal high category game".&lt;ref name="wildscenes" /&gt; [[Hakan Şükür]] was hit with projectiles from Leeds United supporters and the Galatasaray team bus was stoned after driving through an underpass. The game saw [[Emre Belözoğlu]] and [[Harry Kewell]] sent off and Galatasaray sealed their way to the final with a 2–2 score.

[[2000 UEFA Cup Final riots|Violence]] also occurred between [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] fans (mainly from [[The Herd (hooligan firm)|The Herd]]) and Galatasaray fans before the [[UEFA Cup 1999-00#Final|2000 UEFA Cup final]] in Copenhagen&lt;ref name="arsenalfear"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Arsenal fans fear more violence| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/752001.stm| publisher = BBC News| date = 17 May 2000| accessdate = 2006-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which a Galatasaray fan, an Arsenal fan and a Dane were said to have been stabbed.&lt;ref name="threemorestabbed"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Three more stabbed in Copenhagen| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/752001.stm| publisher = BBC News| date = 18 May 2000| accessdate = 2006-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galatasaray later won the match after a penalty shoot-out.

On 24 May 2001, 50 people were injured when fighting broke out at a match between French club PSG and Galatasaray at the Parc des Princes stadium.[16][17]PSG were initially given a record $571,000 fine, but it was reduced on appeal to $114,000. Galatasaray was initially fined $114,000 by UEFA, but it too was eventually reduced to $28,500.[18] In May 2001, six PSG fans from the Supporters Club, were arrested and charged with assault, carrying weapons, throwing items on the pitch and racism. The six were alleged to have deliberately entered a part of the Parc des Princes stadium where French fans of Turkish origin were standing, in order to attack them. The six were banned from all football stadiums for the duration of their trial.

The 1967 Kayseri Atatürk Stadium Disaster was the worst hooliganism event that has ever happened in Turkey. It resulted in 40 deaths and some 600 were injured. The violence started following provocation of the Kayserispor fans in the half time, whose team went to leading by a goal scored in the first half.Supporters of the two teams threw rocks to each other.Some of the hooligans were also armed with bats and knives.The fleeing crowd caused a stampede in front of the stand exits.The events in the stadium were followed by vandalism in Kayseri and many-days lasting riots in Sivas.

{{Main|Football hooliganism in the United Kingdom}}

There are records of football hooliganism in the UK from the 1880s, and from no later than the 1960s the UK had a worldwide reputation for it&amp;nbsp;– the phenomenon was often dubbed the ''English Disease''.&lt;ref name="LiverpoolUni"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.liv.ac.uk/footballindustry/hooligan.html | title=FIG FACT-SHEET FOUR: HOOLIGANISM | accessdate=20 March 2011 | publisher=Football Industry Group, University of Liverpool}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title='Football Hooliganism: Policing the War on the English Disease' | author=Stott, Clifford | year=2007 | publisher=Pennant Books | isbn=978-1-906015-05-3 | author2=Pearson, Geoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EnglishDiseaseBBC"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6532989.stm | title=The return of the English disease? | accessdate=20 March 2011 | date=6 April 2007 | publisher=BBC | first=Mario | last=Cacciottolo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IndyEnglishDisease"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/leading-articles/another-sorry-outbreak-of-the-english-disease-730590.html | title=Another sorry outbreak of the English disease | accessdate=20 March 2011 | date=17 June 2004 | publisher=The Independent on Sunday | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1970s, many organised hooligan firms sprang up, with most [[Football League]] clubs having at least one known organised hooligan element. Hooliganism was often as its worst when local rivals played each other. Supporters of teams including [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], [[Tottenham Hotspur]], [[Portsmouth F.C|Portsmouth]], [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], [[Leicester City]] and 
[[Bristol City]] were among those most frequently linked to hooliganism.

Racism became a major factor in hooliganism around the same time, as black players became a regular feature in English league teams from the 1970s. Black players were frequently targeted with monkey chants, and had bananas thrown at them. Members of far-right groups including the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]] also sprayed racist slogans and distributed racist literature at matches.

[[Sectarian]] violence has long been a regular factor of crowd violence, as well as offensive chanting, at matches in [[Scotland]] between [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].

As a result of the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]] at [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], in [[1985 European Cup Final|1985]], where Liverpool FC fans rioting led to the death of 39 [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] fans, English clubs were banned from all European competitions until 1990, with Liverpool (the English team present) banned for an additional year.&lt;ref name="hillsboroughjustice"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Michael Moore's Bowling For Columbine and the Hillsborough Justice Campaign | url = http://www.contrast.org/hillsborough/bowling.shtm | publisher = Hillsborough Justice Campaign | accessdate = 2006-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Manchester United hooligan Colin Blaney in his autobiography 'The Undesirables', many of the football hooligan gangs in the UK used hooliganism as a cover for acquisitive forms of crime, specifically theft and burglary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Colin |last=Blaney |title=Undesirables |year=2014 |publisher=John Blake |isbn=978-1782198970 |pages=1–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has also been confirmed in numerous other articles on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Chester |title=Getting Life Lessons From Manchester's Jet-Setting Career Thieves |publisher=Vice Media |date=31 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=J. |last=Sugden |title=Inside the Grafters' Game: An Ethnographic Examination of Football's Underground Economy |publisher=Journal of Sport and Social Issues |date=January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s and well into the 1990s the UK government led a major crackdown on football-related violence. While football hooliganism has been a growing concern in some other European countries in recent years, British football fans now tend to have a better reputation abroad. Although reports of British football hooliganism still surface, the instances now tend to occur at pre-arranged locations including pubs rather than at the matches themselves.

English clubs who have made the headlines for the worst and most frequent cases of hooliganism include Birmingham City (whose multi racial hooligan element gained the nickname "Zulus" from fans of rival teams in the 1970s when football hooligans were almost always white British), Chelsea (whose then chairman [[Ken Bates]] installed an electric fence at the club's stadium in the mid 1980s to combat hooligans, but was refused permission to switch it on during matches), Leeds United (who were banned from European competitions following a riot after the 1975 European Cup final against Bayern München), Liverpool (14 of whose fans were convicted after a riot at the 1985 European Cup final resulted in the deaths of 39 spectators at Heysel Stadium in [[Belgium]] when a stadium wall collapsed, leading to English clubs being banned from European competitions for 5 years), Manchester United (who were booted out of the European Cup Winner's Cup in 1977 after their fans rioted at a game in France, although they were reinstated to the competition on appeal), Millwall (whose most notorious hooliganism incident was in 1985 when their fans rioted in an FA Cup tie at [[Luton]]), Tottenham Hotspur who gained notoriety for the 1974 UEFA Cup Final disturbances and again in Rotterdam in 1983 (who had a section of fans banned from all football grounds in England in 2008 for their racial and homophobic abuse of former player [[Sol Campbell]]) and Wolves (who had dozens of fans convicted of incidents in the late 1980s involving the [[Subway Army]] hooligan firm at matches against teams including Cardiff City and Scarborough when they were in the Fourth Division).

=== Ukraine ===
Football [[hooliganism]] movement in [[Ukraine]] started in the 1980s. The first big fight (more than 800 people) involving football hooligans was registered in September 1987 between [[Dynamo Kyiv]] and [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]] fans in the center of [[Kiev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rusplt.ru/society/okolofutbol-evromaydan-7827.html|title=Родом из советского околофутбола|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1990s passed in relative silence, as there were no big fights between hooligans. The origin of the football hooligan movement in Ukraine started in the mid-90s. On September 5, 1998 an important game between [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] and [[Russia national football team|Russia]]'s national football teams was played. Ukrainian hooligans began to unite in "National crews" to resist Russian fans. However, the mass union did not take place due to police intervention and were mainly composed of Ukrainian fans from [[Kiev]] and [[Dnipropetrovsk]]. In March 2001, several crews united and attacked 80 [[Belarusians|Belarusian]] fans after match between [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] and [[Belarus national football team|Belarus national football]] teams. At that exact time hooligans and ultras were separated, due to changes of views on supporting movement. One part decided to dedicate all time at the tribune to create a choreo in Italian style, and the others decided to remain faithful to English style with fighting and the same wear style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dynamo.kiev.ua/blog/91566-istoriya-i-natsionalnyie-osobennosti-fanatskogo-dvizheniya-ukrainyi-i-rossii|title=История и национальные особенности фанатского движения Украины и России|author=dynamo.kiev.ua|work=Новини Динамо К|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 15 April 2002 about 50 right Dynamo fans attacked [[Jewish]] quarter in [[Kiev]]. First, they stoned small shop and after that throw stoned in synagogue and beat up the head of synagogue and other believers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rus.delfi.ee/archive/v-kieve-skinhedy-razgromili-sinagogu?id=3452154|title=В Киеве скинхеды разгромили синагогу|author=rus.delfi.ee|work=rus.delfi.ee|accessdate=15 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2005 clashes between hooligans occurred mostly outside the city because of the excessive attention of police. During the [[Euro 2012]] several leaders of football hooligans came under government pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/euro-2012/9316682/Dont-judge-a-nation-like-Ukraine-by-its-hooligans.html|title=Don’t judge a nation like Ukraine by its hooligans|date=8 June 2012|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution|Ukrainian revolution 2014]] was announced about unification of all fans and imposed a ban on any provocation as burning attributes, fighting, offensive songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://24tv.ua/ukrayina/obyednannya_ukrayini_uzhe_prodemonstruvali_ultras_i_futbolni_fani__poroshenko/n402531|title=Об'єднання України уже продемонстрували ультрас і футбольні фани, — Порошенко|author=24tv.ua|work=Телеканал новин 24|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[war in eastern Ukraine]] many hooligans and ultras went to the defense of the state.

Because of the ban internal conflicts and successes in the international stage Ukrainian hooligans pay attention to foreign fans. After the match between [[FC Dnipro]] and [[AS Saint-Étienne|Saint Etienne]] in [[Kiev]] several French fans were hospitalized with the stabbing. August 20, 2015 there was a big fight in [[Hydropark (Kiev Metro)|Hydropark]] between [[Legia Warsaw|Legia]] and [[Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo]]&amp;[[Zorya Luhansk|Zorya]] hools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ua.korrespondent.net/kyiv/3553356-u-kyievi-pobylysia-fanaty-dynamo-i-lehii|title=У Києві побилися фанати Динамо і Легії|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest clash since unification occurred in Kiev, 6 December 2016 between [[Dynamo Kiev|Dynamo]] and [[Besiktas]] hooligans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ultras-tifo.net/photo-news/4651-cl-dynamo-kyiv-besiktas-06-12-2016.html|title=CL: DYNAMO KYIV - BESIKTAS 06.12.2016|author=ultras-tifo.net|work=Ultras' news cite|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Turks it was very important match, because win of [[Turkey]] team mean's qualification to the European top stage.

====1920s====
The first murder related with Argentine football occurred on 21 September 1922 in [[Rosario]], during the second half of a match between [[Tiro Federal|Tiro Federal Argentino]] (in its stadium) and [[Newell's Old Boys]] for the Copa Estímulo of the local first division, in a discussion between two fans. Enrique Battcock, a railroad worker and supporter of the home club (also former footballer and former member of the club's directing) was interpellated for Francisco Campá (Newell's Old Boys' supporter and member of the club's directing) for his behaviour, which carried a discussion that ended when Battcock hit in the face to Cambá, who retired from the stadium, returned after a little while, extracted a gun and shot him, causing Battcock's death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://salvemosalfutbol.org/lista-de-victimas-de-incidentes-de-violencia-en-el-futbol/ Victims list] Salvemos al Fútbol&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 November 1924 in [[Montevideo]] ([[Uruguay]]), occurred another murder where an Argentina fan was involved. After the final match of the [[1924 South American Championship|South American Championship]] of this year between Uruguay and Argentina (that Uruguay won), in the Colón Hotel (where the [[Argentine national football team]] was staying) broke out a fight among Uruguay supporters and Argentine fans and footballers, where José Lázaro Rodríguez (a recognized Argentine supporter of Boca Juniors and the national team) shot to Pedro Demby, an Uruguayan fan that died consequently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pelotaafuera.blogspot.com/2009/11/85-anos-de-la-muerte-de-pedro-demby.html To 85 years of the death of Pedro Demby] Pelota Afuera&lt;/ref&gt;

====1930s====
On 14 May 1939 at the stadium of [[Club Atlético Lanús|Lanús]] (in the city of [[Lanús]], in the [[Greater Buenos Aires]]), in a match of the minor divisions of the local team and Boca Juniors (previous to the match of the main teams of both clubs), after a foul committed by a player of Lanús, both teams began to fight. Seeing this, Boca Juniors fans wanted to tear down the fence and invade the pitch, prompting the police to fire shots to disperse them. But a police officer named Luis Estrella shot into the stands, killing two spectators: Luis López and Oscar Munitoli (a 9-year old).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=920643 An undesirable list who grow...] La Nación&lt;/ref&gt;

====1940s====
But this violence was not only among fans, footballers or the police, but also against the referees. On 27 October 1946, during a match between Newell's Old Boys and [[San Lorenzo de Almagro]] at Newell's Old Boys stadium (in the city of [[Rosario]]), local fans tried to strangle the referee Osvaldo Cossio. The match was tied on two goals when Cossio annulled a goal of the premises, and the third goal of San Lorenzo de Almagro in the next play worsened the situation. 89 minutes into the game, several Newell's Old Boys fans entered the pitch, hit the umpire and tried to hang him with his own belt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacapital.com.ar/contenidos/2010/03/17/noticia_0049.html The shortest match of the history] La Capital&lt;/ref&gt;

====1950s====
Although in [[Football in Argentina|Argentine football]] violence was already present from the beginning (late 19th century), the organized groups ([[Barra brava|barras bravas]]) appeared in the 1950s (barras bravas of [[Club Atlético Independiente|Independiente]], [[San Lorenzo de Almagro]], [[Club Atlético Lanús|Lanús]], [[Rosario Central]], [[Club Atlético Vélez Sarsfield|Vélez Sarsfield]], Racing, etc.) and 1960s (barras bravas of [[Club Atlético Belgrano|Belgrano]], Boca Juniors, River Plate, etc.), and continued to grow in the coming decades. With the time, every big and small football club in Argentina started to have its own corresponding barra brava, and all are violent or prepared for violence. In Argentina there are the most dangerous organized supporter groups in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,2816440_page_1,00.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=24 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202124431/http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,2816440_page_1,00.html |archive-date=2 February 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the most powerful of them are the barras bravas of [[Club Atletico Independiente|Independiente]] ([[La barra del Rojo|La Barra Del Rojo]]), [[Club Atlético Boca Juniors|Boca Juniors]] and [[Newell's Old Boys]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/especiales/violenciaenelfutbol/nota1/d-07701.htm |title=Clarín digital &amp;#124; Deportes. River: la barra más temida |publisher=Edant.clarin.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But this phenomenon suffered a major transformation in the late 1950s. The journalist Amílcar Romero sets 1958 as the beginning of the current barras bravas (although some had already existed since some years), with the random murder by the police of Mario Alberto Linker (a Boca Juniors supporter -not identified as such- that circumstantially was watching a match between [[Club Atlético Vélez Sársfield|Vélez Sársfield]] and River Plate at the [[Estadio José Amalfitani|José Amalfitani]] stadium), that was located in the grandstand of River Plate fans when some of them started a fight and the police burst throwing tear gas grenades, one of which hit to Linker in the chest, causing his death. Because of this murder in October 1958, the society notes the existence of this organized groups (the barras bravas). The so-called "industrialization of football" was the kickoff for this organization, because needed to control all aspects involved in the game. Before the emergence of these groups, when a team played as a visitor, was pressured by rival fans. This prompted the organization of the barras bravas in response to that pressure:

{{quote|In Argentine football, it was well established that if you played as the visiting team, you were inexorably in a tight spot. Although they were not barras bravas as we know them today, local fans would pressure you, and the police, when not looking the other way, would pressure you as well. That had to be offset by a doctrine that in the next decade became common currency: the only means by which to neutralize any effectual group with a reputation and capacity for violence, is with another, closer-knit group with as great, or greater, reputation for violence.|source=&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/deportes/8-22673-2003-07-13.html The barras appear with the industrialization of the football] Página/12&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=Amílcar Romero}}

In this way, each club began having his barra brava, which was funded by the leaders of the institution. These groups were given their tickets and paid trips to the stadium, adding later other forms of financing. But the access to these "benefits" by the barra brava depended of the hierarchy inside her. For the barra brava to be prestigious, it had to be violent, so they began to increase the number of dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/especiales/violenciaenelfutbol/nota2/r-02401d.htm The origins of an evil without remedy] Clarín, especial "Violencia en el fútbol"&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Linker, in Argentine football began a phase marked by "habituation" to the violence of the barras bravas, and an increase in the number of deaths. According to Amílcar Romero, between 1958 and 1985, 103 deaths related to football violence took place in Argentina, that is, an average of one every three months. However, it also clarifies that the origin of such deaths is not always confrontation in the stadium, and range from the premeditated clash between barras bravas outside the sporting venues, police repression against disorder, infighting in a barra brava or "accidents", its analysis tends to show some kind of negligence or violation of safety standards.

====1960s====
In 1964 more than 300 football fans died and another 500 were injured in [[Lima]] ([[Peru]]) in a riot during an Olympic qualifying match between Argentina and Perú on 24 May.&lt;ref name="Disasters in soccer stadiums"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/africa/05/09/soccer.chronology |title=Disasters in soccer stadiums |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date=10 May 2001 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 April 1967 in Argentina, before a match between [[Club Atlético Huracán|Huracán]] and Racing de Avellaneda, a Racing fan of 15 years died murdered by the Huracán barra brava&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efdeportes.com/efd8/amilc83.htm The Souto case] EF Deportes&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Estadio Tomás Adolfo Ducó|Tomás Adolfo Ducó]] stadium.

====1980s====
From the 1980s and onwards, the nuclei of the biggest barras bravas began to attend the matches of the Argentina national football team in the [[FIFA World Cup]]s. That caused fights against supporters of other countries (sometimes were hooligans or [[ultras]]) and between the Argentine barras bravas themselves. Also, in the 1980s and the 1990s were recorded the highest levels of violence in the history of the Argentine football, and there was a new phenomenon: the internal fragmentation of the barras bravas. It was produced by the emergence of sub-groups with their own names inside the barras bravas. Sometimes these sub-groups fought among themselves to have the power within the barra brava to which they belonged.

An example of the violence of this years was the Roberto Basile's death. Before the start of a match between Boca Juniors and Racing in 1983 in the ''[[Estadio Alberto J. Armando|Bombonera]]'' stadium, this Racing supporter died after being pierced in the neck by a flare thrown from the Boca Juniors stand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la-redo.net/la-bengala-perdida-15486/ The lost flare] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528143424/http://www.la-redo.net/la-bengala-perdida-15486/ |date=28 May 2010 }} La Redo&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, other supporter of Racing was killed, and the barra brava of Independiente was the main suspect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2002/02/19/d-03401.htm Nobody is taking responsibility and today are football in Racing again] Clarín&lt;/ref&gt; Independiente and Racing (both from the city of [[Avellaneda]], in the [[Greater Buenos Aires]]) have a huge rivalry (they form the [[Avellaneda Derby]]), the second most important in Argentina but maybe the fiercest (noteworthy that their stadiums are apart only for about 300 meters).

The next year, one fan was killed and 12 people injured, including six police officers when fans of [[Racing Club de Avellaneda]] and [[Club Atlético Independiente]] clashed in February 2002.

An Independiente fan was shot dead, and another fan was shot in the back and hospitalized when about 400 rival fans fought outside Racing Clubs [[Estadio Juan Domingo Perón]] in [[Avellaneda]] before the match. Between 70 and 80 people were arrested as a result. The match started late when Independiente fans threw a [[smoke bomb]] at Racing Club [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]], Gustavo Campagnuolo. That same weekend, 30 people were arrested and 10 police officers injured when fighting broke out at a match between [[Estudiantes de La Plata]] and [[Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata]] in [[La Plata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1826408.stm |title=AMERICAS &amp;#124;Football fan killed in Argentina |publisher=BBC News |date=18 February 2002 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 investigation into football hooliganism in [[Argentina]] stated that football violence had become a national crisis, with about 40 people murdered at football matches in the preceding ten years. In the 2002 season, there had been five deaths and dozens of [[knife]] and [[shotgun]] casualties. At one point the season was suspended and there was widespread social disorder in the country. The first death in 2002 was at a match between fierce rivals [[Boca Juniors]] and [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]]. The match was abandoned and one Boca Juniors fan was shot dead. Boca Juniors, one of the largest clubs in Argentina, may have the largest barra brava element in the country (it is similar to the barras bravas of Independiente and River Plate), with their self-styled leader, Rafael Di Zeo, claiming in 2002 that they had over 2000 members (however there are doubts about the reliability of this information).&lt;ref&gt;The Boca group, known as La Doce (''The Twelfth'') has a long history of violence. In 2002 [[Diego Maradona]] was alleged to remain friends with the group's leaders, in spite of their reputation. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/hooligans/2006647.stm Argentine hooligans revere Maradona]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2004, while driving up to [[Rosario]] to watch their side play [[Rosario Central]], Los Borrachos del Tablón (River's Barra Bravas) confronted a bus of Newell's firm (one of the big rival firms) on Highway 9, in a battle that killed two Newell's fans. Up to this day, some members of Los Borrachos still face charges because of the deaths.

In 2005 a footballer, Carlos Azcurra, was shot and seriously wounded by a police officer, when rival fans rioted during a [[Primera B Nacional Argentina|Primera B Nacional]] match between local [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] rivals (but not a derby) [[San Martín de Mendoza]] and [[Godoy Cruz Antonio Tomba]].&lt;ref&gt;At half-time, fans had thrown rocks onto the pitch, and just before the end of the match, fans from both clubs invaded the pitch and started fighting. The players who had stayed on the pitch, including Ezcurra, tried to calm the fans, and he was shot when police tried to stop the fans by firing rubber bullets.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4238844.stm BBC NEWS | World | Americas |Argentine footballer shot in riot&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in Germany, there was a confrontation&lt;ref&gt;[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2006/06/22/deportes/m-01501.htm Agited early morning] Clarín&lt;/ref&gt; between 6 members of the barra brava of Independiente and 16 members of the barras bravas of Boca Juniors and [[Defensa y Justicia]] (both were together) in the [[Czech Republic]] (the country where the three barras bravas were housed). As a result of the fight, a supporter of Boca Juniors had to be hospitalized.

In 2007, during the match of the promotion/relegation playoff of the [[2006–2007 in Argentine football|2006–2007 season]] between [[Club Atlético Nueva Chicago|Nueva Chicago]] and [[Club Atlético Tigre|Tigre]] (in the Nueva Chicago's stadium), broke out a fight between the barras bravas of both teams because, when a penalty was sanctionaty for Tigre (who was winning the match 2–1, a result that relegated to Nueva Chicago to the Second division) in the 92nd minute, the barra brava of Nueva Chicago invaded the pitch and ran on direction to the stand occupied by the supporters of Tigre to attack them. After this, were serious riots near the stadium (not only caused by the barras bravas, but also by ordinary people), and as a result of it, a fan of Tigre died.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.26noticias.com.ar/locura-en-mataderos-matan-a-un-simpatizante-de-tigre-43236.html Madness in Mataderos: kill a supporter of Tigre] 26 Noticias&lt;/ref&gt;

====2010s====
On 19 March 2010 in a bar of Rosario, the ex leader of the [[Newell's Old Boys]] barra brava (Roberto "Pimpi" Camino) was shot and later died in a hospital of that city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacapital.com.ar/contenidos/2010/03/19/noticia_0053.html Shot dead to ''Pimpi'' Camino, ex leader of the barra brava of Newell's] La Capital&lt;/ref&gt; Camino and his sub-group led the barra brava from 2002 to 2009, when they were expelled from it due to their defeat at the hands of another sub-group, which currently dominates [[La Hinchada Más Popular]] (name of the Newell's Old Boys barra brava). Some members of the now main sub-group are the suspects of the murder, and the bar's owners are suspected of helping them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambito.com/noticia.asp?id=514066 War of barras: 5 suspects arrested for the murder of "Pimpi" Camino] Ámbito financiero&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early morning of 4 July 2010 (the next day of the match between Argentina and Germany for quarter-finals of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]]) in [[Cape Town]], South Africa, there was a fight between some integrants of the barras bravas of Independiente and Boca Juniors. During the brawl, one member of the Boca Juniors barra brava lost consciousness after being brutally beating by the Independiente fanatics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://442.perfil.com/2010/07/05/internaron-a-un-barra-en-estado-delicado/ ''Barra'' interned in "delicated state"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709034700/http://442.perfil.com/2010/07/05/internaron-a-un-barra-en-estado-delicado/ |date=9 July 2010 }} Perfil&lt;/ref&gt; He was admitted to a hospital in the city and died there on 5 July.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larazon.com.ar/deportes/Murio-barra-argentino-golpeado-Sudafrica_0_146700063.html Died the Argentina ''barra'' who was beaten in South Africa] La Razón&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 May 2015, in a game between [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] and [[Boca Juniors]] at [[La Bombonera]], hooligans sprayed a substance which irritated River Plate players' eyes, and the game was suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/soccer/story/boca-juniors-vs-river-plate-copa-libertadores-match-suspended-after-players-hit-by-spray-051415|title=Boca Juniors vs. River Plate Copa Libertadores match suspended after players hit by spray|author=Fox Sports|work=FOX Sports|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
Fans in Brazil join in organized groups known as [[torcida organizada|torcidas organizadas]] ("organized supporters") often considered criminal organizations that differ in many aspects from European hooligans. They act as the main supporters of each club and often sell products and even tickets. They have up to 60,000 members and are often involved in criminal activities other than fights such as drug dealing and threats to players. These fans establish alliances with other "torcidas organizadas" as they are called such as the alliance between Torcida Mancha Azul ([[Avaí Futebol Clube]]), Força Jovem Vasco ([[CR Vasco da Gama]]), Galoucura ([[Atlético Mineiro]]) and Mancha Verde ([[SE Palmeiras]]), the alliance between Torcida Independente ([[São Paulo F.C.]]), Torcida Jovem ([[CR Flamengo]]), Máfia Azul ([[Cruzeiro Esporte Clube]]) and Leões da TUF ([[Fortaleza Esporte Clube]]) and some other alliances. The "torcidas organizadas" are usually bigger and more committed to the spectacle in the stadiums than the English hooligan fans&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but they often schedule fights against rival groups where many are injured and killed. Fans of local rivals TJP – Torcida Jovem Ponte Preta ([[Associação Atlética Ponte Preta]]) and TFI -Torcida Fúria Independente ([[Guarani Futebol Clube]]) clashed and rioted at a match in Campinas in 2002. Violence had been expected, and just before kick-off, fans started fighting. Police tried to intervene but were pelted by stones. As the fighting continued inside the stadium, a railing collapsed and numerous fans fell over 13&amp;nbsp;ft (four metres) into a pit between the stands and the pitch. Over 30 people were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2375033.stm |title=Brazil fans plummet into pit |publisher=BBC News |date=30 October 2002 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Porto Alegre]] on South Brazil, [[Grêmio]] and [[Internacional]] fans, have a different way to support their teams with too much beer, no samba, no T-shirt identification, these 2 firms in this big city results in a long history of tension and conflict.
[[PMERJ|Rio de Janeiro State Police]] has a special battalion to deal with torcidas called GEPE (Grupamento Especial de Policiamento em Estádios, Portuguese for Stadium Police Special Unit).

===Uruguay===
Following a 5-0 victory against arch-rivals Nacional in April 2014, Peñarol have undertaken an increasingly violent and unhinged attitude in the Uruguayan Clasico. While losing a championship play-off match against Nacional in June 2015, Peñarol's fans started a riot that delayed the game by 15 minutes before it was called off. In March 2016, Pablo Montiel - a supporter of Nacional - was shot to death by Peñarol fans after walking in the same neighborhood as Peñarol's new stadium named "Campeon del Siglo" (named after an IFFHS award not recognized by FIFA, intended as a petty insult towards Nacional). Ignacio Ruglio, a board member of Peñarol who have openly spread lies about Nacional, was interrogated by police following the murder of Montiel. In November 2016, the Uruguayan Clasico was cancelled before kick-off after Peñarol's supporters started a riot at the Estadio Centenario - one supporter was arrested holding a pistol, intended to shoot down Nacional players from the Amsterdam tribune. After winning a Clasico for Peñarol in September 2017, team captain Cristian Rodriguez openly called for murdering Nacional fans while celebrating the victory.

===El Salvador===
The ''[[Football War]]'' (Spanish: ''La guerra del fútbol''), also known as the ''Soccer War'' or ''100 Hour War'', was a brief war fought by [[El Salvador]] and [[Honduras]] in 1969. It was caused by political conflicts between Hondurans and Salvadorans, namely issues concerning immigration from [[El Salvador]] to [[Honduras]]. These existing tensions between the two countries coincided with the inflamed rioting during the second [[CONCACAF|North American]] [[1970 FIFA World Cup (qualification)#CONCACAF Semifinal Round|qualifying round]] of the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]]. [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]] and [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador]] met in the second [[CONCACAF|North American]] [[1970 FIFA World Cup (qualification)#CONCACAF Semifinal Round|qualifying round]] for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]]. There was fighting between fans at the first game in the Honduran capital of [[Tegucigalpa]] on 8 June 1969, which Honduras won 1–0. The second game, on 15 June 1969 in the Salvadoran capital of [[San Salvador]], which was won 3–0 by El Salvador, was followed by even greater violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Wars and Peace Treaties, 1816–1991 |last=Goldstein |first=Erik |authorlink= |author2= |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn=978-0-203-97682-1 |pages=195–6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VjWnMm53xQ8C&amp;pg=PA195&amp;dq=football+war+honduras+el+salvador# |accessdate=4 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A play-off match took place in [[Mexico City]] on 26 June 1969. El Salvador won 3–2 after [[extra time]].

The war began on 14 July 1969, when the El Salvadoran military launched an attack against Honduras. The [[Organization of American States]] negotiated a cease-fire on the night of 18 July (hence "100 Hour War"), which took full effect on 20 July. El Salvadoran troops were withdrawn in early August. El Salvador dissolved all ties with Honduras, stating that "the government of Honduras has not taken any effective measures to punish these crimes which constitute genocide, nor has it given assurances of indemnification or reparations for the damages caused to Salvadorans".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Thomas P. ''The War of the Dispossessed: Honduras and El Salvador 1969''. p. 105 Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to border clashes between the two nations.

===Mexico===
Football hooliganism in [[Mexico]] appears to be low key, but there have been some incidents, such as small-scale fighting between fans of [[C.F. Monterrey|Monterrey]] and [[Monarcas Morelia|Morelia]] at a [[Primera División de México|Primera División]] match in [[Monterrey]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2992422.stm |title=Fatal Mexican football win |publisher=BBC News |date=15 June 2003 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1998, one man died and several people were injured when Mexico football fans rioted after [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] lost to [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in the [[1998 World Cup|World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/123024.stm |title=One killed in Mexican World Cup riots |publisher=BBC News |date=30 June 1998 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the match, hundreds of riot police were brought in to restore order because fans were looting and rioting. Fans then clashed with the police, and many fans were injured or arrested.  In March 2014 dozens of Chivas supporters clashed with police during their derby with Atlas.  Several police were hospitalized.  As a result, Chivas banned all of their supporters for the Clasico against Club America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccerly.com/article/jonnyrico/chivas-bans-supporter-groups-for-el-clasico-after-violent-acts-in-gdl-derby|title=Chivas Place Indefinite Ban on Supporter Groups After Violent Acts in Derby|author=Jonny Rico  - jonnyrico|work=Soccerly|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
While soccer is traditionally viewed in the United States as a family-friendly event, played by children and supported by parents, some violence does still occur. For junior league soccer, parents can be overzealous and be begrudged over unrelated matters and fights between parents have been documented and reported with police being called and intervening. For major league soccer, on 20 July 2008, in a [[Exhibition game|friendly match]] between [[Major League Soccer]] side [[Columbus Crew]] and English [[Premier League]] club [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], in [[Columbus Crew Stadium|Columbus, Ohio]], a fight broke out between rival fans. Police estimated more than 100 people were involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first= | last= | author2= | title=Crew-West Ham United friendly marred by brawl between fans | date=19 July 2008 | publisher= | url =https://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/2008-07-20-crew-west-ham-friendly_N.htm | work =[[USA Today]] | pages = | accessdate = 2008-07-21 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; An unruly encounter occurred between [[Toronto FC]] fans in 2009, upset from a loss in the [[Trillium Cup]], and [[Columbus Crew]] fans. One Toronto fan was tasered by Columbus police.

That same weekend, a riot was narrowly avoided at a packed [[Giants Stadium]] as members of the [[New York Red Bulls]] supporters club, [[Empire Supporters Club]] (ESC), and members of the [[New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority]] security force clashed over what the ESC claimed was unfair and repeated mistreatment. Clashes also took place in the parking area around the stadium after the game, involving already ejected-for-life North Jersey Firm (NJF) members, and the [[New Jersey State Police]] were called to quell the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first=Ives | last=Galarcep | author2= | title=More mistreatment for Red Bulls fans at Giants Stadium | date=21 July 2008 | publisher= | url =http://www.soccerbyives.net/soccer_by_ives/2008/07/red-bulls-to-bl.html | work =Soccer By Ives | pages = | accessdate = 2008-07-21 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were several arrests, mostly of known NJF hooligans.

===Bangladesh===
Football hooliganism in Bangladesh does not appear to be a major problem. However, in August 2001, 100 people were injured when thousands of football fans rampaged at a [[Bangladesh Professional Football League|B-League]] match between [[Mohammedan Sporting Club (Bangladesh)|Mohammedan Sporting Club]] and Rahmatganj Sporting Club in the [[Bangabandhu National Stadium]], [[Dhaka]]. When the [[referee (association football)|referee]] disallowed a penalty, Mohammedan fans invaded the pitch, throwing stones at the police, who had to fire [[tear gas]] at the fans to try and restore order. Outside the stadium dozens of cars and buses were damaged and set on fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=CBC Sports |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2001/08/11/socceriot010811.html |title=At least 100 injured in Bangladeshi soccer riot |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=11 August 2001 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years earlier, following crowd trouble at a match also in Xi'an, the government demanded more action to stamp out football hooliganism.&lt;ref name="BBC News1892421"/&gt;

In June 2002, riots in [[Fuzhou]], Fujian had to be put down by heavily armed paramilitary police.  The disorder started when fans were unable to watch the [[2002 World Cup|World Cup]] match between [[China national football team|China]] and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] at an outside broadcast.&lt;ref name="BBC News2036050"/&gt; On 4 July 2004 fans rioted in Beijing when [[China national football team|China]] lost the final of the [[AFC Asian Cup]] to [[Japan national football team|Japan]], 3–1.

===India===
In [[India]], most of the documented football riots have primarily taken place in [[Kolkata]]. Everytime the [[Kolkata derby|Calcutta derby]] takes place between [[Mohun Bagan A.C.]] and [[East Bengal F.C.]], tensions arise. However, it has taken the form of escalating violence twice- notably, at [[Eden Gardens]] on 16 August 1980. 16 people lost their lives that day due to a stampede. Another incident took place on 9 December 2012 at the [[Salt Lake Stadium]]. Though nobody was killed, [[Syed Nabi]], a [[Mohun Bagan A.C.]] footballer, was injured by a brick thrown, according to the player, by [[Mohun Bagan A.C.]] supporters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eden Gardens]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/soccer/violence-mars-mohun-bagan-east-bengal-match--2492.html |title=Violence mars Mohun Bagan-East Bengal match |publisher=Indiatvnews.com |date=9 December 2012 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
In the 2000s, tensions surrounding the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] spilled over into sporadic riots between Jewish and Arab Israeli football fans. In December 2000 it was reported that every club in Israel was on a final warning following escalating violence and intimidation at matches.

A number of incidents have involved [[Beitar Jerusalem F.C.|Beitar Jerusalem]], including racist abuse against overseas players,&lt;ref name="sundayherald001224"&gt;{{cite news|title=200 Beitar Jerusalem – Israel |work=Sunday Herald |date=24 December 2000 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20001224/ai_n13953505 |accessdate=2007-05-20 |first=Natasha |last=Woods}}&lt;/ref&gt; anti-Arab chants, use of smoke bombs and fireworks, and rioting. Beitar has a hooligan firm, [[La Familia (Beitar supporters' group)|La Familia]], whose members consider Israeli Arabs to be their enemy. In November 2007 the Israel Football Association (IFA) ordered Beitar to play their game against the Arab club, Bnei Sakhnin behind closed doors after Beitar fans, led by La Familia, broke a minute's silence for former Prime Minister of Israel, Yitzhak Rabin and sang chants in praise of his assassin, Yigal Amir.

Beitar was docked two points and had to play its remaining home games behind closed doors.

Gor Mahia were banned by the Sports Stadia Management Board from playing in their facilities for the rest of the 2012 season, meaning that the club will not be able to play in neither the [[Nyayo National Stadium]] nor the [[Moi International Sports Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kenyanlist.com/kls-listing-show.php?id=82916 |title=Gor Mahia banned from using Sports Stadia facilities. |publisher=KenyanList.com |date=23 March 2012 |accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kassfm.co.ke/news/sports/2323-gor-mahia-banned-from-nyayo-stadium- |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120803170034/http://www.kassfm.co.ke/news/sports/2323-gor-mahia-banned-from-nyayo-stadium- |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-08-03 |title=Gor Mahia Banned from Nyayo Stadium |publisher=Kass FM (kassfm.co.ke) |date= |accessdate=2012-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kenya Premier League|KPL]] Board has yet to announce further disciplinary measures on the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201203300676.html |title=Kenya: Raila Slams Football Hooligans |publisher=allAfrica.com |date=30 March 2012 |accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a 2014 case where Gor Mahia fans are alleged to have injured [[Machakos]] residents and also vandalized property.

===Libya===
Eight fans died and 39 were injured as troops opened fire to stop both pro- and anti-[[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] sentiments being expressed in a Tripoli stadium during a match between [[Al-Ahly (Tripoli)|Al Ahli]] and [[Al-Ittihad (Tripoli)|Al Ittihad]] in December 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/africa/05/09/soccer.chronology/ |title=Disasters in soccer stadiums |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date=10 May 2001 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mali===
After a World Cup qualifying match between [[Mali national football team|Mali]] and [[Togo national football team|Togo]] on 27 March 2005, which Togo won 2–1, Mali fans rioted and went on a spree of destruction and violence. The trouble started when Togo scored the winning goal. Police fired tear gas at Mali fans who had invaded the pitch. The match was abandoned and the result awarded to Togo. The result set off a wave of violence in the capital of Mali, [[Bamako]]. Thousands of Mali fans in Bamako began chanting threats toward the Mali players, cars were set on fire, stores looted, property and monuments destroyed and a building housing the local Olympics committee burnt down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=CBC Sports |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2005/03/28/mali_soccer050328.html |title=Soccer fans riot in Mali over loss |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=28 March 2005 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mauritius===
In May 1999, seven people died when rioting football fans threw [[petrol bomb]]s into a casino, following a match in [[Port Louis]] between the [[Mauritian League]] champions, Scouts Club, and Fire Brigade SC. After the match which Fire Brigade SC won, hundreds of Scouts fans went on a rampage, attacking police vehicles and torching sugar cane fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/351666.stm |title=Mauritian football riots – seven dead |publisher=BBC News |date=24 May 1999 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mozambique===
The government of [[Mozambique]] had to apologise for the violent behaviour of Mozambique fans, before, during and after a match between Mozambique team, [[Clube Ferroviário de Maputo]] and Zimbabwe team, [[Dynamos (Zimbabwe)|Dynamos]] on 10 May 1998. Ferroviário fans attacked the Dynamo players and the referee, stoned vehicles and fought running battles with riot police outside the stadium. Fifteen people, including four [[Red Cross]] workers, needed hospital treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poptel.org.uk/mozambique-news/newsletter/aim134.html#story2 |title=Government apologises for football riots |publisher=Poptel.org.uk |date=19 May 1998 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
In Johannesburg, South Africa, on 14 January 1991, forty people died when fans surged toward a jammed exit to escape rival brawling fans at a match southwest of Johannesburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsbetting-forum.net/general-talk/400-disasters-soccer-stadiums.html|title=Disasters in soccer stadiums|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604211948/http://sportsbetting-forum.net/general-talk/400-disasters-soccer-stadiums.html|archivedate=4 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===south african clasico===
Sundowns had just scored their sixth goal in the 82nd minute at Loftus Stadium on Saturday afternoon when irate Buccaneers supporters invaded the pitch and clashed with Sundowns fans, resulting in several injuries.

Play was stopped for clos&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kickoff.com/news/72963/orlando-pirates-suffer-worst-ever-psl-defeat-6-0-against-mamelodi-sundowns-crowd-violence-pitch-invasion&lt;/ref&gt;e to an hour before the last eight minutes were played, and 6-0 it ended.

===Zimbabwe===
In July 2000 twelve people died following a stampede, when they were crushed, at a World Cup qualifying match between [[Zimbabwe national football team|Zimbabwe]] and [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] in [[Harare]]. Police fired [[tear gas]] when the crowd started throwing missiles onto the pitch, after South Africa had taken a two-goal lead. After [[Delron Buckley]] scored South Africa's second goal bottles began to fly onto the pitch. The police then fired tear gas into the 60,000 crowd, who began running to the exits to escape the effects of the tear gas. The match had to be abandoned as players from both sides felt the effects of the tear gas and had to receive medical treatment. The police were condemned for firing tear gas, calling it a total over-reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/826301.stm |title=Zimbabwe football riot kills 12 |publisher=BBC News |date=9 July 2000 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2002, two fans were shot when police opened fire on rioting fans at a match in [[Bulawayo]].

==Oceania==
===Australia===
Since the formation of the [[A-League]] in 2004, and the fall of the [[National Soccer League]], football hooliganism has died off in competitions and incidents have become a one-off event during seasons.

The incident with most notoriety in Australia is the Pratten Park riot in 1985 where hundreds of fans stormed the pitch midway through a [[Sydney Olympic FC|Sydney Olympic]] v [[Hakoah Sydney City East FC|Sydney City]] match. In a match between [[Melbourne Heart FC|Melbourne Heart]] and [[Melbourne Victory FC|Melbourne Victory]] in February 2013, 17 plastic seats were destroyed and flares were firing off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/2013/02/04/16/03/soccer-fans-destroy-vic-stadium-seats |title=Soccer fans destroy Vic stadium seats |publisher=News.ninemsn.com.au |date=4 February 2013 |accessdate=2013-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206232806/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/2013/02/04/16/03/soccer-fans-destroy-vic-stadium-seats |archivedate=6 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a match between [[Sydney FC]] and Melbourne Victory in November 2013, one travelling Melbourne Victory fan was hospitalised with a stab wound by a sixteen-year-old civilian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/man-stabbed-police-arrest-teenager-after-aleague-soccer-match-in-sydney-20131110-2x9an.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Man stabbed, police arrest teenager after A-League soccer match in Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, a riot between Melbourne Victory and Western Sydney Wanderers broke out at a pub before the match later that day. 
At an international football friendly between [[Australia national association football team|Australia]] and [[Serbian national football team|Serbia]] in [[Melbourne]] in June 2011, fans lit flares both inside and outside the stadium, and in city streets. Banners supporting [[Ratko Mladić]], the Serbian military leader charged with war crimes by the [[International Court of Justice]], were displayed. A laser pointer was seen in use. A seat inside the stadium was deemed damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/sport/soccer/friendly-fire-arrests-as-flares-disrupt-soccer-international-20110608-1frjs.html|title=Friendly fire: arrests as flares disrupt soccer international|publisher=The Age | location=Melbourne|date=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/police-angry-after-fans-let-off-flares-during-australia-v-serbia-match/story-fn7x8me2-1226071403244|title=Police flag heftier penalties for fans lighting flares at the soccer|publisher=Herald Dun}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011, Victoria Police said they were reluctant to cover Melbourne Victory games because of unacceptable behaviour by fans.

Although it is nothing like football hooliganism in Europe (or what it used to be), anti-social events occur somewhat rarely. A primary example would be the Bourke Street Brawl between Melbourne Victory and Western Sydney Wanderers fans, who gathered in numbers before a match in late 2013 and had a brawl in Melbourne, concerning many who are involved with football in Australia and authorities. There are small hooligan/casual groups in Australia, the most prominent being from the League's biggest fanbases, Melbourne Victory, Sydney FC and Western Sydney Wanderers though others exist within other supporter groups.

==Media portrayal==
Football hooliganism has been depicted in films such as ''[[I.D. (1995 film)|ID]]'', ''[[The Firm (1989 film)|The Firm]]'', ''[[Cass (2008 film)|Cass]]'', ''[[The Football Factory (film)|The Football Factory]]'', ''[[Green Street (film)|Green Street]]'', ''[[Rise of the Footsoldier]]'', ''[[Awaydays]]'', ''[[The Brothers Grimsby]]'' and ''[[Eurotrip]]''. There are also many books about hooliganism, such as ''[[The Football Factory (novel)|The Football Factory]]'' and ''[[Among the Thugs]]''. Some critics argue that these media representations glamorise violence and the hooligan lifestyle.

'''''Eurydice''''' was a [[France|French]] [[List of submarines of France|submarine]], one of nine of the {{Sclass-|Daphné|submarine|4}}.

On 4 March 1970,  while diving in calm seas off [[Cape Camarat]] in the [[Mediterranean]], {{convert|35|mi}} east of [[Toulon]], a geophysical laboratory picked up the shock waves of an underwater explosion. French and Italian search teams found an oil slick and a few bits of debris, including a part that bore the name ''Eurydice''.

The cause of the explosion was never determined. All 57 crew were lost.

The 19th-century philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] is known as a critic of [[Judeo-Christian]] morality and religions in general. One of the arguments he raised against the truthfulness of these doctrines is that they are based upon the concept of [[free will]], which, in his opinion, does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;B. Leiter, ''Routledge Philosophy GuideBook to Nietzsche on Morality'', Routledge 2002, p. 68-69: "He also ''shares'' with the Materialists a blanket repudiation of the idea of free will." [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbeGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA68&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SimAY6RRK9&amp;sig=t5B7vVeXlOWDMu6I5m3gTA_hZGk&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6SFsVbqHNoG0sgHZ5oDwBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Online text here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 26, tr. [[H. L. Mencken]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schopenhauer==
In ''[[The Gay Science]]'', Nietzsche praises [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s "immortal doctrines of the intellectuality of intuition, the apriority of the law of causality, (...) and the non-freedom of the will,&lt;ref&gt;''[https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/n/nietzsche/friedrich/n67j/book2.html The Gay Science]'', 99, tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;" which have not been assimilated enough by the disciples. Following is, then, the short description of those views of the latter philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. B. Leiter, ''Routledge Philosophy GuideBook to Nietzsche on Morality'', Routledge 2002, p. 59: "Schopenhauer's picture is, in fact, richer than this, and important for understanding Nietzsche." [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbeGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SimAY6RRK9&amp;sig=t5B7vVeXlOWDMu6I5m3gTA_hZGk&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6SFsVbqHNoG0sgHZ5oDwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Online text here]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The principle of causality===
In ''Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason'' Schopenhauer claimed to prove &amp;ndash; in accordance with [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and against [[David Hume|Hume]] &amp;ndash; that causality is present in the perceivable reality as its principle, i.e. it precedes and enables human perception (so called [[apriority]] of the principle of causality), and thus it is not just an observation of something likely, statistically frequent, which however does not happen "on principle" ([[empiricism]] of the principle of causality). More on this dispute in philosophy can be found in the article on [[Free will#Free will and views of causality|free will]].

===Physical freedom===
In his treatise ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Schopenhauer calls the fact that we can do whatever we will a physical freedom, i.e. lack of physically present obstacles, which is not identical with moral freedom.&lt;ref name="OFW"&gt;Schopenhauer, ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', 1839, c. 1 (explanation of terms), "What is meant by freedom?". [http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam032/98022360.pdf First chapter online]&lt;/ref&gt; Physically "free" means: one acting according only to one's will; if attempts are made to use this term to the will itself, the question arises: "is will itself willed?," "do you will the will to become so-and-so?". It is therefore a specific aspect of the claim of freedom, in which it is stressed whether the course of consciousness follows indeed in a willed way. The problem of willing the will appears in ''Thus spake Zarathustra'', for instance in the chapter "Backworldsmen."&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/thusspakezarathu01998gut/spzar10.txt Thus spake Zarathustra]'', "The backworldsmen", tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Necessity vs. contingency===
In ''On the Freedom of the Will'', Schopenhauer demonstrates the (well known in philosophy) distinction between necessity and contingency.&lt;ref name="OFW"/&gt; He calls "necessary" what follows from a given sufficient basis&lt;ref&gt;Such sufficient basis can then be transcribed as the presence of all the necessary conditions of the occurrence of an effect. As long as it is possible to point out some necessary conditions of an event or state, so long there also exists a sufficient basis, which in case of its occurrence will work with necessity; it is dictated by logic. ''Cf.'' there, c. 4 ("Precursors"), a quote from Hobbes. This does not preclude the inclusion of an accurate realization of a certain random variable in a sufficient basis.&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. that what is already certain – if one knows that the sufficient cause is present). On the other hand, one calls "contingent"&lt;ref&gt;''Zufällig'' is the German adjective combining all the meanings of chance, randomness, fortuity, and contingency; the same situation in several other European languages. Perhaps ''fortuitous'' or ''random'' to something could better suit the intuitive meaning, and such translation of this scholastic term is sometimes used. The term is sometimes used in a misleading way so that it denotes in general all "instances [products] of a rule" (which are indeed contingent to each other), and then lack of necessity is triumphantly announced (like in the case of St. Thomas Aquinas), whereas one in fact agrees that there are still causes (so another connection-by-necessity must exist); this is the so-called relative fortuity of events. For Schopenhauer it is the starting point for discussion about absolute fortuity and lack of causes.&lt;/ref&gt; or "incidental" (with regard to a sufficient basis) that what does not follow from the latter (so e.g. two unconnected events can be contingent to each other: like when a black cat crosses the street and one's job is lost on the same day). As ''moral'' freedom means lack of necessity, it would mean a lack of ''any'' basis: it "would have to be defined as ''absolutely contingent''",&lt;ref name="OFW"/&gt; i.e. an '''[[Indeterminism#Philosophy|absolute fortuity, or chance]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;The above-mentioned classification of phenomena in Schopenhauer's works is not really a methodology or a kind of optics, but simply a notice that either an event or a state is determined (by another, by anything) or it is not (by another, by anything; like in case of a choice when all its directing forces – will, values, all emotional aspects – are rejected or unworking). Thus philosophers even before Schopenhauer have already thought that everything is either necessary or fortuitous and as much as one does not apply, the other does; so for instance in Kant's ''Critique of Pure Reason'', where the distinction is one of categories of reason.&lt;/ref&gt;

The question about the freedom of will is thus the question whether something depends on another thing (a state, an event), i.e. is in some way determined by it, or does not depend on anything (then we call it a chance). Or, in other words, whether something can be predicted: whether it is certain (given the presence or absence of the sufficient cause) or not. Cf. Luther's argument: for him everything is a necessity because the Creator knows it already.

==Nietzsche's analysis==

===Power of will===
In ''Beyond Good and Evil'' Nietzsche criticizes the concept of free will both negatively and positively.&lt;ref name="BGE"&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft_djvu.txt Beyond Good and Evil]'', 21, tr. H. Zimmern&lt;/ref&gt; He calls it a folly resulting from extravagant pride of man; and calls the idea a ''crass stupidity''. The latter probably relates to ordinary-man's visions about a god who (after the ellapse of eternal waiting) creates the world and then waits and observes (being, however, still "beyond time"): and then he is surprised and subdued by what one does.&lt;ref&gt;Why then it does not surprise man? Cf. the so-called [[Argument from free will|paradox of omniscience]], according to which there is a contradiction between visions of a live and free God and omniscience or even the possibility of omniscience.&lt;/ref&gt; (This vision is brought up by Nietzsche in ''The Antichrist''.)&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 48, tr. H. L. Mencken.&lt;/ref&gt;

Next, he argues that free will generally represents an error of ''causa sui'':&lt;ref&gt;That is, "X is the cause of X" &amp;ndash; whereas "cause" should in philosophy be usually something else than effect. The terms ''causa sui'' (cause of self, here considered a fallacy), ''causa prima'' (first cause), and absolute randomness have a common logical sense with respect to states and events in the universe, but occur in different philosophical contexts and with different aspects of meaning and associations.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The &lt;u&gt;desire&lt;/u&gt; for "freedom of will" in the superlative, metaphysical sense, such as still holds sway, unfortunately, in the minds of the half-educated, the desire to bear the entire and ultimate responsibility for one's actions oneself, and to absolve God, the world, ancestors, chance, and society therefrom, involves nothing less than to be precisely this ''causa sui'', and, with more than Munchausen daring, to pull oneself up into existence by the hair, out of the slough of nothingness.&lt;ref name="BGE"/&gt;}}

Finally, he suggests that the only ''real'' thing about will is whether it is strong (i.e. hard to break) or weak:

{{Quotation|The "non-free will" is mythology; in real life it is only a question of ''strong'' and ''weak'' will.&lt;ref name="BGE"/&gt;}}

Nothing is (or can be) fully resistant to stimula, for that would mean it is immutable: whereas nothing in this world is or can be immutable.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.handprint.com/SC/NIE/GotDamer.html Twilight of the Idols]'', c. 3, sect. 2, tr. W. Kaufmann &amp;amp; R.J. Hollingdale.&lt;/ref&gt; He therefore continues here the Schopenhauer's issue of physical freedom: "whether you will, what you willed to will".&lt;ref&gt;The composition actually already known to Hegel, in ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]'', 27, written in 1821. In Schopenhauer's essay an infinite regression arises upon considering this issue, when one assumes the fixed answer Yes to the question about freedom; so a logical fallacy occurs. This already can suggest that there is a problem with searching for cause of everything one does in consciousness.&lt;/ref&gt;

Will is generally considered a mental power. "Freedom" of will could then be interpreted as: power of will (cf. the appropriate passus from ''The Antichrist'', where Nietzsche generally opposes will-based psychology&lt;ref name="A14"&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist The Antichrist]'', 14, tr. H. L. Mencken.&lt;/ref&gt;). Will has power over actions, over many things; therefore, things are ''determined'' by will. But is this power unlimited? Does will rule without itself being ruled? (And further: does a Christian want to sin?) &amp;ndash; Nietzsche disagrees. A godless man becomes pious out of "grace", he did not want it; and likewise a pious man becomes godless with no merit or guilt. Nietzsche suggests in many places that if a pious man loses faith, it is because of the power of his ''values'' over him, of the will for truthfulness...

==="Me", will, and chance===
[[Volition (psychology)|Will]] is something that determines human acts, thoughts etc.  It is will what makes man reluctant to toss a coin for something (cf. ''The Antichrist'' about Christians: "in point of fact, they simply do what they cannot help doing"&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist The Antichrist]'', 44, tr. H. L. Mencken.&lt;/ref&gt;). The problem is, whether it is itself ruled? And here two terms which complicate the picture appear: the term "me" and "chance" (i.e. something independent from anything, beyond control).

The term "me" (as in the statements "it's up to me", "it is ''you'' who willed that") had already been recognized as empty in the preface of ''Beyond Good and Evil''&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft_djvu.txt Beyond Good and Evil]'', Preface, tr. H. Zimmern.&lt;/ref&gt; (or as connected with the ''superstition about the soul''). Later Nietzsche stated more clearly that it was a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] ("what will I do? what will my decision be?" &amp;ndash; "it's up to ''you''" &amp;ndash; that actually means: your decision depends on your decision, something happens in your mind and not somewhere else...). See e.g. ''On the Genealogy of Morals'':&lt;ref&gt;''[http://home.sandiego.edu/~janderso/360/genealogy1.htm On the Genealogy of Morals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008192122/http://home.sandiego.edu/~janderso/360/genealogy1.htm |date=2014-10-08 }}'', treatise I, 13, tr. W. Kaufmann.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|For, in just the same way as people separate lightning from its flash and take the latter as an ''action'', as the effect of a subject which is called lightning, so popular morality separates strength from the manifestations of strength, as if behind the strong person there were an indifferent substrate, which is ''free'' to express strength or not. But there is no such substrate; &lt;u&gt;there is no "being" behind the doing, acting, becoming&lt;/u&gt;. "The doer" is merely made up and added into the action &amp;ndash; the act is everything. People basically duplicate the action: &lt;u&gt;when they see a lightning flash, that is an action of an action: they set up the same event first as the cause and then yet again as its effect&lt;/u&gt;. (...) "We weak people are merely weak. It's good if we do nothing; ''we are not strong enough for that''" &amp;ndash; but this bitter state, this shrewdness of the lowest ranks, which even insects possess (when in great danger they stand as if they were dead in order not to do "too much"), has, thanks to that counterfeiting and self-deception of powerlessness, dressed itself in the splendour of a self-denying, still, patient virtue, &lt;u&gt;just as if the weakness of the weak man himself&lt;/u&gt; &amp;ndash; that means his ''essence'', his actions, his entire single, inevitable, and irredeemable reality &amp;ndash; &lt;u&gt;is a voluntary achievement, something willed, chosen, an ''act'', ''something of merit''&lt;/u&gt;.}}

The same however can be applied to the ''moral'' weakness of a Christian (his lack of resistance), who would certainly prefer not to sin and would construct himself otherwise if he could. "And many a one can command himself, but still sorely lacketh self-obedience!"&lt;ref&gt;''[https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/n/nietzsche/friedrich/n67a/part1.html#chapter3 Thus spake Zarathustra]'', tr. T. Common, "Old and new tables", 4.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; Nietzsche criticizes the idea of "free choice", and even of "choice" in general (cf. the end of above quotation): man does not want to "choose", man wants to affirm himself ("[[will to power]]").&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Belfiore, ''The Triadic Structure of the Mind: Outlines of a Philosophical System'' (2nd edition), Univ. Press of America, 2014, p. 380: "My comment is that Nietzsche, as I point out elsewhere (...), conceived the will to power as the expression of the outward/selfish desire of the agent to affirm and impose on others his apirations, interests and preferences, regardless to any inward/moral thought and feeling." See also on p. 472: "Again with regard to the &amp;laquo;will to power&amp;raquo;, he held that &amp;laquo;A living thing seeks above all to ''discharge'' its strength &amp;ndash; life itself is ''will to power''; self-preservation is only one of the indirect and most frequent ''results''&amp;raquo;."&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem is the role of chance. Unless the change brought to man is too big, a chance is generally responded by will, ''wherever there is will''. He calls it "the redemption (of chance)". This topic dawns as early as in ''Human, All Too Human'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[s:Human All-Too-Human#SECOND DIVISION - The History Of The Moral Sentiments.|Human, All Too Human'', 173, under the topic: ''Corriger la fortune'' (to correct a chance), tr. R.J. Hollingdale.]]&lt;/ref&gt; and it returns in many places of ''Zarathustra''. For instance in part 3 it is discussed as follows:

::I am Zarathustra the godless! I cook every chance in my pot. And only when it hath been quite cooked do I welcome it as my food.
::&lt;u&gt;And verily, many a chance came imperiously unto me: but still more imperiously did my Will speak unto it&lt;/u&gt; (...)&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/thusspakezarathu01998gut/spzar10.txt Thus spake Zarathustra]'', "The Bedwarfing Virtue", 3, tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier in this part:

::The time is now past when accidents ''[Zufälle]'' could befall me; and what could not fall to my lot which would not already be mine own!"&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', "The Wanderer".&lt;/ref&gt;

To cut it short, if it was always that "''we'' choose a chance", then there would be determinism (for "we", "we ourselves" means: our will and its filtering and determining capabilities). And since it happens otherwise ("a chance chooses us"), then there is indeterminism. But the latter case means we have no will in a topic, i.e. it is at that time morally indifferent to us, ''adiaphora'', not opposed to anything (and therefore even more there is no guilt).

===Necessity in man. What is "unfree will"?===
Since free will is discussed, it must obviously be some restricted reality (if "freedom" meant "everything," there would be no need for a separate word). What follows? That there must be events ''external'' to one's freedom: therefore, besides "free will" there should also consequently be "unfree will." Although Nietzsche considers both terms entirely fictional, he gives some clues about the ''psychological'' reality behind them:

{{Quotation|When man experiences the conditions of power, the imputation is that he is not their cause, that he is ''not responsible'' for them &amp;mdash; they come without being willed, consequently we are not their author: &lt;u&gt;the will that is not free (i.e., the consciousness that we have been changed without having willed it)&lt;/u&gt; needs an ''external'' will.&lt;ref&gt;''The Will to Power'', Book II ("Critique of highest values hitherto"), I. Critique of religion, 1. Genesis of Religions, &amp;sect;135, where he demonstrates the notion of "unfree will" as crucial to the emergence of many religious explanations. Vintage Books edition, September, 1968, tr. W. Kaufmann &amp;amp; R.J. Hollingdale. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Magi-iz7kIQC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;dq=&amp;quot;136+(March-June+1888)&amp;quot;&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OcKHVB3dib&amp;sig=-9HqUzdC-rG-EJGaHY9P1NVGLwM&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6bUfVLCeEKT9ywP4_YKgAg&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22136%20(March-June%201888)%22&amp;f=false Online version here]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In short, an unexpected change. Now, going back to the mentioned definition, [[randomness|chance]] means: that what cannot be predicted. If randomness affects a man (unsubjugated, reaching even the surface of his consciousness), then "unfree will" occurs. Thus, whenever we call something free, we ''feel'' something free, in short: wherever we feel our power, it is deterministic, it is a necessity. And indeed Nietzsche says it with the mouth of Zarathustra:

::Out into distant futures, which no dream hath yet seen, into warmer souths than ever sculptor conceived, &amp;mdash; where gods in their dancing are ashamed of all clothes: (...)
::Where all time seemed to me a blessed mockery of moments, &lt;u&gt;where necessity was freedom itself, which played happily with the goad of freedom:&lt;/u&gt; &amp;mdash;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/thusspakezarathu01998gut/spzar10.txt Thus spake Zarathustra]'', "Old and new tables", 2, tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same in ''Beyond Good and Evil'':

{{Quotation|Artists have here perhaps a finer intuition; they who know only too well that precisely when they no longer do anything "arbitrarily," and everything of necessity, their feeling of freedom, of subtlety, of power, of creatively fixing, disposing, and shaping, reaches its climax &amp;mdash; in short, that necessity and "freedom of will" are then the same thing with them.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft_djvu.txt Beyond Good and Evil]'', 213, tr. H. Zimmern.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===The universe indeterministic?===
Yet in another part of ''Zarathustra'' Nietzsche claims that when we look long-term enough and from the bird's-eye perspective of supreme powers big enough, a chance is unimportant, because it is subject to and step-by-step softened and arranged by natural laws and necessities which constitute the order of the world and evolution:

{{Quotation|If ever a breath hath come to me of the creative breath, &lt;u&gt;and of the heavenly necessity which compelleth even chances to dance star-dances&lt;/u&gt;: (...)&lt;ref name=TSZ3&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/thusspakezarathu01998gut/spzar10.txt Thus spake Zarathustra]'', "The Seven Seals", 3, tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To Nietzsche everything in this world is an expression of will to power.&lt;ref&gt;K. Gemes, J. Richardson, ''The Oxford Handbook of Nietzsche'', Oxford Univ. Press, 2013, p. 177-178 ("The Duality of Nietzsche's Theory of the Will to Power: The Psychological and Cosmological Aspects"). [https://books.google.com/books?id=yZmJAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA177&amp;redir_esc=y&amp;f=false Read online here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''[https://archive.org/stream/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft_djvu.txt Beyond Good and Evil]'', 36, tr. H. Zimmern.&lt;/ref&gt; To exist is to represent will to power, to ''cause influence'' (compare similar views of Protagoras' disciples in Plato's ''Theaetetus''). One can cause influence only on something that exists. Therefore, (through induction) an act changes everything from that moment onwards. If one thing was otherwise, everything would have to be otherwise (and generally also backwards).&lt;ref name="TI_humanact"&gt;This belief, perhaps not 100% deterministic, is explicitly expressed in ''Twilight of the Idols'', "Morality as Anti-Nature", 6, tr. W. Kaufmann &amp;amp; R.J. Hollingdale: "To say to him, &amp;laquo;Change yourself!&amp;raquo; is to demand that everything be changed, even retroactively."&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to [[G. K. Chesterton|Chesterton]]'s views, this general rule is not precluded even by absolute chances: they of course change the course of the world too, but still: if one thing was set otherwise, everything would have to be otherwise.&lt;ref name="TI_humanact"/&gt;

Several scholars have argued that Nietzsche was not a determinist in his views of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Solomon, ''The Journal of Nietzsche Studies'' 23 (2002), p. 64 ("Nietzsche on Freedom and Fatalism"). [https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/journal_of_nietzsche_studies/v023/23.1solomon.html Online text here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Leiter|B. Leiter]], ''Nietzsche on morality'' (2nd edition), Routledge 2015, p. 66. [https://books.google.com/books?id=hBDEBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA66&amp;f=false Online text here]
&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Zarathustra'', absolute randomness (maybe not as the essence of reality, but as a part thereof) can be thought of, yes, perhaps it even exists:

{{Quotation|Verily, it is a blessing and not a blasphemy when I teach that "above all things there standeth the heaven of chance, the heaven of innocence, the heaven of hazard, the heaven of wantonness.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft_djvu.txt Thus spake Zarathustra]'', "Before sunrise", tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Issues of responsibility and morality===
Because ''causa sui'' is according to Nietzsche a nonsense, even to a chance could get a basis attributed (only "the whole" has no basis), and it would be "divine dice" (or "Divine Plan"):

::If ever I have played dice with the gods at the divine table of the earth, so that the earth quaked and ruptured, and snorted forth fire-streams: &amp;ndash;
::&amp;ndash; For a divine table is the earth, and trembling with new active dictums and dice-casts of the gods: (...)&lt;ref name=TSZ3/&gt;

To Nietzsche no one is responsible either for the necessities (laws and powers) he represents, or for chances he encounters (which conquer him unwillingly &amp;ndash; and which, as things totally independent from anything, only the "supreme being" could change); after all, no one is absolutely and completely resistant, there can always happen something which changes one deeply enough.

From ''The Dawn of Day'':

{{Quotation|To tranquillise the sceptic. &amp;ndash; "I don't know at all what I am doing. I don't know in the least what I ought to do!" You are right, but 
be sure of this: you are being done at every moment! Mankind has at all times mistaken the active for the passive: it is its eternal grammatical blunder.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/dawnofday029675mbp/dawnofday029675mbp_djvu.txt The Dawn of Day]'', 120, tr. J. M. Kennedy.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''Twilight of the Idols'' Nietzsche discusses [[fatalism]] and responsibility in these words:

{{Quotation|What alone can our teaching be? &amp;ndash; That no one gives a man his qualities, neither God, nor society, nor his parents and ancestors, nor ''he himself'' (the latter absurd idea here put aside has been taught as "intelligible freedom" by Kant, perhaps also by Plato). &lt;u&gt;''No one'' is responsible for existing at all&lt;/u&gt;, for being formed so and so, for being placed under those circumstances and in this environment. His own destiny cannot be disentangled from the destiny of all else in past and future. He is ''not'' the result of a special purpose, a will, or an aim, the attempt is ''not'' here made to reach an "ideal of man," an "ideal of happiness," or an "ideal of morality;" &amp;ndash; &lt;u&gt;it is absurd to try to ''shunt off'' man's nature towards some goal&lt;/u&gt;. We have invented the notion of a "goal:" in reality a goal is ''lacking'' . . . We are necessary, we are part of destiny, we belong to the whole, we ''exist'' in the whole, &amp;ndash; &lt;u&gt;there is nothing which could judge, measure, compare, or condemn our being, for that would be to judge, measure, compare, and condemn the whole&lt;/u&gt; . . . ''But there is nothing outside the whole! &amp;ndash; This only is the grand emancipation'': that no one be made responsible any longer, that the mode of being be not traced back to a ''causa prima'', that the world be not regarded as a unity, either as sensorium or as "spirit;" &amp;ndash; it is only thereby that the ''innocence'' of becoming is again restored . . . The concept of "God" has hitherto been the greatest ''objection'' to existence . . . We deny God, we deny responsibility by denying God: it is only ''thereby'' that we save the world. &amp;ndash;&lt;ref name="TI_fw"&gt;''[http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/The_Case_of_Wagner_v11_1000198930/165 Twilight of the Idols] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303214453/http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/The_Case_of_Wagner_v11_1000198930/165 |date=2016-03-03 }}'', "The Four Great Errors", 8, tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Free will as a psychological error===
Nietzsche's critique of free will has essentially two aspects: one is philosophical (fatalistic), and the other is psychological.&lt;ref name="NTotW"&gt;[[Brian Leiter|B. Leiter]], ''Nietzsche's Theory of the Will'', p. 1. [[Philosophers' Imprint]] v. 7, no. 7, September 2007. [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/p/pod/dod-idx/nietzsche-s-theory-of-the-will.pdf?c=phimp;idno=3521354.0007.007 Online text here]&lt;/ref&gt; Fatalism lets Nietzsche theoretically prove the error of moral doctrines, which &amp;ndash; most generally speaking &amp;ndash; would require that a sinner changed his destiny (for instance by changing the laws of nature, influencing chances which lie completely beyond the extent of his influence), which is by definition impossible. But such theory would not be convincing enough if at the same time the impression of control was not removed, as well as the ever renewed attempts at associating it with the "freedom of will" and building a philosophy out of that. Thus a psychological critique is needed.

If one agrees that the "freedom of will" denotes the power of will which rules but is not itself ruled, then it would at bottom be enough to prove that it is not will what governs human behaviour in order to abolish the very term, to prove that "it is not there". And Nietzsche went on to this.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' (Leiter), p. 12 ("The Real Genesis of Action").&lt;/ref&gt; For Nietzsche the term "will" is psychologically strictly connected with the term "aim" (he often combines the two), maybe even they are identical to him.&lt;ref name="WTP"&gt;Cf. ''The Will to Power'', Book II ("Critique of highest values hitherto"), I. Critique of philosophy, 238: on "psychology which ... searched for will (i.e. aim) behind every act."&lt;/ref&gt; Aim could then be interpreted, according to a common definition, as planning and intellectual foreseeing&lt;ref&gt;The intellect in philosophy was by the way usually presented as working causally and, in principle, learning in course of life to associate the appropriate causes and effects. It was thus understood e.g. by Schopenhauer (cf. F. C. White, ''On Schopenhauer's Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason'', c. 4: "Perception," p. 42: Brill Academic Pub, 1991; [https://books.google.com/books?id=95X3LSZ9O04C&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Z4t8t3huF0&amp;sig=_yZNYjtOD8g49uNcKKxGql5cn9w&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o7gTVOfLEcvTPI_TgLgE&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false read online]). The more thus the phenomena of will and aim would have a deterministic foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; (of especially effects); according to Nietzsche first and foremost the anticipation of acts which in fact do not need to follow by its virtue from aiming (which is here foreseeing).

In ''Twilight of the Idols'' Nietzsche demonstrates the ''error of false causality'' just before the ''error of free will'':

{{Quotation|Of these "inward facts" that seem to demonstrate causality, the primary and most persuasive one is that of &lt;u&gt;the will as cause&lt;/u&gt;. The idea of consciousness ("spirit") or, later, that of the ego ''[I]'' (the "subject") as a cause are only afterbirths: first the causality of the will was firmly accepted as proved, as a fact, and these other concepts followed from it. But we have reservations about these concepts. &lt;u&gt;Today we no longer believe any of this is true&lt;/u&gt;. (...) The so-called motives: another error. &lt;u&gt;Merely a surface phenomenon of consciousness, something shadowing&lt;ref&gt;"Accompanying" in original.&lt;/ref&gt; the deed&lt;/u&gt; that is more likely to hide the causes of our actions than to reveal them. (...)&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.handprint.com/SC/NIE/GotDamer.html Twilight of the Idols]'', "The Four Great Errors", 3, tr. W. Kaufmann &amp;amp; R.J. Hollingdale.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

and then, in the section directly regarding free will, he observes:

{{Quotation|Men were considered "free" only so that they might be considered guilty &amp;ndash; could be judged and punished: consequently, &lt;u&gt;every act had to be considered as willed, and the origin of every act had to be considered as lying within the consciousness&lt;/u&gt; (and thus the most fundamental psychological deception was made the principle of psychology itself).&lt;ref&gt;There, sect. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Similarly in ''The Antichrist'': "the will no longer &amp;laquo;acts,&amp;raquo; or &amp;laquo;moves&amp;raquo;...", "the term no longer denotes any power".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 14, tr. H. L. Mencken. The latter is a mistranslation by Mencken (in original: ''kein Vermögen mehr verstanden werden darf'').&lt;/ref&gt; This non-deriving of acts straight way out of aims, which are just foreseeing (the accompanying self-consciousness of that what is to come), but searching for their sources elsewhere (for example in reflexes, habits, urges) is to Nietzsche even one of major differences between medieval (Thomist) and modern psychology.&lt;ref name="WTP"/&gt;

==Nietzsche's conclusions==

===About man and freedom===
In ''The Antichrist'' Nietzsche argues that man should be considered no otherwise than as a machine.&lt;ref name="A14"/&gt; Even if some generic chaos (randomness) is added to the picture, it does not affect this. A chance is innocent.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 25, tr. H. L. Mencken "Chance robbed of its innocence; unhappiness polluted with the idea of “sin”; well-being represented  as a danger, as a “temptation”; a physiological disorder produced by the canker worm of conscience....".&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche points out the weakness of human as well as of God. Man wills the good, "God" wills the good, and yet evil happens.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/n/nietzsche/friedrich/n67j/book5.html The Gay Science]'', 346, tr. T. Common. "We have become saturated with the conviction (and have grown cold and hard in it) that things are not at all divinely ordered in this world, nor even according to human standards do they go on rationally, mercifully, or justly: we know the fact that the world in which we live is ungodly, immoral, and &amp;laquo;inhuman&amp;raquo;, (...)".&lt;/ref&gt; So where is this "freedom" (i.e. power) of will? And where is this good God?&lt;ref&gt;In ''Ecce Homo'', "Why I am so wise", 3, tr. Duncan Large he repeated after Stendhal: "God's only excuse is that he doesn't exist." Due to the lack of free will the [[theodicee]] (defence of divine goodness) based on indeterminism becomes void.&lt;/ref&gt;

===About good and evil===
These two human valuations refer to things essentially mixed with each other and interdependent. Good causes the evil, and evil causes the good.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. "[http://www.thenietzschechannel.com/works-pub/bge/bgefhm.htm The Aftersong]" in ''Beyond Good and Evil'' or "[https://archive.org/stream/thusspakezarathu01998gut/spzar10.txt The Seven Seals]", 4 in ''Zarathustra''.&lt;/ref&gt; The dichotomy between a good God and an evil satan is a "dualistic fiction."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 17, tr. H. L. Mencken.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Twilight of the Idols'' (see the quote above) and later in ''The Antichrist''&lt;ref name="A2638"&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 26 &amp;amp; 38 about the moral order of the world.&lt;/ref&gt; all concepts which explain life as a test or raise an (externally reasonable) moral "task," "purpose" or the "will of God" are considered false. They are a part of the "error of free will"&lt;ref name="TI_fw"/&gt; consisting in incomprehension of [[fatalism|fatalism of life]], i.e. the fact that it is shaped by higher forces.

===About organized religion===
Religion is a form of controlling people:&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 38. "We know, our conscience now knows &amp;ndash; just what the real value of all those sinister inventions of priest and church has been and what ends they have served, with their debasement of humanity to a state of self-pollution, the very sight of which excites loathing, &amp;ndash; the concepts &amp;laquo;the other world,&amp;raquo; &amp;laquo;the last judgment,&amp;raquo; &amp;laquo;the immortality of the soul,&amp;raquo; the &amp;laquo;soul&amp;raquo; itself: they are all merely so many instruments of torture, systems of cruelty, whereby the priest becomes master and remains master..."&lt;/ref&gt; one man-machine wants to achieve power over another. Even the term "freedom," very often used by theologians, in its positive sense actually means "power."&lt;ref name="OFW"/&gt; Religion is by no means more "fulfilling the will of God" than anything else. As God is primary and almighty, his will is by definition always fulfilled (it is impossible that he wills something and it is not fulfilled).

A priest, a moralist does in fact nothing for man's "salvation," but just rules, and even when doing so he acts in a way that would (apart from that) be considered immoral.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.handprint.com/SC/NIE/GotDamer.html Twilight of the Idols]'', "The &amp;laquo;Improvers&amp;raquo; of Mankind", tr. W. Kaufmann and R.J. Hollingdale.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche goes on to analysing the [[Bible]] philologically and to guesses about the person of [[Jesus]]. He claims that it was not the aim of the latter to have anybody serve him, for God rules everything anyway; to the contrary, in Nietzsche's opinion Jesus fought with churchedness and the notion of sin rooted in the Old Testament. And thus in ''The Antichrist'' Christianity was portrayed as the corruption of the original doctrine taught by Jesus about equal rights of all to be children of God, the doctrine of no guilt and of no gulf between God and man.

The very "freedom of will" was invented by the priests in order to master the process of human thinking &amp;ndash; and nothing more.&lt;ref name="TI_fw"/&gt; And in order to master it, they had first to denaturize it.&lt;ref name="A2638"/&gt;

===About death of God and nihilism===
The downfall of Christian values is not an effect &amp;ndash; as it has been presented hitherto &amp;ndash; of human free will. The supreme values (especially formerly common in European culture) overthrow each other themselves&lt;ref name="gmfall"&gt;''[http://home.sandiego.edu/~janderso/360/genealogy3.htm On the Genealogy of Details] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010153350/http://home.sandiego.edu/~janderso/360/genealogy3.htm |date=2014-10-10 }}'', treatise III, 27, tr. W. Kaufmann.&lt;/ref&gt; due to inner contradictions&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Nietzsche often quotes, as children of Christianity, honest research (as willing the truth), as well as democratism (as derived from the belief in equality of souls before God, that is: the moral law, and unbelief in a "higher man", so essentially from pacifistic and equalistic tendencies), freedom of press (or speech in general) and so on.&lt;/ref&gt; and non-matching the nature.

{{Quotation|All great things destroy themselves by an act of self-cancellation. That's what the law of life wills, that law of the necessary "self-overcoming" in the essence of life &amp;ndash; eventually the call always goes out to the lawmaker himself, "''patere legem, quam ipse tulisti''" [submit to the law which you yourself have established]. That’s the way Christianity was destroyed as dogma by its own morality; that’s the way Christendom as morality must now also be destroyed. We stand on the threshold of this event.&lt;ref name="gmfall"/&gt;}}

'''Gail Adrienne Cobb''' (August 17, 1950{{spaced ndash}}September 20, 1974) was an American police officer from [[Washington, D.C.]], who was the first female police officer in the United States shot and killed while patrolling in the line of duty. She was also the first sworn female officer of the [[Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia]] (MPDC) to have been killed in the line of duty.&lt;ref name="Wilbanks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MPDC-Memorial"/&gt;&lt;ref name=McJackie /&gt;&lt;ref name=ODMP /&gt;
==Early life and education==
[[File:Gail A. Cobb MPDC.png|thumb|left|Cobb]]
[[File:Gail Cobb Jet Mag.png|thumb|left|Cobb]]
Cobb was born in Washington, D.C., on August 17, 1950, the second of five children, and grew up at a row house near the intersection of 14th and D Streets in [[Northeast, Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name="Wilbanks"/&gt; Cobb's family moved to Washington, D.C., in the 1930s. Her father was Clinton Cobb, a correctional officer for the District of Columbia who tried to apply to the MPDC in 1953, but was rejected due to being shorter than five feet and eight inches tall. Cobb's mother was Gloria Cobb, a crossing guard at Kingsman Elementary School, who met Cobb's father at Cardoza High School. Cobb's sister, Denise, ultimately went on to become a schoolteacher.&lt;ref name="Wilbanks"/&gt;

As a child, Cobb attended Catholic schools and was described as an average, but creative and energetic student. She attended Elliot Jr. High School, Eastern High School, and the now-defunct St. Cecilia's Academy.&lt;ref name="Wilbanks"/&gt; Upon graduating St. Cecila's Academy in 1969, Cobb wanted to become a successful fashion designer. However, she had little means and knowledge on how to go about doing so and ended up becoming a long-distance operator at the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company.&lt;ref name="Wilbanks"/&gt; 

==Personal life==
Cobb, a single mother, gave birth to a son, Damon Demetrius Cobb, on February 26, 1970. Her son's father, whom Cobb had met in high school, took no responsibility for his son, and Cobb ended up trying to raise him on her own. Cobb's son is currently serving a life sentence in prison at the [[Western Correctional Institution]] in [[Cumberland, Maryland]], after being found guilty of first-degree murder in a 1992 killing. Cobb's parents stated in 1996 that they believed that her untimely murder influenced her son's current legal predicament at the time.&lt;ref name="Wilbanks"/&gt;&lt;ref name=McJackie /&gt;&lt;ref name="B-More-Sun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1996-11-12/news/1996317004_1_dortch-robbery-cobb|title=Ex-inmate's bid to be lawyer angers slain officer's family Dortch planned fatal robbery - friends call new life a model|first=Dennis|last=O'Brien|work=The Baltimore Sun|location=Maryland|date=November 12, 1996|accessdate=December 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MD-DOC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpscs.state.md.us/inmate/search.do?searchType=detail&amp;id=80068|title=Damon Demetrius Cobb - Maryland DOC Inmate Locator|work=Maryland Department of Corrections|publisher=State of Maryland|date=March 8, 2013|accessdate=July 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In October 1973, Cobb applied to become an officer with the MPDC, much to the surprise of her family and friends, after the Washington, D.C., government lowered the height requirements for police recruits to five feet.&lt;ref name="Wilbanks"/&gt; Cobb herself was five feet tall, and graduated from her 34-member police academy class in April 1974, of which 13 members were female. She was well-liked by her trainers, who noted that she was hard-working. She spent most of her patrol work on foot and signed up for training to get a scooter license and was taking a night class to learn [[sign language]].&lt;ref name=McJackie /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilbanks"/&gt;

Late in the morning of Friday, September 20, 1974, around 10:30 am, two men, John Curtis Dortch, a 29-year-old [[Howard University]] graduate and former [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] soldier from [[Silver Spring, Maryland]],&lt;ref name="Wilbanks"/&gt; and John William Bryant, a 24-year-old man from Washington, D.C.,&lt;ref name="Wilbanks"/&gt; began making their way to the Eastern Liberty Federal Savings and Loan bank at 21st and L Streets NW, disguised as construction workers, and each carrying a loaded sawed-off shotgun and handgun. They intended to rob the bank.&lt;ref name="Wilbanks"/&gt;&lt;ref name=McJackie /&gt;&lt;ref name="RLSnow"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4FU0_jtVqMIC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;dq=%22John+William+Bryant%22+%22Cobb%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=C8iWBhWR5f&amp;sig=n7NKEcPonn1HzlKs5c-IAH4vn4k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4NTZU7vrNsmLyATa9YBA&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22John%20William%20Bryant%22%20%22Cobb%22&amp;f=false|title=Policewomen Who Made History: Breaking through the Ranks|first=Robert L.|last=Snow|date=2010|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishing Group, Inc.|location=Lanham, Maryland|isbn=978-1-4422-0033-3|oclc=473120367|pages=113-115|accessdate=July 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two plainclothes police officers were alerted of the robbery in advance, and saw the two men on the street. The officers stopped them and asked them for identification, before the would-be robbers could even get inside the bank. The two men ran off in separate directions. Cobb was still on probationary duty six months out of the academy and was assigned to foot patrol duty downtown, a block away from the bank. Cobb, who was writing a traffic ticket at the time, was told by a citizen that they saw an armed man run into a garage. Cobb followed the suspect and confronted him inside the garage as he was in the process of changing out of his disguise. Cobb ordered the man to place his hands on the wall. As she called for assistance over her radio, the suspect spun around and fired a single gunshot at Cobb at close range. The bullet went through Cobb's wrist, shattering a wristwatch that was given to her by her mother as a birthday present, then through her police radio, where it then penetrated her heart. Cobb died at the scene at 20th Street and L Street, NW, and responding officers arrested the suspect at the scene.&lt;ref name="MPDC-Memorial"/&gt;&lt;ref name=McJackie /&gt;&lt;ref name=ODMP /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilbanks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RLSnow"/&gt;

Cobb had served with the MPDC for one year and was the first female MPDC officer to be killed in the line of duty, as well as the first African American female law enforcement officer to be killed in the line of duty in the United States.&lt;ref name="Wilbanks"/&gt; She is survived by her son, Damon Demetrius Cobb, and is buried at Lincoln Memorial Cemetery in [[Suitland, Maryland]], near the border between Washington, D.C., and [[Prince George's County, Maryland]].&lt;ref name="Wilbanks"/&gt;&lt;ref name=McJackie /&gt;&lt;ref name=ODMP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odmp.org/officer/3199-police-officer-gail-a.-cobb |title=Police Officer Gail A.

===Funeral===
[[File:Gail Cobb Casket Funeral Jet 1.png|thumb|left|Cobb's casket being carried by pallbearers at her funeral in 1974]]
Cobb's funeral was ornate and large, even by Washington, D.C.'s standards. The streets leading to Holy Comforter Catholic Church in [[Southeast, Washington, D.C.]], were lined with hundreds of police officers, some coming all the way from [[Hawaii]], all standing at attention. A police honor guard made several passes along [[East Capitol Street]] before entering the church.&lt;ref name=McJackie /&gt;

Delegations of uniformed officers filed past Cobb's open casket. Cobb was not buried in uniform; instead, she was wearing a green suit. Her best friend had styled her hair, applied her favorite makeup, and finished with gold hoop earrings that would have been strictly forbidden by uniform regulations for a police officer on duty.&lt;ref name=McJackie /&gt;

The [[List of mayors of Washington, D.C.|Mayor of the District of Columbia]], [[Walter Washington]], and [[Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI Director]] [[Clarence Kelley]] were among the many U.S. government officials who attended the crowded service on Tuesday, September 24, 1974. At the hour of the funeral, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Gerald Ford|Gerald R. Ford]] called for a moment of silence as he addressed an International Association of Police Chiefs conference being held across town.&lt;ref name=McJackie /&gt;

Several weeks after Cobb's funeral, her parents purchased a glass curio cabinet in which to house memorabilia regarding their daughter. They displayed a photograph of Cobb in her MPDC uniform, her police badge, along with a [[Single (music)|45 rpm]] copy of her favorite song, "Tell Her Love Has Felt the Need", by [[Eddie Kendricks]] and the Young Senators, which had been sung at her funeral, along with proclamations and letters from government officials, and the uniform boots that Cobb had been wearing when she died. Given an entire section all to its own was a letter from U.S. President [[Gerald Ford|Gerald R. 
Ford]], saying that Cobb "has our lasting admiration for the cause of law enforcement and the well-being of our society, a cause for which she made the highest sacrifice."&lt;ref name=McJackie /&gt;

In 1975, John William Bryant was sentenced to 15 years to life imprisonment after being found guilty by a jury of second-degree murder. He was released on parole in 1992. The following year, in November 1993, he was arrested in Washington, D.C., for possessing crack cocaine and three bags of marijuana. However, a court ruled the cocaine and marijuana impermissible in court as the arresting officers did not have probable cause to believe that Bryant was committing a crime when they discovered them. In July 1997, the D.C. Parole Board revoked Bryant's parole for his possessing marijuana and cocaine, as well as testing positive for marijuana use. Bryant denied ever using marijuana. The D.C. Parole Board decided not to send Bryant back to prison, but rather to send him to an inpatient program for alcoholism treatment, much to the dismay of Cobb's relatives.&lt;ref name="Wilbanks"/&gt;

In 1996, John Curtis Dortch (born July 19, 1945), who was one of the key architects of the robbery that left Cobb dead, attempted to become a lawyer in [[West Virginia]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], after finishing a 15-year prison term for his being convicted of second-degree murder on July 30, 1975. After being released from prison on parole in 1989 for "good behavior",&lt;ref name="Wilbanks"/&gt; Dortch became active in church, helped out an [[AIDS]] patient, began tutoring and mentoring children, and started attending law school. Dortch, a graduate of [[Howard University]] and a former [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] officer who served in the [[Vietnam War]], was not the triggerman who shot Cobb, however, he attempted to appeal to the courts to allow him to become a lawyer, much to the dismay of Cobb's family and friends. In 1997, the [[West Virginia Supreme Court]] denied Dortch permission to practice law in the state in a unanimous 4-0 decision, to the praise of Cobb's surviving family members and friends. Dortch has since written an autobiography of his life, ''Memoirs of the Prodigal Son: the Road to Redemption, Fifteen Years in Prison and Beyond'', released in September 2008.&lt;ref name=B-More-Sun /&gt;&lt;ref name=AmazonBook&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Memoirs-Prodigal-Son-Redemption-22Fifteen/dp/0615237630|title=''Memoirs of the Prodigal Son: the Road to Redemption, Fifteen Years in Prison and Beyond''|publisher=Disciple Publishing Company|first=John Curtis|last=Dortch|edition=1|isbn=978-0615237633|date=September 10, 2008|accessdate=December 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WVSC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-04-15/news/1997105117_1_dortch-west-virginia-law-school|title=W.Va. court denies man convicted of murder permission to practice law|last=O'Brien|first=Dennis|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=April 15, 1997|accessdate=December 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3697">'''Haqeeqat''' (हक़ीक़त, meaning "reality", from the Arabic word [[Al-Haqq|Haqq]]) is the [[Hindi]] translation of a controversial book by a [[Kerala]], [[India]]-based [[Christian]] [[Evangelism|evangelist]] M.G. Mathew. It was translated by Daniel Nathaniel, associated with [[Emmanuel Mission International]] (EMI). The book is widely regarded as an [[anti-Hindu]] book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianaggression.org/item_display.php?type=NEWS&amp;id=1141380794 Archive of webindia123.com, Missionary book ignites anti-Hindu feelings in Rajasthan]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/full_story.php?content_id=89289 Oppn kicks up row over ‘anti-Hindu’ book, ''Indian express''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KG2006&gt;Daily Pioneer, 25 March 2006, Kanchan Gupta | "Abusing freedom, falsifying gods -- The Haqeeqat of Christian evangelism in India"| Source[http://kanchangupta.blogspot.hk/2014/02/abusing-freedom-falsifying-gods.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government of [[Rajasthan]] received complaints that the book ridiculed [[Hindu]] and [[Jain]] deities and beliefs. After examining the contents of the book, the government decided to ban it, as it felt that the book could incite [[Communalism (South Asia)|communal]] violence.

EMI's founder, Archbishop M.A. Thomas, and his son, the Rev. Dr. Samuel Thomas, went into hiding as the police searched for them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://headlines.agapepress.org/archive/3/142006c.asp "Agape Press"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph D'souza]], president of [[All India Christian Council]] (AICC) has stated that "They [[Bharatiya Janata Party]], the party ruling Rajasthan have declared that they would make tribal areas of Rajasthan Christian-free and are working hard on it."

Hopegivers International, one of the largest Christian ministries in India, has approached the US State Department, US senators, and Christian friends in Washington DC, after Dr. Samuel Thomas’s arrest on March 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/christian-groups-seek-intervention-for-jailed-ministry-head-in-india-16072/ |title=Christian Groups Seek Intervention for Jailed Ministry Head in India |last=Vu |first=Michelle A. |date=21 March 2006 |publisher=The Christian Post |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120722143910/http://www.christianpost.com/article/20060321/16072.htm |archive-date=2012-07-22 |accessdate=2018-05-28 |deadurl=unfit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was written as an answer to the book ''A Bunch of Thoughts'', authored by M. S. Golwalkar, the late leader of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]].

[[Kanchan Gupta]] has condemned the book as an "anti-Hindu diatribe". He says:
{{cquote|The book, Haqeeqat, is authored by a Kerala-based evangelist, MG Matthew, and purports to be a rebuttal of MS Golwalkar's writings that have been published by the RSS as Bunch of Thoughts. In reality, it is unadulterated abuse of Hindu scriptures, faith, ritual and tradition. It denigrates every tenet of Hinduism and pours undiluted scorn on Hindu icons and gurus. It casts aspersions on the chastity of Hindu women and questions received wisdom.}}

'''Henry Beagley''' (7 January 1805 at [[Farringdon, Hampshire]] – ?) was an English professional [[cricket]]er who played [[first-class cricket]] from 1825 to 1833.  He was a brother of [[Thomas Beagley]] and an occasional wicket-keeper who was mainly associated with [[Hampshire county cricket teams|Hampshire]].  He made 6 known appearances in first-class matches including 3 for [[The Bs]] from 1825 to 1832.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/36/36333/36333 CricketArchive].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5365">An '''intelligent decision support system''' (IDSS) is a [[decision support system]] that makes extensive use of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) techniques. Use of AI techniques in [[management information systems]] has a long history – indeed terms such as "[[Knowledge-based systems]]" (KBS) and "intelligent systems" have been used since the early 1980s to describe components of management systems, but the term "Intelligent decision support system" is thought to originate with Clyde Holsapple and [[Andrew B. Whinston|Andrew Whinston]]&lt;ref&gt;Holsapple C.: Framework for a generalized intelligent decision support system (1977) PhD Thesis Purdue University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holsapple C. &amp; Whinston A.: Business expert systems (1987) McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 1970s. Examples of specialized intelligent decision support systems include [[Flexible manufacturing system]]s (FMS),&lt;ref&gt;Chang, Jiang &amp; Tang: The development of intelligent decision support tools to aid the design of flexible manufacturing systems (2000). International Journal of Production Economics, 65, 73-84&lt;/ref&gt; intelligent marketing decision support systems&lt;ref&gt;Matsatsinis and Siskos (2002), Intelligent support systems for marketing decisions, Kluwer Academic Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; and medical diagnosis systems.&lt;ref&gt;Walker D.: Similarity Determination and Case Retrieval in an Intelligent Decision Support System for Diabetes Management, MSCS Thesis, Ohio University, Computer Science (Engineering), 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideally, an intelligent decision support system should behave like a human consultant: [[decision support|supporting decision makers]] by gathering and analysing evidence, identifying and diagnosing problems, proposing possible courses of action and evaluating such proposed actions.  The aim of the AI techniques embedded in an intelligent decision support system is to enable these tasks to be performed by a computer, while emulating human capabilities as closely as possible.

Many IDSS implementations are based on [[expert systems]],&lt;ref&gt;Matsatsinis, N.F., Y. Siskos (1999), MARKEX: An intelligent decision support system for product development decisions, European Journal of Operational Research, vol. 113, no. 2, pp. 336-354&lt;/ref&gt; a well established type of KBS that encode knowledge and emulate the cognitive behaviours of human experts using predicate logic rules, and have been shown to perform better than the original human experts in some circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Baron J.: Thinking and Deciding (1998) Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turban E., Volonio L., McLean E. and Wetherbe J.: Information Technology for Management (2009) Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; [[Expert systems]] emerged as practical applications in the 1980s&lt;ref&gt;Jackson P.: Introduction to expert systems (1986) Addison-Wesley&lt;/ref&gt; based on research in artificial intelligence performed during the late 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Power, D.J. [http://DSSResources.COM/history/dsshistory.html A Brief History of Decision Support Systems], DSSResources.COM, World Wide Web, version 4.0, March 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; They typically combine knowledge of a particular application domain with an [[inference]] capability to enable the system to propose decisions or diagnoses. Accuracy and consistency can be comparable to (or even exceed) that of human experts when the decision parameters are well known (e.g. if a common disease is being diagnosed), but performance can be poor when novel or uncertain circumstances arise.

Research in AI focused on enabling systems to respond to novelty and uncertainty in more flexible ways is starting to be used in IDSS. For example, [[intelligent agent]]s&lt;ref&gt;Sugumaran V.: Application of Agents and Intelligent Information Technologies (2007) IGI Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matsatsinis, N.F., P. Moraϊtis, V. Psomatakis, N. Spanoudakis (2003), An Agent-Based System for Products Penetration Strategy Selection, Applied Artificial Intelligence: An International Journal, vol. 17, no. 10, pp. 901-925&lt;/ref&gt; that perform complex [[cognition|cognitive tasks]] without any need for human intervention have been used in a range of decision support applications.&lt;ref&gt;Tung Bui, Jintae Lee, An agent-based framework for building decision support systems, Decision Support Systems, Volume 25, Issue 3, April 1999, Pages 225-237, ISSN 0167-9236, {{DOI|10.1016/S0167-9236(99)00008-1}}.

&lt;/ref&gt; Capabilities of  these intelligent agents include [[KQML|knowledge sharing]],  [[machine learning]], [[data mining]], and automated [[inference]]. A range of AI techniques such as [[case based reasoning]], [[rough set]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://idss.cs.put.poznan.pl/site/research.html Laboratory of intelligent decision support systems, Poznan]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[fuzzy logic]] have also been used to enable decision support systems to perform better in uncertain conditions.

'''James Terry Roach''' (February 18, 1960 &amp;ndash; January 10, 1986) was the second person to be executed by the state of [[South Carolina]] following the 1976 decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] reauthorizing the use of [[capital punishment]] by the states. He was electrocuted on January 10, 1986, nearly a year to the day following the [[electric chair|electrocution]] of his accomplice, [[Joseph Carl Shaw]] on January 11, 1985, at the Central Correctional Institution in [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]]. He was executed at the age of 25 for a crime committed when he was 17 years old.

He was convicted of the rape and murder of a fourteen-year-old girl and the murder of her seventeen-year-old boyfriend. Evidence presented at the trial showed that Roach was mentally handicapped, with an I.Q. between 75 and 80 and that he was probably suffering from [[Huntington's Chorea]]. Moreover, the sentencing judge found that Roach was under the influence of Shaw when the crimes were committed. Despite these mitigating factors, the sentencing judge declared that the death penalty was warranted in this case.

The sentence was upheld on appeal by the [[South Carolina Supreme Court]]. Several attempts to seek review of the case or to bring a petition of [[habeas corpus]] were unsuccessful. The US Supreme Court declined to grant him [[certiorari]].

Pleas for legal reconsideration came from the [[United Nations]],&lt;ref&gt;Capital punishment for minors was at the time prohibited under the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|ICCPR]] (U.S. signed 1977, ratified 1992) and [[American Convention on Human Rights]] (U.S. signed 1977, never ratified)&lt;/ref&gt; international figures, and former president [[Jimmy Carter]]. Governor [[Richard Riley]] denied clemency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1986-01-10 |title=Court Clears Execution Of South Carolina Man |work=[[The New York Times]] |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/10/us/around-the-nation-court-clears-execution-of-south-carolina-man.html |accessdate=2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 10 January 1986, Roach, age 25, was strapped into the electric chair and gave his last words: "To my family and friends, there is only three words to say: I love you." He then gave a thumbs-up sign, reportedly to signal he was ready to die.&lt;ref&gt;

The case of James Terry Roach was brought before the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]], which found by five votes to one that the United States Government had violated Article I (Right to Life) and Article II (right to equality before the law) of the [[American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man]] in executing James Terry Roach. This was the first time that the United States was found to be in violation with its human rights obligations under the said Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;

Occurrences of the syndrome are extremely rare, and the causes are not well understood. One hypothesis for the phenomenon is that a chief factor (though not the only one) is the buildup of pressure in the chest as a result of [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR). The relaxation of pressure after resuscitation efforts have ended is thought to allow the heart to expand, triggering the heart's [[sinus rhythm|electrical impulses]] and restarting the heartbeat.&lt;ref name="ben-david" /&gt; Other possible factors are [[hyperkalemia]] or high doses of [[epinephrine]].&lt;ref name="emj-report" /&gt;

== History ==
* A 27-year-old man in the UK collapsed after overdosing on [[heroin]] and [[cocaine]]. [[Paramedic]]s gave him an [[Naloxone|injection]], and he recovered enough to walk to the ambulance. He went into [[cardiac arrest]] in transit. After 25 minutes of resuscitation efforts, the patient was verbally declared dead. About a minute after resuscitation ended, a nurse noticed a rhythm on the heart monitor and resuscitation was resumed. The patient recovered fully.&lt;ref name="emj-report" /&gt;
* A 66-year-old man suffering from a suspected abdominal [[aneurysm]] suffered cardiac arrest and received [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|chest compression]]s and [[defibrillation]] shocks for 17 minutes during treatment for his condition. Vital signs did not return; the patient was declared dead and resuscitation efforts ended. Ten minutes later, the surgeon felt a pulse. The aneurysm was successfully treated, and the patient fully recovered with no lasting physical or neurological problems.&lt;ref name="ben-david" /&gt;
* According to a 2002 article in the journal ''Forensic Science International'', a 65-year-old [[Prelingual deafness|prelingually deaf]] Japanese male was found unconscious in the foster home he lived in. CPR was attempted on the scene by home staff, emergency medical personnel and also in the emergency department of the hospital and included appropriate medications and defibrillation. He was declared dead after attempted resuscitation. However, a policeman found the person moving in the mortuary after 20 minutes. The patient survived for 4 more days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 12098530| year = 2002| author1 = Maeda| first1 = H| title = Death following spontaneous recovery from cardiopulmonary arrest in a hospital mortuary: 'Lazarus phenomenon' in a case of alleged medical negligence| journal = Forensic Science International| volume = 127| issue = 1–2| pages = 82–7| last2 = Fujita| first2 = M.

* Judith Johnson, 61, went into cardiac arrest at [[Beebe Medical Center]] in [[Lewes, Delaware]], United States, in May 2007. She was given "multiple medicines and synchronized shocks", but never regained a pulse. She was declared dead at 8:34&amp;nbsp;p.m. but was discovered in the [[morgue]] to be alive and breathing. She sued the medical center where it happened for damages due to physical and neurological problems stemming from the event.&lt;ref name="delaware-case"&gt;{{cite news| title = Woman Declared Dead, Still Breathing in Morgue| publisher = Fox News| date = 2008-10-07| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/10/07/woman-declared-dead-still-breathing-in-morgue/ |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Anthony Yahle, 37, in [[Bellbrook, Ohio]], USA, was breathing abnormally at 4 a.m. on 5 August 2013, and could not be woken. After finding that Yahle had no pulse, first responders administered CPR and were able to retrieve a stable-enough heartbeat to transport him to the Emergency Room. Later that afternoon, coded for 45 minutes at [[Kettering Medical Center]] and was pronounced dead after all efforts to resuscitate him failed. When his son arrived at the hospital to visit his supposed-to-be deceased father, he noticed a heartbeat on the monitor that was still attached to his father. Resuscitation efforts were resumed, and Yahle was successfully revived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first=Sydney| last=Lupkin| url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/ohio-man-declared-dead-back-life/story?id=20027401| title=Ohio Man Declared Dead Comes Back to Life| date=22 August 2013| accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Walter Williams, 78, from [[Lexington, Mississippi]], United States, was at home when his hospice nurse called a coroner who arrived and declared him dead at 9 p.m. on 26 February 2014. Once at a funeral home, he was found to be moving, possibly resuscitated by a defibrillator implanted in his chest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=McLaughlin| first=Eliott| title=Dead Mississippi man begins breathing in embalming room, coroner says| url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/28/us/dead-man-comes-back-life/?hpt=zite_zite2_featured| accessdate=28 February 2014| newspaper=CNN| date=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day he was well enough to be talking with family, but died fifteen days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Ford| first=Dana| title=Mississippi man who awoke in body bag dies two weeks later| url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/13/us/mississippi-walter-williams-dead/?hpt=zite_zite3_featured| accessdate=13 March 2014| newspaper=[[CNN]]|date=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications ==
The Lazarus phenomenon raises ethical issues for physicians, who must determine when medical death has occurred, resuscitation efforts should end, and postmortem procedures such as [[autopsy|autopsies]] and [[organ harvesting]] may take place.&lt;ref name="ben-david" /&gt;

Medical literature has recommended observation of a patient's vital signs for five to ten minutes after cessation of resuscitation before certifying death.&lt;ref name="emj-report" /&gt;

"'''Long Live Walter Jameson'''" is episode 24 of the [[American television]] anthology series ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]''.

==Opening narration==
{{cquote|You're looking at Act One, Scene One, of a nightmare, one not restricted to witching hours of dark, rainswept nights. Professor Walter Jameson, popular beyond words, who talks of the past as if it were the present, who conjures up the dead as if they were alive...In the view of this man, Professor Samuel Kittridge, Walter Jameson has access to knowledge that couldn't come out of a volume of history, but rather from a book on black magic, which is to say that this nightmare begins at noon.}}

==Plot==
Walter Jameson, a college professor, is engaged to a young doctoral student named Susanna Kittridge. Susanna's father, Sam Kittridge, another professor at Jameson's college, becomes suspicious of Jameson because he does not appear to have aged in the twelve years they have known each other and seems to have unrealistically detailed knowledge of some pieces of history that do not appear in texts. Jameson at one point reads from an original [[American Civil War|Civil War]] diary in his possession. Later, Kittridge recognizes Jameson in a [[Mathew Brady]] Civil War photograph. After he presents these pieces of evidence, Jameson ultimately reveals his real life history. Agelessness (but no kind of immunity to injury) was imparted to him by an alchemist more than 2,000 years ago. Jameson does not know what was done to him, only that the alchemist was gone when he recovered, and he then stopped aging. Soon, he had to become a constant refugee. He tells Kittridge that he learned a terrible lesson from living for so long and longs for death. He keeps a revolver in his desk drawer, but does not have the courage to use it.

Realizing that if Jameson marries his daughter, she will grow old, and Jameson will eventually abandon her in order to keep his secret, Kittridge refuses permission for Jameson to marry his daughter. Jameson defies him and proposes to Susanna, and they plan to immediately elope.

Jameson is accosted by Laurette Bowen ([[Estelle Winwood]]), one of his wives, whom he abandoned when she grew old and frail. She claims that she cannot allow Jameson to destroy another woman's life. She discovers Jameson's pistol lying on his desk and shoots him. Shortly after Bowen leaves, Kittridge enters Jameson's study and finds him bleeding, but seemingly at peace. Jameson rapidly ages and collapses on the floor. Susanna enters the house. Kittridge tries to stop her from seeing the aged Jameson, saying only that he is gone. He is unable to keep her out of the room, but inside she discovers only an empty suit of clothes with a white substance near the collar and sleeves. When Susanna asks what is on the floor, the professor replies, "Dust, only dust."

==Production notes==
The scenes of Walter Jameson's aging was performed by using an old movie-making trick. Age lines were drawn on actor [[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]]'s face in red make-up. During the beginning of the scene, red lighting was used, bathing the scene in red and hiding the age lines. As the scene progressed, the red lights were turned down and green lights were brought up. Under the green lights, the red age lines were prominent. The lighting changes were unseen by the audience because it was filmed in black-and-white. The ultimate result is the appearance of a complete make-up change with no cuts to the scene.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

*The date of the diary entry of September 11, 1864 is said to be on a Tuesday, but in reality it was on a Sunday.
*The fire referred to in the diary entry was actually set by the retreating [[Confederate States of America|Confederates]], on Gen. [[John Bell Hood]]'s order, to destroy [[munitions]] and thereby prevent them from falling into Federal hands.  Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]'s fire would not take place until November as his army began [[Sherman’s March to the Sea]].

==DVD release==
For the DVD release Kevin McCarthy returned to record an audio commentary for the episode, revealing that he never met Rod Serling and that, aside from ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'', his appearance in this episode generated the most fan mail he ever received.

'''Necrophilia''', also known as '''necrophilism''', '''necrolagnia''', '''necrocoitus''', '''necrochlesis''', and '''thanatophilia''',{{sfn|Aggrawal|2016|p=1}} is a [[sexual attraction]] or sexual act involving [[Cadaver|corpses]]. It is classified as a [[paraphilia]] by [[ICD10]] published by [[WHO]] and the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]'' (DSM) of the [[American Psychiatric Association]].&lt;ref name="goodwin"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=Robin|editor1-last=Goodwin|editor2-first=Duncan|editor2-last=Cramer|title=Inappropriate Relationships: The Unconventional, the Disapproved, and the Forbidden|pages=174–176|publisher=Psychology Press|location=London, England|date=2002|ISBN= 978-0805837421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosman and Resnick (1989) reviewed information from 34 cases of necrophilia describing the individuals' motivations for their behaviors: these individuals reported the desire to possess a non-resisting and non-rejecting partner (68%), reunions with a romantic partner (21%), sexual attraction to corpses (15%), comfort or overcoming feelings of isolation (15%), or seeking self-esteem by expressing power over a homicide victim (12%).&lt;ref name="rosman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosman | first1 = J.

==Origins of term==
The term 'necrophilia' is thought to have been coined by Belgian physician [[Joseph Guislain]] in his ''Leçons Orales sur les Phrénopathies'', in a lecture given around 1850, in reference to contemporary necrophile [[François Bertrand]]:&lt;ref&gt;Aggrawal p.4&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote|It is within the category of the destructive madmen [''aliénés destructeurs''] that one needs to situate certain patients to whom I would like to give the name of necrophiliacs [''nécrophiles'']. The alienists have adopted, as a new form, the case of Sergeant Bertrand, the disinterrer of cadavers on whom all the newspapers have recently reported. However, don't think that we are dealing here with a form of phrenopathy which appears for the first time. The ancients, in speaking about [[lycanthropy]], have cited examples to which one can more or less relate the case which has just attracted the public attention so strongly.}}
The term was popularized about a decade later by psychiatrist [[Bénédict Morel]], who also discussed Bertrand.&lt;ref name="goodwin" /&gt;

==History==
In the ancient world, sailors returning corpses to their home country were often accused of necrophilia.{{sfn|Aggrawal|2016|p=2}} Singular accounts of necrophilia in history are sporadic, though written records suggest the practice was present within [[Ancient Egypt]]. [[Herodotus]] writes in [[Histories (Herodotus)|''The Histories'']] that, to discourage intercourse with a corpse, ancient [[Egypt]]ians left deceased beautiful women to decay for "three or four days" before giving them to the [[embalmers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Herodotus (c. 440 BC) |title=The Histories (Book 2) |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2707 |quote=The wives of men of rank when they die are not given at once to be embalmed, nor such women as are very beautiful or of greater regard than others, but on the third or fourth day after their death (and not before) they are delivered to the embalmers. They do so about this matter in order that the embalmers may not abuse their women, for they say that one of them was taken once doing so to the corpse of a woman lately dead, and his fellow-craftsman gave information.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brill | first1 = Abraham A. | date= 1941 | title = Necrophilia | journal = Journal of Criminal Psychopathology | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 433–443 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="klaf"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Franklin S.|last1=Klaf |first2=William|last2=Brown  |date= 1958 | title = Necrophilia: Brief Review and Case Report | journal = Psychiatric Quarterly | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 645–652 | quote = Inhibited forms of necrophilia and necrophiliac fantasies may occur more commonly then is generally realized. | doi=10.1007/bf01563024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus also alluded to suggestions that Greek tyrant [[Periander]] had defiled the corpse of his wife, employing a metaphor: "Periander baked his bread in a cold oven."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Anil |last= Aggrawal| date = 2010 | title = Necrophilia: Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects | publisher = CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, Florida| ISBN= 978-1420089127|pages = 6–7|quote=The primary source is ''Histories'', Book V, 92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acts of necrophilia are depicted on ceramics from the [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] culture, which reigned in northern [[Peru]] from the first to eighth century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Steve|last=Finbow | date = 2014 | title = Grave Desire: A Cultural History of Necrophilia | publisher = John Hunt Publishing | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rGIpBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT4&amp;ots=74OrhG8hA4&amp;pg=PT39}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common theme in these artifacts is the masturbation of a male skeleton by a living woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Weismantel, M. | year = 2004 | title = Moche sex pots: Reproduction and temporality in ancient South America | journal = American Anthropologist | volume = 106 | issue = 3 | pages = 495–496 | url = http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/moche/moche-sex-pots.pdf | doi=10.1525/aa.2004.106.3.495}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hittites|Hittite]] law from the 16th century BC through to the 13th century BC explicitly permitted sex with the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Boer, Roland | year = 2014 | title = Sex in Antiquity: Exploring Gender and Sexuality in the Ancient World | chapter = From Horse Kissing to Beastly Emissions: Paraphilias in the Ancient Near East | editor = Masterson, Mark | publisher = Routledge | page = 69 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=k1G2BQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;ots=DtUbHRO19Dlr&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; In what is now [[Northeast China]], the ethnic [[Xianbei]] emperor [[Murong Xi]] (385–407) of the [[Later Yan]] state had intercourse with the corpse of his beloved empress [[Fu Xunying]], after the latter was already cold and put into the coffin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tales about Chinese Emperors: Their Wild and Wise Ways|chapter=The Corpse-Raping Emperor|last=Luan Pao-chün|year=1994|pages=148–?|isbn=|publisher=Hai Feng Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Renaissance Italy]], following the reputed moral collapse brought about by the [[Black Death]] and before the [[Roman Inquisition]] of the [[Counter-Reformation]], the literature was replete with sexual references; these include necrophilia, in the case of the epic poem ''[[Orlando Innamorato]]'' by [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]], first published in 1483.&lt;ref name="DavidsonDean1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davidson|first1=Nicholas|last2=Dean|first2=Trevor|last3=Lowe|first3=K.

Dahmer wanted to create a [[sex slave]] that would mindlessly consent to whatever he wanted. When his attempts failed, and his male victim died, he would keep the corpse until it decomposed beyond recognition, continuously masturbating and performing sexual intercourse on the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.comicextra.com/my-friend-dahmer/chapter-Full/214|title=My Friend Dahmer #Full - Read My Friend Dahmer Issue #Full Page 214|website=www.comicextra.com|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to be aroused, he had to murder his male victims before performing sexual intercourse with them.
Dahmer stated that he only killed his victims because they wanted to leave after having sex, and would be angry with him for drugging them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Psychiatric Testimony of Jeffrey Dahmer|url=http://www.criminalprofiling.com/Psychiatric-Testimony-of-Jeffrey-Dahmer_s115.html|work=Court Transcripts|publisher=Criminal Profiling|date=8 June 2001|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; British serial killer [[Dennis Nilsen]] is also considered to have been a necrophiliac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Masters, Brian | year = 1985 | title = Killing For Company | publisher = Arrow | isbn = 978-0099552611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
In the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], fifth edition ([[DSM-5]]), recurrent, intense sexual interest in corpses can be diagnosed under [[Other Specified Paraphilic Disorder]] (necrophilia) when it causes marked distress or impairment in important areas of functioning.&lt;ref name="DSM-5"&gt;{{cite book | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition | chapter = Other Specified Paraphilic Disorder, 302.89 (F65.89) | editor = American Psychiatric Association | year = 2013 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing | page = 705}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ten-tier classification of necrophilia exists:&lt;ref name="aggrawal_classification"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aggrawal, Anil |title=A new classification of necrophilia |journal=Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=316–20 |year=2009 |pmid=19573840 |doi=10.1016/j.jflm.2008.12.023 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1752928X08002564}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Role players: People who get aroused from [[Sexual roleplay|pretending]] their live partner is dead during sexual activity.
# Romantic necrophiliacs: Bereaved people who remain attached to their dead lover's body.
# Necrophilic fantasizers: People who fantasize about necrophilia, but never actually have sex with a corpse.
# Tactile necrophiliacs: People who are aroused by touching or stroking a corpse, without engaging in intercourse.
# [[Sexual fetishism|Fetishistic]] necrophiliacs: People who remove objects (e.g., panties or a tampon) or body parts (e.g., a finger or genitalia) from a corpse for sexual purposes, without engaging in intercourse.
# Necromutilomaniacs: People who derive pleasure from mutilating a corpse while masturbating, without engaging in intercourse.
# Opportunistic necrophiliacs: People who normally have no interest in necrophilia, but take the opportunity when it arises.
# Regular necrophiliacs: People who preferentially have intercourse with the dead.
# Homicidal necrophiliacs: Necrosadists,{{sfn|Purcell|2006|p=21}} people who commit [[lust murder|murder]] in order to have sex with the victim.
# Exclusive necrophiliacs: People who have an exclusive interest in sex with the dead, and cannot perform at all for a living partner.
Additionally, criminologist [[Lee Mellor]]'s typology of homicidal necrophiles consists of eight categories (A–H), and is based on the combination of two behavioral axes: destructive (offender [[Mutilation|mutilates]] the corpse for sexual reasons) – preservative (offender does not), and cold (offender used the corpse sexually two hours after death) – warm (offender used the corpse sexually earlier than two hours after death).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homicide: A Forensic Psychology Casebook|last=Mellor|first=Lee|publisher=CRC|year=2016|isbn=|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=103–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; This renders four categories (A-D) to which Mellor adds an additional four (E-H):
* Category A (cold/destructive), e.g. [[Ted Bundy]], [[Jeffrey Dahmer]]
* Category B (cold/preservative), e.g. [[Gary Ridgway]], [[Dennis Nilsen]]
* Category C (warm/destructive) e.g. [[Andrei Chikatilo]], [[Joseph Vacher]]
* Category D (warm/preservative) e.g. [[Robert Lee Yates|Robert Yates]], [[Earle Nelson]]
* Category E (dabblers) e.g. [[Richard Ramirez]], [[Mark Dixie]]
* Category F ([[Fredric Wertham|catathymic]]){{clarify|date=November 2018}}
* Category G (exclusive necromutilophiles) e.g. [[Robert Napper]], [[Peter Sutcliffe]]
* Category H (sexual [[Human cannibalism|cannibals]] &amp; vampires) e.g. [[Albert Fish]], [[Peter Kürten]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
Dabblers have transitory opportunistic sexual relations with corpses, but this is not their preference. Category F homicidal necrophiles commit postmortem sex acts only while in a [[Fredric Wertham|catathymic]] state. Exclusive mutilophiles derive pleasure purely from mutilating the corpse, while sexual [[Human cannibalism|cannibals]] and vampires are sexually aroused by eating human body parts. Category A, C, and F offenders may also cannibalize or drink the blood of their victims.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Research==

===Humans===
Necrophilia is often assumed to be rare, but no data for its prevalence in the general population exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author =  Milner, J. S., Dopke, C. A., &amp; Crouch, J. L.  | date= 2008 | title = Sexual Deviance: Theory, Assessment, and Treatment, 2nd edition | publisher = The Guilford Press | page = 399 | chapter = Paraphilia Not Otherwise Specified: Psychopathology and Theory | editor = Laws, D. Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some necrophiles only fantasize about the act, without carrying it out.&lt;ref name="rosman" /&gt; In 1958, Klaf and Brown commented that, although rarely described, necrophiliac [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasies]] may occur more often than is generally supposed.&lt;ref name="klaf"/&gt;

Rosman and Resnick (1989) reviewed 122 cases of necrophilia. The sample was divided into genuine necrophiles, who had a persistent attraction to corpses, and pseudo-necrophiles, who acted out of opportunity, sadism, or transient interest.  Of the total, 92% were male and 8% were female. 57% of the genuine necrophiles had occupational access to corpses, with morgue attendant, hospital orderly, and cemetery employee being the most common jobs. The researchers theorized that either of the following situations could be antecedents to necrophilia:&lt;ref name="rosman" /&gt;
#The necrophile develops poor [[self-esteem]], perhaps due in part to a significant loss;
#:(a) They are very fearful of rejection by others and they desire a sexual partner who is incapable of rejecting them; and/or
#:(b) They are fearful of the dead, and transform their fear—by means of [[reaction formation]]—into a desire.
#They develop an exciting fantasy of sex with a corpse, sometimes after exposure to a corpse.

The authors reported that, of their sample of genuine necrophiles:&lt;ref name="rosman" /&gt;
*68% were motivated by a desire for an unresisting and unrejecting partner;
*21% by a want for reunion with a lost partner;
*15% by sexual attraction to dead people;
*15% by a desire for comfort or to overcome feelings of isolation; and
*12% by a desire to remedy low self-esteem by expressing power over a corpse.

IQ data was limited, but not abnormally low. About half of the sample had a personality disorder, and 11% of true necrophiles were psychotic. Rosman and Resnick concluded that their data challenged the conventional view of necrophiles as generally psychotic, mentally deficient, or unable to obtain a consenting partner.&lt;ref name="rosman" /&gt;

===Other animals===

{{see also|Non-reproductive sexual behavior in animals}}

Necrophilia has been observed in mammals, birds, reptiles and frogs.&lt;ref name="demattos"&gt;{{cite journal | author = de Mattos Brito, L. B., Joventino, I. R., Ribeiro, S.

The label is still used for necrophilia in animals.&lt;ref name="costa" /&gt; Certain species of arachnids and insects practice [[sexual cannibalism]], in which the female cannibalizes her male mate prior to, during, or after copulation.

[[Kees Moeliker]] made one observation while he was sitting in his office at the [[Natural History Museum Rotterdam]], when he heard the distinctive thud of a bird hitting the glass facade of the building. Upon inspection, he discovered a drake (male) [[mallard]] lying dead outside the building. Next to the downed bird there was a second drake mallard standing close by. As Moeliker observed the couple, the living drake pecked at the corpse of the dead one for a few minutes  then mounted the corpse and began copulating with it. The act of necrophilia lasted for about 75 minutes, in which time, according to Moeliker, the living drake took two short breaks before resuming with copulating behavior. Moeliker surmised that at the time of the collision with the window the two mallards were engaged in a common pattern in [[duck]] behavior called "attempted [[rape]] flight". "When one died the other one just went for it and didn't get any negative feedback &amp;mdash; well, didn't get any feedback," according to Moeliker.&lt;ref name="Mallard Duck"&gt;{{cite journal | author=C.W.

The sea lion nudged the seal repeatedly, then mounted her and made several pelvic thrusts.

==Legality==
'''Australia'''

Necrophilia is not explicitly mentioned in Australian law, however, under the Crimes Act 1900 - Sect 81C it states misconduct with regard to corpses is any person who:

(a) indecently interferes with any dead human body, or

(b) improperly interferes with, or offers any indignity to, any dead human body or human remains (whether buried or not),

shall be liable to imprisonment for two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www6.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s81c.html|title=CRIMES ACT 1900 - SECT 81C
Misconduct with regard to corpses|website=www6.austlii.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===

Article 212 of the Brazilian Penal Code (federal Decree-Law No 2.848) states as follows:&lt;ref name=bpc&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/decreto-lei/Del2848compilado.htm |title=Código Penal (Decreto-Lei nº 2.848) |publisher=Presidency of the Republic |date=December 7, 1940 |accessdate=2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Free translation from Brazilian Portuguese to English.&lt;/ref&gt;
		 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Art. 212 - To abuse a cadaver or its ashes:&lt;br&gt;Penalty: detention, from 1 to 3 years, plus fine.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Although sex with a corpse is not explicitly mentioned, a person who has sex with a corpse may be convicted of  a crime under the above Article. The legal asset protected by such Article is not the corpse's objective honor, but the feeling of good memories, respect and veneration that living people keep about the deceased person: these persons are considered passive subjects of the corpse's violation.

===India===
Section 297 of the Indian Penal Code entitled "Trespassing on burial places, etc.", states as follows:&lt;ref name="ipc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mynation.net/ipc.htm#_Toc496765169 |title=The Indian Penal Code (IPC): Dowry Law Misuse (IPC 448) By Indian Women |publisher=Mynation.net |date= |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whoever, with the intention of wounding the feelings of any person, or of insulting the religion of any person, or with the knowledge that the feelings of any person are likely to be wounded, or that the religion of any person is likely to be insulted thereby,
commits any trespass in any place of worship or on any place of sculpture, or any place set apart from the performance of funeral rites or as a depository for the remains of the dead, or offers any indignity to any human corpse, or causes disturbance to any persons assembled for the performance of funeral ceremonies, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although sex with a corpse is not explicitly mentioned, a person who has sex with a corpse may be convicted under the above section. [[Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code]] could also be invoked.

===New Zealand===
Under Section 150 of the New Zealand [[Crimes Act 1961]], it is an offence for there to be "misconduct in respect to human remains". Subsection (b) elaborates that this applies if someone "improperly or indecently interferes with or offers indignity to any dead human body or human remains, whether buried or not". This statute is therefore applicable to sex with corpses and carries a potential two-year prison sentence, although there is no case law as yet that would apply the aforementioned statute.&lt;ref&gt;Butterworths Crimes Act 1961: Wellington: Butterworths: 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
Section 14 of the [[Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007]] prohibits the commission of a sexual act with a corpse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/2007-032.pdf |format=PDF |title=Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act 32 of 2007 |at=sec. 14 |date=December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523214416/http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/2007-032.pdf |archivedate=2012-05-23 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until codified by the act it was a [[common law offence]].

===Sweden===
Section 16, § 10 of the Swedish Penal Code criminalizes necrophilia, but it is not explicitly mentioned. Necrophilia falls under the regulations against abusing a corpse or grave (''brott mot griftefrid''), which carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison. One person has been convicted of necrophilia. He was sentenced to psychiatric care for that and other crimes, including arson.&lt;ref name="HD06"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.hd.se/2006-10-06/fakta-nekrofili-och-brott-mot-griftefrid |title=Fakta: Nekrofili och brott mot griftefrid |work=HD |access-date=2017-09-21 |language=sv-SE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom ===
Sexual penetration of a corpse was made illegal under the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]], carrying a maximum sentence of two years' imprisonment. Prior to 2003, necrophilia was not illegal; however, exposing a naked corpse in public was classed as a [[public nuisance]] (''R v. Clark [1883] 15 Cox 171'').&lt;ref&gt;Aggrawal p.200&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
There is no federal legislation specifically barring sex with a corpse. Multiple states have their own laws:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Aggrawal, Anil | year = 2010 | title = Necrophilia: Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects | publisher = CRC Press | pages = 201–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Posner, Richard A. |author2=Silbaugh, Katharine B. | year = 1996 | title = A Guide to America's Sex Laws | publisher = University of Chicago Press | pages = 213–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Old Hemp''' (September 1893 &amp;ndash; May 1901) was a [[Dog breeding|stud dog]] considered to be the progenitor to the [[Border Collie]] breed. He was owned by Adam Telfer, and was used as a [[working dog]] to [[herding|herd]] [[sheep]]. His style was different from that commonly seen during his era, as he worked far more quietly than the other sheepdogs of the time. This style was adopted and used by other breeders and trainers and became the most common style among Border Collies within a few generations, with his descendants becoming successful international sheepdog champions.

==Life and herding career==
In September 1893,&lt;ref name="halsall31"/&gt; Old Hemp was born to Adam Telfer's two dogs in [[West Woodburn]], [[Northumberland]].&lt;ref name=riahortercollie&gt;{{cite news|last=Horter|first=Ria|title=Border Collie|url=http://www.riahorter.com/Border%20Collie.pdf|accessdate=15 March 2011|newspaper=de Hondenwereld|language=Dutch|format=PDF|date=April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hemp's mother, Meg, was a reticent and very strong-eyed black [[herding dog|sheepdog]]; while Hemp's father, Roy, was a loose-eyed black, white, and tan sheepdog with a good natured temperament.&lt;ref name=workingdogsseis&gt;{{cite book|last=Seis|first=Colin|title=Working Dogs: Training for Sheep and Cattle|year=1995|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=978-0-7506-8920-5|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/?id=X3BCBnMw_HYC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=%22old+hemp%22+dog#v=onepage&amp;q=%22old%20hemp%22%20dog&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many modern border collies, Hemp was a tri-colored dog with only a small amount of white fur on his trim.&lt;ref name=workingdogsseis/&gt;

First following sheep at the age of six weeks,&lt;ref name="halsall32"&gt;[[#halsall1985|Halsall (1985)]]: p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Hemp grew to have a great ability to [[herding|herd]].

Hemp never ceased to impress his owner Adam Telfer. Telfer once said, while talking about Hemp, "he flashed like a meteor across the sheepdog horizon. There never was such an outstanding personality."&lt;ref name="halsall31"&gt;[[#halsall1985|Halsall (1985)]]: p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; With that, Telfer continued Hemp's legacy within his own breeding stock.&lt;ref name="halsall31"/&gt; Author and commentator [[Eric Halsall]] was also impressed by his skill. Halsall once said about Hemp, "none who saw him ever forgot him...Almost faultless in work...he was born with such knowledge of his craft that he never required training and went to his work naturally."&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;

Estimates place his offspring at more than 200, due to his stud services being widely sought after. His medium-sized stature and rough coat are commonly seen in the breed today as many of his offspring continued to keep many of his original traits.&lt;ref name=workingdogsseis/&gt;

While it is not known if Hemp participated in any [[sheepdog trial]]s, a dog from Telfer's own breeding stock, Sweep (a grandson of Hemp), won the [[International Sheep Dog Society]]'s championship twice.&lt;ref name=four&gt;{{cite web|title=Old Hemp|url=http://www.gis.net/~shepdog/BC_Museum/Permanent/AULD%20HEMP/AULDHEMP.html|publisher=The Border Collie Museum|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Telfer later bred and owned another dog named Hemp, a descendant of Old Hemp.  The younger Hemp won the 1924 International Farmers Championship for sheepdogs.&lt;ref name="halsall85"&gt;[[#halsall1985|Halsall (1985)]]: p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; This was not the only victory in that competition by Old Hemp's descendants. Each of the twenty nine collies that won the championship between 1906 and 1951 were descendants from Old Hemp.&lt;ref name="halsall86"&gt;[[#halsall1985|Halsall (1985)]]: p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

A Facebook campaign was started in 2012 to install a memorial to Telfer and Old Hemp, in Old Hemp's birthplace of West Woodburn, Northumberland, and permission has been granted by the relevant authorities. The unveiling of which took place on September 8th 2015 and was attended by a large assembly of Border Collies and their respective owners.

'''Patricia Louise Lowther''' (née '''Tinmuth''') (July 29, 1935 – September 24?, 1975) was a [[Canadian]] poet. Born in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], she grew up in the neighboring city of [[North Vancouver (district municipality)|North Vancouver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://poets.ca/lowther/|title=Pat Lowther Memorial Award – League of Canadian Poets|website=poets.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
When she was ten years old, her first published poem appeared in ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://spacing.ca/vancouver/2013/04/24/the-brutal-murder-of-pat-lowther/|title=The Brutal Murder of Pat Lowther - Spacing Vancouver|date=2013-04-24|work=Spacing Vancouver|access-date=2017-12-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It wasn't until 1968 that she published her first collection, ''This Difficult Flowering'', with [[Very Stone House]], a small Canadian poetry press. In 1972, "The Age of the Bird", a long poem inspired by revolutionary politics in [[South America]], was published as a broadside by [[Blackfish Press]]. Its companion poem, "Regard to Neruda", was written for [[Pablo Neruda]], one of Lowther's political and literary inspirations.

She was co-chair of the [[League of Canadian Poets]], and the [[BC Arts Council]]. She taught at the [[University of British Columbia]].

''Milk Stone'', published in 1974 by [[Borealis Press]], became Lowther's breakthrough into Canadian mainstream literature. ''A Stone Diary'' was submitted to [[Oxford University Press]] in 1975.

In September 1975, Lowther was reported missing after failing to arrive for a scheduled poetry reading at Vancouver's Ironworkers Hall.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/review-the-collected-poems-of-pat-lowther-edited-by-christine-wiesenthal/article1374495/ "Review: The Collected Poems of Pat Lowther, edited by Christine Wiesenthal"]. ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', June 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks later, her body was found in a [[Stream|creek]] near [[Squamish, British Columbia|Squamish]], British Columbia. Her second husband Roy Lowther, whom she had married in 1963, was convicted of the murder in June 1977. He died in Matsqui prison in [[Abbotsford, British Columbia]], on July 14, 1985.

Her daughters are the poet [[Christine Lowther]], Beth Lowther, and Kathy Lyons (d. 2015). Her son is Alan Domphousse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://canpoetry.library.utoronto.ca/canpoetry/lowther/index.htm|title=Canadian Poetry Online {{!}} University of Toronto Libraries {{!}}  Pat Lowther|website=canpoetry.library.utoronto.ca|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Two years after the poet's murder, Oxford published ''A Stone Diary''. In 1980, a collection of Lowther's early and unpublished poems, ''Final Instructions'', was also published. Also that year, the [[League of Canadian Poets]] established the [[Pat Lowther Award]], a prize awarded annually to a book of poetry by a Canadian woman.

A manuscript was discovered in 1996 and published under the title ''Time Capsule''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/pat-lowther/ "Pat Lowther"]. ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'',  Betty Nygaard King, Mary Willan Mason, 02/07/2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Lowther's life and death have served to inspire a number of works, including her daughter Christine Lowther's first poetry collection, ''New Power'' (1999), and the novels ''[[Swann: A Mystery]]'' (1987) by [[Carol Shields]] and ''Furry Creek'' by [[Keith Harrison]] (1999).

A '''remedial action''' is a change made to a nonconforming product or service to address the deficiency. This also can refer to restoration of a landscape from industrial activity&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ruralarisings.co.uk/roclf.swf?ms=1229904000057{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rework and repair are generally the remedial actions taken on products, while services usually require additional services to be performed to ensure satisfaction.

In some settings, '''corrective action''' is used as an encompassing term that includes '''remedial actions''', [[corrective action]]s and [[preventive action]]s.

‘Remedial Action’ is a term referring to actions taken by businesses to counteract deficiencies or undesirable characteristics in their products. In this way it is distinct from ‘Corrective Action’, which aims to change the processes that led to these deficiencies, and ‘Preventive Action’, which aims to strengthen weak management systems not yet responsible for any deficiency &lt;ref&gt;Quality Progress (2005) Corrective vs. Preventive Action, [online] Available at: http://asq.org/quality-progress/2005/03/problem-solving/corrective-vs-preventive-action.html [Accessed November 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;

Remedial Action is often enacted through ‘Remedial Action Plans’ (RAPs) of three or more stages. For example, one North American river protection scheme drew up a plan that identified environmental problems and sources of pollution, evaluated and carried out actions to restore the area, and confirmed that these actions had been effective &lt;ref&gt;The St. Mary's River Bi-National Public Advisory Council (2015) Remedial Action Plan, [online] Available at: https://www.lssu.edu/bpac/remedial-action-plan-3 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105113200/http://www.lssu.edu/bpac/remedial-action-plan-3 |date=2015-11-05 }} [Accessed November 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

These actions normally have negative effects on a company’s image and profits. A fine balance is often struck between denying the existence of problems or wrongdoing and choosing to publicise this existence before being exposed removes the company’s ability to control the way any scandal is seen.&lt;ref&gt;The Independent (2014) Tesco profits down 92% as scandal costs supermarket £263 million, [online] Available at: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/tesco-profits-down-92-as-scandal-costs-supermarket-263-million-9812538.html [Accessed November 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varieties==
'''Environmental''' - If the environment a business works in becomes polluted as the result of the activities of that business, or sometimes other events, this pollution must be cleaned for reasons of safety and welfare. This will normally involve the business either financing the remedial action or applying for the finances to do so. If the business is not at fault, the government may finance the remediation.&lt;ref&gt;Wise Geek (2015) What is Remedial Action, [online] Available at: http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-remedial-action.htm [Accessed November 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Repair/Replacement''' - When a product is deemed ineffective, either by the company or by public exposure, a recall plan can be put into action, sometimes also involving compensation for consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (2015) Product Liability and Safety Law , [online] Available at: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/product-liability-and-safety-law [Accessed November 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Policy''' - When company policy is considered to be in violation of the law, such as keeping inaccurate financial records, remedial action can be taken to change those policies. (HR.BLR.com, 2012).  When done after an internal investigation, this can avoid repercussions such as negative publicity or even fines, and the UK Serious Fraud Office states that if a company self-reports corruption it will impact on whether or not prosecution occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Serious Fraud Office (2015) Self-Reporting Process, [online] Available at: http://www.sfo.gov.uk/bribery--corruption/corporate-self-reporting/self-reporting-process.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210113208/http://www.sfo.gov.uk/bribery--corruption/corporate-self-reporting/self-reporting-process.aspx |date=2015-12-10 }} [Accessed November 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
'''Brodex Water''' - Environmental remedial action is often undertaken by water specialists in the case of infected supply. Some, such as UK Company Brodex Water Treatment Specialists, advertise what services the company provides in the event of Legionella disease being discovered in a local supply, such as tank chlorination and equipment replacement. This proactive strategy improves the company’s public image.&lt;ref&gt;Brodex Water Treatment Specialists (2015) Corrective Remedial Action, [online] Available at: http://www.brodexuk.com/services/corrective-remedial-action/ [Accessed November 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Great Lakes''' -  Since the mid-1980s, several ‘Remediative Action Plans’ have been drawn up to manage the impact of various stakeholders, including local businesses, on the environmental health of the American-Canadian Great Lakes region.&lt;ref&gt;Hartig, J. (1997) Great Lakes Remedial Action Plans: Fostering Adaptive Ecosystem-Based Management Processes, American Review of Canadian Studies, 27(3), p.437.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Volkswagen''' - The most recent example, VW has recently been forced to recall millions of cars to adjust deficiencies in their pollution controls, after a company policy of only activating them during emissions tests was exposed.&lt;ref&gt;The Daily Telegraph (2015) VW Scandal: More than 1 million UK cars contatin Volkswagen emissions cheating device, [online] Available at: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/11901219/VW-scandal-More-than-1-million-UK-cars-contain-emissions-cheating-device.html [Accessed November 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizational resilience is defined as "the ability of a system to withstand changes in its environment and still function".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=Ian P|last2=Collard|first2=Mark|last3=Johnson|first3=Michael|title=Adaptive organizational resilience: an evolutionary perspective|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2017.07.005|journal=Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability|volume=28|pages=33–40|doi=10.1016/j.cosust.2017.07.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a capability that involves organizations either being able to endure the environmental changes without having to permanently adapt, or the organization is forced to adapt a new way of working that better suits the new environmental conditions.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In recent years, a new consensus of the concept of '''resilience''' emerged as a practical response to the decreasing lifespan of organisations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Upside-Turbulence-Seizing-Opportunity-Uncertain/dp/0061771155/|title=The Upside of Turbulence: Seizing Opportunity in an Uncertain World|first=Donald|last=Sull|date=15 October 2009|publisher=HarperBusiness|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from the key stakeholders, including boards, governments, regulators, [[shareholder]]s, staff, suppliers and customers to effectively address the issues of security, [[preparedness]], risk, and survivability.

# Being resilient is a proactive and determined attitude to remain a thriving enterprise (country, region, organization or company) despite the anticipated and unanticipated challenges that will emerge; 
# Resilience moves beyond a defensive security and protection posture and applies the entity’s inherent strength to withstand crisis and deflect attacks of any nature; 
# Resilience is the empowerment of being aware of your situation, your risks, vulnerabilities and current capabilities to deal with them, and being able to make informed tactical and strategic decisions; and, 
# Resilience is an objectively measurable competitive differentiator (i.e., more secure, increased stakeholder and shareholder value).
An organization that realizes the benefits of the above definitions of resilience will have a high likelihood of maintaining a successful and thriving enterprise.

Previously, it was considered that 'organisational resilience' could only be generated from processes and functions such as [[Risk Management]], [[Business Continuity]], IT [[Disaster Recovery]], [[Crisis Management]], [[Information Security]], [[Operational continuity]], Physical Security and so on. These are recognised as key contributors to operational resilience, and “the positive ability of a system or company to adapt itself to the consequences of a catastrophic failure caused by power outage, a fire, a bomb or similar” event or as "the ability of a [system] to cope with change".&lt;ref&gt;Wieland, A. &amp; Wallenburg, C.M.

== Importance ==

Global turbulence is expected. Competition, instability and uncertainty are constants in a changing world. Organizations face an unprecedented and growing number of potential disruptions to the status quo and the best laid strategic plans. As history repeats itself, prominent organizations will fail unless modern risk management and governance models incorporate scalable resilience metrics.

To survive and prosper in this new environment of heightened uncertainty and change, organizations must move past traditional risk and governance models and focus instead on resilience. Resilience applies at all levels: national, regional, organizational and corporate. At the national level, major infrastructure concerns and societal institutions must be robust enough, and unencumbered by legal and regulatory constraints, to serve the national good in normal operations, in crisis, and in recovery. At the regional levels, specific infrastructure assets come together in highly interdependent ways to serve local constituents and be a part of a national infrastructure. At the organizational and corporate level (which owns or operates the vast majority of our critical infrastructure assets), individual companies and operating units must ensure their business operations and service delivery capacities remain able to perform their primary business functions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techzone360.com/topics/techzone/articles/2015/12/03/413946-saying-do-resilience-10-potential-barriers-business-bliss.htm Demrovsky, Chloe. Saying 'I Do' to Resilience: 10 Potential Barriers to Business Bliss. TechZone360. December 3, 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Business continuity and competitiveness ==

[[Yossi Sheffi]] extended the resilience concept to business continuity initiatives in his 2005 book ''The Resilient Enterprise''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Yossi|last=Sheffi|url=http://resilient-enterprise.mit.edu/ |title=The Resilient Enterprise: Overcoming Vulnerability for Competitive Enterprise|publisher=MIT Press|date=October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheffi analyzed how disruptions can adversely affect the operations of corporations and how investments in resilience can give a business a competitive advantage over entities not prepared for various contingencies. Business organizations such as the [[Council on Competitiveness]] have embraced resilience and have tied economic competitiveness to security.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compete.org/publications/detail/31/the-resilient-economy-integrating-competitiveness-and-security/ Transform. The Resilient Economy]. Integrating Competitiveness and Security. Council on Competitiveness. July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Reform Institute]] has highlighted the need to enhance the resilience of the [[supply chain]] and [[electrical grid]] against disruptions that could cripple the U.S. economy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.policyarchive.org/bitstream/handle/10207/8649/Supply_Chain_2-19-08_in_template03-06-08.pdf?sequence=1 Chain of Perils: Hardening the Global Supply Chain and Strengthening America's Resilience].

Many experts and leaders see resilience as a vital component to a [[homeland security]] strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine McIntire Peters.

== Growing support in Washington, D.C. ==

Prominent members in the United States Congress are embracing resilience. The Chairman of the Homeland Security Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, Bennie Thompson (D-MS) declared May 2008 “Resilience Month” as the committee and its subcommittees held a series of hearings to examine the issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hlswatch.com/2008/05/01/%e2%80%9cresilience%e2%80%9d-blooming-into-its-own/ 'Resilience' Blooming Into Its Own].

CQ Homeland Security. May 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; President Obama&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/agenda/homeland_security/ Homeland Security]. whitehouse.gov. Retrieved 2009-04-05.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Department of Homeland Security]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/DHS_StratPlan_FINAL_spread.pdf One Team, One Mission, Securing Our Homeland].

Homeland Security Advisory Council. September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; have also made resilience an integral component of homeland security policy.

The Quadrennial Homeland Security Review, released by the [[Department of Homeland Security]] in February 2010, made resilience a prominent theme and one of the core missions of the U.S. homeland security enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/qhsr_report.pdf Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Report: A Strategic Framework for a Secure Homeland]. U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security. February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competitive advantage in business ==

Business and government enterprises that are able to quickly adapt to or seize [[competitive advantage]] from sudden and/or significant changes in their environments, with minimal interruption to their enterprise missions and manageable impact to their market value, as well as adapt to change in an apparently slower, more evolutionary manner - sometimes over many years or decades - can be described as being more resilient&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newsday.com/2.811/jamie-herzlich/small-business-a-good-plan-shields-from-storm-clouds-1.1322137?firstfree=yes&lt;/ref&gt;. Leading [[management consultancies]] and national governments including the Australia, [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] and the [[UK Cabinet Office]] believe that an organization’s resilience, properly understood, has critical implications for its competitive posture, profitability and shareholder value.

Over the past years, business, academic and government leaders have become aware that certain organizations respond better to disruptions than other, often similarly situated, organizations. For example, a September 2003 Harvard Business Review article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Harvard Business Review|year=2003|title=The Quest for Resilience|author=Gary Hamel and Liisa Välikangis|url=http://www.hbr.org/2003/09/the-quest-for-resilience/ar/1}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that “momentum is not the force it once was” in ensuring an organization’s success. They noted the emergence of several disruptive trends — including technological discontinuities, regulatory upheavals, [[geopolitical]] shocks, industry [[deverticalization]] and [[disintermediation]], abrupt shifts in consumer tastes, and hordes of nontraditional competitors — that require companies to become resilient to remain successful. The authors concluded that “strategic resilience is not about responding to a one-time crisis.  It’s not about rebounding from a setback. It’s about continuously anticipating and adjusting to deep, secular trends that can permanently impair the earning power of a core business. It’s about having the capacity to change before the case for change becomes desperately obvious.”

Resilience also has important implications for governance processes and systems. In a 2004 white paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2004|title=Redefining the Corporate Governance Agenda |publisher=[[Booz Allen Hamilton]] and Weil, Gotschal and Manges LLP |url=http://www.boozallen.com/media/file/138022.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the authors wrote that “enterprise resilience marries risk assessment, information reporting, and governance processes with strategic and business planning to create an enterprise-wide early warning capability that is embedded in the business of the company.” They explained that “Enterprise Resilience is predicated on an expanded view of risk—one that focuses on value, and therefore encompasses not only traditional risks (e.g., financial, natural hazards, physical security, legal, compliance) but also risks relating to earnings drivers (e.g., innovation, channel relationships, intellectual property) and company culture.”

Over the past decade, governments worldwide have also become increasingly focused on protecting their facilities, technologies, networks, personnel and other mission-critical assets from attack or misappropriation. The risk of cyber-terrorism and other threats to critical infrastructure are of particular concern.  On March 31, 2011, the President issued Presidential Policy Directive Eight (PPD-8)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PPD-8|url=https://www.dhs.gov/presidential-policy-directive-8-national-preparedness}}&lt;/ref&gt; that directed the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to develop a national preparedness system with the objective of strengthening the security and resilience of the United States through systematic preparation for the threats that pose the greatest risk to the security of the Nation, including acts of terrorism, cyber attacks, pandemics, and catastrophic natural disasters. The directive defined resilience as “the ability to adapt to changing conditions and withstand and rapidly recover from disruption due to emergencies.”

===Security===
[[Security]], whether applied to physical, financial, personnel, cyber information or any other asset, entails the measures to protect against danger or loss with emphasis on being protected from dangers that originate from outside. A significant [[security breach|breach in security]] could certainly impair an organizations ability to exist, and thus is a critical concept underlying the organization’s capacity to be resilient. Resilience is proactive in positioning the company to survive and thrive given known and unknown challenges. Security, as generally practiced, provides specific protection against identified or projected circumstances.

===Protection===
Protection is often associated with the set of actions to harden assets to withstand identified contingencies, mitigate the damage, or make them an unattractive target. The focus is to maintain the assets’ core function and ward off harm. Typically, protection performance objectives are stated as an absolute capability against varying levels of threat (category II or greater hurricane, defined types of breaches, specific acts). Organizations plan for protection against specific threats or categories of threats. Resilience approaches the issue from a standpoint of taking reasonable protective actions, but having alternative capabilities as needed or the ability to withstand the disruption.

===Crisis management===
[[Crisis management]] generally refers to the set of actions and capabilities in place to effectively respond to and contain a situation. The situation can vary from natural, man-made, or environmental challenges, whether internally or externally generated. Most consider crisis management to largely consist of actions that go into play when the crisis occurs and subside after it is considered “over”. There are plans and preparations, but the actions are not often dealt with as part of normal operations. Resilience depends on effective crisis management, but would encourage more prominent treatment of crisis management capabilities throughout the company’s operation than is often the case.

===Preparedness===
[[Preparedness]] consists of the plans of actions for when the disaster or crisis strikes.  Preparedness efforts are very specific sets of tactical actions (evacuation plans, sheltering plans, rehearsals, stockpiles, etc.) that the company and individuals will take to mitigate the effects of predicted disasters/crises. Resilience requires prudent and serious attention to preparations for known likely disasters, particularly those that are highly likely (e.g., hurricanes in Florida). Resiliency would address preparedness as a specific emergency management business function; but more importantly, as being impacted by numerous functions across the organization. These may include human resources, strategic planning, financial management, information technology, and risk management.

===Risk management===
[[Risk management]] consists of formal processes to identify threats and vulnerabilities to the company, and the mitigation approaches it will employ. Risk management is highly sophisticated and the results have application in managing the business, insurance coverage, and in attracting investors. The risk management profession is moving toward a more proactive and return on investment focus, but the traditional focus has been defensive in nature. Identifying and managing risks, particularly operational risks, is arguably the most important factor in achieving resilience; however, it is one of many factors. Resiliency has a healthy consideration of posturing for future opportunities. That is not a traditional consideration in risk management.

== Making resilience reality ==

Some scholars have identified the four facets of resilience as preparedness, protection, response and recovery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.policyarchive.org/bitstream/handle/10207/9662/Building_Resilience_OCT6.pdf?sequence=1 Building A Resilient Nation: Enhancing Security, Ensuring a Strong Economy report]. Reform Institute. October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, are adopting the resilience concept.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/resilientnation Resilient Nation]. Demos. April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalcommission.vic.gov.au/getdoc/cd99d136-6195-4b70-b6f4-46202d717f1e/TEN.047.001.0001.pdf Improving Disaster Resilience]. Australian Government. May 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the United Kingdom, resilience is implemented locally by the [[Local Resilience Forum]].

==Measuring resilience==
As part of the Canterbury University Resilient Organisations programme, ResOrgs have developed a tool for benchmarking the Resilience of Organisations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.resorgs.org.nz/ Resilient Organisations]. March 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Resilience Diagnostic is an assessment made up of 11 categories, each evaluated by a set of 5 to 7 questions. These categories are defined as either asset or liability. A person’s resilience is determined by the sum of all asset scores divided by the sum of all liability scores, producing a Resilience Ratio. The Resilience Ratio can be reflected both on an organizational and individual level and the assessment provides self-coaching options for participants. Developed in 2011 by The Resilience Institute, the Resilience Diagnostic has been used by corporations worldwide, with key insights reflected in the Global Resilience Report 2016. &lt;ref&gt;[https://resiliencei.com/resilience-diagnostic/ Resilience Diagnostic]. November 28, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resilience as an acquired skill==
In [[Organizational Studies]], resilience is often referred to as the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Here, resilience emerges as the response to specific interruptions of the normal. Sutcliffe and Vogus&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.husdal.com/2010/10/14/organizing-resilience/ Organizing for Resilience] Sutcliffe, K. M., &amp; Vogus, T. J. (2003). In K. S. Cameron, J. E. Dutton &amp; R. E. Quinn (Eds.), Positive Organizational Scholarship: Foundations of a New Discipline (pp. 94-110). San Francisco: Berett-Koehler Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; argue that resilience should rather be viewed from a developmental perspective, as an ability that develops over time from continually handling risks. Resilience, then, is "the continuing ability to use internal and external resources successfully to resolve new issues". Thus, "resilience is the capacity to rebound from adversity strengthened and more resourceful".

==Organizational Resilience Management Standard==
[[ASIS International]] have developed and published the definitive Organizational Resilience Management Standard SPC.1-2009. Approved by ANSI and adopted by the Department of Homeland Security under the PS-Prep program, this American Standard provides a practical basis for implementation of preparedness objectives supported by ASIS ORMS (Organizational Resilience Management System) software.

[[Captain (United States)#U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Public Health Service, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|Captain]] '''Robert F. R. Lewis''' (30 January 1826 – 23 February 1881) was an [[Commissioned officer|officer]] in the [[United States Navy]]. He participated in the [[Paraguay Expedition]], fought in the [[Mexican–American War|Mexican War]] and [[American Civil War]], and served briefly as commander of the [[Asiatic Squadron]].

==Naval career==
Lewis was born on 30 January 1826 in [[Washington, D.C.]]. He was appointed as a [[midshipman]] in October 1841 and immediately was attached to the [[sloop-of-war]] {{USS|Warren|1827|6}}, which was [[Fitting-out|fitting out]] at [[Norfolk Navy Yard]] in [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]], [[Virginia]], at the time.  Before ''Warren'' could put to sea, however, Lewis was transferred to the [[receiving ship]] {{USS|Pennsylvania|1837|6}} at the navy yard, remaining aboard her for a few months. In 1842, he was attached to the sloop-of-war {{USS|Vandalia|1828|6}}, and served aboard her until 1845 off the coast of [[Africa]] and in the [[West Indies Squadron (United States)|West Indies Squadron]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamersly, 1870, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Hamersly, 1878, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/books/callahan/reg-usn-l.htm Naval History and Heritage Command: Officers of the Continental and U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, 1775-1900.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexican War===
Lewis next reported to the sloop-of-war {{USS|Cyane|1837|6}} at [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], Virginia, and served aboard her in the [[Pacific Squadron]] from 1845 to 1848. Aboard ''Cyane'', he took part in the [[Mexican–American War|Mexican War]], seeing action in the capture of [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], [[California]] – then a part of [[Mexico]] – the destruction of a Mexican [[artillery battery]] at [[San Blas, Nayarit|San Blas]], the seizure of [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz]] in [[Baja California]], and the bombardment of [[Guaymas]] in [[Sonora]], where ''Cyane'' cut out the Mexican [[brig]] ''Condor'' while under fire from Mexican troops and [[artillery]] ashore and burned the small Mexican fleet there. ''Cyane'' went on to clear the [[Gulf of California]] of Mexican ships over the course of the next month and participated in the capture of [[Mazatlán]] before relieving the [[Siege of San José del Cabo|siege]] by Mexican troops and [[Yaqui people|Yaqui Indians]] of [[San José del Cabo]]. Upon ''Cyane''{{'}}s return to the [[United States]] at the conclusion of the war in 1848, [[United States Secretary of the Navy]] [[John Y. Mason]] congratulated her crew for their significant contribution to the American victory.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/c16/cyane-ii.htm ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships'': ''Cyane'' II]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1848–1861===
After returning to the United States, Lewis reported to the [[United States Naval Academy]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], [[Maryland]], in 1848 and passed his examination. Sources differ on the date of his promotion to [[passed midshipman]], stating both that it came on 10 August 1847&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; while he was aboard ''Cyane'' and that it was in 1849&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; after he passed his examination at the Naval Academy.

In 1849, Lewis went aboard the [[Steamboat|steamer]] {{USS|Vixen|1846|6}}, aboard which he cruised in the [[West Indies]] and along the [[Spanish Main]]. In 1850, he transferred to the [[United States Naval Observatory]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], for a few months, then in 1851 detached to serve aboard commercial steamers of the [[Collins Line]] on two or three [[transatlantic voyage]]s between [[New York City]] and [[Liverpool]], [[England]]. In 1852 he began an 18-month tour aboard the sloop-of-war {{USS|Preble|1839|6}}, in service at the time as a [[training]] ship at the Naval Academy, then reported to the brig {{USS|Dolphin|1836|6}}, which was fitting out at the Norfolk Navy Yard at the time. Before ''Dolphin'' sailed, he transferred in 1853 to the [[stores ship]] {{USS|Supply|1846|6}}, which was fitting out at the [[New York Navy Yard]] in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. During his two years aboard ''Supply'', he was promoted to [[Master (naval)|master]] on 14 September 1855 and to [[lieutenant]] the following day, but he detached from ''Supply'' in 1855 before she embarked on the first of her two voyages to the [[Mediterranean]] to bring [[camel]]s from the [[Ottoman Empire]] home to the United States for experimental use by the [[United States Army]]{{'}}s [[U.S. Camel Corps|Camel Corps]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/s20/supply-i.htm ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships'': ''Supply'' I]&lt;/ref&gt;

After a short leave period, Lewis was assigned to the receiving ship {{USS|Allegheny|1847|6}} at [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], Maryland, in 1856. He transferred to the new [[sailing frigate]] {{USS|Sabine|1855|6}} in 1858 and served aboard her during a three-year cruise, during which she took part in the [[Paraguay Expedition]] and operated in the West Indies.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

===American Civil War===
Lewis was aboard ''Sabine'' when the [[American Civil War]] broke out in April 1861. He spent his last few months aboard ''Sabine'' on duty in the [[Union blockade]] of the [[Confederate States of America]], serving in the [[blockade]] of [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], [[Florida]]. He commanded a group of boats which carried reinforcements to [[Fort Pickens]] under threat from Confederate [[Fort McRae]] and was made [[executive officer]] of ''Sabine''. After ''Sabine'' was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] at the [[Portsmouth Navy Yard]] in [[Kittery, Maine|Kittery]], [[Maine]], later in 1861, Lewis took a [[leave of absence]] from the Navy, but returned to service later in the year as executive officer of the steamer {{USS|De Soto|1859|6}} in the [[West Gulf Blockading Squadron]]. He was promoted to [[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|lieutenant commander]] on 16 July 1862.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In 1862, Lewis became [[commanding officer]] of the [[gunboat]] {{USS|Itasca|1861|6}} on the [[Mississippi River]], leading her in action at [[Man Shack Bend]]. ''Itasca'' later was reassigned to the blockade of [[Texas]], where Lewis led her in an engagement with a Confederate artillery battery at [[Velasco, Texas|Velasco]], in the capture of two [[blockade runner]]s, and in running aground and destroying two or three other blockade runners.  After ''Itasca'' was ordered north to undergo repairs in 1863, Lewis was detached from her and took a short leave of absence.&lt;ref&gt;Hamersly, 1878, pp. 138-139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon returning to service, Lewis spent three months at Baltimore, Maryland, to oversee the repair and fitting out of ships there, then was sent to the [[South Atlantic Blockading Squadron]] in 1864, where he commanded successively the [[Barque|bark]] {{USS|Ethan Allen|1859|6}}, the gunboat {{USS|Nipsic}}, the sidewheel steamer {{USS|Mahaska|1861|6}}, and the [[Monitor (ship)|monitor]] {{USS|Nantucket|1862|6}} in the blockade of [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], South Carolina, and on the [[St. Johns River]]. He was in command of ''Nantucket'' when she closed to destroy a stranded blockade runner with gunfire off Charleston and engaged the Confederate artillery batteries on [[Sullivan's Island, South Carolina|Sullivan's Island]], as well as during later duty at [[Port Royal, South Carolina|Port Royal]], South Carolina, when ''Nantucket'' guarded the receiving ship {{USS|New Hampshire|1864|6}} in case ''New Hampshire'' was targeted by the [[Confederate States Navy]] [[Ironclad warship|ironclad]] [[Japanese ironclad Kōtetsu#American career as CSS Stonewall|CSS ''Stonewall'']]. After the Civil War ended in April 1865, Lewis brought ''Nantucket'' to Philadelphia, where she was laid up.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Hamersly, 1878, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Civil War===
In 1865, Lewis joined the staff of the Naval Academy, first as senior instructor in [[seamanship]] and later as superintendent of grounds and buildings, and was promoted to [[Commander (United States)|commander]] on 29 January 1867. From 1869 to 1871 he commanded the steamer {{USS|Resaca|1865|6}} in the [[Pacific Squadron]], then was on the Board of Inspectors from 1871 to 1874. He served in the [[Asiatic Squadron]] from 1874 to 1875, first in command of the gunboat {{USS|Yantic|IX-32|6}} and then in command of the sloop-of-war {{USS|Kearsarge|1861|6}}, and he temporarily served as commander of the entire squadron from 24 June to 16 August 1875. Detaching from ''Kearsarge'' in November 1875, he returned to the United States and spent four months awaiting orders before reporting for duty as Inspector of [[Military logistics|Ordnance]] at the Norfolk Navy Yard. He was promoted to captain on 26 February 1878.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tolley, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 September 1879, Lewis took command of the [[Screw sloop|screw sloop-of-war]] {{USS|Shenandoah|1862|6}} two days before she [[Ship commissioning|recommissioned]] for service in the [[South Atlantic Squadron]] as the [[flagship]] of [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Andrew Bryson]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=reQxAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=%22robert+f.+r.+lewis%22++shenandoah&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=W2GhLIxodX&amp;sig=W1A_y2-K0cHQdPjNCL51tN2jfhc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pVEUUJ_iLYLc6wHR2oCYDA&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22robert%20f.%20r.%20lewis%22%20%20shenandoah&amp;f=false ''General Register of the Commissioned, Warrant, and Volunteer Officers of the Navy of the United States Including Officers of the Marine Corps and Others to 1 July 1880'', Government Printing Office: Washington, D.C., 1880, p. 9.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Lewis was married to Henrietta A. Lewis (31 March 1830 – 12 August 1915).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/58092512 Find-A-Grave Memorial: Henrietta A. Lewis (1830-1915)]&lt;/ref&gt; They had five living children at the time of his death.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sFpHAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA413&amp;lpg=PA413&amp;dq=%22robert+f.+r.+lewis%22++dead&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rdS0xT3TO8&amp;sig=EFrjas_bF_ARARjXL3X5hLjPY50&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=b1UUUMmYLK-e6QGi-oCQBQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22robert%20f.%20r.%20lewis%22%20%20dead&amp;f=false Reports of Committees of the Senate of the United States For the First Session of the Forty-Eighth Congress, 1883-{{'}}84: Views of Minority, No. 719, p. 1.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Lewis contracted an illness while aboard ''Shenandoah'' and became sick enough to be ordered to return to the United States for treatment.  During the voyage home, he died at sea off [[Martinique]] on 23 February 1881.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn90059228/1881-03-16/ed-1/seq-2.pdf chroniclingamerica.com "Current Events", ''Warren Sheaf'', 16 March 1881.]&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried with his wife at the [[United States Naval Academy Cemetery]] in Annapolis, Maryland.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/books/callahan/reg-usn-y.htm Naval History and Heritage Command: Officers of the Continental and U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, 1775-1900] and other sources report Lewis{{'}}s date of death as 23 February 1881; the date of 28 February 1881 given at [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/58092621 Find-A-Grave Memorial: Robert F. R. Lewis (1826-1881)] appears to result from a misreading of the date on Lewis{{'}}s [[headstone]], on which "23 February" has been worn enough to be misread as "28 February."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harry Leroy Halladay III'''&lt;ref name="BlueBio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=136880|title=Roy Halladay Biography|access-date=September 6, 2008|work=[[MLB]]|publisher=[[Toronto Blue Jays]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (May 14, 1977 – November 7, 2017), known commonly as '''Roy Halladay''' and often nicknamed "'''Doc'''", was an American professional [[baseball]] player who pitched in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) for the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] and [[Philadelphia Phillies]] between 1998 and 2013. His nickname, coined by Toronto Blue Jays announcer [[Tom Cheek]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/bluejays/2013/03/29/roy_halladay_blue_jays_go_separate_ways_griffin.html|title=Roy Halladay, Blue Jays go separate ways: Griffin|last=Griffin|first=Richard|work=thestar.com|date=March 29, 2013|access-date=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a reference to Wild West gunslinger [[Doc Holliday]].

Halladay was the Blue Jays' first draft selection in the [[1995 Major League Baseball draft|1995 MLB draft]], the 17th pick overall, and played for the team from 1998 through 2009, after which he was traded to Philadelphia. Halladay was known for his ability to pitch deep into games effectively and, at the time of his retirement, was the active major league leader in [[complete game]]s with 67, including 20 [[Shutouts in baseball|shutouts]].&lt;ref name="Complete Games"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/stats/sortable.jsp#statType=pitching&amp;sectionType=sp&amp;playerType=ALL&amp;page_type=SortablePlayer&amp;season=&amp;season_type=ALL&amp;sportCode='mlb'&amp;league_code='MLB'&amp;split=&amp;team_id=&amp;active_sw='Y'&amp;game_type='R'&amp;position='1'&amp;sortOrder='desc'&amp;sortColumn=cg&amp;results=&amp;page=1&amp;perPage=50&amp;timeframe=&amp;extended=1&amp;last_x_days=&amp;ts=1316304787803&amp;tab_level=child&amp;click_text=Sortable+Player+pitching|title=Sortable Player Stats|website=Major League Baseball|accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 29, 2010, [[Roy Halladay's perfect game|Halladay pitched the 20th perfect game]] in MLB history, beating the [[Florida Marlins]] by a score of 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/sports/baseball/30phillies.html|title=This Time, It's Halladay Who's Perfect|author=Kepner, Tyler|date=May 29, 2010|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 6, 2010, in his first postseason start, Halladay threw the second [[no-hitter]] in MLB [[Major League Baseball postseason|postseason]] history ([[Don Larsen]]'s perfect game in the [[1956 World Series]] being the first) against the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in Game 1 of the [[2010 National League Division Series|2010 NLDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=301006122|title=Cincinnati Reds vs. Philadelphia Phillies – Recap|date=October 6, 2010|work=ESPN|access-date=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;His game jersey was donated to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]].{{cite web|first=Bob|last=Brookover|title=Inside the Phillies: On day after, Doc sticks to routine|date=October 8, 2010|publisher=Philadelphia Media Network|work=Philly.com|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/homepage/20101008_Inside_the_Phillies__On_day_after__Doc_sticks_to_routine.html|access-date=October 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was his second no-hitter of the year (following the May 29 perfect game), making Halladay the fifth pitcher in major league history (and the first since [[Nolan Ryan]] in 1973) to throw multiple no-hitters in the same season. During the 2012 season, he became the 67th pitcher to record 2,000 strikeouts. Halladay was also one of six pitchers in MLB history to win the [[Cy Young Award]] in both the [[American League|American]] and [[National League]]s.

On November 7, 2017, Halladay died when his [[ICON A5]] amphibious plane crashed into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] off the coast of Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/mlb/roy-halladay-killed-plane-crash-1.4391632|title=Blue Jays great Roy Halladay killed in small plane crash|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=November 7, 2017|access-date=November 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/21331438/roy-halladay-40-dies-plane-crash-gulf-mexico|title=Ex-MLB star Halladay, 40, dies in plane crash|publisher=|accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blue Jays organization posthumously retired his number 32 on March 29, 2018.

==Early life==
Born in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], Halladay grew up in the suburb of [[Arvada, Colorado|Arvada]]; his father, Roy II, was a pilot for a food-processing company, while his mother, Linda, was a [[homemaker]].&lt;ref name="family"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saunders|first1=Patrick|title=Former players, coaches remember Roy Halladay for work ethic, character|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2017/11/07/roy-halladay-dies-at-40-plane-crash/|accessdate=11 December 2017|work=[[The Denver Post]]|date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From an early age, Halladay loved baseball, trying every position on the field until, by age 14, his success on the pitcher's mound attracted the attention of major league scouts. By the age of 13, he had begun training with Colorado baseball guru Bus Campbell, who had helped almost every promising pitcher from the Denver area, including [[Goose Gossage]] and [[Brad Lidge]].&lt;ref name="SLTribune1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sltrib.com/portlet/article/html/fragments/print_article.jsp?articleId=14075229&amp;siteId=297|title=More More than an ace on the hill|newspaper=Salt Lake Tribune|date=December 26, 2009|access-date=December 27, 2009|first=Dan|last=Hagen|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924131618/http://www.sltrib.com/portlet/article/html/fragments/print_article.jsp?articleId=14075229&amp;siteId=297|archive-date=September 24, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, after graduating from [[Arvada West High School]],&lt;ref name="BlueBio" /&gt; he was selected by the Toronto Blue Jays in the amateur draft, in the [[List of Toronto Blue Jays first-round draft picks|first round, as the 17th overall pick]]. Halladay decided to forego his [[college baseball]] commitment to [[Arizona Wildcats baseball|Arizona]] and sign with Toronto.&lt;ref name="drafted"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Devlin|first1=Neil H.|title=Blue Jays declare Roy Halladay, Arvada West pitcher, is No. 1 in Toronto|url=http://www.denverpost.com/1995/06/02/roy-halladay-arvada-west-toronto-blue-jays-draft/|accessdate=11 December 2017|work=[[The Denver Post]]|date=2 June 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to the major-league club as a September call-up in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mattbeam.com/content/jour_halladay.htm|title=Arm Force: Roy Halladay - Toronto Life|website=www.mattbeam.com|accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Toronto Blue Jays (1998–2009)===
====1998–2001====
In his second career start, against the [[1998 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] on September 27, [[1998 Toronto Blue Jays season|1998]], Halladay had what would have been the third [[no-hitter]] ever pitched on the final day of a regular season broken up with two outs in the ninth. The feat would have joined the combined no-hitter by four [[1984 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] pitchers ([[Vida Blue]], [[Glenn Abbott]], [[Paul Lindblad]], and [[Rollie Fingers]]) in [[1975 Oakland Athletics season|1975]] and [[Mike Witt]]'s [[perfect game]] in [[1984 California Angels season|1984]]. The bid was broken up by pinch hitter [[Bobby Higginson]]'s solo home run, the only hit allowed in a {{nowrap|2–1}} Toronto victory, as he recorded his first major {{nowrap|league win.&lt;ref name=roofhs&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RYxXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BfIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5482%2C6005299 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington)|agency=Associated Press |title=Rookie one out from history |date=September 28, 1998 |page=C2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/csn/phillies/The_moments_Chase_Utley_realized_Roy_Halladay_s_eminence-456273983.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 8, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208122610/https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/csn/phillies/The_moments_Chase_Utley_realized_Roy_Halladay_s_eminence-456273983.html |archive-date=December 8, 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}   Prior to the home run, the sole base runner had reached on an infield error in the fifth inning, as Halladay struck out eight and {{nowrap|walked none.&lt;ref name=roofhs/&gt;}}

During the [[2000 Toronto Blue Jays season|2000]] season, Halladay sported a 10.64 [[earned run average]] (ERA) in 19 games, 13 of which he started, making his 2000 season the worst in history for any pitcher with at least fifty [[innings pitched]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/writers/joe_sheehan/05/30/roy.halladay/index.html|title=Roy Halladay was perfect, but he has pitched better games|last=Sheehan|first=Joe|date=May 30, 2010|work=Sports Illustrated|access-date=October 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zolecki|first=Todd|title=Sent to 'pen, Martin gets encouragement from Doc|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130906&amp;content_id=59732246&amp;notebook_id=59756582&amp;vkey=notebook_phi&amp;c_id=phi|work=phillies.com: News|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|access-date=September 7, 2013|date=September 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the [[2001 Toronto Blue Jays season|2001]] season, Halladay was optioned to Class A [[Dunedin Blue Jays|Dunedin]] to rebuild his delivery.

Halladay's fastball was clocked up to {{convert|95|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, but it had little movement, and his pitches were up in the strike zone, which was ultimately the reason why his 2000 season was so unsuccessful. He worked with former Blue Jays pitching coach [[Mel Queen, Jr.|Mel Queen]]. The problem, Queen realized, was Halladay's total reliance on his strength—his attempt to overpower batters with straight-ahead pitches. Within two weeks, Halladay had altered his arm angle for a more deceptive delivery, and added pitches that sank and careened.&lt;ref name="USAToday1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/al/bluejays/2008-05-08-jayshalladay_N.htm?loc=interstitialskip|title=Innings-eater Halladay gives Jays bullpen holiday - USATODAY.com|website=www.usatoday.com|accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of throwing over the top, he chose to use a three-quarters delivery (the middle point between throwing overhand and sidearm). Originally a fastball pitcher, he became reliant on keeping his pitches low across the plate, regardless of the type of pitch thrown. The adjustments proved successful. After a month and a half, he was promoted to Double-A [[Tennessee Smokies|Tennessee]], and a month later, to Triple-A [[Syracuse Chiefs|Syracuse]]. By mid-season, he was back in the Blue Jays' rotation. He posted a 5–3 [[Win–loss record (pitching)|win–loss record]] with a 3.19 ERA for the Blue Jays in 16 starts in 2001.

====2002–2006====
[[File:Roy Halladay pitches wp.jpg|thumb|right|Halladay with Toronto in 2006]]
In 2001, after being demoted to the minor leagues, Halladay immersed himself in the works of [[sports psychologist]] [[Harvey Dorfman]]. This exposure was at least partly responsible for resurrecting his career.&lt;ref name="psych" /&gt; In [[2002 Toronto Blue Jays season|2002]], Halladay had a breakout season, finishing with a 19–7 record, while posting a 2.93 ERA with 168 strikeouts in 239.1 innings. Halladay was named to the American League [[2002 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] team.

Halladay continued his success in the [[2003 Toronto Blue Jays season|2003]] season, posting a 22–7 record with a 3.25 ERA in 266 innings. He also recorded 204 strikeouts and only 32 walks, good for a 6.38 [[strikeout-to-walk ratio]]. Halladay pitched the first extra-inning shutout in the major leagues since [[Jack Morris]] in Game 7 of the [[1991 World Series]], leading the Blue Jays to victory over the Tigers on September 6. He pitched 10 innings and had not allowed a hit until [[Kevin Witt]] doubled with two outs in the top of the eighth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=230906114|title=Blue Jays pitcher took no-hitter into eighth|agency=Associated Press|date=September 6, 2003|work=ESPN.com|access-date=April 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Halladay won the American League [[Cy Young Award]], while being once again named an All-Star and leading the Blue Jays to a surprising 86 victories. He was named by his peers as the ''[[Players Choice Award]]s'' AL Outstanding Pitcher. He was also named the [[Sporting News Pitcher of the Year Award|''Sporting News'' AL Pitcher of the Year]] and the [[Baseball Prospectus Internet Baseball Awards|''Baseball Prospectus'' Internet Baseball Awards]] AL Cy Young Award winner.

In [[2004 Toronto Blue Jays season|2004]], Halladay was placed on the [[disabled list]] twice due to right shoulder problems. In just 133.0 innings, he went 8–8 with a 4.20 ERA. He walked 39 batters, seven more than he had walked in 2003 when he had pitched twice as many innings. He later revealed that he had been injured throughout the entire season with a "tired throwing arm", which he believed was from intense workouts in preseason.

The [[2005 Toronto Blue Jays season|2005]] season began successfully for Halladay, as he posted a 12–4 record with a 2.41 ERA in 19 starts. He was selected to his third All-Star team and was slated to be the starting pitcher for the [[American League]] at the [[2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] in [[Comerica Park|Detroit]]. However, on July 8, Halladay's leg was broken by a [[line drive]] off the bat of [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] left fielder [[Kevin Mench]].&lt;ref name="ESPN1" /&gt; As a result, he was replaced in the All-Star Game by [[Matt Clement]] of the [[2005 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]], while [[Mark Buehrle]] of the [[2005 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] was named the starting pitcher for the American League. Despite rehabilitation of his leg, Halladay would sit out the remainder of the season.

On March 16, [[2006 Toronto Blue Jays season|2006]], Halladay signed a [[United States dollar|$]]40 million three-year contract extension through 2010.&lt;ref name="ESPN1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2371102|title=Halladay agrees to extension through 2010|date=March 16, 2006|agency=Associated Press|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|access-date=December 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that year, Halladay finished near the top of the MLB in wins with 16. He was named to the American League All-Star Team as a reserve on July 3, along with four of his Blue Jays teammates. It marked the second-most appearances in club history, and Halladay's fourth as an All-Star. Although Halladay's strikeout total was lower in 2006 than in previous seasons, his [[ground ball/fly ball ratio]], complete games, and innings pitched were all among the American League leaders.

====2007–2009====
Halladay was the American League [[Pitcher of the Month|pitcher of the month]] in April [[2007 Toronto Blue Jays season|2007]], going 4–0, highlighted by a 10-inning complete game win over the [[2007 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]]. However, he pitched poorly in his two starts in May, and on May 11 was placed on the disabled list and underwent an [[appendectomy]]. He returned to the rotation in his usual form on May 31 against the [[Chicago White Sox]]. Halladay went 7 innings, giving up just six hits and allowing no runs on his way to his 100th career win. 2007 also saw Halladay hit his first career RBI. Against the [[2007 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] on June 10, his ground ball single to center field allowed [[John McDonald (infielder)|John McDonald]] to score. He shut out the [[2007 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]] on July 22, allowing only three hits.

In [[2008 Toronto Blue Jays season|2008]], for the sixth consecutive year, Halladay was Toronto's opening-day starter, improving his own club record.&lt;ref name="YahooSports1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/players/6134/news|title=Roy Halladay - Toronto - Major League Baseball - Yahoo! Sports|website=Yahoo Sports|accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lost 3–2 in a pitcher's duel with New York's [[Chien-Ming Wang]]. His first win of the season came in his next start against Boston, when he outpitched [[Josh Beckett]] in his season debut.

In his third start, Halladay pitched a complete game against the [[2008 Texas Rangers season|Texas Rangers]], in a 4–1 win. Three of his nine complete game efforts resulted in losses due to Toronto's underachieving offense early in the season. In fact, those three complete game losses came in three consecutive starts. On June 20 against the [[2008 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]], he was struck in the temple by a line-drive off the bat of [[Nyjer Morgan]]. The ball caromed off Halladay's head and was caught by third baseman [[Scott Rolen]], ending the inning. Halladay was able to walk back to the dugout, but was taken out of the game for safety concerns. Although he was given a clean bill of health for his next start, it was later suggested by television commentators that Halladay may have in fact suffered a temporary lapse in recognition of what happened on the play. Halladay pitched his 10th career [[shutouts in baseball|shutout]] against the [[Seattle Mariners]] on June 30. He limited them to four hits in his sixth complete game of the season. The shutout tied him with the Cardinals' [[Mark Mulder]] for 10th among active pitchers. On July 11, 2008, Halladay pitched his 7th complete game and second shutout of the season against the New York Yankees, allowing 0 runs on 2 hits for his 38th career complete game. Halladay was named to the American League All-Star Team as a reserve. He pitched in the fourth inning, yielding only one hit and striking out [[Lance Berkman]]. In his last start of the season, he fittingly pitched a complete game against the Yankees to win his 20th game of the year. In so doing, he became the first pitcher to win five games against the Yankees in a single season since [[Luis Tiant]] in 1974. In addition, he led the AL with a 1.05 [[Walks plus hits per inning pitched|WHIP]].

Halladay also became just the fourth pitcher in major league history to post two seasons of 200 strikeouts and fewer than 40 walks. He was presented the George Gross/[[Toronto Sun]] Sportsperson of the Year award.&lt;ref name=TorontoSunSportsperson&gt;{{cite web|last=Elliott|first=Bob|title=Doc delivers as role model: Our Sportsperson of the Year a champion on and off the pitching mound|date=December 14, 2008|work=[[Toronto Sun]]|url=http://www.torontosun.com/sports/baseball/2008/12/14/7745206-sun.html |access-date=January 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 6, [[2009 Toronto Blue Jays season|2009]], Halladay made his team-record seventh straight Opening Day start for Toronto, defeating the [[Detroit Tigers]]. Halladay then also won his next two starts, on the road against [[2009 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland]] and [[2009 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota]]. Halladay lost his next game to [[2009 Texas Rangers season|Texas]], giving up 5 earned runs over 8 innings only to go on and win his next 6 games to bring his record up to 8–1 with a 2.75 ERA. With season-ending injuries to planned 2009 Jays' starters [[Dustin McGowan]] and [[Shawn Marcum]], and with #2 starter [[Jesse Litsch]] on the disabled list early in the season, Halladay led a staff of young, mostly inexperienced starters. Halladay was named the AL Player of the Week for the period ending May 17. Doc was 2–0 with a 1.13 ERA over 16.0 innings in his two starts the week prior.&lt;ref&gt;http://mlb.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jspymd=20090518&amp;content_id=4800688&amp;vkey=pr_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb{{Dead link|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a game against the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]] on June 2, Halladay struck out 14 batters and threw 133 pitches, both career highs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090602&amp;content_id=5106764&amp;vkey=recap&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=tor.|title=With 14 K's, Halladay first to nine wins|date=June 2, 2009|first=Erika|last=Gilbert|work=MLB.com|access-date=June 3, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326084616/http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090602&amp;content_id=5106764&amp;vkey=recap&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=tor.|archive-date=March 26, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 12, he left the game early because of a strained [[Adductor muscles of the hip|hip adductor muscle]], commonly referred to as a ''pulled groin'', and was placed on the 15-day [[disabled list]] on June 17.

On July 14, he started the All-Star Game for the American League, pitching 2 innings and giving up 3 runs, of which 1 was unearned. That year, he was named #7 on the ''[[Sporting News]]'''s list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball. A panel of 100 baseball people, many of them members of the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] and winners of major baseball awards, was polled to arrive at the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jsonline.com/sports/45556307.html|title=Braun makes greatest list|date=May 20, 2009|first=Bob|last=Wolfey|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the conclusion of his start on September 20, 2009, Halladay was tied for the second-longest streak in the American League that season with a 24-inning scoreless streak.&lt;ref name="MLB3" /&gt; Halladay finished the season with a 17–10 record,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/TOR/2009.shtml|title=2009 Toronto Blue Jays Batting, Pitching, &amp; Fielding Statistics|work=Baseball-Reference.com|access-date=December 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving him a career win percentage of .660, good enough for 18th all-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/win_loss_perc_career.shtml|title=Career Leaders &amp; Records for Win-Loss %|work=Baseball-Reference.com|access-date=December 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' named Halladay as one of the five pitchers in the starting rotation of its [[List of 2009 all-decade Sports Illustrated awards and honors#MLB All-Decade Team|MLB All-Decade Team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Posnanski |first=Joe |date=9 December 2009 |title=Pujols, Jeter lead MLB All-Decade team |url=https://www.si.com/more-sports/2013/12/13/mlb-alldecadeteam |magazine=Sports Illustrated |access-date=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philadelphia Phillies (2010–2013)===

====2010====
[[File:Roy Halladay, May 30, 2011.jpg|thumb|Halladay pitching for the Phillies]]
On [[Opening Day]], Halladay pitched seven innings while giving up a run against the [[Washington Nationals]] in his first game with the Phillies. He had nine strikeouts and allowed six hits. He also drove in his second career RBI and earned his first win of the season. He followed this start with a complete game on April 11 against the [[Houston Astros]], giving up one unearned run while striking out eight and not giving up any walks in the Phillies' 2–1 victory.

Halladay pitched his first shutout in the National League, against the [[Atlanta Braves]] on April 21, becoming the first pitcher to reach four wins in the 2010 season. On May 1, Halladay pitched his second shutout of the season, limiting the [[New York Mets]] to three hits and striking out six.

On September 21, Halladay became the first Phillies pitcher to win 20 games in a season since [[Steve Carlton]] accomplished it in 1982. He was the first right-handed Phillies pitcher to accomplish the feat since [[Robin Roberts (baseball)|Robin Roberts]] in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.mcall.com/2010-09-22/sports/mc-philsbraves-gamer-0921-20100921-8_1_phillies-yankees-ace-cc-sabathia-magic-number|title=Halladay wins 20th|date=September 22, 2010|first=Mandy|last=Housenick|newspaper=The Allentown Morning Call}}&lt;/ref&gt; One week later, on September 27, he completed his 21st victory, helping the Phillies clinch their fourth consecutive National League East title, and the Phillies finished with the best regular season record in MLB.

Halladay made his first postseason start in Game One of the [[2010 National League Division Series|National League Division Series]], as the Phillies squared off against the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. Halladay threw a [[no-hitter]], giving up only one walk (to [[Jay Bruce]] in the fifth inning) in a 4–0 victory where he threw 104 pitches.

The Phillies swept the Reds in three games to advance to their third consecutive [[2010 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]], where they faced the [[San Francisco Giants]]. Halladay started Games One and Five, which were one of the most touted postseason pitching matchups in recent history as he faced another former Cy Young winner in both games, [[Tim Lincecum]]. Halladay lost Game One 4–3 and won Game Five 4–2, as the Phillies were eliminated in six games by the Giants, who went on to win the World Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/2010_NLCS.shtml|title=2010 NLCS - San Francisco Giants over Philadelphia Phillies (4-2)|website=Baseball-Reference.com|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Halladay was named by his peers as the ''[[Players Choice Award]]s'' NL Outstanding Pitcher. He was also unanimously chosen as the recipient of the 2010 National League [[Cy Young Award]], becoming the first Phillie to win the award since [[Steve Bedrosian]] in 1987 and only the fifth pitcher in MLB history to win the award in both leagues, joining [[Gaylord Perry]], [[Pedro Martínez]], [[Randy Johnson]] and [[Roger Clemens]].

On July 12, Halladay was the NL starting pitcher in the [[2011 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]]. Halladay went 19–6 in 2011, with a 2.35 ERA, and pitched 8 [[complete game]]s, second most in the Majors. The Phillies won their fifth consecutive National League East championship, and also finished with the best record in baseball for the second straight year.

Halladay was named the starter for Games One and Five during the [[National League Division Series]] against the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. He won Game One 11–6, but lost the Game Five 1–0, which was a duel with former Blue Jays teammate [[Chris Carpenter]]. This loss eliminated the Phillies from the playoffs, a disappointment as they were touted as heavy favorites for the World Series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Leach |first=Matthew |url=http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2011_10_07_slnmlb_phimlb_1&amp;mode=recap&amp;c_id=stl |title=Carpenter's gem sends Cardinals into NLCS: Game 1 against Brewers on Sunday in Milwaukee |work=[[MLB.com]] |date=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it would turn out to be Halladay's final postseason appearance. Reflecting on that series at his retirement, Halladay said "I think the one thing I took away from that is you can have the best team on paper, you can have the guys who want it the most. But when the [[Rally Squirrel|squirrel]] runs across home plate while your team is trying to pitch, there is nothing you can do about that."&lt;ref name="Berg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2013/12/roy-halladay-retires-phillies-blue-jays|title=Two-time Cy Young Award winner Roy Halladay retires|work=USA Today|first=Ted|last=Berg|date=December 9, 2013|access-date=December 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ESPN retirement announcement"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/10108609/roy-halladay-retires-toronto-blue-jay | title=Roy Halladay retires with Blue Jays | date=December 9, 2013 | access-date=December 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 5, 2012, Halladay threw 8 innings of shutout ball against the Pittsburgh Pirates on Opening Day, giving up 2 hits while striking out 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2012_04_05_atlmlb_nynmlb_1&amp;mode=recap&amp;c_id=nym#gid=2012_04_05_phimlb_pitmlb_1&amp;mode=recap&amp;c_id=phi|title=Doc dominates as Phillies shut out Pirates|work=MLB.com|first=Todd|last=Zolecki|date=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 29, Halladay was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a shoulder strain. It was his first DL stint since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120529&amp;content_id=32435974&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb|title=Shoulder strain sends Halladay to disabled list|work=MLB.com|first=A.J.|last=Cassavell|date=May 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a press conference on June 6, Halladay stated, "Ultimately, my goal is to finish my career with the Phillies and win a World Series here.

On May 5, Halladay gave up nine earned runs in just 2{{frac|1|3}} innings. The next day, Halladay was placed on the disabled list with a right shoulder injury. On May 8, it was announced that he would have surgery on his shoulder to have a bone spur removed. The surgery was also to address fraying of his labrum, and rotator cuff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130508&amp;content_id=46964158&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb|title=Doc set for surgery, hopeful for 2013 return|last=Meisel|first=Zack|publisher=MLB.com|date=May 8, 2013|access-date=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he was initially supposed to be making a rehab start in Double-A for the [[Reading Fightin' Phils]] that day, an 18-inning game the previous night caused the Phillies to have a shortage of pitchers and as such, Halladay returned to the major leagues on August 25 for a start against the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] in which he threw six innings, allowing two runs on four hits with two walks and two strikeouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Iseman|first=Chris|title=No issues for Halladay day after making return|url=http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130826&amp;content_id=58468394&amp;notebook_id=58468528&amp;vkey=notebook_phi&amp;c_id=phi|work=phillies.com: News|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|access-date=August 28, 2013|date=August 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approach to pitching==
[[File:Roy Halladay 2009 (2).jpg|thumb|left|Halladay in 2009, showing his characteristic sinker grip]]
Halladay's distinctiveness was characterized by his ability to throw a hard [[two-seam fastball|two-seam]] sinking fastball ranging in the low 90s with pinpoint control. In addition, he threw a four-seam fastball in the low 90s, a [[curveball]] in the high 70s, and [[cut fastball]] from 90–92&amp;nbsp;mph for which he had modified his grip in 2007 at the suggestion of former catcher [[Sal Fasano]].&lt;ref name="Canoe1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Baseball/MLB/Toronto/2007/06/28/4297312-sun.html|title=Fasano helped Marcum focus|first=Canoe|last=inc.|publisher=|accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Halladay threw the hardest cutter among MLB starters in the 2011 season, at an average of 91.4&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/pitchfx/leaderboards/index.php?hand=&amp;prp=P&amp;month=&amp;year=2011&amp;pitch=FS&amp;ds=gbfb&amp;lim=100|title=PitchFX Leaderboards|work=Baseball Prospectus|access-date=September 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[changeup]] was one pitch that Halladay had problems commanding for many years, and which he used very rarely. However, after joining the Phillies in 2010, Halladay started throwing a change-up pitch that was really a version of the [[split-finger fastball]] (called a "split-change") that he used as a strikeout pitch. The pitch was introduced to Halladay by pitching coach [[Rich Dubee]].&lt;ref name="Even Halladay finds a new pitch to use"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/phillies/20100516_Even_Halladay_finds_a_new_pitch_to_use.html|title=Even Halladay finds a new pitch to use|publisher=|accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his reputation as a ground ball pitcher who worked at an efficient pace, Halladay's strikeout totals increased steadily in the few final years of his career. Halladay's efficiency and durability were reflected in his total innings pitched every year, also due to his ability to strike out hitters and induce ground ball outs to escape jams. He often led the league in innings pitched and complete games, while ranking among the leaders in WHIP and ERA.

Prior to and during each start, Halladay had a distinct trademark in which he went into a complete "isolation mode," immersing himself in complete concentration in order to plan every pitch he would pitch while on the mound. During this time, he would not talk to anyone except the manager or the pitching coach. He would not even reply to a "hello" or wave from a teammate or spectator, nor talk to the media until he had been relieved or had completed the game.&lt;ref name="Sports Illustrated"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cnnsi.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?action=cpt&amp;title=Why+is+baseball%27s+best+pitcher+also+the+hardest+worker+in+-+04.05.10+-+SI+Vault&amp;expire=&amp;urlID=423852833&amp;fb=Y&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fsportsillustrated.cnn.com%2Fvault%2Farticle%2Fmagazine%2FMAG1167875%2F1%2Findex.htm&amp;partnerID=289881|title=What Makes Roy Run|date=April 5, 2010|access-date=August 2, 2010|first=Tom|last=Verducci|work=Sports Illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 7, 2017, Halladay died when the [[ICON A5]] Founders Edition amphibious aircraft, which he was piloting, crashed into the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref name= WTSP976&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtsp.com/news/former-mlb-pitcher-roy-halladay-killed-in-gulf-of-mexico-plane-crash/489944976|title=Former MLB pitcher Roy Halladay killed in Gulf of Mexico plane crash|date=November 7, 2017|access-date=November 7, 2017|work=[[WTSP]].com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Sportsnet crash"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/former-blue-jays-pitcher-roy-halladay-dead-plane-crash/|title=Former Blue Jays pitcher Roy Halladay dead in plane crash|last=Nicholson-Smith|first=Ben|work=[[Sportsnet]].ca |date=November 7, 2017|access-date=November 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pasco Sheriff's Office confirmed that Halladay was the only occupant of the aircraft at the time of the crash and that [[air traffic control]]lers had not received any [[mayday]] distress signals from the plane before the crash.

The [[Pasco County, Florida]] Sheriff's Office Marine Unit responded to the accident after a call at noon, reporting a sport plane having crashed upside-down into shallow water. The plane was reported to be Halladay's, and he had [[Twitter|tweeted]] four weeks earlier about his excitement about acquiring the plane, which was reportedly registered in the name of Halladay's father, a retired commercial pilot.&lt;ref name=usa&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2017/11/07/roy-halladay-plane-crash/841101001/|title=Roy Halladay dies in plane crash|date=November 7, 2017| access-date= November 7, 2017|work=[[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former MLB pitcher Roy Halladay dies in plane crash|url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/260880432/roy-halladay-dies-in-plane-crash/?topicId=27118122| work= MLB.com| access-date= November 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Salt-cured meat''' or '''salted meat''' is meat or fish preserved or [[Curing (food preservation)|cured]] with salt. [[Salting (food)|Salting]], either with [[edible salt|dry salt]] or [[brine]], was a common method of preserving meat until the middle of the 20th century, becoming less popular after the advent of refrigeration. It was frequently called "junk"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoldfoodie.com/2009/10/original-junk-food.html |title=The original junk food |first=Janet |last=Clarkson|publisher=The Old Foodie |date=2009-10-12 |accessdate=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "salt horse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Salt inhibits the growth of [[microorganism]]s by drawing water out of microbial cells through [[osmosis]]. Concentrations of salt up to 20% are required to kill most species of unwanted [[bacterium|bacteria]]. [[Smoking (food)|Smoking]], often used in the process of curing meat, adds chemicals to the surface of meat that reduce the concentration of salt required.

Salted meat and fish are a staple of the diet in [[North Africa]], [[Southern China]],  [[Scandinavia]], coastal [[Russia]], and in the [[Arctic]]. Salted meat was a staple of the mariner's diet in the [[Age of Sail]]. It was stored in barrels, and often had to last for months spent out of sight of land. The basic [[Royal Navy]] diet consisted of salted beef, [[Salt pork|salted pork]], [[ship's biscuit]], and [[oatmeal]], supplemented with smaller quantities of peas, cheese and butter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hmsrichmond.org/diet.htm |title=Diet and Recipes |publisher=hmsrichmond.org |date=2004-09-02 |accessdate=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even in 1938, [[Eric Newby]] found the diet on the [[tall ship]] ''[[Moshulu]]'' to consist almost entirely of salted meat.  ''Moshulu's'' lack of refrigeration left little choice as the ship made voyages which could exceed 100 days passage between ports.

The '''soliton hypothesis''' in [[neuroscience]] is a [[biological neuron models|model]] that claims to explain how [[action potentials]] are initiated and conducted along [[axon]]s based on a thermodynamic theory of nerve pulse propagation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andersen|first1=S|last2=Jackson|first2=A|last3=Heimburg|first3=T|title=Towards a thermodynamic theory of nerve pulse propagation|journal=Progress in Neurobiology|date=2009|volume=88|pages=104–113|url=http://www.membranes.nbi.dk/pdf/2009_AndersenJacksonHeimburg_PNB.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.pneurobio.2009.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It proposes that the signals travel along the cell's [[cell membrane|membrane]] in the form of certain kinds of [[Solitary wave (water waves)|solitary]] [[sound]] (or [[density]]) pulses that can be modeled as [[soliton]]s.

The resulting decrease in membrane potential opens nearby voltage-gated sodium channels, thus propagating the action potential. The transmembrane potential is restored by delayed opening of potassium channels.

==History==

[[Ichiji Tasaki]] pioneered a thermodynamic approach to the phenomenon of nerve pulse propagation which identified several phenomena that were not included in the [[Hodgkin–Huxley model]].&lt;ref name=Tasaki&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tasaki|first1=Ichiji|title=Physiology and Electrochemistry of Nerve Fibers|date=1982|publisher=Academic Press Inc. (London)|location=Bethesda, Maryland|isbn=0-12-683780-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with measuring various non electrical components of a nerve impulse, Tasaki investigated the physical chemistry of [[phase transition]]s in nerve fibers and its importance for nerve pulse propagation. Based on Tasaki's work, Konrad Kaufman proposed sound waves as a physical basis for nerve pulse propagation in an unpublished manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaufmann|first1=Konrad|title=Action Potentials and Electrochemical Coupling in the Macroscopic Chiral Phospholipid Membrane|date=1989|location=Caruaru, Brazil|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/1VAr_GwfXY4kOlNSuvtvJAIsvRmfc1U8Txl4_iO3aL-XPAS7qqQJmooAu9t0F/edit?authkey=CIqrlMgK&amp;ddrp=1&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The basic idea at the core of the soliton model is the balancing of intrinsic dispersion of the two dimensional sound waves in the membrane by nonlinear elastic properties near a phase transition. The initial impulse can acquire a stable shape under such circumstances, in general known as a solitary wave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xin-Yi|first1=Wang|title=Solitary wave and nonequilibrium phase transition in liquid crystals|journal=Physical Review A|date=1985|volume=32|pages=3126–3129|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.32.3126|url=http://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.32.3126|bibcode=1985PhRvA..32.3126X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solitons are the simplest solution of the set of nonlinear wave equations governing such phenomenon and were applied to model nerve impulse in 2005 by Thomas Heimburg and Andrew D.

==Justification==
The model starts with the observation that cell membranes always have a [[melting point|freezing point]] (the temperature below which the consistency changes from fluid to gel-like) only slightly below the organism's body temperature, and this allows for the propagation of solitons. An action potential traveling along a mixed nerve results in a slight increase in temperature followed by a decrease in temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.1958.0012 |author=Abbott, B.C., Hill, A.V., Howarth, J.V. |title=The positive and negative heat associated with a nerve impulse |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |volume=148 |issue=931 |pages=149–187 |year=1958 |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/148/931/149.abstract?sid=55350fa9-13b9-4280-90f3-99a1fc01b2c5|bibcode = 1958RSPSB.148..149A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soliton model proponents claim that no net heat is released during the overall pulse and that the observed temperature changes are inconsistent with the Hodgkin-Huxley model. However, this is untrue: the Hodgkin Huxley model predicts a biphasic release and absorption of heat.&lt;ref name="Howarth Heat Review" /&gt; In addition, the AP causes a slight local thickening of the membrane and a force acting outwards;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Iwasa, K., Tasaki I., Gibbons, R. |title=Swelling of nerve fibres associated with action potentials |journal=Science |volume=210 |issue=4467 |pages=338–9 |year=1980 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci;210/4467/338?maxtoshow=&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;author1=Iwasa%2C+K&amp;andorexacttitle=or&amp;andorexacttitleabs=or&amp;andorexactfulltext=or&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;fdate=1/1/1980&amp;tdate=12/31/1980&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT,HWELTR |pmid=7423196 |doi=10.1126/science.7423196 |bibcode=1980Sci...210..338I}}&lt;/ref&gt; this effect is not predicted by the Hodgkin–Huxley model but does not contradict it, either.

The soliton model attempts to explain the electrical currents associated with the action potential as follows: the traveling soliton locally changes density and thickness of the membrane, and since the membrane contains many charged and [[chemical polarity|polar]] substances, this will result in an electrical effect, akin to [[piezoelectricity]]. Indeed, such nonlinear sound waves have now been shown to exist at lipid interfaces that show superficial similarity to action potentials (electro-opto-mechanical coupling, velocities, biphasic pulse shape, threshold for excitation etc.).&lt;ref name="shrivastava" /&gt; Furthermore, the waves remain localized in the membrane and do not spread out in the surrounding due to an impedance mismatch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Griesbauer|first1=J|last2=Wixforth|first2=A|last3=Schneider|first3=M F|title=Wave Propagation in Lipid Monolayers|journal=Biophysical Journal|date=15 Nov 2009|volume=97|issue=10|pages=2710–2716|doi=10.1016/j.bpj.2009.07.049|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0006349509013150/1-s2.0-S0006349509013150-main.pdf?_tid=af52937a-e9cf-11e4-8cfd-00000aab0f6b&amp;acdnat=1429804073_add2909d02a98a7343eb4804fe059cf0|pmid=19917224|pmc=2776282|bibcode=2009BpJ....97.2710G}}&lt;/ref&gt; However these mechanical waves differ in fundamental ways from the properties described by the [[Hodgkin-Huxley Model]] in that they do not exhibit the very specific ionic selectivity, voltage sensitivity, time-course, or sensitivity to toxins that are integral to the Hodgkin-Huxley model.

==Formalism==

The soliton representing the action potential of nerves is the solution of the [[partial differential equation]]

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial^2 \Delta \rho}{\partial t^2} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left[\left(c_0^2 + p\Delta \rho + q\Delta \rho^2\right)\frac{\partial \Delta \rho}{\partial x}\right] - h\frac{\partial^4 \Delta\rho}{\partial x^4}, &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''t''}} is time and {{math|''x''}} is the position along the nerve axon. {{math|Δ''ρ''}} is the change in membrane density under the influence of the action potential,  {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the sound velocity of the nerve membrane, {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}} describe the nature of the phase transition and thereby the nonlinearity of the elastic constants of the nerve membrane. The parameters {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}} are dictated by the thermodynamic properties of the nerve membrane and cannot be adjusted freely. They have to be determined experimentally. The parameter {{math|''h''}} describes the frequency dependence of the sound velocity of the membrane ([[dispersion relation]]). The above equation does not contain any fit parameters. It is formally related to the [[Boussinesq approximation (water waves)|Boussinesq approximation]] for solitons in water canals. The solutions of the above equation possess a limiting maximum amplitude and a minimum propagation velocity that is similar to the pulse velocity in myelinated nerves. Under restrictive assumptions, there exist periodic solutions that display hyperpolarization and refractory periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Villagran Vargas, E., Ludu, A., Hustert, R., Gumrich, P., Jackson, A.D., Heimburg, T. |title=Periodic solutions and refractory periods in the soliton theory for nerves and the locust femoral nerve |year=2010 |pmid=21177017 |doi=10.1016/j.bpc.2010.11.001 |volume=153 |issue=2–3 |pages=159–167 |journal=Biophysical Chemistry |arxiv=1006.3281 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of ion channels==
Advocates of the soliton model claim that it explains several aspects of the action potential, which are not explained by the Hodgkin–Huxley model. Since it is of thermodynamic nature it does not address the properties of single macromolecules like [[ion channel]] proteins on a molecular scale. It is rather assumed that their properties are implicitly contained in the macroscopic thermodynamic properties of the nerve membranes. The soliton model predicts membrane current fluctuations during the action potential. These currents are of similar appearance as those reported for ion channel proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bpc.2010.02.018 |author=Heimburg, T. |title=Lipid Ion Channels |journal=Biophys. Chem. |volume=150 |issue=1–3 |pages=2–22 |year=2010 |arxiv=1001.2524 |pmid=20385440}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are thought to be caused by lipid membrane pores spontaneously generated by the thermal fluctuations. Such thermal fluctuations cannot explain the specific ionic selectivity or the specific time-course of the response to voltage changes.

==Application to anesthesia==
The authors claim that their model explains the previously obscure mode of action of numerous [[anesthetic]]s. The [[Minimum alveolar concentration#Meyer-Overton hypothesis|Meyer–Overton observation]] holds that the strength of a wide variety of chemically diverse anesthetics is proportional to their [[lipid]] solubility, suggesting that they do not act by binding to specific [[protein]]s such as ion channels but instead by dissolving in and changing the properties of the lipid membrane. Dissolving substances in the membrane lowers the membrane's freezing point, and the resulting larger difference between body temperature and freezing point inhibits the propagation of solitons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Heimburg, T., Jackson, A.D. |title=The thermodynamics of general anesthesia |journal=Biophys. J. |volume=92 |issue=9 |pages=3159–65 |url=http://www.cell.com/biophysj/abstract/S0006-3495(07)71124-4 |year=2007 |pmid=17293400 |pmc=1852341 |doi=10.1529/biophysj.106.099754 |bibcode=2007BpJ....92.3159H|arxiv = physics/0610147 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By increasing pressure, lowering [[pH]] or lowering temperature, this difference can be restored back to normal, which should cancel the action of anesthetics: this is indeed observed. The amount of pressure needed to cancel the action of an anesthetic of a given lipid solubility can be computed from the soliton model and agrees reasonably well with experimental observations.

==Differences between model predictions and experimental observations==
[[File:BBM equation - overtaking solitary waves animation.gif|thumb|208px|Collision of solitons]]
The following is a list of some of the disagreements between experimental observations and the "Soliton model":

;Antidromic invasion of soma from axon: An action potential initiated anywhere on an axon will travel in an antidromic (backward) direction to the neuron soma (cell body) without loss of amplitude and produce a full-amplitude action potential in the soma. As the membrane area of the soma is orders of magnitude larger than the area of the axon, conservation of energy requires that an adiabatic mechanical wave decrease in amplitude. Since the absence of heat production is one of the claimed justifications of the 'soliton model', this is particularly difficult to explain within that model.&lt;ref&gt;Rall, W and Shepherd, GM (1968) Theoretical reconstructions of dendrodendritic synaptic interactions in the olfactory bulb. ''J Neurophysiol'' 31, 884-915.http://jn.physiology.org/content/jn/31/6/884.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

;Persistence of action potential over wide temperature range: An important assumption of the soliton model is the presence of a phase transition near the ambient temperature of the axon ("Formalism", above). Then, rapid change of temperature away from the phase transition temperature would necessarily cause large changes in the action potential. Below the phase transition temperature, the soliton wave would not be possible. Yet, action potentials are present at 0&amp;nbsp;°C. The time course is slowed in a manner predicted by the measured opening and closing kinetics of the Hodgkin-Huxley ion channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hodgkin | first1 =  | last2 = Katz | first2 =  | year = 1949 | title = The Effect of Temperature on the Electrical Activity of the Giant Axon of the Squid | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1392577/pdf/jphysiol01472-0254.pdf | format = PDF | journal = J.

;Collisions:  Nerve impulses traveling in opposite directions annihilate each other on collision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tasaki|first1=Ichiji|title=Collision of two nerve impulses in the nerve fiber.|journal=Biochim Biophys Acta|date=1949|volume=3|pages=494–497|doi=10.1016/0006-3002(49)90121-3|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0006300249901213}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, mechanical waves do not annihilate but pass through each other.

;Ionic currents under voltage clamp: The voltage clamp, used by Hodgkin and Huxley (1952) ([[Hodgkin-Huxley Model]]) to experimentally dissect the action potential in the squid giant axon, uses electronic feedback to measure the current necessary to hold membrane voltage constant at a commanded value. A silver wire, inserted into the interior of the  axon, forces a constant membrane voltage along the length of the axon. Under these circumstances, there is no possibility of a traveling 'soliton'. Any thermodynamic changes are very different from those resulting from an action potential. Yet, the measured currents accurately reproduce the action potential. (citation needed)

;Single channel currents: The patch clamp technique isolates a microscopic patch of membrane on the tip of a glass pipette. It is then possible to record currents from single ionic channels. There is no possibility of propagating solitons or thermodynamic changes. Yet, the properties of these channels (temporal response to voltage jumps, ionic selectivity) accurately predict the properties of the macroscopic currents measured under conventional voltage clamp.&lt;ref name="Hille, Bertil 2001"&gt;Hille, Bertil (2001). Ion channels of excitable membranes (3. ed. ed.). Sunderland, Massachusetts: Sinauer. {{ISBN|9780878933211}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (citation needed)

;Selective ionic conductivity: The current underlying the action potential depolarization is selective for sodium. Repolarization depends on a selective potassium current. These currents have very specific responses to voltage changes which quantitatively explain the action potential. Substitution of non-permeant ions for sodium abolishes the action potential. The 'soliton model' cannot explain either the ionic selectivity or the responses to voltage changes. ( [[Hodgkin-Huxley Model]] )(citation needed)

;Pharmacology: The drug tetrodotoxin (TTX) blocks action potentials at extremely low concentrations. The site of action of TTX on the sodium channel has been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Catterall | first1 = WA | year = 2014 | title = Structure and function of voltage-gated sodium channels at atomic resolution | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/expphysiol.2013.071969/full | journal = Experimental Physiology | volume = 99 | issue = | pages = 35–51 | doi=10.1113/expphysiol.2013.071969| pmc = 3885250 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dendrotoxins block the potassium channels. These drugs produce quantitatively predictable changes in the action potential.&lt;ref name="Hille, Bertil 2001"/&gt; The 'soliton model' provides no explanation for these pharmacological effects.

==Action waves==

A recent theoretical model, proposed by Ahmed El Hady and Benjamin Machta, proposes that there is a mechanical surface wave which co-propagates with the electrical action potential. These surface waves are called "action waves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ncomms7697 |author=El Hady, A., Machta, B.|title=Mechanical surface waves accompany action potential propagation |journal=[[Nature Communications]] |volume=6 |year=2015 |url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150330/ncomms7697/full/ncomms7697.html |pages=6697|arxiv=1407.7600 |bibcode=2015NatCo...6E6697E }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the  El Hady–Machta's model, these co-propagating waves are driven by voltage changes across the membrane caused by the action potential.

*[[Umbilical cord#Problems and abnormalities|umbilical cord accident]]s
**''Prolapsed umbilical cord'' – Prolapse of the umbilical cord happens when the fetus is not in a correct position in the pelvis. Membranes rupture and the cord is pushed out through the cervix. When the fetus pushes on the cervix, the cord is compressed and blocks blood and oxygen flow to the fetus. The mother has approximately 10 minutes to get to a doctor before there is any harm done to the fetus.
**''Monoamniotic twins'' – These twins share the same placenta and the same amniotic sac and therefore can interfere with each other's umbilical cords. When entanglement of the cords is detected, it is highly recommended to deliver the fetuses as early as 31 weeks.
**''Umbilical cord length'' - A short umbilical cord (&lt;30&amp;nbsp;cm) can affect the fetus in that fetal movements can cause cord compression, constriction and ruptures. A long umbilical cord (&gt;72&amp;nbsp;cm) can affect the fetus depending on the way the fetus interacts with the cord. Some fetuses grasp the umbilical cord but it is yet unknown as to whether a fetus is strong enough to compress and stop blood flow through the cord. Also, an active fetus, one that frequently repositions itself in the uterus can cause entanglement with the cord. A hyperactive fetus should be evaluated with ultrasound to rule out cord entanglement.
**''Cord entanglement'' - The umbilical cord can wrap around an extremity, the body or the neck of the fetus. When the cord is wrapped around the neck of the fetus, it is called a nuchal cord. These entanglements can cause constriction of blood flow to the fetus. These entanglements can be visualized with ultrasound.
**''Torsion'' – This term refers to the twisting of the umbilical around itself. Torsion of the umbilical cord is very common (especially in equine stillbirths) but it is not a natural state of the umbilical cord. The umbilical cord can be untwisted at delivery. The average cord has 3 twists.

A mother sleeping on [[Supine position|her back]] after 28 weeks of pregnancy may be a risk factor for stillbirth.&lt;ref name=War2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warland|first1=J|last2=Mitchell|first2=EA|last3=O'Brien|first3=LM|title=Novel strategies to prevent stillbirth.|journal=Seminars in fetal &amp; neonatal medicine|date=June 2017|volume=22|issue=3|pages=146-152|doi=10.1016/j.siny.2017.01.005|pmid=28162972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a stillbirth there is a 2.5% risk of another stillbirth in the next pregnancy (an increase from 0.4%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lamont|first1=K|last2=Scott|first2=NW|last3=Jones|first3=GT|last4=Bhattacharya|first4=S|title=Risk of recurrent stillbirth: systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=24 June 2015|volume=350|pages=h3080|pmid=26109551|doi=10.1136/bmj.h3080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
It is unknown how much time is needed for a fetus to die. Fetal behavior is consistent and a change in the fetus' movements or sleep-wake cycles can indicate fetal distress. A decrease or cessation in sensations of [[fetal activity]] may be an indication of [[fetal distress]] or death, though it is not entirely uncommon for a healthy fetus to exhibit such changes, particularly near the end of a [[pregnancy]] when there is considerably less space in the [[uterus]] than earlier in pregnancy for the fetus to move about. Still, [[medical examination]], including a [[nonstress test]], is recommended in the event of any type of any change in the strength or [[frequency]] of fetal movement, especially a complete cease; most [[midwife|midwives]] and [[obstetrician]]s recommend the use of a [[kick chart]] to assist in detecting any changes. Fetal distress or death can be confirmed or ruled out via [[fetoscopy]]/[[doptone]], [[obstetric ultrasonography|ultrasound]], and/or [[electronic fetal monitoring]]. If the fetus is alive but inactive, extra attention will be given to the [[placenta]] and [[umbilical cord]] during ultrasound examination to ensure that there is no compromise of oxygen and nutrient delivery.

Some researchers have tried to develop [[Predictive modelling|models]] to identify early on pregnant women who may be at high risk of having a stillbirth.&lt;ref name="KayodeGrobbee2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kayode|first1=Gbenga A.|last2=Grobbee|first2=Diederick E.|last3=Amoakoh-Coleman|first3=Mary|last4=Adeleke|first4=Ibrahim Taiwo|last5=Ansah|first5=Evelyn|last6=de Groot|first6=Joris A.

===Definition===
There are a number of definitions for stillbirth. To allow comparison, the [[World Health Organization]] recommends that any baby born without [[Vital signs|signs of life]] at greater than or equal to 28 completed weeks' gestation be classified as a stillbirth.&lt;ref name=WHO2016/&gt; Others use greater than any combination of 16, 20, 22, 24, or 28 weeks gestational age or 350 g, 400 g, 500 g, or 1000 g birth weight may be considered stillborn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Nguyen RH, Wilcox AJ |title=Terms in reproductive and perinatal epidemiology: 2. Perinatal terms|journal=J Epidemiol Community Health|volume=59|issue=12|pages=1019–21|date=December 2005|pmid=16286486|pmc=1732966|doi=10.1136/jech.2004.023465 |quote=There is probably no health outcome with a greater number of conflicting, authoritative, legally mandated definitions. The basic WHO definition of fetal death is the intrauterine death of any conceptus at any time during pregnancy. However, for practical purposes, legal definitions usually require recorded fetal deaths to attain some gestational age (16, 20, 22, 24, or 28 weeks) or birth weight (350, 400, 500, or 1000 g). In the US states, there are eight different definitions by combinations of gestational age and weight, and at least as many in Europe.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is often used in distinction to [[Live birth (human)|live birth]] (the baby was born alive, even if it died shortly thereafter) or [[miscarriage]] (early pregnancy loss). The word miscarriage is often used incorrectly to describe stillbirths. The term is mostly used in a human context, however the same phenomenon can occur in all species of [[placental mammal]]s.

===Constricted umbilical cord===
When the umbilical cord is constricted (q.v. "accidents" above), the fetus experiences periods of [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], and may respond by unusually high periods of kicking or struggling, to free the umbilical cord.  These are sporadic if constriction is due to a change in the fetus' or mother's position, and may become worse or more frequent as the fetus grows. Extra attention should be given if mothers experience large increases in kicking from previous childbirths, especially when increases correspond to position changes.

Regulating [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] and drug use may reduce the risk of a stillbirth.  Umbilical cord constriction may be identified and observed by [[ultrasound]], if requested.

Some maternal factors are associated with stillbirth, including being age 35 or older, having diabetes, having a history of addiction to illegal drugs, being overweight or obese, and smoking cigarettes in the three months before getting pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-500368_162-57342588/studies-identify-stillbirth-risk-factors-causes/ | work=CBS News | title=Studies identify stillbirth risk factors, causes | date=December 14, 2011 | author=WebMD | accessdate=2013-08-06 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524214319/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-500368_162-57342588/studies-identify-stillbirth-risk-factors-causes/ | archivedate=May 24, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Fetal death ''[[in utero]]'' does not present an immediate health risk to the woman, and labour will usually begin [[Spontaneous abortion|spontaneously]] after two weeks, so the woman may choose to wait and bear the fetal remains [[Childbirth#Second stage|vaginally]]. After two weeks, the woman is at risk of developing blood [[clot]]ting problems, and [[labor induction]] is recommended at this point. In many cases, the woman will find the idea of carrying the dead fetus [[psychological trauma|traumatizing]] and will elect to have labor induced. [[Caesarean]] birth is not recommended unless complications develop during [[Childbirth#Second stage|vaginal birth]]. How the diagnosis of stillbirth is communicated by healthcare workers may have a long-lasting and deep impact on parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://imj.ie/communication-skills-in-obstetrics-what-can-we-learn-from-bereaved-parents/|title=Communication skills in Obstetrics: what can we learn from bereaved parents? {{!}} IMJ|website=imj.ie|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-01|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301191206/http://imj.ie/communication-skills-in-obstetrics-what-can-we-learn-from-bereaved-parents/|archivedate=2017-03-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women need to heal physically after a stillbirth just as they do emotionally.

In Australia any stillborn weighing more than 400&amp;nbsp;grams, or more than 20 weeks in gestation, must have its birth registered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lahra MM, Gordon A, Jeffery HE |title=Chorioamnionitis and fetal response in stillbirth |journal=Am.

====Austria====
In Austria a stillbirth is defined as birth of a child of at least 500 g weight without [[vital signs]], e.g. blood circulation, breath or muscle movements.

====Canada====
Beginning in 1959, "the definition of a stillbirth was revised to conform, in substance, to the definition of fetal death recommended by the [[World Health Organization]]."&lt;ref&gt;Statistics Canada ("Canada's National Statistical Agency"), [https://web.archive.org/web/20040801004236/http://www.statcan.ca/english/sdds/document/3234_D2_T9_V1_E.pdf History, Vital Statistics - Stillbirth Database], in [http://www.statcan.ca/cgi-bin/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&amp;SDDS=3234&amp;lang=en&amp;db=IMDB&amp;dbg=f&amp;adm=8&amp;dis=2 Vital Statistics – Stillbirth Database] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505203025/http://www.statcan.ca/cgi-bin/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&amp;SDDS=3234&amp;lang=en&amp;db=IMDB&amp;dbg=f&amp;adm=8&amp;dis=2 |date=May 5, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of "fetal death" promulgated by the [[World Health Organization]] in 1950 is as follows:
:''"Fetal death" means death prior to the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of human conception, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy and which is not an induced termination of pregnancy. The death is indicated by the fact that after such expulsion or extraction, the fetus does not breathe or show any other evidence of life, such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles. Heartbeats are to be distinguished from transient cardiac contractions; respirations are to be distinguished from fleeting respiratory efforts or gasps.''&lt;ref name="CDC-def"/&gt;

====Germany====
[[File:Gedenkstaette Totgeborene Kinder Neu-Bottenbroich.jpg|thumb|Monument to stillborn babies in Germany]]
In Germany a stillbirth is defined as birth of a child of at least 500 g weight without blood circulation or breath. Details for burial vary amongst the federal states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.initiative-regenbogen.de/gesetze.htm |title=Gesetze |publisher=Initiative-regenbogen.de |date= |accessdate=2013-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130713083603/http://www.initiative-regenbogen.de/gesetze.htm |archivedate=2013-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Republic of Ireland====
[[File:Glasnevin is one of the few cemeteries that allowed stillborn babies to be buried in consecrated ground and contains an area called the Angels Plot. (6905938656).jpg|thumb|At one time, this Angels' Plot was one of the few burial grounds for stillborn babies that was consecrated by the Catholic Church in Ireland.]]
Since 1 Jan 1995 stillbirths occurring in the Republic of Ireland must be registered; stillbirths which occurred before that date can also be registered but evidence is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/birth-family-relationships/miscarriage-and-stillbirth/registering_stillbirth|title=Registering a stillbirth|work=citizensinformation.ie|accessdate=15 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207053354/http://citizensinformation.ie/categories/birth-family-relationships/miscarriage-and-stillbirth/registering_stillbirth|archivedate=7 February 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the purposes of civil registration, s.1 of the Stillbirths Registration Act 1994 refers to :-

''"...a child weighing at least 500&amp;nbsp;grammes, or having reached a gestational age of at least 24 weeks who shows no signs of life."''

====The Netherlands====
In the Netherlands, stillbirth is defined differently by the central bureau of statistics (CBS) and the Dutch perinatal registry (Stichting PRN). The birth and mortality numbers from the CBS include all liveborn children, regardless of gestational duration and all stillbirths from 24 weeks of gestation and onwards. In the Perinatal Registry, gestational duration of both liveborn and stillborn children is available. They register all liveborn and stillborn children from 22, 24 or 28 weeks of gestation and onwards (dependent on the report: fetal, neonatal or perinatal mortality). Therefore, data from these institutions on (still)births can not simply be compared one-on-one.

====United Kingdom====
The registration of still-births has been required in England and Wales from 1927, in Scotland from 1939 but is not required in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/births-and-registration/registering-a-still-birth.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327200619/http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/births-and-registration/registering-a-still-birth.htm |archivedate=2012-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes a pregnancy is terminated deliberately during a late phase, for example for congenital anomaly. UK law requires these procedures to be registered as "stillbirths".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bythell M ''et al.'' | year = 2008 | title = The contribution of late termination of pregnancy to stillbirth rates in Northern England, 1994-2005 | url = | journal = The British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology | volume = 115 | issue = 5| pages = 664–666 | doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.2008.01668.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====England and Wales====
For the purposes of the [[Births and Deaths Registration Act 1926]] (as amended), section 12 contains the definition that :-

''"still-born" and "still-birth" shall apply to any child which has issued forth from its mother after the twenty fourth week of pregnancy and which did not at any time after being completely expelled from its mother, breathe or show any other signs of life.''

A similar definition is applied within the [[Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953]] (as amended), contained in s.41.

The above definitions apply within those Acts thus other legislation will not necessarily be in identical terms.

s.2 of the 1953 Act requires that registration of a birth takes place within 42 days of the birth except where an inquest takes place or the child has been "found exposed" in which latter case the time limit runs from the time of finding.

Extracts from the register of still-births are restricted to those who have obtained consent from the [[Registrar General for England and Wales]].

====Scotland====
Section 56(1) of the [[Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages (Scotland) Act 1965]] (as amended) contains the definition that :-

''"still-born child" means a child which has issued forth from its mother after the twenty-fourth week of pregnancy and which did not at any time after being completely expelled from its mother breathe or show any other signs of life, and the expression "still-birth" shall be construed accordingly''

s.21(1) of the same Act requires that :-

''Except so far as otherwise provided by this section or as may be prescribed, the provisions of this Part of this Act shall, so far as applicable, apply to still-births in like manner as they apply to births of children born alive.''

In the general case, s.14 of the Act requires that a birth has to be registered within 21 days of the birth or of the child being found.

Unlike the registers for births, marriages, civil partnerships and deaths, the register of still-births is not open to public access and issue of extracts requires the permission of the [[Registrar General for Scotland]].

====Northern Ireland====
In Northern Ireland the [[Births and Deaths Registration (Northern Ireland) Order 1976]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/1976/1041 |title=Births and Deaths Registration (Northern Ireland) Order 1976 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523140543/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/1976/1041 |archivedate=2013-05-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as amended contains the definition :-

'' "still-birth" means the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother after the twenty-fourth week of pregnancy of a child which did not at any time after being completely expelled or extracted breathe or show any other evidence of life.''

Registration of still-births can be made by a relative or certain other persons involved with the still-birth but it is not compulsory to do so. Registration takes place with the District Registrar for the Registration District where the still-birth occurred or for the District in which the mother is resident. A still-birth certificate will be issued to the registrant with further copies only available to those obtaining official consent for their issue. Registration may be made within three months of the still-birth&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/births-and-registration/registering-a-still-birth.htm NI Direct - Registering a Still-birth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327200619/http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/births-and-registration/registering-a-still-birth.htm |date=2012-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
In the United States, there is no standard definition of the term 'stillbirth'.&lt;!--
  --&gt;&lt;ref name="CDC-def"&gt;{{cite book | author =Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | authorlink =Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | title =State Definitions and Reporting Requirements | edition =1997 Revision | publisher =National Center for Health Statistics | url =https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/misc/itop97.pdf | format =PDF | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20170829171429/https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/misc/itop97.pdf | archivedate =2017-08-29 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the [[Born-Alive Infants Protection Act]] of 2002 specifies that any breathing, heartbeat, pulsating umbilical cord, or confirmed voluntary muscle movement indicate live birth rather than stillbirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=107_cong_reports&amp;docid=f:hr186.107|title=House Report 107-186 - BORN-ALIVE INFANTS PROTECTION ACT OF 2001|work=gpo.gov|accessdate=15 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016205334/http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=107_cong_reports|archivedate=16 October 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] collects statistical information on "live births, fetal deaths, and induced termination of pregnancy" from 57 reporting areas in the United States. Each reporting area has different guidelines and definitions for what is being reported; many do not use the term "stillbirth" at all. The federal guidelines suggest (at page 1) that fetal death and stillbirth can be interchangeable terms. The CDC definition of "fetal death" is based on the definition promulgated by the World Health Organization in 1950 (see [[Stillbirth#Canada|section above on Canada]]). Researchers are learning more about the long term psychiatric sequelae of traumatic birth and believe the effects may be intergenerational&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cacciatore J | year = 2010 | title = Unique stories of women and their families after the death of a baby | url = | journal = Journal of Healthcare Social Work | volume = 49 | issue = 2| pages = 134–148 | doi=10.1080/00981380903158078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal guidelines recommend reporting those fetal deaths whose birth weight is over 12.5 oz (350 g), or those more than 20 weeks gestation. Forty-one areas use a definition very similar to the federal definition, thirteen areas use a shortened definition of fetal death, and three areas have no formal definition of fetal death. Only 11 areas specifically use the term 'stillbirth', often synonymously with late fetal death, however they are split between whether stillbirths are "irrespective of the duration of pregnancy", or whether some age or weight constraint is applied. A movement in the U.S. has changed the way that stillbirths are documented through vital records. Previously, only the deaths were reported. However 27 states have enacted legislation that offers some variation of a birth certificate as an option for parents who choose to pay for one. Parents may not claim a tax exemption for stillborn infants, even if a birth certificate is offered. To claim an exemption, the birth must be certified as live, even if the infant only lives for a very brief period.

==Plot==
In February 1938, a voice representing [[Death (personification)|Death]] tells about how the young Liesel Meminger has piqued his interest. In one of the opening scenes, Liesel is traveling with her mother and younger brother on a train. On the way, her brother dies and is buried next to the tracks. Liesel steals her first book, titled ''The Grave Digger's Handbook'', when it falls out of the gravedigger's pocket. Liesel is then brought to her new home in Munich, where she meets her new foster parents Rosa Hubermann and Hans Hubermann. Rudy Steiner, a boy who lives next door, accompanies her on her first day of school. When the teacher asks Liesel to write her name on the chalkboard, she is only able to write three Xs, revealing to her classmates that she is unable to write. She is taunted by her schoolmates who chant "''dummkopf''" ("dunce") at her. One of the boys, Franz Deutscher, challenges her to read just one word to which Liesel responds by beating him up. She impresses Rudy, and they become fast friends. When Hans, her foster father, realizes that Liesel cannot read, he begins to teach her, using the book that she took from the graveside, and a giant chalkboard. Liesel becomes captivated with reading anything she can.

Liesel and Rudy become members of the [[Hitler Youth|Hitler Youth movement]]. While at a [[Nazi book burnings|Nazi book burning]] ceremony, Liesel and Rudy are harassed into throwing books onto the bonfire by Franz, but Liesel is upset to see the books being burned. When the bonfire ends and everyone leaves, Liesel is still there and she grabs a book that has been only singed. She is seen by Ilsa Hermann, wife of the [[burgermeister]] (mayor). When Rosa asks Liesel to take the laundry to the mayor's spacious, gated house, she realizes that the woman who saw her taking the book is the mayor's wife. Instead, Ilsa takes her into their library and tells Liesel she can come by anytime and read as much as she'd like. One day Liesel is found reading by the mayor who not only puts a stop to her visits but dismisses Rosa as their laundress.

During [[Kristallnacht]], Max Vandenburg and his mother, who are Jewish, are told by a friend that only one of them can escape, and Max's mother forces him to go. Max's father had saved Hans' life in World War I, and hence he goes to the Hubermanns' house where Rosa and Hans give him shelter. Max initially stays in Liesel's room while recovering from his trip, and they begin to become friends over their mutual hatred of Hitler. World War II begins, initially making most of the children in Liesel's neighborhood very happy. Max is moved to the basement so that he can move around more, but it is cold and Max becomes dangerously ill. Liesel helps Max recover by reading to him books "borrowed" from the mayor's library with every spare moment.

One day while "borrowing" a book from the mayor's home, Liesel is followed by Rudy. He discovers the secret of Max, whose name he reads on a journal Max gave to Liesel for Christmas. Rudy guesses that her family is hiding someone, and he swears to never tell anyone. Franz overhears Rudy's last words of keeping it a secret and violently pushes Rudy to reveal the secret. Rudy throws the journal into the river to keep it away from Franz. After Franz leaves, Rudy plunges into the icy river to rescue the journal, and Liesel realizes that she can truly trust him. Soon, a local party member comes by to check the Hubermanns' basement, and they have to hide Max.

While working, Hans sees a neighbor and friend named Lehman being taken away by the police because he is a Jew. Hans tries to intervene, telling the officer that Lehman is a good man, but Hans's name is taken by the soldiers and he is thrown to the ground. Hans realizes what a mistake he has made, since this has made his family visible. He tells the family, and Max realises he must leave in order to protect them. Hans then receives a telegram that he has been conscripted into the army and must leave immediately.

On the way home from school, Liesel believes she has seen Max in a line of Jews being forcibly marched through town, and she begins screaming his name, running through the line. She is thrown to the sidewalk twice by German soldiers and finally gives up when Rosa picks her up and takes her home.

Hans returns home after being injured, and the family is reunited only for a short time. One night the city is bombed by accident, and the air raid sirens fail to go off. Hans, Rosa, and Rudy's family are killed in the blast. Liesel was spared from the bombing because she fell asleep in the basement while writing in the journal given to her by Max. She sees her foster family on the ground, dead, she cries and hugs them.  Neighbors bring Rudy out of his house, barely alive. He begins to tell Liesel that he loves her, but he dies before he can finish the sentence. During this scene, Death is heard speaking again about how he received the souls of the dead. Liesel passes out, and one of the soldiers carries her to a stretcher. When she wakes up, she sees a book among the rubble and picks it up. She then sees the mayor and Ilsa drive up. With Ilsa being the only friend she has left, Liesel runs up to her and hugs her.

Two years later, after Germany has fallen to the Allies, Liesel is working in the tailor shop owned by Rudy's father. Max enters. Overjoyed by his survival and return, she runs to hug him. The final scene is Death speaking again about Liesel's life and her death at the age of 90, mentioning her husband, children, and grandchildren, as we look over her modern day Manhattan Upper East Side apartment with pictures of her past and a portrait of her, upon which the camera lingers. The narrator does not state whom she married but implies that she became a writer.

==Production==
A search for an actress to play the eponymous book thief, Liesel Meminger, occurred across the world. On February 4, 2013, it was announced that Canadian actress [[Sophie Nélisse]] was cast in the role and that Australian actor [[Geoffrey Rush]] and English actress [[Emily Watson]] would be playing Meminger's foster parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kit |first=Borys |title=Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson to Star in 'The Book Thief' Movie (Exclusive) |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/book-thief-movie-geoffrey-rush-418001 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=August 6, 2013 |date=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Principal photography began in early March 2013 at [[Babelsberg Studio]] in [[Potsdam]]-[[Babelsberg]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Roxborough |first=Scott |title='The Book Thief' Begins Shooting in Germany |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/book-thief-begins-shooting-germany-427216 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=August 6, 2013 |date=March 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first trailer was released on August 21,&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|92EBSmxinus}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Bastille (band)|Bastille]] song "Haunt" as the music.

[[Markus Zusak]], Australian author of [[The Book Thief|the best-selling, award-winning book on which the film is based]], confirmed on his blog that the film would be narrated by the character of "Death", as was the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zusakbooks.tumblr.com/post/58924637693/first-book-thief-trailer-the-girl-the-books|title=FIRST BOOK THIEF TRAILER: the Girl, the books &amp;... - THE CITY AT OUR FEET...|work=THE CITY AT OUR FEET...}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some speculation that Death might be voiced by the anonymous American actor who was used in the official trailer, it was announced that English actor [[Roger Allam]] of ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' would portray Death in the film.

==Soundtrack==
The music for the film was composed by [[John Williams]], and the soundtrack album containing the score was released by [[Sony Classical]]. The album was released in the United States on November 19, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2013/10/19/the-book-thief-soundtrack-details/|title=‘The Book Thief’ Soundtrack Details -  Film Music Reporter|work=filmmusicreporter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was nominated for an Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe for Best Original Score. It won Best Instrumental Album at the 57th Grammy Awards.

''The Book Thief'' marked the first time since 2005 that Williams had scored a film not directed by [[Steven Spielberg]].

==Release==
Originally scheduled for January 17, 2014, ''The Book Thief''{{-'}}s limited theatrical release was moved forward to November 8, 2013, due to the fact that it was finished ahead of schedule and in order to compete in the 2013–14 award season. It premiered at the [[Mill Valley Film Festival]] on October 3, 2013, and was screened at the Savannah Film Festival on October 29, 2013. It expanded to a wide release on November 27, 2013.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
''The Book Thief'' received mixed reviews from critics. Review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 46%, based on 134 reviews, with an average score of 5.6/10. The site's consensus states, "A bit too safe in its handling of its Nazi Germany setting, ''The Book Thief'' counters its constraints with a respectful tone and strong performances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_book_thief/|title=The Book Thief|date=November 8, 2013|work=rottentomatoes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 53 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-book-thief/|title=The Book Thief|work=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her review for the ''New Empress Magazine'', Mairéad Roche praised the film for providing a "fresher perspective on the war" through the experiences of ordinary Germans who lived through the Nazi era.&lt;ref name="nem"&gt;{{cite web|last=Roche |first=Mairéad |title=In Review: The Book Thief |work=New Empress Magazine |date=February 28, 2014 |url=http://newempressmagazine.com/2014/02/in-review-the-book-thief/ |accessdate=March 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the "Oscar-baiting beautiful" cinematography and John Williams's film score that contribute to the film's emotional appeal, Roche singled out the performance of young Sophie Nélisse as Liesel that "matches the well-measured and seemingly effortless efforts of both Rush and Watson".&lt;ref name="nem"/&gt; Roche concluded,
{{quote|''The Book Thief'' weaves a consistent thread of humanity through its narrative via the commonality of Death, storytelling and the concept of free will. The disturbing sight of children in Hitler Youth uniforms and Allied blanket bombing, when shown through the innocence of a child, humanises the German generation just living their lives without the hindsight of history. A blurring of vision due to tears is to be expected, but that effect is delivered with respect and dignity to the audience.&lt;ref name="nem"/&gt;}}

In his review following the [[Mill Valley Film Festival]], Dennis Harvey at ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine wrote, "Rush generously provides the movie's primary warmth and humor; Watson is pitch-perfect as a seemingly humorless scold with a well-buried soft side."&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt; Harvey also praised the film's cinematography and film score, noting that "impeccable design contributions are highlighted by Florian Ballhaus'[s] somber but handsome widescreen lensing and an excellent score by John Williams that reps his first feature work for a director other than Steven Spielberg in years."&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite web|last=Harvey|first=Dennis|title=Film Review: ‘The Book Thief’|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/reviews/the-book-thief-review-1200694271|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=February 23, 2014|date=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her review for "MSN UK", Emma Roberts gave the film 5 out of 5 stars, stating,
{{quote|With incredible acting, a gripping story and fantastic direction, ''The Book Thief'' is a heart-warming yet chilling tale, which will nestle in your mind long after the credits finish rolling.}}

Stephanie Merry of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' was less impressed with the film, giving it two and half out of four stars. Merry felt that the film "has its moments of brilliance, thanks in large part to an adept cast" but that the film ultimately shows the difficulties of bringing a successful novel to the screen.&lt;ref name="wapo"&gt;{{cite web|last=Merry|first=Stephanie|title=‘Book Thief’ movie review|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/book-thief-movie-review/2013/11/13/ea0f896a-47db-11e3-a196-3544a03c2351_story.html|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=February 23, 2014|date=November 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Robert Abele was also unimpressed, describing the film as "just another tasteful, staid Hollywoodization of terribleness, in which a catastrophic time acts as a convenient backdrop for a wishful narrative rather than the springboard for an honest one".&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Abele|first=Robert|title=Review: 'The Book Thief' robs the truth from an evil time|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/nov/08/entertainment/la-et-mn-the-book-thief-review-20131108|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=February 23, 2014|date=November 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Lionsoftsavo2008.jpg|thumb|right|275px|The Tsavo Man-Eaters on display in the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], the [[United States of America]]]]
The '''Tsavo Man-Eaters''' were a pair of [[man-eater|man-eating]] [[East African lion|lion]]s in the [[Tsavo]] region, which were responsible for the deaths of a number of [[construction worker]]s on the [[Kenya-Uganda Railway]] between March and December 1898. The significance of this lion pair was their unusual behavior of killing men and the manner of their attacks.

==History==

}}
As part of the construction of a railway linking [[Uganda]] with the [[Indian Ocean]] at [[Kilindini Harbour]], in March 1898 the British started building a railway bridge over the [[Tsavo River]] in [[Kenya]]. The project was led by Lieutenant-Colonel [[John Henry Patterson (author)|John Henry Patterson]]. During the next nine months of construction, two [[Mane (lion)|maneless]] male Tsavo lions stalked the campsite, dragging [[India]]n workers from their tents at night and devouring them. Crews tried to scare off the lions and built campfires and ''[[Boma (enclosure)|bomas]]'', or thorn fences made of [[Acacia drepanolobium|whistling thorn]] trees around their camp for protection to keep the man-eaters out, all to no avail; the lions leaped over or crawled through the thorn fences. After repeated attacks, hundreds of workers fled from Tsavo, halting construction on the bridge. Patterson set traps and tried several times to ambush the lions at night from a tree. After repeated unsuccessful attempts, he shot the first lion on 9 December 1898. Twenty days later, the second lion was found and killed. The first lion killed measured {{convert|9|ft|8|in|m|abbr=on}} from nose to tip of tail. It took eight men to carry the carcass back to camp. 

Patterson wrote in his account that he wounded the first lion with one bullet from a high-calibre rifle. This shot struck the lion in its back leg, but it escaped. Later, it returned at night and began stalking Patterson as he tried to hunt it. He shot it through the shoulder, penetrating its heart with a more powerful rifle and found it lying dead the next morning not far from his platform. 

The second lion was shot up to nine times, five with the same rifle, three with a second, and once with a third rifle.&lt;ref name=Patterson2&gt;chapter IX The Death of the Second Man-Eater, ''The Man-Eaters of Tsavo and other East African Adventures'' by Lieut.-Col. J. H. Patterson, DSO publication date unknown as recorded on Amazon Kindle{{page needed|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first shot was fired from atop a scaffolding that Patterson had built near a goat killed by the lion. Two shots from a second rifle hit the lion 11 days later as it was stalking Patterson and trying to flee. When they found the lion the next day, Patterson shot it three more times with the same rifle, severely crippling it, and he shot it three times with a third rifle, twice in the chest, and once in the head, which killed it. He claimed it died gnawing on a fallen tree branch, still trying to reach him.&lt;ref name=Patterson2/&gt;

The construction crew returned and finished the bridge in February 1899. The exact number of people killed by the lions is unclear. Patterson gave several figures, overall claiming that there were 135 victims.&lt;ref name=Patterson&gt;{{cite book | author = Patterson, Bruce D. | year = 2004 | title = The Lions of Tsavo: Exploring the Legacy of Africa's Notorious Man-Eaters  | publisher = McGraw-Hill | isbn = 0-07-136333-5}}{{page needed|accessdate=23 September 2013|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Borzo&gt;{{cite press release |title=Field Museum uncovers evidence behind man-eating; revises legend of its infamous man-eating lions |url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-01/fm-fmu011303.php |publisher=The FIeld Museum |date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 25 years as Patterson's floor rugs, the lions' skins were sold to the [[Chicago Field Museum]] in 1924 for a sum of $5,000. The skins arrived at the museum in very poor condition. The lions were reconstructed and are now on permanent display along with their skulls.

==Modern research==
[[File:Man Eaters of Tsavo Skulls.JPG|thumb|The skulls of the Tsavo Man-Eaters, located in the diorama]]
In 2001, a review about causes for man-eating behaviour among lions revealed that the proposed human toll of 100 or more was most likely an exaggeration and that the more likely total was 28–31 victims. This reduced total was based on their review of Colonel Patterson's original journal, courtesy of Alan Patterson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The science of ‘man-eating’ among lions Panthera leo with a reconstruction of the natural history of the ‘man-eaters of Tsavo’ |author=Kerbis Peterhans, J. C. &amp; Gnoske, T. P. |journal=Journal of East African Natural History |year=2001 |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=1-40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Caputo |first=P. |title=Ghosts of Tsavo |page=274 |isbn=0-7922-6362-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two lion specimens in Chicago's Field Museum are known as FMNH 23970, the 'crouching' mount, killed on 9 December 1898, and FMNH 23969, the 'standing' mount, killed on 29 December 1898. Recent studies on the [[isotopic signature]] analysis of [[Δ13C]] and [[Nitrogen-15]] in their bone [[collagen]] and hair [[keratin]] were published in 2009. Using realistic assumptions on the consumable tissue per victim, lion energetic needs, and their assimilation efficiencies, researchers compared the man-eaters' Δ13C signatures to various reference standards: Tsavo lions with normal (wildlife) diets, grazers and browsers from Tsavo East and Tsavo West, and the skeletal remains of [[Taita people]] from the early 20th century.  Interpolation of their estimates across the 9 months of recorded man-eating behavior suggested that FMNH 23969 ate the equivalent of 10.5 humans and that FMNH 23970 ate 24.2 humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0905309106 |title=Cooperation and individuality among man-eating lions |year=2009 |last1=Yeakel |first1=J. D. |last2=Patterson |first2=B. D. |last3=Fox-Dobbs |first3=K. |last4=Okumura |first4=M. M. |last5=Cerling |first5=T. E. |last6=Moore |first6=J. W. |last7=Koch |first7=P. L. |last8=Dominy |first8=N. J. |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=106 |issue=45 |pages=19040–3 |pmid=19884504 |pmc=2776458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific analysis does not differentiate between entire human corpses consumed, compared to parts of individual prey, since the attacks often raised alarm forcing the lions to slink back into the surrounding area. Many workers over the long construction period went missing, died in accidents, or simply left out of fear; so it is likely almost all of the builders, who stayed on, knew someone missing or supposedly eaten. It appears that Colonel Patterson may have exaggerated his claims as have subsequent investigators (e.g. "135 armed men", Neiburger and Patterson, 2000) though none of these modern studies have taken into account the people who were killed but not eaten by the animals.&lt;ref name=ChiTrib&gt;{{cite news |title= Scientists restate Tsavo lions' taste for human flesh |author= |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=2009 |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/chi-tsavo-lions-02-nov02,0,3222846.story | first=K. | last=Janssen}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diet of the victims would also affect their [[isotopic signature]]. A low meat diet would produce a signature more typical of herbivores in the victims, affecting the outcome of the test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1021/bk-1984-0258.ch014 |chapter=Models for Carbon Isotope Fractionation Between Diet and Bone |title=Stable Isotopes in Nutrition |series=ACS Symposium Series |year=1984 |last1=Krueger |first1=Harold W. |last2=Sullivan |first2=Charles H. |isbn=0-8412-0855-7 |volume=258 |page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; That fact is important to note since many of the workers at Tsavo were Hindus and may have had a vegetarian diet.  This research also excludes, but does not disprove, the claims that the lions were not eating the victims they killed but merely killing just to kill. Similar claims have been made of other wildlife predators.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Possible causes of "man-eating" behaviour==
Theories for the man-eating behaviour of lions have been reviewed by Peterhans and Gnoske, as well as [[Bruce D. Patterson]] (2004). Their discussions include the following: 
*An outbreak of [[rinderpest]] (cattle plague) in 1898 devastated the lions' usual prey, forcing them to find alternative food sources.
*The Tsavo lions may have been accustomed to finding dead humans at the Tsavo River crossing. Slave caravans to the center of the [[Arab slave trade]], [[Zanzibar]], routinely crossed the river there.
*"Ritual invitation", or abbreviated cremation of [[Hindu]] railroad workers, invited scavenging by the lions.

An alternative argument indicates that the first lion had a severely damaged tooth that would have compromised its ability to kill natural prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/a/fieldmuseum.org/bruce-pattersons-lab/Home |title=Field Museum |date= |accessdate=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory has been generally disregarded by the general public and Colonel Patterson, who killed the lions, personally disclaimed it, saying that he damaged that tooth with his rifle while the lion charged him one night, prompting it to flee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lionlamb.us/gandd.html|title=The Tsavo Man-Eaters|work=lionlamb.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies indicate the lions ate humans as a supplement to other food, not as a last resort. Eating humans was probably an alternative to hunting or scavenging caused by dental disease and/or a limited number of prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/04/man-eating-lions-teeth-kenya/|title=Why Man-Eating Lions Prey on People—New Evidence|date=2017-04-19|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DeSantis|first=Larisa R.

In a 2017 study carried out by the team of Dr. Bruce Patterson it has been found that one of the lions had an infection at the root of his canine tooth, which made it hard for the lion to hunt. Lions normally use their jaws to grab prey like zebras and wildebeests and suffocate them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-00948-5 | doi=10.1038/s41598-017-00948-5| pmid=28424462| pmc=5430416| title=Dietary behaviour of man-eating lions as revealed by dental microwear textures| journal=Scientific Reports| volume=7| issue=1| pages=904| year=2017| last1=Desantis| first1=Larisa R.

== World Cancer Day themes ==
In 2016, World Cancer Day started a three-year campaign under the tagline of 'We can. I can.', which explored the power of collective and individual actions to reduce the impact of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldcancerday.org/about/2016-2018-world-cancer-day-campaign|title=World Cancer Day 2016-2018 {{!}} WCD|website=www.worldcancerday.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 2016, the campaign themes included "Not Beyond Us" (2015) and "Debunk the Myths" (2014). 

2019 will be the start of a new campaign theme.
