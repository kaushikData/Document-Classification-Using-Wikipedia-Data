'''{{mp|2000 SG|344}}''' (also written '''2000 SG344''') is a small [[Aten asteroid]] discovered in 2000. It is estimated to have a diameter of 37 meters (twice that of the [[Chelyabinsk meteor]]) and a [[mass]] of [[1 E10 kg|7.1{{e|7}} kg]] (71,000 tonnes).&lt;ref name=nasa-risk-2000sg344/&gt;

Because of its very Earth-like orbit and because it would have been near the Earth in 1971 (coinciding with the [[Apollo program]]), there was speculation that {{mp|2000 SG|344}} might not be an asteroid but a man-made object such as an [[S-IVB]] booster stage from a [[Saturn V]] rocket&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Much Ado about 2000 SG344 |date=2000-11-07 |publisher=[[NASA]] |url=https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2000/ast06nov_2.htm |accessdate=19 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117170401/https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2000/ast06nov_2.htm |archivedate=17 January 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = 2000 SG344: The Story of a Potential Earth Impactor | last = Chodas | first = P.

==Possible impacts with Earth==
Until December 2004, it was considered to have the highest (though still very low) likelihood of any [[near-Earth object]] to impact Earth in the next 100 years. It is ranked a zero on the [[Torino scale]] of impact risk because of its small size (the scale is 0–10) and is listed on [[Sentry (monitoring system)|Sentry Risk Table]].&lt;ref name=nasa-risk-2000sg344&gt;{{Cite web|title={{mp|2000 SG|344}} Earth Impact Risk Summary |date=2002-05-15 |url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risk/2000sg344.html |accessdate=2004-11-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041024225737/http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risk/2000sg344.html |archivedate=24 October 2004 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nasa-risk&gt;{{Cite web|title=NASA Near Earth Object Program: Current Impact Risks |url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risk/ |accessdate=2004-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529175100/http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risk/ |archivedate=2013-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was briefly surpassed in December 2004 by [[99942 Apophis]] (which at the time was known only by its [[provisional designation]] {{mp|2004 MN|4}}). The smaller asteroids {{mpl|2006 JY|26}} and {{mpl|2010 RF|12}} have a greater chance of impacting Earth.

Based on 31 observations of {{mp|2000 SG|344}} made from May 1999 to October 2000, there is about a 1 in 417 chance that it will collide with Earth between 2069 and 2113. Assuming the object is a rocky asteroid, the impact energy released would be an estimated 1.1 [[TNT equivalent|megatons]] of TNT,&lt;ref name=nasa-risk-2000sg344/&gt; which would create an impact crater approximately {{convert|100|ft|m}} wide assuming it does not explode in the atmosphere.

==Planned NASA mission==
[[NASA]] is considering it as a possible target for a manned mission ([[Exploration Mission 2]]) using the [[Orion spacecraft]], prior to a projected 2030 push to [[Mars]].&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{Cite news|title=Closer encounter: Nasa plans landing on 40m-wide asteroid travelling at 28,000mph |last=Sample |first=Ian |date=7 May 2008 |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/may/07/starsgalaxiesandplanets.spaceexploration |access-date=9 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509181202/http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2008/may/07/starsgalaxiesandplanets.spaceexploration |archivedate=9 May 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Into the Beyond: A Crewed Mission to a Near-Earth Object - [http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/project/neo/pdf/neo_crewed_mission.pdf text] [http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/project/neo/pdf/IAC-07-slides.pdf slides]&lt;/ref&gt; {{mp|2000 SG|344}} will be observable in April 2028 at an [[apparent magnitude]] of 19.&lt;ref name="nhats"/&gt;

On November 30, 2018, at 8:29&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Alaska Time Zone|AKST]] (17:29&amp;nbsp;UTC), a [[Seismic magnitude scales#Mww|magnitude]] 7.0 earthquake hit [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], [[Alaska]].&lt;ref name="USGS"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us1000hyfh/executive |title=M 7.0 – 13km N of Anchorage, Alaska |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |access-date=November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earthquake's epicenter was near [[Joint Base Elmendorf–Richardson]], about {{convert|10|mi|km}} north of the city, and occurred at a depth of {{convert|27|mi|km|0}}.

The [[National Tsunami Warning Center]]—itself located inside the quake zone, in [[Palmer, Alaska]], {{convert|42|mi|km}} northeast of Anchorage—issued [[tsunami warning]]s for nearby coastal areas, including [[Cook Inlet]] and the [[Kenai Peninsula]], but they were lifted shortly after.&lt;ref name=AP /&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news |title=Alaska earthquake: Anchorage rocked by 7.0 tremors |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46403405 |accessdate=November 30, 2018 |publisher=BBC News |date=November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tectonic setting ==
Southern Alaska lies at the eastern end of the [[Aleutian Trench]], where the [[Pacific Plate]] is [[subduction|subducting]] beneath the [[North American Plate]]. Near Anchorage, the plates are converging at a rate of 57 mm per year.&lt;ref name="USGS"/&gt; The region has experienced severe earthquakes in the past, including several [[Megathrust earthquake|megathrust earthquakes]]. The [[1964 Alaska earthquake|1964 earthquake]], with a magnitude of 9.2, was the largest earthquake in American history and the second largest to ever be recorded anywhere in the world. Though earthquakes are common in Alaska, they often occur out at sea.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;

The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.0 on the [[moment magnitude scale]] using a centroid moment tensor inversion of the W-phase.&lt;ref name="USGS"/&gt; The [[focal mechanism]] shows that the earthquake was a result of [[fault (geology)#Dip-slip faults|normal faulting]]. A fault dipping at 29° towards the east gives the best match to the observed seismic waveforms. The depth and mechanism are consistent with faulting within the down-going Pacific Plate. This infers that the earthquake was an intraslab earthquake within that plate, rather than at the plate boundary between the Pacific and North American Plates beneath the Anchorage area.&lt;ref name="USGS"/&gt; This is a different mechanism than megathrust faults in the region, which do occur on the plate boundary itself. This faulting in the Pacific Plate is caused by downward bending while the plate is being forced under Alaska.&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hillman |first1=Anne |last2=Healy |first2=Jack |last3=Fountain |first3=Henry |title=Earthquake Shreds Highways and Sows Panic in South Central Alaska |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/us/earthquake-anchorage-alaska.html |work=[[New York Times]] |date=30 November 2018 |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The year '''532 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. In the [[Roman Empire]], it was known as '''year 222 '' [[Ab urbe condita]]'''''. The denomination 532 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4400">'''''Aalst''''' is a play by the [[Belgian]] stage director [[Pol Heyvaert]]. Based on real-life events that took place in the town of [[Aalst, Belgium|Aalst]] in 1999, the play recounts the murder of two children by their parents. It was originally performed in 2005 by the [[Ghent]]-based theatre company [[Victoria (theatre company)|Victoria]]. Since then, it has toured extensively in [[Europe]] and in [[Canada]].

==The background==
In January 1999, in the suburban Belgian town of Aalst, [[Luc de Winne]] and [[Maggie Strobbe]] checked into a hotel room with their two children, a boy aged seven and an infant girl of three months. They killed the daughter by suffocating her with a [[pillow]], and the son by stabbing him with a pair of [[scissors]]. They were subsequently arrested, tried and sentenced to life imprisonment. The case caused a sensation in Belgium and was the subject of massive coverage in the press and media.

==The play==
In 2005, Pol Heyvaert, a veteran stage designer who had a long-standing relationship with the [[Victoria (theatre company)|Victoria]] theatre company, gave the story dramatic form. Heyvaert and his co-writer [[Dimitri Verhulst]] drew extensively on original source material, including statements and interviews given by the accused, [[television]] footage of the trial and a [[Documentary film|documentary]] on the murder investigation. Heyvaert also designed and directed the play, his first outing as a stage director. 

The format of the play is simple. Separated by a few feet, the couple sit on two chairs with a microphone stand in front of each. A white curtain hangs behind them. The stage is bare of any other furnishing. Over the next 70-odd minutes, the two are interrogated by a disembodied, authoritative voice, and the story of their lives and that of the murder of the children pours forth. 

It transpires that both parents had had horrific childhoods. The woman had been sexually abused by her father while the man had been raised in [[foster care]] and had become a petty criminal at an early age. They are both unemployed and live off generous [[state benefits]], supplemented by income from [[wiktionary:moonlighting|moonlighting]]. Both exhibit a sense of entitlement and a lack of responsibility. They order consumer goods off catalogues, including three [[television set]]s and five [[stereos]], but never pay for these items. Their domestic arrangements are wanting as well. Their house is filthy and constantly in the dark, with the bulbs painted black. Their relationship too is abusive and codependent. The murder of the children is described at length and in detail. The parents excuse their actions by saying that they did not want their children to be taken away by the state and put into foster care, and that they did not want them to suffer in life as they themselves had done. At the very end of the play, doubt is thrown over the veracity of their testimony. 

With its difficult subject-matter and frequently graphic detail, ''Aalst'' has been described as a 'disturbing' and 'complex' play, one that raises hard questions about individual morality and the [[Welfare state|welfare society]]. 

The play has been produced in theatres and festivals across Europe. The Scottish writer [[Duncan McLean (writer)|Duncan McLean]] has also adapted ''Aalst'' into a [[Scotland|Scottish]] version. In March 2007, this version made its UK debut at the [[Tramway theatre]] in [[Glasgow]] as a joint production of Victoria and the [[National Theatre of Scotland]]. [[Kate Dickie]] and [[David McKay (actor)|David McKay]] played the lead roles under Heyvaert's direction. The play then went on tour and made its [[London]] debut in April 2007 at the [[Soho Theatre]].

'''''Abe Lincoln in Illinois''''' is a play written by the American [[playwright]] [[Robert E. Sherwood]] in 1938. The play, in three acts, covers the life of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] from his childhood through his final speech in [[Illinois]] before he left for [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. The play also covers his romance with [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Todd]] and his [[Lincoln–Douglas debates|debates with Stephen A. Douglas]], and uses Lincoln's own words in some scenes. Sherwood received the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] in 1939 for his work.

==Productions==
The play premiered on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on October 15, 1938, at the [[Plymouth Theatre]] and closed in December 1939 after 472 performances. Directed by [[Elmer Rice]], it starred [[Raymond Massey]] as Lincoln, Muriel Kirkland (Mary Todd), Adele Longmire (Ann Rutledge), and Albert Phillips (Stephen A. Douglas).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/9665/Abe-Lincoln-in-Illinois "'Abe Lincoln in Illinois' 1938"] playbillvault.com, accessed December 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; It subsequently transferred to the Grand Opera House in Chicago where it ran for 12 weeks from January 8 through March 30, 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chicago Stagebill Yearbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nGoWAQAAIAAJ|year=1947|publisher=Chicago Stagebill|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massey's role in the play came about as the result of a promise he had made to Sherwood six years previously to "be there when he needed me".&lt;ref name="Foster2003" /&gt; It was the first production of the newly established [[Playwrights' Company]].&lt;ref name="BordmanHischak2004" /&gt;

The play has twice been revived on stage. In 1963 [[Hal Holbrook]] starred as Lincoln in an [[off-Broadway]] revival at the [[Phoenix Theatre (New York)|Phoenix Theatre]].&lt;ref name="BordmanHischak2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bordman|first1=Gerald|last2=Hischak|first2=Thomas S.|title=The Oxford Companion to American Theatre|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DiI1wIyatvUC&amp;pg=PA4|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-516986-7|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second revival took place in 1993 at the [[Vivian Beaumont Theatre]], with [[Sam Waterston]] as Lincoln, and direction by [[Gerald Gutierrez]]. The cast included Marissa Chibas (Ann Rutledge), David Huddleston (Judge Bowling Green), [[Robert Joy]] (Joshua Speed), [[Lizbeth MacKay]] (Mary Todd) and Brian Reddy (Stephen A. Douglas).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/11244/Abe-Lincoln-in-Illinois "'Abe Lincoln in Illinois' 1993"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223090637/http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/11244/Abe-Lincoln-in-Illinois |date=December 23, 2015 }} playbillvault.com, accessed December 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The revival ran from November 29, 1993, to January 2, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=4589 "''Abe Lincoln in Illinois'' 1993"] Internet Broadway Database, accessed September 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview and synopsis==
The play takes place in and around [[Lincoln's New Salem|New Salem, Illinois]], in the 1830s, then in [[Springfield, Illinois]], in the 1840s, and in Act III in Springfield in 1858 to 1861. It is based principally on the 1926 biography ''[[Abraham Lincoln: The Prairie Years]]'' by [[Carl Sandburg]], which covers Lincoln's life up to his inauguration as President. The play depicts Lincoln's evolution from unambitious backwoodsman to a champion of freedom, and relies on the audience's knowledge of Lincoln's subsequent career to color the portrayal of his character.&lt;ref name="Matlaw"&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern World Drama: An Encyclopedia|page=1|last=Matlaw|first=Myron|publisher=Secker &amp; Warburg|date=1972|isbn=0436274353}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sherwood wrote the play as a riposte to [[isolationism|isolationist]] sentiment in the United States in the lead-up to the [[Second World War]]; he had fought in the [[First World War]] but had been disappointed by the way the post-war world had turned out.&lt;ref name="Simon1993"/&gt; The play emphasizes the need to overcome [[laissez-faire]] sentiment and to stand up and take firm political action for the public good.&lt;ref name="Simon1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Simon|first=John|title=New York Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3xwAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA108|date=13 December 1993|page=108|chapter=Lincoln Mercurial}}&lt;/ref&gt; As its star Raymond Massey put it, "If you substitute the word dictatorship for the word slavery throughout Sherwood's script, it becomes electric with meaning for our time."&lt;ref name="Kaufman2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaufman|first=Will|title=Civil War in American Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=982qBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA66|year=2006|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-2656-4|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While much of the dialog is of Sherwood's invention, the play uses some of Lincoln's own words at various points. Lincoln is portrayed not as a saint or a fount of wisdom, but as a humble man of ideas who constantly questions himself and his ability to make a difference. He is haunted by premonitions of death and disaster, prefiguring the bloodshed of the American Civil War and his own assassination. Ann Rutledge, the first great love of his life, is portrayed as Lincoln sees her, as a selfless but ultimately unattainable embodiment of female perfection. His wife Mary, by contrast, is portrayed with an increasingly sharp edge that foreshadows her descent into insanity. Stephen A. Douglas, Lincoln's political opponent in 1858, is portrayed as an adept politician rather than as a villain.&lt;ref name="Hischak2017"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hischak|first=Thomas S.|title=100 Greatest American Plays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EpWpDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3|year=2017|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-1-4422-5606-4|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Act I===
The opening scene of the play depicts New Salem's schoolmaster teaching grammar to Lincoln and encouraging him to appreciate poetry and oratory. Lincoln speaks of his life, referring to his failures as a businessman, his fear of city people and the death of his mother, and expresses his appreciation of [[John Keats]]'s poem ''On Death''.&lt;ref name="Matlaw" /&gt;

In Scene 2, Lincoln meets a number of young politicians at the Rutledge Tavern in New Salem to explore the possibility of him running for the [[Illinois General Assembly]]. By now he is serving as the local postmaster. He convinces them that he would make a good candidate and notes that the pay would help him clear his debts. When the politicians leave he talks with the tavern-keeper's daughter, Ann Rutledge, and declares his love for her. Ann appears receptive and he declares his intention to run for the assembly.&lt;ref name="Matlaw" /&gt;

A year later, Scene 3 sees his friends discussing Lincoln's relative lack of success in his career as an assemblyman and his unrequited romance with Ann, which they feel is a hindrance. He bursts in, announces that Ann has just died, and declares that he has to "die and be with her again, or I'll go crazy!"&lt;ref name="Matlaw" /&gt;

===Act II===

Scene 4 opens five years later with Lincoln now a 31-year-old lawyer in Springfield. He has been aged greatly by the stress of Ann's death, but has been more successful in his career and has managed to pay off some of his debt. He is opposed to slavery but rejects the cause of the [[Abolitionism|Abolitionists]], who he regards as "a pack of hell-roaring fanatics". Lincoln's friends urge him to re-enter politics but he disclaims any desire to "get down into the blood-soaked arena and grapple with all the lions of injustice and oppression". In a bit to shake him out of his lethargy, a friend introduces him to Mary Todd, the daughter of the president of the Bank of Kentucky.&lt;ref name="Matlaw" /&gt;

Half a year has passed by the time of Scene 5, when the ambitious Mary decides that she will marry Lincoln. Her sister criticises her decision, calling him a "lazy and shiftless" boor. Mary defends Lincoln, saying that she wants to shape a new life for the couple.&lt;ref name="Matlaw2"&gt;Matlaw, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The wedding is set to take place in Scene 6 but Lincoln has developed cold feet. A friend tries to persuade him not to cancel it, and Mary's brother-in-law advises him to "keep a tight rein" on her ambition for him to become President. Lincoln's clerk applauds his betrothal to someone who will push him to fight for the freedom of the slaves. Lincoln himself decides that his ambitions lie elsewhere, cancels the wedding and leaves Springfield.&lt;ref name="Matlaw2" /&gt;

In Scene 7, Lincoln meets a friend who is heading west and is confronted by the fact that the infamous decision in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' has effectively extended slavery there as well. The friend, who is travelling with a free black companion, says that he will go to [[Canada]] or establish a new free country if his companion and other black people cannot be free in the United States. Lincoln realises that the country is in peril and urges his friend not to give up. He prays for help from God and urges the Almighty to grant his friend's child and all men their birthrights.&lt;ref name="Matlaw2" /&gt;

Lincoln heads back to Springfield in Scene 8 and meets again with Mary Todd. He appeals to her to marry him, telling her, "The way I must go is the way you have always wanted me to go." He promises to devote the rest of his life to doing "what is right." Mary falls into his arms and declares that she loves him eternally.&lt;ref name="Matlaw2" /&gt;

===Act III===

Scene 9 opens with Lincoln and his rival senatorial candidate Stephen A. Douglas making [[Lincoln–Douglas debates|opposing speeches on slavery]] in an Illinois town during the [[United States Senate elections, 1858|1858 campaign]] for the [[U.S. Senate]].&lt;ref name="Matlaw2" /&gt;

Jumping to 1860 in Scene 10, Lincoln and Mary sit in the parlor of their house with their boys, awaiting the arrival of senior politicians intent on sounding him out for the Republican Party's presidential nomination. Mary is angered by her eldest son's habit of smoking in the house and Lincoln's failure to tell her about the politicians' visit, though she recognizes the burden of her growing irritability, which prefigures her eventual insanity. The visitors conclude that in his "curious, primitive way," Lincoln could be a winning presidential candidate.&lt;ref name="Matlaw3"&gt;Matlaw, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860 presidential election]] is the focus of Scene 11, in which Lincoln and Mary await the election results. By now they are quarreling openly. She tells him that even if he wins, "it's ruined, for me. It's too late." Lincoln does win but regrets having had to fight "the dirtiest campaign in the history of corrupt politics." As he leaves home with a [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] escort, he feels the full weight of his responsibilities.&lt;ref name="Matlaw3" /&gt;

The play concludes in Scene 12 with Lincoln preparing to depart from Springfield's railroad station (the present [[Lincoln Depot]]) and go to Washington, D.C. for [[First inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|his inauguration]]. His Secret Service bodyguards worry about protecting him in the face of the many death threats he has received even before taking office. Lincoln appears before a crowd and gives [[Abraham Lincoln's Farewell Address|a farewell address]]. As the train pulls out, the crowd sings (anachronistically), "[[John Brown's Body|His soul goes marching on]]."&lt;ref name="Matlaw3" /&gt;

==Adaptations==
{{main article|Abe Lincoln in Illinois (film)}}
The play was adapted into a film, also called ''[[Abe Lincoln in Illinois (film)|Abe Lincoln in Illinois]]'', which was released in 1940 and was directed by [[John Cromwell (director)|John Cromwell]]. When Sherwood agreed to sell the film rights, he added a condition that Massey was to be given the starring role. After receiving an Oscar nomination for the film, Massey went on to portray Lincoln twice more in films and in two television adaptations, leading him to complain jokingly that he was "the only actor ever typecast as a president."&lt;ref name="Foster2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Foster|first=Charles|title=Once Upon a Time in Paradise: Canadians in the Golden Age of Hollywood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cb49Y-xN5TcC&amp;pg=PA226|year=2003|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=978-1-55002-997-0|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were six television adaptations in all, in 1945, 1950, 1951, 1957, 1963 and 1964. Massey reprised his stage role in the 1950 and 1951 adaptations. The 1964 production in the [[Hallmark Hall of Fame]] series featured [[Jason Robards]] in the title role, and [[Kate Reid]] as Mary Todd.&lt;ref name="Reinhart2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reinhart|first=Mark S.|title=Abraham Lincoln on Screen: Fictional and Documentary Portrayals on Film and Television|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zio49y0tiE0C|year=2009|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5261-3|pages=24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical response==
[[File:Abe Lincoln in Illinois play flyer.png|thumb|Flyer for the play's Chicago run, 1940]]
The play was critically acclaimed for its original 1938 run. The ''[[New York Herald Tribune|Herald Tribune]]'s'' reviewer, Richard Watts Jr., called it "Not only the finest of modern stage biographies, but a lovely, eloquent, endearing tribute to all that is best in the spirit of democracy."&lt;ref name="BordmanHischak2004" /&gt; Burns Mantle of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' called it "biographical drama with a soul", while Richard Lockridge of the ''[[New York Evening Sun]]'' described it as "a satisfying and deeply impressive play."&lt;ref&gt;Hischak (2017), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The critic [[Brooks Atkinson]] called it Sherwood's "finest play" and commended it for furthering "the principles of American liberty" while still providing an honest presentation of Lincoln's formative years.&lt;ref name="Matviko2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Matviko|first=John W.|title=The American President in Popular Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xavpmPflWygC&amp;pg=PA58|year=2005|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-32705-6|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was awarded a Pulitzer Prize in 1939 by a majority vote of the prize jury, with the supporting jurors describing it as "a competent play by an experienced dramatist, with the chief figure movingly presented, with the minor characters done adequately and adroitly."&lt;ref name="Fischer2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=Heinz-Dietrich|title=Outstanding Broadway Dramas and Comedies: Pulitzer Prize Winning Theater Productions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pxU7nMu7wEcC&amp;pg=PA48|year=2013|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-643-90341-9|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many critics highlighted Massey's performance for praise; his preparation was so meticulous and obsessive that the critic [[David S. Kaufman]] suggested that he would not be satisfied until he was assassinated.&lt;ref&gt;Hischak (2017), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1993 revival was less positively received than its predecessors. The original had been seen as ground-breaking and complex, but by 1990s standards it was viewed as too long and outdated. Some critics praised its sweep and Sam Waterston's performance, but others, like David Richards of ''[[The New York Times]]'', felt it was too "didactic or melodramatic".&lt;ref name="Matviko2005" /&gt; He wrote, "'Abe Lincoln in Illinois' is an endeavor of daunting dimensions....for all its loftiness of purpose and the generosity of Lincoln's own words, some of which are incorporated into the script, Sherwood's dramaturgy seems dismayingly earthbound today. When the dialogue is not clumsy... it smacks of simple-mindedness... When Lincoln finds his life's purpose and steels himself for the ordeals to come, Mr. Waterston is able to suggest great stature simply by standing tall and motionless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Richards|first=David|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/30/theater/review-theater-abe-lincoln-illinois-lincoln-metaphor-for-big-job-ahead-1939.html|title=Review/Theater: Abe Lincoln in Illinois; Lincoln as Metaphor For a Big Job Ahead, In 1939 and Today|work=The New York Times|date=November 30, 1993|accessdate=May 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linda Winer suggested that the TV [[miniseries]] had taken over as audiences' preferred format for such historical or biographical dramas.&lt;ref name="Matviko2005" /&gt;

In an '''accident on the Rampe de Laffrey''' on April 2, 1975, 29 [[pilgrim]]s from [[Sully-sur-Loire]] in [[Loiret]] were killed when their [[bus]] lost its [[brake]]s at the bottom of the [[Rampe de Laffrey|road]], causing it to fly over a ravine at a speed estimated at 120 kilometers an hour; it then crashed into a [[garden]] and overturned.  The accident came on the heels of [[Accident on the Rampe de Laffrey (1973)|one in 1973]] that killed 43, and was very similar to one that occurred along the same road [[Accident on the Rampe de Laffrey (1946)|in 1946]], killing 18.

As a result of this crash, more careful regulation of electronic braking systems was instituted across [[France]], as were annual inspections of heavy vehicles.&lt;ref name=Laffrey&gt;[http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualites/societe/20070722.OBS7710/laffrey__une_descente_meurtriere.html?idfx=RSS_societe Laffrey : une descente meurtrière, ACCIDENT DE CAR&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5608">'''Alptakin''' (also known as '''Haftakin''' and '''Aftakin''') was a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] military officer of the [[Buyids]], and later the ruler of [[Damascus]].

== Early life and rebellion against the Buyids ==
He was a [[freedman]] of the Buyid ruler of [[Iraq]], [[Izz al-Dawla|Izz al-Dawla Bakhtiyar]].{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=343}} Nothing further is known about him until in 973, when he joined the rebellion of the Turkish officer Sebük-Tegin, who managed to occupy [[Baghdad]] and many other parts of Iraq. The Turkish rebels under Sebük-Tegin then besieged [[Wasit]], where Izz al-Dawla had fortified himself. Sebük-Tegin died during the siege, and Alptakin was shortly chosen as the new leader of the Turks. Meanwhile, a Buyid army under Izz al-Dawla's cousin [[Adud al-Dawla]] was marching towards Iraq, and by 975 managed to completely defeat the rebels at the [[Diyala River]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=224}}

== Invasion of Syria and war with the Fatimids ==
[[File:Syria in the 9th century.svg|thumb|right|250px|Map of Early Islamic Syria and its provinces]]
After his defeat at the hands of the Buyids, along with ca. 300 of his followers,{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=205}} Alptakin fled to [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]], where they managed to capture [[Hims]].{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=343}} Alptakin then allied himself with the [[Qarmatians]], and in the winter of 975 invaded the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast and laid siege to [[Fatimid]] city of [[Sidon]]. He shortly managed to capture the city, resulting in the massacre of 4,000 Fatimid troops.{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=343}} He then captured [[Tiberias]], and marched towards to [[Damascus]], which he took without much resistance. The Fatimid [[Caliph]] [[al-Aziz Billah]] then sent an army under his general Jawhar, who managed to reconquer the Mediterranean coast and reach as far as Damascus, which he besieged.{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=348}}
 
Alptakin's Qarmatian allies soon arrived, and managed to force the Fatimids to lift the siege. The Fatimid army then fled to [[Ramla]], but quickly abandoned it, leaving the city open to a Qarmatian invasion.{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=349}} The combined army of Alptakin and the Qarmatians then besieged [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]], where the Fatimid army had fled to. After a long siege which lasted over a year, the Fatimids agreed to make a peace treaty: Alptakin would receive [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], while the northern border of the Fatimid domain was set at [[Gaza City|Gaza]].{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=349}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=321}} To make the treaty more palatable to the Fatimids, Alptakin agreed to recognize the Fatimid Caliph as his suzerain.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=321}}

In 978, Izz al-Dawla, whose territories had been conquered by Adud al-Dawla, fled along with his two brothers and other [[Dailamite]] followers to Damascus, where they were warmly received by Alptakin, who incorporated the Dailamites into his army.{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=350}} Meanwhile, a new Fatimid army under al-Aziz himself was marching towards Damascus, and a battle ensued between the Turks and the Fatimids near Ramla; Alptakin charged the left wing of the Fatimids, killing many. However, the Fatimids turned the tide of the battle by making a counter-attack on the centre and right wing of Alptakin's army, killing ca. 20,000 of his men.{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=351}}

Alptakin managed to flee from the battlefield to the desert, where he almost died of thirst, but was found by the leader of the [[Tayy]] tribe and an old friend of his, [[Mufarrij ibn Daghfal ibn al-Jarrah]]. Alptakin was brought to the latter's home, where he was treated with honour. During his stay the latter's home, however, Mufarrij betrayed him and gave him to al-Aziz in exchange for 100,000 [[gold dinar]]s.{{sfn|Canard|1991|pp=482–483}}{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=351}}

Alptakin was then taken to the Fatimid capital of [[Cairo]], where he was honourably treated by al-Aziz, who incorporated Alptakin along with his Turkish followers into the Fatimid army. However, Alptakin was later poisoned by al-Aziz's [[vizier]], [[Yaqub ibn Killis]].{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=352}}

==Background==
The Bárcenas affair broke out on 18 January 2013, when Spain's leading center-right daily, ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'', revealed that the PP treasurer, Luis Bárcenas had, until stepping down in 2009 after being named a defendant in the [[Gürtel case|Gürtel political corruption case]],&lt;ref name=blame/&gt; used the slush fund to pay out monthly amounts, ranging from 5,000 to 15,000 euros, to leading members of the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2013/01/18/espana/1358536985.html Bárcenas pagó sobresueldos en negro durante años a parte de la cúpula del PP] ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]''. Retrieved 15 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 January 2013, Spain’s leading center-left daily, ''[[El País]]'', in turn published what became known as the "Bárcenas papers", which consist of facsimile excerpts from handwritten ledgers in Bárcenas’ hand.&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}}  [http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2013/01/30/actualidad/1359583204_085918.html "Las cuentas secretas de Bárcenas"] ''[[El País]]''. Retrieved 15 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/31/us-spain-corruption-cospedal-idUSBRE90U0NA20130131 "Spain's ruling party says all payments to its leaders are legal"] [[Reuters]]. Retrieved 15 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Current senate president [[Pío García Escudero]], later stated that one of the payments that figure in Bárcenas’ handwriting corresponded to a cash loan he had been given to repair damage to his home after a terrorist attack,&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; and on 13 August 2013, Cristóbal Páez, a former PP finance manager, testified that he had received 12,000 euros in two payments in 2007 and 2008, as reflected in Bárcenas' handwritten notes.&lt;ref name=lack&gt;[http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/08/13/inenglish/1376410415_620201.html "Two former PP chiefs admit to lack of control over accounts"] ''[[El País]]''. Retrieved 15 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of June 2013, the investigating judge, [[Pablo Ruz]], faced with the risk of a defendant with access to considerable offshore funds fleeing the country, ordered that Bárcenas be remanded in prison  without bail,&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2013/06/27/espana/1372330113.html "Bárcenas, en la cárcel.

Retrieved 15 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; on charges of [[tax fraud]] and [[money-laundering]].&lt;ref name=economist/&gt;

On 7 July 2013, ''El Mundo'' published an exclusive interview between Bárcenas and its editor-in-chief, [[Pedro J. Ramírez]], in which the former admitted the authenticity of the so-called "Bárcenas papers", which he had initially denied out of loyalty to his party. He likewise admitted that both he and the previous party treasurer, [[Álvaro Lapuerta]], had received cash donations from real estate agents and other businessmen in "bags, suitcases and briefcases" that were used as a slush fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2013/07/07/espana/1373186360.html "Cuatro horas con Bárcenas"] ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]''.

The '''dot-com bubble''' (also known as the '''dot-com boom''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.businessinsider.com/where-are-the-kings-of-the-1990s-dot-com-bubble-bust-2016-12 | title=One of the kings of the '90s dot-com bubble now faces 20 years in prison | first=Jim | last=Edwards | work=[[Business Insider]] | date=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the '''tech bubble''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tech_bubble.asp | title=Tech Bubble | work=[[Investopedia]] | date=September 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the '''Internet bubble''') was a historic [[economic bubble]] and period of excessive [[speculation]] that occurred roughly from 1995 to 2000, a period of extreme growth in the usage and adaptation of the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name=causes&gt;{{cite book | title=Rise and Burst of the Dotcom Bubble: Causes, Characteristics, Examples | last=Wollscheid | first=Christian | publisher=GRIN Verlag | date=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nasdaq Composite]] [[stock market index]], which included many Internet-based companies, peaked in value on March 10, 2000 before crashing. The burst of the bubble, known as the '''dot-com crash''', lasted from March 11, 2000 to October 9, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.investopedia.com/features/crashes/crashes8.asp | title=Market Crashes: The Dotcom Crash | work=[[Investopedia]] | date=January 7, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=causes/&gt; During the crash, many [[online shopping]] companies, such as [[Pets.com]], [[Webvan]], and [[Boo.com]], as well as communication companies, such as [[Worldcom]], [[NorthPoint Communications]] and [[Global Crossing]] failed and shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.cnet.com/uk/news/the-greatest-defunct-web-sites-and-dotcom-disasters/ | title=The greatest defunct Web sites and dotcom disasters | work=[[CNET]] | date=June 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=valuation&gt;{{cite book | title=Valuation: Theories and Concepts | last=Kumar | first=Rajesh | publisher=[[Elsevier]] | date=December 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Cisco]], whose stock declined by 86%,&lt;ref name=valuation/&gt; and [[Qualcomm]], lost a large portion of their market capitalization but survived, and some companies, such as [[eBay]] and [[Amazon.com]], declined in value but recovered quickly.

==Prelude to the bubble==
In 1993, the release of the [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic web browser]] made access to the [[World Wide Web]] possible (prior Internet services like [[Usenet]], [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]], [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]], etc existed but [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] was the new invention which triggered this growth).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2003-04-20/mosaic-started-web-rush-internet-boom.html | title=Mosaic started Web rush, Internet boom | first=Greg | last=Kline | work=[[The News-Gazette (Champaign-Urbana)|The News-Gazette]] | date=April 20, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet usage increased as a result of the reduction of the "[[digital divide]]" and advances in connectivity, uses of the Internet, and computer education. Between 1990 and 1997, the percentage of households in the United States owning computers increased from 15% to 35% as computer ownership progressed from a luxury to a necessity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/archive/computer-ownership-up-sharply-in-the-1990s.pdf | title=Issues in labor Statistics | publisher=[[U.S. Department of Labor]] | year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the shift to the [[Information Age]], an economy based on [[information technology]], and many new companies were founded.

At the same time, relatively lower interest rates increased the availability of capital compared to the 1970s and 1980s, where bouts of extreme inflation led to historically high interest rates to contain/reduce high inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/history-of-the-dot-com-bubble-in-photos-2016-2/ | title=If you're too young to remember the insanity of the dot-com bubble, check out these pictures | first=Matt | last=Weinberger | work=[[Business Insider]] | date=February 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997]], which lowered the top marginal [[capital gains tax in the United States]], also made people more willing to make more speculative investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-why-the-dot-com-bubble-began-and-why-it-popped-2010-12 | title=Here's Why The Dot Com Bubble Began And Why It Popped | work=[[Business Insider]] | date=December 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Greenspan]], the former [[Chair of the Federal Reserve]], allegedly fueled investments in the stock market by putting a positive spin on stock valuations.&lt;ref name=enigma/&gt; The [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]] was expected to result in many new technologies, and people wanted to profit from them.&lt;ref name=now/&gt;

==The bubble==
As a result of these factors, many investors were eager to invest, at any valuation, in any [[dot-com company]], especially if it had one of the [[Internet-related prefixes]] or a "[[.com]]" [[suffix]] in its name.&lt;ref name=bubble/&gt; [[Venture capital]] was easy to raise. [[Investment bank]]s, which profited significantly from [[initial public offering]]s (IPO), fueled speculation and encouraged investment in technology.&lt;ref name=swindle/&gt; A combination of rapidly increasing stock prices in the [[quaternary sector of the economy]] and confidence that the companies would turn future profits created an environment in which many investors were willing to overlook traditional metrics, such as the [[price–earnings ratio]], and base confidence on technological advancements, leading to a [[stock market bubble]].&lt;ref name=enigma&gt;{{cite journal | last=Teeter | first=Preston | last2=Sandberg | first2=Jorgen | year=2017 | title=Cracking the enigma of asset bubbles with narratives | url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1476127016629880 | journal=Strategic Organization | volume=15 | issue=1 | pages=91–99 | doi=10.1177/1476127016629880}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1995 and 2000, the Nasdaq Composite stock market index rose 400%.&lt;ref name=bubble&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dotcom-bubble.asp | title=Dotcom Bubble | publisher=[[Investopedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reached a price–earnings ratio of 200, dwarfing the peak price–earnings ratio of 80 for the Japanese [[Nikkei 225]] during the [[Japanese asset price bubble]] of 1991.&lt;ref name=enigma/&gt; In 1999, shares of [[Qualcomm]] rose in value by 2,619%, 12 other large-cap stocks each rose over 1,000%  value, and 7 additional large-cap stocks each rose over 900% in value. Even though the Nasdaq Composite rose 85.6% and the [[S&amp;P 500 Index]] rose 19.5% in 1999, more stocks fell in value than rose in value as investors sold stocks in slower growing companies to invest in Internet stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/03/business/the-year-in-the-markets-1999-extraordinary-winners-and-more-losers.html | title=THE YEAR IN THE MARKETS; 1999: Extraordinary Winners and More Losers | first=Floyd | last=Norris | authorlink=Floyd Norris | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=January 3, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unprecedented amount of personal investing occurred during the boom and stories of people quitting their jobs to engage in full-time [[day trading]] were common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,991726,00.html | title=Day Trading: It's a Brutal World | first=Daniel | last=Kadlec | work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=August 9, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[news media]] took advantage of the public's desire to invest in the stock market; an article in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' suggested that investors "re-think" the "quaint idea" of profits, and [[CNBC]] reported on the stock market with the same level of suspense as many networks provided to the [[broadcasting of sports events]].&lt;ref name=enigma/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JMVzmoK_I80C | title=Origins of the Crash: The Great Bubble and Its Undoing | first=Roger | last=Lowenstein | authorlink=Roger Lowenstein | publisher=[[Penguin Books]] | year=2004 | ISBN=1-59420-003-3 | page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the height of the boom, it was possible for a promising dot-com company to become a [[public company]] via an IPO and raise a substantial amount of money even if it had never made a profit—or, in some cases, realized any material revenue. People who received [[employee stock option]]s became instant paper millionaires when their companies executed IPOs; however, most employees were barred from selling shares immediately due to [[lock-up period]]s.&lt;ref name=swindle&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Totally_Wired.html?id=GoDuPQAACAAJ | title=Totally Wired: On the Trail of the Great Dotcom Swindle | authorlink=Andrew Smith (author) | first=Andrew | last=Smith | publisher=[[Bloomsbury Books]] | year=2012 | ISBN=978-1-84737-449-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most successful entrepreneurs, such as [[Mark Cuban]], sold their shares or entered into [[Hedge (finance)|hedges]] to protect their gains.

===Spending tendencies of dot-com companies===
Most dot-com companies incurred [[net operating loss]]es as they spent heavily on advertising and promotions to harness [[network effect]]s to build [[market share]] or [[mind share]] as fast as possible, using the mottos "get big fast" and "get large or get lost". These companies offered their services or products for free or at a discount with the expectation that they could build enough [[brand awareness]] to charge profitable rates for their services in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html | title=How to Start a Startup | publisher=[[Paul Graham (programmer)|Paul Graham]] | date=October 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lessons&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/23/business/23proto.html | title=Lessons of Survival, From the Dot-Com Attic | first=LESLIE | last=BERLIN | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=November 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB958412442522904320 | title=MotherNature.com's CEO Defends Dot-Coms' Get-Big-Fast Strategy | first=John | last=Dodge | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=May 16, 2000}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2000, there were 16 [[dot-com commercials during Super Bowl XXXIV]], each costing $2 million for a 30-second spot.

The "growth over profits" mentality and the aura of "[[new economy]]" invincibility led some companies to engage in lavish spending on elaborate business facilities and luxury vacations for employees. Upon the launch of a new product or website, a company would organize an expensive event called a [[dot com party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.salon.com/2000/04/25/party_5/ | title=Dot-com party madness | first=Damien | last=Cave | work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] | date=April 25, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/dec/25/news/mn-4559 | title=Dot-Com Parties Dry Up | first=P.J. | last=HuffStutter | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=December 25, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bubble in telecom===
[[Telecommunications equipment]] providers, convinced that the future economy would require ubiquitous [[broadband access]], went deeply into debt to improve their networks with high-speed equipment and [[fiber optic]] cables. In many areas, such as the [[Dulles Technology Corridor]] in Virginia, governments funded technology infrastructure and created favorable business and tax law to encourage companies to expand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Donnelly | first=Sally B. | last2=Zagorin | first2=Adam | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,997688-1,00.html | title=D.C. Dotcom | work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=August 14, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, [[mobile phone]] companies overspent on [[3G]] licences, which led them deep into debt. The investments in infrastructure were far out of proportion to [[cash flow]]. These were major factors that led to the [[telecoms crash]].&lt;ref name=now&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-telecommunications-crash-what-to-do-now/ | title=The Telecommunications Crash: What To Do Now? | work=[[Brookings Institution]] | date=December 1, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bursting of the bubble==
{{see also|Early 2000s recession}}
[[File:U.S. Treasuries.png|thumb|400px|right|Historical government interest rates in the United States]]

Around the turn of the millennium, spending on technology was volatile as companies prepared for the [[Year 2000 problem]], which, when the clocks changed to the year 2000, actually had minimal impact.

On January 10, 2000, [[America Online]], led by [[Steve Case]] and [[Ted Leonsis]], announced a [[mergers and acquisitions|merger]] with [[Time Warner]], led by [[Gerald M. Levin]]. The merger was the largest to date and was questioned by many analysts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://money.cnn.com/2000/01/10/deals/aol_warner/ | title=Thats AOL folks | first=Tom | last=Johnson | work=[[CNN]] | date=January 10, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2000, with the Year 2000 problem no longer a worry, [[Alan Greenspan]] announced plans to aggressively raise interest rates, which led to significant stock market volatility as analysts disagreed as to whether or not technology companies would be affected by higher borrowing costs.

On March 10, 2000, the NASDAQ Composite stock market index peaked at 5,048.62.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wired.com/2010/03/0310nasdaq-bust/ | title=March 10, 2000: Pop Goes the Nasdaq! | first=Tony | last=Long | work=[[Wired (magazine)|WIRED]] | date=March 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 13, 2000, news that [[Japan]] had once again entered a [[recession]] triggered a global sell off that disproportionately affected technology stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://money.cnn.com/2000/03/13/markets/markets_newyork/ | title=Nasdaq tumbles on Japan | work=[[CNN]] | date=March 13, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 15, 2000, [[Yahoo!]] and [[eBay]] ended merger talks and the Nasdaq fell 2.6% but the S&amp;P 500 Index rose 2.4% as investors shifted from strong performing technology stocks to poor performing established stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://money.cnn.com/2000/03/15/markets/markets_newyork/ | title=Dow wows Wall Street | work=[[CNN]] | date=March 15, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 20, 2000, ''[[Barron's (newspaper)|Barron's]]'' featured a cover article titled "Burning Up; Warning: Internet companies are running out of cash -- fast", which predicted the imminent bankruptcy of many internet companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.barrons.com/articles/SB953335580704470544 | title=Burning Up; Warning: Internet companies are running out of cash -- fast | first=Jack | last=Willoughby | work=[[Barron's (newspaper)|Barron's]] | date=March 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led many people to rethink their investments. That same day, [[Microstrategy]] announced a revenue restatement due to aggressive accounting practices. Its stock price, which had risen from $7 per share to as high as $333 per share in a year, fell $140 per share, or 62%, in a day.&lt;ref name=micro&gt;{{cite news | url=https://money.cnn.com/2000/03/20/companies/microstrategy/ | title=MicroStrategy plummets | work=[[CNN]] | date=March 20, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, leading to an [[inverted yield curve]], although stocks rallied temporarily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://money.cnn.com/2000/03/21/markets/markets_newyork/ | title=Wall St.: What rate hike? | work=[[CNN]] | date=March 21, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 3, 2000, judge [[Thomas Penfield Jackson]] issued his ''conclusions of law'' in the case of [[United States v. Microsoft Corp. (2001)]] and ruled that Microsoft was guilty of [[monopolization]] and [[tying (commerce)|tying]] in violation of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]. This led to a one-day 15% decline in the value of shares in Microsoft and a 350-point, or 8%, drop in the value of the Nasdaq. Many people saw the legal actions as bad for technology in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://money.cnn.com/2000/04/03/markets/markets_newyork/ | title=Nasdaq sinks 350 points | work=[[CNN]] | date=April 3, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same day, Bloomberg published a widely read article that stated: "It's time, at last, to pay attention to the numbers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2000-04-02/commentary-earth-to-dot-com-accountants | title=Commentary: Earth To Dot Com Accountants | first=Catherine | last=Yang | work=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] | date=April 3, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Friday, April 14, 2000, the Nasdaq Composite index fell 9%, ending a week in which it fell 25%. Investors were forced to sell stocks ahead of [[Tax Day (United States)|Tax Day]], the due date to pay taxes on gains realized in the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/2000/04/14/markets/markets_newyork/ | title=Bleak Friday on Wall Street | work=[[CNN Money]] | date=April 14, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By June 2000, dot-com companies were forced to rethink their advertising campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/iq-news-dot-coms-re-evaluate-ad-spending-habits-38208/ | title=IQ News: Dot-Coms Re-Evaluate Ad Spending Habits | first=Jennifer | last=Owens | work=[[AdWeek]] | date=June 19, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 9, 2000, Pets.com, a much-hyped company that had backing from Amazon.com, went out of business only nine months after completing its IPO.&lt;ref name=pets&gt;{{cite news | url=https://money.cnn.com/2000/11/07/technology/pets/ | title=Pets.com at its tail end | work=[[CNN]] | date=November 7, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-originals/watch/the-pets-com-phenomenon-789155395746 | title=The Pets.com Phenomenon | work=[[MSNBC]] | date=October 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, most internet stocks had declined in value by 75% from their highs, wiping out $1.755 trillion in value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://money.cnn.com/2000/11/09/technology/overview/ | title=The $1.7 trillion dot.com lesson | first=David | last=Kleinbard | work=[[CNN]] | date=November 9, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2001, just three dot-com companies bought advertising spots during [[Super Bowl XXXV]]: [[E-Trade]], [[Monster.com]], and [[Yahoo!

Investor confidence was further eroded by several [[accounting scandal]]s and the resulting bankruptcies, including the [[Enron scandal]] in October 2001, the [[WorldCom scandal|Worldcom scandal]] in June 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://money.cnn.com/2002/07/19/news/worldcom_bankruptcy/ | title=WorldCom files largest bankruptcy ever | first=Luisa | last=Beltran | work=[[CNN]] | date=July 22, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Adelphia Communications Corporation]] scandal in July 2002.

By the end of the [[stock market downturn of 2002]], stocks had lost $5 trillion in [[market capitalization]] since the peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jul/16/business/fi-overheat16 | title=Fears of Dot-Com Crash, Version 2.0 | first1=Chris | last1=Gaither | first2=Dawn C. | last2=Chmielewski | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=July 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its trough on October 9, 2002, the NASDAQ-100 had dropped to 1,114, down 78% from its peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nasdaq.com/article/3-lessons-for-investors-from-the-tech-bubble-cm443106 | title=3 Lessons for Investors From the Tech Bubble | first=James K. | last=Glassman | work=[[Kiplinger's Personal Finance]] | date=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2005/mar/10/newmedia.media | title=Looking back on the crash | first=Chris | last=Alden | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=March 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
After venture capital was no longer available, the operational mentality of executives and investors completely changed. A dot-com company's lifespan was measured by its [[burn rate]], the rate at which it spent its existing capital. Many dot-com companies ran out of capital and went through [[liquidation]]. Supporting industries, such as advertising and shipping, scaled back their operations as demand for services fell. However, many companies were able to endure the crash; 48% of dot-com companies survived through 2004, albeit at lower valuations.&lt;ref name=lessons/&gt;

Several companies and their executives were accused or convicted of [[fraud]] for misusing shareholders' money, and the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] levied large fines against investment firms including [[Citigroup]] and [[Merrill Lynch]] for misleading investors.

After suffering losses, retail investors transitioned their investment portfolios to more cautious positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Hard Times Investing: For Some, Cash Is Everything And Only Thing | url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/38308960 | first=Rob | last=Reuteman | work=[[CNBC]] | date=August 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Job market and office equipment glut===
Layoffs of [[programmer]]s resulted in a [[general glut]] in the job market. University enrollment for computer-related degrees dropped noticeably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=desJardins | first=Marie | title=The real reason U.S. students lag behind in computer science | url=http://fortune.com/2015/10/22/u-s-students-computer-science/ | work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] | date=October 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=After the Dot-Com Bubble: Silicon Valley High-Tech Employment And Wages in 2001 and 2008 | url=https://www.bls.gov/opub/regional_reports/200908_silicon_valley_high_tech.htm | first1=Amar | last1=Mann | first2=Tony | last2=Nunes | work=[[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anecdotes of unemployed programmers going back to school to become accountants or lawyers were common.

Failed startups liquidated all of their computer equipment and office equipment such as [[Herman Miller (manufacturer)|Herman Miller]] [[Aeron chair]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/13/what-silicon-valley-was-like-right-after-the-dotcom-crash-an-insider-perspective/ | title=What Silicon Valley Was Like Right After The Dotcom Crash: An Insider Perspective | first=Robin | last=Wauters | work=[[TechCrunch]] | date=January 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
As growth in the information technology sector stabilized, companies consolidated, some, such as [[Amazon.com]], [[eBay]], and [[Google]] gained market share and came to dominate their respective fields. The information technology industry came to more closely resemble other sectors of the economy, albeit with still a faster growth rate and higher valuations than other sectors. There are now many information technology companies ranked at the top of the [[Fortune 500]].

In a 2015 book, venture capitalist [[Fred Wilson (financier)|Fred Wilson]], who funded dot-com companies and lost 90% of his net worth when the bubble burst, said about the dot-com bubble: {{quote|"A friend of mine has a great line. He says 'Nothing important has ever been built without [[irrational exuberance]]'. Meaning that you need some of this mania to cause investors to open up their pocketbooks and finance the building of the railroads or the automobile or aerospace industry or whatever. And in this case, much of the capital invested was lost, but also much of it was invested in a very high [[throughput]] backbone for the Internet, and lots of software that works, and databases and server structure. All that stuff has allowed what we have today, which has changed all our lives... that's what all this speculative mania built".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Here’s what the future of bitcoin looks like — and it’s bright | url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/02/14/heres-what-the-future-of-bitcoin-looks-like-and-its-bright/ | first=JACOB | last=DONNELLY | work=[[VentureBeat]] | date=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

}}For years, [[Crisis in Venezuela (2012–present)|Venezuela has suffered from a political and economic crisis]] following the presidency of [[Hugo Chávez]] and his successor [[Nicolás Maduro]]. While working as a law enforcement agent, [[Óscar Alberto Pérez|Óscar Pérez]] stated that he witnessed deep levels of corruption within the Bolivarian Government's structure, experiencing the collaboration between state authorities and pro-government gangs known as the [[Colectivo (Venezuela)|Colectivos]] in acts of theft and extortion while also observing the movement of cocaine by government officials with full impunity, singling out [[Néstor Reverol]] as an official who hampered his investigations into the matters.&lt;ref name="INDjan18"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/oscar-perez-death-venezuela-helicopter-attack-caracas-muerte-suspendida-a8177051.html|title=Venezuela’s most-wanted rebel shared his story, just before being gunned down|date=25 January 2018|work=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pérez expressed in interviews how he had thought about incorporating his helicopter skills in a protest for some time.&lt;ref name="INDjan18" /&gt; Finally in mid-June 2017, Pérez's brother was murdered near Carabobo Park in Caracas. It was determined that his brother was stabbed to death for the theft of his cell phone.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/politica/director-muerte-suspendida-oscar-perez-ayudaba-ninos-necesitados_190596|title=Director de Muerte Suspendida: Óscar Pérez ayudaba a niños necesitados|last=González|first=Tahiana|date=2017-06-30|work=[[El Nacional (Caracas)|El Nacional]]|access-date=2018-01-18|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="INDjan18" /&gt;

Weeks later on the afternoon of 27 June 2017, a video was released showing men with assault rifles flanking Pérez, stating that "We are nationalists, patriots and institutionalists. This fight is not with the rest of the state forces, it is against the tyranny of this government".&lt;ref name="PANOperez2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628015924/http://www.panorama.com.ve/experienciapanorama/Funcionario-del-Cicpc-se-convirtio-en-protagonista-de-una-pelicula-20151025-0041.html|title=Funcionario del Cicpc se convirtió en protagonista de una película|last1=Rincón|first1=Arminda|date=25 October 2015|work=[[Diario Panorama]]|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.elheraldo.co/mundo/militar-roba-helicoptero-y-lanza-granadas-contra-sede-de-tsj-de-venezuela-376657|title=Militar roba helicóptero y lanza granadas contra sede de TSJ de Venezuela|date=27 June 2017|work=[[El Heraldo (Colombia)|El Heraldo]]|accessdate=28 June 2017|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hours after the video was released, Pérez was seen piloting a CICPC helicopter over the [[Supreme Tribunal of Justice (Venezuela)|Supreme Tribunal of Justice]] with a banner on the side reading "350 Liberty", a reference to Article 350 of the constitution which states that "The people of Venezuela ... shall disown any regime, legislation or authority that violates democratic values, principles and guarantees or encroaches upon human rights".&lt;ref name="NBCmia"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/Maduro-Reports-of-Alleged-Military-Uprising-in-Venezuela-431196343.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_MIBrand|title=Maduro Says Helicopter Fired on Venezuela's Supreme Court|date=27 June 2017|work=NBC 6 South Florida|accessdate=28 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the helicopter was near the Supreme Court, gunfire was heard in the area.&lt;ref name="NBCmia" /&gt; President Maduro stated that a military rebellion had occurred while opposition officials said that the actions were staged so Maduro could justify a crackdown on those who oppose his government and the [[2017 Constituent National Assembly|constituent assembly]].&lt;ref name="NBCmia" /&gt;

=== National Guard barracks operation ===
On 18 December, Pérez successfully implemented "Operation Genesis", which resulted in the theft of 26 rifles and 3 automatic pistols from a command station of the National Guard in [[Los Teques]], [[Miranda (state)|Miranda state]]. The surprise attack resulted in no deaths, with Pérez and about 50 other rebels gagging and tying up the National Guardsmen, ridiculing them for supporting the Bolivarian Government, asking "Why do you continue to defend drug traffickers, some real terrorists? ... Be worthy of the uniform you are wearing, you are irresponsible, traitors to the country for not doing something". The group then destroyed images of President Maduro and [[Hugo Chávez]], Maduro's predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/noticias/sucesos/oscar-perez-atribuyo-robo-armas-cuartel-gnb_681565|title=Óscar Pérez se atribuyó robo de armas a cuartel de la GNB|last=|first=|date=19 December 2017|work=El Universal|access-date=15 January 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/noticias/sucesos/grupo-comando-robo-fusiles-una-comandancia-gnb-los-teques_681467|title=Grupo comando se robó 26 fusiles de una comandancia de la GNB en Los Teques|last=M.

President Maduro responded, stating "Wherever they appear, I have ordered the Armed Forces, '[[Bullet|Lead]] for the terrorist groups! Lead them, compadre!' ... zero tolerance with terrorist groups that threaten with weapons the peace of the Republic."

On 15 January 2018, the Venezuelan Army and the [[Venezuelan National Guard]] launched an operation after discovering the location of Pérez, who was held up in the El Junquito parish of [[Capital District, Venezuela|Capital District]].&lt;ref name="MHperez"/&gt; Around 4:00 AM [[Venezuela time|VST]] (8:00 AM UTC), about 500 troops were deployed to attack Pérez and his compatriots at their location.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://efectococuyo.com/efecto-cocuyo/investigacion-revela-lo-ocurrido-durante-las-ultimas-horas-de-oscar-perez/|title=Investigación revela lo ocurrido durante las últimas horas de Óscar Pérez|last=|first=|date=13 May 2018|work=[[Efecto Cocuyo]]|access-date=23 May 2018|language=es-VE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2018/05/13/nos-vamos-a-entregar-no-sigan-disparando-reconstruyendo-las-ultimas-horas-de-oscar-perez/|title="¡Nos vamos a entregar! ¡No sigan disparando!

[[Image:Feast of the Cross.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Russian icon]] of Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross ([[icon]] from [[Yaroslavl]] by Gury Nikitin, 1680. [[Tretyakov Gallery]], [[Moscow]]).]]
In the [[Christian]] [[liturgical calendar]], there are several different '''Feasts of the Cross''', all of which commemorate [[True Cross|the cross]] used in the [[crucifixion of Jesus]]. While [[Good Friday]] is dedicated to the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]] and the Crucifixion, these days celebrate the cross itself, as the instrument of [[salvation]].  The most common day of commemoration is September 14 in [[Roman Catholicism]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy]].

In [[English language|English]], it is called '''The Exaltation of the Holy Cross''' in the official translation of the [[Roman Missal]], while the 1973 translation called it '''The Triumph of the Cross'''. In some parts of the [[Anglican Communion]] the feast is called '''Holy Cross Day''', a name also used by [[Lutheran]]s. The celebration is also sometimes called '''Holy Rood Day'''.

==Tradition==
According to Christian tradition, the [[True Cross]] was discovered in 326 by [[Helena of Constantinople|Saint Helena]], the mother of the Roman Emperor [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine the Great]], during a [[pilgrimage]] she made to [[Jerusalem]]. The [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] was then built at the site of the discovery, by order of Helena and Constantine. The church was dedicated nine years later, with a portion of the cross. One-third remained in Jerusalem, one-third was brought to Rome and deposited in the Sessorian basilica Santa Croce in Gerusalemme (Holy Cross in Jerusalem), and one-third was taken to Constantinople to make the city impregnable.&lt;ref name=Marucchi&gt;[http://newadvent.org/cathen/04517a.htm Marucchi, Orazio. "Archæology of the Cross and Crucifix." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908&lt;/ref&gt;

The date of the feast marks the dedication of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in 335.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holysepulchre.custodia.org/default.asp?id=4078|title=The Era of Constantine|website=www.holysepulchre.custodia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a two-day festival: although the actual [[consecration]] of the church was on September 13, the cross itself was brought outside the church on September 14 so that the clergy and faithful could pray before the True Cross, and all could come forward to venerate it.

Red is the usual liturgical color in churches that follow such traditions. In Western Christianity, red [[vestments]] are worn at church services conducted on this day as well as Pentecost and other times of celebration. In the Roman Catholic liturgical observance, the red is worn only on this day, and if the day falls on a Sunday, its [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] readings&lt;ref group=note&gt;1st reading--Numbers 21:4b-9; responsory psalm--Psalm 78; 2nd reading--Phillipians 2:6-11; gospel reading--John 3:13-17.&lt;/ref&gt; are used instead of those for the occurring Sunday in [[Ordinary Time]]. The lectionaries of the [[Church of England]] (and other Anglican churches) and [[Western Rite Orthodoxy]] also stipulate red as the liturgical color for 'Holy Cross Day.'

In Eastern-Rite Orthodox Churches that use various liturgical colors, red vestments are also worn. Yet in these Orthodox churches, the wearing of red continues for a week after the feast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antiochian.org/midwest/liturgical-colors|title=Liturgical Colors - Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese|website=www.antiochian.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Western Rite Orthodoxy|Western Rite Orthodox Parishes]], the Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday of the calendar week after the one in which the feast day occurs, are designated as one of each year's four sets of [[Ember days]]. In new calendar Western Rite Orthodox Parishes (e.g. those under the Antiochian Diocese) these ember days are the week following 14 September. In old calendar Western Rite Orthodox Parishes (e.g. those under the Russian Diocese) these ember days are the week following 27 September.

Until 1969, these ember days were a part of the liturgical calendar of the Roman Catholic Church. Organization of these celebrations in the ordinary form is now left to the decision of [[episcopal conference]]s in view of local conditions and customs. The ember days are still observed in the calendar of the Roman Rite's "extraordinary form" and in the Anglican Ordinariate calendar.

September 14 is the titular feast of the [[Congregation of Holy Cross]], [[Companions of the Cross|The Companions of the Cross]] and the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]'s [[Order of the Holy Cross]].  This date also marked the beginning of the period of fasting, except on Sundays and ending on [[Easter]] Sunday, that was stipulated for Carmelites in the [[Carmelite Rule of St. Albert]] of 1247.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carmelites.ie/PDF/Rule.pdf|title=The Rule of Albert as approved by Innocent IV (1247)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Rule of St. Benedict]] also prescribes this day as the beginning of monastic winter (i.e., the period when there are three  nocturns of psalms and readings at [[matins]]) which also ends at Easter.

==History==
The Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, celebrated every year on September 14, recalls three events: the [[True Cross#Finding the True Cross|finding of the True Cross]] by Saint Helena, the mother of the emperor Constantine; the dedication of churches built by Constantine on the site of the Holy Sepulchre and Mount Calvary; and the restoration of the True Cross to Jerusalem in AD 629 by the Byzantine emperor [[Heraclius]] after it had fallen into the hands of the Persian emperor [[Khosrow II|Chosroes II]] in the AD 614 [[Sasanian conquest of Jerusalem]].Under emperor [[Constantine]], around 327, Macarius, Bishop of Jerusalem, caused excavations to be made in order to ascertain the location of Calvary as well as that of the Holy Sepulchre. It was in the course of these excavations that the wood of the Cross was recovered.&lt;ref name="socrates"&gt;{{cite web| title=Chapter XVII—The Emperor’s Mother Helena having come to Jerusalem, searches for and finds the Cross of Christ, and builds a Church| url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf202.ii.iv.xvii.html| series=Christian Classics Ethereal Library| work=Socrates and Sozomenus Ecclesiastical Histories of the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church| author=Socrates and Sozomenus; Philip Schaff, D.D., LL.D. and Henry Wace, D.D., ed.| publisher=Wm. B Eerdmans| location=Grand Rapids, MI| year=1984| isbn=0-8028-8116-5| accessdate=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was determined by Macarius to be authentic (the crosses of the Two Thieves were also recovered) and for it Constantine built the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre#Construction (4th century)|Basilica of the Holy Sepulchre]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Itinerarium Burdigalense|Pilgrim of Bordeaux]] reports in 333: "There, at present, by the command of the Emperor Constantine, has been built a basilica, that is to say, a church of wondrous beauty". ''Itinerarium Burdigalense'', p. 594&lt;/ref&gt;

The feast was observed in Rome before the end of the seventh century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/liturgicalyear/calendar/day.cfm?date=2014-09-14|title=Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross - September 14, 2014 - Liturgical Calendar|website=www.catholicculture.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Second Council of Nicæa of 787, drew the distinction between veneration of the cross and worship or ''latria'', "which, according to the teaching of the faith, belongs to the Divine nature alone." &lt;ref name=Cabrol&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04529a.htm Cabrol, Fernand. "The True Cross." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 14 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Petavius noted that this cult must be considered as not belonging to the substance of religion, but as being one of the things not absolutely necessary to salvation.&lt;ref name=Cabrol/&gt;

The honor paid to the image passes to the prototype; and he who adores the image, adores the person whom it represents.&lt;ref name=Cabrol/&gt;

In the [[Gallican Rite|Gallican]] usage, beginning about the seventh century, the ''Feast of the Cross'' was celebrated on May 3, and called "Crouchmas" (for "Cross Mass") or "[[Roodmas]]". When the Gallican and Roman practices were combined, the September date was assigned to commemorating the rescue of the Cross from the [[Sassanid]] Persians, and the May date was kept as the '''Finding of the Holy Cross''' or '''Invention of the True Cross''' to commemorate the finding. ("Invention" is a rendering of the [[Latin]] term ''inventio'' "discovery".) [[Pope John XXIII]] removed this feast in 1960, so that the [[General Roman Calendar]] now celebrates the Holy Cross only on September 14. However, some usus antiquior communities still observe a feast on May 3.

May 3 is the date given in the [[Church of England]]'s ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' liturgy, but the new ''[[Common Worship]]'' liturgy, following the Roman Catholic Church's lead, celebrates Holy Cross Day on September 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prayerbook.ca/resources/bcponline/calendar/|title=The Calendar|date=16 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feast day joined the western calendar in the 7th century A.D.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.franciscanmedia.org/exaltation-of-the-holy-cross/|title=Exaltation of the Holy Cross|date=2016-09-14|work=Franciscan Media|access-date=2018-09-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syriac Church of the East==
The [[Syriac Church of the East]] celebrates the finding of the Cross on September 13, and considers it to be a major feast.  The Syriac Church considers the [[Sign of the Cross]] to be a seventh sacrament, by which all of the other sacraments are sealed and perfected (it takes the place of marriage, which they do not name in their traditional list of sacraments). Saranaya (Syriac) hold a ''shara'' every year in cities like Chicago, Illinois, and Modesto, California, and other parts of the world. The ''shara'' in Modesto is held every Sunday prior to September 13 at East La Loma Park, where they sacrifice lambs in remembrance of the Feast Of the Cross. People gather and feast and sing and dance to celebrate a happy day.

==Eastern Orthodox practice==
[[File:Orthodox Cross--Universal Exaltation of the Precious and Life Giving Cross.jpg|thumb|Orthodox Cross set for special veneration on the feast of ''The Universal Exaltation of the Precious and Life Giving Cross.'']]
In [[Byzantine Rite|Byzantine]] liturgical observance, the '''Universal Exaltation (also called Elevation in Greek Churches) of the Precious and Life-creating Cross''' commemorates both the finding of the True Cross in 326 and its recovery from the Persians in 628, and is one of the [[Great Feasts|Twelve Great Feasts]] of the church year. September 14 is always a [[Eastern Orthodoxy#Fasting|fast day]] and the eating of meat, dairy products and fish is prohibited. The Feast of the Exaltation has a one-day [[forefeast]] and an eight-day [[afterfeast]]. The Saturday and Sunday before&lt;ref group=note&gt;''Saturday Before'': I Corin.  2:6-9 &amp; Matthew 10:37-11:1; ''Sunday Before'': Galatians 6:11-16 &amp; John 3:13-17&lt;/ref&gt; and after&lt;ref&gt;''Saturday After'': I Corin. 1:26-2:5 &amp; John 8:21-30; ''Sunday After'': Galatians 2:16-20 &amp; Mark 8:34-9:1&lt;/ref&gt;  September 14 are also commemorated with special Epistle and Gospel readings&lt;ref group=note&gt;I Corin. 1:18-24 &amp; John 19:6-11, 13-20, 25-28, 30-35 (John's Passion account)&lt;/ref&gt; about the Cross at the [[Divine Liturgy]].

On the eve of the feast before small [[vespers]] the priest, having prepared a tray with the cross placed on a bed of fresh [[basil]] leaves or flowers, covered with an [[aër]] (liturgical veil), places it on the [[Prothesis (altar)|table of prothesis]]; after that service, the priest carries the tray on his head preceded by lighted candles and the deacon incensing the cross, processes to the [[Altar|holy table (altar)]], in the centre whereof he lays the tray, in the place of the [[Gospel Book]], the latter being set upright at the back of the altar.&lt;ref name=Festal_Menaion&gt;{{Citation

The cross remains in the centre of the temple throughout the afterfeast, and the faithful venerate it whenever they enter or leave the church. Finally, on the leave-taking (''apodosis'') of the feast, the priest and deacon will incense around the cross, there will be a final veneration of the cross, and then they will solemnly bring the cross back into the sanctuary through the [[Holy Doors]]. This same pattern of bringing out the cross, veneration, and returning the cross at the end of the celebration is repeated at a number of the lesser times.

===Uncovering of the Precious Cross and the Precious Nails by Empress Saint Helen===
On March 6, the liturgical calendar of the Eastern Orthodox Church, commemorates the ''Uncovering of the Precious Cross and the Precious Nails by Empress Saint Helen''&amp;mdash;that is to say, the anniversary of the actual discovery; the date for the September 14 feast was determined by the consecration of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. This is a lesser feast, and does not have any of the liturgical peculiarities of the September 14 feast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsViewer.asp?FSID=100680|title=Uncovering of the Precious Cross and the Precious Nails by the Empress St Helen in Jerusalem|last=|first=|date=|website=ORTHODOX CHURCH in AMERICA|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Armenian Apostolic Church==
The [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] observes a five-day fast, called the '''Fast of the Holy Cross''' from September 10 through September 14, in preparation for the '''Feast of the Holy Church in view of the Holy Cross''', which they celebrate on September 15. September 16 is observed as the '''Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross''' (''Khachverats'' in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]), a feast which continues for several days thereafter. It is counted as one of the five major feasts of the Armenian Church, and the most important of the four feasts of the Holy Cross.  According to Armenian [[Sacred Tradition|tradition]], the first one to "exalt" the Cross was the Apostle [[James of Jerusalem]], the "Brother of the Lord".  On the Sunday nearest September 14, the liturgy is marked with an ''antasdan'' service (blessing of the fields) during which the [[processional cross]] is adorned with basil (a symbol of royalty) and the four corners of the church are blessed as a sign of the sanctification of the world.

On the Sunday nearest September 28 (always two weeks after the Exaltation) the Armenian Church celebrates the [[Varagavank|Feast of the Holy Cross of Varak]] (''Varaka Khach'') commemorating the third century placement of an authentic relic of the cross in Armenian soil at [[Varagavank]]. This is a cross feast unique to the Armenian Church.

On the Sunday closest to October 26, the Armenian Church celebrates the '''Discovery of the Holy Cross''' (''Kyood Khach''), commemorating the finding of the True Cross by Saint Helena (327 AD).

== Ethiopian-Eritrean  Orthodox Tewahedo &amp; Protestant Christian Churches ==
The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]], the [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] (along with [[P'ent'ay|Protestant Ethio-Eritreans]]) and the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church of Alexandria]], commemorate the finding of the true cross on Meskerem 17 of the Ethiopian Calendar (17 Thoout in the [[Coptic calendar]]) corresponding to September 27 in the [[Julian calendar]] (or, in leap years, one day later). The eve of this day is popularly called "Demera" in Amharic - meaning Bonfire. The patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church lights a large bonfire in Maskal Square, [[Addis Ababa]]'s greatest open arena, and smaller bonfires are lit by individuals and local parishes throughout the country. Thousands attend the colourful and vibrant ceremony of religious chantings around the bonfire in Maskal Square, which owes its name to the ceremony, ''maskal'' meaning in [[Ge'ez]] "cross". According to tradition, the bonfire commemorates how Queen Helena, as legend has it, found with the smoke of a bonfire, where to search for the true cross in Jerusalem, or how, by a series of bonfires, she signalled to her son Constantine in Constantinople her success in finding it.

==Malankara Syrian Orthodox Church==
In the [[Malankara Syrian Orthodox Church]] a special offering called ''panchasarayumanda'' is made on this day, in particular at the [[Akaparambu]] [http://sor.cua.edu/ChMon/Ankamaly/AkaparambuMSaborAphroth.html Mor Sabor-Mor Aphroth Church] in the [[Ernakulam]] District, [[Kerala]].

==Russian Orthodox Church==
In the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], October 12 is the commemoration of the '''Translation of a Portion of the Life-Giving Cross from Malta to Gatchina'''.
&lt;!-- REQUIRES AUTHORIZATION *[http://subdeaconchristianjohn.spaces.live.com/photos/cns!D39B32AEA6869A7F!2067/cns!D39B32AEA6869A7F!2074 Photo of Relic]--&gt;A portion of the Life-Giving Cross of the Lord, as well as the ''Philermos'' icon of the [[Mother of God]] and the right hand of [[John the Baptist]] were preserved on the island of [[Malta]] by the Knights of the Catholic [[Order of St. John of Jerusalem]], who controlled the island.

In 1798, when the French seized the island, the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Maltese Knights]] turned to the [[Russian Empire]] for defense and protection. To this end, they elected [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]], the [[Tsar]] of Russia, as [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] of the Order. The Tsar accepted his election. On October 12, 1799, Maltese knights came to their new [[Priory Palace]], just built for them by Paul in [[Gatchina]] (45&amp;nbsp; km. [27 miles] south of [[Saint Petersburg|St.&amp;nbsp; Petersburg]]), and offered these ancient and holy treasures to their new Grand Master, the tsar.

In the autumn of 1799 the holy items were transferred to St. Petersburg and placed in the [[Winter Palace]] within the internal church dedicated to the Icon of the Savior Not-Made-by-Hands. The feast for this event was established in 1800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oca.org/FSLivesAllSaintsPrint.asp?M=10&amp;D=12|title=Lives of all saints commemorated on October 12|website=www.oca.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==August 1==&lt;!--[[Procession of the Cross]] and [[Feast of the Procession of the Cross]] redirect here--&gt;
The Eastern Orthodox and [[Byzantine Rite]] Catholics commemorate the '''[[August 1 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|Procession of the Precious Wood of the Life-giving Cross of Jesus Christ]]''' on August 1, which is also the first day of the [[Dormition Fast]]. The [[proper (liturgy)|propers]] of the feast are combined with those of the [[Maccabees|Holy Maccabean Martyrs]], the commemoration of whose endurance is deemed appropriate for the first day of a fast.  Unlike the September 14 observance, this commemoration is considered to be a minor feast, but it does have the bringing out of the cross and veneration by the faithful like the September feast.

The history of this feast begins in [[Constantinople]] where it was the custom to carry the [[relic]] of the [[True Cross]] through the streets and squares of the city to ask for God's blessing and for relief from sickness.  On the eve of the feast (July 31), observed as a forefeast, it was taken out of the imperial treasury, and laid upon the altar of the "Great Church" ([[Hagia Sophia]]) and the following day solemnly placed in the middle of the Great Church for the faithful to venerate. It was taken in procession daily throughout the city, offering it to the people to [[veneration|venerate]], until the Feast of the [[Dormition of the Theotokos]] (August 15), when it was returned to the imperial treasury.

In commemoration of this tradition, it is customary to have an [[Procession#Outdoors|outdoor procession]] with the ''[[Holy water in Eastern Christianity|Lesser Blessing of Water]]'' on August 1. It is the first of three "Feasts of the Saviour" in the month of August, the other two being the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]] (August 6) and the [[Icon]] of Christ "[[Not Made by Hands]]" (August 16). Because of the blessing of [[holy water]], this [[Liturgical year|holy day]] is sometimes called "Saviour of the Water." There may also be celebrated on this day the ''Rite of Blessing New Honey'', for which reason the day is also referred to as "Saviour of the Honey."

According to Saint [[Nikolaj Velimirović]], this feast was instituted by mutual agreement of the Greeks and Russians to commemorate the simultaneous victories of the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Manuel I Komnenos]] over the [[Bulgaria]]ns and the Russian Prince [[Andrei Bogolyubsky]] over the [[Saracen]]s in the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Moveable Feasts==&lt;!-- [[Sunday of the Cross]] and [[Sunday of the Veneration of the Cross]] redirect here --&gt;
In addition to celebrations on fixed days, the Cross may be celebrated during the [[moveable feast|variable]], particularly in Lent and Eastertide.

Eastern Christians celebrate an additional '''Veneration of the Cross''' on the third Sunday of [[Great Lent]]. The services for this day are modeled on the Feast of the Exaltation (September 14), and include bringing the cross to the holy table at little vespers and with solemnity out into the center of church at matins, albeit without the ceremony of the [[#Eastern Orthodox practice|Exaltation of the Cross]], for veneration by the faithful.&lt;ref name=Typikon&gt;{{Citation|year=1907 |title=Тѵпико́нъ сіесть уста́въ (Title here transliterated into Russian; actually in Church Slavonic) (The Typicon which is the Order), Chapter 49 |publisher=Сѵнодальная тѵпографія (The Synodal Printing House) |publication-place=Москва (Moscow, Russian Empire)|url=http://www.orthlib.info/Typikon/T49.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains in the centre of the church for nearly a week (the Fourth Week of Great Lent). On the Monday and Wednesday of that week, a veneration of the Cross takes place at the [[Prime (liturgy)|First Hour]] (repeating a portion of the service from matins of the previous Sunday). On Friday of that week, the veneration takes place after the [[Ninth Hour]], after which the priest and deacons return the cross to the sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsViewer.asp?SID=4&amp;ID=1&amp;FSID=14|title=Lives of the Saints|website=ocafs.oca.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orthodox Churches, the Roman Catholic Church, and some Anglican churches have a formal '''Adoration of the Cross''' during the services on Good Friday.

In the [[Roman Breviary]] before the 1961 reform, a '''Commemoration of the Cross''' is made during [[Eastertide]] except when the office or commemoration of a double or octave occurs, replacing the [[suffrage]] of the Saints said outside Eastertide.

==Wednesday and Friday==
In addition to all of the above commemorations, Orthodox also hold Wednesday and Friday throughout the year as a commemoration of the Cross.

==Veneration of the Cross==

===Feast Days===
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], on several of the feast days mentioned above, there is a public veneration of the cross. It may take place at matins, after the cross is brought out, at the end of the celebration of the Divine Liturgy, or at the end of one of the [[Little Hours]], depending upon the particular feast and local custom.

The faithful come forward and make two [[poklon|prostrations]], make the sign of the cross on themselves, and kiss the feet of Christ on the cross, and then make a third prostration. After this, they will often receive a blessing from the priest and bow towards their fellow worshippers on each side of the church (this latter practice is most commonly observed in [[monastery|monasteries]]).

===End of Services===
At the end of the Divine Liturgy, and at some other services as well, it is customary for the faithful to come forward and venerate the "Blessing Cross" (hand-cross) which is held by the [[bishop]] or [[priest]], and to kiss his hand.  This practice is also called the "Veneration of the Cross", though it does not involve making prostrations.  The cross which is venerated is small (typically 10-16&amp;nbsp;inches).  This cross is usually metal, often [[gold]] or [[plating|gold-plated]], and can be [[Vitreous enamel|enameled]] or decorated with [[Gemstone|jewels]].  The figure of Jesus on the Cross (the ''soma'') is usually engraved, enameled, or painted on the cross, rather than being a separate three-dimensional figure as is found on a [[crucifix]]. This is due to the Orthodox practice of using [[icons]] rather than statues in church.

==Exaltation of the Holy Cross==
The readings for this day draw a comparison between the bronze serpent of Numbers 21, which was raised up on a pole so that all who looked upon it would be cured of the deadly poison of venomous snakes, and John 3: 14-15, "And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2014/09/14/pope_homily_for_feast_of_the_exaltation_of_the_holy_cross/1106518|title=Pope Francis: Homily for Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Geoffory Coomans contribuables.jpg|thumb|[[Geoffroy Coomans de Brachène]] holding the street sign ''Rue des contribuables/Belastingsbetalers street'' (taxpayers' street) in Brussels]]
'''''{{lang|fr|Tout ça (ne nous rendra pas la Belgique)}}''''' or '''Bye Bye Belgium''', also called '''"The Flemish Secession Hoax,"''' was a [[hoax]] perpetrated by the [[French Community of Belgium|French-language]] [[Belgian]] public TV station [[RTBF]] on Wednesday, December 13, 2006.  Regular programming on the channel ''[[La Une]]'' was interrupted for a news bulletin claiming that the [[Flemish parliament]] had issued a unilateral [[declaration of independence]] from the Kingdom of Belgium, mimicking the [[Belgian independence|Belgian secession from the Netherlands]] some 175 years earlier.

Interviews with prominent Belgian politicians (some of whom had been informed about the hoax) as well as staged footage of the [[emergency evacuation|evacuation]] of the [[Monarchy of Belgium|royal family]] as well as cheering crowds holding the [[Flag of Flanders]] were included so as to add credence to the news report. 

The broadcast of the report led to widespread alarm and consternation in French-speaking Belgium. A hotline set up by the station was swamped by 2,600 calls, whilst RTBF's website crashed. Thirty minutes into the broadcast, on demand of the media minister of the French-speaking community in Belgium, {{Interlanguage link multi|Fadila Laanan|fr}}, an on-screen message identified it as a fiction. 

The hoax was the creation of the journalist {{Interlanguage link multi|Philippe Dutilleul|fr}} and had been prepared over a period of 2 years under the [[codename]] ''BBB'' for ''Bye-bye Belgium''. Its goal was to show Belgians the intensity of the country's issue, and the real possibility of [[Partition of Belgium|a split of Belgium]]. In the years coming to the hoax there was rising Flemish separatism and the [[Vlaams Belang]] party received strong support in the regional elections.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6178671.stm&lt;/ref&gt; The hoax almost became reality in 2007 after a [[2007–11 Belgian political crisis|major political crisis]] drove many to believe that the country's division was almost certain.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/blogs/certainideasofeurope/2007/09/half_the_flemish_want_to_split&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent Belgian politicians, including [[Prime Minister of Belgium|Prime Minister]] [[Guy Verhofstadt]], [[List of Ministers-President of Flanders|Flemish Minister-President]] [[Yves Leterme]] and [[List of Ministers-President of the Walloon Region|Walloon Minister-President]] [[Elio Di Rupo]], condemned the report as "irresponsible." International reaction included an angry statement by [[Jean-Claude Juncker]], [[List of Prime Ministers of Luxembourg|Prime Minister]] of [[Luxembourg]], who said, "This is not the kind of issue you play around with."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/12/14/europe/EU_GEN_Belgium_Independence_Hoax.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312200412/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/12/14/europe/EU_GEN_Belgium_Independence_Hoax.php|title=Belgian viewers fall for TV hoax announcing breakaway state|archivedate=12 March 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fórum Internacional do Software Livre''' ('''FISL''') ('''International Free Software Forum''') is an event sponsored by [[Associação Software Livre.Org]] (Free Software Association), a Brazilian [[NGO]] that, among other goals, seeks the promotion and adoption of [[free software]]. It takes place every year in [[Porto Alegre]], the capital of [[Rio Grande Do Sul]], the southernmost state of [[Brazil]].

The event is meant as a "get-together" of [[student]]s, [[researcher]]s, [[social movements]] for [[freedom of information]], [[entrepreneur]]s, [[Information Technology]] (IT) enterprises, governments, and other interested people. It is considered one of the world´s largest free software events, harboring technical, political and social debates in an integrated way. It gathers discussions, speeches, personalities and novelties both national and international in the free software world.

==Event history==

On 30 July 1999, a group of [[public servant]]s, professors, students and members of the academic community, members of [[user group]]s and other interested people, joined efforts to start the ''PSL-RS'' (''Free Software Project of Rio Grande do Sul'').

The project's goals were:

* To set up a network of labs in companies and universities devoted to the study of [[Linux]] and other free software;
* To build a consortium to publish books and manuals about Free Software, Free Programming languages and such;
* To massively promote free software.

After lots of difficulties and delays, the first FISL happened on 4–5 May 2000 in the Noble Hall of [[UFRGS]] (Rio Grande do Sul' Federal University). The event was attended by 2,120 people, which also had the first WSL (Free Software Workshop) with 19 works presented during the event.

Among others, the first FISL had such notable attendees as [[Richard Stallman]], writer of the "GNU Manifesto" and Founder of the [[Free Software Foundation]].

Since then, the event has grown considerably in terms of visibility, influence and number of attendees.

[[File:Brazil FISL presentation.pdf|thumb|Presentation at 12th free &amp; open source software conference in [[Porto Alegre, Brazil]]. Presented June 30, 2011]]

The 12th edition of the International Free Software Forum happened from June, 29 to July, 2, in 2011 and the main subject was "Net Neutrality", because it is believed that content must be equally accessible to every person with no interferences in online traffic. Following this edition´s subject, a contest for choosing the event´s logomark to be used in fisl´s graphic work was carried out. Raphael Greque´s work was chosen in an election between ASL´s associates. Freedom as a subject also was present between various discussions, in an effort to contribute to technological and socio-cultural evolution of the country. It also aimed at offering to participants the opportunity to get updated in free software usage in many different areas. The event also offered attendance in many speeches and workshops in areas such as mobility, free software in education, robotics, free networks, free culture, digital inclusion and women in IT.

Representatives of both RS and national public sector attend fisl every year, and strengthen their commitment to free software. Hence the participation of the then Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, in 2009. In this edition, fisl hosted the presence of the Minister of Science and Technology Aloisio Mercadante, the RS Governor Tarso Genro and the Porto Alegre Mayor José fortunati, the President of the Federal Data Processing Service, Marcos Mazoni, the Manager of Technical Innovations of the Ministry of Planning Corinto Meffe, the Secretary of Logistics and IT of the MInistry of PLanning, Delfino Natal de Souza, the President of the RS Data Processing Company (Procergs), Carlson Aquistapasse, the President of the Data Processing Company of Porto Alegre, (Procempa), André Imar Kulczynski, federal deputies Paulo Pimenta e Manuela D'Avila, besides other authorities.

Public Hearing – the Minister of Science and Technology, Aloisio Mercadante participated in a public hearing with fisl´ organizers, people from the Hacker Transparency movement, developers from Ubuntu, Debian, Slackware and ODF among other groups, talking about how hackers can help increase government´s transparency and technological development.

===FISL 11===

This editions happened from 21 to 24 July 2010. It hosted a total of 7.511 participants [2] which circulated between the Free Solutions and Business Fair and fisl itself, attending speeches, workshops and debates. fisl11 developed more than 500 activities, overcoming all previous editions. Innovation began with speech selection, which relied on the participation of registered people in order to choose them. This was also the first edition with translation to libras (Brazilian language of signals, aimed at the hearing-impaired). The activities of the Free Culture Festival received a larger room, in an effort to broaden debates about knowledge sharing also in other areas of activity. Besides the record number of participants, 84 people helped build the largest free software event in Latin America together with organization teams. The presence of the traditional Convoys and Users Groups from various parts of Brazil and abroad confirmed the success, year after year. Up to the last day of the Forum, fisl11´ website had more than 2 million pageviews. Specialists in free software gave lectures in fisl11 such as [[Linux International]] Jon "maddog" Hall, developer Jon Phillips, Mozilla Foundation executive director Mark Shurman and GIT specialist Scott Chacon. &lt;ref name="softwarelivre.org"&gt;http://softwarelivre.org/fisl10/{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
===FISL 10===

This edition happened from 24 to 27, June, 2009, with names such as Jon "maddog" Hall, Peter Sunde, creator of the famous torrent sharing site The Pirate Bay. with 8232 registered participants, it was the largest edition ever [3]. The picture of President Lula hugging Peter Sunde shot by Mariel Zasso walked around all blogosphere.[4] &lt;ref name="softwarelivre.org"/&gt;

OBS: In this year the event´s name in form of versions was abandoned, and a normal running number scheme was adopted.

===FISL 9.0===

The 2008 edition had more than 7417 registered people coming from 21 countries[5]. It became acknowledged by the presence of companies such as Sun Microsystems, Google and Intel and of personalities such as Linux International´ Jon "maddog" Hall and Louis Suarez-Potts from OpenOffice.org. The event was carried on at the [[PUCRS]] Convention Center ([[PUCRS]]).

===FISL 8.0===

The 2007 edition hosted the presence of companies such as Sun Microsystems, IBM and Intel and people like Jon "maddog" Hall from Linux International, X.Org´s Keith Packard, Sun´s Simon Phipps and Louis Suarez-Potts from OpenOffice.org. It harboured 5363 participants[6]. The event happened at [[FIERGS]] Convention Center. 19 mobilizing activities to fisl 8.0 were carried on, among free software events, speeches, promotions, courses and institutional visits, between various Brazilian cities.

Among the outstanding attractions it may be quoted the participation of the educational coordinator from OLPC (One Laptop per Child) at the UFRGS Laboratory of Cognitive Studies Léa Fagundes, who introduced a prototype of the laptop developed for public school children. Paul Singer National Secretary of Solidarity Economy at the Ministry of Work and Employment and Edgar Piccino, from the Institute of IT, cabinet of the President of the Republic made a speech based on parallels between solidarity economy the development model of free software.

Bush declared his candidacy for the [[Texas gubernatorial election, 1994|1994 Texas gubernatorial election]] at the same time that his brother Jeb [[Florida gubernatorial election, 1994|sought the governorship of Florida]]. His campaign focused on four themes: welfare reform, [[tort reform]], crime reduction, and education improvement.&lt;ref name=msn/&gt; Bush's campaign advisers were [[Karen Hughes]], [[Joe Allbaugh]], and [[Karl Rove]].&lt;ref name="SlaterBrain"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wayne Slater |first=James Moore |year=2003 |title=Bush's Brain: How Karl Rove Made George W.

Incumbent Democratic president [[Bill Clinton]] was completing his second and final term, and the field for nomination for President of both parties was wide open. Bush was the Governor of Texas in June 1999 when he announced his candidacy for President of the United States. He entered a large field of hopefuls for the Republican Party presidential nomination that included [[John McCain]], [[Alan Keyes]], [[Steve Forbes]], [[Gary Bauer]], [[Orrin Hatch]], [[Elizabeth Dole]], [[Dan Quayle]], [[Pat Buchanan]], [[Lamar Alexander]], [[John Kasich]], and [[Bob Smith (American politician)|Bob Smith]].

Bush portrayed himself as a [[compassionate conservatism|compassionate conservative]], implying he was more centrist than other Republicans. He campaigned on a platform that included bringing integrity and honor back to the White House, increasing the size of the [[United States Armed Forces]], cutting taxes, improving education, and aiding minorities.&lt;ref name=msn/&gt; By early 2000, the race had centered on Bush and McCain.&lt;ref name=msn/&gt;

Bush won the [[Iowa caucuses]], and although he was heavily favored to win the [[New Hampshire primary]], he trailed McCain by 19&amp;nbsp;percent and lost that primary. Despite this, Bush regained momentum, and according to political observers, he effectively became the front runner after the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2000|South Carolina primary]]—which according to ''[[The Boston Globe]]''—made history for his campaign's negativity. ''[[The New York Times]]'' described it as a [[smear campaign]].&lt;ref name=anatomy&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/03/21/the_anatomy_of_a_smear_campaign/ |title=The anatomy of a smear campaign |work=Boston Globe |last=Davis |first=Richard H. |date=March 21, 2004 |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515081611/http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/03/21/the_anatomy_of_a_smear_campaign/ |archivedate=May 15, 2006 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hook |first1=Janet |author2=Michael Finnegan |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/mar/17/nation/na-mccain17 |title=McCain loses some of his rebel edge |work=Los Angeles Times |date=March 17, 2007 |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |archivedate=May 15, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515081611/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/mar/17/nation/na-mccain17 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/us/politics/19mccain.html |title=Confronting Ghosts of 2000 in South Carolina |work=The New York Times |date=October 19, 2007 |accessdate=April 14, 2013 |last=Steinhauer |first=Jennifer |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209070019/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/us/politics/19mccain.html |archivedate=December 9, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 25, 2000, Bush surprised some observers when he selected [[Dick Cheney]]—a former [[White House Chief of Staff]], [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]], and [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]—to be his [[running mate]]. At the time, Cheney was serving as head of Bush's vice presidential search committee. Soon after at the [[2000 Republican National Convention]], Bush and Cheney were officially nominated by the Republican Party.

Bush continued to campaign across the country and touted his record as Governor of Texas.&lt;ref name=msn/&gt; During his campaign, Bush criticized his Democratic opponent, incumbent Vice President [[Al Gore]], over [[Gun law in the United States|gun control]] and taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Sack, Kevin |author2=Toner, Robin |date=August 13, 2000 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/13/us/2000-campaign-record-congress-gore-selected-issues-ready-for-prime-time.html |title=The 2000 Campaign: The Record; In Congress, Gore Selected Issues Ready for Prime Time |work=The New York Times |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |archivedate=May 15, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515081611/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/13/us/2000-campaign-record-congress-gore-selected-issues-ready-for-prime-time.html |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the election returns were tallied on November 7, Bush had won 29 states, including Florida. The closeness of the Florida outcome led to a [[United States presidential election in Florida, 2000|recount]].&lt;ref name="msn"/&gt; The initial recount also went to Bush, but the outcome was tied up in lower courts for a month until eventually reaching the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-949.ZPC.html George W.

The Bush campaign advertised across the U.S. against Democratic candidates, including Bush's emerging opponent, Massachusetts Senator [[John Kerry]]. Kerry and other Democrats attacked Bush on the [[Iraq War]], and accused him of failing to stimulate the economy and job growth. The Bush campaign portrayed Kerry as a staunch [[liberalism in the United States|liberal]] who would raise taxes and increase the size of government. The Bush campaign continuously criticized Kerry's seemingly contradictory statements on the war in Iraq,&lt;ref name=msn/&gt; and argued that Kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the War on Terror.

In the election, Bush carried 31 of 50 states, receiving a total of 286 [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]]. He won an absolute majority of the popular vote (50.7&amp;nbsp;percent to his opponent's 48.3&amp;nbsp;percent).&lt;ref name="16 years"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/nov/04/uselections2004.usa16 |title=And now... four more years |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |date=November 4, 2004 |work=The Guardian |location=London |first=Julian |last=Borger |archivedate=May 15, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515081611/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/nov/04/uselections2004.usa16 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush's father George H.W.

Additionally, it was the first time since [[Herbert Hoover]]'s [[United States presidential election, 1928|election in 1928]] that a Republican president was elected alongside re-elected Republican majorities in both Houses of Congress.

Funding for the NIH was cut in 2006, the first such cut in 36 years, due to rising inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=President Bush and House Republicans Undermine Life Saving Health Research |publisher=United States House of Representatives |date=September 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:No Child Left Behind Act.jpg|thumb|President Bush signing the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] into law, January 8, 2002]]
One of the administration's early major initiatives was the [[No Child Left Behind Act]], which aimed to measure and close the gap between rich and poor student performance, provide options to parents with students in low-performing schools, and target more federal funding to low-income schools. This landmark education initiative passed with broad bipartisan support, including that of Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] of [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/no_child_left_behind_act/index.html |date=March 16, 2010 |accessdate=September 26, 2010 |first=Sam |last=Dillon |title=No Child Left Behind Act |archivedate=October 6, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006034714/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/no_child_left_behind_act/index.html |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was signed into law by Bush in early 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/01/20020108-1.html |title=President Signs Landmark No Child Left Behind Education Bill |date=January 8, 2002 |publisher=The White House |accessdate=May 5, 2008 |archivedate=October 6, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006034714/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/01/20020108-1.html |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many contend that the initiative has been successful, as cited by the fact that students in the U.S. have performed significantly better on state reading and math tests since Bush signed "No Child Left Behind" into law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/05/AR2007060502684.html |title=Scores Up Since 'No Child' Was Signed |accessdate=May 30, 2008 |date=June 6, 2007 |work=The Washington Post |author=Paley, Amit R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics argue that it is underfunded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=W.

After being re-elected, Bush signed into law a [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] drug benefit program that, according to [[Jan Crawford]], resulted in "the greatest expansion in America's [[welfare state]] in forty years;" the bill's costs approached $7&amp;nbsp;trillion.&lt;ref&gt;Greenburg, Jan Crawford, Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story of the Struggle for Control of the United States Supreme Court, 2007, Penguin Books, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Bush opposed and vetoed [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] (SCHIP) legislation, which was added by the Democrats onto a war funding bill and passed by Congress. The SCHIP legislation would have significantly expanded federally funded health care benefits and plans to children of some low-income families from about six&amp;nbsp;million to ten&amp;nbsp;million children. It was to be funded by an increase in the cigarette tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Michael Abramowitz |author2=Jonathan Weisman |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/03/AR2007100300116_pf.html |title=Bush Vetoes Health Measure |work=The Washington Post |date=October 4, 2007 |accessdate=October 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush viewed the legislation as a move toward [[socialized health care]], and asserted that the program could benefit families making as much as $83,000 per year who did not need the help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=October 4, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/04/washington/04bush.html |title=Bush Vetoes Child Health Bill Privately |work=The New York Times |accessdate=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social services and Social Security====
Following Republican efforts to pass the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act|Medicare Act of 2003]], Bush signed the bill, which included major changes to the [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] program by providing beneficiaries with some assistance in paying for prescription drugs, while relying on private insurance for the delivery of benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncpssm.org/pdf/PL108summary.pdf |title=Summary of Medicare Act of 2003 |accessdate=August 20, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724191249/http://www.ncpssm.org/pdf/PL108summary.pdf |archive-date=July 24, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The retired persons lobby group [[AARP]] worked with the Bush Administration on the program and gave their endorsement.

[[File:President George W. Bush discussing Social Security.jpg|thumb|left|President Bush discussing Social Security reform at the Lake Nona YMCA Family Center in Orlando, Florida, March 18, 2005]]

Bush made it the centerpiece of his domestic agenda despite opposition from some in the U.S. Congress.&lt;ref name="ss-msnbc"/&gt; In his [[2005 State of the Union Address]], Bush discussed the potential impending bankruptcy of the program and outlined his new program, which included partial privatization of the system, personal Social Security accounts, and options to permit Americans to divert a portion of their Social Security tax ([[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|FICA]]) into secured investments.&lt;ref name="ss-msnbc"/&gt; Democrats opposed the proposal to partially privatize the system.&lt;ref name="ss-msnbc"/&gt;

Bush embarked on a 60-day national tour, campaigning for his initiative in media events known as "Conversations on Social Security", in an attempt to gain public support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A28120-2005Mar11.html |title=Social Security: On With the Show |author1=Jim VandeHei |author2=Peter Baker |date=February 12, 2005 |newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, public support for the proposal declined&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=April 28, 2005 |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/f944a850-b830-11d9-bc7c-00000e2511c8,_i_rssPage=80fdaff6-cbe5-11d7-81c6-0820abe49a01.html |title=Bush shifts approach on Social Security reform |accessdate=September 9, 2007 |newspaper=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the House Republican leadership decided not to put Social Security reform on the priority list for the remainder of their 2005 legislative agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thehill.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/060105/social.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051205090810/http://thehill.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/060105/social.html |archivedate=December 5, 2005 |title=Social Security in Limbo |work=The Hill |date=June 1, 2005 |author=Patrick O'Connor |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal's legislative prospects were further diminished by the fall of 2005 political fallout from [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hurricane dims Bush's hopes on Social Security |date=September 22, 2005 |last=Yeager |first=Holly |url=http://news.ft.com/cms/s/00d6ee20-2b9f-11da-995a-00000e2511c8.html |accessdate=September 9, 2007 |work=Financial Times |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050923024100/http://news.ft.com/cms/s/00d6ee20-2b9f-11da-995a-00000e2511c8.html |archivedate=September 23, 2005 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Democrats gained control of both houses of Congress as a result of the [[United States Senate elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]], there was no prospect of further congressional action on the Bush proposal for the remainder of his term in office.

====Environmental policies====
{{Main|Domestic policy of the George W. Bush administration#Environment}}
Upon taking office in 2001, Bush stated his opposition to the [[Kyoto Protocol]], an amendment to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] which seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducing [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, citing that the treaty exempted 80&amp;nbsp;percent of the world's population&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=March 13, 2001 |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/03/20010314.html |title=Letter from the President to Senators Hagel, Helms, Craig, and Roberts |publisher=Office of the Press Secretary |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507053351/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/03/20010314.html |deadurl=yes |archivedate=May 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and would have cost tens of billions of dollars per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/kyoto/economic.htm |title=Summary of the Kyoto Report&amp;nbsp;– Assessment of Economic Impacts |publisher=Energy Information Administration |date=July 16, 2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523060852/http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/kyoto/economic.htm |deadurl=yes |archivedate=May 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also cited that the Senate had voted 95–0 in 1997 on a resolution expressing its disapproval of the protocol.

In May 2001, Bush signed an [[executive order]] to create an interagency task force to streamline energy projects,&lt;ref name=eo13212&gt;Bush, George W.

In 2002, Bush announced the [[Clear Skies Act of 2003]],&lt;ref name="EXsummary"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/02/clearskies.html |title=Executive Summary&amp;nbsp;– The Clear Skies Initiative |publisher=The White House |date=February 14, 2002 |accessdate=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aimed at amending the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] to reduce air pollution through the use of [[emissions trading]] programs.

Later in 2006, Bush declared the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands]] a national monument, creating the largest [[marine reserve]] to date. The [[Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument]] comprises 84&amp;nbsp;million acres (340,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and is home to 7,000 species of fish, birds, and other marine animals, many of which are specific to only those islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13300363/ |title=Bush creates world's biggest ocean preserve |date=June 16, 2006 |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108120830/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13300363/ |archivedate=November 8, 2012 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was hailed by conservationists for "its foresight and leadership in protecting this incredible area".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.org/initiatives/marine/press/press2489.html |title=The Nature Conservancy Applauds President Bush for Creating World's Largest Marine Conservation Area in Hawaii |date=June 16, 2006 |publisher=[[The Nature Conservancy]] |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |archivedate=November 28, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081128101124/http://www.nature.org/initiatives/marine/press/press2489.html |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush said, "This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U.S. Congress."&lt;ref name="drilling-cnn"/&gt; Bush had said in June 2008, "In the long run, the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies. My administration has worked with Congress to invest in gas-saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen [[fuel cell]]s... In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil. And that means we need to increase supply, especially here at home.

In his [[2008 State of the Union Address]], Bush announced that the U.S. would commit $2&amp;nbsp;billion over the next three years to a new international fund to promote clean energy technologies and fight climate change, saying, "Along with contributions from other countries, this fund will increase and accelerate the deployment of all forms of cleaner, more efficient technologies in developing nations like India and China, and help leverage substantial private-sector capital by making clean energy projects more financially attractive." He also announced plans to reaffirm the United States' commitment to work with major economies, and, through the UN, to complete an international agreement that will slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases; he stated, "This agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/stateoftheunion2008.htm |title=George W.

The issue had been debated for 13 years before it finally became law. The measure is designed to protect citizens without hindering genetic research.

====Immigration====

====Purge of the Central Intelligence Agency====
Following the resignation of CIA director [[George Tenet]] in 2004, Bush nominated [[Porter Goss]] to head the agency. The White House ordered Goss to purge agency officers who were disloyal to the administration.&lt;ref name=salon&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.salon.com/2004/11/15/cia_13/ |title=Purging the disloyal at the CIA |newspaper=Salon.com |date=November 15, 2004 |accessdate=April 4, 2017 |first1=Geraldine |last1=Sealey}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Goss' appointment, many of the CIA's senior agents were fired or quit. The CIA has been accused of deliberately leaking classified information to undermine the 2004 election.&lt;ref name=wapo&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A45940-2005Jan3.html |title=Dubious Purge at the CIA |newspaper=Washington Post |date=January 4, 2005 |accessdate=April 4, 2017 |first1=Haviland |last1=Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2001, Bush visited [[Pope John Paul II]] at Castel Gandolfo.&lt;ref&gt;Decision Points Bush, George W. Random House 2010 page 116&lt;/ref&gt;
During his presidential campaign, Bush's [[Foreign policy of the United States|foreign policy]] platform included support for stronger economic and political relationship with [[Latin America]], especially [[Mexico]], and a reduction of involvement in "[[nation-building]]" and other small-scale military engagements. The administration pursued a [[national missile defense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://fas.org/nuke/control/abmt/news/010501bush.html |title=President Bush Speech on Missile Defense |publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |date=May 1, 2001 |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |archivedate=March 13, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313022704/http://www.fas.org/nuke/control/abmt/news/010501bush.html |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush was an advocate of China's entry into the [[World Trade Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/east/04/05/china.WTO/ |title=Bush backs China's WTO entry despite standoff |publisher=CNN |date=April 6, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515133508/http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/east/04/05/china.WTO/ |archivedate=May 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2002 State of the Union Address, Bush referred to an [[axis of evil]] including [[Iraq]], [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]].&lt;ref name=suterror&gt;{{cite web |url=http://millercenter.org/president/speeches/detail/4540 |title=State of the Union Address (January 29, 2002)&amp;nbsp;– Miller Center |publisher=Millercenter.org |date=January 29, 2002 |accessdate=July 31, 2012 |author=P.O.

In 2003, Bush then launched the [[Iraq War|invasion of Iraq]], searching for Weapons of Mass Destruction, which he described as being part of the War on Terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=November 30, 2005 |accessdate=January 19, 2009 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/11/30/bush.excerpts/index.html |title=Key points from Bush speech |publisher=CNN |archivedate=May 15, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515133532/http://edition.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/11/30/bush.excerpts/index.html |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those invasions led to the toppling of the [[Taliban]] regime in Afghanistan and the removal of [[Saddam Hussein]] from power in Iraq.

[[File:Bush meets Pranab Mukherjee.jpg|thumb|left|Foreign Minister of India [[Pranab Mukherjee]] with President Bush, March 2008]]
Bush began his second term with an emphasis on improving strained relations with European nations. He appointed long-time adviser [[Karen Hughes]] to oversee a global public relations campaign. Bush lauded the pro-democracy struggles in Georgia and Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Freedom Agenda |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/infocus/freedomagenda/ |website=georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov |publisher=georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov |accessdate=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006, Bush reversed decades of U.S. policy when he visited India; the trip led to renewed ties between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-03-02-nuclear-pact_x.htm |title=Nuclear deal announced as Bush visits India |newspaper=USA Today |date=March 2, 2006 |accessdate=March 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The visit focused particularly on areas of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]], counter-terrorism cooperation, and discussions that would eventually lead to the [[India–United States Civil Nuclear Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/03/20060302-5.html |title=U.S. –India Joint Statement |date=March 2, 2006 |publisher=The White House |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611161845/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/03/20060302-5.html |archivedate=June 11, 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush's visit was in stark contrast to the stance taken by his predecessor, Bill Clinton, whose approach and response to India after the 1998 nuclear tests was that of sanctions and hectoring. The relationship between India and the United States was one that dramatically improved during Bush's tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1109/29825.html |title=Roemer key to U.S. –India relationship&amp;nbsp;– Daniel Libit and Laura Rozen |publisher=Politico.Com |accessdate=March 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126182109/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1109/29825.html |archivedate=November 26, 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Midway through Bush's second term, questions arose whether Bush was retreating from his freedom and democracy agenda, which was highlighted in policy changes toward some oil-rich former Soviet republics in central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/23/AR2006042301017.html |title=Retreat From the Freedom Agenda |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |last=Diehl |first=Jackson |date=April 24, 2005 |newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an address before both Houses of Congress on September 20, 2001, Bush thanked the nations of the world for their support following the September 11 attacks. He specifically thanked [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] for traveling to Washington to show "unity of purpose with America", and said "America has no truer friend than Great Britain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010920-8.html |title=Address to a Joint Session of Congress and the American People |author=Bush, George W. |publisher=[[The White House]] |date=September 20, 2001 |accessdate=April 6, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527194111/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010920-8.html |archivedate=May 27, 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The September 11 terrorist attacks were a major turning point in Bush's presidency. That evening, he addressed the nation from the [[Oval Office]], promising a strong response to the attacks. He also emphasized the need for the nation to come together and comfort the families of the victims. Three days after the attacks, Bush visited [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]] and met with Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]], firefighters, police officers, and volunteers. To much applause, Bush addressed the gathering via a megaphone while standing in a heap of rubble: "I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010914-9.html |date=September 14, 2001 |title=President Bush Salutes Heroes in New York |publisher=The White House |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225062850/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010914-9.html |archivedate=February 25, 2008 |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a September 20 speech, Bush condemned [[Osama bin Laden]] and his organization [[Al-Qaeda]], and issued an ultimatum to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, where bin Laden was operating, to "hand over the terrorists, or ... share in their fate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010920-8.html |date=September 20, 2001 |title=Address to a Joint Session of Congress and the American People |publisher=The White House |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |archivedate=May 27, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527194111/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010920-8.html |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 7, 2001, U.S. and British forces initiated bombing campaigns that led to the arrival of [[Northern Alliance]] troops in [[Kabul]] on November 13. The main goals of the war were to defeat the [[Taliban]], drive [[al-Qaeda]] out of Afghanistan, and capture key al-Qaeda leaders. In December 2001, the Pentagon reported that the Taliban had been defeated,&lt;ref name=taliband&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/11/world/nation-challenged-military-campaign-taliban-defeated-pentagon-asserts-but-war.html |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |date=December 11, 2001 |author1=Shanker, Tom |author2=Eric Schmitt |newspaper=The New York Times |title=A Nation Challenged; Military Campaign; Taliban Defeated, Pentagon Asserts, but War Goes On |archivedate=February 25, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225062850/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/11/world/nation-challenged-military-campaign-taliban-defeated-pentagon-asserts-but-war.html |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; but cautioned that the war would go on to continue weakening Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders.&lt;ref name=taliband/&gt; Later that month the UN had installed the [[Afghan Transitional Administration]] chaired by [[Hamid Karzai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdi.org/terrorism/isaf.cfm |title=Fact Sheet: International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan |publisher=[[Center for Defense Information]] |date=February 14, 2002 |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |archivedate=February 25, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225062850/http://www.cdi.org/terrorism/isaf.cfm |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4673026.stm |title=More Dutch troops for Afghanistan |publisher=BBC News |date=February 3, 2006 |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225062850/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4673026.stm |archivedate=February 25, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, based on [[UNICEF]] figures, [[Nicholas Kristof]] reported that "our invasion of Afghanistan may end up saving one million lives over the next decade" as the result of improved healthcare and greater access to humanitarian aid.&lt;ref&gt;Kristof, Nicholas D., [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/01/opinion/a-merciful-war.html "A Merciful War,"] ''The New York Times'', February 1, 2002. "Now aid is pouring in and lives are being saved on an enormous scale. Unicef, for example, has vaccinated 734,000 children against measles over the last two months, in a country where virtually no one had been vaccinated against the disease in the previous 10 years. Because measles often led to death in Afghanistan, the vaccination campaign will save at least 35,000 children's lives each year... Heidi J. Larson of Unicef says that if all goes well, child and maternal mortality rates will drop in half in Afghanistan over the next five years. That would mean 112,000 fewer children and 7,500 fewer pregnant women dying each year."&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with his January 29, 2002 [[State of the Union]] address, Bush began publicly focusing attention on Iraq, which he labeled as part of an "[[axis of evil]]" allied with terrorists and posing "a grave and growing danger" to U.S. interests through possession of [[weapons of mass destruction]].&lt;ref name=sotu2002/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Iraq: The War Card |url=http://www.iwatchnews.org/accountability/iraq-war-card |publisher=The Center for Public Integrity |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225062850/http://www.iwatchnews.org/accountability/iraq-war-card |archivedate=February 25, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush withdrew U.S. support for several international agreements, including the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] (ABM) with Russia. He also signed the [[Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty]] with Russia.

Bush emphasized a careful approach to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians; he denounced [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] leader [[Yasser Arafat]] for his support of violence, but sponsored dialogues between Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] and Palestinian National Authority President [[Mahmoud Abbas]]. Bush supported Sharon's unilateral disengagement plan, and lauded the democratic elections held in Palestine after Arafat's death.

Bush opened the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in Salt Lake City, Utah. Departing from previous practice, he stood among a group of U.S. athletes rather than from a ceremonial stand or box, saying: "On behalf of a proud, determined, and grateful nation, I declare open the Games of Salt Lake City, celebrating the Olympic Winter Games."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/02/20020209-2.html |title=President Bush Opens 2002 Olympic Games |date=February 8, 2002 |publisher=The White House |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514195905/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/02/20020209-2.html |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, in the course of a good-will trip to Asia, he attended the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=August 22, 2008 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26131736/ |title=Bush: Olympics exceeded my expectations |agency=Associated Press |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822105310/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26131736 |archivedate=August 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush twice invoked [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Section 3: Presidential declaration|Section 3 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment]], which allows a president to temporarily transfer the powers and duties of his office to the vice president, who then becomes [[Acting President of the United States|acting president]]. On June 29, 2002, Bush underwent a [[colonoscopy]] and chose to invoke Section 3 of the amendment, making Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] the acting president. The medical procedure began at 7:09&amp;nbsp;am. EDT and ended at 7:29&amp;nbsp;am. EDT. Bush woke up twenty minutes later, but did not resume his presidential powers and duties until 9:24&amp;nbsp;am. EDT after the president's doctor, [[Richard Tubb]], conducted an overall examination. Tubb said he recommended the additional time to make sure the sedative had no after effects. On July 21, 2007, Bush again invoked Section 3 in response to having to undergo a colonoscopy, again making Vice President Cheney the acting president. Bush invoked Section 3 at 7:16&amp;nbsp;am. EDT. He reclaimed his powers at 9:21&amp;nbsp;am. EDT. In both cases, Bush specifically cited Section 3 when he transferred the presidential powers to the Vice President and when he reclaimed those powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/acting_presidents.php |title=Acting Presidents Under the 25th Amendment |publisher=American Presidency Project |accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the announcement of [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]'s retirement on July 1, 2005, Bush nominated [[John Roberts]] to succeed her. On September 5, following the death of [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[William Rehnquist]], this nomination was withdrawn and Bush instead nominated Roberts for Chief Justice to succeed Rehnquist. Roberts was confirmed by the Senate as the 17th Chief Justice on September 29, 2005.

On October 3, 2005, Bush nominated long time White House Counsel [[Harriet Miers]] for O'Connor's position. After facing significant opposition from both parties, who found her to be ill-prepared and uninformed on the law,&lt;ref name="Greenburg, Jan Crawford 2007. Page 278"&gt;Greenburg, Jan Crawford. Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story of the Struggle for Control of the United States Supreme Court.2007. Penguin Books. Page 278.&lt;/ref&gt; Miers asked that her name be withdrawn on October 27. Four days later, on October 31, Bush nominated federal appellate judge [[Samuel Alito]]. Alito was confirmed as the 110th Supreme Court Justice on January 31, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes&amp;nbsp;– Nomination of Samuel Alito |url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00002 |publisher=Senate.gov |accessdate=July 31, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829201552/https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00002 |archivedate=August 29, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other courts====
{{Main|List of federal judges appointed by George W. Bush}}
In addition to his two Supreme Court appointments, Bush appointed 61 judges to the [[United States courts of appeals]] and 261 judges to the [[United States district court]]s. Each of these numbers, along with his total of 324 judicial appointments, is third in American history, behind both [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Bill Clinton]]. Bush experienced a number of [[George W. Bush judicial appointment controversies|judicial appointment controversies]]. Debate during one confirmation session lasted "39 stupefying hours" according to ''The New York Times''. On August 3, 2001, the Senate did not consent to keep existing nominations in ''status quo'', returning 40 judicial nominations, and 164 total nominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/10/20081006-5.html |title=President Bush Discusses Judicial Accomplishments and Philosophy |date=October 6, 2008 |publisher=The White House |place=Cincinnati, Ohio |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813153034/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/10/20081006-5.html |archivedate=August 13, 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Source states "For the first time in history, the Senate used a filibuster to block a nominee to the Court of Appeals" hence one specific example is exactly in source {{not in source|date=June 2012}}--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/16/weekinreview/page-two-buzzwords.html |title=PAGE TWO: BUZZWORDS |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 16, 2003 |archivedate=April 24, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424160347/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/16/weekinreview/page-two-buzzwords.html |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Denis Steven Rutkus |author2=Mitchel A.

At the outset, Judicature magazine noted that the "Senate Democrats were gearing up for the approaching confirmation hearings" before the first set of nominees were sent to the Senate. It then cites ''The New York Times'' as saying "Senate Democrats have pledged they will not automatically vote to confirm Mr. Bush's judicial nominees and will subject them to intense scrutiny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2564309961.html |title="Strict Scrutiny?" the Content of Senate Judicial Confirmation Hearings during the George W.

===Reception===
The George W. Bush presidency has been ranked among the worst in [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|surveys of presidential scholars]] published in the late 2000s and 2010s.&lt;ref name="US News"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Austin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mann"/&gt;

After his re-election in 2004, Bush received increasingly heated [[Public image of George W. Bush|criticism]] from across the [[political spectrum]]&lt;ref name="Republican right abandoning Bush"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelley Beaucar Vlahos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker"/&gt; for his handling of the Iraq War, [[Hurricane Katrina]],&lt;ref name="TVNZ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mike M. Ahlers"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; and other challenges. Amid this criticism, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] regained control of Congress in the [[United States elections, 2006|2006 elections]]. In December 2007, the United States entered its longest post-[[World War II]] recession, often referred to as the "[[Great Recession]]", prompting the Bush administration to obtain congressional passage of multiple economic programs intended to preserve the country's financial system. Nationally, Bush was both one of the most popular and unpopular presidents in history, having received the highest recorded presidential approval ratings in the wake of the September 11 attacks, as well as one of the lowest approval ratings during the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2008 financial crisis]].&lt;ref name="Gallup"/&gt;

Bush said in 2013, "Ultimately history will judge the decisions I made, and I won't be around because it will take time for the objective historians to show up. So I am pretty comfortable with it. I did what I did."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jul/2/george-w-bush-history-will-judge-opinion-polls-i-c/ |title=George W.

Bush appeared on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' on November 19, 2013, along with the former [[First Lady]], Laura Bush.

He added that people had said during his presidency that he should withdraw American troops from Iraq, but he chose the opposite, sending 30,000 more troops in order to defeat [[Al Qaeda in Iraq]], and that Al Qaeda in Iraq was defeated. Bush was also asked about Iran but declined to answer, stating that any answer he gives would be interpreted as undermining President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name=IsraelHayom&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=26127 |title=My position was: you need to have boots on the ground |author1=Amos Regev |author2=Boaz Bismuth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Bush's legacy continues to develop today. Supporters credit Bush's counterterrorism policies with preventing another major terrorist attack from occurring in the US after 9/11 and also praise individual policies such as the [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] prescription drug benefit and the AIDS relief program known as [[PEPFAR]]. Critics often point to his handling of the [[Iraq War]], specifically the failure to find [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]], that were the main rationale behind the initial invasion—as well as his handling of [[Taxation in the United States|tax policy]], [[Hurricane Katrina]], [[climate change]] and the [[2008 financial crisis]]—as proof that George W.

Several historians and commentators hold the view that Bush was one of the most consequential presidents in American history.

The '''Great Saxon Revolt''' was a civil war between 1077 and 1088 early in the history of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] led by a group of opportunistic [[List of states of the Holy Roman Empire|German princes]] who elected as their figurehead the [[duke]] of [[Swabia]] and [[anti-king]] [[Rudolf of Rheinfeld]], a two-way brother-in-law of the young [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]] (Henry was crowned at the age of six and took on his offices when aged sixteen). It followed the [[Saxon Rebellion]] of 1073–75.

The duke had played power politics with the young Emperor several years earlier in his reign, and was demonstrably ruthless (kidnapping and forcing the marriage to Henry's sister) even without the support of the other princes of the [[Kingdom of Germany]]. The allied nobility were moved to take advantage of the momentary weakness of the Emperor in a period when he was at odds and had been excommunicated by [[Pope Gregory VII]] over the issue of who was entitled to appoint whom, who was therefore subservient to whom, as well as a dispute over the [[Emperor-elect]]'s desire to divorce from his arranged wife.

After meeting with a penitent Henry IV in the fall of 1076, the pope had removed the first excommunication of the impetuous and hot-headed twenty-six-year-old monarch. However, during the same fall-winter season the organizers of the revolt by the nobility were arranging for all to meet in late winter to further their own ends against the interests of the young emperor-elect. With the delays of news and events imposed by [[High Middle Ages]] travel, communications heralding the rapprochement were delayed enough that the decision was made to just go ahead and meet anyway. The diverse council of Saxon, Bavarian, and Carinthian princes met in the March 1077, about as soon as early spring travel conditions allowed, in [[Forchheim (Oberfranken)|Forchheim]] (Oberfranken), and despite  the reconciliation between the pope and Henry decided to press forward with their desires to expand their own powers.

The group consisted of high-ranking secular rulers as well as churchmen&amp;mdash;who had up until the very recent [[Investiture Controversy]] and crisis been appointed by the Holy Roman Emperor&amp;mdash;the new canon law reforms which set up the [[college of cardinals]] had heavily involved [[Pope Gregory VII]]. Prior to Henry's crowning at the age of six as the Emperor, the Emperor had been crowned by the Pope, who in turn he'd appointed. Henry's age of inheritance had been a flash point leading to much discussion and controversy spurring the reform. As the elected [[anti-king]], Rudolf hoped to achieve the greater nobilities' backing by promising to respect the [[prince-elector|electoral concept]] of the monarchy (thus accepting a more limited and greater circumscribed set of powers as [[King of the Germans|King of Germany]]) and the pope's backing by openly declaring his willingness to be subservient to the pope, as [[King of the Romans]]. 
[[File:Rudolf von Schwaben.jpg|thumb|The mortally wounded Rudolf of Swabia]]
Despite these difficulties, Henry's situation in Germany improved in the following years. When Rudolf was crowned at Mainz in May 1077 by one of the plotters, [[Siegfried I, Archbishop of Mainz]], the population revolted and forced him, the archbishop, and other nobles  to flee to Saxony. Positioned there, Rudolf was geographically and then militarily deprived of his territories (later he was also stripped of Swabia) by Henry. After the inconclusive [[battle of Mellrichstadt]] (7 August 1077) and the defeat of Henry's forces in the [[Battle of Flarchheim]] (27 January 1080), Gregory VII, who had a personal animus against the Emperor-elect due to his intemperate language in earlier discourse, decided to flip-flop his decision supporting Henry to instead support the revolt and launched a second anathema (excommunication) against Henry in March 1080, thereby supporting the anti-king duke Rudolf. However, there was ample evidence that Gregory's actions were rooted in hate for the Emperor-elect instead of theology and so had an unfavorable personal impact on the Pope's reputation and authority, leading much of Germany to re-embrace Henry's cause.

On 14 October 1080 the armies of the two rival kings met at the [[White Elster]] river during the [[Battle of Elster]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Exxeto51p3cC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=%22Battle+of+Elster%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=84O0aieb-e&amp;sig=ed2QOde7wJvDRZ8ykUDuwZdJ3_8&amp;hl=en|title=Victory in the East (Book extract)|last=France|first=John|quote=Godfrey was almost certainly present in support of Henry IV at the battle of Elster in 1080 (sic 1085), when the forces of the anti-king Rudolf triumphed on the field only to see their victory nullified because Rudolf was killed|accessdate=2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the plain of [[Leipzig]] and Henry's forces again suffered a military defeat, but won the battle with a strategic outcome&amp;mdash; the anti-king Rudolf of Swabia was mortally wounded and died the next day at nearby [[Merseburg]], and the rebellion against Henry lost much of its momentum.

Henry convoked a synod of the highest German clergy in [[Bamberg]] and [[Brixen]] (June 1080).  Here Henry had Pope Gregory (who he had dubbed "The False Monk") deposed and replaced him by appointing the primate of [[Ravenna]], Guibert (now known as the [[antipope Clement III]]), reasserting the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s' traditional right to appoint the pope for his side of the [[Investiture Controversy]]&amp;mdash;though who was in the right was unclear in the day&amp;mdash;the emperor reacting to retain his traditional prerogatives against the new [[canon law]] appointing the pope via the [[College of Cardinals]]. For the next few years, the civil war shifted south of the Alps.

While Henry campaigned there, the German aristocracy replaced their king Rudolf with the belated election of king [[Hermann of Salm]] (ca. 1035 – 28 September 1088), also known as Herman of Luxembourg, as their new anti-king in August 1081, but he was fought successfully to a stalemate by [[Frederick I, Duke of Swabia]] (Frederick of Swabia) &amp;mdash; Rudolf's Henry-appointed successor in Swabia who had married Henry's daughter [[Agnes of Germany]]. Henry's campaign against the pope in Italy resulted in an accommodation and he was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] by [[Pope Gregory VII]] in 1084, leaving the anti-king Hermann of Salm in an awkward position.

Hermann's plan to gather an army on the banks of the [[Danube]] and march into Italy in support of the pope was dashed by the death of his main retainer, [[Otto of Nordheim]]. When Henry, now the crowned Holy Roman Emperor, returned north and came into Saxony with an army in 1085, Hermann fled to [[Denmark]]. He returned, however, in alliance with [[Welf I, Duke of Bavaria]], and defeated the emperor at the [[Battle of Bleichfeld]] on the [[River Main]], taking [[Würzburg]]. Soon after his victory, however, he tired of being a pawn in the hands of the grandees and retired to his familial estates. The Great Saxon Revolt civil war may have ended in 1088, for in 1089 Countess Matilda married [[Welf II, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Welf II]] of Bavaria, but [[Welf I, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Welf I]] only died in 1101.

The '''Guggenheim Museum Bilbao''' is a [[museum]] of modern and contemporary art designed by Canadian-American architect [[Frank Gehry]], and located in [[Bilbao]], [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], [[Spain]]. The museum was inaugurated on 18 October 1997 by [[King of Spain|King]] [[Juan Carlos I]] of Spain. Built alongside the [[Nervion River]], which runs through the city of Bilbao to the [[Cantabrian Sea]], it is one of several museums belonging to the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation]] and features permanent and visiting exhibits of works by Spanish and international artists. It is one of the [[list of largest art museums|largest]] museums in Spain.

One of the most admired works of [[contemporary architecture]], the building has been hailed as a "signal moment in the architectural culture", because it represents "one of those rare moments when critics, academics, and the general public were all completely united about something."&lt;ref name="VF Tyrnauer 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tyrnauer|first=Matt|title=Architecture in the Age of Gehry|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2010/08/architecture-survey-201008?currentPage=all|accessdate=July 22, 2010|newspaper=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=June 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum was the building most frequently named as one of the  most important works completed since 1980 in the 2010 [[World Architecture Survey]] among architecture experts.&lt;ref name="VF Tyrnauer 2010" /&gt;

==History==
In 1991, the Basque government suggested to the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation]] that it would fund a Guggenheim museum to be built in [[Bilbao]]'s decrepit port area, once the city's main source of income.&lt;ref name=Templar&gt;Templar, Karen. [http://www.salon.com/1999/10/05/gehry/ "Frank Gerry"], ''Salon'', October 5, 1997, accessed March 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ArchBilbao&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/guggenheim-foundation/architecture/bilbao "Guggenheim Museum Bilbao"], The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, accessed April 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Security&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9710/18/spain.guggenheim/index.html?_s=PM:WORLD], ''CNN'', October 18, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The Basque government agreed to cover the US$100 million construction cost, to create a US$50 million acquisitions fund, to pay a one-time US$20 million fee to the Guggenheim and to subsidize the museum's US$12 million annual budget. In exchange, the Foundation agreed to manage the institution, rotate parts of its permanent collection through the Bilbao museum and organize temporary exhibitions.&lt;ref name=Riding1&gt;Riding, Alan. [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/24/arts/a-gleaming-new-guggenheim-for-grimy-bilbao.html "A Gleaming New Guggenheim for Grimy Bilbao"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 24 June 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum was built by [[Ferrovial]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ferrovial.com/en/index.asp?MP=14&amp;MS=254&amp;MN=3 Ferrovial history]&lt;/ref&gt; at a cost of US$89 million.&lt;ref&gt;Ouroussoff, Nicolai. [http://articles.latimes.com/1997-06-02/entertainment/ca-64765_1_gehry-guggenheim-bilbao-krens "The Architect's New Museum in Bilbao, Spain, Emerges as a Testament to One Man's Optimism Amid a Landscape of Industrial Decay"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 2 June 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  About 5,000 residents of Bilbao attended a preopening extravaganza outside the museum on the night preceding the official opening, featuring an outdoor light show and concerts. On 18 October 1997 the museum was opened by [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]].&lt;ref name=Security/&gt;

==Building==
[[File:GuggenheimBilbao.jpg|thumb|240x240px|The museum is clad in glass, titanium, and limestone|alt=]]
The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation selected [[Frank Gehry]] as the architect, and its director, [[Thomas Krens]], encouraged him to design something daring and innovative.&lt;ref&gt;Gehry, Frank. ''Frank Gehry Talks Architecture and Process'' (New York: Rizolli, 1999), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  The curves on the exterior of the building were intended to appear random; the architect said that "the randomness of the curves are designed to catch the light".&lt;ref name="aggarwal"&gt;{{Cite web| last =Aggerwal| first =Artika  | title =Frank Owen Gerty |accessdate=August 18, 2011| url = http://www.archinomy.com/case-studies/1931/frank-owen-gehry}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interior "is designed around a large, light-filled atrium with views of Bilbao's estuary and the surrounding hills of the Basque country".&lt;ref name=Priceless&gt;Walsh, John. [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/the-priceless-peggy-guggenheim-1806124.html "The priceless Peggy Guggenheim"], ''The Independent'', October 21, 2009, accessed March 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The atrium, which Gehry nicknamed ''The Flower'' because of its shape, serves as the organizing center of the museum.&lt;ref name=Riding1/&gt;

When the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao opened to the public in 1997, it was immediately hailed as one of the world's most spectacular buildings in the style of [[Deconstructivism]] (although Gehry does not associate himself with that architectural movement),&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt; a masterpiece of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Tompkins&gt;Tompkins, Calvin. [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1997/07/07/1997_07_07_038_TNY_CARDS_000378216 "The Maverick", ''The New Yorker''], July 7, 1997, accessed March 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Architect [[Philip Johnson]] described it as "the greatest building of our time",&lt;ref&gt;Tyrnauer, Matt. [http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2010/08/architecture-survey-201008 "Architecture in the Age of Gehry"], ''Vanity Fair'', August 2010, accessed March 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; while critic [[Calvin Tomkins]], in ''The New Yorker'', characterized it as "a fantastic dream ship of undulating form in a cloak of [[titanium]]," its brilliantly reflective panels also reminiscent of fish scales.&lt;ref name=Tompkins/&gt; [[Herbert Muschamp]] praised its "mercurial brilliance" in ''The New York Times Magazine''.&lt;ref name=Muschamp&gt;Muschamp, Herbert. [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/07/magazine/the-miracle-in-bilbao.html "The Miracle in Bilbao"], ''The New York Times Magazine'', September 7, 1997, accessed April 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Independent'' calls the museum "an astonishing architectural feat".&lt;ref name = Priceless/&gt;  The building inspired other structures of similar design across the globe.

The museum is seamlessly integrated into the urban context, unfolding its interconnecting shapes of stone, glass and titanium on a {{convert|32500|m2|adj=on|sp=us}} site along the [[Nervión]] River in the ancient industrial heart of the city; while modest from street level, it is most impressive when viewed from the river.&lt;ref name=Muschamp/&gt;&lt;ref name=Templer&gt;Templer, Karen. [http://www.salon.com/1999/10/05/gehry/ "Frank Gehry"], ''Salon'', October 5, 1999, accessed March 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; With a total {{convert|24000|m2|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|11000|m2|abbr=on}} are dedicated to exhibition space, it had more exhibition space than the three Guggenheim collections in New York and Venice combined at that time.&lt;ref name=Security/&gt; The 11,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of exhibition space are distributed over nineteen galleries, ten of which follow a classic orthogonal plan that can be identified from the exterior by their stone finishes. The remaining nine galleries are irregularly shaped and can be identified from the outside by their swirling organic forms and titanium cladding.  The largest gallery measures 30 meters wide and 130 meters long (98&amp;nbsp;ft&amp;nbsp;× 427&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref name=ArchBilbao/&gt;&lt;ref name=Muschamp/&gt; In 2005, it housed [[Richard Serra]]'s monumental installation ''[[The Matter of Time]]'', which [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] dubbed "courageous and sublime".&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Robert, [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/jun/22/art "Man of Steel"], ''The Guardian'', June 22, 2005, accessed March 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Guggenheim night.jpg|thumb|280x280px|The museum by night, November 2007|alt=]]
The building was constructed on time and budget, which is rare for architecture of this type. In an interview in ''[[Harvard Design Magazine]]'', Gehry explained how he did it. First, he ensured that what he calls the "[[organization of the artist]]" prevailed during construction, to prevent political and business interests from interfering with the design. Second, he made sure he had a detailed and realistic cost estimate before proceeding. Third, he used computer visualizations produced by Rick Smith employing [[Dassault Systèmes|Dassault Systemes]]' CATIA V3 software&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Building Art - The Life and Work of Frank Gehry|last=Goldberger|first=Paul|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|year=2015|isbn=978-0-307-70153-4|location=New York|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.3ds.com/press-releases/single/gehry-technologies-extends-partnership-with-dassault-systemes-to-develop-solutions-for-building-ind/|title=Gehry Technologies Extends Partnership with Dassault Systèmes to Develop Solutions for Building Industry|last=Malherbe|first=Arnaud|date=October 23, 2003|work=Dassault Systemes' Press Releases|access-date=August 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and collaborated closely with the individual building trades to control costs during construction.

[[KLM Royal Dutch Airlines]] donated $1,000,000 towards its construction.

== Virtual Building ==
In the fall of 1993, architects at Gehry Partners began to utilize [[Dassault Systèmes|Dassault Systemes]]’ [[CATIA]] software for the schematic design phase of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao to digitize and model the exterior of the Museum project.  The architects applied Master Modeling and Virtual Build Processes they learned from Rick Smith&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=June 2014|title=AIA Awards|url=https://www.architectmagazine.com/magazine/2014/june/|journal=Architect|pages=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baudoin|first=Genevieve|date=January 2016|title=A Matter of Tolerance|url=http://theplanjournal.com/|journal=The Plan Journal|volume=0/2016|pages=38,39}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his use of the same techniques on the Walt Disney Concert Hall during the previous two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Fabrication in Architecture, Engineering and Construction|last=Caneparo|first=Luca|publisher=Springer|year=2014|isbn=978-94-007-7137-6|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success and global awareness of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao ushered in a new era of Virtual Building and was a catalyst for what would become popularly known as [[Building information modeling|Building Information Modeling]] seven years later.

Pulitzer prize winning architectural critic Paul Goldberger shares the words of others that Bilbao "''could not have been constructed without CATIA''". He further relays that Bilbao "was the first building for which CATIA played a role in almost every aspect of the design and construction process".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Building Art: The Life and Work of Frank Gehry|last=Goldberger|first=Paul|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|year=2015|isbn=978-0-307-70153-4|location=New York|pages=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
The museum notably houses "large-scale, site-specific works and installations by contemporary artists", such as [[Richard Serra]]'s 100-meter-long (340&amp;nbsp;ft) ''Snake'', and displays the work of Basque artists, "as well as housing a selection of works" from the Foundation's modern art collection.&lt;ref name=Priceless/&gt;  In 1997, the museum opened with "The Guggenheim Museums and the Art of This Century", a 300-piece overview of 20th-century art from [[Cubism]] to new media art. Most pieces came from the Guggenheim's permanent collection, but the museum also acquired paintings by [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Mark Rothko]] and [[Clyfford Still]] and commissioned new works by [[Francesco Clemente]], [[Anselm Kiefer]], [[Jenny Holzer]] and [[Richard Serra]].&lt;ref name=Riding1/&gt;

The exhibitions change often; the museum generally hosts thematic exhibitions, centered for example on [[Culture of China|Chinese]] or Russian art.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}  Traditional paintings and sculptures are a minority compared to installations and electronic forms.  The highlight of the collection, and its only permanent exhibit, is ''[[The Matter of Time]]'' (incorporating an earlier work, ''Snake''), a series of [[weathering steel]] sculptures designed by Serra, which is housed in the 130-meter Arcelor Gallery (formerly known as the Fish Gallery but renamed in 2005 for the steel manufacturer that sponsored the project).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/Magazine/news/artnetnews2/artnetnews4-13-2.asp  Bird's-eye rendering of the Arcelor Gallery with layout of installation "The Matter of Time"], Artnet News, accessed April 14, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  The collections usually highlight [[Avant-garde art]], 20th century abstraction, and non-objective art.  When the museum announced the 2011 exhibition "The Luminous Interval", a show of artwork belonging to Greek businessman [[Dimitris Daskalopoulos]], who is also a museum trustee, this met with criticism of, among other things, too much curatorial power for a serious benefactor.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, Carol. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/17/arts/design/17vogel.html "Guggenheim Defends Show of Trustee’s Art"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[Olivier berggruen|Olivier Berggruen]] and Ingrid Pfeiffer curated a retrospective of [[Yves Klein]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://prensa.guggenheim-bilbao.es/src/uploads/2012/12/Dossier_Prog_2005_ING.pdf Guggenheim Bilbao, Art Program: 2005]''&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2012 [["David Hockney: A Bigger Picture" in Bilbao|David Hockney's exhibition]]  drew over 290,000 visitors to the museum.

The museum was opened as part of a revitalization effort for the city of [[Bilbao]].&lt;ref name="Cañadillas et Daza"&gt;{{Cite web| last =Cañadillas| first =Iñaki  | title =''Caso práctico: La Planificación Estratégica del Museo Guggenheim Bilbao desde una perspectiva de Marketing'' |accessdate=October 13, 2011| url = http://www.ehu.es/cuadernosdegestion/documentos/916.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost immediately after its opening, the Guggenheim Bilbao became a popular tourist attraction, drawing visitors from around the globe.&lt;ref name="lee"&gt;{{Cite news| last =Lee| first =Denny  | title =Bilbao, 10 Years Later| newspaper =[[The New York Times]]|date=September 23, 2007| url = http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/09/23/travel/23bilbao.html?em&amp;ex=1190606400&amp;en=898bb5be11939f56&amp;ei=5087%0A}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its first three years, almost 4 million tourists visited the museum, helping to generate about €500 million in economic activity. The regional council estimated that the money visitors spent on hotels, restaurants, shops and transport allowed it to collect €100 million in taxes, which more than paid for the building cost.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Leslie. [http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/guggenheim-bilbao-and-%E2%80%98hot-banana%E2%80%99 "Guggenheim, Bilbao, and the 'hot banana'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518005937/http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/guggenheim-bilbao-and-%E2%80%98hot-banana%E2%80%99 |date=2013-05-18 }}, ''[[Financial Times]]'', September 4, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was featured in the 1999 [[James Bond in film|James Bond film]] ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'' in the pre-title sequence and the Tamil film ''[[Sivaji (film)|Sivaji]]'' (2007), in which it is the setting for the music video of the song "Style", composed by [[A. R. Rahman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/gallery/Events/12540.html Skin Grafting in 'Sivaji'], India Glitz&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mariah Carey]]'s music video "[[Sweetheart (Rainy Davis song)|Sweetheart]]", directed by [[Hype Williams]], shows singers [[Jermaine Dupri]] and Carey in various locations at the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao.

==Criticism==
The so-called "Bilbao effect" refers to how the museum transformed the city. The term, however, has also been employed by critics who have denounced the museum as a symbol of [[gentrification]] and [[cultural imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hedgecoe, Guy. [http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,15904659,00.html "Bilbao's Guggenheim continues to divide"], ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', June 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' suggested that the Bilbao effect should be called the Bilbao anomaly, "for the iconic chemistry between the design of building, its image and the public turns out to be rather rare."&lt;ref&gt;Rybczynski, Witold. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122731149503149341 When Buildings Try Too Hard], ''Wall Street Journal'', November 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art critic [[Brian O'Doherty]] was positive about approaching the building but criticized the museum's interior effect, saying "[O]nce you get indoors things are a little different. Even the so-called site-specific works didn't look too happy to me. Most of the interior spaces are too vast." He went on to describe how works by [[Georges Braque|Braque]], [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] and [[Alexander Rodchenko|Rodchenko]] "looked absurd" and tiny on the museum's walls.&lt;ref name=Fri&gt;"Public Spectacle: Mark Godfrey and Rosie Bennett talk to Brian O'Doherty," ''Frieze,'' issue 80, Jan./Feb. 2004, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management and 2007 embezzlement incident==
According to a report issued in 2007 by the Basque Court of Auditors, the museum paid more than US$27 million for the acquisition of art between 2002 and 2005, including Serra's ''The Matter of Time'' for the cavernous ground-floor gallery.&lt;ref&gt;Picard, Charmaine. [http://www.theartnewspaper.com/article.asp?id=8639 "Guggenheim Bilbao director admits to €4.2m loss"], ''[[The Art Newspaper]]'', August 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; After another audit in 2008 revealed that money was missing from accounts,&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Rachel Lee. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/30/arts/design/30arts-BILBAOMUSEUM_BRF.html "Bilbao Museum Official Sentenced"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; the Foundation said that it filed a case against the director, Roberto Cearsolo Barrenetxea, "for financial and accounting irregularities", asserting that he had admitted diverting money from two companies that manage the Guggenheim Bilbao building and its art collection&lt;ref&gt;Nayeri, Farah. [Guggenheim Bilbao Says Its Finance Director Embezzled US$775,000], ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]'', April 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; to his own account since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Van Gelder, Lawrence.

'''Gunlā''' ([[Nepal Bhasa]]: गुंला) (also spelt '''Gumlā''') is the tenth month in the [[Nepal Sambat]] lunar calendar, the national [[lunar calendar]] of [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nepal Sambat gets national status|url=http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/detail.php?article_id=8874&amp;cat_id=5|accessdate=18 May 2014|newspaper=The Rising Nepal|date=24 October 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020104054/http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/detail.php?article_id=8874&amp;cat_id=5|archivedate=20 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It corresponds to August of the [[Gregorian Calendar]].

Gunla is a holy month for Newar Buddhists when they recite the scriptures, observe fasts and visit places of worship playing devotional music. It is one of the most important events in [[Newar Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Locke| first =John K.| authorlink =| coauthors =| url =http://www.niem.com.np/newararticles/unique_features.htm| title =Unique Features of Newar Buddhism| work =| publisher =Nagarjuna Institute of Exact Methods| date =2008| accessdate =5 August 2012| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120324221525/http://www.niem.com.np/newararticles/unique_features.htm| archivedate =24 March 2012| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Todd T.|title=Notes on the Uray and the Modernization of Newar Buddhism|url=http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/contributions/CNAS_23_01_08.pdf|accessdate=5 August 2012|newspaper=Contributions to Nepalese Studies|date=January 1996}} Page 111.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of observing the sacred month is descended from the rains retreat dating from the [[Buddha]]'s time when monks stayed in one place and taught the [[Dharma]].&lt;ref&gt;LeVine, Sarah and Gellner, David N.

==Observances==
Devotees mark the holy month by making daily early morning [[pilgrimage]]s to [[Swayambhu]] in [[Kathmandu]] and other Buddhist temples playing [[Gunla Bajan]] music. The musical bands represent various localities of the city.

The devout recite the scriptures at home and sacred courtyards. Some undergo fasting. Another devotional activity during Gunla is Dyah Thāyegu (द्यः थायेगु) when devotees make little stupas out of black clay using a mold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Lewis| first = Todd T.| url = https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:JAPb_sAK2UUJ:archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/ojs/index.php/jiabs/article/download/8816/2723+&amp;hl=en&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESh9r3oBIyPmcAJBn1hacu0AnNvM6afGBlNAfuPm7tNLRceDLGzir-JXClg6UJsf6DE7aWRvAbgUdBNIeuwX_kLpb7cpsnT4eSZuBQg6O81zm6mLSbFeAnSo16RtH4LHPVXF58kU&amp;sig=AHIEtbTBvE6656upPxJB5L1Yl_GwQum0hQ |title = Contributions to the Study of Popular Buddhism: The Newar Buddhist Festival of Gumla Dharma | work =Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies | publisher = | date=Winter 1993| accessdate =19 February 2013}} Page 333.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major days==

===Panjarān===

[[File:Pajaran2.jpg|thumb|200px|Devotees with offerings wait for alms receivers during Panjarān]]

Panjaran (पन्जरां) is the alms giving festival. Males of the [[Bajracharya]] and [[Shakya]] castes make an alms round of the city and devotees give them rice and money. Shrines are set up with Buddha statues and [[paubha]] scroll paintings at private homes, courtyards and on the roadsides from where the gifts are distributed. The event is held on different dates in Kathmandu valley and [[Patan, Nepal|Lalitpur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lewis |first=Todd T. |date=Winter 1993 |title=Contributions to the Study of Popular Buddhism: The Newar Buddhist Festival of Gumla Dharma |url=https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/viewFile/8816/2723 |journal=Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=336–339 |accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddha display===

On the first day of the second fortnight of Gunla, large images of the [[Dipankara Buddha]] and [[paubha]] paintings are put on display in sacred courtyards. The ceremony is known as Bahidyah Bwayegu (बहीद्यः ब्वयेगु).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Lewis| first = Todd T.| url = https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:JAPb_sAK2UUJ:archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/ojs/index.php/jiabs/article/download/8816/2723+&amp;hl=en&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESh9r3oBIyPmcAJBn1hacu0AnNvM6afGBlNAfuPm7tNLRceDLGzir-JXClg6UJsf6DE7aWRvAbgUdBNIeuwX_kLpb7cpsnT4eSZuBQg6O81zm6mLSbFeAnSo16RtH4LHPVXF58kU&amp;sig=AHIEtbTBvE6656upPxJB5L1Yl_GwQum0hQ |title = Contributions to the Study of Popular Buddhism: The Newar Buddhist Festival of Gumla Dharma | work =Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies | publisher = | date=Winter 1993| accessdate =19 February 2013}} Page 335.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Tuladhar |first=Alok |date=25 October 2013 |title= Bahi Dyo: The Outbound Courtyard Deity |url= http://ecs.com.np/features/bahi-dyo-the-outbound-courtyard-deity |newspaper= ECS Nepal |accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On this day in a festival known as Bahidyah Swahwanegu (बहीद्यः स्वःवनेगु), the musical bands followed by residents of the locality visit the sacred courtyards in a procession to view the exhibits. The festival occurs on the day after the full moon and coincides with the [[Gaijatra|Gai Jatra]] festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lewis |first=Todd T. |date=Winter 1993 |title=Contributions to the Study of Popular Buddhism: The Newar Buddhist Festival of Gumla Dharma |url=https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/viewFile/8816/2723 |journal=Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=335–341 |accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major day for Gunla Bajan societies is the ceremony of Nisala Chhawanegu (निसला छाःवनेगु) when they make offerings to Swayambhu, and hold Gunla Bajan concerts at one's neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lewis |first=Todd T. |date=Winter 1993 |title=Contributions to the Study of Popular Buddhism: The Newar Buddhist Festival of Gumla Dharma |url=https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/viewFile/8816/2723 |journal=Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=335–341 |accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Matayā===

Matayā (मतया:) (meaning "light procession" in Nepal Bhasa) is one of the most important religious celebrations in [[Patan, Nepal|Lalitpur]]. The festival celebrates the event when the Buddha overcame [[Mara (demon)|Mara]], or temptation, and attained the light of wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Shakya| first = Min Bahadur| url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/83264998/Mataya-Festival-of-Patan |title = Mataya Festival of Patan | work =Yalamandu Post | publisher = | date=3 August 2012| accessdate =17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devotees visit Buddhist shrines and sacred courtyards in the city in a winding file and offer worship to the images. The participants also consist of musical bands and actors dressed in colorful costumes. The circuitous festival route takes the whole day to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Lewis| first = Todd T.| url = https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:JAPb_sAK2UUJ:archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/ojs/index.php/jiabs/article/download/8816/2723+&amp;hl=en&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESh9r3oBIyPmcAJBn1hacu0AnNvM6afGBlNAfuPm7tNLRceDLGzir-JXClg6UJsf6DE7aWRvAbgUdBNIeuwX_kLpb7cpsnT4eSZuBQg6O81zm6mLSbFeAnSo16RtH4LHPVXF58kU&amp;sig=AHIEtbTBvE6656upPxJB5L1Yl_GwQum0hQ |title = Contributions to the Study of Popular Buddhism: The Newar Buddhist Festival of Gumla Dharma | work =Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies | publisher = | date=Winter 1993| accessdate =10 July 2013}} Page 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other celebrations==

The 5th day of the bright fortnight is [[Nag Panchami]], a day dedicated to serpents. The 1st day of the dark fortnight is Sāpāru or [[Gaijatra|Gai Jātrā]] when processions are held in memory of family members deceased in the past year. The participants wear cow costumes and make a tour of the city.

The 8th day of the dark fortnight is the festival of [[Krishna Janmashtami]] which celebrates the birth of the [[Hindu]] deity [[Krishna]]. Gokarna Aunsi falls on the 15th day of the dark fortnight or [[Amavasya|Āmāi]]. This is [[Father's Day]] and is also known as Bauyā Khwā Swayegu ("Looking upon Father's Face").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Levy |first= Robert Isaac |date=1990 |title= Mesocosm: Hinduism and the Organization of a Traditional Newar City in Nepal|chapter=A Catalogue of Annual Events and Their Distribution throughout the Lunar Year |publisher= University of California Press |page=653 |isbn=9780520069114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Harrowdown Hill'''" is a song by [[Radiohead]] singer [[Thom Yorke]], released on his debut solo album ''[[The Eraser]]'' (2006). It was released as a single on 21 August 2006, peaking at #23 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. A music video was released on 31 July 2006 and had its first play on [[Channel 4]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xlrecordings.com/thomyorke/|title=Harrowdown Hill|date=28 July 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060810035155/http://www.xlrecordings.com/thomyorke/|archivedate=10 August 2006|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2006-08-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yorke wrote the song about death of [[David Kelly (weapons expert)|David Kelly]], a British weapons expert who told a reporter that the British government had falsely identified [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] in Iraq. It is named after the Harrowdown Hill woods where Kelly's body was found.

==Writing==
According to the ''[[The Globe and Mail|Globe and Mail]]'', "Harrowdown Hill" resembles a love song with a sense of "menace" and "grim political showdown".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/radiohead-retooled/article711010/|title=Radiohead retooled|last=Evert-Green|first=Robert|date=June 14, 2006|website=[[The Globe and Mail]]|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yorke said the song had been "kicking around" during the sessions for Radiohead's sixth album, &lt;i&gt;[[Hail to the Thief]]&lt;/i&gt; (2003), but felt it could not have worked as a Radiohead song.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/radiohead-711-1355642|title=Thom Yorke: 'Why I made a solo album' - NME|last=|first=|date=2 July 2006|work=[[NME]]|access-date=14 April 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lyrics ==
The lyrics are about [[David Kelly (weapons expert)|David Kelly]], a British weapons expert who is presumed to have committed suicide after telling a reporter that the British government had falsely identified [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] in Iraq. Kelly's body was found in the Harrowdown Hill woods near Yorke's former school in [[Oxfordshire]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/28/entertainment/et-yorke28|title=Thom Yorke, free agent|last=Powers|first=Ann|date=28 June 2006|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=3 June 2015|language=en|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Yorke was uncomfortable about the subject matter and conscious of Kelly's grieving family, but felt that "not to write it would perhaps have been worse".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In an interview with the ''Observer'', he said it was "the most angry song" he had ever written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,,1795948,00.html|title=All Messed Up|author=Mclean, Craig|date=18 June 2006|publisher=''[[The Observer|Observer Music Monthly]]''|accessdate=18 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told the ''Globe and Mail'': "The government and the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] were implicated in his death. They were directly responsible for outing him and that put him in a position of unbearable pressure that he couldn't deal with, and they knew they were doing it and what it would do to him."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Music video==
The "Harrowdown Hill" music video was directed by [[Chel White]] of [[Bent Image Lab|BENT Image Lab]] in 2006. It features [[stop-motion]] eagle animation by David Russo, [[time-lapse]] footage by Mark Eiffert, and a technique known as [[Smallgantics]]. It was released on 31 July 2006 and had its first play on [[Channel 4]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

{{Emotion}}

'''Humiliation''' is the abasement of [[pride]], which creates mortification or leads to a state of being [[Humility|humbled]] or reduced to lowliness or [[submission]]. It is an emotion felt by a person whose [[social status]], either by force or willingly, has just decreased.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Neel.  [https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/hide-and-seek/201408/the-psychology-humiliation "The Psychology of Humiliation."] ''Psychology Today''.  27 August 2014.  10 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be brought about through  [[intimidation]], physical or mental [[mistreatment]] or trickery, or by [[embarrassment]] if a person is revealed to have committed a socially or legally unacceptable act. Whereas [[humility]] can be sought alone as a means to de-emphasize the ego, humiliation must involve other person(s), though not necessarily directly or willingly. 

Humiliation is currently an active research topic, and is now seen as an important – and complex – core dynamic in human [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]], having implications at intrapersonal, interpersonal, institutional and international levels.&lt;ref name=Lindner&gt;Lindner, Evelin, Making Enemies: Humiliation and International Conflict. London, England: Praeger Security International, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological effects==
A person who suffers from severe humiliation could experience [[Major depressive disorder|major depressions]], suicidal states, and severe anxiety states such as post-traumatic stress disorder. The loss of status, like losing a job or being labeled as a liar or discredited unfairly, could cause people inability to behave normally in their communities. Humiliated individuals could be provoked and crave for revenge, and some people could feel worthless, hopeless and helpless, creating suicidal thoughts if justice is not met. It also can lead to new insights, activism and a new kinship with marginalized groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Torres |first=Walter J. |last2=Bergner |first2=Raymond M. |date=June 2010 |title=Humiliation: Its Nature and Consequences |url=http://www.jaapl.org/content/38/2/195.full |journal=[[Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law]] |publisher=AAPL |volume=38 |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feelings of humiliation can produce 'humiliated fury'&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Helen B. 1971, ''Shame and Grief in Neurosis.'' New York: International Universities Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which, when turned inward can result in [[apathy]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and when turned outward can give rise to [[paranoia]], sadistic behaviour and fantasies of revenge. Klein explains, "When it is outwardly directed, humiliated fury unfortunately creates additional victims, often including innocent bystanders ... . When it is inwardly directed, the resulting self-hate renders victims incapable of meeting their own needs, let alone having energy available to love and care for others." He goes on to say, "In either case, those who are consumed by humiliated fury are absorbed in themselves or their cause, wrapped in wounded pride..."&lt;ref name=Klein /&gt; 

A study by researchers at the University of Michigan revealed that “the same regions of the brain that become active in response to painful sensory experiences are activated during intense experiences of social rejection.” In other words, humiliation and isolation are experienced as intensely as physical pain.&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;[http://www.onbeing.org/blog/the-violence-of-humiliation/6753 Martin, Courtney E. "The Violence of Humiliation", ''On Being'', September 10, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Punishments and interrogation tactics==

Humiliating of one person  by another (the humiliator) is often used as a way of asserting power over them, and is a common form of [[oppression]] or [[abuse]] used in a [[Police abuse|police]], military, or [[Prisoner abuse|prison]] context during legal interrogations or illegal [[torture]] sessions. Many now-obsolete public [[punishment]]s were deliberately designed to be humiliating, e.g. [[tarring and feathering]] lawbreakers, [[pillory]], "[[mark of shame]]" ([[social stigma|stigma]]) as a means of "making an example" of a person and presenting a deterrent to others. Some practices, such as tarring and feathering, became tools of unofficial mob justice. In folk customs such as the English [[Skimmington|skimmington rides]] and [[rough music]] (and their continental equivalents, such as the French [[Charivari]]), dramatic public demonstrations of moral disapproval were enacted to humiliate [[Norm (social)|transgressors]] and drive them out of the community.&lt;ref name="Thompson1992"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = E.

Some U.S. states have experimented with humiliating or [[shaming]] lawbreakers by publishing their names and indicating their offense (e.g., with soliciting prostitutes or drinking and driving). In 2010, there was public outcry about reports showing police in [[Dongguan]] and [[Guangdong]] in China leading a parade of arrested prostitutes for the purpose of humiliating them. The national [[Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Public Security]] reprimanded the local police and affirmed that such punishments are not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.cntv.cn/program/china24/20100727/100816.shtml|title=Prostitute humiliation dents police image|first=Ning|last=Zhang|date=2010-07-27|accessdate=2012-01-19|publisher=[[China Network Television]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A wider human perspective==
[[Image:The Humiliation of Emperor Valerian by Shapur, King of Persia, by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|''The Humiliation of [[Valerian (emperor)|Emperor Valerian]] by [[Shapur I|Shapur]], King of Persia'' by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]].]]

Donald Klein described humiliation as "a powerful factor in human affairs that has, for a variety of reasons, been overlooked by students of individual and collective behavior. It is a pervasive and all too destructive influence in the behavior of individuals, groups, organizations, and nations."&lt;ref name=Klein&gt;Klein, Donald C. (Ed.), ''The Humiliation Dynamic: Viewing the Task of Prevention From a New Perspective'', Special Issue, Journal of Primary Prevention, Part I, 12, No. 2, 1991. New York, NY: Kluwer Academic/ Plenum Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it is a subjective emotion, humiliation has a universal aspect which applies to all human beings: "it is the feeling of being put down, made to feel less than one feels oneself to be."&lt;ref name=Lindner /&gt;

A [[society]] that suffers from humiliation is an unstable one.  The [[cognitive dissonance]] between the way in which the society is perceived and the way in which it sees itself can be so great that violence can result on a massive scale against people belonging to an [[out group]].  According to [[Jonathan Sacks]], "By turning the question 'What did we do wrong?' into 'Who did this to us?', [hate against an out group] restores some measure of self-respect and provides a course of action.  In psychiatry, the clinical terms for this process are splitting and projection; it allows people to define themselves as victims."&lt;ref&gt;Sacks, Jonathan.  [https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-return-of-anti-semitism-1422638910 "The Return of Anti-Semitism."] ''The Wall Street Journal''.  30 January 2015.  19 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jana Bahā Dyaḥ Jātrā''' ([[Devanagari]]: जनबहा द्यः जात्रा, alternate names: श्वेत मत्स्येन्द्रनाथ / मच्छिन्द्रनाथ जात्रा, सेतो मत्स्येन्द्रनाथ / मच्छिन्द्रनाथ जात्रा, अमोघपाश अवलोकितेश्वर जात्रा, जनबहाः करुणामय जात्रा) is the chariot procession of [[Seto Machindranath|Jana Baha Dyah]], the [[Bodhisattva]] of compassion, which is held annually in [[Kathmandu]]. It begins on the 8th day and ends on the 10th day of the bright fortnight of [[Chaula (month)|Chaulā]] (चौला), the sixth month in the lunar [[Nepal Era]] calendar.

The [[Buddhist]] deity is known in [[Sanskrit]] as Aryavalokitesvara (Sacred [[Avalokiteśvara]]), and also White Machhendranath or White Karunamaya. It is believed that the annual procession was begun to provide the townspeople who were unable to visit his temple a sight of the image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Locke, S.J.| first =John K.| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/54318635/1John-Locke-Newar-Buddhist-Initiation-Rites| title =Newar Buddhist Initiation Rites| work = INAS Journal| publisher = | date=| accessdate = 18 April 2013}} Page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Yoshizaki| first =Kazumi| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/30857088/Yoshizaki-Kazumi-NewarBuddhism| title =The Kathmandu Valley as a Water Pot: Abstracts of research papers on Newar Buddhism in Nepal| work = | publisher = | date=2006| accessdate = 18 April 2013}} Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The procession==

During the festival, the image of Jana Bāhā Dyah is removed from his temple at Jana Baha and carried in a portable shrine to [[Durbar marg|Durbar Marg]] from where the actual procession starts. There it is installed in the car built in the shape of a tower on wheels. The chariot is 35 ft high.

When the image is placed on the chariot, a group of musicians from the [[Kansakar]] caste play a short fanfare on their long trumpets to announce the installation. At the same time, the Guruju Paltan, a ceremonial guard of honor consisting of soldiers dressed in ancient uniforms, performs a [[feu de joie]] with their [[musket]]s. Crowds then pull the chariot through central Kathmandu accompanied by musical bands.

The journey is performed in three stages to permit devotees to make oblations. Worshippers bring trays of offerings and light rows of [[butter lamp]]s to honor the deity wherever the chariot stops. Sweet [[marjoram]] flowers (मूस्वां) are special offerings on the occasion.

==The route==
[[File:Janabaha Dyo Jatra Route.png|thumb|Route taken by Janabaha dyah jatra in Kathmandu]]

On the first day, the chariot is pulled from Jamal, [[Durbar marg|Durbar Marg]] through Bhotahiti to [[Asan, Kathmandu|Asan]] where it makes an overnight halt. The next day, the chariot is pulled through [[Indra Chok, Kathmandu|Indra Chok]] to [[Kathmandu Durbar Square]] where it makes its second stop. On the third day, the chariot is pulled through [[Maru, Kathmandu|Maru]] and Chikan Mugal to Lagan at the southern end of the historic section of Kathmandu.

There the procession ends after the chariot makes three rounds of the temple housing the mother of Janabaha Dyo. The idol is then carried back to the temple at Jana Baha, and the chariot is disassembled and the parts stored for next year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Lewis |first= Todd Thornton |authorlink= |title= The Tuladhars of Kathmandu: A Study of Buddhist Tradition in a Newar Merchant Community |url= |accessdate= |year=1984 |publisher= Columbia University |location= |isbn= |page=425}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Sangal |first1= Naresh Chandra |authorlink1= |last2= Sangal |first2= Prakash | title= Glimpses of Nepal |url= |accessdate= |year= 1998 |publisher= APH Publishing |location= |isbn=9788170249627 |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three-day parade is one of the two great chariot festivals in Kathmandu, the other being Kumari Jatra during [[Yenya]]. The date of the chariot procession of Jana Baha Dyah is changeable as it is celebrated according to the lunar calendar. 

Similar chariot processions known as [[Bunga Dyah Jatra (chariot festival)|Bunga Dyah Jatra]] are celebrated in [[Patan, Nepal|Lalitpur]] and [[Dolakha District|Dolakha]] in April-May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tuladhar |first=Amrit Ratna |url=http://redstarnepal.com/newsdetail.php?id=1167 |title=Dolakha Karunamaya |work=Redstar |publisher= |date= |accessdate=28 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415142756/http://redstarnepal.com/newsdetail.php?id=1167 |archivedate=15 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

There is a tradition that the image of Jana Baha Dyah housed in the temple at Jana Baha, Kel Tol was retrieved from Jamal, hence the chariot procession starts from here. No one knows how far back the origin of the festival goes, though it is believed to have been started in the sixth century. Chronicles show that it was already well established in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Locke |first= John K. |title= Buddhist Monasteries of Nepal: A Survey of the Bahas and Bahis of the Kathmandu Valley |url= |accessdate= |year=1985 |publisher= Sahayogi Press |location= Kathmandu |isbn= |page=311, 313}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bajracharya |first=Munindra Ratna |title= The Chariot Festival Of White Karunamaya |url= http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/gopa.detail.php?article_id=48437&amp;cat_id=10 |accessdate=19 April 2013 |newspaper=The Rising Nepal |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of jam band music festivals'''. This list may have some overlap with [[list of historic rock festivals]] and [[list of reggae festivals]]. [[Jam bands]] are musical groups who relate to a unique fan culture that began in the 1960s with [[Grateful Dead]] (see [[deadheads]]), and continued with [[The Allman Brothers Band]], which had lengthy jams at concerts. The performances of these [[Musical ensemble|bands]] typically feature extended [[musical improvisation]] ("[[jam session|jams]]") over rhythmic [[groove (music)|groove]]s and [[vamp (music)|chord patterns]], and long sets of music that can often cross genre boundaries.&lt;ref name="wiajb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jambands.com/jamband.html |title=What is a jam band? |accessdate=2007-02-02 |publisher=Jambands.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070124191643/http://www.jambands.com/jamband.html |archivedate=2007-01-24 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the seminal group Grateful Dead are categorized as [[psychedelic rock]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/psychedelic/bands/gratefuldead.html The Grateful Dead] ''Britannica Online'', Retrieved 17 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; by the 1990s the term "jam band" was being used for groups playing a variety of rock-related genres, and [[jam band festival]] lineups could include [[blues]], [[country music]], [[traditional music|folk music]], and [[funk]]. Today the term even includes some groups completely outside rock, such as those playing [[world music]], [[electronic music]], [[progressive bluegrass]], and [[jazz fusion]].&lt;ref name="wiajb"/&gt; A unique feature of the jam band scene is bands allowing fan taping or digital recording of live concerts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4806">In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], the '''Lucaria''' was a [[Roman festivals|festival]] of the [[sacred grove|grove]] (Latin ''[[lucus]]'') held July 19 and 21. The original meaning of the ritual was obscure by the time of [[Varro]] (mid-1st century BC), who omits it in his list of festivals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Varro]], ''De lingua latina'' 6.3.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of Roman deities|deity]] for whom it was celebrated is unknown;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kurt Latte]], ''Römische Religionsgeschicte'' (C.H. Beck, 1992), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; if a ritual for grove-clearing recorded by [[Cato the Elder|Cato]] pertains to this festival, the [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#invocatio|invocation]] was deliberately anonymous ''([[Si deus si dea|Si deus, si dea]])''.&lt;ref&gt;Cato, ''On Agriculture'' 139; [[Robert E.A. Palmer]], ''The Archaic Community of the Romans'' (Cambridge University Press, 2009), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; The dates of the Lucaria are recorded in the ''[[Fasti Amiterni]]'', a [[fasti|calendar]] dating from the reign of [[Tiberius]] found at [[Amiternum]] (now [[San Vittorino (L'Aquila)|S. Vittorino]]) in [[Sabine]] territory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jörg Rüpke]], ''Religion of the Romans'' (Polity Press, 2007, originally published in German 2001), p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan]] grammarian [[Verrius Flaccus]]&lt;ref&gt;As recorded by [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]]: ''Lucaria festa in luco colebant Romani, qui permagnus inter viam Salariam et Tiberim fuit, pro eo, quod victi e Gallis fugientes e praelio ibi se occultaverint''.&lt;/ref&gt; connected the Lucaria to the disastrous defeat of the Romans by the [[Gauls]] at the [[Battle of the Allia]], which was fought on July 18. The festival, he says, was celebrated in the large grove between the [[Via Salaria]] and the [[Tiber river]], where the Romans who survived the battle had hidden. The Via Salaria crossed the battlefield about 10 miles north of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London, 1908), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''lucus'' thus would have been located on the [[Pincian Hill]], which was later cultivated as [[Roman gardens|gardens and leisure parks]] by [[Gardens of Lucullus|Lucullus]], [[Theatre of Pompey#Porticus Pompei|Pompeius]], [[Gardens of Sallust|Sallust]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Roman Festivals'', p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; This explanatory story has been compared to that of the [[Poplifugia]], which also involved the Gallic sack of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Roman Festivals'', pp. 182–183.&lt;/ref&gt; The story may be more [[aition|aetiological]] than historical.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ken Dowden]], ''European Paganism: The Realities of Cult from Antiquity to the Middle Ages'' (Routledge, 2000), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lucaria suggests that grove veneration was a practice which the early Romans had in common with the Gauls.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Henig, ''Religion in Roman Britain'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1984, 2005), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other "fixed holidays" (''[[Dies nefasti|dies nefasti publici]]'') on the [[Roman calendar]], the Lucaria took place on days of uneven number, with an intervening day that was "non-festive".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lipka, ''Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach'' (Brill, 2009), pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; A mention by [[Macrobius]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#4.15  1.4.15.]&lt;/ref&gt; seems to imply that the festival began at night and continued the following day.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Julius Caesar]], ''Bellum Gallicum'' 6.18, the Gauls regularly reckoned time by nights rather than days: "They compute the divisions of every season, not by the number of days, but of nights; they keep birthdays and the beginnings of months and years in such an order that the day follows the night" ''(spatia omnis temporis non numero dierum sed noctium finiunt; dies natales et mensum et annorum initia sic observant ut noctem dies subsequatur)''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georg Wissowa]] thought that it may have been connected to the [[Neptunalia]] on July 23, when leafy huts, called umbrae, were built as shelters to protect against the hot summer sun and bulls were sacrificed.&lt;ref&gt;Sarolta A. Takács, ''Vestal Virgins, Sibyls, and Matrons: Women in Roman Religion'' (University of Texas Press, 2008), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] embodied fresh as well as salt water among the Romans, and the collocation of festivals in July, including also the [[Furrinalia]] on the 25th, may express concerns for drought.&lt;ref&gt; Robert Schilling, "Neptune," ''Roman and European Mythologies'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lupercalia''' was a very ancient, possibly pre-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[pastoral]] annual festival,&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911| wstitle=Lupercalia |volume=17 |page=126|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; observed in the city of Rome on February 15, to avert evil spirits and purify the city, releasing health and fertility. Lupercalia was also called "dies Februatus", purified (literally "februated day") after the instruments of purification called "februa", which give the month of February ''([[Februarius]])'' its name.

{{anchor|Etymologies|Names}}

==Name==
The festival was later known as Februa ("Purifications" or "Purgings") after the ''{{lang|la|februum}}'' which was used on the day.&lt;ref name=februum&gt;{{citation |contributionurl= http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=februum |contribution= februum |last= Lewis |first= Charlton T. |author2=Charles Short |display-authors=1 |title= A Latin Dictionary Founded on Andrews' edition of Freund's Latin Dictionary |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |date=1879 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also known as ''{{lang|la|Februatus}}'' and gave its name to [[Juno (goddess)|Juno]] Februalis, Februlis, or Februata in her role as its patron deity; to a god called Februus, and to [[February (Roman month)|February]] (''{{lang|la|mensis Februarius}}''), the month during which it occurred.&lt;ref name=februum/&gt; [[Ovid]] connects ''{{lang|la|februare}}'' to an [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] word for "purging".&lt;ref name="King2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Jackson King|title=Desiring Rome: Male Subjectivity and Reading Ovid's Fasti|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1FChM3QiG5kC&amp;pg=PA195|year=2006|publisher=Ohio State University Press|isbn=978-0-8142-1020-8|pages=195 ff }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources connect the Latin word for fever (''{{lang|la|febris}}'') with the same idea of purification or purging, due to the sweating commonly seen in association with fevers.

The name ''Lupercalia'' was believed in antiquity to evince some connection with the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] festival of the [[Regions of ancient Greece#Arcadia|Arcadian]] [[Lykaia]], a wolf festival ({{lang-grc-gre|λύκος}}, ''lýkos''; {{lang-la|lupus}}), and the worship of ''Lycaean [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]]'', assumed to be a Greek equivalent to [[Faunus]], as instituted by [[Evander of Pallene|Evander]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], ''Roman Antiquities'' 1.32.3&amp;ndash;5, 1.80; [[Justin (historian)|Justin]], ''Epitome of the Philippic History of Pompeius Trogus'' 43.6ff; [[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'' 1.5; [[Ovid]], ''Fasti'' 2.423&amp;ndash;42; [[Plutarch]], ''Life of Romulus'' 21.3, ''Life of Julius Caesar'', ''Roman Questions'' 68; [[Virgil]], ''Aeneid'' 8.342&amp;ndash;344; [[Lydus]], ''De mensibus'' 4.25. See Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'', s.v. "Lupercus"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Justin (historian)|Justin]] describes a cult image of "the Lycaean god, whom the Greeks call Pan and the Romans Lupercus," as nude, save for a goatskin girdle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin (historian)|Justin]], ''Epitome of the Philippic History of Pompeius Trogus'' 43.1.7.&lt;/ref&gt; It stood in the [[Lupercal]], the cave where tradition held that [[Romulus and Remus]] were suckled by the [[She-wolf (Roman mythology)|she-wolf]] ([[Lupa Capitolina|Lupa]]). The cave lay at the foot of the [[Palatine Hill]], on which [[Romulus]] was thought to have founded Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tonykline.co.uk/PITBR/Latin/OvidFastiBkTwo.htm#_Toc69367692 Ovid, ''Fasti'': Lupercalia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rites==
===Locations===
The rites were confined to the Lupercal cave, the [[Palatine Hill]], and the Forum, all of which were central locations in Rome's [[Founding of Rome|foundation myth]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'' 1.5&lt;/ref&gt; Near the cave stood a sanctuary of [[Rumina]], goddess of breastfeeding; and the wild fig-tree ([[Ficus Ruminalis]]) to which Romulus and Remus were brought by the divine intervention of the river-god [[Tiberinus (god)|Tiberinus]]; some Roman sources name the wild fig tree ''caprificus'', literally "goat fig". Like the cultivated fig, its fruit is pendulous, and the tree exudes a milky sap if cut, which makes it a good candidate for a cult of breastfeeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vuković|first1=Krešimir|date=10 November 2017|title=The Topography of the Lupercalia|url=|journal=Papers of the British School at Rome|volume=86|page=4|pages=|doi=10.1017/S0068246217000381|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Priesthoods===
The Lupercalia had its own [[Religion in ancient Rome#Public priesthoods and religious law|priesthood]], the ''Luperci'' ("brothers of the wolf"), whose institution and rites were attributed either to the Arcadian culture-hero [[Evander of Pallene|Evander]], or to Romulus and Remus, erstwhile shepherds who had each established a group of followers. The ''Luperci'' were young men (''iuvenes''), usually between the ages of 20 and 40. They formed two religious ''[[Collegium (ancient Rome)|collegia]]'' (associations) based on ancestry; the ''Quinctiliani'' (named after [[gens]] [[Quinctia (gens)|Quinctia)]] and the ''Fabiani'' (named after ''gens'' [[Fabius|Fabia]]). Each college was headed by a ''magister''. In 44 BC, a third college, the ''Juliani'', was instituted in honor of [[Julius Caesar]]; its first ''magister'' was [[Mark Antony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vuković|first1=Krešimir|title="Roman Myth and Ritual: the Groups of Luperci and Epigraphic Evidence"|journal=Epigraphica|volume=78|pages=43–52|url=https://www.academia.edu/27195009/Groups_of_Luperci_and_Epigraphic_Evidence.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college of ''Juliiani'' disbanded or lapsed during Caesar's civil wars, and was not re-established in the reforms of his successor, [[Augustus]]. In the Imperial era, membership of the two traditional ''collegia'' was opened to ''iuvenes'' of [[Equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] status.

===Sacrifice===
At the Lupercal altar, a male goat (or goats) and a dog were sacrificed by one or another of the ''Luperci'', under the supervision of the [[Flamen dialis]], [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]'s chief priest.&lt;ref&gt;One of Plutarch's ''[[Roman Questions]]'' was "68. Why do the Luperci sacrifice a dog?"... [Because] "nearly all the Greeks used a dog as the sacrificial victim for ceremonies of purification; and some, at least, make use of it even to this day. They bring forth for [[Hecate]] puppies along with the other materials for purification." ([http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Roman_Questions*/C.html#68 on-line text in English]).&lt;/ref&gt; An offering was also made of salted mealcakes, prepared by the [[Vestal Virgin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[T. P. Wiseman]], "The God of the Lupercal", ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', Vol. 85 (1995), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; After the blood sacrifice, two ''Luperci'' approached the altar. Their foreheads were anointed with blood from the sacrificial knife, then wiped clean with [[wool]] soaked in [[milk]], after which they were expected to smile and/or laugh.

The sacrificial feast followed, after which the Luperci cut thongs (known as ''{{lang|la|februa}}'') from the flayed skin of the victim,&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; and ran with these, naked or near-naked, along the old Palatine boundary, in an anticlockwise direction around the hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vuković|first1=Krešimir|date=|title=The Topography of the Lupercalia|url=|journal=Papers of the British School at Rome|volume=86|pages=9–21|doi=10.1017/S0068246217000381|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Plutarch]]'s description of the Lupercalia, written during the early [[Roman empire|Empire]],
&lt;blockquote&gt;...many of the noble youths and of the magistrates run up and down through the city naked, for sport and laughter striking those they meet with shaggy thongs. And many women of rank also purposely get in their way, and like children at school present their hands to be struck, believing that the [[pregnant]] will thus be helped in [[Childbirth|delivery]], and the barren to pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#61 Plutarch • Life of Caesar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''Luperci'' completed their circuit of the Palatine, then returned to the ''Lupercal'' cave.

==History==
The Februa was ancient and possibly [[Sabines|Sabine]]. After the month of [[February (Roman month)|February]] was added to the [[Roman calendar]], Februa occurred on its fifteenth day (''{{lang|la|a.d. XV Kal. Mart.}}''). Of its various rituals, the most important came to be those of the Lupercalia.&lt;ref name="Franklin1921"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alberta Mildred Franklin|title=The Lupercalia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AGVbAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA79|year=1921|pages=79–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans themselves attributed the instigation of the Lupercalia to [[Evander of Pallene|Evander]], a culture hero from [[Arcadia]] who was credited with bringing the Olympic pantheon, Greek laws and alphabet to Italy, where he founded the city of [[Pallantium]] on the future site of Rome, 60 years before the [[Trojan War]].

Lupercalia was celebrated in parts of Italy and Gaul; ''Luperci'' are attested by inscriptions at [[Velletri|Velitrae]], [[Palestrina#Ancient Praeneste|Praeneste]], [[Nemausus]] (modern Nîmes) and elsewhere. The ancient cult of the Hirpi Sorani ("wolves of Soranus", from Sabine hirpus "wolf"), who practiced at [[Monte Soratte|Mt. Soracte]], {{convert|45|km|abbr=on}} north of Rome, had elements in common with the Roman Lupercalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.academia.edu/2177407/The_Hirpi_Sorani_and_the_Wolf_Cults_of_Central_Italy|title= The Hirpi Sorani and the Wolf Cults of Central Italy|work= Arctos. Acta Philologica Fennica|publisher= Klassillis-filologinen yhdistys|accessdate= 2016-08-18|author= Mika Rissanen }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Descriptions of the Lupercalia festival of 44 BC attest to its continuity; [[Julius Caesar]] used it as the backdrop for his staged public refusal of a golden crown (i.e. a [[diadem]]), offered to him by [[Mark Antony]].&lt;ref&gt;Roller, Duane W. (2010). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EZo6DwAAQBAJ Cleopatra: a biography]''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|9780195365535}}, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christian Meier (trans. David McLintock), ''Caesar'', Basic Books, New York, 1995, p.477.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lupercal cave was restored or rebuilt by [[Augustus]], and has been speculated as identical with a grotto discovered in 2007, {{convert|50|ft|m}} below the remains of Augustus' residence; according to scholarly consensus, the grotto is a [[nymphaeum]], not the Lupercal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vuković|first1=Krešimir|date=|title=The Topography of the Lupercalia|url=|journal=Papers of the British School at Rome|volume=86|pages=7–9|doi=10.1017/S0068246217000381|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lupercalia festival is marked on a [[calendar of 354]] alongside traditional and Christian festivals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/chronography_of_354_06_calendar.htm Calendar of Philocalus, tertullian.org] (accessed 15 February 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the banning in 391 of all non-Christian cults and festivals, Lupercalia was celebrated by the nominally Christian populace on a regular basis, into the reign of the emperor [[Anastasius I Dicorus|Anastasius]]. [[Pope Gelasius I]] (494&amp;ndash;96), claimed that only the "vile rabble" were involved in the festival,&lt;ref&gt;''ad viles trivialesque personas, abiectos et infimos''. (Gelasius)&lt;/ref&gt; and sought its forceful abolition; the senate protested that the Lupercalia was essential to Rome's safety and well-being. This prompted Gelasius' scornful suggestion that "If you assert that this rite has salutary force, celebrate it yourselves in the ancestral fashion; run nude yourselves that you may properly carry out the mockery."&lt;ref&gt;Gelasius, ''Epistle to Andromachus'', quoted in Green 1931:65.&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is no contemporary evidence to support the popular notions that Gelasius abolished the Lupercalia, or that he, or any other prelate, replaced it with the [[Feast of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;Green, William W., "The Lupercalia in the Fifth Century", ''Classical Philology'', Vol. 26, No. 1 (Jan., 1931), pp. 60-69, Publiched by The University of Chicago Press, available at [[JSTOR]] (subscription required), Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/264682&lt;/ref&gt; A literary association between Lupercalia and the romantic elements of [[Saint Valentine's Day]] dates back to [[Chaucer]], and poetic traditions of [[courtly love]].&lt;ref name="Ansgar1986"&gt;Henry Ansgar Kelly, in "Chaucer and the Cult of Saint Valentine" (Leiden: Brill) 1986, pp. 58-63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaylor2006"&gt;{{citation |title=Secreted Desires: The Major Uranians: Hopkins, Pater and Wilde |author=Michael Matthew Kaylor |publisher=[[Masaryk University]] (re-published in electronic format) |year=2006 |isbn=978-80-210-4126-4 |edition=electronic |page=footnote 2 in page 235 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=-Wa7SIsAQgAC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;dq=saint+valentine's+day+lupercalia&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oruch1981"&gt;Jack B.

==Legacy==
[[File:CaesarRefusesTheDiademRidpathdrawing.jpg|thumb|''Caesar Refuses the Diadem'' (1894), when it was offered by Mark Antony during the Lupercalia]]
[[Horace]]'s Ode III, 18 alludes to the Lupercalia. The festival or its associated rituals gave its name to the [[Roman calendar|Roman month]] of [[February (Roman month)|February]] (''{{lang|la|mensis Februarius}}'') and thence to the [[February|modern month]]. The [[Roman pantheon|Roman god]] [[Februus]] personified both the month and purification, but seems to postdate both.

[[William Shakespeare]]'s play [[Julius Caesar (play)|''Julius Caesar'']] begins during the Lupercalia. [[Mark Antony]] is instructed by Caesar to strike his wife [[Calpurnia (wife of Caesar)|Calpurnia]], in the hope that she will be able to conceive.

The '''Lyceum''' is a 1068-seat [[theatre]] in the [[Sheffield|City of Sheffield]], [[England]].

==History==
There has been a theatre on the site since 1879 when the Grand Varieties Theatre was built. Made of wood and originally intended to be used as a circus, the theatre was managed by the parents of the music hall comedian [[Dan Leno]] in 1883, who regularly performed there in the early stages of his career. Leno's lease came to an end in 1884 and the theatre burnt down in 1893. This was replaced by City Theatre but this was demolished six years later to make way for what is now the Lyceum.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, pp. 46 - 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Built to a traditional [[proscenium arch]] design, the Lyceum is the only surviving theatre outside [[London]] designed by the theatre architect [[W.G.R. Sprague]] and the last example of an [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] auditorium in Sheffield. The statue on top of the Lyceum Theatre is [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], son of [[Zeus]] and [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]].

By the late 1950s, the Lyceum was experiencing financial difficulties and by 1966 bingo callers were keeping the rumoured threat of demolition at bay. The theatre closed in 1969 and, despite being granted [[listed building|Grade II listed status]] in 1972, planning permission was sought for its demolition in 1975. The building was saved in part due to campaigning by the Hallamshire Historic Buildings Society.

Over the years the building changed ownership many times, being used variously as a bingo hall and a rock concert venue. By the 1980s, the interior was in a state of disrepair. The theatre was bought by two Sheffield businessmen in 1985, with financial support from Sheffield City Council, and it was reclassified to Grade II* listed status. Between 1988 and 1990 the Lyceum was completely restored at a cost of £12&amp;nbsp;million.

The theatre reopened in 1990 and now serves as a venue for touring [[West End theatre|West End]] productions, as well as locally produced shows. It is part of the [[Sheffield Theatres]] complex with the neighbouring [[Crucible Theatre]] and the [[Studio Theatre (Sheffield)|Crucible Studio]].

==Home of pantomime==

The Lyceum presents one of Sheffield's annual Christmas pantomimes. For many years the pantomime attracted prominent actors and variety turns and visiting producers in the months between Christmas Eve and Easter. In the 1940s, the Lyceum began to produce its own pantomime and was soon bringing in stars of radio such as [[Morecambe and Wise]], [[Harry Secombe]] and [[Frankie Howerd]].

However, closure of the Lyceum meant that after the final pantomime performance in March 1969, Sheffield's pantomimes took place in the neighbouring [[Crucible Theatre|Crucible]]. The pantomime returned to the Lyceum in 1990s, as touring production companies were now using the venue.

In 2007, [[Sheffield Theatres]] replaced the touring companies by starting co-production with Evolution Pantomimes. Their first show ''[[Cinderella]]'' was followed by ''[[Aladdin]]'' in 2008 and ''[[Snow White|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' in 2009.

'''Elaine O'Hara''' (17 March 1976 – c. 22 August 2012), was an Irish childcare worker, and was last seen alive at a public park in [[Shankill, Dublin#Shanganagh House|Shanganagh, Dublin]] on 22 August 2012. The remains of her body were discovered on [[Killakee]] Mountain, south of Dublin, in September 2013. The investigation of her disappearance, and later of her death, was widely reported. The 2015 trial and conviction of her murderer, [[architect]] Graham Dwyer, led to the circulation of evidence concerning O'Hara's and Dwyer's involvement in the [[BDSM]] sexual subculture.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://casefilepodcast.com/case-87-elaine-ohara/|title=Case 87: Elaine O’Hara - Casefile: True Crime Podcast|date=2018-06-16|work=Casefile: True Crime Podcast|access-date=2018-08-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence of Dwyer's sadistic sexual practices led to the murder being called one of the most shocking crimes in Irish history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herald.ie/opinion/columnists/gerry-ocarroll-dwyers-depravity-shocked-the-whole-nation-so-life-must-mean-life-for-him-31109455.html "Dwyer's depravity shocked the whole nation", ''The Herald'', 01 April 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disappearance===
O'Hara went missing from her home on August 22, 2012,&lt;ref name=ii-terrified-elaines-texts-on-the-day-she-went-missing&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/graham-dwyer-trial-terrified-elaines-texts-on-the-day-she-went-missing-31060224.html|title=Graham Dwyer Trial: Terrified Elaine’s texts on the day she went missing|publisher=[[Irish Independent]]|last1=Stack|first1=Sarah|last2=Phelan|first2=Andrew|last3=McDonald|first3=Dearbhail}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was initially assumed she had disappeared while volunteering at the 2012 [[Tall Ships' Races]]. Inside her house, however, she had left her bag, purse, and mobile phone, and security footage showed her leaving her home with a different phone. She was last seen by a jogger in Shanaganagh Park in the county of [[Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown]] just to the south of [[Shankill, Dublin|Shankill]].&lt;ref name=ii-terrified-elaines-texts-on-the-day-she-went-missing/&gt; It was later determined that she had gone to [[Shanganagh Cemetery]], where her mother was buried.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A woman was heard crying loudly in the graveyard by a witness. The witness saw the woman, fitting O'Hara's general description, crying beside an old [[grave]], but could not positively identify her as O'Hara.&lt;ref&gt;"Dwyer trial: defence concludes after three witnesses heard", ''The Irish Times'', Apr 28, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Her car was later found nearby,&lt;ref name = "grah"/&gt; and it was assumed she had, given her psychological history, committed suicide by jumping off the nearby cliffs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Discovery of evidence ===
On 10 September 2013, three days before the eventual discovery of O'Hara's body, anglers William Fegan, his brother, and another man spotted a bag lying in the water in [[Vartry Reservoir]], near [[Roundwood]], Co. Wicklow.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rte-dwyer-dtrial-hears-garda-found-elaine-oharas-keys-in-lake"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2015/0129/676417-dwyer-trial/|title=Dwyer trial hears garda found Elaine O'Hara's keys in lake|date=30 January 2015|publisher=[[RTÉ News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally, the depth of water at the bridge where evidence was found was {{convert|15|ft|m}}  to {{convert|20|ft|m}}, but in 2013, following a long hot period, it was as shallow as {{convert|12|in|cm}} to {{convert|18|in|cm}}, exposing the items which would have otherwise been underwater.&lt;ref name="rte-dwyer-dtrial-hears-garda-found-elaine-oharas-keys-in-lake" /&gt; Inside the bag they found handcuffs, clothing, a ball gag, restraints, and leg restraints.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The following day, Fegan handed the items he had found in to Roundwood Garda station.&lt;ref name="rte-dwyer-dtrial-hears-garda-found-elaine-oharas-keys-in-lake" /&gt; Garda James O'Donoghue went to where the items were found on several occasions and on 16 September found handcuffs, keys, a leather mask, a knife, an inhaler and a chain with a ring on it.&lt;ref name="rte-dwyer-dtrial-hears-garda-found-elaine-oharas-keys-in-lake" /&gt; A [[Dunnes Stores]] loyalty card found attached to the keyring was identified as belonging to O'Hara.&lt;ref name="rte-dwyer-dtrial-hears-garda-found-elaine-oharas-keys-in-lake" /&gt; The [[Garda Water Unit]] searched the lake on 17 September and 7 October 2013, finding two [[Nokia]] mobile phones, two mobile phone batteries, a pair of glasses and sunglasses, as well as a rucksack.&lt;ref name="rte-dwyer-dtrial-hears-garda-found-elaine-oharas-keys-in-lake" /&gt; A number on the frame of the glasses and the prescription matched the records for O'Hara in a branch of [[Specsavers]] in Dún Laoghaire.&lt;ref name="rte-dwyer-dtrial-hears-garda-found-elaine-oharas-keys-in-lake" /&gt;

=== Discovery of body ===
Dog trainer Magali Vergnet regularly walked dogs on wooded land near Kilakee in the foothills of the [[Dublin Mountains]].&lt;ref name=rte-dog-trainer-tells-of-finding-oharas-remains&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2015/0127/675932-graham-dwyer-trial/|title=Dog trainer tells of finding O'Hara's remains|publisher=[[RTÉ News]]|date=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting on August 21, 2013, one of her dogs would regularly disappear and return with some bones during their walk, which Vergnet first believed were from an animal.&lt;ref name=rte-dog-trainer-tells-of-finding-oharas-remains/&gt; On 13 September 2013, the same dog again retrieved more bones, this time accompanied by clothing.&lt;ref name=rte-dog-trainer-tells-of-finding-oharas-remains/&gt; Concerned that these may be human, she contacted the landowner, Frank Doyle.&lt;ref name=rte-dog-trainer-tells-of-finding-oharas-remains/&gt; They returned to the land with another man and within an isolated clearing, they found scattered and gnawed bones, including the remains of a rib-cage and jawbone. Realising the remains were human, they contacted the Gardai.&lt;ref name=rte-dog-trainer-tells-of-finding-oharas-remains/&gt; Only 65 percent of her skeleton was recovered, and O'Hara's body was later identified through dental records.&lt;ref name="si-graham-dwyer-trial-hears-extraordinary-claims"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/graham-dwyer-trial-hears-extraordinary-claims-of-sexual-manipulation-abuse-blood-and-murder-30934948.html|title=Graham Dwyer trial hears extraordinary claims of sexual manipulation, abuse, blood and murder|last=Sheehan|first=Maeve|date=25 Jan 2015|publisher=[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
Police discovered that in late 2007, O'Hara had visited fetish adult sex website Alt.com under the profile name ''helpmelearn36/F'' and viewed the profile of ''architect72'', which was linked to a Gmail address named ''fetishboy''.&lt;ref name=ii-profile-elaine-o-hara/&gt; Police linked these to Graham Dwyer, an architect.&lt;ref name=si-graham-dwyer-nearly-committed-perfect-murder&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/graham-dwyer-nearly-committed-the-perfect-murder-court-hears-30930551.html|title=Graham Dwyer nearly committed 'the perfect murder', court hears|publisher=[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]|date=23 Jan 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=southern-star-graham-dwyer-nothing-of-note&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.southernstar.ie/News/GRAHAM-DWYER-Nothing-of-note-in-his-West-Cork-childhood-to-predict-such-a-sordid-path-02042015.htm|title=GRAHAM DWYER: Nothing of note in his West Cork childhood to predict such a sordid path|last=Cronin|first=Siobhán|publisher=[[The Southern Star (County Cork)|The Southern Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence emerged that Dwyer and O'Hara had embarked on a sexual relationship that involved bondage, violence and knives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The relationship was very intense throughout 2008. Violent homemade sex videos and fragments of emails were retrieved from their laptops.&lt;ref name="ii-profile-elaine-o-hara" /&gt;

Their relationship dwindled, but was rekindled in March 2011 when Dwyer contacted O'Hara through a prepaid mobile phone.&lt;ref name=ii-graham-dwyer-murder-trial-alleged-text-from-accused/&gt; Dwyer had a mobile phone number which began with 083, and both he and O'Hara had mobile phones with numbers that began 086.&lt;ref name=si-graham-dwyer-trial-hears-extraordinary-claims/&gt; Recovered texts, from the discarded but still operational Nokia phones, sent by Dwyer (under the name "Master") to O'Hara (as "Slave") during this period included:{{Quote|text=I want to stick my knife in flesh while I am sexually aroused… I would like to stab a girl to death some time.|sign=Graham Dwyer|source=Text from 083 phone, June 2011&lt;ref name=si-graham-dwyer-trial-hears-extraordinary-claims/&gt; }}{{Quote|text=My urge to rape, stab or kill is huge.

Dwyer did not have a history of criminality. His background suggested "nothing of note". Born on September 13, 1972 in [[Bandon, County Cork|Bandon]], Co. Cork to Sean and Susan Dwyer, he has three siblings, Mandy, Brendan and James.&lt;ref name=southern-star-graham-dwyer-nothing-of-note/&gt;  After completing secondary school, he moved to [[Dublin]] in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=southern-start-graham-dwyer-friend-saw-nothing-unusual&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/graham-dwyer-trial-childhood-friend-saw-nothing-unusual-on-night-out-with-accused-court-told-31028020.html|title=Graham Dwyer Trial: Childhood friend saw 'nothing unusual' on night out with accused, court told|publisher=[[Irish Independent]]|date=27 Feb 2015|last1=Stack|first1=Sarah|last2=Phelan|first2=Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied architecture at DIT Bolton Street, where he began a relationship with Donegal woman Emer McShea.&lt;ref name=southern-star-graham-dwyer-nothing-of-note/&gt; McShea soon became pregnant with a son.&lt;ref name=southern-star-graham-dwyer-nothing-of-note/&gt; However, McShea later testified in court that he once confided to her that he fantasised about stabbing a woman during sex, and he started to bring a kitchen knife in to their bedroom, pretending to stab her.&lt;ref name=rte-dwyers-former-partner-says-he-took-knife-to-bed&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2015/0220/681655-elaine-ohara/|title=Dwyer's former partner says he took knife to bed and pretended to stab her|publisher=[[RTÉ News]]|date=20 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; McShea and Dwyer finished their relationship in 1996 and a year later he began dating fellow architecture student Gemma Healy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/graham-dwyer-trial-wife-tells-hushed-court-about-a-life-of-suburban-bliss-31030801.html|title=Graham Dwyer trial: Wife tells hushed court about a life of suburban bliss|publisher=[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]|date=1 Mar 2015|last=O'Connor|first=Niamh}}&lt;/ref&gt; They wed in Sligo Cathedral in 2002 and five years later they moved to Kerrymount Close, Foxrock.&lt;ref name=ii-graham-dwyer-profile-of-a-cold-blooded-murderer&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/graham-dwyer-trial/graham-dwyer-profile-of-a-cold-blooded-murderer-31099978.html|title=Graham Dwyer: Profile of a cold blooded murderer|last=Stack|first=Sarah|publisher=[[Irish Independent]]|date=27 Mar 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dwyer's architecture career took off and he started work for [[A&amp;D Wejchert &amp; Partners Architects]] on Lower Baggot Street on July 2, 2001.&lt;ref name=ii-graham-dwyer-profile-of-a-cold-blooded-murderer/&gt;

He was named a director in June 2006 and was involved in a range of major developments at home, including [[Institute of Technology, Carlow|Carlow Institute of Technology]], [[Leopardstown racecourse]], and in Poland.&lt;ref name=ii-graham-dwyer-profile-of-a-cold-blooded-murderer/&gt; His hobbies included flying [[radio-controlled aircraft]] and driving luxury cars, while his wife Gemma enjoyed sailing.&lt;ref name=ii-graham-dwyer-profile-of-a-cold-blooded-murderer/&gt; However, according to information disclosed during Garda interviews, Dwyer's finances were in difficulty at the time of the murder: "I was deeply in debt. We had good prospects in 2007. We had a cottage in Rathmines, bought the house in Foxrock to renovate. Then the crash happened. Gemma lost her job and I had huge pay cuts", he had said.&lt;ref name=ii-graham-dwyer-profile-of-a-cold-blooded-murderer/&gt; His trial had heard directors at the firm had suffered a 50% pay cut since 2009, including a 21% cut in the first six months of 2011, cutting his wages to €70,000.&lt;ref name=ii-graham-dwyer-profile-of-a-cold-blooded-murderer/&gt;

==Arrest and trial==
Evidence from O'Hara's phone and laptop led to warrants to search Dwyer's house, where further evidence was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejournal.ie/graham-dwyer-timeline-1995085-Mar2015/ "The grimmest of timelines: From texts and threats to the trapping of a brutal killer Dwyer was arrested", ''The Journal'', Mar 27th 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested, and initially denied knowing O'Hara (which was refuted by security footage at O'Hara's home, and the presence of semen in her bed), and later denied murdering O'Hara. The trial opened on 22 January 2015.&lt;ref name="ii-graham-dwyer-murder-trial-alleged-text-from-accused"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/graham-dwyer-murder-trial-alleged-text-from-accused-said-i-would-like-to-stab-a-girl-to-death-some-time-30928672.html|title=Graham Dwyer Murder trial: Alleged text from accused said 'I would like to stab a girl to death some time'|date=22 Jan 2015|publisher=[[Irish Independent]]|last1=Phelan|first1=Andrew|last2=Stack|first2=Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the trial, the violent homemade sex videos and retrieved fragments of emails provided evidence of the sexual use of bondage, violence and knives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Numerous messages from O'Hara referred to Dwyer's repeated threats to stab and kill her.&lt;ref name="ii-profile-elaine-o-hara" /&gt;

Dwyer's defence council Remy Farrell argued that there was no evidence tying Dwyer to O'Hara's death. O'Hara had a history of depression and her cause of death had never been determined by pathologists. She had recently been released from a psychiatric hospital which she had entered after having suicidal thoughts. There was “not a screed of evidence in respect of the cause of death”, or even evidence that it was murder. According to Farrell, both the police and her own family had first believed that she most probably committed suicide. O'Hara's interest in the BDSM lifestyle had been known to the police since before the discovery of her body, and there were many circumstances that could have led to her death. Farrell said that the violent language used by Dwyer in his texts was proof of nothing more than his sexual fantasies.&lt;ref name = "def"&gt;"Graham Dwyer’s defence says ‘gaping chasm’ in prosecution case", ''The Irish Times'', 20 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seán Guerin [[Senior Counsel|SC]], prosecuting, said that the accumulated evidence pointed to a detailed plan by Dwyer to commit and get away with murder. Dwyer had used O'Hara's low self-esteem to manipulate her. His desire to kill a woman was well-documented in his texts. O'Hara was not a willing participant in sexual violence; she repeatedly expressed her wish “not to be stabbed” and “not to be beaten” by him. She only wanted "companionship, love and ultimately a child". Knowing she had recently been released from psychiatric hospital, Dwyer had lured her to the cemetery intending to take her to the mountains and kill her, expecting that if her body was discovered, her death would be deemed to have been [[suicide]]. But the attempt to conceal his relationship to her by hiding the mobile phones and O'Hara's personal effects was clear evidence of intent.&lt;ref name = dd&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/courts/criminal-court/dwyer-intended-to-murder-elaine-o-hara-prosecution-says-1.2146366 "Dwyer intended to murder Elaine O’Hara, prosecution says", ''The Irish Times'', 20 March, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 March 2015 Dwyer was convicted in a unanimous verdict.&lt;ref name=bbc-architect-gets-life-sentence-for-murder&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32387194|title=Graham Dwyer trial: Architect gets life sentence for murder of Elaine O'Hara|publisher=BBC News|date=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sentencing him to life imprisonment, the judge stated that he "110% agreed" with jury's decision.&lt;ref name = "grah"&gt;"Graham Dwyer guilty: Sadist architect stabbed Dublin woman Elaine O'Hara to death during sex", ''The Belfast Telegraph'', 27 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rte-graham-dwyer-found-guilty-of-o-hara-murder&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2015/0327/690094-graham-dwyer-court/|title=Graham Dwyer found guilty of murdering Elaine O'Hara|publisher=[[RTÉ News]]|date=27 Mar 2015|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury was exempted from jury duty for 30 years.&lt;ref name=rte-graham-dwyer-found-guilty-of-o-hara-murder/&gt;

==Appeal==
During and after the trial, Dwyer's legal team highlighted that the legislation covering the capture and use of the mobile phone data (relied upon by the prosecution in the trial) was invalid.&lt;ref name="appeal2015"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/courts/criminal-court/dwyer-appeal-likely-to-focus-on-phone-data-and-questioning-1.2159181 | publisher = Irish Times | date = 31 March 2015 | accessdate = 11 January 2018 | title = Dwyer appeal likely to focus on phone data and questioning }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Dwyer's legal team have claimed grounds for appeal on the basis that Ireland's Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011, in turn giving effect to the [[Data Retention Directive|European Data Retention Directive (2006/24/EC)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2011/act/3/enacted/en/html | publisher = Government of Ireland | work = Irish Statue Book | title = Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011 | date = 2011 |accessdate = 11 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was invalid - because the underlying European Directive had been struck down by the [[European Court of Justice]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/dwyer-challenge-on-mobile-phone-records-could-be-heard-by-three-judge-divisional-court-819621.html | publisher = Irish Examiner | title = Dwyer challenge on mobile phone records could be heard by three judge divisional court | date = 20 December 2017 | accessdate = 11 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/courts/high-court/graham-dwyer-seeks-legal-aid-for-challenge-to-phone-evidence-1.2606532 | title = Graham Dwyer seeks legal aid for challenge to phone evidence | publisher = Irish Times | date = 11 April 2016 |accessdate = 11 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These claims contributed to a review of how state agencies use the type of data covered by the legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/state-agencies-audited-over-access-to-phone-records-1.2733206 | publisher = Irish Times | title = State agencies audited over access to phone records | date = 25 July 2016 | accessdate = 11 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; And, if upheld, it has been reported that the appeal could impact the admissibility of the mobile phone evidence in the Dwyer case - and other cases which rely upon mobile phone data in Garda investigations.&lt;ref name="appeal2015"/&gt;

'''Operation United Shield''' was the codename of a [[military operation]], conducted 9 January to 3 March 1995, bringing a conclusion to the [[United Nations Operation in Somalia II]] (UNOSOM II). Commanded by the [[United States]], two ships of the [[Pakistan Navy]], two ships of the [[Italian Navy]] and six ships of the [[United States Navy]] formed a [[Task force#Combined Task Force|Combined Task Force]] (CTF) ensuring the safe evacuation of all [[United Nations peacekeeping|UN Peacekeeping Forces]] from [[Somalia]].

==Timeline of United Nations involvement in Somalia==
* 23 January 1992: [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 733]] imposed an [[arms embargo]] on Somalia
* 17 March 1992: [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 746]] creates [[United Nations Operation in Somalia I]] (UNOSOM I), a force composed of 50 military observers, 3,500 security personnel, up to 719 logistic support personnel, and approximately 200 international civilian staff.&lt;ref name=unosomi&gt;United Nations: [https://www.un.org/Depts/DPKO/Missions/unosomi.htm UNITED NATIONS OPERATION IN SOMALIA I]&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of UNOSOM I was:
** 1. to monitor the cease-fire in Mogadishu and help to restore order in Somalia after the dissolution of its central government
** 2. to provide security for United Nations personnel, equipment and supplies at the seaports and airports in Mogadishu
** 3. to escort deliveries of humanitarian supplies from there to distribution centers in and around Mogadishu
* 24 April 1992: [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 751]]
* 27 July 1992: [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 767]]
* 28 August 1992: [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 775]] expands the mandate and strength of UNOSOM I, tasking it with the protection of humanitarian aid convoys and distribution centers throughout Somalia. UNOSOM troop strength was increased to 4,219 troops and 50 military observers. The additional security personnel began to arrive in Mogadishu on 14 September 1992.&lt;ref name="unosomi"/&gt;
* 3 December 1992: [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 794]] approved a greatly expanded coalition of United Nations peacekeepers to be led by the United States. The reorganized force would be called [[Unified Task Force]] (UNITAF).&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Central Command: [http://www.centcom.mil/en/about-centcom/our-history/ US CENTCOM History]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 4 December 1992: U.S. President [[George H. W. Bush]] announces the commencement of [[Operation Restore Hope]], under which the United States would assume command of all U.N. forces in order to carry out the mandate of Resolution 794.&lt;ref&gt;Bush, George H., Address to the Nation on the Situation in Somalia, 4/12/92&lt;/ref&gt;
* 9 December 1992: UNITAF forces begin to arrive in Somalia on 9 December 1992 to carry out the mandate of United Nations Security Council Resolution 794.

* 5 June 1993: UNOSOM II peacekeepers fired into a mob of stone-throwing women and children who acted as a [[human shield]] to conceal one or more Somali snipers. 24 UNOSOM II troops (all of whom were Pakistanis) and about 20 Somali civilians were killed in the exchange.
* 6 June 1993: [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 837]]
* August 1994: the UN requested that the US lead a coalition to aid in the final withdrawal of UNOSOM II forces from Somalia.
* December 1994: [[POTUS]] agreed to the UN request, and directed [[United States Central Command]] to execute Operation United Shield.
* 9 January to 3 March 1995: Operation United Shield

==Background and leadership==
The political situation in Somalia deteriorated throughout 1993 and 1994, until it was determined that UN peacekeeping forces were in unacceptable jeopardy. On 10 January 1995 the [[United States Central Command]] announced that 4,000 personnel (including 2,600 [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]]) would be deployed to Somalia to assist with Operation United Shield. At that time, the UNOSOM II peacekeeping force remaining in Somalia was a combined force of approximately 2,500 troops, from Pakistan and Bangladesh. The [[United Nations Security Council]] established 31 March 1995 as the deadline for the departure of all its forces participating in U.N. operations in Somalia.&lt;ref name=globalsec /&gt;

[[Anthony Zinni|LtGen Anthony Zinni]] (Commanding General, [[I Marine Expeditionary Force]]) was given command of the operation, which was to ensure the safe execution of an [[Amphibious warfare (United States)|amphibious withdrawal]]. General Zinni, who served as Director for Operations for UNITAF during Operation Restore Hope in 1992-1993, knew most of the top Somali leaders at the time of Operation United Shield.

The commanders utilized a 4,000 man [[MAGTF|air-ground task force]] to cover the withdrawal and prevent further casualties, while a seaborne coalition of American, Italian, Pakistani, French, British, and Malaysian naval vessels waited just off the coast of Mogadishu to accept the withdrawing forces.

==Execution==
* 7 January 1995: LtGen Anthony Zinni (Commanding General, I Marine Expeditionary Force) assembled a Combined Task Force consisting of air, ground, naval, psychological, and special operations forces. Coalition forces from Italy, France, United Kingdom, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh joined the CTF, under LtGen Zinni's command.
* 17 January 1995: CTF headquarters flew to Singapore and embarked aboard USS Belleau Wood (LHA-3).
* 7 February 1995: USS Belleau Wood and its accompanying ships arrived on station at Mogadishu.
* 27–28 February 1995: Just before midnight, Mogadishu time, an amphibious landing began. During this operation, which lasted a little over four hours, the U.S. put a mechanized force consisting of about 1,800 US Marines and 350 Italian Marines, along with 150 pieces of military equipment ashore. These men and machines (including [[Landing Craft Utility|LCUs]] [[Light armoured vehicle|LAVs]], [[Amphibious Assault Vehicle|AAVs]], and [[Landing Craft Air Cushion|LCACs]]) were employed to rapidly secure Mogadishu International Airport and New Port (the seaport facility). The entire amphibious landing was complete by 0430 on the morning of 28 February.&lt;ref&gt;DefenseLink, U.S. Department of Defense: [http://www.defense.gov/news/Feb1995/x022895_x0228som.html UNITED SHIELD Press briefing, 28 February 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 28 February 1995: The UNOSOM II command was relieved, and the CTF began withdrawing the UNOSOM II forces.
* 3 March 1995: 73 hours after the beginning of the amphibious landing, 2,422 United Nations troops, approximately 3,800 CTF troops and over a hundred combat vehicles had been withdrawn without any loss of life among any of the coalition forces.
* 6 March 1995: the CTF redeployed to their respective home stations.
* 17 March 1995: the CTF was disestablished.

==Factors critical to the success of Operation United Shield==
By the time the [[Landing operation|Landing Force]] went ashore, the UNOSOM forces had consolidated and withdrawn to New Port and Mogadishu International Airport.&lt;ref&gt;DefenseLink, U.S. Department of Defense: [http://www.defense.gov/news/Mar1995/x030395_x0302som.html UNITED SHIELD Press briefing, 2 March 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most critical stage of Operation United Shield began when the [[ground combat element]] (GCE) of the 13th [[Marine Expeditionary Unit]] (MEU) conducted an [[amphibious landing]] on "green beach," near [[Mogadishu International Airport]]. The infantry element, Kilo Company of the 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines, (31st MEUSOC) and Battalion Landing Team 3/1, conducted their initial landing in the early morning hours of 1 March 1995,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pdhealth.mil/deployments/united_shield/background.asp Deployments - Somalia - Operation United Shield - Background]&lt;/ref&gt; and within hours the bulk of the infantry battalion had passed through the United Nation’s perimeter and secured the New Port shipping facility and an area known as "No Man's Land", between the New Port and the UN-occupied Mogadishu International Airport, north of green beach.

Two US Navy CH-53E Super Stallion Helicopters from Helicopter Combat Support Squadron Four played a vital role in placing troops in key areas throughout Mogadishu and then picking up members of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force and flying them out to the US Ships off shore.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1916">'''Poor Ellen Smith''' is a late 19th-century [[murder ballad]] recounting the shooting death of one Ellen Smith, and the trial and execution of her murderer.

The song is based on real events in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]].  In 1894, a ne'er-do-well named Peter DeGraff had a love affair with Ellen Smith, who may have been [[mentally challenged]] and was unable to understand his rejection of her.  Smith became pregnant by DeGraff, but their child died at birth.  Afterwards she began following DeGraff around town, and eventually he sent her a note that asked her to meet him in a secluded area, worded in such a way that Smith would have believed DeGraff wanted to reconcile.  Instead, when she arrived, DeGraff shot her through the chest.  He later reported that Smith's only words after being shot were "Lord have mercy on me."  DeGraff confessed to the crime on the [[gallows]], shortly before he was hanged.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/02/us/02land.html Across Generations, Traces of a Poor Maid’s Murder], February 1, 2009, [[The New York Times]], retrieved September 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The song and its variants have been performed and recorded by a range of artists including [[Tommy Jarrell]], [[Neko Case]], [[Laura Cantrell]], [[Molly O'Day (singer)|Molly O'Day]], [[Kristin Hersh]], [[Wilma Lee]] &amp; [[Stoney Cooper]], [[Jimmy Martin]], the [[Stanley Brothers]], [[Ralph Stanley]] &amp; [[Larry Sparks]], the [[Kossoy Sisters]], [[The Country Gentlemen|Country Gentlemen]], [[John Hartford]], [[The Kingston Trio]], [[Crooked Still]], [[Robert Earl Keen]] and [[Wussy]].
The plot was also adapted by German Folk-Metal band [[Subway to Sally]] in their song "Arme Ellen Schmitt".

The '''Prizren Incident''' was a confrontation between German [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR) troops advancing into Kosovo and stragglers from the withdrawing [[Military of Serbia and Montenegro|Yugoslav Army]]. The shootout took place in the city of [[Prizren]], on 13 June 1999. The German troops killed one armed Serb, and left another seriously wounded. A German soldier was injured, and there were reports of a woman wounded by Serb snipers.&lt;ref name="snp" /&gt;

==Background==
On 12 June 1999, two days after the approval of [[UN Security Council Resolution 1244]], [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR) personnel began to arrive in Kosovo to stop further hostilities between ethnic [[Albanians]] and [[Serbs]] and to coordinate efforts to secure the distribution of [[humanitarian aid]].&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan Lowe, Adam Roberts, Jennifer Welsh, Dominik Zaum (2008).

Oxford University Press, p. 591. {{ISBN|0191538582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival of the German troops===
In the early hours of 13 June about 100 German soldiers arrived in [[Prizren]] from [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] to secure the city for another 600 incoming troop that entered at afternoon from [[Albania]], {{convert|10|mi}} to the west. Earlier, a [[Military of Serbia and Montenegro|Yugoslav Army]] outpost at Vrbnica border crossing, recently vacated by 60 soldiers, was looted and vandalized.&lt;ref name="george"&gt;"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/balkans/stories/prizren061499.htm Happy Throng Assails Lingering Serbs]" by John Ward Anderson and Peter Finn. The Washington Post, 14 June 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The German soldiers were received as liberators by the ethnic Albanian inhabitants.&lt;ref name="break"&gt;Fletcher, Martin (2008).''Breaking News: A Memoir''. Macmillan, pp. 201–202. {{ISBN|1429974869}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of their first tasks was to separate a crowd of Albanian civilians and Yugoslav troops by forming a human line, after the former pelted a convoy of civilian Serbs leaving the city. There was a tense standoff, but eventually a German officer managed to convince the Serbs to withdraw.&lt;ref name="george" /&gt; At the Morinë border cross, German troops compelled the Serbs to leave the outpost according to schedule when the latter tried to win more time.&lt;ref name="la"&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jun/17/news/mn-47462 German Force Savors 'Moral' Postwar Debut] by Mrjorie Miller. Los Angeles Times, 17 June 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shooting incident==
As the German troops drove into downtown, along the [[Prizren Bistrica|Bistrica river]], they were met by sniper fire from one of the surrounding hills and some houses; they were also allegedly fired at from a [[Roman Catholic]] church. The soldiers took cover and returned fire. A civilian woman was reportedly wounded by the snipers, while the German troops moved to defensive positions below the hill.&lt;ref name="snp"&gt;"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&amp;dat=19990614&amp;id=vHpaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1R4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6559,5865079 German troops met by snipers at Prizren]". Associated Press, 14 June 1999&lt;/ref&gt; A German fighting vehicle fired a warning burst with a general-purpose [[Rheinmetall MG 3]] machine gun at a passing Yugoslav army truck after a Yugoslav soldier inside branded an [[AK-47]] assault rifle at a jeering Albanian crowd and fired two shots in the air.&lt;ref name="george" /&gt;

At dusk, a yellow [[Zastava Skala]] civilian-type vehicle was seen approaching a German armored carrier outside Hotel Theranda, in the center of the city. The passenger produced an AK-47 and opened fire at the carrier and at bystanders, who fled for safety. The German soldiers in the armored vehicle, supported by a [[Leopard 2 tank]], shot back.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Three paratroopers fired at the car with their [[Heckler &amp; Koch G36]] assault rifles, joined by a [[non-commissioned officer]] with his 9mm pistol and by turret-mounted 7.62mm machine guns.&lt;ref&gt;Russel, Richard Lawrence (2012).'' The Mammoth Book of Special Ops''. Constable &amp; Robinson, p. 109. {{ISBN|1780336985}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The combined gunfire killed the driver and wounded the shooter. A German soldier in the armored carrier was injured in the arm,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9906/14/kosovo.01/ NATO forces find possible mass grave in Kosovo].

The Guardian, 14 April 1999
&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the first casualty of the overall peacekeeping operation.&lt;ref name="george" /&gt; The German firepower was so intense that it pushed the car backward. Some sources claim that the passenger also died of his wounds.&lt;ref name="break" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s28928.htm Russian stand-off and Serb snipers take gloss off Kosovo peace deal].

''Soldiers and Civil Power: Supporting Or Substituting Civil Authorities in Modern Peace Operations''. Amsterdam University Press, p. 298. {{ISBN|9053567925}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The shooting lasted 20 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-56766596.html Flowers Turn to Bullets in Prizren: German Troops Kill Attacking Serb], by Philip Smuckler. The Washington Times, 14 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans said that the two individuals in the car, both Serbs, were carrying grenades and semi-automatic weapons.&lt;ref name="snp" /&gt;

==Aftermath==
The commander of the KFOR brigade in Prizren, General Fritz von Korff said: "Although we may not have everything under control at present, we have enough presence in the town to believe there will be a safe (Yugoslav) withdrawal." He also warned that Prizren was still a "dangerous place".&lt;ref name="snp" /&gt;

Armed Serb civilians set an improvised checkpoint outside the town, but it was largely ignored by the Germans, who passed through it several times. The retreating Yugoslav army personnel also manned a number of checkpoints, in violation of the agreement reached with [[NATO]].&lt;ref name="george" /&gt; More than ten days into the arrival of KFOR troops, turmoil and killings among the civilian population continued to spread, to the point that the German commander imposed a curfew from midnight until 5 a.m.&lt;ref name="la" /&gt;

A '''random checkpoint''' is a [[military]] and [[police]] [[Military tactics|tactic]]. In a military context, checkpoints involve the setup of a hasty [[roadblock]] by mobile truck- or [[armored vehicle]]-mounted [[infantry]] to disrupt unauthorized or unwanted movement or military activity&lt;ref name=GlobalSecurity&gt;{{cite web|title=Checkpoints|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|accessdate=5 December 2007|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/call/call_93-8_chap9.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to check for valid identification and search for [[contraband]], [[fugitive]]s, or [[weapons]] that are not permitted in civilian hands. Random checkpoints are set up to achieve surprise, as opposed to known permanently located checkpoints, which suspects could circumvent. They are often established in locations where they cannot be observed by approaching [[traffic]] until it is too late to withdraw and escape without being observed.&lt;ref name=un&gt;[http://www2.apan-info.net/gpoi/documents/01a_UN%20CHECKPOINT%20OPERATIONS.ppt UN Checkpoint operations]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Patrol car]]-equipped police units regularly use random checkpoints to detect drivers who are suspected of [[impaired driving]]. Police also use hastily set up roadblocks to check cars and car trunks when they are pursuing an armed and dangerous fugitive.  As with military checkpoints, sobriety checkpoints and fugitive roadblock searches are located in an area where drivers cannot see the checkpoint until it is too late to withdraw, and checkpoints are only set up on a temporary basis.

The unit establishing a military checkpoint must carry or obtain the materials necessary to construct it. It might use a large [[vehicle]], or multiple vehicles, such as [[armored personnel carrier]]s to block the road. In addition to blocking the road with vehicles, the road may also be partially blocked with [[concertina wire]] or heavy objects, such as sandbags or concrete blocks. The vehicles might be positioned to partially or entirely block the road or route. The search area might be the space between multiple vehicles. [[wikt:sentry|Sentries]] might be positioned at each end of the checkpoint and are covered by mounted or dismounted [[machine gun]] positions. A reaction force may be designated and concealed nearby.&lt;ref name=un/&gt;

Vehicular and pedestrian traffic that approach with the intent of passing flying checkpoints can be asked to produce [[Identity document|identification]] and submit to a search of their persons or vehicle. The trunks of cars are typically searched. In some countries, soldiers inspect the bottom of the car with a mirror to look for bombs. In some cases, people without proper identification or who arouse suspicion may be refused passage, [[detention (imprisonment)|detained]], or [[arrest]]ed. [[Contraband]] may be confiscated.&lt;ref name=Bonn/&gt;
A random checkpoint must be functional within 15 minutes of the unit's arrival on-site, and establish [[security]] teams 50–100 meters on both sides of the area to be controlled. Advanced observation posts may also be positioned further out if desired.&lt;ref name=Bonn&gt;''Guide to Military Operations Other Than War: Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Stability &amp; Support Operations'', Keith Earle Bonn, Anthony E. Baker, pp.113–115&lt;/ref&gt; When large geographical areas need to be monitored, some types of checkpoint may be quickly airlifted by helicopter from one location to another.&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0207/08/ltm.11.html Afghan Allies Hunt Assassins] [[CNN]], July 8, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Flying roadblocks and checkpoints are usually established for no more than a few hours, in order to decrease the possibility of [[Insurgency|insurgent]] attacks on them, as well as to maintain their effectiveness as a surprising, unexpected obstacle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-07-22/app-c.htm|title=FMI 3-07.22 Appendix C Population and Resources Control|author=John Pike|work=globalsecurity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Random checkpoints are a common tactic used by many military forces, and have been recently used by [[UN]] forces in [[Kosovo]], [[Israel Defense Forces checkpoint|the Israeli army]] in the [[West Bank]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N_4nCsqYHr0C&amp;pg=PA29|title=Breaching the Fortress Wall: Understanding Terrorist Efforts to Overcome Defensive Technologies|last=Jackson|first=Brian A.|last2=Chalk|first2=Peter|last3=Cragin|first3=Kim|last4=Newsome|first4=Bruce|last5=Parachini|first5=John V.|last6=Cragin|first6=R.

In some war zones, soldiers working at these checkpoints can be severely injured or killed if one of the vehicles they are searching contains a [[suicide bomber]] who detonates his or her bomb or if one of the occupants fires upon soldiers.

== Sobriety checkpoints ==
[[Image:Polizeikontrolle Rügendamm.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sobriety checkpoints set up by the [[Policing in Germany|German Police]].]]

Sobriety checkpoints or roadblocks involve law enforcement officials stopping every vehicle (or more typically, every ''n''th vehicle) on a public roadway and investigating the possibility that the driver might be too [[Impaired driving|impaired to drive]] due to [[ethanol|alcohol]] or [[drug]] consumption. They are often set up late at night or in the very early morning hours and on weekends, and on holidays associated with parties (e.g., [[New Year's Eve]]) at which time the proportion of impaired drivers tends to be the highest. Checkpoints are also often set near the exit points of public events where people have been drinking to prevent large numbers of drunk drivers from being released into traffic simultaneously from the event.{{cn|date=May 2016}} A roadblock stop is quick action spot for police as well as security personnel.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

With a portable and quick [[Breathalyzer]] test, the police can test all drivers (if the law permits) for their breath alcohol content (BrAC), and process the cars one by one as if in a conveyor belt. If a police force does not have these testing devices, a more complicated routine is necessary. Upon suspicion that the driver has consumed alcohol, due to the officer noting the smell of alcohol, slurred speech, or other signs, the stopped driver is required to exit the vehicle and asked to take a series of roadside [[field sobriety testing|field sobriety tests (FSTs or SFSTs)]]. These tests help the officer to determine whether the person's physical and/or mental skills are impaired. If the officer determines based on his/her observations during the tests that the driver is impaired and has [[probable cause]] to arrest the person for suspicion of driving under the influence, the arrestee will be asked to take an alcohol breath test or a blood test. It is important to note that the driver cannot "pass" or "fail" a field sobriety test as they are not "pass-or-fail", they are only meant to aid the officer in determining if a suspect is impaired based on observations of the subject's performance on these tests. There are various guidelines are presented by the various states (US) as well as International rules for these type Sobriety Checkpoints or DUI.{{cn|date=March 2017}}  For example, in the U.S. [[field sobriety testing|Field sobriety tests (FSTs or SFSTs)]] are voluntary.&lt;ref name="michiganlive"&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2011/08/law_talk_should_drivers_refuse.html Law Talk: Should drivers refuse road-side drunk tests?], Michigan Live&lt;/ref&gt; 

While the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] (1791) protects people against unreasonable [[search and seizure|searches and seizures]] of either self or [[property]] by government officials,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Monk |first= Linda |title= Amendment IV |url= http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-amendments/amendment-4-search-and-seizure |work= Annenberg Classroom |publisher= Leonore Annenberg Institute for Civics of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania |accessdate= August 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the use by police of sobriety checkpoints in the US is not prohibited by the Fourth Amendment if law enforcement posts or announces in advance that these checkpoints will occur and at what location. Law enforcement agencies often post a sign during the weekdays when it is only seen by local residents and not by those attending a special event or those that only travel in that area of the city during the weekend to patronize local bars and clubs. These announcements are also sometimes printed in newspapers. Numerous websites host a database of checkpoints that are to occur based on information found in newspapers, the Internet and tips from visitors of such sites. In the 2010s, there are smartphone apps that allow users to report sobriety checkpoints, show them on a map and use the device's [[GPS]] to alert other drivers when a sobriety checkpoint is nearby.

A popular method of catching drivers who are unfit to drive due to drugs or alcohol is to watch for people turning around as they notice the checkpoint and quickly pull them over.

Sobriety checkpoints regularly catch much more than just drunk drivers, as those selected to participate in the checkpoint are asked to provide their driver's licenses.  As part of the standard protocol, the person's name and identifying information is run through the [[National Crime Index]] database, or NCIC, for wants and warrants. If the driver has an outstanding warrant, he/she will likely be arrested.  If he/she was driving without a valid license, he/she will likely be cited for driving with a suspended or revoked license. The identity checks could also catch vehicle inspection and registration violations as well. When an individual is stopped for a sobriety check, the officer may also determine that she has [[probable cause]] to search the vehicle, which may lead to the officer finding illegal drugs or weapons.

===Australia===
[[File:WA Police Booze Bus.jpg|thumb|A [[Western Australia Police]] Booze Bus]]
In Australia, drivers may be stopped at any point along any public road by a police officer for what police term a "random breath test", commonly referred to as an "RBT".&lt;ref&gt;NSW Centre for road safety [http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/roadsafety/advertisingcampaigns/rbt/ NSW.gov.au] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023233503/http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/roadsafety/advertisingcampaigns/rbt/ |date=2009-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For an operation involving a large number of police (typically 10–20) at a fixed location, the colloquial term "booze bus" is often used. 

In July 1976, legislation allowing Random Breath Testing (RBT) came into force in the State of Victoria, with 
this being the first State in Australia to introduce such.&lt;ref&gt;www.icadtsinternational.com/files/documents/1997_126.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[New South Wales]] began its own large RBT road safety campaign in 1982. Since then, fatal crashes involving alcohol have dropped from about 40 per cent of all fatalities to the 2012 level of 15 per cent. Police conduct about 5 million breath tests each year in NSW with every police car in the State able to conduct mobile RBT.&lt;ref&gt;http://roadsafety.transport.nsw.gov.au/stayingsafe/alcoholdrugs/drinkdriving/rbt/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In all states, the maximum [[blood alcohol content]] of 0.05% is enforced.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Federal Police [http://www.afp.gov.au/act/drugs_alcohol/drink_driving.html AFP.gov.au] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018101558/http://www.afp.gov.au/act/drugs_alcohol/drink_driving.html |date=2009-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drivers who are found to have a preliminary reading of equal to or greater than 0.05% are usually arrested and taken to the police station or RBT/"booze bus" to undertake a breath analysis. The machine used to perform a breath analysis is more sophisticated than the portable device that is used to administer a roadside RBT with the results of a breath analysis being used as evidence in court to prove a drunk driving charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://longtonlegal.com.au/refusal-breath-test-breath-analysis-nsw/|title=REFUSAL OF BREATH TEST OR BREATH ANALYSIS IN NSW – longtonlegal|author=|date=|website=longtonlegal.com.au|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proceedings of the 2013 Australasian Road Safety Research, Policing &amp; Education Conference 28th – 30th August, Brisbane, Queensland&lt;/ref&gt;  the concept has been extended to make sobriety checkpoints also use "Random Drug Test (RDT) buses" (or "dual buses"), capable of testing drivers for a number of illicit drugs including [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] (tetrahydrocannabinol), [[methamphetamine]], and [[MDMA|ecstasy]] (MDMA).&lt;ref&gt;Webster, Natalie.

RBT activities even feature on a popular Australian reality television series known by the same name, [[RBT (TV series)]]. 

As of late 2017 the NSW Police Force has announced it is going to expand its mobile drug testing to include cocaine in 2018. Trials of the program will be in Sydney's eastern suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sydneycriminallawyers.com.au/blog/mdt-set-to-target-cocaine-users/|title=MDT Set to Target Cocaine Users|author=|date=|website=www.sydneycriminallawyers.com.au|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drink driving continues to be one of the main causes of road fatalities and injuries, responsible for 30 percent of road fatalities across Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sydneycriminallawyers.com.au/blog/drivers-getting-the-message-about-drink-driving/|title=Drivers Getting the Message about Drink Driving|author=|date=|website=www.sydneycriminallawyers.com.au|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In Ontario, Canada, sobriety checkpoints are referred to as [[Reduce Impaired Driving Everywhere]], commonly referred to as RIDE. In Alberta and Manitoba they are referred to as [[Check Stop]], and in British Columbia, they are known as [[Drinking Driving Counterattack]].

===United States of America===

====Legality====
The [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] states that: “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” This fundamental right has a tense relationship with sobriety checkpoints. At a sobriety checkpoint, drivers are necessarily stopped without [[reasonable suspicion]], and may be asked to be tested summarily and without [[probable cause]].  Thus the Constitution would prohibit people from being stopped without a [[search warrant]] or at least without reasonable suspicion that they have committed a crime; however, the warrant requirement only attaches should the search be unreasonable and the US Supreme Court, as shown below, decided that such stops are not unreasonable under certain circumstances.

[[Driving under the Influence]] of alcohol, or [[Drunk driving in the United States|Drunk Driving]], is a special type of crime, as driving with a [[blood alcohol content]] (BAC) over a set limit is defined as the crime; it is not necessary to drive recklessly or cause an accident in order to be convicted (although an impaired driver who also drives recklessly could face additional charges). To determine BAC accurately, it is generally necessary for the driver to subject himself to tests that are [[self incrimination|self incriminating]], and drivers sometimes exercise their right against self incrimination to refuse these tests. To discourage this, some jurisdictions set the legal penalties for refusing a BAC test to equal or worse than those for failing a BAC test. In other jurisdictions, the legal system may consider refusing the roadside alcohol breath test to be probable cause, allowing police to arrest the driver and conduct an involuntary BAC test.

The [[Michigan Supreme Court]] found sobriety roadblocks to be a violation of the Fourth Amendment. However, by a 6-3 decision'' in [[Michigan Dept. of State Police v. Sitz]]'' (1990), the [[United States Supreme Court]] found properly conducted sobriety checkpoints to be constitutional.
In the majority opinion, [[William Rehnquist|Chief Justice Rehnquist]] wrote, "In sum, the balance of the State's interest in preventing drunken driving, the extent to which this system can reasonably be said to advance that interest, and the degree of intrusion upon individual motorists who are briefly stopped, weighs in favor of the state program. We therefore hold that it is consistent with the Fourth Amendment." Dissenting justices argued against this conclusion. [[John Paul Stevens|Justice Stevens]] argued that the checkpoints were not reasonably effective, writing that "the findings of the trial court, based on an extensive record and affirmed by the [[Michigan Court of Appeals]], indicate that the net effect of sobriety checkpoints on traffic safety is infinitesimal and possibly negative." [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|Justice Brennan]]'s dissenting opinion argued that the police had failed to show that the checkpoint seizures were a necessary tool and worth the intrusion on individual privacy. "That stopping every car might make it easier to prevent drunken driving...is an insufficient justification for abandoning the requirement of individualized suspicion," he stated.

Jurisdictions that allow sobriety checkpoints often carve out specific exceptions to their normal [[civil rights|civil protections]], in order to allow sobriety checkpoints.  Although the U.S. Supreme Court has found sobriety checkpoints to be constitutionally permissible, ten states ([[Idaho]], [[Iowa]], [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]], [[Oregon]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Texas]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Wyoming]]) have found that sobriety roadblocks violate their own state constitutions or have outlawed them. One other state ([[Alaska]]) does not use checkpoints even though it has not made them illegal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.madd.org/laws/law-overview/Sobriety_Checkpoints_Overview.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Montana uses checkpoints frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kpax.com/news/3-arrests-lots-of-citations-at-billings-traffic-checkpoint/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029212551/http://www.kpax.com/news/3-arrests-lots-of-citations-at-billings-traffic-checkpoint/ |archivedate=2013-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states combine their efforts in setting up sobriety checkpoint initiatives, such as [[Checkpoint Strikeforce]], jointly run by [[Virginia]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Delaware]], [[West Virginia]], and [[Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.governor.virginia.gov/news/viewRelease.cfm?id=2010|title=Governor McDonnell Highlights 2013 Checkpoint Strikeforce Campaign|author=|date=|website=virginia.gov|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[California]], shortly after a 1984 California Attorney General’s Opinion (67 Ops Atty. Gen. 471 (1984, #84-902)), which set out what were intended to be "strict guidelines" for the legality of drunk driving roadblocks, police departments and the [[California Highway Patrol]] (CHP) began using DUI checkpoints to apprehend drunk drivers in the State of California. In ''Ingersoll v. Palmer'' (1987) 43 Cal.3d 1321, the [[California Supreme Court]] approved the use of roadblocks so long as they were carried out pursuant to the "strict guidelines" set forth by the Ingersoll Court and were operated in a manner consistent with the Federal and state Constitutions.

Aside for cases of [[Michigan Department of State Police v. Sitz|sobriety checkpoints]], [[United States v. Martinez-Fuerte|border security]] (at points of entry into USA) and fugitive apprehension, roadblocks or checkpoints for the purpose of general law enforcement are expressly unconstitutional according to ''[[City of Indianapolis v. Edmond]]'', "Because the checkpoint program's primary purpose is indistinguishable from the general interest in crime control, the checkpoints violate the Fourth Amendment." This prohibits checkpoints erected to interdict narcotics or detect evidence of other illegal activities. However, this does not prevent police departments from attempting these types of checkpoints because they can be a significant source of revenue, particularly near festival periods like college [[Spring_break#United_States|spring break]]. Many individuals that are apprehended for possession of narcotics at these checkpoints are unlikely to be fully prosecuted on those charges, but the police will collect all fees associated with the arrest before reducing the charges or dismissing them altogether.

Because of some inconsistencies between the laws and actual police practice, some individuals maintain that DUI checkpoints are violation of civil rights under the Constitution. Such checkpoints have been the subject of protests, such as individuals holding signs warning drivers "Police ahead, turn now."&lt;ref name="whioovi"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.whio.com/news/news/crime-law/ovi-checkpoint-location-set-in-dayton/nmQtC/|title=2 OVI arrests made at checkpoint in Dayton|date=May 29, 2015|accessdate=May 30, 2015|publisher=[[WHIO-TV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another instance, a driver protested by placing his license, registration and insurance information inside a plastic baggie inside his car's windshield along with a note reading "I remain silent, No searches, I want my lawyer".&lt;ref name="theblaze"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/01/03/see-this-guy-get-through-a-dui-checkpoint-without-saying-a-word-thanks-to-what-he-hung-out-his-car-window/|title=See This Guy Get Through a DUI Checkpoint Without Saying a Word — Thanks to What He Hung Out His Car Window|first=Zach|last=Noble|date=January 3, 2015|accessdate=May 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legal guidelines====

In approving "properly conducted" checkpoints, Chief Justice Rehnquist implicitly acknowledged that there must be guidelines in order to avoid having these checkpoints becoming overly intrusive.  In other words, checkpoints cannot simply be set up when, where and how police officers choose.  As often happens in Supreme Court decisions, however, the Chief Justice left it to the states to determine what those minimal safeguards must be, presumably to be reviewed by the courts on a case-by-case basis. To provide standards for use by the states, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] subsequently issued a report that reviewed recommended checkpoint procedures in keeping with federal and state legal decisions.&lt;ref&gt;"The Use of Sobriety Checkpoints for Impaired Driving Enforcement", DOT HS-807-656, Nov. 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional source of guidelines can be found in an earlier decision by the California Supreme Court, ''Ingersoll v. Palmer'' (1987) 43 Cal.3d 1321,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scocal.stanford.edu/opinion/ingersoll-v-palmer-30801|title=Ingersoll v. Palmer - 43 Cal.3d 1321  - Thu, 10/29/1987 {{!}} California Supreme Court Resources|website=scocal.stanford.edu|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein the California State Supreme Court set forth what it felt to be necessary standards in planning and administering a sobriety checkpoint.

The ''Ingersoll'' guidelines fall under the following general headings:
# Decision making at the supervisory level
# Limits on discretion of field officers
# Maintenance of safety conditions
# Reasonable location
# Time and duration
# Indicia of official nature of roadblock
# Length and nature of detention
# Advance publicity
[[Image:Sobriety checkpoint easthaven ct.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A checkpoint in the United States.]]

The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision of ''[[Michigan Department of State Police v. Sitz|Michigan Dep’t of State Police v. Sitz]]'' [[Michigan Department of State Police v. Sitz|(1990) 496 U.S. 444]], was decided after ''Ingersoll''. The U.S. Supreme Court did not criticize any of the ''Ingersoll'' guidelines, nor did it recommend any others; seemingly making it the law of the land and leaving the decision of whether to permit sobriety checkpoints to the individual states. In ''People v. Banks'' (1993) 6 Cal.4th 926, which was decided after ''Ingersoll'' and ''Sitz'', and incorporated a discussion of both cases in the opinion, the California State Supreme Court held that ''advance publicity'' is not an essential element of the constitutionally of a valid drunk driving roadblock. The Court concluded that although advance publicity remains a factor to consider, the lack of it alone does not render the roadblock unconstitutional. ''People v. Banks'' (1993) 6 Cal.4th 926.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scocal.stanford.edu/opinion/people-v-banks-31551|title=People v. Banks - 6 Cal.4th 926 S030479 - Thu, 12/23/1993 {{!}} California Supreme Court Resources|website=scocal.stanford.edu|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following considerations expand upon the general headings listed above:

*Decision making must be at a supervisory level, rather than by officers in the field.
*A neutral formula must be used to select vehicles to be stopped, such as every vehicle or every third vehicle, rather than leaving it up to the officer in the field.
*Primary consideration must be given to public and officer safety.
*The site should be selected by policy-making officials, based upon areas having a high incidence of drunk driving.
*Limitations on when the checkpoint is to be conducted and for how long, bearing in mind both effectiveness and intrusiveness.
*Warning lights and signs should be clearly visible.
*Length of detention of motorists should be minimized.
*Advance publicity is necessary to reduce the intrusiveness of the checkpoint and increase its deterrent effect.

====Effectiveness====
{{Disputed section|date=March 2014}}
There is a dearth of research regarding the deterrent effect of checkpoints.  The only formally documented research regarding deterrence is a survey of Maryland's "Checkpoint Strikeforce" program.  The survey found no deterrent effect: "To date, there is no evidence to indicate that this campaign, which involves a number of sobriety checkpoints and media activities to promote these efforts, has had any impact on public perceptions, driver behaviors, or alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes and injuries. This conclusion is drawn after examining statistics for alcohol-related crashes, police citations for impaired driving, and public perceptions of alcohol-impaired driving risk."&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Kenneth, 2009. Lessons Learned From Evaluating Maryland's Anti-Drunk Driving Campaign: Assessing the Evidence for Cognitive, Behavioral, and Public Health Impact.  Health Promotion Practice, 10: 370-377.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], in a 2002 Traffic Injury Prevention report, found that in general, the number of alcohol-related crashes was reduced by 20% in states that implement sobriety checkpoints compared to those that do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/impaired_driving/checkpoint.html |title=Research Update: Sobriety Checkpoints Are Effective in Reducing Alcohol-Related Crashes |accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''contra, see'' [https://www.ntsb.gov/safety/safety-studies/Documents/SS8401.pdf Safety Study - Deterrence of Drunk Driving, The Role of Sobriety Checkpoints and Admin. Lic. Revocations], NTIS PB84-917001, 3-Apr-1984&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Public health law|Public Health Law]] Research, an independent organization, reported in a 2009 evidence brief summarizing the research assessing the effect of a specific law or policy on public health, that there is strong evidence supporting the effectiveness of selective breath testing sobriety checkpoints as a public health intervention aimed at reducing the harms associated with alcohol impaired driving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publichealthlawresearch.org/public-health-topics/injury-prevention/accidents-involving-alcohol/evidence-brief/selective-breath-t Selective Breath Testing Sobriety Checkpoints] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515081416/http://publichealthlawresearch.org/public-health-topics/injury-prevention/accidents-involving-alcohol/evidence-brief/selective-breath-t |date=2011-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a debate regarding whether [[saturation patrol]]s or checkpoints are more effective.  The [[FBI]] did a study comparing saturation patrols vs. checkpoints in Ohio, Missouri, and Tennessee. The study showed that, “[o]verall, measured in arrests per hour, a dedicated saturation patrol is the most effective method of apprehending offenders.”&lt;ref&gt;Greene, Jeffrey W., 2003. Battling DUI: A Comparative Analysis of Checkpoints and Saturation Patrols.  FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin, 72: 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another survey found that "States with infrequent checkpoints claimed a lack of funding and police resources for not conducting more checkpoints." The survey found that some states "...preferred saturation patrols over checkpoints because they were more 'productive'", given that "... [a] large number of police officers [were used] at checkpoints."&lt;ref&gt;Fell, J.C., Ferguson, S.A., Williams, A.F., 2003.  Why are sobriety checkpoints not widely adopted as an enforcement strategy in the United States?  ''Accident Analysis and Prevention'', 35: 897-902.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Controversy ====
In May 2015, a ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' study found that between 2010 and 2014, a majority of sobriety checks in [[Chicago]] were conducted in [[African American|black]] and [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] neighborhoods, despite some [[White American|white]] neighborhoods ranking among those with the highest number of alcohol-related traffic accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Byrne|first1=John|title=Emanuel mum on Chicago police DUI checkpoints in minority areas|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-emanuel-dui-checkpoints-met-0512-20150511-story.html|website=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fugitive roadblocks==
Police also use hastily set up roadblocks to check cars and car trunks when they are pursuing an armed and dangerous fugitive, such as an escaped maximum security prisoner or a suspected [[armed robber]] or [[murderer]] who is believed to be fleeing from police. Police at such a checkpoint may be armed with shotguns, submachine guns or semiautomatic carbines, in addition to their duty sidearms, depending on the laws and regulations in a jurisdiction. When setting up these types of roadblocks, police in some jurisdiction have the authorization to lay a [[spike strip]] across the road, to prevent suspects from trying to drive through the roadblock.

'''Samuel Parker''', known as '''Kamuela Parker''' (June 23, 1853 – March 19, 1920) was a major landowner and businessman on the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawaii]], heir to the [[Parker Ranch]] estate. He was also a leading political figure at a critical time of the history of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]], serving in its last cabinet.

==Background and early life==
Samuel Parker was born on June 23, 1853. His paternal grandfather, [[John Palmer Parker (rancher)|John Palmer Parker]] (1790–1868), was a member of the eponymous [[Parker House Hotel]] family. John Parker was born in [[Boston, Mass.|Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], but settled in the [[Hawaiian Islands]]. He founded the Hawaiian branch of the family when he married Chiefess Kipikane (1800–1860), who was related to the high-ranking chiefs of the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]]. John's younger son, and Samuel's father, was Ebenezer Parker (1829–1855). Ebenezer Parker also married a Hawaiian woman, Kilia Nahulanui, on June 7, 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ulukau.org/gsdl2.7/cgi-bin/algene?e=q-0algene--00CL1--0-0--010---4------0-1l--1en&amp;a=d&amp;c=algene&amp;d=D01-000083 |title= record of Kilia – E. Parker (k) |work= Hawaii island wedding records (1832–1910) |author= |publisher= Ulukau, the Hawaiian Electronic Library |accessdate=December 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite his regular, American-sounding name and upbringing, Samuel Parker was of three-quarters [[native Hawaiian]] ancestry.

Samuel Parker's life was influenced by some early deaths in the family. His father Ebenezer had died in 1855, when Samuel was only two years old. Samuel was the second son but his only brother, Ebenezer Christian Parker II, then died in 1860, at the age of ten. Samuel was educated at Oahu College, now known as [[Punahou School]], on O{{okina}}ahu. There he made lasting friendships with his contemporaries among the Hawaiian nobility, a social connection that would prove very helpful in adulthood.

Grandfather John Parker - who did have a long life - died, in 1868, when Samuel was still only 15 years old. Samuel thus found himself the co-proprietor, with his father's elder brother, of the eponymous [[Parker Ranch]].

The uncle was John Palmer Parker II (1827-1891), who was also married to a Hawaiian lady, Hanai. In 1879, they moved from the Ranch to a much larger and more accessible estate, more suited to their status as a wealthy and prominent couple who liked to entertain: ''Pu{{okina}}u o Pelu''. {{coord| 20|1|9|N| 155|40|55|W| type:landmark_region:US-HI| name="Puuopelu"|display=inline}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Cattle Country: A visit to Parker Ranch on the Big Isle is like taking a journey back in time |newspaper= [[Honolulu Star Bulletin]] |author= Cheryl Chee Tsutsumi |date=February 1, 2009 |url= http://www.starbulletin.com/travel/travelnews/20090201_hawaiis_back_yard.html |accessdate= June 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This left the Ranch house to Samuel and growing, new family.

The Parker Ranch began in 1847, with a small cottage called ''Mana Hale'', in the remote uplands of [[Mauna Kea]] on [[Hawaii (island)|Hawai{{okina}}i island]], at about {{convert|3500|ft}} elevation at {{coord| 19|59|48|N| 155|33|29|W| type:landmark_region:US-HI| name="Mana"|display=inline}}, but was quickly built up into a profitable cattle-estate of 1 640 acres. However, when Samuel took over, he also left the cowboy work, and later the management, to others and was soon looking for further business opportunities.

==Family life==
[[File:Hattie Panana Parker, Hawaiian Gazette, 1901.jpg|thumbnail|Hattie Panana Parker]]
Samuel married Harriet ("Hattie") Panana Kaiwaokalani Napela (1852–1901) on August 23, 1871. She was the daughter of [[Jonatana Napela|Jonathan Napela]] who was an early convert to [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormonism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |hdl= 10524/98 |title= Most Influential Mormon Islander: Jonathan Hawaii Napela. |work= Hawaiian Journal of History |publisher=Hawaii Historical Society |volume= 42 |author= Fred E. Woods |authorlink= Fred Woods |year= 2008 |pages= 135–157 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also three-quarters Hawaiian, and also known as Harriet Richardson, after her mother's maiden name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Sons of the American Revolution magazine |volume= 1 |year= 1907 |page= 17 |publisher= Sons of the American Revolution |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8bMaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA17 |issue= 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samuel and Harriet Parker had nine children.
Their first daughter was Mary Kihilani Parker (1871–1895). The second daughter, Eva Kalanikauleleiaiwi Parker (1872–1922), married her cousin [[James Frank Woods]], the son of Parker's sister Mary. The third daughter, Helen Umiokalani Parker (1874–1929), married Carl Widemann, son of Hermann Widemann.&lt;ref name="story"&gt;{{cite news |work= The Story of Maui Royalty: The Parkers of Waimea |author= Kapiikauinamoku  |title=Second Son of Parkers, Palmer, Died As Youth |date= May 23, 1956 |url= http://ulukau.org/elib/cgi-bin/library?e=q-0somr-000Sec--11en&amp;a=d&amp;d=D0.4.27&amp;toc=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samuel's fourth child, John Palmer Parker III (1875–1893), was adopted by John Palmer Parker II and married Elizabeth Jane Lanakila Dowsett, 
known to later generations as "Aunt Tootsie", on April 18, 1893, at the Parker home in Honolulu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ulukau.org/gsdl2.7/cgi-bin/algene?a=d&amp;d=D10-000185 |title= Marriage record, Oahu (1832–1910) |work=state archives digital collections |publisher=state of Hawaii |accessdate= June 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Union of Mr. John P.

Thelma married Henry Gaillard Smart July 25, 1912 in Honolulu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Hawaiian Heiress to wed; Barbaric Splendor to Mark Marriage of Miss Parker to H.G.

However, she also died soon afterwards, in 1914, aged only 20.

Other children were: Harriet "Hattie" Kaonohilani Parker (1876–1884), Palmer Kuihelani Parker (1878–1896), Samuel Keaoulilani Parker (1879–1934), Ernest Napela Parker (1884–1945) and James Kekoalii Parker (1886–1962).&lt;ref name="bergin"&gt;{{cite book |title= Loyal to the Land: The Legendary Parker Ranch 750–1950 |author= Billy Bergin  |volume=volume 1 |publisher= University of Hawaii Press |year= 2004 |isbn= 978-0-8248-2692-5 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=iToXn2GGHpQC }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27}}

Parker's uncle, John Palmer Parker II, died in November 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Death of an old Kama-aina |newspaper= Hawaiian Gazette |date= November 24, 1891 |page= 7 |url=  http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83025121/1891-11-24/ed-1/seq-7 |accessdate= June 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parker's wife, Harriet, died in 1901, but he did not remain a widower for long.

==Sugar-plantations==
The family business was the Parker Ranch, a huge and successful cattle-business in the interior. However, in the second half of the century, the [[sugarcane|sugar-industry]] was developing rapidly in Hawaii, and Parker saw a profitable business opportunity and a chance to diversify from reliance on livestock.

In 1878, he started the Pa{{okina}}auhau Plantation with [[Rufus Anderson Lyman]], about 50 miles north of [[Hilo]] at coordinates {{coord| 20|5|9|N| 155|26|6|W| type:landmark_region:US-HI| name="Paauhau"|display=inline}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Paauhau Sugar Plantation Company History |url= http://www2.hawaii.edu/~speccoll/p_paauhau.html |work= Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association Plantation Archives |publisher= [[University of Hawaii]] |accessdate= June 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyman was advisor to island governor, [[Keelikolani|Princess Ruth Ke{{okina}}elikōlani]], the only land owner with holdings greater than those of the Parker Ranch. Her lands later became a major part of the [[Kamehameha Schools]] estate.

Parker enjoyed being at the heart of Hawaiian business and social life and developing a new and powerful circle of friends and associates. He was often involved in real estate deals involving long-term leases from the Kamehameha estate, or buying them [[fee simple]], and also enjoyed the Hawaiian tradition of lavish entertaining at his estates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hawaii's story by Hawaii's queen, Liliuokalani |author=[[Liliuokalani|Liliʻuokalani]] (Queen of Hawaii) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QrTCvcy0sE4C  |publisher=Lee and Shepard, reprinted by Kessinger Publishing, LLC |date=July 25, 2007 |origyear=1898 |isbn=978-0-548-22265-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|84}}

On August 19, 1879 Parker invested in the nearby Pacific Sugar Mill in [[Kukuihaele, Hawaii|Kukuihaele]] near [[Waipio Valley|Waipi{{okina}}o Valley]].&lt;ref name="pacific"&gt;{{cite web |title= Pacific Sugar Mill History |url= http://www2.hawaii.edu/~speccoll/p_pacific.html |work= Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association Plantation Archives |publisher= [[University of Hawaii]] |accessdate= March 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pacific mill had an abundant water supply, but eventually failed from mismanagement. In 1883 manager [[William H. Purvis]] introduced the [[mongoose]], which became an invasive pest. Herds of [[Hawaiian wild cattle|cattle]] and sheep had to be destroyed later when a [[glanders]] epidemic broke out because of poor conditions in the stables.&lt;ref name="pacific"/&gt; Parker was becoming involved in too many projects to concentrate on addressing any particular problems that developed in his growing personal and professional empire.

==Politics==
[[File:Keelikolani with Parker and Cummins.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=two men with Hawaiian woman|Left, with [[Keelikolani|Princess Ruth Ke{{okina}}elikōlani]] and [[John A. Cummins]] (right) about 1875]]
;Royal household 
In 1883, Parker took his first public role when he became a member of the [[Privy Council]] of King [[Kalākaua]]. In November 1884, he traveled abroad on official business, with the commission to the [[World Cotton Centennial]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. In 1886, he was appointed to the office of royal [[Equerry]], which supplied horses and arranged ceremonial occasions, and to the personal staff of Kalākaua with honorary rank of Major and Equerry in Waiting. Later, he was often addressed as ''Colonel'', but this was also merely a courtesy and there is no record of his ever serving as a regular soldier.&lt;ref name="office"/&gt; He was appointed to the [[Legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom|House of Nobles]] in the legislature from 1886 to 1890.

In the meanwhile, the ranch had been mortgaged to finance the failed sugar business, and was taken over by trustees and managed by Paul Jarrett in 1888.&lt;ref name="bergin"/&gt;{{rp|163}}

;Minister of State
In early 1891 Kalākaua died, and [[Liliuokalani|Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani]] became the new ruler. On February 25, 1891, Parker was appointed to his first cabinet post, Minister of Foreign Affairs, when [[John Adams Cummins]] was told to resign by the queen. On March 3 Parker was appointed to the Commission of Crown Lands.&lt;ref name="office"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASH01b2/5010b520.dir/Parker,%20Samuel.jpg |title= Parker, Samuel office record |work= state archives digital collections |publisher= state of Hawaii |accessdate= June 15, 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204030/http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASH01b2/5010b520.dir/Parker%2C%20Samuel.jpg |archivedate= March 3, 2016 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was generally considered the most powerful member of the cabinet; sometimes called Prime Minister, or Premier, but there was no such official office.
The choice of Parker satisfied the people who wanted more native Hawaiians in the government, and he generally had favorable relations with the American interests at the time.&lt;ref name="kingdom3"&gt;{{cite book |title=Hawaiian Kingdom 1874–1893, the Kalakaua Dynasty |author= [[Ralph Simpson Kuykendall]] |url= http://www.ulukau.org/elib/cgi-bin/library?c=kingdom3&amp;l=en |volume=3 |publisher= University of Hawaii Press |year= 1967 |isbn= 978-0-87022-433-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|476}}

The first sign of trouble came a week later when Parker also became acting Minister of Finance, temporarily replacing [[Hermann A. Widemann]] who was also serving on the Supreme Court. The [[McKinley Tariff]] act had devastated the Hawaiian economy by making exports to the US much more expensive, undoing the effects of the [[Reciprocity Treaty of 1875]]. It was not until July that former self-taught dentist [[John Mott-Smith]] would take over the Finance position, which he had taken earlier under [[Kamehameha V]]. However, by October Mott-Smith was sent to [[Washington, DC]] to negotiate a trade treaty, and Parker had to again take the Finance position until Widemann could resume his duties on January 28, 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASH015e/1ccf4a86.dir/Widemann,%20Hermann%20A.jpg |title=Widemann, Hermann A. office record |work=state archives digital collections |publisher=state of Hawaii |accessdate=June 15, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303183837/http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASH015e/1ccf4a86.dir/Widemann%2C%20Hermann%20A.jpg |archivedate=March 3, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Political unrest
A time of unprecedented instability in the government began in 1892, with the previously biennial part-time legislature having its [[1892 Legislative Session of the Kingdom of Hawaii|longest session]].&lt;ref name="long"&gt;{{cite news |title= The Longest Legislature |pages= 9–27 |author= Albertine Loomis |work= Annual report of the Hawaiian Historical Society |year= 1963 |hdl= 10524/35}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Power was split among three parties, with only one of them, the [[Hawaiian National Reform Party]], considered loyal to the queen. By early 1892, Marshal [[Charles Burnett Wilson (marshal)|Charles Burnett Wilson]] suspected members of the  [[Hawaiian National Liberal Party]] were planning a takeover of the government in response to the 1887 [[Bayonet Constitution]] which limited voting rights to wealthy non-Asians. These efforts were blocked by the Reform Party, which largely represented wealthy descendants of Americans and Europeans. Parker was attacked by the Liberals and called a "half-caste cowboy". By May some of the Liberals were arrested, but most charges were dropped, with Parker agreeing that prosecutions would just inflame tensions further.&lt;ref name="kingdom3"/&gt;{{rp|528–530}}

Reports began circulating that Hawaii was negotiating to be annexed by the [[United States]], but Parker issued denials. In reality, [[Lorrin A. Thurston]] (a newspaper publisher whose only government position was as a legislator) had been in Washington lobbying for annexation, but Mott-Smith did nothing to communicate this to Parker.&lt;ref name="kingdom3"/&gt;{{rp|540}} Attorney General Whiting resigned because of a disagreement with Parker.  Lili{{okina}}uokalani  made a deal with the cabinet: if they supported a lottery to help raise funds, she would appoint [[Paul Neumann (Attorney General)|Paul Neumann]] as the new [[attorney general]], who agreed to keep Wilson as marshal. On August 30, 1892 the legislature passed a no confidence motion, insisting the Marshal Wilson be removed. Parker and the rest of the cabinet resigned, but Lili{{okina}}uokalani could not come up with replacements that would be acceptable to her opponents in the legislature. In November 1892 Parker was forced to resign, and was replaced with [[Joseph Nawahi]].

{{main|overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii}}
Parker was again appointed to head the government on January 13, 1893 as Minister of Foreign Affairs; it was to be the last cabinet appointed by a ruling monarch. The next day Lili{{okina}}uokalani presented her proposed [[1893 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii]] to the cabinet. Frustrated by their hesitation, she threatened to proclaim it unilaterally. Parker and the other ministers were also warned by Thurston and other prominent citizens not to approve the new constitution, which they saw as returning to a more powerful autocratic rule. Parker met with both Liberals who demanded wider voting rights, and the American minister [[John L. Stevens]], who said he would not support the queen if there was an uprising.&lt;ref name="kingdom3"/&gt;{{rp|583–590}}

On January 16, troops from the {{USS|Boston|1884|6}} came ashore, armed but ordered to be as neutral as possible. Parker protested, and asked Stevens to order them to leave, but was told they were protecting American interests.&lt;ref name="kingdom3"/&gt;{{rp|595–597}} The next day the [[Provisional Government of Hawaii]] declared the queen deposed. Parker protested to Stevens one more time, but by the time a response was delivered to Parker, the government building had been seized. Only a small police force led by [[Charles Burnett Wilson (marshal)|Charles Burnett Wilson]] was protecting Lili{{okina}}uokalani, so Parker helped negotiate a surrender of to avoid bloodshed.&lt;ref name="kingdom3"/&gt;{{rp|602}}

From [[San Francisco]] Parker tried to convince the US to restore the Queen, but the efforts were not successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Still has Hopes: Queen Lil Has Not Abandoned the Restoration Idea |newspaper= San Francisco Morning Call |date= January 18, 1894 |url=  http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn94052989/1894-01-18/ed-1/seq-2 |accessdate= June 13, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was interviewed by US Commissioner [[James H. Blount]] in preparing his [[Blount Report]] on April 6, 1893. He stated his opinion that a majority of voters would have approved a restoration of the queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Blount Report: Affairs in Hawaii |url= http://libweb.hawaii.edu/digicoll/annexation/blount/br0903.html |pages=903–911 |accessdate= June 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Territorial life==
Parker supported [[Sanford Dole]] as the first governor of the [[Territory of Hawaii]], even though he had some encouragement to seek that post himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Correspondence: His Duty  |newspaper= The Independent |location= Honolulu |date= February 19, 1900 |page= 2 |url= http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85047097/1900-02-19/ed-1/seq-2/ |accessdate= February 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1900 Parker attended the organizing convention of the [[Republican Party of Hawaii]], and was chosen to attend the national convention in [[Philadelphia]] on June 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Hawaiian Politics—1900 |pages= 14–20 |author= Charles H. Hunter |work= Annual report of the Hawaiian Historical Society |year= 1956 |hdl= 10524/59}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In September Parker was nominated without opposition by the Republicans for the first election of [[Hawaii Territory's At-large congressional district|delegate to US Congress]] for the territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Samuel Parker the Unanimous Nominee of Republican Convention: He will lead the Grand Old Party in First Political Campaign in Hawaii |newspaper= The Honolulu Republican |date= September 25, 1900 |url=  http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85047165/1900-09-25/ed-1/seq-1 |accessdate= June 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Prince [[David Kawānanakoa]] ran as a Democrat; they both lost. Parker came in a close second to [[Robert W. Wilcox]] of the [[Home Rule Party of Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Appletons' annual cyclopaedia and register of important events |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rEwoAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA304 |year=1902 |publisher=D.

Parker's first wife died in July 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Hattie Parker |newspaper= The Independent |location= Honolulu |date= July 12, 1901 |page= 4 |url= http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn//sn85047097/1901-07-12/ed-1/seq-4 |accessdate= June 29, 2010 }}/&lt;/ref&gt;
His second wife was [[Abigail Campbell|Abigail Kuaihelani Maipinepine]] (1859–1908), widow of industrialist [[James Campbell (industrialist)|James Campbell]]. They married January 3, 1902 at the Occidental Hotel in San Francisco, with judge J. C. B. Hebbard officiating. This made him stepfather to [[Abigail Campbell Kawānanakoa|Abigail Campbell]] and his second wife's other daughters. Parker had acquired a reputation as a notorious spendthrift. Even his supporters said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The titled and the wealthy of all lands who have visited the islands know Parker and have partaken of his hospitality. Few men have bet more money at poker on small hands than has Colonel "Sam" Parker.&lt;ref name="married"&gt;{{cite news |title= Samuel Parker and Mrs. Campbell Married Quietly at San Francisco |newspaper= Hawaiian Gazette |date= January 14, 1902 |page= 1 |url=  http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83025121/1902-01-14/ed-1/seq-1 |accessdate= June 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Three days later, his stepdaughter Abigail married Prince Kawānanakoa, who had been his opponent in the 1900 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Death of Mrs. Campbell-Parker at the Hospital |newspaper= Hawaiian Gazette |date= November 3, 1908 |url=  http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83025121/1908-11-03/ed-1/seq-3 |accessdate= June 14, 2010 }} (reprinted from Honolulu Advertiser)&lt;/ref&gt;
This family and its descendants became known as the [[House of Kawānanakoa]].&lt;ref name="hjh03"&gt;{{cite news |hdl= 10524/354 |title= Princess Abigail Kawananakoa: the Forgotten Territorial Native Hawaiian Leader |work= Hawaiian Journal of History |publisher=Hawaii Historical Society |volume= 37 |author= Richard A. Hawkins |year= 2003 |pages= 163–177 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of their honeymoon, in early 1902 the Parkers traveled to [[Washington, DC]], where he visited [[Theodore Roosevelt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= May be next governor: San Jose Lady has a Responsible Position in Prospect |newspaper= The Evening News |location=San Jose, California |date= January 31, 1902 |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jSsiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OKQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2837%2C1113342 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
They returned to California February 2, 1902; it was rumored that Parker would be appointed as the next governor of the Territory of Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Prince David and His Bride Are En Route to Island Home |newspaper= The Evening News |location=San Jose, California |date= February 1, 1902 |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jisiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OKQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3189%2C1214078 |accessdate= June 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[George R. Carter]] was appointed instead, descended from American missionaries. It would not be until [[John D. Waihee III]] in 1986 that an ethnic native Hawaiian would become governor. 
Parker's wife was a target of a jewel theft when they returned in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= $80,000 Robbery in Honolulu: Mrs. Samuel Parker's Jewels Stolen After She Had Attended a Reception  |date= August 3, 1903 |newspaper= [[New York Times]] |url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1903/08/03/105056905.pdf |format= pdf  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Parker stayed active in the Republican party, he was never elected or appointed to a territorial office. He was able to convince [[Jonah Kūhiō Kalaniana'ole|Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalaniana{{okina}}ole]], brother of his stepson-in-law Kawānanakoa,  to run as a Republican in the 1902 election of congressional delegate; Kalaniana{{okina}}ole won, and was reelected until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{CongBio|K000004|inline=1|Jonah Kūhiō Kalaniana{{okina}}ole}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Parker served as the first territorial representative on the [[Republican National Committee]].&lt;ref name="married"/&gt;

In 1904 he partnered with Kohala Plantation owner John Hind on the irrigation project known as the Kohala Ditch and hired [[Michael O'Shaughnessy]] to help engineer the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2002/Sep/08/il/il22a.html |author= Wanda A.

He invested in the Hawaiian Irrigation Company of John T. McCrosson, originally called the Hamakua Ditch company, but changed to avoid confusion with the earlier project of a similar name on [[Maui]] by [[Henry Perrine Baldwin]]. It was intended to build another irrigation system for Parker's Pa{{okina}}auhau Plantation. Although Parker arranged various leases for ranch land, these projects fell into turmoil over contractual disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Congressional Testimony of Arthur C.

Parker was often at odds with Parker Ranch manager [[Alfred Wellington Carter]] (cousin of governor George Carter). Carter was steadily investing in enlarging the ranch, while Parker was more interested in using its profits to support his lifestyle.&lt;ref name="bergin"/&gt;{{rp|262–264}} Carter was appointed guardian of Annie Thelma Parker, heir of her adoptive grandfather John Parker II's half interest in the ranch. Carter proposed mortgaging that half to buy out Parker. Parker claimed he rightfully owned the entire ranch and started a lawsuit to remove Carter as guardian and ranch manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Partnership not Shown: Never Heard of in Thirteen Years |newspaper= Hawaiian Gazette |date= September 2, 1904 |page= 5 |url= http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83025121/1904-09-02/ed-1/seq-5  |accessdate= June 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Annie Thelma Parker's mother, who had remarried to Frederick S. Knight of San Francisco in October 1900, publicly attacked Parker saying she "had personal knowledge of the extravagance of said Samuel Parker and of his inability to manage his own property affairs in a discreet and prudent manner".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Mrs. Knight Takes Hand in Parker Ranch Case: Charges Conspiracy by Sam Parker, J.

After his wife Abigail's death in 1908, the Campbell Estate, one of the largest private landholdings in Hawaii, was left in trust to her children from her first marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= James Campbell, Esq. |publisher= James Campbell Company LLC |url= http://www.kapolei.com/pdf/jcbookletPDFoptimized.pdf |accessdate= March 23, 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090411090013/http://www.kapolei.com/pdf/jcbookletPDFoptimized.pdf |archivedate= April 11, 2009 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Parker spent more time in the US, including visiting his distant Boston relations. The press liked to call him the "King of Hawaii".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Col. Samuel Parker, "King of Hawaii" Here: Col. Samuel Parker in Boston, the Home of His Grandfather |date= December 27, 1911 |newspaper= [[New York Times]] |url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1911/12/27/104846190.pdf |accessdate= June 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His health started to fail, and he headed back to Hawaii in November 1913 on a new steamship of the [[Matson Navigation Company]] line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= New Matson Boat Leaves New York a Week from Today—Col.

Parker died March 19, 1920,&lt;ref name="DeathMN"&gt;{{cite news |title= Col.

He and many family members are buried at the original Parker family cemetery near Hale Mana.
The Parker Ranch, estimated worth about $6 million at the time, was left in trust to his six-year-old great-grandson [[Richard Smart (actor)|Richard Smart]]. Parker's personal estate went to five surviving children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Col.

Parker's nephew James Frank Woods (1872–1930), widower of daughter Eva, in 1923 married [[Elizabeth Kahanu Kalaniana'ole|Elizabeth Kahanu Kalaniana{{okina}}ole]] (1879–1932), who was the widow of Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalaniana{{okina}}ole.&lt;ref name="story"/&gt;
Although some sources say the US Post Office for Waimea is named Kamuela for Parker, it is more likely from the name of the postmaster of the area, [[Samuel M. Spencer|Samuel Mahuka Spencer]] (1875–1960).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wehewehe.org/cgi-bin/hdict?a=q&amp;j=pp&amp;l=en&amp;q=kamuela |archive-url= https://archive.is/20120716001717/http://wehewehe.org/cgi-bin/hdict?a=q&amp;j=pp&amp;l=en&amp;q=kamuela |dead-url= yes |archive-date= July 16, 2012 |title= lookup of kamuela |work= on Place Names of Hawai'i |author= Pukui and Elbert |year= 2004 |publisher= Ulukau, the Hawaiian Electronic Library, University of Hawaii |accessdate= June 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''September 2006 Karaburun, Turkey migrant boat disaster''' occurred on 26 September 2006 between the [[Greece|Greek]] island off [[Chios]] and the extreme western end of the [[Turkey|Turkish]] coast near the  port city of [[İzmir]]. It occurred in the coastal area of [[Küçükbahçe]] village, [[Karaburun]] district located in the western shore of [[Karaburun Peninsula, Turkey|Karaburun Peninsula]], [[İzmir Province]]. The coastline of the northern part of Chios island extends opposite to Küçükbahçe village in the [[Anatolia]]n mainland.

In the morning of 26 September 2006, a vessel of the [[Turkish Coast Guard]] picked up thirty-one illegal migrants from the sea, two of them women. The bodies of six drowned migrants were found on the same day and according to the accounts provided by these survivors three more had gone missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/world/Greeks-accused-of-drowning-immigrants.2814154.jp News:|title= Greeks accused of drowning immigrants|author= |publisher= [[The Scotsman]]|date= 2006-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those dead by drowning included one [[Palestinians|Palestinian]], one [[Algeria]]n and one [[Iraqis|Iraqi]] national, as well as three [[Tunisians]]. The three missing were also Tunisians according to the survivors.

'''State media''' or '''state-owned media''' is [[Mass media|media]] for [[mass communication]] which is "controlled financially and [[editor]]ially by the [[State (polity)|state]]."&lt;ref name="DavidWebster"&gt;Webster, David. [http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/state/freedom1.htm Building Free and Independent Media] (August 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; These news outlets may be the sole media outlet or may exist in competition with corporate and non-corporate media.

State media is not to be confused with [[Public broadcasting|public-sector]] media, which is "funded directly or indirectly by the state, but over which the state does not have tight editorial control."&lt;ref name="DavidWebster"/&gt;

==Overview==
The term state media is primarily understood in contrast to corporate media, and occasionally non-corporate independent news, which has no direct control from any political party.&lt;ref&gt;Roumeen, Simeon &amp; McLiesh, 2002, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medialens.org/index.php/alerts/alert-archive/alerts-2013/719-jousting-with-toothpicks-the-case-for-challenging-corporate-journalism.html|title=Media Lens - Jousting With Toothpicks - The Case For Challenging Corporate Journalism|first=|last=Editor|website=medialens.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its content, according to some sources, is usually more prescriptive, telling the audience what to think, particularly as it is under no pressure to attract high ratings or generate advertising revenue&lt;ref name=silver&gt;Silverblatt &amp; Zlobin, 2004, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore may cater to the forces in control of the state as opposed to the forces in control of the corporation, as described in the [[propaganda model]] of the mass media.
In more controlled regions, the state may [[censorship|censor]] content which it deems illegal, immoral or unfavourable to the government and likewise regulate any programming related to the media; therefore, it is not independent of the governing party.&lt;ref&gt;Price, Rozumilowicz &amp; Verhulst, 2002, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; In this type of environment, journalists may be required to be members or affiliated with the ruling party, such as in the former [[Soviet Union]] or [[North Korea]].&lt;ref name=silver/&gt; Within countries that have high levels of [[government interference]] in the media, it may use the state press for [[propaganda]] purposes:
* to promote the regime in a favourable light,
* vilify opposition to the government by launching smear campaigns 
* giving skewed coverage to opposition views, or
* act as a [[Spokesperson|mouthpiece]] to advocate a regime's [[ideology]].
Additionally, the state-controlled media may only report on legislation after it has already become law to stifle any debate.&lt;ref&gt;Karatnycky, Motyl &amp; Schnetzer, 2001, p. 105, 106, 228, 384&lt;/ref&gt; The media legimitises its presence by emphasising "national unity" against domestic or foreign "aggressors".&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; In more open and competitive contexts, the state may control or fund its own outlet and is in competition with opposition-controlled and/or independent media. The state media usually have less government control in more open societies and can provide more balanced coverage than media outside of state control.&lt;ref&gt;Karatnycky, Motyl &amp; Schnetzer, 2001, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

State media outlets usually enjoy increased funding and subsidies compared to private media counterparts, but this can create inefficiency in the state media.&lt;ref&gt;Stability Pact Anti-Corruption Initiative, 2002, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the [[People's Republic of China]], where state control of the media is high, levels of funding have been reduced for state outlets, which have forced the [[Communist Party of China|Party]] media to sidestep official restrictions on content or publish "soft" editions, such as weekend editions, to generate income.&lt;ref&gt;Sen &amp; Lee, 2008, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories of state ownership==
Two contrasting theories of state control of the media exist; the public interest or Pigouvian theory states that government ownership is beneficial, whereas the public choice theory suggests that state control undermines [[Economic freedom|economic]] and [[political freedom]]s.

===Public interest theory===
The [[public interest theory]] is also referred to as the Pigouvian theory&lt;ref&gt;Coase, R. H. British Broadcasting, 1950. The following argument was formulated by the [[BBC]] in support of maintaining publicly subsidised radio and television in the United Kingdom&lt;/ref&gt; and states that government ownership of media is desirable.&lt;ref&gt;Djankov, McLeish, Nenova &amp; Shleifer, 2003, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; Three reasons are offered. Firstly, the dissemination of information is a public good, and to withhold it would be costly even if it is not paid for. Secondly, the cost of the provision and dissemination of information is high, but once costs are incurred, marginal costs for providing the information are low and so are subject to increasing returns.&lt;ref name=p342&gt;Djankov, McLeish, Nenova &amp; Shleifer, 2003, p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; Thirdly, state media ownership can be less biased, more complete and accurate if consumers are ignorant and in addition to private media that would serve the governing classes.&lt;ref name=p342/&gt; However, Pigouvian economists, who advocate regulation and [[Nationalization|nationalisation]], are supportive of free and private media.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, 1955; Myrdal, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public choice theory===
The public choice theory asserts that state-owned media would manipulate and distort information in favour of the ruling party and entrench its rule and prevent the public from making informed decisions, which undermines democratic institutions.&lt;ref name=p342/&gt; That would prevent private and independent media, which provide alternate voices allowing individuals to choose politicians, goods, services, etc. without fear from functioning. Additionally, that would inhibit competition among media firms that would ensure that consumers usually acquire unbiased, accurate information.&lt;ref name=p342/&gt; Moreover, this competition is part of a checks-and-balances system of a [[democracy]], known as the [[Fourth Estate]], along with the [[judiciary]], [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[legislature]].&lt;ref name=p342/&gt;

==Determinants of state control==
Both theories have implications regarding the determinants and consequences of ownership of the media.&lt;ref&gt;Djankov, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes &amp; Sheleifer, 2002, 28-29&lt;/ref&gt; The public interest theory suggests that more benign governments should have higher levels of control of the media which would in turn increase [[press freedom]] as well as economic and political freedoms. Conversely, the public choice theory affirms that the opposite is true - "public spirited", benevolent governments should have less control which would increase these freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;Djankov, McLeish, Nenova &amp; Shleifer, 2003, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, state ownership of the media is found in poor, [[autocratic]] non-democratic countries with highly interventionist governments that have some interest in controlling the flow of information.&lt;ref&gt;Djankov, 2002, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Countries with "weak" governments do not possess the political will to break up state media monopolies.&lt;ref&gt;Price, 2004, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; Media control is also usually consistent with state ownership in the [[economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Djankov, 2002, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2002, the press in most of [[Europe]] (with the exception of [[Belarus]]) is mostly private and free of state control and ownership, along with [[North America|North]] and [[South America]].&lt;ref name=p19&gt;Djankov, 2002, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The press "role" in the national and societal dynamics of the [[United States]] and [[Australia]] has virtually always been the responsibility of the private commercial sector since these countries' earliest days.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann-Riem, 1996, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Levels of state ownership are higher in some [[Africa]]n countries, the [[Middle East]] and some [[Asia]]n countries (with the exception of [[Japan]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Mongolia]], [[Nepal]], the [[Philippines]], [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Thailand]] where large areas of private press exist.) Full state monopolies exist in [[Burma]] (under the military rule) and [[North Korea]].&lt;ref name=p19/&gt;

==Consequences of state ownership==
Issues with state media include complications with press freedom and [[journalistic objectivity]]. According to Christopher Walker in the ''[[Journal of Democracy]]'', "[[authoritarian]] or [[totalitarian]] media outlets" such as China's [[China Central Television|CCTV]], Russia's [[Russia Today|RT]] and Venezuela's [[TeleSUR]] take advantage of both domestic and foreign media due to the censorship under regimes in their native countries and the openness of democratic nations to which they broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walker|first1=Christopher|title=The Authoritarian Threat|journal=''[[Journal of Democracy]]''|date=1 January 2016|volume=27|issue=1|pages=49–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Press freedom===

"Worse outcomes" are associated with higher levels of state ownership of the media, which would reject Pigouvian theory.&lt;ref&gt;Djankov, McLeish, Nenova &amp; Shleifer, 2003, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt; The news media are more independent and fewer journalists are arrested, detained or harassed in countries with less state control.&lt;ref name=p23&gt;Djankov, 2002, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Harassment, imprisonment and higher levels of [[internet censorship]] occur in countries with high levels of state ownership such as [[Singapore]], [[Belarus]], [[Burma]], [[Ethiopia]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[Iran]], [[Syria]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]].&lt;ref name=p23/&gt;&lt;ref name=p367&gt;Djankov, McLeish, Nenova &amp; Shleifer, 2003, p. 367&lt;/ref&gt;
In a similar vein, the [[public broadcaster]] in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[BBC]], although funded by the public [[Television licensing in the United Kingdom|licence fee]] and [[Politics of the United Kingdom|government]], insists that it is independent from state control.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Charter. [http://www.bbccharterreview.org.uk/pdf_documents/bbc_cr_greenpaper.pdf A strong BBC, independent of government], March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Countries with a total state monopoly in the media like [[North Korea]] and [[Laos]] experience a "Castro effect", where state control is powerful enough that no journalistic harassment is required in order to restrict press freedom.&lt;ref name=p23/&gt;

===Civil and political rights===
The public interest theory claims state ownership of the press enhances [[civil and political rights]]; whilst under the public choice theory, it curtails them by suppressing public oversight of the government and facilitating [[political corruption]]. High to absolute government control of the media is primarily associated with lower levels of political and civil rights, higher levels of corruption, quality of regulation, security of property and [[media bias]].&lt;ref name=p367/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Djankov, 2002, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Independent media sees higher oversight by the media of the government. For example, increased reporting of corruption in [[Mexico]], [[Ghana]] and [[Kenya]] after restrictions were lifted in the 1990s, but government-controlled media defended officials.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=p25&gt;Djankov, 2002, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic freedom===
It is common for countries with strict control of newspapers to have fewer firms listed per capita on their markets&lt;ref&gt;La Porta et al, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and less developed banking systems.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Demirguc-Kunt &amp; Levine, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  These findings support the public choice theory, which suggests higher levels of state ownership of the press would be detrimental to economic and financial development.&lt;ref name="p367"/&gt;

'''''The Trial of Lucullus''''' is a short didactic radio play by the German dramatist [[Bertolt Brecht]] written in verse. It was completed in 1940.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Introduction to the Social and Political Philosophy of Bertolt Brecht: Revolution and Aesthetics|last = Squiers|first = Anthony|publisher = Rodopi|year = 2014|isbn = 9789042038998|location = Amsterdam|pages = 190}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, the great Roman general [[Lucullus]] appears after death before a judge and jury of the underworld, who are to decide whether he should be condemned to [[Hades]] or admitted to the [[Elysium|Elysian fields]]. The jury, representing the lower classes, allows Lucullus to call as witnesses portrayed on a triumphal [[frieze]]. All the evidence is against Lucullus, except for the fact that he introduced the cherry tree to [[Europe]], grieved over the destruction of books, and was possessed of a fine culinary experience.

Though first conceived as an opera, the text was set to music by [[Paul Dessau]]. Communist authorities banned it, causing Brecht to revise scenes and changing the title to ''The Condemnation of Lucullus''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The revised version of ''The Condemnation of Lucullus'' premiered in 1951.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;!--According to Everett Helm, "Current Chronical: [Berlin]", Musical Quarterly 37, no. 4 (October): 594, the performance of the opera went ahead, under the original title,  on 18 March 1951.--&gt;

'''Triplemanía IV-B''' was a major ''[[lucha libre]]'', or [[professional wrestling]], show promoted by the Mexican-based [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]] and was the second of three Triplemanía IV shows held in 1996. The event took place on June 15, 1996 at the [[International Amphitheatre]] in [[Orizaba, Veracruz]], Mexico. The annual Triplemanía show(s) are AAA's biggest show of the year, serving as the culmination of major storylines and feature wrestlers from all over the world competing in what has been described as AAA's version of [[WrestleMania]] or their [[Super Bowl]] event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha Libre: the bizarre and honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=A family affair|pages=128–132|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Main event featured a [[Professional wrestling match types#Lumberjack match|Lumberjack match]] between the teams of [[La Parka]], [[Octagón]], and [[El Alebrije (wrestler)|Máscara Sagrada]] and Killer, [[Cien Caras]], and [[Heavy Metal (wrestler)|Heavy Metal]]. The show also featured an [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Elimination tag team matches|Elimination match]] with eight different champions, competing for the title of ''[[AAA Campeón de Campeones Championship|Campeón de Campeones]]'' ("Champions of Champions"). The show also featured an [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Trios rules (Relevos Australianos)|Eight-man "Atómicos" tag team match]] that was a preview for the main event of [[Triplemanía IV-C]] as the team known as ''Los Junior Atómicos'' ([[Máscara Sagrada Jr.]], [[Tinieblas Jr.]], [[Blue Demon Jr.]], and Halcón Dorado Jr.) fought against ''[[Los Payasos]]'' ("The Clowns"; Coco Rojo, Coco Verde and Coco Amarillo) and [[La Parka II|Karis la Momia]]

==Production==

===Background===
Just like in 1994 and 1995 [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]] planned out three Triplemanía events in 1994, the [[Triplemanía IV-A|first Triplemanía show]] slated for May 11, the second Triplemanía IV show was booked for June 15 in [[Orizaba, Veracruz]] and the [[Triplemanía IV-C|Third Triplemanía IV]] on July 15 in [[Ciudad Madero|Madero]].&lt;ref name="Trip4B"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trip4A"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html#iv-a | title = Asistencia Asesoría y Administración TripleManía | accessdate = 2009-02-19| publisher = ProWrestlingHistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trip4C"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html#iv-c | title = Asistencia Asesoría y Administración TripleManía | accessdate = 2009-02-19| publisher = ProWrestlingHistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; AAA promoter [[Antonio Peña]] wanted to expand AAA into the United States, building on the success they had so far in both [[Los Angeles]] and [[Chicago]] up to that point and the first Triplemanía IV would take place in Chicago at the [[International Amphitheatre]]. The second Triplemanía IV show would take place at the Orizaba Bullring in [[Orizaba, Veracruz]], returning to Mexican soil for the last two shows. Triplemanía IV-B was the ninth overall show produced under the Triplemanía banner.

===Storylines===
The Triplemanía show featured six [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing [[Screenplay|scripted]] feuds, [[plot (narrative)|plots]] and [[narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

In late 1995 ''tecnico'' Halcón Dorado Jr. came to AAA from the UWA as it was closing its doors. In AAA he quickly found himself partnered up with a number of other "Juniors", [[Blue Demon Jr.]], [[Máscara Sagrada Jr.]] and [[Tinieblas Jr.]] to form a group that became known as ''Los Junior Atómicos''. Of the four only two of them were actually sons of the wrestlers they took the name of, Tinieblas Jr. (son of [[Tinieblas]]) and Blue Demon Jr. (Son of [[Blue Demon]]).&lt;ref name=Tinieblas&gt;{{Cite news|title=Lucha Libre: Conoce la historia de las leyendas de cuadrilátero|work=Tinieblas Jr. (1966)|location=[[Mexico]]|id=Grandes Figuras de la Lucha Libre|page=62|year=2008|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BDJr&gt;{{cite book | author= Madigan, Dan | title= Mondo Lucha Libre: the bizarre&amp; honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling | publisher= HarperColins Publisher | year= 2007 | chapter = Los Enmascarados (the masked men): Blue Demon Jr. | pages = 90–93| isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining two were billed more as "successors" and not actually children of [[Máscara Sagrada]] and Halcón Dorado.&lt;ref name="EncyParka"&gt;{{cite news | first = Enciclopedia |last=staff | title = Enciclopedia de las Mascaras | work = Parka Jr. | location = [[Mexico City|Mexico City, Mexico]] | id = Tomo III | pages = 50 | date = October 2007 | language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EncySagradaJr"&gt;{{cite news|title=Enciclopedia de las Máscaras|work=Máscara Sagrada Jr.(primera version)|location=[[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]]|id=Tomo III|pages=29|date=October 2007|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EncyHDoradaJr"&gt;{{cite news|title=Enciclopedia de las Máscaras|work=Halcón Dorado Jr, |location=[[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]]|id=Tomo II|pages=39|date=September 2007|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a tag team match earlier in 1996 a [[Blue Demon Jr.]] dive onto [[Karis La Momia]] ("Karis the Mummy") ended badly, with the storyline being that the dive injured Karis, causing him to grab a char and attack Blue Demon Jr. during the match.&lt;ref name=AAATrip4&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/eventos-magnos/triplemania/item/89-tripleman%C3%ADa-iv-los-juniors-y-los-payasos-con-karis-en-guerra.html | title=Triplemanía IV: Los Juniors y Los Payasos con Karis en Guerra | accessdate=July 13, 2015 | publisher=[[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storyline soon saw Karis la Momoa recruit ''[[Los Payasos]]'' ("The Clowns"; Coco Rojo, Coco Verde and Coco Amarillo) a trio of "Evil clowns". which brought out Blue Demon Jr.'s fellow ''Junior Atómicos'' to even the odds.&lt;ref name=YIR1996/&gt; On May 15, 2015 Karis defeated Blue Demon Jr. to win the Mexican National Cruiserweight Championship during a show [[Naucalpan]], [[Mexico State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Lucha 2000 Staff | title = Los Reyes de Mexico: La Historia de Los Campeonatos Nacionales | work =Lucha 2000 | id = Especial 21 | date = December 20, 2004 | language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years AAA had recognized a large number of championships, including championships created by other Mexican wrestling promotions such as the [[Universal Wrestling Association]] (UWA) and the [[World Wrestling Association]] (WWA). At one point they created the [[IWC World Heavyweight Championship]], intended to be AAA's top title, but it was never considered a prestigious as such. In 1996 AAA tried to clarify their championship rankings a bit by holding a one-night tournament where any champion was eligible to compete for the [[AAA Campeón de Campeones Championship]]. AAA decided to hold an eight-man [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Elimination tag team matches|Elimination match]] at Triplemanía IV-B to determine the first ''Campeón de Campeones''

==Aftermath==
''Los Junior Atómicos'' faced off against Karis la Momia and ''Los Payasos'' in the main event of Triplemanía IV-C a month later in a [[steel cage match]]. The stipulation was that the last person in the cage would be forced to unmask as the match would be contested under ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'', or "bet match" rules. In the end Halcón Dorado Jr. was forced to unmask as Karis La Momia was able to escape the cage.&lt;ref name="Trip4B"/&gt; After unmasking and revealing his real name Halcón Dorado Jr. attacked his fellow ''Junior Atómicos'' with a chair as he felt that they had left him in the cage to lose.&lt;ref name=YIR1996/&gt; With Dorado Jr.'s unmasking and betrayal the storyline with Karis la Momia and ''Los Payasos'' ended. Approximately six months later ''Los Junior Atómicos'' introduced a new member, [[La Parka II|La Parka Jr.]], who was in fact Karis La Momia under a new mask and identity.&lt;ref name=MondoParka&gt;{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha A Go-Go: the bizarre and honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=La Parka|pages=120–124|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his ''Campeón de Campeones'' loss Konnan sought to get revenge on Pierroth Jr., challenging him to a [[Professional wrestling match types#Strap match|Dog collar match]] at the subsequent Triplemanía IV-C show. Pierroth Jr. won the match, which turned out to be Konnan's last match at a major AAA event for eight years. By the fall of 1996 Konnan and a number of other AAA wrestlers broke away from AAA as they wanted to present shows that were more [[hardcore wrestling]] style of show inspired by [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] out of [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], something AAA owner [[Antonio Peña]] was not in favor off.&lt;ref name=YIR1996/&gt; Just like Peña had left [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] with a number of younger wrestlers, very talented leaving with him in 1992 Konnan took a large number of AAA's younger, talented wrestlers with him when he left the company in the fall of 1996.&lt;ref name=YIR1996/&gt;

==Reception==
In a 2000 article about the history of the Triplemanía up until that point [[Canadian Online Explorer]] wrestling writer John Molinario stated that the overall booking of the Triplemanía IV shows was "uninspired and repetitive. Pena recycled old angles that no longer registered with his audience."&lt;ref name=TripleSlam&gt;{{cite web | url=http://slam.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingInternational/triplemania.html | title=TripleMania: Mexico's answer to WrestleMania | first=John F. | last=Molinaro | year=2000 | accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wrestling commentator and ''lucha libre'' expert [[Mike Tenay]] noted that "Pena's poor promotional background and track record finally haunted him" stating that at this point AAA no longer had the big name stars to overcome the lack of advertising from AAA's side.&lt;ref name=TripleSlam/&gt; [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]] editor [[Dave Meltzer]] noted that by 1996 the Triplemanía show became "just a name for a bigger than average house show rather than the first year where it was like a [[WrestleMania]]."&lt;ref name=TripleSlam/&gt;

'''Troglitazone''' ('''Rezulin''', '''Resulin''', '''Romozin''', '''Noscal''') is an [[antidiabetic]] and [[anti-inflammatory]] drug, and a member of the [[medication|drug]] class of the [[thiazolidinedione]]s. It was prescribed for patients with [[diabetes mellitus type 2]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last=Fisher|first=Lawrence|title=Adverse Diabetes Drug News Sends Warner-Lambert Down|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/04/business/adverse-diabetes-drug-news-sends-warner-lambert-down.html|accessdate=12 December 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=4 November 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was developed by [[Daiichi Sankyo]] (Japan). In the United States, it was introduced and manufactured by [[Parke-Davis]] in the late 1990s, but turned out to be associated with an [[idiosyncratic drug reaction|idiosyncratic reaction]] leading to drug-induced [[hepatitis]]. The F.D.A. medical officer assigned to evaluate troglitazone, John Gueriguian, did not recommend its approval due to potential high liver toxicity; Parke-Davis complained to the FDA and Gueriguian was subsequently removed from his post.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/medtech/drugs/multimedia/2008/10/gallery_retired_drugs?slide=6&amp;slideView=6 Retired Drugs: Failed Blockbusters, Homicidal Tampering, Fatal Oversights], wired.com&lt;/ref&gt; A full panel of experts approved it in January 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s00125-006-0245-0 | title = Risks of troglitazone apparent before approval in USA | year = 2006 | last1 = Cohen | first1 = J. S. | journal = Diabetologia | volume = 49 | pages = 1454–5 | pmid = 16601971 | issue = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once the prevalence of adverse liver effects became known, troglitazone was withdrawn from the [[United Kingdom|British]] market in December 1997, from the [[United States]] market in 2000, and from the [[Japan]]ese market soon afterwards. It did not get approval in the rest of Europe.

==Mechanism of action==
Troglitazone, like the other [[thiazolidinedione]]s ([[pioglitazone]] and [[rosiglitazone]]), works by activating [[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor]]s (PPARs).

Troglitazone is a ligand to both PPARα and – more strongly – PPARγ. Troglitazone also contains an α-tocopheroyl moiety, potentially giving it [[vitamin E]]-like activity in addition to its PPAR activation. It has been shown to reduce [[inflammation]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Aljada A, Garg R, Ghanim H, etal |title=Nuclear factor-kappaB suppressive and inhibitor-kappaB stimulatory effects of troglitazone in obese patients with type 2 diabetes: evidence of an antiinflammatory action? |journal=J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. |volume=86 |issue=7 |pages=3250–6 |year=2001 |pmid=11443197 |doi=10.1210/jc.86.7.3250 }}&lt;/ref&gt; troglitazone use was associated with a decrease of [[NF-κB|nuclear factor kappa-B]] (NF-κB) and a concomitant increase in its inhibitor (IκB). NFκB is an important cellular transcription regulator for the immune response.

==History==
Troglitazone was developed as the first anti-diabetic drug having a mechanism of action involving the enhancement of insulin sensitivity.  At the time it was widely believed that such drugs, by addressing the primary metabolic defect associated with Type 2 diabetes, would have numerous benefits including avoiding the risk of hypoglycemia associated with insulin and earlier oral antidiabetic drugs.  It was further believed that reducing insulin resistance would potentially reduce the very high rate of cardiovascular disease that is associated with diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Henry RR |title=Effects of troglitazone on insulin sensitivity |journal=Diabet. Med. |volume=13 |issue=9 Suppl 6 |pages=S148–50 |date=September 1996  |pmid=8894499 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Keen H |title=Insulin resistance and the prevention of diabetes mellitus |journal=N.

[[Warner–Lambert|Parke-Davis/Warner Lambert]] submitted the diabetes drug Rezulin for [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (F.D.A.) review on July 31, 1996. The medical officer assigned to the review, Dr. John L. Gueriguian, cited Rezulin's potential to harm the liver and the heart and he questioned its viability in lowering blood sugar for patients with adult-onset diabetes, recommending against the drug's approval. After complaints from the drugmaker, Gueriguian was removed on November 4, 1996 and his review was purged by the F.D.A.&lt;ref name=LATimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=Willman&gt;{{cite news|last=Willman|first=David|title=The Rise and Fall of the Killer Drug Rezulin|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jun/04/news/mn-37375|accessdate=12 December 2012|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=4 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gueriguian and the company had a single meeting, at which Gueriguian used "intemperate" language; the company said its objections were based on inappropriate remarks made by Gueriguian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1998/Report-FDA-Removes-Medical-Officer/id-76dfa040579fe2d4f72b9b8f9df981d6 |title=Report: FDA Removes Medical Officer |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parke-Davis said at the advisory committee that the risk of liver toxicity was comparable to placebo and that additional data of other studies confirmed this.&lt;ref name=Avorn&gt;{{cite book|last=Avorn|first=J|title=Powerful medicines|year=2005|publisher=Vintage books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Peter Gøtzsche, when the company provided these additional data one week after approval, they showed a substantially greater risk for liver toxicity.&lt;ref name=gotzsche&gt;{{cite book|last=Gøtzsche|first=Peter|title=Deadly medicines and organised crime : how big pharma has corrupted healthcare|year=2013|publisher=Radcliffe Publ.|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=9781846198847|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The F.D.A. approved the drug on January 29, 1997, and it appeared in pharmacies in late March. At the time Dr. Solomon Sobel, a director at the F.D.A., overseeing diabetes drugs, said in a [[New York Times]] interview that adverse effects of troglitazone appeared to be rare and relatively mild.&lt;ref name=NYTapprove&gt;{{cite news|last=Leary|first=Warren|title=New Class of Diabetes Drug Is Approved|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/31/us/new-class-of-diabetes-drug-is-approved.html|accessdate=12 December 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=31 January 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 17, 1998, a 55-year-old patient named Audrey LaRue Jones died of [[acute liver failure]] after taking troglitazone.

Graham, an F.D.A. epidemiologist charged with evaluating the drug, warned on March 26, 1999 of the dangers of using it and concluded that patient monitoring was not effective in protecting against liver failure. He estimated that the drug could be linked to over 430 liver failures and that patients incurred 1,200 times greater risk of liver failure when taking Rezulin.&lt;ref name=Willman /&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimes2&gt;{{cite news|last=Willman|first=David|title=FDA's Approval and Delay in Withdrawing Rezulin Probed|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/6486|accessdate=12 December 2012|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=16 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Janet B. McGill, an endocrinologist who had assisted in the Warner–Lambert's early clinical testing of Rezulin, wrote in a March 1, 2000 letter to Sen. [[Edward M.

On March 21, 2000, the F.D.A. withdrew the drug from the market.&lt;ref name=FDAalert&gt;{{cite web|last=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|title=2000 Safety Alerts for Human Medical Products|url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm173081.htm|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Robert I.

Initially the metabolic toxicity was largely associated with reactive metabolite formation from the thiazolidinedione and chromane rings of troglitazone.  Moreover, the formation of quinone and o-quinone methide reactive metabolites were proposed to be formed by metabolic oxidation of the OH group of the chromane ring.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   Detailed quantum chemical analysis of the metabolic pathways for troglitazone has shown that quinone reactive metabolite is generated by oxidation of the OH group, but o-quinone methide reactive metabolite is formed by the oxidation of the methyl (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) groups ortho to the OH group of the chromane ring.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  This understanding has been recently used in the design of novel troglitazone derivatives with antiproliferative activity in breast cancer cell lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Synthesis of new troglitazone derivatives: Anti-proliferative activity in breast cancer cell lines and preliminary toxicological study|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0223523412001353|journal = European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry|date = 2012-05-01|pages = 206–215|volume = 51|doi = 10.1016/j.ejmech.2012.02.044|first = Stéphane|last = Salamone|first2 = Christelle|last2 = Colin|first3 = Isabelle|last3 = Grillier-Vuissoz|first4 = Sandra|last4 = Kuntz|first5 = Sabine|last5 = Mazerbourg|first6 = Stéphane|last6 = Flament|first7 = Hélène|last7 = Martin|first8 = Lysiane|last8 = Richert|first9 = Yves|last9 = Chapleur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuits==
In 2009 Pfizer Inc. resolved all but three of 35,000 claims over its withdrawn diabetes drug Rezulin for a total of about $750 million. Pfizer, which acquired rival Wyeth for almost $64 billion, paid about $500 million to settle Rezulin cases consolidated in federal court in New York, according to court filings. The company also paid as much as $250 million to resolve state-court suits. In 2004, it set aside $955 million to end Rezulin cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Feeley|first=Jef|title=Pfizer Ends Rezulin Cases With $205 Million to Spare|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=act0akCefQwo|accessdate=6 April 2014|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=March 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Trout Memo''', written in 1939, is a document comparing deception of an enemy in wartime with [[fly fishing]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/meet-true-inspiration-james-bond-151937797.html?guccounter=1&lt;/ref&gt; Issued under the name of [[John Henry Godfrey|Admiral John Godfrey]], Britain's director of naval intelligence, according to the historian Ben Macintyre it bore the hallmarks of having been written by Godrey's assistant, [[Ian Fleming]].&lt;ref name="MacIntyre"&gt;Ben MacIntyre, ''Operation Mincemeat: How a Dead Man and a Bizarre Plan Fooled the Nazis and Assured an Allied Victory'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=E6ZiYhuEW1MC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=Operation+Mincemeat+trout+memo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AGjv81VvHS&amp;sig=4OLrVaHaxRIJ8PtX4jwseBeYaJ0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jBIUTOAGw6qUB5qElPsL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Chapter 2.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The memo reads, in part: "The Trout Fisher casts patiently all day. He frequently changes his venue and his lures. If he has frightened a fish he may 'give the water a rest for half-an-hour,' but his main endeavour, viz. to attract fish by something he sends out from his boat, is incessant." The memo goes on to describe numerous ways that the enemy, like trout, may be fooled or lured in. 

One idea from the memo was broadly similar to [[Operation Mincemeat]], a World War II plan to convince the Germans that the Allies would attack Greece rather than Italy in 1943, although that idea was developed by Charles Cholmondeley in October 1942.&lt;ref name="MacIntyre"/&gt;    Confirmation of the success of the plan was sent to Churchill: "Mincemeat swallowed rod, line and sinker."
