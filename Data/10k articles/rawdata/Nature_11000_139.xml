[[File:SmallAsteroidImpacts-Frequency-Bolide-20141114.jpg|thumb|Bolides that disintegrated in the Earth's atmosphere worldwide, 1994–2013]]
On September&amp;nbsp;7, 2015, at about 08:40 [[Time in Thailand|local time]] a [[bolide]] meteor appeared over Thailand and burned up approximately 100&amp;nbsp;km (62&amp;nbsp;mi) above the ground.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://edition.cnn.com/2015/09/07/asia/bangkok-fireball/|title=Watch this Dash-Cam Footage of a Mysterious Fireball Blazing Over Bangkok|publisher=[[CNN]]| date=September 7, 2015| accessdate =September 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meteor briefly flared up producing a green and orange glow before disappearing without a sound of explosion and leaving a white smoke trail. The meteor was recorded by several [[dashcam]]s during the morning rush hour in [[Bangkok]],&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt; and sightings were also reported in Thai towns of [[Kanchanaburi]] and [[Nakhon Ratchasima]].&lt;ref name="bp"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/683596/mysterious-fireball-sighted-over-bangkok|title=Fireball hurtles over Thailand |work=[[Bangkok Post]]| date=September 7, 2015| accessdate =September 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meteor was visible for about four seconds before fading out. As of September 8, 2015 no [[strewn field]] has been found. The impact energy was the largest of 2015 at 3.9 [[TNT equivalent|kiloton]].&lt;ref name=jpl&gt;[http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/fireballs/ Fireball and Bolide Reports] (JPL)&lt;/ref&gt; The last impact this large was on 23 August 2014 over the Southern Ocean.&lt;ref name=jpl/&gt;

==Identification==
The object was initially believed to be FLOCK 1B-11 satellite which was due to burn in the atmosphere about that time&lt;ref name="bp"/&gt; or a crashing aircraft.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://time.com/4024251/fireball-bangkok/|title=Watch this Dash-Cam Footage of a Mysterious Fireball Blazing Over Bangkok|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]| date=September 7, 2015| accessdate =September 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because the object travelled in the direction opposite to the east–west axis of artificial satellites, it was identified by the Deputy Director of Thai National Astronomical Research Institute, Saran Poshyachinda, as "an asteroid"&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;{{efn|"Asteroid" may have been a mistranslation.}} and as a [[meteor]] by the president of the Thai Astronomical Society Prapee Viraporn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.bangkokpost.com/vdo/thailand/683700/meteor-explosion-captured-by-netizens|title='Meteor explosion' captured by netizens|work=[[Bangkok Post]]|date=September 7, 2015| accessdate =September 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object was also identified as a meteor by the Chachoengsao Observatory astronomer Worawit Tanwutthibundit.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; Tanwutthibundit, who witnessed the event, estimated the object's speed at nearly 50 miles per second before disintegration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/thailand/11848168/Mysterious-fireball-caught-on-camera-blazing-over-Bangkok.html|title=Mysterious 'fireball' caught on camera blazing over Bangkok|work=The Telegraph| accessdate =September 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar explanation was suggested by the former member of [[Hubble Space Telescope]] team, Phil Plait, who said that "it was almost certainly a good-sized rock burning up in our atmosphere".&lt;ref name="bp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="plait"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Plait|first1=Phil|authorlink=Phil Plait|title=Video of an Extremely Bright Fireball over Bangkok|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2015/09/07/bangkok_meteor_daytime_fireball.html|website=Bad Astronomy|publisher=Slate|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Plait, the object may have had a steep angle of entry.&lt;ref name="bp"/&gt;

Sound from the meteor was reported in three districts of [[Kanchanaburi Province]]: [[Thong Pha Phum District|Thong Pha Phum]], [[Sai Yok District|Sai Yok]] and [[Si Sawat District|Si Sawat]].&lt;ref name="nm"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.nationmultimedia.com/webmobile/national/Exploding-meteor-sends-social-media-into-a-tizzy-30268361.html|title=Exploding meteor sends social media into a tizzy|publisher=[[Nation Multimedia Group]]| date=September 8, 2015| accessdate =September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governor of Kanchanaburi Province Wan-chai Osukhonthip ordered police and [[Sai Yok National Park]] rangers to search [[Wang Krachae, Sai Yok District|Wang Krachae]] and [[Bong Ti]] subdistricts in Sai Yok District for meteor debris.&lt;ref name="nm"/&gt;

The [[National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand]] gave a press release on 14 September, estimating that the meteor was about 3.5 metres in diameter with a mass of 66 tonnes, entering the atmosphere at 21&amp;nbsp;km/s and having maximum brightness at 29.3&amp;nbsp;km altitude. The impact energy was equivalent to 3.5 kilotonnes of TNT; its trajectory was 269.8 degrees, with an impact angle of 45.4 degrees. It also estimates that meteorite remnants may have fallen around the area of [[Sai Yok National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=สดร. เผยหลักฐานล่าสุด ลูกไฟจากวัตถุขนาด 66 ตัน พุ่งชนบรรยากาศโลก เหนือฟ้าที่กาญจนบุรี|trans-title=NARIT: evidence reveals fireball caused by 66-tonne object impacting atmosphere over Kanchanaburi|url=http://www.narit.or.th/index.php/pr-news/2236-fireball-september-2558-narit|date=14 September 2015|publisher=National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand|accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The book begins with the discovery of a large number of deformed frogs by schoolteacher Cindy Reinitz and her students in August 1995. They were on a field trip to a farm owned by Donald Ney near the town of [[Henderson, Minnesota]].  As the students approached the rain-fed pond, they noticed that a large number of the northern leopard frogs ([[rana pipiens]]) had [[deformities]], such as missing legs, extra legs, and other disfigurements.  Concerned about the possibility that the deformities occurred because of a contaminant in the water, Ms. Reinitz contacted the [[Minnesota Pollution Control Agency]] (MPCA).  As the MPCA did not have an amphibian specialist at the time, Reinitz was referred to the MPCA's invertebrate researcher, Dr. Judy Helgen.  At the time Ms. Helgen was studying frogs as part of an effort to develop a bio-index for measuring the overall health of a pond or wetland.  As Helgen was busy at the time, she sent an intern, Joel Chirhart, to investigate the pond.  Chirhart is alarmed by the widespread nature of the deformities - present in over 1/3 of frogs collected.

Later that year, Ms. Helgen called Robert McKinnell, a biologist at the [[University of Minnesota]].  Mr. McKinnell is considered the authority on frogs in Minnesota, having specialized in [[herpetology]] for over 50 years.  While initially the two thought that the deformities were an isolated occurrence that would disappear like an earlier outbreak at [[Granite Falls, Minnesota|Granite Falls]], the persistence of leg deformities into late summer and the discovery of other outbreaks, elsewhere around Henderson and elsewhere around the state, such as at Litchfield, quickly disabused of that notion.

In that same month (August 1995), Dennis and Rhonda Bock found many deformed frogs near their lake in [[Brainerd, Minnesota]].  At first they were unconcerned, thinking the appearance of these frogs was a freak, but natural occurrence.  However, as more reports of frog deformities came from the rest of the state, they grew concerned and called the [[Minnesota Department of Natural Resources]] (DNR). While the DNR could not do anything about the frogs, they sent the information on to David Hoppe, a [[herpetologist]] at the [[University of Minnesota Morris]] campus.  Hoppe was unable to come to the Bock's lake until October, because of previous commitments. When he did manage to go to the Bock property, Hoppe was very surprised, as the Bocks lived on a relatively large natural lake, rather than on the small farm ponds where others had reported deformed frogs.  The presence of these deformities in both natural and man-made bodies of water cast doubt on the theory of chemical contamination, as the larger, natural lakes should not have been as susceptible to harboring high concentration of pollutants as smaller, man-made agricultural ponds.

The next year Hoppe, Helgen and McKinnell obtained a $150,000 grant from the state to study the frog deformities. Even more sightings of deformed frogs were reported that year. Short on funds, the MPCA managed to successfully confirm 21 sites with deformed animals. Of the 3000 deformed frogs collected, just under 12 percent had deformities.{{Clarify|date=June 2015}} However, there was a considerable variance in the incidence of deformities between sites and between collection intervals at the same site. As deformed frogs were more systematically collected and dissected, there was considerable evidence of internal abnormality.  Digestive systems and reproductive systems were especially hard hit, with some frogs "starving to death, despite being stuffed to bursting with food".  As the summer of 1996 progressed, Hoppe paid more attention to the Bock lake. Although the frogs at the lake seemed normal at the beginning of the summer, the number and variety of deformities rose dramatically as the season progressed.

As alarming as the findings at the various sites were, there was very little published material on the subject of frog deformities. Therefore, the researchers could not conclude that there was anything out of the ordinary, simply because they didn't know what the baseline rate of these deformities were.  A review of existing literature on the subject showed that although deformities were a known phenomenon, there was no precedent for the variety or the rate of deformity that was being observed.

As the mystery deepened, internal tensions within the investigative team mounted. David Hoppe became increasing concerned with protecting the integrity of sites from outside interference. He was especially concerned about the Bock's lake, labeled CWB ("Crow Wing county - Bock"), as it was one of the few natural bodies of water that had been affected by the deformities. While Helgen was also concerned about the integrity of sites, Hoppe felt that the MPCA, as a public agency was not well equipped to ensure site integrity.

The story then takes a detour and discusses the findings of Martin Ouellet, a French-Canadian biologist who was studying the effect of agricultural chemicals on frogs in the [[St. Lawrence River valley]].  Ouellet found that the frogs in agricultural ponds developed deformities at a significantly higher rate than frogs in natural control environments.  He had seen and noted the same abnormalities that were being discovered in [[Minnesota]].  He became convinced that the deformities were being caused by [[agricultural chemicals]].

After introducing Ouellet, the book moves on to a discussion of possible causes of frog deformities.  There are two main theories: parasites, and agricultural chemicals. The parasite theory, advocated by Stan Sessions stated that parasitic [[cysts]] from [[flatworms]] blocked [[limb bud]]s, forcing the [[tadpoles]] to try to adjust their limb development around the invaders.  The pollutant theory, pushed by McKinnell, stated that there were pollutants that were having [[teratogenic]] effects on the frogs.  The unknown pollutant or pollutants were theorized to be mimics of [[retinoic acid]]. Retinoic acid is a hormone that signals limb development in metamorphosing frogs.  The pollutant theory stated that these pollutants were disrupting retinoic acid levels in tadpoles, leading to missing or misplaced limbs, in addition to internal developmental abnormalities.

The rest of the book revolves around the interplay between advocates of these two theories.  As both sides move to gather evidence to support their theory (retinoic acid disruption vs. parasites) conflicts inevitably develop.  The book covers the emergence and development of those conflicts, especially between Sessions and Ouellet.

The book equivocates on the actual cause of the deformities.  It states that both parasites and deformities can be traced back to environmental changes caused by humans.  Parasite ranges are altered by [[global warming]].  Modern farming techniques rely on a large variety of chemicals, whose breakdown and interaction in the environment is still virtually unknown.  These changes create, as McKinnell puts it, a "quality of life" issue for amphibians.  The deformities in the frog population are a result of the extraordinary stresses thrust upon them by the modern world.

==Reviews==
[[Bill McKibben]] of ''[[The Washington Monthly]]'' has a favorable view of Souder's methodology "This is a revealing and important book, and you should begin by ignoring the subtitle. Something tells me it was not the author's choice: In fact, he's done a remarkably sober and meticulous job of following a story that's been misreported in almost every newspaper and on every TV station in the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/books/2000/0003.mckibben.html |title=Review: 'The Frog Factor' |work=The Washington Monthly, March 2000 |accessdate=June 11, 2015 |author=McKibben, Bill |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165245/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/books/2000/0003.mckibben.html |archivedate=March 3, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]]'', Paul Stephen Corn appreciates the book's accessibility "The book is written with little technical jargon and should be accessible to any biologically literate, nonprofessional reader. I also recommend this book to professional audiences, including undergraduates and early graduate students who still harbor illusions that science proceeds the way it is described in textbooks."

Annie Stewart of [[the Ecologist]] also appreciates the books easy to read tone "Souder manages to make frogs as fascinating to the casual reader as they are to the scientists who study them."

Ilse Heidmann of the [[Library Journal]] has a slightly negative review "While Souder's reporting is exhaustive, it is also repetitious and tiresome at times. Moreover, his frequent suggestions of a looming global catastrophe sound ominously alarmist. But who knows--maybe human extinction is not far behind."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1537">In physics, the '''accordion effect''', known also as the '''slinky effect''', '''concertina effect''', '''elastic band effect''', and '''string instability''', occurs when fluctuations in the motion of a travelling body causes disruptions in the flow of elements following it. This can happen in [[traffic|road traffic]], [[foot march|foot marching]], [[bicycle racing|bicycle]] and [[motor racing]], and, in general, to processes in a [[pipeline transport|pipeline]]. These are examples of [[nonlinear system|nonlinear processes]]. The accordion effect generally decreases the [[throughput]] of the system in which it occurs.

The accordion effect in road traffic refers to the typical decelerations and accelerations of a vehicle when the vehicle in front decelerates and accelerates. These fluctuations in speed propagate backwards and typically get bigger and bigger further down the line, decreasing the throughput of road traffic.

The '''Alaska-St. Elias Range tundra''' is an [[ecoregion]] of northwestern [[North America]].

==Setting==
This ecoregion consists of a long range of high rocky mountains of the [[Alaska Interior]] running north from the bottom of the [[Alaska Peninsula]], eastwards taking in the [[Alaska Range]] and southwards to include the [[Wrangell Mountains|Wrangell]] and [[St. Elias Mountains]] in eastern Alaska on the [[Canada–United States border|Canada–US border]] as far as [[Yakutat Bay]]. Across in Canada, the ecoregion includes the southwestern corner of the [[Yukon Territory]] and the northwestern corner of [[British Columbia]]. These mountains are largely covered with permanent ice and snow, with permanent snow above about 2150&amp;nbsp;m, and are separated by valleys filled with ice fields and great glaciers. There are small patches that are not under ice and consist of rock, rubble and alpine tundra. Elevations of the ecoregion range from sea level (on the western coast) to 600&amp;nbsp;m in the valleys, to peaks over 4,000&amp;nbsp;m. Indeed,  [[Denali]] (Mount McKinley), the highest peak in North America at 6,100&amp;nbsp;m, is located here, while the St Elias Mountains reach as high as 6000&amp;nbsp;m and are some of the highest peaks in Canada. This ecoregion is largely separated from the coast by the [[Pacific coastal mountain icefields and tundra]] so the climate is continental. Rainfall varies from 200&amp;nbsp;mm per year on the higher slopes to 400&amp;nbsp;mm per year in the lower areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=na1101|name=Alaska-St. Elias Range tundra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
[[Permafrost]] is everywhere on the higher slopes but there are patches of alpine [[tundra]] plant life at lower elevations, including mountain avens (''[[Dryas octopetala]]'') and ''[[Erica]]''s such as ''[[Vaccinium vitis-idaea]]'' and ''[[Cassiope tetragona]]''.

==Fauna==
Animals of the area include large [[brown bear]]s of [[Denali National Park and Preserve|Denali National Park]] and the southwestern coast near [[Iliamna Lake]] and [[Kamishak Bay]]. Other mammals include [[mountain goat]], [[caribou]], [[moose]], [[Dall sheep]], [[North American beaver]] and [[snowshoe hare]]. The rivers of the area are home to [[salmon]]. Birds include [[willow grouse]], [[Siberian tit]], [[wheatear]], [[Wilson's warbler]] and [[boreal chickadee]].

==Threats and preservation==
This is a largely unspoilt environment home to large predators, although there is some development associated with tourism, especially at [[Kantishna, Alaska|Kantishna]] near Denali Park, and some mining activity including the abandoned copper mining camp of [[Kennecott, Alaska]] in the [[Wrangell Mountains]] and coal mining at [[Nabesna, Alaska|Nabesna]] and [[Healy, Alaska]]. Protected areas include [[Lake Clark National Park and Preserve]], Denali National Park, the adjacent [[Denali State Park]], [[Tetlin National Wildlife Refuge]] and the [[Wrangell-St. Elias Park and Preserve]], all in Alaska, and parts of [[Tatshenshini–Alsek Provincial Park]] and [[Kluane National Park and Reserve]] in Canada.

'''''All Yesterdays''''' is an [[art book]] on the [[paleoart|palaeoartistic]] reconstruction of [[dinosaurs]] and other extinct animals by [[John_Conway_(palaeoartist)|John Conway]], C.M. Kosemen and [[Darren Naish]]. It was published in 2012.

==Overview==
The book first recounts the history of changing perceptions of dinosaurs as expressed in artwork. It begins with the sluggish and slow dinosaurs seen in the works of [[Charles R. Knight]], and then continues into analyzing reconstructions after the [[Dinosaur renaissance]]. It points out that these reconstructions do not take the often bizarre [[Integumentary system|integumentary coverings]] of living animals into account, and that dinosaurs should be portrayed as natural animals that aren't 'shrink-wrapped' with many of the individual bones visible.

The remainder of the book consists of pictures with accompanying explanatory texts. Each picture displays a hypothetical adaptation that an extinct animal could have possessed, such as a [[plesiosaur]] disguised on the seafloor like a [[decorator crab]] or something that dinosaurs aren't usually shown doing, such as a sleeping ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. The texts describe the adaptations or habits and explain why they are plausible. Some of the entries are deliberately made to break a paleoartistic cliché, such as a ''[[Tenontosaurus]]'' walking alone without a predatory ''[[Deinonychus]]'' in sight (''Tenontosaurus'' is almost exclusively depicted in dinosaur art as the prey of ''Deinonychus'').

The second and last major section of the book is titled "All Todays", and depicts animals from the present day as if non-human paleontologists from the future were reconstructing them from fossilized skeletons. Some of the creatures are somewhat recognizable, like a [[vulture]] depicted with [[pterosaur]]-like wings; others are completely unrecognizable, like a [[rhinoceros]] reconstructed with no nose horn and a sail instead of a hump. By showing how completely extant animals might be misunderstood if known only from skeletal remains, ''All Yesterdays'' shows that our own conceptions of extinct animals are likely equally mistaken.

==Reception==

''All Yesterdays'' has received mostly very enthusiastic reviews from palaeontologists, and is perceived as introducing or popularising a new "third wave" approach to palaeoart after the classical period of Knight, [[Rudolph F. Zallinger|Zallinger]], [[Zdeněk Burian|Burian]] and others, and the more modern work of [[Robert T. Bakker|Bakker]], [[Gregory S. Paul|Paul]], [[Doug Henderson (artist)|Henderson]] and others. For example, John Hutchinson of the Royal Veterinary College wrote "This is a thinking person’s book ... for rumination, to challenge your preconceptions, not to have a flashy coffee table book. It’s not eye candy — it’s more like brain jerky."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hutchinson|first1=John|title=Yes- another day, another positive "All Yesterdays" book review|url=http://whatsinjohnsfreezer.com/2013/03/17/all-yesterdays-review/|website=What's In John's Freezer?|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; And Mike Taylor wrote "''All Yesterdays'' is not only the most beautiful but also the most important palaeoart book of the last four decades".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Mike|title=Review: All Yesterdays (Conway, Kosemen and Naish)|url=http://svpow.com/2012/11/29/review-all-yesterdays-conway-koseman-and-naish/|website=Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the Week|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute''', or '''AARI''' ({{lang-ru|Арктический и антарктический научно-исследовательский институт}}, abbreviated as '''ААНИИ''') is the oldest and largest [[Russia]]n research institute in the field of comprehensive studies of [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctica]]. It is located in [[Saint Petersburg]]. 

The AARI has numerous departments, such as those of [[oceanography]], [[glaciology]], [[meteorology]], [[hydrology]] or Arctic river mouths and water resources, [[geophysics]], polar geography, and others. It also has its own computer center, ice research laboratory, experimental workshops, and a museum (the [[Arctic and Antarctic Museum]]). 

Scientists, such as [[Alexander Karpinsky]], [[Alexander Fersman]], [[Yuly Shokalsky]], [[Nikolai Mikhailovich Knipovich|Nikolai Knipovich]], [[Lev Berg]], [[Otto Schmidt]], [[Rudolf Samoylovich]], [[Professor Vize|Vladimir Vize]], [[Nikolai Zubov]], [[Pyotr Shirshov]], [[Nikolai Urvantsev]], and [[Yakov Gakkel]] have all made their valuable contributions to the work of the AARI.

Throughout its history, the AARI has organized more than a thousand Arctic expeditions, including dozens of high-latitude aerial expeditions, which transported 34(?) manned [[Soviet and Russian manned drifting ice stations|drifting ice station]]s ''Severniy Polyus'' ("Северный полюс", or North Pole) to Central Arctic. 
==History==
The AARI was founded on 3 March 1920 as the '''Northern Research and Trade Expedition''' (Северная научно-промысловая экспедиция) under the Scientific and Technical Department of the [[Vesenkha|All-Union Council of State Economy]]. In 1925, the expedition was reorganized into the '''Institute of Northern Studies''' (Институт по изучению Севера) and five years later - into the '''All-Union Arctic Institute''' (Всесоюзный арктический институт). In 1932, the institute was integrated into the [[Chief Directorate of the Northern Sea Route]] (Главное управление Северного морского пути). In 1948 the Arctic Geology Research Institute (Научно-исследовательский институт геологии Арктики, or НИИГА) was established on the basis of the [[geology]] department of the All-Union Arctic Institute, which would subordinate to the [[Ministry of Geology of the USSR]]. 

In 1955, the AARI participated in the organization of Antarctic research. In 1958, it began to organize and lead all of the Soviet Antarctic expeditions, which would later make many geographic discoveries, and in the same year the [[All-Union]] Arctic Institute was renamed '''Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute'''. In 1963, the AARI was incorporated into the [[Hydrometeorological Service of the USSR|Chief Administration of the Hydrometeorological Service]] (Главное управление Гидрометеослужбы) under the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers of the USSR]] (now [[Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring of Russia]]).

In 1967, AARI was awarded the [[Order of Lenin]]. In 1968, the institute engaged in research of the areas of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] contiguous to the Arctic and Antarctica.

The microwaves are emitted from the waveguide aperture ''(top)'' which in use is attached to a waveguide conducting the microwaves to the radar antenna. Modern tubes use [[rare earth magnet]]s which are much less bulky. ]]

The '''cavity magnetron''' is a high-powered [[vacuum tube]] that generates [[microwave]]s using the interaction of a stream of [[electron]]s with a [[magnetic field]] while moving past a series of open metal cavities ([[cavity resonator]]s). Electrons pass by the openings to these cavities and cause radio waves to oscillate within, similar to the way a whistle produces a tone when excited by an air stream blown past its opening. The [[frequency]] of the microwaves produced, the [[resonant frequency]], is determined by the cavities' physical dimensions.  Unlike other vacuum tubes such as a [[klystron]] or a [[traveling-wave tube]] (TWT), the magnetron cannot function as an [[amplifier]] in order to increase the intensity of an applied microwave signal; the magnetron serves solely as an [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]], generating a microwave signal from direct current electricity supplied to the vacuum tube.

An early form of magnetron was invented by H. Gerdien in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1090&amp;context=ece_etds |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120084756/http://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1090&amp;context=ece_etds |archivedate=2016-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another form of magnetron tube, the split-anode magnetron, was invented by [[Albert Hull]] of [[General Electric Research Laboratory]] in 1920, but it achieved only a frequency of 30 kHz.&lt;ref name = Redhead&gt;Redhead, Paul A., "The Invention of the Cavity Magnetron and its Introduction into Canada and the U.S.A.", ''La Physique au Canada'', November 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar devices were experimented with by many teams through the 1920s and 1930s. [[Hans Hollmann|Hans Erich Hollmann]] filed a patent on a design similar to the modern tube in 1935,&lt;ref name=Hollmann/&gt; but the more stable [[klystron]] was preferred for most [[History of radar#Germany|German radars]] during [[World War II]]. An important advance was the multi-cavity magnetron, first proposed in 1934 by A. L. Samuel of [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]]. However, the first truly successful example was developed by Aleksereff and Malearoff in Russia in 1936, which achieved 300 watts at [[GHz|3&amp;nbsp;GHz]] ([[centimeter|10&amp;nbsp;cm]] [[wavelength]]).&lt;ref name = Redhead/&gt;

The cavity magnetron was radically improved by [[John Randall (physicist)|John Randall]] and [[Harry Boot]] in 1940 at the [[University of Birmingham]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Magnetron |url=http://histru.bournemouth.ac.uk/Oral_History/Talking_About_Technology/radar_research/the_magnetron.html |date=1995–2009 |publisher=Bournemouth University |accessdate=23 August 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726124412/http://histru.bournemouth.ac.uk/Oral_History/Talking_About_Technology/radar_research/the_magnetron.html |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They invented a valve that could produce multi-[[kilowatt]] pulses at 10&amp;nbsp;cm wavelength, an unprecedented discovery.&lt;ref name="Magnetron"/&gt; The high power of pulses from their device made centimeter-band [[radar]] practical for the [[Allies of World War II]], with shorter wavelength radars allowing detection of smaller objects from smaller antennas.

At the same time, [[Yoji Ito]] in Japan was experimenting with magnetrons, and proposed a system of collision avoidance using FM. Only low power was achieved. Ito then traveled to Germany, where he had earlier received his doctorate, and found the Germans were using pulse modulation at VHF with great success. When he returned to Japan, he produced a prototype pulse magnetron with 2 kW in October 1941. This was then widely deployed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nakajima, S.|doi=10.1109/74.180636|title=Japanese radar development prior to 1945|year=1992|journal=IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine|volume=34|issue=6|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the post-war era the magnetron became less widely used in the radar role. This was because the magnetron's output changes from pulse to pulse, both in frequency and phase. This makes the signal unsuitable for pulse-to-pulse comparisons, which is widely used for detecting and removing "[[Clutter (radar)|clutter]]" from the radar display.&lt;ref name="brookner"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brookner|first1=Eli|title=From $10,000 magee to $7 magee and $10 transmitter and receiver (T/R) on single chip|journal=2010 International Conference on the Origins and Evolution of the Cavity Magnetron|date=19–20 April 2010|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5565574|accessdate=16 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426232318/http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5565574|archivedate=26 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnetron remains in use in some radars, but has become much more common as a low-cost microwave source for [[microwave oven]]s.

==Construction and operation==

===Conventional tube design===
In a conventional electron tube ([[vacuum tube]]), [[electrons]] are emitted from a negatively charged, heated component called the [[cathode]] and are attracted to a positively charged component called the [[anode]]. The components are normally arranged concentrically, placed within a tubular-shaped container from which all air has been evacuated, so that the electrons can move freely (hence the name "vacuum" tubes, called "valves" by the British)

If a third electrode is inserted between the cathode and the anode (called a [[control grid]]), the flow of electrons between the cathode and anode can be regulated by varying the voltage on this third electrode. This allows the resulting electron tube (called a "[[triode]]" because it now has three electrodes) to function as an [[amplifier]] because small variations in the electric charge applied to the control grid will result in identical variations in the much larger current of electrons flowing between the cathode and anode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zipcon.net/~swhite/docs/physics/electronics/Valves.html|title=Electric Valves: Diodes, Triodes, and Transistors|first=Steve|last=White|date=|website=zipcon.net|accessdate=5 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825070438/http://www.zipcon.net/~swhite/docs/physics/electronics/Valves.html|archivedate=25 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hull or single-anode magnetron===
The idea of using a grid for control was patented by [[Lee de Forest]], resulting in considerable research into alternate tube designs that would avoid his patents. One concept used a magnetic field instead of an electrical charge to control current flow, leading to the development of the magnetron tube. In this design, the tube was made with two electrodes, typically with the cathode in the form of a metal rod in the center, and the anode as a cylinder around it. The tube was placed between the poles of a [[horseshoe magnet]]&lt;ref name=mag&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electriciantraining.tpub.com/14183/css/14183_103.htm|title=The Magnetron|author=|date=|website=electriciantraining.tpub.com|accessdate=5 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303222027/http://electriciantraining.tpub.com/14183/css/14183_103.htm|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; arranged such that the magnetic field was aligned parallel to the axis of the electrodes.

With no magnetic field present, the tube operates as a diode, with electrons flowing directly from the cathode to the anode.  In the presence of the magnetic field, the electrons will experience a force at right angles to their direction of motion, according to the [[left-hand rule]]. In this case, the electrons follow a curved path between the cathode and anode. The curvature of the path can be controlled by varying either the magnetic field, using an [[electromagnet]], or by changing the electrical potential between the electrodes.

At very high magnetic field settings the electrons are forced back onto the cathode, preventing current flow. At the opposite extreme, with no field, the electrons are free to flow straight from the cathode to the anode. There is a point between the two extremes, the '''critical value''' or '''Hull cut-off magnetic field''' (and cut-off voltage), where the electrons just reach the anode. At fields around this point, the device operates similar to a triode. However, magnetic control, due to [[hysteresis]] and other effects, results in a slower and less faithful response to control current than electrostatic control using a control grid in a conventional triode (not to mention greater weight and complexity), so magnetrons saw limited use in conventional electronic designs.&lt;ref name=mag/&gt;

It was noticed that when the magnetron was operating at the critical value, it would emit energy in the [[radio frequency]] spectrum.&lt;ref name=mag/&gt; This occurs because a few of the electrons, instead of reaching the anode, continue to circle in the space between the cathode and the anode. Due to an effect now known as [[cyclotron radiation]], these electrons radiate radio frequency energy. The effect is not very efficient. Eventually the electrons hit one of the electrodes, so the number in the circulating state at any given time is a small percentage of the overall current. It was also noticed that the frequency of the radiation depends on the size of the tube, and even early examples were built that produced signals in the microwave region.

Early conventional tube systems were limited to the [[high frequency]] bands, and although [[very high frequency]] systems became widely available in the late 1930s, the ultra high frequency and microwave regions were well beyond the ability of conventional circuits. The magnetron was one of the few devices able to generate signals in the microwave band and it was the only one that was able to produce high power at centimeter wavelengths.

===Split-anode magnetron===
[[File:Split-anode magnetron.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Split-anode magnetron from 1935. ''(left)'' The bare tube, about 11 cm high. ''(right)'' Installed for use between the poles of a strong [[permanent magnet]] ]]
The original magnetron was very difficult to keep operating at the critical value, and even then the number of electrons in the circling state at any time was fairly low. This meant that it produced very low-power signals. Nevertheless, as one of the few devices known to create microwaves, interest in the device and potential improvements was widespread.

The first major improvement was the '''split-anode magnetron''', also known as a '''negative-resistance magnetron'''. As the name implies, this design used an anode that was split in two—one at each end of the tube—creating two half-cylinders. When both were charged to the same voltage the system worked like the original model. But by slightly altering the voltage of the two plates, the electron's trajectory could be modified so that they would naturally travel towards the lower voltage side. The plates were connected to an oscillator that reversed the relative voltage of the two plates at a given frequency.&lt;ref name=mag/&gt;

At any given instant, the electron will naturally be pushed towards the lower-voltage side of the tube. The electron will then oscillate back and forth as the voltage changes. At the same time, a strong magnetic field is applied, stronger than the critical value in the original design. This would normally cause the electron to circle back to the cathode, but due to the oscillating electrical field, the electron instead follows a looping path that continues toward the anodes.&lt;ref name=mag/&gt;

Since all of the electrons in the flow experienced this looping motion, the amount of RF energy being radiated was greatly improved. And as the motion occurred at any field level beyond the critical value, it was no longer necessary to carefully tune the fields and voltages, and the overall stability of the device was greatly improved. Unfortunately, the higher field also meant that electrons often circled back to the cathode, depositing their energy on it and causing it to heat up. As this normally causes more electrons to be released, it could sometimes lead to a runaway effect, damaging the device.&lt;ref name=mag/&gt;

===Cavity magnetron===
The great advance in magnetron design was the '''[[resonator|resonant cavity]] magnetron''' or '''electron-resonance magnetron''', which works on entirely different principles. In this design the oscillation is created by the physical shaping of the anode, rather than external circuits or fields.

[[Image:Resonant Cavity Magnetron Diagram.png|thumb|right|A cross-sectional diagram of a [[resonator|resonant cavity]] magnetron. Magnetic lines of force are parallel to the geometric axis of this structure.]]

Mechanically, the cavity magnetron consists of a large, solid cylinder of metal with a hole drilled through the center of the circular face. A wire acting as the cathode is run down the center of this hole, and the metal block itself forms the anode. Around this hole, known as the "interaction space", are a number of similar holes ("resonators") drilled parallel to the interaction space, separated only a very short distance away. A small slot is cut between the interaction space and each of these resonators. The resulting block looks something like the cylinder on a [[revolver]], with a somewhat larger central hole. (Early models were actually cut using [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt pistol]] jigs.) The parallel sides of the slots act as a [[capacitor]] while the anode block itself provides an [[inductor]] analog. Thus, each cavity forms its own resonant circuit, the frequency of which is defined by the energy of the electrons and the physical dimensions of the cavity.&lt;ref name=mag/&gt;

The magnetic field is set to a value well below the critical, so the electrons follow arcing paths towards the anode. When they strike the anode, they cause it to become negatively charged in that region. As this process is random, some areas will become more or less charged than the areas around them. The anode is constructed of a highly conductive material, almost always copper, so these differences in voltage cause currents to appear to even them out. Since the current has to flow around the outside of the cavity, this process takes time. During that time additional electrons will avoid the hot spots and be deposited further along the anode, as the additional current flowing around it arrives too. This causes an oscillating current to form as the current tries to equalize one spot, then another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/waves/magnetron.html|title=Magnetron Operation|author=|date=|website=hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu|accessdate=5 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911224636/http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Waves/magnetron.html|archivedate=11 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oscillating currents flowing around the cavities, and their effect on the electron flow within the tube, causes large amounts of microwave radiofrequency energy to be generated in the cavities. The cavities are open on one end, so the entire mechanism forms a single, larger, microwave oscillator. A "tap", normally a wire formed into a loop, extracts microwave energy from one of the cavities. In some systems the tap wire is replaced by an open hole, which allows the microwaves to flow into a [[waveguide]].

As the oscillation takes some time to set up, and is inherently random at the start, subsequent startups will have different output parameters. Phase is almost never preserved, which makes the magnetron difficult to use in [[phased array]] systems. Frequency also drifts from pulse to pulse, a more difficult problem for a wider array of radar systems. Neither of these present a problem for [[continuous-wave radar]]s, nor for microwave ovens.

==Common features==
[[File:Magnetron cutaway drawing.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Cutaway drawing of a cavity magnetron from 1984.  Part of the righthand magnet and copper anode block is cut away to show the cathode and cavities.  This older magnetron uses two horseshoe shaped [[alnico]] magnets, modern tubes use [[rare earth magnet]]s. ]]
All cavity magnetrons consist of a heated [[cathode]] placed at a high (continuous or pulsed) negative potential created by a high-voltage, direct-current power supply. The cathode is placed in the center of an [[vacuum|evacuated]], lobed, circular chamber. A magnetic field parallel to the filament is imposed by a [[permanent magnet]]. The magnetic field causes the electrons, attracted to the (relatively) positive outer part of the chamber, to spiral outward in a circular path, a consequence of the [[Lorentz force]]. Spaced around the rim of the chamber are cylindrical cavities. Slots are cut along the length of the cavities that open into the central, common cavity space. As electrons sweep past these slots, they induce a high-frequency radio field in each resonant cavity, which in turn causes the electrons to bunch into groups. (This principle of [[cavity resonator]] is very similar to blowing a stream of air across the open top of a glass pop bottle.) A portion of the radio frequency energy is extracted by a short antenna that is connected to a [[waveguide (electromagnetism)|waveguide]] (a metal tube, usually of rectangular cross section). The waveguide directs the extracted RF energy to the load, which may be a cooking chamber in a microwave oven or a high-gain [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] in the case of radar.

The sizes of the cavities determine the resonant frequency, and thereby the frequency of the emitted microwaves. However, the frequency is not precisely controllable. The operating frequency varies with changes in load [[wave impedance|impedance]], with changes in the supply current, and with the temperature of the tube.&lt;ref name="Turner76"/&gt; This is not a problem in uses such as heating, or in some forms of [[radar]] where the receiver can be synchronized with an imprecise magnetron frequency. Where precise frequencies are needed, other devices, such as the [[klystron]] are used.

The magnetron is a self-oscillating device requiring no external elements other than a power supply.  A well-defined threshold anode voltage must be applied before oscillation will build up; this voltage is a function of the dimensions of the resonant cavity, and the applied magnetic field. In pulsed applications there is a delay of several cycles before the oscillator achieves full peak power, and the build-up of anode voltage must be coordinated with the build-up of oscillator output.&lt;ref name=Turner76&gt;L.W. Turner,(ed),'' Electronics Engineer's Reference Book, 4th ed.'' Newnes-Butterworth, London 1976 {{ISBN|9780408001687}}, pages 7-71 to 7-77&lt;/ref&gt;

Where there are an even number of cavities, two concentric rings can connect alternate cavity walls to prevent inefficient modes of oscillation. This is called pi-strapping because the two straps lock the phase difference between adjacent cavities at pi radians (180°).

The modern magnetron is a fairly efficient device. In a microwave oven, for instance, a 1.1-kilowatt input will generally create about 700 watts of microwave power, an efficiency of around 65%. (The high-voltage and the properties of the cathode determine the power of a magnetron.) Large [[S band]] magnetrons can produce up to 2.5 megawatts peak power with an average power of 3.75&amp;nbsp;kW.&lt;ref name="Turner76"/&gt; Some large magnetrons are water cooled. The magnetron remains in widespread use in roles which require high power, but where precise control over frequency and phase is unimportant.

==Applications==

===Radar===
[[File:Magnetron radar assembly 1947.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|9.375&amp;nbsp;GHz 20&amp;nbsp;kW (peak) magnetron assembly for an early commercial airport radar in 1947.  In addition to the magnetron ''(right)'', it contains a TR (transmit/receive) switch tube and the [[superheterodyne]] receiver front end, a 2K25 [[reflex klystron]] tube [[local oscillator]] and a 1N21 [[germanium diode]] mixer. The waveguide aperture ''(left)'' is connected to the waveguide going to the antenna.]] 
{{Main|History of radar#Centimetric radar|l1=History of radar (Centimetric radar)}}

In a [[radar]] set, the magnetron's waveguide is connected to an [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]]. The magnetron is operated with very short pulses of applied voltage, resulting in a short pulse of high power microwave energy being radiated. As in all primary radar systems, the radiation reflected off a target is analyzed to produce a radar map on a screen.

Several characteristics of the magnetron's output make radar use of the device somewhat problematic. The first of these factors is the magnetron's inherent instability in its transmitter frequency. This instability results not only in frequency shifts from one pulse to the next, but also a frequency shift within an individual transmitted pulse. The second factor is that the energy of the transmitted pulse is spread over a relatively wide frequency spectrum, which requires the receiver to have a correspondingly wide bandwidth. This wide bandwidth allows ambient electrical noise to be accepted into the receiver, thus obscuring somewhat the weak radar echoes, thereby reducing overall receiver [[signal-to-noise ratio]] and thus performance.   The third factor, depending on application, is the radiation hazard caused by the use of high power electromagnetic radiation. In some applications, for example a [[marine radar]] mounted on a recreational vessel, a radar with a magnetron output of 2 to 4 kilowatts is often found mounted very near an area occupied by crew or passengers. In practical use these factors have been overcome, or merely accepted, and there are today thousands of magnetron aviation and marine radar units in service.  Recent advances in aviation weather avoidance radar and in marine radar have successfully replaced the magnetron with [[semiconductor]] microwave oscillators, which have a narrower output frequency range.  These allow a narrower receiver bandwidth to be used, and the higher signal to noise ratio in turn allows a lower transmitter power, reducing exposure to EMR.

===Heating===
[[Image:Magnetron1.jpg|thumb|Magnetron from a [[microwave oven]] with magnet in its mounting box. The horizontal plates form a [[heat sink]], cooled by airflow from a fan.  The magnetic field is produced by two powerful ring magnets, the lower of which is just visible. Almost all modern oven magnetrons are of similar layout and appearance.]]
In [[microwave oven]]s, the waveguide leads to a radio frequency-transparent port into the cooking chamber. As the fixed dimensions of the chamber, and its physical closeness to the magnetron, would normally create standing wave patterns in the chamber, the pattern is randomized by a motorized fan-like ''stirrer'' in the waveguide (more often in commercial ovens), or by a turntable that rotates the food (most common in non-commercial ovens).

===Lighting===
In microwave-excited lighting systems, such as a [[sulfur lamp]], a magnetron provides the microwave field that is passed through a waveguide to the lighting cavity containing the light-emitting substance (e.g., sulfur, metal halides, etc.).  Although efficient, these lamps are much more complex than other methods of lighting and therefore not commonly used.
More modern variants use HEMTs or GaN-on-SiC power semiconductors to generate the microwaves, which are substantially less complex and can be adjusted to maximize light output using a PID system.

In the US, [[Albert Hull]] put this work to use in an attempt to bypass [[Western Electric]]'s patents on the triode. Western Electric had gained control of this design by buying [[Lee De Forest]]'s patents on the control of current flow using electric fields via the "grid". Hull intended to use a variable magnetic field, instead of an electrostatic one, to control the flow of the electrons from the cathode to the anode. Working at [[General Electric]]'s Research Laboratories in [[Schenectady, New York]], Hull built tubes that provided switching through the control of the ratio of the magnetic and electric field strengths. He released several papers and patents on the concept in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;See:

But klystrons could not at that time achieve the high power output that magnetrons eventually reached.

Because France had just fallen to the [[Nazi]]s and Britain had no money to develop the magnetron on a massive scale, [[Winston Churchill]] agreed that [[Henry Tizard|Sir Henry Tizard]] should offer the magnetron to the Americans in exchange for their financial and industrial help.&lt;ref name="Magnetron"/&gt; An early 10 [[Kilowatt|kW]] version, built in England by the [[General Electric Company plc|General Electric Company]] Research Laboratories, [[Wembley]], [[London]] (not to be confused with the similarly named American company General Electric), was taken on the Tizard Mission in September 1940. As the discussion turned to radar, the US Navy representatives began to detail the problems with their short-wavelength systems, complaining that their klystrons could only produce 10&amp;nbsp;W. With a flourish, [[Edward George Bowen|"Taffey" Bowen]] pulled out a magnetron and explained it produced 1000 times that.&lt;ref name="Magnetron"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harford|first1=Tim|title=How the search for a 'death ray' led to radar|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41188464|accessdate=9 October 2017|work=BBC World Service|date=9 October 2017|quote=The magnetron stunned the Americans.

[[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] took the example and quickly began making copies, and before the end of 1940, the [[Radiation Laboratory]] had been set up on the campus of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] to develop various types of radar using the magnetron. By early 1941, portable centimetric airborne radars were being tested in American and British aircraft.&lt;ref name="Magnetron"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6331897.stm |title=Briefcase 'that changed the world' |publisher=BBC News |author=Angela Hind |date=February 5, 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115140606/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6331897.stm |archivedate=November 15, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1941, the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment]] in Great Britain used the magnetron to develop a revolutionary airborne, ground-mapping radar codenamed H2S. The [[H2S radar]] was in part developed by [[Alan Blumlein]] and [[Bernard Lovell]].

The cavity magnetron was widely used during [[World War II]] in microwave radar equipment and is often credited with giving Allied radar a considerable performance advantage over [[Germany|German]] and [[Japan]]ese radars, thus directly influencing the outcome of the war. It was later described by American historian [[James Phinney Baxter III]] as "[t]he most valuable cargo ever brought to our shores".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baxter|first1=James Phinney (III)|title=Scientists Against Time|date=1946|publisher=Little, Brown, and Co.|location=Boston, Massachusetts, USA|pages=142}} (Baxter was the official historian of the Office of Scientific Research and Development.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Centimetric radar, made possible by the cavity magnetron, allowed for the detection of much smaller objects and the use of much smaller antennas. The combination of small-cavity magnetrons, small antennas, and high resolution allowed small, high quality radars to be installed in aircraft. They could be used by maritime patrol aircraft to detect objects as small as a submarine periscope, which allowed aircraft to attack and destroy submerged submarines which had previously been undetectable from the air. Centimetric contour mapping radars like [[H2S radar|H2S]] improved the accuracy of Allied bombers used in the [[strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing campaign]], despite the existence of the German [[Naxos radar detector|FuG 350 ''Naxos'']] device to specifically detect it. Centimetric gun-laying radars were likewise far more accurate than the older technology. They made the big-gunned Allied battleships more deadly and, along with the newly developed [[proximity fuze]], made anti-aircraft guns much more dangerous to attacking aircraft. The two coupled together and used by anti-aircraft batteries, placed along the flight path of German [[V-1 flying bomb]]s on their way to [[London]], are credited with destroying many of the flying bombs before they reached their target.

Since then, many millions of cavity magnetrons have been manufactured; while some have been for radar the vast majority have been for [[microwave oven]]s. The use in radar itself has dwindled to some extent, as more accurate signals have generally been needed and developers have moved to [[klystron]] and [[traveling-wave tube]] systems for these needs.

==Health hazards==
[[Image:Radio waves hazard symbol.svg|thumb|150px|Caution: radiowaves hazard]]
[[Image:D-W003 Warnung vor giftigen Stoffen ty.svg|thumb|150px|right|Caution: Poisonous particles for the lungs]]

At least one hazard in particular is well known and documented. As the [[Lens (vision)|lens]] of the [[Human eye|eye]] has no cooling blood flow, it is particularly prone to overheating when exposed to microwave radiation. This heating can in turn lead to a higher incidence of [[cataract]]s in later life.&lt;ref name=Lipman1&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[microwave oven]] with a warped door or poor microwave sealing can be hazardous.

There is also a considerable electrical hazard around magnetrons, as they require a high voltage power supply.

Some magnetrons have [[beryllium oxide]] (beryllia) ceramic insulators, which are dangerous if crushed and inhaled, or otherwise ingested. Single or chronic exposure can lead to [[berylliosis]], an incurable lung condition. In addition, beryllia is listed as a confirmed human carcinogen by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]]; therefore, broken ceramic insulators or magnetrons should not be directly handled.

All magnetrons contain a small amount of [[thorium]] mixed with [[tungsten]] in their [[Hot cathode|filament]]. While this is a radioactive metal, the risk of cancer is low as it never gets airborne in normal usage. Only if the filament is taken out of the magnetron, finely crushed, and inhaled can it pose a health hazard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansto.gov.au/NuclearFacts/BenefitsofNuclearScience/Inthehome/|title=In the home - ANSTO|first=corporateName=Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation; address=New Illawarra Road, Lucas Heights NSW 2234 Australia; contact=+61 2 9717|last=3111|date=|website=www.ansto.gov.au|accessdate=5 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905142025/http://www.ansto.gov.au/NuclearFacts/BenefitsofNuclearScience/Inthehome/|archivedate=5 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineerguy.com/elements/videos/video-microwave.htm|title=EngineerGuy Video: microwave oven|author=|date=|website=www.engineerguy.com|accessdate=5 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905142309/http://www.engineerguy.com/elements/videos/video-microwave.htm|archivedate=5 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/radiation/radionuclides/thorium.html#exposure|title=Radiation Protection - US EPA|first=US|last=EPA,OAR,ORIA,RPD|date=|website=US EPA|accessdate=5 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001225000/http://www.epa.gov/radiation/radionuclides/thorium.htm#exposure|archivedate=1 October 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6858">A cornertube boiler is a type of natural circulation [[water-tube boiler]] which differentiates itself from other water tube boilers by its characteristic water-steam cycle and a pre-separation of heated steam from the steam-water mixture occurs outside the drum and the unheated downcomers.&lt;ref name='Thome-Kozmiensky' &gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principle ==
Cornertube boilers were developed for small steam output. The design was based around two factors that, along with excellent water circulation, should be appropriate cooling even at light loads. Its special feature is its [[Monocoque]] body i.e. the unheated downcomers form the supporting frame work&lt;ref name ='May' &gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Put simply, the water circulation takes place simultaneously through the drum and through the unheated down comers outside the drum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|last=Vorkauf|first=Henrich|title=Der Wasserumlauf in Eckrohrkessel|year=1957|publisher=Energie|location=Germany|page=3
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
During [[World War II]] a shortage of fuels like gas and petrol alongside the idea of running diesel engines with Steam occurred and led to the development of a new type of boiler.&lt;ref name = 'Noot' &gt;{{cite book
  |last=Noot  |first=Wolfgang

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dr. Henrich Vorkauf]] came up with the first design of a new natural circulation boiler which was then installed into a truck in the year 1944.&lt;ref name ='May' /&gt;
Using this principle Dr. Vorkauf developed a single drum boiler with downcomers in four corners and named this boiler Eckrohrkessel (German name). Corner Tube Boiler is word to word translation of '''Eckrohrkessel''', '''''(Eck=Corner, rohr=tube and kessel=boiler)'''''

== Working ==
[[File:Water circulation concept in corner tube boiler.jpeg|thumbnail|right|Schematic working of water circulation in corner tube boiler]]
The water flows down from the drum (6) through the down comers (7) and it is distributed in the different riser tubes(4). The steam-water mixture circulates and flows in the upward direction through the riser tubes. In the radiation heated area through the pre-separator (also known as cross-collector) (3),occurs the pre-separation of steam from the steam water mixture. The separated steam flows through the overhead pipe (5) and the steam-water mixture flows through the collector pipe (3) to the drum (6) as well.In the drum occurs the final separation of steam from steam water mixture. The rest amount of water flows through the unheated return tubes (1) and downcomers (7) to the rear wall distributor/header (2). Due to the water returning from the unheated downcomers (1) a lively circulation takes place .&lt;ref&gt;

== Advantages ==
*Self supporting construction by the four downcomers, i.e. the four downcomers in the four corners contribute to a rigid framework and requires no hanging frames or equipments.
*It can expand from the base in all directions and adapt to different operating conditions.&lt;ref name ='May'/&gt;
*The thermal expansion is from top to bottom and with the usage of grate firing the grate firing the thermal expansion difference is minimised there by manifesting the sealing between grate and the boiler.
*The shorter path of water supply to the riser tubes leads to faster and more reliable operation on different loads and a quick start up.&lt;ref name='Thome-Kozmiensky' /&gt;
* It can be coupled with [[Concentrated solar power]] plant (CSP) as well in order to have increased efficiency ( above 33%) where the main fuels are [[biomass]], [[lLandfill gas]] and [[fuel wood|wood]].&lt;ref name="Peterseim"&gt;Peterseim J.H.,White, S., Tadros, A., Vanz, E. (2012). Pre-feasibility study for a multi-fuel
/ concentrated solar power hybrid plant at Swanbank, QLD. ''Prepared for Thiess Services
Pty Ltd by the Institute for Sustainable Futures, University of Technology, Sydney,
Australia.''21-25.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Construction and arrangement of heating surfaces is flexible as water can be supplied directly from the drum which is placed quite far away from heating surfaces.&lt;ref name='Thome-Kozmiensky' /&gt;
*Low risk of [[Foaming]] . As the water and the steam-water mixture which is fed into the drum maintains the same and constant level all the time leaving the space above water level in drum ''( please refer to the schemactic diagram pic)''.&lt;ref name='Thome-Kozmiensky' /&gt;
*Quick load variations and reliable operation in variable loads and at any significant change in pressure as the water level in the drum is stable and remains inaffected from turbulence.
*Less steel is needed as there is no lower boiler drum and moreover the absence of lower drum eliminated unwanted thermal stresses.

== Disadvantages ==
* The designing and construction is a result of detailed engineering and hence makes it expensive.

== Fuels ==
The various fuels which can be used or are commonly used in the USA, Europe and Pacific Countries are [[Bagasse]], [[Biomass]], [[Lignite]], [[Coal]], [[Scaly Bark]], [[Fuel gas]], [[Industrial waste]], khuff gas, MFO(marine fuel oil), [[Organic matter]], [[Oil]], [[Litter]], [[Rice hulls]], [[Rubberwood]], [[Sludge]], [[Wood]], [[Woodchips]].&lt;ref name = ' Noot'/&gt;

The '''Earth System Governance Project'''&lt;ref name="Biermann2009"&gt;[http://earthsystemgovernance.org/sites/default/files/publications/files/Earth-System-Governance_Science-Plan.pdf] Biermann, Frank, Michele M. Betsill, Joyeeta Gupta, Norichika Kanie, Louis Lebel, [[Diana Liverman]], Heike Schroeder, and Bernd Siebenhüner, with contributions from Ken Conca, Leila da Costa Ferreira, Bharat Desai, Simon Tay, and Ruben Zondervan. 2009. ''Earth System Governance: People, Places and the Planet. Science and Implementation Plan of the Earth System Governance Project''. Earth System Governance Report 1, IHDP Report 20. Bonn, IHDP: The Earth System Governance Project.&lt;/ref&gt; is a long-term, interdisciplinary social science research programme originally developed under the auspices of the [[International Human Dimensions Programme|International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change]].&lt;ref name="IHDP"&gt;[http://www.ihdp.unu.edu/publications/?id=325] IHDP Annual Report 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It started in January 2009.

The Earth System Governance Project currently consists of a network of ca. 300 active and about 2,300 indirectly involved scholars from all continents. The project has evolved into the largest social science research network in the area of governance and global environmental change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=9446496&amp;jid=JPS&amp;volumeId=-1&amp;issueId=-1&amp;aid=9446492] John Dryzek. 2014. Institutions for the Anthropocene: Governance in a Changing Earth System. ''British Journal of Political Science''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Earth System Governance Project Office is hosted at Lund University, Sweden.

== Aims ==
The Earth System Governance Project aims to contribute to science on the large, complex challenges of governance in an era of rapid and large-scale environmental change. The project seeks to create a better understanding of the role of institutions, organizations and governance mechanisms by which humans regulate their relationship with the natural environment.&lt;ref name="Biermann2009"/&gt; The Earth System Governance Project aims to integrate governance research at all levels. The project aims to examine problems of the ‘global commons’, but also local problems from [[air pollution]] to the preservation of waters, [[waste treatment]] or [[desertification]] and [[soil degradation]]. However, due to natural interdependencies local environmental pollution can be transformed into changes of the global system that affect other localities. Therefore, the Earth System Governance Project looks at institutions and governance processes both local and globally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.futureearth.org/blog/2013-jul-15/what-earth-system-governance] What is Earth System Governance?&lt;/ref&gt;

The Earth System Governance Project is a scientific effort, but also aims to assist policy responses to the pressing problems of earth system transformation &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebrokeronline.eu/Articles/Managing-global-change/Earth-System-Governance-Project/] The Broker Online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.cri.cn/6966/2011/05/19/1461s638279.htm] Nobel Laureates Hand in Recommendations to UN Panel on Global Sustainability&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conceptual framework ==
{{Main|Earth system governance}}
The Earth System Governance Project organizes its research according to a conceptual framework guided by five analytical problems. These are the problems of the overall ''architecture'' of earth system governance, of ''agency'' beyond the state and of the state, of the ''adaptiveness'' of governance mechanisms and processes, of their ''accountability'' and legitimacy and of modes of ''allocation and access'' in earth system governance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agci.vu.nl/en/Images/Biermann%20et%20al%20%202010%20INEA%20ESG%20Research%20Framework_tcm143-191335.pdf] Frank Biermann, Michele M. Betsill, Joyeeta Gupta, Norichika Kanie, Louis Lebel, Diana Liverman, Heike Schroeder, Bernd Siebenhüner and Ruben Zondervan. 2010. Earth system governance: a research framework. ''International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law, and Economics''. Vol 10. Nr 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''concept of Earth System Governance''' is defined as: 
&lt;blockquote&gt; ''... the interrelated and increasingly integrated system of formal and informal rules, rule-making systems, and actor-networks at all levels of human society (from local to global) that are set up to steer societies towards preventing, mitigating, and adapting to global and local environmental change and, in particular, earth system transformation, within the normative context of sustainable development''.&lt;ref name="Biermann2009"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Origin and history ==
In 2001, the four then active global change research programmes [[Diversitas|(DIVERSITAS]], [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]], [[World Climate Research Programme]], and [[International Human Dimensions Programme|International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change]]) agreed to intensify co-operation through setting up an overarching [[Earth System Science Partnership]]. The research communities represented in this Partnership contend in the 2001 Amsterdam Declaration on Global Change&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.essp.org/index.php?id=41] The Amsterdam Declaration on Global Change&lt;/ref&gt; that the earth system now operates ‘well outside the normal state exhibited over the past 500,000 years’ and that ‘human activity is generating change that extends well beyond natural variability—in some cases, alarmingly so— and at rates that continue to accelerate.’ To cope with this challenge, the four global change research programmes have called ‘urgently’ for strategies for Earth System management’.&lt;ref name="Biermann2009"/&gt;

In March 2007, in response to the 2001 Amsterdam Declaration, the Scientific Committee of the International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change (IHDP), the overarching social science programme in the field, mandated the drafting of the Science Plan of the Earth System Governance Project by a newly appointed Scientific Planning Committee. The Earth System Governance Project builds on the results of an earlier long-term research programme, the IHDP core project Institutional Dimensions of Global Environmental Change (IDGEC).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Dsj1rkoH3scC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;lpg=PA235&amp;dq=HDP+core+project+Institutional+Dimensions+of+Global+Environmental+Change+earth+system+governance+project&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NXxIhAHHT2&amp;sig=uHwEdIOQzkkkMQdI7e-kmI0b4Mw&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zr-TVdXiLYq5UYWNrBA&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=HDP%20core%20project%20Institutional%20Dimensions%20of%20Global%20Environmental%20Change%20earth%20system%20governance%20project&amp;f=false] Peijun Shi, Carlo Jaeger, Qian Ye (editors). 2012. ''Integrated Risk Governance: Science Plan and Case Studies of Large-scale Disasters''. Heidelberg: Springer Science &amp; Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthsystemgovernance.org/publication/young-oran--institutions-and-environmental-change] Young, Oran., Heike Schroeder and Leslie A. King (editors). 2008. ''Institutions and Environmental Change: Principal Findings, Applications, and Research Frontiers''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the Earth System Governance Project was officially launched.  

In 2009, the Science and Implementation Plan of the Earth System Governance Project was published.&lt;ref name="Biermann2009"/&gt; In the science and implementation plan, the conceptual problems, cross-cutting themes, flagship projects, and its policy relevance are outlined in detail. The Science Plan was written by an international, interdisciplinary Scientific Planning Committee chaired by Prof. Frank Biermann, which drew on a consultative process that started in 2004. Several working drafts of this Science Plan have been presented and discussed at a series of international events and conferences, and numerous scholars in the field, as well as practitioners, have offered suggestions, advice, and critique.&lt;ref name="IHDP"/&gt;

Since then, the project has evolved into a broader research alliance that builds on an international network of research centers, lead faculty and research fellows. After the termination of the IHDP in 2014, the activities of the Earth System Governance research alliance are supported by an international steering group of representatives of the main Earth System Governance Research Centres and the global group of lead faculty and research fellows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthsystemgovernance.org/people/lead-faculty Earth System Governance Project: Lead Faculty. Website accessed 1 July 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global research network ==
For its activities and implementation, the Earth System Governance Project relies on a global network of experts from different academic and cultural backgrounds. The research network consists of different groups of scientific experts. The Earth System Governance Project operates under the direction of a ''Scientific Steering Group'' chaired by Frank Biermann. The role of the Scientific Steering Committee is to guide the implementation of the Earth System Governance Science Plan. The ''Lead Faculty'' of the Earth System Governance Project is a group of individual scientists who take over (shared) responsibility for the development of research on particular analytical problems. ''Earth System Governance Fellows'' are scientists who link their own research projects with the broader themes and questions raised by the Earth System Governance Science and Implementation Plan.

An important element in the project organisation is the global alliance of research centres that brings together the [[VU University Amsterdam]]; the [[Australian National University]]; [[Chiang Mai University]]; [[Colorado State University]]; [[Lund University]]; [[University of East Anglia]]; [[University of Oldenburg]]; the [[Stockholm Resilience Centre]]; the [[University of Toronto]]; the [[Tokyo Institute of Technology]] and [[Yale University]]. In addition, strong networks on earth system governance research exist in China, Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, and Russia.

==  Education programmes ==
Earth system governance as a research object is quickly emerging, and as a consequence, the number of education programmes on bachelor, master and doctoral level related to earth system governance steadily increases. A number of institutes and universities currently collaborate in a Global Alliance of Earth System Governance Research Centres, including:&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthsystemgovernance.org/teaching Earth System Governance Project: Teaching. Website accessed 29 April 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Ecosystems, Resilience and Governance, University of Stockholm and Stockholm Resilience Centre, Sweden
* Environmental Studies and Sustainability Science, LUMES, International Master’s Programme, Lund University, Sweden
* Environment and Resource Management, VU University Amsterdam, The Netherlands
* Global Environmental Governance, Specialization track in MSc Political Science, VU University Amsterdam, The Netherlands
* Lund University Centre of Excellence for Integration of Social and Natural Dimensions of Sustainability, LUCID, Research School, Lund University, Sweden
* Sustainability Economics and Management, MSc Programme, University of Oldenburg, Germany
* Environmental Governance related Programmes, MA, MSc, and PhD Programmes, Colorado State University, United States of America
* Environment and Development Programmes, MSc, MRes, and MBA Programmes, University of East Anglia, United Kingdom

A substantial number of the workshops and other events of the project are capacity-building activities. The project also organizes, endorses and provides teaching to summer schools and capacity building events and programs. In addition, members of the Scientific Steering Group and staff of the International Project Office give guest lectures around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthsystemgovernance.org/teaching Earth System Governance Project: Teaching. Website accessed 2 July 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Task forces ==
The Earth System Governance Project organizes Task Forces, international networks of senior and early career scholars with a series of working groups focused on particular ideas or idea clusters. There are currently two active Task Forces:

* Task Force on Conceptual Foundations of Earth System Governance&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthsystemgovernance.net/conceptual-foundations/ website Task Force on Conceptual Foundations of Earth System Governance]&lt;/ref&gt;
This Task Force aims to explore key concepts with regard to Earth System Governance, such as planetary boundaries, green economy, resilience and the Anthropocene. It aims to critically examine and further refine these novel governance ideas. 

* Task Force on Methodology for Earth System Governance Research&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbl.nl/en/news/newsitems/2013/methodology-for-earth-system-governance-research PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency]&lt;/ref&gt;
This Task Force seeks aims to advance quantitative earth system governance research by promoting new international research collaborations, fostering interaction and dialogue among existing research projects, and developing architectures to promote the building and sharing of datasets.

== Policy influence ==
In 2011, the Earth System Governance Project launched an initiative on International Environmental Governance. This initiative aims to provide a forum for discussion of current and ongoing research on international environmental governance and the institutional framework for sustainable development, in the period leading up to the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] in Rio de Janeiro, also known as ‘Rio + 20’. In addition, the initiative aims to target decision-makers and to contribute not just to a better understanding but also to actual improvements in international environmental governance towards an institutional framework that enables sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessinitiative.org/blog/2011/07/guest-blog-post-earth-system-governance-initiative-international-environmental-governan The Access Initiative, Guest Blog Post: Earth System Governance Initiative on International Environmental Governance]&lt;/ref&gt;

== context ==
There is widespread support for the Earth System Governance Project in the scientific community, which is reflected in the size of the research network and in various publications by experts. &lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/admin/publication_files/resource-2585-2007.32.pdf.] Myanna Lahsen. 2007. Earth System Governance: Research in Aid of Global Environmental Sustainability. ''Global Change NewsLetter No. 70''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WIzFBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA210&amp;lpg=PA210&amp;dq=interesting+earth+system+governance+project&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=klDVNzhn8u&amp;sig=zIOwy73tahadMZ5OwQOooWa-QnI&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAjhGahUKEwjgpM7a4qrHAhUFPBoKHVuIC10#v=onepage&amp;q=interesting%20earth%20system%20governance%20project&amp;f=false] Michael Manton and Linda Anne Stevenson. 2013. Climate in Asia and the Pacific: Security, Society and Sustainability. ''Springer Science &amp; Business Media''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, criticisms of the Earth System Governance Project have also been made. 

In an internal report of the International Human Dimensions Programme it is stated that the steering group of the Earth System Governance Project is too much dominated by experts from OECD countries. Since then, the Earth System Governance Project has actively sought ways to involve experts from different regions of the world. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihdp.unu.edu/docs/Publications/ESG/ESG%20SSC-1_Minutes-clean.pdf] 1st Earth System Governance Scientific Steering Committee Meeting&lt;/ref&gt; 

The idea of earth system governance has also been criticized for being too top-down, for placing too much emphasis on global governance structures. According to Mike Hulme, earth system governance represents an attempt to ‘geopolitically engineer’ our way out of the climate crisis. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/30139401?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents] Mike Hulme. 2008. The Conquering of Climate: Discourses of Fear and Their Dissolution. ''The Geographical Journal''. Vol. 174, No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; He questions whether the climate is governable and argues that it is way too optimistic and even hubristic to attempt to control the global climate by universal governance regimes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mikehulme.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/2008-hulme-governing-and-adapting.pdf] Mike Hulme. 2008. Governing and adapting to climate.
A response to Ian Bailey’s Commentary on ‘Geographical work at the boundaries of climate change’. ''Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers''.&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation of the novel concept, however, has been rejected by other scholars as being too narrow and misleading &lt;ref&gt;Frank Biermann. 2014. ''Earth System Governance: World Politics in the Anthropocene''. MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oil production ==
{{main article|Petroleum industry in Mexico}}

President [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] expropriated foreign oil companies in the late 1930s. Since then, [[Pemex]], the national company produces oil in [[Mexico]]. Main fields are [[Chicontepec Field]], [[Cantarell Field]] and [[Ku-Maloob-Zaap]]. In 2008, oil production has declined 9,2% to 3,96 millions barils a day while [[natural gas]] production increased 14,2% to 6,92 cubic feet.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ri.pemex.com/index.cfm?action=statusfilecat&amp;categoryfileid=4406, Pemex fact sheet, visited on 12 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] Mexico was one of the top oil producers in 2009. Top oil producers in 2009 were (Mt): [[Energy in Russia|Russia]] 494 Mt (13%), [[Energy in Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]] 452 Mt (12%), [[Energy in the United States|US]] 320 Mt (8%), [[Energy in Iran|Iran]] 206 Mt (5%), [[Energy in China|China]] 194 Mt (5%), [[Energy in Canada|Canada]] 152 Mt (4%), Mexico 146 Mt (4%), [[Energy in Venezuela|Venezuela]] 126 Mt (3%), [[Energy in Kuwait|Kuwait]] 124 Mt (3%) and [[Energy in United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates]] 120 Mt (3%).&lt;ref name="öljy"&gt;[http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2010/key_stats_2010.pdf IEA Key energy statistics 2010] pages 11, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renewable energy==
{{Main article|Renewable energy in Mexico}}

=== Geothermal power ===
Mexico has the third greatest geothermal energy production with an installed capacity of 959.50 MW by December 2007. This represents 3.24% of the total electricity generated in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfe.gob.mx/es/LaEmpresa/generacionelectricidad/termoelectrica/geotermoelectrica/|title=Federal Commission of Electricity of Mexico/Geothermal-electric production 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.geothermics.2003.07.005 |title=Main aspects of geothermal energy in Mexico |journal=Geothermics |volume=32 |issue=4–6 |pages=389–396 |year=2003 |last1=Hiriart |first1=Gerardo |last2=Gutiérrez-Negrı́n |first2=Luis C.A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://iga.igg.cnr.it/geoworld/geoworld.php?sub=map&amp;country=mexico IGA electricity generation for Mexico] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508103054/http://iga.igg.cnr.it/geoworld/geoworld.php?sub=map&amp;country=mexico |date=2009-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico is also home to the largest geothermal power stations in the world, the [[Cerro Prieto Geothermal Power Station]].

Successive UK governments have outlined numerous commitments to reduce [[carbon dioxide]] emissions.  One such announcement was the [[low-carbon economy|Low Carbon]] Transition Plan launched by the [[Brown ministry]] in July 2009, which aimed to generate 30% electricity from [[renewable]] sources, and 40% from low carbon content fuels by 2020. Notably, the UK is [[Wind power in the United Kingdom|one of the best sites in Europe for wind energy]], and wind power production is its fastest growing supply.&lt;ref name="Roadmap"&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/48128/2167-uk-renewable-energy-roadmap.pdf UK Renewable Energy Roadmap Crown copyright, July 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/climate/adaptation/wind_power.shtml|title=BBC – Weather Centre – Climate Change – Wind Power|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableuk.com/en/news/renewableuk-news.cfm/electricity-needs-of-more-than-a-quarter-of-uk-homes-powered-by-wind-in-2014 RenewableUK News website article] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509191928/http://www.renewableuk.com/en/news/renewableuk-news.cfm/electricity-needs-of-more-than-a-quarter-of-uk-homes-powered-by-wind-in-2014 |date=9 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wind power contributed 15% of UK electricity generation in 2017.&lt;ref name="renewableuk.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableuk.com/news/393182/Record-year-for-wind-energy--Government-releases-official-figures.htm|title=Record year for wind energy – Government releases official figures|date=29 March 2018|access-date=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government commitments to reduce emissions are occurring against a backdrop of [[Economic crisis of 2008|economic crisis]] across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enerdata.net/enerdatauk/press-and-publication/publications/world-energy-statistics-supply-and-demand.php |title=World Energy Statistics &amp;#124; Energy Supply &amp; Demand |publisher=Enerdata |date= |accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[European financial crisis]], Europe's consumption of electricity shrank by 5%, with primary production also facing a noticeable decline. Britain's trade deficit was reduced by 8% due to substantial cuts in energy imports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Energy Research Estore |url=http://www.enerdata.net/enerdatauk/knowledge/eshop/energy-market-report/united_kingdom.php |title=United Kingdom Energy Report, Enerdata 2012 |publisher=Enerdata.net |date= |accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2007 and 2015, the UK's peak electrical demand fell from 61.5 GW to 52.7.GW.&lt;ref name=NSE /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/540933/Chapter_5_web.pdf |title= UK Electricity production and demand 2015 |page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Energy policy of the United Kingdom|UK government energy policy]] aims to play a key role in limiting [[greenhouse gas emissions]], whilst meeting energy demand. Shifting availabilities of resources and development of technologies also change the country's [[energy mix]] through changes in costs. In 2016, the United Kingdom was ranked 12th in the World on the [[Environmental Performance Index]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epi.yale.edu/dataexplorer/tableofmainresults |title=Data Explorer :: Table of Main Results &amp;#124; Environmental Performance Index |publisher=Epi.yale.edu |date= |accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which measures how well a country carries through [[environmental policy]].

=== Energy in Scotland ===
Scotland cut climate emissions by around 46% between 1990 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/14/scotland-beats-climate-emissions-reductions-target-six-years-early Scotland beats climate emissions reductions target six years early] Guardian 16 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland aims to have a carbon-free electricity sector based on renewable energy sources by 2032. Scotland also aims to repair 250,000 hectares of degraded [[peatland]]s, which store a total of 1.7 gigatonnes of CO2. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/19/scotland-sets-ambitious-goal-of-66-emissions-cut-within-15-years Scotland sets ambitious goal of 66% emissions cut within 15 years] Guardian 19 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fossil fuels==
{{main article|List of active coal fired power stations in the United Kingdom}}
[[File:Fossil fuel consumption in the United Kingdom.svg|thumb|Fossil fuel consumption in the UK.  Through the 90s, coal use declined while natural gas use increased.]]
During 2008, the total energy consumed in the United Kingdom was 234.4 million [[Oil equivalent|tonnes of oil equivalent]] (which is around 9.85 EJ = 9.85×10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;J).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.chaucer.ac.uk/ctsshared/geography/AS%20&amp;%20A%20Level/Year%2013%20Geography/Unit%203%20Contested%20Planet/Energy%20Security/Prereleased%20Booklet%20January%202013/GeographyofPlaces.docx UK Energy Consumption Figures 2008] Department of Energy and Climate Change&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns over [[peak oil]] have been raised by high-profile voices in the United Kingdom such as [[Sir David King]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/09/sir-david-king-dwindling-oil-supplies | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Top scientist says politicians have 'heads in the sand' over oil | first=David | last=Adam | date=9 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Industry Task-Force on Peak Oil and Energy Security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peakoiltaskforce.net/ |title=Latest from the Taskforce &amp;#124; The Peak Oil Group |publisher=Peakoiltaskforce.net |date=23 May 2011 |accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter's 2010 report states that "The next five years will see us face another crunch - the oil crunch. This time, we do have the chance to prepare. The challenge is to use that time well."

===Natural gas===
United Kingdom produced 60% of its consumed [[natural gas]] in 2010. In five years the United Kingdom moved from almost gas self-sufficient (see [[North Sea Gas]]) to 40% gas import in 2010. Gas was almost 40% of total primary energy supply (TPES) and electricity more than 45% in 2010. Underground storage was about 5% of annual demand and more than 10% of net imports. There is an alternative fuel obligation in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iea.org/papers/2011/gas_emergency_policy.pdf Gas emergency policy: Where do IEA countries stand?] IEA 25 May 2011, figures&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation]])

Gasfields include [[Amethyst gasfield]], [[Armada gasfield]], [[Easington Catchment Area]], [[East Knapton]], [[Everest gasfield]] and [[Rhum gasfield]].

A gas leak occurred in March 2012 at the [[Elgin-Franklin fields]], where about 200,000 cubic metres of gas was escaping every day. [[Total S.A.|Total]] missed out on about £83m of potential income.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/mar/11/elgin-north-sea-gas-platform-reopens Elgin North Sea gas platform resumes production almost year after leak] The Guardian 11 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

With the development of the [[National Grid (UK)|national grid]], the switch to using electricity, United Kingdom electricity consumption increased by around 150% between the [[World War II|post war]] [[nationalisation]] of the industry in 1948 and the mid-1960s. During the 1960s growth slowed as the market became [[Market saturation|saturated]]. The United Kingdom is planning to [[Decarbonisation Measures in Proposed UK Electricity Market Reform|reform its electricity market]]. It plans to introduce a capacity mechanism and contracts for difference to encourage the building of new generation.

===Fuel sources===
During the 1940s some 90% of the [[Electricity generation|generating capacity]] was fired by [[coal]], with [[Petroleum|oil]] providing most of the remainder.
[[File:Battersea Powerstation - Across Thames - London - 020504.jpg|thumb|right|The former [[Battersea Power Station]]]]

The United Kingdom started to develop a [[Nuclear power|nuclear generating]] capacity in the 1950s, with [[Calder Hall nuclear power station|Calder Hall]] being connected to the grid on 27 August 1956. Though the production of [[weapons-grade]] [[plutonium]] was the main reason behind this [[power station]], other civil stations followed, and 26% of the nation's electricity was generated from nuclear power at its peak in 1997.

Despite the flow of North Sea oil from the mid-1970s, oil fuelled generation remained relatively small and continued to decline.

Starting in 1993, and continuing through the 1990s, a combination of factors led to a so-called [[Dash for Gas]], during which the use of coal was scaled back in favour of gas-fuelled generation. This was sparked by the privatisation of the [[National Coal Board]], [[British Gas plc|British Gas]] and the [[Central Electricity Generating Board]]; the introduction of laws facilitating competition within the energy markets; and the availability of cheap gas from the [[North Sea]]. In 1990 just 1.09% of all gas consumed in the country was used in electricity generation; by 2004 the figure was 30.25%.&lt;ref name="DTI-july2005"&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100304141706/http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file10738.pdf UK Energy in Brief July 2005], DTI statistics&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2004, coal use in power stations had fallen to 50.5 million tonnes, representing 82.4% of all coal used in 2004 (a fall of 43.6% compared to 1980 levels), though up slightly from its low in 1999.&lt;ref name="DTI-july2005" /&gt; On several occasions in May 2016, Britain burned no coal for electricity for the first time since 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://next.ft.com/content/fc2c8d12-191d-11e6-bb7d-ee563a5a1cc1|title=Britain passes historic milestone with first days of coal-free power|work=Financial Times|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/05/10/britain-gets-no-power-from-coal-for-first-time-on-record/|title=Britain gets no power from coal for 'first time on record'|date=10 May 2016|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 April 2017, Britain went a full day without using coal power for the first time since the [[Industrial Revolution]], according to the [[National_Grid_(Great_Britain)|National Grid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First coal-free day in Britain since Industrial Revolution|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39675418|website=BBC News|date=22 April 2017|access-date=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-1990s new [[renewable energy]] sources began to contribute to the electricity generated, adding to a small [[hydroelectricity]] generating capacity.

In 2016, total electricity production stood at 357 [[TWh]] (down from a peak of 385 TWh in 2005), generated from the following sources:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/642716/Chapter_1.pdf|title=UK Energy Statistics, 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/energy-chapter-1-digest-of-united-kingdom-energy-statistics-dukes|title=Digest of UK Energy Statistics  - Department of Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy - GOV.UK|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=beis.gov.uk|accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Energy policy of the United Kingdom|UK Government energy policy]] had targeted a total contribution from renewables to achieve 10% by 2010, but it was not until 2012 that this figure was exceeded; renewable energy sources supplied 11.3% (41.3&amp;nbsp;TWh) of the electricity generated in the United Kingdom in 2012.&lt;ref name="DUKES Chapter 6"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/renewable-sources-of-energy-chapter-6-digest-of-united-kingdom-energy-statistics-dukes|title=Department of Energy and Climate Change: Annual tables: ‘Digest of UK energy statistics’ (DUKES) - Chapter 6: Renewable Sources of energy|accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UK 'energy gap'===
[[File:UK Electricity Capacity Margin.PNG|thumb|UK Electricity Capacity Margin&lt;ref name="DECC2013"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Department of Energy and Climate Change]] |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-of-energy-climate-change/series/energy-consumption-in-the-uk |title=Energy consumption in the UK|publisher=GOV.UK |date=25 July 2013 |accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the early years of the 2000s, concerns grew over the prospect of an 'energy gap' in United Kingdom generating capacity. This was forecast to arise because it was expected that a number of [[fossil fuel power plant|coal fired power stations]] would close due to being unable to meet the clean air requirements of the [[Large Combustion Plant Directive|European Large Combustion Plant Directive]] (directive 2001/80/EC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32001L0080 Directive 2001/80/EC ]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the United Kingdom's remaining [[Magnox]] nuclear stations were to have closed by 2015. The oldest [[Advanced gas-cooled reactor|AGR]] nuclear power station has had its life extended by ten years,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.british-energy.com/article.php?article=99 |title=10-year life extension at Dungeness B nuclear power station|date=15 September 2005|publisher=[[British Energy]]|accessdate=19 June 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060322013831/http://www.british-energy.com/article.php?article=99 |archivedate = 22 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was likely many of the others could be life-extended, reducing the potential gap suggested by the current accounting closure dates of between 2014 and 2023 for the AGR power stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2006/06/12/ccnuke12.xml|title=Nuclear stations may stay on line to bridge the gap|author=Stephen Seawright|date=13 June 2006|publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=30 August 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report from the industry in 2005 forecast that, without action to fill the gap, there would be a 20% shortfall in electricity generation capacity by 2015. Similar concerns were raised by a report published in 2000 by the [[Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution]] ''([https://web.archive.org/web/20070220162203/http://www.rcep.org.uk/newenergy.htm Energy - The Changing Climate]''). The [[Energy policy of the United Kingdom#2006 Energy Review|2006 Energy Review]] attracted considerable press coverage - in particular in relation to the prospect of constructing a new generation of nuclear power stations, in order to prevent the rise in carbon dioxide emissions that would arise if other conventional power stations were to be built.

Among the public, according to a November 2005 poll conducted by [[YouGov]] for [[Deloitte]], 35% of the population expect that by 2020 the majority of electricity generation will come from renewable energy (more than double the government's target, and far larger than the 5.5% generated as of 2008),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newenergyworldnetwork.com/renewable-energy-news/news_type/policy-by_technology-new-news/renewables-rise-to-55-per-cent-of-total-uk-output-according-to-department-of-energy-and-climate-change.html], page 23, ''[[Department of Energy and Climate Change]]'', published 2009-07-30, accessed 28 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 23% expect that the majority will come from nuclear power, and only 18% that the majority will come from fossil fuels. 92% thought the Government should do more to explore alternative power generation technologies to reduce carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deloitte.com/dtt/press_release/0,1014,sid=2834&amp;cid=102273,00.html Support for nuclear and renewable energy], [[Deloitte]], published 2005-12-02, retrieved 17 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, the industry regulator [[Ofgem]] warned that the UK's energy sector faces "unprecedented challenges" and that "spare electricity power production capacity could fall to 2% by 2015, increasing the risk of blackouts". Proposed solutions "could include negotiating with major power users for them to [[National Grid Reserve Service|reduce demand during peak times]] in return for payment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23081695 |title=BBC News - Ofgem warns danger of power shortages has increased |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=27 June 2013 |accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plugging the energy gap===
The first move to plug the United Kingdom's projected energy gap was the construction of the conventionally gas-fired [[Langage Power Station]] and [[Marchwood Power Station]] which became operational in 2010.

In 2007, proposals for the construction of two new coal-fired power stations were announced, in [[Tilbury]], Essex and in [[Kingsnorth (Medway)|Kingsnorth]], Kent. They were to be the first coal-fired stations to be built in the United Kingdom in 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6444373.stm Plans for two coal power stations announced], [[BBC]], published 2007-03-14, accessed 17 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; No power station at Tilbury was built and the plans for a new Kingsnorth coal powered station were later shelved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kingsnorth power station plans shelved by E.ON |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/oct/07/eon-cancels-kingsnorth-power-station |publisher=Guardian |date=7 October 2009 |accessdate=7 October 2009 | location=London | first=David | last=Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond these new plants, there were a number of options that might have been used to provide the new generating capacity, while minimising [[carbon emission]]s and producing less residues and contamination. [[Fossil fuel power plant]]s might provide a solution if there was a satisfactory and economical way of reducing their carbon emissions. [[Carbon capture and storage|Carbon capture]] might provide a way of doing this; however the technology is relatively untried and costs are relatively high. As of 2006 there were no power plants in operation with a full carbon capture and storage system, and as of 2018 the situation is little better.

===Energy gap disappears===
However, due to reducing demand in the [[late-2000s recession]] removing any medium term gap, and high gas prices, in 2011 and 2012 over 2 GW of older, less efficient, gas generation plant was mothballed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://interfaxenergy.com/natural-gas-news-analysis/european/uk-power-plants-mothballed-on-higher-gas-prices/ |title=UK power plants mothballed on higher gas prices |author=Andreas Walstad |work=National Gas Daily |publisher=Interfax |date=2 August 2011 |accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="argus-20120312"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.argusmediagroup.com/News/Article?id=789586 |title=Centrica idles gas-fired plant amid low spark spreads |publisher=Argus Media |date=12 March 2012 |accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 electricity demand dropped 4%, and about 6.5 GW of additional gas-fired capacity was added over 2011 and 2012. Early in 2012 the reserve margin stood at the high level of 32%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-23/centrica-may-mothball-more-gas-plants-as-capacity-trims-profits.html |title=Centrica May Mothball More Gas Plants as Capacity Trims Profits |author=Kari Lundgren |publisher=Bloomberg |date=23 February 2012 |accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important factor in reduced electrical demand in recent years has come from the [[phasing out of incandescent light bulbs]] and a switch to [[compact fluorescent]] and [[LED_lamp|LED lighting]]. Research by the University of Oxford&lt;ref name=NSE&gt;{{cite news|title=Peak Light Bulb|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129501.900-electricity-use-drops-as-uk-passes-peak-light-bulb.html|newspaper=New Scientist|date=4 January 2014|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; has shown that the average annual electrical consumption for lighting in a UK home fell from 720&amp;nbsp;kWh in 1997 to 508&amp;nbsp;kWh in 2012. Between 2007 and 2015, the UK's peak electrical demand fell from 61.5 GW to 52.7.GW.&lt;ref name=NSE /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/540933/Chapter_5_web.pdf |title= UK Electricity production and demand 2015 |page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional differences===
{{See also|Energy policy of Scotland}}

While in some ways limited by [[Reserved and excepted matters|which powers]] are [[Devolution|devolved]], the four countries of the United Kingdom have different energy mixes and ambitions. [[Scotland]] currently has a target of 80% of electricity from renewables by 2020, which was increased from an original ambition of 50% by 2020 after it exceeded its interim target of 31 per cent by 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-11395734 | work=BBC News | title=New target for Scottish renewable energy | date=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a quarter of the EU's estimated offshore wind potential,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/8447317.stm | work=BBC News | title=New wind farm contracts announced | date=8 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is at the forefront of testing various marine energy systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/green-living/marine-energy-projects-approved-for-scotland-1922370.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Marine energy projects approved for Scotland | first=Kunal | last=Dutta | date=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear===
{{Main article|Nuclear power in the United Kingdom}}
[[File:Heysham Power Station, from dockside.jpg|thumb|Heysham nuclear power stations]]

Britain's fleet of operational reactors consists of 14 advanced gas-cooled reactors on six discrete sites, along with two Magnox units at Wylfa, and one PWR unit at Sizewell B. Overall, the installed nuclear capacity in the United Kingdom is between 10 and 11 GW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marion Brünglinghaus, ENS, European Nuclear Society |url=http://www.euronuclear.org/info/encyclopedia/n/nuclear-power-plant-world-wide.htm |title=Nuclear power plants, world-wide |publisher=Euronuclear.org |date= |accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf84.html |title=Nuclear Power in the United Kingdom &amp;#124;UK Nuclear Energy |publisher=World-nuclear.org |date= |accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the UK experimented with Fast Breeder reactor technologies at Dounreay in Scotland, however the last fast breeder (with 250MWe of capacity) was shut down in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dounreay.com/decommissioning/prototype-fast-reactor |title=Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd - Prototype Fast Reactor |publisher=Dounreay.com |date=18 August 2008 |accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While nuclear power does not produce significant carbon dioxide in generation (though the [[construction]], [[mining]], [[Radioactive waste|waste handling and disposal]], and [[Nuclear decommissioning|decommissioning]] do generate some carbon emissions), it raises other environmental and security concerns. Despite this, it has enormous potential for generating electricity, when it is taken into consideration that uranium could last up to a hundred years.&lt;ref name="OECD Publishing"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even with changes to the [[planning permission|planning system]] to speed applications, there are doubts over whether the necessary timescale could be met, and over the financial viability of nuclear power with present oil and gas prices. With no nuclear plants having been constructed since [[Sizewell B nuclear power station|Sizewell B]] in 1995, there are also likely to be capacity issues within the native nuclear industry. The existing privatised nuclear supplier, [[British Energy]], had been in financial trouble in 2004.

In October 2010 the coalition [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]] gave the go-ahead for the construction of up to eight new nuclear power plants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/energy/8070810/Eight-new-nuclear-power-stations-despite-safety-and-clean-up-concerns.html Eight new nuclear power stations despite safety and clean-up concerns] Telegraph, published 2010-10-18, accessed 29 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Scottish Government]], with the backing of the [[Scottish Parliament]], has stated that no new nuclear power stations will be constructed in [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name=ScotsGov&gt;{{cite web|title=Answers to your questions on energy in Scotland|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Business-Industry/Energy/Facts/faqs|publisher=The Scottish Government|accessdate=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ScotsParl&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Report 17 January 2008|url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-08/sor0117-02.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620205946/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-08/sor0117-02.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 June 2009|publisher=The Scottish Parliament|accessdate=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012, [[E.ON UK]] and [[RWE npower]] announced they would be pulling out of developing new nuclear power plants, placing the future of nuclear power in the United Kingdom in doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsman.com/the-scotsman/scotland/nuclear-disaster-casts-shadow-over-future-of-uk-s-energy-plans-1-2205614 |title=Nuclear disaster casts shadow over future of UK’s energy plans |author=David Maddox |date=30 March 2012 |work=The Scotsman }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was an 11% increase in the use of nuclear power in 2011, which helped to bring greenhouse gas emissions down 7% on the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/29/uk-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2011 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Adam | last=Vaughan | title=UK greenhouse gas emissions down 7% in 2011 | date=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renewable energy===
{{main article|Renewable energy in the United Kingdom}}
In 2007, the United Kingdom Government agreed to an overall European Union target of generating 20% of the European Union's energy supply from renewable sources by 2020. Each European Union member state was given its own allocated target; for the United Kingdom it is 15%. This was formalised in January 2009 with the passage of the EU [[Renewables Directive]]. As renewable heat and fuel production in the United Kingdom are at extremely low bases, [[RenewableUK]] estimates that this will require 35–40% of the United Kingdom's electricity to be generated from renewable sources by that date,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McKenna |first=John |url=http://www.nce.co.uk/wind-power-chancellor-urged-to-use-budget-to-aid-ailing-developers/5200267.article |title=New Civil Engineer – Wind power: Chancellor urged to use budget to aid ailing developers |publisher=Nce.co.uk |date=8 April 2009 |accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be met largely by 33–35 GW of installed wind capacity.

The total of all renewable electricity sources provided for 14.9% of the electricity generated in the United Kingdom in 2013,&lt;ref name=DUKES&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/renewable-sources-of-energy-chapter-6-digest-of-united-kingdom-energy-statistics-dukes|title=Department of Energy and Climate Change: Annual tables: ‘Digest of UK energy statistics’ (DUKES) - Chapter 6: Renewable Sources of energy|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; reaching 53.7 TWh of electricity generated.

In June 2017 renewables plus nuclear generated more UK power than gas and coal together for the first time.  In 2017 new offshore wind power became cheaper than new nuclear power for the first time.&lt;ref name=bbc-20171228&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42495883 |title=UK enjoyed 'greenest year for electricity ever' in 2017 |work=BBC News |date=28 December 2017 |accessdate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wind power====
{{Main article|Wind power in the United Kingdom}}
{{Further |Wind power in the European Union}}

[[File:Pretty flamingos - geograph.org.uk - 578705.jpg|thumb|upright|Burbo Bank Offshore Wind Farm]]
In December 2007, the United Kingdom Government announced plans for a massive expansion of wind energy production, by conducting a Strategic Environmental Assessment of up to 25 GW worth of wind farm offshore sites in preparation for a new round of development. These proposed sites were in addition to the 8 GW worth of sites already awarded in the 2 earlier rounds of site allocations, Round 1 in 2001 and Round 2 in 2003. Taken together it was estimated that this would result in the construction of over 7,000 offshore wind turbines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?xml=/earth/2008/06/25/eawindfarms125.xml | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | first=Janet | last=Daley | title=Earth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wind power delivers a growing fraction of the energy in the United Kingdom and at the beginning of November 2018, wind power in the United Kingdom consisted of nearly 10,000 wind turbines with a total installed capacity of just over 20 [[gigawatts]]: 12,254 [[megawatts]] of onshore capacity and 7,897 megawatts of offshore capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Association |first1=RenewableUK |title=Wind Energy Statistics - RenewableUK |url=https://www.renewableuk.com/page/UKWEDhome |website=www.renewableuk.com |accessdate=31 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Solar====

At the end of 2011, there were 230,000 solar power projects in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref name=uk12&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/02/09/uk-solar-tariff-idUKTRE8180XS20120209 |title=UK wants sustained cuts to solar panel tariffs |author=Yeganeh Torbati |date=9 February 2012 |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a total installed generating capacity of 750 [[megawatts]] (MW).&lt;ref name=epia2012&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epia.org/index.php?id=18 |title=Market Report 2011 |author=European Photovoltaic Industry Association |year=2012 |work= |access-date=26 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702040515/http://www.epia.org/index.php?id=18 |archive-date=2 July 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By February 2012 the installed capacity had reached 1,000 MW.&lt;ref name="Jonathan Gifford"&gt;{{cite web |url= |title=UK hits one GW of PV capacity |author=Jonathan Gifford  |date=23 February 2012  |work=PV Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solar power]] use has increased very rapidly in recent years, albeit from a small base, as a result of reductions in the cost of [[photovoltaic]] (PV) panels, and the introduction of a [[Feed-in tariff]] (FIT) subsidy in April 2010.&lt;ref name=uk12/&gt; In 2012, the government said that 4 million homes across the UK will be powered by the sun within eight years,&lt;ref name="Fiona Harvey"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/09/solar-power-ambition-uk |title=Greg Barker: 4m homes will be solar-powered by 2020 |author=Fiona Harvey |date=9 February 2012 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; representing 22,000 MW of installed solar power capacity by 2020.&lt;ref name=uk12/&gt;

====Biofuels====
{{main article|Biofuel in the United Kingdom}}
Gas from [[sewage]] and [[landfill]] ([[biogas]]) has already been exploited in some areas. In 2004 it provided 129.3 GW·h (up 690% from 1990 levels), and was the UK's leading renewable energy source, representing 39.4% of all renewable energy produced (including hydro).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file10738.pdf DTI figures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209070902/http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file10738.pdf |date=9 December 2006 }} &lt;!--converted from thosand toe--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The UK has committed to a target of 10.3% of renewable energy in transport to comply with the [http://bioenergywiki.net/Renewable_Energy_Directive Renewable Energy Directive] of the European Union but has [http://bioenergywiki.net/Policy_implementation_in_the_United_Kingdom not yet implemented legislation] to meet this target.

Other [[biofuel]]s can provide a close-to-carbon-neutral energy source, if locally grown. In [[South America]] and [[Asia]], the production of biofuels for export has in some cases resulted in significant ecological damage, including the clearing of [[rainforest]]. In 2004 biofuels provided 105.9 GW·h, 38% of it [[wood]]. This represented an increase of 500% from 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file10738.pdf (DTI figures)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209070902/http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file10738.pdf |date=9 December 2006 }} &lt;!--converted from thosand toe--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Geothermal power====
{{main article|Geothermal power in the United Kingdom}}
Investigations into the exploitation of [[Geothermal power in the United Kingdom]], prompted by the [[1973 oil crisis]], were abandoned as fuel prices fell. Only one scheme is operational, in [[Southampton]]. In 2004 it was announced that a further scheme would be built to heat the UK's first geothermal energy [[model village]] near [[Eastgate, County Durham|Eastgate]], [[County Durham]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/4096231.stm 'Hot rocks' found at cement plant]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hydroelectric====
{{main article|Hydroelectricity in the United Kingdom}}
[[File:Dinorwig Power Station.jpg|thumb|The [[Dinorwig Power Station]] lower reservoir, a 1,800 MW pumped-storage hydroelectric scheme, in north Wales, and the largest hydroelectric power station in the UK]]
As of 2012, [[hydroelectric power]] stations in the United Kingdom accounted for 1.67 GW of installed electrical generating capacity, being 1.9% of the UK's total generating capacity and 14% of UK's [[renewable energy]] generating capacity. Annual electricity production from such schemes is approximately 5,700 GWh, being about 1.5% of the UK's total electricity production.&lt;ref name=DECC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/meeting_energy/hydro/use/use.aspx|title=Department of Energy and Climate Change: UK use of Hydroelectricity|accessdate=23 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127194425/http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/meeting_energy/hydro/use/use.aspx|archivedate=27 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-storage]] power stations in the UK. These power stations are net consumers of electrical energy however they contribute to balancing the grid, which can facilitate renewable generation elsewhere, for example by 'soaking up' surplus renewable output at off-peak times and release the energy when it is required.

==Cogeneration==
{{main article|District_heating#United_Kingdom}}
[[File:Pimlico accumulator tower 1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[District heating]] [[Accumulator (energy)|accumulator]] tower, [[Pimlico]]]]
[[Cogeneration|Combined heat and power plants]], where 'waste' hot water from generating is used for [[district heating]], are also a well tried technology in other parts of Europe. While it heats about 50% of all houses in [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Poland]], [[Sweden]] and [[Slovakia]], it currently only plays a small role in the United Kingdom. It has, however, been rising, with total generation standing at 27.9 TWh by 2008. This consisted of 1,439 predominantly gas-fired schemes with a total CHP electrical generating capacity of 5.47 GW, and contributing 7% of the UK's electricity supply.&lt;ref name="gov.uk"/&gt; Heat generation utilisation has fallen however from a peak of 65 TWh in 1991 to 49 TWh in 2012.

==Energy research==
Historically, public sector support for energy research and development in the United Kingdom has been provided by a variety of bodies with little co-ordination between them. Problems experienced have included poor continuity of funding, and the availability of funding for certain parts of the research—development—commercialisation process but not others. Levels of public funding have also been low by international standards, and funding by the private sector has also been limited.

Research in the area of energy is carried out by a number of public and private sector bodies:

The [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] funds an energy programme&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/ResearchFunding/Programmes/energy/default.htm], [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]]&lt;/ref&gt;  spanning energy and climate change research. It aims to "develop, embrace and exploit sustainable, low carbon and/or energy efficient technologies and systems" to enable the United Kingdom "to meet the Government’s energy and environmental targets by 2020". Its research includes renewable, conventional, nuclear and [[Fusion power|fusion]] electricity supply as well as energy efficiency, [[fuel poverty]] and other topics.

Since being established in 2004, the UK Energy Research Centre&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/content/view/11/86/], UK Energy Research Centre&lt;/ref&gt; carries out research into demand reduction, future sources of energy, infrastructure and supply, energy systems, sustainability and materials for advanced energy systems.

The [[United Kingdom Energy Technologies Institute|Energy Technologies Institute]], expected to begin operating in 2008, is to 'accelerate the development of secure, reliable and cost-effective low-carbon energy technologies towards commercial deployment'.

In relation to buildings, the Building Research Establishment&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bre.co.uk/keyservice.jsp?sid=360], [[Building Research Establishment]]&lt;/ref&gt; carries out some research into energy conservation.

There is currently international research being conducted into [[fusion power]]. The [[ITER]] reactor is currently being constructed at [[Cadarache]] in France. The United Kingdom contributes towards this project through membership of the [[European Union]]. Prior to this, an experimental fusion reactor (the [[Joint European Torus]]) had been built at [[Culham]] in Oxfordshire.

==Energy efficiency==
The United Kingdom government has instituted several policies intended to promote an increase in efficient energy use. These include the roll out of [[smart meters]], the [[Green Deal]], the [[CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme]], the Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carbontrust.com/esos |title=ESOS: Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme |publisher=The Carbon Trust |accessdate=9 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Climate Change Agreement]]s.

In tackling the energy trilemma, [[Efficient energy use|saving energy]] is the cheapest of all measures. The Guardian newspaper reported that in 2012 that by 2050, Germany projects a 25% drop in electricity demand: the UK projects a rise of up to 66%. [[Member of Parliament|MP]] and [[Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change]] [[Ed Davey]] pointed out in November 2012 that a modest 10% reduction in 2030 means five fewer power stations and £4bn cut from bills.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/nov/29/energy-bill-efficiency-davey Energy saving finally gets serious as alarm bells wake ministers] - Ed Davey has plugged a gaping hole in coalition energy policy by proposing serious if very belated - energy efficiency measures, but the overall policy remains a risky bet,  The Guardian 29 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK government has implemented measures aimed at cutting the UK's energy use by 11% (around 196TWh) by 2020. If achieved, this improvement would be sufficient to replace 22 UK power stations, while possibly providing a boost to the economy and living standards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/12/energy-efficiency-uk-close-power-stations Energy efficiency could replace 22 UK power stations] Guardian 12 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1970s ===
In 1972 NSA analyst [[Perry Fellwock]] (under the pseudonym "Winslow Peck") introduced the readers of ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' magazine to the NSA and to the [[UKUSA Agreement]].&lt;ref name="ramparts"&gt;{{cite news

The National Security Agency signed for the U.S. and became what's called First Party to the Treaty.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, a separate article in ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' magazine revealed the existence of the [[GCHQ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|quote=GCHQ's cover was first blown in 1976 by an article, The Eavesdroppers, published by the London magazine, Time Out.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1980s–1990s ===
In 1982 [[James Bamford]]'s book about the NSA, ''[[The Puzzle Palace]]'', was first published. Bamford's second book, ''[[Body of Secrets|Body of Secrets: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency]]'', was published two decades later.

In 1988 the '''[[ECHELON]]''' network was revealed by [[Margaret Newsham]], a [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] employee. Newsham told a member of the U.S. Congress that the telephone calls of [[Strom Thurmond]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] U.S. senator, were being collected by the NSA. Congressional investigators determined that "targeting of U.S. political figures would not occur by accident. but was designed into the system from the start."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

By the late 1990s '''ECHELON''' was reportedly capable of monitoring up to 90% of all internet traffic.&lt;ref name="bbcec"/&gt; According to the [[BBC]] in May 2001, however, "The US Government still refuses to admit that Echelon even exists."&lt;ref name="bbcec"&gt;{{cite news|title=Q&amp;A: What you need to know about Echelon|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sci/tech/1357513.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 December 2013|date=29 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2000s ===
In the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]], [[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]], along with colleagues [[J. Kirke Wiebe]] and [[Edward Loomis]] and in cooperation with House staffer [[Diane Roark]], asked the U.S. Defense Department to investigate the NSA for allegedly wasting "millions and millions of dollars" on [[Trailblazer Project|Trailblazer]], a system intended to analyze data carried on communications networks such as the Internet. Binney was also publicly critical of the NSA for spying on U.S. citizens after the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Shorrock |first= Tim |authorlink= Tim Shorrock |title= The Untold Story: Obama's Crackdown on Whistleblowers: The NSA Four reveal how a toxic mix of cronyism and fraud blinded the agency before 9/11 |journal= The Nation |date= April 15, 2013 |url= http://www.thenation.com/article/173521/obamas-crackdown-whistleblowers }}&lt;/ref&gt; Binney claimed that the NSA had failed to uncover the 9/11 plot despite its massive interception of data.&lt;ref name="Mayer"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Mayer |first= Jane |authorlink= Jane Mayer |title= The Secret Sharer: Is Thomas Drake an enemy of the state? |journal= The New Yorker |date= May 23, 2011 |url= http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/05/23/110523fa_fact_mayer?currentPage=all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, after the September 11 attacks, [[MI5]] started collecting bulk telephone communications data in the United Kingdom on which telephone numbers called each other and when, authorised the [[Home Secretary]] under a little understood general power under the [[Telecommunications Act 1984]] instead of the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000]] would have brought independent oversight and regulation. This was kept secret until announced by the then Home Secretary in 2015.&lt;ref name=bbc-20151105&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34731735 |title=How and why MI5 kept phone data spy programme secret |author=Gordon Corera |publisher=BBC |date=5 November 2015 |accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph-20151104&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/11976008/MI5-and-GCHQ-secretly-bulk-collecting-British-publics-phone-and-email-records-for-years-Theresa-May-reveals.html |title=MI5 and GCHQ secretly bulk collecting British public's phone and email records for years, Theresa May reveals |author=Tom Whitehead |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |date=4 November 2015 |accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thereg-20151109&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/11/09/hawktalk_wip/ |title=Here's the little-known legal loophole that permitted mass surveillance in the UK |newspaper=The Register |date=9 November 2015 |accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 16, 2005 ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a report under the headline "[[George W. Bush|Bush]] Lets U.S. Spy on Callers Without Courts", which was co-written by [[Eric Lichtblau]] and the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning journalist [[James Risen]]. According to ''The Times'', the article's date of publication was delayed for a year (past the next presidential election cycle) because of alleged national security concerns.&lt;ref name=nytimes2005&gt;{{cite news|last=James Risen and Eric Lichtblau|title=Bush Lets U.S. Spy on Callers Without Courts|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/politics/16program.html|work=The New York Times|date=December 16, 2005 |accessdate= April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russ Tice]] was later revealed as a major source.

In 2006 further details of the NSA's domestic surveillance of U.S. citizens was provided by ''[[USA Today]]''. The newspaper released a report on May 11, 2006 detailing the NSA's "massive database" of phone records collected from "tens of millions" of U.S. citizens. According to ''USA Today'', these phone records were provided by several telecom companies such as [[AT&amp;T]], [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]], and [[BellSouth]].&lt;ref name=USATODAY1&gt;{{cite news|last=Leslie Cauley|title=NSA has massive database of Americans' phone calls|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-05-10-nsa_x.htm|work=[USA Today|date=May 11, 2006 |accessdate= April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; AT&amp;T technician [[Mark Klein]] was later revealed as major source, specifically of rooms at network control centers on the internet backbone intercepting and recording all traffic passing through. In 2008 the security analyst [[Babak Pasdar]] revealed the existence of the so-called "Quantico circuit" that he and his team had set up in 2003. The circuit provided the U.S. federal government with a [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] into the network of an unnamed wireless provider, which was later independently identified as [[Verizon]].&lt;ref name="Poulsen"&gt;{{cite news|last=Poulsen|first=Kevin|title=Whistle-Blower: Feds Have a Backdoor Into Wireless Carrier—Congress Reacts|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/03/whistleblower-f/|work=Wired|accessdate=August 14, 2013|date=March 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 former [[Qwest]] CEO [[Joseph Nacchio]] alleged in court and provided supporting documentation that in February 2001 (nearly 7 months prior to the [[September 11 attacks]]) that the NSA proposed in a meeting to conduct blanket phone spying. He considered the spying to be illegal and refused to cooperate, and claims that the company was punished by being denied lucrative contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = D'Andrade |first = Hugh |title = Qwest CEO: NSA Punished Qwest for Refusing to Participate in Illegal Surveillance--Pre-9/11! |work = Deeplinks blog |publisher = Electronic Frontier Foundation |date = October 17, 2007 |url = https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2007/10/qwest-ceo-nsa-punished-qwest-refusing-participate-illegal-surveillance-pre-9-11 |accessdate = 2015-05-21 |archiveurl = |archivedate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2010–2013 ===
In 2011 details of the [[mass surveillance industry]] were released by [[WikiLeaks]]. According to [[Julian Assange]], "We are in a world now where not only is it theoretically possible to record nearly all telecommunications traffic out of a country, all telephone calls, but where there is an [[mass surveillance industry|international industry]] selling the devices now to do it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wikileaks disclosure shines light on Big Brother|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/wikileaks-disclosure-shines-light-on-big-brother/|publisher=CBS News|date=December 1, 2011 |accessdate= April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HMS ''Discovery''''' was the consort ship of [[James Cook]]'s third expedition to the [[Pacific Ocean]] in 1776–1780.  Like Cook's other ships, ''Discovery'' was a [[Whitby]]-built collier originally named ''Diligence'' when she was built in 1774. Purchased in 1775, the vessel was measured at 299 tons [[Builder's Old Measurement|burthen]].&lt;ref&gt;Colledge, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;   Originally a [[brig]], Cook had her changed to a [[full rigged ship]].  She was commanded by [[Charles Clerke]], who had previously served on Cook's first two expeditions, and had a complement of 70.  When Cook was killed in a skirmish with natives of [[Hawaii]], Clerke transferred to the expedition's [[flagship]] [[HMS Resolution (1771)|HMS ''Resolution'']] and [[John Gore (Royal Navy captain)|John Gore]] assumed command of ''Discovery''.  She returned to Britain under the command of Lieutenant [[James King (Royal Navy officer)|James King]], arriving back on 4 October 1780.

After returning to the [[Nore]] in 1780, ''Discovery'' was fitted out as a transport at [[Woolwich Dockyard]], serving as such between December 1780 and May 1781. She then became a dockyard craft at Woolwich, and was broken up at [[Chatham Dockyard]] in October 1797.

Hydraulic fracturing is the propagation of fractures in a [[Stratum|rock layer]] by pressurized fluid. Induced hydraulic fracturing or hydrofracking, commonly known as fracking, is a technique used to release petroleum, natural gas (including shale gas, tight gas and coal seam gas), or other substances for extraction.&lt;ref name="Charlez"/&gt; [[Radionuclides]] are associated with hydraulic fracturing in two main ways. Injection of man-made radioactive tracers, along with the other substances in hydraulic-fracturing fluid, is often used to determine the injection profile and location of fractures created by hydraulic fracturing.&lt;ref name="Reis iodine" /&gt; In addition, hydraulic fracturing releases naturally occurring heavy metals and radioactive materials from shale deposits, and these substances return to the surface with flowback, also referred to as wastewater.&lt;ref name="Bucks Co Water" /&gt;

==Naturally occurring radionuclides==

{{main|Naturally occurring radioactive material}}
There are naturally occurring radioactive material (e.g., [[radium]] and [[radon]]) in shale deposits.&lt;ref name="Urbina 26Feb2011" /&gt; Hydraulic fracturing can dislodge naturally occurring heavy metals and radioactive materials from shale deposits, and these substances return to the surface with flowback, also referred to as wastewater.&lt;ref name="Urbina 26Feb2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="discover 08012011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TimesMap" /&gt;  These naturally occurring radionuclides are of more concern than some man-made radionuclides used in fracture monitoring because of their long half lives. Radium (Ra) is a product of [[Uranium-238]] decay, and is the longest-lived isotope of radium with a [[half-life]] of 1601 years; next longest is [[Radium-228]], a product of [[Thorium-232]] breakdown, with a half-life of 5.75 years.&lt;ref name="nndc" /&gt; Radon (Rn) is a naturally occurring product of the decay of [[uranium]] or [[thorium]]. Its most stable [[isotope]], [[Radon-222]], has a [[half-life]] of 3.8 days. [[Strontium]] is also naturally occurring and may be dislodged by the process.&lt;ref name="discover 08012011" /&gt;

==Injected radionuclides==

Injection of radioactive tracers, along with the other substances in hydraulic-fracturing fluid, is often used to determine the injection profile and location of fractures created by hydraulic fracturing.&lt;ref name="Reis iodine" /&gt; Patents describe in detail how several tracers are typically used in the same well. Wells are hydraulically fractured in different stages.&lt;ref name="No5635712" /&gt; Tracers with different half-lives are used for each stage.&lt;ref name="No5635712" /&gt;&lt;ref name="US5441110"/&gt;  Their half-lives range from 40.2 hours ([[Lanthanum-140]]) to 28.90 years ([[Strontium-90]]).&lt;ref name="ep0340956a1"/&gt; Amounts per injection of radionuclide are listed in the US [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) guidelines.&lt;ref name="NRC"/&gt; The NRC guidelines also list a wide range or radioactive materials in solid, liquid and gaseous forms that are used as field flood or enhanced oil and gas recovery study applications tracers used in single and multiple wells.&lt;ref name="NRC"/&gt; According to the NRC, some of the most commonly used include [[Antimony-124]], [[Bromine-82]], [[Iodine-125]], [[Iodine-131]], [[Iridium-192]], and [[Scandium-46]].&lt;ref name="NRC"/&gt; A 2003 publication by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) provides a detailed description of tracer use, confirms the frequent use of most of the tracers above, and says that [[Manganese-56]], [[Sodium-24]], Technetium-m, Silver-m, [[Argon-41]], and [[Xenon-133]] are also used extensively because they are easily identified and measured.&lt;ref name="IAEA 2003" /&gt; Other potentially suitable tracers are named in various patents.&lt;ref name="No5635712" /&gt;&lt;ref name="US5441110" /&gt;&lt;ref name="US4415805" /&gt; In terms of quantities used, the NRC gives the following examples: Iodine-131, gas form, 100 millicuries total, not to exceed 20 millicuries per injection; Iodine-131, liquid form, 50 millicuries total, not to exceed 10 millicuries per injection; Iridium-192, "Labeled" frac sand, 200 millicuries total, not to exceed 15 millicuries per injection; Silver-110m, liquid form, 200 millicuries total, not to exceed 20 millicuries per injection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1556/v14/#_1_26]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other gamma-emitting tracer [[isotopes]] used are [[Antimony-121]], [[Antimony-122]], [[Antimony-123]], [[Antimony-125]], [[Antimony-126]], [[Antimony-127]], [[Carbon-14]], [[Chromium-51]], [[Cobalt-57]], [[Cobalt-58]], [[Cobalt-60]], [[Gold-198]], [[Iodine-127]], [[Iodine-128]], [[Iodine-129]], [[Iodine-130]], [[Iron-59]], [[Krypton-85]], [[Lanthanum-140]], [[Potassium-39]] (activated to [[Potassium-40]]), [[Potassium-41]] (activated to [[Potassium-42]]), [[Potassium-43]], [[Rubidium-86]], [[Scandium-45]], [[Scandium-47]], [[Scandium-48]], [[Silver-110]], [[Sodium-22]], [[Strontium-85]], [[Strontium-90]], [[Tritium]], [[Zinc-65]], and [[Zirconium-95]].&lt;ref name="No5635712" /&gt;&lt;ref name="US5441110" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ep0340956a1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NRC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="US4415805" /&gt;

==Environmental impact==
Concerns have been expressed that both naturally occurring radionuclides and [[radioactive tracer]]s may return to the surface with flowback and during blow outs.&lt;ref name="New Brunswick" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYSERDA" /&gt; Wastewater from the wells is released into rivers, injected into wells, and evaporated from ponds.&lt;ref name="Urbina 26Feb2011" /&gt; ''The Times'' reported that studies by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] and a confidential study by the drilling industry concluded that radioactivity in drilling waste cannot be fully diluted in rivers and other waterways.&lt;ref name="toxic" /&gt;  Recycling the wastewater has been proposed as a solution but has its limitations.&lt;ref name="Urbina 01Mar2011" /&gt;  ''[[The New York Times]]'' has reported on radium and gross alpha radiation levels in wastewater (also called flowback) from natural gas wells. It collected data from more than 200 natural gas wells in Pennsylvania. ''The New York Times'' has compiled a map of these wells and their wastewater contamination levels.&lt;ref name="Urbina 26Feb2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TimesMap" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

Political, governmental, and industry pressures have prevented the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) from studying risks associated with radionuclides&lt;ref name="EPA re study"/&gt; or other chemicals in hydraulic fracturing fluids in wastewater,&lt;ref name="Chesapeake" /&gt; source water, and drinking water.&lt;ref name="EPA re study" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT lobbying docs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TimesNaturalGasToxicGas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Urbina 03Mar2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Research Council study2" /&gt; The scope of the EPA Hydraulic Fracturing Draft Study Plan was narrowed to exclude them.&lt;ref name="EPA re study"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Urbina 03Mar2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120417160911/http://www.shalegas.energy.gov/resources/HFStudyPlanDraft_SAB_020711.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health impact==
As radon decays, it produces radioactive decay products. If the contaminated dust of these "radon daughters" are inhaled, they can lodge in the lungs and increase the risk of developing lung cancer.&lt;ref name="radon" /&gt; Iodine in food is absorbed by the body and preferentially concentrated in the [[thyroid]] where it is needed for the functioning of that gland.  When Iodine-131 is present in high levels in the environment from hydraulic fracturing flowback and blowouts, it can be absorbed through contaminated food and water, and will also accumulate in the thyroid.  As it decays, it may cause damage to the thyroid. The primary risk from exposure to high levels of iodine-131 is the chance occurrence of [[radiogenic]] [[thyroid cancer]] in later life.  Other risks include the possibility of non-cancerous growths and [[thyroiditis]].&lt;ref name="Rivkees" /&gt;&lt;ref name="radiation effects"/&gt; The level of radiation in hydraulic fracturing wastewater has been measured to be as high as 18,035 pCi/L,&lt;ref name="TimesMap" /&gt;  thousands of times the maximum allowed by the federal standard for drinking water,&lt;ref name="Urbina 26Feb2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TimesMap" /&gt; and there are concerns about radiation exposure during spills and blowouts.&lt;ref name="New Brunswick" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYSERDA" /&gt; Long term exposure to low level radiation is associated with stochastic&lt;ref name="EPA stochastic" /&gt; health effects; the greater the exposure, the more likely the health effects are to occur.&lt;ref name="EPA stochastic" /&gt; A group of doctors from the United States have called for a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing until health effects are more thoroughly studied.&lt;ref name="BW 19.01.2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomberg 11.01.2012" /&gt;

==Regulation==
The US [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) and approved state agencies regulate the use of injected radionuclides in hydraulic fracturing in the United States.&lt;ref name="NRC"/&gt; Federal and state regulators do not require sewage treatment plants that accept drilling waste to test for radioactivity. In Pennsylvania, where the hydraulic fracturing drilling boom began in 2008, most drinking-water intake plants downstream from those sewage treatment plants have not tested for radioactivity since before 2006.&lt;ref name="taint" /&gt; The EPA has asked the [[Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection]] to require community water systems in certain locations, and centralized wastewater treatment facilities to conduct testing for radionuclides.&lt;ref name="EPA letter to PADEP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Urbina 07Mar2011" /&gt; Safe drinking water standards have not yet been established to account for radioactivity levels of hydraulic fracturing waste water,&lt;ref name="Urbina 26Feb2011" /&gt; and although water suppliers are required to inform citizens of radon and other radionuclides levels in their water, this doesn't always happen.&lt;ref name="Carbon County" /&gt; Radioactive tracers are not yet listed on FracFocus,&lt;ref&gt;[http://fracfocus.org/ FracFocus]&lt;/ref&gt; a website indicating chemical composition of fracking fluid of individual wells, but federal and state nuclear regulatory agencies keep records of their use.&lt;ref name="NRC" /&gt;

'''Ignimbrite''' is a variety of hardened [[tuff]].&lt;ref name=LeMaitre2002/&gt; Ignimbrites are [[igneous rock]]s made up of crystal and rock fragments in a glass-shard [[Matrix (geology)|groundmass]], albeit the original [[Texture (geology)|texture]] of the groundmass might be obliterated due to high degrees of [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/weld welding]. The term ''ignimbrite'' is not recommended by the [[International Union of Geological Sciences|IUGS]] Subcommission on the Systematics of Igneous Rocks.&lt;ref name=LeMaitre2002&gt;{{cite book |editor-last= Le Maitre |editor-first= R. W. |date =2002 |title= Igneous Rocks: A Classification and Glossary of Terms |url= |location= New York, United States |publisher= Cambridge University Press |page= 92 |isbn= 978-0-511-06651-1 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ignimbrite is the deposit of a pyroclastic density current, or [[pyroclastic flow]], which is a hot suspension of particles and gases flowing rapidly from a [[volcano]] and driven by being denser than the surrounding atmosphere. New Zealand geologist [[Patrick Marshall]] (1869-1950) derived the term ''ignimbrite'' from "fiery rock dust cloud" (from the [[Latin]] ''igni-'' (fire) and ''imbri-'' (rain)). Ignimbrites form as the result of immense explosions of pyroclastic ash, [[lapilli]] and blocks flowing down the sides of volcanoes.

Ignimbrites are made of a very poorly sorted mixture of [[volcanic ash]] (or [[tuff]] when [[Lithification|lithified]]) and [[pumice]] lapilli, commonly with scattered lithic fragments. The ash is composed of glass shards and crystal fragments. Ignimbrites may be loose and unconsolidated, or lithified (solidified) rock called lapilli-tuff. Near the volcanic source, ignimbrites commonly contain thick accumulations of lithic blocks, and distally, many show meter-thick accumulations of rounded cobbles of pumice.

Ignimbrites may be white, grey, pink, beige, brown or black - depending on their composition and density. Many pale ignimbrites are [[dacite|dacitic]] or [[rhyolite|rhyolitic]]. Darker-coloured ignimbrites may be densely welded [[volcanic glass]] or, less commonly, [[mafic]] in composition.

==Deposition==
There are two main models that have been proposed to explain the deposition of ignimbrites from a pyroclastic density current, the ''en masse'' deposition and the progressive aggradation models.

===''En masse'' model===
The ''en masse'' model was proposed by volcanologist [[Robert Stephen John Sparks|Stephen Sparks]] in 1976. Sparks attributed the poor sorting in ignimbrites to [[Laminar flow|laminar]] flows of very high particle concentration. Pyroclastic flows were envisioned as being similar to debris flows, with a body undergoing laminar flow and then stopping ''en masse''. The flow would travel as a plug flow, with an essentially non-deforming mass travelling on a thin shear zone, and the ''en masse'' freezing occurs when the driving stress falls below a certain level. This would produce a massive unit with an inversely graded base.

There are several problems with the ''en masse'' model. Since ignimbrite is a deposit, its characteristics cannot completely represent the flow, and the deposit may only record the depositional process. Vertical chemical zonation in ignimbrites is interpreted as recording incremental changes in the deposition, and the zonation rarely correlates with flow unit boundaries and may occur within flow units. It has been posited that the chemical changes are recording progressive aggradation at the base of the flow from an eruption whose composition changes with time. For this to be so, the base of the flow cannot be turbulent. The instantaneous deposition of an entire body of material is not possible because displacement of the fluid is not possible instantaneously. Any displacement of the fluid would mobilize the upper part of the flow, and ''en masse'' deposition would not occur. Instantaneously cessation of the flow would cause local compression and extension, which would be evident in the form of tension cracks and small scale thrusting, which is not seen in most ignimbrites.&lt;ref name="branney2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Branney |first1=M. J. |last2= Kokelaar|first2= B. P. |date=2002|title= Pyroclastic Density Currents and the Sedimentation of Ignimbrites| publisher=The Geological Society |location=Bath|isbn=1-86239-097-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An adaptation of the ''en masse'' theory suggests that the ignimbrite records progressive aggradation from a sustained current and that the differences observed between ignimbrites and within an ignimbrite are the result of temporal changes to the nature of the flow that deposited it.&lt;ref name="branney2002"/&gt;

===Rheomorphic flow model===
[[Image:Rheo flow.JPG|thumb|Rheomorphic flow structures in a welded ignimbrite, Isle of Lipari, Italy]]
Rheomorphic structures are only observed in high grade ignimbrites. There are two types of rheomorphic flow; post-depositional re-mobilization, and late stage viscous flow. While there is currently debate in the field of the relative importance of either mechanism, there is agreement that both mechanisms have an effect. A vertical variation in orientation of the structures is compelling evidence against post-depositional re-mobilization being responsible for the majority of the structures, but more work needs to be carried out to discover if the majority of ignimbrites have these vertical variations in order to say which process is the most common.

A model based on observations at the Wall Mountain Tuff at [[Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument]] in Colorado suggests that the rheomorphic structures such as [[Foliation (geology)|foliation]] and [[Pyroclastic rock|pyroclasts]] were formed during laminar viscous flow as the density current comes to a halt. A change from particulate flow to a viscous fluid could cause the rapid ''en masse'' cooling in the last few meters.&lt;ref name="schmincke"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmincke|first1=H.-U.|last2=Swanson|first2=D. A.|title=Laminar Viscous Flowage Structures in Ash-Flow Tuffs from Gran Canaria, Canary Islands|journal=The Journal of Geology|date=1967|volume=75|issue=6|pages=641–644|doi=10.1086/627292|bibcode=1967JG.....75..641S}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also theorized that transformation occurs at a boundary layer at the base of the flow and that all the materials pass through this layer during deposition.&lt;ref name="chapin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chapin|first1= C. E.|last2= Lowell |first2=G.R. |date=1979|title= Primary and secondary flow structures in ash-flow tuffs of the Gribbles Run paleovalley, central Colorado|journal= GSA Special Papers|volume=180|pages= 137–154|doi=10.1130/SPE180-p137|series= Geological Society of America Special Papers|isbn= 0-8137-2180-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another model proposed is that the density current became stationary before the rheomorphic structures form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ragan|first1=D. M.|last2=Sheridan|first2=M. F.|title=Compaction of the Bishop Tuff, California|journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin|date=1972|volume=83|issue=1|pages=95–106|doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1972)83[95:COTBTC]2.0.CO;2|bibcode=1972GSAB...83...95R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structures such as pervasive foliation are a result of load compaction, and other structures are the result of remobilization by load and deposition on inclined topography. The tuff deposited at [[Wagontire Mountain]] in Oregon and [[Bishop Tuff]] in California show evidence of late stage viscous flow. These tuffs have a similar chemistry and so must have undergone the same compaction process to have the same foliation.

The Green Tuff in [[Pantelleria]] contains rheomorphic structures which are held to be a result of post-depositional re-mobilization because at that time the Green Tuff was believed to be a [[Volcanic ash|fall deposit]] which has no lateral transport.&lt;ref name="wolff"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wolff|first1=J. A.|last2=Wright|first2=J. V.|title=Rheomorphism of welded tuffs|journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research|date=1981|volume=10|issue=1–3|pages=13–34|doi=10.1016/0377-0273(81)90052-4|bibcode=1981JVGR...10...13W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities between the structures in the Green Tuff and ignimbrites on [[Gran Canaria]] suggest post-depositional re-mobilization.  This interpretation of the deposition of the Green Tuff has been disputed, suggesting that it is an ignimbrite, and structures such as imbricate [[fiamme]], observed in the Green Tuff, were the result of late stage primary viscous flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Branney|first1=M. J.|last2=Kokelaar|first2=P.|title=A reappraisal of ignimbrite emplacement: progressive aggradation and changes from particulate to non-particulate flow during emplacement of high-grade ignimbrite|journal=Bulletin of Volcanology|date=1992|volume=54|issue=6|pages=504–520|doi=10.1007/BF00301396|bibcode=1992BVol...54..504B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar structures observed on Gran Canaria had been interpreted as syn-depositional flow.&lt;ref name="wolff" /&gt;

Sheathfolds and other rheomorphic structures may be the result of a single stage of shear. Shear possibly occurred as the density current passed over the forming deposit. Vertical variations in the orientations of sheathfolds are evidence that rheomorphism and welding can occur syn-depositionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Branney|first1=M. J.|last2=Barry|first2=T. L.|last3=Godchaux|first3=M.|title=Sheathfolds in rheomorphic ignimbrites|journal=Bulletin of Volcanology|date=2004|volume=66|issue=6|pages=485–491|doi=10.1007/s00445-003-0332-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is disputed that the shear between the density current and the forming deposit is significant enough to cause all of the rheomorphic structures observed in ignimbrites, although the shear could be responsible for some of the structures such as imbricate fiamme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kobberger|first1=G.|last2=Schmincke|first2=H.-U.|title=Deposition of rheomorphic ignimbrite D (Mogán Formation), Gran Canaria, Canary Islands, Spain|journal=Bulletin of Volcanology|date=1999|volume=60|issue=6|pages=465–485|doi=10.1007/s004450050246|bibcode=1999BVol...60..465K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Load compaction on an inclined slope is likely responsible for the majority of the rheomorphic structures.

== Petrology ==
[[Image:Ignimbrite.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A block of ignimbrite]]
[[Image:Tuff welded.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Light microscope image of a welded ignimbrite, composed of eutaxitic lapilli-tuff as seen in thin section (Long dimension is several mm). The glass shards (mostly brown) sometimes become welded together when the deposit is still hot, and can be deformed by flow and compaction about crystal fragments (clear).]]
Ignimbrite is primarily composed of a matrix of volcanic ash ([[tephra]]) which is composed of shards and fragments of volcanic glass, pumice fragments, and crystals. The crystal fragments are commonly blown apart by the explosive eruption. Most are [[phenocryst]]s that grew in the magma, but some may be exotic crystals such as [[xenocryst]]s, derived from other magmas, igneous rocks, or from country rock.

The ash matrix typically contains varying amounts of pea- to cobble-sized rock fragments called lithic inclusions. They are mostly bits of older solidified volcanic debris entrained from conduit walls or from the land surface. More rarely, clasts are cognate material from the magma chamber.

If sufficiently hot when deposited, the particles in an ignimbrite may weld together, and the deposit is transformed into a [[Ignimbrite#Welding|'welded ignimbrite']], made of ''eutaxitic lapilli-tuff''.  When this happens, the pumice lapilli commonly flatten, and these appear on rock surfaces as dark lens shapes, known as [[fiamme]].  Intensely welded ignimbrite may have glassy zones near the base and top, called lower and upper 'vitrophyres', but central parts are microcrystalline ('lithoidal').

== Mineralogy ==
The mineralogy of an ignimbrite is controlled primarily by the chemistry of the source magma.

The typical range of phenocrysts in ignimbrites are biotite, quartz, sanidine or other [[feldspar|alkali feldspar]], occasionally [[hornblende]], rarely [[pyroxene]] and in the case of [[phonolite]] tuffs, the [[feldspathoid]] minerals such as [[nepheline]] and [[leucite]].

Commonly in most felsic ignimbrites the quartz polymorphs [[cristobalite]] and [[tridymite]] are usually found within the welded [[tuff]]s and [[breccia]]s. In the majority of cases, it appears that these high-temperature polymorphs of [[quartz]] occurred post-eruption as part of an autogenic post-eruptive alteration in some metastable form. Thus although tridymite and cristobalite are common minerals in ignimbrites, they may not be primary magmatic minerals.

==Geochemistry==
Most ignimbrites are silicic, with generally over 65% SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The chemistry of the ignimbrites, like all felsic rocks, and the resultant mineralogy of phenocryst populations within them, is related mostly to the varying contents of sodium, potassium, calcium, the lesser amounts of iron and magnesium.

Some rare ignimbrites are andesitic, and may even be formed from volatile saturated [[basalt]], where the ignimbrite would have the geochemistry of a normal basalt.

== Alteration ==
Large hot ignimbrites can create some form of [[hydrothermal]] activity as they tend to blanket the wet [[soil]] and bury watercourses and rivers. The water from such substrates will exit the ignimbrite blanket in [[fumarole]]s, [[geyser]]s and the like, a process which may take several years, for example after the [[Novarupta]] tuff eruption. In the process of boiling off this water, the ignimbrite layer may become [[Metasomatism|metasomatised]] (altered). This tends to form chimneys and pockets of [[kaolin]]-altered rock.

===Welding===
Welding is a common form of ignimbrite alteration. There are two types of welding, primary and secondary. If the density current is sufficiently hot the particles will [[wikt:agglutinate|agglutinate]] and weld at the surface of sedimentation to form a viscous fluid; this is primary welding. If during transport and deposition the temperature is low, then the particles will not agglutinate and weld, although welding may occur later if compaction or other factors reduce the minimum welding temperature to below the temperature of the glassy particles; this is secondary welding. This secondary welding is most common and suggests that the temperature of most pyroclastic density currents is below the softening point of the particles.&lt;ref name="chapin"/&gt;

The factor that determines whether an ignimbrite has primary welding, secondary welding or no welding is debated:
*Different chemical compositions will lower the [[viscosity]] and enable primary weld.&lt;ref name="schmincke" /&gt;
*There is not enough variation in the composition of primary and secondary welded ignimbrites for this to be a major factor.&lt;ref name="chapin" /&gt;
*Cooling during transport is negligible, so if the eruption temperature is high enough then primary welding will occur. Lateral variations in degree of welding are not a result of cooling during transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freundt|first1=A.|title=Formation of high-grade ignimbrites Part II. A pyroclastic suspension current model with implications also for low-grade ignimbrites|journal=Bulletin of Volcanology|date=1999|volume=60|issue=7|pages=545–567|doi=10.1007/s004450050251|bibcode=1999BVol...60..545F}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lithostatic load is responsible for the intensity of welding because the [[Tiribi]] ignimbrite is most densely welded where the thickness is greatest. The correlation is not perfect, and that other factors may have an influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pérez|first1=W.|last2=Alvarado|first2=G. E.|last3=Gans|first3=P. B.|title=The 322 ka Tiribí Tuff: stratigraphy, geochronology and mechanisms of deposition of the largest and most recent ignimbrite in the Valle Central, Costa Rica|journal=Bulletin of Volcanology|date=2006|volume=69|issue=1|pages=25–40|doi=10.1007/s00445-006-0053-x|bibcode=2006BVol...69...25P}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*There are two lines of evidence for the relative unimportance of lithostatic load in determining the intensity of welding; lateral changes in the degree of welding irrespective of thickness and cases where the degree of welding correlates with the chemical zoning. Welding is determined by a combination of factors including compositional changes, volatile content, temperature, grain size population and lithic content.&lt;ref name="branney2002"/&gt;

== Morphology and occurrence ==
Ignimbrite originates from explosive eruptions caused by vigorous exsolution of magmatic gases.  The escaping gas accelerates the magma up the conduit, resulting in fragmentation to produce pumice and ash, which dispersed in gas will flow downslope or spread where the dispersal is denser than the atmosphere, as pyroclastic density current, sometimes known as a pyroclastic flow.

Ignimbrites form sheets that can cover as much as thousands of square kilometers. Some examples create thick valley-filling deposits, while others form a landscape-mantling veneer that locally thickens in valleys and other paleotopographic depressions.

Many igimbrites are loose unconsolidated deposits, but some exhibit welding, giving the ignimbrite the texture of a solid rock mass, hence the terms commonly used to describe these examples: welded [[tuff]] and welded ashflow.

Often, but not always, a [[caldera]] will form as a result of a large ignimbrite eruption because the [[magma]] chamber underneath will drain and thus can no longer support the weight of the rock above.

Ignimbrite deposits can be voluminous - examples with up to hundreds or even thousands of cubic kilometers are known from individual eruptions in the geological past.

== Distribution ==
Ignimbrites occur worldwide associated with many volcanic provinces having high-silica content [[magma]] and the resulting explosive eruptions.

Ignimbrite occurs very commonly around the lower [[Hunter Region]] of the [[Australia]]n state of [[New South Wales]]. The ignimbrite quarried in the Hunter region at locations such as Martins Creek, Brandy Hill, Seaham ([[Boral]]) and at abandoned quarry at Raymond Terrace is a volcanic sedimentation rock of [[Carboniferous]] age (280-345 million years). It had an extremely violent origin. This material built up to considerable depth and must have taken years to cool down completely. In the process the materials that made up this mixture fused together into a very tough rock of medium density.

Ignimbrite also occurs in the [[Coromandel, New Zealand|Coromandel]] region of [[New Zealand]], where the striking orange-brown ignimbrite cliffs form a distinctive feature of the landscape. The nearby [[Taupo Volcanic Zone]] is covered in extensive flat sheets of ignimbrite erupted from caldera volcanoes during the Pleistocene and Holocene. The exposed ignimbrite cliffs at [[Hinuera]] (Waikato) mark the edges of the ancient Waikato River course which flowed through the valley before the last major [[Taupo]] eruption 1,800 years ago (the [[Hatepe eruption]]). The west cliffs are quarried to get blocks of Hinuera Stone, the name given to welded ignimbrite used for building cladding. The stone is light grey with traces of green and is slightly porous.

Huge deposits of ignimbrite form large parts of the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] in western Mexico.  In the [[western United States]], massive ignimbrite deposits up to several hundred metres thick occur in the [[Basin and Range Province]], largely in [[Nevada]], western [[Utah]], southern [[Arizona]], and north-central and southern [[New Mexico]], and the [[Snake River Plain]]. The magmatism in the Basin and Range Province included a massive flare-up of ignimbrite which began about 40 million years ago and largely ended 25 million years ago: the magmatism followed the end of the [[Laramide orogeny]], when deformation and magmatism occurred far east of the plate boundary. Additional eruptions of ignimbrite continued in Nevada until roughly 14 million years ago. Individual eruptions were often enormous, sometimes up to thousands of cubic kilometres in volume, giving them a [[Volcanic Explosivity Index]] of 8, comparable to [[Yellowstone Caldera]] and [[Lake Toba]] eruptions.

Successions of ignimbrites make up most of the post-erosional rocks in [[Gran Canaria]] Island.

==Use==
[[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository|Yucca Mountain]] Repository, a U.S. Department of Energy terminal storage facility for spent nuclear reactor and other radioactive waste, is in a deposit of ignimbrite and tuff.

The layering of ignimbrites is used when the stone is worked, as it sometimes splits into convenient slabs, useful for flagstones and in garden edge landscaping.

In the Hunter region of New South Wales ignimbrite serves as an excellent aggregate or 'blue [[pavement (roads)|metal]]' for road surfacing and construction purposes.

'''Iridium 77''' is a communications Satellite which is part of a satellite constellation known as [[Iridium satellite constellation|Iridium]], named after the 77th [[chemical element]] of the [[periodic table]], ''[[iridium]]''. It was launched in 1998 and as of 2014, operational. It is owned and funded by [[Iridium Communications|Iridium]], a communications company.

==Network==
Iridium 77 is a part of a space-based communications system called Iridium. Conceived, designed, and built by [[Motorola]], the Iridium system provides wireless, [[mobile communication]]s through a network of 66 satellites in polar, low-Earth orbits. Inaugurated in November 1998, under the auspices of Iridium LLC, this complex space system allowed callers using hand-held mobile phones and pagers to communicate anywhere in the world—a first in the history of telephony.

==Overview==
===Launch===
It was launched by [[Delta II]] 7920 from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] on 8 September 1998 at 21:13:00 UTC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftOrbit.do?id=1998-051E |title=Iridium 77 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=16 August 2013 |website=nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; along  with four other satellites, all of which were Iridium satellites.

===Features===
Iridium 77 is 3-axis stabilized, with a hydrazine propulsion system. It has 2 solar panels with 1-axis articulation. The system employs L-Band using FDMA/TDMA to provide voice at 4.8 kbit/s and data at 2.4 kbit/s with 16&amp;nbsp;dB margin. The satellite has 48 spot beams for Earth coverage and uses Ka-Band for crosslinks and ground commanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1998-051E |title=Iridium 77 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=16 August 2013 |website=nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lehmann discontinuity''' is an abrupt increase of [[P-wave|''P''-wave]] and [[S-wave|''S''-wave]] velocities at the depth of 220±30&amp;nbsp;km, discovered by [[seismology|seismologist]] [[Inge Lehmann]].&lt;ref name=Lowrie&gt;The thickness is 220 km.

{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of geophysics |author=William Lowrie |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7vR2RJSIGVoC&amp;pg=PA158 |page=158 |isbn=0-521-46728-4 |date=1997 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}

&lt;/ref&gt;  It appears beneath [[continent]]s, but not usually beneath [[ocean]]s,&lt;ref name=Stixrude&gt;

{{cite journal |url=http://supercronopio.es.ucl.ac.uk/~crlb/RESEARCH/PAPERS/StixrudeCLB05a.pdf |quote=The first possible explanation is that the Lehmann is not a global feature...the Lehmann is more prevalent under continents and may be absent under all or most of the oceans. |title=Mineralogy and elasticity of the oceanic upper mantle: Origin of the low-velocity zone |author=Lars Stixrude and Carolina Lithgow-Bertolloni |journal=J.

&lt;/ref&gt; and does not readily appear in globally averaged studies. Several explanations have been proposed: a lower limit to the pliable [[asthenosphere]], a [[phase transition]],&lt;ref name= Condie&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and most plausibly, depth variation in the [[S-wave|shear wave]] [[anisotropy]].&lt;ref name=Savage&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5399">'''Earthquakes in Vanuatu''' are frequent and are sometimes accompanied by tsunami, though these events are not often destructive. The archipelago, which was formerly known as [[New Hebrides]], lies atop a complex and active plate boundary in the southwestern Pacific Ocean.

==Tectonic setting==
The primary tectonic feature of the {{convert|1200|km|abbr=on}} island chain is the [[New Hebrides Plate|New Hebrides Subduction Zone]], the [[Convergent boundary|convergent]] boundary of the [[Australian Plate|Australian]] and [[Pacific Plate]]s. Along the [[Wadati–Benioff zone]], earthquake activity has been observed as shallow, intermediate, and [[Deep-focus earthquake|deep-focus]] events at depths of up to {{convert|700|km|abbr=on}}. Volcanic activity is also present along this north-northwest trending and northeast-[[Strike and dip|dipping]] [[oceanic trench]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Active Faults of the World|last=Yeats|first=R.|date=2012|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0521190855|page=478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While much of the [[island arc]] experiences intermediate-depth earthquakes along a Wadati–Benioff zone that dips steeply at 70°, the area adjacent to the [[d'Entrecasteaux Ridge]] does not. There is a corresponding gap in seismicity that occurs below {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} where it intrudes into the subduction zone from the west. According to the NUVEL-1 global relative plate motion model, convergence is occurring at roughly {{convert|8|cm|abbr=on}} per year. The uncertainty, which also affects the Tonga arc, is due to the influence of [[Divergent boundary|spreading]] at the North Fiji basin. Of the 58 M7 or greater events that occurred between 1909 and 2001, few were studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Deep Earthquakes|url=|first=C.|last=Frolich|date=2006|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0805836523|pages=399–401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lakes ranked by maximum depth==

This list contains all lakes whose maximum depth is reliably known to exceed {{Convert|400|m|ft|-2}}''

Geologically, the [[Caspian Sea]], like the [[Black Sea|Black]] and [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] seas, is a remnant of the ancient [[Tethys Ocean]]. The deepest area is oceanic rather than continental crust. However, it is generally regarded by geographers as a large [[endorheic]] [[salt lake]].

  The following table uses the {{nts}} template to permit sorting of numeric values. Without
  this approach a value of 101 meters would sort higher than 1000 meters.
  Example: To enter a cell value of 923 meters, place {{nts|923}} in the meters column.
  To enter a value that includes non-numeric characters, use the {{ntsh}} template;
  this allows you to specify a sort value that does not exactly match the text displayed.
  Example: To enter a cell value of &gt;900 meters, place {{ntsh|900}}&gt;900 in the meters column.

| ([[Caspian Sea]]&lt;ref name=Caspian&gt;The [[Caspian Sea]] is generally regarded by geographers, biologists and [[limnologist]]s as a huge inland [[salt lake]]. However, the Caspian's large size means that for some purposes it is better modeled as a sea.

==Lakes ranked by mean depth==
Mean depth can be a more useful indicator than maximum depth for many ecological purposes. Unfortunately, accurate mean depth figures are only available for well-studied lakes, as they must be calculated by dividing the lake's volume by its surface area. A reliable volume figure requires a [[bathymetric]] survey. Therefore, mean depth figures are not available for many deep lakes in remote locations.

The [[Caspian Sea]] ranks much further down the list on mean depth, as it has a large [[continental shelf]] (significantly larger than the oceanic basin that contains its greatest depths).

  The following table uses the {{nts}} template to permit sorting of numeric values. Without
  this approach a value of 101 meters would sort higher than 1000 meters.
  Example: To enter a cell value of 923 meters, place {{nts|923}} in the meters column.
  To enter a value that includes non-numeric characters, use the {{ntsh}} template;
  this allows you to specify a sort value that does not exactly match the text displayed.
  Example: To enter a cell value of &gt;900 meters, place {{ntsh|900}}&gt;900 in the meters column.
  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:nts and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:ntsh

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11625">{{Lunar-geo-time}}
The '''lunar geological timescale''' (or '''selenological timescale''') divides the history of [[Earth]]'s [[Moon]] into five generally recognized periods: the [[Copernican period|Copernican]], [[Eratosthenian]], Imbrian ([[Late Imbrian|Late]] and [[Early Imbrian|Early]] epochs), [[Nectarian]], and [[Pre-Nectarian]]. The boundaries of this time scale are related to large [[impact event]]s that have modified the [[lunar surface]], changes in [[impact crater|crater]] formation through time, and the size-frequency distribution of craters superposed on geological units. The absolute ages for these periods have been constrained by [[radiometric dating]] of samples obtained from the lunar surface. However, there is still much debate concerning the ages of certain key events, because correlating lunar [[regolith]] samples with geological units on the Moon is difficult, and most lunar radiometric ages have been highly affected by an intense history of bombardment.

==Lunar stratigraphy==
{{Timeline Lunar Geological Timescale}}
The primary geological processes that have modified the lunar surface are [[impact crater]]ing and [[volcanism]], and by using standard [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] principles&lt;ref name="W87"&gt;{{cite book | title =Geologic History of the Moon  | url =http://ser.sese.asu.edu/GHM/ | last = Don Wilhelms | publisher =  U.S. Geological Survey  Professional Paper 1348 | date = 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; (such as the [[law of superposition]]) it is possible to order these geological events in time. At one time, it was thought that the [[lunar mare|mare basalts]] might represent a single stratigraphic unit with a unique age, but it is now recognized that mare volcanism was an  ongoing process, beginning as early as 4.2 Ga&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=James Papike |author2=Grahm Ryder |author3=Charles Shearer  |last-author-amp=yes | title = Lunar Samples  | journal = Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry | volume = 36 | pages = 5.1–5.234 | date = 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1 Ga = 1 billion years ago) and continuing to perhaps as late as 1.2 Ga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = H. Hiesinger, J. W. Head, U. Wolf, R. Jaumann, and G. Neukum | title = Ages and stratigraphy of mare basalts in Oceanus Procellarum, Mare Numbium, Mare Cognitum, and Mare Insularum  | journal = J. Geophys. Res. | volume = 108 | pages = | date = 2003 | doi = 10.1029/2002JE001985 | nopp = true | first1 = H. | bibcode=2003JGRE..108.5065H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impact events are by far the most useful for defining a lunar stratigraphy as they are numerous and form in a geological instant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = D. Stöffler  and G. Ryder | title = Stratigraphy and isotope ages of lunar geological units: chronological standards for the inner solar system | date = 2001 | journal = Space Sci. Rev. | pages = 9–54 | volume = 96 | doi = 10.1023/A:1011937020193 | first1 = D. | last2 = Ryder | first2 = G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The continued effects of impact cratering over long periods of time modify the morphology of lunar landforms in a quantitative way, and the state of erosion of a landform can also be used to assign a relative age.

The lunar geological time scale has been divided into five periods (Pre-Nectarian, Nectarian, Imbrian, Eratosthenian, and Copernican) with one of these (the Imbrian) being subdivided into two epochs. These divisions of geological time are based on the recognition of convenient geomorphological markers, and as such, they should not be taken to imply that any fundamental changes in geological processes have occurred at these boundaries. The Moon is unique in the [[solar system]] in that it is the only body (other than the Earth) for which we possess rock samples with a known geological context. By correlating the ages of samples obtained from the [[Apollo missions]] to known geological units, it has been possible to assign absolute  ages to some of these geological periods. The timeline below represents one such attempt, but it is important to note (as is discussed below) that some of the ages are either uncertain, or disputed. In many [[lunar highland]] regions, it is not possible to distinguish between Nectarian and Pre-Nectarian materials, and these deposits are sometimes labeled as just '''Pre-Imbrian'''.

===Pre-Nectarian===
{{main|Pre-Nectarian}}
The [[Pre-Nectarian]] period is defined from the point at which the lunar crust formed, to the time of the Nectaris impact event. [[Mare Nectaris|Nectaris]] is a multi-ring impact basin that formed on the [[near side of the Moon]], and its ejecta blanket serves as a useful stratigraphic marker. 30 impact basins from this period are recognized, the oldest of which is the [[South Pole–Aitken basin]]. This geological period has been informally subdivided into the [[Cryptic era|Cryptic]] and [[Basin Groups]] 1-9,&lt;ref name="W87" /&gt; but these divisions are not used on any geological maps.

===Nectarian===
{{main|Nectarian}}
The [[Nectarian]] period encompasses all events that occurred between the formation of the [[Mare Nectaris|Nectaris]] and [[Mare Imbrium|Imbrium]] impact basins. 12 multi-ring impact basins are recognized in the Nectarian period, including the [[Mare Serenitatis|Serenitatis]] and [[Mare Crisium|Crisium]] basins. One of the scientific objectives of the [[Apollo 16]] mission was to date material excavated by the Nectaris impact basin. Nevertheless, the age of the Nectaris basin is somewhat contentious, with the most frequently cited numbers being 3.92 Ga, and less frequently 3.85 Ga. Recently, it has been suggested that the Nectaris basin could be, in fact, much older at ~4.1 Ga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=R. Korotev |author2=J. Gillis |author3=L. Haskin |author4=B. Jolliff  |last-author-amp=yes | title = On the age of the Nectaris basin | journal=Workshop on Moon Beyond | date = 2002 | pages = abstract 3029 | nopp = true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imbrian===
{{main|Late Imbrian|Early Imbrian}}
The Imbrian period has been subdivided into [[Late Imbrian|Late]] and [[Early Imbrian|Early]] epochs. The Early Imbrian is defined as the time between the formation of the [[Mare Imbrium|Imbrium]] and [[Mare Orientale|Orientale]] impact basins. The Imbrium basin is believed to have formed at 3.85 Ga, though a minority opinion places this event at 3.77 Ga. The [[Schrödinger (crater)|Schrödinger basin]] is the only other multi-ring basin that is Lower Imbrian in age, and no large multi-ring basins formed after this epoch.

The Late Imbrian is defined as the time between the formation of the Orientale basin, and the time at which craters of a certain size (D&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) have been obliterated by erosional processes. The age of the Orientale basin has not been directly determined, though it must be older than 3.72 Ga (based on Upper Imbrian ages of mare basalts) and could be as old as 3.84 Ga based on the size-frequency distributions of craters superposed on Orientale ejecta. About two-thirds of the Moon's mare basalts erupted within the Upper Imbrian Series, with many of these lavas filling the depressions associated with older impact basins.

===Eratosthenian===
{{main|Eratosthenian}}
The base of the [[Eratosthenian]] period is defined by the time at which craters on a geological unit of a certain size D&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; have been almost completely obliterated by erosional processes. The principal erosional agent on the Moon is impact cratering itself, though seismic modification could play a minor role as well. The absolute age of this boundary is not well defined, but is commonly quoted as being near 3.2 Ga. The younger boundary of this period is defined based on the recognition that freshly excavated materials on the lunar surface are generally bright and that they become darker over time as a result of [[space weathering]] processes. Operationally, this period was originally defined as the time at which impact craters lost their bright [[ray system]]s. This definition, however, has recently been subjected to some criticism as some crater rays are bright for compositional reasons that are unrelated to the amount of space weathering they have incurred. In particular, if the ejecta from a crater formed in the highlands (which is composed of bright anorthositic materials) is deposited on the low albedo mare, it will remain bright even after being space weathered.

===Copernican===
{{main|Copernican period}}
The [[Copernican period]] is the youngest geological period of the Moon. Originally, the presence of a bright ray system surrounding an impact crater was used to define Copernican units, but as mentioned above, this is complicated by the presence of compositional ray systems. The base of the Copernican period does not correspond to the formation of the impact crater Copernicus. The age of the base of the Copernican is not well constrained, but a commonly quoted number is 1.1 Ga. The Copernican extends until the present day.

==Relationship to Earth's geologic time scale==
The divisions of the lunar geologic time scale are based on the recognition of a few convenient geomorphological markers. While these divisions are extremely useful for [[Relative dating|ordering geological events in a relative manner]], it is important to realize that the boundaries do not imply any fundamental change of geological processes. Furthermore, as the oldest geological periods of the Moon are based exclusively on the times of individual impact events (in particular, Nectaris, Imbrium, and Orientale), these punctual events will most likely not correspond to any specific geological event on the other terrestrial planets, such as [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], or [[Mars]].

Nevertheless, at least one notable scientific work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A Geologic time scale 1989 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = 1990 |author1=W. Harland |author2=R. Armstrong |author3=A. Cox |author4=L. Craig |author5=A. Smith |author6=D. Smith }}&lt;/ref&gt; has advocated using the lunar geological time scale to subdivide the [[Hadean]] eon of Earth's [[geologic time scale]]. In particular, it is sometimes found that the Hadean is subdivided into the [[Cryptic era|Cryptic]], [[Basin Groups]] 1-9, [[Nectarian]], and [[Early Imbrian]]. This notation is not entirely consistent with the above lunar geologic time scale in that the Cryptic and Basin Groups 1-9 (both of which are only informal terms that are not used in geologic maps) comprise the [[Pre-Nectarian]] period.

'''Miombo''' is the vernacular word for ''[[Brachystegia]]'', a [[genus]] of tree comprising a large number of tree species together with Julbernadia species in woodlands&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gambiza|first=J|last2=Bond|first2=W|last3=Frost|first3=P.G.H|last4=Higgins|first4=S|title=SPECIAL SECTION: LAND USE OPTIONS IN DRY TROPICAL WOODLAND ECOSYSTEMS IN ZIMBABWE|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0921-8009(00)00145-2|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=33|issue=3|pages=353–368|doi=10.1016/s0921-8009(00)00145-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;. '''Miombo woodland''' is classified in the [[tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] biome (in the World Wildlife Fund scheme). The [[biome]] includes four woodland [[savanna]] ecoregions (listed below) characterized by the predominant presence of miombo species, with a range of climates from humid to semi-arid, and tropical to subtropical or even temperate.

Characteristically the trees shed their leaves for a short period in the dry season to reduce water loss, and produce a flush of new leaves just before the onset of the rainy season with rich gold and red colours masking the underlying chlorophyll, reminiscent of temperate autumn colours. 

The name miombo is used in a number of [[Bantu languages]] in the region such as [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Shona language|Shona]] and [[Bemba language|Bemba]]. In Bemba, the word "miombo" is the plural of the word "muombo", which is the specific name for the species [[Brachystegia|''Brachystegia longifolia'']].

==Miombo woodland ecoregions==
Miombo woodlands form a broad belt across south-central Africa, running from [[Angola]] in the west to [[Tanzania]] to the east. These woodlands are dominated by trees of subfamily [[Caesalpinioideae]], particularly miombo (''Brachystegia''), ''[[Julbernardia]]'' and ''[[Isoberlinia]]'', which are rarely found outside miombo woodlands. The four ecoregions are:

*[[Angolan miombo woodlands]] ([[Angola]])
*[[Central Zambezian miombo woodlands]] (Angola, [[Burundi]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Malawi]], [[Tanzania]], [[Zambia]])
*[[Eastern miombo woodlands]] ([[Mozambique]], Tanzania)
*[[Southern miombo woodlands]] (Malawi, Mozambique, southern Zambia, [[Zimbabwe]])
Moreover miombo woodlands could be classified as dry or wet based on the per annum amount and distribution of rainfall&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abdallah|first=J. M.|last2=Monela|first2=G. G.|date=2007|title=Overview of Miombo Woodlands in Tanzania|url=http://www.metla.fi/julkaisut/workingpapers/2007/mwp050-02.pdf|journal=Working Papers of Finnish Research Institute|volume=50|pages=9 - 23|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Where by dry woodlands occurs in those areas receiving less than 1000 mm annual rainfall. Mostly in Zimbabwe, Central Tanzania and southern areas of Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia. On the contrary wet woodlands whilst more than 1000 mm annual rainfall are located in Northern Zambia, eastern Angola. central Malawi and south western Tanzania. 

==People==
These miombo woodlands are also important to the livelihoods of many rural people, who depend on the resources available from the woodland. The wide variety of species provides non-timber products such as fruits, [[honey]], [[fodder]] for livestock and fuelwood. 

==Flora and fauna==
Despite the relatively nutrient-poor soil, long dry season (and low rainfall in some areas) the woodland is home to many species, including several miombo specialist [[Endemism|endemic]] bird species. The predominant tree is miombo (''[[Brachystegia]]'' spp.). It also provides food and cover for [[mammal]]s such as the [[African elephant]] (''Loxodonta africana''), [[African wild dog]] (''Lycaon pictus''), [[sable antelope]] (''Hippotragus niger'') and [[Lichtenstein's hartebeest]] (''Sigmoceros lichtensteinii'').&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M Campbell. 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1309">'''Narrow bipolar pulses''' are high-energy, high-[[altitude]], intra-[[cloud]] [[electricity|electrical]] discharges associated with [[thunderstorm]]s.  NBP are similar to other forms of [[lightning]] events such as [[Lightning#Return_stroke|return strokes]] and [[Lightning#Re-strike|dart leaders]], but produce an optical emission of at least an order of magnitude smaller.  They typically occur in the 10–20&amp;nbsp;km altitude range and can emit a power on the order of a few hundred gigawatts.  They produce far-field asymmetric bipolar electric field change signatures (called narrow bipolar events).

=== Early career ===
Born a commoner in [[Saint-Martin-de-Ré]] on the [[Île de Ré]] on 17 February 1754,{{sfn|Dunmore|1991|pp=16–17}} Baudin joined the merchant navy at the age of 15 and the [[French East India Company]] at the age of 20. 

Baudin then joined the [[French Navy|''La Marine Royale'']] (French Navy) in 1774{{sfn|Dunmore|1991|pp=16–17}} and served in the [[Caribbean]] as an ''[[officier bleu]]'' during the [[American War of Independence]] of 1775–1783.

In 1785 Baudin and his brother Alexandre were respectively masters of the ''St Remy'' and ''Caroline'', taking [[Acadian]] settlers from [[Nantes]] to [[New Orleans|La Nouvelle Orléans]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl A. Brasseaux, ''The Founding of New Acadia: The Beginnings of Acadian Life in Louisiana, 1765–1803,'' Baton Rouge, Louisiana State University Press, 1987, p109; William Dawson Gerrior, ''Acadian Awakenings: Louisiana,'' Port Royal Pub., 2003, pp.73, 104; 
Madeleine Ly-Tio-Fane, ''Le Géographe et le Naturaliste à l'île-de-France: ultime escale du capitaine Baudin,'' Port-Louis, Ile Maurice, 2003, p.33.&lt;/ref&gt; In New Orleans local merchants contracted him to take a cargo of wood, salted meat, cod and flour to [[Isle de France (Mauritius)|Isle de France]] (now [[Mauritius]]), which he did in ''Josephine'' (also called ''Pepita''), departing New Orleans on 14 July 1786 and arriving at Isle de France on 27 March 1787. In the course of the voyage, ''Josephine'' had called at [[Cap-Haïtien | Cap‑Français]] in [[Haiti]] to make a contract to transport slaves there from Madagascar; while in Haiti he also encountered the Austrian botanist [[Franz Josef Maerter]], who apparently informed him that another Austrian botanist, [[Franz Boos]], was at the Cape of Good Hope awaiting a ship to take him to Mauritius. ''Josephine'' called at the Cape and took Boos on board.&lt;ref&gt;David K. Wetherbee, ''Further Contributions to the History of Zoology in Hispaniola,'' Shelburne, Massachusetts, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; At Mauritius, Boos chartered Baudin to transport him and the collection of plant specimens he had gathered there and at the Cape back to Europe, which Baudin did, ''Josephine'' arriving at [[Trieste]] on 18 June 1788.&lt;ref&gt;Sébastien Brunner (ed.), ''Correspondances intimes de l'Empereur Joseph II avec son ami le comte de Cobenzl et son premier ministre le prince de Kaunitz,'' Mainz, Kirchheim, 1871, p.75.[http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno?aid=wrz&amp;datum=17880618&amp;seite=2&amp;zoom=33&amp;query=%22Wiener%2BZeitung%22%2B%22Juni%22%2B%221788%22%2B%22Triest%22%2B%22Schiff%22&amp;ref=anno-search ''Wiener Zeitung,'' 18 Juni 1788, p.1494]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Holy Roman Empire | Imperial]] government in Vienna was contemplating organizing another natural-history expedition, to which Boos would be appointed, in which two ships would be sent to the Malabar and Coromandel coasts of India, the Persian Gulf, Bengal, Ceylon, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Cochin China, Tongking, Japan and China. Baudin had been given reason to hope that he would be given command of the ships of this expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Ly-Tio-Fane, ''Le ''Géographe'' et le ''Naturaliste'' à l'île-de-France 1801, 1803 : ultime escale du capitaine Baudin,'' Port-Louis, Ile Maurice, 2003, pp.50–51; Sébastien Brunner (ed.), ''Correspondances intimes de l'Empereur Joseph II avec son Ami le Comte de Cobenzl et son Premier Ministre le Prince de Kaunitz,'' Mainz, Kirchheim, 1871, p.75.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Austrian expeditions ===
Later in 1788 Baudin sailed on a commercial voyage from Trieste to [[Guangzhou|Canton]] in ''Jardiniere''. He apparently arrived at Canton from Mauritius under the flag of the United States of America, probably to avoid the possibility of having his ship seized by the Chinese for payment of the debts owed them by the Imperial Asiatic Company of Trieste.&lt;ref&gt;Hosea Ballou Morse, ''The Chronicles of the East India Company Trading to China, 1635–1834,'' Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1926, Vol.II, p.174.&lt;/ref&gt; From there, he sent ''Jardiniere'' under her second captain on a fur-trading venture to the north-west coast of America, but the ship foundered off [[Asuncion Island]] in the Marianas in late 1789.&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Ly-Tio-Fane, “Contacts between Schönbrunn and the Jardin du Roi at Isle de France (Mauritius) in the 18th Century”, ''Mitteilungen des Oesterreichischen Staatsarchiv,'' No.35, 1982, pp.85–109, p.102; ''Frank Horner, The French reconnaissance: Baudin in Australia, 1801–1803,'' Melbourne University Press, 1987, p.26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baudin made his way to Mauritius, where he purchased a replacement ship, ''Jardiniere II'', but this vessel was wrecked in a [[cyclone]] that struck [[Port Louis]] on 15 December 1789. Baudin embarked on the Spanish Royal Philippines Company ship, ''Placeres'', which sailed from Port Louis for Cadiz in August 1790. ''Placeres'' called at the Cape of Good Hope where it took on board the large number of plant and animal specimens collected in South Africa for the Imperial palace at [[Schönbrunn Palace|Schönbrunn]] by [[Georg Scholl]], the assistant of [[Franz Boos]]. Because of the poor condition of the ship, ''Placeres'' had to put in at the island of [[Trinidad]] in the West Indies, where Scholl's collection of specimens was deposited.&lt;ref&gt;''Gazeta de Madrid,'' 19 de Julio de 1791, p.501.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baudin proceeded to [[Martinique]], from where he addressed an offer to the Imperial government in Vienna to conduct to Canton commissioners who would be empowered to negotiate with the Chinese merchants there a settlement of the debts incurred by the Imperial Asiatic Company, which would enable the company to renew its trade with China. On its return voyage from Canton, the proposed expedition would call at the Cape of Good Hope to pick up Scholl and the remainder of his natural-history collection for conveyance to Schönbrunn.

After returning to Vienna in September 1791, Baudin continued to press his case for an expedition under the Imperial flag to the Indian Ocean and China, and in January 1792 he was granted a commission of captain in the Imperial navy for this purpose. A ship, called ''Jardiniere'', was acquired and the botanists Franz Bredemeyer and Joseph van der Schot appointed to the expedition. After delays caused by the outbreak of [[War of the First Coalition | war between France and Austria]] (April 1792), ''Jardiniere'' departed from the Spanish port of [[Málaga]] on 1 October 1792.&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Ly-Tio-Fane, “Contacts between Schönbrunn and the Jardin du Roi at Isle de France (Mauritius) in the 18th Century”, ''Mitteilungen des Oesterreichischen Staatsarchiv,'' No.35, 1982, pp.85–109.&lt;/ref&gt; From the Cape of Good Hope ''Jardiniere'' sailed across the Indian Ocean to the coast of New Holland (Australia), but two consecutive cyclones prevented the expedition from doing any work there and forced Baudin to take the ship to [[Bombay]] for repairs.

From Bombay the expedition proceeded to the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea and the east coast of Africa, where it gathered botanical and zoological collections. The expedition came to an abrupt end in June 1794 when ''Jardiniere'' went aground in a storm while attempting to enter [[Table Bay]] at the Cape of Good Hope. Baudin survived the wreck and made his way to the United States, from where he went to France.&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Ly-Tio-Fane, “Contacts between Schönbrunn and the Jardin du Roi at Isle de France (Mauritius) in the 18th Century”, ''Mitteilungen des Oesterreichischen Staatsarchiv,'' No.35, 1982, pp.85–109, p.102; ''Frank Horner, The French reconnaissance: Baudin in Australia, 1801–1803,'' Melbourne University Press, 1987, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt; He managed to send ''Jardiniere''{{'}}s cargo of natural history specimens to the island of [[Trinidad]].

=== ''Belle Angélique'' Expedition ===
In Paris, Baudin visited [[Antoine de Jussieu]] at the [[Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle]] in March 1796 to suggest a botanical voyage to the Caribbean, during which he would recover the collection of specimens he had left in Trinidad. The Museum and the French government accepted the proposal, and Baudin was appointed commander of an expedition in the ship ''Belle Angélique,'' with four assigned botanists: [[René Maugé de Cely|René Maugé]], [[André Pierre Ledru]], [[Anselme Riedlé]] and Stanislas Levillain. ''Belle Angélique'' cleared [[Le Havre]] on 30 September 1796 for the Canary Islands, where the ship was condemned as unseaworthy. The expedition sailed from the Canaries in a replacement vessel, ''Fanny'', and reached Trinidad in April 1797. The British, who had just captured the island from the Spanish in February 1797, refused to allow Baudin to recover the collection of natural-history specimens. Baudin took ''Fanny'' to [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] and [[St. Croix]], and then to [[Puerto Rico]], specimens being collected in all three islands. At St Croix, ''Fanny'' was replaced by a newly purchased ship, renamed ''Belle Angelique''.&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Ly-Tio-Fane, "A reconnaissance of tropical resources during Revolutionary years: the role of the Paris Museum d'Histoire Naturelle", ''Archives of Natural History,'' vol.18, 1991, pp. 352–355.&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition returned to France in June 1798 with a large collection of plants, [[bird]]s and [[insect]]s, which was incorporated into Napoleon Bonaparte's triumphal procession celebrating his recent Italian victories.&lt;ref&gt;André Pierre Ledru, ''Voyage aux iles de Teneriffe, la Trinite, Saint-Thomas Sainte-Croix et Porto Ricco,'' Paris, Bertrand, 1810; Nicolas Baudin, ''Voyage aux Antilles de La Belle Angélique'', édition établie et commentée par Michel Jangoux, préface du contre-amiral Georges Prud'homme, Paris, PUPS, coll. « Imago mundi-Textes », 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maquette-Géographe-Nicolas-Baudin.jpeg|thumb|Model of {{ship|French corvette|Géographe||2}}, now exhibited at the museum E. Cognac, in Saint-Martin-de-Ré]]
On 24 July 1798, at the suggestion of the [[Ministère de la Marine | Ministry of Marine]], Baudin presented to the Assembly of Professors and Administrators of the National Museum of Natural History a plan for a hydrographic-survey expedition to the [[South Seas]], which would include a search for fauna and flora that could be brought back for cultivation in France. The expedition would also have the aim of promoting the economic and commercial interests of France in the regions to be visited. The expedition would require two well-equipped ships, which would carry a team of astronomers, naturalists and scientific draughtsmen over whom Baudin as commander would have absolute authority. The first part of the voyage would be devoted to a thorough exploration of the coast of Chile and the collection of animal, bird and plant specimens suitable for acclimatization in France, followed by a survey of the coasts from Peru to Mexico. The expedition would then continue into the Pacific Ocean, including a visit to [[Tahiti]] and the Society Islands, and would be completed with a survey of the yet unexplored south-west coast of [[New Holland (Australia) | New Holland]] (Australia).&lt;ref&gt;Baudin aux Citoyens Professeurs et Adminitstrateurs du Museum nationale d’histoire naturelle à Paris, 6 Thermidor An VI [24 Juillet 1798], Archives nationales, Paris, AJXV 569, ff.178–179; cited in Madeleine Ly-Tio-Fane, "A reconnaissance of tropical resources during Revolutionary years: the role of the Paris Museum d'Histoire Naturelle", ''Archives of Natural History,'' vol.18, 1991, pp.333–362, p.358.&lt;/ref&gt; After considering this extensive proposal, the French government decided to proceed with an expedition confined to a survey of western and southern New Holland (as Australia was called at the time).

=== New Holland Expedition ===
[[File:Flinders and Baudin's race to map Australia.ogv|thumb|Discussion of Baudin and [[Matthew Flinders]]' race to map Australia.]]
In October 1800 Baudin was selected{{by whom?|date=April 2017}} to lead what has become known as the [[Baudin expedition to Australia|Baudin expedition]] to map the coast of [[Australia]] (New Holland). He had two ships, {{ship|French corvette|Géographe||2}} and {{ship|French corvette|Naturaliste||2}} captained by [[Jacques Félix Emmanuel Hamelin|Hamelin]], and a suite of nine zoologists and botanists, including [[Jean Baptiste Leschenault de la Tour]]. He reached Australia in May 1801, and would explore and map the western coast and a part of the little-known southern coast of the continent. The scientific expedition proved a great success, with more than 2500 new species discovered.
The French also met [[Indigenous people|Aboriginal]] peoples and treated them with great respect.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In April 1802 Baudin met [[Matthew Flinders]], also engaged in charting the coastline, in [[Encounter Bay]] in present-day [[South Australia]]. Baudin then stopped at the British colony at [[Sydney]] for supplies. In Sydney he bought a new ship — {{ship||Casuarina|schooner|2}} — named after the wood it was made from. From there he sent home ''Naturaliste'', which had on board all of the specimens that had been discovered by Baudin and his crew. He then headed for [[Tasmania]], before continuing north to [[Timor]]. Baudin then sailed for home, stopping at [[Mauritius]].

According to recent researches by academics from the [[University of Adelaide]], during Baudin's expedition, [[François Péron]], who had become the chief zoologist and intellectual leader of the mission, wrote a report for [[Napoleon]] on ways to invade and capture the British colony at [[Sydney Cove]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brice|first1=Rebecca|title=Sacre bleu! French invasion plan for Sydney|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-12-10/aussies-study-french-invasion-plan-for-sydney/4419168|accessdate=2017-09-30|work=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=2012-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Baudin died of [[tuberculosis]] at Mauritius on 16 September 1803, at the age of 49, apparently in the home of Madame Alexandrine Kerivel. Baudin's exact resting place is not known, but the historian [[Auguste Toussaint]] believed that he was interred in the Kerivel family vault. However, the historian [[Edward Duyker]] likes to think that Baudin was buried in Le Cimetière de l’Ouest in the district of [[Port Louis]] "just a few hundred metres from the explorer’s certain love: the sea".&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Duyker|Duyker, E]]. (1999) ''In Search of Madame Kerivel and Baudin’s Last Resting Place''. National Library of Australia News, vol. IX, no. 12, September, pp. 8–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Oligocene''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|ˈ|ɒ|l|ᵻ|ɡ|oʊ|s|iː|n}}) is a geologic [[epoch (geology)|epoch]] of the [[Paleogene]] [[Geologic time scale|Period]] and extends from about 33.9 million to 23 million years before the present ({{val|33.9|0.1}} to {{val|23.03|0.05|ul=Ma}}). As with other older geologic periods, the rock beds that define the epoch are well identified but the exact dates of the start and end of the epoch are slightly uncertain. The name Oligocene was coined in 1854 by the German paleontologist [[Heinrich Ernst Beyrich]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beyrich |title=Über die Stellung der hessische Tertiärbildungen |trans-title=On the position of the Hessian Tertiary formations |journal=Verhandlungen Köngliche Preussischen Akademie Wissenschaft Berlin [Proceedings of the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences at Berlin] |date=November 1854 |pages=640–666 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044092888627;view=1up;seq=660}} From p. 664: ''"Der neue Name Oligocän mag sich zwischenstellen zwischen das ältere Eocän und das jüngere Miocän."'' (The new name Oligocene may be interposed between the older Eocene and the younger Miocene.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilmarth |first1=Mary Grace |title=Bulletin 769:  The Geologic Time Classification of the United States Geological Survey Compared With Other Classifications, accompanied by the original definitions of era, period and epoch terms |date=1925 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C., U.S.A. |page=53 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=my7x_PBkpm4C&amp;pg=PA53#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; the name comes from the Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|ὀλίγος}} (''olígos'', "few") and {{lang|grc|καινός}} (''kainós'', "new"),&lt;ref name=OnlineEtDict&gt;{{cite web|title=Oligocene|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Oligocene&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to the sparsity of [[Neontology|extant]] forms of [[Mollusca|mollusc]]s. The Oligocene is preceded by the [[Eocene]] Epoch and is followed by the [[Miocene]] Epoch. The Oligocene is the third and final epoch of the [[Paleogene]] Period.
 
The Oligocene is often considered an important time of transition, a link between the archaic world of the tropical Eocene and the more modern [[ecosystem]]s of the Miocene.&lt;ref&gt;Haines, Tim; ''Walking with Beasts: A Prehistoric Safari,'' (New York: Dorling Kindersley Publishing, Inc., 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Major changes during the Oligocene included a global expansion of [[grassland]]s, and a regression of [[tropical]] broad leaf [[forest]]s to the [[equatorial belt]].

The start of the Oligocene is marked by a notable [[extinction event]] called the [[Eocene–Oligocene extinction event#Grande Coupure|Grande Coupure]]; it featured the replacement of [[Europe]]an fauna with [[Asia]]n [[fauna]], except for the endemic [[rodent]] and [[marsupial]] families. By contrast, the Oligocene–Miocene boundary is not set at an easily identified worldwide event but rather at regional boundaries between the warmer late Oligocene and the relatively cooler Miocene.

== Subdivisions ==

Oligocene [[faunal stage]]s from youngest to oldest are:

==Paleogeography==
[[File:Mediterranean Rupelian.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Neotethys]] in oligocene (Rupelian, 33,9 — 28,4 mya)]]
During this epoch, the continents continued to [[continental drift|drift]] toward their present positions. [[Antarctica]] became more isolated and finally developed an [[ice cap]].

[[Orogeny|Mountain building]] in western [[North America]] continued, and the [[Alps]] started to rise in [[Europe]] as the [[African Plate|African plate]] continued to push north into the [[Eurasian plate]], isolating the remnants of the [[Tethys Sea]]. A brief marine incursion marks the early Oligocene in Europe. Marine fossils from the Oligocene are rare in North America. There appears to have been a land bridge in the early Oligocene between North America and Europe, since the [[Fauna (animals)|faunas]] of the two regions are very similar. Sometime during the Oligocene, [[South America]] was finally detached from [[Antarctica]] and drifted north towards [[North America]]. It also allowed the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] to flow, rapidly cooling the Antarctic continent.

==Flora==
[[Angiosperm]]s continued their expansion throughout the world as tropical and sub-[[tropical forest]]s were replaced by [[temperate deciduous forest]]s. Open [[plain]]s and [[desert]]s became more common and [[grass]]es expanded from their water-bank habitat in the Eocene moving out into open tracts. However, even at the end of the period, grass was not quite common enough for modern [[savanna]]s.

In North America, subtropical species dominated with [[cashew]]s and [[lychee]] trees present, and temperate trees such as [[rose]]s,{{Clarify|date=February 2011}} [[beech]]es, and [[pine]]s were common. The [[legume]]s spread, while [[Cyperaceae|sedge]]s, [[Typha|bulrush]]es, and [[fern]]s continued their ascent.

==Fauna==
[[File:Oligocene.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Restoration of Oligocene fauna of North America]]
Even more open landscapes allowed animals to grow to larger sizes than they had earlier in the [[Paleocene]] epoch 30 million years earlier. Marine faunas became fairly modern, as did terrestrial [[vertebrate]] fauna on the northern continents. This was probably more as a result of older forms dying out than as a result of more modern forms evolving. Many groups, such as [[equid]]s, [[entelodont]]s, [[rhino]]s, [[merycoidodont]]s, and [[camelid]]s, became more able to run during this time, adapting to the plains that were spreading as the Eocene rainforests receded. The first [[felid]], ''[[Proailurus]]'', originated in Asia during the late Oligocene and spread to Europe.&lt;ref name =Mott&gt;{{cite web| last = Mott| first = Maryann| title = Cats Climb New family Tree| publisher = National Geographic News| date = 2006-01-11| url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/01/0111_060111_cat_evolution.html| accessdate = 2006-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Macrauchenia2.jpg|thumb|[[Macrauchenia]]: a [[Litopterna|Litoptern]]]]
South America was isolated from the other continents and evolved a quite distinct fauna during the Oligocene. The South American continent became home to strange animals such as [[pyrotheria|pyrothere]]s and [[astrapotheria|astrapothere]]s, as well as [[litoptern]]s and [[notoungulate]]s. [[Sebecosuchian]]s, [[Phorusrhacidae|terror birds]], and carnivorous [[metathere]]s, like the [[Borhyaenidae|borhyaenids]] remained the dominant predators.

[[Brontotheriidae|Brontotheres]] died out in the Earliest Oligocene, and [[creodonts]] died out outside [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]] at the end of the period. [[Multituberculates]], an ancient lineage of primitive mammals that originated back in the [[Jurassic]], also became extinct in the Oligocene, aside from the [[gondwanathere]]s. The Oligocene was home to a wide variety of strange mammals. A good example of this would be the [[White River Fauna]] of central North America, which were formerly a semiarid prairie home to many different types of endemic mammals, including entelodonts like ''[[Archaeotherium]]'', camelids (such as ''[[Poebrotherium]]''), running [[rhino]]ceratoids, three-toed equids (such as ''[[Mesohippus]]''), [[nimravids]], [[protoceratidae|protoceratid]]s, and early [[canid]]s like ''[[Hesperocyon]]''. Merycoidodonts, an endemic American group, were very diverse during this time. In Asia during the Oligocene, a group of running rhinoceratoids gave rise to the [[indricotheres]], like ''[[Paraceratherium]]'', which were the largest land mammals ever to walk the Earth.

The marine animals of Oligocene oceans resembled today's fauna, such as the [[bivalves]]. Calcareous [[Cirratulidae|cirratulids]] appeared in the Oligocene.&lt;ref name=Vinn2009&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fossil record of marine mammals is a little spotty during this time, and not as well known as the Eocene or Miocene, but some fossils have been found. The [[baleen whale]]s and [[toothed whales]] had just appeared, and their ancestors, the [[Archaeoceti|archaeocete]] [[cetacean]]s began to decrease in diversity due to their lack of echolocation, which was very useful as the water became colder and cloudier. Other factors to their decline could include climate changes and competition with today's modern cetaceans and the [[carcharhinid]] [[shark]]s, which also appeared in this epoch. Early [[desmostylia]]ns, like ''[[Behemotops]]'', are known from the Oligocene. [[Pinnipeds]] appeared near the end of the epoch from an [[otter]]-like ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Handwerk| first = Brian| title = Seal with "Arms" Discovered| publisher = National Geographic News| date = 2009-03-22| url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/04/090422-seal-evolution-missing-link.html| accessdate = 2014-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oceans==
The Oligocene sees the beginnings of modern ocean circulation, with tectonic shifts causing the opening and closing of ocean gateways. Cooling of the oceans had already commenced by the Eocene/Oligocene boundary,&lt;ref name="Lyle" /&gt; and they continued to cool as the Oligocene progressed. The formation of permanent Antarctic ice sheets during the early Oligocene and possible glacial activity in the Arctic may have influenced this oceanic cooling, though the extent of this influence is still a matter of some significant dispute.

===The effects of oceanic gateways on circulation===
The opening and closing of ocean gateways: the opening of the [[Drake Passage]]; the opening of the [[Tasmanian Gateway]] and the closing of the [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys]] seaway; along with the final formation of the [[Greenland]]–[[Iceland]]–[[Faroes]] [[Sill (geology)|sill]]; played vital parts in reshaping oceanic currents during the Oligocene. As the continents shifted to a more modern configuration, so too did ocean circulation.&lt;ref name="Proth" /&gt;

====The Drake Passage====
The Drake Passage is located between [[South America]] and [[Antarctica]]. Once the Tasmanian Gateway between Australia and Antarctica opened, all that kept Antarctica from being completely isolated by the [[Southern Ocean]] was its connection to South America. As the South American continent moved north, the Drake Passage opened and enabled the formation of the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] (ACC), which would have kept the cold waters of Antarctica circulating around that continent and strengthened the formation of Antarctic Bottom Water (ABW).&lt;ref name="Proth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mack" /&gt; With the cold water concentrated around Antarctica, sea surface temperatures and, consequently, continental temperatures would have dropped. The onset of Antarctic glaciation occurred during the early Oligocene,&lt;ref name="Via"/&gt; and the effect of the Drake Passage opening on this glaciation has been the subject of much research. However, some controversy still exists as to the exact timing of the passage opening, whether it occurred at the start of the Oligocene or nearer the end. Even so, many theories agree that at the Eocene/Oligocene (E/O) boundary, a yet shallow flow existed between South America and Antarctica, permitting the start of an Antarctic Circumpolar Current.&lt;ref name="Katz" /&gt;

Stemming from the issue of when the opening of the Drake Passage took place, is the dispute over how great of an influence the opening of the Drake Passage had on the global climate. While early researchers concluded that the advent of the ACC was highly important, perhaps even the trigger, for Antarctic glaciation&lt;ref name="Proth" /&gt; and subsequent global cooling, other studies have suggested that the δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O signature is too strong for glaciation to be the main trigger for cooling.&lt;ref name="Katz" /&gt; Through study of Pacific Ocean sediments, other researchers have shown that the transition from warm Eocene ocean temperatures to cool Oligocene ocean temperatures took only 300,000 years,&lt;ref name="Lyle" /&gt; which strongly implies that feedbacks and factors other than the ACC were integral to the rapid cooling.&lt;ref name="Lyle" /&gt;

===== The late Oligocene opening of the Drake Passage =====
The latest hypothesized time for the opening of the Drake Passage is during the early Miocene.&lt;ref name="Lyle" /&gt; Despite the shallow flow between South America and Antarctica, there was not enough of a deep water opening to allow for significant flow to create a true Antarctic Circumpolar Current. If the opening occurred as late as hypothesized, then the Antarctic Circumpolar Current could not have had much of an effect on early Oligocene cooling, as it would not have existed.

===== The early Oligocene opening of the Drake Passage =====
The earliest hypothesized time for the opening of the Drake Passage is around 30 Ma.{{r|Lyle}} One of the possible issues with this timing was the continental debris cluttering up the seaway between the two plates in question. This debris, along with what is known as the [[Shackleton Fracture Zone]], has been shown in a recent study to be fairly young, only about 8 million years old.{{r|Mack}} The study concludes that the Drake Passage would be free to allow significant deep water flow by around 31 Ma. This would have facilitated an earlier onset of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.

Currently, an opening of the Drake Passage during the early Oligocene is favored.

==== The opening of the Tasman Gateway ====
The other major oceanic gateway opening during this time was the Tasman, or Tasmanian, depending on the paper, gateway between Australia and Antarctica. The time frame for this opening is less disputed than the Drake Passage and is largely considered to have occurred around 34 Ma. As the gateway widened, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current strengthened.

==== The Tethys Seaway closing ====
The Tethys Seaway was not a gateway, but rather a sea in its own right. Its closing during the Oligocene had significant impact on both ocean circulation and climate. The collisions of the African plate with the European plate and of the Indian subcontinent with the Asian plate, cut off the Tethys Seaway that had provided a low-latitude ocean circulation.&lt;ref name="von" /&gt; The closure of Tethys built some new mountains (the Zagros range) and drew down more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, contributing to global cooling.&lt;ref name="Allen" /&gt;

====Greenland–Iceland–Faroes====
The gradual separation of the clump of continental crust and the deepening of the tectonic sill in the North Atlantic that would become Greenland, Iceland, and the Faroe Islands helped to increase the deep water flow in that area.&lt;ref name="Via" /&gt; More information about the evolution of North Atlantic Deep Water will be given a few sections down.

===Ocean cooling===
Evidence for ocean-wide cooling during the Oligocene exists mostly in isotopic proxies. Patterns of extinction&lt;ref name="Green" /&gt; and patterns of species migration&lt;ref name="Bose" /&gt; can also be studied to gain insight into ocean conditions. For a while, it was thought that the glaciation of Antarctica may have significantly contributed to the cooling of the ocean, however, recent evidence tends to deny this.&lt;ref name="Mack" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hay" /&gt;

===Deep water===
Isotopic evidence suggests that during the early Oligocene, the main source of deep water was the [[North Pacific]] and the [[Southern Ocean]]. As the Greenland-Iceland-Faroe [[Sill (geology)|sill]] deepened and thereby connected the Norwegian–Greenland sea with the Atlantic Ocean, the deep water of the [[North Atlantic]] began to come into play as well. Computer models suggest that once this occurred, a more modern in appearance thermo-haline circulation started.&lt;ref name="von" /&gt;

====North Atlantic deep water====
Evidence for the early Oligocene onset of chilled North Atlantic deep water lies in the beginnings of sediment drift deposition in the North Atlantic, such as the Feni and Southeast Faroe drifts.&lt;ref name="Via" /&gt;

====South Ocean deep water====
The chilling of the South Ocean deep water began in earnest once the Tasmanian Gateway and the Drake Passage opened fully.&lt;ref name="Mack" /&gt; Regardless of the time at which the opening of the Drake Passage occurred, the effect on the cooling of the Southern Ocean would have been the same.

The Pan-STARRS Project is a collaboration between the University of Hawaii [[Institute for Astronomy]], [[MIT]] [[Lincoln Laboratory]], [[MHPCC#Maui High Performance Computing Center (MHPCC)|Maui High Performance Computing Center]] and [[Science Applications International Corporation]]. Telescope construction was funded by the U.S. Air Force.

By detecting differences from previous observations of the same areas of the sky, Pan-STARRS is discovering a large number of new [[asteroid]]s,&lt;ref name="MPC-Discoverers"/&gt; [[comet]]s, [[variable star]]s, [[supernova]]e and other celestial objects. Its primary mission is now to detect [[Near-Earth Object]]s that threaten [[impact event]]s and it is expected to create a database of all objects visible from Hawaii (three-quarters of the entire sky) down to [[apparent magnitude]] 24. Construction of Pan-STARRS was funded in large part by the [[United States Air Force]] through their Research Labs. Additional funding to complete Pan-STARRS2 came from the [[NASA]] Near Earth Object Observation Program. Most of the funding presently used to operate the Pan-STARRS telescopes comes from the [[NASA]] [[Near Earth Object]] Observation Program. The Pan-STARRS NEO survey searches all the sky north of [[declination]] −47.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |user=astrokiwi |number=483572110179459073 |title=Don't have a clue were the "title" is in a tweet, BUT it is a required parameter for the citation! |author=Michele Bannister |date=30 Jun 2014 |accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consortium observations for the all sky (as visible from Hawaii) survey were completed in April 2014.

Having completed PS1, the Pan-STARRS Project is now focusing on building Pan-STARRS 2 (PS2), for which first light was achieved in 2013, with full science operations scheduled for 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/meeting/20131014/talk/2013101610_Talk_Wen-PingChen.pdf |author=Wen-Ping Chen |title=Current Status of the Pan-STARRS Project and Beyond |date=16 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427010400/http://events.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/meeting/20131014/talk/2013101610_Talk_Wen-PingChen.pdf |archive-date=2014-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then the full array of four telescopes, sometimes called PS4.

== Instruments ==
Pan-STARRS currently (2018) consists of two 1.8 m [[Ritchey–Chrétien telescope]]s located at [[Haleakala]] in [[Hawaii]].

The initial telescope, PS1, saw first light using a low-resolution camera in June 2006. The telescope has a 3° field of view, which is extremely large for telescopes of this size, and is equipped with the largest digital camera ever built, recording almost 1.4 billion pixels per image. The focal plane has 60 separately mounted close packed CCDs arranged in an 8 × 8 array. The corner positions are not populated, because the optics do not illuminate the corners. Each CCD device, called an Orthogonal Transfer Array (OTA), has 4800 × 4800 pixels, separated into 64 cells, each of 600 × 600 pixels. This gigapixel camera or 'GPC' saw first light on August 22, 2007, imaging the [[Andromeda Galaxy]].

After initial technical difficulties that were later mostly solved, PS1 began full operation on May 13, 2010.&lt;ref name="bhandw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/06/100622-science-space-digital-camera-asteroid-telescope|title=World's Largest Digital Camera to Watch for Killer Asteroids|last=Handwerk|first=Brian|date=June 22, 2010|publisher=National Geographic News|accessdate=26 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Nick Kaiser]], principal investigator of the Pan-STARRS project, summed it up saying “PS1 has been taking science-quality data for six months, but now we are doing it dusk-to-dawn every night.” (quote: June 15, 2010). The PS1 images however remain slightly less sharp than initially planned, which significantly affects some scientific uses of the data.

Each image requires about 2 gigabytes of storage and exposure times will be 30 to 60 seconds (good enough to record objects down to apparent magnitude 22), with an additional minute or so used for computer processing. Since images will be taken on a continuous basis, it is expected that 10 Terabytes of data will be acquired by PS4 every night. Comparing against a database of known unvarying objects compiled from earlier observations will yield objects of interest: anything that has changed brightness and/or position for any reason.  As of June 30/10 University of Hawaii in Honolulu received an $8.4 million contract modification under the PanSTARRS multi-year program to develop and deploy a telescope data management system for the project. At this time, all funds have been committed (FA9451-06-2-0338; P00008)

The very large field of view of the telescopes and the short exposure times enable approximately 6000 square degrees of sky to be imaged every night. The entire sky is 4π [[steradian]]s, or 4π × (180/π)² ≈ 41,253.0 square degrees, of which about 30,000 square degrees are visible from Hawaii, which means that the entire sky can be imaged in a period of 40 hours (or about 10 hours per night on four days). Given the need to avoid times when the [[Moon]] is bright, this means that an area equivalent to the entire sky will be surveyed four times a month, which is entirely unprecedented. By the end of its initial three-year mission in April 2014, PS1 had imaged the sky 12 times in each of 5 filters (g,r,i,z,y).

Pan-STARRS is currently mostly funded by a grant from the NASA [[Near Earth Object]] Observations program. It therefore spends 90% of its observing time in dedicated searches for Near Earth Objects.

Systematically surveying the entire sky on a continuous basis is an unprecedented project and is expected to produce a dramatically larger number of discoveries of various types of celestial objects. For instance, the current leading asteroid discovery survey, the [[Mount Lemmon Survey]],{{efn|Mt. Lemmon Survey (G96) is a part of [[Catalina Sky Survey]], another two parts are [[Siding Spring Survey]] (E12) and Catalina Sky Survey (703) itself.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minorplanetcenter.org/iau/lists/YearlyBreakdown.html |title=Summary of PHA and NEA Discoveries by Discoverers |publisher=IAU Minor Planet Center |access-date=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; reaches an [[apparent magnitude]] of 21.5 [[UBV photometric system|V]] and concentrates its searches mostly near the [[ecliptic]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://scully.cfa.harvard.edu/~cgi/SkyCoverage.html |title=Sky Coverage Plots |publisher=IAU Minor Planet Center |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709013401/http://scully.cfa.harvard.edu/~cgi/SkyCoverage.html |archive-date=2007-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2017}} Pan-STARRS will go 3 magnitudes fainter and cover the entire sky visible from Hawaii.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} The ongoing survey will also complement the efforts to map the infrared sky by the NASA [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer|WISE orbital telescope]], with the results of one survey complementing and extending the other.

=== Military limitations ===
According to Defense Industry Daily&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/8M-for-Astronomy-Asteroid-Assessment-04828 |title=PanSTARRS: Astronomy &amp; Asteroid Assessment |date=30 June 2010 |website=Defense Industry Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; significant limitations were put on the PS1 survey to avoid recording sensitive objects. [[Streak detection]] software (known as "Magic") was used to censor pixels containing information about satellites in the image.  Early versions of this software were immature, leaving a filling factor of 68% of the full field of view (which figure includes gaps between the detectors), but by March 2010 this had improved to 76%, a small reduction from the approximately 80% available. At the end of 2011, the USAF completely eliminated the masking requirement (for all images, past and future). Thus, with the exception of a few non-functioning OTA cells, the entire field of view can be used.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

=== Solar System ===
[[File:14060-Asteroid-P2013R3-Disintegration-20140306.jpg|thumb|right|upright=2|Disintegration of main-belt comet [[Main-belt comet#P/2013 R3|P/2013 R3]] observed by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (6 March 2014).&lt;ref name="NASA-20140306"&gt;{{cite press release |title=NASA's Hubble Telescope Witnesses Asteroid's Mysterious Disintegration |url=http://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/march/nasas-hubble-telescope-witnesses-asteroids-mysterious-disintegration-1 |date=6 March 2014 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=6 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In addition to the large number of expected discoveries in the [[asteroid belt]], Pan-STARRS is expected to detect at least 100,000 [[Jupiter trojan]]s (compared to 2900 known as of end-2008); at least 20,000 [[Kuiper belt]] objects (compared to 800 known as of mid-2005); thousands of trojan asteroids of Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune (currently eight [[Neptune trojan]]s are known,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minorplanetcenter.org/iau/lists/NeptuneTrojans.html |title=List Of Neptune Trojans |publisher=IAU Minor Planet Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; none for Saturn, and one for Uranus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minorplanetcenter.org/iau/lists/NeptuneTrojans.html |title=List Of Uranus Trojans |publisher=IAU Minor Planet Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;); and large numbers of [[Centaur (minor planet)|centaur]]s and [[comet]]s.

Apart from dramatically adding to the number of known Solar System objects, Pan-STARRS will remove or mitigate the observational bias inherent in many current surveys. For instance, among currently known objects there is a bias favoring low orbital [[inclination]], and thus an object such as {{dp|Makemake}} escaped detection until recently despite its bright apparent magnitude of 17, which is not much fainter than [[Pluto]]. Also, among currently known comets, there is a bias favoring those with short [[perihelion]] distances. Reducing the effects of this observational bias will enable a more complete picture of Solar System dynamics. For instance, it is expected that the number of Jupiter trojans larger than 1&amp;nbsp;km may in fact roughly match the number of asteroid-belt objects, although the currently known population of the latter is several orders of magnitude larger. Pan-STARRS data will elegantly complement the WISE (infrared) survey. WISE infrared images will permit an estimate of size for asteroids and trojan objects tracked over longer periods of time by Pan-STARRS.

In 2017, Pan-STARRS detected the first known [[Interstellar comet|interstellar object]], [[1I/ʻOumuamua|1I/2017 U1 ‘Oumuamua]], passing through the Solar System.&lt;ref name="arstechnica"/&gt; During the formation of a planetary system, it is thought that a very large number of objects are ejected due to gravitational interactions with planets (as many as 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; such objects in the case of the Solar System). Objects ejected from planetary systems of other stars might plausibly be throughout the Milky Way and some may pass through the Solar System.

Pan-STARRS may detect collisions involving small asteroids. These are quite rare and none have yet been observed, but with a dramatic increase in the number of asteroids discovered it is expected from statistical considerations that some collision events may be observed.

=== Beyond the Solar System ===
It is expected that Pan-STARRS will discover an extremely large number of [[variable star]]s, including such stars in other nearby [[galaxy|galaxies]]; in fact, this may lead to the discovery of hitherto unknown [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]]. In discovering a large number of [[Cepheid variable]]s and [[eclipsing binary]] stars, it will help determine distances to nearby galaxies with greater precision. It is expected to discover a large number of Type Ia [[supernova]]e in other galaxies, which are important in studying the effects of [[dark energy]], and also optical afterglows of [[gamma ray burst]]s.

Because very young stars (such as [[T Tauri star]]s) are usually variable, Pan-STARRS should discover a large number of these and improve our understanding of them. It is also expected that Pan-STARRS may discover a large number of [[extrasolar planet]]s by observing their [[astronomical transit|transits]] across their parent stars, as well as [[gravitational microlensing]] events.

Pan-STARRS will also measure [[proper motion]] and [[parallax]] and should thereby discover a large number of [[brown dwarf]]s and [[white dwarf]]s and other nearby faint objects, and it should be able to conduct a complete census of all stars within 100 [[parsec]]s of the [[Sun]]. Prior proper motion and parallax surveys often did not detect faint objects such as the recently discovered [[Teegarden's star]], which are too faint for projects such as [[Hipparcos]].

Also, by identifying stars with large parallax but very small proper motion for follow-up [[radial velocity]] measurements, Pan-STARRS may even be able to permit the detection of hypothetical [[Nemesis (hypothetical star)|Nemesis]]-type objects if these actually exist.

The '''''Patriots'' novel series''' is a five-novel series by [[survivalist]] novelist and former [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] officer and [[blog]]ger, [[James Wesley Rawles]]. It is followed by his ''Counter-Caliphate Chronicles'' novel series.

'''''Patriots: A Novel of Survival in the Coming Collapse''''', the first book in the series, was first distributed as [[shareware]] in 1995 and first published in paperback in [[1998 in literature|1998]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/the-art-of-survival-essential-skills-for-the-postapocalyptic-world-1666084.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Revealed: The art of survival | date=2009-04-09 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was updated and re-published in paperback 2009, and then in hardback in 2012. In one week of April 2009, shortly after its release, it was ranked #6 in Amazon.com's overall book sales rankings, which was attributed by the [[Library Journal]] to the book's appeal to "a small but vociferous group of people concerned with [[survivalism]]".&lt;ref name="Library Journal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6651539.html |title=Survivalist Novel Patriots Rates High in Amazon, Not Libraries |publisher=Library Journal |date=2009-04-14 |accessdate=2010-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425071958/http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6651539.html |archivedate=2009-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Set in the near future midst [[hyperinflation]] and a catastrophic global [[economic collapse]], ''Patriots'' tells the story of a group of [[survivalist]]s that flee riots and chaos in metropolitan [[Chicago]] to a [[Retreat (survivalism)|survivalist retreat]] that they have prepared near [[Bovill, Idaho]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/04/20/survival.feat/index.html#cnnSTCText | work=CNN | title=Survivalists get ready for meltdown - CNN.com | date=2008-05-02 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

The first novel is based on a 19-chapter draft that Rawles wrote in 1990, and first distributed as shareware, under the title ''The Gray Nineties''.&lt;ref&gt;On-line Underground. ''The Spokesman-Review'' (Spokane). Dec. 3, 1995, page H7&lt;/ref&gt;  It was later expanded to 27 chapters and retitled ''Triple Ought'', and then 33 chapters, under the title ''TEOTWAWKI:  The End of the World as We Know It''.&lt;ref&gt;How America Uses The Net (Subsection Profile: [James Rawles] The Y2K Survivalist) ''Yahoo! Internet Life'' magazine, September 1999, p. 108-109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some store food, gold, guns in case Y2K brings chaos. ''The Sacramento Bee'', December 29, 1998, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the rights to the novel were purchased by Huntington House Publishers, a small [[Christian]] publishing firm in [[Lafayette, Louisiana]]. They abridged the book to 31 chapters and re-titled it ''Patriots: Surviving the Coming Collapse''. This was the publisher's best-selling title from November 1998 to January 2005.&lt;ref name="rawles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawles.to/patriots.htm |title=Patriots, TEOTWAWKI, and Pulling Through, by James Wesley, Rawles |publisher=Rawles.to |date= |accessdate=2012-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2005, Huntington House went out of business, and the copyright reverted to the author. In November 2006, responding to pent-up market demand, Rawles self-published a restored 33 chapter edition of the novel, through [[XLibris]], a [[vanity press]]. ''Patriots'' was the best-selling title for XLibris from late 2006 to early 2009.  In late 2008, the rights to the novel were purchased by Ulysses Press of [[Berkeley, California]]. After updating the novel and adding both a glossary and an index, in April 2009 Ulysses Press released the 33 chapter edition under the new title  ''Patriots: A Novel of Survival in the Coming Collapse''.

===Setting===
Much of ''Patriots'' takes place in the [[Intermountain west]], specifically in the [[Palouse Hills]] region, in and around [[Moscow, Idaho]].

==Reception==
Critical reception for the various releases of the book has been generally positive, gaining a [[cult following]] among the survivalist community and a positive review from the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/s/Rub48A3E114E72543C4938ADBB2DCEE2108/Doc~E340491DBEDE94C4E9DF01F07365C1827~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html |title=Amerikanischer Bestseller: "Patriots": Wie das Ende unserer Welt zu überleben ist - Rezensionen |publisher=FAZ |date= |accessdate=2012-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reviewer for the ''Tennessean'' newspaper called the novel a "combination military thriller and how-to survivalist guide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Survivalist author has end in sight|url=http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2009904280358|accessdate=13 October 2012|newspaper=The Tennessean|date=Apr 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time the book has gained a larger following, with Rawles speculating that the ongoing [[financial crisis]] accounted for the book's popularity among a wider readership traditionally not interested in survivalist themes. Sara Nelson of ''The Daily Beast'' referred to the novel as "The Most Dangerous Novel in America."&lt;ref name="beast"&gt;{{cite web|author=Sara Nelson |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-04-15/the-most-dangerous-novel-in-america/full/ |title=The Most Dangerous Novel in America? |publisher=''The Daily Beast'' |date=2009-04-15 |accessdate=2012-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kirkus Review described the series as "long on details about guns, survival techniques and military capabilities and short on the suspense".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/james-wesley-rawles/expatriates/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations==
The first translation of ''Patriots'' was released in May, 2012. This was a Spanish edition, titled ''Patriotas''.  It was translated by Ernesto Rubio Garcia and published by La Factoria De Ideas, in Madrid, Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isbndb.com/d/book/patriotas_patriots.html|title=Patriotas / Patriots - ISBNdb.com - Book Info|author=2002-2012 Andrew Maltsev, 2012-2013 Derek J.

==Sequels==
Rawles authored four sequels in the ''Patriots'' series. The first two sequels were published by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]: ''Survivors: A Novel of the Coming Collapse'' in 2011 and ''Founders: A Novel of the Coming Collapse'' in 2012.  Both of these sequels were also been produced as audiobooks (by [[Brilliance Audio]]), and as e-books. In 2013, [[E.P. Dutton]] released the fourth novel in the series, titled ''Expatriates''.  This sequel is set primarily in Australia, the Philippines, and Tavares, Florida. This was followed in 2014 by a fourth sequel, titled ''Liberators: A Novel of the Coming Global Collapse''. It was released on October 21, 2014.

Sales for the sequels were strong, with ''Survivors'',  ''Founders'' and ''Expatriates'' all achieving places on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]].&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hardcover Fiction, October 14, 2012|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2012-10-14/hardcover-fiction/list.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=13 October 2012|first=Gregory|last=Cowles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor |first=Ihsan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2011-10-23/hardcover-fiction/list.html |title=Best Sellers - The New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
===Survivors: A Novel of the Coming Collapse===
[[File:Survivors front cover.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Cover of the first edition of ''Survivors''.]]

Much of '''''Survivors: A Novel of the Coming Collapse''''' takes place in the [[Four Corners]] region, specifically in and around Bloomfield and Farmington, [[New Mexico]], although the book's climax takes place in and near [[Prescott, Arizona]] and several sub-plots take place as far away as [[Afghanistan]]. The cover artwork was created by Tony Mauro, Jr.

On its release day, October 4, 2011, ''Survivors''  rose to #2 in Amazon's overall book sales ranks and #1 in their action-adventure category.  On October 23, 2011, it was listed at #3 in the [[New York Times bestseller list]] in the fiction hardback category.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; Rawles and ''Survivors'' were the centerpiece of a [[Vancouver Sun]] article by Kim Murphy about the [[American Redoubt]] movement that was run by dozens of newspapers, including the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Kim. "Survivalists head for the hills; Author James Wesley Rawles looks to the future and sees trouble. He's urging Americans to prepare". ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'' [Vancouver, B.C] 03 Mar 2012: C.1. A reprint of the same [http://articles.latimes.com/2012/feb/08/nation/la-na-american-redoubt-20120209 LA Times] (Feb. 8, 2012) article by Kim Murphy.&lt;/ref&gt; A review in ''The New American'' magazine was positive, summarizing: "In short, Rawles' Survivors is well worth reading; astute readers may find themselves making notes of passages pertaining to survival planning which will be worth returning to once one has finished reading the novel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewamerican.com/reviews/books/item/6471-james-wesley-rawles-new-book-survivors |title=James Wesley Rawles' New Book: "Survivors" |website=Thenewamerican.com |date=2011-11-07 |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marvin Olasky]] of ''[[World (magazine)]]'' called ''Survivors'' "...not as well-written as some articles Rawles has penned"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldmag.com/2012/03/apocalypse_when |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-10-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305013057/http://www.worldmag.com/2012/03/apocalypse_when |archive-date=2016-03-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rawles uses an unusual contemporaneous approach to writing sequels. Rather than the traditional formula of following the same group of characters farther into the future, he instead uses a [[novel sequence]] method that portrays different characters in different geographic regions, but in the same near-future timeframe as in ''Patriots.'' In his Introductory note to  ''Survivors'', Rawles stated: "Unlike most novel sequels, the storyline of ''Survivors'' is contemporaneous with the events described in my previously-published novel ''Patriots''.  Thus, there is no need to read it first (or subsequently), but you'll likely find it entertaining."

The first of several translations of ''Survivors'' was released in May 2014. This was a Spanish edition, titled ''Supervivientes''.  It was translated by Ernesto Rubio Garcia and published by La Factoria De Ideas, in Madrid, Spain. {{ISBN|978-8490182734}}.&lt;ref name="lafactoriadeideas.es"/&gt; A Kindle edition in Spanish was also released in May, 2014. Additional translations into French, German, Russian, Bulgarian, Portuguese, and Korean are planned.

===Founders: A Novel of the Coming Collapse===
[[File:James Wesley Rawles Founders Book cover.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Cover of the first edition of ''Founders''.]]

'''''Founders: A Novel of the Coming Collapse''''' is a 2012 [[New York Times Best Seller|''New York Times'' best-selling]] novel by author [[James Wesley Rawles]] and is a sequel to ''Survivors: A Novel of the Coming Collapse''.&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt; The novel was released on September 25, 2012, by Atria Books. The book peaked at #4 in Amazon's overall book sales ranks, on its release day. The book premiered on the New York Times Bestsellers list at #11, but dropped to #27 a week later.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/books/review/inside-the-list.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | first=Gregory | last=Cowles | title=Inside the List | date=2012-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Founders: A Novel of the Coming Collapse'' is set primarily in [[Kentucky]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Montana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ashevilledailyplanet.com/news/2828-collapse-coming-survival-guru-tailor-tips-to-carolinians|title=Collapse coming? Survival guru tailor tips to Carolinians|author=John North|work=Asheville Daily Planet}}&lt;/ref&gt; It details how U.S. Army Captain Andy Laine infiltrates the Provisional Government's New Army headquartered at [[Fort Knox]] in the midst of a War of Resistance. It also details the cross-country trek of Ken and Terry Layton, and introduces a new character: Joshua Watanabe, a U.S. Air Force NCO, stationed at [[Malmstrom Air Force Base]], in [[Montana]]. The cover artwork was created by Tony Mauro, Jr.

''Founders''&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt; was released on September 25, 2012, by Atria Books.  The book premiered on the New York Times Bestsellers list at #11, but dropped to #27 a week later.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

In his brief review of ''Founders'', Gregory Cowles of the influential ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' poked fun at the comma in Rawles's name, but granted: "Rawles is a well-known survivalist, and he's surely the only writer on this list whose fans frequently ask him how best to stockpile food (it depends on which food) or whether to favor bullets over gold during the total collapse of civilization ("You can't defend yourself near as well with a Krugerrand")."&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt;

===Expatriates: A Novel of the Coming Global Collapse===
[[File:ExpatriatesBookCover.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Cover of the first edition of ''Expatriates''.]]

The third sequel in the Patriots series is entitled ''Expatriates: A Novel of the Coming Global Collapse'' ({{ISBN|9780525953906}}). It was written under contract for [[E.P. Dutton]]. The book was released on October 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130314020444/http://www.survivalblog.com/2013/03/notes-from-jwr-632.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; It is set "primarily in central Florida, the Philippines, and northern Australia."  The cover artwork was created by Tony Mauro, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120703150511/http://www.survivalblog.com/2012/07/notes-from-jwr-479.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; The audio book was narrated by Eric G. Dove. The publisher's web page summarizes the storyline: "When the United States suffers a major socioeconomic collapse, a power vacuum sweeps the globe. A newly radicalized Islamic government rises to power in Indonesia, invades the Philippines, East Timor, Papua New Guinea, and finally northern Australia. No longer protected by American military interests, Australia must repel an invasion alone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780525953906,00.html|title=Expatriates by James Wesley, Rawles - Penguin Books USA|author=James Wesley, Rawles|work=Penguin Books USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberators: A Novel of the Coming Global Collapse===

[[Publishers Weekly]] called ''Liberators''  the  "rousing fifth after-the-apocalypse thriller [installment in the novel series]" and also mentioned that "Supporters of the 'prepper' movement…will lap up every detail."&lt;ref&gt;Publishers Weekly, August 25, 2014, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-525-95391-3|title=Fiction Book Review: Liberators: A Novel of the Coming Global Collapse by James Wesley, Rawles.

===Counter-Caliphate Chronicles novel series===
Rawles followed ''Patriots'' series with the ''Counter-Caliphate Chronicles'' novel series. On December 1, 2015, Rawles released the novel ''Land of Promise'', the first book in the ''Counter-Caliphate Chronicles'' novel series. This [[science fiction]] novel is a geopolitical thriller that is a considerable departure from his previous ''Patriots'' [[thriller novel]] series.  Set in the late 2130s,  ''Land of Promise'' fictionally describes the world under the economic and military domination of a Global Islamic Caliphate, brought about by a fictional new branch of Islam, called The Thirdists.  The novel also describes the establishment of a Christian nation of refuge called The Ilemi Republic, in East Africa.  It is the first release from Liberty Paradigm Publishing, a publishing venture launched by Rawles in partnership with his literary agent Robert Gottlieb of Trident Media Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/r/james-wesley-rawles/land-of-promise.htm |title=Land of Promise (Counter-Caliphate Chronicles, book 1) |author=James Wesley Rawles |website=Fantasticfiction.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quotes===
"It's in our fallen, sinful nature for tyrants to rise up in every nation. And unfortunately, it's also in our nature that the vast majority in every nation is either too stupid or too apathetic to do anything about it until the tyrants have put up their barbed wire and spilled a lot of blood." - Protagonist wife Mary Gray, in ''Patriots''

'''Prajapati''' ([[IAST]]: ''{{IAST|Prajāpati-Rajjan or Rajanya}}'', "lord of creation and protector") is a [[Vedas|Vedic]] deity of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p311"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams2008p234"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p518"&gt;{{cite book|author=James G.

==Etymology==
Prajapati ([[Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa|प्रजापति}}) is a compound of "praja" (creation, procreative powers) and "pati" (lord, master).&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Gonda]] (1982), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1062566 The Popular Prajāpati], History of Religions, Vol. 22, No. 2 (Nov., 1982), University of Chicago Press, pp. 137-141&lt;/ref&gt; The term means "lord of creatures",&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p311"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams2008p234"/&gt; or "lord of all born beings".&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p332"/&gt; In the later Vedic texts, Prajapati is a distinct Vedic deity, but whose significance diminishes.&lt;ref name="Williams2008p234"/&gt; Later, the term is synonymous with other gods, particularly Brahma or Vishnu or Shiva.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p311"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p518"/&gt; Still later, the term evolves to mean any divine, semi-divine or human sages who create something new.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James G. Lochtefeld|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: N-Z|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6FsB3psOTIC |year=2002|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-3180-4|pages=169, 518–519}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p311"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams2008p234"/&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:An attempt to depict the creative activities of Prajapati.jpg|thumb|"An attempt to depict the creative activities of Prajapati", a steel engraving from the 1850s.]]
The origins of Prajapati are unclear. He appears late in the Vedic layer of texts, and the hymns that mention him provide different cosmological theories in different chapters.&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p518"/&gt; He is missing from the [[Samhita]] layer of Vedic literature, conceived in the [[Brahmana]] layer, states [[Jan Gonda]].&lt;ref name="Gonda1986p2"/&gt; Prajapati is younger than [[Savitr]], and the word was originally an epithet for the sun.&lt;ref name=gonda130&gt;[[Jan Gonda]] (1982), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1062566 The Popular Prajāpati], History of Religions, Vol. 22, No. 2 (Nov., 1982), University of Chicago Press, pp. 129-130&lt;/ref&gt; His profile gradually rises in the Vedas, peaking within the [[Brahmana]]s.&lt;ref name="Gonda1986p2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jan Gonda|title=Prajāpatiʼs rise to higher rank |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2OIUAAAAIAAJ |year=1986|publisher=BRILL Academic |isbn=90-04-07734-0|pages=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars such as Renou, Keith and Bhattacharji posit Prajapati originated as an abstract or semi-abstract deity in the later Vedic milieu as speculations evolved from the archaic to more learned speculations.&lt;ref name=gonda130/&gt;

===Indo-European===
A possible connection between Prajapati (and related figures in Indian tradition) and the [[Phanes|Prōtogonos]] ({{lang-grc|Πρωτογόνος}}, literally "first-born") of the Greek [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic tradition]] has been proposed:&lt;ref&gt;Martin West, ''Early Greek Philosophy and the Orient''. Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1971: 28-34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=alsobrook20&gt;Kate Alsobrook (2008), "The Beginning of Time: Vedic and Orphic Theogonies and Poetics". M.A. Thesis, Reviewers: James Sickinger, Kathleen Erndl, John Marincola and Svetla Slaveva-Griffin, Florida State University, pages 20, 1-5, 24-25, 40-44&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|
Protogonos is the [[Orpheus|Orphic]] equivalent of Vedic Prajapati in several ways: he is the first god born from a cosmic egg, he is the creator of the universe, and in the figure of [[Dionysus]]— a direct descendant of Protogonos—worshippers participate in his death and rebirth.
|Kate Alsobrook|''The Beginning of Time: Vedic and Orphic Theogonies and Poetics''&lt;ref name=alsobrook20/&gt;}}

According to Robert Graves, the name of /PRA-JĀ[N]-pati/ ('progeny-potentate') is etymologically equivalent to that of the oracular god at [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]] (according to Makrobios&lt;ref&gt;Robert Graves : ''The Greek Myths''. 1955. vol. 1, p. 31, sec. 2.2&lt;/ref&gt;), namely /prōtogonos/.{{cn|date=July 2017}} The cosmic egg concept linked to Prajapati and Protogonos is common in many parts of the world, states David Leeming, which appears in later Orphic cult in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Adams Leeming|title=Creation Myths of the World: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9I62BcuPxfYC |year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-174-9|pages=313–314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Texts==
Prajapati is described in many ways and inconsistently in Hindu texts, both in the Vedas and in the post-Vedic texts. These range from being the creator god to being same as one of the following: [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]], [[Agni]], [[Indra]], [[Vishvakarma]], [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]], [[Kapila]] and many others.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p311"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sukumari Bhattacharji |year= 2007 |title=The Indian Theogony |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lDc9AAAAIAAJ |publisher = Cambridge University Press|pages= 322–330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vedas===
His role varies within the Vedic texts such as being one who created heaven and earth, all of water and beings, the chief, the father of gods, the creator of ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]]'' and ''[[asura]]s'', the cosmic egg and the [[Purusha]] (spirit).&lt;ref name="Williams2008p234"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p332"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Constance Jones|author2=James D. Ryan|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OgMmceadQ3gC  |year=2006|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-7564-5|page=332}}&lt;/ref&gt; His role peaked in the Brahmanas layer of Vedic text, then declined to being a group of helpers in the creation process.&lt;ref name="Williams2008p234"/&gt; In some Brahmana texts, his role remains ambiguous since he co-creates with the powers with goddess Vac (sound).&lt;ref name="Kinsley1988p12"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Kinsley|title=Hindu Goddesses: Visions of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HzldwMHeS6IC|year=1988|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-90883-3|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Rigveda]]'', Prajapati appears as an epithet for Savitr, Soma, Agni and Indra, who are all praised as equal, same and lord of creatures.&lt;ref name= Bhattacharji322&gt;{{cite book|author=Sukumari Bhattacharji |year= 2007 |title=The Indian Theogony |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lDc9AAAAIAAJ |publisher = Cambridge University Press|pages= 322–323}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, in hymn 10.121 of the ''Rigveda'', is described ''Hiranyagarbha'' (golden embryo) that was born from the waters containing everything, which produced Prajapati. It then created ''manah'' (mind), ''kama'' (desire) and ''tapas'' (heat). However, this Prajapati is a metaphor, one of many [[Hindu cosmology]] theories, and there is no supreme deity in the ''Rigveda''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gavin D. Flood|title=An Introduction to Hinduism |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KpIWhKnYmF0C |year=1996 |publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn= 978-0-521-43878-0|pages= 45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry White Wallis|title=The Cosmology of the Ṛigveda: An Essay|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9xBCAAAAIAAJ|year= 1887|publisher= Williams and Norgate|page=61–73, 117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Laurie L.

In the ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]'', embedded inside the ''[[Yajurveda]]'', Prajapati emanated from Purusha (cosmic spirit) and Prajapati co-creates the world with goddess of Language.&lt;ref name="WilkeMoebus2011p414"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Annette Wilke|author2=Oliver Moebus|title=Sound and Communication: An Aesthetic Cultural History of Sanskrit Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9wmYz_OtZ_gC |year=2011|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-024003-0|pages=414–416}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes the "golden cosmic egg" mythology, wherein Prajapati is stated to be born from a golden egg in primeval sea after the egg was incubated for a year. His sounds became the sky, the earth and the seasons. When he inhaled, he created the devas (gods), fire and light. When he exhaled, he created the asuras (demons) and darkness. Then, together with goddess of Language, he created all beings and time.&lt;ref name="Leeming2010p144"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Adams Leeming|title=Creation Myths of the World: An Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9I62BcuPxfYC |year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-174-9|pages=144–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Chapter 10 of the ''Shatapatha Brahmana'', as well as chapter 13 of ''Pancavimsa Brahmana'', is presented another theory wherein he (Prajapati) is a mother, becomes self-pregnant with all living creatures self-generated, evil ''Mrtyu'' seizes these beings within his womb, but because these beings are part of the eternal Prajapati, they desire to live long like him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jan Gonda|title=Prajāpatiʼs rise to higher rank |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2OIUAAAAIAAJ |year= 1986|publisher= BRILL Academic |isbn=90-04-07734-0|pages=5, 14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sukumari Bhattacharji |year= 2007 |title=The Indian Theogony |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lDc9AAAAIAAJ |publisher = Cambridge University Press|pages= 324–325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Aitareya Brahmana'' offers a different myth, wherein Prajapati having created the gods, metamorphosed into a stag and approached his daughter dawn who was in the form of a doe, to produce other earthly beings. The gods were horrified by the incest, and joined forces to produce angry destructive [[Rudra]] to punish Prajapati for "doing what is not done". Prajapati was killed by Rudra.&lt;ref name="Leeming2010p144"/&gt; The ''Kausitaki Brahmana'' offers a yet another myth, wherein Prajapati created from his own self fire, sun, moon, wind and feminine dawn. The first four saw dawn and released their seeds, which became existence (''Bhava'').&lt;ref name="Leeming2010p144"/&gt; 

In section 2.266 of Jaiminiya Brahmana, Prajapati is presented as a spiritual teacher. His student [[Varuna]] lives with him for 100 years, studying the art and duties of being the "father-like king of gods".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jan Gonda|title=Prajāpatiʼs rise to higher rank |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2OIUAAAAIAAJ |year= 1986|publisher= BRILL Academic |isbn=90-04-07734-0|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sukumari Bhattacharji |year= 2007 |title=The Indian Theogony |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lDc9AAAAIAAJ |publisher = Cambridge University Press|pages= 326–327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upanishads===
Prajapati appears in early Upanishads, among the most influential texts in Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Olivelle (2014), The Early Upanisads, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195352429}}, pages 3, 279-281; Quote: "Even though theoretically the whole of vedic corpus is accepted as revealed truth [shruti], in reality it is the Upanishads that have continued to influence the life and thought of the various religious traditions that we have come to call Hindu. Upanishads are the scriptures par excellence of Hinduism".&lt;/ref&gt; He is described in the Upanishads in diverse ways. For example, in different Upanishads, he is presented as the personification of creative power after Brahman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Deussen|title=Sixty Upaniṣads of the Veda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8mSpQo9q-tIC|year=1980|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1468-4|pages=19–21, 205, 240, 350, 510, 544}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same as the wandering eternal soul,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Deussen|title=Sixty Upaniṣads of the Veda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8mSpQo9q-tIC|year=1980|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1468-4|page=495}}&lt;/ref&gt; as symbolism for unmanifest obscure first born,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Deussen|title=Sixty Upaniṣads of the Veda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8mSpQo9q-tIC|year=1980|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1468-4|pages=85, 96-97, 252}}&lt;/ref&gt; as manifest procreative sexual powers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Deussen|title=Sixty Upaniṣads of the Veda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8mSpQo9q-tIC|year=1980|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1468-4|pages=53-56, 471, 534, 540}}&lt;/ref&gt; the knower particularly of [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (soul, self),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Deussen|title=Sixty Upaniṣads of the Veda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8mSpQo9q-tIC|year=1980|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1468-4|page=371}}&lt;/ref&gt; a spiritual teacher that is within each person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Deussen|title=Sixty Upaniṣads of the Veda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8mSpQo9q-tIC|year=1980|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1468-4|pages=21, 106, 198-205, 263, 508, 544}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Klaus G.

{{Quote|
The self (atman) that is free from evils,
free from old age and death,
free from sorrow, free from hunger and thirst;
the self whose desires and intentions are real –
that is the self that you should try to discover,
that is the self that you should seek to perceive.
When someone discovers that self and perceives it,
he obtains all the worlds, and all his desires are fulfilled,
so said Prajapati.

In the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', Brahma is declared to be a Prajapati who creates many males and females, and imbues them with desire and anger, the former to drive them into reproducing themselves and the latter to prevent them from being like gods.&lt;ref name="Leeming2010p144"/&gt; Other chapters of the epics and Puranas declare Shiva or Vishnu to be Prajapati.&lt;ref name= Bhattacharji322/&gt;

The ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' uses the epithet Prajapati to describe [[Krishna]], along with many other epithets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Winthrop Sargeant|editor=Christopher Key Chapple|title=The Bhagavad Gita: Twenty-fifth–Anniversary Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=COuy5CDAqt4C |year=2010|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-4384-2840-6|pages=37, 167, 491 (verse 11.39)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Grhyasutra]]s include Prajapati as among the deities invoked during wedding ceremonies and prayed to for blessings of prosperous progeny, and harmony between husband and wife.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Gonda]] (1982), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1062566 The Popular Prajāpati], History of Religions, Vol. 22, No. 2 (Nov., 1982), University of Chicago Press, pp. 131-132&lt;/ref&gt;

Prajapati is identified with  the personifications of Time, Fire, the Sun, etc. He is also identified with various mythical progenitors, especially (Manu Smrti 1.34) the ten lords of created beings first created by Brahmā, the Prajapatis Marichi, Atri, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Vasishtha, [[Prachetas]] or Daksha, Bhrigu, Nārada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hindu Mythology|last=Wilkins|first=W.J.|page=369|publisher=D.K. Printworld (P) Limited|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-246-0234-4|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Puranas]], there are groups of Prajapati called ''Prajapatayah'' who were [[rishi]]s (sages) or "grandfathers" from whom all of humanity resulted, followed by Prajapatis list that widely varies in number and name between different texts.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p311"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC |year=2010 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-341421-6|page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams2008p234"&gt;{{cite book|author=George M. Williams|title=Handbook of Hindu Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N7LOZfwCDpEC |year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533261-2|pages=234–235 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to George Williams, the inconsistent, varying and evolving Prajapati concept in Hindu mythology reflects the diverse [[Hindu cosmology]].&lt;ref name="Williams2008p234"/&gt;

The ''Mahabharata'' and the genre of Puranas call various gods and sages as Prajapati. Some illustrations, states Roshen Dalal, include Agni, Bharata, Shashabindu, Shukra, Havirdhaman, Indra, Kapila, Kshupa, Prithu-Vainya, Soma, Svishtakrit, Tvashtr, Vishvakarma and Virana.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p311"/&gt;

== Prajapatis ==
In the medieval era texts of Hinduism, Prajapati refers to legendary agents of creation, working as gods or sages, who appear in every cycle of creation-maintenance-destruction (''manvantara''). Their numbers vary between seven, ten, sixteen or twenty-one.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p311"/&gt; 
*A list of twenty one includes Rudra, Manu, Daksha, Bhrigu, Dharma, Tapa, Yama, Marici, Angiras, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Vasishtha, Parameshti, Surya, Chandra, Kardama, Krodha and Vikrita.&lt;ref name="Williams2008p234"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p311"/&gt; 
*A list of sixteen found in the ''Ramayana'' includes Angiras, Arishtanemi, Atri, Daksha, Kardama, Kashyapa, Kratu, Marichi, Prachetas, Pulaha, Pulastya, Samshraya, Shesha, Sthanu, Vikrita, Vivasvan.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p311"/&gt;
*A list of ten includes Marichi, Angiras, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Vasishtha, Daksha (or Prachetas), Bhrigu and Narada.&lt;ref name=" Dalal2010p311"/&gt;

Their creative role varies. Pulaha, for example, is the mythical mind-born son of Brahma and a great rishi. As one of the Prajapatis, he helps create living wildlife such as lions, tigers, bears, wolves, as well mythical beasts such as kimpurushas and shalabhas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal|title= Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC |year=2010 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-341421-6|page=316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Balinese Hinduism== 
Hindu temples in Bali Indonesia called ''Pura Prajapati'', also called ''Pura Mrajapati'', are common. They are most associated with funeral rituals and the [[Ngaben]] (cremation) ceremony for the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David J.

A '''quark star''' is a hypothetical type of [[compact star|compact]] [[exotic star]], where extremely high temperature and pressure has forced [[Nucleon|nuclear particles]] to form a continuous [[state of matter]] that consists primarily of free [[quark]]s.

It is well known that [[star#Massive stars|massive]] [[stars]] can collapse to form [[neutron stars]], under extreme temperatures and pressures. In simple terms, neutrons usually have space separating them due to [[degeneracy pressure]] keeping them apart. Under extreme conditions such as a neutron star, the pressure separating nucleons is overwhelmed by gravity, and the separation between them breaks down, causing them to be packed extremely densely and form an immensely hot and dense state known as [[neutron matter]], where they are only held apart by the [[strong interaction]]. Because these neutrons are made of quarks, it is hypothesized that under even more extreme conditions, the degeneracy pressure keeping the quarks apart within the neutrons might break down in much the same way, creating an ultra-dense [[Phase (matter)|phase]] of [[degenerate matter]] based on densely packed quarks. This is seen as plausible, but is very hard to prove, as scientists cannot easily create the conditions needed to investigate the properties of quark matter, so it is [[List of unsolved problems in physics|unknown]] whether this actually occurs.

If quark stars can form, then the most likely place to find quark star matter would be inside [[neutron star]]s that exceed the internal pressure needed for [[degenerate matter|quark degeneracy]] - the point at which [[neutron]]s (which are formed from quarks bound together) break down into a form of dense [[quark matter]]. They could also form if a [[massive star]] [[core collapse supernova|collapses]] at the end of its life, provided that it is possible for a star to be large enough to collapse beyond a neutron star but not large enough to form a [[black hole]].  However, as scientists are unable so far to explore most properties of quark matter, the exact conditions and nature of quark stars, and their existence, remain hypothetical and unproven. The question whether such stars exist and their exact structure and behavior is actively studied within [[astrophysics]] and [[particle physics]].

If they exist, quark stars would resemble and be easily mistaken for neutron stars: they would form in the death of a massive star in a [[Type II supernova]], they would be extremely dense and small, and possess a very high gravitational field. They would also lack some features of neutron stars, unless they also contained a shell of neutron matter, because free quarks are not expected to have properties matching degenerate neutron matter. For example, they might be radio-silent, or not have typical size, electromagnetic, or temperature measurements, compared to other neutron stars.

The hypothesis about quark stars was first proposed in 1965 by Soviet physicists [[Dmitri Ivanenko|D. D. Ivanenko]] and D. F. Kurdgelaidze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hypothesis concerning quark stars |author= D. D. Ivanenko |author2= D. F. Kurdgelaidze |journal=Astrophysics |volume=1 |issue= 4 |pages=251–252 |date=1965 |bibcode = 1965Ap......1..251I |doi = 10.1007/BF01042830 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Remarks on quark stars |author= D. D. Ivanenko |author2= D. F. Kurdgelaidze |journal=Lettere al Nuovo Cimento |volume=2 |pages=13–16 |date=1969 |bibcode=1969NCimL...2...13I
 |doi=10.1007/BF02753988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their existence has not been confirmed. The [[equation of state]] of [[quark matter]] is uncertain, as is the transition point between neutron-degenerate matter and quark matter. Theoretical uncertainties have precluded making predictions from [[first principles]]. Experimentally, the behaviour of quark matter is being actively studied with particle colliders, but this can only produce very hot (above 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; K) [[quark-gluon plasma]] blobs the size of atomic nuclei, which decay immediately after formation. The conditions inside compact stars with extremely high densities and temperatures well below 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; K can not be recreated artificially, so there are no known methods to produce, store or study "cold" quark matter directly as it would be found inside quark stars. The theory predicts quark matter to possess some peculiar characteristics under these conditions.

==Creation==
It is theorized that when the [[neutron-degenerate matter]], which makes up [[neutron star]]s, is put under sufficient pressure from the star's own [[gravity]] or the initial [[supernova]] creating it, the individual [[neutron]]s break down into their constituent [[quark]]s ([[up quark]]s and [[down quark]]s), forming what is known as [[quark matter]]. This conversion might be confined to the neutron star's center or it might transform the entire star, depending on the physical circumstances. Such a star is known as a quark star.&lt;ref name="Shapiro"&gt;Shapiro and Teukolsky: ''Black Holes, White Dwarfs and Neutron Stars: The Physics of Compact Objects'', Wiley 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blaschke ''et.al'' ''"Physics of neutron star interiors"''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stability and strange quark matter===

Ordinary quark matter consisting of up and down quarks (also referred to as ''u'' and ''d'' quarks) has a very high [[Fermi energy]] compared to ordinary atomic matter and is only stable under extreme temperatures and/or pressures. This suggests that the only stable quark stars will be neutron stars with a quark matter core, while quark stars consisting entirely of ordinary quark matter will be highly unstable and dissolve spontaneously.&lt;ref name='Witten'&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Witten |first1=Edward |title=Cosmic separation of phases |journal=Physical Review D |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=272–285 |date=1984 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.30.272|bibcode = 1984PhRvD..30..272W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Strange matter |author= E. Farhi |author2= R. L. Jaffe |journal=Physical Review D |volume=30 |issue= 11 |pages=2379 |date=1984 |bibcode = 1984PhRvD..30.2379F |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.30.2379 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown that the high Fermi energy making ordinary quark matter unstable at low temperatures and pressures can be lowered substantially by the transformation of a sufficient number of u and d quarks into [[strange quark]]s, as strange quarks are, relatively speaking, a very heavy type of quark particle.&lt;ref name='Witten'/&gt; This kind of quark matter is known specifically as [[strange quark matter]] and it is speculated and subject to current scientific investigation whether it might in fact be stable under the conditions of interstellar space (i.e. near zero external pressure and temperature). If this is the case (known as the Bodmer–[[Edward Witten|Witten]] assumption), quark stars made entirely of quark matter would be stable if they quickly transform into strange quark matter.&lt;ref name=Weber&gt;{{Cite journal |author= Fridolin Weber |display-authors= etal |journal= Proceedings: Strangeness and Quark Matter |title=Strange-matter Stars |date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strange stars===
{{main|Strange star}}
Quark stars made of [[strange quark matter]] are known as strange stars, and they form a subgroup under the quark star category.&lt;ref name=Weber/&gt;

Theoretical investigations have revealed that quark stars might not only be produced from neutron stars and powerful supernovas, they could also be created in the early [[Chronology of the universe#Hadron epoch|cosmic phase separations]] following the [[Big Bang]].&lt;ref name='Witten'/&gt; If these primordial quark stars transform into strange quark matter before the external temperature and pressure conditions of the early Universe makes them unstable, they might turn out stable, if the Bodmer–Witten assumption holds true. Such primordial strange stars could survive to this day.&lt;ref name='Witten'/&gt;

==Characteristics==
Quark stars have some special characteristics that separate them from ordinary neutron stars.

Under the physical conditions found inside neutron stars, with extremely high densities but temperatures well below 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; K, quark matter is predicted to exhibit some peculiar characteristics. It is expected to behave as a [[Fermi liquid]] and enter a so-called color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase of [[color superconductivity]], where "color" refers to the six "charges" exhibited in the [[strong interaction]], instead of the positive and the negative charges in [[electromagnetism]]. At slightly lower densities, corresponding to higher layers closer to the surface of the compact star, the quark matter will behave as a non-CFL quark liquid, a phase that is even more mysterious than CFL and might include color conductivity and/or several additional yet undiscovered phases. None of these extreme conditions can currently be recreated in laboratories so nothing can be inferred about these phases from direct experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Alford, Mark G.|author2=Schmitt, Andreas|author3=Rajagopal, Krishna|author4=Schäfer, Thomas|title=Color superconductivity in dense quark matter|arxiv=0709.4635 |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |volume=80|issue=4 |pages=1455–1515 |year=2008|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.80.1455|bibcode=2008RvMP...80.1455A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the conversion of neutron-degenerate matter to (strange) quark matter is total, a quark star can to some extent be imagined as a single gigantic [[hadron]]. But this "hadron" will be bound by gravity, rather than the [[strong interaction|strong force]] that binds ordinary hadrons.

==Observed overdense neutron stars==
At least under the assumptions mentioned above, the probability of a given neutron star being a quark star is low,{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} so in the Milky Way there would only be a small population of quark stars. If it is correct however, that overdense neutron stars can turn into quark stars, that makes the possible number of quark stars higher than was originally thought, as observers would be looking for the wrong type of star.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Quark stars and strange stars are entirely hypothetical {{As of|2018|lc=on}}, but there are several candidates.

Observations released by the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] on April 10, 2002 detected two possible quark stars, designated [[RX J1856.5-3754]] and [[3C58]], which had previously been thought to be neutron stars. Based on the known laws of physics, the former appeared much smaller and the latter much colder than it should be, suggesting that they are composed of material denser than [[neutron-degenerate matter]]. However, these observations are met with skepticism by researchers who say the results were not conclusive;&lt;ref name="Truemper2004"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Truemper, J. E. | author2 = Burwitz, V. | author3 = Haberl, F. | author4 = Zavlin, V.

Another star, [[XTE J1739-285]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11221?DCMP=NLC-nletter&amp;nsref=dn11221 Fastest spinning star may have exotic heart]&lt;/ref&gt; has been observed by a team led by Philip Kaaret of the [[University of Iowa]] and reported as a possible quark star candidate.

In 2006, Y. L. Yue et al., from [[Peking University]], suggested that [[PSR B0943+10]] may in fact be a low-mass quark star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Y. L. |last=Yue |first2=X.

It was reported in 2008 that observations of supernovae [[SN 2006gy]], [[SN 2005gj]] and [[SN 2005ap]] also suggest the existence of quark stars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://astronomynow.com/080604Secondsupernovaepointtoquarkstars.html Astronomy Now Online – Second Supernovae Point to Quark Stars]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the collapsed core of supernova [[SN 1987A]] may be a quark star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chan |author2=Cheng |author3=Harko |author4=Lau |author5=Lin |author6=Suen |author7=Tian |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/695/1/732 |journal=Astrophysical Journal |title=Could the compact remnant of SN 1987A be a quark star? |volume=695 |issue=1 |pages=732–746 |year=2009 |arxiv=0902.0653|bibcode = 2009ApJ...695..732C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126964.700-quark-star-may-hold-secret-to-early-universe.html Quark star may hold secret to early universe] ''New Scientist''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Z.G. Dai et al. from Nanjing University suggested that Supernova [[ASASSN-15lh]] is a newborn strange quark star.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = The Most Luminous Supernova ASASSN-15lh: Signature of a Newborn Rapidly-Rotating Strange Quark Star |arxiv = 1508.07745 |date = 2015-08-31|first = Z.

==Other theorized quark formations==
{{more citations needed|date=December 2015}}
Apart from ordinary quark matter and strange quark matter, other types of quark-gluon plasma might theoretically occur or be formed inside neutron stars and quark stars. This includes the following, some of which has been observed and studied in laboratories:

* Jaffe 1977, suggested a [[tetraquark|four-quark]] state with strangeness (qs{{overline|qs}}).
* Jaffe 1977 suggested the H [[dibaryon]], a six-quark state with equal numbers of up-, down-, and strange quarks (represented as uuddss or udsuds).
* Bound multi-quark systems with heavy quarks (QQ{{overline|qq}}).
* In 1987, a [[pentaquark]] state was first proposed with a charm anti-quark (qqqs{{overline|c}}).
* Pentaquark state with an antistrange quark and four light quarks consisting of up- and down-quarks only (qqqq{{overline|s}}).
* Light pentaquarks are grouped within an antidecuplet, the lightest candidate, Ө&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.
** This can also be described by the diquark model of Jaffe and Wilczek ([[Quantum chromodynamics|QCD]]).
* Ө&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; and antiparticle {{overline|Ө}}&lt;sup&gt;−−&lt;/sup&gt;.
* Doubly strange pentaquark (ssdd{{overline|u}}), member of the light pentaquark antidecuplet.

'''Seaweed fuel''' or '''seaweed oil''' is an alternative to liquid [[fossil fuel]]s that uses [[seaweed]] as its source of energy-rich oils. Like fossil fuel, seaweed fuel releases {{CO2}} when burnt, but unlike fossil fuel, algae fuel and other biofuels only release {{CO2}} recently removed from the atmosphere via photosynthesis as the seaweed or plant grew.

Seaweed does not require [[fresh water]] and can as such be grown in the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novozymes.com/en/news/news-archive/2012/01/from-seaweed-to-biofuels|title=A new research collaboration between Novozymes and Sea6 Energy will explore enzymatic technology to produce fuel ethanol, fine chemicals, and protein from seaweed|author=|date=|website=www.novozymes.com|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fuels==
Seaweed can be converted into various types of fuels, depending on the technique and the part of the cells used. Also, using techniques such as fast [[hydrothermal liquefaction]], oil yield for the seaweed can be increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.algal.2014.05.009 |title=Fast hydrothermal liquefaction of a Norwegian macro-alga: Screening tests |journal=Algal Research |volume=6 |pages=271–276 |year=2014 |last1=Bach |first1=Quang-Vu |last2=Sillero |first2=Miguel Valcuende |last3=Tran |first3=Khanh-Quang |last4=Skjermo |first4=Jorunn }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2014/10/turning-humble-seaweed-to-biofuel.html|title=Turning Humble Seaweed to Biofuel|author=|date=|website=www.renewableenergyworld.com|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[electrical power]] systems a '''slack bus''' (or '''swing bus'''), defined as a Vδ bus, is used to balance the active power |P| and reactive power |Q| in a system while performing [[Power flow study|load flow studies]]. The slack bus is used to provide for system losses by emitting or absorbing active and/or reactive power to and from the system.

== Load flow studies ==
For power systems engineers, a load flow study explains the power system conditions at various intervals during operation. It aims to minimize the difference between the calculated and actual quantities. Here, the slack bus can contribute to the minimization by having an unconstrained real and reactive power input.

&lt;math&gt;P_i=P_{Gi}-P_{Li}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Delta P_i=P_i-P_{i,calc}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Delta Q_i=Q_i-Q_{i,calc}&lt;/math&gt;

The use of a slack bus has an inherent disadvantage when dealing with uncertain input variables: the slack bus must absorb all uncertainties arising from the system and thus must have the widest possible nodal power distributions. Even moderate amounts of uncertainty in a large system may allow the resulting distributions to contain values beyond the slack bus's margins.

A load flow approach able to directly incorporate uncertainties into the solution processes can be very useful. The results from such analyses give solutions over the range of the uncertainties, i.e., solutions that are sets of values or regions instead of single values.

== Types of buses ==
Buses are of 3 types and are classified as:
# PQ bus – the real power |P| and reactive power |Q| are specified. It is also known as ''Load Bus''. Generally, in a PQ bus, the generated real and reactive power will be assumed to be zero. However, power will be flowing out, thus, the real power and reactive power will be both negative. The ''Load Bus'' will be used to find the bus voltage and angle.
# PV bus – the real power |P| and the voltage magnitude |V| are specified. It is also known as ''Generator Bus''. The real power and voltage are specified for buses that are generators. These buses have a constant power generation, controlled through a prime mover, and a constant bus voltage.
# Slack bus – to balance the active and reactive power in the system. It is also known as the ''Reference Bus'' or the ''Swing Bus''. The slack bus will serve as an angular reference for all other buses in the system, which is set to 0°. The voltage magnitude is also assumed to be 1 p.u. at the slack bus.

The slack bus provides or absorbs active and reactive power to and from the transmission line to provide for losses, since these variables are unknown until the final solution is established. The slack bus is the only bus for which the system reference [[phase angle]] is defined. From this, the various angular differences can be calculated in the power flow equations. If a slack bus is not specified, then a generator bus with maximum real power |P| acts as the slack bus. A given scheme can involve more than one slack bus.

== Formulation of load flow problem ==
The most common formulation of the load flow problem specifies all input variables (PQ at loads, PV at generators) as deterministic values. Each set of specified values corresponds to one system state, which depends on a set of system conditions. When those conditions are uncertain, numerous scenarios must be analyzed.

A classic load flow analysis consists of calculating voltage magnitude and phase angle at the buses, as well as the active and reactive line flows for the specified terminal (or bus conditions). Four variables are associated with each bus:
* voltage |V|
* phase angle |δ|
* active or real power |P|
* reactive power |Q|

Based on these values, a bus may be classified into the above-mentioned three categories as -
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  !! P !! Q !! V !! δ
|-
| P-Q bus || known || known || unknown || unknown
|-
| P-V bus || known || unknown || known || unknown
|-
| Slack bus || unknown || unknown || known || known
|}
Real and reactive powers (i.e. complex power) cannot be fixed. The net complex power flow into the network is not known in advance, and the system power losses are unknown until the study is complete. It is necessary to have one bus (i.e. the slack bus) at which complex power is unspecified so that it supplies the difference in the total system load plus losses and the sum of the complex powers specified at the remaining buses. The complex power allocated to this bus is computed as part of the solution. In order for the variations in real and reactive powers of the slack bus to be a small percentage of its generating capacity during the solution process, the bus connected to the largest generating station is normally selected as the slack bus. The slack bus is crucial to a load flow problem since it will account for transmission line losses. In a load flow problem, conservation of energy results in the total generation equaling to the sum of the loads. However, there still would be a discrepancy in these quantities due to line losses, which are dependent on line current. Yet to determine line current, angles and voltages of the buses connected to the line would be needed. Here, the slack bus will be required to account for line losses and serve as a generator, injecting real power to the system.

== Solutions ==
The solution requires mathematical formulation and numerical solution. Since load flow problems generate non-linear equations that computers cannot solve quickly, [[Numerical analysis|numerical methods]] are required. The following methods are commonly used algorithms:
# [[Gauss iterated map|Gauss Iterative Method]] -  &lt;math&gt;V_i={1 \over Y_{ii}}({P_i-jQ_i \over V_i}-\sum_{k=1}^n Y_{ik}V_{ik})&lt;/math&gt;
# Fast Decoupled Load Flow Method
# [[Gauss–Seidel method|Gauss-Seidel Method]]
# [[Newton–Raphson method|Newton-Raphson Method]]

A '''storm''' is any disturbed state of an [[Natural environment|environment]] or in an astronomical body's [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]] especially affecting its surface, and strongly implying [[severe weather]]. It may be marked by significant disruptions to normal conditions such as strong [[wind]], [[tornado]]es, [[hail]], [[thunder]] and [[lightning]] (a [[thunderstorm]]), heavy [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] ([[snowstorm]], rainstorm), heavy [[freezing rain]] ([[ice storm]]), strong winds ([[tropical cyclone]], windstorm), or wind transporting some [[Chemical substance|substance]] through the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] as in a [[dust storm]], [[blizzard]], sandstorm, etc.

Storms have the potential to harm lives and property via [[storm surge]], heavy [[rain]] or [[snow]] causing [[flooding]] or road impassibility, [[lightning]], [[wildfire]]s, and vertical [[wind shear]]. Systems with significant rainfall and duration help alleviate drought in places they move through. Heavy snowfall can allow special recreational activities to take place which would not be possible otherwise, such as skiing and snowmobiling.

Storms are created when a center of [[Low pressure area|low pressure]] develops with the system of [[high pressure area|high pressure]] surrounding it. This combination of opposing forces can create winds and result in the formation of storm [[clouds]] such as [[cumulonimbus cloud|cumulonimbus]]. Small localized areas of low pressure can form from hot air rising off hot ground, resulting in smaller disturbances such as [[dust devils]] and [[whirlwinds]].

[[File:Classic Storm.jpg|thumb|Classic storm of summer, in [[Sierras de Córdoba]], [[Argentina]].]]

There are many varieties and names for storms:
* [[Ice storm]]&amp;nbsp;— Ice storms are one of the most dangerous forms of [[winter storm]]s. When surface temperatures are below freezing, but a thick layer of above-freezing air remains aloft, rain can fall into the freezing layer and freeze upon impact into a glaze of ice. In general, {{convert|8|mm|in}} of accumulation is all that is required, especially in combination with breezy conditions, to start downing power lines as well as tree limbs.&lt;ref&gt;City of Kent, Washington. [http://www.ci.kent.wa.us/emergency/KentHazards/SNOW.pdf#search=%22ice%20storm%20definition%22 Snow/Ice Storm.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228235209/http://www.ci.kent.wa.us/emergency/KentHazards/SNOW.pdf#search=%22ice%20storm%20definition%22 |date=February 28, 2008 }} Retrieved on 2006-11-26.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ice storms also make unheated road surfaces too slick to drive upon. Ice storms can vary in time range from hours to days and can cripple small towns and large urban centers alike.
* [[Blizzard]]&amp;nbsp;— There are varying definitions for blizzards, both over time and by location. In general, a blizzard is accompanied by [[gale]]-force winds, heavy snow (accumulating at a rate of at least 5 centimeters (2&amp;nbsp;in) per hour), and very cold conditions (below approximately −10 degrees Celsius or 14&amp;nbsp;F). Lately, the temperature criterion has fallen out of the definition across the United States&lt;ref&gt;University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. [http://www.meted.ucar.edu/hazwx/topic3/fact9.htm Winter Storms.] Retrieved on 2006-11-26.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Snowstorm]]&amp;nbsp;—  A heavy fall of snow accumulating at a rate of more than 5 centimeters (2&amp;nbsp;in) per hour that lasts several hours. Snow storms, especially ones with a high liquid equivalent and breezy conditions, can down tree limbs, cut off power, and paralyze travel over a large region.
* Coastal Storm&amp;nbsp;— large [[wind waves]] and/or [[storm surge]] that strike the coastal zone. Their impacts include [[coastal erosion]] and [[coastal flooding]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harley |first=Mitchell |editor1-last=Ciavola |editor1-first=Paolo |editor2-last=Coco |editor2-first=Giovanni |title=Coastal Storms: Processes and Impacts |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |date=March 24, 2017 |pages=1–22 |chapter=Chapter 1: Coastal Storm Definition|isbn=978-1-118-93710-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ocean Storm&amp;nbsp;— Storm conditions out at sea are defined as having sustained winds of 48 knots (55&amp;nbsp;mph or 90&amp;nbsp;km/h) or greater.&lt;ref name="OPC"&gt;Ocean Prediction Center. [http://www.opc.ncep.noaa.gov/product_description/keyterm.shtml Terminology and Weather Symbols.] Retrieved on 2006-11-26.&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually just referred to as a storm, these systems can sink vessels of all types and sizes.
* [[Firestorm]]&amp;nbsp;— Firestorms are conflagrations which attain such intensity that they create and sustain their own wind systems. It is most commonly a natural phenomenon, created during some of the largest bushfires, forest fires, and wildfires. The [[Peshtigo Fire]] is one example of a firestorm. Firestorms can also be deliberate effects of targeted explosives such as occurred as a result of the aerial [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombings of Dresden]]. [[Nuclear weapon|Nuclear detonations]] generate firestorms if high winds are not present.
* [[Dust devil]]&amp;nbsp;— a small, localized updraft of rising air.
* Wind storm— A storm marked by high wind with little or no precipitation.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/windstorm |title= windstorm&amp;#124;Retrieved on 2009-10-26.|publisher= merriam-webster }}&lt;/ref&gt; Windstorm damage often opens the door for massive amounts of water and debris to cause further damage to a structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Salvatore |first1=Sheila E |title=Hurricanes and Windstorm Coverage » Adjusters International |url=https://www.adjustersinternational.com/publications/adjusting-today/hurricanes-and-windstorm-coverage/2/ |website=Adjusters International}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[European windstorm]]s and [[derecho]]s are two type of windstorms.&lt;ref name="NOAA"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.spc.noaa.gov/misc/AbtDerechos/derechofacts#definition |title=Derecho&amp;#124;Retrieved on 2010-07-17.|publisher= National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration }}&lt;/ref&gt; High wind is also the cause of [[Dust storm|sandstorms]] in dry climates.
* [[Squall]]&amp;nbsp;— sudden onset of wind increase of at least 16 knots (30&amp;nbsp;km/h) or greater sustained for at least one minute.
* [[Gale]]&amp;nbsp;— An [[extratropical storm]] with sustained winds between 34–48 knots (39–55&amp;nbsp;mph or 63–90&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref name="OPC" /&gt;
* [[Thunderstorm]]&amp;nbsp;— A thunderstorm is a type of storm that generates [[lightning]] and the attendant [[thunder]]. It is  normally accompanied by heavy [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. Thunderstorms occur throughout the world, with the highest frequency in [[tropical]] [[rainforest]] regions where there are conditions of high humidity and temperature along with atmospheric instability. These storms occur when high levels of condensation form in a volume of unstable air that generates deep, rapid, upward motion in the atmosphere. The heat energy creates powerful rising air currents that swirl upwards to the [[tropopause]]. Cool descending air currents produce strong downdraughts below the storm. After the storm has spent its energy, the rising currents die away and downdraughts break up the cloud. Individual storm clouds can measure 2–10&amp;nbsp;km across.
* [[Tropical cyclone]]&amp;nbsp;— A tropical cyclone is a storm system with a closed circulation around a centre of [[low pressure area|low pressure]], fueled by the heat released when moist air rises and condenses. The name underscores its origin in the [[tropics]] and their [[cyclonic]] nature. Tropical cyclones are distinguished from other cyclonic storms such as [[nor'easter]]s and [[polar low]]s by the heat mechanism that fuels them, which makes them "warm core" storm systems.
:Tropical cyclones form in the [[ocean]]s if the [[Tropical cyclone#Formation|conditions in the area are favorable]], and depending on their strength and location, there are various terms by which they are called, such as ''tropical depression'', ''tropical storm'', ''hurricane'' and ''typhoon''.&lt;ref&gt;Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory. [http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A1.html Frequently Asked Questions Subject: A1) What is a hurricane, typhoon, or tropical cyclone?] Retrieved on 2006-11-26.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hail]]storm&amp;nbsp;— a type of storm that precipitates round chunks of ice. Hailstorms usually occur during regular thunder storms. While most of the hail that precipitates from the clouds is fairly small and virtually harmless, there are occasional occurrences of hail greater than 2&amp;nbsp;inches (5&amp;nbsp;cm) in diameter that can cause much damage and injuries.
[[File:Binger Oklahoma Tornado.jpg|thumb|right|A tornado in Binger, Oklahoma during the [[May 1981 tornado outbreak|1981 outbreak]].]]
* [[Tornado]]&amp;nbsp;— A tornado is a violent, destructive wind storm occurring on land. Usually its appearance is that of a dark, funnel-shaped cloud. Often tornadoes are preceded by thunderstorms and a [[wall cloud]]. They are often called the most destructive of storms, and while they form all over the world, the interior of the United States is the most prone area, especially throughout [[Tornado Alley]].
* [[Derecho]]&amp;nbsp;— A derecho is a widespread, long-lived, straight-line wind storm that is associated with a land-based, fast-moving group of severe thunderstorms.

== Classification ==
A strict [[meteorology|meteorological]] definition of a terrestrial storm is a wind measuring 10 or higher on the [[Beaufort scale]], meaning a wind speed of 24.5 [[Metre per second|m/s]] (89&amp;nbsp;km/h, 55&amp;nbsp;mph) or more; however, popular usage is not so restrictive. Storms can last anywhere from 12 to 200 hours, depending on season and geography. In North America, the east and northeast storms are noted for the most frequent repeatability and duration, especially during the cold period. Big terrestrial storms alter the [[oceanographic]] conditions that in turn may affect food abundance and distribution: strong currents, strong tides, increased siltation, change in water temperatures, overturn in the water column, etc.  &lt;!--The storm classification for assessing the relative power of northeasterly storms in the west-Atlantic has been developed by scientists at the [[University of Virginia]]. A relative frequency of 50% means here one such storm every two years and 0.1% once every 1000 years.

== Extraterrestrial storms ==
[[File:PIA02863 - Jupiter surface motion animation.gif|thumb|The [[Great Red Spot]] on Jupiter]]

Storms do not only occur on [[Earth]]; other planetary bodies with a sufficient atmosphere ([[gas giant]]s in particular) also undergo stormy weather. The [[Great Red Spot]] on [[Jupiter]] provides a well-known example. Though technically an anticyclone, with greater than hurricane wind speeds, it is larger than the Earth and has persisted for at least 340 years, having first been observed by astronomer [[Galileo Galilei]]. [[Neptune]] also had its own lesser-known [[Great Dark Spot]].

In September 1994, the [[Hubble telescope]] – using [[Wide Field Planetary Camera 2]] – imaged storms on [[Saturn]] generated by upwelling of warmer air, similar to a terrestrial thunderhead. The east-west extent of the same-year{{clarify|date=September 2015}} storm equalled the diameter of Earth. The storm was observed earlier in September 1990 and acquired the name [[Dragon Storm (astronomy)|Dragon Storm]].

The dust storms of [[Mars]] vary in size, but can often cover the entire planet. They tend to occur when Mars comes closest to the Sun, and have been shown to increase the global temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Philips|first=Tony|date=2001-07-16|title= Planet Gobbling Dust Storms|work=NASA Science News|accessdate=2006-06-07|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast16jul_1/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One particularly large Martian storm was exhaustively studied up close due to coincidental timing. When the first [[spacecraft]] to successfully orbit another planet, [[Mariner 9]], arrived and successfully orbited Mars on 14 November 1971, [[Planetary science|planetary scientists]] were surprised to find the [[celestial body's atmosphere|atmosphere]] was thick with a planet-wide robe of [[dust]], the largest storm ever observed on Mars. The surface of the planet was totally obscured. Mariner 9's computer was reprogrammed from Earth to delay imaging of the surface for a couple of months until the dust settled, however, the surface-obscured images contributed much to the collection of Mars atmospheric and planetary surface science.&lt;ref name=Pyle2012-M9&gt;{{cite book |last=Pyle|first=Rod |title=Destination Mars |year=2012 |publisher=Prometheus Books |isbn=978-1-61614-589-7 |pages=73–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two [[extrasolar planet]]s are known to have storms: [[HD 209458 b]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rincon |first=Paul |title='Superstorm' rages on exoplanet |work=[[BBC News]] London |date=23 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[HD 80606 b]]. The former's storm was discovered on June 23, 2010 and measured at 6,200&amp;nbsp;km/h, while the latter produces winds of 17,700 kilometers (11,000&amp;nbsp;mi) per hour across the surface. The spin of the planet then creates giant swirling shock-wave storms that carry the heat aloft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boyle|first1=Alan|title=10 Types Of Alien Weather That Put Earth To Shame|url=http://listverse.com/2014/06/16/10-types-of-alien-weather-that-put-earth-to-shame/|website=Listverse|accessdate=2014-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strong [[wind]]s from any storm type can damage or destroy vehicles, buildings, bridges, and other outside objects, turning loose debris into deadly flying projectiles. In the United States, [[tropical cyclone scales|major hurricanes]] comprise just 21% of all landfalling tropical cyclones, but account for 83% of all damage.&lt;ref name="faqd5"&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Landsea|year=1998|title=How does the damage that hurricanes cause increase as a function of wind speed?|publisher=Hurricane Research Division|accessdate=2007-02-24|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/D5.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tropical cyclones often knock out power to tens or hundreds of thousands of people, preventing vital communication and hampering rescue efforts.&lt;ref name="Power failures"&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff Writer|date=2005-08-30|title=Hurricane Katrina Situation Report #11|publisher=Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE) [[United States Department of Energy]]|accessdate=2007-02-24|url=http://www.oe.netl.doe.gov/docs/katrina/katrina_083005_1600.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tropical cyclones often destroy key bridges, overpasses, and roads, complicating efforts to transport food, clean water, and medicine to the areas that need it. Furthermore, the damage caused by tropical cyclones to buildings and dwellings can result in economic damage to a region, and to a [[diaspora]] of the population of the region.&lt;ref name="oxfo" /&gt;

The [[storm surge]], or the increase in sea level due to the cyclone, is typically the worst effect from landfalling tropical cyclones, historically resulting in 90% of tropical cyclone deaths.&lt;ref name="oxfo"&gt;{{cite web|author=James M.

The storm surges and winds of hurricanes may be destructive to human-made structures, but they also stir up the waters of coastal estuaries, which are typically important fish breeding locales.

[[Lightning#Cloud-to-ground|Cloud-to-ground lightning]] frequently occurs within the phenomena of thunderstorms and have numerous hazards towards landscapes and populations. One of the more significant hazards lightning can pose is the wildfires they are capable of igniting.&lt;ref name='Scott2000'&gt;{{cite journal | doi =10.1016/S0031-0182(00)00192-9 | title =The Pre-Quaternary history of fire | year =2000 | author =Scott, A | journal = 	Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology | volume =164 | pages =281 | bibcode =2000PPP...164..281S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under a regime of low precipitation (LP) thunderstorms, where little precipitation is present, rainfall cannot prevent fires from starting when vegetation is dry as lightning produces a concentrated amount of extreme heat.&lt;ref name="ufl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plaza.ufl.edu/rakov/Gas.html|title=Lightning Makes Glass|accessdate=November 7, 2007|publisher=[[University of Florida]], Gainesville|year=1999|author=Vladimir A.

Precipitation with low [[PH|potential of hydrogen levels]] (pH), otherwise known as acid rain, is also a frequent risk produced by lightning.  [[Distilled water]], which contains no [[carbon dioxide]], has a [[Neutral solution|neutral]] [[pH]] of 7. Liquids with a pH less than 7 are acidic, and those with a pH greater than 7 are bases.  “Clean” or unpolluted rain has a slightly acidic pH of about 5.2, because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together to form [[carbonic acid]], a weak acid (pH 5.6 in distilled water), but unpolluted rain also contains other chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=G.

Acid rain can damage infrastructures containing calcite or other solid chemical compounds containing carbon. In ecosystems, acid rain can dissolve plant tissues of vegetations and increase acidification process in bodies of water and in [[soil]], resulting in deaths of marine and terrestrial organisms.&lt;ref name="EPA"&gt;{{cite web|author=Office of Air and Radiation Clean Air Markets Division|url=http://www.epa.gov/acidrain/effects/surface_water.html|title=Effects of Acid Rain&amp;nbsp;– Surface Waters and own Aquatic Animals|accessdate=2009-09-05|date=2008-12-01|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hail damage to roofs often goes unnoticed until further structural damage is seen, such as leaks or cracks. It is hardest to recognize hail damage on shingled roofs and flat roofs, but all roofs have their own hail damage detection problems.&lt;ref name="Hail Damage to Roofs from Adjusting Today"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://adjustersinternational.com/publications/adjusting-today/multi-family-complexes-insuring-exposures-and-losses/16/|title= Hail Damage to Roofs |accessdate= 2009-12-11 |publisher= Adjusting Today }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Metal roofs are fairly resistant to hail damage, but may accumulate cosmetic damage in the form of dents and damaged coatings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hail is also a common nuisance to drivers of automobiles, severely denting the vehicle and cracking or even shattering [[windshields]] and [[Car glass|windows]].  Rarely, massive hailstones have been known to cause [[concussion]]s or fatal head [[physical trauma|trauma]].  Hailstorms have been the cause of costly and deadly events throughout history.  One of the earliest recorded incidents occurred around the 9th century in [[Roopkund]], [[Uttarakhand]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/11/07/wind07.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/11/07/ixworld.html |title=Giant hail killed more than 200 in Himalayas |author=David Orr |date=2004-11-07 |accessdate=2009-08-28 |publisher=Telegraph Group Unlimited via the Internet Wayback Machine |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051203015218/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2004%2F11%2F07%2Fwind07.xml&amp;sSheet=%2Fnews%2F2004%2F11%2F07%2Fixworld.html |archivedate=2005-12-03 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest hailstone in terms of diameter and weight ever recorded in the United States fell on July 23, 2010 in [[Vivian, South Dakota]] in the United States; it measured {{convert|8|in|cm}} in diameter and {{convert|18.62|in|cm}} in circumference, weighing in at {{convert|1.93|lbs|kg}}.&lt;ref name="Record"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hailstone record press release|date=2010-07-30|publisher=National Weather Service|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/crh/pdf/073010RecordHailVivianSD.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This broke the previous record for diameter set by a hailstone 7&amp;nbsp;inches diameter and 18.75&amp;nbsp;inches circumference which fell in [[Aurora, Nebraska]] in the United States on June 22, 2003, as well as the record for weight, set by a hailstone of {{convert|1.67|lbs|kg}} that fell in [[Coffeyville, Kansas]] in 1970.&lt;ref name="Record" /&gt;

Various hazards, ranging from hail to lightning can affect outside technology facilities, such as [[antennas]], [[satellite dishes]], and towers. As a result, companies with outside facilities have begun installing such facilities underground, in order to reduce the risk of damage from storms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=Robert C.|title=Computer Security: Protecting Digital Resources|year=2009|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|location=Sudbury, MA|isbn=0-7637-5994-5|pages=100|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_R5ndK-i3vkC&amp;pg=PA100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Substantial snowfall can disrupt public infrastructure and services, slowing human activity even in regions that are accustomed to such weather. Air and ground transport may be greatly inhibited or shut down entirely. Populations living in snow-prone areas have developed various ways to travel across the snow, such as [[ski]]s, [[snowshoe]]s, and [[sled]]s pulled by horses, dogs, or other animals and later, [[snowmobile]]s. Basic utilities such as [[electricity distribution|electricity]], [[telephone line]]s, and [[Natural gas#Uses|gas supply]] can also fail. In addition, snow can make roads much harder to travel and vehicles attempting to use them can easily become stuck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsidc.org/snow/shovel.html |title=Have Snow Shovel, Will Travel |author=Laura Cheshire |year=1997 |accessdate=2009-07-08 |publisher=National Snow and Ice Data Center |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428171243/http://nsidc.org/snow/shovel.html |archivedate=2009-04-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The combined effects can lead to a "[[Weather-related cancellation|snow day]]" on which gatherings such as school, work, or church are officially canceled. In areas that normally have very little or no snow, a snow day may occur when there is only light accumulation or even the threat of snowfall, since those areas are unprepared to handle any amount of snow. In some areas, such as some states in the United States, schools are given a yearly quota of snow days (or "calamity days"). Once the quota is exceeded, the snow days must be made up.&lt;ref name="DDN Larsen"&gt;{{cite news|title=School districts are using up calamity days |author=Dave Larsen |work=[[Dayton Daily News]] |location=[[Dayton, Ohio]] |publisher=[[Cox Enterprises]] |date=2009-01-27 |accessdate=2009-02-05 |url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/n/content/oh/story/news/local/2009/01/27/ddn012709calamityweb.html |quote=Ohio school districts can use five calamity days before they must start adding extra days to the school calendar. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131071023/http://www.daytondailynews.com/n/content/oh/story/news/local/2009/01/27/ddn012709calamityweb.html |archivedate=January 31, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WCMH Willis"&gt;{{cite news|title=Districts Consider Calamity Options |author=Donna Willis |work=[[WCMH-TV]] |location=[[Columbus, Ohio]] |publisher=[[Media General]] |date=2009-01-30 |accessdate=2009-02-05 |url=http://www.nbc4i.com/cmh/news/local/education/article/districts_consider_calamity_options/12343/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615071458/http://www.nbc4i.com/cmh/news/local/education/article/districts_consider_calamity_options/12343/ |archivedate=2011-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WKTV Ferris"&gt;{{cite news|title=Decision for city schools to stay open prompts calls from irate parents |author=Joleen Ferris |work=[[WKTV]] |location=[[Utica, New York]] |publisher=[[Smith Media]] |date=2009-01-28 |accessdate=2009-02-05 |url=http://www.wktv.com/news/local/38543532.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130084700/http://www.wktv.com/news/local/38543532.html |archivedate=2009-01-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other states, all snow days must be made up.&lt;ref name="Enquirer Wolff"&gt;{{cite news|title=Snow may stretch out school year|author1=Christine Wolff |author2=Tanya Albert |work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|location=[[Cincinnati, Ohio]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=1999-03-09|accessdate=2009-02-05|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/1999/03/10/loc_snow_may_stretch_out.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, schools may extend the remaining school days later into the afternoon, shorten [[spring break]], or delay the start of [[summer vacation]].

Accumulated snow is [[Snow removal|removed]] to make travel easier and safer, and to decrease the long-term effect of a heavy snowfall. This process utilizes [[shovel]]s and [[snowplow]]s, and is often assisted by sprinkling [[salt]] or other chloride-based chemicals, which reduce the melting temperature of snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3gxuwTE5_MC&amp;pg=PA10|title=Managing roadway snow and ice control operations|author=David A.

Strong wind outflow from thunderstorms causes rapid changes in the three-dimensional wind velocity just above ground level. Initially, this outflow causes a headwind that increases airspeed, which normally causes a pilot to reduce engine power if they are unaware of the wind shear. As the aircraft passes into the region of the downdraft, the localized headwind diminishes, reducing the aircraft's airspeed and increasing its sink rate. Then, when the aircraft passes through the other side of the downdraft, the headwind becomes a tailwind, reducing lift generated by the wings, and leaving the aircraft in a low-power, low-speed descent. This can lead to an accident if the aircraft is too low to effect a recovery before ground contact. As the result of the accidents in the 1970s and 1980s, in 1988 the U.S. [[Federal Aviation Administration]] mandated that all commercial aircraft have [[Airborne wind shear detection and alert system|on-board wind shear detection systems]] by 1993. Between 1964 and 1985, wind shear directly caused or contributed to 26 major civil transport aircraft accidents in the U.S. that led to 620 deaths and 200 injuries. Since 1995, the number of major civil aircraft accidents caused by wind shear has dropped to approximately one every ten years, due to the mandated on-board detection as well as the addition of Doppler [[weather radar]] units on the ground.

[[File:Great Wave off Kanagawa2.jpg|thumb|''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'', an [[ukiyo-e]] print by [[Hokusai]] ]]

=== In mythology and literature ===
According to the [[Bible]], a giant storm sent by [[God]] flooded the Earth. [[Noah]] and his family and the animals entered [[Noah's Ark|the Ark]], and "the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened, and the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights." The flood covered even the highest mountains to a depth of more than twenty feet, and all creatures died; only Noah and those with him on the Ark were left alive.  In the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus Christ]] is recorded to have calmed a storm on the [[Sea of Galilee]].
{{see also|Genesis flood myth}}
The [[Gilgamesh flood myth]] is a deluge story in the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''.

In [[Greek mythology]] there were several gods of storms: [[Briareos]], the god of sea storms; Aigaios, a god of the violent sea storms; and [[Aiolos]], keeper of storm-winds, squalls and tempests.

The ''[[Sea Venture]]'' was wrecked near [[Bermuda]] in 1609, which led to the colonization of Bermuda&lt;ref&gt;Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070926034027/http://www.clairehope.btinternet.co.uk/PDFs/LinebaughRediker_seaventure.pdf The Wreck of the Sea-Venture.]&lt;/ref&gt; and provided the inspiration for [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] play ''[[The Tempest (play)|The Tempest]]''(1611).&lt;ref&gt;David M. Roth. [http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/research/roth/va17hur.htm Seventeenth Century Virginia Hurricanes.] Retrieved on 2006-11-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, [[Thomas Gates (governor)|Sir Thomas Gates]], future governor of [[Virginia]], was on his way to England from [[Jamestown, Virginia]]. On [[Saint James Day]], while he was between [[Cuba]] and the [[Bahamas]], a hurricane raged for nearly two days. Though one of the small vessels in the fleet sank to the bottom of the [[Florida Straits]], seven of the remaining vessels reached [[Virginia]] within several days after the storm. The flagship of the fleet, known as ''Sea Adventure'', disappeared and was presumed lost. A small bit of fortune befell the ship and her crew when they made landfall on Bermuda. The vessel was damaged on a surrounding [[coral reef]], but all aboard survived for nearly a year on the island. The British colonists claimed the island and quickly settled Bermuda. In May 1610, they set forth for Jamestown, this time arriving at their destination.

The children's novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', written by [[L. Frank Baum]] and illustrated by [[W. W. Denslow]], chronicles the adventures of a young girl named [[Dorothy Gale]] in the [[Land of Oz]], after being swept away from her Kansas farm home by a tornado. The story was originally published by the George M. Hill Company in Chicago on May 17, 1900 and has since been reprinted numerous times, most often under the name ''The Wizard of Oz'', and adapted for use in other media.  Thanks in part to the [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|1939 MGM movie]], it is one of the best-known stories in American popular culture and has been widely translated. Its initial success, and the success of the popular [[The Wizard of Oz (1902 musical)|1902 Broadway musical]] which Baum adapted from his original story, led to Baum's writing thirteen more [[List of Oz books|Oz books]].

Hollywood director [[King Vidor]] (February 8, 1894&amp;nbsp;– November 1, 1982) survived the [[Galveston Hurricane of 1900]] as a boy.  Based on that experience, he published a fictionalized account of that cyclone, titled "Southern Storm", for the May 1935 issue of [[Esquire (magazine)|''Esquire'' magazine]].  [[Erik Larson (author)|Erik Larson]] excerpts a passage from that article in his 2005 book, ''[[Isaac's Storm]]'':&lt;ref name="Larson, Erik 1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Erik Larson (author)|Larson, Erik]]|year=1999|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/features/isaacsstorm/book/index.html|title=Isaac's Storm|publisher=[[Random House]] Publishing|isbn= 0-609-60233-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''I remember now that it seemed as if we were in a bowl looking up toward the level of the sea.  As we stood there in the sandy street, my mother and I, I wanted to take my mother's hand and hurry her away.  I felt as if the sea was going to break over the edge of the bowl and come puring down upon us.''

Numerous other accounts of the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 have been made in print and in film.  Larson cites many of them in ''[[Isaac's Storm]]'', which centrally features that storm, as well as chronicles the creation of the Weather Bureau (which came to known as the [[National Weather Service]]) and that agency's fateful rivalry with the weather service in Cuba, and a number of other major storms, such as those which ravaged [[Indianola, Texas]] in 1875 and [[1886 Indianola hurricane|1886]].&lt;ref name="Larson, Erik 1999" /&gt;

The [[Great Storm of 1987]] is key in an important scene near the end of ''[[Possession (Byatt novel)|Possession: A Romance]]'', the bestselling and [[Man Booker Prize]]-winning novel by [[A. S. Byatt]]. The Great Storm of 1987 occurred on the night of October 15–16, 1987, when an unusually strong weather system caused winds to hit much of [[southern England]] and northern [[France]]. It was the worst storm to hit England since the [[Great Storm of 1703]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7044050.stm | work=BBC News | title=Lessons learned from Great Storm | date=14 October 2007 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (284 years earlier) and was responsible for the deaths of at least 22&amp;nbsp;people in England and France combined (18 in England, at least four in France).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/education/secondary/students/1987.html |title=Met Office: The Great Storm of 1987 |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907191422/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/education/secondary/students/1987.html |archivedate=September 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In fine art ===
[[File:Rembrandt Christ in the Storm on the Lake of Galilee.jpg|thumb|[[Rembrandt]]'s ''[[The Storm on the Sea of Galilee]]''.]]

The Romantic seascape painters [[J. M. W. Turner]] and [[Ivan Aivazovsky]] created some of the most lasting impressions of the sublime and stormy seas that are firmly imprinted on the popular mind. Turner's representations of powerful natural forces reinvented the traditional [[seascape]] during the first half of the nineteenth century.

Upon his travels to Holland, he took note of the familiar large rolling waves of the English seashore transforming into the sharper, choppy waves of a Dutch storm. A characteristic example of Turner’s dramatic seascape is ''[[The Slave Ship]]'' of 1840. Aivazovsky left several thousand turbulent canvases in which he increasingly eliminated human figures and historical background to focus on such essential elements as light, sea, and sky. His grandiose ''Ninth Wave'' (1850) is an ode to human daring in the face of the elements.

=== In motion pictures ===
The 1926 silent film ''[[The Johnstown Flood (1926 film)|The Johnstown Flood]]'' features the [[Johnstown Flood|Great Flood of 1889]] in Johnstown, Pennsylvania.  The flood, caused by the catastrophic failure of the [[South Fork Dam]] after days of extremely heavy rainfall, prompted the first major [[disaster relief]] effort by the [[American Red Cross]], directed by [[Clara Barton]].  The Johnstown Flood was depicted in [[Johnstown Flood#In popular culture|numerous other media]] (both fictional and in non-fiction), as well.

[[Warner Bros.]]' 2000 [[drama film|dramatic]] [[disaster]] film ''[[The Perfect Storm (film)|The Perfect Storm]]'', directed by [[Wolfgang Petersen]], is an adaptation of [[Sebastian Junger]]'s 1997 [[non-fiction]] [[The Perfect Storm (book)|book of the same title]].

The 1991 Perfect Storm, also known as the Halloween Nor'easter of 1991, was a [[nor'easter]] that absorbed [[Hurricane Grace (1991)|Hurricane Grace]] and ultimately evolved into a small [[hurricane]] late in its life cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=National Oceanographic &amp; Atmospheric Administration News |date=2000-06-16 |title=NOAA Meteorologist Bob Case, the Man Who Named the Perfect Storm |accessdate=2011-07-01 |url=http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories/s444.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716220940/http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories/s444.htm |archivedate=16 July 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Storms were also portrayed in several works of music.  Examples of storm music are like [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi's]] ''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|Four Seasons]]'' [[violin concerto]] RV 315 (''Summer'') (third movement: [[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|Presto]]), [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven's]] ''[[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Pastoral Symphony]]'' (the fourth movement),and a scene in Act II of [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini's]] opera ''[[The Barber of Seville]]''.

[[File:Spencer1.jpg| 195px | thumb | right | [[Herbert Spencer]] coined the phrase "survival of the fittest".]]

"'''Survival of the fittest'''" is a phrase that originated from Darwinian [[evolutionary theory]] as a way of describing the mechanism of [[natural selection]]. The biological concept of [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] is defined as [[reproductive success]]. In Darwinian terms the phrase is best understood as "Survival of the form that will leave the most copies of itself in successive generations."

[[Herbert Spencer]] first used the phrase, after reading [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', in his ''Principles of Biology'' (1864), in which he drew parallels between his own economic theories and Darwin's biological ones: "This survival of the fittest, which I have here sought to express in mechanical terms, is that which Mr. Darwin has called 'natural selection', or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life."&lt;ref name=sotf&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-5140#back-mark-5140.f5 | title=Letter 5140 – Wallace, A.

^ "Herbert Spencer in his ''Principles of Biology'' of 1864, vol. 1, p. 444, wrote: 'This survival of the fittest, which I have here sought to express in mechanical terms, is that which Mr. Darwin has called "natural selection", or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life.'" {{Citation | url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=maurice_stucke | title=Better Competition Advocacy | accessdate=29 August 2007 | author=Maurice E.

Darwin responded positively to [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]'s suggestion of using Spencer's new phrase "survival of the fittest" as an alternative to "natural selection", and adopted the phrase in ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'' published in 1868.&lt;ref name=sotf/&gt;&lt;ref name="Variation "&gt;"This preservation, during the battle for life, of varieties which possess any advantage in structure, constitution, or instinct, I have called Natural Selection; and Mr. Herbert Spencer has well expressed the same idea by the Survival of the Fittest.

==History of the phrase==
[[Herbert Spencer]] first used the phrase – after reading [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[the Origin of Species|On the Origin of Species]]''&amp;nbsp;– in his ''Principles of Biology'' of 1864&lt;ref&gt;Vol. 1, p.&amp;nbsp;444&lt;/ref&gt; in which he drew parallels between his economic theories and Darwin's biological, evolutionary ones, writing, "This survival of the fittest, which I have here sought to express in mechanical terms, is that which Mr. Darwin has called 'natural selection', or the preservation of favored races in the struggle for life."&lt;ref name=sotf /&gt;

In July 1866 [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] wrote to Darwin about readers thinking that the phrase "[[natural selection]]" personified nature as "selecting", and said this misconception could be avoided "by adopting Spencer's term" ''Survival of the fittest''. Darwin promptly replied that Wallace's letter was "as clear as daylight. I fully agree with all that you say on the advantages of H. Spencer's excellent expression of 'the survival of the fittest'. This however had not occurred to me till reading your letter. It is, however, a great objection to this term that it cannot be used as a substantive governing a verb". Had he received the letter two months earlier, he would have worked the phrase into the fourth edition of the ''Origin'' which was then being printed, and he would use it in his "next book on Domestic Animals etc.".&lt;ref name=sotf /&gt;

Darwin wrote on page 6 of ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'' published in 1868, "This preservation, during the battle for life, of varieties which possess any advantage in structure, constitution, or instinct, I have called Natural Selection; and Mr. Herbert Spencer has well expressed the same idea by the Survival of the Fittest. The term "natural selection" is in some respects a bad one, as it seems to imply conscious choice; but this will be disregarded after a little familiarity". He defended his analogy as similar to language used in chemistry, and to astronomers depicting the "attraction of gravity as ruling the movements of the planets", or the way in which "agriculturists speak of man making domestic races by his power of selection". He had "often personified the word Nature; for I have found it difficult to avoid this ambiguity; but I mean by nature only the aggregate action and product of many natural laws,—and by laws only the ascertained sequence of events."&lt;ref name="Variation " /&gt;

In the first four editions of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', Darwin had used the phrase "natural selection".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.uni-kassel.de/fb19/plantphysiology/wallace.pdf |title=A Comparative Analysis of the Darwin-Wallace Papers and the Development of the Concept of Natural Selection |author=U. Kutschera |date=14 March 2003 |publisher=Institut für Biologie, Universität Kassel, Germany |accessdate=20 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414023545/http://www.uni-kassel.de/fb19/plantphysiology/wallace.pdf |archivedate=14 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In Chapter 4 of the 5th edition of ''The Origin'' published in 1869,&lt;ref name=1stD/&gt; Darwin implies again the synonym: "Natural Selection, or the Survival of the Fittest".&lt;ref name=OriginCh4/&gt; By "fittest" Darwin meant "better adapted for the immediate, local environment", not the common modern meaning of "in the best physical shape" (think of a puzzle piece, not an athlete).&lt;ref name=sjg/&gt; In the introduction he gave full credit to Spencer, writing "I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection. But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer of the Survival of the Fittest is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Darwin | first=Charles | author-link=Charles Darwin | year=1869 | title=On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life | edition=5th | publication-place=London | publisher=John Murray |page=72 | url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F387&amp;pageseq=101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Man Versus The State'', Spencer used the phrase in a postscript to justify a plausible explanation of how his theories would not be adopted by "societies of militant type". He uses the term in the context of societies at war, and the form of his reference suggests that he is applying a general principle.&lt;ref&gt;The principle of natural selection applied to groups of individual is known as [[Group selection]].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; "Thus by survival of the fittest, the militant type of society becomes characterized by profound confidence in the governing power, joined with a loyalty causing submission to it in all matters whatever".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author1=Herbert Spencer |author2=Truxton Beale |title=The Man Versus the State: A Collection of Essays |publisher=M.

Though Spencer’s conception of organic evolution is commonly interpreted as a form of [[Lamarckism]],{{efn|Though Spencer was an advocate of the inheritance of acquired characters, he considered Lamarck’s failure to explain organic evolution in physical terms as a serious weakness of his theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://evolutioncognition.wordpress.com/2013/05/26/adaptation-and-progress-spencers-criticism-of-lamarck/|title=Adaptation and Progress: Spencer’s Criticism of Lamarck|publisher=[https://evolutioncognition.wordpress.com/ Evolution &amp; Cognition]|author=Federico Morganti|date=May 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[Herbert Spencer]] is sometimes credited with inaugurating [[Social Darwinism]]. The phrase "survival of the fittest" has become widely used in popular literature as a catchphrase for any topic related or analogous to evolution and natural selection. It has thus been applied to principles of unrestrained competition, and it has been used extensively by both proponents and opponents of Social Darwinism.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Evolutionary biologists criticise the manner in which the term is used by non-scientists and the connotations that have grown around the term in [[pop culture|popular culture]]. The phrase also does not help in conveying the complex nature of natural selection, so modern biologists prefer and almost exclusively use the term [[natural selection]]. The biological concept of [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] refers to [[reproductive success]], as opposed to survival, and is not explicit in the specific ways in which organisms can be more "fit" (increase reproductive success) as having [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] characteristics that enhance survival and reproduction (which was the meaning that Spencer had in mind).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

== Critiquing the phrase "survival of the fittest"==
While the phrase "survival of the fittest" is often used to mean "[[natural selection]]", it is avoided by modern biologists, because the phrase can be misleading. For example, survival is only one aspect of selection, and not always the most important. Another problem is that the word "fit" is frequently confused with a state of physical fitness. In the evolutionary meaning "[[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]" is the rate of reproductive output among a class of genetic variants.&lt;ref name=IntroEvolutionaryBiology&gt;{{Citation | last=Colby | first=Chris | title=Introduction to Evolutionary Biology | date=1996–1997 | url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-intro-to-biology.html |publisher=[[TalkOrigins Archive]] |accessdate=22 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpreted as expressing a biological theory==
The phrase can also be interpreted to express a theory or hypothesis: that "fit" as opposed to "unfit" individuals or species, in some sense of "fit", will survive some test.

Interpretations of the phrase as expressing a theory are in danger of being [[Tautology (rhetoric)|tautological]], meaning roughly "those with a propensity to survive have a propensity to survive"; to have content the theory must use a concept of fitness that is independent of that of survival.&lt;ref name=sjg&gt;"Stephen Jay Gould, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tBxGpaV-ocsC&amp;pg=PA99#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Darwin's Untimely Burial]", 1976; from Philosophy of Biology:An Anthology, Alex Rosenberg, Robert Arp ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, May 2009, pp. 99–102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="crisp.psi.uni-heidelberg.de"&gt;von Sydow, M.

Interpreted as a theory of species survival, the theory that the fittest species survive is undermined by evidence that while direct competition is observed between individuals, populations and species, there is little evidence that competition has been the driving force in the evolution of large groups such as, for example,  amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Instead, these groups have evolved by expanding into empty [[ecological niches]].&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"&gt;{{Citation | url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/4/544.full.pdf+html | author=Sahney, S., Benton, M.J. and Ferry, P.A. | year=2010 | title=Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land | pmid=20106856 | journal=Biology Letters | pmc=2936204 | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024 | volume = 6 | pages = 544–547 |format=PDF | issue=4 | postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[punctuated equilibrium]] model of environmental and biological change, the factor determining survival is often not superiority over another in competition but ability to survive dramatic changes in environmental conditions, such as after a [[meteor]] impact energetic enough to greatly change the environment globally. The main land dwelling animals to survive the [[K-Pg boundary|K-Pg]] impact 66 million years ago had the ability to live in underground tunnels, for example.

In 2010 Sahney et al. argued that there is little evidence that intrinsic, biological factors such as competition have been the driving force in the evolution of large groups. Instead, they cited extrinsic, abiotic factors such as expansion as the driving factor on a large evolutionary scale. The rise of dominant groups such as amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds occurred by opportunistic expansion into empty [[ecological niches]] and the extinction of groups happened due to large shifts in the abiotic environment.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt;

==Interpreted as expressing a moral theory==

===Social Darwinists===
It has been claimed that "the survival of the fittest" theory in biology was interpreted by late 19th century capitalists as "an ethical precept that sanctioned cut-throat economic competition" and led to the advent of the theory of "[[social Darwinism]]" which was used to justify [[laissez-faire]] economics, war and racism. However, these ideas predate and commonly contradict Darwin's ideas, and indeed their proponents rarely invoked Darwin in support.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The term "social Darwinism" referring to capitalist ideologies was introduced as a term of abuse by [[Richard Hofstadter]]'s ''Social Darwinism in American Thought'' published in 1944.&lt;ref name=EvolutionPhilosophy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Leonard&gt;{{Citation | last=Leonard | first=Thomas C. | title=Mistaking Eugenics for Social Darwinism: Why Eugenics is Missing from the History of American Economics | journal=History of Political Economy | volume=37 | issue=supplement: | pages=200–233 | year=2005 | url=http://www.princeton.edu/~tleonard/papers/mistaking.pdf | doi=10.1215/00182702-37-Suppl_1-200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anarchists===
Russian anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]] viewed the concept of "survival of the fittest" as supporting co-operation rather than competition. In his book ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'' he set out his analysis leading to the conclusion that the fittest was not necessarily the best at competing individually, but often the community made up of those best at working together. He concluded that &lt;blockquote&gt;In the animal world we have seen that the vast majority of species live in societies, and that they find in association the best arms for the struggle for life: understood, of course, in its wide Darwinian sense – not as a struggle for the sheer means of existence, but as a struggle against all natural conditions unfavourable to the species. The animal species, in which individual struggle has been reduced to its narrowest limits, and the practice of mutual aid has attained the greatest development, are invariably the most numerous, the most prosperous, and the most open to further progress.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Applying this concept to human society, Kropotkin presented mutual aid as one of the dominant factors of evolution, the other being self-assertion, and concluded that &lt;blockquote&gt;In the practice of mutual aid, which we can retrace to the earliest beginnings of evolution, we thus find the positive and undoubted origin of our ethical conceptions; and we can affirm that in the ethical progress of man, mutual support not mutual struggle – has had the leading part. In its wide extension, even at the present time, we also see the best guarantee of a still loftier evolution of our race.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Tautology==

"Survival of the fittest" is sometimes claimed to be a [[Tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]].&lt;ref name=Corey&gt;{{Citation |title=Back to Darwin: the scientific case for Deistic evolution |author=Corey, Michael Anthony |publisher=Rowman and Littlefield |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-8191-9307-0 |chapter=Chapter 5. Natural Selection |page=147 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lBYuCMyaS4MC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasoning is that if one takes the term "fit" to mean "endowed with phenotypic characteristics which improve chances of survival and reproduction" (which is roughly how Spencer understood it), then "survival of the fittest" can simply be rewritten as "survival of those who are better equipped for surviving". Furthermore, the expression ''does'' become a tautology if one uses the most widely accepted definition of "fitness" in modern biology, namely reproductive success itself (rather than any set of characters conducive to this reproductive success). This reasoning is sometimes used to claim that Darwin's entire theory of evolution by natural selection is fundamentally tautological, and therefore devoid of any explanatory power.&lt;ref name=Corey/&gt;

However, the expression "survival of the fittest" (taken on its own and out of context) gives a very incomplete account of the mechanism of natural selection. The reason is that it does not mention a key requirement for natural selection, namely the requirement of ''heritability''. It is true that the phrase "survival of the fittest", in and by itself, is a tautology if fitness is defined by survival and reproduction. Natural selection is the portion of variation in reproductive success that is caused by ''[[heritable]]'' characters (see the article on [[natural selection]]).&lt;ref name=Corey/&gt;

If certain heritable characters increase or decrease the chances of survival and reproduction of their bearers, then it follows mechanically (by definition of "heritable") that those characters that improve survival and reproduction will increase in frequency over generations. This is precisely what is called "[[evolution]] by [[natural selection]]". On the other hand, if the characters which lead to differential reproductive success are not heritable, then no meaningful evolution will occur, "survival of the fittest" or not: if improvement in reproductive success is caused by traits that are not heritable, then there is no reason why these traits should increase in frequency over generations. In other words, natural selection does not simply state that "survivors survive" or "reproducers reproduce"; rather, it states that "survivors survive, reproduce and ''therefore'' propagate any ''heritable'' characters which have affected their survival and reproductive success". This statement is not tautological: it hinges on the [[testable]] hypothesis that such fitness-impacting heritable variations actually exist (a hypothesis that has been amply confirmed.)&lt;ref name=Corey/&gt;

Momme von Sydow suggested further definitions of 'survival of the fittest' that may yield a testable meaning in biology and also in other areas where Darwinian processes have been influential. However, much care would be needed to disentangle tautological from testable aspects. Moreover, an "implicit shifting between a testable and an untestable interpretation can be an illicit tactic to immunize natural selection ... while conveying the impression that one is concerned with testable hypotheses".&lt;ref name="crisp.psi.uni-heidelberg.de"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. von Sydow, M. (2012). ''[http://www.univerlag.uni-goettingen.de/content/list.php?cat=subject&amp;show=Biologie&amp;details=isbn-978-3-86395-006-4 From Darwinian Metaphysics towards Understanding the Evolution of Evolutionary Mechanisms: A Historical and Philosophical Analysis of Gene-Darwinism and Universal Darwinism]''. Universitätsverlag Göttingen.&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptic Society founder and ''[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]]'' magazine publisher [[Michael Shermer]] addresses the tautology problem in his 1997 book, ''[[Why People Believe Weird Things]]'', in which he points out that although tautologies are sometimes the beginning of science, they are never the end, and that scientific principles like natural selection are [[testable]] and [[falsifiable]] by virtue of their predictive power. Shermer points out, as an example, that population genetics accurately demonstrate when natural selection will and will not effect change on a population. Shermer hypothesizes that if [[hominid]] [[fossils]] were found in the same geological strata as [[trilobite]]s, it would be evidence against natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Shermer|Shermer, Michael]]; ''[[Why People Believe Weird Things]]''; 1997; Pages 143–144&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18160">'''Teleonomy''' is the quality of apparent purposefulness and goal-directedness of structures and functions in living organisms brought about by the exercise, augmentation, and, improvement of reasoning. The term derives from two [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words, τέλος ''telos'' ("end, purpose") and νόμος ''nomos'' ("law"), and means "end-directed"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/lynnhank/Mayr3.pdf |title=The Multiple Meanings of "Teleological" |last=Mayr |first=Ernst |date=1974 |journal=Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; (literally "purpose-law"). Teleonomy is sometimes contrasted with [[teleology in biology|teleology]], where the latter is understood as a purposeful goal-directedness brought about through human or divine intention. Teleonomy is thought to derive from [[evolution]]ary history, adaptation for reproductive success, and/or the operation of a program.  Teleonomy is related to programmatic or computational aspects of purpose.

== Relationship with teleology ==
{{further|Teleology in biology}}

[[Colin Pittendrigh]], who coined the term in 1958, applied it to biological phenomena that appear to be end-directed, hoping to limit the much older term [[teleology in biology|teleology]] to actions planned by an agent who can internally model alternative futures with [[intention]], purpose and foresight:
{{quote|Biologists for a while were prepared to say a turtle came ashore and laid its eggs. These verbal scruples were intended as a rejection of teleology but were based on the mistaken view that the efficiency of final causes is necessarily implied by the simple description of an end-directed mechanism. … The biologists long-standing confusion would be removed if all end-directed systems were described by some other term, e.g., 'teleonomic', in order to emphasize that recognition and description of end-directedness does not carry a commitment to Aristotelian teleology as an efficient causal principle.&lt;ref&gt;Pittendrigh, C. S.  "Adaptation, natural selection, and behavior", in ''Behavior and Evolution'', ed. A. Roe and [[George Gaylord Simpson]], New Haven: Yale University Press, 1958, 390–416; p. 394.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1965 [[Ernst Mayr]] cited Pittendrigh and criticized him for not making a "clear distinction between the two teleologies of Aristotle"; evolution involves Aristotle's [[material cause]]s and [[formal cause]]s rather than [[efficient cause]]s.&lt;ref name="causeandeffect"&gt;{{cite book |author=Mayr, Ernst |authorlink=Ernst Mayr |chapter=Cause and effect in biology |editor=Lerner, D. |title=Cause and effect |publisher=Free Press |location=New York |date=1965 |pages=33–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mayr adopted Pittendrigh's term, but supplied his own definition:{{quote|It would seem useful to rigidly restrict the term ''teleonomic'' to systems operating on the basis of a program of coded information. (p.42)}}

[[Richard Dawkins]] described the properties of "archeo-purpose" (by natural selection) and "neo-purpose" (by evolved adaptation) in his talk on the "Purpose of Purpose". Dawkins attributes the brain's flexibility as an evolutionary feature in adapting or subverting goals to making neo-purpose goals on an overarching evolutionary archeo-purpose. Language allows groups to share neo-purposes, and cultural evolution - occurring much faster than natural evolution - can lead to conflict or collaborations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://old.richarddawkins.net/videos/3956-the-purpose-of-purpose |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140121222125/http://old.richarddawkins.net/videos/3956-the-purpose-of-purpose |archivedate=2014-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[behavior analysis]], Hayne Reese made the [[adverbial]] distinction between purposefulness (having an internal determination) and purposiveness (serving or effecting a useful function).  Reese implies that non-teleological statements are called teleonomic when they represent an "if A then C" phenomenon's [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]]; where, teleology is a [[consequent]] representation. The concept of purpose, as only being the teleology final cause, requires supposedly impossible [[Temporal paradox|time reversal]]; because, the future consequent determines the present antecedent.  Purpose, as being both in the beginning and the end, simply rejects teleology, and addresses the time reversal problem. In this, Reese sees no value for teleology and teleonomic concepts in behavior analysis; however, the concept of purpose preserved in process can be useful, if not reified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url= https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2733687/pdf/behavan00023-0077.pdf | title=Teleology and Teleonomy in Behavior Analysis | author=Reese, Hayne W. | journal=The Behavior Analyst | date=1994 | volume=17 | issue=1 | pages=75–91 | pmc=2733687 | pmid=22478174}}&lt;/ref&gt; A theoretical time-dimensional tunneling and teleological functioning of [[temporal paradox]] would also fit this description without the necessity of a localized intelligence.  Whereas the concept of a teleonomic process, such as [[evolution]], can simply refer to a system capable of producing complex products without the benefit of a guiding foresight.

In 1966 [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] approved of the term in the last chapter of his ''Adaptation and Natural Selection; a critique of some current evolutionary thought''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Williams, G.C. |title=Adaptation and natural selection; a critique of some current evolutionary thought |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |location=Princeton, NJ |date=1966 |isbn=0-691-02615-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, [[Jacques Monod]], in ''[[Chance and Necessity]], an Essay on the Natural Philosophy of Modern Biology'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Monod, Jacques |title=Chance and Necessity: An Essay on the Natural Philosophy of Modern Biology |publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf]] |location=New York |date=1971 |isbn=0-394-46615-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested teleonomy as a key feature that defines life:

{{quote|Rather than reject this [goal-directedness] idea (as certain biologists have tried to do) it is indispensable to recognise that it is essential to the very definition of living beings. We shall maintain that the latter are distinct from all other structures or systems present in the universe through this characteristic property, which we shall call teleonomy.
[..] It will be readily seen that, in this or that species situated higher or lower on the animal scale, the achievement of the fundamental teleonomic project (i.e., invariant reproduction) calls assorted, more or less elaborate and complex structures and performances into play. The fact must be stressed that concerned here are not only the activities directly bound up with reproduction itself, but all those that contribute-be it very indirectly-to the species' survival and multiplication. For example, in higher mammals the play of the young is an important element of psychic development and social integration. Therefore this activity has teleonomic value, inasmuch as it furthers the cohesion of the group, a condition for its survival and for the expansion of the species.}}

In 1974 Ernst Mayr illustrated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mayr, E. |title=Teleological and Teleonomic, a New Analysis |journal=Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science |volume=14 |date=1974 |doi=10.1007/978-94-009-5345-1_10 |pages=133–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; the difference in the statements:

:: "The Wood Thrush migrates in the fall '''in order to escape''' the inclemency of the weather and the food shortages of the northern climates."

:: "The Wood Thrush migrates in the fall '''and thereby escapes''' the inclemency of the weather and the food shortages of the northern climates."

{{quote|If we replace the words ‘in order to escape’ by ‘and thereby escapes’, we leave the important question unanswered as to why the Wood Thrush migrates. The teleonomic form of the statement implies that the goal-directed migratory activity is governed by a program. By omitting this important message the second sentence is greatly impoverished as far as information content is concerned, without gaining in causal strength.}}

Subsequently, philosophers like [[Ernest Nagel]] further analysed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2025745 |author=Nagel, E. |title=Teleology Revisited: Goal-Directed Processes in Biology |jstor=2025745 |journal=Journal of Philosophy |volume=74 |issue=5 |pages=261–301 |date=1977 }} Reprinted in Allen, Bekoff &amp; Lauder, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; the concept of goal-directedness in biology and by 1982, philosopher and historian of science [[David Hull]] joked&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hull, D.L. |chapter=Philosophy and Biology |title=Philosophy of Science |pages=280–316 |volume=2 |editor=Fløistad, Guttorm |editor-link=Guttorm Fløistad |series=Contemporary Philosophy: A New Survey |publisher=Nijhoff |location=Hague |date=1982 |isbn=90-247-2518-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; about the use of teleology and teleonomy by biologists:

{{quote|Haldane [in the 1930s] can be found remarking, ‘Teleology is like a mistress to a biologist: he cannot live without her but he’s unwilling to be seen with her in public.’ Today the mistress has become a lawfully wedded wife. Biologists no longer feel obligated to apologize for their use of teleological language; they flaunt it. The only concession which they make to its disreputable past is to rename it ‘teleonomy’.}}

==Relationship to evolution==

The concept of teleonomy was largely developed by Mayr and Pittendrigh to separate biological evolution from teleology.  Pittendrigh's purpose was to enable biologists who had become overly cautious about goal-oriented language to have a way of discussing the goals and orientations of an organism's behaviors without inadvertently invoking teleology.  Mayr was even more explicit, saying that while teleonomy certainly operates on the level of organisms, the process of evolution itself is necessarily non-teleonomic.

{{quote|Mayr says, 'The existence of complex codes of information in the DNA of the germ plasm permits teleonomic purposiveness. On the other hand, evolutionary research has found no evidence whatsoever for a "goal-seeking" of evolutionary lines, as postulated in that kind of teleology which sees "plan and design" in nature. The harmony of the living universe, so far as it exists, is an a posteriori product of natural selection.&lt;ref name="causeandeffect" /&gt;}} This attitude towards the role of teleonomy in the evolutionary process is the consensus view of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3998/ptb.6959004.0002.003 |author=Merlin, F. |title=Evolutionary Chance Mutation: A Defense of the Modern Synthesis’ Consensus View |journal=Philosophy, Theory, and Practice in Biology |volume=2 |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolution largely hoards [[hindsight]], as variations unwittingly make "predictions" about structures and functions which could successfully cope with the future, and which participate in a process of natural selection that culls the unfit, leaving the fit to the next generation.  Information accumulates about functions and structures that are successful, exploiting [[feedback]] from the environment via the selection of fitter coalitions of structures and functions. [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]] has described these features as an [[anticipatory system]] which builds an internal model based on past and possible future states.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

In 1962, Grace A. de Laguna's "The Role of Teleonomy in Evolution" attempted to show how different stages of evolution were characterized by different types of teleonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/287855 |author=de Laguna |author2=Grace A. |title=The Role of Teleonomy in Evolution |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=117–131 |date=April 1962 |jstor=186539}}&lt;/ref&gt; de Laguna points out that humans have oriented teleonomy so that the teleonomic goal is not restricted to the reproduction of humans, but also to cultural ideals.

In recent years, a few biologists believe that the separation of teleonomy from the process of evolution has gone too far.  [[Peter Corning]] notes that behavior, which is a teleonomic trait, is responsible for the construction of biological niches, which is an agent of selection.  Therefore, it would be inaccurate to say that there was no role for teleonomy in the process of evolution, since teleonomy dictates the fitness landscape according to which organisms are selected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/bij.12061 |author=Corning, P. |title=Evolution ‘on purpose’: how behaviour has shaped the evolutionary process |journal=Journal of the Linnaean Society |volume=112 |pages=242–260 |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Holmes, B. |title=Life’s purpose: Can animals guide their own evolution? |journal=New Scientist |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Corning calls this phenomenon "teleonomic selection".

==Philosophy==
In teleology, [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s positions as expressed in [[Critique of Judgment]], were neglected for many years because in the minds of many scientists they were associated with [[Vitalism|vitalist]] views of evolution. Their recent rehabilitation is evident in teleonomy, which bears a number of features, such as the description of organisms, that are reminiscent of the Aristotelian conception of [[final cause]]s as essentially recursive in nature. Kant's position is that, even though we cannot know whether there are final causes in nature, we are constrained by the peculiar nature of the human understanding to view organisms teleologically. Thus the Kantian view sees teleology as a necessary principle for the study of organisms, but only as a regulative principle, and with no ontological implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding Purpose |last=Huneman |first=Philippe |date=2007 |publisher=University of Rochester Press |isbn= 1-58046-265-0 |pages= 1–37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Talcott Parsons]], in the later part of his working with a theory of [[social evolution]] and a related theory of world-history, adopted the concept of teleonomy as the fundamental organizing principle for directional processes and his theory of [[social development|societal development]] in general. In this way, Parsons tried to find a theoretical compromise between [[Voluntarism (action)|voluntarism]] as a principle of action and the idea of a certain directionality in history.

==Current status==

''' ''The Oil Drum'' ''' was a website devoted to analysis and discussion of  [[Energy (society)|energy]] and its impact on society that described itself as an "energy, peak oil &amp; sustainability research and news site".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Oil Drum |url=https://twitter.com/TheOilDrum |website=Twitter |publisher=Institute for the Study of Energy and Our Future |accessdate=28 September 2018 |quote=A web-based/interactive energy, peak oil &amp; sustainability research and news site; hosted by the nonprofit 501c3 Institute for the Study of Energy and Our Future}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Oil Drum'' was published by the Institute for the Study of Energy and Our Future, a Colorado non-profit corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Support The Oil Drum | publisher = The Oil Drum | date = 2009-04-22 | url = http://www.theoildrum.com/node/5134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was a resource for information on many energy and sustainability topics, including [[peak oil]], and related concepts such as [[oil megaprojects]], [[Hubbert linearization]], and the [[Export Land Model]].  ''The Oil Drum'' had over 25 online contributors from all around the globe. In 2013, the site ceased publishing new articles. As of October 2016, the site continues to function as an archive.

''The Oil Drum'' was rated one of the top five [[sustainability]] blogs of 2007 by [[Nielsen Online|Nielsen Netratings]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = ONLINE CONSUMERS CALL FOR GREATER TRANSPARENCY IN STRATEGIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, ACCORDING TO NIELSEN ONLINE | publisher = [[Nielsen Online]] | date = 2008-03-31 | url = http://www.netratings.com/pr/pr_080331.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was read by a diverse collection of public figures, including [[Roscoe Bartlett]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Bartlett | first = Roscoe | title = Congressional Record: PEAK OIL | date = 2008-02-28 | url = http://bartlett.house.gov/UploadedFiles/Spcl%20Order%20Bartlett%20Record%20Text%20022808.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080730215517/http://bartlett.house.gov/UploadedFiles/Spcl%20Order%20Bartlett%20Record%20Text%20022808.pdf | archivedate = 2008-07-30 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Krugman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Krugman | first = Paul | title = Commodity prices: Deja vu all over again | url = https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/19/commodity-prices-deja-vu-all-over-again/ | publisher = [[New York Times]] | date = 2008-04-19 | quote = …the peakers I read… }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Howard Kunstler]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Kunstler | first = James Howard | title = Jim Kunstler's Forecast 2007 | url = http://www.kunstler.com/Mags_Forecast2007.html | quote = …the web's best oil debate site… | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080620151002/http://www.kunstler.com/Mags_Forecast2007.html | archivedate = 2008-06-20 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Rainwater]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Ryan | first = Oliver | title = The Rainwater Prophecy | publisher = [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] | date = 2005-12-26 | url = http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/12/26/8364646/ }} Reference appears in print version only; corroborated by http://allfinancialmatters.com/2005/12/20/read-what-richard-rainwater-reads-oil-blogs/ .&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Radiohead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = DEAD AIR SPACE | publisher = [[Radiohead]] | url = http://www.radiohead.com/deadairspace/ | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070816032443/http://www.radiohead.com/deadairspace/ | archivedate = 2007-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the site received the [[M.

In 2013, The Oil Drum announced that it would stop publishing new content and would turn into an archive resource. Reasons cited for this change include server costs and a dwindling number of contributors of high-quality content.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theoildrum.com/node/10059&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tudi Gong (1).jpg|thumb|A large statue of Tudigong at the Hongludi Temple in [[Zhonghe District]], [[Taiwan]].]]

'''Tudigong''' (土地公 "Lord of the Soil and the Ground") or '''Tudishen''' (土地神 "God of the Soil and the Ground"), also known simply as '''Tudi''' (土地 "Soil-Ground") is a [[tutelary deity]] of a locality and the human communities who inhabit it in [[Chinese folk religion]].&lt;ref name="sbnum"&gt;The Encyclopedia of Malaysia, vol. Religions &amp; Beliefs, edited by Prof. Dr M. Kamal Hassan &amp; Dr. Ghazali bin Basri. {{ISBN|981-3018-51-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
Other names of the god include:&lt;ref&gt;Keith G. Stevens, Chinese Mythological Gods, Oxford University Press, USA, (November 8, 2001), pages 60, 68, 70, {{ISBN|0-19-591990-4}} or {{ISBN|978-0-19-591990-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tugong (土公 "Lord of the Soil");
* Tudiye (土地爷 "Soil-Ground Father");
* Dabogong (大伯公 "Great Elder Lord") or Bogong (伯公 "Elder Lord");
* Sheshen (社神 "God of the Soil") or Shegong (社公 "Lord of the Soil");
* Tudijun (土帝君 "Ruler God of the Soil").

Extended titles of the god include:
* Tudihuofushen (土地或福神 "God who May Bless the Soil");
* Fudezhengshen (福德正神 "Right God of Blessing and Virtue") or Fudegong (福德公 "Lord of Blessing and Virtue").

Commoners often call Tudigong "grandfather" (''yeye''), which reflects his close relationship with the common people.&lt;ref name="sbnum"/&gt;

==Variants==
===Tudipo===
In the countryside, he is sometimes given a wife, ''Tǔdìpó'' (土地婆 "Grandmother of the Soil and the Ground"), placed next to him on the altar. She may be seen as a just and benevolent deity on the same rank as her husband, or as a grudging old woman holding back her husband's benedictions, which explains why one does not always receive fair retribution for good behaviour.&lt;ref name="sbnum"/&gt;

Another story says that Tudipo is supposed to be a young lady. After Tudigong received a heavenly rank, he gave everything that the people asked for. When one of the gods went down to Earth to do inspections, he saw that Tudigong was distributing blessings unnecessarily. Soon after that, the god went to the Celestial Palace and reported to the [[Jade Emperor]].&lt;ref name="sbnum"/&gt;

After the Jade Emperor knew this, he found out that there was a lady that was going to be killed, but she was not guilty. Thus, the Jade Emperor told a god to go down to Earth and bring the lady to heaven. When the lady was brought to the Celestial Palace, the Jade Emperor bestowed her to Tudigong as his wife. She was ordered to look after how many blessings Tudigong distributes and that they not be unnecessarily distributed. This is why many people do not want to pay respect to Tudipo, because they are afraid that she will not let Tudigong give lots of wealth to them.&lt;ref name="sbnum"/&gt;

===Dizhushen===
The Landlord God ({{zh|c=[[:zh:地主神|地主神]]|p=Dìzhǔ shén}}) is a deity worshipped in Chinese folk beliefs who is analogous but is not to be confused with Tudigong. The tablet for the Landlord God is typically inscribed with (middle two rows) "left: The Earth God of Overseas [[Han Chinese#Names|Tang]] People ([[overseas Chinese]]; 唐番地主財神), right: The Dragon of Five Sides and Five Lands (五方五土龍神; [[fengshui]]). The side inscriptions mean "The wealth comes from ten thousand directions and the business comes from thousands of miles." It is believed that the Landlord God has powers to help gather wealth, and the position of the tablet must be placed properly according to the laws of fengshui.&lt;ref name="sbnum"/&gt;

===Village Gods===
The Village God has developed from land worship. Before [[Chenghuangshen]] ("City God") became more prominent in China, land worship had a hierarchy of deities conforming strictly to social structure, in which the emperor, kings, dukes, officials and common people were allowed to worship only the land gods within their command; the highest land deity was the [[Houtu]] ("Queen of the Earth").

Ranked lower than City Gods, the Village Gods have been very popular among villagers as the grassroot deities since the 14th century during the [[Ming dynasty]]. Some scholars speculate that this change came because of an imperial edict, because it is reported that the [[Hongwu Emperor]] of the Ming dynasty was born in a Village God shrine. The image of the Village God is that of a simply clothed, smiling, white-bearded man. His wife, the Grandmother of the Village, looks like a normal old lady.&lt;ref name="sbnum"/&gt;

==Festivals==
In Taiwan, festivals dedicated to Tudigong typically take place on the second day of the second month and the 15th day of the eighth month on the Chinese lunar calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taiwanpedia.culture.tw/en/content?ID=4437&amp;Keyword=%E5%9C%9F%E5%9C%B0%E5%85%AC|title=Earth God|last=Cheng|first=Shuiping|year=2011|work=Encyclopedia of Taiwan|publisher=Council for Cultural Affairs|accessdate=24 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120720013817/http://taiwanpedia.culture.tw/en/content?ID=4437&amp;Keyword=%E5%9C%9F%E5%9C%B0%E5%85%AC|archivedate=20 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wiktionary|Wastage}}
'''Wastage''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] term used during the [[First World War]]. It was used to describe the losses experienced during the war that occurred during times when no [[infantry]] attack was taking place. Wastage was deaths as a result of [[Artillery|artillery fire]] on soldiers who were manning their own [[Trench|trenches]], not actively attacking the enemy's trenches. On the "quietest days" of the war, the British were losing 7,000 men killed and wounded per day to wastage. Even during major battles, wastage could often exceed casualties suffered during an [[Infantry Attacks|infantry attack]]. Such was the case at [[Battle of Passchendaele|3rd Ypres]] and other major battles, especially later in the war.

'''Wind power in Asia''' is an important component in the [[Asia]]n energy industry and one of the key sources of [[renewable energy]] in the region. As of April 2016, the installed capacity of wind power in Asia (excluding the Middle East) totalled 175,831 MW.&lt;ref name="GWEC-2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gwec.net/wp-content/uploads/vip/GWEC-Global-Wind-2015-Report_April-2016_22_04.pdf |title=Global Wind Report 2014 - Annual Market Update |date=22 April 2016 |accessdate=23 May 2016 |format=PDF |work=report |publisher=GWEC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asia is the fastest growing region in terms of wind energy, having increased its installed capacity by 33,858 MW in 2005 (a 24% increase over 2014). [[Wind power in China|China]], with 145,362 MW of installed capacity, is the world's largest generator of electricity from wind energy. [[Wind power in India|India]] is the second largest in Asia with an installed capacity of 25,088 MW.&lt;ref name="GWEC-2015" /&gt; Other key countries include [[Wind power in Japan|Japan]] (1,394 MW), Taiwan (188 MW), South Korea (173 MW) and the [[Wind power in the Philippines|Philippines]] (33 MW).&lt;ref name="auswind.org"&gt;[http://www.auswind.org/auswea/downloads/mediareleases/GlobalMarketboomJan%202007.pdf Global wind energy markets continue to boom – 2006 another record year]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5116">The annual '''Dick Goddard Woollybear Festival''' is held every Fall in downtown [[Vermilion, Ohio]], on [[Lake Erie]]. The one-day, family event, which began in 1973, features a woolly bear costume contest in which children, even pets, are dressed up as various renditions of the [[woolly bear caterpillar]].

The festival is held every year around October 1 on a Sunday on which the [[Cleveland Browns]] have an away game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Tales from the Road: Memoirs from a Lifetime of Ohio Travel, Television, and More |first=Neil |last=Zurcher |authorlink=Neil Zurcher |coauthors= |date=2010 |publisher=Gray &amp; Co |series= |location=Cleveland |isbn=1598510649 |page=273 |quote=One of the little-known facts about the Woollybear Festival is how its date is chosen each year. Goddard has worked for many seasons as the [[statistician]] for all home games of the Cleveland Browns. He waits until he sees the team's schedule each fall, then picks the Sunday in late September or early October that the Browns are playing out of town. That becomes Woollybear Sunday. }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is touted as the largest one-day festival in Ohio.&lt;ref name="woollybear"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sites.google.com/site/vermilionohiochamberofcommerce/woollybear-festival-parade |title=Vermilion Ohio Woollybear Festival Official Website |accessdate=2012-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Suzanne |last=Stratford |title=40th Annual Woollybear Fest Preps Underway |url=http://fox8.com/2012/09/25/40th-annual-woollybear-fest-preps-underway/ |publisher=[[WJW (TV)|WJW-TV]] |date=2012-09-25 |accessdate=2012-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The festival is the brainchild of legendary [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] TV personality [[Dick Goddard]], former retired longtime weatherman at [[WJW-TV]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fox8.com/author/dickgoddardfox8news/ Dick Goddard]. ''Fox8.com''. Retrieved on 2012-04-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sarah |last=Crump |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Dick Goddard is most sunny when it's 70: My Cleveland |url=http://www.cleveland.com/mycleveland/index.ssf/2009/05/dick_goddard_is_most_sunny_whe.html |work=[[The Plain Dealer]] |publisher= |date=2009-05-04 |accessdate=2012-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In much the same way [[Punxsutawney Phil]] is celebrated in the century-old tradition of [[Groundhog Day]] in which he predicts the end of winter, the Woolly Bear Caterpillar is similarly celebrated for its mythical association to winter forecasting.&lt;ref name="woollybear"/&gt;  After the caterpillars' eggs hatch in Fall, folklore suggests the severity of an upcoming winter can be gauged by observing the amount of black versus orange in the caterpillars' bands.

In later years, the event organizers have promoted the event as the "Dick Goddard Woollybear Festival" to honor Goddard's legacy.

According to the festival's website:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''In 1972 the newly elected officers of the Parent Teachers Association at the Firelands-Florence Township Elementary School in the tiny community of Birmingham in Erie County were looking around for a vehicle to raise funds.  They heard about Goddard’s idea of a Woollybear Festival.  They contacted him and offered to stage the festival with his help.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The first Woollybear Festival was held in Birmingham and attracted perhaps 2,000 people.  The parade was short—just the Firelands High School Band, some boy scouts and the local fire department, along with personalities from TV8—and they decided to go around the parade route twice, just to make it look longer.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Attracting 2,000 spectators in the first year, the number grew to an estimated 15,000 by the eighth festival and quickly overwhelmed the town of [[Birmingham, Erie County, Ohio|Birmingham]].  Of the 13 cities that expressed interest, organizers selected Vermilion as the new home.&lt;ref name="woollybear"/&gt;

The parade in 2006 involved over 20 marching bands, 2,000 marchers, hundreds of animals, and over 100,000 spectators.&lt;ref name="woollybear"/&gt;

The "Woollybear 500" is a race that starts off with the Chief of police and the Chief of fire selecting individual woollybears and racing against each other.  The woollybears are obtained by the Vermilion Chamber and details of the training and skills of said woollybears are not divulged to the participants.  The race is monitored by professionals from TV-8.  No woollybears are harmed in the participation of these races.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1955">'''Xrafstar''' or '''Khrafstra''' ({{lang-ae|xrafstra-}}; {{lang-pal|xrafstar}}) is a cover term in [[Zoroastrianism]] for the animals that are harmful or repulsive. They were considered creations of the Evil Spirit [[Angra Mainyu]] and killing them was seen as meritorious.{{sfn|Boyce|1979|p=44}} In the [[Young Avesta]] and Middle Persian texts, the class of xrafstars includes frogs, reptiles, scorpions and insects like ants or wasps, whereas predators such as the wolf are not referred to as xrafstars, even though they too are considered to be creations of evil.{{sfn|Moazami|2015}}

[[Herodotus]] narrates about the practice of killing xrafstars among the Magi: "The Magi are a very peculiar race, different entirely from the Egyptian priests, and indeed from all other men whatsoever. The Egyptian priests make it a point of religion not to kill any live animals except those which they offer in sacrifice. The Magi, on the contrary, kill animals of all kinds with their own hands, excepting dogs and men. They even seem to take a delight in the employment, and kill, as readily as they do other animals, ants and snakes, and such like flying or creeping things".&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/ancient/herodotus-persians.asp "On The Customs of the Persians"]&lt;/ref&gt;
