'''1996 Amarnath Yatra tragedy''' is referred to the deaths of over 250 pilgrims in 1996 in [[Jammu and Kashmir]] state in [[India]] due to bad weather. The pilgrims were on annual pilgrimage ([[Yatra]]) to [[Amarnath Temple|Amarnath]] shrine.

The Government had banned the Amarnath Yatra from 1991 to 1995 due to threats from militants. In 1996 the militants had assured that they would not interfere with the yatra. So the number of pilgrims in  1996 were higher than usual. 
Between, August 21 and 25 1996  about one lakh (100,000) yatris were simultaneously moving either up or down between  [[Jammu]] and the Amarnath. 

During this period there was unusually heavy snowfall along with severe blizzards along the yatra route. Nearly 242 yatris lost their lives due to exhaustion, exposure, freezing, etc.

[[Jammu &amp; Kashmir National Conference|National Conference]] government constituted a committee  headed by the retired [[Indian Administrative Service|IAS]] officer Dr. Nitish Sengupta which was asked to inquire into various aspects of the tragedy and suggest measures and remedies to avoid recurrence of such incidents in future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2001/20010624/spectrum/travel.htm |title=The Sunday Tribune - Spectrum - Travel |publisher=Tribuneindia.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5639">'''Abu 'Isa''' (also known as '''''Ovadiah''''', '''Ishaq ibn Ya'qub al-Isfahani''', '''Isaac ibn Jacob al-Isfahani''') was a self-proclaimed [[Prophet#Judaism|Jewish prophet]] sometime in the 8th century AD in [[Persia]] and the leader of a short-lived revolt. Proclaimed by some of his followers to be the [[Messiah in Judaism|Messiah]], Abu Isa himself never made such claims or inferences. He seems to have allied himself with Sunbadh after the assassination of Abu Muslim in 755 ad. His forces fought Caliph Al Mansur army at Rayy only to be defeated and Abu Isa fell in this battle. 

==Dating issues==
The dating of Abu Isa's career has been disputed since the Middle Ages. The two main sources for information of him are [[Jacob Qirqisani|Qirqisani]], a Jewish [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] historian; and [[Muhammad al-Shahrastani|Shahrastani]], who wrote an extensive guide to Jewish sects over the ages. Qirqisani places the events in the reign of the [[Umayyad]] [[Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] (685 - 705 CE) while Shahrastani says it began under the reign of [[Marwan II]] (744 - 750) on through to [[Al-Mansur]] (d. 775). Qirqisani's dates place Abu Isa's uprising during Umayyad clashes with the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] which would coincide with Messianic stories of the battle between [[Gog and Magog]] and place it early enough to influence [[Karaite Judaism|Karaism]]; Shahrastani's would put the revolt at the end of the Umayyad Dynasty and thus at a pivotal point of upheaval in the [[Muslim history|Muslim world]].&lt;ref name="Friedlaender"&gt;Israel Friedlaender Shiitic Elements in Jewish Sectarianism ''Jewish Quarterly Review'' Oct 1910&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wasserstrom"&gt;Steven Wasserstrom ''Between Muslim and Jew'' Princeton University Press 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Both are plausible and there is no direct Isawite documentation.

The Turkish scholar Halil Ibrahim Bulut in 2004 has shown that Shahrastani's 'Abbasid date is more likely.&lt;ref&gt;Halil Ibrahim Bulut, "ISEVIYYE (Islam Dunyasinda Ortaya Cikan Ilk Yahudi Mezhebi)", Ekev Academic Review, 8.18 (Jan. 2004) 297-318&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
Abu Isa believed that he was the last of five heralds from God announcing the imminent arrival of the [[messiah]]. Never did he claim to be the Messiah himself, but some of his followers felt that he would return after his death and bring the [[End Times]]. He made some minor alterations to the general set of [[Rabbinic literature|Rabbinic laws]] and his followers became [[asceticism|ascetic]] in their manners. The most radical of the Isawite beliefs was the acceptance of both [[Jesus]] and [[Muhammad]] as true prophets, but only to their own peoples. 
*Other alterations included:
**Banning of the consumption of [[wine]] and [[meat]] at certain times;
**Sunnah [[Jewish prayers|prayers]] to 7 or 10 depending on the source&lt;ref&gt;Israel Friedlaender Shiitic Elements in Jewish Sectarianism ''Jewish Quarterly Review'' Oct 1912&lt;/ref&gt; (in addition to the standard 3);
**Affirmation of the Shammai stance on [[divorce]];
**Belief that Alnabi is a collection of [[rabbi|Hakham]]s;&lt;ref&gt;Bulut, 301-2&lt;/ref&gt;

The ban on meat is actually a [[Talmud]]ic reference to not eating meat in exile, while the additional prayers are usually explained by noting [[Psalms|Psalm]] 119:164.

==Miracles==
Two major [[miracle]]s are attributed to Abu Isa. The first stems from his writings, as he was known to his followers as nothing but an illiterate tailor before he was touched with prophecy. He is said to have thus produced the works that outline the beliefs above and herald the coming of the [[Messianic age]]. The other is during the revolt itself when he defended his followers from the Caliphate's forces behind a line drawn on the ground with a [[Myrtus|myrtle]] branch, at which point he rode out and singlehandedly defeated the first assault by the Muslims.

==Possible connection to Shi'ism==
 	
The arrival of Abu Isa comes at an interesting point in the history of the Jews and the Muslims. Regardless of the which dates are true, each could be seen as during the rise of the radical [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]] movements in Islam. With the center of these movements being Iraq and later Persia, it should come as no surprise that the other [[ahl al-kitab]] or "People of the Book" might be influenced. Some Jews actually saw the coming of the Arabs as the [[apocalypse]] that would usher in the new age, but there are distinctive influences that can be noted in this movement from Shi'ism. The idea of the illiterate prophet is equated with the story of Muhammad and his receiving of the [[Qur'an]] while the idea of a chain of prophets is notably similar to the Imams and the foreseen coming of the [[Mahdi]]. Scholars disagree to what degree Shi'ism affected Abu Isa or whether Shi'ism was at the same time developing and incorporating Jewish elements.&lt;ref name="Friedlaender"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wasserstrom"/&gt; However, issues with this include that Shi'a reject the belief Muhammad was unlettered, Imams [[ismah|are infallible]], that Shi'ism did not expect the immediate return of al-Mahdi, and that [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]] were not primarily Shi'a until a few centuries ago.

The '''Ambubachi Mela''' ({{IPA|/ˈæmbʊˌbɑ:ʧɪ,ˌæmbʊˈbɑ:ʧɪ ˈmeɪlə, mi:lə/}}) is an annual Hindu [[mela]] held at [[Kamakhya Temple]] in [[Guwahati]], [[Assam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ambubachi Puja and Mela 2015 at Kamakhya Temple|url=http://www.kamakhyadham.com/ambubachi-puja-and-mela-2015-at-kamakhya-temple/|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This yearly mela is celebrated during the [[monsoon]] season that happens to fall during the Assamese month ''[[Aashaadha|Ahaar]]'', around the middle of June when sun transit to the zodiac of [[Gemini (astrology)|Mithuna]], when the [[Brahmaputra river]] is in spate.&lt;ref name="ab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boloji.com/wfs/wfs082.htm|title=Celebrating The Divine Female Principle|last=Chawla|first=Janet|date=16 September 2002|publisher=Boloji.com|accessdate=24 December 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131031243/http://boloji.com/wfs/wfs082.htm|archivedate=31 January 2010|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bharatonline.com/assam/fairs/ambubachi-mela.html|title=Ambubachi Fair|publisher=Bharatonline.com|accessdate=24 December 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100106141221/http://www.bharatonline.com/assam/fairs/ambubachi-mela.html| archivedate= 6 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ef"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://360degreeworld.com/tantrics-flock-to-mystic-fair-of-assam/|title=A Mystic Festival To Draw Thousands|last=Admin|date=17 September 2009|publisher=360degreeworld.com|accessdate=24 December 2009|archive-url=https://archive.is/20091024095248/http://360degreeworld.com/tantrics-flock-to-mystic-fair-of-assam/|archive-date=24 October 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the celebration of the yearly [[menstruation]] course of goddess [[Kamakhya]].&lt;ref name="ab" /&gt; It is believed that the presiding goddess of the temple, Devi Kamakhya, the Mother [[Shakti]], goes through her annual cycle of [[menstruation]] during this time stretch.&lt;ref name="cd" /&gt; It is also believed that during the monsoon rains the creative and nurturing power of the 'menses' of [[Prithvi|Mother Earth]] becomes accessible to devotees at this site during the mela. There is no idol of the presiding deity but she is worshipped in the form of a [[yoni]]-like stone instead over which a natural spring flows.&lt;ref name="ab" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cd" /&gt;

==Tantric fertility festival==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:sadhus&amp;ambubachimela.jpg|thumb|A group of Sadhus, a common scene in the mela.]] --&gt;
This mela is also known as '''Ameti''' or '''Tantric fertility festival''' since it is closely associated with Tantric [[Shakti]] cult prevalent in eastern parts of [[India]]. Even some Tantric Babas make their public appearances only during these four days. The rest of the year, they remain in seclusion. Some Babas are seen displaying their psychic powers like putting their heads in a pit and stand upright on it, standing on one leg for hours at a stretch.&lt;ref name="ef" /&gt;

==The mela==
[[File:Ambubachi Mela by Vikramjit Kakati.jpg|thumb|Gathering of people at Ambubashi Mela at India's Kamakhya Temple]]
The temple remains closed for three days during the mela&lt;ref name="ab" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cd" /&gt; for it is believed that mother earth becomes unclean for three days like the traditional women's menstrual seclusion. During these three days some restrictions are observed by the devotees like not cooking, not performing puja or reading holy books, no farming etc.&lt;ref name="ab" /&gt; After three days devi Kamakhya is bathed and other rituals are performed to ensure that the devi retrieves her purity.&lt;ref name="cd" /&gt; Then the doors of the temple are reopened&lt;ref name="ab" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cd" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ef" /&gt; and [[prasad]] is distributed.&lt;ref name="ab" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ef" /&gt; On the fourth day the devotees are allowed to enter the temple and worship devi Kamakhya. In 2016, the dates of the Ambubachi festival were between 22 and 26 June. &lt;ref name="cd" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ef" /&gt; In 2017, the dates of the Ambubachi mela were between 22 and 
26 June.&lt;ref name="gh"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ambabuchi Mela 2017 |url=http://kamiyasindoor.com/Kamakhya-Temple-Mela-Dates.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The prasad===
The [[prasad]] is distributed in two forms – Angodak and Angabastra. Angodak literally means the fluid part of the body - water from the spring and Angabastra literally means the cloth covering the body - a piece of the red cloth used to cover the stone [[yoni]] during the days of menstruation.&lt;ref name="ab" /&gt;

==Pilgrims==
[[File:Ambubachi Mela at Kamakhya Temple by Vikramjit Kakati.jpg|thumb|Sadhus gathered at Kamakhya Temple for the Ambubachi Mela]]
Every year lakhs of pilgrims, starting from ''[[Sadhu]]''s to householders, from all over India, come to Guwahati to observe this festival. They include ''[[Sanyasin]]''s, black clad [[Aghori|Aghora]]s, the ''Khade-baba''s, the ''[[Baul]]'' or singing minstrels of West Bengal, intellectual and folk ''Tantrik''s, ''[[Sadhu]]''s and ''[[Sadhvi]]''s with long matted hair etc.&lt;ref name="ab" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ef" /&gt; Even foreigners from abroad come to seek blessings of mother Kamakhya.&lt;ref name="ef" /&gt;

'''August Jam''' was an outdoor concert held on Saturday, August 10, 1974, at the [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] outside [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], in the [[United States]]. The concert promoter was Kaleidoscope Productions and it was sponsored by radio stations WAYS and WROQ.  The concert featured [[The Allman Brothers Band]], [[Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer]], [[Foghat]], [[Black Oak Arkansas]], [[The Marshall Tucker Band]], [[The Ozark Mountain Daredevils]], [[Premiata Forneria Marconi|PFM]], [[Grinderswitch]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmanbrothersband.com/index.php?module=My_eGallery&amp;do=showpic&amp;gid=37&amp;pid=3455&amp;orderby=dateD Scan of Newspaper Ad for Concert]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] were booked to play but canceled.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} It was the largest concert ever held in the state of [[North Carolina]] and one of the largest in the U.S. at that time, with an estimated attendance in excess of 200,000.&lt;ref&gt;Fielden, Greg: ''Charlotte Motor Speedway'', page 72. MBI Publishing, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The November 1974 issue of ''Circus'' magazine had this to say about Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer's performance:&lt;ref&gt;November 1974 issue of ''Circus'' magazine - "ELP - ON TOUR WITH THE SHOW THAT NEVER ENDS&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|Emerson, Lake and Palmer performed an operation on the U.S. this summer... In Charlotte, North Carolina, the feedback fiends caused double-trouble with the hot boogie chefs, The Allman Brothers, in what was billed as an August Jam. The fans were so blitzed by the groups' powerhouse sets they sat dazed in their automobiles after the show and jammed Charlotte traffic for hours.}}
 
There was a limited number{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=July 2015}} of tickets sold prior to the concert, and when many thousands of additional fans showed up on the day of the performances, those thousands proceeded to crash the fences and rush to the infield. Many of the facilities were overwhelmed due to the crowds, and the weather did not cooperate either, producing a sporadic rain that drenched the concert goers, and turned the infield into a muddy quagmire. However, the music went on as scheduled.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The '''Best Illusion of the Year Contest''' is an annual recognition of the world's illusion creators awarded by the [[Neural Correlate Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://illusionoftheyear.com/about-the-contest/|title=About the Contest|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contest was created in 2005 by professors [[Susana Martinez-Conde]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smc.neuralcorrelate.com|title=The Martinez-Conde Lab|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stephen Macknik]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://macknik.neuralcorrelate.com|title=The Stephen Macknik Lab|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the European conference on Visual Perception in [[A Coruña
|La Coruna, Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visionsciences.org/satellite_events.htm |title=Vision Sciences Society Satellite Events |accessdate=30 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008054016/http://www.visionsciences.org/satellite_events.htm |archivedate= 8 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since transitioned to an online contest where everyone in the world is invited to [http://illusionoftheyear.com/about-the-contest/submission-instructions/ submit illusions] and vote for the winner.

The contest decides on the most impressive [[perceptual or cognitive illusion]] of the year (unpublished, or published no earlier than the year prior to the most recent competition). An illusion is a perceptual or cognitive experience that does not match the physical reality (i.e. the perception of motion where no such motion physically exists).

As human experience is generated indirectly by brain mechanisms that interact with the physical reality, the  study of illusions offers insight into the neural bases of perception and cognition. The community includes [[neuroscientists]], [[ophthalmologists]], [[neurologists]], and [[visual artists]] that create illusions to help discover the neural underpinnings of illusory perception.

The Best Illusion of the Year Contest consists of three stages: submission, initial review, and voting of winners. The initial review is conducted by a panel of  judges who are world experts in the science, art, and science education. The judge panel narrows the submissions to the Top Ten finalists, and viewers from all over the world can vote for the winner online. The top three winners receive cash awards.

== Neural Correlate Society ==

The Neural Correlate Society (NCS) is a [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] 501(c)3 organization that promotes research into the [[neural bases]] of perception and cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neuralcorrelate.com/|title=Neural Correlate Society|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization serves a community of [[neuroscientists]], [[ophthalmologists]], [[neurologists]], and [[artists]] who use a variety of methods to help discover the underpinnings of the human experience.

The NCS hosts a variety of events, including the  Best Illusion of the Year Contest, that highlight important new discoveries to the public.

{{Islamic culture}}
The '''Bishwa Ijtema''' ({{lang-bn|বিশ্ব ইজতেমা}}, meaning Global Congregation) is an annual gathering of [[Muslims]] in [[Tongi]], by the banks of the River [[Turag]], in the outskirts of [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]]. It is one of the [[List of largest peaceful gatherings in history|largest peaceful gatherings in the world]]. The Ijtema is a prayer meeting spread over three days, during which attending devotees perform daily prayers while listening to scholars reciting and explaining verses from the [[Quran]]. It culminates in the ''Akheri Munajat'', or the Final Prayer, in which millions of devotees raise their hands in front of Allah (God) and pray for [[world peace]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Akheri Munajat ends seeking world peace |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/country/biswa-ijtema-akheri-munajat-begins-199777 |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ijtema is considered a demonstration of Muslim unity, solidarity, mutual love and respect and an opportunity to reiterate their commitment to Islamic values.&lt;ref name="banglapedia.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Viswa_Ijtema|title=Viswa Ijtema - Banglapedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ijtema is non-political and therefore it draws people of all persuasion. It is attended by devotees from 150 countries.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; The majority of its devotees come from across Bangladesh, the world's third largest Muslim majority country.

Speakers include Islamic scholars from various countries. Bishwa Ijtema is now the second largest Islamic gatherings with 5 million adherents &lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;, after the [[Arba'een Pilgrimage]] (15-20 Million attendees),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/arbaeen-pilgrimage-kerbala-shia-isis-defeat-muslims-thousands-killed-middle-east-iraq-najaf-a8046621.html|title=Free at last from Isis, millions of Muslims stage the greatest religious march in the world|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; surpassing the 2-3 million worshipers that perform the [[Hajj]] in Saudi Arabia (which is one of the five pillars of Islam for Muslims).

==Etymology==
''Ijtema'' is an [[Arabic]] word which means public gathering.&lt;ref name="banglapedia.org"/&gt; In [[Bengali language|Bengali]], the event is known as the "Bishwa Ijtema". ''Bishwa'' is a Bengali word which means world.

==Organization==
The event is organized in January by the Bangladeshi branch of the [[Tablighi Jamaat]], an orthodox [[Sunni]] movement. The congregation takes place in an area which spans over five square kilometers in [[Tongi]], an outer suburb north of Dhaka.&lt;ref name="banglapedia.org"/&gt; An extensive [[tent]] is created in the area with the help of the [[Government of Bangladesh]]. Transport is provided by state-run companies, including [[Biman Bangladesh Airlines]], the [[Bangladesh Railway]] and the [[Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation]] (BRTC). The [[Bangladesh Armed Forces]] assists by arranging infrastructure. Despite the large number of devotees living within a confined space, generally there are very few problems of sanitation, cooking, and internal movements. It is believed to be possible because of the minimalist approach adopted by the devotees. Devotees reduce their own requirements and develop a respect for others' requirements. During the Final Prayer, huge crowds stretch from the Ijtema ground in Tongi into the Dhaka metropolitan area. Schools and offices are declared closed on the occasion.

==History==
The Bengali Tabhlighi Jamaat movement started in Dhaka, [[East Bengal]] during the 1950s. The first Ijtemas were organized in [[Chittagong]] (1954) and [[Narayanganj]] (1958), followed by Ijtemas at the [[Ramna Race Course]] in Dhaka in 1960, 1962 and 1965.&lt;ref name="banglapedia.org"/&gt; Due to the increasing rate of participants, the government of East Pakistan allowed organizers to schedule the event annually by the River Turag in 1967.&lt;ref name="banglapedia.org"/&gt; Later, the government of Bangladesh allotted 160 acres of land for exclusively holding the event.&lt;ref name="banglapedia.org"/&gt;

==Number of devotees==
In 2001, the number of attendees was 2 million.&lt;ref name="banglapedia.org"/&gt; In 2010, the number was 5 million.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;

===Foreign devotees===
Estimates of foreign devotees stands at 20,000-50,000. They come from various regions, including the South Asian [[Subcontinent]], [[Russia]] and [[Central Asia]], [[Europe]], [[Southeast Asia]], the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Millions of Muslims gather in Bangladesh|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-bangladesh-religion-ijtema-idUKDHA10181920070202 |work=Reuters |date=2 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="banglapedia.org"/&gt;

==Overcrowding and weather==
Due to increasing overcrowding, the Ijtema was divided into two segments with an interval of seven days from 2010.&lt;ref name="banglapedia.org"/&gt; The first phase is allowed for devotees from 32 designated Bangladeshi districts. The second phase allows devotees from the remaining districts of the country.&lt;ref name="banglapedia.org"/&gt; Foreign devotees are allowed in both phases.

Due to increasing overcrowding, the Ijtema was divided into four segments from 2015. The first phase is allowed for devotees from 16 designated Bangladeshi districts. The second phase allows devotees from another 16 designated Bangladeshi districts. Devotees from the remaining 32 districts of the countrywill join next year.

In 2008, the event had to be cut short to only one day due to rain and cold weather which left three attendees dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sarkar |first=Kailash |date=26 January 2008 |title=Ijtema cut short for inclement weather |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-20631 |newspaper=The Daily Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with other Muslim gatherings==
Unlike the [[Hajj]], the Ijtema is not one of the five pillars of Islam. Other major congregations in the Muslim world include [[Shia]] pilgrimages in [[Karbala]].

"'''Bloody Mary'''" is the fourteenth episode in the [[South Park (season 9)|ninth season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]''. The 139th overall episode of the series, it originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on December 7, 2005. In the episode, [[Randy and Sharon Marsh|Randy]] [[Driving under the influence|drives drunk]] and loses his driver's license. He is then ordered to attend [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meetings, where he becomes convinced that his [[alcoholism]] is a potentially fatal disease. Meanwhile, a statue of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] starts bleeding "out its ass" and Randy believes that he can be "cured" if it bleeds on him.

== Plot ==
[[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and [[Ike Broflovski|Ike]] attend [[karate]] class while Stan's dad [[Randy and Sharon Marsh|Randy]] goes for a couple of drinks. After class, an inebriated Randy drives the boys home, but he gets pulled over and arrested for [[drunk driving]]. Randy gets his license revoked and is ordered to perform community service and to attend [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], where he's introduced to the [[twelve-step program]], which leads him to believe he is powerless to control his drinking and that alcoholism is a disease. Randy, whom Stan describes as a "[[hypochondriac]]", then begins to drink more, since he has decided that he is in fact powerless to control it and cannot stop. Meanwhile, a statue of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] starts to bleed "out its ass" and people begin to flock around it to find a cure for their diseases. Randy believes it can cure his disease.

Randy has Stan drive him to the church where the statue is, and after [[cutting in line]], arguing that his "disease" is worse than that of others, he is drenched in the holy blood. He jumps up and declares that he will not drink any more, and abstains from alcohol for five days.

[[Pope Benedict XVI]] comes to investigate, and discovers that the blood is not actually coming from the statue's [[anus]], but from its [[vagina]]. Since "[[Menstrual cycle|chicks bleed out their vaginas all the time]]", this is no miracle. Randy, disappointed, realizes that [[God]] did not "heal" him. At first he again declares himself powerless, and most of the other recovering alcoholics agree and rush to the bar. But Stan follows Randy and convinces him that if God did not help him, then he must have managed to stop by himself. 

Randy declares that he will never drink again. Stan objects to this too, claiming that if Randy completely avoids drinking, then drinking is still controlling his life and he needs to figure out how to live in moderation. Randy puts Stan on his shoulders and walks home while the two discuss how much drinking would be proper.

==Production==
[[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] reveal on the DVD commentary for this episode that they had wanted to do an episode involving [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meetings for "a long time", but could never get it right.&lt;ref name="Commentary"&gt;''South Park The Complete Ninth Season'' DVD commentary for "Bloody Mary". [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The bleeding statue idea came from [[Anne Garefino]], a producer on the show, and was inspired by the real life phenomenon of "[[weeping statue]]s", unusual occurrences where statues would unexplainably "bleed" some sort of liquid via supernatural means, usually from the eyes.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} The crew were discussing the idea of having this happen in an episode but felt it needed to be something more outlandish than the eyes. Garefino then came up with the idea of having the statue "shit blood all over the pope's face". Parker and Stone loved the twist, even if it meant the episode would likely draw far more controversy than normal.&lt;ref name="Commentary"/&gt;

The scene in which Randy gets arrested for drunk driving is based on a near identical experience that Parker had with his father when he was nine years-old.&lt;ref name="Commentary"/&gt;

==Controversy==
The episode was aired on December 7, 2005, which is the eve of the [[Feast of the Immaculate Conception]], a Catholic observance related specifically to the Virgin Mary. "Bloody Mary" was considered a very controversial episode, even by ''South Park'' standards. [[Catholic League (U.S.)|The Catholic League]] demanded an apology and that the episode "be permanently retired and not be made available on [[DVD]]" and that [[Joseph A. Califano, Jr.]], a board member of [[Viacom]] (the parent company of [[Comedy Central]]) and a practicing Catholic, issue a personal statement.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite press release| title=Virgin Mary defiled on "South Park"| publisher=Catholic League (U.S.)| date=2005-12-08| url=http://www.catholicleague.org/05press_releases/quarter%204/051208_south_park.htm| accessdate=2006-07-06| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718164613/http://www.catholicleague.org/05press_releases/quarter%204/051208_south_park.htm| archivedate=2007-07-18| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Califano did later release a statement calling the episode an "appalling and disgusting portrayal of the Virgin Mary", and pledged to have it reviewed by Viacom's president and CEO, [[Tom Freston]]. Bishop [[William Skylstad]], president of the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]], sent a letter to Freston saying the network showed "extreme insensitivity" when it aired the episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cathnews.acu.edu.au/512/119.php|title=Bishops' president blasts ''South Park'' episode|date=2005-12-21|publisher=Church Resources|accessdate=2006-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Comedy Central re-aired all episodes of Season 9 on December 28, 2005, "Bloody Mary" was absent from the broadcast. Comedy Central responded to e-mail inquiries about the fate of the episode with the assurance that "Bloody Mary" has not been retired and would not be pulled from the DVD release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2006/01/09/south_park_bloody_ma.html|title=South Park "Bloody Mary" an immaculate deletion, says Comedy Central|date=2006-01-09|publisher=BoingBoing|accessdate=2006-07-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426221954/http://www.boingboing.net/2006/01/09/south_park_bloody_ma.html|archivedate=2006-04-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Screen captures from the episode on Comedy Central's press site and the ''South Park'' section of comedycentral.com are absent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,18055,00.html?tnews|title="South Park" Parked by Complaints?|date=2005-12-29|author=Sarah Hall|publisher=[[E!]]|accessdate=2006-07-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427031803/http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0%2C1%2C18055%2C00.html?tnews|archivedate=2006-04-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006, leaders from the New Zealand Catholic Bishops' Conference, the Council of Christians and Muslims, and other religious groups together lobbied media conglomerate [[CanWest Global Communications|CanWest]] to stop a planned airing of the episode in [[New Zealand]] on the music channel [[C4 (New Zealand)|C4]]. The network rejected the plea and said the episode would air as planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3570043a1869,00.html |title=South Park controversy continues |date=2006-02-13 |author=Kristian South |publisher=Sunday News |accessdate=2006-07-06 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070103014218/http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3570043a1869,00.html |archivedate=2007-01-03 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/category/story.cfm?c_id=100&amp;ObjectID=10369212|title=TV chief rejects bishops' boycott call over 'tasteless' cartoon|date=2006-02-20|author=Martin Johnston|author2=Errol Kiong|publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=2006-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading Catholic bishops then called for a [[boycott]] of C4 and its sister network [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]]. CanWest again resisted and aired the episode sooner than planned to take advantage of the media attention. New Zealand's [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] [[Helen Clark]] issued a statement saying the episode sounded "revolting", but that the network was free to air it. One advertiser withdrew their ads from CanWest's networks. Catholic group Family Life International set up a website for boycotting CanWest's other advertisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4735216.stm|title=Catholics urge South Park boycott|date=2006-02-21|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2006-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;ObjectID=10369513|title=Church outrage as cartoon to air tonight|date=2006-02-22|author=Errol Kiong|author2=Martin Johnston|publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=2006-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another company named C4 Productions, which has no links to the C4 music channel, applied for a court order on the eve of the airing to stop the episode, citing damage to its business because it thought people would link it to the channel. The judge ruled against the order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3581315a10,00.html|title=Protests fail to stop Mary show|date=2006-02-23|publisher=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]|accessdate=2006-07-06|author=Rebecca Palmer}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; C4 aired the episode on February 22, 2006 and drew 210,000 viewers, six times ''South Park'''s normal audience for the channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3582068a1860,00.html|title=Bloody Mary show attracts six times usual audience|date=2006-02-23|publisher=[[NZPA]]|accessdate=2006-07-06}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving 102 formal complaints from viewers, the network issued a statement a month later saying "C4 acknowledges the strength of feeling in relation to the programme, and we sincerely apologize for any offence taken."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3613840a11,00.html|title=Apology over 'Bloody Mary' programme|date=2006-03-24|publisher=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]|accessdate=2006-07-06|author=Rebecca Palmer}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wikinews|35 South Park complaints not upheld, New Zealand}}
In June 2006 complaints received by New Zealand's Broadcasting Standards Authority (BSA) were rejected: The airing of the show was found to not be in breach of broadcasting standards. According to the BSA, "[b]ut showing disrespect does not amount to the sort of vicious or vitriolic attack normally associated with the denigration standard." They also said the episode was "of such a farcical, absurd and unrealistic nature that it did not breach standards of good taste and decency in the context in which it was offered."&lt;ref&gt;

In February 2006, [[Archdiocese of Melbourne|Archbishop]] [[Denis Hart]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] wrote to television network [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] asking them not to air the episode. The network's programming director originally rejected the request, but later decided to postpone the episode citing the controversy over the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cathnews.com/news/602/92.php |title=Muslim cartoon controversy prompts SBS reversal on ''South Park'' |date=2006-02-16 |publisher=Church Resources |accessdate=2006-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825194309/http://www.cathnews.com/news/602/92.php |archivedate=August 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode was, however, shown on [[The Comedy Channel]], on August 30, 2006.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

On March 14, 2006, [[Rob Corddry]], reporting on Comedy Central's own ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'', said:

:Christianity has evolved and matured. No longer do they stone people to death for blasphemy. Now they write a lot of letters to advertisers. Even a secular, atheistic, [[morally bankrupt]] entity like Comedy Central can be affected. Just ask Matt Stone and Trey Parker, creators of ''South Park'', whose recent episode entitled "Bloody Mary" was pulled after a single airing. Now obviously [we at] Comedy Central can't show you that offensive material.

The ''South Park'' clips shown while Corddry spoke included several scenes of seemingly offensive material (fornicating cats, a man vomiting and then falling in his own vomit, [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] viewing a man being sodomized, etc.) but there was nothing from the "Bloody Mary" episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cc.com/video-clips/y1rfkf/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-this-week-in-god---blasphemy-edition|title=This Week In God - Blasphemy Edition|date=2006-03-14|publisher=Comedy Central|accessdate=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the "[[Trapped in the Closet (South Park)|Trapped in the Closet]]" episode, "Bloody Mary" did return to the air, appearing on August 2, 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23280">The '''Curse of the Billy Goat''' was a sports-related curse that was supposedly placed on the [[Chicago Cubs]] [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) franchise in 1945, by [[Billy Goat Tavern]] owner William Sianis. The curse lasted 71 years, from 1945 to 2016. Because the odor of his pet [[goat]], named Murphy, was bothering other fans, Sianis was asked to leave [[Wrigley Field]], the Cubs' home ballpark, during game 4 of the [[1945 World Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferraro|first1=Michael X.|last2=Veneziano|first2=John|title=Numbelivable!|page=119|publisher=Triumph Books|location=Chicago, Illinois|year=2007|isbn=978-1-57243-990-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Newman|first=Mark|title=Will the Cubs break the Curse of the Billy Goat in the 'Year of the Goat?'|url=http://m.mlb.com/cutfour/2015/02/19/109699372/will-the-cubs-break-the-curse-of-the-billy-goat-in-the-year-of-the-goat|publisher=[[MLB Advanced Media]]|website=MLB.com|date=February 19, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221081250/http://m.mlb.com/cutfour/2015/02/19/109699372/will-the-cubs-break-the-curse-of-the-billy-goat-in-the-year-of-the-goat|archivedate=February 21, 2015|accessdate=May 1, 2018|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outraged, Sianis allegedly declared, "Them Cubs, they ain't gonna win no more," which had been interpreted to mean that the Cubs would never win another [[National League]] (NL) [[List of National League pennant winners|pennant]] (at least for the remainder of Sianis's life).

The Cubs lost the 1945 World Series to the [[Detroit Tigers]], and did not win a [[List of World Series champions|World Series championship]] again until 2016. After the incident with Sianis and Murphy, the Cubs did not play in the World Series for the next 71 years until, on the 46th anniversary of Billy Sianis's death,&lt;ref name="SianisLegacy"&gt;{{cite news|title=Celebrity Deaths: William Sianis and the Curse of the Billy Goat|url=http://www.legacy.com/news/celebrity-deaths/article/william-sianis-and-the-curse-of-the-billy-goat|website=Legacy.com|accessdate=October 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "curse" was broken when they defeated the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] 5–0 in game 6 of the [[2016 National League Championship Series]] to win the NL pennant.&lt;ref name="CubsWinNLPennant"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gurnick|first=Ken|last2=Muskat|first2=Carrie|title=Wait of the World: Cubs win NL pennant!|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/cubs-beats-dodgers-in-game-6-to-win-nl-pennant/c-206880270|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|website=MLB.com|date=October 23, 2016|accessdate=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cubs then defeated the [[American League]] (AL) [[List of American League pennant winners|champion]] [[Cleveland Indians]] 8–7 in 10 innings in game 7 to win the [[2016 World Series]].&lt;ref name="CubsWinWorldSeries"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bastian|first1=Jordan|last2=Muskat|first2=Carrie|title=Cubs are heavy wait champions!|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/chicago-cubs-win-2016-world-series/c-207938228|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|website=MLB.com|date=November 2, 2016|accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the curse==
The exact nature of Sianis's curse differs in various accounts of the incident. Some state that he declared that no World Series games would ever again be played at Wrigley Field, while others believe that his ban was on the Cubs appearing in the World Series, making no mention of a specific venue. Sianis’s family claims that he dispatched a telegram to team owner [[Philip K. Wrigley]] which read, “You are going to lose this World Series and you are never going to win another World Series again. You are never going to win a World Series again because you insulted my goat.”&lt;ref name="Selzer2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Selzer|title=Chronicles of Old Chicago: Exploring the History and Lore of the Windy City|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SPEiBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA156|date=1 July 2014|publisher=Museyon Inc|isbn=978-0-9846334-8-7|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Avila|first=Michael|title=Are the Chicago Cubs Really Cursed?|url=http://www.livescience.com/32802-are-the-chicago-cubs-really-cursed.html|website=[[LiveScience]]|date=September 2, 2010|accessdate=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever the truth, the Cubs were up two games to one in the 1945 Series, but ended up losing Game 4, as well as the best-of-seven series, four games to three. The curse was immortalized in newspaper columns over the years, particularly by syndicated columnist [[Mike Royko]]. The curse gained widespread attention during the 2003 postseason, when [[Fox Major League Baseball|Fox]] television commentators played it up during the Cubs-[[Miami Marlins|Marlins]] matchup in the [[2003 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]] (NLCS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=Major League Baseball on Fox: Game 6 of 2003 National League Championship Series|publisher=Fox Sports|date=October 14, 2003|medium=television}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to an account in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times|Chicago Sun]]'' of October 7, 1945, the goat was turned away at the gate, and Sianis left the goat tied to a stake in a parking lot and went into the game alone. There was mention of a lawsuit that day, but no mention of a curse.

Between that 1908 triumph, which was the Cubs' second world championship (they'd also won the Series in [[1907 World Series|1907]] to become baseball's first back-to-back winners as well as the first franchise to appear in three consecutive World Series), and 1945, the first year of the alleged Billy Goat curse, the Cubs won the National League pennant six times but failed to win the Series: in [[1910 World Series|1910]], in [[1918 World Series|1918]] (won by the [[Boston Red Sox]] who themselves would soon become victims of an alleged baseball [[Curse of the Bambino|curse]] and not win another Series for 86 years), in [[1929 World Series|1929]], in [[1932 World Series|1932]] (known for [[Babe Ruth's called shot]] at Wrigley Field), in [[1935 World Series|1935]] (a re-match of the 1908 series against the [[Detroit Tigers]], with the Tigers winning this time, their first Series triumph in five appearances dating back to the early 1900s), and in [[1938 World Series|1938]].

==Alleged curse incidents==
On September 9, 1969, at [[Shea Stadium]], the Cubs played the [[New York Mets]] in a critical pennant race game. A stray [[black cat]] walked between Cubs captain [[Ron Santo]], who was on deck, and the Cubs dugout. The Mets would pull ahead of the Cubs in that series and eventually win both the newly formed NL East and the 1969 [[World Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=On Friday the 13th, let's revisit the Cubs' 'Black Cat Game'|url=https://www.mlb.com/cut4/remembering-the-cubs-black-cat-game-on-friday-the-13th/c-177833950|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|date=May 13, 2016|accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the Cubs’ postseason appearance was dashed by the [[San Diego Padres]]. The Cubs were victorious in the first two games of the best-of-five series. However, in game five, first baseman [[Leon Durham]] let a ground ball get past his allegedly wet glove in the bottom of the seventh inning. The Padres went on to score four runs to win the game and the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mitchell|first=Fred|title=Durham doesn't think much of error in '84 playoffs|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-05-04/sports/ct-spt-0505-mitchell-cubs-leon-durham-chicago--20120505_1_cubs-fans-mookie-wilson-error|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=May 4, 2012|accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the Cubs won 93 games and faced the [[San Francisco Giants]] in the [[National League Championship Series]], now a best-of-seven series. After splitting the first two games at home, the Cubs headed to the Bay Area, where despite holding a lead at some point in each of the next three games, bullpen meltdowns and managerial blunders ultimately led to three straight losses.

In 1998, behind NL MVP [[Sammy Sosa]], the Cubs won the Wild Card after winning a tiebreaker game vs the Giants. However, they were swept in the [[National League Division Series]] by the [[Atlanta Braves]]. 

On October 14, 2003, in the eighth [[inning]] of Game 6 of the NLCS, with Chicago ahead 3–0 and holding a three games to two lead in the [[Playoff format#Best-of-seven playoff|best of seven series]], several spectators attempted to catch a [[foul ball]] off the bat of Marlins second baseman [[Luis Castillo (baseball)|Luis Castillo]]. One of the fans, [[Steve Bartman]], reached for the ball, deflecting it and disrupting a potential catch by Cubs outfielder [[Moisés Alou]]. If Alou had caught the ball, it would have been the second out in the inning and the Cubs would have been just four outs away from winning their first [[List of National League pennant winners|National League pennant]] since [[1945 Chicago Cubs season|1945]]. Instead, the Cubs ended up surrendering eight runs in the inning and losing the game, 8–3. When they were eliminated in the seventh game the next day, the incident was seen as the "first domino" in the turning point of the series.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|title=Baseball fan feels Chicago's fury|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3200582.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|website=BBCNews.com|date=October 17, 2003|accessdate=July 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cubs won their division in both [[2007 Chicago Cubs season|2007]] and [[2008 Chicago Cubs season|2008]], but were swept in the NLDS both years by the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] and [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] respectively.

In 2015, the Cubs finished second in the National League Wild Card race and defeated the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in the [[2015 National League Wild Card Game|Wild Card Game]] and the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in the [[2015 National League Division Series|NLDS]] to advance to the [[2015 National League Championship Series|NLCS]] against the [[New York Mets]]. However, the Cubs batted an NLCS record low of .164 and lost the series in a 4-game sweep. (The Cubs thus became the first team ever to get swept in a playoff series by a team they swept in their regular season series.)

Sianis's goat was named Murphy. In the [[2015 National League Championship Series]], this was referenced by fans of the [[New York Mets]], who joked that [[Daniel Murphy (baseball)|Daniel Murphy]], the Mets second baseman and [[2015 National League Championship Series | series MVP]], was "not the first GOAT (Greatest of All Time, in reference to Murphy's postseason heroics to that point) named Murphy to keep the Cubs out of the World Series".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Berg|first=Ted|title=The Cubs' infamously exiled billy goat was also named 'Murphy'|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/10/chicago-cubs-daniel-murphy-new-york-mets-billy-goat-nlcs-mlb|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=October 18, 2015|accessdate=July 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attempts to break the curse==
Prior to his death on October 22, 1970, Billy Sianis himself attempted to lift the curse. Sam Sianis, his nephew, has gone to Wrigley Field with a goat multiple times in attempts to break the curse, including on [[Opening Day]] in 1984 and again in 1989, both years in which the Cubs went on to win their division. In 1994, Sam Sianis went again, with a goat, to stop a home losing streak, and in 1998 for the [[1998 National League Wild Card tie-breaker game|Wild Card tie-breaker game]], which the Cubs won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Billy Goat Curse|url=http://www.billygoattavern.com/legend/curse/|publisher=The World-Famous Billy Goat Tavern|date=August 14, 2015|accessdate=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 (the [[Chinese zodiac|Chinese zodiac's]] [[Goat (zodiac)|Year of the Goat]]), a group of Cubs fans headed to [[Houston]] with a billy goat named "Virgil Homer" and attempted to gain entrance to [[Minute Maid Park]], home of the [[Houston Astros|Astros]], division rivals of the Cubs at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Woe is us ; A look at the curses|date=October 16, 2004|newspaper=USA Today|page=C2}}&lt;/ref&gt; After they were denied entrance, they unfurled a scroll, read a verse and proclaimed they were "reversing the curse". The Cubs won the [[National League Central|division]] that year and then came within five outs of playing in the World Series, but were undone by the [[2003 Florida Marlins season|Florida Marlins]]' eight-run rally immediately following the [[Steve Bartman incident]]. The Cubs then lost the following game and with it the series. (The Marlins went on to win the [[2003 World Series|World Series]] against the [[New York Yankees]].) Further salting the wound, the Astros earned their first World Series berth [[2005 World Series|two years later]] and their crosstown rival the Chicago White Sox won the series.

On February 26, 2004, at the Harry Caray Restaurant in downtown Chicago, the Bartman baseball was electrocuted in an attempt to break the curse, leaving nothing but a heap of string behind.

In another bizarre twist, it was reported that a butchered goat was hung from the [[Harry Caray]] statue on October 3, 2007, to which ''[[The Chicago Sun-Times]]'' noted: "If the prankster intended to reverse the supposed billy goat curse with the stunt, it doesn't appear to have worked."&lt;ref name=hung&gt;{{cite news|last=Toomey|first=Shamus|title=Dead goat hung from Harry statue|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times|date=October 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Cubs did win the NL Central division title in 2007 and 2008, they were swept in the first round of the postseason in both years: by the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] in [[2007 National League Division Series|2007]] and the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] in [[2008 National League Division Series|2008]]. The elimination by Arizona came on October 6, the same date that the goat appeared at Wrigley Field in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Castilla Back With Rockies In New Role|date=October 7, 2007|first=Barry|last=Svrluga|newspaper=Washington Post|page=D6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act was repeated before the home opener in 2009, this time a goat's butchered head being hung from the statue.  The act was futile as the Cubs were eliminated from postseason contention on September 26, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sullivan|first=Paul|title=CUBS 6, GIANTS 2; Eliminating the negative; Late hot streak minus Bradley is positive, but Cards clinch anyway|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=September 27, 2009|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a Greek Orthodox priest sought to end the curse during the 2008 playoffs with a spraying of holy water in and around the Cubs dugout to no avail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnQZJbCrH5w|title=Priest Blesses Chicago Cubs Dugout With Holy Water|date=20 January 2009|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 1, 2011, a social enterprise called Reverse The Curse, dedicated to bringing innovations to poverty by giving goats to families in developing countries, was initiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reverse the Curse|url=http://www.reversethecursechicago.com/about|publisher=Reverse The Curse Chicago|date=August 14, 2015|accessdate=August 14, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709001507/http://reversethecursechicago.com/about/|archivedate=July 9, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goats provide the family with milk, cheese, and alternative income to help lift them out of poverty. Reverse The Curse has expanded into reversing the "curses" that afflict the world's children in education and obesity.

On February 25, 2012, a group of five Chicago Cubs fans calling themselves ''Crack the Curse'' set out on foot from [[Mesa, Arizona]] (home to the Cubs' [[spring training]] facilities) to Wrigley Field. They brought along a goat named Wrigley whom they believed would be able to break the Curse of the Billy Goat upon arrival at Wrigley Field. Additionally, they attempted to raise $100,000 for the [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Stephen|title=Cubs fans and goat walk from Ariz. to Chicago to crack the team's curse|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cubs-fans-and-goat-walk-from-ariz-to-chicago-to-crack-the-teams-curse/|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=May 29, 2012|accessdate=May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 10, 2013, a severed goat's head was delivered to the Cubs in a possible effort to lift the curse on the team. It was addressed to the club's owner [[Thomas S.

On September 22, 2015, [[Patrick Bertoletti]], Tim Brown, [[Takeru Kobayashi]], [[Kevin Strahle]] and [[Bob Shoudt]] consumed a 40-pound goat in 13 minutes and 22 seconds at Taco in a Bag restaurant in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fox News|title=Competitive eaters devour goat meat to break Cubs.

On October 7, 2016, the owners of The Chicago Diner, a local vegetarian eatery near Wrigley Field, teamed up with [[Farm Sanctuary]] to try to reverse the Curse of the Billy Goat by displaying posters in the windows at their locations. The posters feature a goat named Peanut who urges Chicagoans to “reverse the curse” by going meat-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Chicago Diner Teams Up With Farm Sanctuary to Reverse the Curse of the Billy Goat|url=http://www.farmsanctuary.org/media/2016-press-releases/chicago-diner-teams-up-with-farm-sanctuary-to-reverse-the-curse-of-the-billy-goat/|website=FarmSanctuary.org|date=October 7, 2016|access-date=May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Former Cubs who won a World Series title elsewhere==
{{see also|Ex-Cubs Factor}}

Another factor that may play a role in the curse is the number of players (42 of them are listed below) who won World Series titles after leaving the Cubs (known as the [[Ex-Cubs Factor]]). These players include [[Andy Pafko]] (who, coincidentally, played in the 1945 World Series as a member of the Cubs), [[Gene Baker]], [[Smoky Burgess]], [[Don Hoak]], [[Dale Long]], [[Lou Brock]] (whose first title was in {{wsy|1964}} after [[Brock for Broglio|a mid-season trade]] to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]), [[Lou Johnson]], [[Jim Brewer]], [[Moe Drabowsky]], [[Don Cardwell]], [[Ken Holtzman]], [[Paul Noce]], [[Billy North]], [[Fred Norman]], [[Bill Madlock]], [[Manny Trillo]], [[Greg Gross]], [[Rick Monday]], [[Burt Hooton]], [[Bruce Sutter]], [[Willie Hernández]], [[Milt Wilcox]], [[Joe Niekro]], [[Dennis Eckersley]], [[Joe Carter]], [[Greg Maddux]], [[Joe Girardi]] (as both a player and a manager), [[José Vizcaíno]], [[Glenallen Hill]] (after his second stint with the Cubs; his title came in {{wsy|2000}} after a mid-season trade), [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]], [[Mike Morgan (baseball)|Mike Morgan]], [[Mark Grace]], [[Mark Bellhorn]], [[Bill Mueller]], [[Scott Eyre]] (whose title came in {{wsy|2008}} after he had been traded from the Cubs during the season), [[Tom Gordon]], [[Matt Stairs]], [[Jamie Moyer]], [[Mark DeRosa]], [[Mike Fontenot]], [[Ryan Theriot]], [[Ángel Pagán]], and, in 2013, [[Ryan Dempster]]. [[Dontrelle Willis]] and [[Jon Garland]] were traded as minor leaguers (coincidentally, the former won a World Series ring with the Marlins team that defeated the Cubs in the 2003 NLCS). [[Tim Lincecum]], who went on to win three World Series titles, was originally drafted by the Cubs, but he did not sign with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2003 First-Year Player Draft Tracker|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/draftday/search.jsp?sc=round&amp;sp=48|publisher=MLB Advanced Media, LP|date=June 4, 2003|accessdate=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of the curse==
{{main article|2016 Chicago Cubs season|2016 World Series}}
The Cubs ended the [[2016 Chicago Cubs season|2016 season]] with a {{Win-loss record|w=103|l=58}} ({{winpct|103|58}}) record.  It was their first 100-win season since [[1935 Chicago Cubs season|1935]] ({{Win-loss record|w=100|l=54}}, {{winpct|100|54}}), their best since [[1910 Chicago Cubs season|1910]] ({{Win-loss record|w=104|l=50}}, {{winpct|104|50}}), and the sixth 100-win season in franchise history.

The Cubs won the [[2016 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]] (NLCS), their first pennant in 71 years, with a 5–0 shutout in Game 6 against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] at [[Wrigley Field]] on October 22, 2016, the "curse" was broken on the 46th anniversary of Billy Sianis's death.&lt;ref name="SianisLegacy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CubsWinNLPennant" /&gt;

The '''David P. Robbins Prize''' for papers reporting novel research in algebra, combinatorics, or discrete mathematics is awarded both by the [[American Mathematical Society]] (AMS) and by the [[Mathematical Association of America]] (MAA). The AMS award recognizes papers with a significant experimental component on a topic which is broadly accessible which provide a simple statement of the problem and clear exposition of the work. Papers eligible for the MAA award are judged on quality of research, clarity of exposition, and accessibility to undergraduates. Both awards consist of $5000 and are awarded once every three years. They are named in the honor of [[David P. Robbins]] and were established in 2005 by the members of his family.

The British Government's decision to enforce a mass evacuation of the civilian population during the [[Second World War]] from the [[Crown colony]] of [[Gibraltar]], in order to increase the strength of [[Rock of Gibraltar|The Rock]] with more [[British Armed Forces]] personnel, meant that most Gibraltarians (some for up to ten years) were forced to be away from Gibraltar and did not have a place they considered to be home. Only those civilians with essential jobs were allowed to stay. However, this event gave the entire community a heightened sense of "[[Britishness]]" by sharing in the war effort.&lt;ref name="c2"&gt;Bond, pp. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Casablanca==
{{History of Gibraltar}}
In early June 1940, about 13,500 evacuees were shipped to [[Casablanca]] in [[French Morocco]] but after the capitulation of the French to the Germans in June 1940, the new pro-German French [[Vichy France|Vichy Government]] found the presence of Gibraltarian evacuees in Casablanca an embarrassment and sought an opportunity to remove them.&lt;ref name="c2"/&gt; That opportunity soon arose when 15 British cargo ships arrived under Commodore Crichton; they were repatriating 15,000 French servicemen who had been evacuated from [[Battle of Dunkirk|Dunkirk]].&lt;ref name="c2"/&gt; Once the rescued servicemen had disembarked, the ships were interned until they agreed to take away all the evacuees.&lt;ref name="c2"/&gt; Although Crichton was unable to obtain permission to clean and restock his ships (and contrary to Admiralty orders which forbade the taking on of evacuees), when he saw the mass of civilians pouring through the dockyards, he opened his gangways for boarding.&lt;ref name="c2"/&gt; On 3 July 1940, the British fleet had conducted the [[Attack on Mers-el-Kébir]] and destroyed a number of French warships, to prevent them being handed over to the Germans. The attacks killed more than a thousand French sailors and led to high tension between the British and the French,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/wwii/articles/merselkebir.aspx Mers-el-Kebir: A Battle Between Friends]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://militaryhistory.about.com/od/worldwari1/p/operation-catapult.htm World War II: Attack on Mers el Kebir]&lt;/ref&gt; which was evident when Gibraltarian families were forced at bayonet point by French troops to board, only with what they could carry, leaving many possessions behind.{{sfn|Bond|2003|p=98}}

==Back to Gibraltar==
When the evacuees arrived at Gibraltar, the Governor, Sir [[Clive Gerard Liddell|Clive Liddell]], would not allow them to land, fearing that once they were back on the Rock, it would be virtually impossible to evacuate them a second time.&lt;ref name="c1"&gt;Bond, pp. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Crowds gathered in [[John Mackintosh Square]] and demanded that the evacuees be allowed to land.&lt;ref name="c6"/&gt; After receiving instructions from London, a landing was allowed as long as the evacuees returned when other ships arrived to take them away from The Rock, and by 13 July the re-evacuation back to Gibraltar had been completed.&lt;ref name="c6"/&gt;

==London==
British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician [[Oliver Stanley]] agreed to accept the evacuees in the United Kingdom, but he argued with Gibraltar over the number of people involved.&lt;ref name="c6"/&gt; The Governor, he declared, had given the number of evacuees first as 13,000, then as 14,000 and finally as 16,000.&lt;ref name="c6"&gt;Garcia, pp. 15,20&lt;/ref&gt; He asked for the situation to be clarified, stressing the shortage of accommodation in Britain and insisting that only 13,000 could be accepted, 2,000 of whom were to be sent to the Portuguese island of [[Madeira]]&lt;ref name="c6"/&gt; in July and August 1940. The situation, replied General Liddell on 19 July, "is that this is a fortress liable to heavy and immediate attack and there should be no civilians here, whereas there are 22,000.&lt;ref name="c6"/&gt; The 13,000 was the number sent to Morocco, and more would have been sent had the situation there not altered."&lt;ref name="c6"/&gt; In London the evacuees were placed in the hands of the [[Ministry of Health]], and many were housed in the [[Kensington]] area.&lt;ref name="c6"/&gt; Concern for them in Gibraltar mounted as the air raids against London intensified, coupled with the arrival of harrowing letters, describing the circumstances in which the evacuees were living.&lt;ref&gt;GGA, Evacuation 1940: General Mechanics of&lt;/ref&gt;

==Madeira==
[[File:Gibraltar-Madeira.JPG|thumb|right|Memorial commemorating Gibraltarian evacuees in [[Madeira]]]]
[[Tito Benady]], a historian on Gibraltar Jewry, noted that when some 200 Jews of the 2000 evacuees from Gibraltar were evacuated as non combatants to [[Funchal]], Madeira, at the start of World War II, they found the [[Jewish Cemetery of Funchal]] that belonged to the Abudarham family, the same family after whom the [[Synagogues of Gibraltar#The Abudarham Synagogue|Abudarham Synagogue]] in Gibraltar was named.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jewishwebsight.com/bin/articles.cgi?Area=jw&amp;ID=JW1703|title=Portuguese Crypto Jews |author=Yitzchak Kerem|publisher=jewishwebsight.com|year=2015|accessdate=2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 28 May 1944 the first repatriation party left Madeira for Gibraltar and by the end of 1944 only 520&amp;nbsp;non-priority evacuees remained on the island.&lt;ref name="c6" /&gt;

In 2008, a monument was made in Gibraltar and shipped to Madeira where it has been erected next to a small chapel at [[Santa Catarina Park]], Funchal. The monument is a gift and symbol of ever-lasting thanks given by the people of Gibraltar to the island of Madeira and its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.love-madeira.com/madeira-pictures-santa-catarina-park.php www.love-madeira.com (accessed 13 December 2010)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117095353/http://www.love-madeira.com/madeira-pictures-santa-catarina-park.php |date=17 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Funchal and Gibraltar were twinned on 13 May 2009 by their then mayors, the Mayor of Funchal [[Miguel Albuquerque]] and [[Solomon Levy]], the Mayor of Gibraltar, who himself had been an evacuee from Gibraltar to Madeira. Levy then had a meeting with the then President of Madeira, [[Alberto João Jardim]].

==Jamaica==

[[File:Gibraltar Evacuee Camp, Jamaica - Group of Gibraltar Evacuees.jpg|thumb|right|A group of [[Gibraltarian people|Gibraltarians]] at the Gibraltar Evacuee Camp in [[Jamaica]] during World War II evacuation]]
{{Further|Gibraltar Camp}}
In September rumours were already circulating among the evacuees, and in Gibraltar, that the possibility of re-evacuating the Gibraltarians once more was being discussed, this time the destination being [[Jamaica]], in the West Indies.&lt;ref name="Garcia, pp. 16"&gt;Garcia, pp. 16&lt;/ref&gt; After much contention, it was decided to send a party directly from Gibraltar to the island, and 1,093 evacuees left for Jamaica direct, on 9 October, with more following later on.&lt;ref name="Garcia, pp. 16"/&gt;

Petitions followed and the demands were met, partly for strategic reasons and the lack of available shipping.&lt;ref name="Garcia, pp. 16"/&gt; The situation at the end of 1940, therefore, was that approximately 2,000 evacuees were in Jamaica and a lesser number in Madeira, with the bulk of around 10,000 housed in the London area.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; The camp that they were in was only designed to take 7,000, but the population of Malta had refused to be moved to Jamaica and the authorities wanted to use the unused capacity as a prisoner of war camp or as barracks for the local militia.&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Suzanne Francis|title=Mona Past and Present: The History and Heritage of the Mona Campus, University of the West Indies |pages=10–11|year=2006|publisher=University of the West Indies Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EQ63yTgVkaEC|isbn=9789766401597}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Discipline in the camp was quite strict with residents only being allowed out on the local trams between 8 a.m and 10 p.m. and local Jamaicans could be fined if they entered the camp. However, the camp enjoyed social events and gardening, but there was heated discussion with Gibraltarians who wished to not eat communally.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt;

==Repatriation==
The surrender of Italy in September 1943 lifted any possible objections to the return of the evacuees to The Rock.&lt;ref name="c6"/&gt; As a result, a Resettlement Board was established in November, and at a meeting of the Board on 8 February 1944 repatriation priorities were finally agreed.&lt;ref name="c6" /&gt; On 6 April 1944 the first group of 1,367&amp;nbsp;repatriates arrived on The Rock directly from the United Kingdom and on 28 May, the first repatriation party left Madeira, and by the end of 1944 only 520&amp;nbsp;non-priority evacuees remained on the island.&lt;ref name="c6" /&gt;

In London, home-comers were making claims on the evacuees' wartime accommodation and 500&amp;nbsp;Gibraltarians were re-evacuated to Scotland and 3,000 to camps in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="c3"&gt;Bond, pp. 100&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Governor, Lieutenant General Sir [[Noel Mason-Macfarlane]], fought valiantly on behalf of the evacuees and did not accept the lack of accommodation as a sufficient reason for the delays.&lt;ref name="c3"/&gt; As late as 1947, there were still 2,000 people in Northern Irish camps.&lt;ref name="c3"/&gt; The last of the evacuees did not see The Rock again until 1951.&lt;ref name="c3"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Gibraltarians today remember the evacuation with a statue on one of the main roundabouts by Jill Cowie Sanders. In 2009, Gibraltar Members of Parliament thanked the Church of Our Lady of Dolours in [[Fulham]] for the support it had given to evacuees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gibraltar.gov.uk/london/events.php?evt_id=71 Gibraltar Day 2009 - special Mass - Church of our Lady of Dolours], accessed September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Over 100 babies were born in Jamaica and the camp that they occupied was converted into part of the [[University of the West Indies]] after the war.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt;

[[File:Auckland City From the Sky Tower.png|alt=|thumb|[[Auckland]] city is home to the head offices of most of New Zealand's finance industry.|300x300px]]
Between May 2006 and the end of 2012 there were sixty-seven '''finance company collapses in New Zealand;''' including companies entering into liquidation, receivership or moratoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.interest.co.nz/saving/deep-freeze-list|title = Deep freeze list – Finance industry failures|date = November 2012|accessdate = 4 May 2015|publisher = Interest.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; An inquiry by the [[New Zealand Parliament]] estimated losses at over $3&amp;nbsp;billion that affected between 150,000 and 200,000 depositors.&lt;ref name="House of Representatives2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.parliament.nz/resource/en-nz/49DBSCH_SCR5335_1/0d9cfef1280ab5ba97f9569c8f965bfd7374305f|title = Inquiry into finance company failures|date = 11 October 2011|accessdate = 4 May 2015|website = New Zealand Parliament|publisher = House of Representatives}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most high-profile collapses were [[South Canterbury Finance]], [[Hanover Finance]] and [[Bridgecorp Holdings]]. The collapse radically reduced the size and importance of the [[Financial services|non-bank finance sector]] in New Zealand. According to the [[Reserve Bank of New Zealand|Reserve Bank]], at the height of financial expansion prior to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2007 crisis]], non-bank lenders had assets of about $25&amp;nbsp;billion and made up 8 percent of lending by financial institutions. By late 2013 the size of the finance sector was half its previous size and accounted for only 3 percent of institutional lending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/regulation_and_supervision/non-bank_deposit_takers/5475890.pdf|title = Report for the Minister of Finance on the operation of the prudential regime for Non- bank Deposit Takers|date = September 2013|accessdate = 4 May 2015|website = Reserve Bank of New Zealand|publisher = New Zealand Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years following the beginning of the collapses, sweeping [[Law of New Zealand|legislative]] and regulatory changes were made, aimed at improving oversight and regulation of the finance industry.

==Background and causes==
New Zealand's economy became increasingly dominated by [[finance capitalism]] in the decades before the [[Great Recession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Fire Economy|last = Kelsey|first = Jane|publisher = BWB|year = 2015|isbn = |location = Wellington|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Financial institution|Finance companies]] grew rapidly in the years leading up to the 2007-8 financial crisis as property developers used finance firms to "fund requirements over and above their first mortgage from a major bank."&lt;ref name="Douglas"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Finance company failure in New Zealand during 2006–2009: Predictable failures?|last = Douglas|first = Ella|date = 31 October 2014|journal = Journal of Contemporary Accounting &amp; Economics|volume = 10|issue = 3|pages = 277|doi = 10.1016/j.jcae.2014.10.002|last2 = Lont|first2 = David|last3 = Scott|first3 = Tom}}&lt;!--|access-date = 4 May 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report by the Commerce Select Committee, "between December 2004 and June 2007 the deposits invested by households in finance companies rose from $5.1&amp;nbsp;billion to $7.1&amp;nbsp;billion, an increase of 39 percent."&lt;ref name="House of Representatives2"/&gt; This rapid rise meant the finance industry was growing at a faster rate than the banking sector, mainly funded by retail investors ("mum and dad investors") seeking higher-yielding investments than banks could offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/regulation_and_supervision/non-bank_deposit_takers/5475890.pdf|title = Report for the Minister of Finance on the operation of the prudential regime for Non- bank Deposit Takers|date = September 2013|accessdate = 2 September 2015|website = Reserve Bank of New Zealand|publisher = New Zealand Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliamentary]] inquiry into finance company failures identified four causes of the company collapses:&lt;ref name="House of Representatives2"/&gt;
* '''Poor governance and management;'''
* '''Criminal misconduct;'''
* '''Deficiencies in disclosure, advice, and investors’ understanding;'''
* '''Inadequate supervision.'''

A 2014 mathematical survey of thirty-one New Zealand finance company failures in the period 2006 to 2009 by a group of academics found that "failed finance companies have lower capital adequacy, inferior asset quality, more loans falling due, higher earnings and lower cash flows. Furthermore, failed companies have a longer audit lag and some trustees appear to have a greater percentage of failed firms than others." &lt;ref name="Douglas" /&gt;

=== Directors' conduct and culture ===

Directors' conduct in the years leading up to the collapses was often incompetent and at times fraudulent.  In some cases, such as [[Bridgecorp Holdings|Bridgecorp]], the personal greed of directors was deemed to be the main cause of the fraud, "[Bridgecorp director Rod] Petricevic was acting without any concern for ethical principles. He was using company resources to fund his personal interests and was determined to get his way whether it was ethical or not. [...] Bridgecorp ultimately became an outworking of Petricevic's lack of ethical values."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://criticalperspectivesonaccounting.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/paper-cpa-015.doc.|title = The great financial services company fraud: A structuration perspective|date = n.d.|accessdate = 5 May 2014|website = [[Critical Perspectives on Accounting]]|last = Sharma|first = Umesh|last2 = Sinha|first2 = Paresha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthony Molloy (lawyer)|Tony Molloy]], QC said in the wake of the company collapses, "Meaningful consideration of investor protection legislation is impossible without first identifying the culture of the New Zealand market that has treated investors as prey, rather than as fellow citizens engaged in an enterprise from which all might profit to the benefit of the nation as a whole."&lt;ref name="House of Representatives2"/&gt;

Molloy, in a stinging tirade, wrote to the Commerce Select Committee during its inquiry into finance company collapses, stating,&lt;blockquote&gt;The recent destruction of wealth by the finance company and investment product industry was the inevitable consequence of a failure to read the signs that were there for anyone to see: at least three decades of unreadiness, unwillingness, and inability, on the part of regulators, enforcers, courts, lawyers, and accountants, to fulfil their respective functions with integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.parliament.nz/resource/en-nz/49SCCO_ADV_00DBSCH_INQ_9325_1_A154384/20e53ed4082bb680cbc7aa1209071aa9db8a0acc|title = Inquiry into finance company failures – Tony Molloy (Independent Specialist Adviser Report – Final)|date = 25 November 2010|accessdate = 14 May 2015|website = New Zealand Parliament|last = Molloy|first = Tony}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Law Professor [[Julie Cassidy]] believed that part of the cause of this was that policing of directors' duties was, "governed by a regime that is weak in terms of both standards of conduct and review and penalties. Coupled with the lack of power in the regulatory body [...] to pursue directors for even egregious breaches, the reality is that the New Zealand regime has failed to punish, much less prevent, serious breaches of directors' duties."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://aut.researchgateway.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10292/6319/NZ%20DirectorsPaper(Revised).pdf?sequence=9|title = Wake up New Zealand: Directors’ Duties Reform Responses to the GFC|date = 11 December 2013|accessdate = 5 May 2015|website = AUT Researchgateway|publisher = Auckland University of Technology|last = Cassidy|first = Julie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Related party transactions ===

Sloppy oversight of related party transactions was also a key cause as one study noted; "The interrelated characteristics of related party transactions in failed finance companies include: Excessive lending to related parties without satisfactory securities; Directors’ control over finance companies and their related parties; Deliberate non-disclosure of significant lending to related parties; and Breach of statutory requirements and agreements."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nmit.ac.nz/assets/Uploads/About-NMIT/pdfs/Research/RoleOfRelatedPartyTransactionsInTheFailureofNZFinanceCompanies-WuMalthus-Aug12.pdf|title = The Role of Related Party Transactions in the Failure of New Zealand Finance Companies|date = August 2012|accessdate = 5 May 2015|website = Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology|publisher = Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology|last = Wu|first = Xiaojing|last2 = Malthus|first2 = Sue}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study noted that gaps between the disclosed and undisclosed related party transactions were often significant;&lt;blockquote&gt;Capital + Merchant Finance's recorded related party loans were $41.58&amp;nbsp;million, whereas its unrecorded related party loans were $41.1&amp;nbsp;million . Of Rockforte's $4.8&amp;nbsp;million in outstanding loans, $2&amp;nbsp;million were undisclosed related party lending. Undisclosed related party transactions of more than $1&amp;nbsp;million were made to firms owned by Trevor Ludlow of National Finance 2000. Bridgecorp did not disclose related party lending to Barcroft which represented more than more than 30 per cent of Bridgecorp's total loan book .&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Poor governance ===

In the area of governance, a major problem was that some of the trustees of debt security companies provided inadequate oversight of the companies they were supposed to be supervising. At least 25 failed finance firms used one of two trustee companies – Perpetual Trust and Covenant Trust; raising concerns the trusts "were slow to detect adverse financial issues".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/trustees-fingered-probe-finance-company-collapses-88794|title = Trustees fingered in probe into finance company collapses|last = NBR Staff|date = 23 March 2009|work = National Business Review|access-date = 5 May 2015|publisher=nbr.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crisis, effects and bailouts==
The [[financial crisis of 2007-08]] had a flow on effect in the New Zealand economy causing a downturn in the [[Real estate|property market]] and precipitating a [[credit crunch]]. These macro-economic factors and subsequent "run on the funds" sparked the collapse of most of the finance companies; &lt;blockquote&gt;Credit began to tighten in the market and loan defaults became more common. This brought down the first 3 finance companies – National, Provincial and Western Bay – because of their lax credit- risk management (RBNZ, 2006). The collapsing housing market in New Zealand had the effect of reducing the value of many of the investments that finance companies were involved in, and the initial collapses and media attention spooked the "Mum and Dad‟ investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|ssrn = 1906923|title = Causes of New Zealand Finance Company Collapses: A Brief Review|date = 9 August 2011|website = Social Science Research Network|last = Yahanpath|first = Noel|last2 = Cavanagh|first2 = John|doi = 10.2139/ssrn.1906923}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Reserve Bank Governor [[Alan Bollard]] would reflect that,&lt;blockquote&gt;At the end of 2006 and in early 2007, we started to hear about property finance companies in trouble. Most were very small, and as individual failures they did not greatly concern us. But in the second half of 2007, bigger finance companies started to fall like flies. As each one entered into liquidation, receivership or moratorium, media speculation turned to the next. We saw angry scenes of elderly debenture holders haranguing hapless managers at meetings. The pattern seemed clear: poor governance, spider-web company structures, vulnerable business models, mismatched balance sheets, bad management and inadequate supervision by the trustee companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Crisis: One Central Bank Governor &amp; the Global Financial Collapse|last = Bollard|first = Alan|publisher = Auckland University Press|year = 2010|isbn = |location = Auckland|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the wake of the company failures there were numerous reports in the New Zealand news media of retirees who had lost their life savings. One example of this was Ken Mitchell, who lost $1.1&amp;nbsp;million of his life savings when Bridgecorp collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/nelson-mail/news/3166750/Bridgecorp-claimants-owed-3-2m|title = Bridgecorp claimants owed $3.2m|last = Kidson|first = Sally|date = 16 December 2009|work = Nelson Mail|access-date = 4 September 2015|publisher=stuff.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example was cited by a judge in the sentencing of a Bridgecorp director, "The 79-year-old said he and his wife had invested their life savings with Bridgecorp. Their hopes for a comfortable retirement were gone and they were no longer able to provide any financial help to their children. They now had to rely on a modest pension. The effect of the failure had been devastating and this had been the most depressing period of their lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.3news.co.nz/nznews/sixandahalf-years-in-prison-for-bridgecorp-director-2012051811|title = Six and a half years in prison for Bridgecorp director|last = Field|first = Tony|date = 18 May 2012|work = 3News|access-date = 4 September 2015|publisher=3news.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2010 sentencing of another company director the judge noted the "overwhelming sense of bitterness felt by investors"; "I acknowledge the presence of many investors here in court ... the letters that I have received range in consequences up to financial disaster, loss of homes, illness and effects on health and relationships."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; One investor, Carole Corner, had to sell her house after the company failed.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/national/3721852/Investors-disappointed-at-Blue-Chip-founders-sentence|title = Investors disappointed at Blue Chip Founder's Sentence|last = Mace|first = William|date = 20 May 2010|work = The Dominion Post|access-date = 4 September 2015|publisher=stuff.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the collapses, and worried about the fragility of the finance and banking sector, the New Zealand Government moved in to reassure investors in the finance sector. Between 2008 and 2011 the Government operated a deposit insurance scheme, the [[Crown Retail Deposit Guarantee Scheme]]. During its operation nine finance companies, including [[South Canterbury Finance]], were bailed out after they had collapsed. This cost the government around $2&amp;nbsp;billion.

==Investigations, prosecutions and convictions==
As at 30 January 2015 the [[Serious Fraud Office (New Zealand)|Serious Fraud Office]] (SFO) had prosecuted company officers such as directors and accountants involved in eleven finance companies, securing convictions against twenty people for a range of offences against the [[Crimes Act 1961|Crimes Act]] and Securities Act.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.sfo.govt.nz/f392,26311/Finance_Companies_status_report_as_at_30_January_2015.pdf|title = Status report|date = 30 January 2015|accessdate = 4 May 2015|website = Serious Fraud Office|publisher = New Zealand Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of convictions officers of finance companies were sentenced to a total of 707 months of prison.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Examples of successful prosecutions include: three '''Nathans Finance''' directors were found guilty of making untrue statements in the company's prospectus, two received prison sentences of over two years, one received a sentence of home detention;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/5555324/Nathans-Finance-directors-jailed|title = Nathans Finance directors jailed|last = Krause|first = Nick|date = 2 September 2011|publisher = Stuff.co.nz|access-date = 5 May 2015|last2 = Mace|first2 = William}}&lt;/ref&gt; two '''Capital + Merchant''' finance directors sentenced to seven and a half years and five years after being found guilty of charges of theft by a person in a special relationship;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10830868|title = Capital + Merchant directors jailed|last = Fletcher|first = Hamish|date = 31 August 2012|access-date = 5 May 2015|work=The New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; and convictions of five directors of [[Bridgecorp Holdings|'''Bridgecorp''']] resulting in prison sentences of six and a half years for Rod Petricevic and Rob Roest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/6808877/Remorseless-director-Rod-Petricevic-jailed|accessdate=22 January 2017|title=Remorseless director Rod Petricevic jailed|date=26 April 2012|publisher=Stuff.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/6946690/Roest-gets-six-and-a-half-years-jail|accessdate=22 January 2017|title=Roest gets six-and-a-half years' jail|date=18 May 2012|publisher=Stuff.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most serious case was that against '''[[South Canterbury Finance]]'''.  The SFO director said that, "The value of the fraud alleged to have been committed exceeds anything in the history of [[white-collar crime]] in New Zealand".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/fran-osullivan-on-business/news/article.cfm?c_id=1502864&amp;objectid=11342429|title = Vital witness missing in SCF trial|last = O'Sullivan|first = Fran|date = 15 October 2014|work = The New Zealand Herald|access-date = 4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the criminal case against three former officers of South Canterbury Finance the SFO achieved only five convictions as a result of eighteen charges prosecuted before the Timaru High Court.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.interest.co.nz/sites/default/files/SCF%20judgment.pdf|title = R v Sullivan|date = 14 October 2014|accessdate = 4 May 2015|publisher = Ministry of Justice|series = [2014] NZHC 2500}}&lt;/ref&gt; A central charge against the directors that they had obtained membership of the [[Crown Retail Deposit Guarantee Scheme]] through deception was not proved.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Immediately after the failure to secure convictions, the SFO faced criticism that they had not called the former [[New Zealand Treasury|Treasury]] Secretary John Whitehead to give evidence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Despite conducting what it described as, "by far the most extensive and challenging of the finance company investigations undertaken" into '''Hanover Finance''', the SFO decided in April 2013 not to proceed with criminal charges against the directors involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU1304/S00978/sfo-concludes-finance-company-investigations.htm|title = SFO Concludes Finance Company Investigations|last = SFO|date = 30 April 2013|publisher = Scoop.co.nz|access-date = 5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Ross, principal for '''Ross Asset Management''', was sentenced to a minimum of five years and five months in prison for running, what a judge described as a [[Ponzi scheme]].&lt;ref&gt;''SFO/FMA v David Ross'' 15 November 2013 DC Wellington, CRI-2013-085-007462.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil actions and settlements==
Alongside criminal prosecutions, the [[Financial Markets Authority (New Zealand)|Financial Markets Authority]] (FMA) and the receivers of the failed finance firms often pursued civil actions to recoup investor losses. The receivers of '''Bridgecorp Finance''' settled claims alleging breach of [[directors' duties]] against three directors of the firm for $18.9&amp;nbsp;million in February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11218323|title = Bridgecorp receiver cuts $18.9m settlement deal|date = 12 March 2014|accessdate = 3 September 2015|website = The New Zealand Herald|last = Fletcher|first = Hamish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month a case against the directors of '''Lombard Finance''', alleging breach of directors' duties, was settled for $10&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11208933|title = Lombard case dropped – $10m settlement reached|last = Fletcher|first = Hamish|date = 24 February 2014|access-date = 3 September 2015|work=The New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The liquidator of '''Capital + Merchant''' finance settled their civil claims against the [[auditor]] of the firm for $18.5&amp;nbsp;million in July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mbie.govt.nz/about/whats-happening/news/2014/18.5-million-settlement-for-capital-merchant-finance|title = $18.5&amp;nbsp;million settlement for Capital + Merchant Finance|date = 26 July 2014|accessdate = 3 September 2015|website = Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment|publisher = New Zealand Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil action by the FMA and the receivers of '''Strategic Finance''' against the company's directors and auditors for breaches of the Securities Act, such as making false statements, were settled for $22&amp;nbsp;million in August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/finance-companies-in-freefall/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501786&amp;objectid=11307702|title = Strategic investors get first settlement payout|last = Fletcher|first = Hamish|date = 12 August 2014|access-date = 3 September 2015|work=The New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an action taken by receivers of '''Belgrave Finance''' Justice Fogarty in the Auckland [[High Court of New Zealand|High Court]] awarded a judgment of $8.6&amp;nbsp;million against a former director of the company and a property developer associated with it for breach of [[Fiduciary|fiduciary duties]] and [[dishonest assistance]] of breach of fiduciary duties respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/finance-companies-in-freefall/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501786&amp;objectid=11327714|title = Belgrave receivers get $8.6m from director – no interest though|last = Fletcher|first = Hamish|date = 19 September 2014|access-date = 3 September 2015|work=The New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reform==
[[File:Beehive Building &amp; Parliament House.JPG|thumb|The [[Beehive (New Zealand)|Beehive]], Executive Wing of New Zealand's Parliament buildings.]]
In response to the collapses the [[Government of New Zealand|New Zealand government]] carried out a wide range of law and regulatory reforms of the finance industry. Key legislative changes included:
* In the area of financial services, the '''Financial Advisers Act 2008''' and '''Financial Service Providers (Registration and Dispute Resolution) Act 2008''' were enacted, professionalising advisory services, including by requiring advisers to adhere to a code of conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.buddlefindlay.com/sites/all/files/A_guide_to_New_Zealand%27s_Financial_Services_Regulation_-_Financial_Advisers_Act_0.pdf|title = A Guide To New Zealand's Financial Services Regulation – Financial Advisers Act 2008|date = November 2010|accessdate = 4 May 2015|website = Buddle Findlay}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Financial Markets Authority Act 2011''' replaced the Securities Commission with the [[Financial Markets Authority (New Zealand)|Financial Markets Authority]] (FMA) and empowered the Authority to take legal action on behalf of investors against directors, trustees and auditors; to conduct market surveillance; prevent products being structured to avoid FMA oversight; and warning powers on [[low-ball]] unsolicited offers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10724688|title = Mild style hides an iron will|last = O'Sullivan|first = Fran|date = 11 May 2011|work = The New Zealand Herald|access-date = 14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Kiwisaver Amendment Act 2011''' imposed an improved regime of reporting by [[KiwiSaver]] providers and created statutory duties for managers and trustees of Kiwisaver providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2011/0008/latest/DLM3638117.html|title = KiwiSaver Amendment Act 2011|date = 1 January 2014|website = New Zealand Legislation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation was partly a response to the revelations that the manager of [[Huljich Wealth Management (NZ) Ltd|Huljich Wealth Management]] had used his own money to top up investors funds to hide investment losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/debates/debates/49HansD_20110407_00000733/third-readings-—|title = Kiwisaver Amendment Bill – Third Reading|date = 7 April 2011|accessdate = 31 August 2015|website = Parliament|publisher = House of Representatives}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Securities Trustees and Statutory Supervisors Act 2011''' created a new system for licensing of securities trustees and statutory supervisors by the FMA and requirements for trustees to report actual or potential breaches of trust documents to the FMA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://fma.govt.nz/news/media-releases/securities-trustees-and-statutory-supervisors-act-comes-into-force/|title = Securities Trustees and Statutory Supervisors Act comes into force|date = 30 September 2011|accessdate = 1 September 2015|website = Financial Markets Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Securities Act 1978 was replaced by the '''Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013'''. One of the core changes was the replacement of requirements by issuers of financial products to provide a prospectus and investment statement with a requirement for a single product disclosure statement with penalties for misleading or deceptive statements.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/debates/debates/50HansD_20130828_00000036/financial-markets-conduct-bill-financial-markets-repeals|title = Financial Markets Conduct Bill, Financial Markets (Repeals and Amendments) Bill – Third Readings|date = 27 August 2013|accessdate = 4 May 2015|website = Parliament|publisher = House of Representatives}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]] leader [[Russel Norman|Dr Russel Norman]] criticised the law as it will make it harder to secure criminal convictions against finance company directors involved in activities similar to those that caused the collapses.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 
* The passage of the '''Non-bank Deposit Takers Act 2013''' brought in powers for greater oversight and regulation of finance companies; requiring independent directors, minimum capital requirements and restrictions on the amount of related party transactions allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2013/0104/latest/DLM3918915.html|title = Non-bank Deposit Takers Act 2013|date = 3 December 2013|accessdate = 4 May 2015|website = New Zealand Legislation|publisher = New Zealand Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Companies Amendment Act No 4 2014''' created new criminal offences for: directors who exercise powers or perform duties in bad faith; directors who allow insolvent companies to incur debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.russellmcveagh.com/Publications/ViewPublication/tabid/176/Title/companies-and-limited-partnerships-amendment-bill-divided-and-passed-into-law/pid/310/Default.aspx|title = Companies and Limited Partnerships Amendment Bill divided and passed into law|date = 27 June 2014|accessdate = 5 May 2015|website = Russell McVeagh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fritzl case''' emerged in April 2008, when a woman named Elisabeth Fritzl (born 6 April 1966) told police in the town of [[Amstetten, Lower Austria|Amstetten]], Austria, that she had been held captive for 24 years by her father, Josef Fritzl (born 9 April 1935). Fritzl had [[physical assault|assaulted]], [[sexual abuse|sexually abused]], and [[rape]]d her numerous times during her imprisonment inside a concealed area in the basement of the family home.&lt;ref name="Spiegel online"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCcellar"/&gt; The abuse by Elisabeth's father resulted in the birth of seven children:&lt;ref name=daysindarkness/&gt; three of them remained in captivity with their mother, one had died just days after birth, and the other three were brought up by Fritzl and his wife, Rosemarie, having been reported as [[Child abandonment|foundlings]].

Josef Fritzl was born on 9 April 1935, in [[Amstetten, Lower Austria|Amstetten]], Austria. In 1956, at age 21, he married 17-year-old Rosemarie, with whom he had two sons and five daughters, including Elisabeth, who was born in 1966. Fritzl reportedly began abusing Elisabeth in 1977 when she was 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Susan Donaldson James |title= Elisabeth Fritzl’s Trauma Like ‘Walking Dead’ |url= http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Story?id=4768253&amp;page=1 |work= |publisher= abcNEWS |id= |pages= 1–4 |date= 2 May 2008 |accessdate= 2 June 2009 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing [[compulsory education]] at age 15, Elisabeth started a course to become a waitress. In January 1983, she ran away from home and went into hiding in [[Vienna]] with a friend from work. She was found by police within three weeks and returned to her parents. She rejoined her waitress course, finished it in mid-1984, and was offered a job in nearby [[Linz]].

===Captivity===
On 28 August 1984, after Elisabeth turned 18, Fritzl lured her into the basement of the family home, saying he needed help carrying a door. This was the last piece needed to seal what would turn out to be the chamber where Elisabeth was held captive.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2008" /&gt; After Elisabeth held the door in place while Fritzl fitted it into the frame, he held an [[diethyl ether|ether]]-soaked towel on his daughter's face until she was unconscious, then threw her into the chamber.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2008"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Monster |first=Allan |last=Hall |location=London |publisher=Penguin |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-14-103970-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Elisabeth's disappearance, Rosemarie filed a [[missing person]]s report. Almost a month later, Fritzl handed over a letter to the police, the first of several that he had forced Elisabeth to write while in captivity. The letter, postmarked [[Braunau am Inn|Braunau]], stated that Elisabeth was tired of living with her family and was staying with a friend; she warned her parents not to look for her or she would leave the country. Fritzl told police that she had most likely joined a religious [[cult]].&lt;ref name=daysindarkness&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,551660,00.html|title=The Amstetten Horror House: 8,516 Days in Darkness|publisher=[[Spiegel Online]]|date=6 May 2008|accessdate=6 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next 24 years, Fritzl visited Elisabeth in the hidden chamber almost every day, or a minimum of three times a week, bringing food and other supplies. After his arrest, he admitted that he repeatedly [[rape]]d her. Elisabeth gave birth to seven children during her captivity.&lt;ref name="daysindarkness" /&gt; One child died shortly after birth, and three—Lisa, Monika, and Alexander—were removed from the cellar as infants to live with Fritzl and his wife, who were approved by local [[social services]] authorities as their [[foster care|foster parents]]. Officials said that Fritzl "very plausibly" explained how three of his infant grandchildren had appeared on his doorstep. The family received regular visits from social workers, who saw and heard nothing to arouse their suspicions.&lt;ref name="BBCProfileJFriztl" /&gt;

Following the fourth child's birth in 1994, Fritzl allowed the enlargement of the prison, from {{convert|35|to|55|m2|sqft|abbr=on}}, putting Elisabeth and her children to work for years digging out soil with their bare hands. The captives had a television, radio, and video cassette player. Food could be stored in a refrigerator and cooked or heated on [[hot plate]]s.&lt;ref name="DailyMail1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/cellar-monster-josef-fritzl-faces-3000-rape-charges-in-december-trial-6849449.html |title=Cellar monster Josef Fritzl faces 3,000 rape charges in December trial|publisher=[[London Evening Standard]]|date=25 August 2008|accessdate=27 April 2018 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elisabeth taught the children to read and write. At times, Fritzl shut off their lights or refused to deliver food for days at a time to punish them.&lt;ref name="Time2008-10-23" /&gt;

Fritzl told Elisabeth and the three children who remained (Kerstin, Stefan, and Felix) that they would be gassed if they tried to escape. Investigators concluded that this was just an empty threat to frighten the captives; there was no gas supply to the basement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/austria/1960151/Josef-Fritzlandrsquos-threats-to-gas-family-were-a-bluff.html|title= Josef Fritzl's threats to gas family were a bluff|publisher=Daily Telegraph|first=Adreas|last=Sam|date=16 May 2008|accessdate=16 May 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated after his arrest that he told them that they would receive an electric shock and die if they meddled with the cellar door.&lt;ref name=GuardianQuotes/&gt;

According to Fritzl's sister-in-law Christine, he went into the basement every morning at 09:00, ostensibly to draw plans for machines which he sold to firms. Often he stayed there for the night and did not allow his wife to bring him coffee. A tenant who rented a ground-floor room in the house for twelve years claimed to hear noises from the basement, which Fritzl explained were from the "faulty pipes" or the gas heating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7377344.stm|title='Second man' at Austrian cellar|publisher=BBC News|date=1 May 2008|accessdate=6 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovery===
On 19 April 2008, Fritzl agreed to seek medical attention after Kerstin, the eldest daughter, fell unconscious. Elisabeth helped him carry Kerstin out of the chamber and saw the outside world for the first time in 24 years. Fritzl forced her to return to the chamber, where she remained for a final week.&lt;ref name=daysindarkness/&gt; Kerstin was taken by [[ambulance]] to a local hospital, the Landesklinikum Amstetten, and was admitted in serious condition with life-threatening [[kidney failure]]. Fritzl later arrived at the hospital claiming to have found a note written by Kerstin's mother. He discussed Kerstin's condition and the note with Dr. Albert Reiter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/7373233.stm|title=Doctor found note from victim|publisher=BBC News|date=29 April 2008|accessdate=19 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical staff found aspects of Fritzl's story puzzling and alerted the police on 21 April, who then broadcast an appeal via public media for the missing mother to come forward and provide additional information about Kerstin's medical history.&lt;ref name="Telepgraph2"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/joseffritzl/2101452/Josef-Fritzl-daughter-Kerstin-wakes-from-coma-and-is-reunited-with-her-family.html | title=Fritzl girl wakes from coma and is reunited with her family | publisher=The Daily Telgraph | date=9 June 2008 | accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AustriaSaysManLockedUpDaughter"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/29/world/europe/29austria.html|title=Austria Says Man Locked Up Daughter|first=Mark|last=Landler|authorlink=Mark Landler|date=28 April 2008|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=29 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police reopened the case file on Elisabeth's disappearance. Fritzl repeated his story about Elisabeth being in a cult, and presented what he claimed was the "most recent letter" from her, dated January 2008, posted from the town of [[Kematen an der Krems|Kematen]].&lt;ref name="daysindarkness" /&gt; The police contacted Manfred Wohlfahrt, a church officer and expert on cults, who raised doubts about the existence of the group Fritzl described. He noted that Elisabeth's letters seemed dictated and oddly written.

Elisabeth pleaded with Fritzl to be taken to the hospital. On 26 April, he released her from the cellar along with her sons Stefan and Felix, bringing them upstairs. He and Elisabeth went to the hospital where Kerstin was being treated on 26 April 2008. Following a tip-off from Reiter that Josef and Elisabeth were at the hospital, the police detained them on the hospital grounds and took them to a police station for questioning.

Elisabeth did not provide police with more details until they promised her that she would never have to see her father again. Over the next two hours, she told the story of her 24 years in captivity. Elisabeth told the police that Fritzl raped her and forced her to watch [[pornography|pornographic]] videos, which he made her reenact with him in front of her children in order to humiliate her.&lt;ref name=daysindarkness/&gt; Shortly after midnight, police officers completed the interview. Fritzl, aged 73, was arrested on 26 April on suspicion of serious crimes against family members.&lt;ref name="BBCtimeline"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7370208.stm|title=Timeline: Austrian cellar case|publisher=BBC News|date=19 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the night of 27 April, Elisabeth, her children and her mother Rosemarie were taken into care. Police said Fritzl told investigators how to enter the basement chamber through a small hidden door, opened by a secret [[Remote keyless system|keyless entry code]].

==Cell==
The Fritzl property in Amstetten is a building dating from around 1890. A newer building was added after 1978 when Fritzl applied for a building permit for an "extension with basement". In 1983, building inspectors visited the site and verified that the new extension had been built according to the dimensions specified on the permit. Fritzl had illegally enlarged the room by excavating space for a much larger basement, concealed by walls. Around 1981 or 1982, according to his statement,&lt;ref name="GuardianQuotes" /&gt; Fritzl started to turn this hidden cellar into a [[prison cell]] and installed a washbasin, toilet, bed, hot plate, and refrigerator. In 1983, he added more space by creating a passageway to a pre-existing basement area under the old part of the property, of which only he knew.

The concealed cellar had a {{convert|5|m|yd|1|adj=mid|-long}} corridor, a storage area, and three small open cells, connected by narrow passageways; and a basic cooking area and bathroom facilities, followed by two sleeping areas, which were equipped with two beds each. It covered an area of approximately {{convert|55|m2|sqft|abbr=on}}. The cell had two access points: a hinged door that weighed 500&amp;nbsp;kg (1,100&amp;nbsp;lb) which is thought to have become unusable over the years because of its weight, and a metal door, reinforced with concrete and on steel rails that weighed 300&amp;nbsp;kg (650&amp;nbsp;lb) and measured {{convert|1|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|60|cm|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide. It was located behind a shelf in Fritzl's basement workshop, protected by an electronic code entered using a remote control unit. In order to reach this door, five locking basement rooms had to be crossed. To get to the area where Elisabeth and her children were held, eight doors in total needed to be unlocked, of which two doors were additionally secured by electronic locking devices.&lt;ref name="Spiegel online"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCcellar"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7384182.stm|title=Cellar in abuse case described|publisher=BBC News|date=5 May 2008|accessdate=6 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7373172.stm|title= Inside Josef Fritzl's cellar dungeon|publisher=BBC News|date=30 April 2008|accessdate=10 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biography===
Josef Fritzl (now known as Mayrhoff) was born on 9 April 1935, in Amstetten to Josef Fritzl Sr and Maria Fritzl. He grew up as an [[only child]] raised solely by his working mother. His father had deserted the family when Fritzl was four, and never again came into contact with him. Fritzl Sr later fought as a soldier in the [[Wehrmacht]] during [[World War II]], and was killed in action in 1944. His name appears on a memorial plaque in Amstetten.&lt;ref&gt;''Secrets of the Cellar'': [[John Glatt]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, at the age of 21, he married Rosemarie, 17, with whom he had two sons and five daughters.

After completing his education at an [[Höhere Technische Lehranstalt|HTL Technical College]] with a qualification in electrical engineering, Fritzl obtained a job at [[Voestalpine]] in Linz. From 1969 until 1971, he obtained a job in a construction material firm in Amstetten. Later, he became a technical equipment salesman, travelling throughout Austria. He retired from active employment when he turned 60 in 1995, but continued some commercial activities thereafter. In addition to his apartment building in Amstetten, Fritzl rented out several other properties.&lt;ref name="BBCProfileJFriztl"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7371959.stm|title=Profile: Josef Fritzl|date=19 March 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=6 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spiegel online"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,551451-2,00.html|title=How Josef Fritzl Created his Regime of Terror|accessdate=6 May 2008|author1=Dahlkamp, Jürgen |author2=Kraske, Marion |author3=Von Mittelstaedt, Juliane |author4=Röbel, Sven |author5=Von Rohr,Mathieu |date=5 May 2008|publisher=[[Der Spiegel#Spiegel Online|Spiegel Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noe.orf.at/stories/274341/|title=Wer ist Josef Fritzl?|publisher=[[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]]|date=29 April 2008|language=German|accessdate=6 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5g6TMNOu02XFDEmyr9rQRBGdPEt3AD90DO2AG0 |title=Josef Fritzl: a shrewd liar and an obsessive tyrant |author=Bradley S.

He ran it, together with his wife, until 1996.

===Criminal history===
In 1967, Fritzl broke into the Linz home of a 24-year-old nurse while her husband was away and raped her while holding a knife to her throat, threatening to kill her if she screamed.&lt;ref name="Nurse"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/austria/1920887/Austria-Josef-Fritzl-could-face-murder-charges.html | title=Joseph Fritzl Could Face Murder Charges | publisher=The Daily Telegraph | accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an annual report for 1967 and a press release of the same year, he was also named as a suspect in a case of attempted rape of a 21-year-old woman, and was known for [[indecent exposure]]. Fritzl was arrested and served twelve months of an eighteen-month prison sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/sex-slave-dungeon-i-knew-fritzl-had-raped-his-daughter-says-man-upstairs-6686436.html | location=London | work=The Evening Standard | title=Sex slave dungeon: I knew Fritzl had raped his daughter, says man upstairs | date=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with Austrian law, his criminal record was expunged after fifteen years. As a result, more than 25 years later, when he applied to adopt and/or foster Elisabeth's children, the local social service authorities did not discover his criminal history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7380969.stm|title= Police study old Fritzl sex case|publisher=BBC News|date=2 May 2008|accessdate=2 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/der-fall-amstetten-wie-josef-fritzl-die-behoerden-taeuschte-a-551598.html|title=Der Fall Amstetten: Wie Josef Fritzl die Behörden täuschte|last=Mathieu|first=von Rohr|date=6 May 2008|website=SPIEGEL ONLINE|language=German|access-date=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-portrayal and psychiatric assessment===
After his arrest, Fritzl claimed that his behavior toward his daughter did not constitute rape but was consensual. Mayer forwarded extracts from the minutes of his talks with his client to the Austrian weekly ''[[NEWS (Austrian magazine)|News]]'' for publication. According to these statements, Fritzl said that he "always knew during the whole 24 years that what I was doing was not right, that I must have been crazy to do such a thing, yet it became a normal occurrence to lead a second life in the basement of my house."

Regarding his treatment of the family he had with his wife, Fritzl stated, "I am not the beast the media make me to be". Regarding his treatment of Elisabeth and her children in the cellar, he explained that he brought flowers for Elisabeth and books and toys for the children into the "bunker", as he called it, and often watched videos with the children and ate meals with Elisabeth and the children. Fritzl decided to imprison Elisabeth after she "did not adhere to any rules any more" when she became a teenager. "That is why I had to do something; I had to create a place where I could keep Elisabeth, by force if necessary, away from the outside world." He suggested that the emphasis on discipline in the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi era]], during which he grew up, might have influenced his views about decency and good behavior. The chief editors of ''News'' magazine noted in their editorial that they expected Fritzl's statement to form the basis of the defence strategy of his lawyer. Critics said his statement may have been a ploy to prepare an [[insanity defence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/fritzl-blames-nazis-and-speaks-of-mother-love/2008/05/09/1210131264654.html|first=Andreas|last=Sam|title = Fritzl blames Nazis and speaks of mother's love|work=The Age|date=10 May 2008|accessdate=10 May 2008|location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting on his childhood, Fritzl initially described his mother as "the best woman in the world" and "as strict as it was necessary".&lt;ref name=GuardianQuotes&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/09/joseffritzl.austria1|title='The urge to taste forbidden fruit was too strong'|accessdate=12 May 2008|author=Elizabeth Stewart and agencies|date=9 May 2008|work=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he expressed a negative opinion of his mother and claimed that "she used to beat me, hit me until I was lying in a pool of blood on the floor. It left me feeling totally humiliated and weak. My mother was a servant and she used to work hard all her life, I never had a kiss from her, I was never cuddled although I wanted it – I wanted her to be good to me." He also claimed that she called him "a [[Satan]], a criminal, a no-good", that he "had a horrible fear of her". In 1959, after Fritzl had married and bought his house, his mother moved in with them. Over time, their roles reversed, and his mother came to fear him. Eventually, he also admitted he had later locked his mother in the attic and bricked up her window after telling neighbors that she had died, and kept her locked up until her death in 1980. It is unknown how long Fritzl kept his mother locked up in his attic, but newspapers have speculated that it may have been up to 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Angela |last=Balakrishnan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/31/joseffritzl-austria |title=Josef Fritzl kept sick mother locked in attic, leaked papers reveal |publisher=The Guardian |date=31 October 2008 |accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Moore, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/3281656/Josef-Fritzl-admits-locking-mother-in-bricked-up-room-at-dungeon-house.html Josef Fritzl admits locking mother in bricked-up room at dungeon house], 29 October 2008, The Daily Telegraph.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a report by [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Adelheid Kastner, Fritzl's mother is described as unpredictable and abusive. Fritzl referred to himself as an "alibi" child, meaning that his mother only gave birth to him to prove that she was not barren and could produce children. Fritzl claims that his [[pathology|pathological]] behavior is innate. He admits that he planned to lock his daughter up during his prison stint for the earlier rape conviction so that he could contain and express his "[[evil]] side". He said, "I was born to rape, and I held myself back for a relatively long time. I could have behaved a lot worse than locking up my daughter."&lt;ref name="Time2008-10-23"&gt;Eben Harrell, [http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1853330,00.html Austria's Sex-Slave Father Tells His Side of the Story], 23 October 2008, Time.&lt;/ref&gt; The forensic psychiatrist diagnosed Fritzl as having a "severe [[mixed personality disorder|combined personality disorder]]" which included [[borderline personality disorder|borderline]], [[schizotypal personality disorder|schizotypal]], and [[schizoid personality disorder|schizoid]] personalities and a sexual disorder and recommended that Fritzl receive psychiatric care for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="Time2008-10-23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Connolly2009"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/18/psychiatrist-analyses-josef-fritzl | title=Fritzl's troubled childhood analysed in court | publisher=The Guardian | date=18 March 2009 | accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent reports have brought to light Fritzl's premeditated plan to lock his daughter up not for discipline but for his own gratification.&lt;ref name="Time2008-10-23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Premeditated"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/joseffritzl/4999175/Josef-Fritzl-trial-accused-hides-face-with-folder-in-court.html | title=Fritzl trial-accused-hides-face-with-folder-in-court | publisher=The Telegraph | work=The Telegraph | date=16 March 2009 | accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prosecutor's investigation===
In keeping with the agreement that she would never have to see her father again, Elisabeth Fritzl gave videotaped testimony before Austrian prosecutors and investigators on 11 July 2008.&lt;ref name="video"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/fritzl-lets-the-mask-slip-as-his-daughter-tells-her-tragic-story-1647361.html | title=Fritzl lets the mask slip as his daughter tells her tragic story | publisher=The Independent | work=The Independent | date=22 October 2011 | accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 November 2008, authorities in Austria released an indictment against Josef Fritzl. He would stand trial for the murder of the infant Michael, who died shortly after birth,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/11/13/austria.fritzl/index.html|title=Austria incest suspect charged with murder|date=13 November 2008|website=CNN International Edition: Europe|publisher=CNN|access-date=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and face between 10 years and [[life imprisonment]]. He was also charged with rape, [[incest]], kidnapping, false imprisonment and [[slavery]], which carry a maximum 20-year term.&lt;ref name="BBCProfileJFriztl" /&gt;

==Trial of Josef Fritzl==
The trial of Josef Fritzl commenced on 16 March 2009, in the city of [[Sankt Pölten]], presided over by Judge Andrea {{not a typo|Humer}}.
[[File:Kriminalfall Amstetten Presse.JPG|thumb|left|Journalists during the Fritzl trial]]

On day one, Fritzl entered the courtroom attempting to hide his face from cameras behind a blue folder, which he was entitled to do under Austrian law. After opening comments, all journalists and spectators were asked to leave the courtroom, whereupon Fritzl lowered his binder. Fritzl pleaded guilty to all charges with the exception of murder and grievous assault by threatening to gas his captives if they disobeyed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2009/03/2009316112944168657.html |title=Austria incest trial under way |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=16 March 2009 |accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his opening remarks, Rudolf Mayer, the defending counsel, appealed to the jury to be objective and not be swayed by emotions. He insisted Fritzl was "not a monster", stating that Fritzl had brought a [[Christmas tree]] down to his captives in the cellar during the holiday season.&lt;ref name="firstfiveyears"/&gt;

Christiane Burkheiser, prosecuting her first case since being appointed Chief Prosecutor, pressed for [[life imprisonment]] in an institution for the criminally insane. She demonstrated for jurors the low height of the ceiling in the cellar dungeon by making a mark on the door to the courtroom at 1m 74&amp;nbsp;cm (5&amp;nbsp;ft 8.5in), and described the cellar as "damp and mouldy", passing around a box of musty objects taken from the cellar, the odour of which made jurors flinch.&lt;ref name="Abused"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5917537.ece?token=null&amp;offset=12&amp;page=2|title=Josef Fritzl claims he was abused as a child|publisher=Times Online|date=16 March 2009|accessdate=17 March 2009 | location=London | first1=Jenny | last1=Booth | first2=Roger | last2=Boyes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prosecutor"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/world/josef-fritzl-the-absolute-ruler-of-his-underground-concrete-hell-1-1030194 | title=Josef Fritzl: The absolute ruler of his underground concrete hell | publisher=The Scotsman | work=The Scotsman | date=17 March 2009 | accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the first day of testimony, jurors watched 11 hours of testimony recorded by Elisabeth in sessions with police and psychologists in July 2008. The tape is said to have been so "harrowing" that the eight jurors did not watch more than two hours at a time.

Besides the video testimony, Elisabeth's older brother Harald testified, as did a doctor specialising in [[neonatal medicine]] and the court psychiatrist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5928188.ece|title=Josef Fritzl on suicide watch as "avenging angel" daughter gives damning testimony|publisher=Times Online|date=18 March 2009|accessdate=22 March 2009 | location=London |first=Roger |last=Boyes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josef's wife, Rosemarie, and Elisabeth's children refused to testify.&lt;ref name="Abused"/&gt;

On 18 March 2009, Elisabeth Fritzl attended the second day of the criminal trial against her father Josef, in preparation for a book she is to write about her ordeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/world/article.html?Elisabeth_Fritzl_was_in_court_to_watch_father&amp;in_article_id=586685&amp;in_page_id=64|title=Elisabeth Fritzl 'was in court to watch father'|date=18 March 2009|publisher=Metro |accessdate=19 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She does not plan to see her father again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/austria/1946950/Elisabeth-Fritzl-I-never-want-to-see-my-father-Josef-again.html|title=Elisabeth Fritzl: I never want to see my father Josef again|date=11 May 2008|publisher=Daily Telegraph |accessdate=19 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fritzl's attorney, Rudolf Mayer, confirmed that she had been in the visitors' gallery in disguise at the time her video testimony was aired. "Josef Fritzl recognised that Elisabeth was in court and, from this point on, you could see Josef Fritzl going pale and he broke down", Mayer said. "It was a meeting of eyes that changed his mind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5937416.ece|title="Fritzl met Elisabeth's eyes &amp;mdash; that changed his mind," says lawyer|publisher=Times Online|date=19 March 2009|accessdate=22 March 2009 | location=London | first=Philippe | last=Naughton}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Fritzl began the proceedings by approaching the judge and changing his pleas to guilty on all charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7949967.stm|title=Josef Fritzl admits all charges |date=18 March 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=19 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 March 2009, Fritzl was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for 15 years.&lt;ref name="BBCProfileJFriztl" /&gt; He said that he accepted the sentence and would not appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5941516.ece|title=Jozef Fritzl: no plans for investigation into police and social service failings|publisher=Times Online|date=20 March 2009|accessdate=22 March 2009 | location=London | first=Roger | last=Boyes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fritzl is currently serving out his sentence in [[Garsten Abbey]], a former monastery in [[Upper Austria]] that has been converted into a prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805050949/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5950413.ece | work=The Times of London | title=Fritzl prison has gym, choir and tennis classes | date=22 March 2009 | accessdate=23 September 2010 | first=Bojan | last=Pancevski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government response===
Describing the "abominable events" as linked to one individual case, [[Chancellor of Austria]] [[Alfred Gusenbauer]] said he planned to launch an image campaign to restore the country's reputation abroad.&lt;ref name="bbctrial"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7375904.stm|title=Cellar father refuses to explain|publisher=BBC News|date=30 April 2008|accessdate=30 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Judge Andrea {{not a typo|Humer}}, who presided over the trial, stated medical experts reported Elisabeth and her children were in "relatively good health".

After being taken into care, Elisabeth, all six of her surviving children and her mother were housed in a local clinic where they were shielded from the outside environment and received medical and psychological treatment. Members of the Fritzl family were offered new identities but it was emphasized that it was their choice to make.&lt;ref name="CNN2"/&gt;

Berthold Kepplinger, head of the clinic where Elisabeth and her children were being treated, said that Elisabeth and the three children held captive in the cellar required further therapy to help them adjust to the light after years in semi-darkness. They also needed treatment to help them cope with all the extra space that they now had in which to move about.&lt;ref name=IndSupport&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/europe/amstetten-cellar-victims-thank-town-for-support-828304.html|title=Amstetten cellar victims thank town for support|publisher=The Independent|first=Alan|last=Hall|date=15 May 2008|accessdate=15 May 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, a handmade poster created by Elisabeth, her children and her mother at the therapy facility was displayed in the Amstetten town centre. The message thanked local people for their support. "We, the whole family, would like to take the opportunity to thank all of you for sympathy at our fate", they wrote in their message. "Your compassion is helping us greatly to overcome these difficult times, and it shows us there also are good and honest people here who really care for us. We hope that soon there will be a time where we can find our way back into a normal life."&lt;ref name=IndSupport/&gt;

Kerstin was reunited with her family on 8 June 2008, when she was awakened from her [[induced coma|artificially induced coma]]. Doctors said that she would make a full recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7447975.stm|title=Cellar incest girl 'will recover'|publisher=BBC News|date=11 June 2008|accessdate=12 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was revealed that Elisabeth and her children were more [[psychological trauma|traumatized]] than previously thought. During captivity, Kerstin tore out her hair in clumps, and was reported to have shredded her dresses before stuffing them in the toilet. Stefan could not walk properly, because of his height of {{height|m=1.73|precision=0}}, which had forced him to stoop in the {{convert|1.68|m|ftin|adj=mid|-high}} cellar. It has also been revealed that normal everyday occurrences, such as the dimming of lights or the closing of doors, plunge Kerstin and Stefan into anxiety and [[panic attack]]s. The other three of Elisabeth's children who were raised by their father are being treated for anger and resentment at the events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/world/fritzls-victims-face-life-in-care-20080820-3yvt.html?page=-1|title=Fritzl's victims face life in care|publisher=The Age|date=21 August 2008|accessdate=9 September 2008 | location=Melbourne | first1=Allan | last1=Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late July 2008, it emerged that Elisabeth ordered her mother Rosemarie out of the villa they had been sharing in a secret location set up for them by a [[psychiatric clinic]]. Elisabeth was upset about Rosemarie's passiveness during Elisabeth's upbringing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/fritzl-family-split-elisabeth-kicks-320511|title=Fritzl family split: Elisabeth kicks Rosemarie out of safe house|last=Mulchrone|first=Patrick|date=25 July 2008|publisher=The Mirror|access-date=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawyer Christoph Herbst, who represents Elisabeth and her family, said, "Fortunately, everything is going very well"; they spend their time answering hundreds of letters from all over the world. Felix, Kerstin, and Stefan, brought up underground with their mother, have learned to swim. All of Elisabeth's children attended a four-day summer camp organised by firefighters, with 4,000 other young campers, in August 2008. The children, along with their mother, also have made day trips, including swimming outings, on which care was taken to keep them out of reach of the paparazzi and to protect their privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/austrian-abuse-victims-slowly-exposed-20080711-3dw8.html|title=Austrian abuse victims slowly exposed|date=12 July 2008|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Associated Press|access-date=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, Elisabeth and her children were forced to move out of the family's hide-away home and returned to the psychiatric clinic where medical staff had started trying to heal the family and unite the "upstairs" and "downstairs" siblings during the previous year. Elisabeth was reported to be distraught and close to a breakdown after a British [[paparazzi|paparazzo]] had burst into her kitchen and started taking photographs.&lt;ref name="trialputsspotlight" /&gt;

After the trial, Elisabeth and her six children were moved to an unnamed village in northern Austria, where they are living in a fortress-like house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Roger|last=Boyes |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5947460.ece|title=Elisabeth Fritzl seeks refuge with children in a fortress|publisher=Times Online|date=21 March 2009|accessdate=22 March 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the children require ongoing therapy. Factors that traumatised the "upstairs" children include learning that Josef had lied to them about their mother abandoning them, the abuse they had received from him during their childhood, and finding out that their siblings had been imprisoned in the cellar. The "downstairs" children receive therapy due to their deprivation from normal development, the lack of fresh air and sunshine while living confined in the basement, and the abuse that they and their mother had received from Josef when he visited them in the basement. All of the children might have genetic problems common to children born of an incestuous relationship.&lt;ref name="Children"&gt;{{cite news|first=Roger|last=Boyes |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5941388.ece|title=Josef Fitzl's upstairs, downstairs families united for a new life in the open|publisher=Times Online|date=20 March 2009|accessdate=22 March 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elisabeth was said to be estranged from her mother, Rosemarie, who accepted Josef's story about Elisabeth joining a cult and did not pursue the matter further, but Elisabeth allows her three children who grew up in Josef and Rosemarie's house to visit their grandmother regularly. Rosemarie lives alone in a small apartment.&lt;ref name="Children" /&gt;

An article in March 2010 in ''[[The Independent]]'' stated that Elisabeth and her children recovered remarkably well, given the difficult lives they endured for so long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/whatever-became-of-elisabeth-fritzl-1924645.html | work=The Independent | title=Whatever became of Elisabeth Fritzl? | date=21 April 2010 | accessdate=29 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Josef's sister-in-law, Christine, Elisabeth enjoys spending her time shopping, taking frequent showers, and driving. She has passed her driving test without difficulty. Her relationship with Thomas, one of her bodyguards, was reported to be ongoing, with him becoming a big-brother figure to her children. All of Elisabeth's children have developed normal sibling relationships with each other, and after having trouble dealing with the traumatic events, the three "upstairs" children slowly began recognising Elisabeth as their mother. The children enjoy being outdoors, playing video games, and spending time with their mother and grandmother. Despite their strained relationship, Elisabeth and her mother Rosemarie started visiting each other more, and Elisabeth has reportedly forgiven her mother for believing her father's story.

On 28 June 2013, workers began filling the basement of the Fritzl home with concrete. Estate liquidator Walter Anzboeck stated that the construction would cost [[Euro|€]]100,000 and would take a week to complete. The house was to be sold on the open market. While most neighbours approved of the proposal, some preferred that the property be demolished due to its sordid history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22989884 | title=Josef Fritzl's cellar in Austria concreted in | publisher=BBC | date=20 June 2013 | accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asylum seekers were offered the house to live in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/607253/Josef-Fritzl-s-House-of-Horror-to-be-offered-to-ASYLUM-SEEKERS | title=Josef Fritzl's 'House of Horror' to be offered to ASYLUM SEEKERS - because no one wants it | publisher=Daily Express | work=Daily Express | date=23 September 2015 | accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The house was sold for €160,000 in December 2016, and will be turned into apartments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/house-where-josef-fritzl-held-daughter-captive-is-sold-1.2895060|title=House where Josef Fritzl held daughter captive is sold |date=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GeorgeSPatton.jpg|thumb|Lieutenant General [[George S. Patton]], commander of the [[Seventh United States Army]], in 1943]]
In early August 1943, [[US Lieutenant General|Lieutenant General]] [[George S. Patton]] slapped two [[United States Army]] soldiers under his command during the [[Sicily Campaign]] of World War II. Patton's hard-driving personality and lack of belief in the medical condition [[combat stress reaction]], then known as "battle fatigue" or "[[shell shock]]", led to the soldiers becoming the subject of his ire in incidents on 3 and 10 August, when Patton struck and berated them after discovering they were patients at evacuation hospitals away from the front lines without apparent physical injuries.

Word of the incidents spread, eventually reaching Patton's superior, General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], who ordered him to apologize to the men. Patton's actions were initially suppressed in the news until journalist [[Drew Pearson (journalist)|Drew Pearson]] publicized them in the United States. While the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] and the general public expressed both support and disdain for Patton's actions, Eisenhower and [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]] [[George Marshall]] opted not to fire Patton as a commander. He was nonetheless sidelined from combat command for almost a year.

Seizing the opportunity the predicament presented, Eisenhower used Patton as a decoy in [[Operation Fortitude]], sending faulty intelligence to German agents that Patton was leading the [[Invasion of Europe]]. While Patton eventually returned to combat command in the [[European Theater]] in mid-1944, the slapping incidents were seen by Eisenhower, Marshall, and other leaders to be examples of Patton's brashness and impulsiveness. Patton's career was halted as former subordinates such as [[Omar Bradley]] became his superiors.

== Background ==
{{Main|Sicily Campaign|George S. Patton}}
The [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] began on 10 July 1943, with Lieutenant General George S. Patton landing 90,000 men of the [[Seventh United States Army]] near [[Gela]], [[Scoglitti]], and [[Licata]] to support [[Bernard Montgomery]]'s [[British 8th Army]] landings to the north.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=101–104}} Initially ordered to protect the British forces' flank, Patton took [[Palermo]] after Montgomery's forces were slowed by heavy resistance from troops of [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. Patton then set his sights on [[Messina]].{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=105–107}} He sought an [[amphibious assault]], but it was delayed by lack of landing craft and his troops did not land in [[Santo Stefano Island|Santo Stefano]] until 8 August, by which time the Germans and Italians had already evacuated the bulk of their troops to mainland Italy. Throughout the campaign, Patton's troops were heavily engaged by German and Italian forces as they pushed across the island.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=108–109}}

Patton had already developed a reputation in the U.S. Army as an effective, successful, and hard-driving commander, punishing subordinates for the slightest infractions but also rewarding them when they performed well.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=96–97}} As a way to promote an image that inspired his troops, Patton created a larger-than-life personality. He became known for his flashy dress, highly polished helmet and boots, and no-nonsense demeanor.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=77–78}}  General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the commander of the Sicily operation and Patton's friend and commanding officer, had long known of Patton's colorful leadership style, and also knew that Patton was prone to impulsiveness and a lack of self-restraint.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=348}}

=== Battle fatigue ===
Prior to World War I, the U.S. Army considered the symptoms of battle fatigue to be cowardice or attempts to avoid combat duty. Soldiers who reported these symptoms received harsh treatment.{{sfn|Walker|2008|p=xiv}} At the time of the incidents, the two soldiers Patton slapped were believed to be suffering from "battle fatigue," otherwise known as "[[shell shock]]" or "battle stress." Today, this condition is characterized as a form of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], which can result from prolonged severe exposure to death and destruction, among many other traumatic events.{{sfn|Walker|2008|p=xv}} While the causes, symptoms, and effects of the condition were familiar to physicians by the time of the two incidents, it was generally less understood in military circles.{{sfn|Walker|2008|p=xiv}}

An important lesson from the [[Tunisia Campaign]] was that [[neuropsychiatric]] casualties had to be treated as soon as possible and not evacuated from the combat zone. This was not done in the early stages of the Sicilian Campaign, and large numbers of neuropsychiatric casualties were evacuated to North Africa, with the result that treatment became complicated and only 15 percent of them were returned to duty. As the campaign wore on, the system became better organized and nearly 50 percent were restored to combat duty.{{sfn|Wiltse|1965|pp=171–172}}

Some time before what would become known as the "slapping incident," Patton spoke with [[US Major General|Major General]] [[Clarence R. Huebner]], the newly appointed commander of the [[U.S. 1st Infantry Division]], in which the soldiers both served. Patton had asked Huebner for a status report; Huebner replied: "The front lines seem to be thinning out. There seems to be a very large number of '[[malingerers]]' at the hospitals, feigning illness in order to avoid combat duty."{{sfn|Province|2009|p=26}} For his part, Patton did not believe the condition was real. In a directive issued to commanders on 5 August, he forbade "battle fatigue" in the Seventh Army:{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=117}}

{{quote|It has come to my attention that a very small number of soldiers are going to the hospital on the pretext that they are nervously incapable of combat. Such men are cowards and bring discredit on the army and disgrace to their comrades, whom they heartlessly leave to endure the dangers of battle while they, themselves, use the hospital as a means of escape. You will take measures to see that such cases are not sent to the hospital but dealt with in their units. Those who are not willing to fight will be tried by [[court-martial]] for cowardice in the face of the enemy.|Patton directive to the Seventh Army, 5 August 1943{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=117}} }}

== Incidents ==

=== 3 August ===
Private Charles H. Kuhl, of L Company, [[U.S. 26th Infantry Regiment]], reported to an aid station of C Company, 1st Medical Battalion, on 2 August 1943. Kuhl, who had been in the U.S. Army for eight months, had been attached to the 1st Infantry Division since 2 June 1943.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=331}} He was diagnosed with "exhaustion," a diagnosis he had been given three times since the start of the campaign. From the aid station, he was evacuated to a medical company and given [[sodium amytal]]. Notes in his medical chart indicated "[[psychoneurosis]] anxiety state, moderately severe (soldier has been twice before in hospital within ten days. He can't take it at the front, evidently. He is repeatedly returned.)"{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=330}} Kuhl was transferred from the aid station to the 15th Evacuation Hospital near [[Nicosia, Sicily|Nicosia]] for further evaluation.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=330}}

Patton arrived at the hospital the same day, accompanied by a number of medical officers, as part of his tour of the [[U.S. II Corps]] troops. He spoke to some patients in the hospital, commending the physically wounded.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=330}} He then approached Kuhl, who did not appear to be physically injured.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=115}} Kuhl was sitting slouched on a stool midway through a tent ward filled with injured soldiers. When Patton asked Kuhl where he was hurt, Kuhl reportedly shrugged and replied that he was "nervous" rather than wounded, adding, "I guess I can't take it."{{sfn|Atkinson|2007|p=147}} Patton "immediately flared up,"{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=330}} slapped Kuhl across the chin with his gloves, then grabbed him by the collar and dragged him to the tent entrance. He shoved him out of the tent with a kick to his backside. Yelling "Don't admit this son of a bitch",{{sfn|Atkinson|2007|p=147}} Patton demanded that Kuhl be sent back to the front, adding, "You hear me, you gutless bastard? You're going back to the front."{{sfn|Atkinson|2007|p=147}}

Corpsmen picked up Kuhl and brought him to a ward tent, where it was discovered he had a temperature of {{convert|102.2|°F|°C}};{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=115}} and was later diagnosed with [[malarial parasite]]s. Speaking later of the incident, Kuhl noted "at the time it happened, [Patton] was pretty well worn out&amp;nbsp; ... I think he was suffering a little battle fatigue himself."{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=116}} Kuhl wrote to his parents about the incident, but asked them to "just forget about it."{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=901}} That night, Patton recorded the incident in his diary: "[I met] the only errant coward I have ever seen in this Army. Companies should deal with such men, and if they shirk their duty, they should be tried for cowardice and shot."{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=116}}

Patton was accompanied in this visit by Major General [[John P. Lucas]], who saw nothing remarkable about the incident. After the war he wrote:

=== 10 August ===
Private Paul G. Bennett, 21, of C Battery, [[U.S. 17th Field Artillery Regiment]], was a four-year veteran of the U.S. Army, and had served in the division since March 1943. Records show he had no medical history until 6 August 1943, when a friend was wounded in combat. According to a report, he "could not sleep and was nervous."{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=331}} Bennett was brought to the 93rd Evacuation Hospital. In addition to having a fever, he exhibited symptoms of dehydration, including fatigue, confusion, and listlessness. His request to return to his unit was turned down by medical officers.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=331}}

{{quote|The shells going over him bothered him. The next day he was worried about his buddy and became more nervous. He was sent down to the rear echelon by a battery aid man and there the medical aid man gave him some medicine which made him sleep, but still he was nervous and disturbed. On the next day the medical officer ordered him to be evacuated, although the boy begged not to be evacuated because he did not want to leave his unit.|A medical officer describing Bennett's condition{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=117}} }}

On 10 August, Patton entered the receiving tent of the hospital, speaking to the injured there. Patton approached Bennett, who was huddled and shivering, and asked what the trouble was.  "It's my nerves," Bennett responded. "I can't stand the shelling anymore."{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=331}} Patton reportedly became enraged at him, slapping him across the face. He began yelling: "Your nerves, hell, you are just a goddamned coward. Shut up that goddamned crying. I won't have these brave men who have been shot at seeing this yellow bastard sitting here crying."{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=331}} Patton then reportedly slapped Bennett again, knocking his helmet liner off, and ordered the receiving officer, [[US Major|Major]] Charles B. Etter,{{sfn|D'Este|1995|pp=535–536}} not to admit him.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=331}} Patton then threatened Bennett, "You're going back to the front lines and you may get shot and killed, but you're going to fight. If you don't, I'll stand you up against a wall and have a firing squad kill you on purpose. In fact, I ought to shoot you myself, you goddamned whimpering coward."{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=118}} Upon saying this, Patton pulled out his pistol threateningly, prompting the hospital's commander, Colonel Donald E. Currier, to physically separate the two. Patton left the tent, yelling to medical officers to send Bennett back to the front lines.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=118}}

As he toured the remainder of the hospital, Patton continued discussing Bennett's condition with Currier. Patton stated, "I can't help it, it makes my blood boil to think of a yellow bastard being babied,"{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=118}} and "I won't have those cowardly bastards hanging around our hospitals. We'll probably have to shoot them some time anyway, or we'll raise a breed of morons."{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=118}}

== Aftermath ==

=== Private reprimand and apologies ===
[[File:Dwight D Eisenhower.jpg|thumb|General Dwight Eisenhower, commander of the Sicily invasion and Patton's superior, in 1943. Eisenhower privately criticized Patton for the incidents, but refused to remove him completely from command.]]

The 10 August incident-—particularly the sight of Patton threatening a subordinate with a pistol-—upset many of the medical staff present. The II Corps surgeon, Colonel Richard T. Arnest, submitted a report on the incident to Brigadier General [[William B. Kean]], chief of staff of II Corps, who submitted it to Lieutenant General Omar Bradley, commander of II Corps. Bradley, out of loyalty to Patton, did nothing more than lock the report in his safe.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=118}} Arnest also sent the report through medical channels to Brigadier General Frederick A. Blesse, General Surgeon of [[Allied Force Headquarters]], who then submitted it to Eisenhower, who received it on 16 August.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=119}} Eisenhower ordered Blesse to proceed immediately to Patton's command to ascertain the truth of the allegations.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|pp=535–536}} Eisenhower also formulated a delegation to investigate the incidents from the soldiers' points of view, including Major General [[John P. Lucas]], two colonels from the [[Inspector General]]'s office, and a theater medical consultant, [[US Lieutenant Colonel|Lieutenant Colonel]] Perrin H. Long, to investigate the incident and interview those involved.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=902}} Long interviewed medical personnel who witnessed each incident, then filed a report entitled "Mistreatment of Patients in Receiving Tents of the 15th and 93rd Evacuation Hospitals"{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=118}} which extensively detailed Patton's actions at both hospitals.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=115}}

By 18 August, Eisenhower had ordered that Patton's Seventh Army be broken up, with a few of its units remaining garrisoned in Sicily. The majority of its combat forces would be transferred to the [[Fifth United States Army]] under Lieutenant General [[Mark W. Clark]]. This had already been planned by Eisenhower, who had previously told Patton that his Seventh Army would not be part of the upcoming [[Allied invasion of Italy]], scheduled for September.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=327}} On 20 August, Patton received a cable from Eisenhower regarding the arrival of Lucas at Palermo. Eisenhower told Patton it was "highly important" that he personally meet with Lucas as soon as possible, as Lucas would be carrying an important message.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=328}} Before Lucas arrived, Blesse arrived from [[Algiers]] to look into the health of the troops in Sicily. He was also ordered by Eisenhower to deliver a secret letter to Patton and investigate its allegations. In the letter, Eisenhower told Patton he had been informed of the slapping incidents. He said he would not be opening a formal investigation into the matter, but his criticism of Patton was sharp.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=329}}

{{quote|I clearly understand that firm and drastic measures are at times necessary in order to secure the desired objectives. But this does not excuse brutality, abuse of the sick, nor exhibition of uncontrollable temper in front of subordinates.&amp;nbsp; ... I feel that the personal services you have rendered the United States and the Allied cause during the past weeks are of incalculable value; but nevertheless if there is a very considerable element of truth in the allegations accompanying this letter, I must so seriously question your good judgment and your self-discipline as to raise serious doubts in my mind as to your future usefulness.|Eisenhower's letter to Patton, dated 17 August 1943{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=329}} }}

Eisenhower noted that no formal record of the incidents would be retained at Allied Headquarters, save in his own secret files. Still, he strongly suggested Patton apologize to all involved.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=330}}{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=119}} On 21 August, Patton brought Bennett into his office; he apologized and the men shook hands.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=334}} On 22 August, he met with Currier as well as the medical staff who had witnessed the events in each unit and expressed regret for his "impulsive actions." Patton related to the medical staff a story of a friend from World War I who had committed [[suicide]] after "skulking"; he stated he sought to prevent any recurrence of such an event. On 23 August, he brought Kuhl into his office, apologized, and shook hands with him as well.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=336}} After the apology, Kuhl said he thought Patton was "a great general," and that "at the time, he didn't know how sick I was."{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=336}} Currier later said Patton's remarks sounded like "no apology at all, an attempt to justify what he had done."{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=336}} Patton wrote in his diary that he loathed making the apologies, particularly when he was told by Bennett's brigade commander, Brigadier General John A. Crane, that Bennett had gone [[AWOL|absent without leave (AWOL)]] and arrived at the hospital by "falsely representing his condition."{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=334}} Patton wrote, "It is rather a commentary on justice when an Army commander has to soft-soap a skulker to placate the timidity of those above."{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=334}} As word of the actions had spread informally among troops of the Seventh Army, Patton drove to each [[division (military)|division]] under his command between 24 and 30 August and gave a 15-minute speech in which he praised their behavior and apologized for any instances where he had been too harsh on soldiers, making only vague reference to the two slapping incidents.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=338}} In his final apology speech to the [[U.S. 3rd Infantry Division]], Patton was overcome with emotion when the soldiers supportively began to chant "No, general, no, no," to prevent him from having to apologize.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=342}}

In a letter to General George Marshall on 24 August, Eisenhower praised Patton's exploits as commander of the Seventh Army and his conduct of the Sicily campaign, particularly his ability to take initiative as a commander. Still, Eisenhower noted Patton continued "to exhibit some of those unfortunate traits of which you and I have always known."{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=337}} He informed Marshall of the two incidents and his requirement that Patton apologize. Eisenhower stated he believed Patton would cease his behavior "because fundamentally, he is so avid for recognition as a great military commander that he will ruthlessly suppress any habit of his that will tend to jeopardize it."{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=338}} When Eisenhower arrived in Sicily to award Montgomery the [[Legion of Merit]] on 29 August, Patton gave him a letter expressing his remorse about the incidents.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=341}}

=== Media attention ===
Word of the slapping incidents spread informally among soldiers before eventually circulating to [[war correspondent]]s. One of the nurses who witnessed the 10 August incident apparently told her boyfriend, a captain in the Seventh Army [[Public affairs (military)|public affairs]] detachment. Through him, a group of four journalists covering the Sicily operation heard of the incident, among them Demaree Bess of the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'', [[Merrill Mueller]] of [[NBC News]], Al Newman of ''[[Newsweek]]'', and [[John Charles Daly]] of [[CBS News]].  The four journalists interviewed Etter and other witnesses, but decided to bring the matter to Eisenhower instead of filing the story with their editors. Bess, Mueller, and [[Quentin Reynolds]] of ''[[Collier's Magazine]]'' flew from Sicily to Algiers, and on 19 August Bess gave a summary on the slapping incidents to Eisenhower's [[chief of staff]], Major General [[Walter Bedell Smith]].{{sfn|D'Este|1995|pp=535–536}} The reporters asked Eisenhower directly about the incident, and Eisenhower requested that the story be suppressed because the war effort could not afford to lose Patton. Bess and other journalists initially complied.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=119}} However, the news reporters then demanded Eisenhower fire Patton in exchange for them not reporting the story, a demand which Eisenhower refused.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|pp=535–536}}

The story of Kuhl's slapping broke in the U.S. when newspaper columnist [[Drew Pearson (journalist)|Drew Pearson]] revealed it on his 21 November radio program.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=120}} Pearson received details of the Kuhl incident and other material on Patton from his friend [[Ernest Cuneo]], an official with the [[Office of Strategic Services]], who obtained the information from War Department files and correspondence.{{sfn|Hirshson|2003|p=424}} Pearson's version not only conflated details of both slapping incidents but falsely reported that the private in question was visibly "out of his head", telling Patton to "duck down or the shells would hit him" and that in response "Patton struck the soldier, knocking him down."{{sfn|Sweeney|2000|p=158}} Pearson punctuated his broadcast by twice stating that Patton would never again be used in combat, despite the fact that Pearson had no factual basis for this prediction.{{sfn|Sweeney|2000|p=158}}{{sfn|Nimmo|Newsome|1997|p=274}} In response, Allied Headquarters denied that Patton had received an official reprimand, but confirmed that Patton had slapped at least one soldier.{{Sfn|Edey|1968|pp=160–166}}

Patton's wife, Beatrice Patton, spoke to the media to defend him. She appeared in ''[[True Confessions (magazine)|True Confessions]]'', a women's [[confession magazine]], where she characterized Patton as "the toughest, most hard boiled General in the U.S. Army&amp;nbsp; ... but he's quite sweet, really."{{Sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=380}} She was featured in a ''[[Washington Post]]'' article on 26 November. While she did not attempt to justify Patton's action, she characterized him as a "tough perfectionist," stating that he cared deeply about the men under his command and would not ask them to do something he would not do himself:{{Sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=379}}

{{quote|He had been known to weep at men's graves—as well as tear their hides off. The deed is done and the mistake made, and I'm sure Georgie is sorrier and has punished himself more than anyone could possibly realize. I've known George Patton for 31 years and I've never known him to be deliberately unfair. He's made mistakes—and he's paid for them. This was a big mistake, and he's paying a big price for it.|Beatrice Patton in the ''Washington Post'', 26 November 1943{{Sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=380}}}}

=== Public response ===
Demands for Patton to be relieved of duty and sent home were made in Congress and in newspapers across the country.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=120}}{{Sfn|Edey|1968|pp=160–166}} [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Jed Johnson (Oklahoma)|Jed Johnson]] of [[Oklahoma's 6th congressional district|Oklahoma's 6th district]] described Patton's actions as a "despicable incident" and was "amazed and chagrined" Patton was still in command. He called for the general's immediate dismissal on the grounds that his actions rendered him no longer useful to the war effort.{{Sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=377}} Representative [[Charles B. Hoeven]] of [[Iowa's 9th congressional district|Iowa's 9th district]] said on the House floor that parents of soldiers need no longer worry of their children being abused by "hard boiled officers". He wondered whether the Army had "too much blood and guts."{{Sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=380}} Eisenhower submitted a report to Secretary of War [[Henry L. Stimson]], who presented it to Senator [[Robert R. Reynolds]], Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Senate Committee on Military Affairs]]. The report laid out Eisenhower's response to the incident and gave details of Patton's decades of military service. Eisenhower concluded that Patton was invaluable to the war effort and that he was confident the corrective actions taken would be adequate. Investigators Eisenhower sent to Patton's command found the general remained overwhelmingly popular with his troops.{{Sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=376}}

By mid-December, the government had received around 1,500 letters related to Patton, with many calling for his dismissal and others defending him or calling for his promotion.{{Sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=377}}  Kuhl's father, Herman F. Kuhl, wrote to his own congressman, stating that he forgave Patton for the incident and requesting that he not be disciplined.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|pp=543–544}} Retired generals also weighed in on the matter. Former Army Chief of Staff [[Charles P. Summerall]] wrote to Patton that he was "indignant about the publicity given a trifling incident", adding that "whatever [Patton] did" he was sure it was "justified by the provocation. Such cowards used to be shot, now they are only encouraged."{{Sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=378}} Major General [[Kenyon A. Joyce]], another combat commander and one of Patton's friends, attacked Pearson as a "sensation mongerer," stating that "niceties" should be left for "softer times of peace."{{Sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=383}} In one notable dissension, Patton's friend, former mentor and [[General of the Armies]] [[John J. Pershing]] publicly condemned his actions, an act that left Patton "deeply hurt" and caused him to never speak to Pershing again.{{Sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=379}}

After consulting with Marshall, Stimson, and Assistant Secretary of War [[John J. McCloy]],{{sfn|D'Este|2002|p=442}} Eisenhower retained Patton in the European theater, though his Seventh Army saw no further combat. Patton remained in Sicily for the rest of the year. Marshall and Stimson not only supported Eisenhower's decision, but defended it. In a letter to the [[U.S. Senate]], Stimson stated that Patton must be retained because of the need for his "aggressive, winning leadership in the bitter battles which are to come before final victory."{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=543}} Stimson acknowledged retaining Patton was a poor move for public relations but remained confident it was the right decision militarily.{{Sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=377}}

== Effect on plans for invasion of Europe ==
Contrary to his statements to Patton, Eisenhower never seriously considered removing the general from duty in the European Theater. Writing of the incident before the media attention, he said, "If this thing ever gets out, they'll be howling for Patton's scalp, and that will be the end of Georgie's service in this war. I simply cannot let that happen. Patton is indispensable to the war effort&amp;nbsp;– one of the guarantors of our victory."{{sfn|D'Este|1995|pp=535–536}} Still, following the capture of Messina in August 1943, Patton did not command a force in combat for 11 months.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=122}}
[[File:General of the Army Omar Bradley.jpg|thumb|left|Omar Bradley, whom Eisenhower selected to lead the US ground forces on the [[invasion of Normandy]] over Patton. Bradley, Patton's former subordinate, would become Patton's superior in the final months of the war.]]

Patton was passed over to lead the invasion in northern Europe. In September, Bradley—Patton's junior in both rank and experience—was selected to command the [[First United States Army]] that was forming in [[United Kingdom|England]] to prepare for [[Operation Overlord]].{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=345}} According to Eisenhower, this decision had been made months before the slapping incidents became public knowledge, but Patton felt they were the reason he was denied the command.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=121}} Eisenhower had already decided on Bradley because he felt the invasion of Europe was too important to risk any uncertainty. While Eisenhower and Marshall both considered Patton to be a superb corps-level combat commander, Bradley possessed two of the traits that a [[theater (warfare)|theater]]-level strategic command required, and that Patton conspicuously lacked: a calm, reasoned demeanor, and a meticulously consistent nature. The slapping incidents had only further confirmed to Eisenhower that Patton lacked the ability to exercise discipline and self-control at such a command level.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=348}} Still, Eisenhower re-emphasized his confidence in Patton's skill as a ground combat commander by recommending him for promotion to [[four-star general]] in a private letter to Marshall on 8 September, noting his previous combat exploits and admitting that he had a "driving power" that Bradley lacked.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=349}}

By mid-December, Eisenhower had been appointed [[Supreme Allied Commander]] in Europe and moved to England. As media attention surrounding the incident began to subside, McCloy told Patton he would indeed be eventually returning to combat command.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=387}} Patton was briefly considered to lead the Seventh Army in [[Operation Dragoon]], but Eisenhower felt his experience would be more useful in the [[Invasion of Normandy|Normandy campaign]].{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=399}} Eisenhower and Marshall privately agreed that Patton would command a follow-on [[field army]] after Bradley's army conducted the initial invasion of Normandy; Bradley would then command the resulting [[army group]]. Patton was told on 1 January 1944 only that he would be relieved of command of the Seventh Army and moved to Europe. In his diary, he wrote that he would resign if he was not given command of a field army.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|pp=390–394}} On 26 January 1944, formally given command of a newly arrived unit, the [[Third United States Army]], he went to the United Kingdom to prepare the unit's inexperienced soldiers for combat.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=407}}{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=124}} This duty occupied Patton throughout early 1944.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=423}}

Exploiting Patton's situation, Eisenhower sent him on several high-profile trips throughout the Mediterranean in late 1943.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=366}} He traveled to Algiers, [[Tunis]], [[Corsica]], [[Cairo]], [[Jerusalem]], and [[Malta]] in an effort to confuse German commanders as to where the Allied forces might next attack.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=120}} By the next year, the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]] still had more respect for Patton than for any other Allied commander and considered him central to any plan to invade Europe from the north.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=127}} Because of this, Patton was made a central figure in [[Operation Fortitude]] in early 1944.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=409}} The Allies fed the German intelligence organizations, through double agents, a steady stream of false intelligence that Patton had been named commander of the [[First United States Army Group]] (FUSAG) and was preparing for an invasion of [[Pas de Calais]]. The FUSAG command was actually an intricately constructed "phantom" army of decoys, props and radio signals based around southeast England to mislead German aircraft and to make Axis leaders believe a large force was massing there. Patton was ordered to keep a low profile to deceive the Germans into thinking he was in Dover throughout early 1944, when he was actually training the Third Army.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=127}} As a result of Operation Fortitude, the [[15th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 15th Army]] remained at Pas de Calais to defend against the expected attack.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=128}} The formation remained there even after the invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944. Patton and the Third Army traveled to Europe and entered combat in July.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=132}}

A [[referendum]] to decide whether or not [[Greece]] was to accept the conditions under which the [[European Union]] (EU), the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB) would allow a 50% [[Haircut (finance)|haircut]] of Greek debt owed to private creditors was planned to be held in 2011.&lt;ref name="Skai Papandreou"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/politics/article/184900/dimopsifisma-kai-psifo-ebistosunis-zitise-o-prothupourgos-/ |title=Ρίσκα και αβεβαιότητες από την πολιτική "βόμβα" για δημοψήφισμα |trans-title=Risks and uncertainties by the political "bomb" for a referendum |publisher=[[Skai TV]] |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Prime Minister [[George Papandreou]] decided to cancel the referendum on 3 November,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hoping Greece Scraps Referendum, Dow Leaps 208|url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/investing/2011/11/03/hoping-referendum-is-scrapped-dow-leaps-200/|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; if the opposition parties vote in favour of the EU deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Papandreou scraps Greek referendum as open warfare erupts in his party |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/03/papandreou-scraps-greek-referendum-euro |publisher=Guardian|accessdate=4 November 2011|location=London|first1=Helena|last1=Smith|first2=David|last2=Gow|date=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed referendum was later cancelled.

==Background==
On 31 October 2011,&lt;ref name="Euronews Referendum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euronews.net/2011/10/31/papandreou-calls-referendum-on-eu-deal-/ |title=Papandreou calls referendum on EU deal |publisher=[[Euronews]] |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Referendum"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15526719 |title=Greece debt crisis: Referendum promised on EU deal |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=31 October 2011 |date=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister [[George Papandreou]] announced the referendum saying that: "We need wide consensus (for the aid programme). We are part of the eurozone [which means] many rights and many obligations. We will live up to our obligations."&lt;ref name="date"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-11/03/c_131226777.htm |title=Greek referendum possibly held on Dec. 4: Greek PM |work=Xinhuanet |accessdate=3 November 2011 |date=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constitutional issues have arisen with regards to such a referendum, as Article 44 of the [[constitution of Greece]] specifies that referenda on critical national matters and social bills are permitted while referenda on fiscal bills are not.&lt;ref name="Skai Syntagma"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/politics/article/184903/ti-vlepei-to-sudagma-sto-arthro-44-gia-to-dimopsifisma-/ |title=Τι προβλέπει το Σύνταγμα στο άρθρο 44 για το δημοψήφισμα |trans-title=What the Article 44 of the Constitution provides for referenda |publisher=[[Skai TV]] |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was to be Greece's first referendum not having to do with a change in the form of government,&lt;ref name="Agelioforos Dimopsifismata"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agelioforos.gr/default.asp?pid=7&amp;ct=1&amp;artid=116784 |title=Τα 7 δημοψήφισμα του νεοελληνικού κράτους |trans-title=The 7 referenda of the modern Greek state |work=Agelioforos |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first referendum [[Greek republic referendum, 1974|since 1974]].&lt;ref name="Agelioforos Dimopsifismata" /&gt;

==Date==
Papandreou suggested the referendum would be held on 4 December.&lt;ref name="date"/&gt; However, [[Minister for Finance (Greece)|Finance Minister]] [[Evangelos Venizelos]] specified that the referendum would take place in 2012, after the plans for the haircut had been finalised.&lt;ref name="Skai Venizelos"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/politics/article/184902/eu-venizelos-apo-to-neo-etos-to-dimopsifisma-/ |title=Ευ.

==Opinion polls==
Polls in Greece suggested that up to 60% of Greeks were against the deal reached with the EU over Greek debt on 27 October 2011,&lt;ref name="Euronews Referendum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Referendum" /&gt; however a survey in September 2011 showed that 63% of Greeks viewed the [[euro]] as something positive.&lt;ref name="Public Issue Evro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publicissue.gr/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/eurosurvey-09-2011.pdf |title=Οι Έλληνες, το Ευρώ και η Δραχμή Νο. 2 |trans-title=The Greeks, the Euro and the Drachma No. 2 |publisher=Public Issue ([[Kathimerini]]) |accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same survey showed that 66% of Greeks viewed the return to the [[drachma]] as something negative.&lt;ref name="Public Issue Evro" /&gt;

==Response==
===Domestic===
The initial response of the [[List of political parties in Greece|Greek political parties]] was negative.&lt;ref name="Enet Omovrontia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.politikh&amp;id=322397 |title=Ομοβροντία από την αντιπολίτευση που ζητάει εκλογές |trans-title=Opposition bursts, demanding elections |work=[[Eleftherotypia]] |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] leader [[Antonis Samaras]] described it as an "indirect national schism",&lt;ref name="Enet Omovrontia" /&gt; while most opposition parties demanded elections&lt;ref name="Enet Omovrontia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ethnos KKE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnos.gr/article.asp?catid=22767&amp;subid=2&amp;pubid=63507374 |title=ΚΚΕ: Εκλογές τώρα |trans-title=Communist Party of Greece: Elections now |publisher=Ethnos |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ethnos ND"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnos.gr/article.asp?catid=22767&amp;subid=2&amp;pubid=63507382 |title=ΝΔ: Ο Παπανδρέου πατάει γκάζι για το γκρεμό |trans-title=New Democracy: Papandreou is heading full speed ahead for the cliff |work=Ethnos |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ethnos DA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnos.gr/article.asp?catid=22767&amp;subid=2&amp;pubid=63507380 |title=Δημοκρατική Αριστερά: Ας προχωρήσει η χώρα σε πρόωρες εκλογές |trans-title=Democratic Left: Let the country head for elections |work=Ethnos |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and condemned the government for what they perceived to be a maneuvre to avoid early elections.&lt;ref name="Enet Omovrontia" /&gt; [[Konstantinos Mitsotakis]], Prime Minister of Greece between 1990 and 1993, described the move to hold a referendum as utterly irrational and irresponsible.&lt;ref name="Neoi Fakeloi Mitsotakis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/player/TV/?MMID=220465 |title=Νέοι Φάκελοι 31/10/2011 |trans-title=New Folders 31/10/2011 |publisher=New Folders ([[Skai TV]]) |accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek media also adopted a negative stance, with many calling it a coercive move.&lt;ref name="Skai Mparouti"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/opinions/article/184916/helladastomparmpouti/ |title=Η Ελλάδα στο μπαρμπούτι |trans-title=Greece on "gunpowder" |publisher=[[Skai TV]] |accessdate=1 November 2011 |quote=Με το εκβιαστικό, και εξ ορισμού σχηματικό δίλημμα, που θέτει η κυβέρνηση, όπως και αν αυτό διατυπωθεί, επιχειρεί να πετάξει το μπαλάκι στον λαό• “υπερήφανε ελληνικέ λαέ είτε ψηφίζεις 'ναι' και αποδέχεσαι έτσι αδιαμαρτύρητα το μείγμα των όποιων πολιτικών μας, είτε ψηφίζεις 'όχι', απορρίπτεις τη συμφωνία με τα πλεονεκτήματά της ("κούρεμα" του χρέους, χαμηλότερα επιτόκια, δανειακή στήριξη ύψους 100 δισ. ευρώ) και τότε φταις εσύ και όχι το πολιτικό προσωπικό για τα επιγενόμενα. ["With the coercive, by definition, delemma that the government sets, however this may be worded, it is attempting to throw the ball on the side of the people; 'proud Greek people you either vote 'yes' and thus accept this government and its politicians without further protests, or you vote 'no' and you turn down the agreement (of 27 October) with the benefits it brings ("haircut" on the debt, lower interest rates, a loan of 100 billion euro) and then its your fault, and not the fault of the country's ruling politicians."] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Enet Vofatai"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.politikh&amp;id=322416 |title=Φοβάται τις κάλπες και πετάει το μπαλάκι με δημοψήφισμα |trans-title=He's afraid of elections and he's "throwing the ball" with the referendum |work=[[Eleftherotypia]] |accessdate=1 November 2011 |quote=Επί της ουσίας, ο κ.

["Basically, Mr. Papandreou is throwing the ball to the people for a very big and crucial decision for the future of the country and through the referendum puts forth the coercive delemma of 'you either vote yes, or the country is going bust'."] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the announcement of the referendum on 31 October 2011, 1 November saw the resignation of one MP from the ruling party,&lt;ref name="Enet Milena"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.politikh&amp;id=322623 |title=Φυλλορροεί το ΠΑΣΟΚ, ανεξαρτητοποιήθηκε και η Μιλένα |trans-title=Defoliation of PASOK, Milena becomes independent |work=[[Eleftherotypia]] |accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; lowering Papandreou's government majority to 152 seats&lt;ref name="Enet Milena" /&gt; in the 300-seat [[Hellenic Parliament]]. An additional six members of Papandreou's [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] have demanded early elections.&lt;ref name="Enet Saki"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.politikh&amp;id=322611 |title=Το ΠΑΣΟΚ είναι πλέον άδειο σακί |trans-title=PASOK is now an empty sack |work=[[Eleftherotypia]] |accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early hours of 2 November 2011, George Papandreou and his cabinet decided to speed up the referendum process,&lt;ref name="Skai Epispeusi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/politics/article/185021/g-papandreou-tin-paraskeui-krinodai-ola-se-thesmiko-epipedo/ |title=Επίσπευση του δημοψηφίσματος αποφάσισε το υπουργικό |trans-title=Cabinet meetings decided to speed up referendum |publisher=[[Skai TV]] |accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attacked the Greek media by calling them bankrupt and accusing them of having "gone mad" over the referendum.&lt;ref name="Skai Epispeusi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Enet Lysaksan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.politikh&amp;id=322687 |title=Λύσσαξε με τα "χρεωμένα ΜΜΕ", δίνει εξηγήσεις σε Ευρωπαίους και ΔΝΤ |trans-title=He went mad over the "bankrupt media", he is to give explanations to Europe and the IMF |work=[[Eleftherotypia]] |accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally the cabinet decided that a committee would be set up to decide the time when the referendum would take place and the question that people would be asked to vote on,&lt;ref name="Skai Epispeusi" /&gt; but only after the basic characteristics of the new memorandum with the Troika had been decided.&lt;ref name="Skai Epispeusi" /&gt; During that cabinet meeting, a number of ministers expressed concerns over the referendum.&lt;ref name="Skai Epispeusi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="To Vima ypourgiko"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tovima.gr/politics/article/?aid=428059&amp;h1=true |title=Επιμένει ο Πρωθυπουργός στο δημοψήφισμα - επιφυλάξεις υπουργών |trans-title=Prime Minister set on referendum - ministers express concerns |work=[[To Vima]] |accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Financial markets
The [[Athex]] stock market index fell amid concerns for instability,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_04/11/2011_413373&lt;/ref&gt; as well as global financial markets on concerns about EU stability and a possible Greek default on its debt.&lt;ref name="economictimes.indiatimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/global-markets/greece-crisis-asian-shares-rally-over-3-on-hopes-greece-will-drop-referendum/articleshow/10604191.cms |deadurl=yes |work=The Times Of India |title=Greece Crisis: Asian shares rally over 3% on hopes Greece will drop referendum - The Economic Times |date=4 November 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111217093842/http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/global-markets/greece-crisis-asian-shares-rally-over-3-on-hopes-greece-will-drop-referendum/articleshow/10604191.cms |archivedate=December 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cancellation====
On 3 November, Papandreou reneged on his promise and announced that the referendum would not take place after all&lt;ref name="Zero Hedge"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zerohedge.com/news/greek-pm-tells-sky-news-he-has-scrapped-referendum-watch-sky-coverage-euro-crisis-live/ |title=Greek PM Tells Sky News He Has Scrapped Referendum: Watch Sky Coverage Of Euro Crisis Live |trans-title=Greek PM Tells Sky News He Has Scrapped Referendum: Watch Sky Coverage Of Euro Crisis Live |publisher=[[Sky News]] |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the opposition of four ministers, including Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos, who opposed the referendum amid calls for Papandreou to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-15575198 | work=BBC News | title=Greek PM Papandreou 'ready to drop' bailout referendum | date=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that the Greek presence in the eurozone "cannot depend on a referendum." Several MPs also resigned following the decision, with [[Nikos Salayannis]] said that: "The referendum is dead."&lt;ref&gt;http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2011/11/201111310743878884.html&lt;/ref&gt; In response, global financial markets rose.&lt;ref name="economictimes.indiatimes.com"/&gt; Following an emergency visit to [[Cannes]] for the [[2011 G-20 Cannes summit]], where Papandreou faced pressure to call off the referendum, New Democracy's spokesman Yiannis Michelakis said that "the comments made by Mr Papandreou, as well as those by [French President] Nicolas Sarkozy and [German Chancellor] [[Angela Merkel]], revealed that he suggested to them that in Greece there is a supposed questioning of whether Greece should remain in the eurozone and the European Union. It is clear that no such problem exists and that Mr Papandreou – through sudden and despicable misinformation – is trying to create it himself." Party chairperson Antonis Samaras also said that "the only problem that exists is Mr Papandreou remaining as prime minister,” said Michelakis. “He is dangerous and he has to go."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_4080_03/11/2011_412992&lt;/ref&gt;

The referendum was later canceled amidst domestic and foreign pressure. U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] said that though the G20 summit in Cannes sought to alleviate [[European sovereign debt]] concerns the "actions of Papandreou and the referendum issue got a lot of people nervous" and the EU proposal was "still the best recipe." Dutch Prime Minister [[Mark Rutte]] said the cancellation was a good decision amidst possible eurozone impatience with Greece. "It was a bizarre proposal. We think it’s of great importance to the eurozone that we prevent Greece from going bankrupt. But in the end, the euro is more important than Greece’s membership of the eurozone." Conversely former German Chancellor [[Gerhard Schroeder]] said that: "It’s no surprise Papandreou hardly had a chance to push through what was being demanded from him. The conservatives across Europe did very little to convince the Greek conservative opposition to stop acting irresponsibly."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_05/11/2011_413386&lt;/ref&gt;

During discussions for a [[vote of confidence]] held on 4 November 2011, Evangelos Venizelos, the Greek Minister of Finance, expressed his view that the decision on whether or not Greece should remain in the Eurozone is not something that should not be put to a referendum,&lt;ref name="Skai Venizelos Dimopsifisma"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/politics/article/185120/apostaseis-venizelou-apo-to-dimopsifisma-/ |title=Όχι» Ευάγγελου Βενιζέλου στο δημοψήφισμα |trans-title="No" by Evangelos Venizelos on the referendum |work=[[Skai TV]] |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and called for a [[National unity government|government of national unity]].&lt;ref name="Skai Venizelos Dimopsifisma" /&gt; On 3 November, two other members of Papandreou's parliamentary group announced they would not give the government a vote of confidence.&lt;ref name="Skai Kaili"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/politics/article/185135/eua-kaili-den-tha-parasho-psifo-ebistosunis-/ |title=Εύα Καϊλή: Δεν θα παράσχω ψήφο εμπιστοσύνης |trans-title=Eva Kaili: I will not give a vote of confidence |work=[[Skai TV]] |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skai Katareusi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/politics/article/185126/anatarahi-sto-pasok-me-fodo-to-dimopsifisma-/ |title=Υπό κατάρρευση η Κυβέρνηση - Ραγδαίες εξελίξεις |trans-title=Government collapsing - Rapid developments |work=[[Skai TV]] |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lowered the ruling party's parliamentary group votes to 150, which was below the threshold for majority in the parliament (151 seats). Dimitris Lintzeris, a PASOK MP, said that "Papandreou is past"&lt;ref name="Skai Lintzeris"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/politics/article/185136/d-lidzeris-o-k-papandreou-sunista-parelthon/ |title=Δ.

Παπανδρέου συνιστά παρελθόν |trans-title=Dimitris Lintzeris: Mr. Papandreou is now past |work=[[Skai TV]] |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "he continues to act carelessly and turns his failure into a coercive [referendum]".&lt;ref name="Skai Lintzeris" /&gt;

Amid concerns that Greece could leave the eurozone dependent on the referendum result, Papandreou faced a vote of confidence in parliament on 4 November. He said that "I ask for the vote of confidence to avert the instability that would be caused if the country is dragged into elections. Now is the time for cooperation with good intentions and a feeling of national responsibility."&lt;ref name="newgovt"/&gt; Before the vote he pledged to step down saying that re-election was not important to him, thus avoiding infighting within PASOK;&lt;ref name="talks"/&gt; he also said that he would seek a coalition government for four months in order to pass the new EU debt agreement,&lt;ref name="vote"/&gt; though New Democracy rejected such a motion to join a coalition government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15604169 | work=BBC News | title=Greek PM Papandreou faces unity challenge over bailout | date=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motion passed with a vote of 153-145 in the 300 seat parliament, after PASOK's 152 MPs and [[Louka Katseli]], formerly a member of PASOK, supported the prime minister. She was then brought back into the party fold.&lt;ref name="vote"&gt;http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2011/11/2011114212835975841.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=====New government=====
Following the vote of confidence, Papandreou met President [[Karolos Papoulias]] the next day to begin talks on forming a new coalition government. Papandreou also said that he would resign and allow another interim prime minister. Though New Democracy's Samaras demanded a [[snap election]], an interim coalition government could have possibly involved [[Popular Orthodox Rally]], [[Democratic Alliance (Greece)|Democratic Alliance]] and/or the [[Democratic Left (Greece)|Democratic Left]]. However, Democratic Alliance chairperson [[Dora Bakoyannis]] said that an interim government to pass the EU demanded austerity measures must include New Democracy to make the government viable.&lt;ref name="newgovt"/&gt; Bakoyiannis also added that "there is no point in us supporting Papandreou without Samaras, we don't have enough votes to make a difference anyway. We'll support a coalition and vote with them, without any demands of positions, if Papandreou and Samaras can work it out."&lt;ref name="wsj"/&gt; Though Samaras continued to demand a new election in saying that was the only option for "stabilisation of the country, to restore its image, and to emerge sooner from this nightmare,"&lt;ref name="talks"/&gt; he also added that an interim coalition government was a good idea in order to pass the bailout bill. Papandreou also said that: "My aim is to immediately create a government of co-operation. A lack of consensus would worry our European partners about our country's membership of the eurozone."&lt;ref name="talks"/&gt; He added that forming a coalition meant that he would "do whatever I can to help form a coalition government. The Oct. 26 decisions and obligations stemming from this are a condition for the country remaining in the euro." An anonymous member of PASOK suggested that Papandreou believed that Venizelos was the most appropriate person to head am interim coalition government as "Venizelos is the main negotiator in Europe, so there will be continuity, although New Democracy is fiercely against this proposal." Papandreou also hoped that a new government would be formed by 7 November, before eurozone finance ministers meet in Brussels to discuss the next scheduled bailout fund for Greece. However, according to PASOK, Papandreou would not resign until there was clarification on who would lead the coalition government and that he wanted a new government in the following week. LAOS also added that Samaras should reconsider his position as forming a coalition government has been "achieved with the departure of Papandreou from power."&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20111105-701027.html | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=3rd UPDATE: Greek PM Begins Efforts To Form Coalition Government | date=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos added that an interim administration would serve until the end of February, after which a new [[Next Greek legislative election|election]] would be called following the passage of the 8-billion-euro loan tranche.&lt;ref name="newgovt"&gt;http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_05/11/2011_413394&lt;/ref&gt; Papandreou added that "elections at this moment not only equal disaster but could not take place in the best interest of the people. There is one solution. To support the [EU bailout] deal with a multiparty approach, without elections, with a strong government" and that he sought to "immediately create a government of co-operation [because] a lack of consensus would worry our European partners about our country's membership of the eurozone."&lt;ref name="talks"&gt;http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2011/11/201111591628572478.html&lt;/ref&gt; An unnamed senior member of PASOK said that Papandreou would resign as soon as a new government is formed, possibly on the night of 6 November.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2011/11/201111613435173466.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 November, Papandreou and Samaras agreed to the formation of a new coalition government that would not be led by Papandreou&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57319394/greek-pm-to-step-down-for-new-government/ | work=CBS News | title=Greek PM to step down for new government}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2011/11/greece-deal-new-government-euro.html | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Greeks in deal on new government in bid to save bailout, euro}}&lt;/ref&gt; following a meeting with Papoulias. Papoulias' office issues a statement that read the leader of the government would be decided by the leaders of the largest parties the following day, but it did no mention the tenure of the government. However, Papandreou said that "it is clear that this government will pass the baton but it will not pass it to a void - it will pass it to a new government, if we agree on it, and I hope this will happen soon. I'm not interested in being prime minister in the new government;" he also added that a new election should not be held before February or March until the bailout legislation is approved by parliament The announcement also followed a European Union deadline before a finance minister meeting on 7 November about the formation of a government and the enactment of a bailout agreement. Papoulias said that "an agreement was reached to form a new government to immediately lead the country to elections after ratifying the decisions taken by the European Council."&lt;ref&gt;http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2011/11/2011116203756981236.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lucas Papademos]] was suggested as the possible leader of a new government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/07/lucas-papademos-frontrunner-greek-pm | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Helena | last=Smith | title=Lucas Papademos emerges as frontrunner to be new Greek PM | date=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later agreed to be the interim prime minister until a future election.&lt;ref name="english.aljazeera.net"&gt;http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2011/11/201111895652345832.html&lt;/ref&gt; At the last minute there was controversy over Papademos amongst both PASOK and New Democracy and a joint announcement for the new PM was put off till 10 November. Samaras blamed PASOK for the delay saying that the [[constitution of Greece|constitution]] demanded that the ruling party had the prerogative to name a candidate for prime minister.

In what ''Al Jazeera'' called an "apparent farewell address" Papandreou said on television that: "We have agreed on someone who will unite us. I would like to wish every success to the new prime minister and of course the new government. I will stand by them and I will support them with all my strength."&lt;ref name="english.aljazeera.net"/&gt;

Only two candidates were elected in the first round, which was marked by a very low turnout.

'''''Is He Dead?''''' is a play by [[Mark Twain]]. Written by Twain in 1898, it was first published in print in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is He Dead? A comedy in three acts|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/10118.html|accessdate=2007-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; after Mark Twain scholar [[Shelley Fisher Fishkin]] read the manuscript in the archives of the Mark Twain Papers at the [[University of California at Berkeley]]. The play was long known to scholars but never attracted much attention until Fishkin arranged to have it published in book form. She later played a primary role in getting the play produced on Broadway. Contemporary American playwright [[David Ives]] adapted the play for the modern stage before its inaugural performance in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Playscripts Inc. - 'Is He Dead?' adapted by David Ives|url=http://www.playscripts.com/play.php3?playid=1365|accessdate=2013-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Playscripts, Inc. - Production History - 'Is He Dead?' adapted by David Ives|url=http://www.playscripts.com/productions.php3?playid=1365}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Is He Dead?'' is now published and licensed for theatrical use by Playscripts, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playscripts.com playscripts.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

The play focuses on a fictional version of the great French painter, [[Jean-François Millet]], as an impoverished artist in [[Barbizon]], France who, with the help of his colleagues, stages his death in order to increase the value of his paintings, and afterwards dresses as a woman to keep his secret safe. Combining elements of [[burlesque]], [[farce]], and social [[satire]], the comedy relies on such devices as [[cross-dressing]], mistaken identities, and romantic deceptions to tell its story, which raises questions about fame, greed, and the value of art.

The next day, Dutchy and O'Shaughnessy are driving up the prices of Millet's paintings, while Chicago has leaked to the press that Millet has come down with a terminal disease and has gone to the Barbary Coast to live out his remaining days. (This becomes a running gag as whenever a character asks where the Barbary Coast is, no one can answer.) Millet comes out dressed as the Widow and complains about his costume but Chicago assures him the plan will work (even though the Widow has trouble acting like a woman.) Indeed, everyone is overjoyed when Thorpe comes back to buy some paintings and buys three paintings (two of which aren't even Millet's) for 100,000 francs, instantly freeing them of their debt. The Widow is then forced to have tea with Mdme. Bathilde and Mdme. Caron alone, but they take her strange behavior as signs of grief over her brother's death. The Leroux family arrives to wait for Andre. Cecile becomes suspicious with the way the Widow and Chicago interact with each other while Marie is depressed over Millet. Andre arrives and the Widow hands him two checks to pay off the debts and stands up against his cruel behavior. Andre declares that since now the paintings are worth far more than the checks, he will take them instead. When the Widow asks if there is anything she can do to stop him, he says he will not do it if the Widow marries him! The Widow faints into Dutchy and O'Shaughnessy's arms as the act ends.

Act 2 begins months later in the Widow's new luxurious apartment in downtown Paris. Everyone is now rich because of the value of the paintings and the Widow has a butler named Charlie. Millet has since been declared dead and today is the day of Millet's funeral. Andre has continued attempting to court the Widow and Papa Leroux has even become smitten with "her" and proposes while they are alone. The Widow struggles to keep him at bay, when Inspector Lefoux (actually Cecile in disguise) comes to question the Widow over Millet's death and her relationship with Chicago. To keep the two at bay, the Widow admits Chicago is her lover. When Charlie announces more visitors, the Widow has them wait in separate rooms. Mdme. Bathilde and Mdme. Caron arrive with Marie, grieving over Millet's "death". The Widow talks to Marie alone, while the other two wait with Leroux in another room. Marie tells the Widow that Andre truly loves "her" and "she" should marry him. Andre then arrives and tells the Widow the second she says yes to marriage, the contract is destroyed. Once he is gone, Chicago, Dutchy, and O'Shaughnessy arrive with Millet's casket (which is closed and filled with bricks). The trio are excited by the stir Millet's death has caused: prices are higher than ever and the King of France is even attending the funeral. As they celebrate, Marie comes back and shames them. As Marie and the Widow continue talking, Marie says she will never marry and then the Widow gets an idea.

The Widow reveals the disguise and tells an overjoyed Marie to tell Andre to come at 6:00. Suddenly, O'Shaughnessy comes in panicking. The King of France and other royals have come to view the remains. Chicago, for once is out of ideas, and Dutchy invites the royals in to view the body. The coffin is opened and they are all repulsed by the terrible smell (Dutchy filled the coffin with limburger cheese in case someone wanted to look). As they leave, the friends celebrate as Lefoux comes back and questions Chicago. He sees through the disguise and tells "Lefoux" that he is in love with Cecile. The two embrace and go off into another room where Chicago explains everything. Just before Andre arrives, the Widow takes Dutchy and O'Shaughnessy into another room and tells them the Widow's plan. Alone, Andre reveals he lied to Marie and only wants to marry the widow for her money. Knowing he is in the room, the trio stage a conversation and actions that make it seem as though the Widow has ceramic body parts and false hair. Andre, disgusted, tears up the contract and runs off as the Widow chases him. Dutchy and O'Shaughnessy are left alone with Charlie who reveals that he is actually Inspector Gaston of the Paris Police. He brings everyone except the Widow and Andre into the room where he exposes Millet's remains as bricks and that Lefoux is actually Cecile (there actually is a real Inspector Lefoux who is on vacation). Leroux reveals that instead of the Widow, he will marry either Bathilde or Caron. Gaston is about to send everyone to prison when Millet comes into the room dressed in his normal clothes. He tells Gaston that he was at the Barbary Coast on a break and came back to find his funeral going on. When Gaston tells him his sister stated he was dead, Millet tells him he has no sister. Everyone is overjoyed at Millet's return and Gaston leaves to find "the Widow". Millet and Marie are reunited and will be wed, along with Leroux and one of the ladies and Cecile and Chicago. Chicago reminds Millet that the entire country thinks he is dead, but Millet assured him that France will not admit she was wrong and that now he is a celebrity. Millet proposes a toast to the groups benefactor: the Widow Daisy Tillou.

{{History of Italy}}

'''Italian unification''' ({{lang-it|Unità d'Italia}} {{IPA-it|uniˈta ddiˈtaːlja|}}), or the '''Risorgimento''' ({{IPA-it|risordʒiˈmento|}}, meaning "the Resurgence"), was the political and social movement that consolidated [[List of historic states of Italy|different states]] of the [[Italian peninsula]] into the single state of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in the 19th century. The process began in 1815 with the [[Congress of Vienna]] and was completed in 1871 when [[History of Rome|Rome]] became the capital of  the Kingdom of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Collier|first=Martin|title=Italian unification, 1820–71|year=2003|publisher=Heinemann|location=Oxford|isbn=0-435-32754-2|edition=First|page=2|series=Heinemann Advanced History|quote=The ''Risorgimento'' is the name given to the process that ended with the political unification of Italy in 1871}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Riall|first=Lucy|title=The Italian Risorgimento: state, society, and national unification|year=1994|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-203-41234-6|edition=First|page=1|quote=The functional importance of the Risorgimento to both Italian politics and Italian historiography has made this short period (1815–60) one of the most contested and controversial in modern Italian history}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term, which also designates the cultural, political and social movement that promoted unification, recalls the [[Romanticism|romantic]], [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and [[Patriotism|patriotic]] ideals of an Italian renaissance through the conquest of a unified political identity that, by sinking its ancient roots during the Roman period,  "suffered an abrupt halt [or loss] of its political unity in 476 AD after the collapse of the [[West Roman Empire]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimo L. Salvadori]], ''Enciclopedia dei ragazzi'' Treccani (2005) alla voce "Italia, storia di"&lt;/ref&gt; However, some of the ''[[Italian irredentism|terre irredente]]'' did not join the Kingdom of Italy until 1918 after Italy defeated [[Austria–Hungary]] in [[World War I]]. For this reason, sometimes the period is extended to include the late 19th-century and the [[Italian Front (World War I)|First World War]] (1915–1918), until the 4 November 1918 [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]], which is considered the completion of unification. This view is followed, for example, at the Central Museum of Risorgimento at the [[Vittoriano]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnaldi, Girolamo : ''Italy and Its Invaders.'' Harvard University Press, 2005. Page 194. {{ISBN|0-674-01870-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.risorgimento.it/index.php?section=museo|title=Museo Centrale del Risorgimento di Roma|website=Istituto per la storia del Risorgimento italiano|access-date=6 July 2018|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historians continue to debate many of the key features and personalities of the movement.

==Background==
Italy was unified by [[Rome]] in the third century BC. For 700 years, it was a kind of territorial extension of the capital of the [[Roman Republic]] and [[Roman Empire|Empire]], enjoying, for a long time, a privileged status and so it was not converted into a province.

After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], [[Roman Italy|Italy]] remained united under the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] and later disputed between the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]] and the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire]]. Following conquest by the [[Frankish Empire]], the title of [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|King of Italy]] merged with the office of [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. However, the emperor was an absentee [[German language|German]]-speaking foreigner who had little concern for the governance of Italy as a state; as a result, Italy gradually developed into a system of [[Italian city-states|city-states]]. Southern Italy however was governed by the long-lasting [[Kingdom of Sicily]] or [[Kingdom of Naples]], initially established by the Normans. Central Italy was governed by the Pope as a temporal kingdom known as the [[Papal States]].

This situation persisted through the [[Renaissance]] but began to deteriorate with the rise of modern [[nation-state]]s in the [[early modern period]]. Italy, including the [[Papal States]], then became the site of [[proxy war]]s between the major powers, notably the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (including [[Austria]]), [[Spain]], and [[France]].

Harbingers of national unity appeared in the treaty of the [[Italic League]], in 1454, and the 15th century foreign policy of [[Cosimo De Medici]] and [[Lorenzo De Medici]]. Leading Renaissance Italian writers [[Dante]], [[Petrarch]], [[Boccaccio]], [[Machiavelli]] and [[Guicciardini]] expressed opposition to foreign domination. [[Petrarch]] stated that the "ancient valour in Italian hearts is not yet dead" in ''Italia Mia.'' Machiavelli later quoted four verses from ''Italia Mia'' in ''[[The Prince]]'', which looked forward to a political leader who would unite Italy "to free her from the [[barbarians]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wLY2tlPZqvsC&amp;pg=PA257&amp;dq=petrarch+l'antico+valor#v=onepage&amp;q=petrarch%20l'antico%20valor&amp;f=false |title=Machiavelli and Empire&amp;nbsp;– Mikael Hörnqvist&amp;nbsp;– Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=25 November 2004 |accessdate=1 August 2012|isbn=9781139456340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648 formally ended the rule of the Holy Roman Emperors in Italy. However, the Spanish branch of the [[Habsburg dynasty]], another branch of which provided the Emperors, continued to rule most of Italy down to the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701–14).

A sense of Italian national identity was reflected in [[Gian Rinaldo Carli]]'s ''Della Patria degli Italiani'',&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Trampus, "Gianrinaldo Carli at the centre of the Milanese Enlightenment." ''History of European ideas'' 32#4 (2006): 456-476.&lt;/ref&gt; written in 1764. It told how a stranger entered a café in Milan and puzzled its occupants by saying that he was neither a foreigner nor a Milanese. {{"'}}Then what are you?' they asked. 'I am an Italian,' he explained."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Holt, Edgar|title=The Making of Italy: 1815–1870|publisher=New York: Murray Printing Company|year=1971|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===French Revolution===
The Habsburg rule in Italy came to an end with the campaigns of the French Revolutionaries in 1792–97, when a series of client republics were set up. In 1806, the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved by the last emperor, [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]], after its defeat by Napoleon at the Battle of Austerlitz. The [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars]] destroyed the old structures of feudalism in Italy and introduced modern ideas and efficient legal authority; it provided much of the intellectual force and social capital that fueled unification movements for decades after it collapsed in 1814.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Grew,  "Finding social capital: the French revolution in Italy." ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' 29#3 (1999): 407-433. [http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/002219598551760?journalCode=jinh#.WCROKi0rLhs online]&lt;/ref&gt;  The French Republic spread republican principles, and the institutions of republican governments promoted citizenship over the rule of the Bourbons and Habsburgs and other dynasties.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Maria Rao, " Republicanism in Italy from the eighteenth century to the early Risorgimento," ''Journal of Modern Italian Studies'' (2012) 17#2 pp 149-167.&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction against any outside control challenged Napoleon's choice of rulers. As Napoleon's reign began to fail, the rulers he had installed tried to keep their thrones (among them: [[Eugène de Beauharnais]],  viceroy of Italy and [[Joachim Murat]], [[king of Naples]]) further feeding nationalistic sentiments. Beauharnais tried to get Austrian approval for his succession to the new Kingdom of Italy, and on 30 March 1815, Murat issued the [[Rimini Proclamation]], which called on Italians to revolt against their Austrian occupiers.

===Reaction and dreams 1815&amp;ndash;1848===
After Napoleon fell, the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814–15) restored the pre-Napoleonic patchwork of independent governments. Italy was again controlled largely by the [[Austrian Empire]] and the [[Habsburg]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.napoleon.org/en/reading_room/articles/files/hicks_napoleon_kingitaly.asp |title=How Napoleon became 'King of Italy' |publisher=Napoleon.org |date=23 October 2012 |accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they directly controlled the predominantly Italian-speaking northeastern part of Italy and were, together, the most powerful force against unification.

An important figure of this period was [[Francesco Melzi d'Eril]], serving as vice-president of the [[Napoleon]]ic [[Italian Republic (Napoleonic)|Italian Republic]] (1802–1805) and consistent supporter of the Italian unification ideals that would lead to the Italian ''Risorgimento'' shortly after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicassio|first=Susan Vandiver|title=Imperial City: Rome Under Napoleon|year=2009|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|location=United States of America|edition=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-57973-3|page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Meanwhile, artistic and literary sentiment also turned towards nationalism; [[Vittorio Alfieri]], [[Francesco Lomonaco]] and [[Niccolò Tommaseo]] are generally considered three great literary precursors of Italian nationalism, but the most famous of proto-nationalist works was [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s [[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|''I promessi sposi'' ''(The Betrothed)'']] widely read as a thinly-veiled allegorical critique of Austrian rule. Published in 1827 and extensively revised in the following years the 1840 version of ''I Promessi Sposi'' used a standardized version of the [[Languages of Italy|Tuscan dialect]], a conscious effort by the author to provide a language and force people to learn it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitool.fcla.edu/R/EBBLV18785TVXBTP8VTCSM1AGUFD9JRFEN5LEDSE9H5NAQX8VU-02053?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=3084790&amp;local_base=GEN01&amp;pds_handle=GUEST|title=DigiTool – Results – Full|publisher=Digitool.fcla.edu|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exiles dreamed of unification. Three ideals of unification appeared.  [[Vincenzo Gioberti]], a Piedmontese priest, had suggested a confederation of Italian states under leadership of the Pope in his 1842 book, ''Of the Moral and Civil Primacy of the Italians''.&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Romani, "Liberal theocracy in the Italian risorgimento." ''European History Quarterly'' 44#4 (2014): 620-650.&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Pius IX|Pope Pius IX]] at first appeared interested but he turned reactionary and led the battle against liberalism and nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pio Nono: A Study in European Politics and Religion in the Nineteenth Century|author=E.E.Y. Hales|publisher=P.J. Kenedy|year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giuseppe Mazzini]] and  [[Carlo Cattaneo]] wanted the unification of Italy under a [[federal republic]], which proved too extreme for most nationalists. The middle position was proposed by [[Cesare Balbo]] (1789–1853) as a confederation of separate Italian states led by Piedmont.&lt;ref&gt;Maurizio Isabella, "Aristocratic Liberalism and Risorgimento: Cesare Balbo and Piedmontese Political Thought after 1848." ''History of European Ideas'' 39#6 (2013): 835-857.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Carboneria===
[[File:Italian-unification.gif|thumb|Italian unification]]
One of the most influential revolutionary groups was the [[Carbonari|Carboneria]], a secret political discussion group formed in [[Southern Italy]] early in the 19th century; the members were called ''Carbonari''. After 1815, [[Freemasonry]] in Italy was repressed and discredited due to its French connections.  A void was left that the Carboneria filled with a movement that closely resembled Freemasonry but  with a commitment to Italian nationalism and no association with Napoleon and his government.  The response came from middle class professionals and business men and some intellectuals. The Carboneria disowned Napoleon but nevertheless were inspired by the principles of the [[French Revolution]] regarding liberty, equality and fraternity.  They developed their own rituals,  and were strongly anticlerical. The Carboneria movement spread across Italy.&lt;ref&gt;R. John Rath, "The Carbonari: Their Origins, Initiation Rites, and Aims," ''American Historical Review'' (1964) 69#2 pp. 353-370 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1844987 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative governments feared the Carboneria, imposing stiff penalties on men discovered to be members. Nevertheless, the movement survived and continued to be a source of political turmoil in Italy from 1820 until after unification. The ''Carbonari'' condemned [[Napoleon III]] (who, as a young man, had fought on the side of the Carbonari) to death for [[Napoleon III#Italian Campaign|failing]] to unite Italy, and the group almost succeeded in assassinating him in 1858, when [[Felice Orsini]], [[Giovanni Andrea Pieri]], [[Charles DeRudio|Carlo Di Rudio]] and [[Andrea Gomez (revolutionary)|Andrea Gomez]] launched three bombs at him. Many leaders of the unification movement were at one time or other members of this organization.  The chief purpose was to defeat tyranny and to establish constitutional government. Though contributing some service to the cause of Italian unity, historians such as Cornelia Shiver doubt that their achievements were proportional to their pretensions.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelia Shiver, "The Carbonari." ''Social Science'' (1964): 234-241. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41885047 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Giuseppe Mazzini and Giuseppe Garibaldi===
[[File:Garibaldiecavour.JPG|thumb|Garibaldi and Cavour making Italy in a satirical cartoon of 1861]]

Many leading Carbonari revolutionaries wanted a republic,&lt;ref name="Galt 1994 785–807"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Galt|first=Anthony|title=The Good Cousins' Domain of Belonging: Tropes in Southern Italian Secret Society Symbol and Ritual, 1810–1821|journal=Man, New Series|date=December 1994|volume=29|issue=4|pages=785–807|jstor=3033969}}&lt;/ref&gt; two of the most prominent being [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] and [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]. Mazzini's activity in revolutionary movements caused him to be imprisoned soon after he joined. While in prison, he concluded that Italy could&amp;nbsp;− and therefore should&amp;nbsp;− be unified, and he formulated a program for establishing a free, independent, and republican nation with Rome as its capital. Following his release in 1831, he went to [[Marseille]] in France, where he organized a new political society called [[Young Italy (historical)|''La Giovine Italia'' (Young Italy)]], whose motto was "''Dio e Popolo''" (God and People), which sought the unification of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Denis Mack Smith, ''Mazzini'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

Garibaldi, a native of [[Nice]] (then part of [[Piedmont]]), participated in an uprising in Piedmont in 1834 and was sentenced to death. He escaped to [[South America]], though, spending fourteen years in exile, taking part in several wars, and learning the art of guerrilla warfare before his return to Italy in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Jasper Ridley, ''Garibaldi'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exiles and European and masculine ideals===
Many of the key intellectual and political leaders operated from exile; most Risorgimento patriots lived and published their work abroad after successive failed revolutions. Exile became a central theme of the foundational legacy of the Risorgimento as the narrative of the Italian nation fighting for independence.&lt;ref&gt;Maurizio Isabella, "Exile and Nationalism: The Case of the Risorgimento" ''European History Quarterly" (2006) 36#4 pp 493-520.&lt;/ref&gt;  The exiles were deeply immersed in European ideas, and often hammered away at what Europeans saw as Italian vices, especially effeminacy and indolence. These negative stereotypes emerged from Enlightenment notions of national character that stressed the influence of the environment and history on a people's moral predisposition. Italian exiles both challenged and embraced the stereotypes and typically presented gendered interpretations of Italy's political "degeneration". They called for a masculine response to feminine weaknesses as the basis of a national regeneration, and fashioned their image of the future Italian nation firmly in the standards of European nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Silvana Patriarca, "Indolence and Regeneration: Tropes and Tensions of Risorgimento Patriotism," ''American Historical Review'' (2005) 110#2 pp 380-408. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/531319 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two Sicilies insurrection===
In 1820, Spaniards successfully [[Ferdinand VII of Spain#Revolt|revolted]] over disputes about their Constitution, which influenced the development of a similar movement in Italy. Inspired by the Spaniards (who, in 1812, had created their constitution), a regiment in the army of the [[Two Sicilies|Kingdom of Two Sicilies]], commanded by [[Guglielmo Pepe]], a ''Carbonaro'' (member of the secret republican organization),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Carbonaro |title=Carbonaro – definition of Carbonaro by The Free Dictionary |publisher=The free dictionary.com |date= |accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; mutinied, conquering the peninsular part of Two Sicilies. The king, [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand I]], agreed to enact a new constitution. The revolutionaries, though, failed to court popular support and fell to Austrian troops of the [[Holy Alliance]].  Ferdinand abolished the constitution and began systematically persecuting known revolutionaries. Many supporters of revolution in [[Sicily]], including the scholar [[Michele Amari]], were forced into exile during the decades that followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onwar.com/aced/nation/all/austrohun/ftwosicilies1820.htm|title=Austria Two Sicilies Revolt 1820–1821|publisher=Onwar.com|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Piedmont insurrection===
The leader of the 1821 revolutionary movement in [[Piedmont]] was [[Santorre di Santarosa]], who wanted to remove the Austrians and unify Italy under the [[House of Savoy]]. The Piedmont revolt started in [[Alessandria]], where troops adopted the green, white, and red [[Flag of Italy|''tricolore'']] of the [[Cisalpine Republic]]. The king's regent, prince [[Charles Albert of Sardinia|Charles Albert]], acting while the king [[Charles Felix of Sardinia|Charles Felix]] was away, approved a new [[constitution]] to appease the revolutionaries, but when the king returned he disavowed the constitution and requested assistance from the [[Holy Alliance]]. Di Santarosa's troops were defeated, and the would-be Piedmontese revolutionary fled to [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Broers, "Revolution as Vendetta: Patriotism in Piedmont, 1794–1821." ''Historical Journal'' 33#3 (1990): 573-597.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Milan]], [[Silvio Pellico]] and [[Pietro Maroncelli]] organized several attempts to weaken the hold of the Austrian despotism by indirect educational means. In October 1820, Pellico and Maroncelli were arrested on the charge of carbonarism and imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;Gavriel Shapiro, "Nabokov and Pellico: Invitation to a Beheading and My Prisons." ''Comparative Literature'' 62#1 (2010): 55-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1830 insurrections===
Historian [[Denis Mack Smith]] argues that:
{{quote|Few people in 1830, believed that an Italian nation might exist. There were eight states in the peninsula, each with distinct laws and traditions. No one had had the desire or the resources to revive Napoleon's partial experiment in unification. The settlement of 1814–15, had merely restored regional divisions, with the added disadvantage that the decisive victory of Austria over France temporarily hindered Italians in playing off their former oppressors against each other. ... Italians who, like [[Ugo Foscolo]] and [[Gabriele Rossetti]], harboured patriotic sentiments, were driven into exile. The largest Italian state, the Bourbon Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, with its 8 million inhabitants, seemed aloof and indifferent: Sicily and Naples had once formed part of Spain, and it had always been foreign to the rest of Italy. The common people in each region, and even the intellectual elite, spoke their mutually unintelligible dialects, and lacked the least vestiges of national consciousness. They wanted good government, not self-government, and had welcomed Napoleon and the French as more equitable and efficient than their native dynasties.&lt;ref&gt;D. Mack Smith, "Italy" in J.P.T. Bury, ed., ''The New Cambridge Modern History, Vol. 10: The Zenith of European Power, 1830-70'' (1960) p 552.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Assalto alla casa di Ciro Menotti e arresto del Grande Patriotta e dei suoi compagni.jpg|thumb|Ciro Menotti and his compatriots clashed with the army]]

After 1830, revolutionary sentiment in favor of a unified Italy began to experience a resurgence, and a series of insurrections laid the groundwork for the creation of one nation along the Italian peninsula.

The [[Duchy of Modena|Duke of Modena]], [[Francis IV of Modena|Francis IV]], was an ambitious noble, and he hoped to become king of [[Northern Italy]] by increasing his territory. In 1826, Francis made it clear that he would not act against those who subverted opposition toward the unification of Italy. Encouraged by the declaration, revolutionaries in the region began to organize.

During the [[July Revolution|July Revolution of 1830]] in France, revolutionaries forced the king to abdicate and created the [[July Monarchy]] with encouragement from the new French king, [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]]. Louis-Philippe had promised revolutionaries such as [[Ciro Menotti]] that he would intervene if Austria tried to interfere in Italy with troops. Fearing he would lose his throne, Louis-Philippe did not, however, intervene in Menotti's planned uprising. The Duke of Modena abandoned his ''Carbonari'' supporters, arrested Menotti and other conspirators in 1831, and once again conquered his duchy with help from the Austrian troops. Menotti was executed, and the idea of a revolution centered in Modena faded.

At the same time, other insurrections arose in the [[Papal Legations]] of [[Bologna]], [[Ferrara]], [[Ravenna]], [[Forlì]], [[Ancona]] and [[Perugia]]. These successful revolutions, which adopted the ''tricolore'' in favour of the Papal flag, quickly spread to cover all the Papal Legations, and their newly installed local governments proclaimed the creation of a united Italian nation. The revolts in Modena and the Papal Legations inspired similar activity in the [[Duchy of Parma]], where the ''tricolore'' flag was adopted. The Parmese duchess [[Marie Louise of Austria|Marie Louise]] left the city during the political upheaval.

Insurrected provinces planned to unite as the ''[[Province Italiane unite]]'' (United Italian Provinces), which prompted [[Pope Gregory XVI]] to ask for Austrian help against the rebels. Austrian [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Chancellor Metternich]] warned Louis-Philippe that Austria had no intention of letting Italian matters be, and that French intervention would not be tolerated. Louis-Philippe withheld any military help and even arrested Italian patriots living in France.

In early 1831, the Austrian army began its march across the Italian peninsula, slowly crushing resistance in each province that had revolted.  This military action suppressed much of the fledgling revolutionary movement, and resulted in the arrest of many radical leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Italian_unification_-_Early_revolutionary_activity_1820_to_1830/id/1517955]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202221914/http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Italian_unification_-_Early_revolutionary_activity_1820_to_1830/id/1517955|date=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fratelli Bandiera.jpg|thumb|left|Execution of the [[Bandiera Brothers]]]]

In 1844, two brothers from [[Venice]], [[Bandiera Brothers|Attilio and Emilio Bandiera]], members of the ''[[Giovine Italia]]'', planned to make a raid on the [[Calabria]]n coast against the [[Kingdom of Two Sicilies]] in support of Italian Unification. They assembled a band of about twenty men ready to sacrifice their lives, and set sail on their venture on 12 June 1844.  Four days later they landed near [[Crotone]], intending to go to [[Cosenza]], liberate the political prisoners, and issue their proclamations. Tragically for the Bandiera brothers, they did not find the insurgent band they were told awaited them, so they moved towards [[La Sila]]. They were ultimately betrayed by one of their party, the [[Corsica]]n Pietro Boccheciampe, and by some peasants who believed them to be Turkish pirates. A detachment of [[Gendarmerie|gendarmes]] and volunteers were sent against them, and after a short fight the whole band was taken prisoner and escorted to Cosenza, where a number of [[Calabria]]ns who had taken part in a previous rising were also under arrest. The Bandiera brothers and their nine companions were executed by firing squad; some accounts state they cried "''Viva l’Italia''!" ("Long live Italy!") as they fell. The moral effect was enormous throughout Italy, the action of the authorities was universally condemned, and the martyrdom of the Bandiera brothers bore fruit in the subsequent revolutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1345637/Bandiera-brothers|title=Bandiera brothers|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 January 1848, the revolutionary disturbances began with a civil disobedience strike in [[Lombardy]], as citizens stopped smoking cigars and playing the [[lottery]], which denied Austria the associated tax revenue. Shortly after this, revolts began on the island of [[Sicily]] and in Naples. In Sicily the revolt resulted in the proclamation of the [[Sicilian revolution of 1848|Kingdom of Sicily]] with [[Ruggero Settimo]] as Chairman of the independent state until 1849, when the Bourbon army took back full control of the island on 15 May 1849 by force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohio.edu/chastain/rz/twosicil.htm|title=Two Sicilies, Kingdom of, 1848–49|publisher=Ohio.edu|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1848, there were revolts in [[Tuscany]] that were relatively nonviolent, after which [[Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Grand Duke Leopold II]] granted the Tuscans a constitution. A breakaway republican provisional government formed in Tuscany during February shortly after this concession. On 21 February, [[Pope Pius IX]] granted a constitution to the Papal States, which was both unexpected and surprising considering the historical recalcitrance of the Papacy. On 23 February 1848, King [[Louis Philippe of France]] was forced to flee [[Paris]], and a republic was proclaimed. By the time the revolution in Paris occurred, three states of Italy had constitutions—four if one considers Sicily to be a separate state.

[[File:Battaglia di Goito Bauduc.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Goito]]]]

Meanwhile, in Lombardy, tensions increased until the Milanese and Venetians rose in revolt on 18 March 1848. The insurrection in Milan succeeded in expelling the Austrian garrison after five days of street fights – 18–22 March ([[Five Days of Milan|Cinque giornate di Milano]]). An Austrian army under Marshal [[Josef Radetzky]] besieged Milan, but due to defection of many of his troops and the support of the Milanese for the revolt, they were forced to retreat.

Soon, [[Charles Albert of Sardinia|Charles Albert]], the King of Sardinia (who ruled Piedmont and [[Savoy]]), urged by the Venetians and Milanese to aid their cause, decided this was the moment to unify Italy and declared war on Austria ([[First Italian Independence War]]). After initial successes at [[Battle of Goito|Goito]] and [[Peschiera del Garda|Peschiera]], he was decisively defeated by Radetzky at the [[Battle of Custoza (1848)|Battle of Custoza]] on 24 July. An armistice was agreed to, and Radetzky regained control of all of [[Lombardy-Venetia]] save [[Venice]] itself, where the [[Republic of San Marco]] was proclaimed under [[Daniele Manin]].

While Radetzky consolidated control of Lombardy-Venetia and Charles Albert licked his wounds, matters took a more serious turn in other parts of Italy.  The monarchs who had reluctantly agreed to constitutions in March came into conflict with their constitutional ministers. At first, the republics had the upper hand, forcing the monarchs to flee their capitals, including [[Pope Pius IX]].

[[File:Giuseppe Mazzini.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Giuseppe Mazzini]]]]

Initially, Pius IX had been something of a reformer, but conflicts with the revolutionaries soured him on the idea of constitutional government. In November 1848, following the assassination of his Minister [[Pellegrino Rossi]], Pius IX fled just before [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] and other patriots arrived in Rome. In early 1849, elections were held for a Constituent Assembly, which proclaimed a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] on 9 February. On 2 February 1849, at a political rally held in the Apollo Theater, a young Roman priest, the Abbé [[Carlo Arduini]], had made a speech in which he had declared that the [[Temporal power (papal)|temporal power]] of the popes was a "historical lie, a political imposture, and a religious immorality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jasper|last=Ridley|title=Garibaldi|page=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early March 1849, [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] arrived in Rome and was appointed Chief Minister.

[[File:Daniele Manin Repubblica di Venezia.jpg|thumb|[[Daniele Manin]] and [[Niccolò Tommaseo]] after the proclamation of the Republic of San Marco]]

Before the powers could respond to the founding of the Roman Republic, Charles Albert, whose army had been trained by the exiled Polish general [[Albert Chrzanowski]], renewed the war with Austria. He was quickly defeated by Radetzky at [[Battle of Novara (1849)|Novara]] on 23 March 1849. Charles Albert abdicated in favour of his son, [[Victor Emmanuel II]], and Piedmontese ambitions to unite Italy or conquer Lombardy were, for the moment, brought to an end.  The war ended with a treaty signed on 9 August. A popular revolt broke out in [[Ten Days of Brescia|Brescia]] on the same day as the defeat at Novara, but was suppressed by the Austrians ten days later.

There remained the Roman and [[Republic of San Marco|Venetian]] Republics. In April, a French force under [[Charles Oudinot]] was sent to Rome. Apparently, the French first wished to mediate between the Pope and his subjects, but soon the French were determined to restore the Pope. After a two-month siege, Rome capitulated on 29 June 1849 and the Pope was restored. Garibaldi and Mazzini once again fled into exile—in 1850 Garibaldi went to [[New York City]]. Meanwhile, the Austrians besieged Venice, which was defended by a volunteer army led by [[Daniele Manin]] and [[Guglielmo Pepe]], who were forced to surrender on 24 August. Pro-independence fighters were [[Belfiore martyrs|hanged en masse in Belfiore]], while the Austrians moved to restore order in central Italy, restoring the princes who had been expelled and establishing their control over the [[Papal Legations]]. The revolutions were thus completely crushed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohio.edu/chastain/ip/manin.htm|title=Daniele Manin|publisher=Ohio.edu|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cavour and the prospects for unification===
Morale was of course badly weakened, but the dream of Risorgimento did not die. Instead, the Italian patriots learned some lessons that made them much more effective at the next opportunity in 1860.  Military weakness was glaring, as the small Italian states were completely outmatched by France and Austria. France was a potential ally, and the patriots realized they had to focus all their attention on expelling Austria first, with a willingness to give the French whatever they wanted in return for essential military intervention. The French in fact received Savoy and Nice in 1860. Secondly, the patriots realized that the Pope was an enemy, and could never be the leader of a united Italy.  Third they realized that republicanism was too weak a force. Unification had to be based on a strong monarchy, and in practice that meant reliance on Piedmont (the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]) under [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|King Victor Emmanuel II]] (1820–1878) of the [[House of Savoy]].  [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour|Count Cavour]] (1810–1861) provided critical leadership. He was a modernizer interested in agrarian improvements, banks, railways and free trade. He opened a newspaper as soon as censorship allowed it: ''Il Risorgimento'' called for the independence of Italy, a league of Italian princes, and moderate reforms. He had the ear of the king and in 1852 became prime minister. He ran an efficient active government, promoting rapid economic modernization while upgrading the administration of the army and the financial and legal systems. He sought out support from patriots across Italy. In 1855, the kingdom became an ally of Britain and France in the [[Crimean war]], which gave Cavour's diplomacy legitimacy in the eyes of the great powers.&lt;ref&gt;Enrico Dal Lago, "Lincoln, Cavour, and National Unification: American Republicanism and Italian Liberal Nationalism in Comparative Perspective."

==Towards the Kingdom of Italy==
=== The "Pisacane" fiasco===
In 1857, [[Carlo Pisacane]], an aristocrat from Naples who had embraced Mazzini's ideas, decided to provoke a rising in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. His small force landed on the island of [[Ponza]]. It overpowered guards and liberated hundreds of prisoners.  In sharp contrast to his hypothetical expectations, there was no local uprising and the invaders were quickly overpowered.  Pisacane was killed by angry locals who suspected he was leading a gypsy band trying to steal their food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Collier|title=Italian Unification, 1820-71|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YG9kZBJdKJwC&amp;pg=PA51|year=2003|publisher=Heinemann|page=51|isbn=9780435327545}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2nd War of Italian Independence began in April 1859 when the Sardinian Prime Minister Count Cavour found an ally in Napoleon III. Napoleon III signed a secret alliance and Cavour provoked Austria with military maneuvers and eventually created the war in April 1859. Cavour called for volunteers to enlist in the Italian liberation. The Austrians planned to use their army to beat the Sardinians before the French could come to their aid. Austria had an army of 140,000 men, while the Sardinians had a mere 70,000 men by comparison. However the Austrians' numerical strength was outweighed by an ineffectual leadership appointed by the Emperor on the basis of noble lineage, rather than military competency. Their army was slow to enter the capital of Sardinia, taking almost ten days to travel the {{convert|80|km}}. By this time, the French had reinforced the Sardinians, so the Austrians retreated. 
Napoleon III's plans worked and at the [[Battle of Solferino]], France defeated Austria and forced negotiations. The settlement, by which Lombardy was annexed to Sardinia, left Austria in control of Venice. 
Sardinia eventually won the Second War of Italian Unification due to statesmanship instead of armies or popular election. The final arrangement was ironed out by "back-room" deals instead of in the battlefield. This was because neither France, Austria, nor Sardinia wanted to risk another battle and could not handle further fighting. All of the sides were eventually unhappy with the final outcome of the 2nd War of Italian Unification and expected another conflict in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Avery|first1=Robert|title=The Victorian Web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/risorgimento/3.html|accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''Mille'' expedition===
{{Main article|Expedition of the Thousand}}
[[File:Giuseppe Garibaldi (1866).jpg|thumb|[[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]]]

Thus, by early 1860, only five states remained in Italy—the Austrians in Venetia, the [[Papal States]] (now minus the Legations), the new expanded Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, and San Marino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barbagallo|first=Francesco|title=Mezzogiorno e questione meridionale|year=1980|publisher=Guida|location=Napoli|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seaman|first=L.

[[Francis II of the Two Sicilies]], the son and successor of  [[Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand II]] (the infamous "King Bomba"), had a well-organized army of 150,000 men. But his father's tyranny had inspired many secret societies, and the kingdom's [[Swiss mercenaries]] were unexpectedly recalled home under the terms of a new Swiss law that forbade Swiss citizens to serve as mercenaries. This left Francis with only his mostly-unreliable native troops. It was a critical opportunity for the unification movement. In April 1860, separate insurrections began in [[Messina, Italy|Messina]] and [[Palermo]] in Sicily, both of which had demonstrated a history of opposing Neapolitan rule.  These rebellions were easily suppressed by loyal troops.

In the meantime, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], a native of Nice, was deeply resentful of the French annexation of his home city. He hoped to use his supporters to regain the territory.  Cavour, terrified of Garibaldi provoking a war with France, persuaded Garibaldi to instead use his forces in the Sicilian rebellions. On 6 May 1860, Garibaldi and his cadre of about a thousand Italian volunteers (called ''[[I Mille]]''), steamed from [[Quarto dei Mille|Quarto]] near [[Genoa]], and, after a stop in [[Talamone]] on 11 May, landed near [[Marsala]] on the west coast of [[Sicily]].

Near [[Salemi]], Garibaldi's army attracted scattered bands of rebels, and the combined forces defeated the opposing army at [[Calatafimi]] on 13 May. Within three days, the invading force had swelled to 4,000 men. On 14 May Garibaldi proclaimed himself dictator of Sicily, in the name of Victor Emmanuel. After waging various successful but hard-fought battles, Garibaldi advanced upon the Sicilian capital of [[Palermo]], announcing his arrival by beacon-fires kindled at night. On 27 May the force laid siege to the Porta Termini of Palermo, while a mass uprising of street and barricade fighting broke out within the city.

[[File:Battle of Calatafimi.jpg|thumb|left|[[Battle of Calatafimi]]]]

With Palermo deemed insurgent, Neapolitan general Ferdinando Lanza, arriving in Sicily with some 25,000 troops, furiously bombarded Palermo nearly to ruins. With the intervention of a [[United Kingdom|British]] admiral, an armistice was declared, leading to the Neapolitan troops' departure and surrender of the town to Garibaldi and his much smaller army. In Palermo was created the [[Dictatorship of Garibaldi]].

This resounding success demonstrated the weakness of the Neapolitan government. Garibaldi's fame spread and many Italians began to consider him a national hero. Doubt, confusion, and dismay overtook the Neapolitan court—the king hastily summoned his ministry and offered to restore an earlier constitution, but these efforts failed to rebuild the peoples' trust in [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] governance.

Six weeks after the surrender of Palermo, Garibaldi attacked Messina. Within a week, its citadel surrendered. Having conquered Sicily, Garibaldi proceeded to the mainland, crossing the [[Strait of Messina]] with the Neapolitan fleet at hand. The garrison at [[Reggio Calabria]] promptly surrendered. As he marched northward, the populace everywhere hailed him, and military resistance faded: on 18 and 21 August, the people of [[Basilicata]] and [[Apulia]], two regions of the Kingdom of Naples, independently declared their annexation to the Kingdom of Italy. At the end of August, Garibaldi was at [[Cosenza]], and, on 5 September, at [[Eboli]], near [[Salerno]]. Meanwhile, [[Naples]] had declared a state of siege, and on 6 September the king gathered the 4,000 troops still faithful to him and retreated over the [[Volturno]] river. The next day, Garibaldi, with a few followers, entered by train into Naples, where the people openly welcomed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/spedizione-dei-mille/|title=Spedizione Dei Mille nell’Enciclopedia Treccani|work=Treccani, l'Enciclopedia italiana|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defeat of the Kingdom of Naples===
[[File:Napoli Castel Nuovo museo civico - ingresso di Garibaldi a Napoli - Wenzel bis.jpg|thumb|People cheering as Garibaldi enters Naples]]

Though Garibaldi had easily taken the capital, the Neapolitan army had not joined the rebellion ''en masse'', holding firm along the [[Volturno River]]. Garibaldi's irregular bands of about 25,000 men could not drive away the king or take the fortresses of [[Capua]] and [[Gaeta]] without the help of the Sardinian army. The Sardinian army, however, could only arrive by traversing the Papal States, which extended across the entire center of the peninsula.  Ignoring the political will of the [[Holy See]], Garibaldi announced his intent to proclaim a "Kingdom of Italy" from [[Rome]], the capital city of [[Pope Pius IX]].  Seeing this as a threat to the domain of the Catholic Church, Pius threatened [[excommunication]] for those who supported such an effort.  Afraid that Garibaldi would attack Rome, Catholics worldwide sent money and volunteers for the Papal Army, which was commanded by General [[Christophe Léon Louis Juchault de Lamoricière|Louis Lamoricière]], a French exile.

[[File:Museo Torre di San Martino della Battaglia - affresco 03.jpg|thumb|left|[[Battle of Volturnus (1860)|Battle of Volturno]]]]
The settling of the peninsular standoff now rested with Napoleon III. If he let Garibaldi have his way, Garibaldi would likely end the temporal sovereignty of the Pope and make Rome the capital of Italy. Napoleon, however, may have arranged with Cavour to let the king of Sardinia free to take possession of Naples, [[Umbria]] and the other provinces, provided that Rome and the "Patrimony of [[St. Peter]]" were left intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://novaonline.nvcc.edu/eli/evans/his102/notes/garibaldi.html|title=Garibaldi and the Risorgimento|author=Charles T. Evans|publisher=Novaonline.nvcc.edu|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in this situation that a Sardinian force of two army corps, under Fanti and Cialdini, marched to the frontier of the Papal States, its objective being not Rome but Naples. The Papal troops under Lamoricière advanced against Cialdini, but were quickly defeated and besieged in the fortress of [[Ancona]], finally surrendering on 29 September.  On 9 October, Victor Emmanuel arrived and took command. There was no longer a papal army to oppose him, and the march southward proceeded unopposed.

[[File:With Victor Emmanuel.jpg|thumb|[[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel]] meets Garibaldi near [[Teano]]]]
Garibaldi distrusted the pragmatic Cavour since Cavour was the man ultimately responsible for orchestrating the French annexation of the city of Nice, which was his birthplace.  Nevertheless, he accepted the command of Victor Emmanuel. When the king entered [[Sessa Aurunca]] at the head of his army, Garibaldi willingly handed over his dictatorial power. After greeting Victor Emmanuel in [[Teano]] with the title of [[King of Italy]], Garibaldi entered Naples riding beside the king.  Garibaldi then retired to the island of [[Caprera]], while the remaining work of unifying the peninsula was left to Victor Emmanuel.

The progress of the Sardinian army compelled Francis II to give up his line along the river, and he eventually took refuge with his best troops in the fortress of Gaeta.  His courage boosted by his resolute young wife, Queen [[Marie Sophie of Bavaria |Marie Sophie]], Francis mounted a stubborn defence that lasted three months.  But European allies refused to provide him with aid, and food and munitions became scarce, and disease set in, so the garrison was forced to surrender.  Nonetheless, ragtag groups of Neapolitans loyal to Francis fought on against the Italian government for years to come.

The fall of Gaeta brought the unification movement to the brink of fruition—only Rome and [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]] remained to be added. On 18 February 1861, Victor Emmanuel assembled the deputies of the first Italian Parliament in Turin. On 17 March 1861, the Parliament proclaimed Victor Emmanuel King of Italy, and on 27 March 1861 Rome was declared Capital of Italy, even though it was not yet in the new Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/regno-delle-due-sicilie/ |title=Regno Delle Due Sicilie nell’Enciclopedia Treccani |publisher=Treccani.it |date= |accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three months later Cavour died, having seen his life's work nearly completed. When he was given the last rites, Cavour purportedly said: "Italy is made. All is safe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Holt, Edgar|title=The Making of Italy: 1815–1870|publisher=New York: Murray Printing Company|year=1971|page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Question===
{{main article|Roman Question}}
[[File:Proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy.jpg|thumb|Proclamation of the [[Kingdom of Italy]]]]

Mazzini was discontent with the perpetuation of monarchical government and continued to agitate for a republic. With the motto "Free from the [[Alps]] to the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]]", the unification movement set its gaze on Rome and Venice. There were obstacles, however. A challenge against the Pope's temporal dominion was viewed with profound distrust by Catholics around the world, and there were French troops stationed in Rome. Victor Emmanuel was wary of the international repercussions of attacking the Papal States, and discouraged his subjects from participating in revolutionary ventures with such intentions.&lt;ref&gt;Mack Smith, ''Italy: a modern history'' (1969) pp 89-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, Garibaldi believed that the government would support him if he attacked Rome. Frustrated at inaction by the king, and bristling over perceived snubs, he came out of retirement to organize a new venture. In June 1862, he sailed from Genoa and landed again at Palermo, where he gathered volunteers for the campaign, under the slogan ''o Roma o Morte'' ("either Rome or Death"). The garrison of Messina, loyal to the king's instructions, barred their passage to the mainland. Garibaldi's force, now numbering two thousand, turned south and set sail from [[Catania]]. Garibaldi declared that he would enter Rome as a victor or perish beneath its walls. He landed at [[Melito di Porto Salvo|Melito]] on 14 August and marched at once into the [[Calabria]]n mountains.

[[File:The Injured Garibaldi in the Aspromonte Mountains (oil on canvas).jpg|thumb|left|''The Injured Garibaldi in the [[Aspromonte|Aspromonte Mountains]]'' (oil on canvas), credited to [[Gerolamo Induno]]]]

Far from supporting this endeavour, the Italian government was quite disapproving.  General Cialdini dispatched a division of the regular army, under Colonel Pallavicino, against the volunteer bands. On 28 August the two forces met in the [[Aspromonte]].  One of the regulars fired a chance shot, and several volleys followed, but Garibaldi forbade his men to return fire on fellow subjects of the Kingdom of Italy. The volunteers suffered several casualties, and Garibaldi himself was wounded; many were taken prisoner.  Garibaldi was taken by steamer to [[Varignano, La Spezia|Varignano]], where he was honorably imprisoned for a time, but finally released.&lt;ref&gt;Mack Smith, ''Italy: a modern history'' (1969) pp 63-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Victor Emmanuel sought a safer means to the acquisition of the remaining Papal territory. He negotiated with the Emperor Napoleon for the removal of the French troops from Rome through a treaty. They agreed to the [[September Convention]] in September 1864, by which Napoleon agreed to withdraw the troops within two years. The Pope was to expand his own army during that time so as to be self-sufficient.  In December 1866, the last of the French troops departed from Rome, in spite of the efforts of the pope to retain them.  By their withdrawal, Italy (excluding Venetia and Savoy) was freed from the presence of foreign soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;John W. Bush, ''Venetia Redeemed; Franco-Italian Relations, 1864-1866'' (Syracuse University Press, 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

The seat of government was moved in 1865 from [[Turin]], the old Sardinian capital, to [[Florence]], where the first Italian parliament was summoned.  This arrangement created such disturbances in Turin that the king was forced to leave that city hastily for his new capital.&lt;ref&gt;Mack Smith, ''Italy: a modern history'' (1969) pp 65-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:San Martino della Battaglia - Fresco 1866 Custoza 1.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Custoza (1866)|Battle of Custoza]]]]

In the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866, [[Austria]] contested with [[Prussia]] the position of leadership among the German states.  The Kingdom of Italy seized the opportunity to capture [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]] from Austrian rule and allied itself with Prussia.&lt;ref&gt;Denis Mack Smith, ''Italy: a modern history'' (1969) pp 76-82.&lt;/ref&gt;  Austria tried to persuade the Italian government to accept Venetia in exchange for non-intervention. However, on 8 April, Italy and Prussia signed an agreement that supported Italy's acquisition of Venetia, and on 20 June Italy issued a declaration of war on Austria. Within the context of Italian unification, the Austro-Prussian war is called ''Third Independence War'', after the ''First'' (1848) and the ''Second'' (1859).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.welcometorome.net/en/about-rome/history/italian-risorgimento|title=Italian Risorgimento|publisher=Welcometorome.net|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victor Emmanuel hastened to lead an army across the [[Mincio]] to the invasion of Venetia, while Garibaldi was to invade the [[German Tyrol|Tyrol]] with his [[Hunters of the Alps]].  The enterprise ended in disaster.  The Italian army encountered the Austrians at [[Battle of Custoza (1866)|Custoza]] on 24 June and suffered a defeat.  On 20 July the [[Regia Marina]] was defeated in the [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|battle of Lissa]].  Italy's fortunes were not all so dismal, though.  The following day, Garibaldi's volunteers defeated an Austrian force in the [[Battle of Bezzecca]], and moved toward [[Trento]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://militaryhistory.about.com/od/navalbattles1800s/p/lissa.htm|title=Battle of Lissa – Third Italian War Battle of Lissa|author=Kennedy Hickman|work=About|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, [[Minister President of Prussia|Prussian Minister President]] [[Otto von Bismarck]] saw that his own ends in the war had been achieved, and signed an armistice with Austria on 27 July.  Italy officially laid down its arms on 12 August.  Garibaldi was recalled from his successful march and resigned with a brief telegram reading only "''Obbedisco''" ("I obey").

[[File:Einzug Vittorio Emanuels in Venedig 1.jpg|thumb|[[Victor Emmanuel II]] in Venice]]
In spite of Italy's poor showing, Prussia's success on the northern front obliged Austria to cede Venetia.  Under the terms of a peace treaty signed in [[Vienna]] on 12 October, Emperor [[Franz Joseph]] had already agreed to cede Venetia to Napoleon III in exchange for non-intervention in the Austro-Prussian War, and thus Napoleon ceded Venetia to Italy on 19 October, in exchange for the earlier Italian acquiescence to the French annexation of [[Savoy]] and [[Nice]].

In the peace treaty of Vienna, it was written that the annexation of Venetia would have become effective only after a referendum—taken on 21 and 22 October—to let the [[Venice|Venetian]] people express their will about being annexed or not to the Kingdom of Italy. Historians suggest that the referendum in Venetia was held under military pressure,&lt;ref&gt;G. Thaon di Revel: "La cessione del Veneto—ricordi di un commissario piemontese incaricato alle trattative" (translation: "The cession of Veneto—memories of the piedmontese commissary for the negotiations"). Academic Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; as a mere 0.01% of voters (69 out of more than 642,000 ballots) voted against the annexation.&lt;ref&gt;Beggiato, E.: "1866: la grande truffa" (translation: "1866: the great deceit"). Venice Academic Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; However it should be admitted that the re-establishment of a Republic of Venice orphan of Istria and Dalmatia had little chances to develop.

Austrian forces put up some opposition to the invading Italians, to little effect.  Victor Emmanuel entered Venice and Venetian land, and performed an act of homage in the [[Piazza San Marco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/risorgimento/4.html|title=The Austro-Prussian War and Third War of Italian Unification (1866)|publisher=Victorianweb.org|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rome==
===Mentana and Villa Glori===
[[File:Garibaldi at Mentana, 3rd November 1867.jpg|thumb|Garibaldi at [[Mentana]], 3 November 1867]]

The national party, with Garibaldi at its head, still aimed at the possession of Rome, as the historic capital of the peninsula.  In 1867 Garibaldi made a second attempt to capture Rome, but the papal army, strengthened with a new French auxiliary force, defeated his poorly armed volunteers at Mentana.  Subsequently, a French garrison remained in Civitavecchia until August 1870, when it was recalled following the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]].

Before the defeat at Mentana, Enrico Cairoli, his brother Giovanni, and 70 companions had made a daring attempt to take Rome. The group had embarked in Terni and floated down the Tiber. Their arrival in Rome was to coincide with an uprising inside the city. On 22 October 1867, the revolutionaries inside Rome seized control of the Capitoline Hill and of Piazza Colonna. Unfortunately for the Cairolis and their companions, by the time they arrived at Villa Glori, on the northern outskirts of Rome, the uprising had already been suppressed. During the night of 22 October 1867, the group was surrounded by [[Papal Zouaves]], and Giovanni was severely wounded. Enrico was mortally wounded and bled to death in Giovanni's arms.

With the Cairoli dead, command was assumed by Giovanni Tabacchi who had retreated with the remaining volunteers into the villa, where they continued to fire at the papal soldiers. These also retreated in the evening to Rome. The survivors retreated to the positions of those led by Garibaldi on the Italian border.

===Memorial===
At the summit of Villa Glori, near the spot where Enrico died, there is a plain white column dedicated to the Cairoli brothers and their 70 companions. About 100 meters to the left from the top of the Spanish Steps, there is a bronze monument of Giovanni holding the dying Enrico in his arm. A plaque lists the names of their companions. Giovanni never recovered from his wounds and from the tragic events of 1867. According to an eyewitness,&lt;ref&gt;Michele Rosi, ''I Cairoli'', L. Capelli Ed., Bologna, 1929, pp. 223–224&lt;/ref&gt; when Giovanni died on 11 September 1869:
{{quote|text=In the last moments, he had a vision of Garibaldi and seemed to greet him with enthusiasm. I heard (so says a friend who was present) him say three times: "The union of the French to the papal political supporters was the terrible fact!" he was thinking about Mentana. Many times he called Enrico, that he might help him! then he said: "but we will certainly win; we will go to Rome!"}}

===Capture of Rome===
{{main article|Capture of Rome}}
[[File:Porta Pia Pagliari Vizzotto.JPG|thumb|[[Capture of Rome]]]]

In July 1870, the [[Franco-Prussian War]] began. In early August, the French Emperor [[Napoleon III]] recalled his garrison from Rome, thus no longer providing protection to the Papal State. Widespread public demonstrations illustrated the demand that the Italian government take Rome. The Italian government took no direct action until the collapse of the [[Second French Empire]] at the [[Battle of Sedan]]. King Victor Emmanuel II sent Count [[Gustavo Ponza di San Martino]] to [[Pius IX]] with a personal letter offering a face-saving proposal that would have allowed the peaceful entry of the Italian Army into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope.  The Papacy, however, exhibited something less than enthusiasm for the plan:

{{quote|text=The Pope's reception of San Martino (10 September 1870) was unfriendly. Pius IX allowed violent outbursts to escape him. Throwing the King's letter upon the table he exclaimed, "Fine loyalty! You are all a set of vipers, of whited sepulchres, and wanting in faith."  He was perhaps alluding to other letters received from the King. After, growing calmer, he exclaimed: "I am no prophet, nor son of a prophet, but I tell you, you will never enter Rome!" San Martino was so mortified that he left the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=De Cesare, Raffaele|title=The Last Days of Papal Rome|publisher= Archibald Constable &amp; Co|year=1909|page=444}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the papal frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that a peaceful entry could be negotiated.  The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege.  Although now convinced of his unavoidable defeat, Pius IX remained intransigent to the bitter end and forced his troops to put up a token resistance.  On 20 September, after a cannonade of three hours had breached the [[Aurelian Walls]] at [[Porta Pia]], the [[Bersaglieri]] entered Rome and marched down ''Via Pia'', which was subsequently renamed ''Via XX Settembre''.  Forty-nine Italian soldiers and four officers, and nineteen papal troops died.  [[Rome]] and [[Latium]] were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a plebiscite held on 2 October. The results of this plebiscite were accepted by decree of 9 October.

[[File:RomaPalazzoQuirinale.JPG|thumb|The [[Quirinal Palace]] in [[Rome]] became the [[List of heads of state of Italy|head of state of Italy's]] official residence (royal residence of the [[Kings of Italy]] and after the [[Italian constitutional referendum, 1946]] residence and workplace for the [[President of Italy|Presidents of the Italian Republic]])]]
Initially the Italian government had offered to let the pope keep the [[Leonine City]], but the Pope rejected the offer because acceptance would have been an implied endorsement of the legitimacy of the Italian kingdom's rule over his former domain.  Pius IX declared himself a [[prisoner in the Vatican]], although he was not actually restrained from coming and going.  Rather, being deposed and stripped of much of his former power also removed a measure of personal protection — if he had walked the streets of Rome he might have been in danger from political opponents who had formerly kept their views private.  Officially, the capital was not moved from Florence to Rome until July 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.150anni-lanostrastoria.it/index.php/presa-di-roma|title=La breccia di Porta Pia|publisher=150anni-lanostrastoria.it|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Raffaele de Cesare made the following observations about Italian unification:
{{quote|text= The Roman question was the stone tied to Napoleon's feet — that dragged him into the abyss. He never forgot, even in August 1870, a month before Sedan, that he was a sovereign of a Catholic country, that he had been made Emperor, and was supported by the votes of the Conservatives and the influence of the clergy; and that it was his supreme duty not to abandon the [[Pontiff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=De Cesare, Raffaele|title=The Last Days of Papal Rome|publisher= Archibald Constable &amp; Co|year=1909|page=440}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|text=For twenty years Napoleon III had been the true sovereign of Rome, where he had many friends and relations…. Without him the temporal power would never have been reconstituted, nor, being reconstituted, would have endured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=De Cesare, Raffaele|title=The Last Days of Papal Rome|publisher= Archibald Constable &amp; Co|year=1909|page=443}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Problems==
Unification was achieved entirely in terms of Piedmont's interests. Martin Clark says, "It was Piedmontization all around."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Clark, ''The Italian Risorgimento'' (2nd ed. 2009) p 86&lt;/ref&gt; Cavour died unexpectedly in June 1861, at 50, and most of the many promises that he made to regional authorities to induce them to join the newly unified Italian kingdom were ignored. The new Kingdom of Italy was structured by renaming the old Kingdom of Sardinia and annexing all the new provinces into its structures. The first king was Victor Emmanuel II, who kept his old title.

National and regional officials were all appointed by Piedmont. A few regional leaders succeeded to high positions in the new national government, but the top bureaucratic and military officials were mostly Piedmontese. The national capital was briefly moved to Florence and finally to Rome, one of the cases of Piedmont losing out.

However, Piedmontese tax rates and regulations, diplomats and officials were imposed on all of Italy. The new constitution was Piedmont's old constitution. The document was generally liberal and was welcomed by liberal elements. However, its anticlerical provisions were resented in the pro-clerical regions in places such as around Venice, Rome, and Naples – as well as the island of Sicily. Cavour had promised there would be regional and municipal, local governments, but all the promises were broken in 1861.

The first decade of the kingdom saw savage civil wars in Sicily and in the Naples region. Hearder claimed that failed efforts to protest unification involved "a mixture of spontaneous peasant movement and a Bourbon-clerical reaction directed by the old authorities".&lt;ref&gt;Harry Hearder, ''Italy in the Age of the Risorgimento 1790 - 1870'' (1980) p 240&lt;/ref&gt;

The pope lost Rome in 1870 and ordered the Catholic Church not to co-operate with the new government, a decision fully reversed only in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David I. Kertzer|title=Prisoner of the Vatican: The Popes, the Kings, and Garibaldi's Rebels in the Struggle to Rule Modern Italy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8SESoaxxbJcC&amp;pg=PA59|year=2006|pages=59–72|isbn=0618619194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most people for Risorgimento had wanted strong provinces, but they got a strong central state instead. The inevitable long-run results were a severe weakness of national unity and a politicized system based on mutually-hostile regional violence. Such factors remain in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''The Italian Risorgimento'' (2nd ed. 2009) pp 86-92&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ruling and representing southern Italy ===
From the spring of 1860 to the summer of 1861, a major challenge that the Piedmontese parliament faced on national unification was how they should govern and control the southern regions of the country that were frequently represented and described by northern Italian correspondents as "corrupt", "barbaric", and "uncivilized".&lt;ref&gt;Nelson Moe, {{"'}}This is not Italy!': Ruling and Representing the South, 1860–1861", in ''The View from the Vesuvius: Italian Culture and the Southern Question'', 156–183 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2002), 165. 
&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the depictions of southern Italy, the Piedmontese parliament had to decide whether it should investigate the southern regions to better understand the social and political situations there or it should establish jurisdiction and order by using mostly force.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson Moe, {{"'}}This is not Italy!': Ruling and Representing the South, 1860-1861", in ''The View from the Vesuvius: Italian Culture and the Southern Question'', 156–183 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2002), 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dominance of letters sent from the Northern Italian correspondents that deemed Southern Italy to be "so far from the ideas of progress and civilization" ultimately induced the Piedmontese parliament to choose the latter course of action, which effectively illustrated the intimate connection between representation and rule.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Nelson Moe, {{"'}}This is not Italy!': Ruling and Representing the South, 1860-1861", in ''The View from the Vesuvius: Italian Culture and the Southern Question'', 156–183 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2002), 166.&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, the Northern Italians' "representation of the south as a land of barbarism (variously qualified as indecent, lacking in 'public conscience', ignorant, superstitious, etc.)" provided the Piedmontese with the justification to rule the southern regions on the pretext of implementing a superior, more civilized, "Piedmontese morality".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the background, Garibaldi plows his farm.]]

Italian unification is still a topic of debate. According to [[Massimo d'Azeglio]], centuries of foreign domination created remarkable differences in Italian society, and the role of the newly formed government was to face these differences and to create a unified Italian society. Still today the most famous quote of Massimo d'Azeglio is, "L'Italia è fatta. Restano da fare gli italiani" (''Italy has been made. Now it remains to make Italians'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/massimo-d-azeglio/ |title=Massimo D Azeglio nell’Enciclopedia Treccani |publisher=Treccani.it |date= |accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economist and politician [[Francesco Saverio Nitti]] criticized the newly created state for not considering the substantial economic differences between Northern Italy, a [[Free market|free market economy]], and Southern Italy, a state [[protectionism]] economy, when integrating the two. When the Kingdom of Italy extended the free market economy to the rest of the country, the South's economy collapsed under the weight of the North's. Nitti contended that this change should have been much more gradual in order to allow the birth of an adequate entrepreneurial class able to make strong investments and initiatives in the south. These mistakes, he felt, were the cause of the economic and social problems which came to be known as the Southern Question (Questione Meridionale).&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Saverio Nitti, L'Italia all'alba del secolo XX, Casa Editrice Nazionale Roux e Viarengo, Torino-Roma, 1901&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Saverio Nitti, Domenico De Masi, Napoli e la questione meridionale, Guida, Napoli, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Francesco Hayez 048.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Massimo d'Azeglio]]]]
The politician, historian, and writer [[Gaetano Salvemini]] commented that even though Italian Unification had been a strong opportunity for both a moral and economic rebirth of Italy's Mezzogiorno ([[Southern Italy]]), due to lack of understanding and action on the part of politicians, corruption and organized crime flourished in the South.&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Riall, "Which road to the south? Revisionists revisit the Mezzogiorno." ''Journal of Modern Italian Studies'' 5#1 (2000): 89-100.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Marxist theorist [[Antonio Gramsci]] criticized Italian Unification for the limited presence of the masses in politics, as well as the lack of modern [[land reform]] in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Cammett, "Two recent polemics on the character of the Italian Risorgimento." ''Science &amp; Society'' 27#4 (1963): 433-457. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40400981 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Revisionism of Risorgimento]] produced a clear radicalization of Italy in the mid-twentieth century, following the fall of the Savoy monarchy and fascism during World War II. Reviews of the historical facts concerning Italian unification's successes and failures continue to be undertaken by domestic and foreign academic authors, including [[Denis Mack Smith]], [[Christopher Duggan (historian)|Christopher Duggan]], and [[Lucy Riall]].  Recent work emphasizes the central importance of nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Silvana Patriarca and Lucy Riall, eds. |title=The Risorgimento Revisited: Nationalism and Culture in Nineteenth-Century Italy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B5NoA_2uAKkC&amp;pg=PA1|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|pages=1–3|isbn=9780230248007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eugenio F.

Historians have often written about the roles played by Mazzini, Cavour, and Garibaldi.  Representative debates include:&lt;ref&gt; Charles F. Delzell, ed., ''The Unification of Italy, 1859-1861 : Cavour, Mazzini or Garibaldi?'' (1965) [https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/10610153?q=text%3A%22European+problem+studies.%22&amp;c=book&amp;sort=holdings+desc&amp;_=1532860379752&amp;versionId=12375765 online]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unification, by design or force of circumstances?
* Mazzinianism in the 1850s, hinderance or help to unification?
* Cavour and Garibaldi, collaborators or rivals?
* Cavour's use of plebiscites, desirable or regrettable? 
* Why the failure of Cavour's 'Free church in a free state'?

==Risorgimento and irredentism==
It can be said that Italian unification was never truly completed in the nineteenth century. Many Italians remained outside the borders of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] and this situation created the Italian [[irredentism]].

''[[Italia irredenta]]'' (unredeemed Italy) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Nationalism|nationalist]] opinion movement that emerged after Italian unification. It advocated irredentism among the Italian people as well as other nationalities who were willing to become Italian and as a movement; it is also known as "Italian irredentism". Not a formal organization, it was just an opinion movement that claimed that Italy had to reach its "natural borders," meaning that the country would need to incorporate all areas predominantly consisting of ethnic Italians within the near vicinity outside its borders. Similar patriotic and nationalistic ideas were common in Europe in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.branchcollective.org/?ps_articles=alison-chapman-on-il-risorgimento|title=Alison Chapman, "On Il Risorgimento"|author=Felluga|publisher=Branchcollective.org|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irredentism and the World Wars===
[[File:Vittoriano Altare della Patria 2013-09-16.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Vittoriano]]'' in Rome, honoring King Victor Emmanuel and celebrating the unity of Italy. The decision to build it was reached in 1878, shortly after the king's death that year; the site on the Capitoline Hill was chosen in 1882; and the design of 28-year-old Giuseppe Sacconi was selected in 1884. Construction began in 1885 and the monument was inaugurated in 1911, although features were subsequently added or altered during the fascist period.]]

During the post-unification era, some Italians were dissatisfied with the current state of the Italian Kingdom since they wanted the kingdom to include Trieste, Istria, and other adjacent territories as well. This Italian irredentism succeeded in [[World War I]] with the annexation of [[Trieste]] and [[Trento]], with the respective territories of [[Venezia Giulia]] and [[Trentino]].

The Kingdom of Italy had declared neutrality at the beginning of the war, officially because the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] with Germany and Austria-Hungary was a defensive one, requiring its members to come under attack first. Many Italians were still hostile to Austria's continuing occupation of ethnically Italian areas, and Italy chose not to enter. Austria-Hungary requested Italian neutrality, while the [[Triple Entente]] (which included Great Britain, France and Russia) requested its intervention. With the [[London Pact]], signed in April 1915, Italy agreed to declare war against the [[Central Powers]] in exchange for the ''irredent'' territories of Friuli, Trentino, and [[Dalmatia]] (see ''[[Italia irredenta]]'').

Italian irredentism obtained an important result after the [[World War I|First World War]], when Italy gained [[Trieste]], [[Gorizia]], [[Istria]], and the city of [[Zadar|Zara]]. During the Second World War, after the Axis attack on [[Yugoslavia]], Italy created the "Governatorato di Dalmazia" (from 1941 to September 1943), so the Kingdom of Italy annexed temporarily even [[Split, Croatia|Split]] (Italian ''Spalato''), [[Kotor]] (''Cattaro''), and most of coastal [[Dalmatia]]. From 1942 to 1943, even [[Corsica]] and [[Nice]] (Italian ''Nizza'') were temporarily annexed to the Kingdom of Italy, nearly fulfilling in those years the ambitions of Italian irredentism.

For its avowed purpose, the movement had the "emancipation" of all Italian lands still subject to foreign rule after ''Italian unification''. The Irredentists took language as the test of the alleged Italian nationality of the countries they proposed to emancipate, which were [[Trentino]], [[Trieste]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Istria]], [[Gorizia]], [[Ticino]], [[Nice]] (Nizza), [[Corsica]], and [[Malta]]. [[Austria-Hungary]] promoted [[Croats|Croatian]] interests in Dalmatia and Istria to weaken Italian claims in the western [[Balkans]] before the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/irredentismo_(Enciclopedia-Italiana) |title=Irredentismo in "Enciclopedia Italiana" – Treccani |publisher=Treccani.it |date= |accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After World War II===
After WWII, the irredentism movement faded away in Italian politics. Only a few thousand Italians remain in [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]] as a consequence of the Italian defeat in WWII and the slaughter of thousands of Italians as reprisals for fascist atrocities, and the subsequent departure of approximately 400,000 people in what became known as the [[Istrian exodus]]. Roughly 350,000 refugees were ethnic Italians (76% of whom born in the territories surrendered), the others being ethnic Slovenians, ethnic Croatians, and ethnic [[Istro-Romanians]], choosing to maintain Italian citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Benedetta Tobagi |url=http://www.treccani.it/scuola/lezioni/storia/la_repubblica_italiana.html |title=La Repubblica italiana &amp;#124; Treccani, il portale del sapere |publisher=Treccani.it |date= |accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture and Risorgimento==
===Art===
[[File:S. croce, tomba vittorio alfieri.JPG|thumb|Mourning [[Italia turrita]] on the tomb to Vittorio Alfieri by [[Antonio Canova]]]]
[[File:Francesco Hayez 008.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Kiss (Hayez)|The Kiss]]'' (1859) by [[Francesco Hayez]]]]

In art, this period was characterised by the [[Neoclassicism]] that draws inspiration from the "classical" art and culture of [[Ancient Greece]] or [[Ancient Rome]]. The main Italian sculptor was [[Antonio Canova]] who became famous for his [[marble sculpture]]s that delicately rendered [[nudity|nude]] flesh. The mourning [[Italia turrita]] on the tomb to [[Vittorio Alfieri]] is one of the main works of Risorgimento by Canova.

[[Francesco Hayez]] was another remarkable artist of this period whose works often contain allegories about Italian unification. His most known painting ''[[The Kiss (Hayez)|The Kiss]]'' aims to portray the spirit of the [[Risorgimento]]: the man wears red, white and green, representing the Italian patriots fighting for independence from the [[Austro-Hungarian empire]] while the girl's pale blue dress signifies France, which in 1859 (the year of the painting's creation) made an alliance with the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Kingdom of Piedmont and Sardinia]] enabling the latter to unify the many states of the Italian peninsula into the new kingdom of [[Italy]]. Hayez's three paintings on the ''[[Sicilian Vespers]]'' are an implicit protest against the foreign domination of [[Italy]].

[[Andrea Appiani]], [[Domenico Induno]], and [[Gerolamo Induno]] are also known for their patriotic canvases. Risorgimento was also represented by works not necessarily linked to Neoclassicism---as in the case of [[Giovanni Fattori]] who was one of the leaders of the group known as the [[Macchiaioli]] and who soon became a leading Italian [[En plein air|plein-airist]], painting landscapes, rural scenes, and military life during the Italian unification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cronologia.leonardo.it/storia/a1848c.htm|title=Risorgimento – Pensiero e cultura  – 1848|publisher=Cronlogia.leonardo.it|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
[[File:Francesco Hayez 040.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Alessandro Manzoni (1841) by [[Francesco Hayez]]]]

In literature, lots of works were dedicated to Risorgimento since the beginning. The most known writer of Risorgimento is [[Alessandro Manzoni]] whose works are a symbol of the Italian unification, both for its patriotic message and because of his efforts in the development of the modern, unified [[Italian language]]; he is famous for the novel ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]'' (orig. Italian: ''I Promessi Sposi'') (1827), generally ranked among the masterpieces of [[world literature]].

[[Vittorio Alfieri]], was the founder of a new school in the Italian drama, expressed in several occasions his suffering about the foreign domination's tyranny.

[[Ugo Foscolo]] describes in his works the passion and love for the fatherland and the glorious history of the [[Italian people]]; these two concepts are respectively well expressed in two masterpieces, ''[[The Last Letters of Jacopo Ortis]]'' and ''[[Dei Sepolcri]]''.

[[Vincenzo Monti]], known for the [[Italian language|Italian]] translation of the ''[[Iliad]]'', described in his works both enthusiasms and disappointments of Risorgimento until his death.

[[Giovanni Berchet]] wrote a poetry characterized by a high moral, popular and social content; he also contributed to ''[[Il Conciliatore]]'', a progressive bi-weekly scientific and literary journal, influential in the early [[Risorgimento]] that was published in [[Milan]] from September 1818 until October 1819 when it was closed by the Austrian censors; its writers included also [[Ludovico di Breme]], [[Giuseppe Nicolini (writer)|Giuseppe Nicolini]], and [[Silvio Pellico]].

[[Giacomo Leopardi]] was one of the most important poets of Risorgimento thanks to works such as ''[[Giacomo Leopardi#First Canti|Canzone all'Italia]]'' and ''[[Giacomo Leopardi#Risorgimento|Risorgimento]]''.

[[Niccolò Tommaseo]], the editor of the ''Italian Language Dictionary'' in eight volumes, was a precursor of the [[Italian irredentism]] and his works are a rare examples of a metropolitan culture above nationalism; he supported the liberal revolution headed by [[Daniele Manin]] against the [[Austrian Empire]] and he will always support the unification of Italy.

[[Francesco de Sanctis]] was one of the most important scholars of Italian language and literature in the 19th century; he supported the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states|Revolution of 1848]] in [[Naples]] and for this reason he was imprisoned for three years; his reputation as a lecturer on [[Dante]] in [[Turin]] brought him the appointment of professor at [[ETH Zürich]] in 1856; he returned to [[Naples]] as Minister of Public Education after the unification of Italy.

The writer and patriot [[Luigi Settembrini]] published anonymously the ''Protest of the People of the Two Sicilies'', a scathing indictment of the Bourbon government and was imprisoned and exiled several times by the Bourbons because of his support to Risorgimento; after the formation of the Kingdom of Italy, he was appointed professor of [[Italian literature]] at the [[University of Naples]].

[[Ippolito Nievo]] is another main representant of Risorgimento with his novel ''[[Ippolito Nievo|Confessioni d'un italiano]]''; he fought with [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]'s [[Expedition of the Thousand]].

Risorgimento was also depicted in famous novels:
''[[The Leopard]]'' written by [[Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa]], ''[[Heart (novel)|Heart]]'' by [[Edmondo De Amicis]], and ''[[Piccolo mondo antico]]'' by [[Antonio Fogazzaro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giorgioweiss.it/node/120|title=Risorgimento e poesia – Giorgio Weiss|publisher=Giorgioweiss.it|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Risorgimento won the support of many leading Italian opera composers.&lt;ref&gt;Axel Körner, "Opera and nation in nineteenth‐century Italy: conceptual and methodological approaches." ''Journal of Modern Italian Studies'' 17#4 (2012): 393-399.&lt;/ref&gt;  Their librettos often saw a delicate balance between European romantic narratives and dramatic themes evoking nationalistic sentiments. Ideas expressed in operas stimulated the political mobilisation in Italy and among the cultured classes of Europe who appreciated Italian opera. Furthermore, Mazzini and many other nationalists found inspiration in musical discourses.&lt;ref&gt;Carlotta Sorba,  "Between cosmopolitanism and nationhood: Italian opera in the early nineteenth century." ''Modern Italy'' 19.1 (2014): 53-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[L'italiana in Algeri]] (The Italian Girl in Algiers)'', [[Gioachino Rossini]] expressed his support to the unification of Italy; the patriotic line ''Pensa alla patria, e intrepido il tuo dover adempi: vedi per tutta Italia rinascere gli esempi d’ardir e di valor'' / "Think about the fatherland and intrepid do your duty: see for all Italy the birth of the examples of courage and value" was censored in the [[Kingdom of Two Sicilies]].

[[Vincenzo Bellini]] was a secret member of the Carbonari and in his masterpiece ''[[I puritani]] (The Puritans)'', the last part of Act 2 is an allegory to Italian unification. Another Bellini opera,   ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'', was at the center of an unexpected standing ovation during its performance in [[Milan]] in 1859: while the [[choir|chorus]] was performing  ''Guerra, guerra! Le galliche selve (War, war! The Gallic forests)'' in Act 2, the Italians began to greet the chorus with loud applause and to yell the word "War!" several times towards the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian officers]] at the [[opera house]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sivainitalia.it/italia/regno.php?page=4|title=Dal Risorgimento all'Italia unita|publisher=Sivainitalia.it|accessdate=30 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924102212/http://www.sivainitalia.it/italia/regno.php?page=4|archive-date=24 September 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between [[Gaetano Donizetti]] and the Risorgimento is still controversial. Even though [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] tried to use some of Donizetti's works for promoting the Italian cause, Donizetti had always preferred not to get involved in politics.&lt;ref&gt;Rosa Maria Mazzola, [http://www.piranesi150.altervista.org/pagina-65879.html "Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti and the Risorgimento"] Piranesi150.altervista.org, Retrieved 9 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Viva VERDI grafitti.jpeg|thumb|left|Patriots scrawling "Viva VERDI" on walls]]
Historians vigorously debate how political were the operas of [[Giuseppe Verdi]] (1813-1901).  In particular, the chorus of the Hebrew slaves (known as "[[Va, pensiero]]") from the third act of the opera ''[[Nabucco]]'' was intended to be an anthem for Italian patriots, who were seeking to unify their country and free it from foreign control in the years up to 1861 (the chorus's theme of exiles singing about their homeland, and its lines like ''O mia patria, si bella e perduta'' / "O my country, so lovely and so lost" was thought to have resonated with many Italians).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/NATMUSIC.html |title=Modern History Sourcebook: Music and Nationalism |publisher=Fordham.edu |accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in Naples in 1859 and spreading throughout Italy, the slogan "Viva VERDI" was used as an acronym for '''''Viva V'''ittorio '''E'''manuele '''R'''e '''''D'''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''I'''talia ([[Vive, Viva|Viva]] Victor Emmanuel King of Italy), referring to [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]].&lt;ref&gt;Parker 1998, p. 942&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Budden 1973, Vol. 3, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

Franco Della Peruta  argues in favour of close links between the operas and the Risorgimento, emphasizing Verdi's patriotic intent and links to the values of the Risorgimento. Verdi started as a republican, became a strong supporter of Cavour and entered the Italian parliament on Cavour's suggestion. His politics caused him to be frequently in trouble with the Austrian censors. Verdi's main works of 1842-49 were especially relevant to the struggle for independence, including ''Nabucco'' (1842), ''[[I Lombardi alla prima crociata]]'' (1843), ''[[Ernani]]'' (1844), ''[[Attila (opera)|Attila]]'' (1846), ''[[Macbeth (opera)|Macbeth]]'' (1847), and ''[[La battaglia di Legnano]]'' (1848). However, starting in the 1850s, his operas showed few patriotic themes because of the heavy censorship of the absolutist regimes in power. 
[[File:Final scene from the opera Risorgimento!.jpg|thumb|The final scene of the opera ''Risorgimento!'' (2011) by [[Lorenzo Ferrero]]]]
Verdi later became disillusioned by politics, but he was personally active part in the political  world of events of the Risorgimento and was elected to the first Italian parliament in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Franco DellaPeruta, "Verdi e il Risorgimento," ''Rassegna Storica del Risorgimento'' (2001) 88#1 pp 3-24&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise Marco Pizzo argues that after 1815 music became a political tool, and many songwriters expressed ideals of freedom and equality. Pizzo says Verdi was part of this movement, for his operas were inspired by the love of country, the struggle for Italian independence, and speak to the sacrifice of patriots and exiles.&lt;ref&gt;Marco Pizzo, "Verdi, Musica e Risorgimento," ''Rassegna Storica del Risorgimento'' (2001) 87 supplement 4 pp 37-44&lt;/ref&gt;   On the other side of the debate, Mary Ann Smart argues that music critics at the time seldom mentioned any political themes.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Ann Smart, "How political were Verdi's operas? Metaphors of progress in the reception of I Lombardi alla prima crociata," ''Journal of Modern Italian Studies'' (2013) 18#2 PP 190-204.&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise Roger Parker argues that the political dimension of Verdi's operas was exaggerated by nationalistic historians looking for a hero in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Parker, "Verdi politico: a wounded cliché regroups." ''Journal of Modern Italian Studies'' 17#4 (2012): 427-436.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Giuseppe Verdi's ''Nabucco'' and the Risorgimento are the subject of a 2011 opera, ''[[Risorgimento! (opera)|Risorgimento!]]''  by Italian composer [[Lorenzo Ferrero]], written to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Italian unification.

As a result, amnesties were issued to the survivors and the camp's remaining population evacuated early in 1961.&lt;ref name=wen2009/&gt; In October 1961, the government ordered the closure of Jiabiangou as well as a cover-up.&lt;ref name=french2009/&gt; Authorities in Gansu&lt;ref name=rpi&gt;[http://www.pri.org/theworld/?q=node/14433 N.N.

Partially fictionalized accounts of firsthand recollections from 13 survivors of the camp have been presented in the book ''Woman from Shanghai: Tales of Survival From a Chinese Labor Camp'' by [[Yang Xianhui]]&lt;ref name=randomhouse&gt;[http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780307377685 Xianhui Yang (2009): Woman from Shanghai, published by Pantheon, a division of Random House, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt; (originally published as "Farewell to Jiabiangou", {{zh|c={{linktext|告|别|夹|边|沟}}|p={{linktext|Gào|bié| Jiā|biān|gōu}}}}, translated into English by Wen Huang with support from a 2007 [[PEN Translation Fund Grants|PEN Translation Fund Grant]].

Remains of the camp, including the graveyards, are unmaintained and heavily guarded to prevent people from visiting. In November 2013, a new monument dictated by families and social workers was quickly destroyed by local authorities. [[Ai Xiaoming]], a professor of [[Sun Yat-sen University]], was briefly detained before released and prevented from photographing in May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cn.rfi.fr/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD/20140519-%E8%89%BE%E6%99%93%E6%98%8E%EF%BC%9A%E5%A4%B9%E8%BE%B9%E6%B2%9F%E9%81%97%E5%9D%80%E9%81%AD%E7%A0%B4%E5%9D%8F%E4%BB%A4%E4%BA%BA%E7%97%9B%E5%BF%83 艾晓明：夹边沟遗址遭破坏令人痛心]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joel David Rifkin''' (born January 20, 1959) is an American [[serial killer]]. In 1994, he was sentenced to 203 years in prison for the murders of nine women between 1989 and 1993. He is believed to have killed up to 17 victims&lt;ref name=people&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20106909,00.html|title=The Quiet Man |last= Eftimiades |first= Maria |date= 1993-12-06 |work= [[People (magazine)|People]] |accessdate=2009-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; between 1989 and 1993 in New York City and in [[Long Island]], New York. Although he often hired sex workers in [[Brooklyn]] and [[Manhattan]], he lived in [[East Meadow]], a suburban hamlet on Long Island.

He is also suspected to be responsible for some victims whose remains were found in March and April 2011, previously attributed to the [[Long Island serial killer|Gilgo Beach Killer]]. In an April 2011 prison interview with ''[[Newsday]]'', Rifkin denied having anything to do with the remains discovered in 2011. Experts and victims' rights advocates, however, believe that those denials have no value.&lt;ref name=JoelRifkin&gt;{{cite news |title=Rifkin: 'I have nothing to do with' victims |first1=Jeremiah|last1=Papineau| first2=Victor Manuel| last2=Ramos|work=[[Newsday]] |url=http://www.newsday.com/news/breaking/rifkin-i-have-nothing-to-do-with-victims-1.2819302 |date=2011-05-15|accessdate=2011-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Rifkin's birth mother was a 20-year-old college [[student]], and his biological father was a 24-year-old college student and army veteran. At three weeks old he was adopted by an upper-middle class Long Island couple, on February 14, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.zinester.com/56505/63063.html |title=The Drifter, Joel Rifkin |accessdate=2007-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051216082934/http://archives.zinester.com/56505/63063.html |archivedate=2005-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; His adoptive father, Benjamin Rifkin, was of [[Russian Jew]]ish descent and his adoptive mother, Jeanne (Granelles), of [[Spanish people|Spanish]] descent,
[[Conversion to Judaism|converted]] to [[Judaism]] when she married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c0AF0ycM6gIC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=%22when+Jeanne+was+thirty-six+and+Ben+was+forty%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RCKfzE4hSS&amp;sig=bwuuhIlfE-XkuBJLR5n74iMz2jk&amp;hl=en |title=From the Mouth of the Monster: The Joel Rifkin Story - Robert Mladinich - Google Books |via=[[Google Books]]|date= |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rifkin performed poorly in school due to [[learning disabilities]] and was unpopular with classmates due to his poor [[social skills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Serial Killer Files: The Who, What, Where, How, and Why of the World's Most Terrifying Murderers|year=2003|publisher=Ballantine Books|last=Schechter|first=Harold|page=163|isbn=0-345-46566-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[East Meadow High School]] in 1977, then attended [[Nassau Community College]], [[State University of New York, Brockport]] and [[State University of New York, Farmingdale]], but left before earning a degree. After leaving college, he became self-employed as a landscaper.&lt;ref name="badseed"&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Jeanie| last=Russell Kasindorf |title=The Bad Seed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yyYAAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;ots=519ptBQKCI&amp;dq=August%209%2C%201993%20new%20york%20magazine&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|work=[[New York Magazine]]|date=1993-08-09|volume=26|issue=31|pages=42–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Murders ==
Rifkin committed his first murder in 1989, killing Heidi Balch in his home in [[East Meadow]]. He then [[dismember]]ed her body, removing her teeth and fingertips, putting her head in a paint can and then leaving the paint can in the woods of a golf course in southern New Jersey and her legs farther north, then dumping her remaining torso and arms into the [[East River]] around New York City. Balch's remains were unidentified until 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Heidi Balch Identified: Severed Head Found On Golf Course Was Serial Killer Joel Rifkin’s First Victim|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/27/heidi-balch-head-golf-course-joel-rifkin_n_2965531.html|accessdate=2018-05-30|work=[[Huffington Post]]|date=2013-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next four years, it is presumed he killed 16 more [[women]].&lt;ref name="people"/&gt; After his final arrest in 1993, he was implicated in the murder of a woman whose severed head was discovered on a Hopewell, New Jersey, golf course on March 5, 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/.../accused-serial-killer-on-li-called-a-suspect-in-1989-slaying-of-a-woman.html ]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[Detective|investigators]] determined this [[wikt:victim|victim]], a sex worker named Heidi Balch, was the same woman he described as his first victim.&lt;ref name="newsday130327"&gt;{{cite news | title =Joel Rifkin's first victim ID'd from severed head, was Heidi Balch, cops say | work = [[Newsday]] | date = 2013-03-27 | url =http://www.newsday.com/news/region-state/joel-rifkin-s-first-victim-id-d-from-severed-head-was-heidi-balch-cops-say-1.4923587 | accessdate = 2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police finally caught up to Rifkin on June 28, 1993, when [[New York State Police]] spotted him driving his [[Mazda]] [[pickup truck]] without a rear [[license plate]] on the [[Southern State Parkway]]. A [[high-speed chase]] ended in [[Mineola, New York]], when he crashed into a utility pole directly in front of the courthouse where he eventually stood trial. Troopers detected a foul [[odor]] from the back of the truck. It came from the [[corpse]] of his final victim:&lt;ref name="Bresciani1"&gt;{{citenews|last=Smith|first=Andrew| url=https://www.newsday.com/long-island/joel-rifkin-serial-killer-anniversary-1.19459882 | title=25 years after Joel Rifkin's arrest, key players look back at the case|work=[[Newsday]]|date=2018-06-27| accessdate=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[sex worker]] and dancer Tiffany Bresciani, 22, the [[girlfriend]] of [[Dave Rubinstein]] (a.k.a. Dave Insurgent, a member of the 1980s [[punk rock]] band [[Reagan Youth]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pandora.com/music/artist/reagan+youth |title=Reagan Youth - Pandora Internet Radio |publisher=Pandora.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rifkin had picked Bresciani up in his pickup truck on June 24, 1993, where she was working on [[Allen Street (Manhattan)|Allen Street]] in Manhattan, New York City.&lt;ref name="Bresciani1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="badseed" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simmonds, Jeremy. [https://books.google.com/books?id=bMBf3TYZigQC&amp;pg=PA301 "Dave Insurgent"]. ''The Encyclopedia of Dead Rock Stars: Heroin, Handguns, and Ham Sandwiches'', p. 301, Chicago Review Press, 2008, accessed 2011-08-21 {{ISBN|1-55652-754-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his [[trial]], Rifkin was represented by [[Mineola, New York]]-based [[Lawyer|attorney]] John Lawrence. He was [[found guilty]] of nine counts of [[second-degree murder]] in 1994, and [[Sentence (law)|sentenced]] to 203 years to [[life in prison]]. His first possible [[parole]] date is February 26, 2197.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', Long Island Serial Killer Gets a Personality Profile, by Manny Fernandez and Al Baker, 22 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prison life ==
In early 1994, it was reported that Rifkin had engaged in a jailhouse scuffle with [[mass murder]]er [[Colin Ferguson (mass murderer)|Colin Ferguson]]. The brawl began when Ferguson asked Rifkin to be quiet while Ferguson was using a prison phone. The ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' reported the fight escalated after Ferguson told Rifkin, "I killed six devils and you only killed women," to which Rifkin responded, "Yeah, but I had more victims." Ferguson then punched Rifkin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Shepherd |first=Chuck |title=News of the Weird |date=1994-05-19 |work=[[Chicago Reader]] |location=[[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/news-of-the-weird/Content?oid=884572 |accessdate=2009-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Do not wikilink News of the Weird, it is the title of the article referenced, not the Wikipedia article of the same name. --&gt;

Prison officials decided in 1996 that Rifkin was so notorious, that his presence in the general prison population could be disruptive. He was confined to his cell at the [[Attica Correctional Facility]] for 23 hours a day. He spent more than four years in [[solitary confinement]] before being transferred to the [[Clinton Correctional Facility]] in [[Clinton County, New York|Clinton County]].&lt;ref name="Bio"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Joel Rifkin |year=2012 |work=[[Biography.com]] |url=http://www.biography.com/people/joel-rifkin-11930477 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rifkin sued, arguing that his solitary imprisonment was unconstitutional. In 2000, a state appellate court determined that prison officials had not violated Rifkin's [[constitutional rights]] by housing him in isolation. His lawsuit sought $50,000 for each of his 1,540 days in solitary confinement (totaling $77 million). Had he received any money, it would have been subject to state laws that [[Earmark (finance)|earmark]] most of the award for the families of his victims. Corrections officials say that Rifkin is now imprisoned with more than 200 other inmates at Clinton who are not allowed into the general prison population.&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt;

[[File:Thrill Ville.jpg|thumb|Uniquely Kentucky. Uniquely Fun.]]
The '''Kentucky State Fair''' is the official [[state fair]] of [[Kentucky]] which takes place at the [[Kentucky Exposition Center]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]]. More than 600,000 fairgoers fill the {{convert|520|acre|km2}} of indoor and outdoor exhibits; activities include sampling a wide variety of food and riding several roller coasters during the 11-day event. The Kentucky State Fair includes competitions in crafts such as [[quilt|quilt-making]], [[homebrewing|homebrew]] beers, and home-made [[pastries]], as well as [[fine arts]] and [[agriculture|agricultural]] competitions. Exhibitor spaces are available and are popular with area and regional businesses.

The Kentucky State Fair boasts {{convert|1200000|sqft|m2}} of indoor space that often feature exhibits that include health screenings, gravity-defying acrobats, magical illusionists, balloon sculptors and home improvement demonstrations.

The [[Kentucky State Fair World's Championship Horse Show]] is one of the fair's most prestigious events, where attendees and horses travel from various continents. More than 2,000 elite saddlebreds compete in the World's Championship Horse Show for more than 1.2 million in premiums and awards.

The fair was organized in 1816, just five years after the [[United States]]' first fair in [[Massachusetts]]. [[Fayette County, Kentucky|Fayette County]] farmer Colonel Lewis Sanders (no known relation to [[Colonel Sanders|Colonel Harlan Sanders]] of [[KFC|Kentucky Fried Chicken]] fame) was the organizer. The event did not become an official state fair until 1902. The fair moved from city to city until 1907, when Louisville became the fair's permanent home. [[Churchill Downs]] has hosted the fair on three separate occasions, particularly during [[World War II]]. The fair moved to its current site at the Kentucky Exposition Center in 1956.

Thornley was also known for his 1962 manuscript, ''The Idle Warriors'', which was based on the activities of his acquaintance, [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], prior to the 1963 [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref name="Milwaukee Journal Sentinel; December 5, 1998"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Kerry Thornley; Oswald friend |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=A6UaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Jy8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6595%2C5991845 |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin |date=December 5, 1998 |access-date=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thornley was highly active in the [[Counterculture|countercultural]] publishing scene, writing for a number of underground magazines and newspapers, and self-publishing many one-page (or ''broadsheet'') newsletters of his own. One such newsletter called ''Zenarchy'' was published in the 1960s under the pen name '''Ho Chi Zen'''.&lt;ref name="groover"/&gt; '''Zenarchy'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is described in the introduction of the collected volume as "the social order which springs from meditation", and "A noncombative, nonparticipatory, no-politics approach to [[Anarchism|anarchy]] intended to get the serious student thinking."

Raised [[Mormon]], in adulthood Kerry shifted his ideological focus frequently, in rivalry with any serious [[Counterculture|countercultural]] figure of the 1960s. Among the subjects he closely scrutinized throughout his life were [[atheism]], [[anarchism]], [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], [[autarchism]] (he attended [[Robert LeFevre]]'s [[Freedom School]]), [[Neopaganism|neo-paganism]], [[Kerista]],&lt;ref name="kerista"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kerrythornley.com/kerista/index.html|title=Kerista|accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhism]], and the [[meme]]tic inheritor of [[Discordianism]], the [[Church of the SubGenius]].

==Personal life==
Kerry Wendell Thornley was born on April 17, 1938 in [[Los Angeles]] to Kenneth and Helen Thornley. He had two younger brothers, Dick and Tom.&lt;ref name="family"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kerrythornley.com/bio/family.html|title=Kerry Thornley's Family|accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Saturday,  December 11, 1965, Kerry married Cara Leach at [[Wayfarers Chapel]] in [[Palos Verdes]], [[California]]. They had one son, [[Kreg Thornley]], born in 1969. They later divorced. Kreg was a photographer, painter, musician and film maker.&lt;ref name="family"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kreg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kregthornley.com|title=Kreg Thornley|accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military life==
Having already been a [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] reservist for about two years, Thornley had been summoned to active duty in 1958 at age 20, soon after completing his freshman year at the [[University of Southern California]].&lt;ref name="warren_p84"&gt;''Warren Commission Hearings'', Volume XI, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Principia Discordia'', it was around this time that he and Greg Hill—alias [[Malaclypse the Younger]] or Mal-2—shared their first [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]]tic vision in a [[bowling]] alley in their hometown of [[Whittier, California]].

In early 1959, Thornley served for a short time in the same [[radar]] operator unit as [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] at [[Marine Corps Air Station El Toro|MCAS El Toro]] in [[Santa Ana, California]].&lt;ref name="warren_p84"/&gt; Both men had shared a common interest in [[society]], [[culture]], [[literature]] and [[politics]], and whenever duty placed them together, had discussed such topics as [[George Orwell]]'s famous novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and the [[philosophy]] of [[Marxism]], particularly Oswald's interest in the latter.&lt;ref name="warren_p87-90"&gt;''Warren Commission Hearings'', Volume XI, pp. 87–90&lt;/ref&gt;

While aboard a troopship returning to the United States from duty in Japan (some time after the two men parted ways as a result of routine reassignment), Thornley read of Oswald's autumn 1959 [[defection]] to the Soviet Union in the US military newspaper ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]''.&lt;ref name="warren_p109"&gt;''Warren Commission Hearings'', Volume XI, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

==1960s==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:PrincipiaDiscordia pg00069.png|thumb|200px|left|''Epistle to the Paranoids'']] --&gt;
In February 1962, Thornley completed ''[[The Idle Warriors]],''&lt;ref name="warren_p96"&gt;''Warren Commission Hearings'', Volume XI, pp. 96–97; 109; 112–115&lt;/ref&gt; which has the historical distinction of being the only book written about Lee Harvey Oswald ''before'' [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]]'s assassination in 1963.&lt;ref name="groover"/&gt; Due to the serendipitous nature of Thornley's choice of literary subject matter, he was called to testify before the [[Warren Commission]] in Washington, D.C. on May 18, 1964.&lt;ref name="groover"/&gt;&lt;ref name="warren_p96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="apobit"&gt;{{Cite news | title=Deaths: Kerry Thornley | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-19423817.html | publisher=AP Online | agency=[[Associated Press]] | date=December 4, 1998 | accessdate=September 11, 2012|via=[[HighBeam]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission [[subpoena]]ed a copy of the manuscript and stored it in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]], and the book remained unpublished until 1991.&lt;ref name="apobit" /&gt; In 1965, Thornley published another book titled ''[[Oswald (book)|Oswald]]'', generally defending the "[[Lone gunman theory|Oswald-as-lone-assassin]]" conclusion of the [[Warren Commission]].

In January 1968, New Orleans district attorney [[Jim Garrison]], certain there had been a New Orleans-based conspiracy to assassinate John F. Kennedy, subpoenaed Thornley to appear before a grand jury, questioning him about his relationship with Oswald and his knowledge of other figures Garrison believed to be connected to the assassination.&lt;ref name="groover"/&gt;&lt;ref name="apobit" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; Garrison charged Thornley with [[perjury]] after Thornley denied that he had been in contact with Oswald in any manner since 1959. The perjury charge was eventually dropped by Garrison's successor [[Harry Connick Sr.]]

Thornley claimed that, during his initial two-year sojourn in [[New Orleans]], he had numerous meetings with two mysterious middle-aged men named "Gary Kirstein" and "Slim Brooks". According to his account, they had detailed discussions on numerous subjects ranging from the mundane to the exotic, and bordering sometimes on bizarre. Among these was the subject of how one might assassinate President Kennedy, whose beliefs and policies the aspiring novelist deeply disliked at the time. Later, the former Marine came to believe that "Gary Kirstein" had in reality been senior CIA officer and future [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] burglar [[E. Howard Hunt]], and "Slim Brooks" to have been Jerry Milton Brooks, a member of the 1960s right-wing activist group "[[Minutemen (anti-Communist organization)|The Minutemen]]". [[Guy Banister]], another Minutemen member in New Orleans, had been accused by Garrison of involvement in the assassination and was allegedly connected to [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] through the [[Fair Play for Cuba Committee]] leaflet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol10/html/HSCA_Vol10_0066b.htm 544 Camp Street and Related Events], House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, Volume 10, 13, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marrs, Jim. Crossfire: The Plot that Killed Kennedy, (New York: Carroll &amp; Graf, 1989), p. 497. {{ISBN|0-88184-648-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thornley also claimed that "Kirstein" and Brooks had accurately predicted [[Richard M. Nixon]]'s accession to the presidency six years before it happened, as well as anticipating the rise of the [[1960s counterculture]] and the subsequent emergence of [[Charles Manson]] and what became his [[cult]] following. This led Thornley to believe that the US government had somehow been involved, directly or indirectly, in creating and/or supporting these events, personages and phenomena.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

After [[Trial of Clay Shaw|Shaw was acquitted]], Thornley said he wanted Garrison to bring him to trial in order to clear his name.&lt;ref&gt;http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/Weisberg%20Subject%20Index%20Files/T%20Disk/Thornley%20Kerry/Item%2021.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and death==
For the next 30 years, Thornley traveled and lived all over the United States and was involved in a variety of activities, ranging from editing underground newspapers to attending [[graduate school]]. He spent most of the remainder of his life in the [[Little Five Points]] neighborhood of [[Atlanta]].&lt;ref name="groover"/&gt; During this time he maintained a free series of fliers titled "Out of Order." This single page, double sided Xeroxed periodical was distributed in the Little Five Points area.
In 1994, he and Malaclypse the Younger were inducted into the Order of the Pineapple.&lt;ref name="pineapple_thornley"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://op.loveshade.org/members.html|title=Order of the Pineapple: Honored Members|accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thornley became increasingly paranoid and distrustful in the wake of his experiences during the 1960s, both by his own accounts and those of personal acquaintances. For a time, Thornley wrote a regular column in the [[zine]] ''[[Factsheet Five]]'', until editor [[Mike Gunderloy]] stopped publishing the magazine. Struggling with illness in his final days, Kerry Thornley died of [[cardiac arrest]] in Atlanta on November 28, 1998, at the age of 60.&lt;ref name="groover"/&gt; The following morning, 23 people attended a Buddhist memorial service in his honor. His body had been cremated and the ashes scattered over the Pacific Ocean. Shortly before his death, Thornley reportedly said he'd felt "like a tired child home from a very wild circus", a reference to a passage by [[Gregory Hill (writer)|Greg Hill]] from ''Principia Discordia:''

{{quote|And so it is that we, as men, do not exist until we do; and then it is that we play with our world of existent things, and order and disorder them, and so it shall be that Non-existence shall take us back from Existence, and that nameless Spirituality shall return to Void, like a tired child home from a very wild circus.}}

'''''Kursk''''' is a [[play (theatre)|play]] by the British [[playwright]] [[Bryony Lavery]]. It is inspired by the [[Kursk submarine disaster|2000 sinking]] of the [[Russia]]n [[submarine]] [[Russian submarine K-141 Kursk|K-141 ''Kursk'']] and set on a British submarine on a covert mission in the [[Barents Sea]].&lt;ref name=es&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/theatre/review-23820207-kursk-is-unmissable.do|title=Kursk is unmissable|date=30 March 2010|accessdate=25 April 2010|work=[[Evening Standard]]|first=Fiona|last=Mountford|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409072731/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/theatre/review-23820207-kursk-is-unmissable.do|archivedate=9 April 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/theatre/article7081528.ece|title=Kursk at the Young Vic, SE1|date=31 March 2010|accessdate=24 April 2015|work=[[The Times]]|first=Sam|last=Marlowe|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615085939/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/theatre/article7081528.ece|archivedate=15 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tg&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/mar/31/kursk-review|title=Kursk|date=31 March 2010|accessdate=25 April 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|first=Lyn|last=Gardner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production history==
''Kursk'''s first run was at the [[Young Vic]] in London in 2009; it had a second run at the same theatre in 2010.&lt;ref name=tt/&gt; The play was directed by Mark Espiner and [[Dan Jones (composer)|Dan Jones]] for the theatre company Sound &amp; Fury.&lt;ref name=ft/&gt; It featured set design by [[Jon Bausor]] and starred Tom Espiner and Laurence Mitchell.&lt;ref name=es/&gt; The play utilised a split-level set, which the audience were free to walk around.&lt;ref name=tt/&gt; It was also performed at the [[Dalmeny Street drill hall|Drill Hall]] in [[Edinburgh]] in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edinburghfestival.list.co.uk/article/19862-kursk-submarine-drama/|title=Kursk – Submarine Drama|date=12 August 2009|accessdate=28 April 2015|work=[[The List (magazine)|The List]]|first=Kirstin|last=Innes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[Sydney Opera House]] in 2011.&lt;ref name=smh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/theatre/immersing-british-twist-on-a-russian-tragedy-puts-das-boot-on-the-other-foot-20111010-1lhdi.html|title=Immersing British twist on a Russian tragedy puts Das Boot on the other foot|date=11 October 2011|accessdate=28 April 2015|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|first=Jason|last=Blake}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The ''[[Russian submarine K-141 Kursk|Kursk]]'', a [[nuclear submarine]], sank in the [[Barents Sea]] in 2000, killing all 118 sailors and officers on board. In order to recreate the experiences of submariners, the directors visited [[HMNB Devonport]], spoke to naval advisers and spent time on an [[attack submarine]].&lt;ref name=ft/&gt;

==Overview==
''Kursk'' tells the story of the sinking of the ''Kursk'' from the perspective of the crew of a nearby British submarine. When the explosion of the ''Kursk'' is heard the captain of the British vessel is faced with a decision as to whether to go to its aid.&lt;ref name=tt/&gt; The play addresses the question of what would have occurred had a British submarine been watching the ''Kursk'', whether its crew would have intervened in the disaster, and the accompanying ethical and political dilemmas.&lt;ref name=ft&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e24d470c-515f-11de-84c3-00144feabdc0.html|title='Kursk' at the Young Vic|date=6 June 2009|accessdate=27 April 2015|work=[[Financial Times]]|first=Sarah|last=Hemming}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
In 2009 Rafael Behr of ''[[The Observer]]'' wrote that "At times the plot risks submersion in the sound effects and naval jargon, but there is enough emotional engagement to navigate the drama through all the periscope-swivelling simulation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/jun/21/kursk-theatre-review|title=Kursk|date=21 June 2009|accessdate=28 April 2015|work=[[The Observer]]|first=Rafael|last=Behr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Coveney of ''[[The Independent]]'' rated the play four stars and praised its recreation of the work of the submariners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/kursk-young-vic-london-1702088.html|title=Kursk, Young Vic, London|date=11 June 2009|accessdate=27 April 2015|work=[[The Independent]]|first=Michael|last=Coveney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiona Mountford of the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' praised ''Kursk'' in March 2010, writing that Lavery, Espiner and Jones "do so much right that it’s hard to know where to start." Mountford praised the writer and directors' research, the play's [[sound design]], and "the human angle, the sense of frustration and camaraderie as these men try to carve out fragments of personal lives".&lt;ref name=es/&gt; Sam Marlowe of ''[[The Times]]'' also praised the 2010 production, which he described as "thrilling and, thanks to the sensitivity of Lavery's script and the production's deft pacing, deeply affecting and thoughtful too."&lt;ref name=tt/&gt; Lyn Gardner of ''[[The Guardian]]'', described ''Kursk'' as "a remarkable piece of theatre" and praised its "immersive" approach.&lt;ref name=tg/&gt; In 2011 Jason Blake of ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' wrote that "''Kursk'''s blending of humour and sentiment, with Dan Jones's masterly sound design and convincing technical detail, makes for an enjoyable, rather than deeply involving, ride."&lt;ref name=smh/&gt;

==Awards==
[[Jon Bausor]] was nominated for an ''[[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard]]'' Theatre Award for Best Design in November 2009 for his work on ''Kursk''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/theatre/the-standard-theatre-awards-2009-longlist-revealed-6775015.html|title=The Standard Theatre Awards 2009: Longlist revealed|date=2 November 2009|accessdate=24 April 2015|work=[[Evening Standard]]|first=Louise|last=Jury}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production was nominated for "Best Touring Production" at the 2010 [[TMA Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/news/theatre/london/E8831286375539/TMA+Announces+2010+Regional+Theatre+Nominees.html |title=TMA Announces 2010 Regional Theatre Nominees |date=6 October 2010 |accessdate=24 April 2015 |work=WhatsOnStage.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009052325/http://www.whatsonstage.com/news/theatre/london/E8831286375539/TMA%2BAnnounces%2B2010%2BRegional%2BTheatre%2BNominees.html |archivedate= 9 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The National Conference on Crimes Against Children''' held in Washington, D.C. in 1993 and 1994 was noted for its impact on judicial, prosecutorial, educational, and legislative issues. The conference was one of the first bi-partisan supported conferences that involved three presidential administrations, and more than three hundred national experts on the sexual exploitation of children, gangs, and [[trafficking of children]].

The 1993 conference focus was The Sexual Exploitation of Children: Creating an Investigative and Research Agenda for the 21st Century. The 1994 conference focus was "The Physical and Sexual Exploitation of Children: Evolving Strategies &amp; Challenges to Research, Investigation and Prosecution".

The conference founder and director was [[Randy H. Skinner|Randel (Randy) H. Skinner]], a consultant to federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. Skinner continues his work in this arena in over forty states with a major emphasis in Georgia, California, Mississippi (historic civil rights cases) and Texas.

The conference included noted speakers from the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton administrations, and nationally recognized scholars on child advocacy. The conferences were also instrumental in the advocacy of the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children Sex Offender Registration Act which passed in 1994.

==History==
In 1989, Skinner coordinated a group of fifteen concerned law enforcement agencies from across Georgia, who met to explore the connection between white supremacist groups and the increase in crimes against [[African American]] youth. They also explored the increase in aberrant religious belief systems tied to familial homicides and the use of Santeria and Palo Mayombe in drug trafficking cases. This collaborative work developed into an educational component used to train law enforcement agencies nationwide throughout the 1990s.

Skinner, concerned about the amount of violence against children, notably the increase in inner-city gang violence across the nation; increase in trafficking of children and rise in the sexual exploitation of children, decided to bring together the leading authorities on prosecution, investigation, and public policy to combat crimes against children. This led to the formation of the 1993 and 1994 Conference on Crimes Against Children.

In 1995, the focus turned to crimes against children across [[Mississippi]] and [[California]], leading to work in both those states with national experts to increase the protection of Children. In Mississippi, Skinner traveled in 1996 – 1999 over 100,000 miles expanding his work on historic civil rights cases whose murders were unsolved.  Skinner worked with statewide groups on racial reconciliation and restoration calling for justice in unsolved cases. By 1999, over twelve civil rights murder cases were solved with convictions, led by courageous prosecutors.

==Speakers==

A '''New Year's resolution''' is a tradition, most common in the [[Western Hemisphere]] but also found in the [[Eastern Hemisphere]], in which a person resolves to change an undesired trait or behavior, to accomplish a personal goal or otherwise improve their life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atarehman.com/paragraph-on-new-year-resolution/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious origins==
[[Babylonians]] made promises to their gods at the start of each year that they would return borrowed objects and pay their debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=1-55002-741-7
|oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 
[[Ancient Rome|Romans]] began each year by making promises to the god [[Janus]], for whom the month of January is named.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Medieval era]], the [[knight]]s took the "[[Les Voeux du paon|peacock vow]]" at the end of the [[Christmastide|Christmas season]] each year to re-affirm their commitment to [[chivalry]].&lt;ref name="Lennox"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[watchnight service]]s, many [[Christians]] prepare for the year ahead by praying and making these resolutions.&lt;ref name="Ritchie"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Ewing Ritchie|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bV4MAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=watchnight+service | title = The Religious Life of London|year=1870|publisher = [[Tinsley Brothers]]|accessdate = 2011-12-28|quote=At A WATCH-NIGHT SERVICE: Methodism has one special institution. Its lovefeasts are old-old as Apostolic times. Its class meetings are the confessional in its simplest and most unobjectionable type, but in the institution of the watch-night it boldly struck out a new path for itself. In publicly setting apart the last fleeting moments of the old year and the first of the new to penitence, and special prayer, and stirring appeal, and fresh resolve, it has set an example which other sects are preparing to follow.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This tradition has many other religious parallels. During Judaism's New Year, [[Rosh Hashanah]], through the [[High Holidays]] and culminating in [[Yom Kippur]] (the Day of Atonement), one is to reflect upon one's wrongdoings over the year and both seek and offer forgiveness. People can act similarly during the [[Christian]] liturgical season of [[Lent]], although the motive behind this holiday is more of sacrifice than of responsibility. In fact, the [[Methodism|Methodist]] practice of New Year's resolutions came, in part, from the Lenten sacrifices.&lt;ref name="Ritchie"/&gt;{{Verify source|date=January 2017}} The concept, regardless of creed, is to reflect upon [[self-improvement]] annually.

== Participation ==
At the end of the [[Great Depression]], about a quarter of American adults formed New Year's resolutions.  At the start of the 21st century, about 40% did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statisticbrain.com/new-years-resolution-statistics/|title=New Years Resolution Statistics - Statistic Brain|author=|date=9 January 2018|website=statisticbrain.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, according to the [[American Medical Association]], approximately 40% to 50% of Americans participated in the New Year's resolution tradition from the 1995 Epcot and 1985 Gallop Polls &lt;ref&gt;Norcross, JC, Journal of Clinical Psychology, Vol. 58(4), 397-405, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; A study found 46% of participants who made common New Year's resolutions (e.g. weight loss, exercise programs, quitting smoking) were likely to succeed, over ten times as among those deciding to make life changes at other times of the year. &lt;ref&gt; Norcross, JC, Mrykalo, MS, Blagys, MD, J. Clin. Psych. 58: 397-405. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular goals ==
Some examples include resolutions to donate to the [[poverty|poor]] more often, to become more [[assertive]], or to become more  [[environmental movement|environmentally responsible]].

Popular goals include resolutions to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601042333/https://www.usa.gov/Citizen/Topics/New-Years-Resolutions.shtml|title=Popular New Year's Resolutions - USA.gov|author=|date=1 June 2015|website=archive.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Improve physical well-being: eat healthy food, lose [[body weight|weight]], [[exercise]] more, [[Nutrition|eat better]], drink less [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[smoking cessation|quit smoking]], stop [[nail biting|biting nails]], get rid of old bad habits 
* Improve mental well-being: think positive, laugh more often, enjoy life
* Improve [[Personal finance|finances]]: get out of [[debt]], save money, make small investments 
* Improve career: perform better at current job, get a better [[Job (role)|job]], establish own business 
* Improve [[education]]: improve grades, get a better education, learn something new (such as a [[foreign language]] or [[music]]), study often, read more books, improve talents 
* Improve self: become more organized, reduce [[Stress (biological)|stress]], be less [[Anger management|grumpy]], [[time management|manage time]], be more independent, perhaps watch less television, play fewer sitting-down video games
* Take a trip
* [[Volunteering|Volunteer]] to help others, practice life skills, use civic virtue, give to charity, volunteer to work part-time in a charity organization
* Get along better with people, improve social skills, enhance social intelligence

* Spend quality time with family members
* Settle down, get engaged/get married, have kids 
* Pray more, be more spiritual
* Be more involved in sports or different activities
* Spend less time on social media (such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr etc.)

== Success rate ==

The most common reason for participants failing their New Years' Resolutions was setting themselves unrealistic goals (35%), while 33% didn't keep track of their progress and a further 23% forgot about it. About one in 10 respondents claimed they made too many resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finder.com.au/press-release-bunch-of-failures-or-just-optimistic-finder-com-au-new-years-resolution-study-shows-new-year-novelty-fizzles-fast|title=Bunch of failures or just optimistic? finder.com.au New Year's Resolution Study shows New Year novelty fizzles fast - finder.com.au|first=Michelle|last=Hutchison|date=29 December 2014|website=finder.com.au|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 study by [[Richard Wiseman]] from the [[University of Bristol]] involving 3,000 people showed that 88% of those who set New Year resolutions fail,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703478704574612052322122442 Blame It on the Brain: The latest neuroscience research suggests spreading resolutions out over time is the best approach], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', December 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that 52% of the study's participants were confident of success at the beginning. Men achieved their goal 22% more often when they engaged in [[goal setting]], (a system where small measurable goals are being set; such as, a pound a week, instead of saying "lose weight").

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9705">The '''Papal Concert of Reconciliation''' was a historic musical event in the pontificate of [[Pope John Paul II]]. The concert took place in the Paul VI Auditorium at the [[Holy See|Vatican]] on January 17, 2004, in the presence of the Pontiff, Rav [[Elio Toaff]], the Emeritus [[Chief_Rabbi#Rome.2C_Italy|Chief Rabbi of Rome]], and Abdulawahab Hussein Gomaa, the Imam of the [[Mosque of Rome]],&lt;ref name=LPC&gt;{{cite web|last=London Philharmonic Choir|title=Papal Concert of Reconciliation|url=http://www.lpc.org.uk/tour_200401_rome.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120125830/http://www.lpc.org.uk/tour_200401_rome.html|archivedate=2008-11-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an audience of 7,000 invited guests.&lt;ref name=Post-Gazette /&gt;  The concert also followed the first visit to the Vatican of Israel's two chief rabbis, both of whom attended the concert.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news|last=Willey|first=David|title=Vatican concert unites faiths|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3406773.stm|accessdate=2012-08-21|newspaper=BBC News|date=2004-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was conceived, created, and conducted by Sir [[Gilbert Levine]],&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh Catholic" /&gt; whose previous musical collaborations with the Pope, including the Papal Concert to Commemorate the [[Shoah]] in 1994 with the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]]&lt;ref name="NYTimes 1994"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tagliabue|first=John|title=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/08/world/holocaust-lamentations-echo-at-vatican.html|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/03/world/pope-offers-conciliation-to-jews-and-christians.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|accessdate=2012-08-21|date=1994-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the Concert for the Pope's 80th Birthday in 2000 with the [[Philharmonia Orchestra]], among others,&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Stanley|first=Alessandra|title=Musical Friend Grants the Pope's Birthday Wish|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/18/arts/arts-abroad-musical-friend-grants-the-pope-s-birthday-wish.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|accessdate=2012-08-21|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2000-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  had earned him the sobriquet "The Pope's Maestro." In realizing the concert, Levine sought to fulfill the Pontiff's wish to reach out to the followers of the [[Abrahamic faiths]] ([[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]]), as part of the celebrations dedicated to the 25th anniversary of his pontificate.&lt;ref name=Post-Gazette&gt;{{cite news|last=Roddy|first=Dennis B.|title=Pope in peace concert|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/news/world/pope-in-peace-concert-525669/?print=1|accessdate=2012-08-18|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=2004-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pittsburgh Symphony, which Levine selected for the occasion,&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh Catholic"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bartos|first=Patricia|title=Reconciliation through Music|url=http://www.pittsburghcatholic.org/newsarticles_more.php?id=2953|accessdate=2012-08-20|newspaper=Pittsburgh Catholic|date=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;   has described the Papal Concert of Reconciliation as an “unprecedented opportunity which remains one of the most significant events in the PSO’s history."&lt;ref name="PSO Music for the Spirit" /&gt;  The concert also marked that orchestra’s first known appearance on PBS after an absence of more than 20 years, dating back to the “Previn and the Pittsburgh” PBS series, which ran from 1977-1980.&lt;ref name="PSO History"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra|title=PSO History|url=http://pso.culturaldistrict.org/pso_home/web/orchestra-history|accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In an effort to sustain the extraordinary level of enthusiasm shown by Pittsburgh natives for the Vatican performance, the Pittsburgh Symphony, at Levine's initiative, subsequently developed a concert series called "Music for the Spirit."&lt;ref name=Tribune-Review&gt;{{cite news|last=Kanny|first=Mark|title=Concert series aims to memorialize 'Music for the Spirit'|url=http://triblive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/ae/music/s_411162.html|accessdate=2012-08-20|newspaper=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review|date=2006-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levine conducted the first three of these, which included a performance of the [[Verdi]] [[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]] in [[Heinz Hall]], the [[Haydn]] "[[The Creation (Haydn)|Creation]]" to celebrate the centenary of [[Cathedral of Saint Paul (Pittsburgh)|St. Paul's Cathedral]],&lt;ref name="PSO Blog"&gt;{{cite web|last=Greer|first=Peter|title=St. Paul Cathedral Centenary Concert|url=http://Cathedral_of_Saint_Paul_(Pittsburgh)|accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a performance of [[Gustav Mahler]]'s [[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 3]], also in Heinz Hall.&lt;ref name="Tribune-Review Mahler 3"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kanny|first=Mark|title=Gilbert, PSO showcase Mahler symphony|url=http://triblive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/ae/more/s_458965.html|accessdate=2012-08-20|newspaper=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review|date=2006-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pittsburgh Symphony has continued the series in subsequent years.&lt;ref name="PSO Music for the Spirit" /&gt;

==Program==

The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, with the support of the [[Knights of Columbus]], commissioned American composer [[John Harbison]], winner of the [[Pulitzer Prize for Music]], to write a sacred motet “Abraham," for double chorus and brass, which received its world premiere at this concert.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGH4pf2EHSs Abraham]&lt;/ref&gt; The major work on the program was Mahler's [[Symphony No. 2 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 2]], “Resurrection."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1htRMKtlQ Resurrection]&lt;/ref&gt;

Harbison dedicated the work "to His Holiness Pope John Paul II in honor of his pontificate-long dedication to fostering reconciliation of the people of Abraham -- Jews, Christians, and Muslims -- and with deep gratitude to Maestro Sir Gilbert Levine, KCSG, for his 15-year-long creative collaboration with His Holiness, which led to the great honor of this commission."&lt;ref name="MIT Tech"&gt;{{cite news|last=Baskin|first=Jeremy|title=John Harbison: The Pope's Composer|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V123/N62/harbison_.62a.html|accessdate=2012-08-19|newspaper=The Tech|date=2003-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text of the piece, taken from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 17 reads: "And when Abraham was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared to Abraham and said unto him, 'I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect...and thou shalt be a father of many nations.'"

As the [[Pittsburgh Catholic]] reported, "Levine selected the Mahler piece because it focuses on the soul’s path to resurrection. The pope agreed, because of its theme of 'where the soul is reaching to everlasting life, an idea common to all three religions.'&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh Catholic" /&gt; Levine and the Vatican also considered the symphony particularly appropriate because of the first movement's "special meaning for the pope," stemming from its likely connection to the Polish poet [[Adam Mickiewicz]]'s epic 'Funeral Rites,' which "resonated with John Paul not only generally as the first Polish pope, but also personally, because as a young, aspiring actor, the future pope acted in a Mickiewicz play and memorized his poetry."&lt;ref name="Post-Gazette Mahler"&gt;{{cite news|last=Druckenbrod|first=Andrew|title=PSO and guest conductor relish challenges presented by Vatican concert|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/ae/20040113vatican0113fnp1.asp|accessdate=2012-08-20|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=2004-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the finale of the symphony, the Pope requested an encore—an unprecedented act for a papal concert.&lt;ref name=Post-Gazette /&gt;  Because Vatican protocol then restricted all concerts to a duration of 72 minutes, only movements 1, 4, and 5 of the Mahler were performed.&lt;ref name=Post-Gazette /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2413">'''Paul Procopolis''' is the name given to a non-existent [[classical music|classical]] [[piano|pianist]] who was credited as a performer on various recordings.

With the advent of cheap long-playing records, unscrupulous companies issued records of material under pseudonyms to avoid paying royalties or because they did not own the [[copyright]] to the recordings. In the case of Paul Procopolis, the reasons for the recording company, [[Saga Records]] issuing recordings pseudonymously are uncertain, as they would have had the copyright to at least some of the material. According to Robin O'Connor (see external links), the company's intention was to compile pre-existing recordings by several different performers on one album and present them as the work of a single performer.

The name Paul Procopolis was used to reissue recordings by the pianist [[Sergio Fiorentino]], including the complete [[Chopin]] waltzes, extracts from [[Bach]]'s ''Well-Tempered Clavier'', and works by [[Liszt]]. Some of the LPs included a biography of Procopolis who, it was alleged, was born in Athens in 1934, studied with Nadia Boulanger in Paris and lived and taught in Greece. The biography was written by Robin O'Connor. Various other LPs give no biographical information at all.

Ernst Lumpe has attempted to identify the real artists in the Procopolis recordings. Other pianists whose recordings were issued under this name included [[Bernard Vitebsky]] (his Beethoven concerto number 3), [[Albert Ferber]] (an LP of "The World's Best Loved Piano Music") and [[Clive Lythgoe]]. The recording of the second Chopin concerto has been identified as that of the Brazilian pianist [[Carmen Vitis Adnet]] (who lived in Vienna and was married to pianist [[Hans Graf]]) with the [[Vienna Symphony]] under [[Hans Swarowsky]]. Further recordings (such as the first Chopin concerto) remain unidentified.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

The '''Siege of Bani Walid''' was a military conflict in [[Libya]].

==History==

[[Bani Walid]] is an oasis town in western Libya which has a historic rivalry with the city of [[Misrata]]. During the civil war in 2011, Bani Walid remained a bastion of support for the government of [[Muammar Gaddafi]] until the very end of the war, while Misrata was one of the first towns to rise up, emerging victorious from a [[Battle of Misrata|months-long siege]]. After the end of the war, a number of Misratan militias made efforts to capture those people whom they believed were linked to the previous government.

After a string of abuses, local fighters in Bani Walid retook control of their town and expelled the new government from the city. The brigade was then involved in revenge kidnappings with Misrata during the majority of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In July, while they were holding two Misratan journalists, fighters in Bani Walid captured and tortured Misratan militiaman Omran Shaaban, one of the original [[Death of Muammar Gaddafi|captors of Gaddafi]] at the end of the [[Battle of Sirte (2011)|battle of Sirte]]. He died later of his wounds. In response, the Libyan Congress authorized the use of force against Bani Walid to capture those responsible for the deaths, setting a deadline of 5 October for the town to peacefully comply. The local government of Bani Walid rejected the decision, stating that no true judiciary system existed in Libya.

Following this event, the armed forces of the new government and allied independent militias mounted a siege on the city.

==Fighting==
At the end of September, the Libyan Shield brigade from the Libyan government and Misrata militias cut the roads leading to Bani Walid, preventing civilian supplies from entering the city. Amnesty International protested against the siege of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 10 October, violent clashes erupted between Bani Walid militias and Misrata militias in the valley of Mardum, 10&amp;nbsp;km east of Bani Walid. One Bani Walid fighter was killed and two others injured, while the overall death toll was put at 10 killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 18 October, around 2,000 [[Libyan National Army]] units and its aligned militias, mainly from city of [[Misrata]], started, after failed negotiations between the government and the local council, full-scale attack on [[Bani Walid]]. Army spokesman claimed that army moved quickly and secured town airport and was closing to city centre.

On 19 October, the Misrata militias and the Libyan army had pulled back, and the president of the transitional congress imposed a 48-hour ceasefire, condemning the "unauthorized assault" of the Misrata and government forces. Eight government soldiers and militiamen were killed in the fighting, while 12 people from Bani Walid, fighters and residents.&lt;ref name="Magarief condemns"&gt;{{cite web

Their closest position to Bani Walid was some 25 miles from the town itself, a point captured during the offensive between 16 and 18 October. Despite claims from Margarief that the resolution needed to be peaceful, the Libyan Army and its allied militia was preparing another assault, moving heavy weapons and ammunition to the battlefield.&lt;ref name="Magarief condemns" /&gt;

The shelling on the city and its outskirts continued and the ceasefire was ignored, with five residents, including a child, killed and 40 houses destroyed by the rockets fired by the militias. The shelling was concentrated on the Valley of Mardoum. The military commander of Bani Walid stated that his forces were still in full control of the city. Libyan Shields forces and Misrata militias stated that their offensive had been sanctioned by the government, while a military official denied it, adding to the confusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 22 October, more clashes near the town left another two pro-government fighters dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFL5E8LMDWW20121022?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0|title=Civilians flee besieged former Gaddafi stronghold in Libya|publisher=|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 October Colonel Ali al-Shekhili claimed that the Army has control of the airport, hospital and other important places. The Airport takeover, together with the military occupation of Mordum, Shmeagh and Tniena districts on the outskirts was confirmed by one of the refugees who fled the city. The Colonel said that the Army met little resistance and said that they are shelling the city. A local said that the Army is entering the city with  bulldozers demolishing houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Army pushes into Bani Walid as Libya marks anniversary |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/23/uk-libya-anniversary-idUKBRE89M14L20121023 |publisher=Reuters |date=23 October 2012 |accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libyaherald.com/?p=16683 Bani Walid residents say military in control of surrounding districts as tens of thousands flee]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==

On 30 October, Libyan Minister of Defence Osama al-Juwail came into conflict with army chief-of-staff Yousef Mangoush over the control of the army over the oasis town. While Mangoush claimed that military operations have ceased and town is under its control, the defence minister stated that militia outside the army's command, not the army itself, are in control of Bani Walid. This was not the first time when Mangoush and Juwail have disagreed, with minister being strongly in favour of greater ministry, rather than military, control over the army.

Refugees were also reportedly not allowed to return to their homes, and journalists were forbidden to enterto the city by soldiers and militiamen manning the checkpoints on the outskirts of the city, despite army promises of right of return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/10/20121029234922385278.html |title=Libyan army has 'no control' in Bani Walid - Africa |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libyaherald.com/2012/10/30/defence-minister-says-army-chief-has-no-control-over-bani-walid/ Defence minister says army chief has “no control” over Bani Walid]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 November, an AFP reporter was able to enter the town and reported heavy damage from the fighting. The residential area near the university, several buildings in the Gweida district and several public buildings were destroyed by fire, which was blamed by a local medic on militias from both Bani Walid and Misrata, as well as with common criminals. The correspondent also witnessed three separate incidents of thefts by Misratan militiamen. The town still remained largely empty, with only a few police and army patrols in the centre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khaleejtimes.com/kt-article-display-1.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2012/November/middleeast_November9.xml&amp;section=middleeast Libya town wracked by political score-settling]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 December, fresh fighting breaks out in Bani Walid. Members of the security forces clashed with armed men in the central Dahra area of Bani Walid today, leaving three members of the armed force dead and a number of other security personnel injured.&lt;ref name="libyaherald.com"/&gt;
AFP - Armed men killed four policemen and two soldiers Sunday in separate attacks in Libya, including one in a former bastion of Moamer Kadhafi's regime that was toppled last year, security officials said.&lt;ref name="france24.com"/&gt;

On October 5, 2013 Gunmen killed at least 12 Libyan soldiers in an attack on a checkpoint near the city of Bani Walid, a former stronghold of supporters of Muammar Gadhafi, security officials said on Saturday. The ambush happened on the road between Bani Walid and the town of Tarhouna, where the army had a checkpoint. They came under heavy gunfire. Between 12 and 15 soldiers were killed," said Ali Sheikhi, a spokesman for the army joint chief of staff.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18051">'''Solder fatigue''' is the mechanical degradation of [[solder]] due to [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]] under cyclic loading. This can often occur at [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] levels below the [[yield stress]] of solder as a result of repeated temperature fluctuations, mechanical [[vibration]]s, or [[structural load|mechanical loads]]. Techniques to evaluate solder fatigue behavior include [[Finite element method|finite element analysis]] and semi-analytical closed form equations.&lt;ref&gt;Serebreni, M., Blattau, N., Sharon, G., Hillman, C., Mccluskey, P. "Semi-analytical fatigue life model for reliability assessment of solder joints in qfn packages under thermal cycling". SMTA ICSR, 2017.

==Overview==
Solder is a [[metal alloy]] used to form electrical, thermal, and mechanical interconnections between the component and [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) substrate in an electronic assembly. Although other forms of cyclic loading are known to cause solder fatigue, it has been estimated that the largest portion of electronic failures are thermomechanically&lt;ref&gt;G. Sharon, "Temperature Cycling and Electronics", http://www.dfrsolutions.com/hubfs/Resources/services/Temperature-Cycling-and-Fatigue-in-Electronics-White-Paper.pdf?t=1507741523533&lt;/ref&gt; driven due to [[temperature]] cycling.&lt;ref&gt;Wunderle, B.; B. Michel, "Progress in Reliability Research in Micro and Nano Region", Microelectronics and Reliability, V46, Issue 9-11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Under thermal cycling, stresses are generated in the solder due to [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] (CTE) mismatches. This causes the solder joints to experience non-recoverable deformation via [[creep (deformation)|creep]] and [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] that accumulates and leads to degradation and eventual [[fracture]].

Historically, tin-lead solders were common alloys used in the [[electronics industry]]. Although they are still used in select industries and applications, [[lead-free solder]]s have become significantly more popular due to [[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive|RoHS]] regulatory requirements. This new trend increased the need to understand the behavior of lead-free solders.

Much work has been done to characterize the creep-fatigue behavior of various solder alloys and develop predictive life damage models using a [[Physics of Failure]] approach. These models are often used when trying to assess solder joint reliability. The [[Solder Fatigue|fatigue]] life of a solder joint depends on several factors including: the alloy type and resulting [[microstructure]],  the joint geometry, the component material properties, the PCB substrate material properties, the loading conditions, and the boundary conditions of the assembly.

==Thermomechanical solder fatigue==
During a product’s operational lifetime it undergoes temperature fluctuations from application specific temperature excursions and self-heating due to component [[power dissipation]]. Global and local mismatches of coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) between the component, component leads, PCB substrate, and system level effects&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dfrsolutions.com/hubfs/Resources/System_Level_Effects_on_Solder_Joint_Reliability.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; drive stresses in the interconnects (i.e. solder joints). Repeated temperature cycling eventually leads to thermomechanical fatigue.

The deformation characteristics of various solder alloys can be described at the microscale due to the differences in composition and resulting microstructure. Compositional differences lead to variations in [[Phase (matter)|phase]](s), grain size, and [[intermetallics]]. This affects susceptibility to [[deformation mechanism]]s such as [[dislocation]] motion, [[diffusion]] and [[grain boundary sliding]]. During thermal cycling, the solder's microstructure (grains/phases) will tend to coarsen&lt;ref&gt;Crina Rauta, Abhijit Dasgupta, Craig Hillman, "Solder Phase Coarsening, Fundamentals, Preparation, Measurement and Prediction", https://www.dfrsolutions.com/hubfs/Resources/services/Solder-Phase-Coarsening-Fundamentals-Preparation-Measurement-and-Prediction.pdf?t=1514473946162&lt;/ref&gt; as energy is dissipated from the joint. This eventually leads to crack initiation and [[crack propagation|propagation]] which can be described as accumulated fatigue damage.&lt;ref&gt;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.115.7354&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting bulk behavior of solder is described as [[viscoplastic]] (i.e. rate dependent inelastic deformation) with sensitivity to elevated temperatures. Most solders experience temperature exposures near their melting temperature (high [[homologous temperature]]) throughout their operational lifetime which makes them susceptible to significant creep. Several constitutive models have been developed to capture the creep characteristics of lead and lead-free solders. Creep behavior can be described in three stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary creep. When modeling solder, secondary creep, also called steady state creep (constant strain rate), is often the region of interest for describing solder behavior in electronics. Some models also incorporate primary creep. Two of the most popular models are hyperbolic sine models developed by Garofalo&lt;ref&gt;Garofalo, F., 1965, "Fundamentals of Creep and Creep-Rupture in Metals", Macmillan, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; and Anand&lt;ref&gt;Anand, L., 1985, "Constitutive Equations for Hot Working of Metals", J. Plasticity, 1(3), pp. 213–231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, S. B.; Kim, K. H.; Anand, L., 1989, "An Internal Variable Constitutive Model for Hot Working of Metals," Int. J. Plasticity, 5(2), pp. 95–130&lt;/ref&gt; to characterize the steady state creep of solder. These model parameters are often incorporated as inputs in [[Finite element method|FEA]] simulations to properly characterize the solder response to loading.

==Fatigue models==
Solder damage models take a physics of failure based approach by relating a physical parameter that is a critical measure of the damage mechanism process (i.e. inelastic strain range or dissipated strain energy density) to cycles to failure. The relationship between the physical parameter and cycles to failure typically takes on a power law or modified power law relationship with material dependent model constants. These model constants are fit from experimental testing and simulation for different solder alloys. For complex loading schemes, Miner's linear damage superposition law&lt;ref&gt;M. A. Miner, "Cumulative damage in fatigue", Journal of applied mechanics, vol. 12, pp. 159-164, 1945&lt;/ref&gt; is employed to calculate accumulated damage.

=== Coffin-Manson model ===
The generalized Coffin-Manson&lt;ref&gt;L. F. Coffin, "The Problem of Thermal Stress Fatigue in Austenitic Steels", Special Technical Publication 165, ASTM, 1954, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. F. Coffin, "A study of the Effects of Cyclic Thermal Stresses on a Ductile Metal", Trans. ASME, 76, 931–950 (August 1954).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. S. Manson, "Behavior of materials under conditions of thermal stress", Proceedings of the Heat Transfer Symposium, University of Michigan Engineering Research Institute, Ann Arbor, Mich, pp. 9-75, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dowling, N. E., "Mechanical Behavior of Materials", 2nd Edition, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; model considers the elastic and plastic strain range by incorporating Basquin’s equation&lt;ref&gt;Basquin, O. H. (1910). "The exponential law of endurance test". Proceedings of the American Society for Testing and Materials. 10: 625–630.&lt;/ref&gt; and takes the form:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta\epsilon}{2}=\frac{\sigma^'_f-\sigma_m}{E} (2N_f)^b+\epsilon^'_f (2N_f)^c&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''∆ε'' ⁄ 2 represents the elastic-plastic cyclic strain range, ''E'' represents elastic modulus, ''σ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' represents means stress, and ''N&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' represents cycles to failure. The remaining variables, namely ''σ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'',''ε'&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'',''b'',and ''c'' are fatigue coefficients and exponents representing material model constants. The generalized Coffin-Manson model accounts for the effects of high cycle fatigue (HCF) primarily due to elastic deformation and [[low cycle fatigue]] (LCF) primarily due to plastic deformation.

=== Engelmaier model ===
In the 1980s Engelmaier proposed a model,&lt;ref&gt;Engelmaier, W., "Fatigue Life of Leadless Chip Carrier Solder Joints During Power Cycling", Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology, IEEE Transactions on, vol.6, no.3, pp. 232-237, September 1983&lt;/ref&gt; in conjunction with the work of Wild,&lt;ref&gt;Wild, R. N., "Some Fatigue Properties of Solders and Solder Joints", IBM Tech. Rep. 73Z000421, January 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; that accounted for some of the limitations of the Coffin-Manson model such as the effects of the frequency and temperature. His model takes a similar power law form:

&lt;math&gt;N_f(50\%)=\frac{1}{2} (\frac{\Delta\gamma}{2 \epsilon'_f})^{\frac{1}{c}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c=-0.442-6\cdot 10^{-4}T_s+1.74\cdot 10^{-2} \ln (1+f)&lt;/math&gt;

Engelmaier relates the total shear strain (∆γ) to cycles to failure (''N&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'').  ''ε'&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''c'' are model constants where ''c'' is a function of mean temperature during thermal cycling (''T&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'') and thermal cycling frequency (''f'').

&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \gamma= C ( \frac{L_D}{h_s}) \Delta \alpha \Delta T
&lt;/math&gt;

∆γ can be calculated as function of the distance from the neutral point (''L&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'') solder joint height (''h&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''), coefficient of thermal expansion (∆''α''), and change in temeprate (Δ''T''). In this case ''C'' is empirical model constant.

This model was initially proposed for leadless devices with tin-lead solder. The model has since been modified by Engelmaier and others to account for other phenomena such as leaded components, thermal cycling dwell times, and lead-free solders. While initially a substantial improvement over other techniques to predict solder fatigue, such as testing and simple acceleration transforms, it is now generally acknowledged that Engelmaier and other models that are based on strain range do not provide a sufficient degree of accuracy.

=== Darveaux model ===
Darveaux&lt;ref&gt;Darveaux, R., 1997, "Solder Joint Fatigue Life Model", in Design &amp; Reliability of Solder and Solder Interconnections, Proceedings of the ‘TMS, Orlando, Florida, February 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darveaux, R. (2000) Effect of simulation methodology on solder joint crack growth correlation. Electronic Components and Technology Conference, 2000 IEEE, pp 158–169&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a model relating the quantity of volume weighted average inelastic work density, the number of cycles to crack initiation, and the crack propagation rate to the characteristic cycles to failure.

&lt;math&gt;N_0=K_1\Delta W^{K_2}_{avg}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{da}{dN}=K_3\Delta W^{K_4}_{avg}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;N_f=N_0+\frac{a}{da/dN}=K_1\Delta W^{K_2}_{avg}+\frac{a}{K_3 \Delta W^{K_4}_{avg}}&lt;/math&gt;

In the first equation ''N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' represents the number of cycles to crack initiation, ∆W represents inelastic work density, ''K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' are material model constants. In the second equation, da/dN represents the crack prorogation rate, ∆W represents inelastic work density, ''K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'' are material model constants. In this case the crack propagation rate is approximated to be constant. ''N&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' represents the characteristic cycles to failure and a represents the characteristic crack length. Model constants can be fit for different solder alloys using a combination of experimental testing and [[Finite Element Analysis]] (FEA) simulation.

The Darveaux model has been found to be relatively accurate by several authors.&lt;ref&gt;Ye, Yuming, et al. "Assessment on reliability of BGA package double-sided assembled". High Density Packaging and Microsystem Integration, 2007. HDP'07. International Symposium on. IEEE, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meifunas, M., et al. "Measurement and prediction of reliability for double-sided area array assemblies". Electronic Components and Technology Conference, 2003. Proceedings. 53rd. IEEE, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the expertise, complexity, and simulation resources required, its use has been primarily limited to component manufacturers evaluating component packaging. The model has not received acceptance in regards to modeling solder fatigue across an entire printed circuit assembly and has been found to be inaccurate in predicting system-level effects (triaxiality) on solder fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dfrsolutions.com/hubfs/Developing%20Damage%20Models%20for%20Solder%20Joints%20Exposed%20to%20Complex%20Stress%20States.pdf?t=1505335343846, Hillman, C., "Developing Damage Models for Solder Joints Exposed to Complex Stress States: Influence of Potting,
Coating, BGA Mirroring, and Housing on Solder Joint Fatigue", Proceedings of the EMPC, Warsaw, Poland, September, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blattau model ===
The current solder joint fatigue model preferred by the majority of electronic [[OEM]]s worldwide is the [http://www.dfrsolutions.com/about-us/dfr-solutions-team Blattau] model, which is available in the [[Sherlock Automated Design Analysis|Sherlock Automated Design Analysis software]]. The Blattau model is an effective evolution of the previous models discussed above. Blattau incorporates the use of strain energy proposed by Darveaux, while using closed-form equations based on classic mechanics to calculate the stress and strain being applied to the solder interconnect.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dfrsolutions.com/hubfs/DfR_Solutions_Website/Resources-Archived/Publications/2005-2007/2006_Blattau_IPC_working.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; An example of these stress/strain calculations for a simple leadless chip component is shown in the following equation:

&lt;math&gt;\alpha_1-\alpha_2\cdot \Delta T \cdot L_D=F \cdot ( \frac{L_D}{E_1 A_1}+ \frac{L_D}{E_2 A_2}+\frac{h_S
}{A_s G_s}+\frac{h_c}{A_c G_c}+(\frac{2-\nu}{9G_b a}))
&lt;/math&gt;

Here α is the CTE, T is temperature, ''L&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the distance to the neutral point, E is elastic modulus, A is the area, h is the thickness, G is shear modulus, ν is [[Poisson's ratio]], and a is the edge length of the copper bond pad. The subscripts 1 refer to the component, 2 and b refer to the board, and s refer to the solder joint. The shear stress (∆τ) is then calculated by dividing this calculated force by the effective solder joint area. Strain energy is computed using the shear strain range and shear stress from the following relationship:

&lt;math&gt;
\Delta W= \frac{1}{2}\Delta \gamma \Delta \tau
&lt;/math&gt;

This approximates the [[hysteresis]] loop to be roughly equilateral in shape. Blattau uses this strain energy value in conjunction with models developed by Syed&lt;ref name=Syed&gt;Syed, A., "Accumulated Creep Strain and Energy Density Based Thermal Fatigue Life Prediction Models for SnAgCu Solder Joints", ECTC 2004, pp. 737-746 - corrected.&lt;/ref&gt; to relate dissipated strain energy to cycles to failure.

===Other fatigue models===
Additional strain range and strain energy based models have been proposed by several others.&lt;ref name=Syed/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Knecht; L. Fox, "Integrated matrix creep: Application to accelerated testing and lifetime prediction", in Solder Joint Reliability Theory and Applications, J. H. Lau, Ed. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1991, ch. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee, W. W.; Nguyen, L. T.; Selvaduray, G. S., "Solder joint fatigue models: review and applicability to chip scale packages". Microelectronics Reliability 40 (2000) 231-244, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vibration and cyclic mechanical fatigue==

While not as prevalent as thermomechanical solder fatigue, [[vibration fatigue]] and cyclic mechanical fatigue are also known to cause solder failures. Vibration fatigue is typically considered to be high cycle fatigue (HCF) with damage driven by elastic deformation and sometimes plastic deformation. This can depend on the input excitation for both [[harmonic]] and [[random vibration]]. Steinberg&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, D. S. "Vibration analysis for electronic equipment". John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; developed a vibration model to predict time to failure based on the calculated board displacement. This model takes into account the input vibration profile such as the [[power spectral density]] or acceleration time history, the natural frequency of the circuit card, and the transmissibility. Blattau developed a modified Steinberg model&lt;ref&gt;http://resources.dfrsolutions.com/Guarantee-Reliability-with-Vibration-Simulation-and-Testing.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; that uses board level strains rather than displacement and has sensitivity to individual package types.

Additionally, low temperature isothermal mechanical cycling is typically modeled with a combination of LCF and HCF strain range or strain energy models. The solder alloy, assembly geometry and materials, boundary conditions, and loading conditions will affect whether fatigue damage is dominated by elastic (HCF) or plastic (LCF) damage. At lower temperatures and faster strain rates the creep can approximated to be minimal and any inelastic damage will be dominated by plasticity. Several strain range and strain energy models have been employed in this type of a case, such as the Generalized Coffin-Manson model. In this case, much work has been done to characterize the model constants of various damage models for different alloys.

In 2005, [[Kofi Annan]], then Secretary-General of the United Nations described the [[mass murder]] as the worst crime on European soil since the [[Second World War]],&lt;ref name="UN SecGen 10th anniv"&gt;[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/sgsm9993.doc.htm UN Press Release SG/SM/9993UN, 11/07/2005 "Secretary-General Kofi Annan’s message to the ceremony marking the tenth anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre in Potocari-Srebrenica"]. Retrieved 9 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and in a message to the tenth anniversary commemoration of the massacre, he wrote that, while blame lay "first and foremost with those who planned and carried out the massacre and those who assisted and harboured them", the UN had "made serious errors of judgement, rooted in a philosophy of impartiality", describing Srebrenica as a tragedy that would haunt the history of the UN forever.&lt;ref name="UN SecGen 10th anniv" /&gt;

In 2006, in the ''[[Bosnian Genocide case]]'' held before the International Court of Justice, [[Serbia and Montenegro]] was cleared of direct responsibility for, or complicity in, the massacre, but was found responsible for not doing enough to prevent the genocide and not prosecuting those responsible, in breach of the [[Genocide Convention]].

== Background ==

=== Conflict in eastern Bosnia ===
{{See also|Yugoslav Wars|Bosnian War}}

The multiethnic [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was mainly inhabited by Muslim [[Bosniaks]] (44 percent), [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Serbs]] (31 percent) and Catholic [[Croats]] (17 percent). Following a declaration of national sovereignty on 15 October 1991 as the former Yugoslavia began to disintegrate, a [[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina|referendum for independence]] was held on 29 February 1992. The result, in favour of independence, was rejected by the political representatives of the Bosnian Serbs who had boycotted the referendum. The [[Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was formally recognised by the [[European Community]] and the United States in April 1992. Following the declaration of independence, Bosnian Serb forces, supported by the [[Serbian government]] of [[Slobodan Milošević]] and the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA), attacked the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to unify and secure Serb territory. A fierce struggle for territorial control ensued, accompanied by the [[ethnic cleansing]] of the non-Serb population from areas under Serb control; in particular, the Bosniak population of Eastern Bosnia, near the border with Serbia.&lt;ref name="ICTY: Kunarac, Kovač and Vuković judgement – Foča"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/kunarac/trialc2/judgement/kun-tj010222e-5.htm#VC |title=ICTY: The attack against the civilian population and related requirements |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219012918/http://un.org/icty/kunarac/trialc2/judgement/kun-tj010222e-5.htm#VC |archivedate=19 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1992 ethnic cleansing campaign ====

The predominantly Bosniak area of Central [[Podrinje]] (the region around Srebrenica) had a primary strategic importance to Serbs, as without it there would be no territorial integrity within their new political entity of [[Republika Srpska]].&lt;ref&gt;ICTY, Prosecutor vs. Krstic, Trial Chamber Judgement, para. 12&lt;/ref&gt; They thus proceeded with the [[ethnic cleansing]] of Bosniaks from Bosniak ethnic territories in Eastern Bosnia and Central Podrinje. In the words of the ICTY judgement:

{{quote|Once towns and villages were securely in their hands, the Serb forces—the military, the police, the paramilitaries and, sometimes, even Serb villagers—applied the same pattern: Muslim houses and apartments were systematically ransacked or burnt down, Muslim villagers were rounded up or captured and, in the process, sometimes beaten or killed. Men and women were separated, with many of the men detained in the former KP Dom prison.&lt;ref name="ICTY: Kunarac, Kovač and Vuković judgement – Foča" /&gt;}}

In neighbouring [[Bratunac]], Bosniaks were either killed or forced to flee to Srebrenica, resulting in 1,156 deaths, according to Bosnian government data.&lt;ref name="Bratunac"&gt;Bratunac Municipality Officials, "Truth about Bratunac (Istina o Bratuncu)". 1995 {{cite web |url=http://bratunac.com/content.php?content.12  |accessdate=2006-06-29 |df=dmy-all }}{{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of Bosniaks were also killed in [[Foča massacres|Foča]], [[Zvornik]], [[Cerska]] and [[Snagovo]].&lt;ref name="IDC: Podrinje victim statistics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idc.org.ba/onama/izvjestaj_analize_po_centrima.html#podrinje |title=IDC: Podrinje victim statistics |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707071037/http://www.idc.org.ba/onama/izvjestaj_analize_po_centrima.html |archivedate=7 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fate of Bosniak villages====
The Bosnian Institute in the UK has published a list of 296 villages destroyed by Serb forces around Srebrenica during the first three months of war (April – June 1992):&lt;ref&gt;Bosnian Institute UK, the 26-page study: "[http://www.bosnia.org.uk/news/news_body.cfm?newsid=2771 Prelude to the Srebrenica Genocide – mass murder and ethnic cleansing of Bosniaks in the Srebrenica region during the first three months of the Bosnian War (April–June 1992)]", 18 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|More than three years before the 1995 Srebrenica genocide, Bosnian Serb nationalists—with the logistical, moral and financial support of Serbia and the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA)—destroyed 296 predominantly Bosniak villages in the region around Srebrenica, forcibly uprooting some 70,000 Bosniaks from their homes and systematically massacring at least 3,166 Bosniaks (documented deaths) including many women, children and elderly.}}

According to the [[Naser Orić]] trial judgement:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/oric/tjug/en/ori-jud060630e.pdf |title=Naser Oric Trial Judgement, ICTY |format=PDF |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Between April 1992 and March 1993, the town of Srebrenica and the villages in the area held by Bosniak were constantly subjected to Serb military assaults, including artillery attacks, sniper fire, as well as occasional bombing from aircraft. Each onslaught followed a similar pattern. Serb soldiers and paramilitaries surrounded a Bosnian Muslim village or hamlet, called upon the population to surrender their weapons, and then began with indiscriminate shelling and shooting. In most cases, they then entered the village or hamlet, expelled or killed the population, who offered no significant resistance, and destroyed their homes. During this period, Srebrenica was subjected to indiscriminate shelling from all directions on a daily basis. Potočari in particular was a daily target for Serb artillery and infantry because it was a sensitive point in the defence line around Srebrenica. Other Bosnian Muslim settlements were routinely attacked as well. All this resulted in a great number of refugees and casualties.}}

==== Struggle for Srebrenica 1992–1993 ====
Serb military and paramilitary forces from the area and neighbouring parts of eastern Bosnia and Serbia gained control of Srebrenica for several weeks in early 1992, killing and expelling Bosniak civilians. In May 1992, Bosnian government forces under the leadership of Orić recaptured the town.

Over the remainder of 1992, offensives by Bosnian government forces from Srebrenica increased the area under their control, and by January 1993 they had linked with Bosniak-held [[Žepa]] to the south and Cerska to the west. At this time, the Srebrenica enclave had reached its peak size of 900 square kilometres (350 sq miles), although it was never linked to the main area of Bosnian-government controlled land in the west and remained, in the words of the ICTY, "a vulnerable island amid Serb-controlled territory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/ |title=Prosecutor vs. Radislav Krstic Judgement |location=para.

The actions carried out by the ARBIH under the command of [[Naser Orić]] were seen as a catalyst for what occurred in Srebrenica in 1995. According to General [[Philippe Morillon]]'s testimony at the session of the ICTY 12 February 2004:{{quotation|JUDGE ROBINSON: Are you saying, then, General, that what happened in 1995 was a direct reaction to what Naser Oric did to the Serbs two years before?&lt;br/&gt;
THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes. Yes, Your Honour. I am
convinced of that. This doesn't mean to pardon or diminish the
responsibility of the people who committed that crime, but I am convinced
of that, yes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/slobodan_milosevic/trans/en/040212ED.htm|title=040212ED|publisher=Icty.org|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
Over the next few months, the Serb military captured the villages of Konjević Polje and Cerska, severing the link between Srebrenica and Žepa and reducing the size of the Srebrenica enclave to 150 square kilometres. Bosniak residents of the outlying areas converged on the town of Srebrenica and its population swelled to between 50,000 and 60,000 people.

General [[Philippe Morillon]] of France, Commander of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), visited Srebrenica in March 1993. By then, the town was overcrowded and [[siege]] conditions prevailed. There was almost no running water as the advancing Serb forces had destroyed the town's water supplies; people relied on makeshift generators for electricity. Food, medicine and other essentials were extremely scarce. Before leaving, General Morillon told the panicked residents of Srebrenica at a public gathering that the town was under the protection of the UN and that he would never abandon them.

Between March and April 1993 several thousand Bosniaks were evacuated from Srebrenica under the auspices of the [[UN High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR). The evacuations were opposed by the Bosnian government in [[Sarajevo]] as contributing to the ethnic cleansing of predominantly Bosniak territory.

The Serb authorities remained intent on capturing the enclave. On 13 April 1993, the Serbs told the UNHCR representatives that they would attack the town within two days unless the Bosniaks surrendered and agreed to be evacuated.&lt;ref&gt;ICTY, Prosecutor vs. Krstic; Trial Chamber Judgement; United Nations; para. 13–17.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bosniaks refused to surrender.

====Starvation in Srebrenica 1992–1995====
With the failure to demilitarize and lack of supplies getting into the city, [[Naser Orić]] consolidated his power and controlled the black market. Orić's men began hoarding food, fuel, cigarettes and embezzled money sent by foreign aid agencies to support Muslim orphans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Danner|first1=Mark|title=Stripping Bare the Body: Politics, Violence, War|date=1 October 2009|publisher=Nation Books|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basic necessities were out of reach for many of the people in Srebrenica due to the actions of [[Naser Orić]]. UN officials were beginning to lose patience with the ARBiH in Srebrenica and saw them as: "criminal gang leaders, pimps and black marketeers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Danner|first1=Mark|title=Stripping Bare the Body: Politics, Violence, War|date=1 October 2009|publisher=Nation Books|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A former Serb soldier of the "[[JSO (Special Operations Unit)#History|Red Berets]]" unit described the tactics used to starve and kill the besieged population of Srebrenica:

{{quote|It was almost like a game, a cat-and-mouse hunt. But of course we greatly outnumbered the Muslims, so in almost all cases, we were the hunters and they were the prey. We needed them to surrender, but how do you get someone to surrender in a war like this? You starve them to death. So very quickly we realised that it wasn't really weapons being smuggled into Srebrenica that we should worry about, but food. They were truly starving in there, so they would send people out to steal cattle or gather crops, and our job was to find and kill them... No prisoners. Well, yes, if we thought they had useful information, we might keep them alive until we got it out of them, but in the end, no prisoners... The local people became quite indignant, so sometimes we would keep someone alive to hand over to them [to kill] just to keep them happy.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |work=The New York Times Magazine |first=Scott |last=Anderson |date=28 May 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/05/29/magazine/srebrenica-life-in-the-valley-of-death.html |title=Life in the Valley of Death |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When Australian journalist Tony Birtley visited the besieged Srebrenica in March 1993, he took footage of Bosniak civilians starving to death.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Birtley, ABC News Archive Footage, March 1993. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz_dVScxOtg&lt;/ref&gt;

The judgment of the Hague Tribunal in the case of Naser Oric found that:

{{quote|Bosnian Serb forces controlling the access roads were not allowing international humanitarian aid—most importantly, food and medicine—to reach Srebrenica. As a consequence, there was a constant and serious shortage of food causing starvation to peak in the winter of 1992/1993. Numerous people died or were in an extremely emaciated state due to malnutrition. Bosnian Muslim fighters and their families, however, were provided with food rations from existing storage facilities. The most disadvantaged group among the Bosnian Muslims was that of the refugees, who usually lived on the streets and without shelter, in freezing temperatures. Only in November and December 1992, did two UN convoys with humanitarian aid reach the enclave, and this despite Bosnian Serb obstruction."&lt;ref&gt;Judgment in the Oric case, par.110. The International Criminal Tribunal at the Hague&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Organisation of UNPROFOR and UNPF====
{{main|United Nations Protection Force}}
In April 1995, UNPROFOR became the name used only for the Bosnia regional command of the now renamed, [[United Nations Peace Forces]] (UNPF).&lt;ref name="cnj.it" /&gt;

The 2011 report ''[[Srebrenica: a 'safe' area]]'' said that "On 12 June 1995 a new command was created under UNPF,&lt;ref name="cnj.it"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnj.it/documentazione/Srebrenica/NIOD/NIOD%20Part%20II.pdf |title=Srebrenica – a 'safe' area |publisher=NIOD |date=2011 |accessdate=21 July 2015 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had "12,500 British, French and Dutch troops equipped with tanks and high calibre artillery in order to increase the effectiveness and the credibility of the peacekeeping operation".&lt;ref name="cnj.it" /&gt;

Furthermore, it said, "In the UNPROFOR [[command hierarchy|chain of command]], [[Dutchbat]] occupied the fourth tier, with the sector commanders occupying the third tier. The fourth tier primarily had an operational task. Within this structure, Dutchbat was expected to operate as an independent unit with its own logistic arrangements. Dutchbat was dependent on the UNPROFOR organization to some extent for crucial supplies such as fuel. For the rest, it was expected to obtain its supplies from the Netherlands. From an organizational point of view, the battalion had two lifelines: UNPROFOR and the Royal Netherlands Army. Dutchbat had been assigned responsibility for the Srebrenica Safe Area. Neither UNPROFOR nor Bosnia-Hercegovina paid much attention to Srebrenica, however. Srebrenica was situated in eastern Bosnia, which was geographically and mentally far removed from Sarajevo and Zagreb. The rest of the world was focused on the fight for Sarajevo and the peace process. As a Safe Area, Srebrenica only occasionally managed to attract the attention of the world press or the UN Security Council. That is why the Dutch troops there remained of secondary importance, in operational and logistic terms, for so long; and why the importance of the enclave in the battle for domination between the Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Muslims failed to be recognised for so long".&lt;ref name="cnj.it2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnj.it/documentazione/Srebrenica/NIOD/NIOD%20Part%20II.pdf |title=Srebrenica – a 'safe' area |publisher=NIOD |date=2011 |accessdate=21 July 2015 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Srebrenica "safe area" ===
[[File:Bosnia areas of control Sep 94.jpg|thumb|Areas of control in Bosnia and Herzegovina in September 1994; eastern Bosnian enclaves near the Serbian border]]

==== April 1993: the Security Council declares Srebrenica a "safe area" ====
On 16 April 1993, the [[United Nations Security Council]] passed [[Resolution 819]], which demanded that: "all parties and others concerned treat Srebrenica and its surroundings as a [[safe area (Bosnian War)|safe area]] which should be free from any armed attack or any other hostile act".&lt;ref name="UN2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://undocs.org/S/RES/819(1993)|id=S/RES/819(1993)|title=Resolution 819|publisher=United Nations|date=16 April 1993|at=para. No. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 April 1993, the first group of UNPROFOR troops arrived in Srebrenica. On 8 May 1993 agreement was reached of demilitarization of Srebrenica. According to UN reports "General [Sefer] Halilović and General [Ratko] Mladić agreed on measures covering the whole of the Srebrenica enclave and the adjacent enclave of Žepa. Under the terms of the new agreement, Bosniak forces within the enclave would hand over their weapons, ammunition and mines to UNPROFOR, after which Serb "heavy weapons and units that constituted a menace to the demilitarised zones which will have been established in Žepa and Srebrenica will be withdrawn." Unlike the earlier agreement, the agreement of 8 May stated specifically that Srebrenica was to be considered a "demilitarised zone", as referred to in article 60 of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I)."

Between 1,000 and 2,000 soldiers from three of the VRS Drina Corps [[Brigade]]s were deployed around the enclave, equipped with tanks, armoured vehicles, artillery and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]]. The 28th Mountain Division of the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (ARBiH) remaining in the enclave was neither well organised nor equipped: a firm command structure and communications system was lacking and some soldiers carried old hunting rifles or no weapons at all. Few had proper uniforms.

From the outset, both parties to the conflict violated the "safe area" agreement. [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] [[Thomas Karremans]] (the [[Dutchbat]] Commander) testified to the ICTY that his personnel were prevented from returning to the enclave by Serb forces and that equipment and ammunition were also prevented from getting in.&lt;ref name="ICTY"&gt;ICTY, ''[http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/acjug/en/krs-aj040419e.pdf Prosecutor vs. Kristic, Judgement]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Bosniaks in Srebrenica complained of attacks by Serb soldiers, while to the Serbs it appeared that Bosnian government forces in Srebrenica were using the "safe area" as a convenient base from which to launch counter-offensives against the Army of the Republika Srpska (VRS) and that UNPROFOR was failing to take any action to prevent it.&lt;ref name="ICTY" /&gt; General [[Sefer Halilović]] admitted that ARBiH helicopters had flown in violation of the no-fly zone and that he had personally dispatched eight helicopters with ammunition for the 28th Division.

==== United Nations failure to demilitarise Srebrenica ====
A Security Council mission led by [[Diego Arria]] arrived in Srebrenica on 25 April 1993 and, in their subsequent report to the U.N., condemned the Serbs for perpetrating "a slow-motion process of genocide."&lt;ref name="UN report"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Secretary-General pursuant to General Assembly resolution 53/35 — The fall of Srebrenica|url=https://undocs.org/A/54/549|website=undocs.org|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=15 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission then stated that "Serb forces must withdraw to points from which they cannot attack, harass or terrorise the town. UNPROFOR should be in a position to determine the related parameters. The mission believes, as does UNPROFOR, that the actual 4.5&amp;nbsp;km by 0.5&amp;nbsp;km decided as a safe area should be greatly expanded." Specific instructions from United Nations Headquarters in New York stated that UNPROFOR should not be too zealous in searching for Bosniak weapons and, later, that the Serbs should withdraw their heavy weapons before the Bosniaks gave up their weapons. The Serbs never did withdraw their heavy weapons.&lt;ref name="UN report" /&gt;

Multiple attempts to demilitarise the ARBiH and force the withdrawal of the VRS proved futile. The ARBiH hid the majority of their heavy weapons, modern equipment and ammunition in the surrounding forest and only handed over disused and old weaponry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Netherlands Institute of War Documentation|title=Srebrenica: "a safe area" Part 2 Dutchbat in the enclave|url=http://www.cnj.it/documentazione/Srebrenica/NIOD/NIOD%20Part%20II.pdf|date=17 January 2005|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, given the failure to disarm the ARBiH, the VRS refused to withdraw from the front lines given the intelligence they had regarding hidden weaponry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Netherlands Institute of War Documentation|title=Srebrenica: "a safe area" Part 2 Dutchbat in the enclave|url=http://www.cnj.it/documentazione/Srebrenica/NIOD/NIOD%20Part%20II.pdf|date=17 January 2005|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Early 1995: the situation in the Srebrenica "safe area" deteriorates ====
By early 1995, fewer and fewer supply convoys were making it through to the enclave. The situation in Srebrenica and in other enclaves had deteriorated into lawless violence as prostitution among young Muslim girls, theft and black marketeering proliferated.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ramet|Ramet (2006)]], p. 443&lt;/ref&gt; The already meager resources of the civilian population dwindled further and even the UN forces started running dangerously low on food, medicine, ammunition and fuel, eventually being forced to start patrolling the enclave on foot. Dutchbat soldiers who went out of the area on leave were not allowed to return&lt;ref name="UN report" /&gt; and their number dropped from 600{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} to 400 men. In March and April, the Dutch soldiers noticed a build-up of Serb forces near two of the observation posts, "OP Romeo" and "OP Quebec".

In March 1995, [[Radovan Karadžić]], President of the Republika Srpska (RS), despite pressure from the international community to end the war and ongoing efforts to negotiate a peace agreement, issued a directive to the VRS concerning the long-term strategy of the VRS forces in the enclave. The directive, known as "Directive 7", specified that the VRS was to:

{{quote|complete the physical separation of Srebrenica from Žepa as soon as possible, preventing even communication between individuals in the two enclaves. By planned and well-thought-out combat operations, create an unbearable situation of total insecurity with no hope of further survival or life for the inhabitants of Srebrenica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/acjug/en/krs-aj040419e.pdf#page=33|title=Prosecutor vs Krstic, Appeals Chamber Judgement|publisher=ICTY|date=19 April 2004|accessdate=25 April 2017|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By mid-1995, the humanitarian situation of the Bosniak civilians and military personnel in the enclave was catastrophic. In May, following orders, Orić and his staff left the enclave by helicopter to [[Tuzla]], leaving senior officers in command of the 28th Division. In late June and early July, the 28th Division issued a series of reports including urgent pleas for the [[humanitarian corridor]] to the enclave to be reopened. When this failed, Bosniak civilians began dying from starvation. On Friday, 7 July the mayor of Srebrenica reported 8 residents had died of starvation.&lt;ref&gt;BALKAN WATCH The Balkan Institute 10 July 1995 A Weekly Review of Current Events Volume 2.26 Week in Review 3–9 July 1995 [http://www.hri.org/cgi-bin/brief?/news/misc/misc-news/1995/95-07-11_1.misc.txt]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the weeks leading up to the assault on Srebrenica by the [[Army of Republika Srpska|VRS]], ARBiH forces were ordered to carry out diversion and disruption attacks on the VRS by high command.{{sfn|Ingrao|2012|p=218}} On one particular occasion on the evening of 25–26 June, ARBiH forces attacked VRS units on the [[Sarajevo]]-[[Zvornik]] road inflicting high casualties and looting VRS stockpiles.{{sfn|Ingrao|2012|p=218}} These continued attacks promoted a response from Mladić who in turn, contacted the UN headquarters in Sarajevo and advised that he would no longer tolerate ARBiH incursions into the Bosnian Serb countryside.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=179}}

==== 4 June and 6–11 July 1995: Serb take-over of Srebrenica ====
{{main|Operation Krivaja '95}}

On 4 June 1995, UNPROFOR commander [[Bernard Janvier]], a Frenchman, secretly met with Ratko Mladić to obtain the release of hostages, many of whom were French. Mladić demanded of Janvier that there would be no more air strikes.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The Serb offensive against Srebrenica began in earnest on 6 July 1995. The [[Army of Republika Srpska|VRS]] numbering 2,000 soldiers were outnumbered by the defenders and did not expect the assault to be an easy conquest.{{sfn|Ingrao|2012|p=218}}  In the following days, the five UNPROFOR observation posts in the southern part of the enclave fell one by one in the face of the Bosnian Serb advance. Some of the Dutch soldiers retreated into the enclave after their posts were attacked, but the crews of the other observation posts surrendered into Serb [[police custody|custody]]. Simultaneously, the defending Bosnian forces numbering 6,000 came under heavy fire and were pushed back towards the town. Once the southern perimeter began to collapse, about 4,000 Bosniak residents who had been living in a Swedish housing complex for refugees nearby fled north into the town of Srebrenica. Dutch soldiers reported that the advancing Serbs were "cleansing" the houses in the southern part of the enclave.&lt;ref name="Krstic 2001 takeover"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/tjug/en/krs-tj010802e.pdf#page=16 |title=Krstic Judgement |at=Part II.

 [[File:Pantserrupsvoertuig YPR-765.jpg|thumb|A Dutch YPR-765 as used at Srebrenica]]
On 8 July, a Dutch [[AIFV|YPR-765]] armoured vehicle took fire from the Serbs and withdrew. A group of Bosniaks demanded that the armoured vehicle stay to defend them, and established a makeshift barricade to prevent its retreat. As the armoured vehicle continued to withdraw, a Bosniak farmer who was manning the barricade threw a hand grenade onto it and subsequently killed Dutch soldier Raviv van Renssen.&lt;ref name="LeBor2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=LeBor|first1=Adam|title="Complicity with Evil": The United Nations in the Age of Modern Genocide|date=1 October 2008|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300135149|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Late on 9 July 1995, emboldened by early successes and little resistance from the largely demilitarised Bosniaks as well as the absence of any significant reaction from the international community, the President of the Republika Srpska, Radovan Karadžić, issued a new order authorising the 1,500-strong&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/Bosnia/updates/july95/7-11/index4.html|title=1,500 Bosnian Serb troops overran the enclave of Srebrenica |date=11 July 1995 |accessdate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; VRS Drina Corps to capture the town of Srebrenica.&lt;ref name="Krstic 2001 takeover"/&gt;

The following morning (10 July 1995), Lieutenant-Colonel Karremans made urgent requests for air support from [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) to defend Srebrenica as crowds filled the streets, some of whom carried weapons. VRS tanks were approaching the town, and NATO airstrikes on these began on the afternoon of 11 July 1995. NATO bombers attempted to attack VRS artillery locations outside the town but poor visibility forced NATO to cancel this operation.

Late in the afternoon of 11 July, General Mladić, accompanied by General Živanović (then-Commander of the Drina Corps), General Krstić (then-Deputy Commander and Chief of Staff of the Drina Corps) and other VRS officers, took a triumphant walk through the deserted streets of the town of Srebrenica.&lt;ref name="Krstic 2001 takeover"/&gt;

== Massacre ==

The two highest ranking Serb politicians from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Karadžić and [[Momčilo Krajišnik]], both indicted for genocide, were warned by military commander General Mladić (found guilty of genocide at a UN Tribunal in November 2017) that their plans could not be realised without committing genocide. Mladić said:

{{quote|People are not little stones, or keys in someone's pocket, that can be moved from one place to another just like that.... Therefore, we cannot precisely arrange for only Serbs to stay in one part of the country while removing others painlessly. I do not know how Mr. Krajišnik and Mr. Karadžić will explain that to the world. That is genocide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bosnia.org.uk/news/news_body.cfm?newsid=2229 Bosnia's Accidental Genocide], Bosnian Institute in UK. 30 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Increasing concentration of refugees in Potočari ===

The building was a disused battery factory]] 
By the evening of 11 July 1995, approximately 20,000 to 25,000 Bosniak refugees from Srebrenica were gathered in Potočari, seeking protection within the [[UNPROFOR]] Dutchbat headquarters. Several thousand had pressed inside the compound itself, while the rest were spread throughout the neighbouring factories and fields. Although the vast majority were women, children, elderly or disabled, 63 witnesses estimated that there were at least 300 men inside the perimeter of the UNPROFOR compound and between 600 and 900 men in the crowd outside.&lt;ref name="ICTY" /&gt; UNPROFOR Dutchbat soldiers [on site] claimed{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} their base was full.

Conditions in Potočari included "little food or water available" and sweltering heat. One UNPROFOR Dutchbat officer described the scene as follows:

{{quote|They were panicked, they were scared, and they were pressing each other against the soldiers, my soldiers, the UN soldiers that tried to calm them. People that fell were trampled on. It was a chaotic situation.&lt;ref name="ICTY" /&gt;}}

On 12 July, the United Nations Security Council, in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1004|Resolution 1004]], expressed concern at the humanitarian situation in Potočari, which also condemned the offensive by Bosnian Serb forces and demanded immediate withdrawal.

On 13 July, the Dutch forces expelled five Bosniak refugees from the United Nations compound despite knowing that men outside the compound were being killed and abused.&lt;ref name="NYT9613"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dutch Peacekeepers Are Found Responsible for Deaths|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/07/world/europe/dutch-peacekeepers-are-found-responsible-for-deaths.html|accessdate=7 September 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=6 September 2013|author=Marlise Simons|quote=Dutchbat soldiers knew that outside the compound men were being killed and abused, the court summary said, but the soldiers decided not to evacuate most refugees, including the three men, along with the battalion and instead sent them away on 13 July.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crimes committed in Potočari ===

On 12 July 1995, as the day wore on, the refugees in the compound could see VRS soldiers setting houses and haystacks on fire. Throughout the afternoon, Serb soldiers mingled in the crowd and [[summary executions]] of men occurred.&lt;ref name="ICTY" /&gt; In the late morning of 12 July 1995 a witness saw a pile of 20 to 30 bodies heaped up behind the Transport Building in Potočari, alongside a tractor-like machine. Another testified that he saw a soldier slay a child with a knife in the middle of a crowd of expellees. He also said that he saw Serb soldiers execute more than a hundred Bosnian Muslim men in the area behind the Zinc Factory and then load their bodies onto a truck, although the number and nature of the murders stand in contrast to other evidence on the Trial Record which indicates that the killings in Potočari were sporadic in nature. Soldiers were picking people out of the crowd and taking them away. A witness recounted how three brothers—one merely a child and the others in their teens—were taken out in the night. When the boys' mother went looking for them, she found them stark naked and with their throats slit.&lt;ref name="ICTY" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Krstic 2001 Potočari"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/tjug/en/krs-tj010802e.pdf#page=18 |title=Krstic Judgement |at=Part II.

That night, a Dutchbat medical orderly witnessed two Serb soldiers raping a young woman.&lt;ref name="Krstic 2001 Potočari"/&gt;

One survivor described the murder of a baby and the rape of women occurring in the close vicinity of Dutch U.N. peacekeepers who did nothing to prevent it. According to the survivor, a Serb told a mother to make her child stop crying, and when it continued to cry he took it and slit its throat, after which he laughed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,486755,00.html Srebrenica Massacre Survivors Sue Netherlands, United Nations]—By Udo Ludwig and Ansgar Mertin.

One of the survivors, Zarfa Turkovic, described the horrors of rapes as follows: "Two [Serb soldiers] took her legs and raised them up in the air, while the third began raping her.

=== Separation and murder of Bosniak men and boys in Potočari ===
From the morning of 12 July, Serb forces began gathering men and boys from the refugee population in Potočari and holding them in separate locations, and as the refugees began boarding the buses headed north towards Bosniak-held territory, Serb soldiers separated out men of military age who were trying to clamber aboard. Occasionally, younger and older men were stopped as well (some as young as 14 or 15).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/trans/en/000726ed.htm |title=Separation of boys, Krstic ICTY Potocari |publisher=Icty.org |date=26 July 2000 |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/popovic/trans/en/070206ED.htm |title=Separation, Popovic ICTY |publisher=Icty.org |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/trans/en/000411ed.htm |title=Separation, Krstic ICTY |publisher=Icty.org |date=11 July 1995 |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These men were taken to a building in Potočari referred to as the "White House". As early as the evening of 12 July 1995, Major Franken of the Dutchbat heard that no men were arriving with the women and children at their destination in [[Kladanj]].&lt;ref name="ICTY" /&gt; At this time, the UNHCR Director of Operations, Peter Walsh, was dispatched to Srebrenica by the UNHCR Chief of Mission, Damaso Feci, to evaluate what emergency aid could be provided rapidly. Peter Walsh and his team arrived at Gostilj, just outside Srebrenica, in the early afternoon only to be turned away by VRS forces. Despite claiming freedom of movement rights, the UNHCR team was not allowed to proceed and was forced to head back north to Bijelina. Throughout this time, Peter Walsh relayed reports back to UNHCR in Zagreb about the unfolding situation including witnessing the enforced movement and abuse of Muslim men and boys and the sound of summary executions taking place.

On 13 July 1995, Dutchbat troops witnessed definite signs that the Serb soldiers were murdering some of the Bosniak men who had been separated. For example, Corporal Vaasen saw two soldiers take a man behind the "White House", heard a shot and saw the two soldiers reappear alone. Another Dutchbat officer saw Serb soldiers murder an unarmed man with a single gunshot to the head and heard gunshots 20–40 times an hour throughout the afternoon. When the Dutchbat soldiers told Colonel Joseph Kingori, a [[United Nations Military Observer]] (UNMO) in the Srebrenica area, that men were being taken behind the "White House" and not coming back, Colonel Kingori went to investigate. He heard gunshots as he approached, but was stopped by Serb soldiers before he could find out what was going on.&lt;ref name="ICTY" /&gt;

Some of the executions were carried out at night under arc lights, and bulldozers then pushed the bodies into mass graves.&lt;ref name="CNN-2006-05-03"&gt;Graham Jones. [http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/02/22/warcrimes.srebrenica/ Srebrenica: A Triumph of Evil], CNN 3 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; According to evidence collected from Bosniaks by French policeman Jean-René Ruez, some were buried alive; he also heard testimony describing Serb forces killing and torturing refugees at will, streets littered with corpses, people committing suicide to avoid having their noses, lips and ears chopped off, and adults being forced to watch the soldiers kill their children.&lt;ref name="CNN-2006-05-03" /&gt;

==== Rape and abuse of civilians ====
Thousands of women and girls suffered rape and sexual abuse and other forms of torture. According to the testimony of Zumra Šehomerovic:

{{quote|The Serbs began at a certain point to take girls and young women out of the group of refugees. They were raped. The rapes often took place under the eyes of others and sometimes even under the eyes of the children of the mother. A Dutch soldier stood by and he simply looked around with a [[Walkman]] on his head. He did not react at all to what was happening. It did not happen just before my eyes, for I saw that personally, but also before the eyes of us all. The Dutch soldiers walked around everywhere. It is impossible that they did not see it.

There was a woman with a small baby a few months old. A [[Chetnik]] told the mother that the child must stop crying. When the child did not stop crying, he snatched the child away and cut its throat. Then he laughed. There was a Dutch soldier there who was watching. He did not react at all.

I saw yet more frightful things. For example, there was a girl, she must have been about nine years old. At a certain moment some Chetniks recommended to her brother that he rape the girl. He did not do it and I also think that he could not have done it for he was still just a child. Then they murdered that young boy. I have personally seen all that. I really want to emphasize that all this happened in the immediate vicinity of the base. In the same way I also saw other people who were murdered. Some of them had their throats cut. Others were [[behead]]ed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legal-tools.org/en/doc/ca1e99/|website=legal-tools.org|author=Van Diepen Van der Kroef Advocaten|title=Writ of Summons: District Court, The Hague|date=4 June 2007|pages=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Testimony of Ramiza Gurdić:

{{quote|I saw how a young boy of about ten was killed by Serbs in Dutch uniform. This happened in front of my own eyes. The mother sat on the ground and her young son sat beside her. The young boy was placed on his mother's lap. The young boy was killed. His head was cut off. The body remained on the lap of the mother. The Serbian soldier placed the head of the young boy on his knife and showed it to everyone. … I saw how a pregnant woman was slaughtered. There were Serbs who stabbed her in the stomach, cut her open and took two small children out of her stomach and then beat them to death on the ground. I saw this with my own eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legal-tools.org/en/doc/ca1e99/|website=legal-tools.org|author=Van Diepen Van der Kroef Advocaten|title=Writ of Summons: District Court, The Hague|date=4 June 2007|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Testimony of Kada Hotić:

{{quote|There was a young woman with a baby on the way to the bus. The baby cried and a Serbian soldier told her that she had to make sure that the baby was quiet. Then the soldier took the child from the mother and cut its throat. I do not know whether Dutchbat soldiers saw that. … There was a sort of fence on the left-hand side of the road to Potocari. I heard then a young woman screaming very close by (4 or 5 meters away). I then heard another woman beg: "Leave her, she is only nine years old." The screaming suddenly stopped. I was so in shock that I could scarcely move. … The rumour later quickly circulated that a nine year old girl had been raped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legal-tools.org/en/doc/ca1e99/|website=legal-tools.org|author=Van Diepen Van der Kroef Advocaten|title=Writ of Summons: District Court, The Hague|date=4 June 2007|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

That night, a DutchBat medical orderly came across two Serb soldiers raping a young woman:

{{quote|[W]e saw two Serb soldiers, one of them was standing guard and the other one was lying on the girl, with his pants off. And we saw a girl lying on the ground, on some kind of mattress. There was blood on the mattress, even she was covered with blood. She had bruises on her legs. There was even blood coming down her legs. She was in total shock. She went totally crazy.

Bosnian Muslim refugees nearby could see the rape, but could do nothing about it because of Serb soldiers standing nearby. Other people heard women screaming, or saw women being dragged away. Several individuals were so terrified that they committed suicide by hanging themselves. Throughout the night and early the next morning, stories about the rapes and killings spread through the crowd and the terror in the camp escalated.

Screams, gunshots and other frightening noises were audible throughout the night and no one could sleep. Soldiers were picking people out of the crowd and taking them away: some returned; others did not. Witness T recounted how three brothers—one merely a child and the others in their teens—were taken out in the night. When the boys' mother went looking for them, she found them with their throats slit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org |title=Radislav Krstic Trial Chambers Judgement |publisher=Icty.org |date=5 March 2007 |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==== Deportation of women ====
As a result of exhaustive UN negotiations with Serb troops, around 25,000 Srebrenica women were forcibly transferred to the Bosniak-controlled territory.

Some buses apparently never reached safety. According to a witness account given by Kadir Habibović, who hid himself on one of the first buses from the base in Potočari to Kladanj, he saw at least one vehicle full of Bosniak women being driven away from Bosnian government-held territory.&lt;ref name="Rhode"&gt;{{cite|last1=Rohde |first1=David|title=Account of Women Taken|publisher=Columbia University|date=2 October 1995|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/journalism/nelson/rohde/p-1025.html|access-date=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Column of Bosniak men ===
On the evening of 11 July 1995, word spread through the Bosniak community that able-bodied men should take to the woods, form a [[column (formation)|column]] together with members of the ARBiH's 28th Division and attempt a breakthrough towards Bosnian government-held territory in the north.&lt;ref name="ICTY: Radislav Krstić verdict – The Column of Bosnian Muslim Men"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/krs-tj010802e-1.htm#IIA7b |title=ICTY: Radislav Krstić verdict – The Column of Bosnian Muslim Men |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105091809/http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/krs-tj010802e-1.htm |archivedate=5 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The men believed they stood a better chance of surviving by trying to escape than if they let themselves fall into Serb hands.&lt;ref&gt;Witness P-104 evidence to the Blagojevic trial, ICTY Case IT-06-60-T, Trial Chamber Judgment, 17 January 2005, Footnote 460, p. 52 [http://www.icty.org/x/cases/blagojevic_jokic/tjug/en/bla-050117e.pdf].

Around 10&amp;nbsp;pm on 11 July the Division command, together with the municipal authorities, took the decision, on their own initiative, to form a column and leave the safe area in an attempt to reach government-controlled territory around Tuzla.&lt;ref name="icty.org"&gt;Enver Hadzihasanovic evidence to the Krstic trial, 6 April 2001, ICTY transcript p 9528 [http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/trans/en/010406ed.htm]. Retrieved 7 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
Dehydration made finding drinking water a major problem, along with lack of sleep and physical exhaustion—many were exhausted before setting out. There was little cohesion or sense of common purpose in the column.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/popovic/trans/en/081027ED.htm|title=081027ED|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along the way, the column was shelled and ambushed.

Retrieved 24 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Others were collected together before being taken to remote locations for mass execution.

The attacks on the column broke it up into smaller segments. Only about one third of the men succeeded in crossing the asphalt road between [[Konjević Polje]] and [[Nova Kasaba]]. It was this group that eventually crossed Bosnian Serb lines to reach Bosnian government territory on and after 16 July. The vast majority of the victims of the massacre were members of the column who failed to complete the perilous journey.

==== Other groups ====
A second, smaller group of refugees (estimated at between 700 and 800) attempted to escape into Serbia via Mount Kvarac via Bratunac, or across the river [[Drina]] and via [[Bajina Bašta]]. It is not known how many were intercepted, arrested and killed on the way. A third group headed for Žepa, possibly having first tried to reach Tuzla. The estimates of the numbers involved vary widely, from 300 to around 850. In addition, small pockets of resistance apparently remained behind and engaged Serb forces.

==== Tuzla column departs ====
Almost all the 28th Division, 5500 to 6000 soldiers, not all armed, gathered in the village of Susnjari, in the hills north of the town of Srebrenica, along with about 7,000 civilians.

At around midnight on 11 July 1995, the column started moving along the axis between Konjević Polje and Bratunac. The main column was preceded by a reconnaissance party of four scouts, approximately five kilometres ahead.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Members of the column walked one behind the other, following the paper trail laid down by a de-mining unit.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1083"&gt;Mevludin Orić evidence to the Popovic et al trial, 31 August 2006, ICTY transcript pp 1083 &amp; 1084 [http://www.icty.org/x/cases/popovic/trans/en/060831ED.htm]. Retrieved 7 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The column was led by a group of 50–100 of the best soldiers from each brigade, carrying the best available equipment. Elements of the 284th Brigade were followed by the 280th Brigade, with them the Chief of Staff Ramiz Bećirović. Civilians accompanied by other soldiers followed and at the back was the independent battalion which was part of the 28th Division.&lt;ref name="icty.org" /&gt; The elite of the enclave, including the mother and sister of Naser Orić{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}, accompanied the best troops at the front of the column.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1083" /&gt; Others in the column included the political leaders of the enclave, medical staff of the local hospital and the families of prominent persons in Srebrenica.

The column was between 12 and 15 kilometres long, about two and a half hours separating head from tail.&lt;ref name="icty.org" /&gt;

The breakout from the enclave and the attempt to reach Tuzla came as a surprise to the VRS and caused considerable confusion, as the VRS had expected the men to go to Potočari.

During the night, poor visibility, fear of mines and panic induced by artillery fire split the column in two.&lt;ref name="trial-ch.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trial-ch.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/trialwatch/Srebrenica_Report2004.pdf#page=15|page=15|title=The Events in and Around Srebrenica Between 10th and 19th July 1995|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223001/http://trial-ch.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/trialwatch/Srebrenica_Report2004.pdf#page=15|archive-date=3 March 2016|date=11 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the afternoon of 12 July, the front section emerged from the woods and crossed the asphalt road from Konjevic Polje and Nova Kasaba. Around 18.00 hours, the RS Army located the main part of the column still in the hilly area around Kamenica (outside the village of [[Pobuđe]]). Around 20.00 hours this part of the column, led by the municipal authorities and the wounded, started descending Kamenica Hill ({{Coord|44|19|53|N|18|14|5|E|type:mountain|name=Karmenica}}) towards the road. After a few dozen men had crossed, soldiers of the RS Army arrived from the direction of [[Kravica]] in trucks and armoured vehicles including a white vehicle with UNPROFOR symbols, calling out for Bosniaks over the loudspeaker to surrender.&lt;ref name="trial-ch.org" /&gt;

It was around this time that yellow smoke was observed, followed by observations of strange behaviour, including suicides, hallucinations and members of the column attacking one another.&lt;ref name="Popovic 2006" /&gt; Numerous survivors interviewed by Human Rights Watch claimed they were attacked with a chemical agent that caused hallucinations and disorientation.&lt;ref name="commdocs.house.gov" /&gt;&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk" /&gt; (Gen.

Heavy shooting and shelling began, which continued into the night. The armed members of the column returned fire and all scattered. Survivors describe a group of at least 1000 engaged at close range by small arms. Hundreds appear to have been killed as they fled the open area and some were said to have killed themselves to escape capture.

RS Army and Ministry of Interior persuaded members of the column to surrender by promising them protection and safe transportation towards Tuzla under UNPROFOR and Red Cross supervision. Appropriated UN and Red Cross equipment was used to deceive the refugees into believing the promises. Surrendering prisoners' personal belongings were confiscated and some were executed on the spot.&lt;ref name="trial-ch.org" /&gt;

The rear of the column lost contact with the front and panic broke out. Many people remained in the Kamenica Hill area for a number of days, unable to move on with the escape route blocked by Serb forces. Thousands of Bosniaks surrendered or were captured. Some prisoners were ordered to summon friends and family members from the woods. There were reports of Serb forces using megaphones to call on the marchers to surrender, telling them that they would be exchanged for Serb soldiers held captive by Bosniak forces. It was at Kamenica that VRS personnel in civilian dress were reported to have infiltrated the column.

Men from the rear of the column who survived this ordeal described it as a manhunt.&lt;ref name="ICTY: Radislav Krstić verdict – The Column of Bosnian Muslim Men" /&gt;

==== Sandići massacre ====
[[File:Exhumations in Srebrenica 1996.jpg|thumb|[[Exhumation]]s in Srebrenica, 1996]]

Close to Sandići, on the main road from Bratunac to Konjević Polje, one witness describes the Serbs forcing a Bosniak man to call other Bosniaks down from the mountains. Some 200 to 300 men, including the witness' brother, followed his instructions and descended to meet the VRS, presumably expecting some exchange of prisoners would take place. The witness hid behind a tree to see what would happen next. He watched as the men were lined up in seven ranks, each some forty metres in length, with their hands behind their heads; they were then mowed down by machine gun fire.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3665"&gt;Witness PW-139 evidence to the Popovic et al trial, 6 November 2006, ICTY transcript pp3665-3666 [http://www.icty.org/x/cases/popovic/trans/en/061106ED.htm]. Retrieved 11 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A small number of women, children and elderly people who had been part of the column were allowed to join the buses evacuating the women and children out of Potočari. Among them was Alma Delimustafić, a soldier of the 28th Brigade; at this time, Delimustafić was in her civilian clothes and was released.&lt;ref&gt;ABiH Tuzla. Tuzla (Intel Dept) to 2nd Corps, 25/07/95, (Tuzla no.) 11.6.-1-414/95 (2nd Corps no.) 06-712-24-30/95, Results of meeting with persons from Srebrenica. This report was signed by Sarajlic Osman.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Trek to Mount Udrc ====
The central section of the column managed to escape the shooting and reached Kamenica at about 11.00 hours and waited there for the wounded. [[Captain (land)|Captain]] Ejub Golić and the Independent Battalion turned back towards Hajdučko Groblje to help the casualties. A number of survivors from the rear, who managed to escape crossed the asphalt roads to the north or the west of the area, had joined those in the central section of the column. The front third of the column, which had already left Kamenica Hill by the time the ambush occurred, headed for Mount Udrc ({{Coord|44|16|59|N|19|3|6|E|type:mountain|name=Mount Udrc}}); crossing the main asphalt road, they then forded the river Jadar. They reached the base of the mountain early on the morning of Thursday, 13 July and regrouped. At first, it was decided to send 300 ARBiH soldiers back in an attempt to break through the blockades. When reports came in that the central section of the column had nevertheless succeeded in crossing the road at Konjević Polje, this plan was abandoned. Approximately 1,000 additional men managed to reach Udrc that night.&lt;ref&gt;ABiH Tuzla. ABiH 2nd Corps (unnumbered). Additional statement by Ramiz Becirovic, 16/04/98, based on an earlier statement of 11/08/95.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Snagovo ambush ====
From Udrc the marchers moved toward the River Drinjača and on to Mount Velja Glava, continuing through the night. Finding a Serb presence at Mount Velja Glava, where they arrived on Friday, 14 July the column was forced to skirt the mountain and wait on its slopes before it was able to move on toward [[Liplje, Zvornik|Liplje]] and Marcici. Arriving at Marcici in the evening of 14 July the marchers were again ambushed near Snagovo by Serb forces equipped with anti-aircraft guns, artillery, and tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trial-ch.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/trialwatch/Srebrenica_Report2004.pdf#page=17|page=17|title=The Events in and Around Srebrenica Between 10th and 19th July 1995|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223001/http://trial-ch.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/trialwatch/Srebrenica_Report2004.pdf#page=17|archive-date=3 March 2016|date=11 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lieutenant Džemail Bećirović, the column managed to break through the ambush and, in so doing, captured a VRS officer, Major Zoran Janković—providing the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina with a significant bargaining counter. This prompted an attempt at negotiating a cessation in the fighting, but negotiations with local Serb forces failed.&lt;ref&gt;Zoran Jankovic evidence to the Popovic et al trial, 27 October 2008, ICTY transcript p 27369 [http://www.icty.org/x/cases/popovic/trans/en/081027ED.htm]. Retrieved 13 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the act of repulsing the ambush had a positive effect on morale of the marchers, who also captured an amount of weapons and supplies. {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

==== Approaching the frontline ====
The evening of 15 July saw the first radio contact between the 2nd Corps and the 28th Division, established using a [[walkie-talkie]] captured from the VRS. After initial distrust on the part of the 28th Division, the brothers Šabić were able to identify each other as they stood on either side of the VRS lines. Early in the morning, the column crossed the asphalt road linking Zvornik with Caparde and headed in the direction of Planinci, leaving a unit of some 100 to 200 armed marchers behind to wait for stragglers. {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

The column reached Krizevici later that day, and remained there while an attempt was made to negotiate with local Serb forces for safe passage through the Serb lines into Bosnian government controlled territory. The members of the column were advised to stay where they were, and to allow the Serb forces time to arrange for safe passage. It soon became apparent, though, that the small Serb force deployed in the area was only trying to gain time to organise a further attack on the marchers. In the area of Marcici-Crni the RS armed forces deployed 500 soldiers and policemen in order to stop the split part of the column (about 2,500 people), which was moving from Glodi towards Marcici. {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

At this point, the column's leaders decided to form several small groups of between 100 and 200 persons and send these to reconnoiter the way ahead. Early in the afternoon, the 2nd Corps and the 28th Division of the ARBiH met each other in the village of Potocani. The presidium of Srebrenica were the first to reach Bosnian terrain. {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

==== Breakthrough at Baljkovica ====
The hillside at Baljkovica ({{Coord|44|27|N|18|58|E|name=Baljkovica|type:city}}) formed the last VRS line separating the column from Bosnian-held territory. The VRS cordon actually consisted of two lines, the first of which presented a front on the Tuzla side against the 2nd Corps and the other a front against the approaching 28th Division.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

On the evening of 15 July a heavy hailstorm caused the Serb forces to take cover. The column's advance group took advantage of this to attack the Serb rear lines at Baljkovica. During the fighting, the main body of what remained of the column began to move from Krizevici. It reached the area of fighting at about 3&amp;nbsp;am on Sunday, 16 July.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

At approximately 05.00 hours on 16 July, the 2nd Corps made its first attempt to break through the VRS cordon from the Bosnian side. The objective was to force a breakthrough close to the hamlets of Parlog and Resnik. They were joined by Naser Orić and a number of his men. {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

Around 8&amp;nbsp;am on the morning of 16 July parts of the 28th Division, with the 2nd Corps of the RBiH Army from Tuzla providing artillery support, attacked and breached RS Army lines. There was fierce fighting across the general area of Baljkovica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trial-ch.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/trialwatch/Srebrenica_Report2004.pdf#page=21|page=21|title=The Events in and Around Srebrenica Between 10th and 19th July 1995|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223001/http://trial-ch.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/trialwatch/Srebrenica_Report2004.pdf#page=21|archive-date=3 March 2016|date=11 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captured heavy arms including two Praga [[self-propelled anti-aircraft]] guns were fired at the Serb front line and the column finally succeeded in breaking through to Bosnian government controlled territory and linking up with BiH units at between 1&amp;nbsp;pm and 2&amp;nbsp;pm on 16 July. {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

==== Baljkovica corridor ====
Following radio negotiations between the 2nd Corps and the Zvornik Brigade, the Zvornik Brigade Command, which had lost three lines of trenches, agreed to open a corridor to allow "evacuation" of the column in return for the release of captured policemen and soldiers. The Baljkovica corridor was open from 14.00 to 17.00 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trial-ch.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/trialwatch/Srebrenica_Report2004.pdf#page=21|pages=21–22|title=The Events in and Around Srebrenica Between 10th and 19th July 1995|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223001/http://trial-ch.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/trialwatch/Srebrenica_Report2004.pdf#page=21|archive-date=3 March 2016|date=11 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the corridor was closed between 17.00 and 18.00 hours the Zvornik Brigade Command reported that around 5000 civilians, with probably "a certain number of soldiers" with them had been let through, but "all those who passed were unarmed".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trial-ch.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/trialwatch/Srebrenica_Report2004.pdf|page=22|title=The Events in and Around Srebrenica Between 10th and 19th July 1995|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223001/http://trial-ch.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/trialwatch/Srebrenica_Report2004.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2016|date=11 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Arrival at Tuzla ====
[[File:Srebrenica 2008 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Damaged building in Srebrenica after the war]]

By 4 August or thereabouts, the ArBiH determined that 3,175 members of the 28th Division had managed to get through to Tuzla. 2,628 members of the Division, soldiers and officers, were considered certain to have been killed. The approximate number of individual members of the column killed was estimated at between 8,300 and 9,722.&lt;ref&gt;Enver Hadzihasanovic evidence to the Krstic trial, 6 April 2001, ICTY transcript p 9532 [http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/trans/en/010406ed.htm]. Retrieved 7 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== After the closure of the corridor ====
Once the corridor had closed Serb forces recommenced hunting down parts of the column still in areas under their control. Around 2,000 refugees were reported to be hiding in the woods in the area of Pobudje.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

On 17 July 1995, "searching the terrain", the RS Army captured a number of Bosniaks. Four children aged between 8 and 14 captured by the Bratunac Brigade were taken to the military barracks in Bratunac.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B&amp;J para.467"&gt;{{cite web|work=ICTY|title=Prosecutor v. Blagojević &amp; Jokić Trial Chamber Judgment|id=Case No. IT-02-60|at=para. 467|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/blagojevic_jokic/tjug/en/bla-050117e.pdf#page=181|date=17 January 2005|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When one of them described seeing a large number of ARBiH soldiers committing suicide and shooting at each other,{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} Brigade Commander Blagojević suggested that the Drina Corps' press unit should record this testimony on video.&lt;ref name="B&amp;J para.467"/&gt; The fate of the boys remains uncertain.

On 18 July, after a soldier was killed "trying to capture some persons during the search operation", the Zvornik Brigade Command issued an order to execute prisoners in its zone of
responsibility in order to avoid any risks associated with their capture. The order was presumed to have remained effective until it was countermanded on 21 July.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

====Mass hysteria====
According to a 1998 [[Qualitative research|qualitative study]] involving survivors of the column, many of the members of the column exhibited symptoms of hallucinations to varying degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hay|first=Alastair|title=Surviving the Impossible: The Long March from Srebrenica. An Investigation of the Possible Use of Chemical Warfare Agents|issue=14|DOI=10.1080/13623699808409383|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a number of occasions, Bosniak men began attacking one another in an apparent fear that the other member in the column was a Serb soldier. Members of the column also reported seeing people speaking gibberish, running towards VRS lines in a fit of rage and also, men committing suicide using firearms and hand grenades. Although there was no evidence to suggest what exactly caused the mass hallucinations, the study suggested that fatigue and stress may have induced these symptoms.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Plan to execute the men of Srebrenica ===

Although Serb forces had long been blamed for the massacre, it was not until June 2004—following the Srebrenica commission's preliminary report—that Serb officials acknowledged that their security forces planned and carried out the mass killing. A Serb commission's final report on the 1995 Srebrenica massacre acknowledged that the [[mass murder]] of the men and boys was planned. The commission found that more than 7,800 were killed after it compiled thirty-four{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} lists of victims.

A concerted effort was made to capture all Bosniak men of military age.&lt;ref name=unKrsticV&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/tjug/en/krs-tj010802e.pdf#page=32 |title=Krstic Judgement |at=Part II. FINDINGS OF FACT – A. THE TAKE-OVER OF SREBRENICA AND ITS AFTERMATH – 11. A Plan to Execute the Bosnian Muslim Men of Srebrenica |date=2 August 2001 |publisher=ICTY }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, those captured included many boys well below that age and elderly men several years above that age who remained in the enclave following the take-over of Srebrenica. These men and boys were targeted regardless of whether they chose to flee to Potočari or to join the Bosnian Muslim column. The operation to capture and detain the Bosnian Muslim men was well organised and comprehensive. The buses which transported the women and children were systematically searched for men.&lt;ref name=unKrsticV/&gt;

=== Mass executions ===

The vast amount of planning and high-level coordination invested in killing thousands of men in a few days is apparent from the scale and the methodical nature in which the executions were carried out. A concerted effort was made to capture all Bosniak men of military age. In fact, those
captured included many boys well below that age and elderly men above it.&lt;ref name=unKrsticV/&gt;

The [[Army of Republika Srpska]] took the largest number of prisoners on 13 July, along the Bratunac-Konjević Polje road. It remains impossible to cite a precise figure, but witness statements describe the assembly points such as the field at Sandići, the agricultural [[warehouses]] in Kravica, the school in Konjević Polje, the [[Association football pitch|football field]] in Nova Kasaba, the village of Lolići and the village school of Luke. Several thousands of people were herded together in the field near Sandići and on the Nova Kasaba football pitch, where they were searched and put into smaller groups. In a video tape made by journalist Zoran Petrović, a Serb soldier states that at least 3,000 to 4,000 men had given themselves up on the road. By the late afternoon of 13 July, the total had risen to some 6,000 according to the intercepted radio communication; the following day, Major Franken of Dutchbat was given the same figure by Colonel Radislav Janković of the Serb army. Many of the prisoners had been seen in the locations described by passing convoys taking the women and children to Kladanj by bus, while various aerial photographs have since provided evidence to confirm this version of events.&lt;ref name="Neth-WarDocs"/&gt;&lt;ref name=unKrsticV/&gt;

One hour after the evacuation of the females from Potočari was completed, the Drina Corps staff diverted the buses to the areas in which the men were being held. Colonel Krsmanović, who on 12 July had arranged the buses for the evacuation, ordered the 700 men in Sandići to be collected, and the soldiers guarding them made them throw their possessions on a large heap and hand over anything of value. During the afternoon, the group in Sandići was visited by Mladić who told them that they would come to no harm, that they would be treated as prisoners of war, that they would be exchanged for other prisoners and that their families had been escorted to Tuzla in safety. Some of these men were placed on the transport to Bratunac and other locations, while some were marched on foot to the warehouses in Kravica. The men gathered on the soccer ground at Nova Kasaba were forced to hand over their personal belongings. They too received a personal visit from Mladić during the afternoon of 13 July; on this occasion, he announced that the Bosnian authorities in Tuzla did not want the men and that they were therefore to be taken to other locations. The men in Nova Kasaba were loaded onto buses and trucks and were taken to Bratunac or the other locations.&lt;ref name=unKrsticV/&gt;

The Bosnian men who had been separated from the women, children and elderly in Potočari numbering approximately 1,000 were transported to Bratunac and subsequently joined by Bosnian men captured from the column.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-René Ruez evidence to the Blagojevic trial, 19 May 2003 ICTY transcript p 480 [http://www.icty.org/x/cases/blagojevic_jokic/trans/en/030519IT.htm]. Retrieved 7 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost without exception, the thousands of Bosnian prisoners captured, following the take-over of Srebrenica, were executed. Some were killed individually or in small groups by the soldiers who captured them and some were killed in the places where they were temporarily detained. Most, however, were killed in carefully orchestrated mass executions, commencing on 13 July 1995 in the region just north of Srebrenica.

The mass executions followed a well-established pattern. The men were first taken to empty schools or warehouses. After being detained there for some hours, they were loaded onto buses or trucks and taken to another site for execution. Usually, the execution fields were in isolated locations. The prisoners were unarmed and in many cases, steps had been taken to minimise resistance, such as [[blindfold]]ing them, binding their wrists behind their backs with ligatures or removing their shoes. Once at the killing fields, the men were taken off the trucks in small groups, lined up and shot. Those who survived the initial round of shooting were individually shot with an extra round, though sometimes only after they had been left to suffer for a time.&lt;ref name=unKrsticV/&gt;

The process of finding victim bodies in the Srebrenica region, often in mass graves, [[exhumation|exhuming]] them and finally identifying them was relatively slow.

==== Morning of 13 July: Jadar River ====
A small-scale execution took place prior to midday at the Jadar River on 13 July. Seventeen men were transported by bus a short distance to a spot on the banks of the Jadar River. The men were then lined up and shot. One man, after being hit in the hip by a bullet, jumped into the river and managed to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/tjug/en/krs-tj010802e.pdf#page=74 |title=Krstic Judgement |at=Part II.

The first large-scale mass executions began on the afternoon of 13 July 1995 in the valley of the River Cerska, to the west of Konjević Polje. One witness, hidden among trees, saw two or three trucks, followed by an armoured vehicle and an earthmoving machine proceeding towards Cerska. After that, he heard gunshots for half an hour and then saw the armoured vehicle going in the opposite direction, but not the earthmoving machine. Other witnesses report seeing a pool of blood alongside the road to Cerska that day. Muhamed Duraković, a UN translator, probably passed this execution site later that day. He reports seeing bodies tossed into a ditch alongside the road, with some men still alive.&lt;ref name="Krstic 2001 Cerska Valley"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/tjug/en/krs-tj010802e.pdf#page=76 |title=Krstic Judgement |at=Part II.

Aerial photos and excavations later confirmed the presence of a mass grave near this location. Ammunition cartridges found at the scene reveal that the victims were lined up on one side of the road, whereupon their executioners shot from the other. The bodies—150 in number—were covered with earth where they lay. It could later be established that they had been killed by guns. All were men, between the ages of 14 and 50. All but three of the 150 were wearing civilian clothes. Many had their hands tied behind their backs. Nine could later be identified and were indeed on the list of missing persons from Srebrenica.&lt;ref name="Krstic 2001 Cerska Valley"/&gt;

==== Late afternoon of 13 July: Kravica ====
Later that same afternoon, 13 July 1995 executions were also conducted in the largest of four warehouses (farm sheds) owned by the Agricultural Cooperative in Kravica. Between 1,000 and 1,500 men had been captured in fields near Sandići and detained in Sandići Meadow. They were brought to Kravica, either by bus or on foot, the distance being approximately one kilometer. A witness recalls seeing around 200 men, stripped to the waist and with their hands in the air, being forced to run in the direction of Kravica. An aerial photograph taken at 14:00 hours that afternoon shows two buses standing in front of the sheds.&lt;ref name="Krstic 2001 Kravica Warehouse"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/tjug/en/krs-tj010802e.pdf#page=77 |title=Krstic Judgement |at=Part II.

Involvement of the Drina Corps in the Mass Executions – (c) Late Afternoon of 13 July 1995: Kravica Warehouse |date=2 August 2001 |publisher=ICTY }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At around 18:00 hours, when the men were all being held in the warehouse, VRS soldiers threw in [[hand grenades]] and shot with various weapons, including [[rocket propelled grenade]]s. The mass murder in Kravica seemed "well organised and involved a substantial amount of planning, requiring the participation of the Drina Corps Command."&lt;ref name="Krstic 2001 Kravica Warehouse"/&gt;

Supposedly, there was more killing in and around Kravica and Sandići. Even before the murders in the warehouse, some 200 or 300 men were formed up in ranks near Sandići and then were executed en masse with concentrated machine guns. At Kravica, it seems that the local population had a hand in the killings. Some victims were mutilated and killed with knives. The bodies were taken to Bratunac or simply dumped in the river that runs alongside the road. One witness states that this all took place on 14 July. There were three survivors of the mass murder in the farm sheds at Kravica.&lt;ref name="Krstic 2001 Kravica Warehouse"/&gt;

Armed guards shot at the men who tried to climb out the windows to escape the massacre. When the shooting stopped, the shed was full of bodies. Another survivor, who was only slightly wounded, reports:

{{quote|I was not even able to touch the floor, the concrete floor of the warehouse.... After the shooting, I felt a strange kind of heat, warmth, which was coming from the blood that covered the concrete floor and I was stepping on the dead people who were lying around. But there were even men (just men) who were still alive, who were only wounded and as soon as I would step on him, I would hear him cry, moan, because I was trying to move as fast as I could. I could tell that people had been completely disembodied and I could feel bones of the people that had been hit by those bursts of bullets or shells, I could feel their ribs crushing. Then I would get up again and continue....&lt;ref name="ICTY" /&gt;}}

When this witness climbed out of a window, he was seen by a guard who shot at him. He then pretended to be dead and managed to escape the following morning. The other witness quoted above spent the night under a heap of bodies; the next morning, he watched as the soldiers examined the corpses for signs of life. The few survivors were forced to sing Serbian songs, and were then shot. Once the final victim had been killed, an excavator was driven in to shunt the bodies out of the shed; the asphalt outside was then hosed down with water. In September 1996, however, it was still possible to find the evidence.&lt;ref name="Krstic 2001 Kravica Warehouse"/&gt;

Analyses of hair, blood and explosives residue collected at the Kravica Warehouse provide strong evidence of the killings. Experts determined the presence of bullet strikes, explosives residue, bullets and shell cases, as well as human blood, bones and tissue adhering to the walls and floors of the building. Forensic evidence presented by the ICTY Prosecutor established a link between the executions in Kravica and the 'primary' mass grave known as Glogova 2, in which the remains of 139 people were found. In the 'secondary' grave known as Zeleni Jadar 5 there were 145 bodies, a number of which were charred. Pieces of brick and window frame which were found in the Glogova 1 grave that was opened later also established a link with Kravica. Here, the remains of 191 victims were found.&lt;ref name="Krstic 2001 Kravica Warehouse"/&gt;

==== 13–14 July: Tišća ====

As the buses crowded with Bosnian women, children and elderly made their way from Potočari to Kladanj, they were stopped at Tišća village, searched, and the Bosnian men and boys found on board were removed from the bus. The evidence reveals a well-organised operation in Tišća.&lt;ref name="Krstic 2001 Tišca"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/tjug/en/krs-tj010802e.pdf#page=81 |title=Krstic Judgement |at=Part II.

From the checkpoint, an officer directed the soldier escorting the witness towards a nearby school where many other prisoners were being held. At the school, a soldier on a field telephone appeared to be transmitting and receiving orders. Sometime around midnight, the witness was loaded onto a truck with 22 other men with their hands tied behind their backs. At one point the truck stopped and a soldier on the scene said: "Not here. Take them up there, where they took people before." The truck reached another stopping point where the soldiers came around to the back of the truck and started shooting the prisoners. The survivor escaped by running away from the truck and hiding in a forest.&lt;ref name="Krstic 2001 Tišca" /&gt;

==== 14 July: Grbavci and Orahovac ====

A large group of the prisoners who had been held overnight in Bratunac were bussed in a convoy of 30 vehicles to the Grbavci school in [[Orahovac]] early in the morning of 14 July 1995. When they got there, the school gym was already half-filled with prisoners who had been arriving since the early morning hours and within a few hours, the building was completely full. Survivors estimated that there were 2,000 to 2,500 men there, some of them very young and some quite elderly, although the ICTY Prosecution suggested this may have been an over-estimation and that the number of prisoners at this site was probably closer to 1,000. Some prisoners were taken outside and killed. At some point, a witness recalled, General Mladić arrived and told the men: "Well, your government does not want you and I have to take care of you."&lt;ref name="Krstic 2001 Grbavci Orahovac"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/tjug/en/krs-tj010802e.pdf#page=82 |title=Krstic Judgement |at=Part II. FINDINGS OF FACT – B. THE ROLE OF THE DRINA CORPS IN THE SREBRENICA CRIMES – 5. Involvement of the Drina Corps in the Mass Executions – (e) 14 July 1995: Grbavci School Detention Site and Orahovac Execution site |publisher=ICTY }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being held in the gym for several hours, the men were led out in small groups to the execution fields that afternoon. Each prisoner was blindfolded and given a drink of water as he left the gym. The prisoners were then taken in trucks to the execution fields less than one kilometre away. The men were lined up and shot in the back; those who survived the initial shooting were killed with an extra shot. Two adjacent meadows were used; once one was full of bodies, the executioners moved to the other. While the executions were in progress, the survivors said, earth-moving equipment was digging the graves. A witness who survived the shootings by pretending to be dead, reported that General Mladić drove up in a red car and watched some of the executions.&lt;ref name="Krstic 2001 Grbavci Orahovac"/&gt;

The forensic evidence supports crucial aspects of the survivors' testimony. Both aerial photos show that the ground in Orahovac was disturbed between 5 and 27 July 1995 and again between 7 and 27 September 1995. Two primary mass graves were uncovered in the area and were named Lazete 1 and Lazete 2 by investigators.&lt;ref name="Krstic 2001 Grbavci Orahovac"/&gt;

The Lazete 1 gravesite was exhumed by the ICTY Prosecution between 13 July and 3 August 2000. All of the 130 individuals uncovered, for whom sex could be determined, were male; 138 blindfolds were uncovered in the grave. Identification material for 23 persons, listed as missing following the fall of Srebrenica, was located during the exhumations at this site. The gravesite Lazete 2 was partly exhumed by a joint team from the Office of the Prosecutor and Physicians for Human Rights between August and September 1996 and completed in 2000. All of the 243 victims associated with Lazete 2 were male and the experts determined that the vast majority died of gunshot injuries. In addition, 147 blindfolds were located.&lt;ref name="Krstic 2001 Grbavci Orahovac"/&gt;

Forensic analysis of soil/pollen samples, blindfolds, ligatures, shell cases and aerial images of creation/disturbance dates, further revealed that bodies from the Lazete 1 and 2 graves were removed and reburied at secondary graves named Hodžići Road 3, 4 and 5. Aerial images show that these secondary gravesites were created between 7 September and 2 October 1995 and all of them were exhumed in 1998.&lt;ref name="Krstic 2001 Grbavci Orahovac"/&gt;

==== 14–15 July: Petkovići ====
[[File:Srebrenica Massacre - Mass Gravesite - Potocari 2007.jpg|thumb|Delegates of the International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS) examine an exhumed mass grave of victims of the July 1995 Srebrenica massacre, outside the village of Potocari, Bosnia and Herzegovina. July 2007.]]
On 14 and 15 July 1995, another large group of prisoners numbering some 1,500 to 2,000 were taken from Bratunac to the school in Petkovići. The conditions under which these men were held at the Petkovići school were even worse than those in Grabavci. It was hot, overcrowded and there was no food or water. In the absence of anything else, some prisoners chose to drink their own urine. Every now and then, soldiers would enter the room and physically abuse prisoners, or would call them outside. A few of the prisoners contemplated an escape attempt, but others said it would be better to stay since the International Red Cross would be sure to monitor the situation and they could not all be killed.&lt;ref name="Krstic 2001 Petkovci School"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/tjug/en/krs-tj010802e.pdf#page=86 |title=Krstic Judgement |at=Part II.

The men were called outside in small groups. They were ordered to strip to the waist and to remove their shoes, whereupon their hands were tied behind their backs. During the night of 14 July, the men were taken by truck to the dam at Petkovići. Those who arrived later could see immediately what was happening there. A large number of bodies were strewn on the ground, their hands tied behind their backs. Small groups of five to ten men were taken out of the trucks, lined up and shot. Some begged for water but their pleas were ignored.&lt;ref name="Krstic 2001 Petkovci School" /&gt; A survivor described his feelings of fear combined with thirst thus:

{{quote|I was really sorry that I would die thirsty, and I was trying to hide amongst the people as long as I could, like everybody else. I just wanted to live for another second or two. And when it was my turn, I jumped out with what I believe were four other people. I could feel the gravel beneath my feet. It hurt.... I was walking with my head bent down and I wasn't feeling anything.... And then I thought that I would die very fast, that I would not suffer. And I just thought that my mother would never know where I had ended up. This is what I was thinking as I was getting out of the truck. [As the soldiers walked around to kill the survivors of the first round of shooting] I was still very thirsty. But I was sort of between life and death. I didn't know whether I wanted to live or to die anymore. I decided not to call out for them to shoot and kill me, but I was sort of praying to God that they'd come and kill me.&lt;ref name="ICTY" /&gt;}}

After the soldiers had left, two survivors helped each other to untie their hands, and then crawled over the heap of bodies towards the woods, where they intended to hide. As dawn arrived, they could see the execution site where bulldozers were collecting the bodies. On the way to the execution site, one of the survivors had peeked out from under his blindfold and had seen that Mladić was also on his way to the scene.&lt;ref name="ICTY" /&gt;

Aerial photos confirmed that the earth near the Petkovići dam had been disturbed, and that it was disturbed yet again sometime between 7 and 27 September 1995. When the grave here was opened in April 1998, there seemed to be many bodies missing. Their removal had been accomplished with mechanical apparatus, causing considerable disturbance to the grave and its contents. At this time, the grave contained the remains of no more than 43 persons. Other bodies had been removed to a secondary grave, Liplje 2, prior to 2 October 1995. Here, the remains of at least 191 individuals were discovered.&lt;ref name="ICTY" /&gt;

==== 14–16 July: Branjevo ====
On 14 July 1995 more prisoners from Bratunac were bussed northward to a school in the village of Pilica, north of Zvornik. As at other detention facilities, there was no food or water and several men died in the school gym from heat and dehydration. The men were held at the Pilica school for two nights. On 16 July 1995, following a now familiar pattern, the men were called out of the school and loaded onto buses with their hands tied behind their backs. They were then driven to the Branjevo Military Farm, where groups of 10 were lined up and shot.&lt;ref name="ICTY-233"&gt;ICTY, ''[https://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/index.htm Prosecutor vs Krstic, Judgement] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517075111/http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/index.htm |date=17 May 2008 }}'', II, B, 5 (g) "[https://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/krs-tj010802e-1.htm#IIB5g 14 – 16 July 1995: Pilica School Detention Site and Branjevo Military Farm Execution Site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508011123/http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/krs-tj010802e-1.htm#IIB5g |date=8 May 2009 }}", par. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dražen Erdemović]]—who confessed killing at least 70 Bosniaks—was a member of the VRS 10th [[Sabotage]] Detachment (a Main Staff subordinate unit) and participated in mass executions. Erdemović appeared as a prosecution witness and testified: "The men in front of us were ordered to turn their backs. When those men turned their backs to us, we shot at them. We were given orders to shoot."&lt;ref name="ICTY-234"&gt;ICTY, ''[https://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/index.htm Prosecutor vs Krstic, Judgement] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517075111/http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/index.htm |date=17 May 2008 }}'', II, B, 5 (g) "[https://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/krs-tj010802e-1.htm#IIB5g 14 – 16 July 1995: Pilica School Detention Site and Branjevo Military Farm Execution Site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508011123/http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/krs-tj010802e-1.htm#IIB5g |date=8 May 2009 }}", par. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

On this point, one of the survivors recalls:

{{quote|When they shot, I threw myself on the ground... one man fell on my head. I think that he was killed on the spot. I could feel the hot blood pouring over me.... I could hear one man crying for help. He was begging them to kill him. And they simply said "Let him suffer. We'll kill him later."|Witness Q&lt;ref&gt;ICTY, ''[https://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/index.htm Prosecutor vs Krstic, Judgement] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517075111/http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/index.htm |date=17 May 2008 }}'', II, B, 5 (g) "[https://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/krs-tj010802e-1.htm#IIB5g 14 – 16 July 1995: Pilica School Detention Site and Branjevo Military Farm Execution Site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508011123/http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/krs-tj010802e-1.htm#IIB5g |date=8 May 2009 }}", par. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Erdemović said that all but one of the victims wore civilian clothes and that, except for one person who tried to escape, they offered no resistance before being shot. Sometimes the executioners were particularly cruel. When some of the soldiers recognised acquaintances from Srebrenica, they beat and humiliated them before killing them. Erdemović had to persuade his fellow soldiers to stop using a machine gun for the killings; while it mortally wounded the prisoners it did not cause death immediately and prolonged their suffering.&lt;ref name="ICTY-234" /&gt;
Between 1,000 and 1,200 men were killed in the course of that day at this execution site.&lt;ref&gt;ICTY, ''[https://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/index.htm Prosecutor vs Krstic, Judgement] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517075111/http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/index.htm |date=17 May 2008 }}'', II, B, 5 (g) "[https://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/krs-tj010802e-1.htm#IIB5g 14 – 16 July 1995: Pilica School Detention Site and Branjevo Military Farm Execution Site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508011123/http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/krs-tj010802e-1.htm#IIB5g |date=8 May 2009 }}", par. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mass Graves.jpg|thumb|Satellite photo of [[Nova Kasaba]] mass graves.]]
Erdemović testified that, at around 15:00 hours on 16 July 1995 after he and his fellow soldiers from the 10th Sabotage Detachment had finished executing the prisoners at the Branjevo Military Farm, they were told that there was a group of 500 Bosnian prisoners from Srebrenica trying to break out of a nearby Dom Kultura club. Erdemović and the other members of his unit refused to carry out any more killings. They were then told to attend a meeting with a [[Lieutenant Colonel]] at a café in Pilica. Erdemović and his fellow-soldiers travelled to the café as requested and, as they waited, they could hear shots and grenades being detonated. The sounds lasted for approximately 15–20 minutes after which a soldier from Bratunac entered the café to inform those present that "everything was over".&lt;ref name="ICTY-244"&gt;ICTY, ''[https://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/index.htm Prosecutor vs Krstic, Judgement] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517075111/http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/index.htm |date=17 May 2008 }}'', II, B, 5 (h) "[https://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/krs-tj010802e-1.htm#IIB5h 16 July 1995: Pilica Cultural Dom] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508011123/http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/krs-tj010802e-1.htm#IIB5h |date=8 May 2009 }}", par. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were no survivors to explain exactly what had happened in the Dom Kultura.&lt;ref name="ICTY-244" /&gt; The executions at the Dom Kultura were remarkable in that this was no remote spot but a location in the centre of town on the main road from Zvornik to Bijeljina.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-René Ruez evidence to the Blagojevic trial, 19 May 2003 ICTY transcript pp 535–536 [http://www.icty.org/x/cases/blagojevic_jokic/trans/en/030519IT.htm].

==== 14–17 July: Kozluk ====
[[File:Exhumation Site in Čančari valley.jpg|thumb|Exhumation of the Srebrenica massacre victims]]
The exact date of the executions at Kozluk is not known, although it can be narrowed down to the period of 14 to 17 July 1995. The most probable dates are 15 and 16 July, not least due to the geographic location of Kozluk, between Petkovići Dam and the Branjevo Military Farm. It therefore falls within the pattern of ever more northerly execution sites: Orahovac on 14 July, Petkovići Dam on 15 July, the Branjevo Military Farm and the Pilica Dom Kultura on 16 July.&lt;ref name="ICTY-253"&gt;ICTY, ''[https://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/index.htm Prosecutor vs Krstic, Judgement] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517075111/http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/index.htm |date=17 May 2008 }}'', II, B, 5 (i) "[https://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/krs-tj010802e-1.htm#IIB5i Kozluk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508011123/http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/krs-tj010802e-1.htm#IIB5i |date=8 May 2009 }}", par. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; Another indication is that a Zvornik Brigade excavator spent eight hours in Kozluk on 16 July and a truck belonging to the same brigade made two journeys between Orahovac and Kozluk that day.

Among Bosnian refugees in Germany, there were rumors of executions in Kozluk, during which the five hundred or so prisoners were forced to sing Serbian songs as they were being transported to the execution site.

==== 13–18 July: Bratunac-Konjević Polje road ====
On 13 July, near Konjević Polje, Serb soldiers summarily executed hundreds of Bosniaks, including women and children.&lt;ref name="Karadzic Mladic Indictment"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/karadzic/ind/en/kar-ii951116e.pdf|title=Initial Indictment against Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic|date=14 November 1995|publisher=ICTY|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The visible presence of UN uniforms and UN vehicles, stolen from Dutchbat, were intended to contribute to the feeling of reassurance. On 17 to 18 July, Serb soldiers captured about 150–200 Bosnians in the vicinity of Konjevic Polje and summarily executed about one-half of them.&lt;ref name="Karadzic Mladic Indictment"/&gt;

==== 18–19 July: Nezuk-Baljkovica frontline ====
After the closure of the corridor at Baljkovica, several groups of stragglers nevertheless attempted to escape into Bosnian territory. Most were captured by VRS troops in the Nezuk—Baljkovica area and killed on the spot. In the vicinity of Nezuk, about 20 small groups surrendered to Bosnian Serb military forces. After the men surrendered, Bosnian Serb soldiers ordered them to line up and summarily executed them.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3665" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Karadzic Mladic Indictment"/&gt;

On 19 July, for example, a group of approximately 11 men was killed at Nezuk itself by units of the 16th [[Republic of Serbian Krajina|Krajina]] Brigade, then operating under the direct command of the Zvornik Brigade. Reports reveal that a further 13 men, all ARBiH soldiers, were killed at Nezuk on 19 July.&lt;ref name="ICTY-IIB5j"&gt;ICTY, ''[https://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/index.htm Prosecutor vs Krstic, Judgement] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517075111/http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/index.htm |date=17 May 2008 }}'', II, B, 5 (j) "[https://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/krs-tj010802e-1.htm#IIB5j Smaller Scale Executions following the Mass Executions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508011123/http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/TrialC1/judgement/krs-tj010802e-1.htm#IIB5j |date=8 May 2009 }}".&lt;/ref&gt; The report of the march to Tuzla includes the account of an ARBiH soldier who witnessed several executions carried out by police that day. He survived because 30 ARBiH soldiers were needed for an exchange of prisoners following the ARBiH's capture of a VRS officer at Baljkovica. The soldier was himself exchanged late 1995; at that time, there were still 229 men from Srebrenica in the Batkovici [[prisoner of war camp]], including two men who had been taken prisoner in 1994.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

==== 20–22 July: Meces area ====
According to ICTY indictments of Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić, on 20 to 21 July 1995 near the village of Meces, VRS personnel, using megaphones, urged Bosniak men who had fled Srebrenica to surrender and assured them that they would be safe. Approximately 350 men responded to these entreaties and surrendered. The soldiers then took approximately 150 of them, instructed them to dig their own graves and summarily executed them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/kar-ii951116e.htm |title=paras 20.6 and 20.7 |publisher=United Nations |date=5 March 2007 |accessdate=26 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829194758/http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/kar-ii951116e.htm |archivedate=29 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After the massacre ===
[[File:ICMP-PIP.jpg|thumb|ICMP's [[Podrinje Identification Project]] (PIP) was formed to deal with the identification primarily of victims of 1995 Srebrenica massacre. PIP includes a facility for storing, processing, and handling exhumed remains. Much of the remains are only fragments or commingled body fragments since they were recovered from secondary [[mass grave]]s. The photo depicts one section of the refrigerated [[mortuary]].]]

During the days following the massacre, American [[Reconnaissance aircraft|spy planes]] overflew the area of Srebrenica, and took photos showing the ground in vast areas around the town had been removed, a sign of mass burials.

On 22 July, the commanding officer of the [[Zvornik Brigade]], Lieutenant Colonel [[Vinko Pandurević]], requested the Drina Corps to set up a committee to oversee the exchange of prisoners. He also asked for instructions where the prisoners of war his unit had already captured should be taken and to whom they should be handed over. Approximately 50 wounded captives were taken to the Bratunac hospital. Another group of prisoners was taken to the Batkovići camp (near Bijeljina), and these were mostly exchanged later.&lt;ref name="trial-ch24"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trial-ch.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/trialwatch/Srebrenica_Report2004.pdf#page=24|page=24|title=The Events in and Around Srebrenica Between 10th and 19th July 1995|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223001/http://trial-ch.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/trialwatch/Srebrenica_Report2004.pdf#page=24|archive-date=3 March 2016|date=11 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 July, the Zvornik Brigade captured 25 more ARBiH soldiers who were taken directly to the camp at Batkovići, as were 34 ARBiH men captured the following day.

Zvornik Brigade reports up until 31 July continue to describe the search for refugees and the capture of small groups of Bosniaks.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

A number of Bosniaks managed to cross over the River Drina into Serbia at [[Ljubovija]] and Bajina Bašta. 38 of them were returned to RS. Some were taken to the Batkovići camp, where they were exchanged. The fate of the majority has not been established.&lt;ref name="trial-ch24" /&gt; Some of those attempting to cross the Drina drowned.&lt;ref name="trial-ch24" /&gt;

By 17 July 201 Bosniak soldiers had arrived in Žepa, exhausted and many with light wounds.&lt;ref name="trial-ch24" /&gt; By 28 July another 500 had arrived in Žepa from Srebrenica.&lt;ref name="trial-ch24" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esma Palic evidence to the Popovic et al trial, 6 February 2006, ICTY transcript p 6939 [http://www.icty.org/x/cases/popovic/trans/en/070206ED.htm]. Retrieved 7 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

After 19 July 1995, small Bosniak groups were hiding in the woods for days and months, trying to reach Tuzla.&lt;ref name="trial-ch24" /&gt; Numerous refugees found themselves cut off for some time in the area around Mount Udrc. They did not know what to do next or where to go; they managed to stay alive by eating snails, leaves and mushrooms. The atmosphere was one of tension, hunger and desperation. On or about 23 July, the Bosnian Serbs swept through this area too, and according to one survivor they killed many people as they did so.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

Meanwhile, the VRS had commenced the process of clearing the bodies from around Srebrenica, Žepa, Kamenica and Snagovo. Work parties and municipal services were deployed to help. In Srebrenica, the refuse that had littered the streets since the departure of the people was collected and burnt, the town disinfected and deloused.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

==== Wanderers ====
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
Many people in the part of the column which had not succeeded in passing Kamenica did not wish to give themselves up and decided to turn back towards Žepa. Others remained where they were, splitting up into smaller groups of no more than ten. Some wandered around for months, either alone or groups of two, four or six men. Few knew the way and so attempted to navigate by following overhead power cables. They often found corpses, by now in a state of decomposition. Sometimes one group met another group from Srebrenica who knew of a deserted Bosniak village in the region; they would then proceed there together.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

Some of the Bosniak men decided to retrace their steps towards the Srebrenica region, since this was familiar territory and they knew where to find food. From here, they would once again set out towards Žepa or attempt to reach Tuzla. Some arrived in Tuzla after many months, having been wandering around the area between Srebrenica and Udrc with absolutely no sense of direction. A few hundred managed to reach Žepa just before the Serb military, paramilitary and police forces occupied the enclave on 25 July 1995. Once Žepa had succumbed to the Serb pressure, they had to move on once more, either trying to reach Tuzla or crossing the River Drina into Serbia.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

To feed themselves, the men took potatoes and other vegetables from the fields around the Serbian villages at night. The local Serb population therefore began to mount patrols around their villages. The Bosniaks would generally sleep by day and wait for the cover of darkness before moving on. This continued for a long time. For example, the people of Milici, a village on the route to Tuzla, discovered the disappearance of livestock in November 1995 and formed an armed group in search of stragglers from the column.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

There are many stories recalling the experiences of those who lost contact with the column, their wanderings and the horrors they saw. One involves three young men aged 17, 18 and 19, who on several occasions attempted to cross the main Konjević Polje to Nova Kasaba road but were unsuccessful in doing so each time. They eventually managed to reach Žepa only after the enclave had fallen as well. The group had set up camp in a couple of deserted Bosniak villages where they managed to hide out for several months without attracting attention. Sometimes the teenagers would escort groups of other refugees as far as the next obstacle, before eventually returning to their base. Finally, on 26 April 1996, a full six months after the signing of the [[Dayton Accord]], they crossed the Drina into Serbia.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

'''Zvornik 7'''

The most famous group of seven men wandered about in occupied territory for the entire winter. On 10 May 1996, after nine months on the run and over six months after the end of the war, they were discovered in a quarry by American [[IFOR]] soldiers. They immediately turned over to the patrol; they were searched and their weapons (two [[pistol]]s and three hand grenades) were confiscated. The men said that they had been in hiding in the immediate vicinity of Srebrenica since the fall of the enclave. They did not look like soldiers and the Americans decided that this was a matter for the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Preston V. McMurry III |url=http://www.prestonm.com/military/bosnia/articles/zvornik7.html |title=The Officer Who First Took Charge of the Zvornik Seven |publisher=Prestonm.com |accessdate=26 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715112511/http://www.prestonm.com/military/bosnia/articles/zvornik7.html |archivedate=15 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The operations officer of this American unit ordered that a Serb patrol should be escorted into the quarry whereupon the men would be handed over to the Serbs.

The prisoners said they were initially tortured after the transfer, but later were treated relatively well. In April 1997 the local court in [[Republika Srpska]] convicted the group, known as the [[Zvornik 7]], for illegal possession of firearms and three of them for the murder of four Serbian woodsmen. When announcing the verdict the presenter of the TV of Republika Srpska described them as ''the group of Muslim terrorists from Srebrenica who last year massacred Serb civilians.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiv.medienhilfe.ch/Projekte/BiH/Monitoring/IWPR/1996/mon_v2_14.htm Medienhilfe Ex-Jugoslawien – Monitoring Report – Media trial of the Zvornik Seven] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006140608/http://archiv.medienhilfe.ch/Projekte/BiH/Monitoring/IWPR/1996/mon_v2_14.htm |date=6 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial was widely condemned by the international community as "a flagrant miscarriage of justice",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu2/5/ex_yug/yug_pr10.htm UNHCR report -]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627152318/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu2/5/ex_yug/yug_pr10.htm |date=27 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohr.int/?p=55215 |title=Office of the High Representative Press Release – Zvornik 7 Verdict|date=15 December 1998|accessdate=28 April 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428094434/http://www.ohr.int/?p=55215 |archivedate=28 April 2017|authors=OHR, OSCE, UNMIBH, UNHCHR}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the conviction was later quashed for 'procedural reasons' following pressure from the international community. In 1999, the three remaining defendants in the Zvornik 7 case were swapped for three Serbs serving 15 years each in a Bosnian prison.

==== Reburials in the secondary mass graves ====
[[File:HuseinovicSadik.jpg|right|thumb|Grave of a 13-year-old]]
From approximately 1 August 1995 to 1 November 1995, there was an organised effort to remove the bodies from primary mass gravesites and transport them to secondary and tertiary gravesites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=ICTY|title=Prosecutor v.

The cover-up operation has had a direct impact on the recovery and identification of the remains.

In addition to the ligatures and blindfolds found at the mass graves, the effort to hide the bodies has been seen as evidence of the organised nature of the massacres and the non-combatant status of the victims, since had the victims died in normal combat operations, there would be no need to hide their remains.&lt;ref name="Durnford-BBB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Peter [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3640788.stm "Pollen Helps War Crimes Forensics"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, {{ill|Stavros Vitalis|el}} announced that the volunteers were suing the writer [[Takis Michas]] for libel over allegations in his book ''Unholy Alliance'', in which Michas described aspects of the Greek state's tacit support for the Serbs during the Bosnian War.

=== 1995: Indictment of Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić ===

On 16 November 1995 Radovan Karadžić, "President of the Republika Srpska" and Ratko Mladić, Commander of the VRS, were indicted by the ICTY for their alleged direct responsibility for the war crimes committed in July 1995 against the Bosnian Muslim population of Srebrenica.&lt;ref name="UN report" /&gt;

=== 1999: UN Secretary-General's report ===

In 1999, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan submitted his report on the Fall of Srebrenica. In it, he acknowledged that the international community as a whole had to accept its share of responsibility for its response to the ethnic cleansing campaign that culminated in the murder of some 7,000 unarmed civilians from the town designated by the Security Council as a "safe area."&lt;ref name="UN report" /&gt;&lt;ref name=10thAnniversary&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2005-07-11/secretary-generals-message-ceremony-marking-10th-anniversary|title=Secretary-General's message to ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre (delivered by Mark Malloch Brown, Chef de Cabinet)|date=11 July 2005|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=A/54/549 Links to documents]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912110426/http://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=A%2F54%2F549 |date=12 September 2009 }}.

The failure of Dutchbat to protect the Srebrenica enclave became a [[national trauma]] in the Netherlands and led to long-running discussions in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="vandeBilt"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.bradford.ac.uk/social-sciences/peace-conflict-and-development/issue-21/Srebrenica---a-dutch-national-trauma.pdf#page=27|last=van de Bildt|first=Joyce|title=Srebrenica: A Dutch national trauma|work=Journal of Peace, Conflict &amp; Development|issue=21|date=March 2015|issn=1742-0601|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the Dutch government asked the [[Netherlands Institute for War Documentation]] to conduct research into the events before, during and after the fall of Srebrenica.

The NIOD report is cited often, however, the [[Institute for War and Peace Reporting]] labelled the report "controversial", as "the sheer abundance of information makes it possible for anyone to pluck from it whatever they need to make their point". One of the authors of the report claimed some of the sources were "unreliable", and were only used to support another author's argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Karen Meirik |url=http://iwpr.net/report-news/controversial-srebrenica-report-back-table |title=Controversial Srebrenica Report Back on Table |work=Institute for War &amp; Peace Reporting |location=UK |accessdate=20 November 2013 |date=9 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2002: First Republika Srpska report===

In September 2002, the Republika Srpska Office of Relations with the ICTY issued the "[[Report about Case Srebrenica]]". The document, authored by [[Darko Trifunović]], was endorsed by many leading Bosnian Serb politicians. It concluded that 1,800 Bosnian Muslim soldiers died during fighting and a further 100 more died as a result of exhaustion. "The number of Muslim soldiers killed by Bosnian Serbs out of personal revenge or lack of knowledge of international law is probably about 100...It is important to uncover the names of the perpetrators in order to accurately and unequivocally establish whether or not these were isolated instances." The report also examined the [[mass graves]], claiming that they were made for hygiene reasons, question the legitimacy of the missing person lists and undermine a key witness' mental health and military history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slobodan-milosevic.org/documents/srebrenica.pdf Report about Case Srebrenica] – Banja Luka, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Crisis Group]] and the United Nations condemned the manipulation of their statements in this report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,349957,00.html Imaginary Massacres?], ''Time'', 11 September 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 September 2003, former US President [[Bill Clinton]] officially opened the [[Srebrenica Genocide memorial]] to honour the victims of the genocide. The total cost of the project was around $5.8&amp;nbsp;million. "We must pay tribute to the innocent lives, many of them children who were snuffed out in what must be called genocidal madness", Clinton said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3124642.stm |title=Clinton unveils Bosnia memorial |date=20 September 2003 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilkinson|first=Tracy|title=Clinton Helps Bosnians Mourn Their Men |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/sep/21/world/fg-memorial21|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=21 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2004: Second Republika Srpska report and official apology ===

On 7 March 2003, the [[Human Rights Chamber for Bosnia and Herzegovina]] issued a decision which ordered the [[Republika Srpska]], among other things, to conduct a full investigation into the Srebrenica events, and disclose the results at the latest on 7 September 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.ba/DATABASE/decisions/CH01-8365%20Selimovic%20Admissibility%20and%20Merits%20E.pdf#page=54|page=50|title=DECISION ON ADMISSIBILITY AND MERITS – The Srebrenica Cases (49 applications) against The Republika Srpska|date=7 March 2003|work=Human Rights Chamber for Bosnia and Herzegovina|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chamber had no coercive power to implement the decision, especially because it ceased to exist in late 2003.&lt;ref name="Investigating Srebrenica"&gt;{{Citation|last1=Picard|first1=Michèle|last2=Zinbo|first2=Asta|chapter=The Long Road to Admission: The Report of the Government of the Republika Srpska|pages=137–140|editor-last1=Delpla|editor-first1=Isabelle|editor-last2=Bougarel|editor-first2=Xavier|editor-last3=Fournel|editor-first3=Jean-Louis|title=Investigating Srebrenica: Institutions, Facts, Responsibilities|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=New York|publication-date=2012|isbn=978-0-85745-472-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RS then published two reports, on 3 June 2003 and 5 September 2003, which the Human Rights Chamber concluded did not fulfill the obligations of the RS.&lt;ref name="Investigating Srebrenica"/&gt; On 15 October 2003, The [[High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina|High Representative]], [[Paddy Ashdown]], lamented that "getting the truth from the [Bosnian Serb] government is like extracting rotten teeth". Ashdown did, however, welcome a recommendation in the September report to form an independent commission to investigate the Srebrenica events and issue a report within six months.&lt;ref name=RottenTeeth&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tol.org/client/article/10827-pulling-rotten-teeth.html|work=[[Transitions Online]]|first=Anes|last=Alic|title='Pulling Rotten Teeth'|date=20 October 2003|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Srebrenica commission, officially titled the ''Commission for Investigation of the Events in and around Srebrenica between 10 and 19 July 1995'', was established in December 2003, and submitted its final report&lt;ref name="RS commission report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trial-ch.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/trialwatch/Srebrenica_Report2004.pdf|title=The Events in and Around Srebrenica Between 10th and 19th July 1995|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223001/http://trial-ch.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/trialwatch/Srebrenica_Report2004.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2016|date=11 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 4 June 2004, and then an addendum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://balkanwitness.glypx.com/srebr_final_e.pdf|date=15 October 2004|title=Addendum to the Report of 11 June 2004 on the Events in and around Srebrenica between 10 and 19 July 1995|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429052959/http://balkanwitness.glypx.com/srebr_final_e.pdf|archive-date=29 April 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 15 October 2004 after delayed information was supplied.&lt;ref name="Investigating Srebrenica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohr.int/?p=44915|publisher=Office of the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina |accessdate=1 May 2017|title=Srebrenica Commission Report to be assessed by judges before public comments|date=18 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report acknowledged that at least 7,000 men and boys were killed by Bosnian Serb forces, citing a provisional figure of 7,800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vaZAwBHxdUoC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;lpg=PA192|title=Peace and Justice |author=Rachel Kerr|year=2007|work= |publisher=Polity |accessdate=5 August 2013}}, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the report, because of "limited time" and to "maximize resources", the commission "accepted the historical background and the facts stated in the second-instance judgment 'Prosecutor vs. [[Radislav Krstić]]', when the ICTY convicted the accused for 'assisting and supporting genocide' committed in Srebrenica".&lt;ref name="RS commission report"/&gt;

The findings of the commission remain generally disputed by Serb nationalists, who claim it was heavily pressured by the High Representative, given that an earlier RS government report which exonerated the Serbs was dismissed. Nevertheless, [[Dragan Čavić]], the president of Republika Srpska, acknowledged in a televised address that Serb forces killed several thousand civilians in violation of the [[international law]], and asserted that Srebrenica was a dark chapter in Serb history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=384060 |title=Otvaranje najmračnije stranice |publisher=[[Vreme]] |author=Tanja Topić |date=1 July 2004 |language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 November 2004, the government of Republika Srpska issued an official apology. The statement came after a government review of the Srebrenica commission's report. "The report makes it clear that enormous crimes were committed in the area of Srebrenica in July 1995. The Bosnian Serb Government shares the pain of the families of the Srebrenica victims, is truly sorry and apologises for the tragedy", the Bosnian Serb government said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1147&amp;reportid=166 |title=Bosnian Serbs issue apology for massacre, AP, 11 November 2004 |publisher=Bosnia.org.uk |date=11 November 2004 |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2005: Republika Srpska Srebrenica Working Group ===

After a request by Ashdown, the RS established a working group to implement the recommendations of the report by the Srebrenica commission. The group was to analyze the documentation in the report's confidential annexes and identify all the possible perpetrators who were officials in the institutions of the RS.&lt;ref name="RS Working Group"&gt;{{Citation|last1=Picard|first1=Michèle|last2=Zinbo|first2=Asta|chapter=The Long Road to Admission: The Report of the Government of the Republika Srpska|page=141|editor-last1=Delpla|editor-first1=Isabelle|editor-last2=Bougarel|editor-first2=Xavier|editor-last3=Fournel|editor-first3=Jean-Louis|title=Investigating Srebrenica: Institutions, Facts, Responsibilities|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=New York|publication-date=2012|isbn=978-0-85745-472-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report on 1 April 2005 identified 892 such persons still employed by the RS, and the information was provided to the State Prosecutor of Bosnia and Herzegovina with the understanding that the names would not be made public until official proceedings had been opened.&lt;ref name="RS Working Group"/&gt;

The video footage (starting about 2hr 35 min. into the proceedings) shows an [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] priest blessing several members of a Serbian unit known as the "Scorpions." Later these soldiers are shown visibly abusing civilians physically. They were later identified as four minors as young as 16 and two men in their early twenties. The footage then shows the execution of four of the civilians and shows them lying dead in the field. At this point the cameraman expresses disappointment that the camera's battery is almost out. The soldiers then ordered the two remaining captives to take the four dead bodies into a nearby barn, where they were also killed upon completing this task.&lt;ref name="Milošević transcript"/&gt;&lt;ref name="publicinternationallaw.org"/&gt;

The video caused public outrage in Serbia. In the days following its showing, the Serbian government arrested some of the former soldiers identified on the video. The event was extensively covered by the newspaper ''[[Danas (newspaper)|Danas]]'' and [[radio station|radio]] and television station [[B92]]. Nura Alispahić, mother of the 16-year-old Azmir Alispahić, saw the execution of her son on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.janinedigiovanni.com/srebrenica-ten-years-on.html|author=Janine di Giovanni|work=International Herald Tribune|date=June 2005|title=Srebrenica – The Living Dead|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821092440/http://www.janinedigiovanni.com/srebrenica-ten-years-on.html |archivedate=21 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She said that she was already aware of her son's death and said she had been told that his body was burned following the execution; his remains were among those buried in Potočari in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/world/heartbroken-mom-sees-son-shot-on-tv-242941|title=Heartbroken mom sees son shot on TV|first=Samir|last=Krilic|agency=Associated Press|work=Cape Argus|date=4 June 2005|accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Belgrade District Court War Crimes Chamber, amended indictment against Aleksandar Medic in Case K.V. 6/2005, 1 October 2008 {{cite web |url=http://www.tuzilastvorz.org.rs/html_trz/OPTUZNICE/O_2008_10_01_ENG.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006213607/http://www.tuzilastvorz.org.rs/html_trz/OPTUZNICE/O_2008_10_01_ENG.pdf |archivedate=6 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}.

===2005: UN Secretary-General's message to the 10th anniversary commemoration===

In his address to the 10th anniversary commemoration at Potočari, the UN Secretary-General paid tribute to the victims of "a terrible crime – the worst on European soil since the Second World War", on a date "marked as a grim reminder of man's inhumanity to man". He said that the first duty of the international community was to uncover and confront the full truth about what happened, a hard truth for those who serve the United Nations, because great nations failed to respond adequately. There should have been stronger military forces in place, and a stronger will to use them.

[[File:Boy at 2006 Srebrenica funeral.jpg|thumb|A boy at a grave during the 2006 funeral of genocide victims]]
Blame lay first and foremost with those who planned and carried out the massacre, assisted them, or harboured and continue to harbour them. However the UN also bore its share of responsibility, having made serious errors of judgement, rooted in a philosophy of impartiality and non-violence which, however admirable, was unsuited to the conflict in Bosnia; because of that the tragedy of Srebrenica would haunt the UN's history forever.

Rebuilding trust among the peoples of the region could only be done by persisting in the struggle for justice, without which there could be no reconciliation, and no peace for the families of the victims, nor for society as a whole.

The quest for justice remained incomplete while those charged with being the main architects of this massacre—Ratko Mladić and Radovan Karadžić—were still at large and had not been made to answer the charges against them before the International Criminal Tribunal. He called on all Bosnians to search for truth and reconciliation.

Even while addressing the crimes of the past, the most important obligation was to prevent such systematic slaughter ever recurring anywhere again. The world had to equip itself to act collectively against genocide, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. The "responsibility to protect" had to be given tangible meaning, not just rhetorical support.

He committed the UN helping the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina to rebuild a viable economy and secure a peaceful, prosperous future among the family of nations.&lt;ref name=10thAnniversary/&gt;

In December 2006, the Dutch government awarded the Dutch UN peacekeepers who served in Srebrenica an insignia because they believed they "deserved recognition for their behaviour in difficult circumstances", also noting the limited mandate and the ill-equipped nature of the mission. However, survivors and relatives of the victims condemned the move, calling it a "humiliating decision" and responded with protest rallies in The Hague, [[Assen]] (where the ceremony took place) and Bosnia's capital Sarajevo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anger over Dutch Srebrenica medal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6207254.stm|publisher=BBC News |date=4 December 2006 |accessdate=8 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Socialist Party of Serbia]], formerly under Slobodan Milošević and now under new leadership, voted in favor of adopting the resolution.

Under [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 827|Resolution 827]] (1993) the UN Security Council established the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) to try those responsible for violations of international humanitarian law, including genocide, on the territory of the former Yugoslavia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/eCache/DEF/9/564.html |title=Hague Justice Portal, "Srebrenica in summary – An overview of the legal proceedings relating to the 1995 genocide".

Two officers of the Army of the Republika Srpska have been convicted by the Tribunal for their involvement in the Srebrenica genocide, [[Radislav Krstić]] and [[Vidoje Blagojević]]. General Krstić, who led the assault on Srebrenica alongside Ratko Mladić, was convicted by the tribunal of aiding and abetting genocide and received a sentence of 35 years imprisonment. Colonel Blagojević received a sentence of 18 years imprisonment for crimes against humanity.

The ICTY's final ruling in the case against Krstić judicially recognized the Srebrenica massacre as an act of [[genocide]]:

The court further held that this decision was wrong, because the Dutch soldiers should have known that they were in great danger of being tortured or killed. Both claimants are therefore eligible for compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Organisatie/Gerechtshoven/Den-Haag/Nieuws/Pages/NederlandseStaataansprakelijkvoordooddrieMoslimmannennavalSrebrenica.aspx |title=Nederlandse Staat aansprakelijk voor dood drie Moslimmannen na val Srebrenica |publisher=rechtspraak.nl |accessdate=11 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318102557/http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Organisatie/Gerechtshoven/Den-Haag/Nieuws/Pages/NederlandseStaataansprakelijkvoordooddrieMoslimmannennavalSrebrenica.aspx |archivedate=18 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analyses ==

=== Role of Bosnian forces on the ground ===
In response to the suggestion that the Bosniak forces in Srebrenica made no adequate attempt to defend the town, the Report of the Secretary-General pursuant to General Assembly resolution 53/35—The Fall of Srebrenica,&lt;ref name="UN report" /&gt; delivered to the 54th session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 15 November 1999 states:

{{quote|476. Concerning the accusation that the Bosniaks did not do enough to defend Srebrenica, military experts consulted in connection with this report were largely in agreement that the Bosniaks could not have defended Srebrenica for long in the face of a concerted attack supported by armour and artillery. (...)

478. Many have accused the Bosniak forces of withdrawing from the enclave as the Serb forces advanced on the day of its fall. However, it must be remembered that on the eve of the final Serb assault the Dutchbat Commander urged the Bosniaks to withdraw from defensive positions south of Srebrenica town—the direction from which the Serbs were advancing. He did so because he believed that NATO aircraft would soon be launching widespread air strikes against the advancing Serbs.

479. A third accusation levelled at the Bosniak defenders of Srebrenica is that they provoked the Serb offensive by attacking out of that safe area. Even though this accusation is often repeated by international sources, there is no credible evidence to support it. Dutchbat personnel on the ground at the time assessed that the few "raids" the Bosniaks mounted out of Srebrenica were of little or no military significance. These raids were often organised in order to gather food, as the Serbs had refused access for humanitarian convoys into the enclave. Even Serb sources approached in the context of this report acknowledged that the Bosniak forces in Srebrenica posed no significant military threat to them. The biggest attack the Bosniaks launched out of Srebrenica during the more than two years during which it was designated a safe area appears to have been the raid on the village of Višnjica, on 26 June 1995, in which several houses were burned, up to four Serbs were killed and approximately 100 sheep were stolen. In contrast, the Serbs overran the enclave two weeks later, driving tens of thousands from their homes, and summarily executing thousands of men and boys. The Serbs repeatedly exaggerated the extent of the raids out of Srebrenica as a pretext for the prosecution of a central war aim: to create a geographically contiguous and ethnically pure territory along the Drina, while freeing their troops to fight in other parts of the country. The extent to which this pretext was accepted at face value by international actors and observers reflected the prism of "moral equivalency" through which the conflict in Bosnia was viewed by too many for too long.&lt;ref name="UN report bosniac forces"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Secretary-General pursuant to General Assembly resolution 53/35 — The fall of Srebrenica|url=https://undocs.org/A/54/549|website=undocs.org|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=15 March 2017|language=en|at=XI.

=== Disputed Serb casualties around Srebrenica ===
It is agreed by all sides that Serbs suffered a number of casualties during military forays led by [[Naser Orić]]. The controversy over the nature and number of the casualties came to a head in 2005, the 10th anniversary of the massacre.&lt;ref name="hrw-oric"&gt;Ivanisevic, Bogdan.

Retrieved 31 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Human Rights Watch]], the ultra-nationalist [[Serbian Radical Party]] "launched an aggressive campaign to prove that Muslims had committed crimes against thousands of Serbs in the area" which "was intended to diminish the significance of the July 1995 crime."&lt;ref name="hrw-oric" /&gt; A press briefing by the ICTY Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) dated 6 July 2005 noted that the number of Serb deaths in the region alleged by the Serbian authorities had increased from 1,400 to 3,500, a figure the OTP stated "[does] not reflect the reality."&lt;ref name="icty-july05"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/briefing/2005/PB050706.htm |title=ICTY Weekly Press Briefing, July 2005 |publisher=United Nations |date=5 March 2007 |accessdate=26 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510013827/http://www.un.org/icty/briefing/2005/PB050706.htm |archivedate=10 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The briefing cited previous accounts:
* The Republika Srpska's Commission for War Crimes gave the number of Serb victims in the municipalities of Bratunac, Srebrenica and Skelani as 995; 520 in Bratunac and 475 in Srebrenica.
* ''The Chronicle of Our Graves'' by Milivoje Ivanišević, president of the Belgrade Centre for Investigating Crimes Committed against the Serbs, estimates the number of people killed at around 1,200.
* ''For the Honourable Cross and Golden Freedom'', a book published by the RS [[Ministry of Interior]], referred to 641 Serb victims in the [[Bratunac]]-[[Srebrenica]]-[[Skelani]] region.

The accuracy of these numbers is challenged: the OTP noted that although Ivanišević's book estimated that around 1,200 Serbs were killed, personal details were only available for 624 victims.&lt;ref name="icty-july05" /&gt; The validity of labeling some of the casualties as "victims" is also challenged:&lt;ref name="icty-july05" /&gt; studies have found a significant majority of military casualties compared to civilian casualties.&lt;ref name="RDC"&gt;[http://www.idc.org.ba/project/the_myth_of_bratunac.html RDC.

In the case of the village of Bjelovac, Serbs even used warplanes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sense-agency.com/en/stream.php?sta=3&amp;pid=8198&amp;kat=3 ICTY: Naser Orić verdict]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303224423/http://www.sense-agency.com/en/stream.php?sta=3&amp;pid=8198&amp;kat=3 |date=3 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved 21 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The ICTY Outreach Programme notes that the claim that Bosnian Serb forces killed the prisoners from Srebrenica in revenge for crimes committed by Bosnian Muslim forces against Serbs in the villages around Srebrenica provides no defence under international law and soldiers, certainly experienced officers, would be aware of the fact. To offer revenge as a justification for crimes is to attack the rule of law, and civilization itself, and nor does revenge provide moral justification for killing people simply because they share the same ethnicity as others who perpetrated crimes. The methodical planning and mobilization of the substantial resources involved required orders to be given at a high command level. The VRS had a plan to kill the Bosnian Muslim prisoners, as Dragan Obrenović confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;ICTY Outreach Programme, "Facts about Srebrenica", A Planned Killing Operation, p 6, undated – after June 2005 [http://www.icty.org/x/file/Outreach/view_from_hague/jit_srebrenica_en.pdf]. Retrieved 8 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN Secretary-General's report on the fall of Srebrenica said: "Even though this accusation is often repeated by international sources, there is no credible evidence to support it... The Serbs repeatedly exaggerated the extent of the raids out of Srebrenica as a pretext for the prosecution of a central war aim: to create a geographically contiguous and ethnically pure territory along the Drina."&lt;ref name="UN report bosniac forces" /&gt;

===Claim that the planning of mass executions in Srebrenica defies military logic===
During [[Radislav Krstić]]'s trial before the ICTY, the prosecution's [[military advisor]], Richard Butler, pointed out that by carrying out a mass execution, the Serb Army deprived themselves of an extremely valuable bargaining counter. Butler suggested that they would have had far more to gain had they taken the men in Potočari as [[prisoners of war]], under the supervision of the [[International Red Cross]] ([[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]]) and the UN troops still in the area. It might then have been possible to enter into some sort of exchange deal or they might have been able to force [[concession (politics)|political concessions]]. Based on this reasoning, the ensuing mass murder defied military explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/tjug/en/krs-tj010802e.pdf#page=26 |title=Krstic Judgement |at=Part II.

===Dutchbat===
The Dutch Battalion "[[Dutchbat]]" was found guilty by the courts in the Netherlands of failing to protect some of the Bosniak refugees in the Safe Area.&lt;ref name="Netherlands 2013" /&gt; Minister [[Joris Voorhoeve|Voorhoeve]] of the Netherlands had ordered that "under no circumstances was Dutchbat allowed to cooperate in the separate treatment of men."&lt;ref&gt;Supreme Court Judgement, ''ibid''. p7 para x&lt;/ref&gt; A NATO battalion is expected to be able to exercise judgement when confronted with a conflict between rules of engagement and a specific order designed to protect refugees; moreover, it was the Netherlands and not the UN that had effective control of Dutchbat.&lt;ref&gt;Supreme Court Judgement, ''ibid''. p12&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 July, "Dutchbat" expelled{{why|date=July 2015}} five Bosniak refugees from the United Nations compound. Later proceedings in Dutch courts have established legal liability of The Netherlands for the deaths of those expelled.

In 2013 the Dutch Supreme Court held the Netherlands responsible for the death of 3 Bosnian men who were expelled from a compound held by Dutchbat, on 13 July 1995.&lt;ref name="NYT9613"/&gt;

====Claims of problems in the UNPROFOR chain of command above "Dutchbat"====
[[Brigadier General]], [[Hagrup Haukland]] was [[UNPROFOR]]'s Commander of&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The fall of Srebrenica|url=http://www.juliagorin.com/images/niod/p3_c09_s006_b01.html|publisher=[[Netherlands Institute for War Documentation]]|accessdate=2013-04-10|page=Part III chapter 9.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; the sector in which the killings of the [[Srebrenica Massacre]] started on 11 July 1995. At this time he was on vacation.&lt;ref name="vg.no"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/artikkel.php?artid=106292|title=Norsk oberst får kritikk etter folkemord|author=Andreas Arnseth|work=VG}}&lt;/ref&gt; His subordinate, Colonel [[Charles Brantz]] phoned Haukland twice on 9 July 1995 to inform him about the crisis in [[Srebrenica Massacre|Srebrenica]].&lt;ref name=Eraker&gt;{{cite web|title=Forsøker å skjule sannheten |url=https://www.nytid.no/blank-118/ |work=[[Ny Tid]] |date=24 September 2005 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222142827/http://www.nytid.no/arkiv/artikler/20050921/blank/ |archivedate=22 February 2014 |accessdate=25 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Confusion within his staff has been attributed in part to his being slow&lt;ref name="vg.no" /&gt; to return to his place of work, not arriving at [[Tuzla]] headquarters until 14 July.&lt;ref name=Eraker/&gt;

Other problems within Haukland's staff included&lt;ref name=Eraker/&gt; lack of cooperation between "the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and the [[Pakistani]]s", according to Harald Valved ([[UNPROFOR]] [[military advisor]]). The 2002 report ''[[Srebrenica: a 'safe' area]]'' said that "The cadres consisted of clans of [[Norwegians|Norwegian]], Pakistani and Dutch military that were incapable of adequate mutual cooperation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juliagorin.com/images/niod/p3_c06_s003_b01.html|title=Srebrenica: Part 3, Chapter 6, Section 3|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 an unnamed officer on Haukland's multinational staff at Tuzla in 1995, disputed the claim by Haukland and the Norwegian [[Chief of Defence of Norway|Chief of Defence]], [[Arne Solli]], that the attack on Srebrenica was a surprise.&lt;ref name=Eraker/&gt; The officer said "We knew early on that the Serbs were amassing their forces around Srebrenica. At the end of June, Haukland informed the headquarters at [[Sarajevo]] again and again in regards to this".&lt;ref name=Eraker/&gt;

In 2006 it was reported that Haukland regularly informed Sollie about the conditions within Haukland's sector, and when Haukland departed Bosnia on his vacation to [[Norway]], they travelled on the same airplane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytid.no/styrken_som_sviktet/|title=Styrken som sviktet|work=[[Ny Tid]]|date=13 July 2006|accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2002 report ''Srebrenica: a 'safe' area'', did not assign any blame to Haukland for the massacre.

==== Claims and retraction by retired NATO SACLANT ====
In March 2010, [[John J. Sheehan|John Sheehan]], NATO's [[Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic]] from 1994 to 1997, told a US Senate hearing that the Dutch had "declared a peace dividend and made a conscious effort to socialise their military – that includes the unionisation of their militaries, it includes open homosexuality", claiming that gay soldiers could result in events like Srebrenica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ian Traynor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/19/gay-dutch-soldiers-srebrenica?showCommentBox=true#post-area |title=US general: Gay Dutch soldiers caused Srebrenica massacre |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=3 June 2011 |date=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that his opinion was shared by the leadership of the Dutch armed forces, mentioning the name "Hankman Berman", who Sheehan added, had told him that the presence of gay soldiers at Srebrenica had sapped morale and contributed to the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0V7Or0kbqY0 |title=General Sheehan: gays responsible for Srebrenica massacre |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; General van den Breemen denied having said such a thing and called Sheehan's comments "total nonsense", Sheehan's remarks were also dismissed by the Dutch authorities as, "disgraceful" and "unworthy of a soldier".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrc.nl/international/article2507443.ece/Former_US_general__gays_make_Dutch_military_weak |title=Former US general: 'gays make Dutch military weak' |work=NRC Handelsblad |accessdate=3 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322230137/http://www.nrc.nl/international/article2507443.ece/Former_US_general__gays_make_Dutch_military_weak |archive-date=22 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ian Traynor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/19/gay-dutch-soldiers-srebrenica |title=US general: Gay Dutch soldiers caused Srebrenica massacre |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=26 May 2011 |date=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/7478738/Gay-Dutch-soldiers-responsible-for-Srebrenica-massacre-says-US-general.html |title=Gay Dutch soldiers responsible for Srebrenica massacre says US general |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=19 March 2010 |accessdate=26 May 2011 |first=Our |last=Foreign}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.javno.com/en-world/pm-slams-disgraceful-srebrenica-gay-comments/298611 |title=PM slams 'disgraceful' Srebrenica gay comments |publisher=Javno.com |date=19 March 2010 |accessdate=26 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019212358/http://dalje.com/en-world/pm-slams-disgraceful-srebrenica-gay-comments/298611 |archive-date=19 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8575717.stm |title=Dutch fury at US general's gay theory over Srebrenica |publisher=BBC News |date=19 March 2010 |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheehan apologised to Dutch military officials on 29 March 2010, withdrawing his comments and blaming instead "the rules of engagement...developed by a political system with conflicting priorities and an ambivalent understanding of how to use the military."&lt;ref&gt;[http://voices.washingtonpost.com/federal-eye/2010/03/ex-general_apologizes_for_dutc.html O'Keefe, Ed.

===Criticism of the 1995 UN Special Representative for the former Yugoslavia===
In 2005, Professor [[Arne Johan Vetlesen]] said "[[Thorvald Stoltenberg]]'s co-responsibility in Srebrenica boils down to that he through three years as a top broker contributed to create a climate—diplomatic, politic and indirectly militarily—such that [[Mladic]] calculated correctly when he figured that he could do exactly what he wanted with Srebrenica's Muslim population".&lt;ref name="aftenposten.no"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/uriks/---Stoltenberg-har-medansvar-for-Srebrenica-6363178.html|title=Stoltenberg har medansvar for Srebrenica|work=Aftenposten|date=5 August 2005|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch government report from 2002, ''[[Srebrenica: a 'safe' area]]'', criticised the choice of Stoltenberg as a mediator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.niod.knaw.nl/publications/srebrenicareportniod_en.pdf#page=753|title=Srebrenica – Reconstruction, background, consequences and analyses of the fall of a 'safe' area |page=753|author=NIOD Institute for War-, Holocaust- and Genocide Studies|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aftenposten.no"/&gt;

== Denial and scepticism ==
{{Denial of Mass Killings}}
[[Sonja Biserko]], president of the [[Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia]], and Edina Bečirević, the Faculty of Criminalistics, Criminology and Security Studies of the University of Sarajevo have pointed to a culture of denial of the Srebrenica genocide in Serbian society, taking many forms and present in particular in political discourse, the media, the law and the educational system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bosnia.org.uk/news/news_body.cfm?newsid=2638 Denial of genocide – on the possibility of normalising relations in the region] by Sonja Biserko (the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia) and Edina Bečirević (Faculty of Criminalistics, Criminology and Security Studies of the University of Sarajevo).&lt;/ref&gt;

The scepticism ranges from challenging the judicial recognition of the killings as an act of [[genocide]] to the denial of a massacre having taken place. The finding of genocide by the ICJ and the ICTY, has been disputed on evidential and theoretical grounds. The number of the dead has been questioned as has the nature of their deaths. It has been alleged that considerably fewer than 8,000 were killed and/or that most of those killed died in battle rather than by execution. It has been claimed that the interpretation of "genocide" is refuted by the survival of the women and children.&lt;ref&gt;Alternative Views

Critics, such as [[Edward S.

* [[Milorad Dodik]], President of Republika Srpska, stated in an interview with the Belgrade newspaper [[Večernje Novosti]] in April 2010 that "we cannot and will never accept qualifying that event as a genocide". Dodik disowned the 2004 Republika Srpska report acknowledging the scale of the killing and apologising to the relatives of the victims, alleging that the report had been adopted because of pressure from the international community.

* Israeli [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] scholar [[Yehuda Bauer]] described Srebrenica as "an act of mass murder, not a genocide" and stated that he could see no evidence that Serb forces intended, in whole or in part, to exterminate the Bosniaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=RTRS|title=Bauer: U Srebrenici je bilo masovno ubistvo, a ne genocide|trans-title=Srebrenica was Mass Murder, not Genocide|language=Serbian|date=29 June 2015|url=http://lat.rtrs.tv/vijesti/vijest.php?id=156685}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The director of the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] office in Israel, [[Efraim Zuroff]], also disagrees that Serb forces had genocidal intent. He explained: "As far as I know, what happened [in Srebrenica] does not [fit] the description or the definition of genocide. I think the decision to call it genocide was made for political reasons. Obviously a tragedy occurred, innocent people lost their lives and their memory should be preserved." Zuroff also called attempts to equate Srebrenica to the Holocaust "horrible" and "absurd", saying: "I wish the Nazis moved aside Jewish women and children before their bloody rampage, instead of murdering them, but that, as we know, did not happen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=B92|title=Nazi hunter: Comparing Srebrenica and Holocaust is "absurd"|date=17 June 2015|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=06&amp;dd=17&amp;nav_id=94472}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Among Muslim intellectuals, Islamic scholar [[Imran N. Hosein]] does not believe that it was genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Šejh Husein: U Srebrenici nije bilo genocida|url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/dosije/aktuelno.292.html:557338-Sejh-Husein-U-Srebrenici-nije-bilo-genocida}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ibran Mustafić]], a [[Politics of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian politician]] in the [[Party of Democratic Action]] party (SDA), claims that more than 500–1000 Bosniaks in Srebrenica were killed by Bosnian soldiers, and that the Srebrenica massacre was an "agreed genocide" between [[Alija Izetbegović]] and international powers.
* In March 2005, Miloš Milovanović, a former commander of the Serb paramilitary unit [[Serbian Guard]] who represents the [[Serbian Democratic Party (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Serbian Democratic Party]] in the [[Srebrenica]] Municipal Assembly said that "the massacre is a lie; it is propaganda to paint a bad picture of the Serbian people. The Muslims are lying; they are manipulating the numbers; they are exaggerating what happened. Far more Serbs died at Srebrenica than Muslims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vulliamy|first=Ed|title=After the massacre, a homecoming|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2005/apr/30/weekend.edvulliamy|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 April 2005|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sullivan|first=Stacy|title=The Wall of Denial|url=http://iwpr.net/report-news/wall-denial-0|newspaper=Institute for War &amp; Peace Reporting|date=5 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; VRS commander Ratko Škrbić denies that there was genocide committed in Srebrenica.

'''The Bandit Run''' is a reenactment of the journey portrayed in the 1977 film, ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]''.  The reenactment first took place on May 15, 2007 and has become an annual event.

The reenactment was the brainchild of David Hershey and Dave Hall who wanted to commemorate the 30-year anniversary of the classic film.  Hall, of the website, ''Restore a Muscle Car'' &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.restoreamusclecar.com Restore a Muscle Car] &lt;/ref&gt; and Hershey came up with the idea shortly after Hershey purchased his restored 1977 [[Pontiac Trans Am]] from him in 2006.

==2007==
Following the same route that the characters Bo "Bandit" Darville ([[Burt Reynolds]]) and Cledus "Snowman" Snow ([[Jerry Reed]]) made in the 1977 movie, a group of about 30 Trans Ams started out in [[Texarkana]] on May 15, 2007.  There, they had a send-off at the Classic Car Museum.  Both Texarkana mayors also got involved and gave a send off speech to the group.  Heading east on the three-day trip, &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.thebanditrunphotos.com/images/newsalert/banditrunmap07.pdf view 2007 map] &lt;/ref&gt; they were joined by ''[[Hot Rod Magazine]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hotrod.com/eventcoverage/hrdp_0709_bandit_pontiac_trans_am_run/index.html Smokey And The Bandit Pontiac Trans Ams - Bandit Run]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Automobile Magazine]]''.  After an evening in Tupelo, the growing group of Bandit Runners received another send-off at the Tupelo Auto Museum on May 16.  From there, they headed toward [[Birmingham, Alabama]].

There was a stop at the [[Talladega Superspeedway]], where the Bandit Runners were given a tour of the museum, a group photo and lunch.  Then, a short drive brought them to their destination, the Year One Facility, for the annual ''Year One Experience'', a three-day event.  

The group in Atlanta totaled more than 100 Trans Ams and other cars. Local and national media was there to cover the event, and the Bandit Run was featured on ''Hot Rod TV'' and the [[DIY Network]]. To finish the weekend off, local Bandit Runner Tyler H gave the group a movie location tour around Atlanta, and visited some of the movie's most famous sites.

'''Valdivia''' ({{IPA-es|balˈdiβja}}) is  a [[List of cities in Chile|city]] and [[Communes of Chile|commune]] in southern [[Chile]], administered by the Municipality of Valdivia. The city is named after its founder [[Pedro de Valdivia]] and is located at the confluence of the [[Calle-Calle River|Calle-Calle]], [[Valdivia River|Valdivia]], and [[Cau-Cau River|Cau-Cau]] Rivers, approximately {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on|sp=us}} east of the coastal towns of [[Corral, Chile|Corral]] and [[Niebla, Chile|Niebla]]. Since October 2007, Valdivia has been the capital of [[Los Ríos Region]] and is also the capital of [[Valdivia Province]]. The national census of 2002 recorded the commune of Valdivia as having 140,559 inhabitants (''Valdivianos''), of whom 127,750 were living in the city.&lt;ref name="censo"&gt;[http://www.ine.cl/cd2002/sintesiscensal.pdf "Censo 2002. .Síntesis de Resultados," Instituto Nacional de Estadísticas] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main economic activities of Valdivia include tourism, [[wood pulp]] manufacturing, forestry, metallurgy, and beer production. The city is also the home of the [[Austral University of Chile]], founded in 1954 and the [[Centro de Estudios Científicos]].

The city of Valdivia and the [[Chiloé Archipelago]] were once the two southernmost outliers of the [[Spanish Empire]]. From 1645 to 1740 the city depended directly on the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], which financed the building of the [[Valdivian fort system]] that turned Valdivia into one of the most fortified cities of the New World.&lt;ref name="unesco" &gt;{{cite web | url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1202/ | title= The Defensive Complex of Valdivia | work = Entry on the UNESCO Tentative List | accessdate = 2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the 19th century, Valdivia was the port of entry for German immigrants who [[German colonization of Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue|settled in the city and surrounding areas]].

In 1960 Valdivia was severely damaged by the [[Great Chilean earthquake]], the most powerful earthquake ever recorded at magnitude 9.5.&lt;ref name="earthquake"&gt;U.S. Geological Survey (March 7, 2006).  [https://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/world/events/1960_05_22.php Historic Earthquakes – Chile – 1960 May 22 19:11:14 UTC – Magnitude 9.5: The Largest Earthquake in the World.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007214246/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/world/events/1960_05_22.php |date=2009-10-07 }} Retrieved on 2007-01-09&lt;/ref&gt; Debris and destroyed buildings from the earthquake can still be found in the suburban areas. In addition, land subsidence and sediments have resulted in complex navigation challenges on the local rivers and in some areas, ruins of buildings are visible from the water.

{{History of Valdivia}}
{{Main|History of Valdivia}}

===Pre-Hispanic times (12,000 BC-1543)===
The area around Valdivia may have been populated since 12,000 – 11,800 [[Before Christ|BC]], according to archaeological discoveries in [[Monte Verde]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Dillehay, Tom]], ''Monteverde: A Late Pleistocene Settlement in Chile'' (Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; (less than 200&amp;nbsp;km south of Valdivia), which would place it about a thousand years before the [[Clovis culture]] in North America. This challenges the [[models of migration to the New World|"Clovis First" model of migration to the New World]]. Researchers speculate that the first inhabitants of Valdivia and Chile travelled to America by [[watercraft]] and not across a land-bridge in the [[Bering Strait]].

During at least the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Middle Archaic]], southern Chile was populated by indigenous groups who shared a common [[archaeological culture|lithic culture]] called the [[Chan-Chan|Chan-Chan Complex]], named for the archaeological site of [[Chan-Chan]] located some 35&amp;nbsp;km north of Valdivia along the coast.&lt;ref name=pino&gt;[[Mario Pino Quivira|Pino, Mario]] and Navarro, Rayen. [http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0716-02082005000100004&amp;script=sci_arttext "Geoarqueología del sitio arcaico Chan-Chan 18"] {{es icon}}. ''[[Andean Geology|Revista Geológica de Chile]]'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Expand - tell something about this culture --&gt;

By the time of the arrival of the Spanish [[conquistador]]es, Valdivia was inhabited by the [[Huilliche]] ([[Mapudungun]] for ''People of the South''). The Huilliche and [[Mapuche]] were both referred to by the Spaniards as ''Araucanos''. Their main language was a variant of Mapudungun, the Mapuche language.

A large village called ''Ainil'' stood where present-day downtown Valdivia has been developed. The Huilliche called the river, ''Ainilebu'' (now known as the Valdivia River). ''Ainil'' seemed to have been an important trade center; it was a port on the sea and had access to the interior via the network of the [[Río Cruces|Cruces]] and [[Calle-Calle River|Calle-Calle]] rivers, both tributaries of the Valdivia. ''Ainil'' may be described as "a kind of little [[Venice]]," as it had large areas of wetlands and canals. Since that period, most of these waterways and wetlands have been drained or filled. The market in ''Ainil'' received [[shellfish]] and [[fish]] from the coast, [[legume]]s from [[Punucapa]], and other foods from [[San José de la Mariquina]], an agricultural zone northeast of Valdivia.&lt;ref name="darwin"/&gt; A remnant of this ancient trade is the modern ''Feria Fluvial'' (English: Riverside Market) on the banks of Valdivia River. The surroundings of Valdivia were described as extensive plains having a large population that cultivated [[potatoes]], [[maize]], [[quinoa]] and [[legumes]], among other crops.&lt;ref name="marino"&gt;Mariño de Lobera, Pedro, ''Crónica del reino de Chile, Colección de historiadores de Chile, Imprenta del Ferrocarril, 1865. Available in www.memoriachilena.cl&lt;/ref&gt; The population has been estimated by some historians as 30 to 40 thousand inhabitants as of 1548,&lt;ref&gt;[[Gabriel Guarda|Guarda, Gabriel]]. ''Nueva historia de Valdivia'' (Editorial Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; based on descriptions made by the conquistadors. [[Pedro Mariño de Lobera]], an early conquistador and [[chronicler]], wrote that there were half a million Indians living within ten [[League (unit)#Spain|leagues]] (one league is roughly 4.2&amp;nbsp;km) from the city.&lt;ref name=marino/&gt; Other historians consider these numbers too high and argue that early Spaniards usually exaggerated in their descriptions.

Later the British naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] observed that "there is not much cleared land near Valdivia."&lt;ref name="darwin"/&gt; This suggests that pre-Hispanic agriculture in Valdivia was far more extensive than the agriculture practiced in the early 19th century at the time of his visit.

[[File:Juan Bautista Pastene.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Idealized illustration of [[Juan Bautista Pastene|Pastene]] from [[Alonso de Ovalle]]'s "Histórica relación del Reyno de Chile"]]

The first European to visit [[Corral Bay|Valdivia River's estuary]] was the [[Genoa|Genoese]] captain [[Juan Bautista Pastene]], who took possession of it in 1544 in the name of the Spanish king, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. He named the river after the Governor of Chile [[Pedro de Valdivia]].&lt;ref name=BHV/&gt;

Pedro de Valdivia later travelled by land to the river described by Pastene, and founded the city of Valdivia in 1552 as ''Santa María la Blanca de Valdivia''.&lt;ref name=BHV/&gt; It was the southernmost Spanish settlement in the Americas at the time of the founding. Following the establishment of the church of ''Santa María la Blanca'' in Valdivia, more buildings were constructed. [[Mariño de Lobera]] described it as "the second city in the [[Kingdom of Chile]]".&lt;ref name=marino/&gt; Many of Chile's most influential conquistadors and future governors were granted land in Valdivia, such as [[Jerónimo de Alderete]], [[Rodrigo de Quiroga]], [[Francisco de Villagra|Francisco]] and [[Pedro de Villagra]], apart from the proper Pedro de Valdivia.

[[Jerónimo de Vivar|Jerónimo de Bibar]], a chronicler who witnessed the founding wrote:&lt;ref name="Vivar"&gt;[[Jerónimo de Vivar]] – Crónica y relación copiosa y verdadera de los reynos de Chile – Ended in 1558. Transcription of Irving Leonard published by ''Fondo Histórico y Bibliográfico José Toribio Medina'', Santiago de Chile, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"Having the governor seen such good [[comarca]] and site for populate a city and riverside of such good river, and having such good harbour he founded a city and named it ''ciudad de Valdivia'', and he assigned [[Alcalde]]s and a [[town council]]."}}

After Pedro de Valdivia's death, the war with the [[Mapuche]]s, called the [[War of Arauco]], continued. The Spanish made many attempts to defeat the Mapuche and defend the cities and forts built on their territory. On March 17 of 1575 the city was damaged by [[1575 Valdivia earthquake|a massive earthquake]]. It has since been likened to the [[Great Chilean earthquake]] of 1960 in terms of damage.&lt;ref name="BHV"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.buscalibros.cl/libros.php?c=226 | year = 1971 | publisher = Editorial Francisco de Aguirre |title= Breve Historia de Valdivia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1575 the Huilliche of Valdivia did not organize any notable resistance against the Spanish. They had fought as ''[[Indios amigos]]'' with the Spanish against the northern Mapuche in the Arauco War.  But that year 4,000 Indians who had been fighting in Martín Ruiz de Gamboa's army rebelled after returning to the area of Valdivia.

[[File:Pedro de Valdivia.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Picture of [[Pedro de Valdivia]], conquistador of Chile and founder of Valdivia]]

During the 16th century, the economy of Valdivia was sustained by trade in agricultural products from nearby areas and by the coining and export of [[placer deposit|placer]] [[gold]] from [[Villarrica, Chile|Villarrica]], [[Madre de Dios Mine|Madre de Dios]] and [[Osorno, Chile|Osorno]]. In Lima and the restof Chile, people referred to all the gold from these sources as "''gold from Valdivia.''" Many merchants of Lima had envoys in Valdivia, and the city developed a large ship building industry. It produced the largest ships in the [[Kingdom of Chile]].

After the demoralising [[Battle of Curalaba]] in 1598, in which the Mapuche killed [[governor of Chile|governor]] [[Martín García Óñez de Loyola|Óñez de Loyola]], the Mapuche and Huilliche made a mass rebellion. The Indians destroyed or forced the abandonment of all the Spanish settlements and forts in their lands, in what came to be known as the [[Destruction of the Seven Cities]]. On the morning of 24 November 1599, the Huilliche attacked the city and massacred its inhabitants, some few being rescued by the ships in the harbour. The border of the Spanish Empire shifted north of the [[Bío-Bío River]]. Valdivia was re-established but it was a Spanish enclave surrounded by native Huilliche territory. Together with [[Castro, Chile]] on the island of [[Chiloé Island|Chiloé]], it was one of the southernmost colonies of the Empire.

Eleven days after the first destruction of Valdivia, a group of 270 Spanish soldiers arrived from Perú.&lt;ref name=BHV/&gt; The commander of the troops, colonel Francisco del Campo was convinced that the city of Valdivia needed to be repopulated. After Francisco del Campo's expedition left, the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] corsair Sebastian de Cordes occupied the site of Valdivia for some months, giving the Dutch government information about this abandoned part of the Spanish Empire. The Spaniards returned on 13 March 1602, when captain Francisco Hernández Ortiz established a fort on the ruins of the city. On September 24 natives attacked the fort unsuccessfully, but laid siege. The Spaniards could not acquire food or supplies, and on 3 February 1604 abandoned the fort, with the last starving survivors rescued by ship.

The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] governor of the [[East Indies]] [[Hendrik Brouwer]], learned about the situation in Valdivia, and decided to establish a base there for further attacks against the Viceroy of Peru.  This plan was well accepted as the Netherlands was at war with Spain.  The Dutch had previously taken the North of [[Brazil]] from the [[Iberian Union|Spanish-Portuguese crown]], and the idea of creating a South American empire was attractive.  In spite of his advanced age, Hendrik Brouwer left his post as governor in the East Indies to personally lead the expedition.  The Dutch fleet destroyed the Fort of [[Carelmapu]] and the city of [[Castro, Chile|Castro]] before arriving at [[Corral Bay]] at the mouth of the Valdivia River.  Hendrik Brouwer died the 7th of August in [[Puerto Inglés]] while waiting for better winds to sail north to Valdivia.  [[John Maurice of Nassau]] while in charge of the Dutch part of Brazil had equipped the expedition and had secretly appointed Elias Herckman as commander if Brouwer died.  Herckman finally occupied the ruins of Valdivia in 1643, renaming it '''Brouwershaven'''. The Dutch did not find the gold mines they expected and the hostility of the natives forced them to leave on 28 October 1643.&lt;ref name=BHV/&gt;

[[File:Torreon23.jpg|thumb|250px|Image of Torreón El Canelo restored in the 1850s. It is one of two remaining Spanish towers in Valdivia used to defend the city and one of the few remaining colonial structures]]

[[Pedro Álvarez de Toledo y Leiva]] Viceroy of Peru (1639–1648) knew of the strategic importance of Valdivia and decided to repopulate and fortify it once for all.  He financed partly the expedition to repopulate Valdivia with his own capital.&lt;ref name=BHV/&gt;  The contingent in charge of the mission was organized in Peru and consisted of seventeen ships filled with building materials and supplies that astounded  contemporaries by its magnitude.&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt; The local government of Chile could not secure Valdivia as it was engaged in continuous war with the Mapuches and was deeply dependent on the [[Real Situado]], an annual payment of silver from [[Potosí]] to finance the army of Chile. The Valdivia enclave was placed directly under the control of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] that administered Valdivia from its repopulation in 1645 until 1740.&lt;ref name=BHV/&gt; [[Corral, Chile|Corral]], located on the river entrance to Valdivia, became [[Valdivian Fort System|one of the most fortified bay at the time]],&lt;ref name="unesco"/&gt; with 17 forts. During this time it was several times proposed to move the city of Valdivia to [[Mancera Island]]. Valdivia's original site, downtown of modern Valdivia was repopulated in 1684.

Beginning in the mid-18th century Valdivia left behind its past as an enclave and a period of agricultural expansion begun. The expansion, that mainly directed to the south, was done mostly by pacific means, but hostilities with indigenous Huilliches did occur. After the Valdivian colonization had reached [[Bueno River]] Spanish authorities pushed for connecting the city of Valdivia with the settlements at [[Chacao Channel]] by a road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Couyoumdjian |first=Juan Ricardo |date=2009 |title=Reseña de "La frontera de arriba en Chile colonial.

===Independence and growth (1811–1959)===

Self-governing juntas appeared in [[Spanish America]] and Spain after [[Napoleon]] occupied Spain and held the Spanish king [[Fernando VII]] captive. Many juntas, as was the case of Chile, declared plans to rule their territory in the absence of the legitimate king. At the time of the first governing junta of [[Chile]] in 1810 the Valdivian governor, an [[Irishman]], Albert Alexander Eagar, led the celebration of what was seen as an affirmation of the legitimacy of the Spanish king. However, Valdivian independentists, such as [[Camilo Henríquez]], saw an opportunity to gain absolute independence from Spain, organized a coup on 1 November 1811, and joined other Chilean cities that were already revolting against the old order.&lt;ref name=BHV/&gt; Four months after the coup, on 16 March 1812 a counterrevolutionary coup took control of the city and created a War Council. The War Council broke trade relations with the rest of Chile and confirmed Valdivia's loyalty to the Spanish government.&lt;ref name=BHV/&gt;

Even after several defeats of the Spanish troops during the [[Chilean Independence War]], Valdivia and [[Chiloé Island|Chiloé]] remained loyal to the Spanish King. By 1820 the newly created [[Chilean Navy]], commanded by [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Thomas Cochrane]], [[Capture of Valdivia|captured Valdivia]], but failed to liberate Chiloé. Cochrane's land-based attack took the Spanish by surprise, avoiding a direct confrontation with the highly defended forts at the entrance to the Valdivia River. When loyal troops in Valdivia heard the news about the fall of Corral they sacked the city and fled south to reinforce Chiloé, passing by [[Osorno, Chile|Osorno]].&lt;ref name=BHV/&gt;

[[File:CamiloHenríquez.JPG|thumb|Friar [[Camilo Henríquez]] born in Valdivia was one of the [[founding father]]s of the Republic of Chile]]

Chilean Supreme Director, and [[Libertadores|Libertador]], [[Bernardo O'Higgins]] founded the city of [[La Unión, Chile|La Unión]] south of Valdivia in 1821, to secure the way to Osorno, a city that had been repopulated in 1796 by his father [[Ambrosio O'Higgins]]. Valdivia had been a province of the [[Kingdom of Chile|General Captaincy of Chile]] and was in 1826 incorporated as one of the eight provinces of Chile.&lt;ref name=BHV/&gt;

On February 20, 1835, Valdivia was affected by the worst earthquake in the area in several decades, an event witnessed by [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref name="darwin"&gt;{{gutenberg|no=3704|name=The Voyage of the Beagle ''by Charles Darwin'}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that ''"there is not much cleared land near Valdivia"''&lt;ref name="darwin"/&gt; which contrasted with the description made by early Spaniards of large fields and extensive croplands.

The expansion and economic development of the city were limited in the early 19th century. To jump-start economic development, the Chilean government initiated a highly focussed immigration program under [[Bernhard Eunom Philippi]] and later [[Vicente Pérez Rosales]] as government agents. Through this program, thousands of [[Germans]] settled in the area, incorporating then-modern technology and know-how to develop agriculture and industry. While immigrants that arrived to the [[Llanquihue Province|Llanquihue]] area were often poor farmers, Valdivia received more educated immigrants, including political exiles and merchants. Some of the immigrants that arrived in Valdivia established workshops and built new industries. One of the most famous immigrants was [[Carlos Anwandter]], an exile from [[Luckenwalde]] who arrived in Valdivia in 1850 and in 1858 founded Chile's first German school. Other Germans left the city and became settlers, drawn by the promise of free land. They were often given forested land, which they cleared to turn into farms.&lt;ref&gt;Otero, Luis, La Huella del Fuego: Historia de los bosques y cambios en el paisaje del sur de  Chile (Valdivia, Editorial Pehuen)&lt;/ref&gt; Native [[Mapuche]] and [[Huilliche]] either sold their land or were pushed into [[Reservation (Chile)|reservation]]s. The Osorno department of Valdivia Province was moved to [[Llanquihue Province]] (created in 1853) as consequence of German immigration to the Llaquihue area.

Valdivia prospered with industries, including shipyards, the Hoffmann [[gristmill]], the Rudloff shoe factory, the Anwandter beer company and many more. The [[steel mill]]s of [[Corral, Chile|Corral]] were the largest recorded private investment in Chile at the time, and were the first steel mills in [[South America]]. In 1891 Valdivia became a [[Communes of Chile|commune]] according to a law that created such subdivisions. After the [[Malleco Viaduct]] was built in 1890 the railroads advanced further south, reaching Valdivia in 1895. The first passenger train arrived in 1899. In 1909 a fire destroyed 18 [[city block]]s in downtown Valdivia,&lt;ref name=BHV/&gt; which were rebuilt with modern concrete buildings. By 1911 lumber production, from clearing of native forests, became the most important industry. Cattle-raising was a growing industry, and wheat was grown on the cleared lands. Lumber, cattle, leather, flour and beer were exported. In 1895 the city's population was 8,062 inhabitants and was estimated at 9,704 in 1902.

The economic prosperity of Valdivia continued throughout the first half of the 20th century. In 1917 the first "Valdivian Week" (Spanish: ''Semana Valdiviana'') was celebrated. Chile's oldest beauty contest, "Queen of The Rivers" (Spanish: ''Reina de Los Ríos'') began the same year. The city evolved as an early tourist center in Chile, while popular songs that named Valdivia and the [[Calle-Calle River]] made it better known in Chilean popular culture. The [[Pedro de Valdivia Bridge]] crossing the Valdivia River was built in 1954. Valdivia came to be one of the most important industrial centers in Chile together with the capital [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]] and the main port city, [[Valparaíso]].

The commercial and human flux Valdivia suffered two setbacks in the early 20th century, first the connection of [[Osorno, Chile|Osorno]] by railroad to central Chile which meant that Valdivia lost the quality of being the port that connected Osono to [[Central Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mingaonline.uach.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0718-64281998000200006&amp;lng=es&amp;nrm=iso Investigación aplicada sobre Geografía Urbana: Un caso práctico en la ciudad de Valdivia] Víctor Figueroa, Jorge  Gayoso, Edgardo  Oyarzun, Lenia  Planas[[Gestion Turistica]], [[UACh]].&lt;/ref&gt; Later on 1911 the opening of the [[Panama Canal]] meant a decrease in ship traffic all over Chile since ships travelling from the north Atlantic to north Pacific no longer had to pass through the [[Straits of Magellan]] or visit any Chilean port.

===Great Chilean earthquake and Los Lagos Region (1960–2006)===
[[File:Valdivia after earthquake, 1960.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A street in Valdivia after the [[Great Chilean earthquake|earthquake]] of 22 May 1960]]
{{See also|Great Chilean earthquake|Riñihuazo|Los Ríos Region}}

On May 22, 1960, Chile suffered the most powerful earthquake ever recorded, rating 9.5&lt;ref name="earthquake"/&gt; on the [[moment magnitude scale]], with Valdivia being the most affected city. The earthquake generated devastating [[tsunami]]s that affected Japan and [[Hawaii]]. Spanish-colonial [[Valdivian Fort System|forts around Valdivia]] were severely damaged, while soil subsidence destroyed buildings, deepened local rivers, and created wetlands of the [[Río Cruces]] y Chorocomayo – a new aquatic park north of the city.

Large sections of the city flooded after the earthquake, and a landslide near the [[Tralcán]] Mount [[riñihuazo|dammed the Riñihue Lake]]. Water levels in Lake Riñihue rose more than {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}, raising the danger of a catastrophic break and of destroying everything downriver. Government authorities drew plans for evacuating the city, but many people left on their own. Danger to the city was reduced after a large team of workers opened a drainage channel in the landslide; water levels of the lake slowly returned to normal levels. There is evidence that a similar landslide and earthquake happened in 1575.&lt;ref name=BHV/&gt;

The [[1973 Chilean coup d'état]] and the military's actions that followed brought dozens of detainees to Valdivia and saw the imposing of a nationwide [[curfew]]. In October a group of 12 young men, among them [[José Gregorio Liendo]], were brought from the [[Complejo Forestal y Maderero Panguipulli]] in the Andes to be executed in Valdivia by [[firing squad]] due to alleged participation in the [[Neltume#History|assault on Neltume police station]] and "guerrilla activities".

After the Great Chilean earthquake Valdivia's economy and political status declined. Much of the city was destroyed and many inhabitants left. By 1974, the military junta reorganized the political divisions of Chile and declared Valdivia a province of the [[Los Lagos Region]] with [[Puerto Montt]] as the regional capital. Many Valdivians resented the decision, and felt theirs should have been the legitimate regional capital—while Valdivia was founded in 1552, and had resisted [[Corral Bay Forts|pirate attacks]], [[Arauco War|hostile natives]] and several earthquakes, Puerto Montt was a relatively new city founded only in 1853 (three hundred and one years later).

Since the liberalization of the economy in Chile in the 1980s the forestry sector in Valdivia boomed, first by exporting wood chips to Japan from [[Corral, Chile|Corral]] and then by producing [[woodpulp]] in Mariquina (50&amp;nbsp;km northeast of Valdivia). This led to deforestation and substitution of native [[Valdivian temperate rainforests]] to plant pines and [[eucalyptus]], but also created new jobs for people with limited education. Valdivia also benefitted from the development of [[salmon]] [[aquaculture]] in the 1990s, but to a much lesser extent than places such as [[Puerto Montt]] and Chiloé.

==Culture==
[[File:Regiondelosrios.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Picture of [[Michelle Bachelet]]'s visit to Valdivia in 2007 in which she confirmed the creation of [[Los Ríos Region]]]]

Valdivia is often promoted for its unique characteristics, that make it different from other cities in Chile: Valdivia has an early Spanish colonial past, plus a later history of German colonization. Both eras left visible landmarks such as the [[Valdivian Fort System|forts of Corral Bay]] and the German-style wood houses. The governments of Spain and Germany currently maintain honorary [[consul (representative)|consul]]ates in Valdivia. The city is commonly seen as a tourist magnet in Chile, and sometimes described as ''La Perla del Sur'' (''The Pearl of the South'') and as ''La ciudad mas linda de Chile'' (''Chile's most beautiful city'').
Every year during the summer months of January and February the municipality organizes many free cultural events along the river site, such as concerts, sporting events, and other entertainment. To mark and celebrate the end of the touristic summer months, halfway through February all entertainment reaches its climax with the celebration of ''noche Valdiviana'' (Valdivian night). During this night many local groups and communities present themselves on boats during a night parade over the river. Every boat has its own theme related with one theme of that year. At the end a jury picks the winners in different categories. The parade is by tradition started by a boat which presents ''la reina de los ríos''. In recent years Valdivians have showed an increasing interest in nature and [[ecotourism]]. An example of this was the formation of ''[[Acción por los Cisnes]]'' an ecologist group formed to protect black-necked swans and the natural environment that surrounds the city, particularly wetlands created or expanded by the [[Great Chilean earthquake]]. With the founding of [[Southern University of Chile|Universidad Austral]] in 1954 and the arrival of the [[Centro de Estudios Científicos|CECS]] research center, Valdivia is now considered a major research center in Chile, particularly in areas related to nature such a [[glaciology]] and [[ecology]]. The [[Great Chilean earthquake]] and the national government's creation of the  [[Los Lagos Region]] were difficult for Valdivian society. Valdivians resented to be punished first by a major earthquake and then by being placed under the administration of what they perceived to be a less-deserving city, [[Puerto Montt]]. The recent creation of a new, smaller, but more independent region (Los Ríos), with Valdivia as its capital, reduced the previous stigma.

Valdivia's varied influences are reflected by its multicultural [[toponym]]s that include placenames of [[Mapudungun|Mapuche]], Spanish, [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]] and German origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bernales Lillo |first=Mario |date=1984 |title=Aspectos diacrónicos en la toponimia de Valdivia  |url=http://www.anales.uchile.cl/index.php/ANUC/article/viewFile/23061/24411 |journal=[[Anales de la Universidad de Chile]] |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=79–94 |doi= |access-date=|language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish colonial influences===
During much of the colonial period, Valdivia was essentially a military camp, a walled city surrounded by hostile natives. The coastal defenses and their garrisons made up a large part of the population. After several fires and earthquakes, nearly all buildings from this period were destroyed, with the exception of the military defenses. Valdivia's best known historical landmarks are now the two towers which were part of a former city wall, built by the Spaniards to defend the city, known as ''Torreones'': [[Torreón Los Canelos]] and [[Torreón del Barro]].

===German influences===
Since the first [[German people|Germans]] migrated to Valdivia in the mid-1840s, German cultural influence has been visible in the city. Germans in Valdivia settled mostly in the [[Isla Teja]] and [[Collico]] suburban areas. Until the building of [[Pedro de Valdivia Bridge]], inhabitants of [[Isla Teja]] lived isolated from the city, where it was common that children first learned to speak [[German language|German]] before Spanish. Nowadays the [[German language]] is preserved by the ''[[Instituto Alemán Carlos Anwandter]]'' one of [[Latin America]]'s oldest German schools. German descendants also form Valdivia's oldest fire station ''Germania,'' located in Isla Teja.

German immigrants and their descendants formed their social club ''Club Alemán,'' which after [[World War II]] changed names to ''Club la Unión''. German workers once had their own club simply called ''El Alemán'' (The German).

Valdivia also hosts ''Bierfest Valdivia'', a celebration that could be described as a small, regional [[Oktoberfest]], despite being celebrated in late January or February of every year (during the local summer, when there is the largest influx of tourists). The main sponsor and organizer is [[Kunstmann]], a local [[beer]] company, founded by German nationals, but since bought out by the largest beer and beverages company in Chile (CCU).

==Demography==
According to the 2002 [[census]] of the [[National Statistics Institute (Chile)|National Statistics Institute]], the commune of Valdivia spans an area of {{convert|1015.6|sqkm|0|abbr=on|sp=us}} and has 140,559 inhabitants (68,510 men and 72,049 women). Of these, 129,952 (92.5%) lived in [[urban area]]s and 10,607 (7.5%) in [[rural area]]s. Between the 1992 and 2002 censuses, the population grew by 15.1% (18,391 persons).&lt;ref name="INE"/&gt;

&lt;!--===Arts and Scientific research===
The Southern University of Chile ([[Universidad Austral de Chile]], UACh), one of the original eight Chilean state universities, has its main campus in Valdivia. In the last decade Valdivia gained  prestige as an important cultural and scientific venue: the [[Valdivia International Film Festival|Valdivia Film Festival]] became the most important in Chile, and the [[Centro de Estudios Científicos]] (CECS) is now housed in the recently modernized, German-style hotel Schuster located by the Valdivia River.

The city is surrounded by many nature reserves and large areas of forest plantations, wetlands and [[Valdivian temperate rainforest]] that, together with the numerous rivers that circle the city, have heightened the residents' awareness of living close to nature.

===Trivia===
In addition to being known as ''the City of Rivers'', Valdivia has also been called ''The pearl of the South,''  ''The key of the South seas'', ''Gibraltar of the Pacific'',  and ''Chile's most beautiful city''. The nickname ''Valdilluvia'' is a mix of the Spanish word for rain – ''lluvia'' and Valdivia referring to the rainy climate of the city.--&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Txu-oclc-224571178-sj18-16.jpg|250px|thumb|Map of Valdivia and its surroundings]]

The geography of the Valdivia area consists of wetlands and alluvial terraces. Several rivers, such as [[Cau-Cau River|Cau-Cau]], [[Calle-Calle River|Calle-Calle]] and [[Cruces River|Cruces]], join near the city forming the larger [[Valdivia River]]. Valdivia River in turn empties to [[Corral Bay]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]] just some 15&amp;nbsp;km west of Valdivia. This river network made Valdivia a trade center even since [[Pre-Hispanic]] times. The city itself was built on a riverine terrace but expanded later over adjacent wetlands. Nowadays the city is virtually surrounded by hills by all sides except north where Valdivia's lowlands connect to the flatlands of San José de la Mariquina. Some hilly areas around Valdivia are covered with exotic forest species such as [[Douglas-fir]], ''[[Pinus radiata]]'' and ''[[Eucalyptus globulus]]''. Other places are used for recreational purposes or conservation of native ecosystems. Additional Northern Hemisphere exotic trees such as [[birch]], [[horsechestnut]] and [[Populus|poplar]] are common in residential areas. [[Palm (plant)|Palms]] are occasional.

===Geology===
{{see also|Bahía Mansa Metamorphic Complex|Santo Domingo Formation}}
Within the context of [[plate tectonics]] the city lies at a [[Convergent boundary|convergent margin]] where [[Nazca Plate]] in the Pacific is [[subduction|subducted]] beneath the [[South American Plate]]. Topographically Valdivia lies in a depression amidst the [[Chilean Coast Range]]. The [[basement (geology)|basement rocks]] that crops out in the hills around the city are of [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic type]]. The city itself is chiefly built upon terraces made up of hardened [[volcano|volcanic]] [[sand]]. This volcanic sandstone is known as "cancagua" and deposited during the late [[Pleistocene|Pleistocene epoch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vega |first1=Rodrgo |last2=Mella |first2=Mauricio|last3=Nielsen |first3=Sven N. |last4=Pino |first4=Mario|author-link4=Mario Pino Quivira |date=2018 |title=Stratigraphy and sedimentology of a late Pleistocene incised valley fill: a depositional and paleogeographic model for "Cancagua" deposits in north-western Patagonia, Chile |url=http://www.andeangeology.cl/index.php/revista1/article/view/V45n2-3030/html |journal=[[Andean Geology]] |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=161–185 |doi=10.5027/andgeoV45n2-3030 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As terraces took shape during the [[interglacial]] preceding the [[Llanquihue glaciation]] —the [[last glacial period]]— this interglacial is known in Chile as the [[Eemian|Valdivia interglacial]].&lt;ref&gt;Astorga, G. and [[Mario Pino Quivira|Pino, M]].

A [[tectonic]]ally and [[eustatic]]ally stable period during the [[Oligocene]] and Early [[Miocene]] allowed erosion to create deep valleys in the Coast Range and peat swamps at what is now the [[estuary]] of the Valdivia basin. About 23.5 million years ago this stable period was interrupted by a major [[volcanic eruption]] and 23 mya ago an increase in convergence rate at the [[Peru–Chile Trench]] caused an uplift of the landscape and renewed erosion. However basin [[subsidence]] and a marine [[transgression (geology)|transgression]] formed deep embayments, [[tidal flats]], bayhead deltas and beaches.
&lt;!--
The city of Valdivia is situated above a sedimentary plain inside the [[Valdivian Coast Range]] (part of the larger [[Chilean Coast Range]]). The [[Cruces Rivers|Cruces]] and [[Calle-Calle River]]s penetrates from north respectively east. At the site of Valdivia they give origin to he range and reach the plains of Valdivia before turning west to [[Corral Bay]]. The backbone of the Valdivian Coast Range is the [[Bahía Mansa Metamorphic Complex]] which is a [[forearc]] high at the [[subduction]] front made of [[schist]]. Valdivia is above a sedimentary plain surrounded by low mountains of the coast range. Part of the sediments are [[volcaniclastic]] material such as [[clay]]s from the last [[interglacial]] period. Much of the sediments were carried as far as from the [[Andes]].&lt;ref name="jara"&gt;[http://www2.sernageomin.cl/pto_varas/Biblioteca/Articulos.pdf/JARA1.pdf Usos actuales y potenciales de los depositos sedimentarios del ultimo interglacial en Valdivia, X region, Chile] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Valdivia's agricultural land corresponds to sedimentary deposits of the [[quaternary]].

Forested ranges of the Valdivian Coast Range surrounds Valdivia's plain by all side except to the north where the plain connects to Mariquina's agricultural flatlands through the wetlands of Cruces River. Valdivia lost a considerable surface of arable land, as a result of the [[Great Chilean earthquake]], because the soil surface went down {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}, creating and expanding existing wetlands and swamps. Many of the city's buildings are built over former wetlands and lagoons making their foundations unstable.

==Climate==
Valdivia has a [[temperate climate|temperate]] rainy climate with [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] influences.&lt;ref name="dmch"&gt;[http://www.meteochile.cl/climas/climas_decima_region.html Dirección Meteorológica de Chile] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In short Valdivia features an [[oceanic climate]] with a distinct drying trend during the summer. A similar climate is found on the windward side of the [[Olympic Mountains]] in the Pacific Northwest region of [[North America]]. The natural vegetation is the [[Valdivian temperate rainforest]].

During the summer months (December, January and February) the average temperature is about {{convert|17|C|F|0}}, while in winter the temperature descends to {{convert|8.5|C|F|1}}. The annual average temperature for [[Los Ríos Region]] is {{convert|11|C|F|0}}, while the mean temperature amplitude is 8.8&amp;nbsp;°C (47.8&amp;nbsp;°F) and the daily is 11&amp;nbsp;°C (51.8&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name="dmch"/&gt; Average annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is {{convert|2500|mm|in|-1|sp=us}}, distributed through the year, but primarily between March and October. Hail occurs with some frequency during winter, but snow falls rarely. The last times it snowed in Valdivia were in July 2007 and in August 1995 during the so-called ''[[White Earthquake|Terremoto Blanco]]'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for White Earthquake). The [[Seven Lakes (Chile)|Seven Lakes]] in the interior help to keep an average relative humidity of 80% for the region as whole and there are no months with less than 75% average humidity.&lt;ref name="dmch"/&gt; The precipitation is generated by [[frontal system]]s that cross the zone, which produce cloudiness and few clear days.&lt;ref name="dmch"/&gt; The [[leeward]] effect of the [[Valdivian Coast Range]] is minimal due to its low height (715 m at [[Cerro Oncol]]) and the gap in the range at [[Valdivia River]]'s outflow to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. {{clear}}

==Government and politics==
The commune of Valdivia is a third-level [[administrative division of Chile]] governed by a directly elected [[mayor]] (''[[alcalde]]'') and a [[municipal council]] (''consejales''). The city's current mayor is Omar Sabat Guzmán, a member of [[Independent Democratic Union|Independiente UDI]], a right wing conservative party.

Within the [[electoral divisions of Chile]], Valdivia is represented in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Chamber of Deputies]] by Alfonso De Urresti ([[Socialist Party of Chile|PS]]) and Roberto Delmastro (RN) as part of the 53rd electoral district, (together with [[Lanco, Chile|Lanco]], [[San José de la Mariquina|Mariquina]], [[Máfil]] and [[Corral, Chile|Corral]]). The commune is represented in the [[Senate of Chile|Senate]] by [[Andrés Allamand]] (founder of National Renewal Party) and former president [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]] ([[Christian Democratic Party|PDC]]) as part of the 16th senatorial constituency (Los Ríos Region). Neither senator is native to Valdivia.

The creation of [[Los Ríos Region]] and [[Environmentalism|environmental]] issues have dominated the politic scene of Valdivia in recent years. The communist lawyer Wladimir Riesco headed the legal actions against pulp mill enterprise [[CELCO]] after the deaths of  [[black-necked swan]]s in [[Carlos Anwandter Nature Sanctuary]] in 2004.

===Ecological action===
In response to the alleged contamination of Cruces River by the [[Celulosa Arauco y Constitución|Celco]] cellulose pulp mill, a group of citizens formed the  ''Accion por los Cisnes'' (''Action for the Swans'') ecology group. Action for the Swans attracted the attention of the national newspapers and succeeded in temporarily closing down [[Valdivia Pulp Mill]] through a court order.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes List of Billionaires 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy and tourism==
The city and commune of Valdivia rely heavily on [[silviculture]], the [[pulp and paper industry]] and other forestry-related activities (the harvesting and processing of wood from nearby plantations of [[Eucalyptus globulus|eucalyptus]] and [[Douglas fir]]s). Large businesses such as [[CELCO]], [[Bomasil]] and [[Louisiana-Pacific]] have established wood processing factories near Valdivia. [[Metallurgy]], [[naval construction]] and repairs are also important industries, with the companies of [[Asenav]] and [http://www.alwoplast.com Alwoplast] based in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inelosrios.cl/archivos/files/pdf/SistemaEstadisticoRegional/Los%20R%C3%ADos%20en%20Cifras_V4_Diciembre_2010(1).pdf INSTITUTO NACIONAL DE ESTADÍSTICAS DIRECCIÓN REGIONAL DE LOS RÍOS] {{es icon}} INSTITUTO NACIONAL DE ESTADÍSTICAS DIRECCIÓN REGIONAL DE LOS RÍOS.

===Tourism===
{{see also|Ecotourism in the Valdivian Temperate Rainforest}}
Valdivia is a historic tourist destination in Chile, valued for the beauty of the city and surrounding areas, the area's culture and its history. It is an all season city, but during the summer months in particular (December, January, February) tourism is a major source of income for Valdivia's economy. "Valdivian Week" (Spanish: ''Semana Valdiviana''), as it has been known since 1917, is a long-held tradition that dates back to the foundation of the city. Starting  February 9 each year,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.munivaldivia.cl/www/municipal_valdivia/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1390&amp;Itemid=803&amp;lang=es CULTURA E IDENTIDAD DE VALDIVIA] {{es icon}}. munivaldivia.cl. Retrieved February 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; it commemorates the city's anniversary and also gives Valdivia the chance to promote itself as a tourism center. "Semana Valdiviana" features an allegorical parade of ships – a tradition that began in the seventeenth century as a protest against the Spaniard authorities – and also includes a big artisan market, fairground rides, and the election of the "queen" of [[Los Rios region|Los Rios]]. The week ends with [[Pyrotechnics|fireworks]] and theatre performances on the closing night, known as "Noche Valdiviana" (Valdivian Night).
The center of the city has a rich architectural heritage. One of its most visited buildings is the "Mercado Municipal" ("municipal market"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valdivia.cl/chile/valdivia_turismo/Mercado_de_Valdivia.shtml Mercado Municipal de Valdivia]&lt;/ref&gt; a local produce market that is also now a gastronomic and cultural attraction. Also popular are the "Convento San Francisco" (Saint Francis Convent) and the European-style buildings dating back to the beginning of the 20th century, used today by the city's universities, cultural centers and government.

==Education==
===Universities and colleges===
Valdivia is home to several public and private [[school]]s and [[university|universities]]. The largest and oldest university is the [[Universidad Austral de Chile]] (UACh) that was founded by decree in 1954 as one of Chile's seven original [[Chilean Traditional Universities]]. Its main campus is located in [[Isla Teja]] but it has other minor campus and properties spread through the city and [[Zona Sur|southern Chile]]. Since the liberalization of higher education in Chile in the 1980s other universities have established campuses in Valdivia, including [[Universidad Arturo Prat]], [[Universidad San Sebastián]], [[Universidad Santo Tomás]] and [[Universidad de Los Lagos]].

===Schools===
Like in the rest of Chile, most of Valdivia's best schools are private. [[Instituto Alemán Carlos Anwandter]] (Deutsche Schule Valdivia) founded in 1858 is Chile's second oldest German school after the Instituto Alemán de Osorno (1854). Other notable private schools are [[Windsor School, Chile|Windsor School]] and Colegio San Luis de Alba. Among public schools [[Instituto Salesiano de Valdivia]], [[Liceo Rector Armando Robles Rivera]] and [[Liceo Comercial]] have reached good results.

==Sports==
Facilities for playing [[association football|football]], [[tennis]], [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[golf]], indoor [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], indoor and outdoor [[basketball]] and some other sports are available throughout the area. Rowing is practiced in Valdivia in three clubs: Club Deportivo Phoenix Valdivia, Club Centenario de Remeros and Club Arturo Prat. Valdivian rowers [[Cristian Yantani]] and [[Miguel Cerda]] won the first place in Men's Lightweight Coxless Pair-Oared Shells at the world championship in [[Seville]], 2002.&lt;ref name="sevilla"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hickoksports.com/history/worldrowing.shtml |title=World Rowing Medalists |access-date=2012-12-05 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121205021902/http://www.hickoksports.com/history/worldrowing.shtml#mdsculls |archive-date=2012-12-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Club Deportivo Valdivia]] is Valdivia's main basketball team and plays in Chiles first division, [[División Mayor del Básquetbol de Chile|DIMAYOR]] where it won the 2001 season. In 1977 and 2001 Valdivia hosted South Americas Men's Basketball Championship.&lt;ref name="basketball"&gt;[http://www.dimayor.cl/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=12735 DIMAYOR] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The football club [[Deportes Valdivia|Club Deportivo Deportes Valdivia]], founded in 2003, plays currently in the [[Liga Chilena de Fútbol: Tercera División|Chilean third division]] and {{As of|2013|lc=y}}, will play in the Primera B (or Second Division)

==Transport==
===Roads and bridges===
[[File:Valdivian sea lions.JPG|thumb|right|[[Pedro de Valdivia Bridge]] and the city's [[South American sea lion|sea lion]] colony]]

Most of Valdivia lies on the southern side of the [[Valdivia River|Valdivia]] and [[Calle-Calle River]]s but other areas of the city, such as [[Isla Teja]] and [[Las Animas, Chile|Las Animas]], are connected to it by bridges. The main access points to the city are [[Calle-Calle Bridge]] from the north and a southern route. Both connect the city with the [[Pan-American Highway]] and run through forested areas and wetlands.
 
Calle-Calle Bridge, the first bridge built in the city, connects Valdivia with Las Animas and forms the northern highway access to the city. [[Pedro de Valdivia Bridge]] was built in 1954 and connects the city with [[Isla Teja]], where many German immigrants once lived. During the Great [[1960 Valdivia earthquake]] only the minor [[Caucau Bridge]] (connecting Las Animas with Isla Teja) was destroyed, while all other bridges were repaired and are still in use. In 1987 [[Augusto Pinochet]] opened [[Río Cruces Bridge]], making the coastal town of [[Niebla, Chile|Niebla]] as well as [[Torobayo]] and [[Punucapa]] accessible by road. Calle-Calle Bridge, the main access to the city, was enlarged in the 1990s.

===Waterways===
Until highway bridges were built, Valdivia's economy and citizens depended on boat traffic on the surrounding rivers, but with a contraction of bridges and highways, the river has lost its importance. Today, the rivers are used by the commercial ships built or repaired in [[Asenav]], one of Chile's most important shipyard companies, and by tourist boats. Some of the locations that are regularly reached by tourist boats include [[Mancera Island]] and [[Punucapa]].
Fishing boats also travel inland from the coast to the River Market. Today, just one ferry is still in operation, the [[Niebla, Chile|Niebla]]–[[Corral, Chile|Corral]] line, as it is much quicker to reach Corral by [[ferry]] than by road.
 
Although in recent years the rivers have not had a major role in Valdivia’s public transportation, a new private project is being developed by "Los Solares",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solaresdevaldivia.cl/muelles-y-horarios/ Rutas de Los Solares Transportes TFS] Solaresdevaldivia.cl retrieved on February 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; an environmentally friendly company that operates solar-powered river taxis on [[Valdivia River]]. The project is called Transporte Fluvial Sustentable (TFS, or "Sustainable Water Transportation" in English). So far, the company has a fleet of with three river taxis,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elnaveghable.cl/etiquetas/valdivia-barrio-flotante Barrio Flotante en Valdivia ya está en marcha] elnaveghable.cl  January 27, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and a small, sustainable and locally designed floating village that includes a pier, a café and the company’s offices. The community produces its own electricity, water supply and processes its own wastewater with a bacterial solution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livingatlaschile.com/?s=River+neighbourhood Valdivia’s River neighbourhood Short documentary with English subtitles] www.livingatlaschile.com released on February 18, 2014 retrieved on February 23, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airports===
The city is served mainly by [[Pichoy Airport]], lying 32&amp;nbsp;km northeast of the city via the north entrance road that connects the city with the [[Pan American Highway]]. The smaller but much closer [[Las Marías Airport]] is used primarily by small aircraft, with no [[airline]]s operating there.

The '''White Coat Ceremony''' ('''WCC''') is a relatively new [[ritual]] in some [[medical]] ([[Doctor of Medicine|MD]], [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|DO]]), [[dentistry|dental]], [[optometry]], [[audiology]],  [[chiropractic]], dietetic,  [[occupational therapy]], [[physical therapy]], [[podiatry|podiatric]], [[pharmacy]], [[physician assistant]], pathologists' assistant,  [[nursing]], naturopathic and [[veterinary medicine|veterinary]] schools that marks the [[student]]'s transition from the study of preclinical to clinical health sciences.  At some schools, where students begin meeting patients early in their education, the white coat ceremony is held before the first year begins. It is an example of a [[matriculation]].

WCCs typically involve a formal "coating" of students.

==Description==

Over 100 medical schools in the United States now have a WCC, and many students now consider it a [[rite of passage]] in the journey toward a healthcare career.  Some schools also use this as a graduation from the entire program. For example, [[Moreno Valley College]] has a White Coat Ceremony for the Physician Assistant students at the end of their final term, where the short coats are discarded and long coats are given as a symbol of being equal clinicians to others who have earned the long coats.

According to some{{who|date=June 2012}}, WCCs have taken on a quasi-religious significance, that symbolizes a "conversion" of a [[lay person]] into a member of the healthcare profession&lt;ref name=veatch&gt;{{cite journal |author=Veatch RM |title=White coat ceremonies: a second opinion |journal=J Med Ethics |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=5–9 |date=February 2002 |pmid=11834749 |doi= 10.1136/jme.28.1.5|url=http://jme.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11834749 |pmc=1733513}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is similar to a priest's ordination to the [[priesthood]], although it is notable that the white coat is a recent adoption by the medical profession. However, in many medical schools around the world students begin wearing their white coats during first year anatomy class, so there is no official white coat ceremony.

In the nineteenth century respect for the certainty of science was in stark contrast to the [[quackery]] and [[Medieval medicine|mysticism]] of ni kineteenth century medicine.  To emphasize the transition to the more scientific approach to modern medicine, physicians sought to represent themselves as scientists and began to wear the most recognizable symbol of the scientist - the white laboratory coat.&lt;ref&gt;Jones VA, "The White Coat: Why not Follow Suit?" JAMA. 1999;281:478. [http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/281/5/478 Full Text].&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the more recent association of the white coat with medicine since its continued adoption.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, Susan and Corones, Anthony, "Dressed to Heal: The Changing Semiotics of Surgical Dress", ''Fashion Theory'', (2015), pp.1-23.

WCCs originated in [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Pritzker School of Medicine]] in 1989,&lt;ref name="warren"&gt;Warren, Peter M. "[http://articles.latimes.com/1999/oct/18/local/me-23619 For New Medical Students, White Coats Are a Warmup]" ''Los Angeles Times'', 18 October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; but the first full-fledged ceremony was at the [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]].&lt;ref name="warren"/&gt; In 1993, Dr. [[Arnold P. Gold]], a teacher and pediatric neurologist, created the first full-fledged WCC at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbiamedicinemagazine.org/features/fall-2013/celebrating-20-years-white-coat-ceremony|title=Celebrating 20 Years of the White Coat Ceremony|work=Columbia Medicine Magazine|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this ceremony, medical students typically received the [[Hippocratic Oath]] for the first time at commencement.&lt;ref name="columbia.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ps.columbia.edu/education/student-life/ceremonies-events/white-coat-ceremony|title=White Coat Ceremony|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ceremony marks a change in tradition, introducing students to the Oath before starting their first year of study.&lt;ref name="columbia.edu"/&gt; This was intended to provide students with well-defined guidelines regarding the expectations and responsibilities appropriate for the medical profession prior to their first day of class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medschool.umaryland.edu/professionalism/Humanism/WhiteCoat.asp|title=White Coat Ceremony - History|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its conception at Columbia, the WCC has spread rapidly to [[Medical education in the United States|schools of medicine]], dentistry, pharmacy, [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic medicine]], optometry, and nursing worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nymc.edu/OfficesAndServices/PublicRelations/PressReleases/CurrentPressReleases/07-22-15.html|title=New York Medical College - Press Releases|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since starting in the US, several medical schools in countries outside of the United States (such as [[Iran]], Israel, Canada, [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Brazil]] and [[Poland]]) have also started holding WCCs. The ceremony is no longer limited to medical students; starting in 1995, US pharmacy schools started holding WCCs, with the difference that most pharmacy students receive their coats at the end of their first academic year. In 2003 a survey found that the majority of US pharmacy schools hold WCCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brown DL, Ferrill MJ, Pankaskie MC |title=White coat ceremonies in US schools of pharmacy |journal=Ann Pharmacother |volume=37 |issue=10 |pages=1414–9 |date=October 2003 |pmid=14519030 |doi=10.1345/aph.1D124 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gold-sponsored version of the WCC, or a similar rite of passage, is currently used by 97 percent of Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC)-accredited schools of medicine in the United States, and takes place at medical and osteopathic schools in 13 other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanism-in-medicine.org/programs/rituals/white-coat-ceremony/|title=The Arnold P.
