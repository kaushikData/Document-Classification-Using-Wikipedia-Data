The '''A390''' is a road in [[Cornwall]] and [[Devon]], [[England]]. It runs from [[Tavistock, Devon|Tavistock]] to {{convert|5|mi}} north west of the city of [[Truro]]. Starting in Tavistock, it heads south-westwards towards [[Liskeard]], crossing over the [[River Tamar]] and into Cornwall, then through  [[Gunnislake]] and [[Callington, Cornwall|Callington]]. Immediately before Liskeard, it merges with the [[A38 road|A38]] north of the town. It diverges from the A38 at [[Dobwalls]], where it then runs in a south-westerly direction to [[Truro]] via [[Lostwithiel]], [[St. Blazey]], and [[St Austell]]. It then forms an upside down elongated square loop, and bypasses Truro City Centre. It then heads north west out of the city, where it forms the main corridor into Truro from the west. It passes the [[Royal Cornwall Hospital]] and skirts the village of [[Threemilestone]], before linking up with the [[A30 road]] at [[Chiverton Cross]], where the A390 terminates. Chiverton Cross is where the '''A390 trunk road''' from Truro and the B3277 to [[St Agnes, Cornwall|St Agnes]] meet the east-west [[A30 road|A30 trunk road]]. Before the A390 was rerouted away from [[Chacewater]] it ended at its junction with the A30 at [[Scorrier]].&lt;ref&gt;Ordnance Survey (1961) ''One-inch Map of Great Britain; Truro and Falmouth, sheet 190''.&lt;/ref&gt;

It forms part of the main route (the Truro to Dobwalls section) from Truro to [[Plymouth]], although after a severe accident in Lostwithiel in 1999 heavy goods vehicles are diverted from it at the top of Edgcumbe Road, [[Lostwithiel]].

By far the busiest section of the road is between Truro City Centre and Chiverton Cross, where it carries through traffic to West Cornwall,as well as commuting traffic to and from Truro, and traffic for the Royal Cornwall Hospital, [[Truro College]] and the [[Richard Lander School]]. There are many residential new housing estates in this area which have created further traffic. The section from Truro College heading into Truro from the west also includes a [[Bus lane]] and some [[dual carriageway]] sections.

The presumed '''[[grandmother cell]]''' responds to a seemingly impossible large number of stimuli. If the stimulus is a photo of your grandmother looking straight into the camera, the cell fires. If the stimulus is a painting of your grandmother in profile, the same cell fires. If the stimulus is a sketch of your grandmother walking away, drawn by a street artist, the same cell fires.

This neuron activates when a person identifies a specific entity, such as his or her grandmother. These neurons would activate not only when presented with a family member, but also when presented with celebrities such as [[Halle Berry]]. The term was coined by [[Jerry Lettvin]] around 1969.&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12374433 | volume=8 | issue=5 | title=Genealogy of the &amp;quot;grandmother cell&amp;quot; | date=October 2002 | journal=Neuroscientist | pages=512–8 | last1 = Gross | first1 = CG | doi=10.1177/107385802237175}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar concept had been proposed a few years earlier by Jerzy Konorski who called such cells gnostic units. Since  grandmother cells are highly controversial it was very surprising when Kreiman announced in 2001 that he had discovered one. Since then, several explanations of such findings have been proposed which do not involve grandmother cells. One explanation is based on sparse coding and another on neural nets.

== Biological implausibility ==

A neuron normally fires when excited by one very specific feature of a stimulus.&lt;ref name=z&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Logothetis | first1 = N. K. | last2 = Pauls | first2 = J. | year = 1995 | title = Psychophysical and Physiological Evidence for Viewer-Centered Object Representation in the Primate | url = | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 5 | issue = 3| pages = 270–288 | doi=10.1093/cercor/5.3.270}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study performed by Logothetis and Pauls, this is seen with the spiking of a single macaque monkey neuron when presented with a paper clip bent in a certain way at a variety of angles. At a specific angle, the neuron fires rapidly. At different angles or shapes, it does not. A grandmother cell, by contrast, would seem to fire at many different shapes and angles. And it is very difficult to imagine what kind of mechanism "will bind ... information from disparate sensory sources" in a cell, which makes a grandmother cell "a tremendous connectivity puzzle".&lt;ref name=b&gt;Llinás, R. (2002).  I of the Vortex: From Neurons to Self. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==

In 2001, Kreiman announced that he had found a grandmother cell.  This "neuron in the human amygdala, for example, fires to a  caricature, a portrait, and a group photo of [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]], but not to 47 other pictures of famous men, presidents, and a variety of objects".&lt;ref name=c&gt;Kreiman, G. (2001). On the Neuronal Activity in the  Human Brain During Visual Recognition, Imagery and Binocular Rivalry, Ph.D. thesis: California Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kreiman | first1 = G. | last2 = Fried | first2 = I. | last3 = Koch | first3 = C. | year = 2002 | title = Single-Neuron Correlates of Subjective Vision in the Human Medial Temporal Lobe | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 99 | issue = 12| pages = 8378–8383 | doi=10.1073/pnas.072194099 | pmid=12034865 | pmc=123075}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Koch affirmed "such cells do exist".&lt;ref name=e /&gt; In 2005, Quiroga and coworkers obtained similar results.&lt;ref name=e&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Quiroga | first1 = R. Q. | last2 = Reddy | first2 = L. | last3 = Kreiman | first3 = G. | last4 = Koch | first4 = C. | last5 = Fried | first5 = I. | year = 2005 | title = Invariant Visual Representation by Single Neurons in the Human Brain | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 435 | issue = 7045| pages = 1102–1107 | doi=10.1038/nature03687}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2007, Quiroga, Kreiman, Koch and Fried rescinded their initial views, trying to explain their results with sparse coding.&lt;ref name=f&gt;Quiroga, R., Kreiman, G., Koch, C., and Fried, I. (2007). "Sparse but not 'Grandmother cell' coding in the medial temporal lobe." Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative explanations ==

=== Sparse coding ===

[[Neural coding#Sparse coding|Sparse coding]] starts with the activation of moderately small sets of neurons in a small region of the brain. In each region of the brain, related stimuli have a different subset of available neurons to process them together. This reduces the overlap of the representation of two items. Each item is individually represented by a different neuron or a small set of neurons. This helps represent data more efficiently.

In a recent article Quiroga, Kreiman, Koch and Fried admitted they had in fact not found grandmother cells, rather they had found sparse coding.&lt;ref name=f /&gt; The main question was how information was represented in the upper stages of the hierarchy, and still made accessible to perceptual, cognitive and mnemonic processes. This is why sparse coding became an alternative to grandmother cells. The idea of sparse coding is that very small numbers of neurons respond to specific features, objects or concepts in an obvious manner.

Being able to find one cell would be a difficult task. It seems implausible that grandmother cells have any extraordinary binding properties.&lt;ref name=b /&gt; They are the properties of sparse coding instead. It should also be noted that it is difficult to detect sparse firing neurons. Single electrode recordings with moveable probes are used to detect firing, but it is common to miss firing cells.&lt;ref name=f /&gt;

Waydo and Koch conducted a study where a two layered network was exposed to 40 different face images of ten individuals. Each output unit was constrained to fire to the smallest possible number of inputs. Also, the smallest number of units represented each  image. They found that most of the units responded to a single individual. This suggests that a sparse neuronal representation could emerge in the Medial Temporal Lobe (MTL) while using unsupervised learning.&lt;ref name=g&gt;Waydo, S. and Koch, C (2008). Unsupervised Learning of Individuals and Categories from Images. Neural Comput. 20, 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sparse coding often takes place in the [[hippocampus]]. The [[medial temporal lobe]] is critical for [[long term memory]], particularly episodic memories. Both the hippocampus and the cortex may interact to produce sparse coding. This helps with numerous tasks, including word, object and facial identification.&lt;ref name=h&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bowers | first1 = J. S. | year = 2009 | title = On the biological plausibility of grandmother cells. Implications  for neural network theories in psychology and neuroscience | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 116 | issue = 1| pages = 220–251 | doi=10.1037/a0014462 | pmid=19159155}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Sparse representations are also associated with [[Connectionism|parallel distributed processing]] which proves to have great success with rapid learning. It does not have success with generalization, though. Compared to grandmother cells, an individual neuron in sparse coding is involved in coding two things, and two neurons code for a specific stimulus.&lt;ref name=h /&gt;

Overall, visual information goes through the ventral pathway. Evidence that was obtained from recordings of single-neuron activity in humans suggests that a subset of MTL neurons presents an invariant representation of perceived objects. This means that the neurons respond to abstract concepts rather than more basic metric details. This information favors sparse coding over grandmother cells, because the neurons fire only to very few stimuli, and are mostly silent with the exception of their preferred stimuli.&lt;ref name=f /&gt;

=== Neural nets and distributive explanation ===

Grandmother cells can be explained in a much simpler way. As Munevar proposes, grandmother cells are in fact the output cells of neural nets rather than cells acting independently. The existence of grandmother cells clashes with the model of the brain as a distributive system and is improbable because such neurons would have powers of representation across visuals angles and contexts.&lt;ref name=j&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Munevar | first1 = G | year = 2008 | title = A Distributive Explanation of "Grandmother" Cells | url = | journal = Proceedings of the XXII World Congress of Philosophy | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 25–31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The distributive explanation argues that the grandmother cell is nothing but the single-neuron output stage of a neural network trained to recognize a person. The hypothetical grandmother cell does not have any extraordinary binding properties. They are properties of the neural network instead.

Although Kreiman's and Quiroga's results may seem to challenge the distributive model of the brain, the distributive theory offers a simple explanation of these phenomena.&lt;ref name=c /&gt;&lt;ref name=e /&gt; Such cells serve as the output neurons for neural networks trained to recognize the famous persons in question.

Paul Churchland's accessible account of a network that distinguishes between sonar echoes of explosive underwater mines vs. those of rocks provides us with a better understanding of this idea.&lt;ref name=k&gt;Churchland, P. M. (1996).  The Engine of Reason, the Seat of the Soul.  MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Churchland's work is based on the work of Gorman and Sejnowski.&lt;ref name=l&gt;Gorman, R. P., and Sejnowski, T. J. (1988). "Analysis of Hidden Units in a Layered Network Trained to Classify Sonar Targets."  Neural Networks, Vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The network becomes trained as feedback is delivered to its hidden units. The feedback includes the error of the network in deciding whether every echo in the training set belongs to a mine or a rock.

The important factor here is that the recognition is done not by the output cell ("mine") but by the middle (hidden) layer. When that middle layer recognizes a mine echo, the single-cell output layer "lights up", which is exactly the sort of thing we find in those networks that recognize Clinton, Aniston or Berry.&lt;ref name=k /&gt;

This account extends beyond the discrimination between two alternatives (mines and rocks) to that between different faces. Therefore, the distributive brain may have a single-cell output layer fire whenever a specific person, e.g. your grandmother, is presented to the eye; although many famous people, such as [[Jennifer Aniston]] or Halle Berry, may be of greater interest. Neural networks, then, explain very plausibly the otherwise paradoxical results of the recent grandmother cell experiments.&lt;ref name=k /&gt; Neural nets are a form of parallel distributed processing.

=== Parallel distributed processing ===

In 1950 [[Frank Rosenblatt]] looked into a new approach in neural net technology. He used a circuit consisting of an array of input units. These units are connected through a set of intermediate neurons. In Rosenblatt's trials, he used binary words in both input and output, and he called his invention Perception. Perception was the most basic and revolutionary type of neural net. In 1969, the limitations of Perception were explained by Minsky and Papert.&lt;ref name=m&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harth | first1 = E | year = 1997 | title = From Brains to Neural Nets to Brains | doi = 10.1016/s0893-6080(97)00048-8 | journal = Neural Networks | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 1241–1255 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neural nets have been expanded by a variety of neuroscientists and psychologists. Churchland discusses neural nets in the context of facial coding. The example consisted of a bank teller who could not remember the face of a bank robber to provide a description. However, Churchland says the teller would likely recognize and discriminate the robber's face when she sees him again. This example contains not only the idea of neural nets, but also of vector coding.&lt;ref name=k/&gt;

Cottrell, in research at the University of California at San Diego, developed the artificial neural network which had a 64 X 64 pixel grid with 256 activation levels. The network consisted of recognizable representations of real faces.&lt;ref name=y&gt;Cottrell, G., and Metcalfe, J. (1991). "EMPATH: Face, Emotion and Gender Recognition Using Holons," in Lippman, R., Moody, J., and Touretzky, D, eds., Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, Vol. 3. Morgan Kaufmann.&lt;/ref&gt;  Each input cell had a radiating set of axonal end branches to every cell in the middle layer. The middle layer is hidden and projects the coding from 80 cells to the eight output cells. These eight output cells could discriminate faces from non-faces just like grandmother cells are thought to do. Cottrell had no idea how synaptic connections should be configured in the artificial neural network. Cottrell overcame this issue by using a biologically realistic adjustment.

The [[Artificial Neural Network]] (ANN) was initially trained with 64 images, but was eventually pushed outside the training boundary. In a training session the facial recognition was performing at 100%. When the ANN performed facial recognition testing outside of training, the network was still performing at 100%. Even when one-fifth of the face was covered with a black strip the face was still 100% effective as long as the strip did not cover the forehead. The ANN proves another way in which a small number of cells can seem to do a big number of tasks. Previously, grandmother cells supposedly have a unique ability to complete these tasks. The input layer is variously activated by 80 holistic features which vector codes for the second layer. This vector code is an activation which allows the third layer to identify a known individual correctly.&lt;ref name=k/&gt; This is also the case in parallel distributed processing (PDP). PDP highlights the parallels between connectionist models and neural coding in the brain, while also dismissing localism.&lt;ref name=h /&gt;

Churchland explains that neural nets contain three basic levels. The levels are the input layer, hidden layer and output layer. Munevar, following the PDP theory, believes that output cells can explain the presumed grandmother cells. PDP involves the performance of hundreds of millions of individual computation simultaneously, instead of in a lengthy sequence.&lt;ref name=k /&gt; It takes 10 milliseconds for a visual impulse to go across a sign layer to layer transformation, and reaches the 3rd layer where buried information has been made explicit.

In PDP, grandmother cells are a thing to ridicule. Finkel called them infamous grandmother cells, and Connor said no one wants to be accused of believing in grandmother cells.&lt;ref name=h /&gt; 50 years of studies involving PDP and grandmother cells have not really found any grandmother cells, but rather that the brain codes information with a form of distributed coding. Localist models ignore the neuroscience data taken to support distributed coding schemes, specifically single cell electrophysiological recording studies. Localist models are instead often supported by neuropsychological data. Biologically, the PDP model is superior and can be supported using the many different methods and studies. This includes studies of PDP in the brain, as discussed by Bowers.

The '''International Balzan Prize Foundation''' awards four annual monetary prizes to [[List of Balzan Prize Winners|people or organizations]] who have made outstanding achievements in the fields of humanities, natural sciences, culture, as well as for endeavours for peace and the brotherhood of man.

==Rewards and assets==

Each year the foundation chooses the fields eligible for the next year's prizes, and determines the prize amount. These are generally announced in May, with the winners announced the September the following year. Since 2001 the prize money has increased to 1 million [[Swiss Franc]]s per prize, on condition that half the money is used for projects involving young researchers.

The Balzan Prize committee comprises twenty members of the prestigious learned societies of Europe.

The assets behind the foundation were established by the Italian '''Eugenio Balzan''' {{small|([[:it:Eugenio Balzan|it]])}} (1874–1953), a part-owner of ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' who had invested his assets in [[Switzerland]] and in 1933 had left Italy in protest against fascism. He left a substantial inheritance to his daughter Angela Lina Balzan (1892–1956), who at the time was suffering an incurable disease. Before her death, she left instructions for the foundation and since then it has two headquarters, the Prize administered from Milan, the Fund from Zurich.

The first award was in fact 1 million Swiss francs to the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel foundation]] in 1961. After 1962 a gap of 16 years followed when prizes recommenced with an award of half a million Swiss francs to [[Mother Teresa]]. Award ceremonies alternate between [[Bern]] and the [[Accademia dei Lincei]] in Rome, and frequently winners have later won a Nobel Prize.

The amount of each of the four Balzan Prizes is now 750,000 [[Swiss franc]]s (approx. €700,000; $790,000; £500,000).

All awards are decided by a single committee.

==Categories==

Four prizes have been awarded annually since 1978. The award fields vary each year and can be related to either a specific or an interdisciplinary field. The prizes go beyond the traditional subjects both in the humanities (literature, the moral sciences and the arts) and in the sciences (medicine and the physical, mathematical and natural sciences), with an emphasis on innovative research.

Every 3 to 7 years the foundation also awards the ''Prize for humanity, peace and brotherhood among peoples''. It was last awarded in 2014 to [[Vivre en Famille]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1655">The '''[[Circe]] effect''' is a phenomenon proposed by [[William Jencks]] seen in [[chemistry]] and [[biochemistry]] where in order to speed up a reaction, the ground state of the substrate is destabilized by an [[enzyme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Purich|first1=Daniel L.|title=Enzyme kinetics catalysis &amp; control : a reference of theory and best-practice methods|date=2010|publisher=Elsevier|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-0123809254|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
Highly favourable binding of a substrate at a non-reactive site will force the reactive site of the substrate to be more reactive by putting it in a very unfavourable position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors = Lee JK, Tantillo, DJ|title = Orotidine Monophosphate Decarboxylase: A Mechanistic Dialogue|year=2004|publisher = Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn = 978-3-540-20566-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect was observed in [[orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williamson|first1=Mike|title=How proteins work|date=2012|publisher=Garland Science|location=New York|isbn=978-0815344469}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can occur by positioning a charged amino acid group next to the charged substrate thus destabilizing it, thus making the reaction occur faster. Furthermore, the substrate is put into a very optimal position by the enzyme for the reaction to occur, thus decreasing the [[entropy]] greatly.

==Etymology==
This process was named after [[Circe]] in Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', who lured men and turned them into pigs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1622">'''Depth conversion''' is an important step of the [[seismic reflection]] method, which converts the acoustic wave travel time to actual depth, based on the acoustic velocity of subsurface medium (sediments, rocks, water).

Depth conversion integrates several sources of information about the suburface velocity to derive a [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] velocity model:
* "Well tops", i.e., depth of geological layers encountered in [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[gas]] [[oil well|well]]s
* [[Velocity]] measurements made in [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[gas]] [[oil well|well]]s
* Empirical knowledge about the velocities of the rocks in the area investigated
* [[Root Mean Square]] (RMS) [[stacking velocity|stacking velocities]] which are derived from the processing of the seismic reflection data

The conversion permits the production of depth and thickness maps that depict subsurface layers that are based on reflection data. These maps are crucial in [[hydrocarbon exploration]] because they permit the volumetric evaluation of gas or oil in place. In the example subsurface map presented below, depth increases from red to blue. The highest zone in red is an oilfield at approximately 3000 m below sea level.

'''Embodied cognitive science''' is an interdisciplinary field of research, the aim of which is to explain the mechanisms underlying intelligent behavior.   It comprises three main methodologies: 1) the modeling of psychological and biological systems in a holistic manner that considers the mind and body as a single entity, 2) the formation of a common set of general principles of intelligent behavior, and 3) the experimental use of robotic agents in controlled environments.

Embodied cognitive science borrows heavily from [[embodied philosophy]] and the related research fields of [[cognitive science]], [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]] and [[artificial intelligence]]. From the perspective of neuroscience, research in this field was led by [[Gerald Edelman]] of the [[Neurosciences Institute]] at La Jolla, the late [[Francisco Varela]] of [[CNRS]] in France, and [[J. A. Scott Kelso]] of [[Florida Atlantic University]].  From the perspective of psychology, research by [[Michael Turvey]], [[Lawrence Barsalou]] and [[Eleanor Rosch]].  From the perspective of language acquisition, [[Eric Lenneberg]] and [[Philip Rubin]] at [[Haskins Laboratories]].  From the perspective of autonomous agent design, early work is sometimes attributed to [[Rodney Brooks]] or [[Valentino Braitenberg]].  From the perspective of artificial intelligence, see ''Understanding Intelligence'' by [[Rolf Pfeifer]] and Christian Scheier or ''How the body shapes the way we think'', also by Rolf Pfeifer and Josh C. Bongard. From the perspective of philosophy see [[Andy Clark]], [[Shaun Gallagher]], and [[Evan Thompson]].

[[Alan Turing|Turing]] proposed that a machine may need a human-like body to think and speak:

::''It can also be maintained that it is best to provide the machine with the best sense organs that money can buy, and then teach it to understand and speak English. That process could follow the normal teaching of a child. Things would be pointed out and named, etc. Again, I do not know what the right answer is, but I think both approaches should be tried'' (Turing, 1950).&lt;ref&gt;{{Turing 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traditional cognitive theory ==

Embodied cognitive science is an alternative theory to cognition in which it minimizes appeals to [[computational theory of mind]] in favor of greater emphasis on how an organism's body determines how and what it thinks. Traditional cognitive theory is based mainly around symbol manipulation, in which certain inputs are fed into a processing unit that produces an output. These inputs follow certain rules of syntax, from which the processing unit finds semantic meaning. Thus, an appropriate output is produced. For example, a human's sensory organs are its input devices, and the stimuli obtained from the external environment are fed into the nervous system which serves as the processing unit. From here, the nervous system is able to read the sensory information because it follows a syntactic structure, thus an output is created. This output then creates bodily motions and brings forth behavior and cognition. Of particular note is that cognition is sealed away in the brain, meaning that mental cognition is cut off from the external world and is only possible by the input of sensory information.

== The embodied cognitive approach ==

Embodied cognitive science differs from the traditionalist approach in that it denies the input-output system. This is chiefly due to the problems presented by the [[Homunculus argument]], which concluded that semantic meaning could not be derived from symbols without some kind of inner interpretation. If some little man in a person's head interpreted incoming symbols, then who would interpret the little man's inputs? Because of the specter of an infinite regress, the traditionalist model began to seem less plausible. Thus, embodied cognitive science aims to avoid this problem by defining cognition in three ways.&lt;ref name="Shapiro2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=Larry|title=The Embodied Cognition Programme|journal=Philosophy Compass|date=March 2007|volume=2|issue=2|doi=10.1111/j.1747-9991.2007.00064.x|url=http://portal.uni-freiburg.de/cognition/lehre/archiv/ss13/mat-prosem/embodiedcognition/Shapiro_EmbodiedCognition.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|340}}

=== Physical attributes of the body ===
The first aspect of embodied cognition examines the role of the physical body, particularly how its properties affect its ability to think. This part attempts to overcome the symbol manipulation component that is a feature of the traditionalist model. Depth perception for instance can be better explained under the embodied approach due to the sheer complexity of the action. Depth perception requires that the brain detect the disparate retinal images obtained by the distance of the two eyes. In addition, body and head cues complicate this further. When the head is turned in a given direction, objects in the foreground will appear to move against objects in the background. From this, it is said that some kind of visual processing is occurring without the need of any kind of symbol manipulation. This is because the objects appearing to move the foreground are simply appearing to move. This observation concludes then that depth can be perceived with no intermediate symbol manipulation necessary. 

A more poignant example exists through examining auditory perception. Generally speaking the greater the distance between the ears, the greater the possible auditory acuity. Also relevant is the amount of density in between the ears, for the strength of the frequency wave alters as it passes through a given medium. The brain's auditory system takes these factors into account as it process information, but again without any need for a symbolic manipulation system. This is because the distance between the ears for example does not need symbols to represent it. The distance itself creates the necessary opportunity for greater auditory acuity. The amount of density between the ears is similar, in that it is the actual amount itself that simply forms the opportunity for frequency alteration. Thus under consideration of the physical properties of the body, a symbolic system is unnecessary and an unhelpful metaphor.

=== The body's role in the cognitive process ===

The second aspect draws heavily from [[George Lakoff]]'s and [[Mark Johnson (philosopher)|Mark Johnson]]'s work on concepts. They argued that humans use metaphors whenever possible to better explain their external world. Humans also have a basic stock of concepts in which other concepts can be derived from. These basic concepts include spatial orientations such as up, down, front, and back. Humans can understand what these concepts mean because they can directly experience them from their own bodies. For example, because human movement revolves around standing erect and moving the body in an up-down motion, humans innately have these concepts of up and down. Lakoff and Johnson contend this is similar with other spatial orientations such as front and back too. As mentioned earlier, these basic stocks of spatial concepts are the basis in which other concepts are constructed. Happy and sad for instance are seen now as being up or down respectively. When someone says they are feeling down, what they are really saying is that they feel sad for example. Thus the point here is that true understanding of these concepts is contingent on whether one can have an understanding of the human body. So the argument goes that if one lacked a human body, they could not possibly know what up or down could mean, or how it could relate to emotional states.

&lt;blockquote&gt;

‘[I]magine a spherical being living outside of any gravitational field, with no
knowledge or imagination of any other kind of experience. What could UP
possibly mean to such a being?'&lt;ref name="Shapiro2007"/&gt;{{rp|342}}

&lt;/blockquote&gt;  

While this does not mean that such beings would be incapable of expressing emotions in other words, it does mean that they would express emotions differently from humans. Human concepts of happiness and sadness would be different because human would have different bodies. So then an organism's body directly affects how it can think, because it uses metaphors related to its body as the basis of concepts.

=== Interaction of local environment ===
A third component of the embodied approach looks at how agents use their immediate environment in cognitive processing. Meaning, the local environment is seen as an actual extension of the body's cognitive process. The example of a [[personal digital assistant]] (PDA) is used to better imagine this. Echoing [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)]], this point claims that mental states are individuated by their role in a much larger system. So under this premise, the information on a PDA is similar to the information stored in the brain. So then if one thinks information in the brain constitutes mental states, then it must follow that information in the PDA is a cognitive state too. Consider also the role of pen and paper in a complex multiplication problem. The pen and paper are so involved in the cognitive process of solving the problem that it seems ridiculous to say they are somehow different from the process, in very much the same way the PDA is used for information like the brain. Another example examines how humans control and manipulate their environment so that cognitive tasks can be better performed. Leaving one's car keys in a familiar place so they aren't missed for instance, or using landmarks to navigate in an unfamiliar city. Thus, humans incorporate aspects of their environment to aid in their cognitive functioning.

== Examples of the value of embodied approach ==

The value of the embodiment approach in the context of cognitive science is perhaps best explained by [[Andy Clark]].&lt;ref name="Clark1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=Andy|title=An Embodied Cognitive Science?|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=September 1999|volume=3|issue=9|pages=345–351|url=http://psy.haifa.ac.il/~ep/Lecture%20Files/AI/Secure/Download/Clark%20Andy%20-%20Embodied%20Cog%20Science%20%281999%20Trends%29.pdf|accessdate=27 June 2011|doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(99)01361-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|345–351}} He makes the claim that the brain alone should not be the single focus for the scientific study of cognition

&lt;blockquote&gt;

It is increasingly clear that, in a wide variety of cases, the individual brain should not be the sole locus of cognitive scientific interest. Cognition is not a phenomenon that can be successfully studied while marginalizing the roles of body, world and action.&lt;ref name="Clark1999"/&gt;{{rp|350}}

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following examples used by Clark will better illustrate how embodied thinking is becoming apparent in scientific thinking.

=== Bluefin tuna ===

''[[Thunnus]]'', or tuna, long baffled conventional biologists with its incredible abilities to accelerate quickly and attain great speeds. A biological examination of the tuna shows it is simply not capable of such feats. However, an answer can be found when taking the tuna's embodied state into account. The [[bluefin tuna]] is able to take advantage of and exploit its local environment by finding naturally occurring currents to increase its speed. The tuna also uses its own physical body for this end as well, by utilizing its tailfin to create the necessary vortices and pressure so it can accelerate and maintain high speeds. Thus, the bluefin tuna is actively using its local environment for its own ends through the attributes of its physical body.

=== Robots ===

Clark uses the example of the hopping [[robot]] constructed by Raibert and Hodgins to demonstrate further the value of the embodiment paradigm. These robots were essentially vertical cylinders with a single hopping foot. The challenge of managing the robot's behavior can be daunting because in addition to the intricacies of the program itself, there were also the mechanical matters regarding how the foot ought to be constructed so that it could hop. An embodied approach makes it easier to see that in order for this robot to function, it must be able to exploit its system to the fullest. That is, the robot's systems should be seen as having dynamic characteristics as opposed to the traditional view that it is merely a command center that just executes actions.

=== Vision ===

Clark distinguishes between two kinds of [[Visual perception|vision]], animate and pure vision. Pure vision is an idea that is typically associated with classical [[artificial intelligence]], in which vision is used to create a rich world model so that thought and reason can be used to fully explore the inner model. In other words, pure vision passively creates the external perceivable world so that the faculties of reason can be better used introspectively. Animate vision, by contrast, sees vision as the means by which real-time action can commence. Animate vision is then more of a vehicle by which visual information is obtained so that actions can be undertaken. Clark points to animate vision as an example of embodiment, because it uses both biological and local environment cues to create an active intelligent process. Consider the Clark's example of going to the drugstore to buy some Kodak film. In one's mind, one is familiar with the Kodak logo and its trademark gold color. Thus, one uses incoming visual stimuli to navigate around the drugstore until one finds the film. Therefore, vision should not be seen as a passive system but rather an active retrieval device that intelligently uses sensory information and local environmental cues to perform specific real-world actions.

=== Affordance ===

Inspired by the work of the American psychologist [[James J. Gibson]], this next example emphasizes the importance of action-relevant sensory information, bodily movement, and local environment cues. These three concepts are unified by the concept of affordances, which are possibilities of action provided by the physical world to a given agent. These are in turn determined by the agent's physical body, capacities, and the overall action-related properties of the local environment as well. Clark uses the example of an outfielder in baseball to better illustrate the concept of affordance. Traditional computational models would claim that an outfielder attempting to catch a fly-ball can be calculated by variables such as the running speed of the outfielder and the arc of the baseball. However, Gibson's work shows that a simpler method is possible. The outfielder can catch the ball so long as they adjust their running speed so that the ball continually moves in a straight line in their field of vision. Note that this strategy uses various affordances that are contingent upon the success of the outfielder, including their physical body composition, the environment of the baseball field, and the sensory information obtained by the outfielder. 

Clark points out here that the latter strategy of catching the ball as opposed to the former has significant implications for perception. The affordance approach proves to be non-linear because it relies upon spontaneous real-time adjustments. On the contrary, the former method of computing the arc of the ball is linear as it follows a sequence of perception, calculation and performing action. Thus, the affordance approach challenges the traditional view of perception by arguing against the notion that computation and introspection are necessary. Instead, it ought to be replaced with the idea that perception constitutes a continuous equilibrium of action adjustment between the agent and the world. Ultimately Clark does not expressly claim this is certain but he does observe the affordance approach can explain adaptive response satisfactorily.&lt;ref name="Clark1999"/&gt;{{rp|346}} This is because they utilize environmental cues made possible by perceptual information that is actively used in the real-time by the agent.

== General principles of intelligent behavior ==
In the formation of general principles of intelligent behavior, Pfeifer intended to be contrary to older principles  given in traditional artificial intelligence.  The most dramatic difference is that the principles are applicable only to situated robotic agents in the real world, a domain where traditional artificial intelligence showed the least promise.

Principle of Cheap Design and Redundancy: Pfeifer realized that implicit assumptions made by engineers often substantially influence a control architecture's complexity.&lt;ref name="Pfeifer2001"&gt;Pfeifer, R., Scheier, C.,  ''Understanding Intelligence'' (MIT Press, 2001) {{ISBN|0-262-66125-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|436}}  This insight is reflected in discussions of the scalability problem in robotics.  The internal processing needed for some bad architectures can grow out of proportion to new tasks needed of an agent.  

&lt;blockquote&gt;
One of the primary reasons for scalability problems is that the amount of programming and knowledge engineering that the robot designers have to perform grows very rapidly with the complexity of the robot's tasks. There is mounting evidence that pre-programming cannot be the solution to the scalability problem ... The problem is that programmers introduce too many hidden assumptions in the robot's code.&lt;ref&gt;Stoytchev, A. (2006). [http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~alex/papers/NIPS_Workshop_2006.pdf Five Basic Principles of Developmental Robotics] NIPS 2006 Workshop on Grounding Perception, Knowledge and Cognition in Sensori-Motor Experience.  Department of Computer Science, Iowa State U&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The proposed solutions are to have the agent exploit the inherent physics of its environment, to exploit the constraints of its niche, and to have agent morphology based on parsimony and the principle of Redundancy. Redundancy reflects the desire for the error-correction of signals afforded by duplicating like channels.  Additionally, it reflects the desire to exploit the associations between sensory modalities. (See [[modality (human-computer interaction)|redundant modalities]]).  In terms of design, this implies that redundancy should be introduced with respect not only to one sensory modality but to several.&lt;ref name="Pfeifer2001"/&gt;{{rp|448}}  It has been suggested that the fusion and transfer of knowledge between modalities can be the basis of reducing the size of the sense data taken from the real world.&lt;ref&gt;Konijn, Paul (2007). [http://www.diracproject.org/workshop-2007/pdf/DIRAC-Summer-Workshop.pdf Summer Workshop on Multi-Sensory Modalities in Cognitive Science] Detection and Identification of Rare Audiovisual Cues. DIRAC EU IP IST project, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt;  This again addresses the scalability problem.

Principle of Parallel, Loosely-coupled Processes: An alternative to hierarchical methods of knowledge and [[action selection]]. This design principle differs most importantly from the Sense-Think-Act cycle of traditional AI. Since it does not involve this famous cycle, it is not affected by the [[frame problem]].

Principle of Sensory-Motor Coordination: Ideally, internal mechanisms in an agent should give rise to things like memory and choice-making in an emergent fashion, rather than being prescriptively programmed from the beginning.   These kinds of things are allowed to emerge as the agent interacts with the environment. The motto is, build fewer assumptions into the agent's controller now, so that learning can be more robust and idiosyncratic in the future. 

Principle of Ecological Balance: This is more a theory than a principle, but its implications are widespread.  Its claim is that the internal processing of an agent cannot be made more complex unless there is a corresponding increase in complexity of the motors, limbs, and sensors of the agent. In other words, the extra complexity added to the brain of a simple robot will not create any discernible change in its behavior. The robot's morphology must already contain the complexity in itself to allow enough "breathing room" for more internal processing to develop.

The Value Principle: This was the architecture developed in the Darwin III robot of [[Gerald Edelman]]. It relies heavily on [[connectionism]].

== Critical responses ==

=== Traditionalist response to local environment claim ===
A traditionalist may argue that objects may be used to aid in cognitive processes, but this does not mean they are part of a cognitive system.&lt;ref name="Shapiro2007"/&gt;{{rp|343}} Eyeglasses are used to aid in the visual process, but to say they are a part of a larger system would completely redefine what is meant by a visual system. However, supporters of the embodied approach could make the case that if objects in the environment play the functional role of mental states, then the items themselves should not be counted among the mental states.

'''[http://www.equatescotland.org.uk/ Equate Scotland]'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.equatescotland.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; is an organisation established to promote and encourage the advancement of women in science, engineering, technology and the built environment. It is based at [[Edinburgh Napier University]] in Scotland.

Equate began in 2006 as the ''Scottish Resource Centre for Women in Science Engineering and Technology''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.napier.ac.uk/research/centresandprojects/src/about-us/Pages/About-us.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and was the delivery agent in Scotland for the former ''UK Resource Centre for Women in Science Engineering and Technology'' [UKRC]. When the UKRC's contract with the UK Government expired in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wisecampaign.org.uk/about-us&lt;/ref&gt; the Scottish Government agreed to fund the Scottish organisation.

In 2014, the Scottish Resource Centre was re-branded to ''Equate Scotland'', to 
"increase awareness of their expertise in gender equality and diversity in these sectors. It will also lead to a clearly defined focus for supporting women and assist employers and academia in science, engineering and technology across Scotland recruit and retain talented female staff" ([[Alex Salmond]], then [[First Minister of Scotland]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in science, engineering and technology|url=http://news.scotland.gov.uk/News/Women-in-science-engineering-and-technology-c83.aspx|website=The Scottish Government|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisation ==
The current Project Director of Equate Scotland is Talat Yaqoob.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scottish Resource Centre for Women in SET|url=http://www.napier.ac.uk/research/centresandprojects/src/about-us/Pages/Our-staff.aspx|website=Edinburgh Napier University|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She took up this post in January 2016.

== Funding ==
Equate Scotland is funded by the Scottish Government, receiving £601,000 between 2012-15 to support the recruitment and retention of women in science engineering, technology and the built environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in science, engineering and technology|url=http://news.scotland.gov.uk/News/Women-in-science-engineering-and-technology-c83.aspx|website=The Scottish Government|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other funders have included the [[Construction Industry Training Board]], Edinburgh Napier University and the [[Big Lottery Fund]].

== Events and Activities ==
Equate Scotland runs a variety of workshops and events, including:

* Career training and support for women.
* Industry-based advice and training to help improve gender equality and diversity in the workplace.
* Interconnect - a female student network, allowing students to make links with industry.
* Organising industry placements for students.
Equate also contributes to Scottish Government and Scottish Parliament consultations and inquiries.

In 2016, HD&amp;nbsp;164595 briefly attracted media attention after it was reported that a possible [[SETI]] signal had been detected from the direction of the star in the previous year. The signal was only heard once and never confirmed by other telescopes, and is thought to have been due to terrestrial interference.

The senior astronomer of the [[SETI Institute]], [[Seth Shostak]], stated that confirmation by another telescope is required.&lt;ref name="GeekWire"/&gt; Astronomer [[Nicholas Suntzeff]] of [[Texas A&amp;M University]] stated that the signal is in a military frequency band, and that it could have been a satellite downlink, implying that some such systems may be kept secret and therefore would be unknown to SETI scientists.&lt;ref name="ArsTechnica"/&gt;

SETI and [[Active SETI|METI]] studies followed with the [[Allen Telescope Array]] and the Boquete Optical SETI Observatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/local/article/Leaked-space-signal-report-has-SETI-groups-9191169.php|title='Leaked' space signal report has SETI groups scrambling|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GeekWire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geekwire.com/2016/signal-seti-interest-hd164595/|title=They're not saying it's aliens, but signal traced to sunlike star sparks SETI interest|date=29 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, scientists at Berkeley SETI Research Center at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] observed HD&amp;nbsp;164595 using the [[Green Bank Telescope]] as part of the [[Breakthrough Listen]] program. No signal was detected at the position and frequency of the transient reported by the RATAN group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Preliminary analysis of star HD 164595 |url=http://seti.berkeley.edu/HD164595_summary.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Breakthrough Listen Follow-up of a Transient Signal from the RATAN-600 Telescope in the Direction of HD 164595 |url=http://seti.berkeley.edu/HD164595.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Special Astrophysical Observatory]] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] has since released an official statement that the signal is of a "most probable terrestrial origin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sao.ru/Doc-en/SciNews/2016/Sotnikova/| title=SETI| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henning Kagermann''' (born 12 July 1947 in [[Braunschweig]]) is a [[Germans|German]] [[physicist]] and businessman.&lt;ref name="WiWo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Henning Kagermann|url=http://www.wiwo.de/unternehmen-maerkte/koepfe-der-wirtschaft/henning-kagermann-194/biografie/#herkunft-und-familie|publisher=[[Wirtschaftswoche]]|language=German|accessdate=28 October 2015}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the former chairman of the Executive Board and Chief Executive Officer of [[SAP AG]].

==Career==

===Academic===
Kagermann studied [[physics]] in [[Braunschweig]] and [[Munich]]. He received his doctorate degree in [[theoretical physics]] in 1975 from the [[Braunschweig University of Technology|TU Braunschweig]], [[Germany]], and was promoted to professor there in 1980.&lt;ref name="WiWo"/&gt; He taught physics and computer science at TU Braunschweig and [[University of Mannheim]], both in Germany, from 1980-1992. Kagermann also received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Magdeburg]], Germany, and is a trustee of the [[Technical University of Munich]]. He is also a member of the honorary senate of the Foundation [[Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lindau-nobel.org/honorary-senate/ "Honorary Senate''], ''Lindau Nobel Prizewinners''. Accessed 5 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, Kagermann assumed the office of the president of [[German Academy of Science and Engineering|acatech – German Academy of Science and Engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.acatech.de/uk/home-uk/organisation.html|title=The structure of acatach|accessdate=2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business career===
Kagermann joined SAP in 1982 and was initially responsible for product development in the areas of [[cost accounting]] and controlling.&lt;ref name="WiWo"/&gt;

Together with [[Hasso Plattner]], co-founder of SAP, he was co-chairman of the SAP Executive Board and CEO From 1998 to 2003. Following Plattner's election as chairman of the SAP Supervisory Board in May 2003, Kagermann became sole chairman of the SAP Executive Board and CEO until he retired in May 2009. Kagermann had overall responsibility for SAP's strategy, business development and also oversaw the areas of global communications, global [[intellectual property]], internal audit, and talent management.

==Later career==
===Board memberships===
Kagermann is currently a member of the supervisory boards of [[Deutsche Bank]] AG and Münchener Rückversicherungs-Gesellschaft AG ([[Munich Re]]) in Germany, and in 2007 was made a member of the board of directors of [[Nokia|Nokia Corporation]]. In October 2009, [[Wipro Technologies|WIPRO]] also appointed Kagermann to its board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/26675/wipro-appoints-dr-henning-kagermann.html|title=Wipro appoints Dr Henning Kagermann to its board|date=Sep 21, 2009|publisher=[[Deccan Herald]]|accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, Kagermann became member of the Haniel board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-10/haniel-puts-former-sap-ceo-kagermann-on-board-handelsblatt-says.html|title=Haniel puts Kagermann on board|date=May 10, 2012|accessdate=2014-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political activities===
Since May 2010, Kagermann has been chairing the [[Nationale Plattform Elektromobilität|German National Platform for Electric Mobility]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nationale-plattform-elektromobilitaet.de/en/the-npe/organisation/|title=Kagermann as chairman of The German National Platform for Electric Mobility  |accessdate=2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kagermann is also known as one of the main proponents of the concept of [[Industry 4.0]], which applies increased digitization and the Internet of Things and Services to industrial production. In 2012, a working group led by Kagerman proposed the idea to the [[Federal Government of Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Behind-Germany-s-new-economic-push|title=Industry 4.0: Behind Germany's new economic push|date=December 16, 2014|accessdate=2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Kagermann was appointed by [[Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure|Federal Minister of Transport and Digital Infrastructure]] [[Alexander Dobrindt]] to serve on the German government’s Ethics Commission on Autonomous Driving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmvi.de/SharedDocs/DE/Anlage/Presse/ethik-kommission-mitglieder.pdf?__blob=publicationFile Member of the Ethics Commission on Autonomous Driving] [[Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure]], press release of 30 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

It superseded the IAU's previous recommendations of 1964 (see [[IAU (1964) System of Astronomical Constants]]), became in effect in the [[Astronomical Almanac]] from 1984 onward, and remained in use until the introduction of the [[IAU (2009) System of Astronomical Constants]].

== Units ==
The IAU(1976) system is based on the [[astronomical system of units]]:
* The astronomical unit of ''time'' is the day ('''D''') of 86,400 [[SI]] [[second]]s, which is close to the mean [[solar day]] of civil clock time.
* The astronomical unit of ''mass'' is the mass of the Sun ('''S''').
* The astronomical unit of ''length'' is known as '''the''' [[astronomical unit]] ('''A''' or '''au'''), which in the IAU(1976) system is defined as the length for which the [[gravitational constant]], more specifically the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]] '''k''' expressed in the astronomical units (''i.e.'' k&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; has units A&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;S&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;D&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;), takes the value of {{nowrap|0.017 202 098 95}} .  This astronomical unit is approximately the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun.  The value of '''k''' is the [[angular velocity]] in radians per day ('''i.e.''' the daily [[mean motion]]) of an infinitesimally small mass that moves around the Sun in a circular orbit at a distance of 1 AU.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11492">'''ISO 16610: Geometrical product specifications (GPS) – Filtration''' is a standard series on [[Surface metrology#Filtering|filters]] for [[surface texture]], and provides guidance on the use of these filters in various applications.
Filters are used in surface texture in order reduce the bandwidth of analysis in order to obtain functional correlation with physical phenomena such as friction, wear, adhesion, etc. For example, filters are used to separate [[Surface roughness|roughness]] and [[waviness]] from the primary profile, or to create a multiscale decomposition in order to identify the scale at which a phenomenon occurs. 
Historically, the first roughness measuring instruments - stylus [[profilometer]] - used to have electronic filters made of capacitors and resistors that filtered out low frequencies in order to retain frequencies that represent roughness. Later, digital filters replaced analog filters and international standards such as ISO 11562 for the [[Gaussian filter]] were published.

== Filter toolbox for surface texture ==

Today, a full set of filters is described in the ISO 16610 standard series. This standard is part of the GPS standards on Geometrical Product Specification and Verification, developed by ISO TC 213.

== Filter matrix ==
ISO 16610 is composed of two families of documents, one for profiles (open and closed) and one for surfaces. A general introduction is provided in:
* ISO 16610-1: ''Overview and basic concepts'' (published in 2015)

=== Profile filters ===
Profile filters are defined for open profiles, measured along a line by profilometers and expressed as z=f(x), as well as for closed profiles, measured around a circular component by roundness instruments and expressed as radius=f(angle). Most of these standards were first published as a Technical Specification (TS) and later converted to International Standards or withdrawn.

Parts related to profile filters are:
* ISO 16610-20: '' Linear profile filters: Basic concepts'' (published in 2015)
* ISO 16610-21: '' Linear profile filters: Gaussian filters'' (published in 2011)
* ISO 16610-22: '' Linear profile filters: Spline filters'' (published in 2015)
* ISO 16610-28: '' Linear profile filters: End effects'' (published in 2016)
* ISO 16610-29: '' Linear profile filters: Spline wavelets'' (published in 2015)
* ISO 16610-30: '' Robust profile filters: Basic concepts'' (published in 2015)
* ISO 16610-31: '' Robust profile filters: Gaussian regression filters'' (published in 2016)
* ISO 16610-32: '' Robust profile filters: Spline filters'' (published as a TS in 2009)
* ISO 16610-40: '' Morphological profile filters: Basic concepts'' (published in 2015)
* ISO 16610-41: '' Morphological profile filters: Disc and horizontal line-segment filters'' (published in 2015)
* ISO 16610-45: '' Morphological profile filters: Segmentation filters'' (planned for the future)
* ISO 16610-49: '' Morphological profile filters: Scale space techniques'' (published in 2015)

Note: ISO/TS 16610-32 on robust spline filters was published as a technical specification in 2009 but was withdrawn in 2015 as it provides very similar results as the Robust Gaussian regression filter while being much more complex.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=== Areal filters ===
Areal filters are defined for surfaces measured either by lateral scanning instruments or optical profilometers. 
Parts related to areal filters are:
* ISO 16610-60: ''Linear areal filter: Basic concepts'' (published in 2015)
* ISO 16610-61: ''Linear areal filter: Gaussian filters'' (published in 2015)
* ISO 16610-62: ''Linear areal filter: Spline filters''
* ISO 16610-68: ''Linear areal filter: End-effects'' (planned for the future)
* ISO 16610-69: ''Linear areal filter: Spline wavelets''
* ISO 16610-70: ''Robust areal filter: Basic concepts''
* ISO 16610-71: ''Robust areal filter: Gaussian regression filters'' (published in 2014)
* ISO 16610-80: ''Morphological areal filter: Basic concepts''
* ISO 16610-81: ''Morphological areal filter: Sphere and horizontal planar segment filters''
* ISO 16610-85: ''Morphological areal filter: Segmentation'' (published in 2013)
* ISO 16610-89: ''Morphological areal filter: Scale space techniques''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8939">In the 1980s, the economists Daniel Khazzoom and Leonard Brookes independently put forward ideas about [[energy consumption]] and behavior that argue that increased [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] [[paradox]]ically tends to lead to increased energy consumption.  In 1992, the US economist Harry Saunders dubbed this hypothesis the '''Khazzoom–Brookes postulate''', and showed that it was true under [[Neoclassical economics|neo-classical]] [[growth theory]] over a wide range of assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Harry D. |last1=Saunders |title=The Khazzoom-Brookes postulate and neoclassical growth |journal=The Energy Journal |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=131–148 |year=1992 |url=http://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:aen:journl:1992v13-04-a07 |issn=0195-6574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
In short, the postulate states that "energy efficiency improvements that, on the broadest considerations, are economically justified at the microlevel, lead to higher levels of energy consumption at the macrolevel." &lt;ref name="accepting"&gt;{{cite web|first=Horace |last=Herring |title=Does Energy Efficiency Save Energy: The Implications of accepting the Khazzoom-Brookes Postulate |date=April 1998 |publisher=EERU, the Open University |url=http://dse.ec.unipi.it/~luzzati/italiano/didattica/herringefficiency.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202225930/http://dse.ec.unipi.it/~luzzati/italiano/didattica/herringefficiency.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is a more modern analysis of a phenomenon known as the [[Jevons paradox|Jevons Paradox]]. In 1865, [[William Stanley Jevons]] observed that England's consumption of coal increased considerably after [[James Watt]] introduced his improvements to the steam engine. Jevons argued that increased efficiency in the use of coal would tend to increase the demand for coal, and would not reduce the rate at which England's deposits of coal were running out.

Like Jevons Paradox, the Khazzoom-Brookes Postulate is a deduction that is largely counter-intuitive as an efficiency paradox. When individuals change behavior and begin to use methods and devices that are more energy efficient, there are cases where, on a [[macro-economic]] level, energy usage actually increases." The effect of higher energy prices, either through taxes or producer-induced shortages, initially reduces demand but in the longer term encourages greater energy efficiency. This efficiency response amounts to a partial accommodation of the price rise and thus the reduction in demand is blunted. The end result is a new balance between supply and demand at a higher level of supply and consumption than if there had been no efficiency response."&lt;ref name="accepting" /&gt;

Increased energy efficiency can increase energy consumption by three means. Firstly, increased energy efficiency makes the use of energy relatively cheaper, thus encouraging increased use.  Secondly, increased energy efficiency leads to increased economic growth, which pulls up energy use in the whole economy.  Thirdly, increased efficiency in any one bottleneck resource multiplies the use of all the companion technologies, products and services that were being restrained by it.  One simple example is that suburban development limited by water use can be doubled if the houses adopt [[water efficiency]] measures that cut their water demand in half. That way a small efficiency can have large opposite multiplier effect.  Similarly cars that use less fuel are likely to cause matching increases in the number of cars and trips and companion travel activities rather than a decrease in energy demand. It appears that these latent multipliers of opposite effects may be generally greater than the linear result of the original effect.  As of late 2008 this appears{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} to not have been factored into the general discussion of [[sustainability]] and [[global warming mitigation]] strategies.

The work done by Khazzoom and Brookes began after the [[OPEC]] oil crises of [[1973 energy crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|1979]], when demand for more fuel-efficient automobiles began to rise. Although greater fuel efficiency was achieved for each automobile on average, overall consumption has continued to increase. "The OPEC oil shocks spawned huge improvements in energy efficiency, particularly insofar as oil was concerned. But three decades later, we find that the net effect of all of those efficiency initiatives has been to increase the world’s appetite for crude. While oil per unit of GDP has fallen impressively in large energy-consuming economies like the United States, total oil consumption, and indeed, total energy consumption, continue to grow by leaps and bounds. The increase in energy usage has dwarfed the gains in economic efficiency. Hence, instead of capping energy demand, what we observe is that improvements in energy efficiency lead to ever and ever-greater levels of energy usage",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Jeff |last1=Rubin |title=The Efficiency Paradox |date=27 November 2007 |work=Strategecon |publisher=CIBC World Markets |url=http://research.cibcwm.com/economic_public/download/snov07.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, rather, that improvements in energy efficiency were associated with increased energy usage. Many of the increases that can be seen from empirical data might as well have taken place without efficiency gains, possibly leading to even larger increases.

Further important considerations are the potentials and limits of the efficiency multiplier effect, considering efficiency as a kind of complex system learning process.  At the beginning of the [[learning curve]] efficiency and productivity improvements get physically easier to achieve and then later improvement slows as the difficulty of learning increases and the practically achievable level of efficiencies is reached.   In market systems the investor choices may be driven by physical benefits or financial ones independently, so they may conflict.  Promoting efficiencies that accelerate the depletion of resource necessities may raise their monetary value by increasing scarcity, and successively decreasing physical returns on investment [[EROEI]].   Accelerating toward terminal limits of resource utility is a form of [[tragedy of the commons]] following the equivalent of a maximum rate of depletion rather than a maximum longevity or utility principle.

The rebound effect will usually be larger if energy costs make up a large share of the total costs of a given product or its consumption, and will also depend on demand elasticities. For example, fuel efficiency of cars will lead to increased mileage to a larger extent than visits to restaurants would be increased by a better energy efficiency at restaurants (e.g. for cooking, fridges, heating): Energy costs make up a smaller amount of total costs for restaurants and will therefore influence their prices to a smaller extent, and thus also not the amount of visits to restaurants.

'''Lammas growth''', also called '''Lammas leaves''', '''Lammas flush''', '''second shoots''', or '''summer shoots''', is a season of renewed growth in some  trees in [[temperate]] regions put on in July and August (if in the northern hemisphere, January and February if in the southern), that is around [[Lammas]] day, August 1, which is the Celtic harvest festival. 

It can occur in both hardwoods and softwoods. Examples of common trees which exhibit regrowth are [[oak]], [[fraxinus|ash]], [[beech]], [[sycamore]], [[taxus|yew]], [[scots pine]], [[sitka spruce]] and [[Crataegus|hawthorn]]. This secondary growth may be an evolutionary strategy to compensate for leaf damage caused by insects during the spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/3352018/Late-summer-growth.html|title=Late summer growth|last=Guinness |first=Bunny |date=16 Aug 2006|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not present in [[Populus|poplar]], [[birch]] or [[willow]].

Lammas growth declines with the age of the tree, being most vigorous and noticeable in young trees. It  differs in nature from spring growth which is fixed when leaves and shoots are laid down in the bud the previous year. The lammas flush is free growth of newly made leaves/needles throughout the tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Battey|first=Nicholas H. |year=2003|title=August – learning about summer |journal=Journal of Experimental Botany|volume=  54|issue=  389|pages=1798|url=http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/54/389/1797.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; One or more of the buds set in the Spring on the ends of terminal and lateral stems will break, and begin to grow, producing a new shoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=West |first=Richard F. |author2=Rogers, Robert  |year=1965|title=THE EFFECT OF LAMMAS SHOOT GROWTH ON THE STEM FORM OF YOUNG SCOTCH PINE|journal=Published as a Paper of the Journal Series, New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station|url=http://www.rngr.net/Publications/neftic/17th-northeastern-forest-tree-improvement-conference-1971/the-effect-of-lammas-shoot-growth-on-the-stem-form-of-young-scotch-pine/file}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This '''list of [[impact crater]]s in [[Africa]]''' includes all [[List of impact craters on Earth#All craters listed alphabetically|20 confirmed impact craters]] as listed in the [[Earth Impact Database]]. These features were caused by the collision of large [[meteorites]] or [[comets]] with the Earth. For eroded or buried craters, the stated diameter typically refers to an estimate of original [[rim (craters)|rim]] diameter, and may not correspond to present surface features.

== Unconfirmed impact craters ==
{{main article|List of unconfirmed impact craters on Earth}}

The following craters are officially considered "unconfirmed" because they are not listed in the Earth Impact Database.  Due to stringent requirements regarding evidence and peer-reviewed publication, newly discovered craters or those with difficulty collecting evidence generally are known for some time before becoming listed.  However, entries on the unconfirmed list could still have an impact origin disproven.

[[File:S.lineatus.jpg|thumb|Desert Spider, ''[[Stegodyphus lineatus]]'', one of the best described species that participates in matriphagy]]

The specifics of how matriphagy occurs varies among different species, but the process is best described in the Desert spider, ''[[Stegodyphus lineatus]]'', where the mother harbors nutritional resources for her young through food consumption. The mother is able to regurgitate small portions of food for her growing [[offspring]], but between 1-2 weeks after hatching the progeny capitalize on this food source by eating her alive. Typically, offspring only feed on their biological mother as opposed to other females in the population. In other arachnid species, matriphagy occurs after the ingestion of nutritional eggs known as [[Trophic egg|trophic eggs]] (e.g. Black lace-weaver [[Amaurobius ferox|''Amaurobius ferox'']], Crab spider ''[[Diaea]] ergandros'') and involves different techniques for killing the mother, such as transfer of poison via biting and sucking to cause a quick death (e.g. Black lace-weaver) or continuous sucking of the [[hemolymph]], resulting in a more gradual death (e.g. Crab spider'').'' The behavior is less well described but follows a similar pattern in species such as the Hump [[earwig]], [[Pseudoscorpion|pseudoscorpions]], and [[Caecilian|caecilians]].

Spiders that engage in matriphagy produce offspring with higher weights, shorter and earlier [[moulting]] time, larger body mass at [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]], and higher survival rates than [[Clutch (eggs)|clutches]] deprived of matriphagy. In some species, matriphagous offspring were also more successful at capturing large prey items and had a higher survival rate at dispersal. These benefits to offspring outweigh the cost of survival to the mothers and help ensure that her genetic material is passed to the next generation, thus perpetuating the behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Toyama|first=Masatoshi|date=2003|title=Relationship between reproductive resource allocation and resource capacity in the matriphagous spider, Chiracanthium japonicum (Araneae: Clubionidae)|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10164-002-0067-6|journal=Journal of Ethology|volume=21|pages=1–7|via=Springer Link|doi=10.1007/s10164-002-0067-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salomon|first=Mor|last2=Schneider|first2=Jutta|last3=Lubin|first3=Yael|date=2005-2006|title=Maternal investment in a spider with suicidal maternal care, Stegodyphus lineatus (Araneae, Eresidae)|journal=Oikos|language=en|volume=109|issue=3|pages=614–622|doi=10.1111/j.0030-1299.2005.13004.x|issn=0030-1299}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Toyama|first=Masatoshi|date= March 1999|title=Adaptive advantages of maternal care and matriphagy in a foliage spider,Chiracanthium japonicum (Araneae: Coubionidae)|journal=Journal of Ethology|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=33–39|doi=10.1007/bf02769295|issn=0289-0771}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=Theodore A.|last2=Wallis|first2=Elycia J.|last3=Elgar|first3=Mark A.|date= July 1995|title=Making a meal of mother|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=376|issue=6538|pages=299–300; author reply 301|doi=10.1038/376299a0|pmid=7630393|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, matriphagy is an extreme form of [[parental care]] but is highly related to extended care in the Funnel-web spider, parental investment in caecilians, and gerontophagy in social spiders. The uniqueness of this phenomenon has led to several expanded analogies in human culture and contributed to the pervasive fear of spiders throughout society.&lt;ref name=":C1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":C2" /&gt;

== Etymology ==
Matriphagy can be broken down into two components:

* Matri (mother)
* Phagy (to feed on)

== Description of behavior ==
Matriphagy generally consists of offspring consuming their mother; however, different species exhibit different variations of this behavior.

=== Spiders ===

==== Black lace-weaver'': Amaurobius ferox'' ====
[[File:Amaurobius_ferox._Black_Lace-weaver_-_Flickr_-_gailhampshire.jpg|thumb|This Black lace-weaver (''[[Amaurobius ferox]]'') female adult will eventually be consumed by her offspring. ]]
In many Black lace-weavers, ''[[Amaurobius ferox]]'', offspring do not immediately consume their mother. A day after offspring emerge from their eggs, their mother lays a set of [[Trophic egg|trophic eggs]], which contain nutrition for the offspring to consume.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Matriphagy commences days later when the mother begins communicating with her offspring through web vibrations, drumming, and jumping.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Kil-Won|last2=Horel|first2=André|date=2010-04-26|title=Matriphagy in the Spider Amaurobius ferox (Araneidae, Amaurobiidae): an Example of Mother-Offspring Interactions|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1439-0310.1998.tb00050.x|journal=Ethology|language=en|volume=104|issue=12|pages=1021–1037|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1998.tb00050.x|issn=0179-1613}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salomon|first=M.|last2=Aflalo|first2=E. D.|last3=Coll|first3=M.|last4=Lubin|first4=Y.|date=2014|title=Dramatic histological changes preceding suicidal maternal care in the subsocial spiderStegodyphus lineatus(Araneae: Eresidae)|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/10.1636/B14-15.1|journal=Journal of Arachnology|language=en-US|volume=43|issue=1|pages=77–85|doi=10.1636/b14-15.1|issn=0161-8202|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; Through these behaviors, offspring are able to detect when and where they can consume their mother. They migrate towards her and a couple of the [[spider]]lings jump onto her back to consume her.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In response, the mother jumps and drums more frequently to keep her offspring off of her, however, they relentlessly continue attempting to get onto her back.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; When the mother feels ready, she presses her body onto her offspring and allows them to consume her via sucking on her insides.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; As they consume her, they also release poison into her body, causing a quick death.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The mother’s body is kept for a few weeks as a nutritional reserve.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 

Interestingly, matriphagy in this species is dependent on the developmental stage that the offspring are currently at.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; If offspring, older than four days, are given to an unrelated mother, they refuse to consume her.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, if younger offspring are given to an unrelated mother, they readily consume her.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Additionally, if a mother loses her offspring, she is able to produce another clutch of offspring.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

====Crab spider: ''Diaea ergandros'' ====
[[File:Ozyptila_praticola_-_front_(aka).jpg|thumb|Crab spider, ''Diasea ergandros'']]
Mothers of one particular species of the [[Thomisidae|crab spider]], ''Diaea ergandros,'' are only able to lay one clutch, unlike the Black lace-weaver.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; They invest a significant amount of time and energy into storing nutrients and food into large [[Oocyte|oocytes]], known as [[Trophic egg|trophic eggs]], similar to the Black lace-weaver.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, these trophic eggs are too large to physically leave her body.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Some of the nutrients from the trophic eggs are liquefied into [[Hemolymph|haemolymph]], which can be consumed through the mother’s leg joints by her offspring.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; She gradually shrinks until she becomes immobile and dies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;   

In this species, it has been shown that this behavior may contribute to reducing [[cannibalism]] by siblings.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Desert Spider: ''Stegodyphus lineatus'' ====
Right after hatching, desert spider, ''[[Stegodyphus lineatus|Stegodyphus lineatus,]]'' hatchlings rely solely upon their mother to provide them with food and nutrients. Their mother does this by regurgitating her bodily fluids, which contain a mixture of nutrients for them to feed on.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 

This behavior begins during mating. Mating causes an increase in the mother’s production of digestive enzymes to better digest her prey. Consequently, she is able to retain more nutrients for her offspring to consume later. The mother’s [[Midgut|midgut tissues]] start to slowly degrade during the incubation period of her eggs. After her offspring hatch, she regurgitates food for them to feed on with the help of her already-liquefied midgut tissues. Meanwhile, her midgut tissues continue to degrade into a liquid state to maximize the amount of nutrients from the mother’s body that her offspring will be able to obtain. As degradation continues, [[Vacuole|nutritional vacuoles]] form within her abdomen to amass all of the nutrients. Consumption begins when her offspring puncture her abdomen to suck up the nutritional vacuoles. After approximately 2-3 hours, the mother’s bodily fluids are completely consumed, and only her exoskeleton remains.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; 

This species is only able to have one clutch, which might explain why so much time and energy is spent on taking care of offspring. Furthermore, matriphagy can also occur between offspring and mothers who have recently laid eggs that are not related.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; 

=== Hump earwig ===

==== ''Anechura harmandi'' ====
''Anechura harmandi'' is the only species of [[Earwig|Earwigs]] that has been currently documented to exhibit matriphagy. Mothers in this particular species of Earwigs have been found to reproduce during colder temperatures.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suzuki|first=Seizi|last2=Kitamura|first2=Masashi|last3=Matsubayashi|first3=Kei|title=Matriphagy in the hump earwig, ''Anechura harmandi'' (Dermaptera: Forficulidae), increases the survival rates of the offspring|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10164-005-0145-7.pdf|journal=Journal of Ethology|language=en|volume=23|issue=2|doi=10.1007/s10164-005-0145-7.pdf|issn=0289-0771}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is mainly for the purpose of avoiding predation and maximizing their offspring's survival, since females are unable to produce a second clutch.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Due to the cold temperature, there is a scarcity of available nutrients when the offspring hatch, which is why the offspring end up consuming their mother.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; [[File:Paratemnoides_nidificator.jpg|thumb|A group of pseudoscorpion  (''Paratemnoides nidificator'') adults, the females of which will eventually be subject to matriphagy.|201x201px]]

===Pseudoscorpions===
==== ''Paratemnoides nidificator'' ====
Matriphagy in this species of [[Pseudoscorpion|Pseudoscorpions]] is usually observed during times of food scarcity.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tizo-Pedroso|first=Everton|last2=Del-Claro|first2=Kleber|date=2005|title=MATRIPHAGY IN THE NEOTROPICAL PSEUDOSCORPION PARATEMNOIDES NIDIFICATOR (BALZAN 1888) (ATEMNIDAE)|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/10.1636/S03-61.1|journal=Journal of Arachnology|language=en-US|volume=33|issue=3|pages=873–877|doi=10.1636/s03-61.1|issn=0161-8202|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After their offspring hatch, mothers exit their nests and await to be consumed.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Offspring follow their mothers out of the nest where they grab onto her legs and proceed to feed through her leg joints, similar to that of ''Diaea ergandros''.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;  

Females of this species are able to produce more than one clutch of offspring if their first clutch was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; 

Matriphagy in this species has been predicted to prevent cannibalism between siblings as well.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Vertebrates ===
[[File:Boulengerula_taitanus_1.jpg|thumb|''Boulengerula taitanus'', a species of Caecilians known to exhibit matriphagy.|200x200px]]

==== Caecilians ====
[[Caecilian|Caecilians]] are the only [[vertebrate]] animals with well-documented matriphagous behaviours. In [[Viviparity|viviparous]] caecilians, the young consume the mother's [[oviduct]] lining by scraping it off with their teeth. In at least two species, ''[[Boulengerula taitana]]'' and ''[[Siphonops annulatus]]'', the young feed on the mother's skin by tearing it off with their teeth, which then regenerates within a few days.&lt;ref name="kupfer1"/&gt; Because neither are closely related, either this behaviour is more common than currently observed or it evolved independently.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Wilkinson; et al. (June 2008). "One hundred million years of skin feeding? Extended parental care in a Neotropical caecilian (Amphibia: Gymnophiona)". Biology Letters. 4 (4): 358–61. doi:10.1098/rsbl.2008.0217. PMC 2610157. {{PMID|18547909}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolution ==
The [[Adaptation|adaptive]] value of matriphagy is based on the benefits provided to the offspring and the costs borne by the mother &lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;. Functionally analyzing matriphagy in this manner sheds light on why this unusual and extreme form of care has [[evolved]] and been selected for. 

=== Benefits to offspring ===

* Consuming the mother is a source of [[nutrition]] which is important for growth and development.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* The body mass and [[opisthosoma]] length of spiderlings increases after matriphagy compared to before (opisthosoma is the [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] part of the body in spiders, analogous to the [[abdomen]]). Additionally, body mass tends to be higher for spiderlings that engage in matriphagy as compared to those that do not.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* Matriphagy advances [[Moulting|molting]] time. Molting is the growing of a larger [[exoskeleton]] and shedding the old one. Advancement of molting time means that the spiders are able to grow at a faster rate.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* Matriphagous spiderlings tend to experience significantly greater survival rates and fitness compared to non-matriphagous offspring at dispersal.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
* Matriphagous spiderlings hunt larger [[prey]] and show much more complete prey consumption than non-matriphagous spiderlings.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* Matriphagy improves [[sociality]] in spiders, primarily by reducing sibling [[cannibalism]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Costs to the mother===
Unlike other milder forms of parental care, matriphagy ends with the life of the mother, the gravest of all costs. So, why has it evolved? In order to answer this, it is important to look at costs to the mother in terms of reproductive output, [[egg sac]] development, and number of young reared (i.e. are offspring more successful if the mother evades matriphagy and reproduces again or if she engages in matriphagy and produces only one clutch?). 

* In the Black lace-weaver, ''[[Amaurobius ferox]]'' around 80% of females separated prior to matriphagy produce second egg sacs and only approximately 40% of these develop completely (compared to the &gt;90% development of egg sacs in the first brood).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* Additionally, number of spiderlings in the second brood tend to be significantly lower than in the first brood. These individuals are also smaller than the spiders in the first brood.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* Females that successively lay two egg sacs have a lower expected output of dispersing offspring than females that are victims of matriphagy and produce only a single clutch.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Summary===
In conclusion, offspring that engage in matriphagy benefit more than those that do not engage in this behavior. Furthermore, the progeny of females that escape matriphagy to lay a second brood are significantly less successful than those that ate their mother. Hence, enhanced fitness of the mother accounts for the evolution of this unusual and extreme form of parenting. 

== Forms of parental care similar to matriphagy  ==
Matriphagy is one of the most extreme forms of [[parental care]] observed in the animal kingdom. However, in some species such as the Funnel-web spider ''[[Coelotes|Coelotes terrestris]]'', matriphagy is only observed under certain conditions and extended maternal protection is the main method by which offspring receive care. In other organisms such as the African social velvet spider, ''[[Stegodyphus]] mimosarum'' and [[Caecilian]] amphibians, parental behavior closely related in form and function to matriphagy is used.  

=== Extended care in a Funnel-web spider: ''Coelotes'' ''terrestris''===
The ‘maternal social’ spider, ''[[Coelotes|Coelotes terrestris]]'' (Funnel-web spider) uses extended maternal care as a reproductive model for its offspring. Upon laying the [[egg sac]], a C. terrestris mother stands guard and incubates the sac for 3 to 4 weeks. She stays with her young from the time of their emergence until dispersal approximately 5 to 6 weeks later. During the offsprings’ development, mothers will provide the spiderlings prey based on their levels of gregariousness.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gundermann|first=Jean-Luc|last2=Horel|first2=André|last3=Roland|first3=Chantal|date=2010-04-26|title=Costs and Benefits of Maternal Care in a Subsocial Spider, Coelotes terrestris|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1439-0310.1997.tb00133.x|journal=Ethology|language=en|volume=103|issue=11|pages=915–925|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1997.tb00133.x|issn=0179-1613}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Coelotes_terrestris.jpg|thumb|Image of a Funnel-web spider (''Coelotes terrestris'')]]
Protecting the egg sacs from [[predation]] and parasites yields a high benefit to cost ratio for the mothers. [[Fitness (biology)|Fitness]] of the mother is highly correlated to offspring developmental state—a mother in better condition yields larger young that are better at surviving predation. The presence of the mother also protects the offspring against [[parasitism]]. In addition, the mother can keep feeding while guarding her [[Offspring|progeny]] without any weight loss, allowing her to collect sufficient food for both herself and her offspring.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; 

Overall, costs of protecting the egg sac are low. Upon separation from egg sacs, 90% of females have the energy sustenance to lay new sacs, although it does induce a time loss of several weeks that could potentially affect reproductive success.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; 

In experimental conditions, costs arose if maternal care was not provided, with egg sacs drying out and developing [[Mold|molds]], thus illustrating that maternal care is essential for survival. Experimental food-deprived broods reared by the mother induced matriphagy, where 77% of offspring consumed their mother upon birth. This suggests that matriphagy can exist under nutrient-limited conditions, but the costs generally outweigh the benefits when mothers have sufficient access to resources.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

=== Parental investment by skin-feeding in Caecilian amphibians  ===
[[Caecilian]] amphibians are worm-like in appearance, and mothers have thick [[Epithelium|epithelial]] skin layers. The skin on a caecilian mother is used for a form of parent-offspring nutrient transfer. 
[[File:Siphonops annulatus.jpg|thumb|The ringed caecilian is an example of an oviparous caecilian that exhibits parental investment through skin-feeding of the oviduct lining.]]
The Taita African caecilian ''[[Boulengerula taitana]]'' is an [[Oviparity|oviparous]] (egg-laying) caecilian whose skin transforms in brooding females to supply nutrients to growing offspring. The offspring are born with specific [[dentition]] that they can use to peel and eat the outer [[Epidermis|epidermal]] later of their mother’s skin. Young move around their mother’s bodies, using their lower jaws to lift and peel the mother’s skin while vigorously pressing their heads against her [[abdomen]]. To account for this, the epidermis of brooding females can be up to twice the thickness of non-brooding females.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kupfer|first=Alexander|last2=Müller|first2=Hendrik|last3=Antoniazzi|first3=Marta M.|last4=Jared|first4=Carlos|last5=Greven|first5=Hartmut|last6=Nussbaum|first6=Ronald A.|last7=Wilkinson|first7=Mark|date=2006|title=Parental investment by skin feeding in a caecilian amphibian|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04403|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=440|issue=7086|pages=926–929|doi=10.1038/nature04403|issn=0028-0836|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Viviparity|Viviparous]] (developing in the mother) caecilians on the other hand, have specialized fetal dentition which can be used for scraping [[lipid]]-rich secretions and cellular materials from the maternal [[oviduct]] lining. The ringed caecilian ''[[Siphonops annulatus]]'', an oviparous caecilian, exhibits characteristics similar to viviparous caecilians. Mothers have paler skin tones than non-attending females, suggesting that offspring feed on [[Gland|glandular]] secretions on the mother’s skin—a process that resembles mammalian [[lactation]]. This scraping method is different from the peeling actions performed by oviparous caecilians.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

For both oviparous and viviparous caecilians, delayed investment is a common benefit. Providing nutrition through the skin allows for redirection of nutrients, yielding fewer and larger offspring than caecilians who only provide their offspring with [[Yolk sac|yolk]] nutrients.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rather than the mother sacrificing herself and solely being used for the offspring’s nutrition, caecilian mothers supplement their offspring’s growth; they provide enough nutrients for the offspring to survive, but not at the cost of their own life. 

=== Gerontophagy in social spiders, Genus ''Stegodyphus''===
[[File:Colonial_Spiders_(Stegodyphus_dumicola)_(6607372243).jpg|thumb|An example of social spiders (Stegodyphus dumicola) that have been found to participate in gerontophagy as a form of parental care. |240x240px]]
''[[Stegodyphus]]'' mothers [[Liquefaction|liquefy]] their inner [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] and maternal [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] into food deposits. The African social velvet spider ''Stegodyphus mimosarum'' and the African social spider ''Stegodyphus dumicola'' are two social spider species that eat their mothers and other adult females, which is unique since social spiders do not tend to exhibit [[Cannibalism|cannibalistic]] life history traits. In these specific spiders, deceased females are often found shriveled with shrunken abdomens. Offspring suck nutrients primarily from the [[dorsal]] part of the adult female's abdomen, and she may still be alive during this process.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1987-12-01|title=Gerontophagy versus cannibalism in the social spiders Stegodyphus mimosarum Pavesi and Stegodyphus dumicola Pocock|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347287800878|journal=Animal Behaviour|language=en|volume=35|issue=6|pages=1903–1905|doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(87)80087-8|issn=0003-3472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This behavior is not quite the same as matriphagy because ''Stegodyphus'' spiderlings are perfectly tolerant to other offspring, healthy [[conspecifics]], and members of other species, suggesting that ordinary cannibalism is suppressed. Instead, the parental care exhibited is known as "gerontophagy", or the “consumption of old individuals” (geron = old person, phagy = to feed on). Gerontophagy is the final act of care for the offspring, and some offspring are found larger than others. This implies that some young spiders are already able to feed on prey by themselves and gerontophagy as a source of nutrition is supplemental rather than necessary. Thus, there exists the ‘cannibal’s kin-dilemma’, which reveals a form of [[kin selection]] in social spiders. In this scenario, kin selection should counteract cannibalism of related individuals in social spiders, but any designated victim should prefer to be eaten by available close relatives.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Cultural significance  ==
[[File:Become a certified professional with free online classes.jpg|thumb|The rise of online education as an alternative to costly traditional college options can be compared to matriphagy as a survival mechanism.]]
Although matriphagy is not a widely circulated term in society, there are specific instances where it has been used to represent or symbolize specific ideas. For instance, Dr. Luke Winslow from San Diego State University dubbed the concept "rhetorical matriphagy" in 2017 in connection with critiques of increasing online [[higher education]] offerings.&lt;ref name=":C1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Winslow |first1=Luke |title=Rhetorical Matriphagy and the Online Commodification of Higher Education |journal=Western Journal of Communication |date=28 Apr 2017 |volume=81 |issue=5 |pages=582–600 |doi=10.1080/10570314.2017.1316418}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this analogy, higher education assumes the role of the mother, [[neoliberalism]] assumes the role of the hatchlings, and online education discourse assumes the role of the mother’s symbolic resources, which are used to attract hatchings and eventually lead them to engage in matriphagy for these resources.&lt;ref name=":C1" /&gt; The theory behind the existence of matriphagy is similar to that of higher education. Matriphagy is a less than ideal [[survival mechanism]] in response to an environment with poor conditions and few natural resources, but it persists because of guaranteed survival of the mother’s [[Gene|genes]] via her hatchlings.&lt;ref name=":C1" /&gt; Similarly, online education does not consider itself at the same level as traditional forms of higher education but does provide an [[equal opportunity]] for all to attain such education in a cost-effective way that satisfies most stakeholders in the process.&lt;ref name=":C1" /&gt;

Those who have been exposed to matriphagy may be frightened by such a seemingly strange and bizarre natural behavior, especially since it is mainly observed in already feared organisms. Thus, matriphagy is often posed as perpetuation of a long held fear of [[arachnid]]s in human society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Barness |first1=Sarah |title=Spider Babies Eat Their Mother From The Inside Out, Giving Us Another Reason To Be Terrified Of Arachnids |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/01/spiders-eat-mom_n_4703235.html |agency=HuffPost |date=2 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, others may look to matriphagy as a leading example of purity, as it represents an instinctive form of [[altruism]]. Altruism in this case refers to an "intentional action ultimately for the welfare of others that entails at least the possibility of either no benefit or a loss to the actor," and is a highly popularized and desirable concept in many human cultures.&lt;ref name=":C2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Montayne |first1=James A. |title=Review of 'Does Altruism Exist? Culture, Genes, and the Welfare of Others' |journal=The Independent Review |date=2016 |volume=20 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matriphagy can be viewed as altruism, insofar as participating mothers "sacrifice" their survival for the welfare of their offspring.&lt;ref name=":C2" /&gt; Although participation in matriphagy is not truly an intentional action, mothers are nevertheless driven by [[natural selection]] pressures based on offspring [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] to engage in such behavior.&lt;ref name=":C2" /&gt; This in turn creates a cycle that perpetuates altruistic matriphagous behavior through generations. Such an example of altruism on a purely biological level differs severely from human standards of altruism, which are tainted by moral virtues such as [[rationality]], [[Trust (emotion)|trust]], and [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]].&lt;ref name=":C2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1651">'''Matteo''' or '''Mathieu Campani-Alimenis''' (born in [[Spoleto]], [[Italy]]) was a mechanician and natural philosopher of the 17th century.

[[File:Matteo Campani – Excellentiss. principi Sigismundo Chisio ... Noua, 1666 - BEIC 1229597.jpg|thumb|''Noua experimenta physico-mechanica'' (1666)]]

He held a [[curacy]] at [[Rome]] in 1661, but devoted himself principally to scientific pursuits. As an optician he is chiefly celebrated for, the manufacture of the large object-glasses with which [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini|Cassini]] discovered two of [[Saturn]]'s satellites, and for an attempt to rectify chromatic aberration by using a triple eyeglass; and in clock-making, for his invention of the illuminated dial-plate, and that of noiseless clocks, as well as for an attempt to correct the irregularities of the [[pendulum]] which arise from variations of temperature. Campani published in 1678 a work on [[horology]], and on the manufacture of lenses for [[telescope]]s.

His younger brother [[Giuseppe Campani|Giuseppe]] was also an ingenious optician (indeed the attempt to correct chromatic aberration has been ascribed to him instead of to Matteo), and is, besides, noteworthy as an [[astronomer]], especially for his discovery, by the aid of a telescope of his own construction, of the spots in [[Jupiter]], the credit of which was, however, also claimed by [[Eustachio Divini]].

In [[statistics]], the '''maximal information coefficient''' ('''MIC''') is a measure of the strength of the linear or non-linear association between two variables ''X'' and&amp;nbsp;''Y''.

The MIC belongs to the maximal information-based nonparametric exploration (MINE) class of statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Reshef | first1 = D. N. | last2 = Reshef | first2 = Y.

Kinney, Gurinder S. Atwal, arXiv Jan. 31, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; although this result has been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/111/21/E2160.extract R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-equitability is satisfiable by Ben Murrell, Daniel Murrell, and Hugh Murrell, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, May. 27, 2014 ]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some criticisms of MIC are addressed by Reshef et al. in further studies published on arXiv.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6314v1 Equitability Analysis of the Maximal Information Coefficient, with Comparisons by David Reshef, Yakir Reshef, Michael Mitzenmacher, Pardis Sabeti, arXiv Jan. 27, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The maximal information coefficient uses [[Data binning|binning]] as a means to apply  [[Mutual Information|mutual information]] on continuous random variables. Binning has been used for some time as a way of applying mutual information to continuous distributions; what MIC contributes in addition is a methodology for selecting the number of bins and picking a maximum over many possible grids.

The rationale is that the bins for both variables should be chosen in such a way that the mutual information between the variables be maximal. That is achieved whenever &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{H}\left(X_b\right)=\mathrm{H}\left(Y_b\right)=\mathrm{H}\left(X_b,Y_b\right)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The "b" subscripts have been used to emphasize that the mutual information is calculated using the bins&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when the mutual information is maximal over a binning of the data, we should expect that the following two properties hold, as much as made possible by the own nature of the data. First, the bins would have roughly the same size, because the entropies &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{H}(X_b)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{H}(Y_b)&lt;/math&gt; are maximized by equal-sized binning. And second, each bin of ''X'' will roughly correspond to a bin in ''Y''.

Because the variables X and Y are reals, it is almost always possible to create exactly one bin for each (''x'',''y'') datapoint, and that would yield a very high value of the MI. To avoid forming this kind of trivial partitioning, the authors of the paper propose taking a number of bins &lt;math&gt;n_x&lt;/math&gt; for ''X'' and &lt;math&gt;n_y&lt;/math&gt; whose product is relatively small compared with the size N of the data sample. Concretely, they propose:

&lt;math&gt;n_x\times n_y \leq \mathrm{N}^{0.6} &lt;/math&gt;

In some cases it is possible to achieve a good correspondence between &lt;math&gt;X_b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y_b&lt;/math&gt; with numbers as low as &lt;math&gt;n_x=2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_y=2&lt;/math&gt;, while in other cases the number of bins required may be higher. The maximum for &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{I}(X_b;Y_b)&lt;/math&gt; is determined by H(X), which is in turn determined by the number of bins in each axis, therefore, the mutual information value will be dependent on the number of bins selected for each variable. In order to  compare mutual information values obtained with partitions of different sizes, the mutual information value is normalized by dividing by the maximum achieveable value for the given partition size. It is worth noting that a similar adaptive binning procedure for estimating mutual information had been proposed previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fraser|first=Andrew M.|last2=Swinney|first2=Harry L.|date=1986-02-01|title=Independent coordinates for strange attractors from mutual information|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevA.33.1134|journal=Physical Review A|volume=33|issue=2|pages=1134–1140|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.33.1134}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Entropy is maximized by uniform probability distributions, or in this case, bins with the same number of elements. Also, joint entropy is minimized by having a one-to-one correspondence between bins. If we substitute such values in the formula
&lt;math&gt;I(X;Y)=H(X)+H(Y)-H(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt;, we can see that the maximum value achieveable by the MI for a given pair &lt;math&gt;n_x,n_y&lt;/math&gt; of bin counts is &lt;math&gt;\log\min\left(n_x,n_y\right)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, this value is used as a normalizing divisor for each pair of bin counts.

Last, the normalized maximal mutual information value for different combinations of &lt;math&gt;n_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_y&lt;/math&gt; is tabulated, and the maximum value in the table selected as the value of the statistic.

It is important to note that trying all possible binning schemes that satisfy  &lt;math&gt;n_x\times n_y \leq \mathrm{N}^{0.6} &lt;/math&gt;  is computationally unfeasible even for small n. Therefore, in practice the authors apply a heuristic which may or may not find the true maximum.

This instrument, labelled ''Crichton - London, Sold by J Berry, Aberdeen'', appears to have an [[ebony]] frame with [[ivory]] scale, [[Vernier scale|vernier]] and signature plate.  The index arm and mirror supports are brass.  Rather than use a sighting telescope, this instrument has a sighting pinnula.]]

The '''octant''', also called '''reflecting [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]]''', is a [[measuring instrument]] used primarily in [[navigation]]. It is a type of [[reflecting instrument]].

==Etymology==
The name ''octant'' derives from the Latin ''octans'' meaning ''eighth part of a circle'', because the instrument's arc is one eighth of a circle.

''Reflecting quadrant'' derives from the instrument using mirrors to reflect the path of light to the observer and, in doing so, doubles the angle measured.  This allows the instrument to use a one-eighth of a [[Turn (geometry)|turn]] to measure a quarter-[[Turn (geometry)|turn]] or [[Circular sector|quadrant]].

==Origin of the octant==
===Newton's reflecting quadrant===
[[File:Newton's reflecting quadrant.png|thumb|Drawing of Newton's Reflecting Quadrant. From {{harvtxt|Brewster|1855|p=243}}.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

A-B - sighting telescope&lt;br /&gt;
C-D - index arm&lt;br /&gt;
G - horizon mirror&lt;br /&gt;
H - index mirror&lt;br /&gt;
P-Q - graduated arc]]
[[Isaac Newton]]'s reflecting quadrant was invented around 1699.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Newton |first=Isaac |author-link=Isaac Newton |title=A true Copy of a Paper found, in the Hand Writing of Sir Isaac Newton, among the Papers of the late Dr. Halley, containing a Description of an Instrument for observing the Moon's distance from the Fixt Stars at Sea |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society |volume=42 |issue=465 |pages=155–156 and plate |date=October–November 1742 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8FeAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=155 |quote=By this instrument the distance of the moon from any fixed star is thus observed; view the star through the perspicil by the direct light, and the moon by the reflexed, (or on the contrary;) and turn the index till the star touch the limb of the moon, and the index shall show on the brass limb of the instrument the distance of the star from the moon's limb; and though the instrument shake by the motion of the ship at sea, yet the moon and star will move together as if they did really touch one another in the heavens; so that an observation may be made as exactly at sea as at land. And by the same instrument, may be observed exactly the altitudes of the moon and stars, by bringing them to the horizon; and thereby the latitude and times of observation may be determined more exactly than by the ways now in use.}} [https://archive.org/details/philosophicaltra4217roya Vol. 42 at archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;   A detailed description of the instrument was given to [[Edmond Halley]], but the description was not published until after Halley's death in 1742.  It is not known why Halley did not publish the information during his life, as this prevented Newton from getting the credit for the invention that is generally given to [[John Hadley]] and [[Thomas Godfrey (inventor)|Thomas Godfrey]].

One copy of this instrument was constructed by Thomas Heath (instrument maker) and may have been shown in Heath's shop window prior to its being published by the Royal Society in 1742.&lt;ref name="egrtaylor"&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor |first=E. G. R. |title=The Haven-finding Art: A History of Navigation from Odysseus to Captain Cook |publisher=Hollis &amp;amp; Carter |location=London |date=1971 |isbn=0-370-01347-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton's instrument used two mirrors, but they were used in an arrangement somewhat different from the two mirrors found in modern octants and [[sextant]]s.  The diagram on the right shows the configuration of the instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Brewster |author-link=David Brewster |title=Memoirs of the Life, Writings, and Discoveries of Sir Isaac Newton |publisher=Thomas Constable &amp;amp; Co. |location=Edinburgh |date=1855 |volume=Vol. 1 |pages=239&amp;ndash;242. |url=https://archive.org/details/memoirslifewrit03brewgoog |ref=harv}} [http://www.newtonproject.ox.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/OTHE00126 excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 45° arc of the instrument (P-Q), was [[Graduation (instrument)|graduated]] with 90 divisions of a half-degree each. Each such division was subdivided into 60 parts and each part further divided into sixths.  This results in the arc being marked in degrees, minutes and sixths of a minute (10 seconds).  Thus the instrument could have readings interpolated to 5 seconds of arc.  This fineness of graduation is only possible due to the large size of the instrument - the sighting telescope alone was three to four feet long.

A ''sighting [[telescope]]'' (A-B), three or four feet long, was mounted along one side of the instrument.  A ''horizon mirror'' was fixed at a 45° angle in front of the telescope's [[objective lens]] (G).  This mirror was small enough to allow the observer to see the image in the mirror on one side and to see directly ahead on the other.  The index arm (C-D) held an index mirror (H), also at 45° to the edge of the index arm.  The reflective sides of the two mirrors nominally faced each other, so that the image seen in the first mirror is that reflected from the second.
[[File:Newton quadrant detail.png|thumb|Details of the mirrors on Newton's reflecting quadrant, showing the light paths (red) through the instrument. This image is turned 90° anticlockwise relative to the one above.]]
With the two mirrors parallel, the index reads 0°.  The view through the telescope sees directly ahead on one side and the view from the mirror G sees the same image reflected from mirror H (see detail drawing to the right).  When the index arm is moved from zero to a large value, the ''index mirror'' reflects an image that is in a direction away from the direct line of sight.  As the index arm movement increases, the line of sight for the index mirror moves toward S (to the right in the detail image).  This shows a slight deficiency with this mirror arrangement.  The horizon mirror will block the view of the index mirror at angles approaching 90°.

The length of the sighting telescope seems remarkable, given the small size of the telescopes on modern instruments.  This was likely Newton's choice of a way to reduce [[chromatic aberration#Minimizing chromatic aberration|chromatic aberration]]s.  Short–[[focal length]] telescopes, prior to the development of [[achromatic doublet|achromatic lenses]], produced an objectionable degree of aberration, so much so that it could affect the perception of a star's position.  Long focal lengths were the solution, and this telescope would likely have had both a long–focal length [[objective lens]] and a long–focal length [[eyepiece]].  This would decrease aberrations without excessive magnification.

===The inventors of the octant===
Two men independently developed the octant around 1730: [[John Hadley]] (1682–1744), an English mathematician, and [[Thomas Godfrey (inventor)|Thomas Godfrey]] (1704–1749), a glazier in [[Philadelphia]].  While both have a legitimate and equal claim to the invention, Hadley generally gets the greater share of the credit.  This reflects the central role that London and the Royal Society played in the history of scientific instruments in the eighteenth century.

Two others who created octants during this period were Caleb Smith, an English insurance broker with a strong interest in astronomy (in 1734), and Jean-Paul Fouchy, a mathematics professor and astronomer in [[France]] (in 1732).

===Hadley's versions===
[[File:Hadley's reflecting quadrant.png|thumb|Hadley's reflecting quadrant. This instrument follows the form of Newton's reflecting quadrant from 1699]]
Hadley produced two versions of the reflecting quadrant.  Only the second is well known and is the familiar octant.

====Hadley's reflecting quadrant====
Hadley's first reflecting quadrant was a simple device with a frame spanning a 45° arc.  In the image at the right, from Hadley's article in the ''Philosophical Transactions'' of the Royal Society,&lt;ref name="Hadley PTRS"/&gt; you can see the nature of his design.  A small sighting telescope was mounted on the frame along one side.  One large ''index mirror'' was mounted at the point of rotation of the index arm. A second, smaller ''horizon mirror'' was mounted on the frame in the line of sight of the telescope.  The horizon mirror allows the observer to see the image of the index mirror in one half of the view and to see a distant object in the other half.  A shade was mounted at the vertex of the instrument to allow one to observe a bright object.  The shade pivots to allow it to move out of the way for stellar observations.

Observing through the telescope, the navigator would sight one object directly ahead.  The second object would be seen by reflection in the horizon mirror.  The light in the horizon mirror is reflected from the index mirror.  By moving the index arm, the index mirror can be made to reveal any object up to 90° from the direct line of sight.  When both objects are in the same view, aligning them together allows the navigator to measure the angular distance between them.

Very few of the original reflecting quadrant designs were ever produced.  One, constructed by Baradelle, is in the collection of the [[Musée de la Marine]], Paris.&lt;ref name="daumas"&gt;Daumas, Maurice,  ''Scientific Instruments of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries and Their Makers'', Portman Books, London 1989  {{ISBN|978-0-7134-0727-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hadley's octant====
[[File:Hadley's octant.png|thumb|Hadley's Octant. This is in the form familiar to those who have seen a sextant.]]
Hadley's second design had the form familiar to modern navigators.  The image to the right, also taken from his Royal Society publication,&lt;ref name="Hadley PTRS"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hadley |first=John |title=The Description of a new Instrument for taking Angles |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society |volume=37 |issue=420 |page=147&amp;ndash;157 and plates |date=August–September 1731 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CcVeAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=147#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows the details.

He placed an ''index mirror'' on the index arm.  Two ''horizon mirrors'' were provided.  The upper mirror, in the line of the sighting telescope, was small enough to allow the telescope to see directly ahead as well as seeing the reflected view.  The reflected view was that of the light from the index mirror.  As in the previous instrument, the arrangement of the mirrors allowed the observer to simultaneously see an object straight ahead and to see one reflected in the index mirror to the horizon mirror and then into the telescope.  Moving the index arm allowed the navigator to see any object within 90° of the direct view.

The significant difference with this design was that the mirrors allowed the instrument to be held vertically rather than horizontally and it provided more room for configuring the mirrors without suffering from mutual interference.

The second horizon mirror was an interesting innovation.  The telescope was removable.  It could be remounted so that the telescope viewed the second horizon mirror from the opposite side of the frame.  By mounting the two horizon mirrors at right angles to each other and permitting the movement of the telescope, the navigator could measure angles from 0 to 90° with one horizon mirror and from 90° to 180° with the other.  This made the instrument very versatile.  For unknown reasons, this feature was not implemented on octants in general use.

Comparing this instrument to the photo of a typical octant at the top of the article, one can see that the only significant differences in the more modern design are:
*The location of the horizon mirror and telescope or sighting pinnula is lower.
*The internal bracing of the frame is more central and robust.
*The position of the shades for the index mirror is in the path between the index and horizon mirrors rather than at the top of the instrument.
*Multiple shades are used to allow for different levels of shading.
*Separate shades are provided on the horizon mirror for sighting a low sun position with a very bright horizon.
*The second horizon mirror and accompanying [[alidade]] is not provided.

===Smith's Astroscope===
[[File:Astroscope (instrument).png|thumb|Drawing of Smith's Astroscope or Sea-quadrant]]
[[Caleb Smith (astronomer)|Caleb Smith]], an English insurance broker with a strong interest in astronomy, had created an octant in 1734.  He called it an ''Astroscope'' or ''Sea-Quadrant''.&lt;ref name="bedini"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bedini |first=Silvio |title=History Corner: Benjamin King of Newport, R.I.-Part II |journal=Professional Surveyor Magazine |date=September 1997 |volume=17 |issue=6 |url=http://www.profsurv.com/archive.php?issue=17&amp;article=184 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121000519/http://www.profsurv.com/archive.php?issue=17&amp;article=184 |archive-date=2006-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His used a fixed [[prism (optics)|prism]] in addition to an index mirror to provide reflective elements.  Prisms provide advantages over mirrors in an era when polished [[speculum metal]] mirrors were inferior and both the [[silvering]] of a mirror and the production of glass with flat, parallel surfaces was difficult.

In the drawing to the right, the horizon element (B) could be a mirror or a prism.  On the index arm, the index mirror (A) rotated with the arm.  A sighting [[telescope]] was mounted on the frame (C).  The index did not use a vernier or other device at the scale (D).  Smith called the instrument's index arm a ''label'', in the manner of Elton for his [[Elton's quadrant|mariner's quadrant]].&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;

Various design elements of Smith's instrument made it inferior to Hadley's octant and it was not used significantly.&lt;ref name="daumas" /&gt;  For example, one problem with the Astroscope was that angle of the observer's line of sight.  By looking down, he had greater difficulty in observing than an orientation with his head in a normal orientation.

==Advantages of the octant==
[[File:Octant-notepad.jpg|thumb|Octant reverse side. This side is not seen in photographs very often. On the right, the thumbscrew to adjust the horizon mirror can be seen. At the top, one of the feet on which the octant rests in its case is just below the index arm axis. On the left the notepad is clearly visible. This small keystone-shaped piece of ivory, scarcely larger than a thumbnail, was used by the navigator to record his readings.]]
The octant provided a number of advantages over previous instruments.

The sight was easy to align because the horizon and the star seem to move together as the ship pitched and rolled. This also created a situation where the error in observation was less dependent on the observer, as he could directly see both objects at once.

With the use of the manufacturing techniques available in the 18th century, the instruments were capable of reading very accurately.  The size of the instruments was reduced with no loss of accuracy.  An octant could be half the size of a [[Davis quadrant]] with no increase in error.

Using shades over the light paths, one could observe the sun directly, while moving the shades out of the light path allowed the navigator to observe faint stars.  This made the instrument usable both night and day.

By 1780, the octant and sextant had almost completely displaced all previous navigational instruments.&lt;ref name="daumas"/&gt;

==Production of the octant==
Early octants were constructed primarily in wood, with later versions incorporating ivory and brass components.  The earliest mirrors were polished metal, since the technology to produce [[Silvering|silvered]] glass mirrors with flat, parallel surfaces was limited.  As glass polishing techniques improved, glass mirrors began to be provided.  These used coatings of mercury-containing tin amalgam; coatings of silver or aluminum were not available until the 19th century.  The poor optical quality of the early polished [[speculum metal]] mirrors meant that telescopic sights were not practical.  For that reason, most early octants employed a simple naked-eye sighting [[pinnula]] instead.
[[File:Octant-scale-and-index.jpg|thumb|Details on an octant. This photo shows the graduated scale and the end of the index arm with the vernier. The thumbscrew used to lock the index arm position is seen below the index arm while the thumbscrew used for fine adjustment of the arm is on the left. To the right of the value ''50'' on the main scale, the SBR logo is engraved. The scale is directly graduated in degrees and thirds of a degree (20'). The vernier can divide the 20' intervals to the nearest minute of arc.]]

Early octants retained some of the features common to [[backstaff|backstaves]], such as [[transversal (instrument making)|transversals]] on the scale.  However, as engraved, they showed the instrument to have an apparent accuracy of only two [[minutes of arc]] while the backstaff appeared to be accurate to one minute.  The use of the vernier scale allowed the scale to be read to one minute, so improved the marketability of the instrument.  This and the ease in making verniers compared to transversals, lead to adoption of the vernier on octants produced later in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="bennett"&gt;Bennett, Jim,  "Catadioptrics and commerce in eighteenth-century London", in History of Science, vol xliv, 2006, pages 247-277.&lt;/ref&gt;

Octants were produced in large numbers.  In wood and ivory, their relatively low price compared to an all-brass sextant made them a popular instrument.  The design was standardized with many manufacturers using the identical frame style and components.  Different shops could make different components, with woodworkers specializing in frames and others in the brass components.  For example, Spencer, Browning and Rust, a manufacturer of scientific instruments in England from 1787 to 1840 (operating as ''Spencer, Browning and Co.'' after 1840) used a [[Jesse Ramsden|Ramsden]] [[dividing engine]] to produce [[Graduation (instrument)|graduated]] scales in ivory.  These were widely used by others and the ''SBR'' initials could be found on octants from many other manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;Harriet Wynter and Anthony Turner, ''Scientific Instruments'', Studio Vista, 1975,  {{ISBN|0-289-70403-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of these very similar octants are in the photos in this article.  The image at the top is essentially the same instrument as the one in the detail photos.  However, they are from two different instrument makers - the upper is labelled ''Crichton - London, Sold by J Berry Aberdeen'' while the detail images are of an instrument from ''Spencer, Browning &amp; Co. London''.  The only obvious difference is the presence of horizon shades on the Crichton octant that are not on the other.
[[File:Octant pinnula and horizon mirror.jpg|thumb|Octant details showing the double-holed sighting pinnula.  Also visible is the small cover that can block one or the other of the holes.  The horizon mirror is on the opposite side of the instrument.  The left side is transparent while the [[tin]] [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]] on the mirrored side has completely corroded and no longer reflects light.  The back of the index mirror's holder is at the top and the three circular glass shades in square frames are between the two mirrors.]]
These octants were available with many options.  A basic octant with graduations directly on the wood frame were least expensive.  These dispensed with a telescopic sight, using a single- or double-holed sighting pinnula instead.  Ivory scales would increase the price, as would the use of a brass index arm or a vernier.

==Demise of the octant==
In 1767 the first edition of [[the Nautical Almanac]] tabulated [[Method of Lunar Distances|lunar distances]], enabling navigators to find the current time from the angle between the sun and the moon. This angle is sometimes larger than 90°, and thus not possible to measure with an octant.  For that reason, [[John Campbell (governor)|Admiral John Campbell]], who conducted shipboard experiments with the lunar distance method, suggested a larger instrument and the [[sextant]] was developed.&lt;ref name="turner"&gt;Gerard L'E. Turner, ''Nineteenth Century Scientific Instruments'', Sotheby Publications, 1983, {{ISBN|0-85667-170-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From that time onward, the sextant was the instrument that experienced significant development and improvements and was the instrument of choice for naval navigators.  The octant continued to be produced well into the 19th century, though it was generally a less accurate and less expensive instrument.  The lower price of the octant, including versions without telescope, made it a practical instrument for ships in the merchant and fishing fleets.

One common practice among navigators up to the late nineteenth century was to use both a sextant and an octant.  The sextant was used with great care and only for [[lunar distance method|lunars]], while the octant was used for routine meridional altitude measurements of the sun every day.&lt;ref name="may"&gt;May, William Edward, ''A History of Marine Navigation'', G. T. Foulis &amp;amp; Co. Ltd., Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, 1973, {{ISBN|0-85429-143-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This protected the very accurate and pricier sextant, while using the more affordable octant where it performs well.

== {{Visible anchor|The bubble octant}} ==
From the early 1930s through the end of the 1950s, several types of civilian and military ''bubble octant'' instruments were produced for use aboard aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Brink, Randall, ''Lost Star: The Search for Amelia Earhart'', W. W. Norton &amp; Company, (1994), {{ISBN|0-393-02683-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-393-02683-2}}, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;  All were fitted with an artificial horizon in the form of a bubble, which was centered to align the horizon for a navigator flying thousands of feet above the earth; some had recording features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cardoza |first=Rod |date=n.d. |url=http://home.earthlink.net/~nbrass1/cardart.htm |title=Evolution of the Sextant |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726132417/http://home.earthlink.net/~nbrass1/cardart.htm |archive-date=2008-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use and adjustment==
Use and adjustment of the octant is essentially identical to the [[sextant#Navigational sextants|navigator's sextant]].

==Other reflecting instruments==
{{main|Reflecting instrument}}
Hadley's was not the first reflecting quadrant.  [[Robert Hooke]] invented a reflecting quadrant in 1684&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roberthooke.org.uk/chronolo.htm Chronology of Robert Hooke's life]&lt;/ref&gt; and had written about the concept as early as 1666.&lt;ref name="Cotter"&gt;Charles H. Cotter ''The Mariner's Sextant and the Royal Society; Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London'', Vol. 33, No. 1 (August 1978), pp. 23-36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hooke's was a single-reflecting instrument.&lt;ref name="Cotter" /&gt;  Other octants were developed by Jean-Paul Fouchy and Caleb Smith in the early 1730s, however, these did not become significant in the history of navigation instruments.

'''Power resource theory''' is a [[political theory]] which proposes the idea that the distribution of power between major [[Social class|classes]] is to some extent accountable for the successes and failure of various [[political ideologies]]. It argues that "at its core, it asserts that [[working class]] power achieved through organisation by [[labor unions]] or [[Left-wing politics|left parties]], produces more [[egalitarian]] distributional [[Outcome (game theory)|outcomes]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ces.fas.harvard.edu/conferences/cpeworkshop/can_inequality.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702122726/http://www.ces.fas.harvard.edu/conferences/cpeworkshop/can_inequality.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area contained by both circles is the [[joint entropy]] H(X,Y). The circle on the left (red and violet) is the [[Entropy (information theory)|individual entropy]] H(X), with the red being the [[conditional entropy]] H(X&amp;#x7C;Y). The circle on the right (blue and violet) is H(Y), with the blue being H(Y&amp;#x7C;X). The violet is the [[mutual information]] I(X;Y).]]
The [[Information theory|mathematical theory of information]] is based on [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], and measures information with several '''quantities of information'''.  The choice of logarithmic base in the following formulae determines the [[units of measurement|unit]] of [[information entropy]] that is used.  The most common unit of information is the [[bit]], based on the [[binary logarithm]].  Other units include the [[nat (unit)|nat]], based on the [[natural logarithm]], and the [[deciban|hartley]], based on the base 10 or [[common logarithm]].

In what follows, an expression of the form &lt;math&gt;p \log p \,&lt;/math&gt; is considered by convention to be equal to zero whenever ''p'' is zero.  This is justified because &lt;math&gt;\lim_{p \rightarrow 0+} p \log p = 0&lt;/math&gt; for any logarithmic base.

==Self-information==
Shannon derived a measure of information content called the '''[[self-information]]''' or '''"surprisal"''' of a message ''m'':

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{I}(m)  = \log \left( \frac{1}{p(m)} \right)  =  - \log( p(m) ) \, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p(m) = \mathrm{Pr}(M=m)&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that message ''m'' is chosen from all possible choices in the message space &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.  The base of the logarithm only affects a scaling factor and, consequently, the units in which the measured information content is expressed.  If the logarithm is base 2, the measure of information is expressed in units of [[bit]]s.

Information is transferred from a source to a recipient only if the recipient of the information did not already have the information to begin with.  Messages that convey information that is certain to happen and already known by the recipient contain no real information.  Infrequently occurring messages contain more information than more frequently occurring messages.  This fact is reflected in the above equation - a certain message, i.e. of probability 1, has an information measure of zero.  In addition, a compound message of two (or more) unrelated (or mutually independent) messages would have a quantity of information that is the sum of the measures of information of each message individually.  That fact is also reflected in the above equation, supporting the validity of its derivation.

An example: The weather forecast broadcast is: "Tonight's forecast: Dark. Continued darkness until widely scattered light in the morning."  This message contains almost no information.  However, a forecast of a snowstorm would certainly contain information since such does not happen every evening.  There would be an even greater amount of information in an accurate forecast of snow for a warm location, such as [[Miami]]. The amount of information in a forecast of snow for a location where it never snows (impossible event) is the highest (infinity).

==Entropy==
The '''[[information entropy|entropy]]''' of a discrete message space &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a measure of the amount of '''uncertainty''' one has about which message will be chosen. It is defined as the [[expected value|average]] self-information of a message &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; from that message space:

:&lt;math&gt; \Eta(M) = \mathbb{E} \left[\operatorname{I}(M)\right] 
= \sum_{m \in M} p(m) \operatorname{I}(m) = -\sum_{m \in M} p(m) \log p(m).&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbb{E} [ - ]  &lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[expected value]] operation.

An important property of entropy is that it is maximized when all the messages in the message space are equiprobable (e.g. &lt;math&gt; p(m) = 1/M &lt;/math&gt;). In this case &lt;math&gt;\Eta(M) = \log |M|.&lt;/math&gt;.

Sometimes the function ''H'' is expressed in terms of the probabilities of the distribution:

:&lt;math&gt;\Eta(p_1, p_2, \ldots , p_k) = -\sum_{i=1}^k p_i \log p_i,&lt;/math&gt; where each &lt;math&gt;p_i \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^k p_i = 1. &lt;/math&gt;

An important special case of this is the '''[[binary entropy function]]''':

:&lt;math&gt;\Eta_\mbox{b}(p) = \Eta(p, 1-p) = - p \log p - (1-p)\log (1-p).\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Joint entropy==
The '''[[joint entropy]]''' of two discrete random variables &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the entropy of the [[joint distribution]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\Eta(X, Y) = \mathbb{E}_{X,Y} \left[-\log p(x,y)\right] 
= - \sum_{x, y} p(x, y) \log p(x, y) \,&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; are [[statistical independence|independent]], then the joint entropy is simply the sum of their individual entropies.

(Note: The joint entropy should not be confused with the [[cross entropy]], despite similar notations.)

==Conditional entropy (equivocation)==
Given a particular value of a random variable &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, the conditional entropy of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;Y=y&lt;/math&gt; is defined as:

: &lt;math&gt; \Eta(X|y) = \mathbb{E}_{\left[X|Y \right]} [-\log p(x|y)] 
= -\sum_{x \in X} p(x|y) \log p(x|y)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p(x|y) = \frac{p(x,y)}{p(y)}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[conditional probability]] of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''[[conditional entropy]]''' of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, also called the '''equivocation''' of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; about &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is then given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \Eta(X|Y) = \mathbb{E}_Y \left[\Eta\left(X|y \right)\right] = -\sum_{y \in Y} p(y) \sum_{x \in X} p(x|y) \log p(x|y) = \sum_{x,y} p(x,y) \log \frac{p(y)}{p(x,y)}.&lt;/math&gt;

This uses the [[conditional expectation]] from probability theory.

A basic property of the conditional entropy is that:

: &lt;math&gt; \Eta(X|Y) = \Eta(X,Y) - \Eta(Y) .\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Kullback–Leibler divergence (information gain)==
The '''[[Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence|Kullback–Leibler divergence]]''' (or '''information divergence''', '''information gain''', or '''relative entropy''') is a way of comparing two distributions, a "true" [[probability distribution]] ''p'', and an arbitrary probability distribution ''q''.  If we compress data in a manner that assumes ''q'' is the distribution underlying some data, when, in reality, ''p'' is the correct distribution, Kullback–Leibler divergence is the number of average additional bits per datum necessry for compression, or, mathematically,
:&lt;math&gt;D_{\mathrm{KL}}\bigl(p(X) \| q(X) \bigr) = \sum_{x \in X} p(x) \log \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}.&lt;/math&gt;
It is in some sense the "distance" from ''q'' to ''p'', although it is not a true [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] due to its not being symmetric.

==Mutual information (transinformation)==
It turns out that one of the most useful and important measures of information is the '''[[mutual information]]''', or '''transinformation'''. This is a measure of how much information can be obtained about one random variable by observing another. The mutual information of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; relative to &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; (which represents conceptually the average amount of information about &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; that can be gained by observing &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;) is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{I}(X;Y) = \sum_{y\in Y} p(y)\sum_{x\in X} {p(x|y) \log \frac{p(x|y)}{p(x)}} = \sum_{x,y} p(x,y) \log \frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)\, p(y)}.&lt;/math&gt;

A basic property of the mutual information is that:

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{I}(X;Y) = \Eta(X) - \Eta(X|Y).\,&lt;/math&gt;

That is, knowing ''Y'', we can save an average of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{I}(X; Y)&lt;/math&gt; bits in encoding ''X'' compared to not knowing ''Y''.  Mutual information is [[symmetric function|symmetric]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{I}(X;Y) = \operatorname{I}(Y;X)
= \Eta(X) + \Eta(Y) - \Eta(X,Y).\,&lt;/math&gt;


Mutual information can be expressed as the average [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]] (information gain) of the [[posterior probability|posterior probability distribution]] of ''X'' given the value of ''Y'' to the [[prior probability|prior distribution]] on ''X'':
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{I}(X;Y) = \mathbb{E}_{p(y)} \left[D_{\mathrm{KL}}\bigl( p(X|Y=y) \| p(X) \bigr)\right].&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, this is a measure of how much, on the average, the probability distribution on ''X'' will change if we are given the value of ''Y''.  This is often recalculated as the divergence from the product of the marginal distributions to the actual joint distribution:
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{I}(X; Y) = D_{\mathrm{KL}}\bigl(p(X,Y) \| p(X)p(Y) \bigr).&lt;/math&gt;

Mutual information is closely related to the [[likelihood-ratio test|log-likelihood ratio test]] in the context of contingency tables and the [[multinomial distribution]] and to [[Pearson's chi-squared test|Pearson's χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; test]]: mutual information can be considered a statistic for assessing independence between a pair of variables, and has a well-specified asymptotic distribution.

==Differential entropy==
:''See main article: [[Differential entropy]]''.

The basic measures of discrete entropy have been extended by analogy to [[Probability distribution#Continuous probability distribution|continuous]] spaces by replacing sums with integrals and [[probability mass function]]s with [[probability density function]]s. Although, in both cases, mutual information expresses the number of bits of information common to the two sources in question, the analogy does ''not'' imply identical properties; for example, differential entropy may be negative.  

The differential analogies of entropy, joint entropy, conditional entropy, and mutual information are defined as follows:

: &lt;math&gt; h(X) = -\int_X f(x) \log f(x) \,dx &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; h(X,Y) = -\int_Y \int_X f(x,y) \log f(x,y) \,dx \,dy&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; h(X|y) = -\int_X f(x|y) \log f(x|y) \,dx &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; h(X|Y) = \int_Y \int_X f(x,y) \log \frac{f(y)}{f(x,y)} \,dx \,dy&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{I}(X;Y) = \int_Y \int_X f(x,y) \log \frac{f(x,y)}{f(x)f(y)} \,dx \,dy &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; is the joint density function, &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(y)&lt;/math&gt; are the marginal distributions, and &lt;math&gt;f(x|y)&lt;/math&gt; is the conditional distribution.

A '''spa town''' is a [[resort town]] based on a [[mineral spa]] (a developed [[mineral spring]]). Patrons visit spas to "take the waters" for their purported health benefits. The word ''spa'' is derived from the name of [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]], a town in [[Belgium]]. &lt;!-- In [[continental Europe]] a spa was known as a ''ville d'eau'' (town of water). {{cd}} --&gt;

[[Thomas Guidott]] set up a medical practice in the English town of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in 1668. He became interested in the curative properties of the hot mineral waters there and in 1676 wrote ''A discourse of Bathe, and the hot waters there. Also, Some Enquiries into the Nature of the water''. This brought the purported health-giving properties of the waters to the attention of the aristocracy, who started to partake in them soon after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burns |first=D. Thorburn |title=Thomas Guidott (1638–1705): Physician and Chymist, contributor to the analysis of mineral waters |journal=Analytical Proceedings including Analytical Communications: Royal Society of Chemistry |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=2–6 |doi=10.1039/AP9811800002 |url=http://www.rsc.org/publishing/journals/article.asp?doi=AP9811800002 |accessdate=10 December 2007 |quote= |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''spa'' is used for towns or resorts offering [[hydrotherapy]], which can include cold water or [[mineral water]] treatments and geothermal baths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://csicop.org/sb/2005-09/i-files.html |title=Healing Waters; Investigative Files (Skeptical Briefs June 2005) |access-date=3 February 2008 |work= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071024180616/http://www.csicop.org/sb/2005-09/i-files.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 24 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epigraph==

The epigraph for chapter three is from ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667) by [[John Milton]], Book II, 681-683:

"Whence and what art thou, execrable shape,&lt;br /&gt;
That dar'st, though grim and terrible, advance&lt;br /&gt;
Thy miscreated Front athwart my way."

==Plot==

The novel opens amidst a raging thunderstorm. Wolfstein is a wanderer in the [[Swiss Alps]] who seeks cover from the storm. He is a disillusioned outcast from society who seeks to kill himself. A group of monks carrying a body for burial in a torch-light procession runs into him and saves his life. Bandits attack them and take Wolfstein to an underground hideout. He meets Megalena, whom the bandits have abducted after killing her father in an ambush. After Steindolph, one of the bandits, recites a ballad about the reanimation of the corpse of a nun named Rosa, Wolfstein manages to poison the leader of the bandits, Cavigni, in a second attempt. He is able to escape with Megalena. Ginotti, a member of the bandits, befriends Wolfstein.

Wolfstein and Megalena flee to [[Genoa]] where they live together. Olympia, a woman of the town, seduces Wolfstein. Megalena, enraged by the relationship, demands that Wolfstein kill Olympia. Armed with a dagger, Wolfstein is unable to kill her. Olympia kills herself.

Ginotti follows Wolfstein. Ginotti is a member of the Rosicrucian, or Rose Cross, Order. He is an alchemist who seeks the secret of immortality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=52rRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=wolfstein+percy+shelley&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ks9Yibs3DT&amp;sig=k75B0HYJN9R9L5_JHw9-CoOMLkU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ySwXVKK8G5KcyASbxoHwCA&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=wolfstein%20percy%20shelley&amp;f=false ''The Gothic Wanderer: From Transgression to Redemption'', "Rosicrucian Elements in ''Frankenstein''," p. 131.]&lt;/ref&gt; He tells Wolfstein that he will give him the secret to immortality if he will renounce his faith and join the sect.

Eloise de St. Irvyne is the sister of Wolfstein who lives in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. Ginotti, under his new identity of Frederic Nempere, travels to Geneva and seeks to seduce her.

Ginotti reveals his experiments in his lifelong quest to find the secret of eternal life: "From my earliest youth, before it was quenched by complete
satiation, ''curiosity'', and a desire of unveiling the latent mysteries of nature, was the passion by which all the other emotions of my mind were intellectually organized. ... Natural philosophy at last became the peculiar science to which I directed my eager enquiries." He has studied science and the laws of nature to ascertain the mysteries of life and of being: "I thought of ''death''---... I cannot die.---'Will not this nature---will not the ''matter'' of which it is composed---exist to all eternity? Ah! I know it will; and, by the exertions of the energies with which nature has gifted me, well I know it shall.'" Ginotti tells Wolfstein that he will reveal the "secret of immortal life" to him if he will take certain prescribed ingredients and "mix them according to the directions which this book will communicate to you" and meet him in the abbey at St. Irvyne.

In the final scene, which takes place at the abbey of St. Irvyne in France, Wolfstein finds the corpse of Megalena in the vaults. An emaciated Ginotti confronts Wolfstein. Wolfstein is asked if he will deny his Creator. Wolfstein refuses to renounce his faith. Lightning strikes the vaults as thunder and a sulphurous windstorm blast the abbey. Both men are struck dead. This is the penalty they pay for "the delusion of the passions", for tampering with forces that they neither can control nor understand in seeking "endless life".

==Reception==
The novel, originally intended as a much longer "triple decker" novel, circulated as part of the "circulating libraries" which were popular at that time.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Behrendt, Stephen C. Edited by, with Introduction, and notes. Zastrozzi and St. Irvyne. Peterborough, ON, Canada: Broadview Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a source of revenue for the publisher of the novel. Shelley ended the novella abruptly, deciding not to develop or integrate the two strands. The result was a much shorter work.

Critics attacked the novel, which received generally negative reviews. The conservative British periodical ''The [[Anti-Jacobin Review]] and Magazine'', in a January 1812 review, castigated "the writer, who can outrage nature and common sense in almost every page of his book". The reviewer sought to deter readers from "the perusal of unprofitable and vicious productions."

French author Maurice Sarfati adapted the novel as ''Wolfstein et Mégaléna, ou La Vengeance du Rosiccrucien'', or ''Wolfstein and Megalena, the Vengeance of the Rosicrucian'', in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb40898072h BnF Catalogue General.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Wolfstein'' Chapbooks==

[[File:Wolfstein title page 1822.jpg|thumb|''Wolfstein; or, The Mysterious Bandit'', chapbook, title page, London, John Bailey, 1822.]]The novel was popular enough, however, to be made into two [[chapbook|chapbooks]] in 1822 and 1850. The first chapbook version was entitled ''[[Wolfstein (Percy Bysshe Shelley chapbook)|Wolfstein; or, The Mysterious Bandit]]'' and was published and printed by John Bailey at 116, Chancery Lane in London in 1822 after the original novel was republished that year.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Wolfstein.html?id=JRoBHQAACAAJ ''Wolfstein; Or, The Mysterious Bandit.''

London: Grafton, 1939, p. 266. Block gives a publication date of 1820.&lt;/ref&gt; The chapbook version was a condensed version of the novella in 28 pages meant for popular consumption, serving the same function as a paperback would. The chapbook sold for sixpence.

The story is described on the title page as "A Terrific Romance" with an epigraph by [[Ossian]]: "A tale of horror, of murder, and of deeds done in darkness." Added to ''Wolfstein'' was the story ''The Bronze Statue, A Pathetic Tale'' by another author, [[Anna Jane Vardill]].&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt; "The Bronze Statue" had appeared for the first time in print as part of the "Annals of Public Justice" in ''The European Magazine'' of May, 1820, signed "V", i.e., Anna Jane Vardill.

Another more condensed twelve page chapbook was published in 1850 by Thomas Redriffe in London entitled ''[[Wolfstein, The Murderer; or, The Secrets of a Robber's Cave]]'': A Terrific Romance. To which is Added, The Two Serpents, an Oriental Apologue. The Ossian epigraph appeared on the title page: "A tale of horror, of murder, and of deeds done in darkness." Printed for Thomas Redriffe, Piccadilly. The price was "Two-Pence".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Wolfstein_the_Murderer_Or_The_Secrets_of.html?id=OZhmngEACAAJ ''Wolfstein, the Murderer; Or, The Secrets of a Robber's Cave: A Terrific Romance.

{{Cosmology}}

In [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], the '''steady state model'''  is an alternative to the [[Big Bang]] theory of the evolution of the universe. In the steady state model, the density of matter in the [[expanding universe]] remains unchanged due to a continuous creation of matter,  thus adhering to the [[perfect cosmological principle]], a principle that asserts that the [[observable universe]] is basically the same at any time as well as at any place.

While the steady state model enjoyed some popularity in the mid-20th century (though less popularity than the Big Bang theory), it is now rejected by the vast majority of [[cosmologists]], [[astrophysicists]] and [[astronomers]], as the observational evidence points to a hot Big Bang cosmology with a finite [[age of the universe]], which the steady state model does not predict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/space/universe/questions_and_ideas/steady_state_theory |title=Steady State theory |work=BBC |quote=[T]he Steady State theorists' ideas are largely discredited today... |accessdate=January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="name"&gt;{{cite book |title=Cosmology and Controversy: The Historical Development of Two Theories of the Universe |first=Helge |last=Kragh |location= |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |year=1999 |isbn=0-691-02623-8 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=eq7TfxZOzSEC |page= }} |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In the 13th century, [[Siger of Brabant]] authored the thesis ''The Eternity of the World'', which argued that there was no first man, and no first specimen of any particular: the physical universe is thus without any first beginning, and therefore eternal. Siger's views were [[Condemnations of 1210–1277|condemned by the Pope in 1277]].

Cosmological expansion was originally discovered through observations by [[Edwin Hubble]]. Theoretical calculations also showed that the [[static universe]] as modeled by Einstein (1917) was unstable and contradicted [[general relativity]]. The modern Big Bang theory is one in which the universe has a finite age and has evolved over time through cooling, expansion, and the formation of structures through gravitational collapse.

The steady state model asserts that although the universe is expanding, it nevertheless does not change its appearance over time (the [[perfect cosmological principle]]); the universe has no beginning and no end. This requires that matter be continually created in order to keep the universe's density from decreasing. Influential papers on steady state cosmologies were published by [[Hermann Bondi]], [[Thomas Gold]], and [[Fred Hoyle]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Bondi and Gold, "The Steady-State Theory of the Expanding Universe," MNRAS 108 (1948) 252. {{Bibcode|1948MNRAS.108..252B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoyle, "A New Model for the Expanding Universe," MNRAS 108 (1948) 372. {{Bibcode|1948MNRAS.108..372H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is now known that [[Albert Einstein]] considered a steady state model of the expanding universe, as indicated in a 1931 manuscript, many years before Hoyle, Bondi and Gold. However, he quickly abandoned the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/einstein-s-lost-theory-uncovered-1.14767|title=Einstein’s lost theory uncovered|work=Nature News &amp; Comment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observational tests==
===Counts of radio sources===
Problems with the steady state model began to emerge in the 1950s and 60s, when observations began to support the idea that the universe was in fact changing: bright radio sources ([[quasar]]s and [[radio galaxy|radio galaxies]]) were found only at large distances (therefore could have existed only in the distant past), not in closer galaxies.  Whereas the Big Bang theory predicted as much, the steady state model predicted that such objects would be found throughout the universe, including close to our own galaxy. By 1961, statistical tests based on radio-source surveys&lt;ref&gt;Ryle and Clarke, "An examination of the steady-state model in the light of some recent observations of radio sources," MNRAW 122 (1961) 349&lt;/ref&gt; had ruled out the steady state model in the minds of most cosmologists, although some proponents of the steady state insisted that the radio data were suspect.

===Cosmic microwave background===
For most cosmologists, the definitive refutation of the steady state model came with the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background]] radiation in 1964, which was predicted by the Big Bang theory. The steady state model explained microwave background radiation as the result of light from ancient stars that has been scattered by galactic dust.  However, the cosmic microwave background level is very even in all directions, making it difficult to explain how it could be generated by numerous point sources and the microwave background radiation shows no evidence of characteristics such as polarization that are normally associated with scattering. Furthermore, its spectrum is so close to that of an ideal [[black body]] that it could hardly be formed by the superposition of contributions from a multitude of dust clumps at different temperatures as well as at different [[redshift]]s. [[Steven Weinberg]] wrote in 1972,
:''The steady state model does not appear to agree with the observed ''[[luminosity distance|''d''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;]]'' versus [[redshift|z]] relation or with [[source counts]] ... In a sense, this disagreement is a credit to the model; alone among all cosmologies, the steady state model makes such definite predictions that [[falsifiability|it can be disproved]] even with the limited observational evidence at our disposal. The steady state model is so attractive that many of its adherents still retain hope that the evidence against it will eventually disappear as observations improve. However, if the cosmic microwave radiation . . . is really black-body radiation, it will be difficult to doubt that the universe has evolved from a hotter denser early stage.''&lt;ref&gt;

Since this discovery, the Big Bang theory has been considered to provide the best explanation of the origin of the universe. In most astrophysical publications, the Big Bang is implicitly accepted and is used as the basis of more complete theories.

==Quasi-steady state==
Quasi-steady state cosmology (QSS) was proposed in 1993 by [[Fred Hoyle]], [[Geoffrey Burbidge]], and [[Jayant Narlikar|Jayant V. Narlikar]] as a new incarnation of the steady state ideas meant to explain additional features unaccounted for in the initial proposal. The model suggests pockets of creation occurring over time within the universe, sometimes referred to as ''minibangs,'' ''mini-creation events,'' or ''little bangs''.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16605">A '''tachyonic field''', or simply '''tachyon''', is a [[quantum field|field]] with an [[imaginary number|imaginary]] mass.&lt;ref name=Randall/&gt; Although [[tachyon|tachyonic particles]] ([[particle]]s that move [[faster-than-light|faster than light]]) are a purely hypothetical concept that violate a number of essential physical principles, at least one field with imaginary mass is believed to [[Higgs_boson#Properties_of_the_Higgs_field|exist]].  In general, tachyonic fields play an important role in physics&lt;ref name=Sen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gibbons/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kutasov/&gt; and are discussed in popular books.&lt;ref name=Randall/&gt;&lt;ref name=Greene/&gt; Under no circumstances do any excitations of tachyonic fields ever propagate faster than light—the presence or absence of a tachyonic (imaginary) mass has no effect on the maximum velocity of signals, and so unlike faster-than-light particles there is no violation of [[causality (physics)|causality]].&lt;ref name="susskind"/&gt;

The term "[[tachyon]]" was coined by [[Gerald Feinberg]] in a 1967 paper&lt;ref name="Feinberg67"/&gt; that studied [[Quantum field theory|quantum fields]] with [[imaginary number|imaginary]] mass.  Feinberg believed such fields permitted faster than light propagation, but it was soon realized that Feinberg's model in fact did not allow for [[superluminal]] speeds.&lt;ref name="susskind"/&gt; Instead, the imaginary mass creates an instability in the configuration: any configuration in which one or more field excitations are tachyonic will spontaneously decay, and the resulting configuration contains no physical tachyons.  This process is known as [[tachyon condensation]].  A famous example is the [[Higgs mechanism|condensation]] of the [[Higgs boson]] in the [[Standard Model of particle physics]].

In modern physics, all [[fundamental particle]]s are regarded as localized excitations of fields. Tachyons are unusual because the instability prevents any such localized excitations from existing. Any localized perturbation, no matter how small, starts an [[exponential growth|exponentially growing]] cascade that strongly affects physics everywhere inside the future [[light cone]] of the perturbation.&lt;ref name="susskind"/&gt;

==Interpretation==

=== Overview of tachyonic condensation===
{{main|Tachyon condensation}}
Although the notion of a tachyonic [[imaginary number|imaginary]] mass might seem troubling because there is no classical interpretation of an imaginary mass, the mass is not quantized.  Rather, the [[scalar field]] is; even for tachyonic [[quantum field theory|quantum fields]], the field operators at [[Minkowski space|spacelike]] separated points still [[Canonical commutation relation|commute (or anticommute)]], thus preserving causality. Therefore, information still does not propagate faster than light,&lt;ref name="feinberg67"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Gerald | last = Feinberg | authorlink = Gerald Feinberg | title = Possibility of Faster-Than-Light Particles | journal = Physical Review | volume = 159 | year = 1967 | pages = 1089–1105 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.159.1089|bibcode = 1967PhRv..159.1089F | issue = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and solutions grow exponentially, but not superluminally (there is no violation of [[causality]]).

The "imaginary mass" really means that the system becomes unstable. The zero value field is at a [[local maximum]] rather than a local minimum of its potential energy, much like a ball at the top of a hill. A very small impulse (which will always happen due to quantum fluctuations) will lead the field to roll down with [[exponential growth|exponentially increasing]] amplitudes toward the local minimum. In this way, [[tachyon condensation]] drives a physical system that has reached a local limit and might naively be expected to produce physical tachyons, to an alternative stable state where no physical tachyons exist. Once the tachyonic field reaches the minimum of the potential, its quanta are not tachyons any more but rather are ordinary particles with a positive mass-squared, such as the [[Higgs boson]].&lt;ref name = "Peskin" /&gt;

=== Physical interpretation of a tachyonic field and signal propagation===
There is a simple mechanical analogy that illustrates that tachyonic fields do not propagate faster than light, why they represent instabilities, and helps explain the meaning of imaginary mass (the mass squared being negative).&lt;ref name="susskind"/&gt;

Consider a long line of pendulums, all pointing straight down. The mass on the end of each pendulum is connected to the masses of its two neighbors by springs. Wiggling one of the pendulums will create two ripples that propagate in both directions down the line. As the ripple passes, each pendulum in its turn oscillates a few times about the straight down position. The speed of propagation of these ripples is determined in a simple way by the tension of the springs and the inertial mass of the pendulum weights. Formally, these parameters can be chosen so that the propagation speed is the speed of light. In the limit of an infinite density of closely spaced pendulums, this model becomes identical to a relativistic field theory, where the ripples are the analog of particles.  Displacing the pendulums from pointing straight down requires positive energy, which indicates that the squared mass of those particles is positive.

Now consider an initial condition where at time t=0, all the pendulums are pointing straight up. Clearly this is unstable, but at least in classical physics one can imagine that they are so carefully balanced they will remain pointing straight up indefinitely so long as they are not perturbed. Wiggling one of the upside-down pendulums will have a very different effect from before. The speed of propagation of the effects of the wiggle is identical to what it was before, since neither the spring tension nor the inertial mass have changed. However, the effects on the pendulums affected by the perturbation are dramatically different. Those pendulums that feel the effects of the perturbation will begin to topple over, and will pick up speed exponentially. Indeed, it is easy to show that any localized perturbation kicks off an exponentially growing instability that affects everything within its future "ripple cone" (a region of size equal to time multiplied by the ripple propagation speed). In the limit of infinite pendulum density, this model is a tachyonic field theory.

== Importance in physics ==
Tachyonic fields play an important role in modern physics. Perhaps the most famous example of a tachyon is the [[Higgs boson]] of the [[Standard model of particle physics]]. In its [[Tachyon condensation|uncondensed]] phase, the square of the mass of the [[Higgs field]] is negative, and therefore, the associated particle is a tachyon.

The phenomenon of [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]], which is closely related to [[tachyon condensation]], plays a central part in many aspects of theoretical physics, including the [[Ginzburg–Landau theory|Ginzburg–Landau]] and [[BCS theory|BCS]] theories of superconductivity.

Other examples include the [[inflaton]] field in certain models of [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmic inflation]] (such as new inflation&lt;ref name="linde"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0370-2693(82)91219-9 | title = A new inflationary universe scenario: A possible solution of the horizon, flatness, homogeneity, isotropy and primordial monopole problems | date = 1982 | last1 = Linde | first1 = A | journal = Physics Letters B | volume = 108 | issue = 6 | pages = 389–393 | bibcode=1982PhLB..108..389L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="albrecht"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.48.1220 | title = Cosmology for Grand Unified Theories with Radiatively Induced Symmetry Breaking | date = 1982 | last1 = Albrecht | first1 = Andreas | last2 = Steinhardt | first2 = Paul | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 48 | issue = 17 | pages = 1220–1223 | bibcode = 1982PhRvL..48.1220A | url = http://astrophysics.fic.uni.lodz.pl/100yrs/pdf/07/060.pdf | format = PDF | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120130063002/http://astrophysics.fic.uni.lodz.pl/100yrs/pdf/07/060.pdf | archivedate = 2012-01-30 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;), and the tachyon of [[bosonic string theory]].&lt;ref name=Greene/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.

== Condensation ==
{{Main|Tachyon condensation}}
In [[quantum field theory]], a tachyon is a quantum of a field—usually a [[Scalar field theory|scalar field]]—whose squared mass is negative, and is used to describe [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]]: The existence of such a field implies the instability of the field vacuum; the field is at a local maximum rather than a local minimum of its potential energy, much like a ball at the top of a hill. A very small impulse (which will always happen due to quantum fluctuations) will lead the field (ball) to roll down with [[exponential growth|exponentially increasing]] amplitudes: it will induce [[tachyon condensation]].  Once the tachyonic field reaches the minimum of the potential, its quanta are not tachyons any more but rather have a positive mass-squared.  The [[Higgs boson]] of the [[standard model of particle physics]] is an example.&lt;ref name="Peskin"/&gt;

Technically, the squared mass is the second derivative of the [[effective potential]]. For a tachyonic field the second derivative is negative, meaning that the [[effective potential]] is at a local maximum rather than a local minimum. Therefore, this situation is unstable and the field will roll down the potential.

Because a tachyon's squared mass is negative, it formally has an [[Imaginary number|imaginary]] mass. This is a special case of the general rule, where unstable massive particles are formally described as having a [[complex number|complex]] mass, with the real part being their mass in usual sense, and the imaginary part being the [[Particle decay#Decay rate|decay rate]] in [[natural units]].&lt;ref name="Peskin"&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in [[quantum field theory]], a particle (a "one-particle state") is roughly defined as a state which is constant over time; i.e., an [[eigenvalue]] of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]. An [[Particle decay|unstable particle]] is a state which is only approximately constant over time; If it exists long enough to be measured, it can be formally described as having a complex mass, with the real part of the mass greater than its imaginary part. If both parts are of the same magnitude, this is interpreted as a [[resonance]] appearing in a scattering process rather than particle, as it is considered not to exist long enough to be measured independently of the scattering process. In the case of a tachyon the real part of the mass is zero, and hence no concept of a particle can be attributed to it.

Even for tachyonic quantum fields, the field operators at space-like separated points still commute (or anticommute), thus preserving the principle of causality. For closely related reasons, the maximum velocity of signals sent with a tachyonic field is strictly bounded from above by the speed of light.&lt;ref name=susskind/&gt; Therefore, information never moves faster than light regardless of the presence or absence of tachyonic fields.

Examples for tachyonic fields are all cases of [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]]. In [[condensed matter physics]] a notable example is [[ferromagnetism]]; in [[particle physics]] the best known example is the [[Higgs mechanism]] in the [[standard model]].

== Tachyons in string theory ==
In [[string theory]], tachyons have the same interpretation as in [[quantum field theory]]. However, string theory can, at least, in principle, not only describe the physics of tachyonic fields, but also predict whether such fields appear.

Tachyonic fields indeed arise in many versions of [[string theory]]. In general, string theory states that what we see as "particles" (electrons, photons, gravitons and so forth) are actually different vibrational states of the same underlying string. The mass of the particle can be deduced from the vibrations which the string exhibits; roughly speaking, the mass depends upon the "note" which the string sounds. Tachyons frequently appear in the spectrum of permissible string states, in the sense that some states have negative mass-squared, and therefore, imaginary mass. If the tachyon appears as a vibrational mode of an [[String (physics)|open string]], this signals an instability of the underlying [[D-brane]] system to which the string is attached.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system will then decay to a state of [[closed string]]s and/or stable D-branes. If the tachyon is a closed string vibrational mode, this indicates an instability in spacetime itself. Generally, it is not known (or theorized) what this system will decay to. However, if the closed string tachyon is localized around a spacetime singularity, the endpoint of the decay process will often have the singularity resolved.

'''''The Myth of Mars and Venus: Do Men and Women Really Speak Different Languages?''''' is a 2008 book by [[Deborah Cameron (linguist)|Deborah Cameron]], published by [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cameron | first = Deborah | author-link = Deborah Cameron (linguist) | title = The myth of Mars and Venus: do men and women really speak different languages? | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | year = 2008 | isbn = 9780199550999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title refers to the central conceit of [[John Gray (U.S. author)|John Gray]]'s 1992 book ''[[Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus]]'', which Cameron's book is partially a response to.

==Details==
Cameron argues that "what linguistic differences there are between men and women are driven by the need to construct and project personal meaning and identity." She challenges "the idea that sex-differences might have biological rather than social causes" as being more motivated by a reaction to politically correct attitudes than being derived from basic research.

The book argues that there is as much similarity and variation within each gender as between men and women. Cameron concludes that we have an urgent need to think about gender in more complex ways than the prevailing myths and stereotypes allow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/01/gender.books|title=What language barrier?|last=Cameron|first=Deborah|date=2007-10-01|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-07-03|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''theory of mediation''', which is the principal referent of the research group of the [http://www.sites.univ-rennes2.fr/las/lirl/pages/niveau1/lirlenglish.html Interdisciplinary Laboratory for Language Research] (L.I.R.L.), is a theoretic model developed at [[Rennes]] (France) since the 1960' by Professor [[Gagnepain Jean|Jean Gagnepain]], linguist and [[Epistemology|epistemologist]]. This model, whose principles Jean Gagnepain has methodically set forth in his three volume study ''On Meaning'' (''Du Vouloir Dire''),&lt;ref&gt;Jean Gagnepain Jean, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eidcPOFI8uwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Du Vouloir Dire I], Bruxelles, De Boeck, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean Gagnepain Jean, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_1xqJSorZXAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Du Vouloir Dire II], Bruxelles, De Boeck, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; covers the whole field of the [[human science]]s. One essential feature of the theory is that it seeks to find a kind of experimental verification of its theorems in the clinic of [[psychopathology]]. For this reason, the theory presents itself as a "clinical anthropology".

The theoretic model developed by Gagnepain and his research group at Rennes has inspired the work of professors and researchers in a number of [[European countries]] and in the [[United States]] in a wide variety of disciplinary fields, among them [[linguistics]], [[literature]], [[psychology]], [[art history]], [[archeology]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[theology]]. Its aim is deliberately trans-disciplinary - or, as Gagnepain humorously puts it, the theory of mediation cultivates "in-discipline".

== A theory of culture ==

This model, originally developed with respect to language, today takes for its object the entirety of what is called "the cultural", that is, the dimension that specifies human beings and distinguishes them from other living species. In other words, "the cultural" constitutes the specific order of reality in which only human beings participate. It is the cultural order that permits human beings, while remaining natural beings, to constantly transcend their natural being in abstracting themselves from it.

The theory of mediation understands the cultural order - more simply, culture - not as the totality of the essential works of a society, nor as the general state of a given civilization, but as the ensemble of properly human capacities which, absent pathological conditions, all human beings share regardless of their historical epoch or geographical setting. For the theory of mediation, culture and reason - the "rationality" which philosophers have discussed for centuries - are identical. The human sciences, understood as the theory of mediation understands them, take up in their own distinctive fashion the questions which philosophy has treated only speculatively.

== A clinical anthropology ==

Gagnepain's work shows, on the basis of what the clinic forces us to recognize, that human reason is diffracted. In other words, rationality in human beings has several different forms which the clinic requires us to dissociate. Reason is logical, to be sure, but it is equally and just as fundamentally technical, ethnical, and ethical. There is no hierarchy among these different "planes" or "levels" of rationality that constitute psychic life.

On each of these planes or levels, human being mediate their relations to the world and others (thus the term "mediation"). Unlike the other animals, human beings are not limited to what their immediate physiological capacities allow them to grasp. They can stand back from, or take a distance from, their natural insertion in the world and can elaborate those cultural mediations that are constitutive of a properly human reality.

In Kantian terms, it is a question of passing from a description of an already constituted reason to an explanation of a constituting reason. It is a question, therefore, of accounting for that in human beings which, without their knowing it, makes them capable of posing the world - and of posing it not only in one way, by knowing it, as the traditional analysis holds, but in four different ways on the basis of four different capacities.

To be sure, human beings manifest the world in and across the words they speak : with them, they designate the world and explain it to themselves. In so doing, they realize their logical capacity. Human beings also manifest the world in and across their tools : with them, they fabricate the world and, in doing so, they realize their technical capacity. Human beings likewise manifest the world in originating their histories and societies, realizations not of their logical or their technical capacities but of their ethnic capacity. Finally, human beings manifest the world in the norms and regulations to which they submit their desires. Here is it question of their ethical capacity.

The possible autonomisation of the four planes (or levels or modes) of our rationality is revealed by the clinic. Although "normally" the four modes of our rationality function together in such a way that it is hardly possible to distinguish them, pathologically it does become possible to distinguish them, as, for example, when one mode of rationality ceases to function in an afflicted person whereas the others continue to do so. Each plane of rationality has its specific pathology. The pathology specific to the logical plane is [[aphasia]]; the pathology specific to the technical plane is atechnia ; the pathology specific to the ethnical plane is [[psychosis]] (and [[Paraphilia|perversion]]) ; the pathology specific to the ethical plane is [[neurosis]] (and psychopathic conditions).

In other words, pathology dissociates what normally cannot be distinguished and puts into evidence processes otherwise unseen. In this way, as [[Freud]] recognized, pathology provides a veritable analysis, that is, a breakdown, of the human psyche.&lt;ref&gt;"On the other hand, we are familiar with the notion that pathology, by making things larger and coarser, can draw our attention to normal conditions which would otherwise have escaped us. Where it points to a breach or a rent, there may normally be an articulation present. If we throw a crystal to the floor, it breaks; but not into haphazard pieces. It comes apart along its lines of cleavage into fragments whose boundaries, though they were invisible, were predetermined by the crystal’s structure. Mental patients are split and broken structures of this same kind. [...] They have turned away from external reality, but for that very reason they know more about internal, psychical reality and can reveal a number of things to us that would otherwise be inaccessible to us." (S. Freund, ''New Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis'', lecture XXXI, 1933)&lt;/ref&gt; Gagnepain therefore makes it a methodological rule "to admit or to impute to a system only those dissociations that are pathologically verifiable."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1705">'''Thomas Godfrey''' (December 1704 – December 1749) was an optician and inventor in the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]], who around 1730 invented the [[octant (instrument)|octant]]. At approximately the same time an Englishman, [[John Hadley]], also invented the octant independently.

Godfrey was born on his family's farm in Bristol Township, near [[Germantown, Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].

[[Benjamin Franklin]] describes Godfrey at length in his ''[[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|Autobiography]]'', referring to him as a "Great Mathematician" who nevertheless was "not a pleasing Companion", demanding in conversations a "universal Precision in every thing said."&lt;ref name="franklin"&gt;{{cite book

Godfrey's son, also [[Thomas Godfrey (poet)|Thomas Godfrey]], died at only 26, but had already published several popular works, including [[The Prince of Parthia]], a play that remains well known to this day.

The Vale do Sinos Regional Development Association, VALETEC, was established in 1998 as a non-profit private civil partnership. Its goal is to promote [[Technology|technological development]] in the Vale do Sinos region by stimulating [[regional integration]], providing incentives for entrepreneurship, while creating, attracting, hosting, and developing companies. In order to achieve this goal, VALETEC develops and manages environments for technological innovation, such as incubators, entrepreneurial condominiums, technology parks and complexes, as well as other initiatives aligned with this focus. VALETEC's main commitment is to contribute for the improvement of the Vale do Sinos [[quality of life]], while forging links between educational and research institutions and the society, governments, and companies. This contributes to generate jobs and wealth, boosting the [[sustainable development]] of the Vale do Sinos technopolitan project.

One of VALETEC's main initiatives was the creation of the '''Vale do Sinos Technology Park, VALETEC Park'''. The park currently works as a regional, multicampi and multisector enterprise, with its main axis following the path of highways RS-239 and BR-116, the Innovation Route. The first segment of the VALETEC Park was launched in the city of [[Campo Bom]], in December, 2004. The second segment will consist of an [[urban park]], to be established within the Hamburgo Velho's Historical Center, in the city of [[Novo Hamburgo]]. The park currently encompasses important educational institutions, research centers, labs, companies with intensive focus on knowledge, advanced services, incubators, entrepreneurial centers, facilities for the installation and expansion of companies, living areas and rooms for shared use.

The VALETEC Park is ready to host entrepreneurs, new or consolidated companies and institutions that develop or plan on developing [[clean technology]], applied to the following priority areas: agriculture, [[animal husbandry]], and agribusiness; automation and informatics; biotechnology; leather and footwear industry; design; energy; environment; telecommunications; and [[Creative industries|creative economy]]. In the city of Campo Bom, the park segment has capacity for over 120 companies, research centers, scientific and [[economic development]] organizations, and advanced [[service provider]]s. The park's initially encompasses an area of 365,000 m², surrounded by lovely sceneries, a result of our deep respect for the environment. The surroundings have been keeping up with the park's growth. This is the result of the expansion and diversification of existing companies, along with the creation of spaces to host new [[business model]]s and new areas for companies to operate in.

Companies can be installed in the Campo Bom segment of the VALETEC Park under three different modalities: inside the Feevale's [[Business incubator|Technology Incubator]], ITEF, for pre-incubation and incubation; in business accelerators and business condominiums, such as the [[Alberto Santos-Dumont|Alberto Santos Dumont]] Business Center and the Montserrat Business Condominium; and in individual facilities, which companies may choose to either purchase or rent. Feevale is a regional community university (public, yet not [[Public ownership|state-owned]]) which operates in the Campo Bom segment of the VALETEC Park through its Academic Extension Center. This is a space for learning, research and extension activities, with an auditorium, event hall, meeting rooms, restaurant and areas for partners and advanced service providers. In the surroundings of the Academic Extension Center, there are several green preservation areas which make perfect spots for relaxing outdoors, with plenty of shadow to contemplate nature and exercise creativity.

== Innovation Route ==
The Innovation Route represents the VALETEC Park's main axis. It is located along the path of highways RS-239 and BR-116, and its initial project encompasses eight cities. After the Campo Bom segment was established, an opportunity to expand the park was envisioned. This was motivated by the fact that the city's master plan has, since the 1960s, been preserving a minimum of 350 meters on each side of highway RS-239 exclusively for business use. The project received resources from the Research and Projects Financing, FINEP, the Brazilian Innovation Agency, a division of the Ministry of Science and Technology, in order to plan, develop, and implement the [[best practice]]s identified by VALETEC during its international missions. The studies performed made it possible to identify several advantages that ensured the VALETEC Park's success as a regional enterprise.

== Members ==
One of the VALETEC's stylemarks is shared management through a network of alliances. Companies that associate to VALETEC also become members of the VALETEC Park, and have access to a wide range of advantages, such as a relationship network that enables them to develop cooperative projects and receive financial funding for innovation. In addition, members have access to the shared infrastructure and high [[added value]] services, along with the possibility of establishing relationships with associated educational and research institutions.
