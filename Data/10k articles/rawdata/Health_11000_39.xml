'''Adelbert Ames Jr.''' (August 19, 1880 – July 3, 1955)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur S. Koykka|title=Project remember: a national index of gravesites of notable Americans|date=1986|publisher=Reference Publications|isbn=978-0-917256-22-6|page=382}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American scientist who made contributions to [[physics]], [[physiology]], [[ophthalmology]], [[psychology]], and [[philosophy]]. He pioneered the study of physiological optics at [[Dartmouth College]], serving as a research professor, then as director of research at the Dartmouth Eye Institute. He conducted important research into aspects of [[binocular vision]], including [[cyclophoria]] and [[aniseikonia]]. Ames is perhaps best known for constructing [[illusion]]s of [[visual perception]], most notably the [[Ames room]] and  the [[Ames window]]. He was a leading light in the Transactionalist School of psychology and also made contributions to [[social psychology]].

==Formative years==
Adelbert Ames Jr. was born in 1880 in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]. His father, [[Adelbert Ames]], was a general in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] [[Governor of Mississippi|Governor]] and [[United States Senator|Senator]] from [[Mississippi]]; his mother, [[Blanche Butler Ames]], was the daughter of U.S. General [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin F. Butler]], a controversial military leader, politician, and unsuccessful candidate for the U.S. presidency. Apart from his military and administrative service, General Ames obtained several U.S. patents for pencil sharpeners and other mechanical devices. Ames' sister [[Blanche Ames Ames]] was a woman's rights [[suffragist]], and his brother [[Butler Ames]] was a politician and Army officer during the [[Spanish–American War]]. His son, Adelbert Ames III (1921-2018), was the Charles Anthony Pappas Professor of Neuroscience, Emeritus,&lt;ref name=CAPPNE&gt;{{cite web|title=Harvard Catalyst Profiles|url=http://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/profiles/profile/person/3348|accessdate=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Harvard University]]. In research papers, Adelbert Ames Jr. is commonly cited as Adelbert Ames II, to prevent his being confused with his father or his son.

Ames attended [[Phillips Academy|Philips Academy]], [[Andover, Massachusetts]], then went to [[Harvard College]], where he earned a law degree, and where his most influential teachers were [[George Santayana]] and [[William James]] (whose daughter he was also engaged to, but did not marry). After practicing law for a few years, Ames abandoned it to become a painter. For several years, while collaborating with his sister, Blanche Ames (who was also a painter), the two of them tried to determine if the quality of visual art could be improved by the scientific study of vision. Ames set about improving his knowledge of the [[dioptrics|optical components]] of the eye, assuming that once he had mastered them, he would return to painting. As it was, his studies mastered him and Ames made vision his life's work.

Ames went to [[Clark University]] in 1914 to study physiological optics, making enough of an impression to be made one of the eighteen founding members of the [[Optical Society of America]] in 1916. When the U.S. entered [[World War I]] in 1917, he served briefly as a captain in the aviation service, then as the overseer of a machine shop in which prototypes for instruments were developed. While in the army he continued his studies of optics, in part because one of the soldiers in that shop (with whom he became a friend and collaborator) was Charles Proctor, professor of physics at [[Dartmouth College]].

==Dartmouth College==

After the war, Ames went to Dartmouth College in 1919 to work with Proctor. They decided to construct a large-scale model of the human eye using glass for its various layers, humors, and lens. In 1921, this work led to Ames' first published scientific paper, the award of an honorary Master of Arts degree, and his election as professor of research in a new department of Physiological Optics.

In 1923, Ames began recruiting staff of what was to become the Dartmouth Eye Institute. From [[Eastman Kodak Company]] he recruited lens designer Gordon H. Gliddon. More staff joined the department over the years, including [[Kenneth N. Ogle]], with whom Ames worked on [[stereopsis]] and [[binocular vision]]. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1928.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=7 April 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110510021801/http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf| archivedate= 10 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Dartmouth Eye Institute (DEI)==

In 1935 the Department of Physiological Optics became the Dartmouth Eye Institute under the overall directorship of [[Alfred Bielschowsky]], with Ames serving as its director of research. Ames garnered support for it from various sources including [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]], the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], and the American Optical Company. The institute at various times employed between thirty and forty staff, including researchers, and clinicians who examined patients' eyes and made eyeglasses.

Research at the institute concentrated on binocular vision, including [[cyclophoria]] (the tendency of the eyes to rotate in opposite directions in their sockets) and [[aniseikonia]] (in which each eye has a differently sized retinal image of the same object). This latter defect could be corrected by lenses that restored the usual equality of image sizes.

In 1940, Bielschowsky died unexpectedly. Hermann Burian, an ophthalmologist, worked briefly as acting director, and then was relieved by Walter Lancaster. He was not able to exert the influence he wanted, resigning in 1942. On 10 May 1947 the institute was closed.

==Scientific achievements and honors==

Ames is perhaps best known for his eponymous [[Ames room|room]], [[Ames window|window]], and chair. These were called "equivalent configurations" by Ittelson (1952),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ittleson, W. H.|title=The Ames Demonstrations in Perception|date=1952|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined as "configurations [in which] identical 'incoming messages' can come from different external physical arrangements. In the absence of other information,... equivalent configurations will be perceived as identical, no matter how different they be physically" (p.&amp;nbsp;55).

Ames also developed the concept of "transactional ambiguity" holding that "mental set" or expectation could materially affect one's perception of visual and other stimuli, as with the [[Ames trapezoid]].  This hypothesis extended the impact of mental set from the widely believed impact on one's conclusions about stimuli (the eye witness phenomenon) to actual perception of the stimuli itself.  If true, it calls seriously into question the value of eye witness reports even by individuals with no prejudices about their observations. In 1941 Ames began to make notes in the morning on his transactional analysis of perception. In 1960 his collaborator [[Hadley Cantril]] published an edited selection from these notes, with a Preface, and included Ames' correspondence with [[John Dewey]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hadley Cantril]] editor (1960) [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.139344 The Morning Notes of Adelbert Ames], [[Rutgers University Press]] via Internet Archive&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, Ames was awarded an honorary [[Doctor of Laws]] by Dartmouth. In 1955 he won the Tillyer Medal, awarded by the [[Optical Society of America]]. Ames died on July 3, 1955, and was buried at the Dartmouth Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{findagrave|6724367}}&lt;/ref&gt; His name, and that of his siblings, is also inscribed on the gravestone of his parents at the [[Hildreth Cemetery#Hildreth Family Cemetery|Hildreth family cemetery]] in Lowell.

In the address given on the presentation of the Tillyer Medal, the president of the society listed 38 books and scientific papers Ames wrote, and 21 patents awarded to Ames.

== Symptoms ==
Symptoms begin in infancy and include:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* [[hypotonia]]
* [[Hyporeflexia|areflexia]]
* [[amyotrophy]]
* variable degrees of [[Agenesis of the corpus callosum|dysgenesis]] of the [[corpus callosum]]
* mild to severe intellectual and developmental delay
* psychiatric problems including paranoid delusions, depression, hallucinations and autistic-like behavior
== Genetics ==
The inheritance pattern is [[autosomal recessive]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Several genes have been associated with the disorder, including [[SLC12A6]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
==Diagnosis==
{{Empty section|date=October 2017}}
==Neuropathology==
Autopsy examination of 8 cases&lt;ref name="pmid27230413"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Auer RN, Laganière JL, Robitaille YO, Richardson J, Dion PA, Rouleau GA, Shekarabi M |title=KCC3 axonopathy: neuropathological features in the central and peripheral nervous system |journal=Modern Pathology |volume=29 |pages=962-976 |year=2016 |pmid=27230413 |doi=10.1038/modpathol.2016.90}}&lt;/ref&gt; has shown both developmental and degenerative neuropathologic features in this disease, consistent with clinical duality as both a [[Neurodevelopmental disorder|neurodevelopmental]] and [[Neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] disorder. 

In the [[central nervous system]], accompanying the [[hypotonia]] at birth is [[hypoplasia]] of the [[Pyramidal tracts|corticospinal tracts]]. Another developmental feature is seen in the [[corpus callosum]], which varies from [[Agenesis of the corpus callosum|absent]] to [[Hypoplasia|hypoplastic]]. The [[anterior commissure]] is almost always absent, but occasionally hypoplastic. A [[Longitudinal callosal fascicle|bundle of Probst]] can be found running antero-posterior rather than crossing the midline. The axonal damage due to the channel deficiency can cause a reactive axonal overgrowth leading to small tumor-like growths, or tumorlets, called axonomas, or balls of aberrant axons. Damaged axons can also show a sign of inhibition of [[axonal transport]], forming [[axonal spheroid]]s. These [[axonal spheroid|spheroid]]s can be throughout the cerebral hemispheres, explaining the psychotic symptoms by disconnection of the brain from itself by axonal functional disruption. 

In the [[Peripheral nervous system]], the disease is more severe. While most nervous system diseases affect either [[Central nervous system|CNS]] or [[Peripheral nervous system|PNS]], this disease affects both, but it is the changes in the [[peripheral nervous system]] that lead to [[death]]. This occurs by axonal disease paralyzing the [[skeletal muscle]]s, including the [[Muscles of respiration|respiratory muscles]] as a result of axonal damage in peripheral nerves. Changes in the axons are more severe in the PNS than CNS and under the electron microscope, some axons look necrotic, by virtue of containing mitochondrial flocculent densities and other irreversible changes.&lt;ref name="pmid27230413"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Auer RN, Laganière JL, Robitaille YO, Richardson J, Dion PA, Rouleau GA, Shekarabi M |title=KCC3 axonopathy: neuropathological features in the central and peripheral nervous system |journal=Modern Pathology |volume=29 |pages=962-976 |year=2016 |pmid=27230413 |doi=10.1038/modpathol.2016.90}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of innervation of the body musculature during development gives rise to small body weights, often below 40 kilograms, remarkable in view of the preserved brain weights.&lt;ref name="pmid27230413"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Auer RN, Laganière JL, Robitaille YO, Richardson J, Dion PA, Rouleau GA, Shekarabi M |title=KCC3 axonopathy: neuropathological features in the central and peripheral nervous system |journal=Modern Pathology |volume=29 |pages=962-976 |year=2016 |pmid=27230413 |doi=10.1038/modpathol.2016.90}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
== Treatment ==
There is currently no cure, but some symptoms may be treated such as [[neuroleptics]] for the psychiatric problems.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Prognosis ==
The prognosis is poor. Patients are usually wheelchair bound by their 20s and die by their 30s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
== Prevalence ==
The prevalence rate has been estimated to be less than 1/1,000,000 worldwide.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, it is much more common in the [[French Canadians|French-Canadian]] population of the [[Saguenay, Quebec|Saguenay]] and [[Lac-Saint-Jean|Lac-St-Jean]] regions of Quebec, Canada, where it has a frequency of about 1 in 2100 in live births, and a carrier rate of 1 in 23.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Ann MacKinnon''', also '''Annie P. MacKinnon''', (1879-1953) was born in [[Roag]], in the [[Skye|Isle of Skye]]. During the [[World War I|First World War]] she joined the French Flag Nursing Corps and served in France. For this she was awarded the French military award, the [[Croix de Guerre]]. Following the war she remained in France to work before moving to the USA and working for the [[Frontier Nursing Service]] in Kentucky.

== Early life and education ==
MacKinnon was born on the 4 March 1879 in Roag, Isle of Skye.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/897503159|title=The great book of Skye : from the island to the world : people and place on a Scottish island|last=Norman,|first=Macdonald,|others=Maclean, Cailean,|isbn=0952868792|location=Portree|oclc=897503159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents were John MacKinnon and Georgina Urquhart. MacKinnon was educated at Dunvegan Primary School before moving to the central belt to train as a nurse. She spent four years at the School of Nursing in [[Ayr Hospital]] then went on to gain the Queen's District Nursing and Midwifery qualification in Edinburgh.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ruralgp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/DewarBookletPDFWeb.pdf|title=From Cart to Air Ambulance: Papers from a Conference Celebrating 100 Years of Healthcare in Skye and Lochalsh|author=Macdonald, Norman|publisher=Skye and Lochalsh Archive Centre|date=2013|access-date=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacKinnon worked as a probationer nurse in Braehead Cottage Hospital, Dumbarton from 1901.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Career ==

=== Army career in France ===
In 1914, Ann MacKinnon joined the French Flag Nursing Corps and soon after travelled to France as the First World War intensified. MacKinnon and the other 'British Nurses in France' were on the [[Front line|Front Line]]. In 1918 MacKinnon was awarded the [[Croix de Guerre]] for bravery during the [[Third Battle of the Aisne]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  This was recorded by The Times newspaper and The British Journal of Nursing: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Following is the citation of the French army conferring the Croix de Guerre on Miss Annie Mackinnon, a British nurse attached to the French Flag Nursing coprs. A nurse who under the difficult circumstances of the withdrawal of the ambulance under enemy fire continued to attend the sick and wounded up to the last minute with remarkable courage and thus demonstrating the three years that she has devoted herself to the French soldiers."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Following the war MacKinnon remained in France working in Marseille and Paris for the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] which was part of the relief effort sending food supplies to the European continent. Her main role was to educate a group of French girls about nursing, including tuberculosis and infant welfare.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Career in America ===
MacKinnon travelled to America on the Mormacswan, arriving in New York in 1928. She worked in Beech Fork Nursing Centre and the Hayden Hospital, Kentucky. [[Mary Carson Breckinridge|Mary Breckinridge]] appointed  MacKinnon superintendent of Hayden Hospital in 1929.&lt;ref name=breck&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/7631462|title=Wide neighborhoods : a story of the Frontier Nursing Service|last=1881-1965.|first=Breckinridge, Mary,|date=1981|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0813114535|location=Lexington, Ky.|oclc=7631462}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacKinnon held this post until 1940, when she travelled to Europe during the Second World War, returning to the USA and the role in 1948.&lt;ref name="breck"/&gt; Hayden Hospital was part of the newly created the [[Frontier Nursing Service]] which included midwifes in their team of public health services and covered a population of close to ten thousand people. The Frontier Nursing Service (FNS) established six outposts in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] in eastern North America.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The FNS was established by Mary Breckinridge after she travelled to the Highlands and Islands to see how healthcare is provided in rural locations. Her goal was to replicate the Highlands and Islands Medical and Nursing Service model in the Appalachian area of America.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; MacKinnon became known as Ann of [[Appalachia]] and rode a mule called Tenacity to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/the-gutsy-hebridean-heroines-who-inspired-the-nhs-1-4348997|title=The gutsy "Hebridean Heroines" who inspired the NHS|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, along with Breckinridge, MacKinnon was a founding member of The Kentucky State Association of Midwives. This was the first association of [[Midwives in the United States|midwives in the USA]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Death ==
Ann MacKinnon died of a heart attack on 6 February 1953 in Hayden, Kentucky. She is buried at Wendover, Kentucky.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Honours ==
Ann MacKinnon was awarded the Croix de Guerre for bravery during the First World War.

'''Breast shells''' are hollow, lightweight plastic disks worn inside the [[brassiere]] to help correct flat or [[inverted nipple]]s either in preparation for or during [[breastfeeding]]. Also known as '''milk cups''', '''breast cups''', '''breast shields''', or '''Woolwich shields''', they can also be used to ease sensitive nipples or collect milk when the baby has not finished the teat.&lt;ref name=woessner&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woessner|first1=Candace|title=Breastfeeding Today|date=January 1, 1995|publisher=Avery|pages=220–221|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breast shells function by applying gentle but firm pressure to the region surrounding the nipple to stretch underlying [[adhesions]] and draw out the nipple.&lt;ref name=mohrbacher&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mohrbacher|first1=Nancy|title=The Breastfeeding Answer Book|date=January 1, 2003|publisher=La Leche League International|page=472}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nipple shield (breastfeeding)|Nipple shields]] may be confused with breast shells, but shields are intended for use during the act of breastfeeding, whereas breast shells are worn in preparation for or after breastfeeding.

==Usage==
A breast shell is composed of inner and outer sections which snap together and enclose the nipple. The inner section, which encircles the nipple and puts pressure on the surrounding breast tissue, is often lined with soft material such as [[silicone]]. The rigid outer section separates the nipple from the bra and clothing and leaves open a space which can collect milk.&lt;ref name=woessner /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bhkaufen.de/bh-waschen/|title=BH waschen, aber richtig|last=|first=|date=|access-date=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shell is slightly concave to conform to the shape of the breast. Despite this, it can still sometimes be visible under tight clothing. Shells come apart for washing, which should be done frequently as the shell also tends to make the mother's breast sweat, which can increase bacteria growth and cause irritation. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

If the shell is used to help ready the mother for breastfeeding, this is best done during pregnancy because the shell can increase leaking of breast milk or [[colostrum]]. On the other hand, some wear breast shells to collect leaking milk while nursing the baby on the other breast.&lt;ref name=woessner /&gt; If worn to correct inverted or flat nipples, the shells are typically worn during the [[third trimester]] for up to 10 hours daily as the mother's comfort dictates.&lt;ref name=mohrbacher /&gt;

==Criticism==
Some research suggests that breast shells used on inverted nipples may either hinder or have no effect on the mother's ability to breastfeed successfully. One study of women with inverted or non-protractile nipples found no statistically significant difference in breastfeeding success between using breast shields and doing nothing.&lt;ref name=alexander&gt;{{cite journal |last=Alexander |first=JM |date=April 1992 |title= Randomised controlled trial of breast shells and Hoffman's exercises for inverted and non-protractile nipples |journal=British Medical Journal |volume=304 |issue=6833 |pages=1030–2 |doi=10.1136/bmj.304.6833.1030 |pmid=1586788 |pmc=1881748|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19791">'''CARTaGENE  ''' is a population based [[Cohort (statistics)|cohort]] based on an ongoing and long-term health study of 40, 000 men and women in [[Québec]]. It is a regional cohort member of the Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.partnershipfortomorrow.ca/ | title=Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow Project -}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project's core mandate is to identify the genetic and environmental causes of common chronic diseases affecting the Québec population. The overall objective from a public health perspective is to develop personalized medicine and public policy initiatives targeting high-risk groups.&lt;ref name="Cartagene project website" /&gt; 
CARTaGENE is under the scientific direction of Sébastien Jacquemont, M.D., Ekaterini Kritikou, Ph.D. and Philippe Broët, M.D. Ph.D., of the Sainte-Justine Children’s Hospital University Health Center.  
Based in Montréal Québec, Canada, CARTaGENE is operated under the infrastructure of the Sainte-Justine Children’s Hospital University Health Center and has seen funding from [[Genome Canada]], the [[Canadian Foundation for Innovation]] and Génome Québec&lt;ref name="genomequebec"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.genomequebec.com/ | title=Recherche québécoise - Génome humain &amp; ADN &amp;#124; Génome Quebec}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Canadian Partnership Against Cancer]] (CPAC) since 2007 among other sources.&lt;ref name="Cartagene project website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cartagene|url=http://www.cartagene.qc.ca/en|work=cartagene.qc.ca|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was initially founded by Professors Claude Laberge and [[Bartha Knoppers]], and developed through two phases of participant recruitment under a scientific director.

== Design ==
The CARTaGENE cohort was set up to recruit men and women aged 40–69 years old from Québec representing an age range most at risk for developing chronic diseases, including [[cardiovascular disease]], [[metabolic]] disorders like [[diabetes mellitus]] and [[cancer]] among others.&lt;ref name="Cartagene project website" /&gt;  Taking place between August 2009 and October 2010, 20 007 participants were enrolled in its first phase of recruitment (Phase A)&lt;ref name="awadallaphilipJofEpi"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Awadalla|first=Philip |author2=Catherine Boileau |author3=Yves Payette |author4=Youssef Idaghour |author5=Jean-Philippe Goulet |author6=Bartha Knoppers |author7=Pavel Hamet |author8=Claude Laberge|title=Cohort profile of the CARTaGENE study: Quebec's population-based biobank for public health and personalized genomics|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology|date=October 15, 2012|pages=1285–99|doi=10.1093/ije/dys160|url=http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/10/15/ije.dys160.full.pdf?keytype=ref&amp;ijkey=XqcOQPsEIDemgus|accessdate=3 April 2013 |volume=42 |issue=5 |pmid=23071140}}&lt;/ref&gt; and between December 2012 and February 2015 a new wave of recruitment (Phase B) has enrolled an additional 20 000 participants.&lt;ref name="Cartagene project website" /&gt;  The participants were randomly selected and tracked based on their files in the governmental health administrative databases ([[RAMQ]]-Régie de l’Assurance Maladie du Québec).&lt;ref name=awadallaphilipJofEpi /&gt; Participants were also selected to be representative of 1% of the metropolitan areas of [[Québec]], specifically [[Montreal]], [[Québec city]], [[Sherbrooke]] and the [[Saguenay, Quebec|Saguenay]].&lt;ref name=awadallaphilipJofEpi /&gt;  Because of administrative linkage between the RAMQ and the CHU Sainte-Justine, participants can be passively followed for the next 50 years making it one of the longest and largest ongoing population studies in the world.&lt;ref name=awadallaphilipJofEpi /&gt; 
Information packages about the project were first sent by mail and potential participants were contacted by telephone to enroll and schedule visits to one of the clinical assessment sites.&lt;ref name=awadallaphilipJofEpi /&gt; 
Moreover, CARTaGENE is part of a Canada-wide [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]] collecting samples across the country whose methods were applied in the design of the five cohorts within the Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow Project&lt;ref name="partnershipfortomorrow.ca"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.partnershipfortomorrow.ca | title=Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow Project -}}&lt;/ref&gt; (CPTP).&lt;ref name=awadallaphilipJofEpi /&gt;

== Molecular profiling ==

Blood collection was designed such that [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] can be extracted for future use&lt;ref name=awadallaphilipJofEpi /&gt; allowing for population level [[gene expression]] analysis and [[genotyping]].&lt;ref name=awadallaphilipJofEpi /&gt; Storage conditions are also optimized for [[proteomics]] and [[lipidomics]].&lt;ref name=awadallaphilipJofEpi /&gt;  The CARTaGENE project has a Systems [[Genomics]] program to identify critical events associated with a number of cardiovascular related [[endophenotype]]s &lt;ref name="Cartagene project website" /&gt; . It is developing integrative technologies and approaches to capture e[[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s (eSNPs) associated with endophenotypes.&lt;ref name=YoussefFrontiers&gt;{{cite journal|last=Idagdhour|first=Youssef|author2=Awadalla, Philip|title=Exploiting gene expression variation to capture gene-environment interactions for disease|journal=Frontiers in Genetics|date=October 2012|pages=6|doi= 10.3389/fgene.2012.00228 |pmid=23755064|pmc=3668192|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Typical studies===
Typical studies include population-based [[longitudinal studies]]. Researchers may try to evaluate the contribution of a particular lifestyle, environmental and genetic factor and a chosen [[endophenotype]]. The use of endophenotypes facilitates the integration of multiple levels of data painting a more realistic portrait of [[gene-environment interaction]]s influencing particular endophenotypes&lt;ref name=awadallaphilipJofEpi /&gt;

== Development ==
There was an initial pilot study done under the direction of Professor [[Bartha Knoppers]] (McGill University) and Professor Claude Laberge ([[Laval University]]) that involved 223 participants who responded to a questionnaire based on the [[P3G]] DataSHaPER&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.datashaper.org/ | title=RStudio Sign in}}&lt;/ref&gt; model.  The scales used in the questionnaires were developed and revised by more than 30 experts from various fields and are widely used.&lt;ref name=awadallaphilipJofEpi /&gt; These included the Patient Health questionnaire,&lt;ref name="spitzer1999"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Spitzer RL, Kroenke K, Williams JB |title=Validation and utility of a self-report version of PRIME-MD: the PHQ primary care study.

Beginning in 2009, a total of 12 assessment sites across the province were established for clinical and physical assessments.&lt;ref name=awadallaphilipJofEpi /&gt; Following initial phone contact, participants were invited to come to the assessment site and sign a consent form.&lt;ref name=awadallaphilipJofEpi /&gt; They were asked to complete a self-administered [[wikt:socio-demographic]] and lifestyle questionnaire and an interviewer-administered health questionnaire.&lt;ref name=awadallaphilipJofEpi /&gt; A [[genealogical]] questionnaire was also included&lt;ref&gt;Quebec Reference Sample Population Genetics and Genetic Epidemiology in Quebec: BALSAC, http://www.quebecgenpop.ca/BALfichier_en.html&lt;/ref&gt; for completion online. Non-invasive measurements were taken for all participants that included basic measurements such as weight, height, [[blood pressure]].&lt;ref name=awadallaphilipJofEpi /&gt; Blood, saliva and [[urine]] were collected and preserved at the Biobanque Génome Québec and the affiliated University Hospital Center in Chicoutimi (Biobanque GQ-CAURC&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.genomequebec.com/en/gq-caurc-bionbank.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-04-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814113633/http://www.genomequebec.com/en/gq-caurc-bionbank.html# |archive-date=2013-08-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) for future use.&lt;ref name=awadallaphilipJofEpi /&gt; Surveys about nutrition&lt;ref name="Cartagene project website" /&gt;   are also included and residential information, occupational history and food frequency data questionnaires are administered.&lt;ref name="Cartagene project website" /&gt; Ending in February 2015, a total of over 40,000 participants were recruited to the CARTaGENE program and data is accessible through the Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow Program portal &lt;ref name="portal.partnershipfortomorrow.ca"&gt;https://portal.partnershipfortomorrow.ca/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethics and governance ==
CARTaGENE complies with all local, national, international laws and ethical norms.&lt;ref name="Cartagene project website" /&gt; These include the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], the [[Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms]], the [[Civil Code of Québec]], 
the [[Declaration of Helsinki]]-World Medical Association (revised in 2008), the [[Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights]] (1997) and the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights: UNESCO (2005),&lt;ref name="Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights"&gt;{{cite web|title=Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/bioethics/bioethics-and-human-rights/|work=www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/bioethics/bioethics-and-human-rights|accessdate=3 April 2013|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001461/146180E.pdf|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[UNESCO]]) among others. CARTaGENE also complies with recommendations by the "Plan d’action ministériel en éthique de la recherche et en intégrité scientifique from the [[MSSS]] (1998)",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plan d'action ministériel en éthique de la recherche et en intégrité scientifique|work=ethique.msss.gouv.qc.ca|publisher=msss|url=http://ethique.msss.gouv.qc.ca/site/download.php?c6d3e3200feeca4c50623083af406127|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "Guide d’élaboration de normes de gestion des banques de données also from the [[MSSS]] (2004)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide de normes de gestion des banques de données|work=msss.gouv.qc.ca|publisher=MSSS|url=http://publications.msss.gouv.qc.ca/acrobat/f/documentation/2012/12-727-02W.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Politique de la recherche avec des êtres humains (2004)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Éthique de la recherche avec des êtres humains|url=http://www.ethique.gc.ca|work=ethique.gc.ca|publisher=Gouvernement du Québec|accessdate=3 April 2013|location=http://ethique.gc.ca/pdf/fra/eptc2/EPTC_2_FINALE_Web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others.&lt;ref name="Cartagene project website" /&gt;

== Legal monitoring ==
CARTaGENE is monitored by the [[Research ethics]] Board of the Sainte-Justine University Health Center.&lt;ref name="Cartagene project website" /&gt; It is also under the supervision of the Information Access Commission (the CAI&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.cai.gouv.qc.ca | title=Commission d'accès à l'information du Québec &amp;#124;}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This organization authorizes the transfer of information from the RAMQ to the call center that contacts participants and all personal information held by CARTaGENE is subject to surveillance by the CAI.&lt;ref name="Cartagene project website" /&gt;

== Access ==

Participant medical history is maintained at a centralized governmental database (RAMQ) allowing researchers to track these individuals for the duration of the study and monitor all medical events, prescriptions of drugs and deaths.&lt;ref name="Cartagene project website" /&gt;  The [[personal information]] connecting [[medical records]] to the patient identification undergoes [[de-identification]] and is coded by CARTaGENE, but handled and managed by the RAMQ ensuring patient [[confidentiality]].&lt;ref name="Cartagene project website" /&gt;

Researchers can request access to the CARTaGENE data through the Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow Project Portal.&lt;ref name="portal.partnershipfortomorrow.ca"/&gt; Researchers must submit an application and undergo evaluation by an independent Sample and Data Access Committee (SDAC).&lt;ref name="Cartagene project website" /&gt; eThe dataset is available to researchers in industry and academic institutions, nationally and internationally. Applications detailing their project proposal are a requirement for review by an independent committee, the Sample and Data Access Committee (SDAC).&lt;ref name="Cartagene project website" /&gt; The scientific management of CARTaGENE along with the SDAC determines if data or results should need to be returned to the project. Submission for access to the dataset is done directly online.&lt;ref name="Cartagene project website" /&gt;

== Recruitment and reassessment ==
Health reassessments will take place regularly, using web-based questionnaires in the coming years.&lt;ref name=awadallaphilipJofEpi /&gt; Patients may be tracked for up to 50 years based on their linkage to governmental health administrative databases.&lt;ref name=awadallaphilipJofEpi /&gt;

== Harmonization ==
CARTaGENE has been designed such that its infrastructure including the collection of samples, measurements of biological variables and the storage procedures can be harmonized with other international large-scale cohorts via the Public Population Project in Genomics (P3G) platform. The P3G facilitates the work of biobankers and improves collaboration throughout the international human genomics research community.&lt;ref&gt;Fortin, S., Pathmasiri, S., Grintuch, R. &amp; Deschenes, M. 'Access arrangements' for biobanks: a fine line between facilitating and hindering collaboration. Public Health genomics 14, 104-114, doi:10.1159/000309852 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;
A nationwide effort is underway to collect samples from participants across Canada, with CaG representing one of five cohorts within the Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow (CPTP).&lt;ref name="partnershipfortomorrow.ca"/&gt; CPTP is recruiting 300 000 participants to create a national databank on population health whose core mandate is to develop strategic initiatives leading to policy change to address the growing impact of chronic disease in a growing Canadian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.091540| title = The Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow Project: Building a pan-Canadian research platform for disease prevention| journal = Canadian Medical Association Journal| volume = 182| issue = 11| pages = 1197–1201| year = 2010| last1 = Borugian | first1 = M.

== Opinion and media ==
The public was generally receptive to the creation of the CARTaGENE project and an independent study reported on the consultations held with members of the public.&lt;ref name="godard"&gt;Godard, B., Marshall, J. &amp; Laberge, C. Community engagement in genetic research: results of the first public consultation for the Quebec CARTaGENE project. Community genetics 10, 147-158, doi:10.1159/000101756 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The main concerns raised were about safeguarding medical records and confidentiality, respect for individual transparency, the donor's right to feedback and governance.&lt;ref name="godard" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37671">'''[[Capital punishment]]''' is a legal penalty in '''[[Taiwan]]''', officially the Republic of China. The death penalty can be imposed for murder, treason, drug trafficking, terrorism and especially serious cases of robbery, rape and kidnapping and many other serious offenses, such as [[piracy]] and also for military offences, such as [[desertion]]. 

Before 2000, Taiwan had a relatively high execution rate when strict laws were still in effect in the harsh political environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fju.lawbank.com.tw/room-reply.asp?tpid%3D395%26tid%3D128 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927020445/http://fju.lawbank.com.tw/room-reply.asp?tpid=395&amp;tid=128 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after controversial cases during the 1990s and the changing attitudes of some officials towards [[Abolitionism|abolition]], the number of executions dropped significantly, with only three in 2005 and none between 2006 and 2009. Executions resumed in 2010. According to the poll numbers, more than 80% of [[Taiwanese people]] support maintaining the use of capital punishment.

In practice, since 2003, almost all death sentences and executions have been restricted to murder-related offenses. The last execution solely for crimes other than homicide took place in October 2002 in the case of a [[Pingtung County]] fisherman who trafficked 295&amp;nbsp;kg heroin in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2002/new/oct/9/today-c10.htm|title=綜合新聞|work=libertytimes.com.tw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017214146/http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2002/new/oct/9/today-c10.htm|archivedate=2012-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defunct laws===
The following two laws previously gave certain offenses a mandatory death penalty and have historically made a significant contribution to the numbers of people executed:

*Act for the Control and Punishment of Rebellion ([[s:zh:懲治叛亂條例|zh:懲治叛亂條例]], rescinded in May 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.moj.gov.tw/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=C0000010|title=懲治叛亂條例-全國法規資料庫入口網站|work=moj.gov.tw}}&lt;/ref&gt;) which imposed a mandatory death sentence on treason, espionage and defection. Enacted in 1949 when the [[Government of the Republic of China|Central Government]] had just retreated to Taiwan, this law was applicable in both military and common courts and played an important role during the [[White Terror (Taiwan)|white terror]] period. Information about people sentenced according to this law was restricted because they counted as [[court-martial]]s. In two high-profile cases, [[Bo Yang]] and [[Shih Ming-teh]] were both sentenced to death under this law, but were finally given [[life imprisonment]] due to worldwide political pressure during their trials.
*Act for the Control and Punishment of Banditry ([[s:zh:懲治盜匪條例|zh:懲治盜匪條例]], rescinded in January 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.moj.gov.tw/LawClass/LawContent.aspx?PCODE=C0000005|title=懲治盜匪條例-全國法規資料庫入口網站|work=moj.gov.tw}}&lt;/ref&gt;) which ruled a mandatory death penalty on kidnapping, piracy or robbery along with murder, rape and arson. Originally enacted as a short-term special law by the Kuomintang government during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] period, the law was extended for a long time for a variety of reasons.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

== Execution process ==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2016}}
A ROC judicial execution requires a final sentence from the [[Supreme Court of the Republic of China]] and a death order signed by the Minister of Justice. After the Supreme Court issues a final death sentence, the case is transferred to the [[Ministry of Justice (Taiwan)|Ministry of Justice]], where the Minister of Justice issues a final secret execution date.

The death order from the Minister of Justice is received and performed by the High Prosecutors' offices, so executions are carried out inside the [[Prison|detention centers]] of the five cities having a High Court: [[Taipei]], [[Taichung]], [[Tainan City|Tainan]], [[Kaohsiung]] and [[Hualien City|Hualien]]. Like [[Capital punishment in Japan|Japan]], ROC [[death row]] inmates are kept in detention centers but not prisons, and under harsher conditions than general prisoners. They are housed two inmates to a cell (or solitary imprisonment in cases of misbehavior or violence). The practice of shackling prisoners 24 hours a day has been reported to be no longer in effect, but prisoners on death row are only allowed to leave the cell for a half-hour a day for exercise.&lt;ref name="dpw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Death Penalty Database: Taiwan|url=http://www.deathpenaltyworldwide.org/country-search-post.cfm?country=taiwan|website=Death Penalty Worldwide|accessdate=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prisoners are allowed to read censored newspapers and books as well as practice [[religion|religious]] activities with approved religious personnel.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The execution chamber is located in the prison complex. The condemned is brought to the chamber by car and pays respect to the statue of [[Ksitigarbha]] located outside the chamber before entering. Before the execution, the prisoner is brought to a special court next to the execution chamber to have his or her identity confirmed and any [[last words]] recorded. The prisoner is then brought to the execution chamber and served a [[last meal]] (which includes a bottle of [[kaoliang wine]]).&lt;ref name="apple" /&gt; The condemned prisoner is then injected with strong [[anaesthetic]] to render him or her completely senseless, laid flat on the ground, face down, and shot. The executioner then burns [[hell bank note|votive bank note]]s for the deceased before carrying away the corpse.&lt;ref name="apple" /&gt; It is customary for the condemned to place a [[NT$]]500 or 1000 banknote in their leg irons as a tip for the executioners.&lt;ref name="apple" /&gt;

After the execution, the High Prosecutors' Office will issue the official announcement of the execution. Although the Ministry of Justice has studied other methods including [[hanging]] and [[lethal injection]] since the early 1990s,{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} execution by shooting (performed by local [[bailiff]]s or [[military police]]men) is the only execution method used in the ROC currently (including military executions).{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

ROC military sentences and executions are administered only by the [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]] and have no connection with the Ministry of Justice.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Military sentences and executions are carried out in military courts and prisons across the island as well as [[Penghu]], [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Unlike the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of National Defense does not release detailed information on executions, and so little information is available.

==Execution statistics==
The ROC's Ministry of Justice annually publishes detailed statistics on each year's executions, including the executed person's name, age, sex, crime, nationality, education, etc. The numbers of executions since 1987 are listed below:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jrf.org.tw/mag/mag_02s2.asp?SN=1104 司改會著作．法案－司改雜誌－政策宣示三年 實際作為形同牛步 廢除死刑不該只是口號&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928023441/http://www.jrf.org.tw/mag/mag_02s2.asp?SN=1104 |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deathpenalty.org.tw/read.php?id%3D99%26class%3D40 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928162759/http://www.deathpenalty.org.tw/read.php?id=99&amp;class=40 |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The execution tally was at its height in the late 1980s and early 1990s when the [[Martial law#Republic of China .28Taiwan.29|martial law]] had just been lifted and social order was destabilized. The strict &lt;cite&gt;Act for the Control and Punishment of Banditry&lt;/cite&gt; resulted in the execution of many prisoners.

Among the executed were a small number of foreign nationals from [[China]], the [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]]. They were executed in Taiwan for kidnapping, murder or drug trafficking offenses.&lt;ref&gt;[[:zh:反共義士]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.judicial.gov.tw/constitutionalcourt/p03_01_printpage.asp?expno=263|title=大法官解釋_友善列印|work=judicial.gov.tw}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epochtimes.com/b5/1/8/11/n118390.htm|title=卓長仁,姜洪軍昨槍決 高喊「中華民國萬歲」|work=大紀元 www.epochtimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversial death sentences==

===Organ transplantation===
There are accounts of organs being removed from executed prisoners while they were still medically alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epochtimes.com/b5/1/3/2/n53185.htm|title=台灣死囚捐器官擬放寬 神經學會反彈|work=大紀元 www.epochtimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2002/new/dec/3/today-c7.htm|title=綜合新聞|work=libertytimes.com.tw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Death Penalty Procedural Rules (執行死刑規則) of Taiwan, executees who are willing to donate their organs are shot in the head. Twenty minutes after the execution, an examination is conducted to verify the death of the condemned person. Prisoners donating organs are sent to hospitals for organ collection after completion of the execution is confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.moj.gov.tw/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=I0040012|title=執行死刑規則-全國法規資料庫入口網站|work=moj.gov.tw}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa38/004/1992/en/{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Human Organ Transplantation Act (人體器官移植條例) of Taiwan, an organ donor can only donate after being judged brain-dead by a medical doctor. When a ventilator is in use, there must be an observation period of 12 hours for the first evaluation and a four-hour period for the second evaluation to reach a judgement of brain death.

In Taiwan, there have been cases of executees being sent to hospitals for organ collection without legal confirmation of brain death, leading to accusations that human vivisection for organ collection and transplantation is in practice in Taiwan. There was a case in 1991 in which an executee was found to be still breathing unaided when being prepared for organ collection in the Taipei Veterans General Hospital. The executee was sent back to the execution ground to complete the execution. This case caused the Taipei Veterans General Hospital to refuse organ collection of executees for eight years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tlea.org.tw/print_comm.php?code=a1&amp;sn=790{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Taiwan banned the use of organs from executed prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Hsiao, [http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2015/06/13/2003620572 “Organ transplant laws tightened”] Taipei Times, 13 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Hsichih Trio case===
In March 1991 a [[Xizhi District|Hsichih]] couple, Wu Ming-han (吳銘漢) and Yeh Ying-lan (葉盈蘭), were found robbed and brutally murdered inside their apartment. In August 1991 police arrested their neighbor Wang Wen-hsiao (王文孝), then serving in the ROC Marine Corps, based on Wang's bloody [[fingerprint]] found at the scene. He confessed to the murder after investigators discovered evidence of him breaking in and [[burglarizing]] the house, but police doubted he could have killed two adults so easily and brutally without help. Under torture, Wang confessed to help from three accomplices who lived in the same community—Su Chien-ho (蘇建和), Chuang Lin-hsun (莊林勳) and Liu Bin-lang (劉秉郎).&lt;ref&gt;Taipei Times, Guilty by Association? Aug 29, 2010, http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2010/08/29/2003481562&lt;/ref&gt; These four young men further confessed that they [[gang rape]]d Yeh Ying-lan during their break-in, but the [[autopsy]] of Yeh's body showed no traces of sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;The China Post, 'Hsichih Trio' in Surprise Acquittal, Jan 14, 2003, http://www.chinapost.com.tw/detail.asp?ID=34070&amp;GRP=p1/%E2%80%98Hsichih-Trio%E2%80%99.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Wang Wen-hsiao was [[court-martial]]ed and speedily executed in January 1992. The other three [[defendant]]s were prosecuted under the ''Act for the Control and Punishment of Banditry'', which stipulated compulsory death sentences for their crimes if found guilty. During their trial the defendants repeatedly claimed they were forced to make false confessions under torture and were not guilty, but the judges did not believe them.

In February 1995, the [[Supreme Court of the Republic of China]] found against the defendants. According to procedure, the three should then have been executed by shooting as soon as possible, but Minister of Justice [[Ma Ying-jeou]] refused to sign their death warrants and returned the whole case back to the Supreme Court in hope of a retrial, citing shortcomings such as:

*Only two pieces of evidence were brought against the defendants: Wang Wen-hsiao's confessions and the [[NT$]] 24 dollars (less than $1.00 US) found in Chuang Lin-hsun's home and considered to be [[Looting|booty]]. The evidence was too weak: Wang Wen-hsiao was executed too early to witness the case and NT$24 was a tiny amount.&lt;ref&gt;Taiwan Panorama, New Development in Case of the Hsichih Trio, Nov 2000, http://www.sino.gov.tw/en/show_issue.php?id=2000118911050e.txt&amp;table=2&amp;h1=About%20Taiwan&amp;h2={{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Although all four defendants claimed they were tortured during police interrogation, at which there was no lawyer present, the judges did not investigate this point thoroughly. Wang Wen-hsiao's brother Wang Wen-chung (王文忠) even claimed Hsichih police originally asked his brother to confess as an accomplice, but he had refused.
*There was no proof that Yeh Ying-lan was raped.

Between 1995 and 2000, Ma Ying-jeou and his three successors filed several retrial requests with the Supreme Court, but all were rejected. Meantime, this case drew the attention of [[Amnesty International]] and was widely broadcast throughout the world, nicknamed as "the Hsichih Trio".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tahr.org.tw/site/english/sjh.html The Case of Su Chien-ho, Liu Bin-lang, and Chuang Lin-hsun&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525215454/http://www.tahr.org.tw/site/english/sjh.html |date=May 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court ordered a retrial on May 19, 2000, just one day before former President [[Chen Shui-bian]]'s inauguration. On January 13, 2003, the Taiwan High Court passed a verdict that they were not guilty and released them, but the victims' families were unwilling to accept this and [[appeal]]ed.&lt;ref name="taipeitimes.com"&gt;Taipei Times, Guilty by Association, Aug 29, 2010, http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2010/08/29/2003481562/2&lt;/ref&gt; On June 29, 2007, the Taiwan High Court once again found the trio guilty and condemned them to death, but surprisingly did not put them in custody&lt;ref name="taipeitimes.com"/&gt; because "the 3 defendants are already famous worldwide and will be identified in any place", the first such case in the ROC history. 
On Nov 12, 2010, the Taiwan High Court delivered another verdict, revoking the previous decision and finding the three not guilty, "as there was no proof for the crime they were accused of."&lt;ref&gt;AFP, Taiwan court acquits three in 20-year-old murder case, Nov 12, 2010, https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20101112/wl_asia_afp/taiwanjusticecrime_20101112060440{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecutor appealed again, and the Supreme Court ordered yet another retrial on Apr. 21, 2011. On Aug. 31, 2012, the High Court reaffirmed the innocence of the three defendants. According to criminal procedure legislation that came into effect in 2010, when court proceedings have begun on a criminal case more than six years previously, and the Supreme Court had ordered more than three retrials, if the High Court has already found the defendants to be non-guilty twice and decided non-guilty again in the third trial, the prosecutor can no longer appeal.&lt;ref name="Yam News"&gt;新聞辭典：刑事妥速審判法, May 18, 2012, http://n.yam.com/rti/society/201205/20120518719757.html "審判時間超過6年且更三審以上的案件，若...一審判有罪、二審判無罪2次、最後一次判無罪者，檢方即不得再上訴。" "in a criminal case that started its procedure more than 6 years ago and was ordered more than 3 retrials, if the Lower Court ruled guilty, the High Court already ruled non-guilty twice, and ruled non-guilty in the last trial, the prosecutor can no longer appeal."&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court delivered the first non-guilty verdict in 2003, and again in 2010. With the 2012 verdict, the Hsichih trio meets the condition of the new criminal legislation, and the case is concluded.&lt;ref name="中央社"&gt;中央社，蘇建和案 3人無罪定讞, Aug 31, 2011 http://www.cna.com.tw/News/FirstNews/201208310010.aspx "本案高等法院於民國92年1月間再審首次判決無罪，99年11月間再更二審判決無罪，今天再更三審判決無罪，符合速審法第8條規定，全案定讞。" "This case was first decided non-guilty by the High Court in Jan 2003 in its first retrial, it was decided again non-guilty in its second retrial in Nov 2010. Today it is decided non-guilty in the third retrial. Hence it meets the requirement of Article 8 of the 'Speed Trial Act.' This case is concluded."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lu Cheng's case===
In December 1997, Tainan native Lu Cheng (盧正), an unemployed former policeman, was charged with the kidnapping and murder of a local woman, Chan Chun-tzu (詹春子), who along with her husband were both former high school classmates of Lu's. The Supreme Court of the Republic of China sentenced Lu to death in June 2000 but his family noted several suspicious points:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jrf.org.tw/reform/file_4_4a.htm 司改會觀察監督－檔案追蹤－890802盧正案新聞稿&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830061950/http://www.jrf.org.tw/reform/file_4_4a.htm |date=August 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Like the Hsichih Trio, Lu Cheng had been tortured by police and was forced into making a confession.
*The judges intentionally ignored his [[alibi]] that he had been with his young niece at the time of the murder.
*The kidnapper phoned the victim's husband during the crime. If Lu Cheng had committed the kidnapping, the victim's husband should have been able to identify his voice.
*The verdict stated that Lu Cheng had used his shoelaces to strangle the victim. However, the [[autopsy]] showed the victim's strangulation burns did not match Lu's shoelaces.

Despite these suspicious points, Minister of Justice [[Chen Ding-nan]] ordered Lu Cheng's execution on September 7, 2000, just one day before that year's [[Mid-Autumn Festival]]. It was rumored that Lu Cheng remained conscious after receiving five anesthetic injections at 3:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., so the officials had to shoot him while he was conscious and his eyes remained opened after his death. Lu Cheng's family continues to protest but there has been no concrete official response to date.

===Chiang Kuo-ching's case===
President [[Ma Ying-jeou]] and the Ministry of National Defense have made a public apology to the family of former Air Force Pvt. Chiang Kuo-ching (江國慶) for his wrongful execution in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;The China Post, Ma apologizes to the public over wrongful execution 1 February 2011 http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2011/02/01/289853/p1/Ma-apologizes.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Chiang was arrested for the 1996 rape and murder of a five-year-old girl. He was tortured into making a false confession by military counterintelligence. After reopening the case, investigators arrested Hsu Rong-chou, who had a record of sexual abuses, on 28 January 2011. Hsu then confessed to the crime. The officials who handled the original investigation were protected from prosecution by the statute of limitations for public employees.&lt;ref&gt;The China Post, Officials in Chiang case may escape punishment 1 February 2011 http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2011/02/01/289837/Officials-in.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious attitudes==

===Buddhist===
Taiwan's major Buddhist authorities hold diverse interpretations of what can be considered a "Buddhist perspective" to capital punishment:
* [[Fo Guang Shan]] Buddhist Order holds that the abolishment of capital punishment "is not necessary", and that it corresponds to the laws of cause and effect in Buddhism.&lt;ref name="humbud"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dong|first1=Yung|title=An Overview of Social Well-being in Humanistic Buddhism|journal=Hsi Lai Journal of Humanistic Buddhism|date=2004|volume=5|url=http://journal.uwest.edu/index.php/hljhb/article/view/101/187|accessdate=7 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804115528/http://journal.uwest.edu/index.php/hljhb/article/view/101/187|archive-date=2016-08-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sheng Yen|Master Sheng Yen]], founder of the [[Dharma Drum Mountain]], said: "Now, should capital punishment be abolished? As a Dharma master, of course I hope it will be abolished". He taught that there are no unchangingly bad people, and all sentient beings can become Buddhas. He argued that abolishing capital punishment should take two paths: legally decrease the number of death sentences, and promote religious education so as to prevent crime.&lt;ref name="gddtv"&gt;{{cite web|title=Should we abolish capital punishment?(GDD-408, Master Sheng Yen)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gud4vbxRQM|website=Master Sheng Yen YouTube channel|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tzu Chi]] Buddhist Master and [[Hsuan Chuang University]] College of Social Sciences Dean Shih Chao-hui (釋昭慧) has written: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...the Buddha has stated very clearly that 'no killing' is the first rule of the five basic moral ethics (the Five Precepts). It is absolutely impossible for Buddha to speak favorably of 'solving problems through killing'. Killings will only lead to more killings...it is not necessary for the victims and their family members to take revenge personally，and no third parties are needed to join into the network of killing. Their own karma will not let them run away.&lt;ref name="chaohui"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shih|first1=Chao-hui|title=The Buddhist View about the Abolishment of Death Penalty|journal=Monthly Review of Philosophy and Culture|date=2003-01-01|volume=30|issue=1|pages=133–144|url=http://buddhism.lib.ntu.edu.tw/BDLM/toModule.do?prefix=/search&amp;page=/search_detail.jsp?seq=354843}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Political attitudes==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
The [[Kuomintang]], [[New Party (Taiwan)|New Party]] and [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]] strongly support the use of capital punishment.

The [[Democratic Progressive Party]] has both proponents and opponents of capital punishment, however the platform of the DPP state that they are discussing possibility of abolition of capital punishment.

Generally, the [[New Power Party]] and the [[Green Party Taiwan]] are in favour of abolition of capital punishment.

During the [[Republic of China (Taiwan) 9-13 July 2002 state visit to the United States of America]], Attorney General of the United States of America [[John Ashcroft]] announced that the Taiwanese Minister of Justice [[Chen Ding-nan]] had made a policy statement of moving towards abolishing the death penalty using a phased approach.&lt;ref name="陳定南晤美司法部長"&gt;{{cite news

==Temporary Moratorium between 2006 and 2009==
These controversial cases apparently influenced the local judicial system.

When the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] first governed in 2000, the DPP government had influenced their policies that they were moving forward to abolish the death penalty. [[Chen Ding-nan]], the first Minister of Justice of the DPP, publicly announced his intention to abolish the death penalty in May 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epochtimes.com/b5/1/5/17/n89550.htm|title=陳定南將全力推動廢除死刑|work=大紀元 www.epochtimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his views were backed by President [[Chen Shui-bian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epochtimes.com.au/b5/6/6/14/n1351147.htm 陳水扁：廢除死刑 台灣努力目標&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604130300/http://www.epochtimes.com.au/b5/6/6/14/n1351147.htm |date=June 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gov.tw/EBOOKS/TWANNUAL/show_book.php?path=8_012_027{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the right to abolish death penalty is held by the [[Legislative Yuan]] which is currently dominated by the opposing [[Pan-blue coalition]], as well as being more conservative on this issue, the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] government forced a [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] by not signing death warrants except for serious and noncontroversial cases. As a result, the number of executions dropped significantly from 2002. In an October 2006 interview, Chen Ding-nan's successor Shih Mao-lin (施茂林) said he would not sign any [[execution warrant|death warrants]] for the 19 defendants who had already been sentenced to death by the Supreme Court, because their cases were still being reviewed inside the Ministry.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.sina.com.tw/society/udn/tw/2006-10-12/015212130360.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;
These conditions remained in effect until Chen Shui-bian's tenure expired on May 20, 2008.

In May 2008, Chen Shui-bian's successor [[Ma Ying-jeou]] nominated [[Wang Ching-feng]] as the Minister of Justice. Wang opposed capital punishment and delayed every case delivered to the Minister's Office. Until March 2010, a total of 44 prisoners given death sentences by the Supreme Court were detained by the Ministry but Wang still publicly announced her strong opposition to capital punishment during media interviews. This caused controversy and the consensus suddenly broke after entertainer [[Pai Bing-bing]] (whose daughter [[Pai Hsiao-yen]] was kidnapped and murdered in 1997) held a high-profile protest against Wang. Wang, who originally refused to step down, bowed to social pressure and resigned on March 11, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2010/03/12/247935/Wang-Ching-feng.htm Wang Ching-feng quits]&lt;/ref&gt; Wang's successor Tseng Yung-Fu (曾勇夫) promised premier [[Wu Den-yih]] that he would resume executions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.tw/?action-viewnews-itemid-7320|title=ChinaDaily|work=chinadaily.com.tw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306064024/http://www.chinadaily.com.tw/?action-viewnews-itemid-7320|archivedate=2012-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Execution Resumed==
On April 30, 2010, Justice Minister [[Tseng Yung-fu]] ordered 4 executions, ending the four-year moratorium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theasianpost.com/2010/04/30/taiwan-puts-four-to-death-in-first-executions-since-2005-afp/ Taiwan puts four to death in first executions since 2005 (AFP)]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:zh:台灣死刑犯列表]]&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 1, 2018, 34 executions have been carried out since then.

The '''Care Quality Commission''' ('''CQC''') is an executive [[non-departmental public body]] of the [[Department of Health and Social Care (United Kingdom)|Department of Health and Social Care]] of the [[United Kingdom]].  It was established in 2009 to regulate and inspect health and social care services in England.

It was formed from three predecessor organisations:
* the [[Healthcare Commission]]
* the [[Commission for Social Care Inspection]]
* the [[Mental Health Act Commission]]

The CQC's stated role is to make sure that hospitals, care homes, dental and general practices and other care services in England provide people with safe, effective and high-quality care, and to encourage them to improve. It carries out this role through checks it carries out during the registration process all new care services must complete, inspections and monitoring of a range of data sources that can indicate problems with services.

Part of the commission's remit is protecting the interests of people whose rights have been restricted under the [[Mental Health Act 1983|Mental Health Act]].

==History==
Until 31 March 2009, regulation of health and adult social care in England was carried out by the [[Healthcare Commission]] and the [[Commission for Social Care Inspection]].  The [[Mental Health Act Commission]] had monitoring functions with regard to the operation of the [[Mental Health Act 1983]].

The commission was established as a single, integrated regulator for England's health and adult social care services by the [[Health and Social Care Act 2008]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2008/ukpga_20080014_en_1 |title=Office of Public Sector Information – Health and Social Care Act 2008 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=2011-05-27 |accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2008/pdf/ukpga_20080014_en.pdf |title=Office of Public Sector Information – Health and Social Care Act 2008 (pdf) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pressrelease | url = http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Legislation/Actsandbills/HealthandSocialCareBill/DH_080438 | publisher = [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] | date = 2007-11-16 | accessdate = 2008-09-16 | title = Care Quality Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; to replace these three bodies. The Commission was created in shadow form on 1 October 2008 and began operating on 1 April 2009.

==Operations==
In August 2013 the CQC stated that it was finding it difficult to meet their inspection target of GP practices and had therefore drafted in 'bank' inspectors and authorised staff overtime to deal with the backlog.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/your-practice/practice-topics/regulation/fifth-of-gp-practices-inspected-by-the-cqc-found-to-be-non-compliant/20004027.article|title=Fifth of GP practices inspected by the CQC found to be 'non-compliant'|work=Pulse Today|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014 Field announced that the Commission was going to begin inspecting health systems across whole geographical areas from 2015, including social care and [[NHS 111]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CQC to inspect whole health systems|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/topics/nhs-regulation-and-inspection/cqc-to-inspect-whole-health-systems/5075504.article#.VE4gUCvraKI|accessdate=27 October 2014|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are suggestions that it could inspect [[clinical commissioning group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CQC to assess whole health systems|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/primary-care/cqc-to-assess-whole-health-systems/5089538.article#.VhIzIkpfZ1A|accessdate=5 October 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behan admitted in March 2015 that the Commission would not be able to inspect all acute trusts before the end of 2015 as it had intended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CQC will miss own inspection deadlines, regulator admits|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/cqc-will-miss-own-inspection-deadlines-regulator-admits/5083618.article#.VRbW9vmsVyU|accessdate=28 March 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2015 it reported that it was missing its targets for following up on the safeguarding information it received that might indicate that patients are at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CQC falls short in responding to safeguarding alerts|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/cqc-falls-short-in-responding-to-safeguarding-alerts/5082754.article#.VRbZJfmsVyU|accessdate=28 March 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also said the CQC would update its oversight in line with the growth of new provider models and would begin looking at care quality along pathways to a greater degree and, for the first time, across localities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CQC unveils new approach to regulating forward view care models|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/exclusive-cqc-unveils-new-approach-to-regulating-forward-view-care-models/5083137.article#.VSGdsPnF9yU|accessdate=5 April 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation failed to meet its inspection targets during the second quarter of 2015–16.  70% of adult social care inspections had been undertaken and 61% of primary medical services.  An exception to this was inspections of hospital acute services where targets were slightly exceeded, an additional 2 inspections having been made in this sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/Health-Care-News/slumping-productivity-hits-cqc-inspection-regime|title=Slumping productivity hits CQC inspection regime|website=www.nationalhealthexecutive.com|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015 the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) was critical of the regulator, and said that it was "behind where it should be, six years after it was established”.  Meg Hillier MP, the chair of the PAC, noted that reports prepared by the CQC contained many errors; one foundation trust said that their staff had found more than 200 errors in a draft CQC report.  Hillier said "The fact these errors were picked up offers some reassurance, but this is clearly unacceptable from a public body in which taxpayers are placing their trust.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/Health-Care-News/cqc-not-an-effective-regulator-and-unprepared-for-2016-duties--pac|title=CQC ‘not an effective regulator’ and unprepared for 2016 duties – PAC|website=www.nationalhealthexecutive.com|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016 the commission issued an apology after admitting that up to 500 Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) certificates submitted by applicants to become registered managers and providers had been lost during a planned office refurbishment; a locked filing cabinet had been incorrectly marked up to be taken away and destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/your-practice/regulation/gps-details-included-in-500-confidential-records-lost-by-cqc/20032423.fullarticle |title=GPs' details included in 500 confidential records lost by CQC |first=Alex |last=Matthews-King |work=Pulse |date=29 July 2016 |accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period of August 2016 to January 2017 the CQC sent questionnaires to inpatients of NHS hospitals who had been service users in the month of July 2016.  77,850 surveys were sent out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wirralglobe.co.uk/news/15346896.Patients_rate_Clatterbridge_Cancer_Centre_one_of__best__hospitals_in_the_country/|title=Patients rate Clatterbridge Cancer Centre one of 'best' hospitals in the country|website=Wirral Globe|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016 a briefing paper issued by the organisation stated that no directorate was meeting objectives for producing reports on time.  Of services which had been inspected over half had not improved their rating when re-inspected, with 45% staying at the same rating and 10% having a lower rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/Health-Care-News/cqc-to-bring-in-external-consultants-in-january-as-all-inspections-still-behind-target|title=CQC to bring in external consultants as inspections still behind target|website=www.nationalhealthexecutive.com|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the cyber attacks on NHS systems in May 2017 it was announced that the CQC will be asking probing questions to assess data security as part of its inspection process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/2c4d7474-398a-11e7-821a-6027b8a20f23|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Grenfell Tower fire in June 2017 letters were sent to around 17,000 care homes, hospitals and hospices requesting that they review fire safety processes, paying particular attention to the safety of service users who were more vulnerable due to mobility issues or learning disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/grenfell-tower-fire-latest-17000-care-homes-hospitals-hospices-safety-checks-a7810486.html|title=17,000 hospitals and care homes ordered to carry out fire safety reviews|date=2017-06-27|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018 the Public Accounts Committee reported that although the regulator had "improved significantly" there was "no room for complacency" in the organisation which had “persistent weaknesses and looming challenges”. Whilst there had been improvements in the timeliness of hospital inspection reports since 2015, only 25% of reports on hospitals where less than 3 services were inspected were published within the target of 50 days.  It was intended that 90% of reports should meet the target.  The PAC also noted that GPs had felt burdened by the CQC's regulation practices.  In response David Behan stated that he accepted the committee's recommendations and did not underestimate the task at hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=PAC: Health regulator has ‘persistent weaknesses’ |url=https://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2018/03/pac-health-regulator-has-persistent-weaknesses |accessdate=10 November 2018 |work=Public Finance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018 the CQC stated that 96 safeguarding concerns had not been passed on to local authorities over the last 12 months. Andrea Sutcliffe, acting chief executive of the CQC said that an urgent review was carried out when the issue was discovered and it was found that "none of these referrals contained information about immediate risk of severe harm to people". Sutcliffe apologised for the error and said an independent investigation "will assist us in ensuring we improve our systems to avoid something like this happening again".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CQC launches investigation after referrals blunder |url=https://www.digitalhealth.net/2018/07/cqc-launches-investigation-after-referrals-blunder/ |accessdate=10 November 2018 |work=Digital Health |date=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 2018 CQC's Chief Executive Ian Trenholm stated that he wanted to make the information held by the organisation more widely available to the public and that he also intended to make CQC an easier organisation to do business with and a better place to work. A chief digital officer was to be appointed as part of this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Shaun Lintern |title=CQC data to be open to public, promises new chief |url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/policy-and-regulation/cqc-data-to-be-open-to-public-promises-new-chief/7023698.article |accessdate=10 November 2018 |work=Health Service Journal |date=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hospital inspections==

===Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust===
In November 2009 [[Barbara Young, Baroness Young of Old Scone|Barbara Young]], then the CQC chair, resigned from the commission when a report detailing poor standards at [[Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust]] was leaked to the media. The report found that "hundreds of people had died needlessly due to appalling standards of care."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Baroness Young, health watchdog chief, to stand down |date=4 December 2009 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/6730920/Baroness-Young-health-watchdog-chief-to-stand-down.html |accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One month earlier the commission had rated the quality of care at the hospital as "good."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Taskforce sent in to raise standards at Essex NHS trust |date=26 November 2009 |work=[[BBC News]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8381118.stm |accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=NHS watchdog chief Barbara Young quits after Essex hospital furore |first=Denis |last=Campbell |date=4 December 2009 |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/dec/04/cqc-barbara-young-quits-hospitals-essex|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grant Thornton report===
{{main|Furness General Hospital scandal}}
In August 2012 chief executive [[David Behan]] commissioned a report by management consultants [[Grant Thornton]].&lt;ref name="dominiczak"&gt;{{Cite news|title=NHS Watchdog accused of hospital 'cover-up' still not fit for purpose, chairman admits |first=Peter |last=Dominiczak |date=19 June 2013 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/10129223/Watchdog-accused-of-hospital-cover-up-still-not-fit-for-purpose-chairman-admits.html |accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report examined the CQC's response to complaints about baby and maternal deaths and injuries at [[Furness General Hospital]] in [[Barrow-in-Furness|Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria]] and was instigated by a complaint from a member of the public and "an allegation of a "cover-up" submitted by a [[whistleblower]] at CQC."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Care Quality Commission re: Project Ambrose |work=Care Quality Commission |date=14 June 2013 |url=http://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/media/documents/grant_thornton_uk_llp_morecambe_bay.pdf |accessdate=19 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130717143550/http://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/media/documents/grant_thornton_uk_llp_morecambe_bay.pdf |archivedate=17 July 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite news|date=19 June 2013 |title=Healthcare regulator CQC 'may have covered up failings' |work=[[BBC News]] |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-22949211 |accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published on 19 June 2013.&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;{{Cite news|title=NHS watchdog covered-up scandal at hospital where eight babies died of neglect |first=Charlie |last=Cooper |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/nhs-watchdog-coveredup-scandal-at-hospital-where-eight-babies-died-of-neglect-8664224.html |accessdate=19 June 2013 |date=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the findings, the CQC was "accused of quashing an internal review that uncovered weaknesses in its processes" and had allegedly "deleted the review of their failure to act on concerns about University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust." One CQC employee claimed that he was instructed by a senior manager "to destroy his review because it would expose the regulator to public criticism."&lt;ref name=Cooper/&gt; The report concluded: "We think that the information contained in the [deleted] report was sufficiently important that the deliberate failure to provide it could properly be characterised as a '[[cover-up]]'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Cover-up over hospital scandal |first=Laura |last=Donnelly |date=18 Jun 2013 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/10128886/Cover-up-over-hospital-scandal.html |accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Prior, who joined the commission as chairman in January 2013, responded that the organisation's previous management had been "totally dysfunctional" and admitted that the organisation was "not fit for purpose."&lt;ref name="siddique"&gt;{{Cite news|title=NHS regulator exposed as 'not fit for purpose' by maternity deaths |first=Haroon |last=Siddique |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |date=19 June 2013 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jun/19/nhs-regulator-cqc-cover-up-morecambe-bay |accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 June 2013, Behan and Prior agreed to release the names of previously redacted senior managers within the Grant Thornton report, who it is alleged had suppressed the internal CQC report. The people named were former CQC Chief Executive Cynthia Bower, deputy CEO Jill Finney and media manager Anna Jefferson. All were reportedly present at a meeting where deletion of a critical report was allegedly discussed. Bower and Jefferson immediately denied being involved in a cover-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-22992625|title=NHS 'cover-up' names revealed by CQC|first=Nick|last=Triggle|work=[[BBC News]]|date=20 June 2013|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper reported on 19 June 2013 that [[Tim Farron]] MP had written to the [[Metropolitan Police]] asking them to investigate the alleged cover-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Randeep Ramesh |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jun/19/met-nhs-regulator-morecambe-farron |title=Met asked to investigate NHS regulator after Morecambe Bay trust report|publisher=Guardian |date=2013-06-19 |accessdate=2013-06-24 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following an investigation, CQC found that Jefferson had not been party to any alleged 'delete' instruction. Jefferson was cleared of any wrong-doing and CQC apologised for the distress caused by the allegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24390570|title=CQC official Anna Jefferson cleared over 'cover-up'|work=BBC News|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finney subsequently started litigation seeking at least £1.3 million libel damages from the CQC on the basis that the CQC’s current chair David Prior and chief executive David Behan abused their power and acted maliciously in publishing allegations that she ordered a “cover-up” of its failings. The Grant Thornton report said it was “more likely than not” that Ms Finney had ordered the deletion of an internal report by Louise Dineley, the CQC’s head of regulatory risk.  The CQC started litigation against Grant Thornton claiming a contribution towards any “damages, interests and/or costs” incurred in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CQC drags Grant Thornton into libel court case|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/workforce/cqc-drags-grant-thornton-into-libel-court-case/5073296.article#.U_4_o_ldUk4|publisher=Health Service Journal|accessdate=27 August 2014|date=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social care==
Residential establishments, unlike hospitals, can easily be closed, or sold, and reopened with a new identity.  [[Private Eye]] reported in November 2015 that most of the 34 homes closed under [[Cynthia Bower]] after failing their inspection later reopened with a new name or under new ownership, but with similar problems.  [[Compassion in Care]] told the magazine that if a home changed name or ownership it was then listed by the CQC as "new services" and "uninspected" by the CQC, and there was no link to reports on the same establishment under different ownership, even if the new owners were linked to the previous owners, and there was no follow up inspection if problems had been identified.  They had found 152 homes reregistered as new, when they had only changed owner or name.  The Commission had identified safety concerns in more than 40% of the homes it had inspected, and 10% were rated as inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sleeping Watchdog|issue=1405|publisher=Private Eye|date=13 November 2015|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016 it was reported that 44% of care homes in the South East inspected over an 18 month period were rated as inadequate or requiring improvement.  Only 0.9% of the 1200 homes inspected were rated as outstanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36149910|title=Care home resident 'month without bath'|date=2016-04-28|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016 the CQC said that 40% of nursing homes in the country were rated as "requiring improvement" or "inadequate".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-37496349|title=Nursing homes 'closing each week'|last=Atkinson|first=Carolyn|date=2016-09-28|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a legal requirement for homes to clearly display their CQC ratings on their websites but a July 2017 survey carried out by Which? found that 27% of care homes surveyed either completely failed to display them or placed them where they were very difficult to find.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://inews.co.uk/essentials/lifestyle/money/father-care-home-died-care-home-refused-refund-unspent-fees/|title=When my father died, his care home refused to refund any unspent fees – iNews|date=2017-07-19|work=iNews|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 2018 the CQC rated almost 3,000 out of 14,975 care homes in England as inadequate or needing improvement.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-45194202&lt;/ref&gt;

The care home Horncastle House was closed by CQC in September 2018 as an urgent enforcement action to protect residents. The owner Sussex Healthcare stated that they were disappointed by the CQC's decision to close the service and did not accept the allegations which had led to the closure.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.carehomeprofessional.com/residents-told-leave-immediately-sussex-care-home-shut/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Winterbourne View===
{{main|Winterbourne View hospital abuse}}
Winterbourne View was a private hospital at [[Hambrook]], [[South Gloucestershire]], owned and operated by Castlebeck. It was exposed in a ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' investigation into [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[psychological abuse]] suffered by people with [[learning disabilities]] and [[challenging behaviour]], first broadcast in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=1 June 2011 |title=Four arrests after patient abuse caught on film |work=[[BBC News]] |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13548222 |accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One senior nurse had reported his concerns directly to CQC, but his complaint was not taken up.&lt;ref name="systematic"&gt;{{cite news |date=18 July 2011 |title=Winterbourne View 'failed to protect people' |work=[[BBC News]] |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-14181646 |accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public funded hospital was shut down as a result of the abuse that took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Winterbourne View 'abuse' hospital closes on Friday |work=[[BBC News]] |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-13891855 |date=24 June 2011 |accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cynthia Bower]], then the chief executive of the commission, resigned ahead of a critical government report in which Winterbourne View was cited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS watchdog chief Cynthia Bower resigns |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/feb/23/nhs-watchdog-cynthia-bower-resigns |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |first=Denis |last=Campbell|date=23 February 2013 |accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ash Court===
Ash Court is a residential [[nursing home]] for the elderly in London, operated by [[Forest Healthcare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Abuse secretly filmed in 'excellent' London care home |date=23 April 2012 |work=[[BBC News]] |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17810136 |accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2012 [[hidden camera]] footage was broadcast in a BBC ''Panorama'' exposé which showed an elderly woman being physically assaulted at Ash Court by a male carer and mistreated by four others. The standard of care at the nursing home had been rated "excellent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=23 April 2012 |title=Regulator criticised after woman assaulted in care home |work=[[BBC News]] |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-17777113 |accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Stafford hospital investigator berates CQC regulator |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/may/01/stafford-hospital-investigator-berates-cqc-regulator |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |first=John |last=Carvel |date=1 May 2012 |accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victim was an 81-year-old woman suffering [[Alzheimer's disease]] and severe [[arthritis]]. Although the commission's primary function is to enforce national standards including safeguarding the vulnerable and "enabling them to live free from harm, abuse and neglect" the CQC responded by stating that they "should not be criticised for failing to protect people from harm" and could not be expected to spot abuse "which often takes place behind closed doors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The National Standards: Safeguarding people |work=Care Quality Commission |url=http://www.cqc.org.uk/public/what-are-standards/safeguarding-people |accessdate=21 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623232508/http://www.cqc.org.uk/public/what-are-standards/safeguarding-people |archivedate=23 June 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.camdennewjournal.com/news/2012/apr/ash-court-abuse-leads-calls-public-inquiry-care-watchdog|title=Ash Court abuse leads to calls for public inquiry into care watchdog {{!}} Camden New Journal|last=|first=|date=2016-03-04|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030117/http://www.camdennewjournal.com/news/2012/apr/ash-court-abuse-leads-calls-public-inquiry-care-watchdog|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Primary care==
In January 2015 the Commission for the first time took action in respect of primary care.  Three GP practices were put into special measures after unsatisfactory inspection results:  Priory Avenue Surgery in [[Reading, Berkshire]]; Dr Michael Florin’s surgery in [[Sale, Greater Manchester]]; and Dr Srinivas Dharmana’s family and general practice in [[Walton, Liverpool|Walton]], Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Three GP surgeries put into special measures over patient safety concerns|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jan/22/three-gp-surgeries-special-measures-patient-safety-concerns?CMP=twt_gu|accessdate=22 January 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Priory Avenue Surgery was taken out of the special measures category later in 2015; it  was rated "good" for being caring and "requires improvement" for being safe, effective, responsive and well led.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-34341290|title=GP surgery out of special measures|date=2015-09-24|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CQC considered cancelling the registration of Dharmana’s Family and General Practice, which would have forced it to close.  This did not come about as Dr Dharmana voluntarily closed the service in December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/walton-gp-surgery-shut-after-10220365|title=Liverpool GP surgery to shut due to untrained staff and lack of vital equipment|last=Taylor|first=Joshua|date=2015-10-08|work=liverpoolecho|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016 the CQC's annual report stated that around 800,000 patients were registered with a GP practice assessed as inadequate on safety grounds by their inspectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/13/social-care-cuts-take-english-service-to-tipping-point-regulator-warns|title=Social care cuts take English service to tipping point, regulator warns|last=Campbell|first=Denis|date=2016-10-12|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By February 2017 the CQC had completed inspections of all GP practices which were registered before 1 October 2014.  This amounted to more than 8,000 inspections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/your-practice/regulation/cqc-completes-its-first-round-of-gp-practice-inspections/20033893.article|title=CQC completes its first round of GP practice inspections|work=Pulse Today|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017 the report State of Care in General Practice, 2014–2017 was published.  It stated that 90% of practices were rated 'good' or 'outstanding'.    The report also said that a causal relationship between levels of NHS funding and ratings had not been found, acknowledging that this is "a complex area that may benefit from further work."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/your-practice/regulation/practice-ratings-not-linked-to-lack-of-funding-claims-cqc/20035322.article|title=Practice ratings 'not linked' to lack of funding, claims CQC|work=Pulse Today|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018 it was announced that the CQC would begin to inspect independent doctors providing online services.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/independent-doctors-to-be-rated-by-the-care-quality-commission&lt;/ref&gt;

The CQC's State of Care report for 2017/18 found that 91% of GP practices were rated as Good and  5% Outstanding.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gponline.com/cqc-rates-96-practices-good-outstanding-despite-rising-pressure/article/1495774&lt;/ref&gt;

==Staffing==

In a report to the audit committee revealed by the [[Health Service Journal]] in July 2014 it was reported that the Commission had employed 134 applicants in 2012 who “failed some or all of its recruitment activities”. Of that group 121 were still in post.  The report said: “This in essence implies that our regulatory judgments may be impaired as we have not always appointed staff with the core competencies required to do the job properly, and they may not have received appropriate training to bring them up to the standard required.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CQC hired inspectors who failed recruitment criteria in 'flawed' process|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/exclusive-cqc-hired-inspectors-who-failed-recruitment-criteria-in-flawed-process/5072746.article#.U_5MXvldUk4|accessdate=27 August 2014|work=Health Service Journal|date=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same month the chief executive David Behan said that recruiting extra inspectors was taking longer than expected due to the "high standards" set for new recruits.  As a result some teams were operating at 50% capacity.  In response to this situation the number of inspections scheduled for the second half of 2014 was scaled back.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsj.co.uk/home/cqc-to-slow-inspections-amid-staff-pressures/5073416.fullarticle]&lt;/ref&gt;

A report of the CQC board in December 2014 showed the organisation had 852 full-time equivalent inspectors in post but a target of 1,411 by December 2015 – the number needed to “discharge the commitments that we’ve made in our business plan”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CQC needs to increase inspection workforce by 66pc in one year|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/cqc-needs-to-increase-inspection-workforce-by-66pc-in-one-year/5077798.article#.VM-JfZ2sVyU|accessdate=2 February 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The budget for 2015/6 was £249 million, but is to be reduced to £236 million for 2016/7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CQC's budget cut further|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/topics/policy-and-regulation/cqcs-budget-cut-further/7004170.article|accessdate=2 May 2016|publisher=Health Service JOurnal|date=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is anticipated that by 2019/20 the budget will be £217 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/20160523_strategy_16-21_strategy_final_web_01.pdf |title=Strategy paper|website=cqc.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had a budget of £1.1 million for “travel and subsistence” for hospital inspections in 2014–15, but actually spent £4.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hospital inspections exceeded hotel and travel budget by four times|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/topics/policy-and-regulation/exclusive-hospital-inspections-exceeded-hotel-and-travel-budget-by-four-times/7000189.article|accessdate=19 December 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to a Freedom of information request in November 2015 it was stated that CQC have a database support contract with Computacenter which costs approximately £700,000 per annum; the contract expires in September 2016 with the option of a 1 year extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/299956/response/736240/attach/html/3/20151120%20FOIA%20Response%20CQC%20IAT%201516%200562.doc.html|title=20151120 FOIA Response CQC IAT 1516 0562.doc|website=www.whatdotheyknow.com|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cleo Spurlock Wallace''' (July 29, 1914 - August 26, 1985) was an American [[speech therapy|speech therapist]] born in [[Garo, Colorado]].

In 1933, Spurlock was one of the first six recipients of four-year scholarships to the [[University of Denver]]; she graduated in 1937. That same year, she married investment broker Thomas Wallace.

She subsequently earned a [[Rockefeller Foundation]] Teaching Fellowship to the University of Denver, where she received a master's degree in speech pathology in 1943.

Wallace then began teaching high school, where she received her first referral from a local physician. She worked with the child after school in her home; before long, she began treating other children with speech and language disorders. In 1948, to meet the needs of her growing clientele, she purchased two buildings with the help of businessman Henry Winter&lt;ref name="Penrose Library"&gt;[http://library.du.edu/site/ Penrose Library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601012123/http://library.du.edu/site/ |date=2010-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and founded Wallace Village for Children, a nonprofit organization. When her husband died that same year, she turned all of her attention to her work. She paid one dollar for a five-year lease on a building at 4414 Logan Street, and moved in with five teachers and thirty students.

By 1954, the Wallace Village for Children was the beneficiary of community support, and with local assistance, the organization purchased {{convert|84|acre|m2}} at 100th Avenue and Wadsworth, the site of today’s Westminster Campus. At that time, residential services were added to the outpatient and day treatment programs. In 1974, Wallace retired, but remained actively involved until her death in 1985. In 1986, the organization’s name was changed to the Cleo Wallace Center and later to Devereux Cleo Wallace after its affiliation with the Devereux Foundation.

Wallace received numerous awards during her lifetime related to her work with children with disabilities.  These awards included the [[Evans Award]] from the University of Denver Alumni Association, representing the highest honor awarded by the Alumni Association.  She also received an appointment to the [[White House]] Conference on Services for Handicapped Children, and a presidential appointment to the National Advisory of Neurological Diseases and Stroke Council.&lt;ref name="Penrose Library"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3435">'''Concomitant drugs''' are two or more [[drug]]s used or given at or almost at the same time (one after the other, on the same day, etc.). The term has two contextual uses: as used in [[medicine]] or as used in [[drug abuse]].

== Concomitant drugs in medicine ==
This designation is used when medicinal drugs are given either at the same time or almost at the same time. This is often the case in medicine.

===First example===
Chemotherapy for cancer applies as an example. The standard of care (sometimes also called the "gold standard") for the adjuvant treatment of stage III colon cancer is the FOLFOX chemotherapy protocol (used in Europe, Japan, Canada, and Australia) and respectively the FLOX chemotherapy protocol (used in the USA). These 2 chemotherapy protocols are very similar in principle. Both consist of 3 medicinal drugs: a) Leucovorin (= folinic acid = calcium folinate), b) 5-Fluorouracil (= 5-FU), and c) Oxaliplatin. Since these 3 medicinal drugs are "concomitant" to each other, such a constellation is called "concomitant drugs".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/HPI/ChemotherapyProtocols/default.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second example===
Contrast imaging in medicine is another example. These are imaging procedures in medicine that are performed after giving the patient an iodinated contrast medium (e.g. different types of contrast X-rays, CTs, MRIs). It is well known that such iodinated contrast media can lead to acute allergies in some patients. They may also lead to kidney damage. If the patient is receiving a "concomitant" medicinal drug (prescribed to the patient by another physician), and the radiologist performing the imaging procedure is unaware of this, potentially harmful side-effects can occur and increase the risk of contrast medium-induced nephropathy (i.e. increase the risk of damage to the kidneys). In general, radiologists carefully ask their patients about other medicinal drugs they are "concomitantly" taking before the imaging procedure. Often, they monitor the kidney function and the hydration status of their patients during the imaging procedure, especially whenever a concomitant drug (that is harmful to the kidney) is being used.&lt;ref&gt;Pannu N, Wiebe N, Tonelli M; Alberta Kidney Disease Network. Prophylaxis strategies for contrast-induced nephropathy. JAMA. 2006 Jun 21;295(23):2765-79. Review.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concomitant drugs in drug abuse ==
If a drug abuser ingests or misuses two or more drugs, either at the same time or almost at the same time, this is also called "concomitant drugs".

===Example===
Whether concomitant drug abuse leads to an increased number of deaths was scientifically analysed in Sheffield, UK.&lt;ref name ="Sheffield" /&gt; The researchers wanted to find out whether concomitant drug abuse (i.e. an opiate plus another drug of misuse) leads to an increased number of acute accidental opiate-related deaths. The authors showed that at least in the Sheffield area, intravenous (IV) administration of an opiate is the most consistent factor associated with drug abuse deaths. The co-administration of a concomitant drug of misuse appeared to be a feature rather than a risk factor per se in such deaths.&lt;ref name ="Sheffield"&gt;Oliver P, Keen J. Concomitant drugs of misuse and drug using behaviours associated with fatal opiate-related poisonings in Sheffield, UK, 1997-2000. Addiction. 2003 Feb;98(2):191-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3895">'''Control banding''' is a qualitative or semi-quantitative [[risk assessment]] and [[risk management|management]] approach to promoting [[occupational health and safety]]. It is intended to minimize worker exposures to hazardous chemicals and other risk factors in the workplace and to help small businesses by providing an easy-to-understand, practical approach to controlling hazardous exposures at work. 

The principle of control banding was first applied to dangerous chemicals, chemical mixtures, and fumes. The control banding process emphasizes the controls needed to prevent hazardous substances from causing harm to people at work. The greater the potential for harm, the greater the degree of control needed to manage the situation and make the risk “acceptable.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ctrlbanding/ |title=NIOSH Control Banding |accessdate=2007-10-15|publisher=United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A single ''control'' technology or strategy is matched with a single ''band'', or range of exposures (e.g. 1-10 milligrams per cubic meter) for a particular class of chemicals (e.g. skin irritants, reproductive hazards). 

Here is an example of four control bands developed for [[inhalation]] hazards.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Band no.
! Hazard Group
! Exposure Concentration
! Control Strategy
|-
| 1
| Skin and eye irritants
| &lt;1–10&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; dust, or &gt;50 to 500 [[Parts per million|ppm]] [[vapor]]
| General [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] and good [[industrial hygiene]] practices.
|-
| 2
| Harmful on single exposure
| &gt;0.1 to 1&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; dust or &gt;5 to 550 ppm vapor
| Local exhaust ventilation
|-
| 3
| Severely irritating and corrosive
| &gt;0.01 to 0.1&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; dust or &lt;0.5 to 5 ppm vapor
| Process enclosure, an engineering control
|-
| 4
| Very toxic on single exposure, reproductive hazard, sensitizer
| &lt;0.01&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; dust or &lt;0.5 ppm vapor
| Seek expert advice
|}

In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) has developed a comprehensive control banding model called ''COSHH Essentials'' ([[COSHH]] stands for ''control of substances hazardous to health.)''

The use of control banding strategies has become very popular in the pharmaceutical industry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Naumann, B. |title=Control Banding in the Pharmaceutical Industry |url=http://www.aioh.org.au/downloads/documents/ControlBandingBNaumann.pdf |work= |publisher= |date= |accessdate=October 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; where early stage development compounds may have little or no toxicology data.

==Limitations of Control Banding==
Control banding is not without limitations and still requires professional knowledge and experience to verify that the control measures specified have been properly installed, maintained, and used. Controls should be validated prior to use by either using substance specific industrial hygiene methods or performing surrogate monitoring.

'''Daphne Steele''' (1929–2004) was a [[Guyana|Guyanese]] [[nurse]], who in 1964 became the first [[Black people|Black]] [[Matron]] in the [[National Health Service]]. 

==Early life==
Daphne Steele was born in 1929 in the Dutch colony of [[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo]] (now part of [[Guyana]]) as the eldest of nine children.&lt;ref name="employers"/&gt; Her younger sister Carmen Steele later became better known as the actress [[Carmen Munroe]].&lt;ref name="life"/&gt; While her mother stayed at home, her father worked as a [[pharmacist]] who travelled around the colony to work.&lt;ref name="employers"&gt;{{cite web|title=BME Trailblazers in the NHS: Daphne Steele|url=http://www.nhsemployers.org/~/media/Employers/Publications/BME-trailblazers-in-the-NHS-Daphne-Steele.pdf|publisher=NHS Employers|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family were sufficiently well off to be able to afford servants to clean the family house.&lt;ref name="life"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sewell|first1=T|title="All aboard we're getting a life"|date=1998|publisher=Voice Enterprises|location=London|isbn=1872841007|pages=55-57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical career==
She underwent training in [[nursing]] and [[midwifery]] at the public hospital in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]] in 1945. She emigrated to the United Kingdom in 1951,&lt;ref name="employers"/&gt; as part of the British Government seeking to recruit people to the new [[National Health Service]] (NHS).&lt;ref name="argus"/&gt; The journey took 14 days, and she arrived in [[Plymouth]], [[Devon]]. She was surprised when a white man took her luggage for her, as in her native country, white men only worked in managerial roles.&lt;ref name="life"/&gt; Steele was placed on a fast-track scheme in [[Balham]], [[South London]], at the St. James's Hospital.&lt;ref name="employers"/&gt; She found the discipline to be akin to being in the military, which extended to the nurses' home where she lived. Steele also witnessed the [[racism]] of white colleagues and from patients, but tried to be friendly to avoid this personally. She later recalled that her Jamaican colleagues were skilled in "cussing" out particularly nasty patients.&lt;ref name="life"/&gt;

She moved to the United States in 1955, where she worked at a hospital in [[New Jersey]], before moving back to the UK in 1960 where she was stationed at [[RAF Brize Norton]]. She later moved to Manchester, where she was employed as a Deputy [[Matron]] at a [[nursing home]]. When it was announced that the home was closing,&lt;ref name="employers"/&gt; an Irish Matron suggested that Steele should also apply to become a Matron. So in 1964, she was appointed as Matron at St. Winifred's Hospital in [[Ilkley]], [[West Yorkshire]]. This was the first time that a [[Black people|Black person]] had been appointed as a Matron anywhere in the NHS.&lt;ref name="life"/&gt; The news of the appointment made news worldwide,&lt;ref name="employers"/&gt; with Steele receiving around 350 letters from well-wishers.&lt;ref name="argus"/&gt; After the hospital closed in 1971, Steele became a [[health visitor]] at [[Leeds University]].&lt;ref name="employers"/&gt;

==Later life==
Following retirement, Steele volunteered for a variety of organisations, including for [[Soroptimist International]] and became vice-president of  the Association of Guyanese Nurses and Allied Professionals (AGNAP). She was a devoted [[Methodist]].&lt;ref name="employers"/&gt; In 2001, the [[Guyanese High Commissioner to the United Kingdom]] awarded Steele a certificate in recognition of her medical achievements.&lt;ref name="argus"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-matron's work earns award from Guyana|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/8035998.Ex_matron_s_work_earns_award_from_Guyana/|accessdate=17 November 2017|work=Telegraph and Argus|date=25 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steele died in 2004. In her memory, AGNAP renamed their annual health talk in 2013 to the Daphne Steele Memorial Lecture.&lt;ref name="employers"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4179">'''Giuseppe Vincenzo Ciaccio''' (15 October 1824 in [[Catanzaro]] &amp;ndash; 15 June 1901 in [[Bologna]]) was an Italian [[anatomist]] and [[histologist]]. His name is associated with accessory [[lacrimal gland]]s known as "[[Ciaccio's glands]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mondofacto.com/facts/dictionary?Ciaccio's+glands Mondofacto Dictionary] Ciaccio glands&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1845, he earned his degree in medicine and [[surgery]] in [[Naples]], afterwards opening a medical practice in [[Catanzaro]], where in 1855 he attained the chair of theoretical surgery and [[obstetrics]] at the royal university-school. In 1860 he relocated to [[Turin]], subsequently receiving a scholarship to study and work abroad. In [[London]], he met with [[Thomas Spencer Wells]] (1818-1897) and [[Lionel Smith Beale]] (1828-1906), who was an important influence to Ciaccio in his decision to dedicate himself to [[microscopic anatomy]]. Following his stay in England, he traveled to [[Berlin]], where he attended lectures by [[Rudolf Virchow]] (1821-1902) and performed histological studies of [[Pacinian corpuscle]]s in the laboratory of [[Wilhelm Kühne]] (1837-1900).

In 1865, he was named professor of microscopic anatomy at the [[University of Naples]], and two years later served as professor of experimental [[physiology]] at the [[University of Parma]]. From 1870 he was associated with the [[University of Bologna]], working as a professor of [[comparative anatomy]] and [[histology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeno.org/Pagel-1901/A/Ciaccio,+Giuseppe+Vincenzo Pagel: Biographical Dictionary] excellent doctors of the nineteenth century. Berlin, Vienna, 1901, col 325-326.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fields of anatomy and histology, he is known for studies involving the finer structure of the [[eye]] (microscopic investigations of the [[conjunctiva]], [[cornea]] and [[Vitreous humour|vitreous]]). He also made contributions involving research of peripheral [[nerve fiber]] terminations in vertebrates (e.g. [[torpedo fish]]).

== Selected publications ==
The following are a few of Ciaccio's many publications in anatomy and histology.
* ''Intorno al finale distribuimento de' nervi nell'organo elettrico della torpedine'' (Torpedo Narke, Risso), ibid.., II (1870)., pp.&amp;nbsp;5–9 - About the final distribution of nerves in the [[Electric organ (biology)|electric organ]]s of torpedo fish.
* ''Osservazioni intorno alla struttura della congiuntiva umana'', (ibid., s.1, IV [1874], p.&amp;nbsp;469-524) - Remarks about the structure of the human [[conjunctiva]].
* ''Osservazioni intorno alla membrana del Descemet e al suo endotelio, con una descrizione anatomica dell'occhio della talpa europea'', ibid., V (1875), pp.&amp;nbsp;501–516, e 2 tavole di 20figure - Observations on the [[Descemet membrane]] and its [[endothelium]], with an anatomical description of the eye of the [[European mole]].
* ''Osservazioni istologiche intorno alla terminazione delle fibre nervose motive ne' muscoli striati delle torpedini, del topo casalingo e del ratto albino condizionati col doppio cloruro d'oro e cadmio'', ibid., IV (1882), pp.&amp;nbsp;821–830, e 2 tavole di 24figure - Observations involving motor nerve terminations in the [[striated muscle tissue|striated muscle]] of torpedo fish, etc.
* ''Della minuta fabbrica degli occhi dei Ditteri'', (ibid., s.4, VI [1884], pp.&amp;nbsp;605–660) - On the minute fabric involving the eyes of [[Diptera]].
* ''Osservazioni microscopiche intorno agli organi elettrici delle torpedini'', (ibid., s.5, VII [1899], p.&amp;nbsp;4tavole and 587-619). Microscopical observations involving the electric organs of torpedo fish.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9449">'''Global Digital Exemplar''' ('''GDE''') is a knowledge sharing platform developed by [[NHS England]]. The programme is to enable "digitally advanced"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NHS England » Global Digital Exemplars |url=https://www.england.nhs.uk/digitaltechnology/info-revolution/exemplars/ |website=www.england.nhs.uk |accessdate=8 July 2018 |date=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NHS trust]]s to share knowledge with other NHS trusts. Specifically knowledge gained during the implementation of IT systems, and especially experience from introducing [[electronic health record]] (EHR) systems. The GDE project is expected to last two to three and a half years; with the most digitally advanced trusts on the shorter time scale.&lt;ref name="NHSEblog-Nov17"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Swindells |first1=Matthew |last2=Smart |first2=Will |title=Progressing the acute Global Digital Exemplar |url=https://www.england.nhs.uk/blog/progressing-the-acute-global-digital-exemplar/ |website=www.england.nhs.uk |publisher=NHS England |accessdate=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four rounds of exemplars have been announced so far &amp;mdash; two waves of acute trust GDEs, and one wave each of ambulance trusts, and mental health trusts. In addition, eighteen acute trust "fast followers" have been partnered with the acute trusts.&lt;ref name="BJHC-Sep17"&gt;{{cite news |title=Eighteen NHS trusts confirmed as 'fast followers' to digital exemplars |journal=British Journal of Healthcare Computing |date=11 September 2017 |url=https://www.bj-hc.co.uk/eighteen-nhs-trusts-confirmed-fast-followers-digital-exemplars |accessdate=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each GDE will receive "up to £10 million" to spend on digital projects.&lt;ref name="HSJ-July17"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Heather |first1=Ben |title=Flagship digital fund finally reaches 'exemplar' trusts |journal=Health Service Journal |date=3 July 2017 |url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/technology-and-innovation/flagship-digital-fund-finally-reaches-exemplar-trusts/7019136.article |accessdate=8 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funding must be matched locally, but not necessarily in cash.&lt;ref name="NHSEblog-Nov17" /&gt;

==Acute exemplars==
The first twelve exemplars were announced in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New plans to expand the use of digital technology across the NHS|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-plans-to-expand-the-use-of-digital-technology-across-the-nhs|accessdate=2 July 2018|work=gov.uk|publisher=Department of Health and The Rt Hon Jeremy Hunt MP|ref=GDE}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second wave added another four in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stevens|first1=Laura|title=Four more acute global digital exemplars confirmed by NHS England|url=https://www.digitalhealth.net/2017/03/four-more-acute-global-digital-exemplars-confirmed-by-nhs-england/|accessdate=2 July 2018|work=Digital Health|publisher=Digital Health|date=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Harrisburg State Hospital was created as the Pennsylvania State Lunatic Hospital and Union Asylum for the Insane in 1845 to provide care for mentally ill persons throughout the [[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]]. 
[[File:Dix Museum Harrisburg PA Asylum.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.1|The Dix Museum (now closed) on the grounds]]
[[File:Beechmont Harrisburg PA Hospital.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.1|The Beechmont Building]]
The hospital was the result of the successful lobbying efforts of 19th century social reformer, [[Dorothea Dix]]. A nine-member board of trustees was empowered to appoint a superintendent, purchase land, and construct facilities near Harrisburg. This board of trustees received no compensation for their work. In 1848, the name of the hospital was changed to the Pennsylvania State Lunatic Hospital when $50,000 was appropriated to begin construction. Patients from all parts of the state would be accepted at the hospital, at the expense of the counties that they belonged; or, if able they would pay for themselves at a cost of $2.50 per week. This cost included board and medical attention. Originally the hospital only had one building which housed the administration, staff, and patients. Built in 1851, the Main Building was designed following the [[Kirkbride Plan]] which was a very popular building style during the late 19th century. The original capacity of the building was 250 patients, but was later expanded with the removal of dining rooms and the addition of the North and South Branch Buildings.

A {{convert|130|acre|adj=on}} farm was located adjacent to the hospital and provided work therapy for the patients and also enabled the hospital to be self-supporting, by growing its own food, and raising its own livestock. When the first patient was admitted on October 6, 1851, every poor district was charged a $2.00 weekly maintenance fee for the care of each indigent patient. The boarding charges for private patients were scheduled to vary between $3.00 and $10.00 based upon ability to pay. In 1869 the Board of Public Charities was created to inspect all public and voluntary charitable institutions in the Commonwealth and to report to the legislature with recommendations concerning their operation. For four decades this unpaid Board and its small staff had no authority to correct the conditions it found within state institutions. Nonetheless, by persuasion and publicity they were able to improve the quality of care in public institutions. A major objective was the removal of the insane from almshouses to the Pennsylvania State Lunatic Hospital and other state hospitals. A Committee on Lunacy was created within the Board of Public charities in 1883 to oversee the operations of these mental institutions.

The early 20th century was a time of great change for Harrisburg State Hospital. The Main Building had become old and was in need of replacement. Between the years 1893 and 1912 the hospital was rebuilt following the "Cottage Plan", which became popular at the beginning of the 20th century. At its peak the hospital consumed over {{convert|1000|acre}} and included more than 70 buildings. Designed and constructed by Pennsylvania architects [[Addison Hutton]] and [[John A. Dempwolf]] the campus and buildings were meant to represent an Italianate window. The buildings on the male and female sides of the campus mirrored each other until the addition of new buildings in the 1930s.

In 1921 the name of the hospital was changed to the Harrisburg State Hospital. Also that year, the Board of Public Charities was abolished and the Department of Public Welfare was created to administer all state hospitals. With the completion of the new "Cottage Plan" buildings, the hospital had grown considerably larger. Its patient capacity was 2,019, but at one time it held as many as 2,441 with 437 on parole. The hospital was self-sufficient, with its own farm, power plant, and stores; it became known as the "City on the Hill". During wartime there was a 50% shortage of attendants, at the lowest level of employment there were as few as one nurse to 166 patients. In June 1945 only 26 of the 92 authorized positions on the male side were filled. The manpower shortage resulted in widespread curtailment of services to both the public and patients.

Up until 1955 certain administrative responsibilities, such as the selection of the hospital Superintendent and the enactment of rules and regulations governing the hospital were vested in the Board of Trustees of the Harrisburg State Hospital. In 1955 an amendment to the Administrative Code authorized the Department of Public Welfare to assume administrative responsibilities for the Harrisburg State Hospital, relegating its Board of Trustees to specific advisory duties. This act also provided for the appointment of a Commissioner of Mental Health in the Department of Public Welfare who assumed overall responsibility for Pennsylvania's mental health program.

Like other institutions Harrisburg State Hospital's patient population began to fall in the late 20th century. This was due to new medicines being developed and finally deinstitutionalization. The hospital was finally closed on January 27, 2006. Today (2008) the hospital sits on a {{convert|200|acre|adj=on}} campus with stately buildings in a country setting, in Dauphin County, with a majority of its campus in Susquehanna Township. There are over fifty buildings still located on the campus. The former hospital facility now provides office space for many state agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Harrisburg_State_Hospital Harrisburg State Hospital - Asylum Projects]&lt;/ref&gt;

The hospital was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archiplanet.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_Lunatic_Hospital Pennsylvania State Lunatic Hospital - Archiplanet]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In film==
* The TV series ''[[Ghost Lab]]'' filmed an episode at the hospital which aired in the Fall of 2010 during the second season on the [[Discovery Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomasp94.bravejournal.com/entry/55443 City on the Hill Blog - Bravenet Blog]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The film ''[[Another Harvest Moon]]'' was filmed at the hospital and was released on August 7, 2009.
* The film, ''[[Girl, Interrupted (film)|Girl, Interrupted]]'' was filmed at the hospital as well as other various locations in and around [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]]. The hospital settings were meant to resemble those of the grounds of [[McLean Hospital]] in [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="thomas-industriesinc"&gt;[http://hsh.thomas-industriesinc.com/COTH_Media.htm City on the Hill]&lt;/ref&gt; (Note: The 'Administration' signs hanging in the car port of the Administration Building are not original to the hospital, they were created for the movie and the hospital staff left them up after the shooting was complete.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://hsh.thomas-industriesinc.com/Building_Admin.htm City on the Hill]&lt;/ref&gt;

Aaron Richardson and [[Jeffrey D. Palmer]] state: "Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has played a major role in bacterial evolution and is fairly common in certain unicellular eukaryotes. However, the prevalence and importance of HGT in the evolution of [[multicellular]] eukaryotes remain unclear."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1= Richardson, Aaron O. |author2= Palmer, Jeffrey D. |authorlink2=Jeffrey D.

Due to the increasing amount of evidence suggesting the importance of these phenomena for evolution (see [[#Importance in evolution|below]]) molecular biologists such as Peter Gogarten have described horizontal gene transfer as "A New Paradigm for Biology".&lt;ref name="gogarten"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Gogarten, Peter |year= 2000 |title= Horizontal Gene Transfer: A New Paradigm for Biology |journal= Esalen Center for Theory and Research Conference |url= http://www.esalenctr.org/display/confpage.cfm?confid=10&amp;pageid=105&amp;pgtype=1 |accessdate= 2007-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horizontal transposon transfer===

A [[transposable element]] (TE) (also called a transposon or jumping gene) is a mobile segment of DNA that can sometimes pick up a resistance gene and insert it into a plasmid or chromosome, thereby inducing horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance.&lt;ref name=Stearns/&gt;

Horizontal transposon transfer (HTT) refers to the passage of pieces of DNA that are characterized by their ability to move from one [[gene locus|locus]] to another between genomes by means other than parent-to-offspring inheritance. Horizontal gene transfer has long been thought to be crucial to prokaryotic evolution, but there is a growing amount of data showing that HTT is a common and widespread phenomenon in [[eukaryote]] evolution as well.&lt;ref name="Schaack, Sarah 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Schaack S, Clement G, Cedric F |year= 2010 |title= Promiscuous DNA: Horizontal Transfer of Transposable Elements and Why It Matters for Eukaryotic Evolution |url= |journal= Trends in Ecology and Evolution |volume= 25 |issue= 9 |pages= 537–46 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2010.06.001|pmc= 2940939 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the transposable element side, spreading between genomes via horizontal transfer may be viewed as a strategy to escape purging due to purifying selection, mutational decay and/or host defense mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Dupeyron, Mathilde 2014 PMC"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Dupeyron M ''et al'' |year= 2014 |title= Horizontal Transfer of Transposons between and within Crustaceans and Insects |url= |journal= Mobile DNA |volume= 5 |issue= |page= 4 |doi=10.1186/1759-8753-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HTT can occur with any type of transposable elements, but [[DNA transposon]]s and [[retroelement|LTR retroelements]] are more likely to be capable of HTT because both have a stable, double-stranded DNA intermediate that is thought to be sturdier than the single-stranded RNA intermediate of [[retroelement|non-LTR retroelements]], which can be highly degradable.&lt;ref name="Schaack, Sarah 2010"/&gt; [[Transposable element|Non-autonomous elements]] may be less likely to transfer horizontally compared to [[Transposable element|autonomous elements]] because they do not encode the proteins required for their own mobilization. The structure of these non-autonomous elements generally consists of an intronless gene encoding a [[transposase]] protein, and may or may not have a promoter sequence. Those that do not have promoter sequences encoded within the mobile region rely on adjacent host promoters for expression.&lt;ref name="Schaack, Sarah 2010"/&gt; Horizontal transfer is thought to play an important role in the TE life cycle.&lt;ref name="Schaack, Sarah 2010"/&gt;

HTT has been shown to occur between species and across continents in both plants&lt;ref name="Baidouri, Moaine 2014 PMC"&gt;{{cite journal |author= El Baidouri Moaine |year= 2014 |title= Widespread and Frequent Horizontal Transfers of Transposable Elements in Plants |journal= Genome Research |volume= 24 |issue= 5 |pages= 831–838 |doi=10.1101/gr.164400.113|display-authors=etal |pmid=24518071 |pmc=4009612}}&lt;/ref&gt; and animals (Ivancevic et al. 2013), though some TEs have been shown to more successfully colonize the genomes of certain species over others.&lt;ref name="Ivancevic, A.

M. 2013"/&gt;

The arrival of a new TE in a host genome can have detrimental consequences because TE mobility may induce mutation. However, HTT can also be beneficial by introducing new genetic material into a genome and promoting the shuffling of genes and TE domains among hosts, which can be co-opted by the host genome to perform new functions.&lt;ref name="Ivancevic, A. M. 2013"/&gt; Moreover, transposition activity increases the TE copy number and generates [[chromosomal rearrangement]] hotspots.&lt;ref name="Wallau, Gabriel Luz 2012 PMC"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wallau, Luz G, Freitas Ortiz M, Elgion Lucio SL | year = 2012 | title = Horizontal Transposon Transfer in Eukarya: Detection, Bias, and Perspectives | doi = 10.1093/gbe/evs055 | journal = Genome Biology and Evolution | volume = 4 | issue = 8| pages = 801–811 }}&lt;/ref&gt; HTT detection is a difficult task because it is an ongoing phenomenon that is constantly changing in frequency of occurrence and composition of TEs inside host genomes. Furthermore, few species have been analyzed for HTT, making it difficult to establish patterns of HTT events between species. These issues can lead to the underestimation or overestimation of HTT events between ancestral and current eukaryotic species.&lt;ref name="Wallau, Gabriel Luz 2012 PMC"/&gt;

==Methods of detection==
[[File:Xenology.svg|thumb|A speciation event produces [[ortholog]]s of a gene in the two daughter species. A horizontal gene transfer event from one species to another adds a [[xenolog]] of the gene to the receiving genome.]]
{{Main|Inferring horizontal gene transfer}}

Horizontal gene transfer is typically inferred using [[bioinformatics]] methods, either by identifying atypical sequence signatures ("parametric" methods) or by identifying strong discrepancies between the evolutionary history of particular sequences compared to that of their hosts. The transferred gene  ([[xenolog]]) found in the receiving species is more closely related to the genes of the donor species than would be expected.

==Viruses==

Gene transfer between plants and fungi has been posited for a number of cases, including rice ([[Oryza sativa]]).

==Artificial horizontal gene transfer==
[[File:Artificial Bacterial Transformation.svg|thumb|Before it is transformed, a bacterium is susceptible to antibiotics. A plasmid can be inserted when the bacteria is under stress, and be incorporated into the bacterial DNA creating antibiotic resistance. When the plasmids are prepared they are inserted into the bacterial cell by either making pores in the plasma membrane with temperature extremes and chemical treatments, or making it semi permeable through the process of electrophoresis, in which electric currents create the holes in the membrane. After conditions return to normal the holes in the membrane close and the plasmids are trapped inside the bacteria where they become part of the genetic material and their genes are expressed by the bacteria.]]

{{See also|Horizontal gene transfer in evolution}}

Horizontal gene transfer is a potential [[Lurking variable|confounding factor]] in inferring [[phylogenetic tree]]s based on the [[sequence]] of one gene.&lt;ref name="Lawton"&gt;Graham Lawton ''[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126921.600-why-darwin-was-wrong-about-the-tree-of-life.html?page=1 Why Darwin was wrong about the tree of life]'' [[New Scientist]] Magazine issue 2692 21 January 2009 Accessed February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; For example, given two distantly related bacteria that have exchanged a gene a phylogenetic tree including those species will show them to be closely related because that gene is the same even though most other genes are dissimilar. For this reason it is often ideal to use other information to infer robust phylogenies such as the presence or absence of genes or, more commonly, to include as wide a range of genes for phylogenetic analysis as possible.

For example, the most common gene to be used for constructing phylogenetic relationships in [[prokaryote]]s is the [[16S ribosomal RNA]] gene since its sequences tend to be conserved among members with close phylogenetic distances, but variable enough that differences can be measured. However, in recent years it has also been argued that 16s rRNA genes can also be horizontally transferred. Although this may be infrequent, the validity of 16s rRNA-constructed phylogenetic trees must be reevaluated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/content/55/3/1021.full Genomic analysis of Hyphomonas neptunium contradicts 16S rRNA gene-based phylogenetic analysis: implications for the taxonomy of the orders 'Rhodobacterales' and Caulobacteraes]&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologist [[Johann Peter Gogarten]] suggests "the original metaphor of a tree no longer fits the data from recent genome research" therefore "biologists should use the metaphor of a mosaic to describe the different histories combined in individual genomes and use the metaphor of a net to visualize the rich exchange and cooperative effects of HGT among microbes".&lt;ref name=gogarten/&gt; There exist several methods to infer such [[phylogenetic network]]s.

Using single genes as [[phylogenetic marker]]s, it is difficult to trace organismal [[phylogeny]] in the presence of horizontal gene transfer. Combining the simple [[coalescent theory|coalescence]] model of [[cladogenesis]] with rare HGT horizontal gene transfer events suggest there was no single [[most recent common ancestor]] that contained all of the genes ancestral to those shared among the three domains of [[life]]. Each contemporary [[molecule]] has its own history and traces back to an individual molecule [[cenancestor]]. However, these molecular ancestors were likely to be present in different organisms at different times."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Zhaxybayeva |first1= O. |last2= Gogarten |first2= J. |doi= 10.1016/j.tig.2004.02.004 |title= Cladogenesis, coalescence and the evolution of the three domains of life |journal= Trends in Genetics |volume= 20 |issue= 4 |pages= 182–187 |year= 2004 |pmid= 15041172 |pmc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Challenge to the tree of life===
{{further|Last universal common ancestor|tree of life (science)}}

Horizontal gene transfer poses a possible challenge to the concept of the [[last universal common ancestor]] (LUCA) at the root of the [[tree of life (science)|tree of life]] first formulated by [[Carl Woese]], which led him to propose the [[Archaea]] as a third domain of life.&lt;ref name="Doolittle00"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Doolittle, Ford W. |date=February 2000 |title=Uprooting the Tree of Life |journal= [[Scientific American]] |pages=72–7 |pmid=10710791 |authorlink= Ford Doolittle |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0200-90 |volume=282 |issue=2|bibcode=2000SciAm.282b..90D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it was while examining the new three-domain view of life that horizontal gene transfer arose as a complicating issue: ''[[Archaeoglobus|Archaeoglobus fulgidus]]'' was seen as an anomaly with respect to a phylogenetic tree based upon the encoding for the [[enzyme]] [[HMGCoA reductase]]—the organism in question is a definite Archaean, with all the cell lipids and transcription machinery that are expected of an Archaean, but whose HMGCoA genes are of bacterial origin.&lt;ref name=Doolittle00/&gt; Scientists are broadly agreed on [[symbiogenesis]], that [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] in eukaryotes derived from [[alpha-proteobacteria]]l cells and that [[chloroplast]]s came from ingested [[cyanobacteria]], and other gene transfers may have affected early eukaryotes. (In contrast, multicellular eukaryotes have mechanisms to prevent horizontal gene transfer, including separated [[germ cell]]s.) If there had been continued and extensive gene transfer, there would be a complex network with many ancestors, instead of a tree of life with sharply delineated lineages leading back to a LUCA.&lt;ref name=Doolittle00/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Woese CR |title=A New Biology for a New Century |journal=Microbiol.

=== Phylogenetic information in HGT ===
On the opposite, it has been remarked that the detection of Horizontal Gene Transfers could bring valuable phylogenetic and dating information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-60327-853-9_7|title=Horizontal Gene Transfer|last=Huang|first=Jinling|last2=Gogarten|first2=Johann Peter|date=2009|publisher=Humana Press|isbn=9781603278522|series=Methods in Molecular Biology|pages=127–139|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-60327-853-9_7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The chromosomal organization of Horizontal Gene Transfer===

The acquisition of new genes has the potential to disorganize the other genetic elements and hinder the function of the bacterial cell, thus affecting the competitiveness of bacteria. Consequently, bacterial adaptation lies in a conflict between the advantages of acquiring beneficial genes, and the need to maintain the organization of the rest of its genome. Horizontally transferred genes are typically concentrated in only ~1% of the chromosome (in regions called hotspots). This concentration increases with genome size and with the rate of transfer. Hotspots diversify by rapid gene turnover; their chromosomal distribution depends on local contexts (neighboring core genes), and content in mobile genetic elements. Hotspots concentrate most changes in gene repertoires, reduce the trade-off between genome diversification and organization, and should be treasure troves of strain-specific adaptive genes. Most mobile genetic elements and antibiotic resistance genes are in hotspots, but many hotspots lack recognizable mobile genetic elements and exhibit frequent homologous recombination at flanking core genes. Overrepresentation of hotspots with fewer mobile genetic elements in naturally transformable bacteria suggests that homologous recombination and horizontal gene transfer are tightly linked in genome evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Oliveira |first1= Pedro H. |last2= Touchon |first2= Marie |last3= Cury |first3= Jean |last4= Rocha |first4= Eduardo PC |doi= 10.1038/s41467-017-00808-w |title= The chromosomal organization of horizontal gene transfer in bacteria |journal= Nature Communications |volume= 8 |issue= 841 |pages= 1–111 |year= 2017|bibcode= 2017NatCo...8..841O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''insulin tolerance test''' ('''ITT''') is a medical diagnostic procedure during which [[insulin]] is injected into a patient's vein, after which blood glucose is measured at regular intervals. This procedure is performed to assess [[pituitary]] function, [[adrenal]] function, and sometimes for other purposes. An ITT is usually ordered and interpreted by [[endocrinologist]]s.

Insulin injections are intended to induce extreme [[hypoglycemia]] below 2.2&amp;nbsp;mmol/l (40&amp;nbsp;mg/dl).  Patient must have symptomatic neuroglycopenia to trigger counter-regulatory cascade. Glucose levels below 2.2 mmol/L are insufficient absent symptoms. The brain must register low glucose levels.  In response, [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH) and [[growth hormone]] (GH) are released as a part of the stress mechanism. ACTH elevation causes the [[adrenal cortex]] to release [[cortisol]]. Normally, both cortisol and GH serve as [[counterregulatory hormone]]s, opposing the action of insulin, i.e. acting against the hypoglycemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Greenwood FC, Landon J, Stamp TC |title=The plasma sugar, free fatty acid, cortisol, and growth hormone response to insulin. I. In control subjects |journal=J Clin Invest |volume=45 |pages=429– |year=1965 |doi=10.1172/JCI105357 |pmid=5937021 |issue=4 |pmc=292717 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus ITT is considered to be the [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] for assessing the integrity of the [[hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis]]. Sometimes ITT is performed to assess the peak adrenal capacity, e.g. before [[surgery]]. It is assumed that the ability to respond to insulin induced hypoglycemia translates into appropriate cortisol rise in the stressful event of acute illness or major surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Plumpton FS, Besser GM |title=The adrenocortical response to surgery and insulin-induced hypoglycaemia in corticosteroid-treated and normal subjects |journal=Br J Surg |volume=56 |pages=216–219 |year=1969 |doi=10.1002/bjs.1800560315 |pmid=5776687 |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This test is potentially very dangerous and must be undertaken with great care, because it can [[iatrogenesis|iatrogenically]] induce the equivalent of a [[diabetic coma]]. A health professional must attend it at all times.

Other provocation tests which cause much less release of growth hormone include the use of [[glucagon]], [[arginine]] and [[clonidine]].

==Side effects==
Side effects include sweating, palpitations, loss of consciousness and rarely convulsions due to severe hypoglycemia which may cause coma. If extreme symptoms are present, glucose should be given [[intravenous]]ly. In subjects with no adrenal reserve an [[Addisonian crisis]] may occur.  For cortisol stimulation, the [[ACTH stimulation test]] has much less risk.

==Contraindications==
* This test should not be performed on children outside a specialist [[pediatric]] endocrine unit.
* [[Ischemic heart disease]]
* [[Epilepsy]]
* Severe [[panhypopituitarism]], [[hypoadrenalism]]
* [[Hypothyroidism]] impairs the GH and cortisol response. Patients should have corticosteroid replacement commenced prior to thyroxine as the latter has been reported to precipitate an Addisonian crisis with dual deficiency. If adrenal insufficiency is confirmed, the need for a repeat ITT may need to be reconsidered after 3 months thyroxine therapy.

==Interpretation==

The test cannot be interpreted unless hypoglycaemia (&lt; 2.2&amp;nbsp;mmol/L (or) &lt; 40&amp;nbsp;mg/dl) is achieved.

===Hypopituitarism===
An adequate cortisol response is defined as a rise to greater than 550 nmol/L. Patients with impaired cortisol responses (less than 550 but greater than 400 nmol/L) may only need steroid cover for major illnesses or stresses. An adequate GH response occurs with an absolute response exceeding 20 mU/L.

===Cushing's syndrome===
There will be a rise of less than 170 nmol/L above the fluctuations of basal levels of cortisol.

'''Izmirlian Medical Center''' ({{lang-hy|Իզմիրլյան բժշկական կենտրոն}}), is a medical center and a research foundation located in the [[Armenia]]n capital [[Yerevan]]. Opened in 1986, it is located in the Kanaker-Zeytun district and currently operates under the supervision of the [[Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armenianchurch.org/index.jsp?sid=1&amp;id=16862&amp;pid=16860 Surb Nerses Mets Medical Research Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Surb Nerses Mets Research and Education Center''' ({{lang-hy|Սուրբ Ներսես Մեծ գիտաբժշկական կենտրոն}}), operates within the medical center.

==History==
The medical center-institute was originally opened in 1986 in the Nor Zeytun neighbourhood of Yerevan as a center of [[proctology]] named after L. Nazarov. Between 1998 and 2000, the center was redeveloped by the [[New York City|New York]]-based [[Armenian General Benevolent Union]] to include a section for [[plastic surgery]] and other surgical specialties. In 2000, the center was granted to the [[Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin]] and renamed as ''Surb Nerses Mets Medical Center'', after the Catholicos of All Armenians [[St. Nerses I|Nerses I]] of the 4 the century.

In 2013, the center was entirely redeveloped through donations from the ''Izmirlian Family Foundation''. US$12 million has been allocated for the redevelopment process and the construction of a new building. The hospital of the center was renamed in honor of benefactor Dikran Izmirlian. Other Armenian benefactors from [[Brazil]], United States and France have also contributed in the redevelopment of the center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armenianchurch.org/index.jsp?sid=1&amp;id=97&amp;pid=4&amp;lng=en Izmirlian Medical Center and St. Nerses the Great Medical Science Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==
With a capacity of 139 beds, currently the medical center-institute has 15 sections:&lt;ref&gt;[http://izmirlianmedicalcenter.com/eng/text/8/%D4%B8%D5%B6%D5%A4%D5%B0%D5%A1%D5%B6%D5%B8%D6%82%D6%80-%D5%BF%D5%A5%D5%B2%D5%A5%D5%AF%D5%A1%D5%BF%D5%BE%D5%B8%D6%82%D5%A9%D5%B5%D5%B8%D6%82%D5%B6 General information]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Janine O'Leary Cobb''' is a women's health activist and educator, and the author of one of the first popular books on [[menopause]] intended for a mainstream audience, ''Understanding Menopause'' (first published in 1988, now in its 6th edition, published 2005).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1552636755 Understanding Menopause: Amazon.ca: Janine O'leary Cobb: Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Cobb is recognized widely as a pioneer in the [[women's health]] movement in [[North America]] and has won critical recognition for her work in the field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.womensenews.org/story/health/020426/menopause-study-ignites-interest-new-therapies Menopause Study Ignites Interest in New Therapies | Women's eNews&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nwhn.org/honor30_cobb Janine O'Leary Cobb | National Women's Health Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwhn.ca/en/node/39522 Canadian Women's Health Publication Celebrates 20th Anniversary in Print! | Canadian Women's Health Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Congratulations,+Janine!-a0139566987 Congratulations, Janine! - Free Online Library&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 she founded the popular health newsletter, ''A Friend Indeed'', dedicated to highlighting the increasing medicalization of menopause, and to breaking the taboo of silence that still hung over many important women's health issues, such as [[menstruation]], menopause and [[breast cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1490529 | pmid=8431824 | volume=148 | issue=4 | title=Menopause comes out of the closet |date=February 1993 | journal=CMAJ | pages=613–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication continued to be released bi-monthly under the stewardship of other editors until 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/A+Friend+Indeed/publications.aspx?pageNumber=1 A Friend Indeed - Newspaper articles | Encyclopedia.com: Find newspaper articles!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Robert Hume (?). Oil painting. Wellcome V0017904.jpg|thumb|Portrait tentatively identified as John Robert Hume]]
'''John Robert Hume''' (c.1781–1857) was a Scottish surgeon and physician. He is cited as an example of a 19th-century medical career that arrived at a high position in the profession, without early qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Shepherd|title=The Crimean Doctors: A History of the British Medical Services in the Crimean War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HpCgkcvNiLcC&amp;pg=PA10|date=1 January 1991|publisher=Liverpool University Press|isbn=978-0-85323-107-3|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and military service==
Born in [[Renfrewshire]] in 1781 or 1782, he was the son of Joseph Hume, a medical practitioner at [[Hamilton, South Lanarkshire|Hamilton]]. He studied medicine at Glasgow in 1795, 1798, and at Edinburgh in 1796–7. He entered the medical service of the army as a hospital mate, was in Holland in 1799, and joined the [[92nd Regiment of Foot]] as assistant surgeon in 1800. He was in Egypt in 1801.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Hume, John Robert|volume=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studymore.org.uk/6biom.htm|title=Biographies of Medical Lunacy Commissioners1828-1912|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maltaramc.com/regsurg/h/humejr.html|title=maltaramc.com, ''Hume John Robert''|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that campaign he served as surgeon on [[HMS Ceres (1781)|HMS ''Ceres'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Edward Daniel Clarke]]|title=Travels in Various Countries of Europe, Asia and Africa: Greece, Egypt, and the Holy Land|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0rduMdSxVvsC&amp;pg=PA419|year=1817|publisher=T. Cadell and W. Davies|page=419}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his journals for his visit to [[Cyprus]] (including [[Larnaka]] and [[Limassol]]) were printed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/excerptacypriam00cobhgoog#page/n359/mode/2up|title=''Excerpta cypria''|last=Cobham|first=Claude Delaval|year=1908|work=[[Internet Archive]]|pages=339–42|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume served in the [[Walcheren Expedition]] in 1809, and the [[Peninsula War]].

==Later life==
The [[University of St Andrews]] conferred on Hume the degree of M.D. on 12 January 1816, and on 22 December 1819 he was admitted a licentiate of the [[Royal College of Physicians]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; On his own account, he had previously been in France with the Duke of Wellington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Great Britain.

Settling in London, Hume became personal physician to the Duke.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; His patients included Marianne Patterson in 1824, shortly to marry the Duke's brother Richard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jehanne Wake|title=Sisters of Fortune: America's Caton Sisters at Home and Abroad|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9vIQ4J28Tn8C&amp;pg=PA187|date=28 February 2012|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4516-0763-5|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; He travelled with the Duke to [[St Petersburg]] in 1826,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Aspinall|title=The Letters of King George IV|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lvw8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA140|year=1938|publisher=CUP Archive|pages=140–1|id=GGKEY:9AN5KT99PTA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was present at the Duke's duel with the [[George Finch-Hatton, 10th Earl of Winchilsea|Earl of Winchelsea]], fought in 1829 as part of the [[Catholic Emancipation]] controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=F.

Hume was created D.C.L. at Oxford on 13 June 1834, the Duke being then chancellor of the university. He was admitted a fellow of the College of Physicians on 9 July 1836, and on the following 1 September was appointed one of the metropolitan [[commissioners in lunacy]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; Following the resignation of [[William Frederick Chambers]], Hume at this period also became Examining Physician to the [[East India Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/b21352148_0#page/n179/mode/2up|title=A History of the Indian Medical Service, 1600–1913 [electronic resource]|last=Crawford|first=Dirom Grey|year=1914|work=[[Internet Archive]]|page=164|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sufficiently well known to feature in the early writings of the [[Brontë family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Heather Glen|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Brontës|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-U0mwaEN7e0C&amp;pg=PA34|date=5 December 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-77971-5|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume was attacked and defended in ''[[The Lancet]]'' of the later 1840s, with other commissioners of lunacy, accused of being bedridden with gout, and a "[[sinecurist]]"; though he was active in inspections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Lancet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pwdBAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA75|year=1849|publisher=J.

He died at his house in [[Curzon Street]], Mayfair, London, on 1 March 1857, aged 75.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Family==

'''Kathe S. Perez''' is an   [[Speech-language pathology|speech pathologist]] who has   focused her work on helping those in the [[transgender]] community discover their true voice through the use of her   [[voice feminization]] program.

==Biography==
Perez was born on August 22 in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[Puerto Rico]] and spent her childhood in West Haven, Conn.&lt;ref name="kathesperez"&gt;[http://www.kathesperez.com www.kathesperez.com], March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; She is founder and president of  Exceptional Voice, Inc. which has headquarters in [[Denver]], [[Colorado|Colo]].&lt;ref name="SpeechLanguagePractice"&gt;“Out of the Darkness: The Remarkable Story of Kathe Perez, '86,” [http://www.SpeechLanguagePractice.org www.SpeechLanguagePractice.org], August 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SpeechLanguagePractice_a"&gt;“Kathe Perez, ’86,” [http://www.SpeechLanguagePractice.org www.SpeechLanguagePractice.org]. Retrieved January 15, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Of mixed heritage (Mexican-Irish-German-American) and from a family of modest means, Perez felt a bit different living in affluent [[Connecticut]]. From this early outsider experience, Perez sought to discover her own true voice.&lt;ref name="kathesperez" /&gt; Early on, she explored her talent as a singer, but she soon found that her skills as a special education teacher helping young children with learning and emotional difficulties find their voices best fit her, that experience lead her to pursue her graduate degree in speech pathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=In Touch with SLHS/CDSS Alumni |url=http://www.speechlanguagepractice.org/ |title=In Touch with SLHS/CDSS Alumni |publisher=Speechlanguagepractice.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;   During her graduate studies, she discovered her now current passion for the human voice – speech and voice therapy. Kathe has done extensive graduate and PhD work in the field, and has helped people from all corners of the globe find their true voice.&lt;ref name="SpeechLanguagePractice" /&gt;

Perez currently resides with her partner Kevin.&lt;ref name="SpeechLanguagePractice_a" /&gt; Her two adult daughters share her passion of advocacy and [[non-profit]] projects for the underserved populations.&lt;ref name="SpeechLanguagePractice_a" /&gt; In her free time, Kathe enjoys running (she ran four half marathons in one year), snowshoeing, hiking, gardening, traveling, live theater and reading.&lt;ref name="SpeechLanguagePractice" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Race History,” [http://www.Athlinks.com www.Athlinks.com], retrieved January 17. 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
KCA cofounder and President Leigh Blake was first inspired to start this initiative in 2003 after an encounter at the AIDS Research and Family Care Clinic, a place which she helped fund, in [[Mombasa]], [[Kenya]]. A woman named Anne brought her 3-year-old son Brine for medical care, refusing to leave until she received the “drugs that you have in [[United States|America]] for your children.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keepachildalive.org/ Keep a Child Alive- About]&lt;/ref&gt; Blake, who had already become involved in the AIDS [[epidemic]] using her background in the music and film industry to co-found the [http://www.redhot.com Red Hot Organization] and Artists Against AIDS Worldwide, told Anne that she would pay for the drugs. In so doing, the idea for Keep a Child Alive was born. The drugs were about $12000 a year through the [[New York University]] Hospital AIDS Research Department, which at that time was overseeing care at the clinic through Dr. Shaffiq Essajee. It was not long before word started to spread and friends of Blake and Essajee offered to make contributions. The first donor was Peter Edge and soon, KCA co-founder and Global Ambassador [[Alicia Keys]] joined the cause, sponsoring children along with [[Iman (model)|Iman]] and many others. In 2003, Keep a Child Alive was officially founded. The clinic in Kenya that led to Blake's vision became a model for other facilities that KCA now aspires to build throughout Africa and the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keepachildalive.org/ Keep a Child Alive- About]&lt;/ref&gt;

KCA cofounder Alicia Keys was first affected by the HIV/AIDs crisis at 8 years old when her mother's friend died from the disease. She discovered first-hand the extensive impact of the AIDS epidemic years later when she visited [[South Africa]], a trip that was the impetus to cofounding Keep a Child Alive. Keys had befriended AIDS activist Leigh Blake, who had reached out to her and helped raise her awareness to the global impact of HIV/AIDS. Keys and Leigh visited South African clinics with HIV-infected mothers and children, where Keys encountered the lack of resources and education on the disease present in the communities.&lt;ref name="People"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://people.com/celebrity/alicia-keys-opens-up-about-fighting-hivaids-black-ball-fundraiser/|title=Alicia Keys Opens Up About Fighting HIV/AIDS, Black Ball Fundraiser|date=October 30, 2015|magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]]|access-date=March 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keys visited other African countries such as [[Uganda]] and Kenya to promote care for children affected by AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=April 10, 2006|title=For The Record: Quick News On Gwyneth Paltrow, Chris Martin, Obie Trice, Notorious B.I.G., Jessica Simpson &amp; More|work=MTV News|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1528266/20060410/coldplay.jhtml|accessdate=December 16, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227235047/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1528266/20060410/coldplay.jhtml| archivedate= December 27, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=April 16, 2006|title=Alicia Keys and 'Keep a Child Alive' Visit AHF's Ithembalabantu Clinic, Free AIDS Clinic in Durban, South Africa Run by AIDS Healthcare Foundation|agency=PR Newswire|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=168584|accessdate=December 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-04-06-alicia-keys_x.htm|title=Alicia Keys in Kenya for HIV Project|date=April 6, 2006|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|accessdate=July 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work in Africa was documented in the documentary ''Alicia in Africa: Journey to the Motherland''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=April 7, 2008|title=Alicia Keys' Documentary "Alicia in Africa: Journey to the Motherland" Available...|agency=Reuters|publisher=Thomson Reuters|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/spiralfrog/child_alive/prweb838624.htm|accessdate=November 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Mission==
Keep a Child Alive brings attention to the already 30 million people that have been killed by AIDS in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and the millions more that are threatened and orphaned by the disease. Currently there are 33.3 million people living with HIV/AIDS, including 2.3 million children under the age of 15. Despite AIDS being a preventable and treatable disease, 2.9 million people died from AIDS related causes last year, including 380,000 children under the age of 15—the equivalent of one child dying per minute.[http://keepachildalive.org/images/handbook.pdf]

KCA's efforts continue to focus in particular on sub-Saharan Africa as it remains the worst-affected region in the world. With a little more than one-tenth of the world's population living in this area, it is home to almost 64 percent of all people living with HIV—of the overall 24.5 million infected, 2 million are children. While access to ARV therapy has increased more than eightfold since the end of 2003, only 30 percent of people in need of treatment receive it.

In addition to improving access to ARV therapy, KCA offers a range of support services including nutritional projects, diagnostic testing, training of health care workers, counseling, and funding sites where AIDS orphans can be cared for. There are currently 14.9 million AIDS orphans in Africa alone, 16.6 worldwide.

==Sites==
Keep a Child Alive currently provides funding to 10 clinical and orphan care sites in 5 countries: India, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda and South Africa with past funding to additional projects in Ethiopia, Mali, India, Kenya, South Africa and Zimbabwe. With KCA funding, these projects have been successfully scaled to new levels of service and self-sustainability within their communities.

==Campaigns==
'''''Spirit of a Child'''''&lt;br&gt;The [http://www.keepachildalive.org/postdards.pdf Spirit of a Child] campaign was one of KCA's first major endeavors to engage the public through "groundbreaking advertising and media campaigns" that "reinvent the way the public perceives their role in the issue."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keepachildalive.org/ Keep a Child Alive- About]&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign, which was created for KCA by [https://www.tbwachiat.com/ TBWA/Chiat Day] and photographed by Marc Baptiste, was launched on November 3, 2005 at the annual [[The Black Ball|Black Ball]] fundraiser. "Spirit of a Child" is the brainchild of Patrick O'Neill and Nikki Weinstein and features the children of Agape Orphanage paired with such celebrities as [[Kanye West]], [[David Byrne]], [[Lorraine Bracco]], [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[Cynthia Nixon]], [[Nas]], [[John Legend]] and others.

'''''I Am African'''''&lt;br&gt;The ''I Am African'' campaign stirred up controversy with its appropriation of tribal markings and face-paint worn by noted celebrities like [[Gisele Bündchen]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[David Bowie]], [[Sarah Jessica Parker]], and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]. The concept was created in the summer of 2006 by model and cosmetics entrepreneur [[Iman (model)|Iman]] to reflect the idea that Africa is the mother continent of all human beings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Givhan, Robin]].

''New York Times''. 13 November 2006: E3&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Become A Drug Dealer'''''&lt;br&gt;[http://www.becomeadrugdealer.com Become A Drug Dealer] is another KCA campaign that gives people the opportunity to purchase the drugs necessary to keep a child alive either by buying a T-shirt with the words ''Drug Dealer'' printed on it or making the typical monthly donation.

'''''Buy Life'''''&lt;br&gt;The Buy Life campaign seeks to change consumer behavior, to reposition consumerism and the act of buying in the nonprofit environment through social media. With the tagline "The More You Buy, The More You Save," created by [https://www.tbwachiat.com/ TBWA/Chiat Day], and photographed by [[Markus Klinko]] and [[Indrani]], this series of portraits of notable celebrities in T-shirts with personalized scanable [[barcodes]], turns the commercialism of celebrity packaging into a literal bar code that consumers can scan to buy life for the ultimate instant gratification. The campaign features celebrities including [[Katie Holmes]], [[Kim Kardashian]], [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]], [[Ryan Seacrest]], [[Alicia Keys]], [[Jaden Smith|Jaden]] and [[Willow Smith]], [[Swizz Beatz]], [[Serena Williams]], and styling by [[GK Reid]]. KCA is the first charity to use barcode technology on [[smartphone]] devices to engage the public and encourage the purchase of life.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Amy. "Farewell, Digital World." [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/28/business/28proto.html?src=busln] ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.keepachildalive.org/post/1256031907/buy-life-the-more-you-buy-the-more-you-save&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Digital Death'''''&lt;br&gt; The Digital Death campaign launched December 1, 2010 for [[World AIDS Day]] with shocking images of celebrities posed in coffins, photographed by Markus Klinko &amp; [[Indrani (photographer)|Indrani]], with taglines "[[Kim Kardashian]] is Dead", "Ryan Seacrest is Dead", etc. created by TBWA/Chiat Day. The image art is accompanied by performance art/interactive dimensions, with the stars sacrificing their digital lives on [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] until their fans donate one million dollars to buy their lives back. Among the other celebrities featured in the campaign were [[Alicia Keys]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]] and [[Serena Williams]]. [[Daphne Guinness]] explains, "This campaign is so striking and draws attention not only to the AIDS disaster in Africa but also to how we have lost our way in what we care about."&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Dawn "Kim Kardashian, Daphne Guinness and More Go Twitter-Silent for a Cause" November 30, 2010 http://www.harpersbazaar.com/bazaar-blog/kim-kardashian-keep-a-child-alive-113010&lt;/ref&gt; The million dollar donation goal was reached in six days.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Corporate Partners==
KCA maintains that the reason it is able to give such a large percentage of monthly donations is because it relies on larger contributions from foundations, corporations, and major individual donors to support management and administrative costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keepachildalive.org/ Keep a Child Alive- About]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], [[Donna Karan]], [[Time Warner Cable]], and [[Maybelline]] are just a few of KCA's many corporate partners. The full list can be accessed here. [http://www.keepachildalive.org/about_corporate.php]

==Mobile Fundraising==
In Fall 2008, Keep a Child Alive launched a [[mobile donating]] campaign with Co-Founder and Global Ambassador [[Alicia Keys]]. Keys raised over $40,000 in [[micro-donations]] by asking concert goers to text ALIVE to 90999.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS188626+02-Jul-2008+PRN20080702 Keep a Child Alive and Alicia Keys Raise $40,000 Through Mobile Donations During Fall 2008 Concert Tour].

== Early history and Hannah Riddell ==
Keisai Aoki (real name Yasujiro Aoki) was born in [[Tokushima]] Prefecture on April 8, 1893. At the age of 16 he developed leprosy and everything did not help, including the pilgrimage of 88 holy places of [[Shikoku]] (at that time it was believed to be of help). In 1916 he entered the Oshima Leprosarium and was baptized in 1918 as a Christian. He helped with missionary work, and he sent a letter to [[Hannah Riddell]] since he was worried about women's temptation. At [[Kusatsu, Gunma|Kusatsu]], he met Riddell who was vacationing there and decided to go to Kaishun Hospital, where she was the director. He helped with her missionary work in the facility, which he described as having an almost monastic atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hannah Riddell: An Englishwoman in Japan|last=Boyd|first=Julia|publisher=Charles E. Tuttle Company, Inc.|year=2012|isbn=9781462903818|location=Rutland, VT|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During his time at the hospital, he met Aiko Tamaki, who he became attracted to. This, however, worried him because this was against Riddell's strict policy of gender segregation. He decided to go to Okinawa to pursue missionary work at the strong suggestion of Riddell.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} It is not clear whether Riddell discovered Keisai's affection for Tamaki or whether he was asked to leave because of it. However, Keisai, himself, described Riddell's devotion to her patients even those who left under difficult circumstances, sending them letters and gifts after their departure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Okinawa and Okinawa Airakuen Sanatorium ==
With missionary Arato, he discovered people with leprosy living in caves or other places, first on Iejima Island, and later on Mainland [[Okinawa]], and they gave them clothes, food and spiritual ministry. At one place, village people burned down the houses of people with leprosy. They also discovered about 40 people forced to live in a small island called Jalma Island. Later they landed at Yagaji Island (some sources say Gayachi Island&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://leprosyhistory.org/database/person334|title=Keisai Aoki {{!}} International Leprosy Association - History of Leprosy|website=leprosyhistory.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;), where they acquired a piece of land, which Keisai eventually used to found the Kunigami (later Okingawa) Airakuen Sanatorium [[Okinawa Airakuen Sanatorium]] in 1938. In 1957, he became an official missionary of [[Okinawa]] Seikokai (Episcopal Church). On March 6, 1969, he died of myocardial infarction.

==Haiku==
Keisai also composed many short poems ([[haiku]]). These include the following:
:Koetekite, Hone o Uzumuru, Hito Ha kana
::Coming over to Okinawa, I am like a leaf, my bones will be buried here.

==Leprosy in Okinawa before Aoki==
Among the Japanese prefectures, leprosy had the highest incidence in Okinawa　Prefecture in 1925, 1935 and 1940. The Okinawa Government was inconsistent concerning the establishment of leprosaria. In 1931, Miyako Hoyoen Sanatorium was established on Miyako Island, but it was met with strong opposition from the mainland Okinawans. Rioting and burning of houses of leprosy patients occurred. With the help of various organizations and individuals such as [[Kensuke Mitsuda]] and Fumio Hayashi, the Kunigami Airakuen, now the [[Okinawa Airakuen Sanatorium]], was established due to the efforts and leadership of Keisai Aoki.&lt;ref&gt;Leprosy Control Measures  Kazuo Saikawa, Okinawa Leprosy Prevention Association, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Curtis''' (born August 3, 1965) is a former college student from [[Connecticut]] who on October 30, 1987 shot and killed his estranged girlfriend, and shot himself in the head. He was charged criminally for the killing, but originally was found [[competence (law)|mentally incompetent to stand trial]], and had the criminal charges dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/17/nyregion/guilty-plea-in-87-killing-case-altered-competency-laws.html?pagewanted=1|accessdate=March 10, 2010|work=New York Times | title=Guilty Plea in '87 Killing; Case Altered Competency Laws | first=Neil | last=MacFarquhar | date=September 17, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, he enrolled in college, and pursued studies as a [[pre-med]] student.

==The case==
On October 30, 1987, Curtis shot his estranged girlfriend Donna Kalson in a bar parking lot in [[Stratford, Connecticut]], killing her. He then shot himself in a [[murder-suicide]] attempt. He also injured one of Kalson's friends who was in her company in the process. After a lengthy hospitalization in which he was on [[advanced life support]], he survived his own shot, leaving him severely disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/US/9712/26/legal.quandary/ | work=CNN | title=Connecticut in legal quandary over man accused of murder | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was partially [[brain damage]]d and [[paralysis|paralyzed]].

After being released from the hospital, Curtis was charged with Kalson's murder and the attempted murder of her friend.&lt;ref name="people"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20124442,00.html|publisher=people.com|title=Fit to Be Tried|accessdate=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; But following his recovery, more than a year after the incident, he was given a [[Competency evaluation (law)|mental competence evaluation]] to determine if he could stand trial for his crimes. During the evaluation, it was found that his ability to read or understand were impaired, and he had no memory of the incident. As a result, he was ruled mentally incompetent to stand trial. But he was not ordered to be confined to a [[mental institution]]. He was allowed to return home. Kalson's family was initially unaware of this.

This did not sit well with Donna Kalson's parents when they learned, following a tip, that Curtis was attending a local college. The Kalsons arranged for their own investigation of Curtis. Reporters for [[WTNH|News Channel 8]] observed Curtis taking classes at a local college with an apparent goal of a career in [[psychiatry]]. His grades were mostly As and Bs; his [[grade point average]] after receiving 48 [[college credit|credits]] was 3.3,&lt;ref name="miaminewtimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/1997-12-11/news/news-of-the-weird/|publisher=miaminewtimes.com|title=News of the Weird &amp;#124; Miami New Times|accessdate=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; information that was obtained from a [[search warrant]] on Curtis's grades at three colleges executed by [[Stratford, Connecticut|Stratford]] police.&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Social Work and the Law: Proceedings of the National Organization of Forensic Social Work, 2000|author1=Neighbors, I.|author2=National Organization of Forensic Social Work|date=2002|publisher=Haworth Press|isbn=9780789015488|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5s7QSTvIi70C&amp;pg=PA16|page=16|accessdate=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His actions on campus, including a conversation the reporters had directly with Curtis, were filmed by reporters. While Curtis's defense team called many doctors to testify on his behalf, the video produced by the network was viewed as overwhelming evidence in favor of declaring him mentally competent.&lt;ref name="wtnh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.wtnh.com/news/1999/may/05131999-curtis.html|publisher=video.wtnh.com|title=news/1999/may/05131999-curtis|accessdate=February 17, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718122239/http://video.wtnh.com/news/1999/may/05131999-curtis.html|archivedate=July 18, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curtis's defense team attempted to fight the actions taken against him, claiming that he was already declared incompetent and could not be tried due to a Connecticut law that required such closure of all cases of this type after 18 months. They took their battles all the way to the [[Connecticut Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name="wtnh2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.wtnh.com/news/1998/sep/093098.html|publisher=video.wtnh.com|title=news/1998/sep/093098|accessdate=February 17, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718122428/http://video.wtnh.com/news/1998/sep/093098.html|archivedate=July 18, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But [[double jeopardy]] laws and other laws were not considered to be applicable, and Curtis was ordered to stand trial.

Curtis [[guilty plea|pleaded guilty]] in 1999 to [[manslaughter]] and received a 20-year prison sentence, the maximum allowed for charges of manslaughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/dec/04/news/mn-40924 | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Man Found Incompetent but Gets Prison | date=December 4, 1999 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="state"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctinmateinfo.state.ct.us/detailsupv.asp?id_inmt_num=260245|publisher=ctinmateinfo.state.ct.us|title=www.ctinmateinfo.state.ct.us/detailsupv.asp?id_inmt_num=260245|accessdate=February 17, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723141146/http://www.ctinmateinfo.state.ct.us/detailsupv.asp?id_inmt_num=260245|archivedate=July 23, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curtis was paroled in 2011.&lt;ref name="wtnh3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtnh.com/dpp/news/crime/convicted-murderer-out-on-parole#.UQBqumt5mSM|publisher=wtnh.com|title=Connecticut Local News and News 8 Video - New Haven, Hartford &amp;#124; WTNH|accessdate=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ma3looma''' is an Egyptian website aimed to raise awareness about [[sexual and reproductive health]] (SRH) issues among the Egyptian youth.  The website addresses the current problem that Egyptian youth/students are insufficiently educated about SRH issues due to their relatives/teachers being embarrassed or unprepared to discuss this issue due to social taboos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2012/egypt-adolescents-schools-sexual-education.aspx | work= PRB | title= Quality Sexual Education Needed for Adolescents in Egyptian Schools }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ma3looma uses various social media platforms as well as its own website to expose at-risk populations and the Egyptian youth coming to age in a digital era “… to anonymous, accurate, and non-judgmental information about their health and rights using OneWorld’s mobile phone and web-based question-and-answer service, which is managed and staffed by trained counselors from the Egyptian Family Health Service (EFHS).” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://oneworld.org/2013/09/19/ma3looma/ | work= oneWorld | title= Ma3looma Egypt }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ma3looma is operating via Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.

Ma3looma is funded by the [[Ford Foundation]] and is a project within One World's Mobile4Good portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://oneworld.org/2013/09/19/ma3looma/ | work= oneWorld | title= Ma3looma Egypt }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical context ==
There is a danger of inattention to [[HIV/AIDS]] that lurks within the countries of the Middle East and North Africa, specifically Egypt, that could lead to a repeat of situations seen in “Indonesia, Africa or China where initial disregard or delayed reaction has ended in large number of orphans, a shortage of workers and huge health expenditures to care for HIV/AIDS patients.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.merip.org/mer/mer233/hivaids-middle-east-north-africa | work= MEIRP | title= HIV/AIDS in the Middle East and North Africa }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Young people worldwide are considered an ‘at-risk’  population due to participation in risky behaviors such as taking drugs, experimenting sexually, and failing to use condoms. Sexual education is a necessity among youth worldwide and Egyptian youth is no exception.

In Egypt, adolescent SRH education is controversial and is opposed by some parents, religious and community leaders, policymakers, service providers, and young people due to social taboos and the belief that these issues are too embarrassing to discuss in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2012/egypt-adolescents-schools-sexual-education.aspx | work= PRB | title= Quality Sexual Education Needed for Adolescents in Egyptian Schools }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of continuity within the society leads to school-based or home-based SRH education to be insufficient in either the amount of information and/or the accuracy of that information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2012/egypt-adolescents-schools-sexual-education.aspx | work= PRB | title= Quality Sexual Education Needed for Adolescents in Egyptian Schools }}&lt;/ref&gt; This obviously creates a challenge for young Egyptians, ages 10–29 which compose 40 percent of the Egyptian population, to attain important and accurate SRH information to stay healthy and safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://oneworld.org/2013/09/19/ma3looma/ | work= oneWorld | title= Ma3looma Egypt }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enter Ma3looma which means "a piece of information," in Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://oneworld.org/2013/09/19/ma3looma/ | work= oneWorld | title= Ma3looma Egypt }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
This website uses various social media platforms as well as its own website to expose at-risk populations and the Egyptian youth coming to age in a digital era “… to anonymous, accurate, and non-judgmental information about their health and rights using OneWorld’s mobile phone and web-based question-and-answer service, which is managed and staffed by trained counselors from the Egyptian Family Health Service (EFHS).”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://oneworld.org/2013/09/19/ma3looma/ | work= oneWorld | title= Ma3looma Egypt }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Supported ==

Support from the website comes from "a collaborative network of actors, including OneWorld UK, the Egypt-based Centre for Development Services (CDS), which is responsible for the financial management of the project, the Egyptian Family Health Society (EFHS), which manages the mobile phone messaging service, as well as the UNFPA's Youth Peer Network (Y-PEER), Friends of Life (FoL), the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR), and Qabila TV." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://oneworld.org/2013/09/19/ma3looma/ | work= oneWorld | title= Ma3looma Egypt }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medicines for Malaria Venture''' (MMV), a not-for-profit [[public-private partnership]], was established as a foundation in Switzerland in 1999. Its mission is to reduce the burden of [[malaria]] in disease-endemic countries by discovering, developing and facilitating delivery of new, effective and affordable [[antimalarial drug]]s. Its vision is a world in which these innovative medicines will cure and protect the vulnerable and under-served populations at risk of malaria, and help to ultimately eradicate this terrible disease.

==History==
MMV was launched in 1999, with initial seed finance of US$4 million from the [[Government of Switzerland]], [[Department for International Development]] (UK), the [[Politics of the Netherlands|Government of the Netherlands]], The [[World Bank]], and [[Rockefeller Foundation]].

In 1999, the pipeline for new [[antimalarial drug]]s was virtually empty. The possibility of profit in antimalarial drug development was considered too low to attract pharmaceutical investment. Malaria was killing 1-2 million people a year, most of them children under five and pregnant women from the poorest regions of the world.

The drugs they were using no longer worked, and the need to act in the face of a projected public health disaster due to escalating drug resistance, provided reason to launch MMV and has since proved that the [[public-private partnership]] model is an efficient way to bridge the gap in new drugs for malaria.

==Organization and governance==
MMV is governed by a Board of Directors chosen for their scientific, medical and public health expertise in malaria and related fields, their research and management competence as well as their experience in business, finance and fundraising. The Chairman of the Board of MMV is [[Ray Chambers]]. MMV recently{{when|date=September 2012}} established a Board of Directors in North America.

==Project portfolio==
MMV's project portfolio focuses on delivering efficacious medicines that are affordable, accessible, and appropriate for use in malaria endemic areas. Specifically, the goal is to develop products that will provide: efficacy against [[Drug resistance|drug-resistant]] strains of ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'', potential for intermittent treatments (infants and pregnancy), safety in small children (less than 6 months old), safety in pregnancy, efficacy against ''[[Plasmodium vivax]]'' (including radical cure), efficacy against severe malaria, and transmission-blocking treatment.

==Adverse Effects and Patient Compliance==

Some anti-malarial agents are known to have some side effects, which limits their use for mono-therapies only. This poses a limitation for their use in combination therapy, for overcoming drug resistance. Also, some of the side effects may lead to a low level of compliance by the patient, i.e. not completing the full course of treatment. This creates conditions within the patient that enable drug resistance to arise or even to become prevalent. In view of such situations it is often recommended that novel anti-malarial agents need to be discovered and developed.

==Drug Resistance==

Drug resistance occurs for several reasons, often as a natural consequence of gene mutations and selection, as a consequence of drug-efflux mechanisms, or due to drug modifying enzymes. Under conditions of medical treatment, mutants that are resistant to the drug may escape the drug's action, survive and multiply further. This is one of the reasons why combination therapies are often essential for treating malarial infections and most infectious diseases. In view of the contagious nature of malaria, spread by the mosquito, drug resistance is considered to be a serious public health issue.

==Investigational New Drugs==

Investigational new drugs (IND) are clinical candidates that are safe and efficacious in the animal models of infection. Usually, these are new chemical entities (NCE) with a novel mechanism of action. Investigational new drugs have to be approved by the national or international medical regulatory authorities, for clinical testing and development in humans.
IND's are usually discovered and developed to overcome the limitations of drugs that are or have been in clinical use.

==Research &amp; Development Centre==

Research and Development Centres (R&amp;D) for infectious diseases usually are staffed with scientists and physicians in the fields of biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, pharmacology, veterinary science and medicine. Depending on the number of projects, it is a common practice for these research and development Centres to be staffed with about 150 scientists and physicians, with an organizational framework that is appropriate for pharmaceutical research and development. In very specialized areas, the services of contract research organizations are exploited. Thereby new assets and [[intellectual property]] are developed and patented, and are published in leading scientific and medical journals. Keynote lectures are presented at scientific and medical conferences in the field of infectious diseases, worldwide.

==Animal Health and Veterinary Medicine==

In view of the similarities between the malaria parasite species that affect humans and other parasite species that affect animals, the high scope for synergy in discovering new medicines for veterinary infections is of special significance and importance. This is of special interest for live-stock such as cattle, poultry, and companion animals.

==Access and delivery==
MMV works in partnership to ensure the life-saving [[antimalarial]]s emerging from its research-and-development pipeline do not suffer undue delays in reaching patients in need. MMV's access team focuses on assuring acceptance of new medicines, expanding reach to vulnerable patients and measuring and evaluating impact and need.

==Open Source Malaria==
MMV started the '''Open Source Malaria''' project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openwetware.org/wiki/OpenSourceMalaria|title=OpenSourceMalaria|publisher=hosted at [[OpenWetWare]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which encourages those interested to share procedures and results of [[open source]] research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmv.org/research-development/open-source-research|title=Open Source Research|publisher=Medicines for Malaria Venture}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openwetware.org/wiki/OpenSourceMalaria:FAQ|title=OpenSourceMalaria:FAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Open Source Malaria project received worldwide media attention after helping, together with researchers at the [[University of Sydney]], to supervise high school students at [[Sydney Grammar School]] who adapted a synthesis of [[Daraprim]] (pyrimethamine), using a less hazardous method to improve safety, to illustrate the ability of enthusiastic amateurs to produce this drug.  Daraprim has been marketed in the U.S. at $750 per pill due to non-patent exclusivity restrictions; the students synthesized it for under $20 USD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-11/uos-bgs113016.php|title=Breaking good: School students make costly drug cheaply using open source approach|publisher=Eurekalert|author=University of Sydney|date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.9news.com.au/good-news/2016/12/01/07/06/sydney-high-school-students-recreate-drug-that-has-retailed-for-148k-for-27|title=Sydney high school students spend $27 to recreate drug that has retailed for $148k|publisher=9news.com.au|author=Ehsan Knopf|date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7261">The '''Men's Dress Reform Party''' ('''MDRP''') was a reform movement in interwar [[Great Britain|Britain]].&lt;ref name="Burman1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burman|first1=B.|title=The Better and Brighter Clothes: The Men's Dress Reform Party, 1929 1940|journal=Journal of Design History|volume=8|issue=4|year=1995|pages=275–290|issn=0952-4649|doi=10.1093/jdh/8.4.275}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the party's main concerns were the impact of clothes on men's health and hygiene, their mission also aimed to increase the variety and choice in men's clothing.&lt;ref name="Burman1995" /&gt;

== Background ==
The injuries and casualties of [[World War I]] shifted the public's focus to the capabilities and general health of the human body,&lt;ref name="Bourke1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bourke|first1=J.|title=The Great Male Renunciation: Men's Dress Reform in Inter-war Britain|journal=Journal of Design History|volume=9|issue=1|year=1996|pages=23–33|issn=0952-4649|doi=10.1093/jdh/9.1.23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a general concern for the social and medical impacts of clothing grew. The New Health Society, an entity formed to effectuate change in these areas, was composed of a group of professionals led by Alfred Charles Jordan who wanted to improve the overall health of adults and children. They pushed for more exercise and fresh air, improved diets, and improved conditions in homes and workplaces. In 1927, [[Sir William Arbuthnot Lane, 1st Baronet|Sir Arbuthnot Lane]], a co-founder of the New Health Society, formed the Clothing Subcommittee, a subcommittee within the society focused on the health impacts of dress.&lt;ref name="Bourke1996" /&gt; On June 12, 1929 this subcommittee officially separated from the New Health Society to form the Men's Dress Reform Party&lt;ref name="Burman1995" /&gt; through an address to the public in London, England. It read: 
"Men and women, old and young, rich and poor… interested in healthier and better clothes for men…[and to] reform their clothes with as much profit to health and appearance as women have recently achieved."

=== Leadership ===
Alfred Charles Jordan, the founder of the New Health Society, and [[Caleb Saleeby|Dr. Caleb Williams Saleeby]] served as the leaders of the Clothing Subcommittee and led the charge to form their own party, with Williams as the Chairman of the Council of the Party.  Founding members also included the members of the former Clothing Subcommittee, the [[Dean of St Paul's Cathedral]], the Very Revd [[William Inge (priest)|William Inge]], Guy Kendall, [[Walter Sickert|Richard Sickert]], [[Ernest Thesiger]], and [[Leonard Williams (politician)|Leonard Williams]].

==Ideology==
[[John Carl Flügel]], a psychologist and member of the MDRP, claimed since the end of the 18th century men had been ignoring the colorful, elaborate, and varied forms of "masculine ornamentation."&lt;ref name="Bourke1996" /&gt;  He called this time the Great Masculine Renunciation. "Man,"  Flügel claimed, had "abandoned his claim to be considered beautiful. He henceforth aimed at only being useful."&lt;ref name="Flugel1930"&gt;{{cite book|last=Flugel|first=John Carl|title=The Psychology of Clothes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dn9qAAAAMAAJ|year=1930|publisher=Hogarth|location=London|pages=110–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view aligned with that of founding member of the Men's Dress Reform Party, William Ralph Inge. Inge believed that the democratic movements of the [[French Revolution]] had led to the increasingly dull male look: "to escape the guillotine, dress as bourgeois as possible."&lt;ref name="Bourke1996" /&gt; The party's goals were largely reactions to circumstances brought on by World War I. They saw the everyday man as "oppressed by capitalist labor"&lt;ref name="Bourke1996" /&gt; and saw his clothes as "depressing"&lt;ref name="Bourke1996" /&gt; and lacking in creativity.  The military-style uniformity&lt;ref name="Bourke1996" /&gt; of the interwar period had created a culture of men who were happy to see others dressed like them, as opposed to seeing those who craved individuality.  World War I also brought increased unemployment, which caused state intervention, which the Men's Dress Reform Party saw as the "oppression of professionals".&lt;ref name="Bourke1996" /&gt; Lastly, the status of women in society was changing.  [[Feminism]] was developing in the interwar period, as women had taken over for men during World War I in jobs, schools, and social life. This threatened men, causing some to feel "like accessories to women".&lt;ref name="Bourke1996" /&gt; The MDRP sought to improve the health and hygiene of men by changing their dress, as they saw the typical male styles and materials growing more restrictive and harmful, while women's clothing was increasingly becoming more "emanicipating"&lt;ref name="Bourke1996" /&gt; Their goals included "freeing the neck" by wearing the "Byron collar"&lt;ref name="Burman1995" /&gt; which was an open-front collar, and gaining approval of the kilt&lt;ref name="Bourke1996" /&gt; as everyday wear for men. They also preferred blouses instead of shirts, sandals over shoes, and shorts or breeches to trousers.  The party felt that hats and coats were only acceptable in appropriate weather, and that underclothing should be loose. Most of these rules were already acceptable for occasions such as vacation, but the party looked to make these the standard for town, professional, and evening dress.

=== 1929–1937===
Unlike other organizations of the time, the MDRP had no formal journal. Instead, the group published articles about their reform ideas in ''Sunlight'', a quarterly journal produced by [[The Sunlight League]]. MDRP member Dr. Caleb Saleeby chaired the Sunlight League, and thus incurred the league's support of the Men's Dress Reform Party. A Design Committee was organized to construct designs of "acceptable" clothing, and received national attention for their recommendations. Members claimed that branches were forming in all corners of the world, including India, China, Australia, South Africa, the USA, New Zealand, Canada, and Europe in addition to the approximately 200 branches in the UK.&lt;ref name="Burman1995" /&gt; These groups held social events, rallies, and debates, but the prevalence of such events decreased with the onset of World War II.&lt;ref name="Burman1995" /&gt; In 1937, the Men's Dress Reform Party lost the support of the New Health Society due to financial trouble and eventual bankruptcy.&lt;ref name="Bourke1996" /&gt; Then, in 1940, the Sunlight League also dissipated after a bomb destroyed their offices and the death of its founder, Dr. Saleeby. After this period, the Men's Dress Reform Party largely ceased to exist.&lt;ref name="Burman1995" /&gt;

'''National Beer Day''' is celebrated in the [[United States]] every year on April 7, marking the day that the [[Cullen–Harrison Act]] was enacted after having been signed into law by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on March 22, 1933. This led to the Eighteenth Amendment being repealed on December 5, 1933, with ratification of the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=W.

==Background==
Upon signing the legislation, Roosevelt made his famous remark, "I think this would be a good time for a beer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Post|url=http://fdrlibrary.tumblr.com/post/80357959743/i-think-this-would-be-a-good-time-for-beer|website=fdrlibrary.tumblr.com|publisher=Franklin D.

The beer could contain up to 3.2% alcohol by weight (or 4.05% by volume) compared to the 0.5% limit of the [[Volstead Act]], because 3.2% was considered too low to produce [[alcohol intoxication|intoxication]].

People across the country responded by gathering outside breweries, some beginning the night before. On that first day, 1.5 million barrels of beer were consumed, inspiring the future holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.homewetbar.com/blog/national-beer-day/|title = The Dirty Truth About National Beer Day|date = April 6, 2015|accessdate = April 6, 2015|website = HomeWetBar Blog|publisher = HomeWetBar.com|last = Brazil|first = Rodney}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, April 7 is recognized as National Beer Day and April 6 is known as New Beer's Eve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ratebeer.com/event/14784/ |title=National Beer Day &amp;#124; Beer Travel, sand Brewing Industry Events, Local Parties: Anytown |publisher=Ratebeer.com |date= |accessdate=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cullen-Harrison Act was not the official end of prohibition in the US (that happened on December 5, 1933 when the 21st Amendment was ratified). What the Cullen-Harrison Act did do was redefine an "intoxicating beverage" under the Volstead Act. As such, April 7 is a beer specific holiday and should not be confused with [[Repeal Day]] celebrated on December 5.

==Recognition==
National Beer Day was first created in 2009 by Justin Smith of Richmond, Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wric.com/2015/04/07/clink-cheers-have-a-brew-in-honor-of-national-beer-day/|title=*Clink* Cheers! Have a brew in honor of National Beer Day|work=WRIC}}&lt;/ref&gt; After much prodding from his friend, Mike Connolly, Smith started a Facebook page that was noticed by Colorado Beer Examiner, Eli Shayotovich. Smith's promotion of the new holiday via various social media outlets was rewarded when the beer drinking app, "[[Untappd]]", created a badge for National Beer Day that rewarded participants that checked a beer into the app on April 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.untappd.com/post/4397077324/national-beer-day-2011|title=National Beer Day 2011|work=Untappd – Drink Socially}}&lt;/ref&gt; National Beer Day has since been trending every year on April 7 using the hashtag #NationalBeerDay.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

National Beer Day was officially recognized by Virginia Governor [[Terry McAuliffe]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/proclamations/proclamation/2017-national-beer-day/&lt;/ref&gt;

National Beer Day was officially recognized on the Congressional Record by Congressman [[Dave Brat]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2017/4/6/extensions-of-remarks-section/article/E475-5&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, House Joint Resolution 90 was introduced in Virginia General Assembly to officially recognize National Beer Day in the Commonwealth of Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+HJ90&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Institutes of Health''' ('''NIH''') is the national health research center of the [[Philippines]] that is responsible for [[biomedicine|biomedical]] and [[public health]] research.

== History ==

The National Institutes of Health was created on January 26, 1996 by the UP Board of Regents to enhance research undertakings of [[University of the Philippines Manila|UP Manila]] with regards to public health. It serves as an institutional home of a network of researchers and research institutions. Eventually, NIH was established as the national health research center of the Philippines through the Health Research and Development Act of 1998, otherwise known as Republic Act 8503.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nih.upm.edu.ph/about-nih/historical-highlights |title=Historical Highlights |publisher=University of the Philippines Manila National Institutes of Health |access-date=October 26, 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Patient Safety Foundation''' (NPSF) was an independent not-for-profit organization created in 1997 to engage key stakeholders to advance patient safety and health care workforce safety and disseminate strategies to prevent harm.

In May 2017, the '''[http://www.ihi.org Institute for Healthcare Improvement]''' (IHI) and NPSF began working together as one organization. The merged entity is committed to using its combined knowledge and resources to focus and energize the patient safety agenda in order to build systems of safety across the continuum of care.

==History==

The National Patient Safety Foundation began as an idea proposed in 1996 at a large conference on medical error that was organized by the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA), and the Annenberg Center for Health Sciences at [[Eisenhower Medical Center]] in [[California]] and funded by [[The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]]. At that meeting, representatives of the AMA announced plans to form a foundation that would be "a collaborative initiative involving all members of the healthcare community aimed at stimulating leadership, fostering awareness, and enhancing patient safety knowledge creation, dissemination and implementation."

Among the foundation's early activities was a survey of public opinion of patient safety issues. The survey, conducted by [[Louis Harris &amp; Associates]] (2000) revealed that more than 4 out of 5 respondents (84%) had heard about a situation where a medical mistake had been made. More than one-third of respondents (42%) had been involved, either personally or through a friend or relative, in a situation where a [[medical error]] was made.&lt;ref name="Louis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihi.org/about/news/Documents/Public_Opinion_of_Patient_Safety_Issues_1997.pdf|title=Public Opinion of Patient Safety Issues|last=Louis Harris &amp; Associates|first=|date=September 1997|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, NPSF formed the Lucian Leape Institute, a think tank named for renowned patient safety leader, Dr. [[Lucian Leape]]. The Lucian Leape Institute's charter is "to identify new approaches to improving patient safety, call for the innovation necessary to expedite the work, create significant, sustainable improvements in culture, process, and outcomes, and encourage key stakeholders to assume significant roles in advancing patient safety."&lt;ref name="NPSFLLI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihi.org/Engage/Initiatives/Lucian-Leape-Institute/Pages/default.aspx|title=Lucian Leape Institute at NPSF|last=National Patient Safety Foundation|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 2017 merger with IHI, the Lucian Leape Institute continues this work as a program within IHI's overall safety work.

==Research==

Part of the NPSF mission was to identify and create "a core body of knowledge" about patient safety. To that end, the NPSF Research Grants Program began in 1998, with support provided by members of the NPSF [[Board of Directors]]. The program's objective was "to promote studies leading to the prevention of human errors, system errors, patient injuries, and the consequences of such [[adverse events]] in the health care setting."

Overall during the program's existence, NPSF funded 39 research projects investigating areas such as medication errors, systems design, and diagnostic errors. More than 200 papers and presentations resulting either directly or indirectly from this work have been published in academic journals and presented at national and international conferences. The last published research grants progress report (2012) details the grant projects and subsequent research.**&lt;ref name=NPSFRGS&gt;{{cite web|last=National Patient Safety Foundation|title=Research Grants Programs: Summary of Progress|url=http://www.npsf.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/NPSF_Research_Grants_Summary_2012_web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and Professional Development==

Educating [[health professionals]] about patient safety best practices is a key area of focus for NPSF. Since the annual NPSF Patient Safety Congress has brought together health leaders, patient safety professionals, and patient advocates.  In recent years, the meeting has touched on some of the most pressing concerns in health care, such as the move toward patient satisfaction as a measure of quality,&lt;ref name=BUSH11&gt;{{cite web|last=Bush|first=Haydn|title=How Important is Patient Satisfaction?|url=http://www.hhnmag.com/hhnmag/HHNDaily/HHNDailyDisplay.dhtml?id=7020009788#.T9ZVlgszbYg.bitly|work=Hospitals &amp; Health Networks|date=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  engaging patients and families in their care,&lt;ref name=BUSH2&gt;{{cite web|last=Bush|first=Haydn|title=A Checklist That's Just for Patients|url=http://www.hhnmag.com/hhnmag/HHNDaily/HHNDailyDisplay.dhtml?id=6200006813#.T9ZU7YMwS44.bitly|work=Hospitals &amp; Health Networks|date=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the use of simulation to teach and promote safe practices.&lt;ref name=SAN&gt;{{cite web|last=Santamour|first=Bill|title=How to Fundamentally Improve Performance (Without Harming Patients)|url=http://www.hhnmag.com/hhnmag/HHNDaily/HHNDailyDisplay.dhtml?id=5790001923|work=Hospitals &amp; Health Networks|date=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the foundation's recent areas of focus is elevating patient safety as a medical discipline and a career path for medical professionals.&lt;ref name=SHER&gt;{{cite web|last=Sheridan|first=Terry|title=Safety Specialists: A New Career for Experienced Nurses|url=http://career-news.allhealthcarejobs.com/2012/08/23/safety-specialists-a-new-career-for-experienced-nurses/|work=Health Callings: Jobs That Matter|date=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Society of Professionals in Patient Safety, which was formed in January 2011, was introduced as the first such organization for individuals (as opposed to organizations) seeking to immerse themselves in a community of like-minded professionals.&lt;ref name=GIBB&gt;{{cite web|last=Gibbons|first=Michael|title=Safety First: The Work of Patient Safety|url=http://nursing.advanceweb.com/Columns/Safety-First/The-Work-of-Patient-Safety.aspx|work=Advance for Nurses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NPSF was instrumental in creating the Certification Board for Professionals in Patient Safety. Established in 2012, the CBPPS is an independent body charged with developing and overseeing a credentialing exam for the patient safety field.&lt;ref name=CBPPS&gt;{{cite web|title=About Certification|url=http://www.npsf.org/?page=aboutcbpps|work=Certification Board for Professionals in Patient Safety}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pontiac fever'''  is an acute, nonfatal respiratory disease caused by various species of [[Gram-negative bacteria]] in the genus ''[[Legionella]]''. It causes a mild upper respiratory infection that resembles acute influenza. Pontiac fever resolves spontaneously and often goes undiagnosed. Both Pontiac fever and the more severe [[Legionnaire's disease]] are caused by the same bacteria, but Pontiac fever does not include pneumonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/PontiacFever/GeneralInformation/ |title=General Information- Pontiac Fever |publisher=HPA |date= |accessdate=2013-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/191/9/1530.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/184/10/1289.full |title=Pontiac Fever Due to Legionella micdadei from a Whirlpool Spa: Possible Role of Bacterial Endotoxin |publisher=Jid.oxfordjournals.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://legionellacontrol.com/legionella/pontiac-fever-legionnaires-disease/ |title=General Information- Pontiac Fever &amp; Legionnaires’ Disease |publisher=Legionellacontrol |date= |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pontiac fever was named for [[Pontiac, Michigan]], where the first case was recognized. In 1968, several workers at the county's department of health came down with a fever and mild flu symptoms, but not pneumonia. After the [[1976 Philadelphia Legionnaires' disease outbreak|1976 Legionnaires' outbreak in Philadelphia]], the Michigan health department re-examined blood samples and discovered the workers had been infected with the newly identified ''[[Legionella pneumophila]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/01/health/01docs.html|title=In Philadelphia 30 Years Ago, an Eruption of Illness and Fear|date=1 August 2006|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biocentral.com/1471-2458/6/112 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727065410/http://www.biocentral.com/1471-2458/6/112 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-07-27 |title=biocentral.com |publisher=biocentral.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An outbreak caused by'' Legionella micdadei'' in early 1988 in the UK became known as [[Lochgoilhead]] fever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(89)91319-6 | title=LOCHGOILHEAD FEVER: OUTBREAK OF NON-PNEUMONIC LEGIONELLOSIS DUE TO LEGIONELLA MICDADEI | journal=The Lancet | date=1989 | volume=333 | issue=8633 | pages=316–318 | first=DavidJ. | last=Goldberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, other species of ''Legionella'' that cause Pontiac fever have been identified, most notably in New Zealand, in 2007 where ''[[Legionella longbeachae]]'' was discovered. The New Zealand outbreak also marked the first time Pontiac fever had been traced to potting soil.

==Cause==
Species of ''Legionella'' known to cause Pontiac fever include ''[[Legionella pneumophila]]'', ''[[Legionella longbeachae]]'', ''[[Legionella feeleii]]'', ''Legionella micdadei'', and ''[[Legionella anisa]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phin|first1=Nick|title=Epidemiology and clinical management of Legionnaires' disease|journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases|date=2014|volume=14|issue=10|pages=1011–1021|doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(14)70713-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reservoir===
Sources of the causative agents are aquatic systems and potting soil. The first outbreak caused by inhalation of [[Aerosolization|aerosolized]] potting soil was discovered in New Zealand in January 2007. A total of 10 workers at a nursery came down with Pontiac fever. It was the first identification of ''L. longbeachae''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= An outbreak of Pontiac fever due to Legionella longbeachae serogroup 2 found in potting mix in a horticultural nursery in New Zealand|date=2013-01-30 |pmid=19781115 | doi=10.1017/S0950268809990835 |volume=138 |issue=1 |vauthors=Cramp GJ, Harte D, Douglas NM, Graham F, Schousboe M, Sykes K |journal=Epidemiol. Infect. |pages=15–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transmission===
Pontiac fever does not spread from person to person. It is acquired through aersolization of water droplets and/or potting soil containing ''Legionella'' bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Lauri A. Hicks |author2=Laurel E. Garrison |url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2012/chapter-3-infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/legionellosis-legionnaires-disease-and-pontiac-fever.htm |title=Legionellosis (Legionnaires’ Disease &amp; Pontiac Fever) - Chapter 3 - 2012 Yellow Book - Travelers' Health - CDC |publisher=C.cdc.gov |date=2011-07-01 |accessdate=2013-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Pontiac fever is known to have a short incubation period of 1 to 3 days. No fatalities have been reported and cases resolve spontaneously without treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/clinicians.html |title=Legionella (Legionnaires' Disease and Pontiac Fever |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=CDC |publisher=Centers for Fisease Control and Prevention |access-date=4 June 2014 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often not reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pancer K, Stypulkowska-Misiurewicz H | year = 2003 | title = Pontiac fever – non-pneumonic legionellosis | url = | journal = Przegl Epidemiol | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 607–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Age, gender, and smoking do not seem to be risk factors. Pontiac fever seems to affect young people in the age medians of 29, 30, and 32. Pathogenesis of the Pontiac fever is poorly known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fraser DW, Deubner DC, Hill DL, Gilliam DK | year = 1979 | title = Nonpneumonic, short-incubation-period Legionellosis (Pontiac fever) in men who cleaned a steam turbine condenser | url = | journal = Science | volume = 205 | issue = | pages = 690–1 | doi=10.1126/science.462175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major objectives of PMKSY ==

* Convergence of investment in irrigation at the field level.
* Expand cultivable area under irrigation (हर खेत को पानी). 
* Improve On-farm water use efficiency to reduce wastage of water .
* Enhance the adoption of preciso in irrigation and other water saving technologies(more crop per drop).
* Enhance recharge of aquifers and introduce sustainable water conservation practice.

==Purpose==
The primary objectives of PMKSY are to attract investments in irrigation system at field level, develop and expand cultivable land in the country, enhance ranch water use in order to minimize wastage of water, enhance crop per drop by implementing water-saving technologies and precision irrigation. The plan additionally calls for bringing ministries, offices, organizations, research and financial institutions occupied with creation and recycling of water under one platform so that an exhaustive and holistic outlook of the whole [[water cycle]] is considered. The goal is to open the doors for optimal water budgeting in all sectors.Tagline for PMKSY is "more crop per drop".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Centre to spend Rs 5,300 crore under  Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-centre-to-spend-Rs-5,300-crore-under-Pradhan-mantri-krishi-sinchai-yojana-2101066 |work=[[Daily News and Analysis]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative religious coping (or [[spiritual struggle]]s) expresses conflict, question, and doubt regarding issues of God and faith.

The effects of religious coping are measured in many different circumstances, each with different outcomes. Some common experiences where people use religious coping are fear-inflicting events such as 9/11 or the holocaust, death and sickness, and near death experiences. Research also shows that people also use religious coping to deal with everyday stressors in addition to life-changing traumas. The underlying assumption of the ability of religion to influence the coping process lies in the hypothesis that religion is more than a [[defence mechanism]] as it was viewed by [[Sigmund Freud]]. Rather than inspiring denial, religion stimulates reinterpretations of negative events through the sacred lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krok|first1=D|title=The mediating role of coping in the relationships between religiousness and mental health (2014)|publisher=Archives of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles of religious coping==
[[Kenneth Pargament]] is the author of the book ''[[Psychology of Religion and Coping]]'' and a leading researcher in religious coping. Along with developing the "RCOPE" questionnaire to measure religious coping strategies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pargament | first1 = Kenneth I. | last2 = Koenig | first2 = Harold G. | last3 = Perez | first3 = Lisa M. | year = 2000 | title = The many methods of religious coping: Development and initial validation of the RCOPE | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 56 | issue = 4| pages = 519–543 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4679(200004)56:4&lt;519::AID-JCLP6&gt;3.0.CO;2-1 | pmid = 10775045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pargament and his colleagues designated three basic styles of coping with stress.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth I. Pargament, Joseph Kennell, William Hathaway, Nancy Grevengoed, Jon Newman &amp; Wendy Jones (1988). Religion and the problem-solving process: Three styles of coping. Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, v27 n1, pp90-104. ISSN 0021-8294&lt;/ref&gt; In Pargament's article "Religion and the Problem-Solving Process: Three Styles of Coping", he identifies the collaborative, self-directed, and deferring coping styles. The collaborative style of religious coping involves an active and internalized personal exchange with God. The deferring coping style is when individuals rely heavily on God and delegate their stress without taking personal responsibility for the situation. The self-directed style of religious coping emphasizes the free will given by God that allows for the individual to solve the problem on their own. The collaborative style of coping has been found to produce the most advantages in clinical settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Phillips | first1 = III | last2 = Lynn | first2 = Q. K. | last3 = Crossley | first3 = C. D. | last4 = Pargament | first4 = K. I. | year = 2004 | title = Self-Directing Religious Coping: A Deistic God, Abandoning God, or No God at All? | url = | journal = Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion | volume = 43 | issue = 3| pages = 409–418 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2004.00243.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a meta-analysis of 49 studies reviewing religion as a coping method, several mechanisms of positive coping were identified. Several are listed below.
* religious purification/forgiveness
* religious direction/conversion
* seeking support from clergy members
* spiritual connection
In the same study, negative coping strategies were also pinpointed. Some of them are listed below.
* spiritual discontent
* punishing God reappraisal
* reappraisal of God's powers
* pleading for direct intercession
The study then identified forms of positive psychological adjustment, like those listed below.
* acceptance
* happiness
* optimism
* purpose in life
A similar list of negative psychological adjustments was compiled.
* anxiety
* burden
* negative mood
* callousness
Positive religious coping methods correlated more strongly with positive psychological adjustment than negative psychological adjustment. Similarly, negative religious coping methods correlated with negative psychological adjustment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ano|first1=Gene|last2=Vasconcelles|first2=Erin|title=Religious Coping and Psychological Adjustment to Stress: A Meta-Analysis|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|date=2005|volume=61|issue=4|pages=461–80|doi=10.1002/jclp.20049|pmid=15503316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific traumatic events==

===September 11 attacks===
The [[September 11 attacks]] have been widely studied among psychologists. Research has shown that 90% of Americans coped with the stress of September 11 (2001) by "turning to religion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koenig|first1=Harold G|title=Research on Religion, Spirituality, and Mental Health: A Review|journal=The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry|volume=54|issue=5|pages=283–291|doi=10.1177/070674370905400502|pmid=19497160|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty-two percent of a sample of undergraduate and graduate students reported praying to cope with the stress that followed the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stein | first1 = BD | last2 = Elliott | first2 = MN | last3 = Jaycox | first3 = LH | display-authors = etal | year = 2004 | title = A national longitudinal study of the psychological consequences of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks: reactions, impairment, and help-seeking | url = | journal = Psychiatry | volume = 67 | issue = 2| pages = 105–117 | doi=10.1521/psyc.67.2.105.35964| pmid = 15262576 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further analysis showed that searching for spiritual meaning was associated with less anxiety and depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ai | first1 = AL | last2 = Cascio | first2 = T | last3 = Santangelo | first3 = LK | display-authors = etal | year = 2005 | title = Hope, meaning, and growth following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks | url = | journal = J Interpers Violence | volume = 20 | issue = 5| pages = 523–548 | doi=10.1177/0886260504272896| pmid = 15788553 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists also examined the types of coping used and how they affected mental health outcomes. Research shows that people who used positive religious coping displayed greater optimism, less anxiety, and higher levels of positive emotion three months after the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ai | first1 = AL | last2 = Tice | first2 = TN | last3 = Peterson | first3 = C | display-authors = etal | year = 2005 | title = Prayers, spiritual support, and positive attitudes in coping with the September 11 national crisis | url = | journal = J Pers | volume = 73 | issue = 3| pages = 763–791 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2005.00328.x| pmid = 15854013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who used positive religious coping were found to have significantly more positive outcomes (closeness with God, relationships with family and friends) than those who used negative religious coping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pargament | first1 = KI | last2 = Ishler | first2 = K | last3 = Dubow | first3 = EF | display-authors = etal | year = 1994 | title = Methods of religious coping with the Gulf War: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses | url = | journal = J Sci Study Relig | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 347–361 | doi=10.2307/1386494| jstor = 1386494 }}&lt;/ref&gt; American Muslims were another highly studied group after the attacks. Results in this area align with previous research, showing that positive religious coping is associated with posttraumatic growth, while negative religious coping predicted higher levels of depression and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abu-Raiya | first1 = H. | last2 = Pargament | first2 = K. I. | last3 = Mahoney | first3 = A. | year = 2010 | title = Examining coping methods with stressful interpersonal events experienced by Muslims living in the United States following the 9/11 attacks | url = | journal = Psychology of Religion and Spirituality | volume = 3| issue = | pages = 1–14| doi = 10.1037/a0020034 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of a loved one===

Individuals deal with the death of significant people in their lives in a variety of ways. One of the most common ways that Americans deal with the death of a loved one is by turning to religion. Although most psychologists would argue that religious coping leads to positive outcomes, some research identifies that coping using religious can lead to greater amounts of distress, especially in dealing with the loss of a family member due to homicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = M. P. | last2 = Vardaman | first2 = P. J. | year = 1997 | title = The role of religion in coping with the loss of a family member to homicide | url = | journal = Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 44–51 | doi = 10.2307/1387881 | jstor = 1387881 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research recognized that the role of attachment to God is very important in determining how successful religious coping will be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ungureanu | first1 = I. | last2 = Sandberg | first2 = J. G. | year = 2010 | title = Broken together": Spirituality and religion as coping strategies for couples dealing with the death of a child: A literature review with clinical implications | url = | journal = Contemporary Family Therapy: An International Journal | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 302–319 | doi = 10.1007/s10591-010-9120-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that secure attachment to God and a positive religious coping style is positively correlated with stress related growth, positive religious outcomes, and a developed sense of meaning. Anxious and avoidant attachments to God and negative religious coping styles were positively correlated with depression, traumatic distress, and separation distress. Furthermore, attachment to God was strongly more correlated to positive outcomes than attachment to others.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, M. M. (2003, April). Bereavement and grief related to a significant death: A psychological and theological study of attachment styles and religious coping. Dissertation Abstracts International Section A, 63,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Near-death experiences===

[[Near-death experiences]] (NDEs) provide a unique opportunity for psychologists to study the way in which people cope with their own death. NDEs generally trigger an out-of-body experience into a realm populated with spiritual beings and have the potential to shape American attitudes toward death in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kwilecki | first1 = S | year = 2004 | title = Religion and Coping: A Contribution from Religious Studies | url = | journal = Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion | volume = 43 | issue = 4| pages = 477–489 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-5906.2004.00250.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys show that five percent of Americans have a NDE, which presents a limited field to study.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, L. W. and J. Yates. (1996.) Introduction. In the near-death experience: A reader, edited by L. W. Bailey and J. Yates, pp. 1–23. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, people who have NDEs report positive outcomes including reduced anxiety, increased capacity to love, and a higher sense of meaning and purpose in life.&lt;ref&gt;Atwater, P. M. H. (1994). Beyond the light: The mysteries and revelations of near-death experiences. New York: Avon Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who have NDEs often fall into Pargament's category of transformative coping. In these cases, the person is transformed into a whole new way of life and way of thinking by one supernatural experience.&lt;ref&gt;Pargament, K. I. (1997). The psychology of religion and coping: Theory, research, practice. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Using religious coping in school and work ==

=== MindUP Initiative ===
Twelve years ago Goldie Hawn founded MindUP: a mindfulness based initiative to help students in schools deal with stress.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, E. (2015, Feb 17). Can 'mindfulness' help students do better in school? advocates say the meditation technique raises focus and lowers stress. critics see religion in disguise. Wall Street Journal (Online)&lt;/ref&gt; The program has since been implemented in schools in 28 states, and has locations in Canada, China, Serbia, Australia, and Venezuela. The program invites students to participate in 15 lessons based on neuroscience. Kimberly Schonert-Reichl an employee of MindsUP and of the University of British Columbia evaluated the effectiveness of MindUP on students grades 4 through 5. Her findings are shown below:

* 82% of children reported having a more positive outlook
* 81% of children learned to make themselves happy
* 58% of children tried to help others more often

Even though MindUP has had very positive effects skeptics call it religion in disguise. They claim that the mindfulness exercises such as "belly breaths" are [[Buddhist]] practices as a different name. In some states MindUP has been removed from schools because schools are supposed to be secular and non-religious.

===Religion as buffer in the workplace===
A study was conducted by Dr Roxane Gervais, a senior psychologist at the Health and Safety Laboratory in Stockport.&lt;ref&gt;Religion forms buffer against work stress. (2014, Jan 09). Telegraph.Co.Uk&lt;/ref&gt; She found that people who were more actively religious were more likely to report low levels of anxiety, depression and fatigue and also felt a higher presence of meaning in life. These people also took less sick days. She concluded that employers should accommodate time for employees to engage in religious beliefs while at work in order to improve performance.

==Religious coping in clinical settings==
Despite the problems encountered when studying religion as a coping mechanism, much research suggests that using it in intervention settings when applicable may be beneficial. For example, according to a study be Wachholtz and Pargament, when identified religious people suffering from splitting migraines were exposed to meditations with religious or non-religious content, they reported less pain after the religious meditations. Such "psychospiritual" methods have been utilized for a while, although their applications are limited and specific from person to person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gall|first1=Terry Lynn|last2=Guirguis-Younger|first2=Manal|title=Religious and Spiritual Coping: Current Theory and Research|date=2013|publisher=American Psychology Association|pages=356–357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion vs. spirituality==
Research in the psychology of religion often reveals different outcomes between [[religion]] and [[spirituality]]. A person's religion is a collection of belief systems and moral values, often established by a governing institution. Religion is generally more traditional, organized, and sociological. Religion is considered to be more formal and upheld than spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bryant-Davis|first1=T.|last2=Wong|first2=E. C.|title=Faith to move mountains: Religious coping, spirituality, and interpersonal trauma recovery (2013)|publisher=American Psychologist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spirituality, on the other hand, is a measure of one's intrinsic relationship with their God. Spirituality is viewed and studied as being more free-formed and psychological. Also, spirituality is considered to be a private experience that promotes a process of growing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bryant-Davis|first1=T.|last2=Wong|first2=E. C.|title=Faith to move mountains: Religious coping, spirituality, and interpersonal trauma recovery (2013)|publisher=American Psychologist}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the psychology of coping with trauma, religion and spirituality can play very different roles. Some research shows that religion, but not spirituality can help with coping,&lt;ref&gt;Rees, Tomas. (2012). Religion, but not spirituality, helps protect against post-earthquake trauma. Epiphenom.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas other shows that intrinsic spirituality can be a very effective style of coping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vespa | first1 = A. | last2 = Jacobsen | first2 = P. B. | last3 = Spazzafumo | first3 = L. | last4 = Balducci | first4 = L. | year = 2011 | title = Evaluation of intrapsychic factors, coping styles, and spirituality of patients affected by tumors | url = | journal = Psycho-Oncology | volume = 20 | issue = 1| pages = 5–11 | doi = 10.1002/pon.1719 | pmid = 20336646 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The differences found between religious and spiritual coping may be further evidence of the role of attachment styles and types of coping used. Through religious and spiritual coping, individuals can derive support from a divine being, from other members of a religious congregation, and from making meaning of distressing events, which can lead to the promotion of resilience, healing, and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bryant-Davis|first1=T.|last2=Wong|first2=E. C.|title=Faith to move mountains: Religious coping, spirituality, and interpersonal trauma recovery (2013)|publisher=American Psychologist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems with studying religious coping==
Studying religion as a coping mechanism has proved a difficult task for psychologists. Religion seems to be an integral part of some people's lives but not of others, so specialists cannot be certain whether religion is the variable to study or if there is something about religious people that makes them religious that is worth studying. Many studies only measure the frequency of certain "religious" activities including prayer or religious service attendance; however, just because a person exhibits religious behavior does not mean that he or she uses his or her religion to cope or even adheres to the set of beliefs that constitutes a religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ano|first1=Gene|last2=Vasconcelles|first2=Erin|title=Religious Coping and Psychological Adjustment to Stress: A Meta-Analysis|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|date=2005|volume=61|issue=4|pages=461–480|doi=10.1002/jclp.20049|pmid=15503316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the research done on religion and coping has been isolated to Christianity. Studies are being conducted to accommodate for the diversity of religions and their differences among cultures.

Many studies on the subject show contrary results. For example, some psychologists conclude that religiosity has no positive or negative outcomes at all and others cite that any form of religious coping has ultimately negative effects. These results may be a product of the inconsistencies in the ways that religion is studied as a coping mechanism or could reflect biases of researchers toward a certain religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gall|first1=Terry Lynn|last2=Guirguis-Younger|first2=Manal|title=Religious and Spiritual Coping: Current Theory and Research|date=2013|publisher=American Psychology Association|page=351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Status Anxiety''''' is a [[nonfiction]] book by [[Alain de Botton]]. It was first published in 2004 by [[Hamish Hamilton]]; subsequent publications have been by [[Penguin Books]].

==Central thesis==
Status Anxiety is a 21st Century phenomenon which is a result of [[capitalism]], [[democracy]], and an ostensibly egalitarian society, and is prevalent in countries where an [[income inequality|inequality in income]] is evident. Status Anxiety can be defined as the constant tension or fear of being perceived as "unsuccessful" by the society in materialistic terms. It was coined by the Swiss-born British philosopher and author [[Alain de Botton]] in his book "Status Anxiety". Today, every individual constantly tries to outsmart the others to climb up the social ladder. The effects of status anxiety can be [[impulse buying]], [[status consumption]] etc.
[[Meritocracy]] is a primary cause of status anxiety. Meritocracy is a society that believes that only the talented and the meritorious will end up at the top of the social ladder. Snobbery, envy, lovelessness are some other causes of status anxiety.

De Botton first noticed this phenomenon among the wealthy families of America. The Americans had a lavish lifestyle and most of it was just to make the "neighbours" envious. America had also witnessed the trend of "Famous for being famous". Botton even met the American motivational speaker [[Leslie C. Brown|Les Brown]] to know how motivational speaking works. He concluded that motivational speakers conducted their speeches to induce status anxiety among individuals. Motivational speaking is based on the fact that "No one is living up to their true potential and everyone has scope for improvement. De Botton challenged this and asked "What about those who want to achieve but lack the opportunities to do so?"

De Botton lays out the causes of and solutions to status anxiety as follows:

'''Causes:'''
* [[Love]]lessness
* [[Expectation (epistemic)|Expectation]]
* [[Meritocracy]]
* [[Snobbery]]
* Dependence

'''Solutions:'''
* [[Philosophy]]
* [[Art]]
* [[Politics]]
* [[Religion]]
* [[Bohemianism]]

==Film==
A two-hour [[documentary film]] about this [[thesis]], also called ''Status Anxiety'' and written by Alain de Botton, was released in 2004. A version of it was shown in 2008 on [[Public Broadcasting Service]] channels like [[Boston]] [[WGBH-TV]]'s digital channel [[WGBX-TV]] in the United States.

'''''The Disability Rag''''' (also known as ''Ragged Edge'' magazine) was a periodical published between 1980 and 2004 as a subscription-based print publication, and as an online publication from 1997 to 2007. In addition to covering the [[disability in the United States|U. S. disability rights movement]], ''The Rag'', as it was usually called, published a wide range of articles and opinion pieces from individuals with disabilities.  It was  considered one of the most important publications of the disability rights movement.&lt;ref name="wp11Jan1985"&gt;{{cite news|last1=James|first1=Frank E|title=Why a Magazine for Disabled Ignores Handicapped Heroes|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=January 11, 1985|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The not-for-profit Advocado Press was incorporated in 1981 to serve as publisher of ''The Rag''. The Advocado Press also published a number of books and monographs on disability issues.

==Early history==

''The Disability Rag's'' first issue - a 4-page bifold produced at a quick-print shop - published in January, 1980 in Louisville KY, with both news items for the local disability activism community in Louisville and a first-person account of "living like a refugee" as a person with a disability. The publication was the effort of two Louisville women who were active in local disability organizations: Cass Irvin, a polio survivor who believed that "there needed to be some way for [disabled] people to connect" &lt;ref name="wp6Nov1986"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Streitfeld|first1=David|title=Puncturing The Pathos for The Disabled|publisher=The Washington Post|date=November 6, 1986 |page=D5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mary Johnson, who was non-disabled and had a background in public relations. In 1994 Irvin was cited as one of 50 "American Heroines" by the Ladies Home Journal, in part for her work with ''The Rag''. &lt;ref name="wp11Jan1985" /&gt; After a few years ''The Rag'' began to get national attention due to the efforts of Irvin, who was active in the  [[American_Coalition_of_Citizens_with_Disabilities|American Coalition of Citizens with Disabilities]] (ACCD).

''The Disability Rag's'' national growth was accelerated in 1985 by a front page ''Wall Street Journal'' article.&lt;ref name="wp11Jan1985" /&gt; As it became a national periodical of the disability movement, it addressed the disability community's concerns about both personal and public issues.&lt;ref name="Scotch"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scotch|first1=Richard K.|title=From good will to civil rights : transforming federal disability policy|date=2001|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9781566398961|page=182|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1439901007|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Rag'' was a hybrid: both a news magazine, with coverage of emerging activism local and nationwide, and an opinion journal. In an era before social media, its articles by leading disability rights figures and a large and lively letters to the editor section debated the disability rights policy issues of the times as activists proposed, argued about and worked out ideology and strategies. ''The Rag'' covered the full range of disability political issues from charity telethons to physician assisted suicide to protests over inaccessible public transit. When [[ADAPT]] started a national activist effort to change public transit policy, ''The Rag'' provided continuing coverage of the activists and the issue, and the coverage was collected and published as [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0962706493 ''To Ride the Public's Buses: The Fight that Built A Movement''], The Advocado Press's first "''Disability Rag'' Reader."

[[File:Disability Rat Tries to Ride Again.jpg|thumb|left|'Disability Rat Rides Again']]Another ongoing issue for ''The Rag'' was media coverage: it consistently railed against or poked fun at what it considered detrimental or misguided coverage of disabled people. Two ongoing features of the magazine - "Myth &amp; Media" and "We Wish We Wouldn't See..." - critiqued the typical coverage of disabled people as either heroes and "overcomers" or victims of disease, and skewered ads for cosmetic surgery&lt;ref name="wp6Nov1986" /&gt; or from fundraising charities which used disability as tragedy to open purse strings. &lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Nelson|editor1-first=Jack A.|title=The disabled, the media, and the information age|date=1994|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn. [u.a.]|isbn=0313284725|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0313284725|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It urged readers to view themselves not as victims of tragedy but survivors facing discrimination and barriers, which could be removed by society. It urged its readers to wake up to the fact that their lives could be better without cures if they would just fight for access and accommodation. The recurring cartoon feature "Disability Rat," kept up the theme. The Wall Street Journal told readers about the "wheelchair-riding rodent who, irked at having his handicapped-parking space swiped, blows up the offending vehicle." And ''The Rag'' was not shy about pointing out the value of its ideology: "Start Reading ''The Rag'' and start to think" was a slogan of early subscription ads.

==Role in self-identity and culture==

''The Rag'' served as a national forum as activists and leading thinkers and scholars of disability rights submitted articles and reacted to items and reader letters published in ''The Rag'', and it grew to become an important outlet for creative expressions of disability culture, including essays, fiction, poetry and artwork reflecting the experience of disability.&lt;ref name="Scotch"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (In 1994 The Advocado Press issued an anthology of much of this writing as ''The Ragged Edge'' anthology.) &lt;ref name="Shaw1994"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Shaw|editor1-first=Barrett|title=The Ragged Edge : The Disability Experience from the Pages of the First Fifteen Years of The Disability Rag|date=1994|publisher=Advocado Press|location=Louisville, KY|isbn=0962706450}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Mike Ervin, reviewing the book in [[''The Progressive'']] magazine, called ''The Rag'' "the gimp-radical's bible."&lt;ref name="Ervin1995"&gt;Ervin, Mike. "Exposing Disability Bigotry"  ,  ''[[The Progressive]]'', June, 1995, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many disabled people first learned about [[disability culture]] through ''The Disability Rag'', including Stephen E Brown, who wrote that "''The Disability Rag'' published stories by kindred spirits" and noted that he "wanted to write for it one day."&lt;ref name="DSQ"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Steven E|title=Disability Culture and the ADA|journal=Disability Studies Quarterly|date=2015|volume=35|issue=3|url=http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/4936/4062|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bob Ruffner, then the director of public affairs for the [[President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities]], called ''The Rag'' "a strong voice for those who may not be associated with a lot of well-organized groups.

"It's very forceful in arguing that disabled people should get their heads out of the clouds and confront society with their needs," he said, adding that "utopian ideas - ideas that can be translated into social action - start in places like ''The Rag''.

"How else can you build a movement among people who have been left out? Its purpose is to build a fire," he told ''The Washington Post'' in 1986.&lt;ref name="wp6Nov1986" /&gt;

==Criticisms==

''The Rag'' was considered "well left of center on the political spectrum."&lt;ref name="wp6Nov1986" /&gt; Because of its "take no prisoners" tone, ''The Rag'' was frequently criticized. Some felt its "strident, shoot from the hip approach" was counterproductive; that its accusatory tone diminished the impact of its message.&lt;ref name="wp6Nov1986" /&gt; Other readers complained that it lacked humor.&lt;ref name="Ervin1995" /&gt;

[[File:Cover, Disability Rag July 1981.png|thumb|203x203px|Cover of the July 1981 issue]]Many had serious reservations about the ferocity of its disability pride message, which they felt went too far when it eschewed the concept of cure.  The fact that ''The Rag'' celebrated disability to the extent that it frequently took stances against charity appeals for cures, such as telethons, rubbed critics the wrong way.&lt;ref name="wp6Nov1986" /&gt;

And because ''The Rag'' was not loathe to call out those in the disability movement whom it considered "Uncle Tiny Tims" or opinions of leaders that it considered bad disability politics, disability movement activists fumed when they found themselves in firing range.&lt;ref name="wp11Jan1985" /&gt; &lt;ref name="wp6Nov1986" /&gt;

==Growth and changes==

As ''The Rag's'' reach grew, it hired a circulation manager and acquired an office. By 1990, The Advocado Press employed several staff members, for both editorial and circulation, for ''The Rag''.

Mary Johnson, ''The Rag's'' longtime editor, left in 1993 and the editorship passed to Dave Matheis. Barrett Shaw took over as editor in 1994, to be succeeded by Eric Francis in 1996.  In 1997, Johnson returned as editor and remained in that position until print publication ceased at the end of 2004. 

In 1989 ''The Disability Rag'' changed its masthead to ''The Disability Rag and Resource'', and in 1995 changed its name to ''Ragged Edge'' magazine at the launch of its website, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160307021926/http://ragged-edge-mag.com/ Ragged Edge Online]. It began experimenting with color covers, and grew to around 6,000 paying subscribers.

Fundraising efforts by its nonprofit Advocado Press starting in the mid 1980s resulted in a number of financial gifts both from longtime members and various progressive and activist groups. The Advocado Press received grants for its work on media and disability.

The Advocado Press published ''Reporting on Disability: Approaches and Issues'' (1989) ''Strange People with Books'' (by Nancy Gall-Clayton, 1990), and ''Media Savvy: A Self-Training Curriculum'' (1991),&lt;ref name=CLIO&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pelka|first1=Fred|title=The ABC-CLIO companion to the disability rights movements|date=1997|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=9780874368345|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QfBGAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=17 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|173}} as

''The Ragged Edge'' magazine published as a periodical through 2003. In 2004, the Advocado Press published three larger issues called "Ragged Edge Readers" and at the end of 2004 ceased print publication, although the Ragged Edge Online website continued to feature new material for two more years.

==Awards and recognitions==

In 1993 ''The Disability Rag'' won the ''Utne Reader'' Alternative Press Award for Best Special Interest Publication:&lt;ref name=CLIO/&gt;{{rp|99}} The magazine was "cogent, outspoken, and joyfully resistant to stereotyping, its pages feature scathing satire and clearheaded thinking," according to Utne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Utne Reader|date=2002|publisher=Lens Publishing Company|page=88|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W4D-etJzHVMC|accessdate=16 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 ''The Ragged Edge'' anthology&lt;ref name="Shaw1994" /&gt; was named an "outstanding book on the subject of human rights in North America" by the [[Gustavus Myers Center|Gustavus Myers Center for the Study of Human Rights]].

==Online presence==
The Ragged Edge website launched in 1997 as "The Electric Edge" before settling on "Ragged Edge Online."  Besides offering digital editions of the print publication, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20160307021926/http://ragged-edge-mag.com/%20Ragged%20Edge%20Online Rag website] offered news updates and expanded discussion of trending topics in the disability rights movement, and blog posts by disability activists.

'''Varilux''' is a brand name belonging to [[Essilor|Essilor International]], a producer of [[corrective lens]]es. The first version of the lens was invented by Bernard Maitenaz and released in 1959, and was the first modern [[progressive lens]] to correct [[presbyopia]]. The [[progressive lens]] is characterized by correcting near, intermediate and far vision.

==History==

=== Previous attempts to create a progressive lens===
{{main|Progressive lens}}
The first patent for a progressive lens was British Patent 15,735, granted to Own Aves with a 1907 priority date.&lt;ref&gt;Progressive powered lenses: the Minkwitz theorem Sheedy JE, Campbell C, Optom Vis Sci. 2005 Oct;82(10):916–22&lt;/ref&gt; Aves' patent included the progressive lens design and the manufacturing process. However this was unlike modern progressive lenses. It consisted of a conical back surface and a cylindrical front with opposing axes in order to create a power progression. This design was never commercialized. However, due to this patent, Essilor cannot technically be considered the creator of the first [[progressive lens]].

While there were several intermediate steps (H. Newbold appears to have designed a similar lens to Aves around 1913), there is evidence&lt;ref&gt;Bennett A. (1973) Variable and Progressive power lenses. Manufacturing Optics Int. Mar, 137–141.&lt;/ref&gt; to suggest that Duke Elder in 1922 developed the world's first commercially available progressive lens (Ultrifo) sold by "Gowlland of Montreal". This was based on an arrangement of aspherical surfaces.

===The idea===
Following in his father’s and in his grandfather’s footsteps, Bernard Maitenaz joined ''Société des Lunetiers'' (which became ''Essel'', and is now [[Essilor]]) in 1948 as a research engineer after receiving diplomas from ''École Nationale Supérieure des Arts et Métiers and Institut d’Optique''.&lt;ref&gt;Le Roux 2008, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the progressive lens came to him as he tried on his father’s [[Bifocals|bifocal lenses]]. The abrupt transition of power seemed unnatural to him, and he believed it to be more rational to use a lens that would correct far vision on the upper portion of the lens, intermediate vision in its middle part and near vision in its lower part.

On March 2, 1951, Bernard Maitenaz deposited an envelope at the ''National Institute of Industrial Property'' in [[France]] which included four drawings and mechanical data&lt;ref&gt;Le Roux 2008, p.17.&lt;/ref&gt; that would make it possible to manufacture the modern-day progressive lens. On November 25, 1953, ''Essel'' submitted a first [[patent]] on his invention.&lt;ref&gt;Le Roux 2008, p.29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The first progressive lens===
After patents and calculations, this type of progressive lens appeared to be possible, but had yet to be manufactured. Maitenaz and his team began producing progressive lenses using a variety of different improvised techniques and by 1958, ''Essel'' had developed machinery capable of mass manufacturing them.

After testing the results on 46 people in January 1959, 5 gave excellent responses, 29 good responses, 2 average responses and 10 poor responses.&lt;ref&gt;Le Roux 2008, p.49.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Varilux brand===
Closer to the product launch, numerous pricing strategies had been elaborated. In the end, Maintenaz’s invention would be fixed between ''Essel'''s bifocal lens, the '''Diachrolux''', and its trifocal lens, the '''Trilux'''. Without much brainstorming, Maintenaz’s progressive lens was given a name following suit with the other premium products: '''Varilux'''.&lt;ref&gt;Le Roux 2008, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt; The lens was launched officially in May 1959 at the [[Hotel Lutetia]] in [[Paris]], [[France]].

===International appeal===
Following the launch of Varilux, ''Essel'' set forth a plan for Varilux to be present outside France. Through a number of partnerships and distribution deals, the Varilux lens began its distribution in a number of countries in the 1960s, including the [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Brazil]] and [[Japan]].

From sales of 6,000 lenses in 1959 to 2,000,000 in 1969,&lt;ref&gt;Le Roux 2008, p.58.&lt;/ref&gt; Varilux was becoming a successful venture, but the market still had some concerns regarding the adaptation time to the lens. Still working at improving his original invention using new technologies and calculations, Maitenaz and his team were working on the design of a new progressive lens with less [[Optical aberration|aberration]], which would in theory provide a higher level of comfort to the wearer.

===Varilux 2===
At the start of 1969, two companies dominated the French ophthalmic lens market: ''Essel'' and ''Silor''. Although both had created innovations of their own (''Esse''l with Varilux and ''Silor'' with the Orma 1000 organic material), they were not major players on the international market. On January 1, 1972, ''Essel'' and ''Silor'' merged and formed '''Essilor'''.&lt;ref&gt;Le Roux 2008, p.108.&lt;/ref&gt;

With this newly formed merger, Essilor launched the '''Varilux 2''' in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;Le Roux 2008, p.111.&lt;/ref&gt; which adopted a better design than its predecessor and lighter lens material.

===The new generations of Varilux===
As new technologies and manufacturing processes were being developed, the research efforts concerning Varilux continued. In 1988, the result came with '''Varilux Multi-Design''', or VMD.&lt;ref&gt;Le Roux 2008, p.168.&lt;/ref&gt; The Multi-Design concept was a first stage of personalization of the progressive lens, a specific optimum design for each age class of the presbyopic wearer.&lt;ref name="wernerkoeppen.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wernerkoeppen.com|title=Progressive Memories &amp; Calculus - Varilux progressive spectacle lenses - Werner Köppen - Progressive Lenses|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of this decade, Essilor would become the world’s leading manufacturer in ophthalmic optical products.&lt;ref&gt;Le Roux 2008, p.146.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, '''Varilux Comfort'''&lt;ref&gt;Le Roux 2008, p.163.&lt;/ref&gt; was launched and became the world's best-selling progressive lens. Varilux Comfort represented a new concept of the progressive lens, it was the first progressive lens which combined the advantages of a "hard" design (type Varilux) and a "soft" design (type Varilux 2).&lt;ref name="wernerkoeppen.com"/&gt; The new surfacing techniques developed by Essilor made the adaptation much quicker than on previous progressive lenses and provided comfortable vision in all postures.

Finally, in the 21st century, Essilor launched '''Varilux Panamic''' (2002),&lt;ref&gt;Le Roux 2008, p.169.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Varilux Ellipse''' (2004), '''Varilux Physio''' (2006),&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Le Roux 2008, p.171.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Varilux Ipseo''' (2008).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Research &amp; Development==
With the launch of '''Varilux Comfort''' in 1993, Essilor developed the '''dioptric loop method''', making it possible to gauge wearer satisfaction. It involves using repetition until an effective result is achieved for the wearer. It comprises five stages:&lt;ref&gt;Kamen, Paddy. "Innovation Extraordinaire is Essilor". Vision Magazine. March–April 2004. July 1, 2009. [http://www.bretoncom.net/vision/2004/03/04.asp] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723032300/http://www.bretoncom.net/vision/2004/03/04.asp |date=2011-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Collection of the wearer’s physiological data
* Optical design
* Creation of prototype lenses
* Measurement control
* Clinical tests

In 2008, the '''Varilux Ipseo New Edition''' was designed using [[Essilor#Virtual reality.5B6.5D|Essilor's Virtual Reality system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.essilor.com/IMG/pdf/50thAnniversaryVarilux.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-07-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710203314/http://www.essilor.com/IMG/pdf/50thAnniversaryVarilux.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varilux Experience==
In 2008, Essilor designed the '''Varilux Experience''', a virtual simulation concept using the various ophthalmic solutions offered to presbyopes.

Varilux Experience demonstrates the technologies used to produce Varilux lenses, which are quite similar to those used in research laboratories, so as to provide an effective communication aid for optical professionals and their customers with presbyopia.

In a theater showing a 3D film, viewers wearing [[polarizer|polarized]], [[stereoscopic]] glasses follow in the footsteps of a young man with presbyopia. Stage-by-stage, he experiences the vision produced by single-vision and bifocal lenses, and then that of standard progressive lenses, and ultimately Varilux lenses.

The world premiere of Varilux Experience marked Varilux's 50th anniversary and took place at the '''SILMO optical trade fair''', which ran from October 30 to November 2, 2008 at Paris' [[Parc des expositions de la porte de Versailles|Porte de Versailles]].&lt;ref&gt;Idem&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varilux Designs==

===1959: Varilux ===
As the first progressive lens, '''Varilux''' allowed wearers with presbyopia with a correction for near vision, intermediate vision and far vision, on the same lens.

===1972: Varilux 2===
With the merger of ''Essel'' and ''Silor'' (forming [[Essilor]]), new innovations were delivered on the '''Varilux 2'''. Essilor claimed that this new lens provided increased comfort and further ease of adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;Le Roux (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===1988: Varilux Multi-Design (Varilux Infinity)===
The '''Varilux Multi-Design''' claimed to maintain the breadth of the near-vision field regardless of the addition degree.

===1993: Varilux Comfort===
As Essilor's best selling lens, the world #1 selling progressive lens the '''Varilux Comfort''' has been subject to several studies. It was the first product designed to take visual ergonomic criteria into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varilux.com/Vision%20Care%20Professionals/Products/General/Varilux%20Comfort/Introducing%20Varilux%20Comfort.htm|title=Progressive Lenses - Natural and Sharp Vision - Varilux Lenses|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000: Varilux Panamic===
The '''Varilux Panamic''' lens is based on '''Global Design Management''', a technology that manages central, peripheral and binocular vision paramenters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varilux.com/Vision%20Care%20Professionals/Products/General/Varilux%20Panamic/Optimal%20foveal%20and%20peripheral%20vision%20in%20panoramic%20fields.htm|title=Progressive Lenses - Natural and Sharp Vision - Varilux Lenses|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Water supply and women in developing countries''' is a complex topic, as lack of accessible, sufficient, clean and affordable [[water supply]] has adverse impacts specifically related to women in [[Developing country|developing nations]]. In most countries, women are the primary household members responsible for providing water for domestic consumption.&lt;ref name=UNWATER&gt;[http://www.unwater.org/downloads/EGM_report.pdf, Gender-Disaggregated Data on Water and Sanitation], UN-DESA and UN-DCP, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The collection of water, which may take up to six hours a day to meet the household needs, is a duty often relegated to women and children. This foregone time often prevents children, especially girls, from attending school and women from pursuing small business opportunities.&lt;ref name=Water&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/es072435t, "Water and Sanitization in Developing Countries: Including Health in the Equation"],  Maggie A Montgomery and Menachem Elimelech, Yale University, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the Second World Water Forum in The Hague concluded that women are the primary users of domestic water, that women used water in their key food production roles, and that women and children were the most vulnerable to water-related disasters.&lt;ref name="Women and Water"&gt;[https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/public/Feb05.pdf, "Women and Water"], UN Division for the Advancement of Women, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; At the International Conference on Water and the Environment, the [[Dublin Statement|Dublin Statement on Water and Sustainable Development]] included "Women Play a central part in the provision management and safeguarding of water" as one of 4 principles. Many women's rights and water advocacy organizations have identified water privatization as an area of concern, sometimes alleging negative effects that specifically affect women.&lt;ref name=Diverting&gt;[http://www.wedo.org/wp-content/uploads/divertingtheflow.pdf,  "Diverting the Flow: A Resource Guide to Gender, Rights and Water Privatization"], Women's Environment and Development Organization.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Gender, Water, and Sanitization"&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/inter_agency/gender_water/policybrief.pdf, "Gender, Water, and Sanitization"], UN Water Policy Brief, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inclusion of women and the efficacy of water supply==
[[File:India - Sights &amp; Culture - 33 - woman fetching water.jpg|thumb|A woman walking a long distance fetching water in India]]
Water supply schemes in developing nations have shown higher success when planned and run with full participation of women in the affected communities.&lt;ref name="Gender in Water Resource Management"&gt;, Van Wijk-Sijbesma, Christine, 1998. Gender in Water Resources Management, Water Supply and Sanitation: Roles and Realities.&lt;/ref&gt; A study including 88 communities in 14 countries showed that projects where men and women from intended user households were included in selection of site facilities, and where water projects were initiated by user households, rather than by external agencies or local leaders, achieved a final higher access to services than those that did not.&lt;ref name="WSP"&gt;[http://www.wsp.org/wsp/sites/wsp.org/files/publications/global_plareport.pdf, "Linking Sustainability with Demand,Gender and Poverty"], International Water and Sanitation Centre, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===Chile===
Chilean law does not specifically include a gender component relating to water projects, but notes that all water projects must assess impact on the "lives and customs of human groups".&lt;ref name=genderwater/&gt; A study commissioned in 2000 by the Direccion General de Aguas relating to gender and the challenges of water resources noted: {{quote|text=All government institutions dealing with water resources have a very low percentage of women at the planning and decision-making levels. In stakeholder associations, their percentage in decision-making functions is even lower because women seldom participate in this kind of organisation. A sample study of water rights shoed that 16 percent of these rights belong to women. In the rural areas, the gender balance in water management is somewhat better, especially in the Indian territories. The current average percentage of women presidents in the rural zones is almost 20 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Direccion General de Aguas, Maria Angelica Algeria, Ingeniera Jefa Area de Evaluacion de Recursos Hidricos, Chile (this quote does not seem to be from a publication and the publication from which it has been quoted should be added)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Uganda ===

The 1995 Constitution of the [[Republic of Uganda]], Article 33 [2] states "The State shall provide the facilities and opportunities necessary to enhance the welfare of women to enable them to realise their full potential and advancement".&lt;ref name=ugandaconstitution&gt;[http://www.uganda.at/Geschichte/verfassung_der_republik_Uganda_2008.pdf, The Constitution of the Republic of Uganda], 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of this outlined responsibility, though excluded from official water statutes, has been addressed in the National Gender Policy, National Water Policy, and the Local Government Act. The National Gender Policy lays out a framework for gender-oriented sectoral policy in development. The National Water Policy calls for the inclusion of women at all stages of implementation, noting that "women and men should have equal opportunities to participate fully in all aspects of community management".&lt;ref name=genderwater&gt;[http://www.unwater.org/downloads/Gender_Perspectives_Policies.pdf, "The Gender and Water Development Report 2003"], The Gender and Water Alliance.&lt;/ref&gt; The local government act requires 30% of the representation on local councils to be women, currently at around 10%.&lt;ref name=genderwater/&gt;

=== Kenya ===
[[Kenya]]'s "Country Strategy on Integrated Water Resource Management" addresses the issue of gender and water source:
{{quote|text=As women play an important role in provision,  management and safeguarding of water, particular attention will be placed on adequately incorporating and representing gender considerations in water resource management. The issues will be addressed from two perspectives: facilitating the participation and involvement of both sexes in water resource management; and the access(benefits) of both sexes in availability of water.|sign=Department of Water Management |source=Country Strategy on Integrated Water Resources Management, Section IV. Sectoral Analysis and Policy Recommendations. Poverty and Sustainable Livelihoods.}} The text itself is slighted by critics as not referring to equitable participation and division of workload, as well as benefits. However the Kenyan Women's Bureau has begun to cooperate with the Water Department on these matters, through a focus on environmental management, poverty alleviation, and gender.&lt;ref name=genderwater/&gt;

===Malawi===
In [[Malawi]], a group of men managing community water sources was found to be ineffective as they were often absent during the workday. A management group consisting only of women was set up to replace the men, and water supply was reported to have improved. However the burden was too much for the female-only group and communities now split the work with an equitable share of duties.&lt;ref name=MALAWI&gt;Deda, P., Rubian, R., 2004. Women and Biodiversity: The Long Journey from Users to Policy-Makers. Natural Resources Forum, 28(3): 201-204.&lt;/ref&gt; Women in Malawi have also initiative in the maintenance of improved water sources, forming water tap committees composed mostly of women and using the pipelines as footpaths, reporting leaks to the village caretaker.&lt;ref name=WORLDBANK1&gt;World Bank, 1996. Toolkit on Gender in Water and Sanitation&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender and capacity development==
In scaling down water projects to the individual level, women have been found to be effective teachers at a domestic levels, and gender-sensitive approaches to water and [[sanitation]] have proven to be cost effective.&lt;ref name=GENDERPERSPECTIVE&gt;[http://www.unwater.org/downloads/bground_2.pdf, "A Gender Perspective on Water Resources and Sanitation"], Interagency Task Force on Gender and Water, United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs&lt;/ref&gt; In the Eastern Development Region in Nepal,   a small scale water management project under a "Community Water and Sanitation Programme" has shown success in a women-led team, which manages 23 tap stands in a village of the ''Jhapa''' district in addition to running adult literacy programs and latrine construction.&lt;ref name=NEPAL2&gt;Mahapatra, K., 1996. Towards Empowerment:  Women Mobilizers in the Community Water Supply and Sanitation Programme in Nepal. Waterfront,  9:12-13, 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[El Salvador]], The "Watersheds and Gender Project" has taught women technical agricultural knowledge, promoted women as trainers, and fostered female participation in positions previously uniquely occupied by men.&lt;ref name=ELSAVADOR&gt;Agua Project Report, 2002. El Salvador: AGUA Project Evaluation August–September 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

== Access ==
Access problems relating to water involve long walking distance to the source, low water quality, lack of a sufficient quantity of water, high water prices and poor system design. Women often suffer disproportionately from these problems. In [[Ghana]], women and children suffer as the result of failed water supply schemes where women consumed unclean water to save money to feed children.&lt;ref name="Ghana"&gt;[http://bscw.ihe.nl/pub/bscw.cgi/d2221893/AmengaEtagoWaterPrivatisationinGhana.pdf, "Water Privatization in Ghana: Womens Rights Under Siege"], Rudolf Amenga-Etego, Coordinator, Advocacy And Campaign Programmes, Integrated Social Development Centre, Accra-Ghana.&lt;/ref&gt; In east [[Nepal]] tap stands and tube wells were located along roads, so that women had to travel long distances or wait until nightfall to avoid being seen by men while bathing freely or washing clothes.&lt;ref name=eastNepal&gt;Regmi, S.C., Fawcett, B., 1999. Integrating Gender Needs Into Drinking Water Projects in Nepal. Gender and Development, 7(3): 62-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health effects ==
[[File:Schistosomiasis itch.jpeg|thumb|A hand showing [[schistosomiasis]] itch]]
Health and access are often related in gender-related issues of water sourcing. In [[Tanzania]], urinary [[schistosomiasis]] among women and girls was associated with the local practice of washing clothes in water infested with the vectors for the disease. As part of a project to drill wells the washing of clothes at hand pumps had been banned, forcing women to wash clothes in the open, infested water.&lt;ref name=untapped&gt;[http://www.unwater.org/downloads/untapped_eng.pdf, "Untapped Connections: Gender, Water, and Poverty"], Women's Environment and Development organization.&lt;/ref&gt; Cholera outbreaks are also of concern, as in Alexandra and KwaZulu, [[South Africa]] following contaminated water use which had been linked by some observers to water supply privatization in some localities.&lt;ref name=Diverting /&gt; In addition, women are often primary caretakers for HIV positive family members who require clean water in treatment, lack thereof can complicate existing effects.&lt;ref name=Diverting /&gt;

==Water and gender in international organizations==
The [[United Nations]] Interagency Network on Women and Gender Equality (IANWGE) established the Gender and Water Task Force in 2003. The Task Force has since become a UN-Water Task Force and is taking responsibility for the gender component of International Water for Life Decade (2005-1015).&lt;ref name=UNWEB&gt;[http://www.unwater.org/TFgender.html, UN Water Activities]&lt;/ref&gt; The Task Force has also called for additional empirical data regarding the issue, as "Neither the quality nor type of data currently collected are adequate to the task of supporting gender [[Millennium Development Goal]]s in water and sanitation".&lt;ref name=letter&gt;[http://www.ecosanres.org/pdf_files/Summary%20of%20EGM%20Report%20on%20Gender-disaggregated%20data-lowres.pdf, Summary Report on Gender-Disaggregated Data on Water and Sanitation], 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Bank]] Gender and Development Group has also addressed the issue at an institutional level, citing successful "Gender-Mainstreaming" efforts in many of its Water Supply and Sanitation projects.&lt;ref name=WSG&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTGENDER/Resources/Water_March07.pdf, "Water, Sanitation and Gender"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Workplace health surveillance''' or '''occupational health surveillance''' (U.S.) is the ongoing systematic collection, analysis, and dissemination of exposure and [[health data]] on groups of workers.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2013-145/|title=Current Intelligence Bulletin 65: Occupational Exposure to Carbon Nanotubes and Nanofibers|last=|first=|date=April 2013|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|page=146|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-27}} {{PD-inline}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/surveillance/|title=Worker Health Surveillance|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Joint ILO/WHO Committee on Occupational Health at its 12th Session in 1995 defined an occupational health surveillance system as “a system which includes a functional capacity for data collection, analysis and dissemination linked to occupational health programmes”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/protection/safework/health/whsguide.htm#Glossary|title=Occupational Safety and Health|last=|first=|date=|website=[[International Labour Organization]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept is new to [[occupational health]] and is frequently confused with [[Screening (medicine)|medical screening]]. Health screening refers to the early detection and treatment of diseases associated with particular occupations, while workplace health surveillance refers to the removal of the causative factors.

== Aspects ==

=== Medical surveillance ===
[[File:NIOSH Health Hazard Evaluation Program - Medical Testing at a Workplace.webm|thumb|A video about medical testing at a workplace as part of a [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]] [[Health Hazard Evaluation Program]] investigation]]

The mission of a medical surveillance program is to keep workers healthy and ensure that employers are meeting [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] standards in health and safety.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://medsurv.ucdavis.edu/index.php/about-us|title=About Us|last=|first=|date=|website=[[University of California, Davis]] Medical Surveillance Program|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical surveillance has an emphasis on prevention:  it is designed to detect potential workplace hazards before irreversible health effects can occur.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/medicalsurveillance/index.html|title=Medical Screening and Surveillance|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clinicians with expertise in occupational health, industrial exposures, and respiratory protection screen workers with physical examinations, blood testing, spirometry (a measurement lung function), and audiometry.  Screenings are performed at set intervals, often annually.  The clinicians providing medical surveillance services include board-certified [[Occupational medicine|occupational]] and [[environmental medicine]] physicians, [[Mid-level practitioner|mid-level practitioners]], nurses, and NIOSH-certified spirometry technicians.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Medical surveillance targets actual health events or a change in a biologic function of an exposed person or persons. Medical surveillance is a second line of defense behind the implementation of direct [[Hierarchy of hazard controls|hazard controls]] such as [[engineering controls]], [[administrative controls]], and [[personal protective equipment]]. NIOSH recommends the medical surveillance of workers when they are exposed to hazardous materials.  The elements of a medical surveillance program generally include the following:&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2009-116/|title=Current Intelligence Bulletin 60: Interim Guidance for Medical Screening and Hazard Surveillance for Workers Potentially Exposed to Engineered Nanoparticles|last=|first=|date=February 2009|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|pages=3–5|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-26}} {{PD-inline}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# An initial medical examination and collection of medical and occupational histories
# Periodic medical examinations at regularly scheduled intervals, including specific medical screening tests when warranted
# More frequent and detailed medical examinations as indicated on the basis of findings from these examinations
# Post-incident examinations and medical screening following uncontrolled or non-routine increases in exposures such as spills
# Worker training to recognize symptoms of exposure to a given hazard
# A written report of medical findings
# Employer actions in response to identification of potential hazards
When the purpose of a medical surveillance program is to detect early signs of work-related illness and disease, it is considered a type of [[Screening (medicine)|medical screening]], to detect preclinical changes in organ function or changes before a person would normally seek medical care and when intervention is beneficial The establishment of a medical screening program should follow established criteria, and specific disease endpoints must be able to be determined by the test selected.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Medical examinations and tests are used in many workplaces to determine whether an employee is able to perform the essential functions of the job.  Medical surveillance of workers is also required by law in the United States when there is exposure to a specific workplace hazard, and OSHA has a number of standards that require medical surveillance of workers In addition to substance-specific standards, OSHA has standards with broader applicability. For example, employers must follow the medical evaluation requirements of OSHA’s respiratory protection standard ({{CodeFedReg|29|1910|134}}) when respirators are necessary to protect worker health.  Likewise, the OSHA standard for occupational exposure to hazardous chemicals in laboratories ({{CodeFedReg|29|1910|1450}}) requires medical consultation following the accidental release of hazardous chemicals. NIOSH also recommends medical surveillance, including screening, of workers when there is exposure to certain occupational hazards.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Hazard surveillance ===
Hazard surveillance involves identifying potentially hazardous practices or exposures in the workplace and assessing the extent to which they can be linked to workers, the effectiveness of controls, and the reliability of exposure measures. Workplace hazards can be chemical, biological, physical, ergonomic, psychosocial, or safety-related in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ccohs.ca/topics/hazards/|title=Hazards {{!}} Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety|last=Safety|first=Government of Canada, Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and|website=www.ccohs.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazard surveillance is an essential component of any occupational health surveillance effort and is used for defining the elements of the risk management program. Critical elements of a risk management program include recognizing potential exposures and taking appropriate actions to minimize them (for example, implementing engineering controls, employing good work practices, and using personal protective equipment). Hazard surveillance should include the identification of work tasks and processes that involve the production and use of hazardous materials, and should be viewed as one of the most critical components of any risk management program.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Hazard surveillance includes elements of hazard and [[exposure assessment]]. The hazard assessment involves reviewing the best available information concerning toxicity of materials. Such an assessment may come from databases, texts, and published literature or available regulations or guidelines. Human studies, such as [[Epidemiology|epidemiologic]] investigations and case series or reports, and animal studies may also provide valuable information.  The exposure assessment involves evaluating relevant exposure routes (inhalation, ingestion, dermal, and/or injection), amount, duration, and frequency (i.e., dose), as well as whether [[Hierarchy of hazard controls|exposure controls]] are in place and how protective they are. When data are not available, this will be a qualitative process.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Occupational Health Indicators (OHIs)==
In 1998, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) joined the CDC's [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] ([[NIOSH]]) to form the Occupational Health Surveillance Work Group in order to prioritize occupational health conditions to be placed under surveillance.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5601.pdf|title=Indicators for Occupational Health Surveillance|last=|first=|date=January 19, 2007|website=Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Work Group recommended that states use 19 occupational health indicators based on the availability of easily obtainable statewide data, the public health importance of the occupational health effect or exposure, and the potential for intervention activities.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

These indicators are useful in assessing the ongoing policies and preventive measures but they also have some limitations. Among the major limitations are the underreporting of occupational health disorders, the inability to recognize potential occupational association of the disorder by health care workers, difficulties in attributing diseases with long latency or multiple causes (such as lung cancer) to occupational exposures, exclusion of special populations (such as self-employed or military personnel), and differences between state-specific databases.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Data Sources ===
Data for the OHIs come from multiple sources including:
* [[Death certificate|Death certificates]], with contributing and underlying causes of death, which all states send to the [[National Vital Statistics System]] in CDC's [[National Center for Health Statistics]]
* [[Cancer registry|Cancer registries]], such as the [[North American Association of Central Cancer Registries]]
* State hospital discharge data
* State Worker's Compensation systems
* Occupational safety and health professionals

==Tools==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}

The usefulness of a surveillance tool may depend on what hazards are present in the workplace and the health effects those hazards may cause. For example, hearing tests will be helpful when noise exposures are present, while tests assessing lung function or [[biomonitoring]] may be useful when airborne agents are present. It is also important to distinguish between tools using medical surveillance (measuring health effects) and hazard surveillance/exposure assessment (physical measurements of the type and severity of hazard present). Periodic testing, including a baseline exam when an employee is hired, can often help detect a decline in function by comparing previous results.

It can assist in the early detection of occupational lung diseases and provides information about the severity and staging of asthma and other restrictive lung diseases.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iaff.org/hs/Resi/pulmonary%20function%20tests.htm|title=Occupational Medicine|website=www.iaff.org|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/publications/publication.athruz?pType=Industry&amp;pID=277|title=OSHA Publications – Pulmonary Function Test {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/spirometry/default.html|title=CDC – Spirometry – NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|date=2017-12-08|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*** [[Spirometry]] tests measure how quickly air can be pushed out from the lungs and is useful in evaluating diseases that cause obstruction to flow.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
*** [[Plethysmography]] measures lung volume by having the subject perform breathing tests inside of an air tight box.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
*** Flow rates can be measured by asking subjects to blow air out of the lungs as fast and as hard as possible from their largest inhaled breathe (inspiration) to the maximum exhaled breathe (expiration). The volume exhaled in the first second is called the forced expiratory volume in one second ([[FEV1]]). These flow rates can be indicators of disease that cause obstruction to airflow, such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
** [[Biomonitoring]] measures total body burden of a hazardous chemical in a worker via analysis of biological specimens such as urine or blood. Non-invasive procedures are preferred when possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oshwiki.eu/wiki/Biological_monitoring_(biomonitoring)|title=Biological monitoring (biomonitoring): OSHwiki|website=oshwiki.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Noise exposures'''
** [[Audiometry]] remains the mainstay of diagnosis of [[noise-induced hearing loss]], which is the most common reported occupational disease in all parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walker|first=Jennifer Junnila|last2=Cleveland|first2=Leanne M.|last3=Davis|first3=Jenny L.|last4=Seales|first4=Jennifer S.|date=2013-01-01|title=Audiometry Screening and Interpretation|url=https://www.aafp.org/afp/2013/0101/p41.html|journal=American Family Physician|language=en|volume=87|issue=1|issn=0002-838X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Occupational Health Safety Network (OHSN) ==
The [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ohsn/ Occupational Health Safety Network (OHSN)] is a secure electronic surveillance system developed by the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health |National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)]] to address health and safety risks among health care personnel.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ohsn/|title=CDC – Occupational Safety Health Network (OHSN)  – NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topics|date=2017-07-06|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hospitals and other healthcare facilities can upload the occupational injury data they already collect to the secure database for analysis and benchmarking with other de-identified facilities. NIOSH works with OHSN participants in identifying and implementing timely and targeted interventions. OHSN modules currently focus on three high risk and preventable events that can lead to injuries or musculoskeletal disorders among healthcare personnel: sharps injuries; blood and body fluid exposures; [[musculoskeletal]] injuries from patient handling activities; slips, trips, and falls; and workplace violence.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; OHSN enrollment is currently open to all U.S. healthcare facilities. OHSN may be expanded to other industry sectors in the future.

==Confidentiality of information==
Most countries have specific regulations for individual [[health data]], which require that the worker be informed if this information is ever shared with any third party. Occupational Health Records (OHR) have the same protections as any medical record that has confidential health information. Employers must store OHR in a secured area free from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Workers should have the right to access this information whenever they wish.
