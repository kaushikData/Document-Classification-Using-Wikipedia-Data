'''Alliance for Positive Change - formerly known as AIDS Service Center NYC''' - is a community organization that helps New Yorkers living with [[HIV]] and other chronic illnesses.  Founded in 1990&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ascnyc.org/eng/message-from-the-executive-director/ AIDS Service Center NYC - Message from the Executive Director&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; by CEO Sharen Duke, ASCNYC provides direct services to over 1,800 New Yorkers per year, while its peer education programs and community outreach initiatives reach an additional 18,000. In 2017, the organization formally changed its name to [http://alliance.nyc/ The Alliance for Positive Change.] This change came as the nonprofit expanded to help more New Yorkers with substance use and mental health issues, and program participants with chronic illnesses such as hepatitis, diabetes, and heart disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-hiv-nonprofits-expand-services-to-other-health-issues-1508112785|title=New York HIV Nonprofits Expand Services to Other Health Issues|last=West|first=Melanie Grayce|date=2017-10-16|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-02-08|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alliance for Positive Change transforms lives of New Yorkers living with HIV/AIDS and other chronic illnesses. It helps people access medical care, manage and overcome addiction, escape homelessness, get back to work, and find community. By addressing the underlying issues that contribute to poor health, the Alliance’s individualized, full-service approach and harm reduction philosophy help New Yorkers lead healthier, more self-sufficient lives&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alliance.nyc/about-overview/|title=Overview|website=The Alliance|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

ASCNYC partners with New York hospitals, such as [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York]], [[Beth Israel Medical Center]], [[New York-Presbyterian Hospital]] and [[St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center]] for care coordination and case management for patients with [[HIV/AIDS]]. ASCNYC is a member of the [[Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpwa.org/cgi-bin/iowa/about/member_agencies/index.html The Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, list of member agencies]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, singer [[John Legend]] gave ASCNYC permission to remix his song "If You're Out There" to create a music video promoting HIV/AIDS awareness and testing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/06/22/2009-06-22_singer_gives_soul_to_help_battle_aids.html New York Daily News, June 22, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The video was launched at ASCNYC's annual Safer Sex in the City fundraiser.

Alliance programs and services promote the well-being, empowerment, and stability of persons living with HIV/AIDS and other chronic illnesses. Program highlights include: 
* Peer Training Institute annually trains over 350 people affected by HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C, and substance use to be prevention and harm reduction Peer Interns 
* Comprehensive care coordination for 3,890 people living with chronic conditions per year, including medical, housing, substance abuse treatment, translation assistance, mental health services, entitlements advocacy, and childcare aid 
* ''Lower East Side Harm Reduction Center'' provides harm reduction services for over 1,900 individuals, and distributes almost 200,000 sterile syringes each year. 
* Reentry support services for over 700 men and women annually 
* Basic needs program that provides over 39,000 meals, as well as clothes, hygiene kits, food pantry and emergency aid for over 13,400 individuals and families annually

'''Agricultural chemistry''' is the study of both [[chemistry]] and [[biochemistry]] which are important in agricultural [[Production, costs, and pricing|production]], the processing of raw [[Product (business)|products]] into foods and beverages, and in [[Natural environment|environmental]] [[Environmental monitoring|monitoring]] and [[Environmental remediation|remediation]]. These studies emphasize the relationships between plants, [[animals]] and [[bacteria]] and their [[Natural environment|environment]].
The science of chemical compositions and changes involved in the production, protection, and use of crops and livestock. As a basic science, it embraces, in addition to test-tube chemistry, all the life processes through which humans obtain food and fiber for themselves and feed for their animals. As an applied science or technology, it is directed toward control of those processes to increase yields, improve quality, and reduce costs. One important branch of it, [[chemurgy]], is concerned chiefly with utilization of agricultural products as chemical [[raw material]]s. Etc.

==Sciences==

The goals of agricultural chemistry are to expand understanding of the causes and effects of biochemical reactions related to plant and animal growth, to reveal opportunities for controlling those reactions, and to develop chemical products that will provide the desired assistance or control. Every scientific discipline that contributes to agricultural progress depends in some way on chemistry. Hence agricultural chemistry is not a distinct discipline, but a common thread that ties together [[genetics]], [[physiology]], [[microbiology]], [[entomology]], and numerous other sciences that impinge on agriculture.

Chemical materials developed to assist in the production of food, feed, and fiber include scores of [[herbicide]]s, [[insecticide]]s, [[fungicide]]s, and other [[pesticide]]s, plant growth regulators, [[fertilizer]]s, and animal feed supplements. Chief among these groups from the commercial point of view are manufactured fertilizers, synthetic pesticides (including herbicides), and supplements for feeds. The latter include both nutritional supplements (for example, [[mineral nutrients]]) and medicinal compounds for the prevention or control of disease.

Agricultural chemistry often aims at preserving or increasing the [[fertility (soil)|fertility of soil]], maintaining or improving the [[agricultural yield]], and improving the quality of the crop.

When agriculture is considered with [[ecology]], the [[sustainablility]] of an operation is considered. Modern agrochemical industry has gained a reputation for [[profit maximization|maximising profits]] while violating sustainable and ecologically viable agricultural principles. [[Eutrophication]], the prevalence of [[genetically modified crops]] and the increasing concentration of chemicals in the food chain (e.g. [[persistent organic pollutant]]s) are only a few consequences of naive [[industrial agriculture]].

'''Bagolini striated glasses test''', or '''BSGT''', is a subjective clinical test to detect the presence or extent of [[binocular vision|binocular functions]] and is generally performed by an Optometrist(O.D) or  [[orthoptist]] or ophthalmologist (medical/surgical eye doctor, M.D. or D.O.). It is mainly used in [[strabismus]] clinics. Through this test, [[suppression (eye)|suppression]], [[microtropia]], [[diplopia]] and manifest deviations can be noted. However this test should always be used in conjunction with other clinical tests, such as [[Worth 4 dot test]], [[Cover test]], [[Prism Cover Test|Prism cover test]] and [[Maddox rod]] to come to a diagnosis.

==Equipment==

To perform the test you will need
* Bagolini Striated Glasses
* Pen torch or a distant light source.

Alternatively, trial frames and lenses or a [[lorgnette]] can be used. 
In some cases, the use of [[prism]]s is necessary to measure a deviation and test for the presence of binocular functions.

==Principles==

Bagolini striated glasses are glasses of no [[optical power|dioptric power]] that have many narrow striations running parallel in one meridian. These glasses cause the fixation light to appear as an elongated streak perpendicular to the striations. The lenses are usually placed at 135 degrees in front of the one eye and at 45 degrees in front of the other. Each eye receives a similar, fusible image, with the exception of the line, allowing simultaneous perception to be observed. With both eyes, the patient should see a cross.  This test is minimally dissociative for the assessment of [[retinal correspondence]].

Apart from testing [[binocular vision|binocular functions]], Bagolini striated glasses can measure [[cyclotropia]] . The principle of the test is similar to that of double Maddox rod test. The glasses are placed in the trial frames with the striations vertical, giving rise to two horizontal line images when viewing a spotlight. If the patient has a vertical deviation, the lines will be seen one above the other. If there is little or no vertical separation, vertical prism can be used to separate the lines. The patient is asked if one or both lines are tilted. The lines can be straightened subjectively by rotating the glasses in the trial frame and the degree of [[cyclotropia]] recorded.&lt;ref name="voncampos"&gt;Von Noorden, G. K., Campos, E. C. (2002). Binocular vision and ocular motility theory and management of strabismus. St Louise: Mosby&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indications for use==

[[File:Bagolini Striated Glasses Test.webm|thumb|A video covering the Bagolini Striated Test]]

The BSGT is used for patients with [[strabismus]] to test for [[suppression (eye)|suppression]], [[normal retinal correspondence]] or [[abnormal retinal correspondence]],&lt;ref&gt;Nelson &amp; Olitsky (2013). Harley's Pediatric Ophthalmology (6th Ed.) Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins USA.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in cases of manifest strabismus.&lt;ref name="Ansons"&gt;Ansons, A., Davis, H. (2014). Diagnosis and Management of Ocular Motility Disorders (4th Ed.). London: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Bagolini Striated Glasses Test is the test most likely to allow the demonstration of [[Binocular vision|fusion]] in patients who [[binocular vision|fuse]] intermittently. Harmonious anomalous retinal correspondence is found more frequently when using Bagolini Striated Glasses Test than with the [[Worth 4 dot test]] or the [[haploscope|synoptophore]].&lt;ref&gt;Pasino, L &amp; Giovanni, M (1964). Importance of natural test conditions in assessing the sensory state of the squinting subject with some clinical considerations on anomalous retinal correspondence British Journal of Ophthalmology; 48(1): 30–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==

The BSGT is performed under normal lighting conditions. The Bagolini glasses can either be used in trial frames or are set up in reversible lorgnette frames &lt;ref name="Ansons"/&gt; which are placed over the patients [[glasses]] who wear [[eyeglass prescription|refractive correction]]. The examiner shines a torch light, directing it towards the centre bridge of the Bagolini glasses i.e. the patients nose (light is at patients eye level) from distance (6&amp;nbsp;m) or near (33&amp;nbsp;cm). The patient can also be tested in alternate positions of gaze (upgaze or downgaze). The test is usually performed at near.

The number and type of questions asked are contingent on whether the patient has [[binocular vision|binocularity]] present and the consequent responses to the testing questions. The patient is firstly asked about the number of lights visible and the position and number of lines seen.&lt;ref name="Ansons"/&gt;

The patient is asked to describe or draw what they have seen &lt;ref name="Ansons"/&gt;
When asking the patient to describe what they see, the clinician can prompt them by asking:

* How many lights do you see
* How many lines do you see
* Do the lines cross
* Are the two lines seen at the same time
* Do the lines intersect through the light
* Do the lines have any gaps in them
* Which line is on the right/left (or which line is higher/lower) &lt;ref name="Ansons"/&gt;

== Recording ==

Results are recorded by drawing the cross as the patient sees it, alongside an interpretation of the results.

For example:

 BSGT: &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;X&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; BSV

 BSGT: &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''/'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; Left suppression

==Results==
[[File:Suppression.png|thumb|Suppression responses]]
[[File:BSGT BSV.png|thumb|Binocular single vision response]]
[[File:Microtropia.png|thumb|A possible microtropia response]]
[[File:Manifest strabismus.png|thumb|Possible manifest strabismus responses]]
When interpreting results, the line associated with each eye is the line perpendicular to the lens in front of that eye. If the lens in front of the right eye is at 135 degrees, then the line on the results representing the right eye will be at 45 degrees.

'''One light:''' If the patient sees one light, that means that either they have fused the two images from each eye together, or are [[suppression (eye)|suppressing]] of one of the images.

'''Two lights:''' If the patient sees two lights, this is indicative of [[diplopia]] as the patient has an image from each eye but is unable to fuse the two.

'''One line:''' If only one line is seen, this means one eye is [[suppression (eye)|suppressing]]. The eye that is suppressing is the eye which the corresponding line is not seen.

'''Two lines:''' If the patient sees two lines, this means that there is no [[suppression (eye)|suppression]] of either eye.

'''Disappearing line:''' The patient may report that they see one line, then the lines switch and they can only see the other line. This is the case in an alternating deviation, where there is always one eye suppressing, however the fixing eye is switching.

'''Broken line:''' If a line has a break in it, this means that there is a [[scotoma]] somewhere on the retina.

=== Normal binocular single vision (BSV) ===

In a patient with normal binocular functions, the expected results would be a cross with the light where the two lines intersect.

=== Microtropia ===

In a patient with [[microtropia]], the patient may see one light and two lines, with one of the lines having a small break in it. This is due to foveal suppression.

=== Esotropia ===

In a patient with an unsuppressed [[esotropia]], the patient will see two lights with one line through each light. The line corresponding to the right eye will be on the right side, meaning the images are uncrossed.

=== Exotropia ===

In a patient with an unsuppressed [[exotropia]], the patient will see two lights with one line through each light. The line corresponding to the right eye will be on the left side of the results, meaning the images are crossed.

=== Hypertropia/Hypotropia ===

In a patient with an unsuppressed vertical deviation, one line will appear higher than the other. If the image of the right eye is higher than that of the left, this means the right eye is lower than the left. This could be either a right [[hypotropia]] or a left [[hypertropia]].

=== Harmonious Abnormal retinal correspondence ===

If the patient has a known deviation, but they report a cross as seen in a patient with normal binocular functions, this indicates the presence of harmonious abnormal retinal correspondence.

=== Inharmonious Abnormal retinal correspondence ===

If the patient reports that they see two lines, however only one of these lines crosses through the fixation light, this indicates the presence of inharmonious abnormal retinal correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;Reinecke, R.D., Parks, M.M. (1987). Strabismius: A programmed text (3rd ed.). Connecticut: Appleton &amp; Lange&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prieto-Diaz, J., Souza-Diaz, C. (2000). Strabismus (4th ed.). Woburn: Butterworth-Heinemann&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pratt-Johnson, J.A., Tillson, G. (1994). Management of strabismus and amblyopia: A practical guide. New York: Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

This test merely detects the presence of a deviation, but does not identify which eye is the deviated eye.

==Advantages and Disadvantages==
'''Advantages'''
* Because the BSGT is performed in well-lit conditions, it has a lesser dissociative affect on the eyes giving truer results than other test such as the Worth 4 light test.

'''Disadvantages'''
* Extraneous light sources during testing can cause patient confusion. 
* It is a subjective test, relying on the patients responses. 
* Miscommunication between the clinician and patient may result in inaccuracies. 
* The results can be misinterpreted if the clinician does not take note of the orientation of the striations. 
* Extensive [[suppression (eye)|suppression]] may interfere with perception of the second stripe.&lt;ref name="voncampos"/&gt;

[[File:Banana_Wine_ingredients.jpg|thumb|Banana wine ingredients cooking in a large pot, and being kept from boiling]]
It is different from [[banana beer]], which has a long tradition and great cultural significance in East Africa. Blocker et al. (2001)&lt;ref name="google85"&gt;{{cite book | author=Jack S. Blocker | author2=David M. Fahey | author3=Ian R. Tyrrell| title=Alcohol and Temperance in Modern History| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BuzNzm-x0l8C&amp;pg=PA85| year=2001| publisher=ABC-CLIO| isbn=978-1-57607-833-4| page=85 }}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote a chapter on "Banana Wine" in the book ''Alcohol and temperance in modern history: an international encyclopedia'', though this is slightly confusing, as they define what is traditionally referred to as banana beer as being banana wine. The data they present on ''Production Techniques'' and ''Social Practices and Rituals'' relates to the latter and not to what is commonly known as banana wine.

In Tanzania, banana wine is made commercially by fermenting peeled, mashed, ripe bananas. Water (to dilute the rather thick banana mash), wine yeast and sugar is added to the "banana mash".&lt;ref name="scihub2013"&gt;{{cite book | author=G. W. Byaruagaba-Bazirake | author2=Pierre van Rensburg | author3=W. Kyamuhangire | year=2013 | title=Characterisation of banana wine fermented with recombinant wine yeast strains. | url=http://www.scihub.org/AJFN/PDF/2013/3/AJFN-3-3-105-116.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional banana beer processing (as described in the banana beer page and in Blocker et al. (2001)&lt;ref name="google85" /&gt;) is different from commercial banana wine processing. For example, the process of making banana wine used by Banana Investment Ltd. is as follows:&lt;ref name="columbia2010"&gt;{{cite book | author= Darren Bounds| author2=Ken Lee | author3=Garrett Wright | title=Banana Investments Entrepreneurial Growth in Tanzania. |publisher=Columbia Business School / Columbia CaseWorks | date=August 10, 2012 | url=http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/filemgr?file_id=7216407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Ripe bananas are peeled and put in plastic barrels filled with water.
#The barrel contents are then pressed (mashed) and banana mash transferred to large metal pots and boiled for several hours, forming a base of juice and pulp.
#The boiled banana mash is strained and sugar added to the left over juice and boiled again.
#The boiled juice is left to cool.
#Wine yeast is added to cooled, sweetened banana juice and placed in plastic fermentation tanks for 15 to 20 days, depending on product.
#The fermented liquid is diluted with sterilized water, bottled and then shipped for distribution.&lt;ref name="columbia2010" /&gt;

In commercial production, ‘Cavendish’ bananas are used, while in informal production, a variety of cultivars, including both cooking and beer [[East African Highland bananas]], ‘Pisang awak’, ‘[[Gros Michel]]’ and Apple bananas are used.&lt;ref name="banana2010"&gt;{{cite book | author=S.R.B.

Production of banana wine is mostly at a small-scale level, though attempts have been made to bring it up to industrialized production,&lt;ref name="hindustantimes1"&gt;{{cite news|author= |title=Going bananas over wine |publisher=Press Trust of India |date=September 19, 2010 |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Going-bananas-over-wine/Article1-602008.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126035431/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Going-bananas-over-wine/Article1-602008.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 26, 2011 |accessdate=October 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are commercial producers of banana wine (i.e. Arusha-based Banana Investment Ltd).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Banana winery at your doorstep | publisher=Arusha Times On The Web | date=Aug 17–23, 2002 | url=http://www.arushatimes.co.tz/2002/33/features_3.htm | accessdate=March 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early 2000s, attempts have been made to expand banana wine production to other countries where the crop is prevalent. The [[Philippines]] government has sought to expand a local banana wine industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Katrina H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12481">'''BioWatch''' is a [[United States federal government]] program to detect the release of [[pathogens]] into the air as part of a [[terrorist]] attack on major [[United States|American]] cities. Reportedly operating in [[Philadelphia]], [[New York City]], [[Washington, DC]], [[San Diego]], [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[San Francisco]], [[Atlanta]], [[St. Louis]], [[Houston]], [[Los Angeles]] and 21 other cities,&lt;ref name=fas&gt;&gt;[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/terror/RL32152.html#_1_3 ''The BioWatch Program: Detection of Bioterrorism''] Congressional Research Service Report No. RL 32152. November 19, 2003, retrieved October 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; the BioWatch program was created in 2001 in response to the increased threat of bioterrorism sparked by the [[2001 anthrax attacks]], and was announced in [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]]'s [[State of the Union Address]] of 2003.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

The program, described as "the nation's first early warning network of sensors to detect biological attack" operates via a system of filters located within existing [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] air filters that monitor air quality. Results from these filters are analyzed by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], who pass any significant results to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;

As of mid-2012, the system had generated a large number of false alarms, with more than 50 such cases documented between 2003 and 2008. State and local health officials have never ordered evacuations or distributed emergency medicines in response to a positive reading from the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work = Los Angeles Times |author=David Willman, |date=July 7, 2012 |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-biowatch-20120708,0,5093512.story?track=lat-pick |title=The biodefender that cries wolf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Origins===
{{See also|2001 anthrax attacks}}
[[Image:Bacillus anthracis.png|thumb|right|220px|[[Anthrax]] spores can be released into the air, as with all other forms of matter]]
The 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States, also known as Amerithrax from its FBI case name, occurred over the course of several weeks beginning on September 18, 2001. Letters containing [[Bacillus anthracis|anthrax spores]] were mailed to several news media offices and two [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]]s, killing five people and infecting 17 others. As a response, the US increased countermeasure research funding and funding into the [[Health care in the United States|public health sector]]. Before the BioWatch program, the quickest method of detecting the presence of an infectious material was through the diagnosis of infected patients, however the most effective treatment takes place prior to infection or in its early stages.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt; While the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] maintains that the use of bioterrorism in the United States is unlikely,&lt;ref&gt;Directorate of Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, Terrorist CBRN: Materials and Effects, June, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; the Biowatch program was created in 2001 in conjunction with the FBI, EPA, [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] and the US [[Laboratory Response Network]] for Bioterrorism, and was tested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Association of Public Health Laboratories. According to the DHS, the BioWatch program helps to provide "early warning of a mass pathogen release."&lt;ref name=fas/&gt; The original 31 city program cost $60 million to implement, with a proposed expansion in 2005 to cost $118 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndu.edu/ctnsp/biosensing_05.htm ''A Hot Idea''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904091831/http://www.ndu.edu/ctnsp/biosensing_05.htm |date=September 4, 2007 }} National Defense University, retrieved October 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reform Efforts===
To remedy this, another program was created in 2003 that was meant to shorten the detection time to 6 hours and that could detect more than the six pathogens. After 11 years and $200 million spent on testing and development, however, the program was cancelled in 2014 because the new devices could not be made to work. For now, the 36-hour detection program continues, with maintenance costs of $80 million per year. The undersecretary for the science and technology at the Department of Homeland Security stated to Congress in February 2016 that his team was in an "exploratory process" phase for addressing the program's shortcomings, and that a solution was hoped for in 3–8 years.&lt;ref name="brill"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brill|first1=Steven|title=Is America Any Safer?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/09/are-we-any-safer/492761/|accessdate=18 August 2016|publisher=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instances of positive results==
*On October 9, 2003, a BioWatch filter in [[Houston, Texas]], detected "low levels of the bacterium that causes [[tularemia]]".&lt;ref name=fas/&gt; Three consecutive days of positive results were recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Houston Department of Health and Human Services, [http://www.ci.houston.tx.us/departme/health/bacteria%20detection.htm ''Officials Following Up on Bacteria Detection''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041211072610/http://www.ci.houston.tx.us/departme/health/bacteria%20detection.htm |date=December 11, 2004 }} Press Release&lt;/ref&gt; Additional tests were taken, and the local area was watched for signs of infection among the population. While an investigation is still ongoing, Director of the Houston Department of Health and Human Services stated that "We are investigating to determine if the bacteria was always present or newly present and if it represents a health threat to the community."&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;
*Small amounts of tularemia bacteria were again detected in BioWatch filters in the Mall area and elsewhere in [[Washington, DC]], the morning after an anti-war demonstration on September 24, 2005. Biohazard sensors were triggered at six locations. While thousands of people were potentially exposed, no infections were reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Dvorak P | title=Health Officials Vigilant for Illness After Sensors Detect Bacteria on Mall: Agent Found as Protests Drew Thousands of Visitors | publisher=Washington Post | page=C13 | date=2005-10-02 | accessdate=2007-05-08

==Response and criticism==

The BioWatch system has received a mix of responses since coming online, many that result in waste of resources and a lowering public confidence in the system.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt; A Congressional report in 2003 recorded that there was concern that the BioWatch filters would fail to detect indoor or underground releases, and also that the existence of BioWatch filters in some cities would direct terrorists to attack other cities without such protection. The report also highlighted the risk of the filters themselves being detected and destroyed.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt; The report also states that, as EPA filters are located based on different policies than what would provide optimum locations for counter-bioterrorism sensors, the BioWatch filters may not be optimally located.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt; Furthermore, the BioWatch system may miss releases that take place within the gaps in coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Geoff Dutton, ''Ohio Says Security Requires Secrecy On Tests For Air Toxins,'' The Columbus Dispatch, March 21, 2003, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] also concluded that models used to predict the spread of an infectious agent after release and detection may be inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Government Reform, Subcommittee on National Security, ''Emerging Threats and International Relations, Following Toxic Clouds: Science and Assumptions in Plume Modeling'', 108th Congress, June 2, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bs&gt;[http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/biosecurity_briefing/archive/govt_response/content/2007-02-09-dhsoigrptmismanagementbiowatch.html ''DHS OIG Report Finds Mismanagement of BioWatch Program''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023082300/http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/biosecurity_briefing/archive/govt_response/content/2007-02-09-dhsoigrptmismanagementbiowatch.html |date=October 23, 2007 }} Center for Biosecurity, retrieved October 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The Congressional Report also raises concerns as to whether BioWatch can detect pathogens in large, polluted cities, as well as issues relating to the BioWatch filter reporting harmful pathogens that are actually within safe background levels, and thus would throw up more positive hits than actual investigation warrants.&lt;ref name=fas/&gt; There are also concerns that the BioWatch filters kill whatever pathogen has set them off, thus removing the possibility of further tests being undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/bt/bioprep/news/biowatch.html BioWatch Program Aims For Nationwide Detection of Airborne Pathogens]'' CIDRAP News, February 26, 2003, revised March 10, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, concerns were raised in the Congressional Report regarding the sensitivity of the filters, and the fact that each filter would be exposed to different environmental conditions and thus a standardized detection rate would be near impossible to achieve. The complicated response that would be required should the BioWatch filter detect a pathogen would also be difficult to implement and put strain on local health authorities. Funding, policy and evaluation of effectiveness were all other areas of concern&lt;ref name=fas/&gt;&lt;ref name=bs/&gt;

In June 2013, Mike Walter, the manager of the [[DHS Office of Health Affairs|Office of Health Affairs BioWatch Program]], made a few remarks during his testimony to the [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations|House Committee on Energy and Commerce's Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations]]. Walter said the benefits of the BioWatch Program give public health decision makers more time and more options to mitigate a [[bioterrorism|bioterrorist]] event. He said that early detection is critical to the successful treatment of affected populations and provides public health decision makers more time – and thereby more options – in responding to, mitigating, and recovering from a bioterrorist event. If a [[bioagent]] is detected and assessed to be the result of an act of bioterrorism and/or a threat to public health, prophylactic treatment can be started prior to the widespread onset of symptoms resulting in more lives saved. He also talked about the federal, state and local partnership, tools for preparedness and is developing robust quality assurance, as well as assessing new technologies to shorten decision time in relation to bioagent detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bioprepwatch.com/medical_countermeasures/biowatch-program-manager-testifies-before-house-of-representatives/330922/ |title=BioWatch Program manager testifies before House of Representatives |last1=Tinder |first1=Paul |date=June 24, 2013 |publisher=BioPrepWatch |accessdate=8 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104161937/http://www.bioprepwatch.com/medical_countermeasures/biowatch-program-manager-testifies-before-house-of-representatives/330922/ |archivedate=4 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4400">'''Cannabis in Palau''' is illegal, but reports indicate the drug is widely produced and consumed on the island nation. Palau is a former [[ Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands ]] of the United States which gained independence in 1994, and has a population under 20,000. 

Reports by the [[World Health Organization]] and [[UNODC]] have been called into question for the accuracy of their claims that Palau has the highest cannabis usage rates in the world. Despite controversy over the numbers, usage appears high, and a 2005 academic paper states the Palau police ignore public consumption.&lt;ref name="LeaneTigerstrom2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey W.

==International ranking==
A 2011 WHO report, as well as the 2012 UN [[World Drug Report]] stated that Palau has the world's highest adult cannabis consumption rate, at 24.2% annually. However, critics have questioned these results, noting that the numbers were based on a survey conducted at the island's only public highschool, which had then been extrapolated to the entire nation. However, academics have noted that while the numbers may not be reliable, Palau does have prevalent cannabis use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pacific.scoop.co.nz/2012/08/opponents-slam-uns-unfair-research-on-palaus-pot-problem/ |title=Opponents slam UN’s ‘unfair’ research on Palau’s pot problem |publisher=Pacific.scoop.co.nz |date=2012-08-16 |accessdate=2015-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-18736585 |title=Palau: Is it the world's cannabis capital? - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.com |date=2012-07-07 |accessdate=2015-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1989 American congressional hearing noted that Palau was exporting some 300 pounds of cannabis per week.&lt;ref name="Affairs1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=United States. Congress. House.

By the 1980s, cannabis had become the most valuable export crop of Palau.&lt;ref name="Connell2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Connell|title=Islands at Risk?: Environments, Economies and Contemporary Change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JZ8DfSm2uXsC&amp;pg=PA65|year=2013|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-78100-351-0|pages=65–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Co-counselling''' (spelled '''co-counseling''' in [[American and British English spelling differences|American English]]) is a grassroots method of personal change based on reciprocal peer counselling. It uses simple methods. Time is shared equally and the essential requirement of the person taking their turn in the role of counsellor is to do their best to listen and give their full attention to the other person.  It is not a discussion; the aim is to support the person in the client role to work through their own issues in a mainly self-directed way.

Co-counselling was originally formulated in the early 1950s by the American [[Harvey Jackins]] and originated in a [[schism]] in the [[Dianetics]] movement (itself in part derived from schisms in [[General Semantics]] and [[Cybernetics]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, "[http://www.dianetics.org/en_US/l-ron-hubbard/articles/terra/ Terra Incognita: The Mind] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060204155459/http://www.dianetics.org/en_US/l-ron-hubbard/articles/terra/ |date=2006-02-04 }}," ''The Explorers Journal'', winter 1949 / spring 1950 (on the bridge between cybernetics and general semantics)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/soho/studios/8215/dia.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+02:56:00 Rich's Home Page - ''Comparison of Re-evaluation Counseling Terms and concepts with Dianetics'']&lt;/ref&gt; Jackins founded the [[Re-evaluation Counseling]] (RC) Communities, with headquarters in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[United States]]. His son, [[Tim Jackins]], is currently the international leader of Re-evaluation Counseling and its main affiliates.

There are a number of smaller, separate, independent organizations that have resulted from breakaways from, or re-workings of, Re-evaluation Counseling. The principal one of these is [[Co-Counselling International|Co-Counseling International]] (CCI).

==General description==
The main activity in co-counselling involves participants arranging to meet regularly in pairs to give each other peer-to-peer counselling, in turn taking the role of counsellor and client, with equal amounts of time allocated to each. Co-counselling functions by giving people an opportunity to work on whatever issues they choose with the accepting support of another person, with whom they have no actual relationship. The person in the role of counsellor acts as a facilitator to the client, sometimes as a third-party observer and sometimes as a second-party confidant. While co-counselling is sometimes practiced outside a formal organisation, formal co-counselling organisations have developed leadership and support structures, including trainings and retreats.

Safety (in the sense of being very low risk) and the sense that a co-counselling session is a safe space is important to the methods.  There are strict rules of [[confidentiality]]. In most circumstances, the counsellor may not talk about a client's session without explicit and specific permission by the client. This is stricter than in other practices where practitioners discuss clients with supervisors, colleagues and sometimes with all sorts of other people.  The peer [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] makes a considerable contribution to a sense of trust.

The nature of the co-counselling session opens up the possibility for people to get in touch with [[emotion]]s that they would avoid in any other circumstance.  A belief in the value of working with emotions has become a core focus of the approach.  Co-counselling training emphasizes methods for accessing and working with emotions, and co-counsellors aim to develop and improve [[emotional competence]] through the practice. Evidence as to the actual effectiveness of this method is undemonstrated.

To get involved in co-counselling, it is usually first necessary to complete a Fundamentals course. The training involves learning how to carry out the roles of client and counsellor. Trainers may be counsellors or simply experienced members of the community.  It also covers the guidelines or rules affecting co-counselling for the particular organization. Differences in approach mean that each organization normally requires completion of one of its own courses as a prerequisite for membership, even if someone has already completed a course with another organization.

==Theoretical framework and assumptions==
The original [[theory]] of co-counselling centres on the concept of distress patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Jackins, Harvey (1965); ''The human side of human beings''; Rational Island, Seattle; {{ISBN|0-911214-60-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are patterns of [[behaviour]], that is, behaviour that tends to be repeated in a particular type of circumstance, that are irrational, unhelpful or compulsive. The theory is that these patterns are driven by the accumulated consequences in the [[mind]] of (not currently) conscious [[Memory|memories]] of past events in which the person was unable to express or discharge the emotion appropriate to the event. Co-counselling enables release from the patterns by allowing "emotional discharge" of the past hurt experiences. Such cathartic discharge includes crying, warm perspiration, trembling, yawning, laughing and relaxed, non-repetitive talking. In day-to-day life, these "discharging" actions may be limited by social norms, such as, for example, taboos around crying, which are widespread in many [[culture]]s.

Having temporary, undivided, supportive attention from another person often gives rise to strong feelings towards that person; your counsellor often becomes your best friend for life. Sometimes people "fall in love" with each other. This is similar to the phenomenon of [[transference]], particularly when one of the partners is felt to have more authority because, for instance, they are more experienced, are teachers of co-counselling, or have authority roles within the organisation. The organisations differ in the ways that they handle this. The inability to trust and feel in real relationships is sometimes exacerbated by the intimacy of co-counselling relationship, making transference a possibility. But participants are strongly encouraged and supported to counsel through these feelings, often leading to profound changes in their perspectives and abilities around closeness. For the most part, co-counselling relationships become life-long, therapeutic partnerships that enable the participant to have healthier relationships in general.

==Therapeutic context==
Many co-counsellors take the view, often quite strongly, that co-counselling is not psychotherapy.  In the beginning, this was because Re-evaluation Counseling decided not to draw on any discipline of psychotherapy for its theory and practice,&lt;ref&gt;Jackins, Harvey (1997); ''The list''; Rational Island, Seattle (p4, 1.019)&lt;/ref&gt; although RC did incorporate some ideas from psycho-analysis such as "unconscious promptings" which Jackins adapted and relabeled "restimulation".  A similar view is taken by some non-RC co-counsellors who regard psychotherapy as involving specialist techniques used by a therapist on a client and is therefore not peer and the client has little or no control over the process.&lt;ref&gt;Pyves, Gretchen (2000); [http://www.co-cornucopia.org.uk/coco/articles/therapy1.htm ''Co-Counseling versus Counseling''] accessed 2006-11-24&lt;/ref&gt;

Others consider that co-counselling is psychotherapeutic, in that it enables change or therapy to take place in the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]], [[soul]] affect or being of an individual.&lt;ref&gt;Evison, Rose &amp; Horobin, Richard  (1999); ''Co-Counseling as Therapy''; Co-Counseling Phoenix, Pitlochrie; available at [http://www.co-cornucopia.org.uk/coco/articles/cocother/index.html] accessed 2006-11-24&lt;/ref&gt; Co-counselling takes a positive view of the person (i.e. we are all essentially good), considers the mind and body as an integrated whole and acknowledges the value of catharsis; it is regarded as an approach within [[humanistic psychology]], a view that would be rejected by some within RC. &lt;ref&gt;Jackins, Harvey (1980); [https://www.rc.org/publication/books/br/br_459_hj ''The Working Class, the World, and RC''] accessed 2015-11-27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Re-evaluation Counseling==
{{Main|Re-evaluation Counseling}}

The core organization structure of RC consists of classes and local communities set up by experienced co-counsellors, which are in turn organized by regions and country.

The term "re-evaluation" refers to the client's need to rethink their past distress experiences after the [[emotion]]al hurt in those experiences have been discharged, and thereby regain ("re-emerge" with) their natural [[Intelligence|intellectual]] and emotional capacities.  The RC organization and literature do not accept the description of its practice as [[psychotherapy]], maintaining instead that the process of developing distress patterns that dissolve through emotional discharge in the context of appreciative attention is simply a natural process that does not imply either psychopathology on the part of the individual or the need for professional treatment. Re-evaluation Counseling regards other forms of "mainstream counselling" and psychotherapy in general as frequently inadequate attempts to bring about relief from distress using methods that do not focus on discharge and re-emergence.

In RC, the client and counsellor are expected to work co-operatively, participants are expected to provide non-judgmental active listening and to "contradict" the misinformation or other conditions thought to be associated with distress patterns. RC also engages techniques such as "non-permissive" counselling, in which the counsellor intervenes to "interrupt" client patterns without the consent of the client. The structure of RC is one of clearly defined leadership, to encourage clarity in the difficult struggles many people have to achieve breakthroughs against their distresses. RC encourages counsellors to think very hard about all possible ways to assist the client in discharging.

RC approaches the issue of feelings between co-counsellors by having a strict "no-socialising" rule. RC co-counsellors are expected not to socialise or have social or [[Intimate relationship|sexual relationships]] with other co-counsellors unless these [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] pre-dated their becoming co-counsellors.  RC specifically rejects the label "transference" for this phenomenon, as this is seen as part of a "symptomatic" method typical in [[psychology]]; the original theory of co-counselling (from RC) teaches that the best thing to do in these circumstances is repeatedly counsel on, and "discharge" about, such feelings. In addition, methods of "getting attention out of distress" are available which help with the difficulty of "switching roles" between counsellor and client. When taught correctly, counsellors are soon able to grasp the difference between counselling relationships and those from outside life. However, sometimes there is a marked pull to "socialise" or confuse the boundaries of the co-counselling relationship with other types of relationships. This is one reason why many consider a well-organised community of co-counsellors with clear rules to be essential in the successful practise of co-counselling.

Re-evaluation Counseling places a high importance on the need to understand and adhere to a comprehensive theory about the nature of the universe and of human beings (known in general as the "Benign Reality"), the best ways of assisting the discharge process and of pro-liberation attitudes in co-counselling. RCers believe that, when taken together, these enable the counsellor to keep a clear picture of the client's "re-emergence" and are therefore very effective. People disagreeing with the theoretical perspective are asked to think and discharge on the points at issue before actively challenging such perspectives. The main aim is to provide a safe, stable and supportive atmosphere within which people can client skillfully and also lead "re-emergent lives" where they are not dependent in a therapeutic sense, but instead become more energetic and effective (a state known as "zestfulness" in RC).

==Co-Counselling International==
{{Main|Co-Counselling International}}

Co-Counselling International (CCI) was started in 1974 as a breakaway from Re-evaluation Counseling by [[John Heron]], who was at the time director of the Human Potential Research Project, [[University of Surrey]] UK, and Tom Sargent and Dency Sargent from [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[Connecticut]], [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Heron, John (1998); ''Co-Counselling''; South Pacific Centre for Human Inquiry, Auckland; available at [http://www.co-cornucopia.org.uk/coco/articles/hman1fun.html]; first edition (1974); Human Potential Research Project, University of Surrey, Guildford&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other breakaways from RC, which involved changes of leadership but otherwise continued to practice in similar ways to RC, the CCI break was ideological, and CCI developed in significantly different ways. The differences are in practice, [[theory]] and organisation.

In practice, the client in CCI co-counselling is wholly in charge of the session. In other words, client and counsellor do not work co-operatively. The counsellor only intervenes in accordance with one of three levels of "contract"—free attention, normal and intensive—which are defined in CCI's principles. The only requirement of the counsellor is that they give "free attention" (that is, full supportive attention) to the client. The other two contracts constitute invitations to the counsellor to make interventions from within those permitted if they feel it is appropriate. The intensive contract can be similar to the RC way of working, although the counsellor is still not permitted to intervene as flexibly as in RC.

The original theory of co-counselling is taught in the CCI fundamentals training courses, and participants learn techniques for releasing, or "discharging", emotions. However, the theory is not seen as a constraint within CCI, and co-counsellors draw on the whole range of [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] theory and methods including [[Analytical psychology|analytical]], [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive]]-[[Behaviorism|behavioural]] and [[transpersonal]] as well as [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic]] approaches. The principal constraint is that the client must be able to work self-directedly.

Organisationally, CCI is a peer network with no core structure. Local and national networks have a variety of organisation. Classes and activities are organised by individuals or groups acting self-directedly. John Heron's status within the network has always been as an equal member, although inevitably as a founder member and activist for some 15 years and the person who developed much of the thinking behind CCI, there was a certain amount of transference on him. Heron now lives in [[New Zealand]] and is involved with the CCI network there.

CCI approaches the issue of personal [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] between co-counsellors as a matter for raising awareness. CCI co-counsellors may and do have the whole range of personal relationships with other co-counsellors. However, new co-counsellors are encouraged not to develop new non-co-counselling relationships with other co-counsellors until they have more experience and experienced co-counsellors will often have people with whom they only have a co-counselling relationship. Teachers of co-counselling are strongly discouraged from having [[Intimate relationship|sexual relationships]] with people they have taught.

==Relations between CCI and RC==
{{Disputed-section|date=March 2008}}
The existence of other co-counselling organisations is generally not mentioned in RC, and RC co-counsellors are often not aware of their existence.

Amongst those within RC who know about it, CCI is often seen as an "attack organisation" and was specifically condemned as such in many private and public conversations by Jackins, who claimed that Heron had started it against a specific agreement not to, and in breach of RC guidelines he had previously agreed to. In turn, Heron and many of his supporters claimed that RC was [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[cult]]-like, and later, that Jackins engaged in [[sexual abuse]] of clients. RC supporters parried that CCI fostered a [[Human sexuality|sexually]]-liberal atmosphere that blurred the boundaries of co-counselling and [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]]. 

The history of co-counselling including its origins with RC is normally taught on CCI Fundamentals courses.&lt;ref&gt;Evison, Rose &amp; Horobin, Richard (1985); ''How to Change Yourself and Your world''; Co-Counselling Phoenix, Pitlochrie; {{ISBN|1-870224-01-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CCI, by its nature, has no corporate opinion about RC, and individual CCI co-counsellors have their own views.  Most CCI co-counsellors have a benevolent view toward RC, regarding it as a different, alternative approach to co-counselling.  Membership of RC is not a bar to membership of CCI, and a few people manage to do both despite the RC ban.

The '''Composite Health Care System''' (CHCS) is a [[medical informatics]] system designed by [[Science Applications International Corporation]] (SAIC) and used by all [[United States]] and OCONUS military health care centers. In 1988, SAIC won a competition for the original $1.02 billion contract to design, develop, and implement CHCS.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. J. Robert Beyster with Peter Economy, The SAIC Solution: How We Built an $8 Billion Employee-Owned Technology Company, John Wiley &amp; Sons (2007) p.88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components and characteristics==
CHCS is module based: modules include RAD (radiology), LAB (Laboratory), PHR (Pharmacy), PAS (Patient Appointing &amp; Scheduling), MCP (Managed Care Program; used to support TRICARE enrollees by enrolling them to Primary Care Managers), PAD (Patient Administration): MRT (Medical Records Tracking), MSA (Medical Service Accounting) medical billing, WAM (Workload Assignment Module), DTS (Dietetics), CLN (CLinical: Nursing, Physician, and Allied Health), DAA (Database Administration), ADM (Ambulatory Data Module) Medical Coding of outpatient visits, and TOOLS (FileMan).  

Currently all appointments are booked in CHCS, except for Walk-Ins and Telephone Consults, which can now be booked in AHLTA.  CHCS is a text based BBS/ANSI like display accessed via DEC VT320 terminal emulation. CHCS supports outpatient Order Entry (LAB, RAD, PHR, Consults (ancillary procedures), one-time and scheduled/multiple appointment consults.  CHCS can also support Inpatient charting and Order Entry with multi-paging with a page for each ward the patient is transferred, but this feature is not fielded/enabled at many medical centers.  Instead Clinicomp's Essentris product is deployed at all MHS hospitals and has replaced the use of CHCS Inpatient module for nurse charting.  An interface solution to allow Essentris Orders to be transferred into CHCS order entry is being deployed.

==AHLTA==
{{Main|AHLTA}}
Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (commonly referred to as AHLTA) is the clinical documentation engine for the Physicians to write their notes, put in orders, document procedures performed and provide the basis of medical coding information.  This information is then sent into CHCS and its subsystems (ADM - ambulatory data module) provide the official repository of the medical coding information and handle the transmission of those encounters via the Comprehensive Ambulatory Patient Encounter Record (CAPER) interface.  The clinical data is brought into the M2 DataMart for use in research, operational metrics, trend analysis, and many other business intelligence processes/products.  AHLTA information is also contained in a Central Data Repository (CDR).  This CDR contains information from AHLTA, CHCS, and AHLTA-Theater.  The AHLTA CDR is a comprehensive full scale world-wide EHR repository.

CHCS shares its original codebase with the VA's [[VistA]] system. Since its inception it has been customized for supporting the Military and their family members.

Security in CHCS works by a number of mechanisms and includes the concept of least privilege.  You are assigned the minimum needed for your work duties.  This limits your access to sensitive data both protected by the Privacy Act 1974 and PHI protected under HIPAA.  

AdHoc reports can be written using the FileMan tools and can be quite powerful if the files are designed with that in mind.  Many CHCS files are now more easily accessed with [[MUMPS]] routinues that can make more efficient use of the internal data structures.  More information about FileMan can be found at [http://www.hardhats.org www.hardhats.org]. CHCS, which now runs on [[InterSystems Caché]] with the MUMPS globals being converted into Caché objects and the MUMPS routines accessing them, now can be accessed with .NET tools to query the Caché database.  Many facilities have developed special queries of CHCS or new tools to facilitate workflow and processes.  One such tool is an intranet web application to facilitate printing of lab specimen labels to special printers with formats not possible with the regular CHCS print devices and label printing methods.

[[CITPO]] (now known as Defense Health Information Management Systems ([[DHIMS]])) began the implementation of AHLTA, the DoD's Electronic Health Record(EHR) system, in January 2004. The system links the 481 Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) worldwide as well as service members deployed abroad to the EHR, ultimately supporting 9.2 million MHS beneficiaries. The introduction of AHLTA, previously known as the Composite Health Care System II, ushered in a significant new era in health care for the MHS and the nation. AHLTA Version 3.3.3.X with client update 9.1 currently fielded to physician and clinic staff workstations.  DHIMS also manages the AHLTA-Theater program that provides EHR capabilities to deployed users with important store and forward capabilities when communications are unavailable.

AHLTA and a significant portion of CHCS are slated to be replaced by a VA/DoD interagency iEHR program.  The iEHR will bring together the strong Health IT resources of both the VA and the DoD to acquire the next generation EHR capabilities for both departments.

==Record Duplication==
As with all large hospital information systems, there are occasions that despite training and best intentions, duplicate patient records are created.  CHCS has a function to merge patients, but not to unmerge.  AHLTA also has merges performed on patients in its Oracle database and successful attempts are made to un-merge patients and their associated medical/encounter data where diligent research has determined that mistakes were made with the identification of patients and to split off encounter records from patients that are blended into the single AHLTA record.  Master Patient Indexing is a feature of the AHLTA Clinical Data Repository (CDR).  Over 100 CHCS host systems, DEERS (Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System), and AHLTA Theater (the version being used in Iraq and other areas) all contributed patients into the CDR when it was created from 25 month data pulls back in 2004.  Each CHCS patient registration links into AHLTA, some link to existing patients, but others are newly created.  Complexity with patient names and methods of identifying them with other demographics can lead to duplication, both in a local CHCS system and in the central AHLTA CDR.  There is currently a DHIMS contract working on improving the processes and automating the routines to resolve duplicate patients and prevent their creation in future.

[[Electrochemical regeneration]] of [[activated carbon]] adsorbents such as granular activated carbon present an alternative to thermal regeneration or land filling at the end of useful [[adsorbent]] life. Continuous adsorption-electrochemical regeneration encompasses the adsorption and regeneration steps, typically separated in the bulk of industrial processes due to long adsorption equilibrium times (ranging from hours to months), into one continuous system. This is possible using a non-porous, [[electrical conduction|electrically conducting]] carbon derivative called Nyex. The non-porosity of Nyex allows it to achieve its full adsorptive capacity within a few minutes{{r|Brown2004}} and its electrical conductivity allows it to form part of the electrode in an [[electrochemical cell]].{{r|LN}} As a result of its properties Nyex can undergo quick adsorption and fast electrochemical regeneration in a combined adsorption-electrochemical regeneration cell achieving 100% regeneration efficiency.{{r|bbc}}

==Continuous adsorption-regeneration cell==
The adsorption regeneration process is divided into three key elements which occur in different parts of the cell. All three occur continuously and simultaneously, with parameters such as [[electric charge|charge]] passed, rate of [[effluent]] in/outflow and air inlet rate varied according to pollutant type and concentration.

===Pollutant contacting and adsorption===
Polluted effluent is added into the bottom of the cell and mixed with the adsorbent in the adsorption zone 1.1 where adsorption of the pollutants onto the surface of the adsorbent occurs. Mixing between the adsorbent and the polluted effluent is promoted by air [[sparging (chemistry)|spargers]] at the base of the cell which also facilitate the migration of the adsorbent upwards and into the cell's [[sedimentation]] zone.

===Adsorbent-treated effluent separation===
The adsorbent is separated from the now treated effluent in the sedimentation zone where the density of the adsorbent allows separation by gravitational sedimentation. The treated effluent is allowed to overflow out of the cell.

===Adsorbent electrochemical regeneration===
The adsorbent, loaded with adsorbed pollutant on its surface sediments and forms a bed in the regeneration zone in the cell. The mass of the Nyex causes the bed to travel down the regeneration column slowly and eventually pass back into the cell. During the journey down the regeneration column, a DC [[electric current|current]] is passed across the electrochemical cell of which the adsorbent forms the [[anode]]. The applied current causes the pollutants adsorbed on the surface of the Nyex to be electrochemically oxidised regenerating the adsorbent surface restoring its full adsorptive capacity completing the adsorption-regeneration cycle.{{r|Brown2004}}{{r|Brown2007}}

==Applications==
This technology is currently being incorporated into a variety of industries for applications in effluent treatment areas such as:
*[[Groundwater remediation]]
*[[Volatile Organic Compound]] Removal
*Dye-house Effluent De-Colourisation
*Electrochemical Disinfection

The '''Dyson Airblade''' is an electric [[hand dryer]] made by the Wiltshire, UK based company [[Dyson (company)|Dyson]], found in public [[bathroom]]s across the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/5402024.stm| title = Dyson unveils faster hand dryer | date = 2006-10-03 | accessdate = 2008-01-05 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was introduced in the UK in 2006 and in the United States in the latter part of 2007.

== Description ==
Instead of using a wide jet of heated air, Dyson Airblade uses a thin layer of unheated air travelling at around {{convert|400|mph|m/s km/h|abbr=on}} as a [[squeegee]] to remove water, rather than using heat to [[evaporate]] the water.&lt;ref name=engadget&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.engadget.com/2006/10/03/dysons-airblade-dries-hands-with-400mph-blast-of-air/| title = Dyson's Airblade dries hands with 400MPH blast of air | date = 2006-10-03 | accessdate = 2008-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dyson Airblade is claimed by its manufacturer to dry hands in 10 seconds and to use less electricity than conventional hand dryers.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

The first commercially available high-speed, horizontal-wiping air dryer was the Mitsubishi Jet Towel, invented in 1993 and available in the United States since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mitsubishi Jet Towel November 27, 2009 Robin No comments |url=http://www.fastlec.co.uk/blog/?p=19 |title=Mitsubishi Jet Towel |publisher=Fastlec |date=2009-11-27 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several technical differences among  electric hand dryers, such as airspeed, water containment, energy efficiency, use of heat, type of filter, motor lifespan and power usage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gizmodo.com/299082/mitsubishi-jet-towel-vs-dyson-airblade-pre+game-trash-talk-and-tale-of-the-tape Mitsubishi Jet Towel vs. Dyson Airblade Pre-Game Trash Talk and Tale of the Tape&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The same technology is used by Dyson in the [[Dyson Air Multiplier|Air Multiplier]] [[Mechanical fan|fan]] to create a cooling air stream for personal comfort.

==Energy efficiency==
The Dyson Airblade is 69% more energy-efficient than conventional hand-dryers and 97% more cost effective than paper towels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dysoncanada.ca/en-CA/hand-dryers/calculator/calcs.aspx|title=Dyson Calculations|website=dysoncanada.ca|language=en-CA|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Airblade is cheaper to operate because it does not require hot air which greatly increases electricity consumption. The Airblade is also cheaper to operate due to decreased drying times. The Airblade V can dry off hands in 12 seconds, versus 25 for a traditional hand dryer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dysoncanada.ca/medialibrary/Commercial_V5/Downloads/ProductBrochure/V-quiet/84375_DYS_AB_CA_256A_RANGE-BROCHURE_REFRESH_CA-ENG_NOCROPS.pdf|title=Dyson Airblade V Product brochure|last=|first=|date=|website=|page=6|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drying time==
A comparative test found that both [[paper towel]]s and the Airblade dried hands quickly, achieving around 90% dryness in about ten seconds, supporting Dyson's claim of approximately ten seconds of drying time.&lt;ref name="europeantissue.com"/&gt; A conventional warm air dryer took about forty-seven seconds.

==Hygiene==
[[File:DysonAirblade.jpg|thumb|Dyson Airblade (view from top)]]
In the United States, Dyson worked with the [[National Sanitation Foundation|NSF]] to become the only certified hand dryer under Protocol P335 for Hygienic Commercial Hand Dryers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsf.org/Certified/Protocols/Listings.asp?Company=3E300&amp;Standard=P335 |title=NSF PROTOCOL P335 Hygienic Commercial Hand Dryers |publisher=Nsf.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nsf.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nsf.org/business/engineering_and_research/NSF_P335_Q&amp;A.pdf |title=Questions &amp; Answers about the new NSF Protocol P335’ |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126104827/http://nsf.org/business/engineering_and_research/NSF_P335_Q%26A.pdf |archivedate=November 26, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Society of Public Health has given the Dyson Airblade hand dryer its first hygiene accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rsph.org.uk/about-us/news/dyson-airblade-tm-hand-dryer-first-to-gain-new-hygiene-accreditation.html|title=Dyson Airblade TM hand dryer first to gain new hygiene accreditation|last=RSPH|website=rsph.org.uk|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper was presented at the 17th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Munich, Germany in 2007 by the [[University of Bradford]] and Dyson showing that for a set drying time of 10 seconds, the Airblade led to significantly less bacterial transfer than with the other driers (''p'' &lt; 0.05). When the latter were used for longer (30–35 s) the trend was for the Airblade to still perform better; however, these results did not reach statistical significance (''p'' &gt; 0.05). In addition the study showed that rubbing hands whilst using the driers counteracted the reduction in overall bacterial numbers at all anatomical sites.&lt;ref&gt;

Hygiene associated with the product has been questioned in research by the University of Westminster Trade Group, London and sponsored by the paper towel industry the European Tissue Symposium, which suggests that use increases the amount of bacteria on the fingertips by about 42%; paper towels reduced the number of bacteria by 50 to 75%, while warm air dryers increased bacteria by 194%. The report found that "the  manufacturer’s  claim  that  the  tested  JAD [Airblade] is 'the most hygienic hand  dryer'  is  confirmed ... assuming that the term 'hand dryer' refers to electric devices only because its performance in terms of the numbers of all types of bacteria remaining on the hands of users compared to paper towels was significantly worse."&lt;ref name="europeantissue.com"&gt;[http://www.europeantissue.com/pdfs/090402-2008%20WUS%20Westminster%20University%20hygiene%20study,%20nov2008.pdf A comparative study of three different hand drying methods: paper towel, warm air dryer, jet air dryer’] by Keith Redway and Shameem Fawdar of the School of Biosciences, University of Westminster London&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model history==
[[File:White Dyson Airblade, Ahrenshoop (DSC04789).jpg|thumbnail|upright|Airblade (AB14) Mk. 2]]
In early 2013, three new models of the Dyson Airblade were introduced: the Airblade Mk. 2, the Airblade V, and the Airblade Tap. The Mk. 2 uses a similar design as the original model, but has increased jet air speed from {{convert|400|-|430|mph|m/s km/h|abbr=on}}, and new soundproofing makes the new model quieter than the old one. The Airblade V is a hands-under hand dryer that complies with the [[Americans With Disabilities Act]].

The Airblade Tap is a non-contact bathroom faucet that both washes and dries hands. It eliminates the need to move to a separate area to dry hands, and therefore eliminates any water dripped on the floor.&lt;ref name=ABTap&gt;{{cite web|title=Dyson Airblade Tap hand dryer|url=http://www.dysonairblade.co.uk/hand-dryers/airblade-tap/airblade-tap.aspx|website=Dyson airblade|accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three hand dryers use a new Digital Slim Motor, the Dyson V4.

==Controversies==
{{see also|Dyson (company)#Excel Dryer lawsuit}} 
On December 5, 2012, a lawsuit by competitor [[Excel Dryer]] was filed against Dyson, claiming that Dyson's advertising comparing the Airblade to the Excel Dryer XLerator were deceptive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docstoc.com/docs/137817219/xcelerator-v-dyson Case 3:12-cv-30211-MAP - Docstoc]&lt;/ref&gt;  Dyson's advertisements stated the XLerator produces twice as much carbon dioxide, is worse for the environment, and costs more to operate than the Airblade.  Excel Dryer charged that Dyson was falsifying its comparisons by submitting a 20-second dry time for the XLerator to the Materials Systems Laboratory at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], rather than Excel Dryer's tested 12-second dry time, thus inflating energy consumption figures in the Airblade's favor.

In 2014, a paper was published in the ''Journal of Hospital Infection'' (2014;88:199-206), showing that high-speed hand dryers such as the Dyson Airblade can spread large numbers of a harmless test bacteria through the air in the vicinity. The Dyson company challenged the study with its own criticism of the methods and conclusions.&lt;ref name="Melville"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Melville|first1=Nancy A.|title=Hand Dryers Blow Bacteria Into Air, Spread Germs|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/836223#vp_2|accessdate=2017-01-21|work=medscape.com|publisher=WebMD LLC|date=December 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

M., Michel, M. K., &amp; Teti, L. O. (1994). The development of emotion regulation and dysregulation: A clinical perspective. (Vol. 59, pp. 73-100). Wiley-Blackwell. {{jstor|1166139}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be defined as [[extrinsic]] and [[intrinsic]] processes responsible for monitoring, evaluating, and modifying emotional reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = R.

Emotional regulation is a complex process that involves [[Initiation|initiating]], inhibiting, or modulating one's state or [[Behavior#Psychology|behavior]] in a given situation{{spaced ndash}}for example the subjective experience (feelings), cognitive responses (thoughts), emotion-related physiological responses (for example heart rate or hormonal activity), and emotion-related behavior (bodily actions or expressions). Functionally, emotional regulation can also refer to processes such as the tendency to focus one's attention to a task and the ability to suppress inappropriate behavior under instruction. Emotional regulation is a highly significant function in human life.

Every day, people are continually exposed to a wide variety of potentially arousing [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]]. Inappropriate, extreme or unchecked emotional reactions to such stimuli could impede functional fit within society; therefore, people must engage in some form of emotion regulation almost all of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Koole, S. L. (2009). The psychology of emotion regulation: An integrative review. (23 ed., Vol. 1, pp. 4-41). Psychology Press. Retrieved from http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02699930802619031&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, [[emotional dysregulation]] has been defined as difficulties in controlling the influence of emotional [[arousal]] on the organization and quality of thoughts, actions, and interactions. Individuals who are emotionally dysregulated exhibit patterns of responding in which there is a mismatch between their goals, responses, and/or modes of expression, and the demands of the [[social environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zeman | first1 = J. | last2 = Cassano | first2 = M. | last3 = Perry-Parrish | first3 = C. | last4 = Stegall | first4 = S. | year = 2006 | title = Emotion regulation in children and adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 155–168 | doi=10.1097/00004703-200604000-00014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there is a significant association between emotion dysregulation and symptoms of [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], [[Eating disorder|eating pathology]], and [[substance abuse]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Aldao, A., Nolen-Hoeksema, S., &amp; Schweizer, S.

New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==

===Process model===
The process model of emotion regulation is based upon the modal model of emotion. The modal model of emotion suggests that the emotion generation process occurs in a particular sequence over time. This sequence occurs as follows:
#Situation: the sequence begins with a situation (real or imagined) that is emotionally relevant.
#[[Attention]]: attention is directed towards the emotional situation.
#[[Cognitive appraisal|Appraisal]]: the emotional situation is evaluated and interpreted.
#Response: an emotional response is generated, giving rise to loosely coordinated changes in experiential, behavioral, and physiological response systems.
Because an emotional response (4.) can cause changes to a situation (1.), this model involves a feedback loop from (4.) Response to (1.) Situation. This feedback loop suggests that the emotion generation process can occur recursively, is ongoing, and dynamic.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Gross, J. J. &amp; Thompson, R. A. (2007). Emotion regulation: Conceptual foundations. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation'' (pp. 3-24). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process model contends that each of these four points in the emotion generation process can be subjected to regulation. From this conceptualization, the process model posits five different families of emotion regulation that correspond to the regulation of a particular point in the emotion generation process. They occur in the following order:&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gross | first1 = J. J. | year = 1998 | title = The emerging field of emotion regulation: An integrative review | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 271–299 | doi=10.1037/1089-2680.2.3.271}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Situation selection
#Situation modification
#Attentional deployment
#Cognitive change
#Response modulation
The process model also divides these emotion regulation strategies into two categories: antecedent-focused and response-focused. Antecedent-focused strategies (i.e., situation selection, situation modification, attentional deployment, and cognitive change) occur before an emotional response is fully generated. Response-focused strategies (i.e., response modulation) occur after an emotional response is fully generated.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gross | first1 = J. J. | year = 1998 | title = Antecedent- and response-focused emotion regulation: Divergent consequences for experience, expression, and physiology | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 224–237 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.74.1.224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategies==

===Situation selection===
Situation selection involves choosing to avoid or approach an emotionally relevant situation. If a person selects to avoid or disengage from an emotionally relevant situation, he or she is decreasing the likelihood of experiencing an emotion. Alternatively, if a person selects to approach or engage with an emotionally relevant situation, he or she is increasing the likelihood of experiencing an emotion.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Typical examples of situation selection may be seen interpersonally, such as when a parent removes his or her child from an emotionally unpleasant situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fox | first1 = N. A. | last2 = Calkins | first2 = S. D. | year = 2003 | title = The development of self-control of emotion: Intrinsic and extrinsic influences | url = | journal = Motivation and Emotion | volume = 27 | issue = 1| pages = 7–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of situation selection may also be seen in psychopathology. For example, avoidance of social situations to regulate emotions is particularly pronounced for those with [[social anxiety disorder]]&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wells | first1 = A. | last2 = Papageorgiou | first2 = C. | year = 1998 | title = Social phobia: Effects of external attention on anxiety, negative beliefs, and perspective taking | url = | journal = Behavior Therapy | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 357–370 | doi=10.1016/s0005-7894(98)80037-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[avoidant personality disorder]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Effective situation selection is not always an easy task. For instance, humans display difficulties [[Affective forecasting|predicting their emotional responses]] to future events. Therefore, they may have trouble making accurate and appropriate decisions about which emotionally relevant situations to approach or to avoid.&lt;ref&gt;Loewenstein, G. (2007). Affect regulation and affective forecasting. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation ''(pp.180-203). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Situation modification===
Situation modification involves efforts to modify a situation so as to change its emotional impact.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Situation modification refers specifically to altering one's external, physical environment. Altering one's "internal" environment to regulate emotion is called cognitive change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Examples of situation modification may include injecting humor into a speech to elicit laughter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hofmann | first1 = S. G. | last2 = Gerlach | first2 = A. L. | last3 = Wender | first3 = A. | last4 = Roth | first4 = W T. | year = 1997 | title = Speech disturbances and gaze behavior during public speaking in subtypes of social phobia | url = | journal = Journal of Anxiety Disorders | volume = 11 | issue = 6| pages = 573–585 | doi=10.1016/s0887-6185(97)00040-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; or extending the physical distance between oneself and another person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Edelmann | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Iwawaki | first2 = S. | year = 1987 | title = Self-reported expression and consequences of embarrassment in the United Kingdom and Japan | url = | journal = Psychologia | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 205–216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attentional deployment===
Attentional deployment involves directing one's attention towards or away from an emotional situation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

====Distraction====
[[Distraction]], an example of attentional deployment, is an early selection strategy, which involves diverting one's attention away from an emotional stimulus and towards other content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sheppes | first1 = G. | last2 = Gross | first2 = J. J. | year = 2011 | title = Is timing everything? Temporal considerations in emotion regulation | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review | volume = 15 | issue = 4| pages = 319–331 | doi=10.1177/1088868310395778}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distraction has been shown to reduce the intensity of painful&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seminowicz | first1 = D. A. | last2 = Davis | first2 = K. D. | year = 2007 | title = Interactions of pain intensity and cognitive load: the brain stays on task | url = | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 1412–1422 | doi=10.1093/cercor/bhl052 | pmid=16908493}}&lt;/ref&gt; and emotional experiences,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Urry | first1 = H. L. | year = 2010 | title = Seeing, thinking, and feeling: emotion-regulating effects of gaze-directed cognitive reappraisal | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 125–135 | doi=10.1037/a0017434}}&lt;/ref&gt; to decrease facial responding and neural activation in the amygdala associated with emotion,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kanske|first=Philipp|last2=Heissler|first2=Janine|last3=Schönfelder|first3=Sandra|last4=Bongers|first4=André|last5=Wessa|first5=Michèle|date=2011-06-01|title=How to Regulate Emotion? Neural Networks for Reappraisal and Distraction|url=https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/21/6/1379/346602/How-to-Regulate-Emotion-Neural-Networks-for|journal=Cerebral Cortex|volume=21|issue=6|pages=1379–1388|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhq216|issn=1047-3211}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to alleviate emotional distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nolen-Hoeksema | first1 = S. | last2 = Morrow | first2 = J. | year = 1993 | title = Effects of rumination and distraction on naturally occurring depressed mood | url = | journal = Cognition and Emotion | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 561–570 | doi=10.1080/02699939308409206}}&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to [[#Reappraisal|reappraisal]], individuals show a relative preference to engage in distraction when facing stimuli of high negative emotional intensity. This is because distraction easily filters out high-intensity emotional content, which would otherwise be relatively difficult to appraise and process.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sheppes | first1 = G. | last2 = Scheibe | first2 = S. | last3 = Suri | first3 = G. | last4 = Gross | first4 = J. J. | year = 2011 | title = Emotion-regulation choice | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 22 | issue = 11| pages = 1391–1396 | doi=10.1177/0956797611418350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rumination====
[[Rumination (psychology)|Rumination]], an example of attentional deployment,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; is defined as the passive and repetitive focusing of one's attention on one's symptoms of distress and the causes and consequences of these symptoms. Rumination is generally considered to be a maladaptive emotion regulation strategy, as it tends to exacerbate emotional distress. It has also been implicated in a host of disorders including [[Major depressive disorder|major depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nolen-Hoeksema | first1 = S. | last2 = Wisco | first2 = B. E. | last3 = Lyubomirsky | first3 = S. | year = 2008 | title = Rethinking rumination | url = | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 3 | issue = 5| pages = 400–424 | doi=10.1111/j.1745-6924.2008.00088.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Worry====
[[Worry]], an example of attentional deployment,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; involves directing attention to thoughts and images concerned with potentially negative events in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Borkovec | first1 = T. D. | last2 = Robinson | first2 = E. | last3 = Pruzinsky | first3 = T. | last4 = DePree | first4 = J. A. | year = 1983 | title = Preliminary exploration of worry: Some characteristics and processes | url = | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 9–16 | doi=10.1016/0005-7967(83)90121-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; By focusing on these events, worrying serves to aid in the downregulation of intense negative emotion and physiological activity.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; While worry may sometimes involve problem solving, incessant worry is generally considered maladaptive, being a common feature of [[anxiety disorders]], particularly [[generalized anxiety disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Borkovec | first1 = T. D. | last2 = Inz | first2 = J. | year = 1990 | title = The nature of worry in generalized anxiety disorder: A predominance of thought activity | url = | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 153–158 | doi=10.1016/0005-7967(90)90027-g}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thought suppression====
[[Thought suppression]], an example of attentional deployment, involves efforts to redirect one's attention from specific thoughts and mental images to other content so as to modify one's emotional state.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Campbell-Sills, L. &amp; Barlow, D. H. (2007). Incorporating emotion regulation into conceptualizations and treatments of anxiety and mood disorders. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation'' (pp. 542-559). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Although thought suppression may provide temporary relief from undesirable thoughts, it may ironically end up spurring the production of even more unwanted thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wegner | first1 = D. M. | last2 = Zanakos | first2 = S. | year = 1994 | title = Chronic thought suppression | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 615–640 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1994.tb00311.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy is generally considered maladaptive, being most associated with [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

===Cognitive change===
Cognitive change involves changing how one appraises a situation so as to alter its emotional meaning.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

====Reappraisal====
Reappraisal, an example of cognitive change, is a late selection strategy, which involves reinterpreting the meaning of an event so as to alter its emotional impact.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For example, this might involve reinterpreting an event by broadening one's perspective to see "the bigger picture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schartau | first1 = P. E. | last2 = Dalgleish | first2 = T. | last3 = Dunn | first3 = B.

As opposed to distraction, individuals show a relative preference to engage in reappraisal when facing stimuli of low negative emotional intensity because these stimuli are relatively easy to appraise and process.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Reappraisal is generally considered to be an adaptive emotion-regulation strategy. Compared to suppression, which is correlated negatively with many psychological disorders,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; reappraisal can be associated with better interpersonal outcomes, and can be positively related to wellbeing.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gross, James |author2=John, Oliver |title=Individual differences in two emotion regulation processes: Implications for affect, relationships, and well-being|pmid=12916575|url=http://doi.apa.org/journals/psp/85/2/348.pdf|year=2003|volume=85|issue=2|pages=348–62|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.85.2.348}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some researchers argue that context is important when evaluating the adaptiveness of a strategy, suggesting that in some contexts reappraisal may be maladaptive.&lt;ref name="Tamir, M. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tamir | first1 = M | year = 2009 | title = What do people want to feel and why?

====Distancing====
Distancing, an example of cognitive change, involves taking on an independent, third-person perspective when evaluating an emotional event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ochsner | first1 = K. N. | last2 = Gross | first2 = J. J. | year = 2008 | title = Cognitive emotion regulation: Insights from social, cognitive, affective neuroscience | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 153–158 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00566.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distancing has been shown to be an adaptive form of self-reflection, facilitating the emotional processing of negatively valenced stimuli,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ayduk | first1 = O. | last2 = Kross | first2 = E. | year = 2009 | title = Asking why from a distance facilitates emotional processing: A reanalysis of Wimalaweera and Moulds (2008) | url = | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 88–92 | doi=10.1016/j.brat.2008.06.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; reducing emotional and cardiovascular reactivity to negative stimuli, and increasing problem-solving behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ayduk | first1 = O. | last2 = Kross | first2 = E. | year = 2010 | title = From a distance: Implications of spontaneous self-distancing for adaptive self-reflection | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 98 | issue = 5| pages = 809–829 | doi=10.1037/a0019205 | pmid=20438226 | pmc=2881638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Humor====
[[Humor]], an example of cognitive change, has been shown to be an effective emotion regulation strategy. Specifically, positive, good-natured humor has been shown to effectively upregulate positive emotion and downregulate negative emotion. On the other hand, negative, mean-spirited humor is less effective in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Samson | first1 = A. C. | last2 = Gross | first2 = J. J. | year = 2012 | title = Humour as emotion regulation: The differential consequences of negative versus positive humour | url = | journal = Cognition and Emotion | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 375–384 | doi=10.1080/02699931.2011.585069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response modulation===
Response modulation involves attempts to directly influence experiential, behavioral, and physiological response systems.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

====Expressive suppression====
[[Expressive Suppression|Expressive suppression]], an example of response modulation, involves inhibiting emotional expressions. It has been shown to effectively reduce facial expressivity, subjective feelings of positive emotion, heart rate, and [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic activation]]. However, the research is mixed regarding whether this strategy is effective for downregulating negative emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dan-Glauser | first1 = E. S. | last2 = Gross | first2 = J. J. | year = 2011 | title = The temporal dynamics of two response-focused forms of emotion regulation: Experiential, expressive, and autonomic consequences | url = | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 1309–1322 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-8986.2011.01191.x| pmc = 3136552 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also shown that expressive suppression may have negative social consequences, correlating with reduced personal connections and greater difficulties forming relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Butler | first1 = E. A. | last2 = Egloff | first2 = B. | last3 = Wlhelm | first3 = F. H. | last4 = Smith | first4 = N. C. | last5 = Erickson | first5 = E. A. | last6 = Gross | first6 = J. J. | year = 2003 | title = The social consequences of expressive suppression | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 48–67 | doi = 10.1037/1528-3542.3.1.48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expressive suppression is generally considered to be a maladaptive emotion-regulation strategy. Compared to reappraisal, it is correlated positively with many psychological disorders,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; associated with worse interpersonal outcomes, is negatively related to wellbeing,&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; and requires the mobilization of a relatively substantial amount of cognitive resources.&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=Jane|title=The Cognitive Consequences of Concealing Feelings|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=August 2004|volume=13|issue=4|pages=131–134|doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00291.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some researchers argue that context is important when evaluating the adaptiveness of a strategy, suggesting that in some contexts suppression may be adaptive.&lt;ref name="Tamir, M. 2009"/&gt;

====Drug use====
[[Drug]] use, an example of response modulation, can be a way to alter emotion-associated physiological responses. For example, [[Ethanol|alcohol]] can produce [[sedative]] and [[anxiolytic]] effects&lt;ref&gt;Sher, K. J. &amp; Grekin, E. R. (2007). Alcohol and affect regulation. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation'' (pp. 560-580). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[beta blockers]] can affect sympathetic activation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Exercise====
[[Exercise]], an example of response modulation, can be used to downregulate the physiological and experiential effects of negative emotions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Regular physical activity has also been shown to reduce emotional distress and improve emotional control.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oaten|first=Megan|author2=Cheng, Ken|title=Longitudinal gains in self-regulation from regular physical exercise|journal=British Journal of Health Psychology|year=2006|volume=11|issue=4|pages=717–733|doi=10.1348/135910706X96481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sleep====
[[Sleep]] plays a role in emotion regulation, although stress and worry can also interfere with sleep. Studies have shown that sleep, specifically [[REM sleep]], down-regulates reactivity of the [[amygdala]], a brain structure known to be involved in the processing of emotions, in response to previous emotional experiences.&lt;ref name="walker"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Walker |first=Matthew P. |date=March 2009 |title=The Role of Sleep in Cognition and Emotion |url=http://walkerlab.berkeley.edu/reprints/Walker_NYAS_2009.pdf |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=1156 |pages=168–197 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04416.x |access-date=25 November 2015 |pmid=19338508}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the flip side, [[sleep deprivation]] is associated with greater emotional reactivity or overreaction to negative and stressful stimuli. This is a result of both increased amygdala activity and a disconnect between the amygdala and the [[prefrontal cortex]], which regulates the amygdala through inhibition, together resulting in an overactive emotional brain.&lt;ref name="walker"/&gt; Due to the subsequent lack of emotional control, sleep deprivation may be associated with depression, [[impulsivity]], and mood swings. Additionally, there is some evidence that sleep deprivation may reduce emotional reactivity to positive stimuli and events and impair [[emotion recognition]] in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beattie |first=Louise |last2=Kyle |first2=Simon D. |last3=Espie |first3=Colin A. |last4=Biello |first4=Stephany M. |date=December 2015 |title=Social interactions, emotion and sleep: A systematic review and research agenda |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079214001579 |journal=Sleep Medicine Reviews |volume=24 |pages=83–100 |doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2014.12.005 |access-date=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In psychotherapy==

Emotion-regulation strategies are taught, and emotion-regulation problems are treated, in a variety of approaches to [[counseling]] and [[psychotherapy]], including [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), [[dialectical behavior therapy]] (DBT), [[emotion-focused therapy]] (EFT), and [[mindfulness-based cognitive therapy]] (MBCT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Berking |first1=Matthias |authorlink1=Matthias Berking |last2=Wupperman |first2=Peggilee |last3=Reichardt |first3=Alexander |last4=Pejic |first4=Tanja |last5=Dippel |first5=Alexandra |last6=Znoj |first6=Hansjörg |date=November 2008 |title=Emotion-regulation skills as a treatment target in psychotherapy |journal=[[Behaviour Research and Therapy]] |volume=46 |issue=11 |pages=1230–1237 |doi=10.1016/j.brat.2008.08.005 |pmid=18835479}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Kring |editor1-first=Ann M. |editor2-last=Sloan |editor2-first=Denise M. |date=2010 |title=Emotion Regulation and Psychopathology: A Transdiagnostic Approach to Etiology and Treatment |location=New York |publisher=[[Guilford Press]] |isbn=9781606234501 |oclc=319318901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infancy===
Intrinsic emotion-regulation efforts during [[infancy]] are believed to be guided primarily by innate physiological response systems.&lt;ref&gt;Derryberr, D., &amp; Rothbart, M. K. (2001). Early temperament and emotional development. In A. F. Kalverboer &amp; A. Gramsbergen (Eds.), ''Handbook of Brain and Behavior in Human Development'' (pp. 967-988). Dordrecht, The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic.&lt;/ref&gt; These systems usually manifest as an approach towards and an avoidance of pleasant or unpleasant stimuli. At three months, infants can engage in self-soothing behaviors like sucking and can reflexively respond to and signal feelings of distress.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Rothbart, M., Ziaie, H., &amp; O'Boyle, C. (1992). Self-regulation and emotion in infancy. In N. Eisenberg, &amp; R. Fabes (Eds.), ''Emotion and Its Regulation in Early Development'' (pp. 7-23). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass/Pfeiffer.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, infants have been observed attempting to suppress anger or sadness by knitting their brow or compressing their lips.&lt;ref name="Malatesta et. al."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malatesta|first=C.Z.|author2=Grigoryev, P. |author3=Lamb, C. |author4=Albin, M. |author5=Culver, C. |title=Emotional socialization and expressive development in preterm and full-term infants|journal=Child Development|year=1986|volume=57|pages=316–330|doi=10.2307/1130587|pmid=3956316|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between three and six months, basic [[Motor skills|motor functioning]] and attentional mechanisms begin to play a role in emotion regulation, allowing infants to more effectively approach or avoid emotionally relevant situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kochanska | first1 = G. | last2 = Coy | first2 = K.

Extrinsic emotion-regulation efforts by caregivers, including situation selection, modification, and distraction, are particularly important for infants.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Calkins, S. D., &amp; Hill, A. (2007). Caregiver influence on emerging emotion regulation: Biological and environmental transactions in early development. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation'' (pp. 229-248). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The emotion regulation strategies employed by caregivers to attenuate distress or to upregulate positive affect in infants can impact the infants' emotional and behavioral development, teaching them particular strategies and methods of regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Sroufe, L. A. (1996). ''Emotional development: The organization of emotional life in the early years''. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The type of [[Attachment styles|attachment style]] between caregiver and infant can therefore play a meaningful role in the regulatory strategies infants may learn to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kochanska | first1 = G | year = 2001 | title = Emotional development in children with different attachment histories: The first three years | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 474–490 | doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent evidence supports the idea that maternal singing has a positive effect on affect regulation in infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trehub | first1 = S. E. | last2 = Ghazban | first2 = N. | last3 = Corbeil | first3 = M. | year = 2015 | title = Musical affect regulation in infancy | url = | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1337 | issue = 1| pages = 186–192 | doi=10.1111/nyas.12622 | pmid=25773634}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singing play-songs, such as "The Wheels on the Bus" or "She'll Be Comin' Round the Mountain" have a visible affect-regulatory consequence of prolonged positive affect and even alleviation of distress. In addition to proven facilitation of social bonding, when combined with movement and/or rhythmic touch, maternal singing for affect regulation has possible applications for infants in the NICU and for adult caregivers with serious personality or adjustment difficulties.

===Toddler-hood===
By the end of the first year, [[toddler]]s begin to adopt new strategies to decrease negative arousal. These strategies can include rocking themselves, chewing on objects, or moving away from things that upset them.&lt;ref name="Kopp"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kopp|first=C.B.|title=Regulation of distress and negative emotions|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1989|volume=25|pages=343–354|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.25.3.343|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; At two years, toddlers become more capable of actively employing emotion regulation strategies.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; They can apply certain emotion regulation tactics to influence various emotional states.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Additionally, maturation of brain functioning and language and motor skills permits toddlers to manage their emotional responses and levels of arousal more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Rueda, M. R., Posner, M. I., &amp; Rothbart, M. K. (2004). Attentional control and self-regulation. In R. F. Baumeister &amp; K. D. Vohs (Eds.),'' Handbook of self-regulation: Research, theory, and applications ''(pp. 283-300). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Extrinsic emotion regulation remains important to emotional development in toddlerhood. Toddlers can learn ways from their caregivers to control their emotions and behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kopp | first1 = C. | year = 1989 | title = Regulation of distress and negative emotions: A developmental view | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 243–254 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.25.3.343}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, caregivers help teach self-regulation methods by distracting children from unpleasant events (like a [[vaccination]] shot) or helping them understand frightening events.&lt;ref name="Thompson, 1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=R.A.|title=Emotional regulation: A theme in search of definition|journal=Monographs of Society for Research in Child Development|year=1994|volume=59|pages=2–3|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5834.1994.tb01276.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childhood===
Emotion-regulation knowledge becomes more substantial during childhood. For example, children aged six to ten begin to understand [[display rules]]. They come to appreciate the contexts in which certain emotional expressions are socially most appropriate and therefore ought to be regulated. For example, children may understand that upon receiving a gift they should display a smile, irrespective of their actual feelings about the gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = P. L. | year = 1983 | title = Children's understanding of the link between situation and emotion | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Child Psychology | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 1–20 | doi=10.1016/0022-0965(83)90048-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; During childhood, there is also a trend towards the use of more cognitive emotion regulation strategies, taking the place of more basic distraction, approach, and avoidance tactics.&lt;ref&gt;Stegge, H. &amp; Terwog, M. M. (2007). Awareness and regulation of emotion in typical and atypical development. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation'' (pp. 269-286). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the development of emotion dysregulation in children, one robust finding suggests that children who are frequently exposed to negative emotion at home will be more likely to display, and have difficulties regulating, high levels of negative emotion.&lt;ref name="Caspi et. al, 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caspi|first=A.|author2=Moffitt, T.E. |author3=Morgan, J. |author4=Rutter, M. |author5=Taylor, A. |author6=Arseneault, L. |author7=Tully, L. |author8=Jacobs, C. |author9=Kim-Cohen, J. |author10=Polo-Tomas, M. |title=Maternal expressed emotion predicts children's antisocial behaviour problems: Using monozygotic-twin differences to identify environmental effects on behavioural development|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=2004|volume=40|pages=149–161|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.40.2.149|pmid=14979757|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisenberg, Zhou &amp; Koller, 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eisenberg|first=N.|author2=Zhou, Q. |author3=Koller, S. |title=Brazilian adolescents' prosocial moral judgement and behaviour: Relations to sympathy, perspective-taking, gender-role orientation, and demographic characteristics|journal=Child Development|year=2001|volume=72|pages=518–534|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00294|pmid=11333082|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maughan &amp; Cicchetti"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maughan|first=A.|author2=Cicchetti, D.|title=Impact of child maltreatment and interadult violence on children's emotional regulation abilities and socioemotional adjustements|journal=Child Development|year=2002|volume=73|pages=1525–1542|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00488|pmid=12361317|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Valiente, Eisenberg &amp; Spinrad, 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Valiente|first=C.|author2=Fabes, R.A. |author3=Eisenberg, N. |author4=Spinrad, T.L. |title=The relations of parental expressivity and support to children's coping with daily stress|journal=Journal of Family Psychology|year=2004|volume=18|pages=97–106|doi=10.1037/0893-3200.18.1.97|pmid=14992613|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adolescence===
[[Adolescence|Adolescents]] show a marked increase in their capacities to regulate their emotions, and emotion-regulation decision making becomes more complex, depending on multiple factors. In particular, the significance of interpersonal outcomes increases for adolescents. When regulating their emotions, adolescents are therefore likely to take into account their social context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zeman | first1 = J. | last2 = Cassano | first2 = M. | last3 = Perry-Parrish | first3 = C. | last4 = Stegall | first4 = S. | year = 2006 | title = Emotion regulation in children and adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 155–168 | doi=10.1097/00004703-200604000-00014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, adolescents show a tendency to display more emotion if they expect a sympathetic response from their peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zeman | first1 = J. | last2 = Garber | first2 = J. | year = 1996 | title = Display rules for anger, sadness, and pain: it depends on who is watching | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 67 | issue = | pages = 957–973 | doi=10.2307/1131873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, spontaneous use of cognitive emotion-regulation strategies increases during adolescence, which is evidenced both by self-report data&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garnefski | first1 = N. | last2 = Kraaij | first2 = V. | year = 2006 | title = Relationships between cognitive emotion regulation strategies and depressive symptoms: A comparative study of five specific samples | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 1659–1669 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2005.12.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and neural markers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Luna | first1 = B. | last2 = Padmanabhan | first2 = A. | last3 = O'Hearn | first3 = K. | year = 2010 | title = What has fMRI told us about the development of cognitive control through adolescence? | url = | journal = Brain and Cognition | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 101–113 | doi = 10.1016/j.bandc.2009.08.005 | pmc = 2815087 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adulthood===
Social losses increase and health tends to decrease as people age. As people get older their motivation to seek emotional meaning in life through social ties tends to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carstensen | first1 = L. A.

==Overview of perspectives==

===Neuropsychological perspective===

====Affective====
As people age, their [[affect (psychology)|affect]]{{spaced ndash}}the way they react to emotions{{spaced ndash}}changes, either positively or negatively. Studies show that positive affect increases as a person grows from adolescence to their mid 70s. Negative affect, on the other hand, decreases until the mid 70s. Studies also show that emotions differ in adulthood, particularly affect (positive or negative). Although some studies found that affect decreases{{Clarify|reason=Becomes less positive / more negative or rather becomes less extreme, i.e., less positive or less negative as applicable?|date=February 2017}} with age, some have concluded that adults in their middle age experience more positive affect and less negative affect than younger adults. Positive affect was also higher for men than women while the negative affect was higher for women than it was for men and also for single people. A reason that older people{{spaced ndash}}middle adulthood{{spaced ndash}}might have less negative affect is because they have overcome, "the trials and vicissitudes of youth, they may increasingly experience a more pleasant balance of affect, at least up until their mid-70s". Positive affect might rise during middle age but towards the later years of life{{spaced ndash}}the 70s{{spaced ndash}}it begins to decline while negative affect also does the same. This might be due to failing health, reaching the end of their lives and the death of friends and relatives.&lt;ref name="Labouvie"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Labouvie-Vief|first=Gisela|title=Dynamic Integration:Affect, Cognition and the Self in Adulthood|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=December 2003|volume=12|issue=6|pages=201–206|doi=10.1046/j.0963-7214.2003.01262.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to [[Reference range|baseline]] levels of positive and negative affect, studies have found individual differences in the time-course of emotional responses to [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]]. The [[Time|temporal]] dynamics of emotional regulation, also known as affective [[chronometry]], include two key variables in the emotional response process: rise time to peak emotional response, and recovery time to baseline levels of emotion.&lt;ref name="Davidson, R. J. 1998 pp. 307-330"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Davidson, R. J. |title= Affective Style and Affective Disorders: Perspectives from Affective Neuroscience|journal= Cognition and Emotion|volume= 12|year=1998|pages=307–330|doi=10.1080/026999398379628|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of affective chronometry typically separate positive and negative affect into distinct categories, as previous research has shown (despite some correlation) the ability of humans to experience changes in these categories independently of one another.&lt;ref&gt;Ruef, Anna Marie; Levenson, Robert W. Coan, James A. (Ed); Allen, John J. B. (Ed) "Continuous measurement of emotion: The affect rating dial" (2007). Handbook of emotion elicitation and assessment. Series in affective science., New York, NY, US: Oxford University Press, pp. 287–297.&lt;/ref&gt; Affective chronometry research has been conducted on clinical populations with [[anxiety]], [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], and [[personality disorders]], but is also utilized as a measurement to test the effectiveness of different therapeutic techniques (including [[Mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] training) on [[emotional dysregulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Geschwind N.|pmid=21767001|year=2011|last2=Peeters|first2=F|last3=Drukker|first3=M|last4=Van Os|first4=J|last5=Wichers|first5=M|title=Mindfulness training increases momentary positive emotions and reward experience in adults vulnerable to depression: A randomized controlled trial|volume=79|issue=5|pages=618–28|doi=10.1037/a0024595|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neurological====
The development of functional [[magnetic resonance imaging|magnetic resonance]] imaging has allowed for the study of emotion regulation on a biological level. Specifically, research over the last decade strongly suggests that there is a neural basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frank | first1 = DW | last2 = Dewitt | first2 = M | last3 = Hudgens-Haney | first3 = ME | last4 = Schaeffer | first4 = DJ | last5 = Ball | first5 = BH | last6 = Schwarz | first6 = NF | last7 = Hussein | first7 = AA | last8 = Smart | first8 = LM | last9 = Sabatinelli | first9 = D | year = 2014 | title = Emotion regulation: Quantitative meta-analysis of functional activation and deactivation | url = | journal = Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 202–211 | doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.06.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sufficient evidence has correlated emotion regulation to particular patterns of prefrontal activation. These regions include the [[orbit (anatomy)|orbit]]al prefrontal cortex, the ventromedial [[prefrontal cortex]], and the [[dorsolateral]] prefrontal cortex. Two additional brain structures that have been found to contribute are the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex. Each of these structures are involved in various facets of emotion regulation and irregularities in one or more regions and/or interconnections among them are affiliated with failures of emotion regulation. An implication to these findings is that individual differences in prefrontal activation predict the ability to perform various tasks in aspects of emotion regulation.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davidson | first1 = R.J. | last2 = Putnam | first2 = K.M. | last3 = Larson | first3 = C.L. | year = 2000 | title = Dysfunction in the neural circuitry of emotion regulation: A possible prelude to violence | url = | journal = Science | volume = 289 | issue = | pages = 591–594 | doi=10.1126/science.289.5479.591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociological===
People intuitively mimic [[facial expressions]]; it is a fundamental part of healthy functioning. Similarities across cultures in regards to [[nonverbal communication]] has prompted the debate that it is in fact a [[universal language]].&lt;ref name="Elfenbein, H. A. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elfenbein | first1 = H. A. | last2 = Ambady | first2 = N. | year = 2002 | title = On the universality and cultural specificity of emotion recognition: a meta-analysis | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 128 | issue = 2| pages = 203–235 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.128.2.203 | pmid=11931516}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be argued that emotional regulation plays a key role in the ability to emit the correct responses in social situations. Humans have control over facial expressions both [[conscious mind|consciously]] and [[unconscious mind|unconsciously]]: an intrinsic emotion program is generated as the result of a transaction with the world, which immediately results in an emotional response and usually a facial reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ekman | first1 = P. | last2 = Friesen | first2 = W. V. | last3 = Ancoli | first3 = S. | year = 1980 | title = Facial signs of emotional experience | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 39 | issue = | pages = 1125–1134 | doi=10.1037/h0077722}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a well documented [[phenomenon]] that emotions have an effect on facial expression, but recent research has provided evidence that the opposite may also be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Izard | first1 = C. E. | year = 1990 | title = Facial expressions and the regulation of emotions | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 58 | issue = 3| pages = 487–498 | pmid = 2182826 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.58.3.487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This notion would give rise to the belief that a person may not only control his emotion but in fact influence them as well. Emotional regulation focuses on providing the appropriate emotion in the appropriate circumstances. Some theories allude to the thought that each emotion serves a specific purpose in coordinating [[organism]]ic needs with [[Environmental psychology|environmental]] demands (cole 1994). This skill, although apparent throughout all nationalities,&lt;ref name="Elfenbein, H. A. 2002"/&gt; has been shown to vary in successful application at different age groups. In experiments done comparing younger and older adults to the same unpleasant stimuli, older adults were able to regulate their emotional reactions in a way that seemed to avoid negative confrontation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Charles | first1 = S. T. | last2 = Carstensen | first2 = L. L. | year = 2008 | title = Unpleasant situations elicit different emotional responses in younger and older adults | url = | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 495–504 | doi = 10.1037/a0013284 | pmc = 2677442 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings support the theory that with time people develop a better ability to regulate their emotions. This ability found in adults seems to better allow individuals to react in what would be considered a more appropriate manner in some social situations, permitting them to avoid adverse situations that could be seen as detrimental.

====Expressive regulation (in solitary conditions)====
In solitary conditions, emotional regulation can include a minimization-miniaturization effect, in which common outward expressive patterns are replaced with toned down versions of expression. Unlike other situations, in which physical expression (and its regulation) serve a social purpose (i.e. conforming to [[display rules]] or revealing emotion to outsiders), solitary conditions require no reason for emotions to be outwardly expressed (although intense levels of emotion can bring out noticeable expression anyway). The idea behind this is that as people get older, they learn that the purpose of outward expression (to appeal to other people), is not necessary in situations in which there is no one to appeal to.&lt;ref name="Holodynski"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holodynski|first=Manfred|title=The Miniaturization of Expression in the Development of Emotional Self-Regulation|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=2004|volume=40|issue=1|pages=16–28|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.40.1.16|pmid=14700461}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the level of emotional expression can be lower in these solitary situations.

===Stress===
According to Yu. V. Scherbatykh, emotional stress in situations like school examinations can be reduced by engaging in self-regulating activities prior to the task being performed. To study the influence of [[Self-control|self-regulation]] on mental and [[physiological]] processes under exam stress, Shcerbatykh conducted a test with an experimental group of 28 students (of both sexes) and a control group of 102 students (also of both sexes).&lt;ref name=Scherbatykh&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shcherbatykh|first=Yu. V.|title=Self-Regulation of Autonomic Homeostasis in Emotional Stress|journal=Human Physiology|year=2000|volume=26|issue=5|pages=641–642|url=http://www.no-stress.ru/stress/stress_science/emotional_stress_regulation.html|doi=10.1007/BF02760382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the moments before the examination, [[situational]] stress levels were raised in both groups from what they were in quiet states. In the experimental group, participants engaged in three self-regulating techniques (concentration on respiration, general body relaxation, and the creation of a mental image of successfully passing the examination). During the examination, the anxiety levels of the experimental group were lower than that of the control group. Also, the percent of unsatisfactory marks in the experimental group was 1.7 times less than in the control group. From this data, Scherbatykh concluded that the application of self-regulating actions before examinations helps to significantly reduce levels of emotional strain, which can help lead to better performance results.&lt;ref name=Scherbatykh /&gt;

===Decision making===
Identification of our emotional self-regulating process can facilitate in the decision making process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Miclea, M. |author2=Miu, A. |pmid=20364902|title=Emotion Regulation and Decision Making Under Risk and Uncertainty|year=2010|volume=10|issue=2|pages=257–65|doi=10.1037/a0018489|journal=Emotion (Washington, D.C.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current literature on emotion regulation identifies that humans characteristically make efforts in controlling emotion experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gross, J. J.|pmid=12212647|url=http://sprweb.org/articles/Gross02.pdf|year=2002|title=Emotion regulation: Affective, cognitive, and social consequences|volume=39|issue=3|pages=281–91|journal=Psychophysiology|doi=10.1017/s0048577201393198}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is then a possibility that our present state emotions can be altered by emotional regulation strategies resulting in the possibility that different regulation strategies could have different decision implications.

==Effects of low self regulation==
With a failure in emotional regulation there is a rise in [[psychosocial]] and emotional dysfunctions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bandura, A. |author2=Caprara, G. V. |author3=Barbaranelli, C. |author4=Gerbino, M. |author5=Pastorelli, C. |title=Role of Affective Self-Regulatory Efficacy in Diverse Spheres of Psychosocial Functioning|pmid=12795389 |jstor=3696228|year=2003|volume=74|issue=3|pages=769–82|journal=Child Development|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00567}}&lt;/ref&gt; caused by traumatic experiences due to an inability to regulate emotions. These traumatic experiences typically happen in grade school and are sometimes associated with [[bullying]]. Children who can't properly self-regulate express their volatile emotions in a variety of ways, including screaming if they don't have their way, lashing out with their fists, or bullying other children. Such behaviors often elicit negative reactions from the social environment, which, in turn, can exacerbate or maintain the original regulation problems over time, a process termed cumulative continuity. These children are more likely to have conflict-based relationships with their teachers and other children. This can lead to more severe problems such as an impaired ability to adjust to school and predicts school dropout many years later. Children who fail to properly self-regulate grow as teenagers with more emerging problems. Their peers begin to notice this "immaturity", and these children are often excluded from social groups and teased and harassed by their peers. This "immaturity" certainly causes some teenagers to become social outcasts in their respective social groups, causing them to lash out in angry and potentially violent ways. Being teased or being an outcast during the teenage years is especially damaging and could lead to a dysfunctional future,{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} which is why it is recommended to foster emotional self-regulation in children as early as possible.

[[Image:Spaniel Field Trial.jpg|thumb|A [[spaniel]] field trial]]

A '''field trial''' is a competitive event at which [[hunting dog]]s compete against one another. There are field trials for retrievers, pointing dogs and flushing dogs. Field trials are usually organized by [[kennel club]]s or other [[gun dog]] organizations.  Field trials are generally considered more competitive than [[hunt test]]s in that success at a field trial requires a higher level of training than success at a hunt test requires. For example, in Retriever Field Trials, dogs retrieve over longer distances with a more complex path than a Retriever Hunt Test would generally provide. Field trial dogs must be finished in their training in order to enter. Their purpose is also different, as they exist mainly for breeders, while hunting tests are made for hunters.

The term is confusing as it means different things to different breed organizations.  Spaniel field trials demand that dogs compete against one another, whereas retriever field trials are more similar to [[hunt test]]s among other breeds.  In most hunt tests, on the other hand, dogs are evaluated against a written standard and all of the dogs in the hunt test may qualify if they meet the standard.  To further complicate the issue, various kennel organizations have differing definitions of field trial.

Field trials come in various grades including Open, Amateur, Sanctioned and non-sanctioned.  An Open field trial permits entry from any handler or trainer while an Amateur trial only permits non-professional handlers/trainers.  Sanctioned trials are ones that are held under the control of a national kennel club or organization, while the non-sanctioned can be organized by a local club.

==Field Trials in the UK and Ireland==

A field trial that is held under the auspices of [[the Kennel Club]], the UK's governing body in respect of working gundogs, can be described as a competition to assess the work of gundogs in the field.  By definition this means that all field trials are held on live, unhandled game that is shot for the purpose of that field trial.  Game that has been handled in any way, whether it be live or dead game, may not be used for testing dogs in any part of a field trial.  The only exception to this rule is where dead game may be used in the conduct of a water test at a field trial.   The reason this exception exists it to acknowledge the fact that game will not necessarily be shot over water, although for dogs to qualify for titles in field trials will be required to demonstrate their ability to retrieve from water.

Gundog clubs and societies that are registered with the Kennel Club and which have been authorized to organize and run field trials may do so, provided that a license is issued to that club or society for every field trial.   Field trials not licensed by the Kennel Club are liable to be deemed as unrecognized canine events.

In the US, retriever field trials are held under the auspices of the American Kennel club.

===Stakes===
Field trials can  consist of one or more stakes, which can be considered as separate competitions within a field trial.  Such stakes can be run for any of the four sub-groups of gundogs recognized by the Kennel Club.  The four sub-groups are;

#[[Retriever]]s and [[Irish Water Spaniel]]s
#Sporting [[Spaniel]]s other than [[Irish Water Spaniel]]s
#[[Pointer (dog)|Pointers]] and [[Setter]]s
#Breeds that Hunt, Point and Retrieve

====Open Stake====
This is a stake in which the dogs have the opportunity of gaining a qualification towards the title of Field Trial Champion (FTCh in the UK and Ireland, FC in the US) and towards entry in the Championships or Champion Stake for its breed.

====All Age Stake====
This is open to all dogs of a specified breed or breeds without restriction as to the age of the dog, but which may be restricted by other conditions that are deemed necessary by the organizing club or society.  Four placements plus a Reserve JAM and JAMs (Judges Award of Merit).

====Novice Stake====
This stake is confined to dogs that not have gained the following awards:

*Retrievers;  First, second, third or fourth award in a 24 dog Open Stake; or first, second or third award in a 12 dog Open Stake; or first award in an All Aged or Novice Stake
*Spaniels;  First, second or third in Open Stakes; or first in an All Age or Novice Stake
*Mixed Breed; First

====Qualifying Stake (US)====
In the U.S., this stake is for dogs that have not yet placed first or second in a Qualifying stake nor completed an Open or Amateur stake.

====Puppy Stake====
Confined to dogs whelped not earlier than 1 January in the year preceding the date of the field trial.  If a Puppy Stake is run in January then a dog that was a puppy in the previous year is deemed to still be a puppy.

====Derby Stake (US)====
In the U.S., this stake is for dogs at 6 months of age and no more than 2 years of age.

===Judges===
The judges at field trials are appointed by the Field Trial Secretary of the organising club or society, after having been instructed to do so by the committee of the club or society.  It is considered an honour to be asked to judge at a field trial and the highest standard of judging is expected from appointed judges.  The club or society running the trial must satisfy itself that the persons being invited to judge at a trial have practical experience of both field trials and sporting shooting.  Judges may not shoot at a stake at which they are judging nor may they enter a dog for competition at that trial (except for retriever stakes where someone else may handle their dog in a stake other than the one the owner has been asked to judge).

Judges are classified as either A or B "Panel Judges and Non-panel (NP). However, an A Panel Judge must be present at all field trials. Judges are appointed to panels after recommendation from a Field Trial Secretary of a club or society which is approved to hold Open Stakes for the appropriate sub-group of gundogs for which he or she has judged within the past three years.  The opinion of all previous A Panel judges with whom he or she has judged field trials over the previous  three years will be sought by the Kennel Club's Field Trial Sub-Committee.  The experience of the perspective Panel Judge over the last number of years is taken into account but this must include having judged at trials for at least two different clubs or societies and with at least five different A Panel co-judges.

In addition, judges appointed to the B Panel must have a minimum of three years judging experience and six stakes, with at least five A Panel Judges.  For appointment to the A Panel, judges must have served at least three years as a B Panel Judge, judging at a minimum of six stakes of which three must have been Open Stakes and with at least five different A Panel Judges.

In the U.S. the American Kennel Club requires a minimum total of 8 points between the two judges for each stake.  Judges for major stakes (Open, Amateur) must have at least 8 combined major judging points and judges of minor stakes (Derby, Qualifying) must have at least 8 combined points of any type.

===Awards &amp; prizes===
It is the judges at field trials who decide whether or not awards are to be made.  In tests where the dog and handler team are judged against a standard, in some instances it has been adjudged that none of the dogs reached the required standard and awards have been withheld.  This is, however, an unusual occurrence.  It is more common for awards to be limited to one or two places than not to be awarded.

An award is any placing in a stake decided by the judges which may be first, second, third or fourth position.  The following can also be conferred at the discretion of judges:

*At a Championship Stake
:Diploma of Merit
*In Other Stakes
:Certificates of Merit

===Regulations for retriever &amp; spaniel breeds===
[[Image:American water spaniel 02.jpg|thumb|An [[American Water Spaniel]] retrieving]]
Dogs competing in retriever or spaniel field trials must not wear a collar of any kind when under the order of the judges.   Leads can be used when dogs are not under the order of the judges, but these must be removed prior to the dogs entering the competition line.  Any dog that, in the opinion of the judges, does not reach the required standard for the breed will not receive an award.  Judges will eliminate dogs from the trial if they have committed an "eliminating fault."  Where the judges eliminate a dog for hard mouth, the handler must be given the opportunity of examining the game in the presence of the judges.  Their decision, however, is final and binding.

In general, all dogs must be steady to the shot and the fall of game and should have the ability to retrieve on command.   Handlers at field trials must not send their dog on a retrieve until they have been instructed to do so by a judge.  Because all field trials in the UK are conducted in live shooting environments, judges will have instructed their guns not to shoot directly over a dog when it is already out working on a retrieve.  All wounded game is gathered and dispatched at the earliest possible opportunity and is normally retrieved before dead game.  It is possible that game cannot be gathered by the dogs in competition and in such cases the judges would assign this task to picker-up appointed for this purpose.

As good marking is essential in a retrieving breed to avoid the disturbance of game in the vicinity, judges will give full credit to a dog that goes directly to the fall of the game and gets on with the job of locating and retrieving.  A clean pick up is preferred but judges will normally not penalize too heavily dogs that set game down to get a better grip.  They will, of course, make a distinction between this and dogs that are guilty of sloppy retrieving or that deliver short of the handler.

Whilst dogs are required to be obedient and respond to its handler's signals, good game finding dogs will be scored higher than those dogs that need handled to the game.  Usually the better dogs require less handling, appear to have an instinctive knowledge of direction and make a difficult find look simple.   In the UK, Judges will call up dogs that are performing indifferently on a runner and another dog will be tried on it.  The work of subsequent dogs on the runner will be assessed in the order in which they are tried.  Missed game that is picked by the second or subsequent dog constitutes an "eye wipe."    All "eye wipes" will be treated on their merits but dogs that have had their "eye wiped" during the body of the stake will be discarded by the judges.  Where a dog shows ability by acknowledging the fall of game and making a workmanlike job of the line to the fall, it should not be barred from the awards by failing to retrieve the game if that game is not collected by another dog, tried by the judges on the same game.

All retrieved game is examined by the judges for signs of "hard mouth."  Because hard mouthed dogs seldom give a visible sign of hardness by damaging the skin of game, the retrieved game should be placed in the palm of the hand, breast upwards and head forwards.  Judges will examine the rib cage of the game, looking for any signs of the ribs being crushed by running the index finger and thumb along each side of the rib cage.  If a judges suspects hard mouth, he or she would normally consult with their co-judge who will also examine the game.  Where judges are in agreement that the damage has been caused by the dog crushing and not by the fall or the shot, the handler will be given the opportunity of inspecting the game in the presence of the judges.  The decision of the judges is final and the dog will be eliminated from the trial.

In the United States, results of retriever field trials are published in a monthly magazine called Retriever News and in a website (www.retrieverresults.com).


==American Field Sanctioned Field Trials for Pointing Dogs==

Definitions of field trials differ based on the organizations around the world that sanction them. The above definition for trials in Great Britain, for example, is quite different from American Field sanctioned field trials for Pointers, English and Red Setters, German Shorthaired Pointers, Vizsla and Brittanys in the United States, Canada and Japan. The American Kennel Club also holds field trials with a different standard for awarding titles.

===Pointing Dog Field Trials===  

Field trials are competitions for a class of sporting dogs called pointing dogs that have been selectively bred for well over a hundred and fifty years specifically to search for and point upland game birds for hunters. Dogs detect the scent cone in the air given off by birds; they do not track foot scent. Field trials, first conducted in England in 1865 have been used to greatly aid with the selective breeding of dogs with desired characteristics thereby improving the various breeds of pointing dogs both for competition and for upland bird hunters to enjoy. On October 8, 1874 near Memphis TN, a solid black setter named “Knight” won the first ever field trial held in the United States. In 1900 the American Field published the first Field Dog Stud Book (FDSB), establishing the oldest purebred dog registry for sporting dogs. 

Dogs are entered in field trial stakes for puppies, derbies, and adult dogs in Walking and Horseback Shooting Dog and All-Age categories. Dogs are drawn to run in braces but compete against all dogs entered in the stake. Handlers show their dogs to best advantage to two judges, each assigned to cover a dog and handler, switching in the middle of the stake so each judge has the opportunity to witness both dogs in the brace. Braces are generally from 20 minutes for puppies to 30 - 60 minutes for derbies and adult dogs. Championships are one hour or more and sometimes require a second series for dogs selected as the best from the first series to compete again. People are invited to judge based on their experience training and competing with their own dogs as well as their experience upland bird hunting. Dogs are judged on their genetic characteristics and their training. Each dog is judged on their ground effort (race) demonstrating their ability to intelligently search, using the wind to their advantage, and accurately locate and point game birds. Dogs must handle, always to the front, moving efficiently and attractively with high tail and head carriage, displaying confidence and boldness, wasting no time hunting unlikely cover. As derbies, they should show their potential to become finished, polished dogs. As adults, they must display perfect manners on birds being broke steady to wing and shot and honoring their bracemates’ points. Whether Shooting Dog or All-Age contender, a field trial dog’s performance both running and pointing, should always display “class” and excite the judges and gallery attendants.   

A field trial is hosted by a field trial club and run to a set of Minimum Requirements established by the American Field in order for the dog’s win to become part of their permanent record. American Field sanctioned trials — whether a day or two of various stakes or championships — are observed by a reporter invited by the host club. Along with the registered names, registration numbers, handlers and owners of the winning dogs, field trial reports are published in the American Field’s weekly publication so field trialers across the country have an opportunity to read about the dogs’ performances if they were unable to attend and watch the trial. Reports record the history of the sport. 

The American Field’s weekly newspaper also announces field trials (open and amateur) in the USA, Canada and Japan. Dogs must qualify by winning field trial placements in order to compete in championships and be awarded Championship and Runner-Up Championship titles. There are primarily horseback Shooting Dog and All-Age stakes, Walking stakes (including grouse and woodcock trials, referred to as 'grouse' or 'cover dog' trials) held throughout the US and many Canadian provinces on various species of upland game birds. In many parts of the country, trials are now held on released or liberated game because wild birds no longer exist in those areas or because there are no available wild-bird grounds suitable or attainable to run field trials on. Enormous efforts by conservation groups supported by field trialers have been made to reverse this situation by land management efforts to restore the natural habitat for wild upland game birds.

The Amateur Field Trial Clubs of America (AFTCA) was established in 1917 specifically for amateur handlers to compete against one another.

===The Amateur Field Trial Clubs of America (AFTCA) Guidelines to Field Trial Procedure and Judicial Practice Definitions===

===All-Age Stake===

"The familiar, capsule description of the all-age dog, attributed to old-time trainer Jim Advent, declares that he (or she) is a dedicated hunter of upland game birds which 'runs off — but not quite'. The all-age dog is a free spirit and fills up all the available country (plus a little) in a bold and sometimes reckless manner, yet ultimately acknowledges the control exerted by his handler and course to the front in such a pattern as to maintain periodic, suitable contact with the handler. The real intelligent and accomplished all-age dog exhibits the knack of "showing" at strategic, distant, forward points on the course during the progress of his heat. He may frequently pass from view, only to show again after a lapse of time, or to be discovered by handler or scout pointing game.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

All-Age Standard reads as follows:
In any given All-Age Stake, it may be very difficult to place a dog which totally meets the exalted standard; therefore, out of necessity, there will frequently be a need to accept a dog whose qualities and character can only begin to approximate the standard. The standard, when applied, should examine the total performance of the dog with range being kept foremost in mind. Range is the “sine qua non” of an all-age dog and it should take precedence over and not be compromised for a short, practical, methodical, uninspiring performance, no matter how immaculate the bird work of the latter.

=== Shooting Dog Stake ===

“A Shooting Dog Stake is held for the purpose of promoting the ideal shooting dog, one that will find and handle correctly all game birds on the designated course.
“The superior shooting dog is one that excites constant admiration for the quality of the performance and does nothing to displease or annoy. Without giving his handler any unnecessary effort, he will, in an artistic and polished manner, give him the most quality bird finds that are to be had on the ground covered.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

'''Shooting Dog Standard reads as follows:'''
In any given Shooting Dog Stake, it may be very difficult to place a dog which totally meets the exalted standard. Therefore, out of necessity, there will frequently be a need to accept a dog whose qualities and character can only begin to approximate this standard. The standard when applied should seek out a dog which displays superior bird dog characteristics in the form of natural qualities such as pace, range, bird sense, nose, stamina and style. The contender sought after should render a balanced, biddable performance, search intelligently and exhibit bird finding ability with quality always superseding quantity, manifest accuracy of location, loftiness and intensity on point. Subservience to the handler and proper handling response without the benefit of scouting and excessive handling are the “sine qua non” of a shooting dog. Excessive range on the part of a shooting dog is not considered desirable. When considering bird work, the judges should be swayed not by the frequency of occurrence but rather the quality of the performance.

Exact definitions of field trial dogs and stakes and their interpretation have differed, no doubt, from the beginning of field trial history. There is much subjectivity based on individual understanding, experience and preference brought to the judicial saddle. One aspect of field trials generally agreed upon is the necessity of good, experienced judges of great integrity.

=== Field Trial Judge Attributes  ===

1. They should be of strong moral character and integrity, and respected for these qualities in their hometown, business, and field trial community.

2. They should be in good physical condition with the stamina to ride (or walk where horses cannot be used) for days on end and see all the entries in the stake through to their proper conclusion, and possess keen eyesight to see all the action as it transpires.

3. They should be of even temperament, blessed with common sense, possess an alert, analytically decisive mind, and have sufficient conviction in their abilities to stand up for their decisions.

4. They should be a good horseman (or women) and have full knowledge of the outdoors and an understanding of the behavior of game birds and dogs, and have background of practical bird-hunting experience.

5. They should be familiar with the proper procedure of training and breaking bird dogs and must have successfully run dogs in field trials, and should have “broke” dogs of their own.

6. They should have a thorough knowledge and understanding of the AFTCA's Guidelines to Field Trial Procedure and Judicial Practice.

7. They should have experience running All-Age and/or Shooting Dogs to understand the difference between these types of performances and their different standards. This knowledge should be applied when decisions are rendered.

&lt;ref&gt;Guidelines to Field Trial Procedure and Judicial Practice, Amateur Field trial Clubs of America, Inc., March 7, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

A dog’s field trial wins are recorded with the FDSB (Field Dog Stud Book) and are a permanent part of their record shown on their pedigree. Field trials have always been and continue to be a critical tool for the continued successful breeding of superior bird dogs from which the upland game hunter has benefited.

'''GENCODE''' is a scientific project in [[genome research]] and part of the [[ENCODE]] (ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements) scale-up project.

The GENCODE consortium was initially formed as part of the pilot phase of the ENCODE project to identify and map all protein-coding genes within the ENCODE regions (approx. 1% of Human genome).&lt;ref name="Harrow2006"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Harrow J, Denoeud F, Frankish A, Reymond A, Chen CK, Chrast J | title=GENCODE: producing a reference annotation for ENCODE. | journal=Genome Biol | year= 2006 | volume= 7 Suppl 1 | issue=  | pages= S4.1–9 | pmid=16925838 | doi=10.1186/gb-2006-7-s1-s4 | pmc=1810553 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the initial success of the project, GENCODE now aims to build an “Encyclopedia of genes and genes variants” by identifying all gene features in the human and mouse genome using a combination of computational analysis, manual annotation, and experimental validation, and annotating all evidence-based gene features in the entire human genome at a high accuracy.&lt;ref name="Harrow2012"/&gt;

== Current progress ==

GENCODE is currently progressing towards its goals in Phase 2 of the project, which are:
* To continue improving the coverage and accuracy of the GENCODE human gene set by enhancing and extending the annotation of all evidence-based gene features in the human genome at a high accuracy, including protein-coding loci with alternatively splices variants, non-coding loci and pseudogenes.&lt;ref name="GENCODEp2goals"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gencodegenes.org/gencode_goals.html |title= GENCODE – Goals |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=c. 2013 |website=GENCODE |publisher=Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. |accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To create a mouse GENCODE gene set that includes protein-coding regions with associated alternative splice variants, non-coding loci which have transcript evidence, and pseudogenes.&lt;ref name="GENCODEp2goals" /&gt;
The most recent release of the Human geneset annotations is Gencode 20, with a freeze date of April 2014. This release utilises the latest GRCh38 human [[reference genome]] assembly, and corresponds to [[Ensembl]] release 76.&lt;ref name="GENCODEdata"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gencodegenes.org/data.html |title=GENCODE – Data | author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=August 2013 |website=GENCODE |publisher=Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. |accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The latest release for the mouse geneset annotations is Gencode M3, also with a freeze date of April 2014.&lt;ref name="GENCODEdata" /&gt;

Since September 2009, GENCODE has been the human gene set used by the Ensembl project and each new GENCODE release corresponds to an Ensembl release.

== History ==

[[File:GENCODE timeline.png|thumb|right|320px|Timeline of the GENCODE project]]

'''2003 September'''&lt;br /&gt;
The [[National Human Genome Research Institute]] (NHGRI) launched a public research consortium named ENCODE, the Encyclopedia Of DNA Elements, in September 2003, to carry out a project to identify all functional elements in the human genome sequence. The project was designed with three phases - Pilot, Technology development and Production phase.&lt;ref name="ENCODE2004"&gt;{{cite journal | author = The ENCODE Project Consortium | title = The ENCODE (ENCyclopedia of DNA Elements) Project | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume =  306| issue = 5696 | pages = 636–640|date= 22 October 2004|doi=10.1126/science.1105136 | pmid=15499007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The pilot stage of the ENCODE project aimed to investigate in great depth, computationally and experimentally, 44 regions totaling 30 Mb of sequence representing approximately 1% of the human genome. As part of this stage, the GENCODE consortium was formed to identify and map all protein-coding genes within the ENCODE regions.&lt;ref name="Harrow2006" /&gt; It was envisaged that the results of the first two phases will be used to determine the best path forward for analysing the remaining 99% of the human genome in a cost-effective and comprehensive production phase.&lt;ref name="ENCODE2004" /&gt;

'''2005 April'''&lt;br /&gt;
The first release of the annotation of the 44 ENCODE regions was frozen on 29 April 2005 and was used in the first ENCODE Genome Annotation Assessment Project (E-GASP) workshop.&lt;ref name="Harrow2006" /&gt; GENCODE Release 1 contained 416 known loci, 26 novel (coding DNA sequence) CDS loci, 82 novel transcript loci, 78 putative loci, 104 processed pseudogenes and 66 unprocessed pseudogenes.

'''2005 October'''&lt;br /&gt;
A second version (release 02) was frozen on 14 October 2005, containing updates following discoveries from experimental validations using [[Rapid amplification of cDNA ends|RACE]] and [[Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction|RT-PCR]] techniques.&lt;ref name="Harrow2006" /&gt; GENCODE Release 2 contained 411 known loci, 30 novel CDS loci, 81 novel transcript loci, 83 putative loci, 104 processed pseudogenes and 66 unprocessed pseudogenes.

'''2007 June'''&lt;br /&gt;
The conclusions from the pilot project were published in June 2007.&lt;ref name="NATURE2007"&gt;{{cite journal | author = The ENCODE Project Consortium | title = Identification and analysis of functional elements in 1% of the human genome by the ENCODE pilot project. |journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 447 | issue = 7146 | pages = 799–816|date= 14 June 2007|pmid=17571346|doi=10.1038/nature05874 | pmc=2212820}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings highlighted the success of the pilot project to create a feasible platform and new technologies to characterise functional elements in the human genome, which paves the way for opening research into genome-wide studies.

'''2007 October'''&lt;br /&gt;
After a successful pilot phase on 1% of the genome, the [[Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute]] was awarded a grant from the US National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to carry out a scale-up of the GENCODE project for integrated annotation of gene features.&lt;ref name="WTSIGrant2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sanger.ac.uk/about/press/2007/071009.html |title=Researchers Expand Efforts to Explore Functional Landscape of the Human Genome | author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=9 October 2007 |website=Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute | publisher=Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. |accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This new funding was part of NHGRI's endeavour to scale-up the ENCODE Project to a production phase on the entire genome along with additional pilot-scale studies.

'''2012 September'''&lt;br /&gt;
In September 2012, The GENCODE consortium published a major paper discussing the results from a major release – GENCODE Release 7, which was frozen in December 2011. The GENCODE 7 release used a combination of manual gene annotation from the Human and Vertebrate Analysis and Annotation (HAVANA) group and full new release (Ensembl release 62) of the automatic gene annotation from Ensembl. At the time of release, GENCODE Release 7 had the most comprehensive annotation of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) loci publicly available with the predominant transcript form consisting of two exons.&lt;ref name="Harrow2012" /&gt;

'''2013 - 2017'''&lt;br /&gt;
Having been involved in successfully delivering the definitive annotation of functional elements in the human genome, the GENCODE group were awarded a second grant in 2013 in order to continue their human genome annotation work and expand GENCODE to include annotation of the mouse genome.&lt;ref name="GENCODEHomepg"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gencodegenes.org/|title=GENCODE – Home page | author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=c. 2013 |website=GENCODE | publisher=Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. |accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is envisaged that the mouse annotation data will allow comparative studies between the human and mouse genomes, to improve annotation quality in both genomes.

Refer to the [ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/gencode/_README_stats.txt GENCODE Statistics README] and [http://www.gencodegenes.org/gencode_biotypes.html GENCODE biotypes page] for more details on the classification of the above gene set.

Through advancements in sequencing technologies (such as RT-PCR-seq), increased coverage from manual annotations (HAVANA group), and improvements to automatic annotation algorithms using Ensembl, the accuracy and completeness of GENCODE annotations have been continuously refined through its iteration of releases.

A comparison of key statistics from 3 major GENCODE releases is shown below.&lt;ref name="GENCODEStats" /&gt; It is evident that although the coverage, in terms of total number of genes discovered, is steady increasing, the number of protein-coding genes has actually decreased. This is mostly attributed to new experimental evidence obtained using [[Cap analysis gene expression|Cap Analysis Gene Expression (CAGE)]] clusters, annotated [[Polyadenylation|PolyA]] sites, and [[peptide]] hits.&lt;ref name="Harrow2012" /&gt;

==Methodology==
[[File:Gencode pipeline diagram.png|right|320px|thumb|GENCODE pipeline diagram. The schema shows the flow of data between manual annotation and automated annotation through specialized prediction pipelines to provide hints to first-pass annotation and quality control (QC). Annotated gene models are subject to experimental validation, and the AnnoTrack tracking system contains data from all these sources and is used to highlight differences, coordinate QC, and track outcomes. Manual and automated annotation processes produce the GENCODE data set and also used to QC the completed annotation.]]

The general process to create an annotation for GENCODE involves manual curation, different computational analysis and targeted experimental approaches. Putative loci can be verified by wet-lab experiments and computational predictions are analysed manually.&lt;ref name="GENCODEp2goals" /&gt;
Currently, to ensure a set of annotation covers the complete genome rather than just the regions that have been manually annotated, a merged data set is created using manual annotations from HAVANA, together with automatic annotations from the Ensembl automatically annotated gene set. This process also adds unique full-length CDS predictions from the Ensembl protein coding set into manually annotated genes, to provide the most complete and up-to-date annotation of the genome possible.&lt;ref name="Searle2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Searle, S |author2=Frankish, A |author3=Bignell, A |author4=Aken, B |author5=Derrien, T |author6=Diekhans, M | title= The GENCODE human gene set.| journal= Genome Biology | year= 2010 | volume= 11 | issue= Suppl 1 | pages= 36 | doi=10.1186/gb-2010-11-S1-P36| url=http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/S1/P36 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Automatic annotation (Ensembl)===

Ensembl transcripts are products of the Ensembl automatic gene annotation system (a collection of gene annotation pipelines), termed the Ensembl gene build. All Ensembl transcripts are based on experimental evidence and thus the automated pipeline relies on the mRNAs and protein sequences deposited into public databases from the scientific community.&lt;ref name="EnsemblGeneSet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://Aug2014.archive.ensembl.org/info/genome/genebuild/genome_annotation.html|title= Ensembl Gene Set |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=August 2014 |website=Ensembl |accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Protein levels 1 and 2 from UniProt, untranslated regions (UTRs), long intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA) genes (annotated using a combination of cDNA sequences and regulatory data from the Ensembl project), short non-coding RNAs (annotated using the Ensembl ncRNA pipelines) are included.&lt;ref name=" Harrow2012"/&gt;

===Manual Annotation (HAVANA group)===

The main approach to manual gene annotation is to annotate transcripts aligned to the genome and take the genomic sequences as the reference rather than the cDNAs. The finished genomic sequence is analyzed using a modified Ensembl pipeline, and BLAST results of cDNAs/ESTs and proteins, along with various ab initio predictions, can be analyzed manually in the annotation browser tool Otterlace. Thus, more alternative spliced variants can be predicted compared with cDNA annotation. Moreover, genomic annotation produces a more comprehensive analysis of pseudogenes.&lt;ref name=" Harrow2012"/&gt;
There are several analysis groups in the GENCODE consortium that run pipelines that aid the manual annotators in producing models in unannotated regions, and to identify potential missed or incorrect manual annotation, including completely missing loci, missing alternative isoforms, incorrect splice sites and incorrect biotypes. These are fed back to the manual annotators using the AnnoTrack tracking system.&lt;ref name="Kokocinski2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kokocinski, F |author2=Harrow, J |author3=Hubbard, T | title= AnnoTrack - a tracking system for genome annotation.| journal= BMC Genomics | year= 2010 | volume= 11 | pages= 538 | doi=10.1186/1471-2164-11-538 | url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/538 | pmid=20923551 | pmc=3091687}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these pipelines use data from other ENCODE subgroups including RNASeq data, histone modification and CAGE and Ditag data. RNAseq data is an important new source of evidence, but generating complete gene models from it is a difficult problem. As part of GENCODE, a competition was run to assess the quality of predictions produced by various RNAseq prediction pipelines (Refer to [[#RGASP|RGASP]] below). To confirm uncertain models, GENCODE also has an experimental validation pipeline using RNA sequencing and RACE &lt;ref name="Searle2010"/&gt;

===Ensembl/HAVANA Gene Merge process===

During the merge process, all HAVANA and Ensembl transcripts models are compared, first by clustering overlapped coding exons on a same strand, and then by pairwise comparisons of each exon in a cluster of transcripts. The module used to merge the gene set is HavanaAdder. Additional steps are required prior to running the HavanaAdder code (e.g. Ensembl health-checking system and queries against [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CCDS/CcdsBrowse.cgi CCDS] gene set and Ensembl´s cDNA alignments). If annotation described in external data sets is missing from the manual set, then this is stored in the AnnoTrack system to be reviewed.&lt;ref name="Harrow2012"/&gt;

===Assessing quality===

For GENCODE 7, transcript models are assigned a high or low level of support based on a new method developed to score the quality of transcripts. This method relies on [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] and [[Expressed sequence tag|EST]] alignments supplied by UCSC and Ensembl. The [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] and [[Expressed sequence tag|EST]] alignments are compared to the GENCODE transcripts, and the transcripts are scored according to the alignment over its full length. A summary of support levels for each chromosome in GENCODE Release 7 is shown in the figure on the right. The annotations are partitioned into those produced by the automated process, manual method and the merged annotations, where both processes result in the same annotation.&lt;ref name="Harrow2012"/&gt;

===General methods used for GENCODE 7===

'''Amplification, sequencing, mapping and validation exon–exon junction'''

Double-stranded cDNA of eight human tissues (brain, heart, kidney, testis, liver, spleen, lung, and skeletal muscle) were generated with a cDNA amplification, and the purified DNA was directly used to generate a sequencing library with the ‘‘Genomic DNA sample prep kit’’ (Illumina). This library was subsequently sequenced on an Illumina Genome Analyzer 2 platform. Then, reads (35 or 75 nt) were mapped on to the reference human genome (hg19) and the predicted spliced amplicons with Bowtie software. Only uniquely mapping reads with no mismatch were considered to validate a splice site (transcript). Splice junctions were validated if a minimum of 10 reads with the following characteristics spanned the predicted splice junctions. For 35- and 75-nt-long reads, it required at least 4 and 8 nt on each side of the breakpoints (i.e., on each targeted exon), respectively.&lt;ref name=" Harrow2012"/&gt;

'''Comparison of RefSeq, UCSC, AceView, and GENCODE transcripts'''

Transcripts belonging to four different data sets (GENCODE, [[RefSeq]], UCSC, and AceView) were compared to assess to which extent these data sets overlap. Releases compared were GENCODE 7, [[RefSeq]] and UCSC Genes freeze July 2011, and AceView 2010 release. The overlaps between different data set combinations were graphically represented as three-way Venn diagrams using the [[R (programming language)|Vennerable R]] package and edited manually.&lt;ref name=" Harrow2012"/&gt;

'''PhyloCSF analysis'''

PhyloCSF was used to identify potential novel coding genes in RNA-seq transcript models based on evolutionary signatures. For each transcript model generated from the Illumina HBM data using either Exonerate or Scripture, a mammalian alignment was generated by extracting the alignment of each exon from UCSC’s vertebrate alignments (which includes 33 placental mammals).&lt;ref name=" Harrow2012"/&gt;

'''APPRIS (CNIO)'''

APPRIS is a system that deploys a range of computational methods to provide value to the annotations of the human genome. APPRIS also selects one of the CDS for each gene as the principal isoform. Moreover, it defines the principal variant by combining protein structural and functional information and information from the conservation of related species. The APPRIS server has been used in the context of the scale up of the ENCODE project to annotate the Human genome but APPRIS is being used for other species (e.g. mouse, rat and zebrafish).&lt;ref name="APPRIS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://appris.bioinfo.cnio.es/|title= A system for annotating alternative splice isoforms | author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=July 2014 |website= APPRIS |accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pipeline is made up of separate modules that combine protein structure and function information and evolutionary evidence. Each module has been implemented as a separate web service.

==Usage/Access==
The current GENCODE Human gene set version (GENCODE Release 20) includes annotation files (in GTF and GFF3 formats), FASTA files and METADATA files associated with the GENCODE annotation on all genomic regions (reference-chromosomes/patches/scaffolds/haplotypes). The annotation data is referred on reference chromosomes and stored in separated files which include: Gene annotation, PolyA features annotated by HAVANA, (Retrotransposed) pseudogenes predicted by the Yale &amp; UCSC pipelines, but not by HAVANA, long non-coding RNAs, and tRNA structures predicted by tRNA-Scan.
Some examples of the lines in the GTF format are shown below:

=== Level definition ===
Each gene in the GENCODE data set are classified into three levels according to their type of annotation:

'''Level 1 (verified loci):'''
Includes transcripts that have been manually annotated and experimentally validated by RT-PCR-seq, and pseudogenes that have been validated by three different methodologies.&lt;ref name="Harrow2012"/&gt;

'''Level 2 (manually annotated loci):'''
Highlights transcripts that have been manually annotated by HAVANA only, and also includes transcripts that have been merged with models produced by the Ensembl automatic pipeline.&lt;ref name="Harrow2012"/&gt;

'''Level 3 (automatically annotated loci):'''
Indicates transcripts and pseudogene predictions resulting from Ensembl’s automated annotation pipeline.&lt;ref name="Harrow2012"/&gt;

=== Gene/Transcript status definition ===
Genes &amp; transcripts are assigned the status ‘‘known,’’ ‘‘novel,’’ or ‘‘putative’’ depending on their presence in other major databases and the evidence used to build their component transcripts.

'''Known:'''
Represented in the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) database and [[RefSeq]].&lt;ref name="Harrow2012"/&gt;

'''Novel:''' 
Not currently represented in HGNC or [[RefSeq]] databases, but are well supported by either locus specific transcript evidence or evidence from a paralogous or orthologous locus.&lt;ref name="Harrow2012"/&gt;

'''Putative:'''
Not currently represented in HGNC or [[RefSeq]] databases, but are supported by shorter, more sparse transcript evidence.&lt;ref name="Harrow2012"/&gt;

=== Biodalliance Genome Browser ===

Also, the GENCODE website contains a Genome Browser for human and mouse where you can reach any genomic region by giving the chromosome number and start-end position (e.g. 22:30,700,000..30,900,000), as well as by ENS transcript id (with/without version) , ENS gene id (with/without version) and gene name. The browser is powered by Biodalliance.

== Challenges ==

=== Definition of a "gene" ===
The definition of a "gene" has never been a trivial issue, with numerous definitions and notions proposed throughout the years since the discovery of the human genome. First, genes were conceived in the 1900s as discrete units of heredity, then it was thought as the blueprint for protein synthesis, and in more recent times, it was being defined as genetic code that is transcribed into RNA. Although the definition of a gene has evolved greatly over the last century, it has remained a challenging and controversial subject for many researchers. With the advent of the ENCODE/GENCODE project, even more problematic aspects of the definition have been uncovered, including alternative splicing (where a series of exons are separated by introns), intergenic transcriptions, and the complex patterns of dispersed regulation, together with non-genic conservation and the abundance of noncoding RNA genes. As GENCODE endeavours to build an encyclopaedia of genes and gene variants, these problems presented a mounting challenge for the GENCODE project to come up with an updated notion of a gene.&lt;ref name="Gerstein2007"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gerstein MB, Bruce C, Rozowsky JS, Zheng D, Du J, Korbel JO | title=What is a gene, post-ENCODE? History and updated definition. | journal=Genome Res | year= 2007 | volume= 17 | issue= 6 | pages= 669–81 | doi=10.1101/gr.6339607 | pmc= | pmid=17567988  |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pseudogenes ===
Pseudogenes have DNA sequences which are similar to functional protein-coding genes, however their transcripts are usually identified with a frameshift or deletion, and are generally annotated as a byproduct of protein-coding gene annotation in most genetic databases. However, recent analysis of retrotransposed pseudogenes have found some retransposed pseudogenes to be expressed and functional and to have major biological/regulatory impacts on human biology. To deal with the unknowns and complexities of pseudogenes, GENCODE has created a pseudogene ontology using a combination of automated, manual, and experimental methods to associate a variety of biological properties—such as sequence features, evolution, and potential biological functions to pseudogenes.&lt;ref name="Harrow2012" /&gt;

==Related Projects==

===ENCODE===

The [[ENCODE|Encyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE)]] is a public research consortium launched by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), in September 2003 (Pilot phase). The goal of ENCODE is to build a comprehensive parts list of functional elements in the human genome, including elements that act at the protein and RNA levels, and regulatory elements that control cells and circumstances in which a gene is active.&lt;ref name="Encodeproject"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.encodeproject.org/|title= ENCODE: Encyclopedia of DNA Elements|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=c. 2014 |website=ENCODE |accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Data analysis during the pilot phase (2003 - 2007) was coordinated by the Ensembl group, a joint project of EBI and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. During the initial pilot and technology development phases of the project, 44 regions—approximately 1% of the human genome—were targeted for analysis using a variety of experimental and computational methods.&lt;ref name="Encodepilotproject"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/pilot.html |title= ENCODE: Pilot Project at UCSC |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=c. 2007 |website=ENCODE |accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
All data produced by ENCODE investigators and the results of ENCODE analysis projects from 2003 to 2012 are hosted in the UCSC Genome browser and database. ENCODE results from 2013 and later are freely available for download and analysis from the ENCODE Project Portal. To annotate all evidence-based gene features (genes, transcripts, coding sequences, etc.) in the entire human genome at a high accuracy, ENCODE consortium create the subproject GENCODE.

===Human Genome Project===
The [[Human Genome Project]] was an international research effort to determine the sequence of the human genome and identify the genes that it contains. The Project was coordinated by the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Department of Energy. Additional contributors included universities across the United States and international partners in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, and China. The Human Genome Project formally began in 1990 and was completed in 2003, 2 years ahead of its original schedule.&lt;ref name="Human Genome Project"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/hgp/description |title= The Human Genome Project|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=1 September 2014 |website=Genetics Home Reference  |publisher= U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) |accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the release of the completed human genome sequence in April 2003, the scientific community intensified its efforts to mine the data for clues about how the body works in health and in disease. A basic requirement for this understanding of human biology is the ability to identify and characterize sequence-based functional elements through experimentation and computational analysis. In September 2003, the NHGRI introduced the ENCODE project to facilitate the identification and analysis of the complete set of functional elements in the human genome sequence.&lt;ref name="Encodepilotproject"/&gt;

== Sub Projects ==

===Ensembl===

[[Ensembl]] is part of the GENCODE project, and it has played a critical role to provide automatic annotation on the human reference genome assembly and to merge this annotation with manual annotation from the HAVANA team. The gene set provided by Ensembl for human is the GENCODE gene set &lt;ref name="EnsemblGencode"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ensembl.org/info/website/tutorials/encode.html |title= ENCODE data in Ensembl |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=August 2014 |website=Ensembl |accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===lncRNA Expression Microarray Design===
A key research area of the GENCODE project was to investigate the biological significance of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA).

The RNA-seq Genome Annotation Assessment Project (RGASP) project is designed to assess the effectiveness of various computational methods for high quality RNA-sequence data analysis. The primary goals of RGASP are to provide an unbiased evaluation for RNA-seq alignment, transcript characterisation (discovery, reconstruction and quantification) software, and to determine the feasibility of automated genome annotations based on transcriptome sequencing.&lt;ref name="GencodeRGASP12"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gencodegenes.org/rgasp/ |title= GENCODE - RGASP 1/2 Guidelines |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=c. 2013 |website=GENCODE | accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RGASP is organised in a consortium framework modelled after the EGASP (ENCODE Genome Annotation Assessment Project) gene prediction workshop, and two rounds of workshops have been conducted to address different aspects of RNA-seq analysis as well as changing sequencing technologies and formats. One of the main discoveries from rounds 1 &amp; 2 of the project was the importance of read alignment on the quality of gene predictions produced. Hence, a third round of RGASP workshop is currently being conducted (in 2014) to focus primarily on read mapping to the genome.&lt;ref name="GencodeRGASP3"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gencodegenes.org/rgasp/rgasp3.html |title= GENCODE - RGASP 1/2 Guidelines |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=c. 2013 |website=GENCODE | accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GNC Holdings Inc.''' (General Nutrition Centers) is a [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]-based American company selling health and nutrition related products, including [[vitamins]], [[Dietary supplement|supplements]], minerals, herbs, [[sports nutrition]], diet, and energy products.

==History==
[[File:GNCPromenade.JPG|thumb|A GNC store at [[The Promenade Shopping Centre|Promenade]]]]
In 1935, David Shakarian opened a small [[health food store]], Lackzoom, in downtown Pittsburgh.  He only made [[United States dollar|US$]]35 on his first day, but was able to open a second store within six months. A year later, Shakarian suffered from what appeared to be a fatal blow when the [[Ohio River]] [[Pittsburgh flood of 1936|flooded into downtown]] on [[St. Patrick's Day]]. Both of his stores were wiped out.  However, he quickly rebuilt both stores, and opened five more by 1941.  The company officially registered as a corporation on September 1, 1936 Shakarian moved into the mail order business during WWII. He said that customers sent him a check and asked him to mail their product as they could not drive to his store due to the gas rationing which happened during WWII.  During the [[health food]] craze of the 1960s, Shakarian expanded his chain outside Pittsburgh for the first time, and in the process changed its name to '''G'''eneral '''N'''utrition '''C'''enter.  He continued to run the chain until his death in 1984. Shakarian took GNC public (listed on the NYSE) in the 1980s.  Overexpansion and his death in 1984 resulted in a highly leveraged GNC.  The Shakarian family decided to sell GNC shortly after his death.  The family brought in a "turn around" executive, Jerry Horn, with instructions to "stop the bleeding" and position GNC to be sold.  

In 1990 the company considered relocating but a public/private effort retained GNC headquarters in [[Downtown Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last  = Daparma| first = Ron| author-link = | title = Robinson to retire as RIDC president| newspaper = Pittsburgh Tribune-Review| publication-place = Pittsburgh, PA| volume = | issue  = | date   = April 17, 2003| page   =| url    = http://triblive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/business/s_129671.html#axzz2jUu0Yoiq}}&lt;/ref&gt;  GNC was taken private and sold to The Thomas Lee Company, a PE investment/management fund in the late 1980s.  Thomas Lee ran GNC and took it public prior to selling the company to Royal Dutch Numico and [[Numico]] acquired GNC in 1999; it sold GNC to [[Apollo Management]] in 2003. [[Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan]] and [[Ares Management]] bought GNC in 2007. GNC went public in 2011.

In 2018, Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Holding Co., a company controlled by the Chinese government, agreed to acquire an approximately 40% stake in GNC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gnc-harbin-pharma-investment/chinas-harbin-pharma-to-buy-stake-in-u-s-health-retailer-gnc-idUSKCN1FY0DL |title=China's Harbin Pharma to buy stake in U.S. health retailer GNC |author=Kate Wu |publisher=Reuters |date=February 13, 2018 |accessdate=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retail stores==
[[Image:General Nutrition Centers Store.JPG|thumb|175px|left|GNC store, [[Ypsilanti Township, Michigan|Ypsilanti Twp., MI]]]]
GNC stores typically stock a wide range of [[weight loss]], [[bodybuilding supplement|bodybuilding]],  [[nutritional supplements]], [[vitamins]], natural remedies, and health and beauty products, in both its owned brands as well as third-party brands. The stores also sell health and fitness books and magazines.

GNC has more than 6,000 stores in the U.S., including 1,100 [[store-within-a-store]] locations within [[Rite Aid]], as well as locations in 49 other countries. In addition, GNC LiveWell currently has 41 Stores located in Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne in Australia.

==Business model==
GNC retail stores are a combination of corporate-owned and [[Franchising|franchised]] stores;  950 of the 5,000 domestic US stores are franchises, commonly located within urban [[shopping malls]] and shopping zones. In addition to the GNC.com website, GNC's products are sold on [[drugstore.com]].

==Lawsuits==
In 1998, GNC was accused of purposely running its franchisees out of business in order to "retake" the stores into corporate control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E7D71631F931A1575BC0A9679C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Franchisees On Edge; Some Angry Ones Sue As GNC Competes |date=2001-08-22 |accessdate=2014-02-11|newspaper=The New York Times |last1=Hays |first1=Constance L. }}&lt;/ref&gt; An April 30, 2003 article states that the GNC corporate company was sued by numerous franchise owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/stories/2003/04/28/daily32.html |title=Franchisees sue GNC in New Jersey - Pittsburgh Business Times |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date=2003-04-30 |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complaint is that the parent company was allowing their corporate owned stores to sell products for less than the franchise stores are allowed to sell them for.  The suit also claimed that GNC charged high "reset fees" to franchisees when there is new signage that needs to be changed in the store or an image facelift that must be done by GNC corporate. A similar lawsuit was filed again in an article written on October 20, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/stories/2004/10/18/daily15.html?q=gnc%20franchasing%20complaints |title=GNC franchisees file lawsuit - Pittsburgh Business Times |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date=2004-10-20 |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, [[Attorney General of New York|New York Attorney General]] [[Eric Schneiderman]] sent [[cease and desist]] letters to GNC and other major retailers due to concerning laboratory tests regarding the accuracy of the claimed contents of supplements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/ag-schneiderman-asks-major-retailers-halt-sales-certain-herbal-supplements-dna-tests|title=A.G.

In October 2015, the Attorney General of Oregon filed a lawsuit against GNC alleging that the company knowingly sold products containing the ingredients [[picamilon]] and [[BMPEA]], which are banned by the FDA.&lt;ref name=Oregon&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aguillard|first1=Anna|title=Oregon's crackdown on GNC part of nation-wide crackdown on dietary supplement industry|url=http://legalnewsline.com/stories/510648727-oregon-s-crackdown-on-gnc-part-of-nation-wide-crackdown-on-dietary-supplement-industry|accessdate=1 December 2015|publisher=Legal News Line|date=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ORegon 1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=Alison|title=Oregon AG accuses retailer GNC of selling drug-spiked dietary supplements|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/10/22/oregon-lawsuit-gnc-supplements/74344318/|accessdate=1 December 2015|publisher=USA Today|date=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orgeon 3"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Germano|first1=Sara|last2=NG|first2=Serena|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/oregon-sues-gnc-alleging-supplements-contained-illegal-ingredients-1445543143|accessdate=1 December 2015|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 2, 2017, GNC threatened to sue the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] for "significant economic and reputational damages, lost opportunities, and consequential damages", after an advertisement for the chain was blocked from airing during [[Super Bowl LI]]. Despite repeated approvals by Fox, the network stated that the ad had been vetoed by the [[National Football League]] because of GNC's placement on an [[NFLPA]] blacklist for selling products that contain substances banned by the NFL. The letter of intent claimed that Fox had not informed them of any such rules when they purchased the ad time, and cited that the purchase induced them to "spend millions of dollars in production costs and in the development of a national, coordinated marketing and rebranding campaign" around the commercial. The NFL itself does not prohibit ads for health stores unless they contain references to specific prohibited products; the GNC ad only contained motivational themes and no references to its products.&lt;ref name="usatoday-gnclawsuit"&gt;{{cite web|title=GNC's Super Bowl ad controversy escalates|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/super/2017/02/03/gnc-super-bowl-commercial-controversy-fox/97436046/|website=USA Today|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj-nflbannedcompany"&gt;{{Cite news|title=GNC's Super Bowl Ad Rejected by NFL|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/gncs-super-bowl-ad-rejected-by-nfl-1485886063|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=1 February 2017|date=2017-01-31|last1=Bruell|first1=Alexandra}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday-gncban"&gt;{{cite web|title=Watch the GNC ad the NFL rejected from Super Bowl|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ad-meter/2017/01/31/gnc-ad-commercial-super-bowl-rejected/97275868/|website=USA Today|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Galactose''' ({{IPAc-en|g|ə|ˈ|l|æ|k|t|oʊ|s}}, ''[[wikt:galacto-|galacto-]]'' + ''[[wikt:-ose#Suffix 2|-ose]]'', "milk sugar"), sometimes abbreviated '''Gal''', is a [[monosaccharide]] [[Carbohydrate|sugar]] that is about as [[sweetness|sweet]] as [[glucose]], and about 30% as sweet as [[sucrose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=db5QAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA264|title=Optimising Sweet Taste in Foods|last=Spillane|first=W. J.|date=2006-07-17|publisher=Woodhead Publishing|year=|isbn=9781845691646|location=|pages=264|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a C-4 [[epimer]] of [[glucose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QOoPlLgN5UMC&amp;pg=PA43|title=Organic Reactions Stereochemistry And Mechanism (Through Solved Problems)|last=Kalsi|first=P. S.|date=2007|publisher=New Age International|year=|isbn=9788122417661|location=|pages=43|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Galactan]] is a [[polymer]]ic form of galactose found in [[hemicellulose]], and forming the core of the galactans, a class of natural polymeric carbohydrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=GDuy5zL6eRAC&amp;pg=PA78|title=The Antibodies|last=Zanetti|first=Maurizio|last2=Capra|first2=Donald J.|date=2003-09-02|publisher=CRC Press|year=|isbn=9780203216514|location=|pages=78|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''galactose'' was coined by Charles Weissman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Weismann in the 1940 Census {{!}} Ancestry|url=https://www.ancestry.com/1940-census/usa/New-York/Charles-Weismann_86gdp|website=www.ancestry.com|accessdate=26 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the mid 19th century and is derived from Greek ''galaktos'' (milk) and the generic chemical suffix for sugars ''[[-ose]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhat|first1=Paike Jayadeva|title=Galactose Regulon of Yeast: From Genetics to Systems Biology|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ofEx-CsVlIAC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;dq=galactose+is+coined+by&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MB7yRs_sqW&amp;sig=N0_Bp8dmRdCDQBMTS3wVS9sOayw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjI-4ru7KfYAhWMPI8KHR9pCzMQ6AEIOTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=galactose%20is%20coined%20by&amp;f=false|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|accessdate=26 December 2017|language=en|date=2 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The etymology is comparable to that of the word ''[[lactose]]'' in that both contain roots meaning "milk sugar". Lactose is a disaccharide of galactose plus glucose.

==Structure and isomerism==
Galactose exists in both open-chain and cyclic form. The open-chain form has a [[carbonyl]] at the end of the chain.

Four isomers are cyclic, two of them with a [[pyranose]] (six-membered) ring, two with a [[furanose]] (five-membered) ring. Galactofuranose occurs in bacteria, fungi and protozoa,&lt;ref&gt;Nassau et al.

In the cyclic form there are two [[anomer]]s, named alpha and beta, since the transition from the open-chain form to the cyclic form involves the creation of a new [[stereocenter]] at the site of the open-chain [[carbonyl]]. In the beta form, the alcohol group is in the equatorial position, whereas in the alpha form, the alcohol group is in the axial position.&lt;ref name="Ophardt, C.

==Relationship to lactose==
Galactose is a [[monosaccharide]]. When combined with [[glucose]] (monosaccharide), through a [[condensation reaction]], the result is the [[disaccharide]] [[lactose]]. The [[hydrolysis]] of lactose to glucose and galactose is [[catalysis|catalyzed]] by the [[enzyme]]s [[lactase]] and [[beta-galactosidase|β-galactosidase]]. The latter is produced by the [[Lac operon|''lac'' operon]] in ''[[Escherichia coli]]''.

In nature, lactose is found primarily in milk and milk products. Consequently, various food products made with dairy-derived ingredients can contain lactose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/lactoseintolerance/ |title=Lactose Intolerance – National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse |last=Staff &lt;!-- Verified: No author provided on page. --&gt; |work=digestive.niddk.nih.gov |date=June 2009 |accessdate=January 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galactose [[metabolism]], which converts galactose into glucose, is carried out by the three principal enzymes in a mechanism known as the [[Leloir pathway]]. The enzymes are listed in the order of the metabolic pathway: galactokinase (GALK), galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT), and UDP-galactose-4’-epimerase (GALE).

In human [[lactation]], glucose is changed into galactose via hexoneogenesis to enable the [[mammary glands]] to secrete lactose. However, most lactose in [[breast milk]] is synthesized from galactose taken up from the blood, and only 35±6% is made from galactose from ''de novo'' synthesis.

Glucose is the primary metabolic fuel for humans. It is more stable than galactose and is less susceptible to the formation of nonspecific glycoconjugates, molecules with at least one sugar attached to a protein or lipid. Many speculate that it is for this reason that a pathway for rapid conversion from galactose to glucose has been [[Conservation (genetics)|highly conserved]] among many species.&lt;ref name=OMMBID72&gt;{{cite book |url=https://ommbid.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?bookid=971&amp;sectionid=62672411 |url-access=subscription |title=The Online Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease  |chapter=Galactosemia |vauthors=Fridovich-Keil JL, Walter JH |veditors=Valle D, Beaudet AL, Vogelstein B, Kinzler KW, Antonarakis SE, Ballabio A, Gibson KM, Mitchell G |work=The Online Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease}}&lt;br /&gt;a 4 b 21 c 22 d 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The main pathway of galactose metabolism is the [[Leloir pathway]]; humans and other species, however, have been noted to contain several alternate pathways, such as the [[De Ley Doudoroff pathway]]. The Leloir pathway consists of the latter stage of a two-part process that converts β-D-galactose to [[Uridine diphosphate glucose|UDP-glucose]]. The initial stage is the conversion of β-D-galactose to α-D-galactose by the enzyme, mutarotase (GALM). The Leloir pathway then carries out the conversion of α-D-galactose to UDP-glucose via three principal enzymes: Galactokinase (GALK) phosphorylates α-D-galactose to galactose-1-phosphate, or Gal-1-P; Galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) transfers a UMP group from UDP-glucose to Gal-1-P to form UDP-galactose; and finally, UDP galactose-4’-epimerase (GALE) interconverts UDP-galactose and UDP-glucose, thereby completing the pathway.&lt;ref name=Bosch07&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bosch AM |title=Classical galactosaemia revisited |journal=J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=516–25 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16838075 |doi=10.1007/s10545-006-0382-0 |url=}}&lt;br /&gt; a 517 b 516 c 519&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Galactosemia]] is an inability to properly break down galactose due to a genetically inherited mutation in one of the enzymes in the Leloir pathway. As a result, the consumption of even small quantities is harmful to galactosemics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1518|title=Classic Galactosemia and Clinical Variant Galactosemia|author=Gerard T Berry|work=nih.gov|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galactose is found in [[dairy product]]s, [[avocados]], [[sugar beet]]s, other [[natural gum|gum]]s and [[mucilage]]s. It is also [[Biosynthesis|synthesized]] by the body, where it forms part of [[glycolipid]]s and [[glycoprotein]]s in several [[Biological tissue|tissue]]s; and is a by-product from the [[Algae fuel|third-generation ethanol]] production process (from macroalgae).

==Clinical significance==
Chronic systemic exposure of [[mice]], [[rat]]s, and ''[[Drosophila]]'' to D-galactose causes the acceleration of [[senescence]] (aging). It has been reported that high dose exposure of D-galactose (120 mg/Kg) can cause reduced sperm concentration and sperm motility in rodent and has been extensively used as an aging model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pourmemar E, Majdi A, Haramshahi M, Talebi M, Karimi P, Sadigh-Eteghad S, |title=Intranasal Cerebrolysin Attenuates Learning and Memory Impairments in D-galactose-Induced Senescence in Mice |journal=Experimental Gerontology |volume=87 |issue=Pt A |pages=16–22 |year=2017 |pmid=27894939|doi=10.1016/j.exger.2016.11.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first1 = X.

Galactose is a component of the antigens present on blood cells that determine blood type within the [[ABO blood group system]]. In O and A antigens, there are two [[monomer]]s of galactose on the antigens, whereas in the B antigens there are three monomers of galactose.&lt;ref name="Raven and Johnson"&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding Biology|edition=3rd|author1=Peter H.

A disaccharide composed of two units of galactose, [[galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose]] (alpha-gal), has been recognized as a potential [[allergen]] present in [[mammal meat]]. [[Alpha-gal allergy]] may be triggered by [[lone star tick]] bites.

== History ==

In 1855, E. O. Erdmann noted that hydrolysis of lactose produced a substance besides glucose.&lt;ref&gt;See:

From page 348: ''"Je propose de le nommer ''lactose''."'' (I propose to name it ''lactose''.)&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1860, [[Marcellin Berthelot|Berthelot]] renamed it "galactose" or "glucose lactique".&lt;ref&gt;Marcellin Berthelot, ''Chimie organique fondée sur la synthèse'' [Organic chemistry based on synthesis] (Paris, France:  Mallet-Bachelier, 1860), vol. 2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7AtQYV5FlVwC&amp;pg=PA248#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 248–249].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Galactose" — from the [[Ancient Greek]] [[wikt:γάλακτος|γάλακτος]] (gálaktos, “milk”).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894, [[Hermann Emil Fischer|Emil Fischer]] and Robert Morrell determined the [[molecular configuration|configuration]] of galactose.&lt;ref&gt;Emil Fischer and Robert S.

{{main article|Greek Theatre of Syracuse}}
The '''Grotta del Ninfeo''' is an artificial cavity in the rock of Temenite Hill (named after the Greek ''temenos'', "sacred precinct") located in the Archaeological park of [[Neapolis (Syracuse)|Neapolis]] in [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]].

== Terrace of Temenite Hill ==
The grotta is located near the highest part of the little rocky relief, on a rectangular terrace which verges on the [[Greek Theatre of Syracuse|Greek theatre]] and opens at the centre of a stone wall where a closed [[portico]] in the form of an "L" was once found. At the entrance there were statues dedicated to the [[Muse]]s, three of which (dated to the 2nd century BC)&lt;ref&gt;''Sicilia'', Touring Editore, 1989, pag. 596&lt;/ref&gt; are still preserved and are on display at the [[Museo archeologico regionale Paolo Orsi]]. The fountain is dedicated to the [[Ancient Greek]] cult of the [[nymph]]s, nature goddesses. The name [[nymphaeum]] for a monumental, decorated fountain derives from this.

The Syracusan nymphaeum is thought to have been the ancient location of the ''Mouseion'' (the sanctuary of the Muses), seat of the artistic guild, where the Syracusan actors gathered before descending into the theatre to put on [[Greek comedy|comedies]] and [[Greek tragedy|tragedies]] in the time of [[Epicharmus of Cos|Epicharmus]] and [[Aeschylus]].

Regarding the Grotta del Ninfeo, the Syracusan Giuseppe Politi wrote in the nineteenth century:
{{quote|There, with squared niches of various dimensions on all sides for votive tables and epitaphs, and further cells for catacombs, was a corridor in the living rock which we call the ''Sepulchral street'' and a large grotto opens at one point, with vestiges on the outside of [[triglyph]]s and with two aqueducts at the bottom, one vertically perpendicular to the other, encounter an artificial crack in the rock. This grotta is perennially supplied with water by one of these, on account of which it is called the ''Grotta dell'acqua''. It may have originally been for the use of the victorious [[Ephebes]] of the Academy of Music just like the one that [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] says was at the [[Theatre of Dionysus|Theatre of Athens]]. Alternatively, perhaps more likely, a nymphaeum, i.e. a grotto decorated with many statues of the nymphs, with water sports, as the name suggests.|Giuseppe Politi, ''Siracusa pei viaggiatori'' [...]&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe Politi, ''Siracusa pei viaggiatori, ovvero Descrizione storica, artistica,topografica delle attuali antichità di Ortigia, Acradina, Tica, Napoli ,ed Epipoli, che componevano l'antica Siracusa'', 1835&lt;/ref&gt; 1835}}

The grotto has a [[vault (architecture)|vaulted]] ceiling and inside it there is a rectangular tub in which the water collects before cascading from a cavity located at the bottom of the rock wall. Next to the entrance, there are some votive [[aedicula]] which were used for hero cults (''Pinakes'').&lt;ref&gt;[[:it:Giuseppe Bellafiore|Giuseppe Bellafiore]], ''La civiltà artistica della Sicilia dalla preistoria ad oggi'', F. Le Monnier, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; To the east of the Grotta del Ninfeo, the last [[watermill]] from the [[Spanish Sicily|Spanish period]] remains visible even today. It took water from the grotta and redirected it into the theatre after using it to mill grain. From nymphaeum, one continues to the [[Via dei Sepolcri]] and from there to the summit of the hill, where there are other Graeco-Roman monuments. 
[[File:Ninfeo Houel.jpg|thumb|The Grotta del ninfeo as painted by Houel|350x350px]]
The water that flows into the Grotta derives from two separate [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueducts]], both of Greek date; one is called the ''Acquedotto del Ninfeo'' (Nymphaeum Aqueduct) after the Grotta,&lt;ref name=notauno&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.regione.sicilia.it/beniculturali/dirbenicult/database/page_musei/pagina_musei.asp?ID=55&amp;IdSito=75|title=Area archeologica - Regione Siciliana Assessorato Beni culturali}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the other is the [[Galermi Aqueduct]].&lt;ref name=notauno/&gt;

== Depiction by Jean Hoüel ==
During one of his trips to Syracuse in the second half of the 1700s, the painter [[Jean-Pierre Houël]] depicted the Grotta del Ninfeo as he found it. The [[gouache]] shows a much deeper grotta than today, with water descending towards the theatre, where the mills were installed. In the grotta, some women are busy making cloth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author = Francesca Gringeri Pantano|title = Jean Houel, Voyage a Siracusa|year = |publisher = Sellerio editore|location= Palermo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26284">With less than 1 percent of the population estimated to be [[HIV]]-positive, '''[[Egypt]]''' is a low-HIV-prevalence country. However, between the years 2006 and 2011, HIV prevalence rates in Egypt increased tenfold.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/egypt/hiv_aids.html|title=UNICEF Egypt - HIV/AIDS - Context|website=www.unicef.org|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2011, the average number of new cases of HIV in Egypt was 400 per year. But, in 2012 and 2013 it increased to about 600 new cases and in 2014 it reached 880 new cases per year.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/7/48/139780/Life--Style/Health/INTERVIEW-HIVAIDS-in-Egypt-Facts,-numbers-and-chal.aspx|title=INTERVIEW: HIV/AIDS in Egypt: Facts, numbers and challenges - Health - Life &amp; Style - Ahram Online|website=english.ahram.org.eg|language=en|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to UNAIDS 2016 statistics, there are about 11,000 people currently living with HIV in Egypt.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/egypt|title=Country Factsheets: EGYPT 2016|last=UNAIDS|first=|date=2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unsafe behaviors among most-at-risk populations and limited [[condom]] usage among the general population place Egypt at risk of a broader [[epidemic]].&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Boutros, S., &amp; Skordis, J.

Among officially reported cases, [[heterosexual intercourse]] is the primary mode of transmission of HIV (49.1 percent), followed by [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] intercourse (22.9 percent), [[Dialysis|renal dialysis]] (12 percent), and [[blood transfusion]] (6.2 percent), according to the National Aids Program (NAP) in an official report issued in January 2008.&lt;ref name="usaid22"&gt;[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/ane/egypt_profile.pdf "Health Profile: Egypt"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905172131/http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/ane/egypt_profile.pdf|date=2008-09-05}}. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (March 2008). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males are four times more likely to have HIV than females, but this may be due to more men being tested than women. Other people likely to be exposed to HIV in Egypt include [[street children]], [[prison]]ers, and [[refugee]]s. A [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) funded&lt;ref name="usaid22" /&gt; Biological-Behavioral Surveillance Survey was conducted by the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP) to explore HIV prevalence rates among most-at-risk groups. The survey targeted street children, female [[sex worker]]s (FSWs), men who have sex with men (MSM), and injecting drug users (IDUs). The study identified an infection rate of 6.9 percent and 7.7 percent in MSM and intravenous drug users respectively.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; These statistics fuel some of the hypotheses''' '''that there is a concentrated HIV epidemic occurring in Egypt among high-risk groups, but due to social stigma and lack of prevalence data, it is not acknowledged.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Nonetheless, over time, the Egyptian government has made efforts to improve the lives of people with HIV and AIDS in the country.

== History ==
Egypt reported its first case of [[HIV/AIDS]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Faris|first=R.|last2=Shouman|first2=A.|date=1994|title=Study of the knowledge, attitude of Egyptian health care workers towards occupational HIV infection|journal=The Journal of the Egyptian Public Health Association|volume=69|issue=1-2|pages=115–128|issn=0013-2446|pmid=7775891}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was about the same time that other countries in the Middle East and North Africa region also started seeing their first cases of HIV. In 1987, one year after the discovery of the disease in Egypt, the National Aids Program (NAP) in Egypt was formed.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; By March 1993, there were 359 people infected with HIV.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In 1990, the NAP tested over 135,000 blood bags and only four were HIV positive.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lenton|first=Cliff|date=|title=Cairo: Will Egypt escape the AIDS epidemic?|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673605629066|journal=The Lancet|language=en|volume=349|issue=9057|pages=|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(05)62906-6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, many of the early cases came from infected blood products or dialysis. In 1993, approximately 60 kidney dialysis patients became infected with HIV, while in 1997 about 20 people became HIV positive from infected blood transfusions.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://internationalreportingproject.org/stories/view/egypt-confronting-hiv|title=Stories - Egypt confronting HIV — International Reporting Project|website=internationalreportingproject.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region ===
In the early 90's several studies suggested that there was overall a very low, presence of HIV in the [[MENA]] region. By the end of 1996 only 27,000 people in the region died of HIV related causes while in [[Europe]] and [[sub-Saharan Africa]] that number was 170,000 and 4.6 million respectively.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; But, over time, research revealed that there were more HIV cases in the region than accounted for.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alkaiyat|first=Abdulsalam|last2=Weiss|first2=Mitchell G.|date=December 2013|title=HIV in the Middle East and North Africa: priority, culture, and control|journal=International Journal of Public Health|volume=58|issue=6|pages=927–937|doi=10.1007/s00038-013-0485-y|issn=1661-8564|pmid=23824483}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the HIV prevalence rate in MENA is less than that of [[Tuberculosis]] and [[Diabetes mellitus|Diabetes]]. In 2009, the [[United Nations Development Programme|United Nations Development Program]] placed the MENA region in the lowest category for [[Antiretroviral therapy|antiretroviral therapy (ART)]] access in the years 2003-2006, but access has improved over time.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Even though great progress has been made in the HIV continuum and the general understanding of the disease globally, progress in the MENA region has been limited due to lack of data and surrounding controversy.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; While it is estimated that only two percent of people with HIV are from the MENA area, the region has one of the fastest growing epidemics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/JC2257_UNAIDS-MENA-report-2011_en_1.pdf|title=UNAIDS Middle East and North Africa Regional Report|last=|first=|date=2011|website=UNAIDS|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, many people were unconcerned about the disease due to its stigmatization, allowing the HIV epidemic to become more of an issue as time progressed. This is especially true in the MENA region where people thought, and some still do, that HIV only effects marginalized groups such as MSM and IDUs. Thus, those who didn't identify with these groups dismissed HIV as an insignificant issue.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

== HIV transmission and prevention ==
In Egypt, HIV is most prevalent in high risk groups including street children, female [[sex worker]]s (FSWs), men who have sex with men (MSM), and injecting drug users (IDUs).&lt;ref name=":122"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abu-Raddad|first=Laith J.|last2=Hilmi|first2=Nahla|last3=Mumtaz|first3=Ghina|last4=Benkirane|first4=Manal|last5=Akala|first5=Francisca Ayodeji|last6=Riedner|first6=Gabriele|last7=Tawil|first7=Oussama|last8=Wilson|first8=David|date=July 2010|title=Epidemiology of HIV infection in the Middle East and North Africa|journal=AIDS|volume=24 Suppl 2|pages=S5–23|doi=10.1097/01.aids.0000386729.56683.33|issn=1473-5571|pmid=20610949}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, the average percentage of HIV infections through blood transfusions/products is only 5 percent. However, in Egypt, about 24 percent of all its known HIV cases are from infected blood products.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; There's also been five outbreaks in renal dialysis because of unsterile equipment. While the MOHP established an infection control program in 2003, controlling these infections is still challenging due to lack of training, proper equipment, and the fragile Egyptian health care system. In regards to intravenous drug use, between 16 percent and 41 percent of recreational drug users in Egypt use injected drugs, and about half of those have shared or reused syringes.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; One study explored sexual relations within the Egyptian population to determine prominence of HIV transmission and found that of the 74 percent in the study that were sexually active, 15 percent had more than three partners in the last month and 58 percent had never used a condom.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; About 26 percent of all HIV cases in Egypt occur in MSM and studies conducted by the NAP revealed very low rates of condom usage, along with multiple sexual partners among the MSM population.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Additionally, many of the transmission cases are due to disease and to foreigners visiting or citizens living outside of the country, fueling some people's beliefs that HIV is a western disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McFarland|first=Willi|last2=Abu-Raddad|first2=Laith J.|last3=Mahfoud|first3=Ziyad|last4=DeJong|first4=Jocelyn|last5=Riedner|first5=Gabriele|last6=Forsyth|first6=Andrew|last7=Khoshnood|first7=Kaveh|date=Summer 2010|title=HIV/AIDS in the Middle East and North Africa: New study methods, results, and implications for prevention and care|journal=AIDS|volume=24|issue=Suppl 2|pages=S1–S4|doi=10.1097/01.aids.0000386728.49059.92|issn=0269-9370|pmc=2953558|pmid=20610944|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although HIV prevention is not as comprehensive in Egypt as other parts of the world, the conservative religious beliefs in the country, both of the Muslim majority and the Coptic minority, provide their own form of protection. For instance, they frown upon promiscuity, homosexuality, and sex before marriage. These religious norms, along with widespread male circumcision, have resulted in decreased HIV transmission rates.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":122" /&gt; However, over-reliance on the protection created by religious and cultural values has made HIV stigma and denial a problem. The protection that these values provide is counterbalanced by the stigma and discrimination that accompany those who defy these boundaries, leading to less HIV testing and treatment. Thus, the overall net impact on prevention is modest.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

== Societal stigma ==
Egypt still faces several challenges in maintaining low prevalence of HIV/AIDS. There is a general reluctance on the part of the government and civil society to discuss issues related to marginalized groups such as MSM, FSWs, and IDUs.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The conservative nature of Egyptian society stigmatizes these high-risk groups, making HIV surveillance studies in Egypt more difficult. The General Penalties Laws in Egypt criminalize [[Commercial sex workers|commercial sex work]] and intravenous drug use, as many other countries do. However, there are also other laws that criminalize homosexual activity, stating that it is inappropriate social conduct and an insult to religion.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; In some parts of Egyptian society, it is considered immoral to have HIV. Additionally, the mortality of people with HIV only seemed to justify the conservative society's view of homosexuality and promiscuity as sinful actions.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; These views further the cloud of stigma and shame associated with having HIV in Egypt and prevent people from utilizing the HIV testing services.

In addition, there a lack of effective [[Sexually transmitted disease|STI]]/HIV/AIDS education programs and other preventive measures, such as peer education, outreach work, and behavior change communications among at-risk groups.&lt;ref name="usaid22" /&gt; This stems from the lack of overall knowledge about the disease. According to recent studies, there is an imminent need for improved education of healthcare workers about HIV/AIDS in Egypt. Specifically, a 2016 study performed at Tanta University Hospital in Tanta, Egypt revealed that there were high levels of discrimination and stigma against people living with HIV among health care workers.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kabbash|first=Ibrahim Ali|last2=Ali|first2=Ehab A. Abo|last3=Elgendy|first3=Mostafa Mahmoud|last4=Abdrabo|first4=Mostafa Mohamed|last5=Salem|first5=Helal Mohamed|last6=Gouda|first6=Mohammed Ramadan|last7=Elbasiony|first7=Yousef Saleh|last8=Elboshy|first8=Nader|last9=Hamed|first9=Mohammed|date=2016-10-18|title=HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination among health care workers at Tanta University Hospitals, Egypt|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-016-7848-x|journal=Environmental Science and Pollution Research|language=en|pages=1–8|doi=10.1007/s11356-016-7848-x|issn=0944-1344}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, of the 310 studied participants, 40 percent said that they would be worried about providing care to HIV patients.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; About  21.3 percent said they would be worried about touching cloths of patients with HIV, 27.4 percent said they'd be scared to get blood samples from people with HIV, and 26.4 percent said they'd be worried to dress HIV patients' wounds.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Additionally, 34.8 percent of the physicians studied and 65.8 percent of the nurses believed that irresponsible behavior led to patients' HIV infections.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

A collaboration between UNAIDS, the Egyptian Ministry of Health, and numerous Egyptian universities was established to help better train medical personnel to deal with the disease, as a way to fight the present stigma and misconceptions.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Additionally, the lack of knowledge about the disease among Egyptian youth has the potential of greatly broadening the epidemic. In 2010, there were over 1,500 Egyptian youth (ages 15–24) with HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/mena/HIV(3).pdf|title=Egypt Programme Profile: HIV and AIDS|last=|first=|date=|website=UNICEF|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While only 11% of HIV cases in Egypt are among the youth, the early average age of sexual initiation, and increasing tendencies of premarital sex could augment these rates.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== HIV testing and treatment ==
Because of the stigma around the disease, many people in Egypt are afraid to get tested for HIV. In the years before 2004, the majority of HIV cases recorded in Egypt were due to mandated testing, such as for blood donors, foreigners staying in the country for more than six months, and citizens applying for permits to work overseas.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=2cd63ff7-d2ca-4143-855a-c793ee58c7fe@pdc-v-sessmgr01|title=HIV/AIDS services for refugees in Egypt.: EBSCOhost|website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though voluntary testing was available, people were discouraged from utilizing these services because of the requirement that those who tested positive be identified and reported to the MOHP. According to UNAIDS statistics, about 6,500 people know of their HIV positive status, which is 57 percent of those who are infected.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; In 2005, the MOHP, with the help of Family Health International (An Egyptian organization funded by U.S. Agency for International Development),&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; established a system of voluntary confidential counseling and testing (VCCT) for anonymous testing, which encouraged more people to find out their HIV status.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Moreover, many people who get diagnosed with Tuberculosis get tested for HIV. More specifically, in 2010 about half of the TB patients got tested for HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/country/documents/EGY_narrative_report_2015.pdf|title=National HIV Programme Situation and Gap Analysis - Egypt|last=|first=|date=|website=NAP - National Aids Programme|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, less than 1 percent of adult TB patients are HIV-positive. However, continued monitoring is necessary because an increase in the incidence of HIV-TB co-infection could add to the complexity of fighting both diseases in Egypt.&lt;ref name="usaid22" /&gt;

By the end of 2006, according to UNAIDS, 22 percent of HIV-infected women and men were receiving [[Anti-Retroviral Therapy|antiretroviral therapy (ART).]]&lt;ref name="usaid22" /&gt; In 2014, about 1,323 people received ART treatment.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In 2016, that number increased to 3,100 people, which is about 27 percent of the infected population.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; In 2010, a qualitative study was conducted to gather data about ART adherence and limitations. They interviewed 27 HIV positive Egyptian women who had been receiving ART for at least three months. The results showed that there were five key factors that served as obstacles to adherence to treatment, which were "fear of stigma, financial constraints, characteristics of ART, social support, and reliance on faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Badahdah|first=Abdallah M.|last2=Pedersen|first2=Daphne E.|date=2011-06-01|title="I Want to Stand on My Own Legs": a qualitative study of antiretroviral therapy adherence among HIV-positive women in Egypt|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/09540121.2010.534431|journal=AIDS Care|volume=23|issue=6|pages=700–704|doi=10.1080/09540121.2010.534431|issn=0954-0121|pmid=21476148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National response ==

=== National Aids Program (NAP) ===
The NAP is the official governmental body responsible for HIV/AIDS prevention.&lt;ref name="usaid22" /&gt; Its goal is to maintain the low prevalence of HIV/AIDS and improve health care services for those infected or affected by the disease. It performs blood screening, provides free [[Antiretroviral Therapy|Antiretorviral Therapy]] [[Antiretroviral|(ART)]] for those infected, encourages HIV testing, and provides support for those with HIV and their families.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The organization also aims to raise awareness about HIV in the general public and among high risk groups, using mass media as one of the means of doing so.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Additionally, they established anonymous hotlines, distributed condoms, and partnered with various [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organizations (NGOs)]]. The NAP formed the National Strategic Plan (2006–2010) to build on the successes of the previous five-year plan. It was designed to maintain the low prevalence of HIV/AIDS and improve health care services for those infected or affected by the disease.&lt;ref name="usaid22" /&gt; The plan's objectives included strengthening HIV/AIDS surveillance, expanding HIV/AIDS response, increasing awareness among the population, developing outreach and educational programs, growing the testing and counseling services, and improving the overall quality of life for people infected and affected by HIV.&lt;ref name="usaid22" /&gt;

===Government actions and results ===
Since 2005, the [[Government of Egypt]] has become more actively involved in the fight against HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="usaid22" /&gt; The government established nine mobile VCCT (Voluntary Confidential Counseling and Testing) centers and 14 fixed centers around the country.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; With the help of Family Health International, it also conducted trainings for [[physician]]s and nurses on clinical management and [[nursing]] care, created self-care guides in Arabic&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and started to promote the use [[antiretroviral therapy]]. Additionally, the Ministry of Health has also been fighting the issue of lack of adherence to drug treatments by many HIV positive citizens. It started implementing case management programs that follow up with patients and provide psychological counseling and resources that will help the patients adhere to their specific treatments and deal with the stigma of the disease.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; These programs were established in numerous health centers that are associated with the Ministry of Health.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

In 2006, [[Cairo]] was the site of a three-day, UNAIDS-supported workshop on HIV/AIDS and drug use in the region. The workshop included representatives of governments, [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs), and research programs from the [[Arab]] countries as well as from [[Afghanistan]], [[Iran]], and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="usaid22" /&gt; The Egyptian government worked with [[UNICEF]] to help prevent HIV/AIDS among youth and worked with the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] to address HIV/AIDS among IDUs.&lt;ref name="usaid22" /&gt; Moreover, the Egyptian government, led by former First Lady [[Suzanne Mubarak]], started a campaign to educate the public about HIV as a way to fight the spread of disease&lt;ref&gt;Pasquini, E.

Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search.proquest.com/docview/218786153?accountid=15172&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The government has worked to integrate HIV/AIDS into preparatory and secondary school curriculums.

=== Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria ===
In March 2008, Egypt negotiated a six-round grant with the [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria|Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] with the goal of "Reinforcing HIV/AIDS Prevention and Care Efforts in Egypt." &lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theglobalfund.org/en/portfolio/country/grant/?k=0aa7cc8a-e296-4fa4-b5ac-7a2e0c139ef1&amp;grant=EGY-608-G03-H|title=EGY-608-G03-H Grant|last=The Global Fund|first=|date=|website=www.theglobalfund.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grant start date was April 1, 2008 and the end date was December 31, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theglobalfund.org/en/portfolio/country/grant/?k=0aa7cc8a-e296-4fa4-b5ac-7a2e0c139ef1&amp;grant=EGY-608-G03-H|title=Egypt- EGY-608-G03-H: Grant Performance Report|last=|first=|date=|website=The Global Fund|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout its duration, the project collected a cumulative amount of approximately $9 million.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Some of the objectives of the project included: establishing a strong and supportive environment for the treatment and care of HIV, improving the current surveillance and monitoring data, preventing HIV transmission, including mother-to-child, reducing risk among the most impacted groups, and increasing access to treatment and other services for all people living with HIV in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theglobalfund.org/en/portfolio/country/grant/?k=0aa7cc8a-e296-4fa4-b5ac-7a2e0c139ef1&amp;grant=EGY-608-G03-H|title=Program Grant Agreement Number EGY-608-G03-H Implementation Letter Number 1|last=|first=|date=|website=The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military government treatment research ===
On Feb. 22, 2014, a government-sponsored public service announcement aired on an official Egyptian T.V. channel where Major General Ibrahim Abdul Atti, the chief of the Egyptian Army Medical Team, announced the military's new medical devices, C-FAST and CCD for the treatment of AIDS.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/07/egypt-cure-hepatitis-c-hiv-military-politicized-medical.html|title=Egypt’s doctors take on army over HIV ‘cure’ controversy|last=Hidji|first=Ahmed|date=2016-07-26|work=Al-Monitor|access-date=2017-11-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcer made ambitious claims about the devices that the [[Egyptian Military|Egyptian military]] scientists were working on. He proclaimed that the C-FAST was a breakthrough minimally invasive device that could detect and diagnose diseases, such as HIV, with electromagnetism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/27/world/africa/egypt-aids-cure-claim/index.html|title=Egyptian army's AIDS-cure claim gets harsh criticism - CNN|last=CNN|first=By  Salma Abdelaziz and Saad Abedine,|work=CNN|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the announcement stated that another device called CCD was currently being tested in trials but had high success rates of curing AIDS through blood purification. A short video accompanied the announcement showing the supposed devices at work. However, even though many major networks and media in Egypt ran with this news, there was no scientific basis to these claims made by the military scientists. In June 2014, the military personnel went back on their claims, stating that these devices needed additional testing because their original trials did not have large enough sample sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/28/egypt-military-aids-cure-device-backtrack|title=Egyptian military backtracks on Aids cure claims|last=Loveluck|first=Louisa|date=2014-06-28|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now, further research is still being conducted by military medical personnel into the treatment of HIV and the widely spread [[Hepatitis C]] virus.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7805">Compared with other neighbouring countries, [[Guyana]] ranks poorly in regard to basic health indicators. Basic health services in the interior are primitive to non-existent, and some procedures are not available at all.  Although Guyana's health profile falls short in comparison with many of its Caribbean neighbours, there has been remarkable progress since 1988, and the Ministry of Health is working to upgrade conditions, procedures, and facilities. Many Guyanese seek medical care in the United States, [[Trinidad and Tobago]] or [[Cuba]].

== Health infrastructure ==

The delivery of health services is provided at five different levels in the public sector:
* Level I: Local Health Posts (166 in total) that provide preventive and simple [[curative care]] for common [[disease]]s and attempt to promote proper health practices. [[Community health worker]]s staff them.
* Level II: Health Centres (109 in total) that provide preventive and rehabilitative care and promotion activities. These are ideally staffed with a medical extension worker or public health nurse, along with a [[nursing assistant]], a dental nurse and a midwife.
* Level III: Nineteen District Hospitals (with 473 beds) that provide basic in-patient and outpatient care (although more the latter than the former) and selected diagnostic services. They are also meant to be equipped to provide simple radiological and laboratory services, and to be capable of gynecology, providing preventive and curative dental care. They are designed to serve geographical areas with populations of 10,000 or more.
* Level IV: Four Regional Hospitals (with 620 beds) that provide emergency services, routine surgery and [[obstetrical]] and gynecological care, dental services, diagnostic services and specialist services in general medicine and pediatrics. They are designed to include the necessary support for this level of medical service in terms of laboratory and X-ray facilities, pharmacies and dietetic expertise. These hospitals are located in Regions 2, 3, 6 and 10.
* Level V: The National Referral Hospital (937 beds) in Georgetown that provides a wider range of diagnostic and specialist services, on both an in-patient and out-patient basis; the Psychiatric Hospital in [[Canje]]; and the Geriatric Hospital in Georgetown. There is also one children’s rehabilitation centre.

This system is structured so that its proper functioning depends intimately on a process of referrals. Except for serious emergencies, patients are to be seen first at the lower levels, and those with problems that cannot be treated at those levels are referred to higher levels in the system. However, in practice, many patients by-pass the lower levels.

The health sector is currently unable to offer certain sophisticated tertiary services and specialised medical services, the technology for which is unaffordable in Guyana, or for which the required medical specialists are not available. Even with substantial improvements in the health sector, the need for overseas treatment for some services might remain. The Ministry of Health provides financial assistance to patients requiring such treatment, priority being given to children whose condition can be rehabilitated with significant improvements to their quality of life.

There are 10 hospitals belonging to the private sector and to public corporations, plus diagnostic facilities, clinics and dispensaries in those sectors. These ten hospitals provide for 548 beds. Eighteen clinics and dispensaries are owned by GUYSUCO.

The Ministry of Health and Labour is responsible for the funding of the National Referral Hospital in Georgetown, which has recently been made a public corporation managed by an independent Board. [[East Berbice-Corentyne|Region 6]] is responsible for the management of the National Psychiatric Hospital. The Geriatric Hospital, previously administered by the Ministry of Labour, became the responsibility of the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security of Guyana in December 1997.

The [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] Consular Information Sheet warns "Medical care is available for minor medical conditions. Emergency care and hospitalization for major medical illnesses or surgery is limited, because of a lack of appropriately trained specialists, below standard in-hospital care, and poor sanitation. Ambulance service is substandard and may not routinely be available for emergencies." Many Guyanese seek medical care in the United States, [[Trinidad and Tobago]] or [[Cuba]].

== Health status ==

=== Life expectancy ===
In 2012, life expectancy at birth was estimated at 71.0 years.

=== Diseases ===
The leading causes of mortality for all age groups are cerebrovascular diseases (11.6%); ischemic heart disease (9.9%); immunity disorders (7.1%); diseases of the respiratory system (6.8%); diseases of pulmonary circulation and other forms of heart disease (6.6%); endocrine and metabolic diseases (5.5%); diseases of other parts of the Digestive System (5.2%); violence (5.1%); certain condition originating in the prenatal period (4.3%); and hypertensive diseases (3.9%). The ten leading causes of morbidity for all age groups are, in decreasing order: malaria; acute respiratory infections; symptoms, signs and ill defined or unknown conditions; hypertension; accident and injuries; acute diarrhoeal disease; diabetes mellitus; worm infestation; rheumatic arthritis; and mental and nervous disorders.

This morbidity profile indicates that it can be improved substantially through enhanced preventive health care, better education on health issues, more widespread access to potable water and sanitation services, and increased access to basic health care of good quality. A number of non-governmental organisations, including Health and Educational Relief for Guyana (HERG, INC) and Guyana Medical Relief (GMR, INC) are currently working to address these issues by improving healthcare access and educational infrastructure.

=== Suicide ===
[[Suicide]] is a leading cause of death in Guyana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/131056/1/9789241564779_eng.pdf?ua=1&amp;ua=1 WHO Report 2014 Preventing suicide: A global imperative.]&lt;/ref&gt; Guyana suffers from the highest [[suicide rate]] of any South American country. In 2008 it was estimated that at least 200&amp;nbsp;people commit suicide each year in Guyana, or 27.2&amp;nbsp;people for each 100,000&amp;nbsp;people each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2008/01/080110_nibjan10.shtml |title=BBCCaribbean.com |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2008-01-11 |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Murder ===
In 2008 Guyana had a murder rate of 26 per 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stabroeknews.com/letters/guyana%E2%80%99s-murder-rate-is-up-this-year/ |title=Guyana’s murder rate is up this year |publisher=Stabroeknews.com |date=2008-08-01 |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maternal and child health care===
The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Guyana is 260. This is compared with 143.1 in 2008 and 162.3 in 1990. The under 5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births is 36 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5's mortality is 60.  In Guyana the number of midwives per 1,000 live births is unavailable and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women is 1 in 150.&lt;ref name="SOWMY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sowmy/report/home.html|title=The State of World's Midwifery 2011: Delivering Health, Saving Lives|publisher=United Nations Population Fund|accessdate=1 August 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819090550/http://www.unfpa.org/sowmy/report/home.html|archivedate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death rate==
Death rate for Malaysia in 2016 was 4.9 per 1,000 people. Death rate of Malaysia has decreased from 8 per 1,000 people in 1967 to 4.9 per 1,000 people in 2016. &lt;ref&gt;https://knoema.com/atlas/Malaysia/Death-rate&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 162,201 deaths were recorded in the year 2016 and there is an increase of 4.1% as compared to 2015 with 155,786.

==Epidemiology==
Leptospirosis is a water contract disease caused by bacteria of the genus Leptospirabacterial. It is a disease that affects both humans and animals. The number of leptospirosis cases had steadily increased from 2011 (2,268 cases with 55 death) to 2015 (8,291 cases with 78 death) and 5,284 cases with 52 death in 2016.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017/07/12/leptospirosis-rears-its-ugly-head-expert-cleanliness-is-only-way-to-keep-rat-urine-disease-at-bay/&lt;/ref&gt; Leptospirosis can have important health impact and is a burden to the nation if not well controlled. Addressing leptospisoris includes maintain a clean environment and by not swimming or wading in water that might be contaminated with animal urine, or eliminating contact with potentially infected animals.

The largest contribution to mortality is non communicable disease. 40 million people each year die from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and accounted for 70% of global deaths annually.  From 1996 to 2011 the proportion of the population who are obese increased from 5% to 15%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Britnell|first1=Mark|title=In Search of the Perfect Health System|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave|location=London|isbn=978-1-137-49661-4|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, National Health Morbidity Survey (NHMS) revealed that the overall prevalence of two out of three major risk factors contributing to non-communicable disease (NCD) remained high for diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia. The prevalence of hypertension has shown a decreased 2.4% in the study done nationwide. The current prevalence (Year 2017) of hypertension in Malaysia is 30.3%, which is lower than the prevalence in 2011 and 2006 with 32.7% and 32.2% respectively.The prevalence of hypercholesterolemia has increased to 47.7% in 2017 from 32.6% in 2011 &lt;ref&gt;Institute for Public Health.

Risk factors for noncommunicable diseases include tobacco use, reduced physical activity, alcohol abuse and unhealthy food consumption. Risk factors for noncommunicable diseases include tobacco use, reduced physical activity, alcohol abuse and unhealthy food consumption. Managing the risk factor as well as early detection of disease is the key to combat non communicable diseases besides than policy coherence across all levels of government at the national and international level.

Prevalence of HIV as a share of population aged 15-49 in 2016, was 0.4 % and has fallen gradually from 0.7% in 1997 to 0.4% in 2016.
Incidence of tuberculosis fluctuated substantially in recent years through 2002 - 2016 and in the year 2016, incidence of tuberculosis for Malaysia was 92 cases per 100,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;https://knoema.com/atlas/Malaysia/Incidence-of-tuberculosis&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vaccination==
In [[Malaysia]], mass vaccination is practised in public schools. The vaccines may be administered by a [[school nurse]] or a team of other medical staff from outside the school. All the children in a given school year are vaccinated as a [[Cohort (statistics)|cohort]]. For example, children may receive the [[oral polio vaccine]] in Year One of [[primary school]] (about six or seven years of age), the [[Bacillus Calmette Guérin|BCG]] in Year Six, and the [[MMR vaccine|MMR]] in Form Three of [[secondary school]]. Therefore, most people have received their core vaccines by the time they finish secondary school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report

'''Imago relationship therapy''' is a form of [[marriage therapy]] that takes a relationship approach rather than an individual approach to problem solving in a marriage {{citation needed|date=July 2015}}. It was codeveloped by Dr. [[Harville Hendrix]] and Dr. [[Helen LaKelly Hunt]], and documented in Hendrix's 1988 book, ''Getting the Love You Want, A Guide for Couples.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why Couples Fight: Harville Hendrix and Helen LaKelly Hunt|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/omega-institute-for-holistic-studies/conscious-relationships_b_1542776.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Seven Questions for Harville Hendrix|url = https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/in-therapy/200902/seven-questions-harville-hendrix|website = Psychology Today|accessdate = 2015-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|page=D1 |newspaper= [[Windsor Star]] (Canada)|date=July 8, 1993|department= Lifestyles|title=Healing a Troubled Marriage: One step at a time: Imago Relationship Therapy bringing couples back from brink |author=Gail Robertson |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Getting the Love You Want: A Guide for Couples|url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Getting_the_Love_You_Want.html?id=gYJvPwAACAAJ|publisher = Schwartz &amp; Wilkinson|date = 1988-01-01|isbn = 9781863370066|language = en|first = Harville|last = Hendrix}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{mcn|date=November 2017}} Hendrix and Hunt selected the word "imago," the Latin word for "image," as a name for the "unconscious image of the opposite sex that you had been forming since birth."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Getting the Love You Want, 20th Anniversary Edition: A Guide for Couples|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=u_sh7yxjIxwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=snippet&amp;q=name&amp;f=false|publisher = Macmillan|date = 2007-12-26|isbn = 9781429923934|language = en|first = Harville Hendrix|last = Ph.D|page = 38}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}} In February 2012, the [[BBC]] aired a Wonderland documentary that included an imago relationship therapy workshop on the cruise ship ''[[MS Golden Iris]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Two Jews on a Cruise, Series 4, Wonderland - BBC Two|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01d0p72|website = BBC|accessdate = 2015-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cruising with Imago|url = http://sitekreator.com/CharlotsImago/cruising-with-imago.html|website = sitekreator.com|accessdate = 2015-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{mcn|date=November 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|page=24 |newspaper= [[Jerusalem Post]] (Israel)|date=March 23, 2012|department= Features|title=Last Night's TV: Two Jews on a Cruise: A Wonderland Film, BBC2 |author=Abigail Klein Leichman |accessdate=October 9, 2012|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/last-nights-tv-two-jews-on-a-cruise-a-wonderland-film-bbc2-7466782.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

==Theory==

Imago therapy focuses on collaboratively healing childhood wounds couples share.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Hendrix and Hunt, the human brain has a compelling non-negotiable drive to restore feelings of aliveness and wholeness with which people came into the world.&lt;ref name="Atria Books"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hendrix|first1=Harville|last2=Hunt|first2=Helen|title=Getting the Love You Want Workbook: The New Couples' Study Guide|date=30 December 2003|publisher=Atria Books|location=New York|isbn=0-7-434-8367-7|pages=1–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}} It is believed by imago therapists that a person's brain constructs an image of characteristics from their primary caretakers including both their best and worst traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Short-Term Couples Therapy: The Imago Model in Action|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bnKAAAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=Luquet,+W.+(1996).+Short-term+couples+therapy:+The+IMAGO+model+in+action&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|publisher = Routledge|date = 2006-11-06|isbn = 9781135925420|language = en|first = Wade|last = Luquet|page = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brain's unconscious drive is to repair damage done in childhood, needs not met, by finding a partner who can give us what our caretakers failed to provide.&lt;ref name="Atria Books"/&gt;  This is why traits of a  future partner often reflect our parents' traits.  Our unconscious drives towards this  to seek healing and to resolve unresolved childhood wounds, in order to grow. In this way, wounds received by a person, from their parents, tend to be re-stimulated by new adult partners and potential partners.  The re-stimulation triggers old, unresolved emotions. Both people in the relationship can learn how to heal one another, and appreciate each other for the person they are--and--it  takes time.  Couples must engage in a specific type of dialogue for Imago therapy to work. The conscious self may not be able to see and understand clearly the reflection of unresolved parental issues in his or her current marriage partner.  Nonetheless, our unconscious connects with this person in its best (unconscious) effort to heal old wounds and allow love into your life again. {{fact|date=May 2017}}

== History ==
In February 1951, the national organization of French [[stomatology]] students invited some of their colleagues from other countries to attend their annual meeting in [[Paris]], France where the Danish, Dutch and Swedish representatives proposed to establish international dental students' organization. Such proposal was unanimously welcomed.

A committee consisting of representatives from Denmark, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom was formed to work out the basic principles on which to build the constitution of the association. This constitution was drafted and the first executive committee was elected; Leslie Sorling from Sweden was elected the first president.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hccm-ifmsa.org/en/iads/|title=HCCM {{!}} IADS History|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Europa World Year Book 2003|last=|first=|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2003|isbn=1-85743-227-4|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Congress ==
Two international meetings take place each year to offer the opportunity for dental students delegates to come together to discuss their current issues and future strategies. One of these two meetings is called the Mid Year Meeting (MYM) and usually takes place by the end of each winter, while the other one is the Annual Congress (AC) which takes place by the end of each summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iads-web.org/programs/meeting/|title=Meetings {{!}} International Association of Dental Students|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Operation MECACAR''' (currently known as MECACAR New Millennium) is a multi-national [[immunization]] program launched in 1995 by the [[World Health Organization]] to coordinate [[polio]] vaccination efforts (currently it is also used to coordinated [[measles]] and [[rubella]] vaccination efforts). The name of the operation was derived from the names of the regions participating in the operation: [[Eastern Mediterranean]], [[Caucasus]], [[Central Asian Republics]] and [[Russia]].&lt;ref name="Poliohistory"&gt;[http://www.polioeradication.org/history.asp Polio eradication history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428220435/http://www.polioeradication.org/history.asp |date=2007-04-28 }} - Last accessed June 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, 18 countries are participating and more than 60 million children have been vaccinated.&lt;ref name="15May2007Pressnote"&gt;[http://www.euro.who.int/PressRoom/pressnotes/20070515_1 Operation MECACAR – New Millennium.

[[World Health Organization]], last accessed July 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
The operation was launched to "''maximize the geographic area covered and the number of children targeted simultaneously for mass vaccination with OPV''".&lt;ref name="Massoral"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/mmwR/preview/mmwrhtml/00036667.htm Mass Vaccination with Oral Poliovirus Vaccine] - CDC, Last accessed June 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It introduced "National Immunization Days", held at the same dates in bordering member countries; and also coordinated the efforts of different laboratories.

==History==
===MECACAR New Millennium===
After [[Europe]] was declared polio-free in 2002, MECACAR's objectives became maintaining polio-free status in the region and also achieve [[measles]] and [[rubella]] elimination.&lt;ref name="VaccinprevMNM"&gt;[http://www.euro.who.int/vaccine/20030724_13 Vaccine-preventable Diseases and Immunization] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070729061315/http://www.euro.who.int/vaccine/20030724_13 |date=2007-07-29 }}. [[World Health Organization]], last accessed July 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
On May 17, 2007, the MECACAR New Millennium declaration was signed. The event took place in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref name="15May2007Pressnote" /&gt;

'''Meldonium''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]; trade name '''Mildronate''', among others) is a limited-market pharmaceutical, developed in 1970 by [[Ivars Kalviņš]] at the [[USSR]] Latvia Institute of Organic Synthesis, and now manufactured by the Latvian pharmaceutical company [[Grindeks]] and several generic manufacturers. It is primarily distributed in Eastern European countries as an anti-[[ischemia]] medication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grindeks.lv/en/for-media/latest-news/Grindeks-meldonium-should-not-be-included-in-the-prohibited-list |title=Grindeks: We Believe that Meldonium Should not be Included in the List of Banned Substances in Sport |publisher=Grindeks |date=9 March 2016 |accessdate=9 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312001639/http://www.grindeks.lv/en/for-media/latest-news/Grindeks-meldonium-should-not-be-included-in-the-prohibited-list |archivedate=12 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1 January 2016, it has been on the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) list of substances banned from use by athletes.&lt;ref name=2016list&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wada-ama.org/en/what-we-do/prohibited-list|title=Prohibited List|date=|work=World Anti-Doping Agency|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are debates over its use as an athletic performance enhancer. Some athletes are known to have been using it before it was banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=All About Meldonium, the Banned Drug Used by Sharapova |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/09/sports/tennis/what-is-meldonium-maria-sharapova.html?_r=0 |accessdate=8 March 2016 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=New York Times |date=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently [[Controlled Substances Act|unscheduled]] in the [[United States of America|US]].

==Medical use==
Meldonium may be used to treat [[coronary artery disease]].&lt;ref name=Sjakste2004Rev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sjakste|first1=N|last2=Gutcaits|first2=A|last3=Kalvinsh|first3=I|title=Mildronate: an antiischemic drug for neurological indications.|journal=CNS Drug Reviews|date=2004|volume=11|issue=2|pages=151–168|pmid=16007237|doi=10.1111/j.1527-3458.2005.tb00267.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dambrova|first1=M|last2=Makrecka-Kuka|first2=M|last3=Vilskersts|first3=R|last4=Makarova|first4=E|last5=Kuka|first5=J|last6=Liepinsh|first6=E|title=Pharmacological effects of meldonium: Biochemical mechanisms and biomarkers of cardiometabolic activity|journal=Pharmacological research|volume=113|issue=Pt B|pages=771–780|date=2 February 2016|pmid=26850121|doi=10.1016/j.phrs.2016.01.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These heart problems may sometimes lead to ischemia, a condition where too little blood flows to the organs in the body, especially the heart. Because this drug is thought to expand the arteries, it helps to increase the blood flow as well as increase the flow of oxygen throughout the body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myocardial-ischemia/basics/definition/con-20035096 Myocardial ischemia]. Mayo Clinic (25 July 2015). Retrieved on 2016-05-28.&lt;/ref&gt;
Meldonium has also been found to induce anticonvulsant and antihypnotic effects involving alpha 2-adrenergic receptors as well as nitric oxide-dependent mechanisms.  This, in summary, shows that meldonium given in acute doses could be beneficial for the treatment of seizures and alcohol intoxication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zvejniece |first1=L |last2=Svalbe |first2=B |last3=Makrecka| first3=M |last4=Liepinsh |first4=E |last5=Kalvinsh |first5=I |last6=Dambrova |first6=M |title=Mildronate exerts acute anticonvulsant and antihypnotic effects| journal=Behavioral Pharmacology |year=2010 |doi=10.1097/FBP.0b013e32833d5a59 |volume=21 |issue=5–6 |pages=548–555 |pmid=20661137}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also used in cases of [[cerebral ischemia]], [[ocular ischemic syndrome]] and other ocular disease caused by disturbed arterial circulation and may also have some effect on decreasing the severity of withdrawal symptoms caused by the cessation of chronic alcohol use.

==Physio-pharmacology==
[[File:Biosynthesis L-carnitine.png|thumb|left|Carnitine synthesis]]

To ensure a continuous guarantee of energy supply, the body oxidises considerable amounts of fat besides glucose. [[Carnitine]] transports activate long-chain fatty acids (FA) from the [[cytosol]] of the cell into the mitochondrion and is therefore essential for fatty acid oxidation (known as [[beta oxidation]]). Carnitine is mainly absorbed from the diet, but can be formed through biosynthesis. To produce carnitine,  [[lysine]] residues are methylated to [[methyllysine|trimethyllysine]]. Four enzymes are involved in the conversion of trimethyllysine and its intermediate forms into the final product of carnitine. The last of these 4 enzymes is  [[gamma-butyrobetaine dioxygenase]] (GBB), which hydroxylates butyrobetaine into carnitine.

The main cardioprotective effects are mediated by the inhibition of the enzyme GBB. By subsequently inhibiting  [[carnitine biosynthesis]], fatty acid transport is reduced and the accumulation of cytotoxic intermediate products of [[beta oxidation|fatty acid beta-oxidation]] in ischemic tissues to produce energy is prevented, therefore blocking this highly oxygen-consuming process.&lt;ref name=Sjakste2004Rev/&gt; Treatment with meldonium therefore shifts the myocardial energy metabolism from fatty acid oxidation to the more favorable oxidation of glucose, or [[glycolysis]], under ischemic conditions. It also reduces the formation of  [[Trimethylamine N-oxide]], a product of carnitine breakdown and implicated in the pathogenesis of [[atherosclerosis]] and [[congestive heart failure]].
[[File:Acyl-CoA from cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix by carnitine.svg|thumb|The carnitine shuttle system. ('''Red''': acyl-CoA, '''Green''': carnitine, '''Red+green''': acylcarnitine, '''CoASH''': coenzyme A, '''CPTI''': carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, '''CPTII''': carnitine palmitoyltransferase II, '''1''': acyl-CoA sintetase, '''2''': translocase, '''A''': outer mitochondrial membrane, '''B''': Intermembrane space, '''C''': inner mitochondrial membrane, '''D''': mitochondrial matrix)]] In fatty acid (FA) metabolism, long chain fatty acids in the cytosol cannot cross the mitochondrial membrane because they are negatively charged. The process in which they move into the mitochondria is called the carnitine shuttle. Long chain FA are first activated via [[esterification]] with [[coenzyme A]] to produce a [[Acyl-CoA|fatty acid-coA]] complex which can then cross the external mitochondrial border. The co-A is then exchanged with carnitine (via the enzyme [[carnitine palmitoyltransferase I]]) to produce a fatty acid-carnitine complex. This complex is then transported through the inner mitochondrial membrane via a transporter protein called [[carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase]]. Once inside, carnitine is liberated (catalysed by the enzyme [[carnitine palmitoyltransferase II]]) and transported back outside so the process can occur again. Acylcarnitines like [[palmitoylcarnitine]] are produced as intermediate products of the carnitine shuttle.

In the mitochondria, the effects of the carnitine shuttle are reduced by meldonium, which competitively inhibits the [[SLC22A5]] transporter. This results in reduced transportation and metabolism of long-chain fatty acids in the mitochondria (this burden is shifted more to [[peroxisomes]]). The final effect is a decreased risk of mitochondrial injury from fatty acid oxidation and a reduction of the production of acylcarnitines, which has been implicated in the development of [[insulin resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schooneman MG, van Groen T, Vaz FM, Houten SM, Soeters MR | title = Acylcarnitines: Reflecting or Inflicting Insulin Resistance? | journal = Diabetes | volume = 62 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–8 |date=January 2013 | pmid = 23258903 | pmc = 3526046 | doi= 10.2337/db12-0466}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lippi G, Mattiuzzi C | title = Misuse of the metabolic modulator meldonium in sports | journal = Journal of Sport and Health Science | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 1–3 |date=June 2016 | pmid =  | doi= 10.1016/j.jshs.2016.06.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its inhibitory effects on L-carnitine biosynthesis and its subsequent glycolytic effects as well as reduced acylcarnitine production, meldonium has been indicated for use in diabetic patients. In an animal models&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Liepinsh E, Vilskersts R, Zvejniece L, Svalbe B, Skapare E, Kuka J, Cirule H, Grinberga S, Kalvinsh I, Dambrova M | title = Protective effects of mildronate in an experimental model of type 2 diabetes in Goto-Kakizaki rats | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 157 | issue = 8 | pages = 1549–1556 |date=August 2009 | pmid = 19594753 | pmc = 2765322 | doi= 10.1111/j.1476-5381.2009.00319.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a very small clinical trial,&lt;ref name="Statsenko2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Statsenko ME, Belenkova SV, Sporova OE, Shilina NN |title=[The use of mildronate in combined therapy of postinfarction chronic heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus] |journal=Klin Med (Mosk) |date=2007 |volume=85 |issue=7 |pages=39-42 |pmid=17882808 |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; meldonium has been shown to reduce blood glucose concentrations, exhibit cardioprotective effects and prevent or reduce the severity of diabetic complications. Long term treatment has also been shown to attenuate the development of [[atherosclerosis]] in the heart.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Its vasodilatory effects are stipulated to be due to the stimulation of the production of [[nitric oxide]] in the [[endothelium|vascular endothelium]]. It is hypothesized that meldonium may increase the formation of the gamma-butyrobetaine esters, potent [[Parasympathomimetic drug|parasympathomimetics]] and may activate the [[Endothelial NOS|eNOS enzyme]] which causes nitric oxide production via stimulation of the [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3|M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor]] or specific gamma-butyrobetaine ester receptors.&lt;ref name=Sjakste2004Rev/&gt;

Meldonium is believed to continually train the heart pharmacologically, even without physical activity, inducing preparation of cellular metabolism and membrane structures (specifically in myocardial [[mitochondria]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kuka J, Vilskersts R, Cirule H, Makrecka M, Pugovics O, Kalvinsh I, Dambrova M, Liepinsh E | title = The cardioprotective effect of mildronate is diminished after co-treatment with L-carnitine | journal = Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology and therapeutics | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 215–222 |date=June 2012 | pmid = 21903968 | doi=10.1177/1074248411419502}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to survive ischemic stress conditions. This is done by adapting myocardial cells to lower fatty acid inflow and by activating glycolysis; the heart eventually begins using glycolysis instead of beta oxidation during real life ischaemic conditions. This reduces [[oxidative stress]] on cells, formation of cytotoxic products of fatty acid oxidation and subsequent cellular damage. This has made meldonium a possible pharmacological agent for [[ischemic preconditioning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dambrova, Liepinsh E, Kalvinsh I | title = Mildronate: cardioprotective action through carnitine-lowering effect | journal = Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 275–279 |date=August 2002 | pmid = 12242052 | doi=10.1016/s1050-1738(02)00175-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

How the central nervous system effects of meldonium is brought about is unclear. Studies have shown that meldonium increases cognition and mental performance in animal models of [[Alzheimer's disease]] by reducing [[amyloid beta]] deposition in the [[hippocampus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beitnere U, van Groen T, Kumar A, Jansone B, Klusa V, Kadish I | title = Mildronate improves cognition and reduces amyloid-β pathology in transgenic Alzheimer's disease mice | journal = Journal of Neuroscience Research | volume = 92 | issue = 3 | pages = 338–346 |date=March 2014 | pmid = 24273007 | pmc = 5586698 | doi= 10.1002/jnr.23315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doping===
Meldonium was added to the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) list of banned substances effective 1 January 2016 because of evidence of its use by athletes with the intention of enhancing performance.&lt;ref name=2016list/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2016 Prohibited List, Summary of Major Modifications and Explanatory Notes |publisher=World Anti-Doping Agency |date=16 September 2015 |url=https://wada-main-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/resources/files/wada-2016-prohibited-list-summary-of-modifications-en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was on the 2015 WADA's list of drugs to be monitored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2015/09/30/wada-updates-list-of-banned-substances/73073450/|title=WADA updates list of banned substances|agency=Associated Press|date=30 September 2015|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wada-main-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/resources/files/wada-2015-monitoring-program-en.pdf|title=WADA 2015 Monitoring Program|date=1 January 2016|website=wada-ama.org|publisher=WADA}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alarmingly high prevalence of meldonium use by athletes in sport was demonstrated by the laboratory findings at the [[2015 European Games|Baku 2015 European Games]]. 13 medallists or competition winners were taking meldonium at the time of the Baku Games. Meldonium use was detected in athletes competing in 15 of the 21 sports during the Games. Most of the athletes taking meldonium withheld the information of their use from anti-doping authorities by not declaring it on their doping control forms as they should have. Only 23 of the 662 (3.5%) athletes tested declared the personal use of meldonium. However, 66 of the total 762 (8.7%) of athlete urine samples analysed during the Games and during pre-competition tested positive for meldonium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.bmj.com/bjsm/2016/03/08/meldonium-use-by-athletes-at-the-baku-2015-european-games-adding-data-to-ms-maria-sharapovas-failed-drug-test-case/|title=Meldonium use by athletes at the Baku 2015 European Games|publisher=bmj.com|accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WADA classes the drug as a metabolic modulator, just as it does [[insulin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prohibited List |date=January 2016 |publisher=World Anti-Doping Agency |url=https://wada-main-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/resources/files/wada-2016-prohibited-list-en.pdf |at=S4:5.3 |accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metabolic modulators are classified as S4 substances according to the WADA banned substances list.  These substances have the ability to modify how some hormones accelerate or slow down different enzymatic reactions in the body.  In this way, these modulators can block the body's conversion of testosterone into oestrogen, which is necessary for females.  Based on the overall effects these drugs have, they have been banned since 2001 from men's competitions and 2005 for women's.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antidoping.ch/en/prevention/mobile-learning-programs/mobile-lesson-substances-and-methods/s4-hormone-and-metabolic S4 Hormone and metabolic modulators]. Antidoping Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt;
On April 13, 2016 it was reported that WADA had issued updated guidelines allowing less than 1 microgram per milliliter of meldonium for tests done before March 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/14/sports/wada-meldonium-drug-testing.html|title=WADA Opens a Door for Athletes Who Tested Positive for Meldonium|first=Patrick|last=Reevell|date=13 April 2016|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agency cited that "preliminary tests showed that it could take weeks or months for the drug to leave the body".

====Affected athletes====
On March 7, 2016, former world number one tennis player [[Maria Sharapova]] announced that she had failed a drug test in Australia due to the detection of meldonium. She said that she had been taking the drug for ten years for various health issues, and had not noticed that it had been banned.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/07/tennis/maria-sharapova-tennis-injuries/index.html|title=Maria Sharapova admits to failing drug test, will be provisionally banned|website=CNN|date=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/sport/tennis/maria-sharapovas-meldonium-drug-used-to-fight-heart-problems-diabetes-and-wild-boar-impotence/news-story/c3c51ff9c3ff0d622f669dffb5c030dd|title=Sharapova drug scandal: what is Meldonium|date=7 March 2016|work=NewsComAu|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 8, 2016, she was suspended from playing tennis for two years by the [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Maria Sharapova failed drugs test at Australian Open|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/35750285|publisher=BBC|date=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ITF prov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itftennis.com/news/225826.aspx |title=Press release: Tennis Anti-Doping Programme statement regarding Maria Sharapova |publisher=International Tennis Federation |date=7 March 2016 |accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Maria Sharapova banned for two years for failed drugs test but will appeal|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/36482288|publisher=BBC|date=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier the same year  (March 7), Russian ice dancer [[Ekaterina Bobrova]] announced that she had also tested positive for meldonium at the [[2016 European Figure Skating Championships]]. Bobrova said she was shocked about the test result, because she had been made aware of meldonium's addition to the banned list, and had been careful to avoid products containing banned substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigstory.ap.org/article/a1371b6e5c614b56906436c2c20bda18/top-russian-ice-dancer-bobrova-fails-doping-test-report|title=Top Russian ice dancer Bobrova fails doping test – report|website=The Big Story|language=en-US|date=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, Russian professional boxer [[Alexander Povetkin]]—a former two-time [[World Boxing Association]] (WBA) Heavyweight Champion—tested positive for meldonium.  This was discovered just a week prior to his mandatory title match against [[World Boxing Council]] (WBC) Heavyweight Champion, [[Deontay Wilder]].  As a result, the match—scheduled to take place in Povetkin's native Russia—was postponed indefinitely by the WBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rafael|first1=Dan|title=Wilder-Povetkin called off after failed drug test|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/15551134/wbc-postpones-deontay-wilder-alexander-povetkin-fight-failed-drug-test|date=16 May 2016|agency=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other athletes who are provisionally banned for using meldonium include Ethiopian-Swedish middle-distance runner [[Abeba Aregawi]],&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dn.se/sport/preparatet-som-kan-falla-aregawi/ |title=Preparatet som kan fälla Aregawi |newspaper=Dagens Nyheter |department=Sport |language=sv |date=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethiopian long-distance runner [[Endeshaw Negesse]],&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1034922/ethiopian-tokyo-marathon-winner-negesse-reportedly-fails-drugs-test-for-meldonium|title=Ethiopian Tokyo Marathon winner Negesse reportedly fails drugs test for Meldonium|website=insidethegames|author=Butler, Nick |date=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian cyclist [[Eduard Vorganov]],&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite web|author=Rogers, Neal|url=http://cyclingtips.com/2016/02/second-positive-test-in-12-months-could-see-katusha-sidelined-up-to-45-days/|title=Second positive test in 12 months could see Katusha sidelined up to 45 days|website=cyclingtips.com|date=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ukrainian biathletes [[Olga Abramova]]&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/062af7b9a5f34171b574caec7421811e/ukrainian-biathlete-abramova-suspended-doping-case|title=Ukrainian biathlete Abramova suspended in doping case |website=insidethegames|date=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Artem Tyshchenko]].&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1034784/tyshchenko-named-as-second-ukrainian-biathlete-to-fail-doping-test-in-2016|title=Tyshchenko named as second Ukrainian biathlete to fail doping test in 2016|website=insidethegames|date=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ice Hockey Federation of Russia]] replaced the [[Russia men's national under-18 ice hockey team]] with an under-17 team for the [[2016 IIHF World U18 Championships]] after players on the original roster tested positive for meldonium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/russia-replaces-entire-junior-hockey-team-after-drug-scandal-212538497.html|title=Russia replaces entire junior hockey team after drug scandal|website=Yahoo!|date=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 170 failed tests by athletes were identified in a relatively brief period after the ban on meldonium was imposed on January 1, 2016, almost all of which were from Eastern European countries, with much smaller numbers since.&lt;ref name="EllingworthQ&amp;A"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ellingworth|first1=James|title=Q&amp;A: Meldonium, the drug in Russia’s Olympic doping case|url=https://www.apnews.com/84eea1b3c54b4b89ab8934a6bda7357b/Q&amp;A:-Meldonium,-the-drug-in-Russia's-Olympic-doping-case|accessdate=19 February 2018|work=[[The Associated Press]]|date=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the early cases were dropped when athletes claimed that they had ceased use in 2015, with the claim often consistent with the low concentrations of the drug in their samples.&lt;ref name="EllingworthQ&amp;A"/&gt; Notable athletes with positive samples include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cambers |first=Simon |title=Why was Maria Sharapova taking meldonium?

In addition it was reported that five Georgian wrestlers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eldia.es/agencias/8542488-LUCHA-GEORGIA-DOPAJE-Seis-luchadores-georgianos-dan-positivo-Meldonium|title=Seis luchadores georgianos dan positivo por Meldonium|date=15 February 2015|publisher=El Dia.es|language=Spanish|accessdate=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a German wrestler had tested positive for the drug although no further names were released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=11606863|title=A German wrestler tests positive for meldonium|date=17 March 2016|publisher=nzherald.co.nz|accessdate=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 March 2016 the [[Fédération Internationale de Sambo]] confirmed that four wrestlers under their governance (two from Russia and two from other countries) had recorded positive tests for the drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tass.ru/en/sport/865236?utm|title=Two Russian Sambo wrestlers test positive for banned meldonium drug – executive|work=TASS|date=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Debates====
A December 2015 study in the journal ''[[Drug Testing and Analysis]]'' argued that meldonium "demonstrates an increase in endurance performance of athletes, improved rehabilitation after exercise, protection against stress, and enhanced activations of central nervous system (CNS) functions".&lt;ref name=GorgensTesting2015&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dta.1788/full |last=Görgens |first=Christian |last2=Guddat |first2=Sven |last3=Dib |first3=Josef |last4=Geyer |first4=Hans |last5=Schänzer |first5=Wilhelm |last6=Thevis |first6=Mario |title=Mildronate (Meldonium) in professional sports – monitoring doping control urine samples using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography – high resolution/high accuracy mass spectrometry |journal=Drug Testing and Analysis |volume=7 |issue=11–12 |pages=973–979 |doi=10.1002/dta.1788 |pmid=25847280 |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation needed|date=October 2016}} However the study itself presents no evidence for this claim, and focuses instead on describing two approaches for the reliable identification of meldonium. It is also believed that meldonium is opposing to steroids in the sense that instead of making the athlete emotionally unstable and readily irritable, it keeps them in an elevated state of mind and keeps their emotions in a happier state.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}  When referring to central nervous system enhancements, it better activates the neurons in the CNS.  This improves the messaging system throughout the body and,  therefore, can decrease (improve) reaction time for an athlete.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The manufacturer, [[Grindeks]], said in a statement that it did not believe meldonium’s use should be banned for athletes. It said the drug worked mainly by reducing damage to cells that can be caused by certain byproducts of carnitine. Meldonium “is used to prevent death of ischemic cells and not to increase performance of normal cells,” the statement said. “Meldonium cannot improve athletic performance, but it can stop tissue damage in the case of [[ischemia]],” which is lack of blood flow to an area of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/10/sports/tennis/meldonium-russian-athletes-maria-sharapova-doping.html|title=Meldonium Ban Hits Russian Athletes Hard|publisher=Nytimes.com|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drug was invented in the mid-1970s at the [[Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis|Institute of Organic Synthesis]] of the [[Latvian SSR Academy of Sciences]] by [[Ivars Kalviņš]].&lt;ref name="Ivars"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osi.lv/en/scientific-council/|title=Scientific Board|date=|work=osi.lv|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ivars Kalvins: A broad range of medicines based on natural compounds, spearheading a new generation of drugs |url=http://advertisementfeature.cnn.com/epo/nominees/2015/ivars-kalvinsh/ |publisher=European Patent Office |work=European Inventor Awards. Candidates in the Lifetime Achievement category.|accessdate=9 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WiredHistory" /&gt; Kalviņš criticized the ban, saying that WADA had not presented scientific proof that the drug can be used for doping. According to him, meldonium does not enhance athletic performance in any way, and was rather used by athletes to prevent damage to the heart and muscles caused by lack of oxygen during high-intensity exercise. He contended that not allowing athletes to take care of their health was a violation of their human rights, and that the decision aimed to remove Eastern European athletes from competitions and his drug from the pharmaceutical market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Изобретатель мельдония назвал две причины решения WADA |language=Russian |trans-title=Meldonium inventor named two reasons for WADA decision |location=Russia |url=http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=2728666 |date= |work=vesti.ru |accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.delfi.lv/sports/news/other_kinds/other/mildronata-raditajs-ivars-kalvins-meldonija-pielidzinasana-dopingam-ir-cilvektiesibu-parkapums.d?id=47157855 |title=Mildronāta radītājs Ivars Kalviņš: meldonija pielīdzināšana dopingam ir cilvēktiesību pārkāpums |last=Kristīna |first=Hudenko |date=8 March 2016 |publisher=Delfi |language=Latvian |accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liene Kozlovska, the head of the anti-doping department of the Latvian sports medicine center, rejected claims that the ban is in violation of athletes' rights, saying that meldonium is dangerous in high doses, and should only be used under medical supervision to treat genuine health conditions. She also speculated that Russian athletes may not have received adequate warnings that the drug was banned – due to the suspension of the [[Russian Anti-Doping Agency]] in late 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.diena.lv/latvija/zinas/antidopinga-eksperte-mildronats-ieklauts-aizliegto-vielu-saraksta-14132894?from-full |title=Antidopinga eksperte: Mildronāts iekļauts aizliegto vielu sarakstā |date=8 March 2016 |publisher=Diena |language=Latvian |accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Forbes]] reported that anesthesiology professor Michael Joyner, at the [[Mayo Clinic]] in [[Rochester, Minnesota]], who studies how humans respond to physical and mental stress during exercise and other activities, told them that "Evidence is lacking for many compounds believed to enhance athletic performance. Its use has a sort of urban legend element and there is not much out there that is clearly that effective. I would be shocked if this stuff [meldonium] had an effect greater than caffeine or creatine (a natural substance that, when taken as a supplement, is thought to enhance muscle mass).”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ritarubin/2016/03/09/study-finds-widespread-use-of-sharapovas-drug-despite-little-evidence-that-it-boosts-performance/#3727b1fd39a7 |title=Banned drug Sharapova took is widely used, study shows, despite little evidence that it boosts performance |author=Rita Rubin |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford Vox, a U.S.-based physician specializing in rehabilitation medicine and a journalist reported "there's not much scientific support for its use as an athletic enhancer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/11/opinions/maria-sharapova-banned-drug-vox/|title=Sharapova suspension: doping agency's unfair game of 'gotcha'? |publisher=CNN|author=Ford Vox|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Don Catlin]], a long-time anti-doping expert and the scientific director of the Banned Substances Control Group (BSCG) said “There’s really no evidence that there’s any performance enhancement from meldonium – Zero percent.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2016/04/05/meldonium-experts-wada-performance-enhancing-drug/82663156/|title=Experts say there's little evidence meldonium enhances performance|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=April 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Approval status===
Meldonium, which is not approved by the [[FDA]] in the [[United States]], is registered and prescribed in [[Latvia]], [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Belarus]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Moldova]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]].&lt;ref name=GorgensTesting2015/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ritarubin/2016/03/09/study-finds-widespread-use-of-sharapovas-drug-despite-little-evidence-that-it-boosts-performance/#3727b1fd39a7|title=Banned Drug Sharapova Took Is Widely Used, Study Shows, Despite Little Evidence That It Boosts Performance|publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5488">In the [[United States]], the '''National Malaria Eradication Program''' (NMEP) was launched on 1 July 1947. This federal program{{snd}}with state and local participation{{snd}}had succeeded in eradicating [[malaria]] in the United States by 1951.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Horton (editor)|Horton, Richard]] (2011), [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/feb/24/stopping-malaria-wrong-road/  “Stopping Malaria: The Wrong Road”], ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', 24 February issue.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:MalariaMap.jpg|thumb|320px|right|Endemic malaria in the United States, 1934-35.]]

Prior to the establishment of the NMEP, malaria had been [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] across much of the [[United States]]. By the 1930s, it had become concentrated in 13 southeastern states. (For example, in the [[Tennessee River Valley]] it had a prevalence of  about 30% in 1933.)

A national malaria eradication effort was originally proposed by [[Louis Laval Williams]]. The NMEP was directed by the federal Communicable Disease Center (now the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], or CDC&lt;ref&gt;The agency now called the CDC has had a welter of names over the years: Office of National Defense Malaria Control Activities (1942); Office of Malaria Control in War Areas (1942–1946); Communicable Disease Center (1946–1967); National Communicable Disease Center (1967–1970); Center for Disease Control (1970–1980); Centers for Disease Control (1980–1992) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (1992 to present).&lt;/ref&gt;) created in 1946 and based in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. It was a cooperative undertaking by federal, state and local health agencies. The Program had evolved from the [[Office of Malaria Control in War Areas]], which had been created in 1942 to suppress malaria near military bases in the United States during [[World War II]]. The CDC's first director{{snd}}[[Justin M. Andrews]]{{snd}}was also Georgia's chief malariologist.

The new agency was a branch of the [[U.S. Public Health Service]] and Atlanta was chosen as its headquarters because malaria was locally endemic. Offices were located on the sixth floor of the Volunteer Building on [[Peachtree Street]]. With an annual budget of about $1 million, some 59% of its personnel were engaged in [[mosquito]] abatement and habitat control.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/history/index.htm#mcwa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ''The History of Malaria, an Ancient Disease'', Atlanta, GA, 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt; Among its 369 employees, the main jobs at CDC at this time were [[entomology]] and [[engineering]]. In 1946, there were only seven medical officers on duty and an early organization chart was drawn, somewhat fancifully, in the shape of a mosquito.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/about/history/ourstory.htm|title=Our History - Our Story|date=April 26, 2013|website=About CDC|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619045405/http://www.cdc.gov/about/history/ourstory.htm|archivedate=19 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the CDC's first few years, more than 6,500,000 homes were sprayed with the [[insecticide]] [[DDT]]. DDT was applied to the interior surfaces of rural homes or entire premises in counties where malaria was reported to have been prevalent in recent years. In addition, wetland drainage, removal of mosquito breeding sites, and DDT spraying (occasionally from aircraft) were all pursued. In 1947, some 15,000 malaria cases were reported. By the end of 1949, over 4,650,000 housespray applications had been made and the United States was declared free of malaria as a significant public health problem. By 1950, only 2,000 cases were reported. By 1951, malaria was considered eliminated altogether from the country and the CDC gradually withdrew from active participation in the operational phases of the program, shifting its interest to surveillance. In 1952, CDC participation in eradication operations ceased altogether.

A major international effort along the lines of the NMEP{{snd}}the [[Global Malaria Eradication Programme]] (1955–1969), administered by the [[World Health Organization]]{{snd}}was unsuccessful.

'''Parenteral nutrition''' ('''PN''') is the feeding of specialist nutritional products to a person [[intravenous]]ly, bypassing the usual process of [[eating]] and [[digestion]]. The products are made by specialist pharmaceutical compounding companies and is considered to be the highest risk pharmaceutical preparation available as the products cannot undergo any form of terminal sterilization. The person receives highly complex nutritional formulae that contain nutrients such as [[glucose]], [[salts]], [[amino acid]]s, [[lipid]]s and added [[vitamin]]s and [[dietary mineral]]s. It is called '''total parenteral nutrition''' ('''TPN''') or '''total nutrient admixture''' ('''TNA''') when no significant nutrition is obtained by other routes, and '''partial parenteral nutrition''' ('''PPN''') when nutrition is also partially [[gastrointestinal tract|enteric]]. It may be called '''peripheral parenteral nutrition''' ('''PPN''') when administered through [[Peripherally inserted central catheter|vein access in a limb]] rather than through a [[central venous catheter|central vein]] as '''central venous nutrition''' ('''CVN''').

==Medical uses==
Total [[wikt:parenteral|parenteral]] nutrition (TPN) is provided when the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]] is nonfunctional because of an interruption in its continuity (it is blocked, or has a leak - a [[fistula]]) or because its absorptive capacity is impaired.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kozier, B., &amp; Erb, G., &amp; Berman, A.J., &amp; Burke, K., &amp; Bouchal, S. R., &amp; Hirst, S. P.. (2004). Fundamentals of Nursing: The Nature of Nursing Practice in Canada. Canadian Edition. Prentice Hall Health: Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used for [[coma]]tose patients, although [[feeding tube|enteral feeding]] is usually preferable, and less prone to complications. Parenteral nutrition is used to prevent malnutrition in patients who are unable to obtain adequate nutrients by oral or [[enteral]] routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?ss=15&amp;doc_id=3056&amp;nbr=2282 |title=American Gastroenterological Association medical position statement: parenteral nutrition |access-date=2008-01-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730131405/http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?ss=15&amp;doc_id=3056&amp;nbr=2282 |archive-date=2007-07-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition recommends waiting until hospital day number seven.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

* Short bowel syndrome
* Small bowel obstruction
* Active gastrointestinal bleeding
* Pseudo-obstruction with complete intolerance to food
* High-output (defined as &gt; 500ml/day) enteric-cutaneous fistulas (unless a feeding tube can be passed distal to the fistula)

===Gastrointestinal disorders===
TPN may be the only feasible option for providing nutrition to patients who do not have a functioning gastrointestinal tract or who have disorders requiring complete bowel rest, including [[bowel obstruction]],&lt;ref name="Merck Manual"&gt;The Merck Manual, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[short bowel syndrome]],&lt;ref name="Merck Manual" /&gt; [[gastroschisis]],&lt;ref name="Merck Manual" /&gt; prolonged [[diarrhea]] regardless of its cause,&lt;ref name="Merck Manual" /&gt; very severe [[Crohn's disease]]&lt;ref name="Merck Manual" /&gt; or [[ulcerative colitis]],&lt;ref name="Merck Manual" /&gt; and certain pediatric GI disorders including congenital GI anomalies and [[necrotizing enterocolitis]].&lt;ref name="Heird"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heird|first=WC|author2=Gomez, MR|title=Total parenteral nutrition in necrotizing enterocolitis.|journal=Clinics in Perinatology|date=June 1994|volume=21|issue=2|pages=389–409|pmid=8070233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In cancer===
The benefit of TPN to [[cancer]] patients is largely debated, and studies to date have generally showed minimal long term benefit.

==Duration==
Short-term PN may be used if a person's digestive system has shut down (for instance by [[peritonitis]]), and they are at a low enough weight to cause concerns about nutrition during an extended hospital stay. Long-term PN is occasionally used to treat people suffering the extended consequences of an accident, surgery, or digestive disorder. PN has extended the life of children born with nonexistent or severely deformed organs.

===Living with TPN===
Approximately 40,000 people use TPN at home in the United States, and because TPN requires anywhere from 10–16 hours to be administered, daily life can be affected.&lt;ref name= "Yaworski"&gt;{{cite web|last=Yaworski|first=J.A.|title=Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.chp.edu/CHP/faq+about+tpn+intestine|publisher=Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although daily lifestyle can be changed, most patients agree that these changes are better than staying at the hospital.&lt;ref name= "Daisy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Living with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) at home|url=http://www.gosh.nhs.uk/medical-conditions/search-for-medical-conditions/costello-syndrome/living-with-total-parenteral-nutrition-tpn-at-home/|publisher=Great Ormund Street Hospital for Children|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many different types of pumps exist to limit the time the patient is “hooked-up”. Usually a backpack pump is used, allowing for mobility. The time required to be connected to the IV is dependent on the situation of each patient; some require once a day, or five days a week.&lt;ref name= "Yaworski" /&gt;

It is important for patients to avoid as much TPN related change as possible in their lifestyles. This allows for the best possible mental health situation; constantly being held down can lead to resentment and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. [[Physical activity]] is also highly encouraged, but patients must avoid contact sports (equipment damage) and swimming (infection). Many [[teens]] find it difficult to live with TPN due to issues regarding [[body image]] and not being able to participate in activities and events.&lt;ref name= "Yaworski" /&gt;

==Complications==
TPN fully bypasses the GI tract and normal methods of nutrient absorption. Possible complications, which may be significant, are listed below. Other than those listed below, other common complications of TPN include hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, hypercapnia, decreased copper and zinc levels, elevated prothrombin time (if associated with liver injury), hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and decreased gastrointestinal motility.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Infection===
TPN requires a chronic IV access for the solution to run through, and the most common complication is infection of this catheter. Infection is a common cause of death in these patients, with a mortality rate of approximately 15% per infection, and death usually results from [[septic shock]].&lt;ref name=Deshpande&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deshpande|first=KS|title=Total parenteral nutrition and infections associated with use of central venous catheters.|journal=American Journal of Critical Care|date=July 2003|volume=12|issue=4|pages=326–7, 380|pmid=12882062|url=http://ajcc.aacnjournals.org/content/12/4/326.full}}&lt;/ref&gt; When using central venous access, the subclavian (or axillary) vein is preferred due to its ease of access and lowest infectious complications compared to the jugular and femoral vein insertions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Blood clots===
Chronic IV access leaves a foreign body in the vascular system, and blood clots on this IV line are common.&lt;ref name=Mollitt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mollitt|first=DL|author2=Golladay ES.|title=Complications of TPN catheter-induced vena caval thrombosis in children less than one year of age|journal=Journal of Pediatric Surgery|date=August 1983|volume=18|issue=4|pages=462–7|pmid=6413671|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022346883802012|doi=10.1016/S0022-3468(83)80201-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Death can result from [[pulmonary embolism]] wherein a clot that starts on the IV line breaks off and travels to the lungs, blocking blood flow.&lt;ref name=Mailloux&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mailloux|first=RJ|author2=DeLegge, MH |author3=Kirby, DF |title=Pulmonary embolism as a complication of long-term total parenteral nutrition|journal=JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition|date=Nov–Dec 1993|volume=17|issue=6|pages=578–82|pmid=8301814|doi=10.1177/0148607193017006578}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Periportal hepatosteatosis intermed mag.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] of [[liver lobule|periportal]] [[fatty liver]] as may arise due to '''TPN'''. [[Trichrome stain]].]]

Patients on TPN who have such clots occluding their catheter may receive a [[thrombolytic]] flush to dissolve the clots and prevent further complications.

===Fatty liver and liver failure===
Fatty liver is usually a more long term complication of TPN, though over a long enough course it is fairly common. The pathogenesis is due to using linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid component of soybean oil) as a major source of calories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Evaluation of OMEGAVEN 10%® (n-3 EFA Lipid Emulsion) in Home Parenteral Nutrition-associated Liver Disease (MEGANORM)|url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01284049|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Piper|first=SN|author2=Rohm KD|title=Hepatocellular integrity after parenteral nutrition: comparison of a fish-oil-containing lipid emulsion with an olive-soybean oil-based lipid emulsion|journal=Eur J Anaesthesiol.|date=Dec 2009|pmid=19916246|doi=10.1097/EJA.0b013e32832e08e0|volume=26|issue=12|pages=1076–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; TPN-associated liver disease strikes up to 50% of patients within 5–7 years, correlated with a mortality rate of 2–50%. Onset of this liver disease is the major complication that leads TPN patients to requiring an [[intestine transplantation|intestinal transplant]].&lt;ref name="Garg et al., 2011"&gt;Garg, M. Jones, R. M., Vaughan, R. B., Testro, A. G. (2011). Intestinal transplantation: Current status and future directions. Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, 26, 1221-1228&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lipid emulsion|Intralipid]] ([[Fresenius (company)|Fresenius-Kabi]]), the US standard lipid emulsion for TPN nutrition, contains a 7:1 ratio of n-6/n-3 ratio of [[Polyunsaturated fat|polyunsaturated fatty acids]] (PUFA). By contrast, [[Omegaven]] has a 1:8 ratio and showed promise in multiple clinical studies. Therefore n-3-rich fat may alter the course of parenteral nutrition associated liver disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumar Jain|first=Ajay|last2=Teckman|first2=Jeffrey H.|date=2014|title=Newly Identified Mechanisms of Total Parenteral Nutrition Related Liver Injury|url=http://www.hindawi.com/archive/2014/621380/|journal=Advances in Hepatology|language=en|volume=2014|pages=1–7|doi=10.1155/2014/621380|issn=2356-6744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hunger===
Because patients are being fed intravenously, the subject does not physically eat, resulting in intense [[hunger pang]]s (pains). The brain uses signals from the [[mouth]] ([[taste]] and [[Olfaction|smell]]), the [[stomach]]/[[gastrointestinal tract]] (fullness) and [[blood]] ([[nutrient]] levels) to determine conscious feelings of [[Hunger (motivational state)|hunger]].&lt;ref name= "Hunger WIKI"&gt;[[Hunger (motivational state)]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In cases of TPN, the taste, smell and physical fullness requirements are not met, and so the patient experiences hunger, despite the fact that the body is being fully nourished.

Patients who eat food despite the inability can experience a wide range of complications.&lt;ref name= "bowel obst"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bowel Obstruction|url=http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/conditions/bowel-obstruction|publisher=Women's Health|accessdate=30 March 2014|date=2013-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cholecystitis ===
Total parenteral nutrition increases the risk of acute [[cholecystitis]]&lt;ref name=Tucker&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tucker|first=RA|title=Acalculous cholecystitis and fever related to total parenteral nutrition|pmid=6437783|year=1984|last2=Jenkins|first2=HL|volume=18|issue=11|pages=897–9|journal=Drug Intelligence &amp; Clinical Pharmacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  due to complete disuse of gastrointestinal tract, which may result in bile stasis in the [[gallbladder]]. Other potential [[hepatobiliary dysfunction]]s include [[steatosis]],&lt;ref name=Wang&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=H|author2=Khaoustov, VI |author3=Krishnan, B |author4=Cai, W |author5=Stoll, B |author6=Burrin, DG |author7= Yoffe, B |title=Total parenteral nutrition induces liver steatosis and apoptosis in neonatal piglets|journal=The Journal of Nutrition|date=October 2006|volume=136|issue=10|pages=2547–52|pmid=16988124|url=http://jn.nutrition.org/content/136/10/2547.short|doi=10.1093/jn/136.10.2547}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[steatohepatitis]], [[cholestasis]], and [[cholelithiasis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Quigley EM, Marsh MN, Shaffer JL, Markin RS |title=Hepatobiliary complications of total parenteral nutrition |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=104 |issue=1 |pages=286–301 |date=January 1993 |pmid=8419252 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six percent of patients on TPN longer than 3 weeks and 100% of patients on TPN longer than 13 weeks develop [[biliary sludge]].  The formation of sludge is the result of stasis due to lack of enteric stimulation and is not due to changes in bile composition. Gallbladder sludge disappears after 4 weeks of normal oral diet.  Administration of exogenous [[cholecystokinin|cholecystokinin (CCK)]] or stimulation of endogenous CCK by periodic pulse of large amounts of amino acids have been shown to help prevent sludge formation. These therapies are not routinely recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcm.edu/gastro/VGICC/GI-M0054/09-DISC.HTM |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910002340/http://www.bcm.edu/gastro/VGICC/GI-M0054/09-DISC.HTM |archivedate=2006-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such complications are suggested to be the main reason for mortality in people requiring long-term total parenteral nutrition, such as in [[short bowel syndrome]].&lt;ref name=Vanderhoof&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vanderhoof JA, Langnas AN |title=Short-bowel syndrome in children and adults |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=113 |issue=5 |pages=1767–78 |year=1997 |pmid=9352883 |doi=10.1053/gast.1997.v113.pm9352883}}&lt;/ref&gt; In newborn infants with short bowel syndrome with less than 10% of expected intestinal length, thereby being dependent upon total parenteral nutrition, 5 year survival is approximately 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Spencer AU, Neaga A, West B, etal |title=Pediatric short bowel syndrome: redefining predictors of success |journal=Ann.

=== Other complications ===
Other complications are either related to catheter insertion, or metabolic, including [[refeeding syndrome]]. Catheter complications include [[pneumothorax]], accidental arterial puncture, and catheter-related sepsis. The complication rate at the time of insertion should be less than 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McGee DC, Gould MK |title=Preventing complications of central venous catheterization |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=348 |issue=12
|pages=1123–33 |date=March 2003 |pmid=12646670 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra011883 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&amp;pmid=12646670&amp;promo=ONFLNS19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catheter-related infections may be minimised by appropriate choice of catheter and insertion technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Horattas MC, Trupiano J, Hopkins S, Pasini D, Martino C, Murty A |title=Changing concepts in long-term central venous access: catheter selection and cost savings |journal=Am J Infect Control |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=32–40 |date=February 2001 |pmid=11172316 |doi=10.1067/mic.2001.111536
|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metabolic complications include the refeeding syndrome characterised by [[hypokalemia]], [[hypophosphatemia]] and [[hypomagnesemia]]. [[Hyperglycemia]] is common at the start of therapy, but can be treated with insulin added to the TPN solution. Hypoglycaemia is likely to occur with abrupt cessation of TPN. Liver dysfunction can be limited to a reversible cholestatic jaundice and to fatty infiltration (demonstrated by elevated transaminases). Severe hepatic dysfunction is a rare complication.&lt;ref&gt;G. Edward Morgan, Jr., Maged S. Mikhail, Michael J. MurrayClinical Anesthesiology, 4th Edition&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, patients receiving TPN have a higher rate of infectious complications. This can be related to hyperglycemia.&lt;ref name=McCowen&gt;{{cite journal|title=Hypocaloric total parenteral nutrition: effectiveness in prevention of hyperglycemia and infectious complications--a randomized clinical trial|pmid=11098961|url=http://pdfs.journals.lww.com/ccmjournal/2000/11000/00007.pdf|year=2000|last1=McCowen|first1=KC|last2=Friel|first2=C|last3=Sternberg|first3=J|last4=Chan|first4=S|last5=Forse|first5=RA|last6=Burke|first6=PA|last7=Bistrian|first7=BR|volume=28|issue=11|pages=3606–11|journal=Critical Care Medicine|doi=10.1097/00003246-200011000-00007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pregnancy ===
[[Pregnancy]] can cause major complications when trying to properly dose the nutrient mixture. Because all of the baby’s nourishment comes from the mother’s blood stream, the doctor must properly calculate the dosage of nutrients to meet both recipients’ needs and have them in usable forms. Incorrect dosage can lead to many adverse, hard-to-guess effects, such as [[death]], and varying degrees of [[deformity|deformation]] or other [[Intellectual disability|developmental problems]].&lt;ref name= "Landon"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Landon|first1=MB|last2=Gabbe|first2=SG|last3=Mullen|first3=JL|title=Total parenteral nutrition during pregnancy.|journal=Clin Perinatol|year=1986|volume=13|issue=1|pages=57–72|pmid=3082563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is recommended that parenteral nutrition administration begin after a period of natural nutrition so doctors can properly calculate the nutritional needs of the [[fetus]]. Otherwise, it should only be administered by a team of highly skilled doctors who can accurately assess the fetus’ needs.&lt;ref name= "Landon" /&gt;

==Total parenteral nutrition==
[[File:LipidHPN.jpg|thumb|right | Prescription lipid parenteral nutrition formulation]]
Solutions for total parenteral nutrition may be customized to individual patient requirements, or standardized solutions may be used. The use of standardized parenteral nutrition solutions is cost effective and may provide better control of serum electrolytes.&lt;ref name=Hayes&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hayes|first=EM|author2=Cohen KR|author3=Pinard BE|author4=Lauletta J|author5=Ruggiero R.|title=Standardized versusindividually customized parenteral nutrition solutions: a comparison ofserum electrolyte values|journal=P&amp;T|year=2000|volume=25|issue=2|pages=78–80, 83, 87|url=http://www.ptcommunity.com/ptjournal/fulltext/25/2/2502078.pdf|access-date=2010-09-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715130250/http://www.ptcommunity.com/ptjournal/fulltext/25/2/2502078.pdf|archive-date=2011-07-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Ideally each patient is assessed individually before commencing on parenteral nutrition, and a team consisting of specialised doctors, nurses, [[clinical pharmacist]]s and [[Registered Dietitian|registered dietitian]]s evaluate the patient's individual data and decide what PN formula to use and at what infusion rate.

For energy only, [[intravenous sugar solution]]s with [[dextrose]] or [[glucose]] are generally used. This is not considered to be parenteral nutrition as it does not prevent malnutrition when used on its own. Standardized solutions may also differ between developers. Following are some examples of what compositions they may have. The solution for normal patients may be given both centrally and peripherally.

==Components==

===Prepared solutions===
Prepared solutions generally consist of [[water]] and electrolytes; [[glucose]], [[amino acid]]s, and lipids; essential [[vitamin]]s, minerals and trace elements are added or given separately. Previously lipid emulsions were given separately but it is becoming more common for a "three-in-one" solution of glucose, proteins, and lipids to be administered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Didier ME, Fischer S, Maki DG |title=Total nutrient admixtures appear safer than lipid emulsion alone as regards microbial contamination: growth properties of microbial pathogens at room temperature |journal=JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=291–6 |year=1998 |pmid=9739032

===Added components===
Individual nutrient components may be added to more precisely adjust the body contents of it. That individual nutrient may, if possible, be infused individually, or it may be injected into a bag of nutrient solution or intravenous fluids ([[volume expander]] solution) that is given to the patient.

Administration of individual components may be more hazardous than administration of pre-mixed solutions such as those used in total parenteral nutrition, because the latter are generally already balanced in regard to e.g. osmolarity and ability to infuse peripherally.

===Emulsifier===
Only a limited number of emulsifiers are commonly regarded as safe to use for parenteral administration, of which the most important is [[lecithin]].{{medcn|date=May 2013}} Lecithin can be biodegraded and metabolized, since it is an integral part of biological membranes, making it virtually non-toxic. Other emulsifiers can only be excreted via the kidneys,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} creating a toxic load. The emulsifier of choice for most fat emulsions used for parenteral nutrition is a highly purified egg lecithin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.chemie.uni-erlangen.de/services/dissonline/data/dissertation/Christoph_Wabel/html/Chapter1.html Lecithin - An Emulsifier for Parenteral Use: TORVS Research Team]&lt;/ref&gt; due to its low toxicity and complete integration with cell membranes.

Use of egg-derived emulsifiers is not recommended for people with an egg allergy due to the risk of reaction. In situations where there is no suitable emulsifying agent for a person at risk of developing essential fatty acid deficiency, cooking oils may be spread upon large portions of available skin for supplementation by transdermal absorption.

Another type of fat emulsion [[Omegaven]] is being used experimentally within the US primarily in the pediatric population. It is made of fish oil instead of the egg based formulas more widely in use. Research has shown use of Omegaven may reverse and prevent liver disease and cholestasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=21448206 | doi=10.1038/jp.2010.182 | volume=31 Suppl 1 | title=The use of Omegaven in treating parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease | year=2011 | journal=J Perinatol | pages=S57–60| last1=Park | first1=K.

'''Perineology''' is a speciality dealing with the functional troubles of the three axes ([[Urology|urological]], [[Gynaecology|gynaecological]] and [[Coloproctology|coloproctological]]) of the female [[perineum]]. The perineologist takes a [[Holistic health|holistic approach]], using defect-specific and mini-invasive treatments.

== First citation of the word Perineology ==

"The word perineology represents a [[neologism]]. Many specialties have split into subspecialties. From [[surgery]] and from [[gastroenterology]] derived [[proctology]]. The latter needs now an evolution, mainly for its functional aspects. The proctologist cannot restrict his competence to the posterior perineum, as the urologist and the gynaecologist, when evaluating the [[pelvic floor]] and its diseases, must take into account the posterior compartment. A unitary view of the pelvic organs function then creates a sort of superspecialty that must open new spaces to the research insuring to the patients more rational solutions. Perineology is then a medical branch of which we probably will hear talking more and more in the future." (''G. Dodi, RICP 1990; 9: 113''

{{infobox plutonium}}
'''Plutonium''' is a [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Pu''' and [[atomic number]] 94. It is an [[actinide]] [[metal]] of silvery-gray appearance that [[tarnish]]es when exposed to air, and forms a dull coating when [[plutonium(IV) oxide|oxidized]]. The element normally exhibits six [[allotrope]]s and four [[oxidation state]]s. It reacts with [[carbon]], [[halogen]]s, [[nitrogen]], [[silicon]] and [[hydrogen]]. When exposed to moist air, it forms [[oxide]]s and [[hydride]]s that can expand the sample up to 70% in volume, which in turn flake off as a powder that is [[pyrophoricity|pyrophoric]]. It is radioactive and can accumulate in [[bone]]s, which makes the handling of plutonium dangerous.

Plutonium was first produced and isolated on December 14, 1940, by a deuteron bombardment of [[uranium-238]] in the 1.5 metre (60&amp;nbsp;in) [[cyclotron]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. First [[neptunium-238]] ([[half-life]] 2.1 days) was synthesized which subsequently beta-decayed to form this new element with atomic number 94 and atomic weight 238 (half-life 87.7 years). Since [[uranium]] had been named after the planet [[Uranus]] and [[neptunium]] after the planet [[Neptune]], element 94 was named after [[Pluto]], which at the time was considered to be a planet as well. Wartime secrecy prevented its discovery being announced until 1948. Plutonium is the element with the highest atomic number to occur in nature. Trace quantities arise in natural uranium-238 deposits when U-238 captures neutrons emitted by decay of other U-238 atoms. Plutonium is much more common on Earth since 1945 as a product of [[neutron capture]] and [[beta decay]], where some of the [[neutron]]s released by the [[nuclear fission|fission]] process convert uranium-238 nuclei into plutonium-239.

Both [[plutonium-239]] and [[plutonium-241]] are [[fissile]], meaning that they can sustain a [[nuclear chain reaction]], leading to applications in [[nuclear weapon]]s and [[nuclear reactor]]s. [[Plutonium-240]] exhibits a high rate of [[spontaneous fission]], raising the [[neutron flux]] of any sample containing it. The presence of plutonium-240 limits a plutonium sample's usability for weapons or its quality as reactor fuel, and the percentage of plutonium-240 determines its [[reactor-grade plutonium|grade]] ([[weapons-grade]], fuel-grade, or reactor-grade). [[Plutonium-238]] has a half-life of 88 years and emits [[alpha particle]]s. It is a heat source in [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s, which are used to power some [[spacecraft]]. Plutonium isotopes are expensive and inconvenient to separate, so particular isotopes are usually manufactured in specialized reactors.

Producing plutonium in useful quantities for the first time was a major part of the [[Manhattan Project]] during [[World War II]] that developed the first atomic bombs. The [[Fat Man]] bombs used in the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]] [[nuclear test]] in July 1945, and in the [[bombing of Nagasaki]] in August 1945, had plutonium [[pit (nuclear weapon)|cores]]. [[Human radiation experiments]] studying plutonium were conducted without [[informed consent]], and several [[criticality accident]]s, some lethal, occurred after the war. Disposal of [[nuclear waste|plutonium waste]] from [[nuclear power plant]]s and [[nuclear disarmament|dismantled nuclear weapons]] built during the [[Cold War]] is a [[nuclear proliferation|nuclear-proliferation]] and environmental concern. Other sources of [[plutonium in the environment]] are [[nuclear fallout|fallout]] from numerous above-ground nuclear tests, now [[Partial Test Ban Treaty|banned]].

==Characteristics==
===Physical properties===
Plutonium, like most metals, has a bright silvery appearance at first, much like [[nickel]], but it [[plutonium(IV) oxide|oxidizes]] very quickly to a dull gray, although yellow and olive green are also reported.&lt;ref name = "WISER"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; At room temperature plutonium is in its [[allotropes of plutonium|α (''alpha'') form]]. This, the most common structural form of the element ([[allotrope]]), is about as hard and brittle as [[cast iron#Grey cast iron|gray cast iron]] unless it is [[alloy]]ed with other metals to make it soft and ductile. Unlike most metals, it is not a good conductor of [[thermal conductivity|heat]] or [[electrical conductivity|electricity]]. It has a low [[melting point]] (640&amp;nbsp;°C) and an unusually high [[boiling point]] (3,228&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name = "WISER"/&gt;

[[Alpha decay]], the release of a high-energy [[helium]] nucleus, is the most common form of [[radioactive decay]] for plutonium.&lt;ref name = "NNDC"/&gt; A 5&amp;nbsp;kg mass of &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu contains about {{val|12.5|e=24}} atoms. With a half-life of 24,100 years, about {{val|11.5|e=12}} of its atoms decay each second by emitting a 5.157&amp;nbsp;[[MeV]] alpha particle. This amounts to 9.68 watts of power. Heat produced by the deceleration of these alpha particles makes it warm to the touch.&lt;ref name = "Heiserman1992"&gt;{{harvnb|Heiserman|1992|p=338}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Rhodes|1986|pp=659–660}} [[Leona Marshall]]: "When you hold a lump of it in your hand, it feels warm, like a live rabbit"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Resistivity]] is a measure of how strongly a material opposes the flow of [[electric current]]. The resistivity of plutonium at room temperature is very high for a metal, and it gets even higher with lower temperatures, which is unusual for metals.&lt;ref name = "Miner1968p544"/&gt; This trend continues down to 100&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]], below which resistivity rapidly decreases for fresh samples.&lt;ref name = "Miner1968p544"/&gt; Resistivity then begins to increase with time at around 20&amp;nbsp;K due to radiation damage, with the rate dictated by the isotopic composition of the sample.&lt;ref name = "Miner1968p544"/&gt;

Because of self-irradiation, a sample of plutonium fatigues throughout its crystal structure, meaning the ordered arrangement of its atoms becomes disrupted by radiation with time.&lt;ref name = "HeckerPlutonium" /&gt; Self-irradiation can also lead to [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] which counteracts some of the fatigue effects as temperature increases above 100&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;ref&gt;

Unlike most materials, plutonium increases in density when it melts, by 2.5%, but the liquid metal exhibits a linear decrease in density with temperature.&lt;ref name="Miner1968p544"&gt;{{harvnb|Miner|1968|p = 544}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the melting point, the liquid plutonium has very high [[viscosity]] and [[surface tension]] compared to other metals.&lt;ref name = "HeckerPlutonium"/&gt;

===Allotropes===

This makes plutonium very sensitive to changes in temperature, pressure, or chemistry, and allows for dramatic volume changes following [[phase transition]]s from one allotropic form to another.&lt;ref name = "HeckerPlutonium"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The densities of the different allotropes vary from 16.00&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to 19.86&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="CRC2006p4-27" /&gt;

The presence of these many allotropes makes machining plutonium very difficult, as it changes state very readily. For example, the α form exists at room temperature in unalloyed plutonium. It has machining characteristics similar to [[cast iron]] but changes to the plastic and malleable β (''beta'') form at slightly higher temperatures.&lt;ref name = "Miner1968p542"/&gt; The reasons for the complicated phase diagram are not entirely understood. The α form has a low-symmetry [[monoclinic crystal system|monoclinic]] structure, hence its brittleness, strength, compressibility, and poor thermal conductivity.&lt;ref name = "Baker1983"/&gt;

Plutonium in the δ (''delta'') form normally exists in the 310&amp;nbsp;°C to 452&amp;nbsp;°C range but is stable at room temperature when alloyed with a small percentage of [[gallium]], [[aluminium]], or [[cerium]], enhancing workability and allowing it to be [[welding|welded]].&lt;ref name = "Miner1968p542"/&gt; The δ form has more typical metallic character, and is roughly as strong and malleable as aluminium.&lt;ref name = "Baker1983"/&gt; In fission weapons, the explosive [[shock wave]]s used to compress a plutonium core will also cause a transition from the usual δ phase plutonium to the denser α form, significantly helping to achieve [[supercriticality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/intro/pu-phase.htm|title=Plutonium Crystal Phase Transitions|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ε phase, the highest temperature solid allotrope, exhibits anomalously high atomic [[self-diffusion]] compared to other elements.&lt;ref name = "HeckerPlutonium"/&gt;

===Nuclear fission===

Plutonium is a radioactive [[actinide]] metal whose [[isotope]], [[plutonium-239]], is one of the three primary [[fissile]] isotopes ([[uranium-233]] and [[uranium-235]] are the other two); [[plutonium-241]] is also highly fissile. To be considered fissile, an isotope's [[atomic nucleus]] must be able to break apart or [[nuclear fission|fission]] when struck by a [[neutron temperature|slow moving neutron]] and to release enough additional neutrons to sustain the [[nuclear chain reaction]] by splitting further nuclei.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

|accessdate=February 5, 2015
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pure plutonium-239 may have a [[four factor formula|multiplication factor]] (k&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;) larger than one, which means that if the metal is present in sufficient quantity and with an appropriate geometry (e.g., a sphere of sufficient size), it can form a [[critical mass]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Asimov|1988|p=905}}&lt;/ref&gt; During fission, a fraction of the [[nuclear binding energy]], which holds a nucleus together, is released as a large amount of electromagnetic and kinetic energy (much of the latter being quickly converted to thermal energy). Fission of a kilogram of plutonium-239 can produce an explosion equivalent to {{convert|21,000|tonTNT|lk=on}}. It is this energy that makes plutonium-239 useful in [[nuclear weapon]]s and [[nuclear reactor|reactors]].&lt;ref name = "Heiserman1992"/&gt;

The presence of the isotope [[plutonium-240]] in a sample limits its nuclear bomb potential, as plutonium-240 has a relatively high [[spontaneous fission]] rate (~440 fissions per second per gram—over 1,000 neutrons per second per gram),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Samuel |last=Glasstone |first2=Leslie M. |last2=Redman |url=http://www.doeal.gov/opa/docs/RR00171.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827082245/http://www.doeal.gov/opa/docs/RR00171.pdf |archivedate=August 27, 2009 |title=An Introduction to Nuclear Weapons |publisher=Atomic Energy Commission Division of Military Applications |id=WASH-1038 |date=June 1972 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; raising the background neutron levels and thus increasing the risk of [[fizzle (nuclear test)|predetonation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gosling|1999|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plutonium is identified as either [[weapons-grade]], fuel-grade, or reactor-grade based on the percentage of plutonium-240 that it contains. Weapons-grade plutonium contains less than 7% plutonium-240. [[reactor-grade plutonium|Fuel-grade plutonium]] contains from 7% to less than 19%, and power reactor-grade contains 19% or more plutonium-240. [[plutonium-239#Supergrade plutonium|Supergrade plutonium]], with less than 4% of plutonium-240, is used in [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] weapons stored in proximity to ship and submarine crews, due to its lower radioactivity.&lt;ref&gt;

The primary decay modes of isotopes with mass numbers lower than the most stable isotope, plutonium-244, are spontaneous fission and [[alpha emission]], mostly forming uranium (92 [[proton]]s) and [[neptunium]] (93 protons) isotopes as [[decay product]]s (neglecting the wide range of daughter nuclei created by fission processes). The primary decay mode for isotopes with mass numbers higher than plutonium-244 is [[beta emission]], mostly forming [[americium]] (95 protons) isotopes as decay products. Plutonium-241 is the [[parent isotope]] of the [[neptunium decay series]], decaying to americium-241 via beta emission.&lt;ref name = "NNDC"/&gt;&lt;ref name=p340&gt;{{harvnb|Heiserman|1992|p=340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plutonium-238 and 239 are the most widely synthesized isotopes.&lt;ref name = "Heiserman1992"/&gt; Plutonium-239 is synthesized via the following reaction using uranium (U) and neutrons (n) via beta decay (β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) with neptunium (Np) as an intermediate:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=J.

Neutrons from the fission of uranium-235 are [[neutron capture|captured]] by uranium-238 nuclei to form uranium-239; a [[beta decay]] converts a neutron into a proton to form neptunium-239 (half-life 2.36&amp;nbsp;days) and another beta decay forms plutonium-239.&lt;ref name = "Greenwood1997p1259"&gt;{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p = 1259}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Egon Bretscher]] working on the British [[Tube Alloys]] project predicted this reaction theoretically in 1940.{{sfn|Clark|1961|pp=124–125}}

Plutonium-238 is synthesized by bombarding uranium-238 with [[deuteron]]s (D, the nuclei of heavy [[hydrogen]]) in the following reaction:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Glenn T.|last=Seaborg|author2=McMillan, E. |author3=Kennedy, J.

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In this process, a deuteron hitting uranium-238 produces two neutrons and neptunium-238, which spontaneously decays by emitting negative beta particles to form plutonium-238.{{sfn|Bernstein|2007|pp=76–77}}

===Decay heat and fission properties===
Plutonium isotopes undergo radioactive decay, which produces [[decay heat]]. Different isotopes produce different amounts of heat per mass. The decay heat is usually listed as watt/kilogram, or milliwatt/gram. In larger pieces of plutonium (e.g. a weapon pit) and inadequate heat removal the resulting self-heating may be significant. All isotopes produce weak [[gamma radiation]] on decay.

Metallic plutonium is produced by reacting [[plutonium tetrafluoride]] with [[barium]], [[calcium]] or [[lithium]] at 1200&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Eagleson|1994|p=840}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is attacked by [[acid]]s, [[oxygen]], and steam but not by [[alkalis]] and dissolves easily in concentrated [[hydrochloric acid|hydrochloric]], [[hydroiodic acid|hydroiodic]] and [[perchloric acid]]s.&lt;ref name = "Miner1968p545"&gt;{{harvnb|Miner|1968|p = 545}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molten metal must be kept in a [[vacuum]] or an [[inert atmosphere]] to avoid reaction with air.&lt;ref name = "Miner1968p542"&gt;{{harvnb|Miner|1968|p = 542}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 135&amp;nbsp;°C the metal will ignite in air and will explode if placed in [[carbon tetrachloride]].&lt;ref name = "Emsley2001"/&gt;

Plutonium is a reactive metal. In moist air or moist [[argon]], the metal oxidizes rapidly, producing a mixture of [[oxide]]s and [[hydride]]s.&lt;ref name = "WISER"/&gt; If the metal is exposed long enough to a limited amount of water vapor, a powdery surface coating of PuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is formed.&lt;ref name = "WISER"/&gt; Also formed is [[plutonium hydride]] but an excess of water vapor forms only PuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name = "Miner1968p545"/&gt;

Plutonium shows enormous, and reversible, reaction rates with pure hydrogen, forming [[plutonium hydride]].&lt;ref name = "HeckerPlutonium"/&gt; It also reacts readily with oxygen, forming PuO and PuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as well as intermediate oxides; plutonium oxide fills 40% more volume than plutonium metal. The metal reacts with the [[halogen]]s, giving rise to [[chemical compound|compounds]] with the general formula PuX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; where X can be [[plutonium(III) fluoride|F]], [[plutonium(III) chloride|Cl]], Br or I and PuF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is also seen. The following oxyhalides are observed: PuOCl, PuOBr and PuOI. It will react with carbon to form PuC, nitrogen to form PuN and [[silicon]] to form PuSi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name = "CRC2006p4-27"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Emsley2001"/&gt;

Powders of plutonium, its hydrides and certain oxides like Pu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
are [[pyrophoricity|pyrophoric]], meaning they can ignite spontaneously at ambient temperature and are therefore handled in an inert, dry atmosphere of nitrogen or argon. Bulk plutonium ignites only when heated above 400&amp;nbsp;°C. Pu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; spontaneously heats up and transforms into PuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is stable in dry air, but reacts with water vapor when heated.&lt;ref name = "NucSafety"/&gt;

[[Crucible]]s used to contain plutonium need to be able to withstand its strongly [[redox|reducing]] properties. [[Refractory metals]] such as [[tantalum]] and [[tungsten]] along with the more stable oxides, [[boride]]s, [[carbide]]s, [[nitride]]s and [[silicide]]s can tolerate this. Melting in an [[electric arc furnace]] can be used to produce small ingots of the metal without the need for a crucible.&lt;ref name = "Miner1968p542"/&gt;

[[Cerium]] is used as a chemical simulant of plutonium for development of containment, extraction, and other technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Low Temperature Reaction of ReillexTM HPQ and Nitric Acid|author=Crooks, W.

====Electronic structure====
Plutonium is an element in which the [[f shell|5f electrons]] are the transition border between delocalized and localized; it is therefore considered one of the most complex elements.&lt;ref name="physicsworld.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/16443|title=Plutonium is also a superconductor|publisher=PhysicsWeb.org|author=Dumé, Belle|date=November 20, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anomalous behavior of plutonium is caused by its electronic structure. The energy difference between the 6d and 5f subshells is very low. The size of the 5f shell is just enough to allow the electrons to form bonds within the lattice, on the very boundary between localized and bonding behavior. The proximity of energy levels leads to multiple low-energy electron configurations with near equal energy levels. This leads to competing 5f&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 5f&lt;sup&gt;n−1&lt;/sup&gt;6d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; configurations, which causes the complexity of its chemical behavior. The highly directional nature of 5f orbitals is responsible for directional covalent bonds in molecules and complexes of plutonium.&lt;ref name = "HeckerPlutonium"/&gt;

===Alloys===
Plutonium can form alloys and intermediate compounds with most other metals. Exceptions include lithium, [[sodium]], [[potassium]], [[rubidium]] and [[caesium]] of the [[alkali metal]]s; and [[magnesium]], calcium, [[strontium]], and barium of the [[alkaline earth metal]]s; and [[europium]] and [[ytterbium]] of the [[rare earth metal]]s.&lt;ref name = "Miner1968p545"/&gt; Partial exceptions include the refractory metals [[chromium]], [[molybdenum]], [[niobium]], tantalum, and tungsten, which are soluble in liquid plutonium, but insoluble or only slightly soluble in solid plutonium.&lt;ref name = "Miner1968p545"/&gt; Gallium, aluminium, americium, [[scandium]] and cerium can stabilize the δ phase of plutonium for room temperature. [[Silicon]], [[indium]], [[zinc]] and [[zirconium]] allow formation of metastable δ state when rapidly cooled. High amounts of [[hafnium]], [[holmium]] and [[thallium]] also allows some retention of the δ phase at room temperature. Neptunium is the only element that can stabilize the α phase at higher temperatures.&lt;ref name = "HeckerPlutonium"/&gt;

Plutonium alloys can be produced by adding a metal to molten plutonium. If the alloying metal is sufficiently reductive, plutonium can be added in the form of oxides or halides. The δ phase plutonium–gallium and plutonium–aluminium alloys are produced by adding plutonium(III) fluoride to molten gallium or aluminium, which has the advantage of avoiding dealing directly with the highly reactive plutonium metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moody| Hutcheon|Grant|2005|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Plutonium-gallium alloy|Plutonium–gallium]] is used for stabilizing the δ phase of plutonium, avoiding the α-phase and α–δ related issues.

Its [[pyrophoric]] nature and high susceptibility to corrosion to the point of self-igniting or disintegrating after exposure to air require alloying with other components. Addition of aluminium, carbon or copper does not improve disintegration rates markedly, zirconium and iron alloys have better corrosion resistance but they disintegrate in several months in air as well. Addition of titanium and/or zirconium significantly increases the melting point of the alloy.&lt;ref name="Pu1965"&gt;{{harvnb|Kay|1965|p=456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When one of these neutrons strikes the nucleus of another &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U atom, it is absorbed by the atom, which becomes &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;U.

Minute traces of plutonium are usually found in the human body due to the 550 atmospheric and underwater [[nuclear testing|nuclear tests]] that have been carried out, and to a small number of major [[list of civilian nuclear accidents|nuclear accidents]]. Most atmospheric and underwater nuclear testing was stopped by the [[Limited Test Ban Treaty]] in 1963, which was signed and ratified by the United States, the United Kingdom, the [[Soviet Union]], and other nations. Continued atmospheric nuclear weapons testing since 1963 by non-treaty nations included those by [[China]] ([[atomic bomb]] test above the [[Gobi Desert]] in 1964, [[hydrogen bomb]] test in 1967, and follow-on tests), and France (tests as recently as the 1990s). Because it is deliberately manufactured for nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors, plutonium-239 is the most abundant isotope of plutonium by far.&lt;ref name = "Emsley2001"&gt;{{harvnb|Emsley|2001|pp=324–329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chemistry of plutonium was found to resemble uranium after a few months of initial study.&lt;ref name = "Emsley2001"/&gt; Early research was continued at the secret [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] of the [[University of Chicago]]. On August 20, 1942, a trace quantity of this element was isolated and measured for the first time. About 50&amp;nbsp;micrograms of plutonium-239 combined with uranium and fission products was produced and only about 1&amp;nbsp;microgram was isolated.&lt;ref name = "Miner1968p541"&gt;{{harvnb|Miner|1968|p = 541}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "seaborg"&gt;

Using theoretical information garnered from the operation of CP-1, DuPont constructed an air-cooled experimental production reactor, known as X-10, and a pilot chemical separation facility at Oak Ridge. The separation facility, using methods developed by Glenn T. Seaborg and a team of researchers at the Met Lab, removed plutonium from uranium irradiated in the X-10 reactor. Information from CP-1 was also useful to Met Lab scientists designing the water-cooled plutonium production reactors for Hanford. Construction at the site began in mid-1943.&lt;ref name="FAP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://periodic.lanl.gov/94.shtml |title=Periodic Table of Elements |publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory |accessdate=September 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1943 some [[plutonium trifluoride]] was reduced to create the first sample of plutonium metal: a few micrograms of metallic beads.&lt;ref name = "Miner1968p541"/&gt; Enough plutonium was produced to make it the first synthetically made element to be visible with the unaided eye.&lt;ref name = "Miner1968p540"&gt;{{harvnb|Miner|1968|p = 540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nuclear properties of plutonium-239 were also studied; researchers found that when it is hit by a neutron it breaks apart (fissions) by releasing more neutrons and energy. These neutrons can hit other atoms of plutonium-239 and so on in an exponentially fast chain reaction. This can result in an explosion large enough to destroy a city if enough of the isotope is concentrated to form a [[critical mass]].&lt;ref name = "Emsley2001"/&gt;

During the early stages of research, animals were used to study the effects of radioactive substances on health. These studies began in 1944 at the University of California at Berkeley’s Radiation Laboratory and were conducted by Joseph G. Hamilton. Hamilton was looking to answer questions about how plutonium would vary in the body depending on exposure mode (oral ingestion, inhalation, absorption through skin), retention rates, and how plutonium would be fixed in tissues and distributed among the various organs. Hamilton started administering soluble microgram portions of plutonium-239 compounds to rats using different valence states and different methods of introducing the plutonium (oral, intravenous, etc.). Eventually, the lab at Chicago also conducted its own plutonium injection experiments using different animals such as mice, rabbits, fish, and even dogs. The results of the studies at Berkeley and Chicago showed that plutonium's physiological behavior differed significantly from that of radium. The most alarming result was that there was significant deposition of plutonium in the liver and in the "actively metabolizing" portion of bone. Furthermore, the rate of plutonium elimination in the excreta differed between species of animals by as much as a factor of five. Such variation made it extremely difficult to estimate what the rate would be for human beings.&lt;ref name="FAY"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atomicheritage.org/history/plutonium |title=Plutonium |publisher=Atomic Heritage Foundation |accessdate=September 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production during the Manhattan Project===
During World War II the U.S. government established the [[Manhattan Project]], which was tasked with developing an atomic bomb. The three primary research and production sites of the project were the plutonium production facility at what is now the [[Hanford Site]], the [[uranium enrichment]] facilities at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], and the weapons research and design laboratory, now known as [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;

In January 1944, workers laid the foundations for the first chemical separation building, T Plant located in 200-West. Both the T Plant and its sister facility in 200-West, the U Plant, were completed by October. (U Plant was used only for training during the Manhattan Project.) The separation building in 200-East, B Plant, was completed in February 1945. The second facility planned for 200-East was canceled. Nicknamed Queen Marys by the workers who built them, the separation buildings were awesome canyon-like structures 800 feet long, 65 feet wide, and 80 feet high containing forty process pools. The interior had an eerie quality as operators behind seven feet of concrete shielding manipulated remote control equipment by looking through television monitors and periscopes from an upper gallery. Even with massive concrete lids on the process pools, precautions against radiation exposure were necessary and influenced all aspects of plant design.&lt;ref name="FAP" /&gt;

Plutonium-240 has a high spontaneous fission rate, raising the overall background neutron level of the plutonium sample.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp = 235–239}} The original [[gun-type fission weapon|gun-type]] plutonium weapon, code-named "[[Thin Man nuclear bomb|Thin Man]]", had to be abandoned as a result—the increased number of spontaneous neutrons meant that nuclear pre-detonation ([[fizzle (nuclear test)|fizzle]]) was likely.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=240–242}}

The entire plutonium weapon design effort at Los Alamos was soon changed to the more complicated implosion device, code-named "[[Fat Man]]". With an implosion weapon, plutonium is compressed to a high density with [[explosive lens]]es—a technically more daunting task than the simple gun-type design, but necessary to use plutonium for weapons purposes. [[Enriched uranium]], by contrast, can be used with either method.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=240–242}}

By the end of January 1945, the highly purified plutonium underwent further concentration in the completed chemical isolation building, where remaining impurities were removed successfully. Los Alamos received its first plutonium from Hanford on February 2. While it was still by no means clear that enough plutonium could be produced for use in bombs by the war's end, Hanford was by early 1945 in operation. Only two years had passed since Col. [[Franklin Matthias]] first set up his temporary headquarters on the banks of the Columbia River.&lt;ref name="FAP" /&gt;

According to [[Kate Brown (professor)|Kate Brown]], the plutonium production plants at Hanford and [[Mayak]] in Russia, over a period of four decades, "both released more than 200 million curies of radioactive isotopes into the surrounding environment — twice the amount expelled in the [[Chernobyl disaster]] in each instance".&lt;ref name=katebr/&gt; Most of this [[radioactive contamination]] over the years were part of normal operations, but unforeseen accidents did occur and plant management kept this secret, as the pollution continued unabated.&lt;ref name=katebr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hnn.us/article/153096 |title=Kate Brown: Nuclear "Plutopias" the Largest Welfare Program in American History |first=Robert|last=Lindley |date=2013|work=History News Network }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, a safe was discovered during excavations of a burial trench at the [[Hanford nuclear site]]. Inside the safe were various items, including a large glass bottle containing a whitish slurry which was subsequently identified as the oldest sample of weapons-grade plutonium known to exist.

The government covered up most of these radiation mishaps until 1993, when President [[Bill Clinton]] ordered a change of policy and federal agencies then made available relevant records. The resulting investigation was undertaken by the president’s [[Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments]], and it uncovered much of the material about plutonium research on humans. The committee issued a controversial 1995 report which said that "wrongs were committed" but it did not condemn those who perpetrated them.&lt;ref name=rc/&gt;

==Applications==
===Explosives===
[[File:Nagasakibomb.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki, Japan]] in 1945 had a plutonium core.|alt=Photo of an atomic explosion mushroom cloud with a gray stem and white cap]]
The isotope plutonium-239 is a key fissile component in nuclear weapons, due to its ease of fission and availability. Encasing the bomb's [[plutonium pit]] in a [[nuclear weapon design|tamper]] (an optional layer of dense material) decreases the amount of plutonium needed to reach [[critical mass (nuclear)|critical mass]] by [[neutron reflector|reflecting escaping neutrons]] back into the plutonium core. This reduces the amount of plutonium needed to reach criticality from 16&amp;nbsp;kg to 10&amp;nbsp;kg, which is a sphere with a diameter of about {{convert|10|cm|0|sp=us}}.{{sfn|Martin|2000|p=532}} This critical mass is about a third of that for uranium-235.&lt;ref name = "Heiserman1992"/&gt;

The Fat Man plutonium bombs used explosive compression of plutonium to obtain significantly higher densities than normal, combined with a central neutron source to begin the reaction and increase efficiency. Thus only 6.2&amp;nbsp;kg of plutonium was needed for an [[nuclear weapon yield|explosive yield]] equivalent to 20 kilotons of TNT.&lt;ref name="yield"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FASdesign"&gt;

===Mixed oxide fuel===
{{main|Nuclear reprocessing}}
[[Spent nuclear fuel]] from normal [[light water reactor]]s contains plutonium, but it is a mixture of [[plutonium-242]], 240, 239 and 238. The mixture is not sufficiently enriched for efficient nuclear weapons, but can be used once as [[MOX fuel]].&lt;ref name="MOX"/&gt; Accidental neutron capture causes the amount of plutonium-242 and 240 to grow each time the plutonium is irradiated in a reactor with low-speed "thermal" neutrons, so that after the second cycle, the plutonium can only be consumed by [[fast neutron reactor]]s. If fast neutron reactors are not available (the normal case), excess plutonium is usually discarded, and forms the longest-lived component of nuclear waste. The desire to consume this plutonium and other [[transuranic]] fuels and reduce the radiotoxicity of the waste is the usual reason nuclear engineers give to make fast neutron reactors.{{sfn|Till|Chang|2011|pp=254–256}}

The most common chemical process, [[PUREX]] (''P''lutonium–''UR''anium ''EX''traction) [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocesses]] spent nuclear fuel to extract plutonium and uranium which can be used to form a mixed oxide (MOX) fuel for reuse in nuclear reactors. Weapons-grade plutonium can be added to the fuel mix. MOX fuel is used in [[light water reactor]]s and consists of 60&amp;nbsp;kg of plutonium per tonne of fuel; after four years, three-quarters of the plutonium is burned (turned into other elements).&lt;ref name = "Emsley2001"/&gt; [[Breeder reactor]]s are specifically designed to create more fissionable material than they consume.{{sfn|Till|Chang|2011|p=15}}

Plutonium recovered from spent reactor fuel poses little proliferation hazard, because of excessive contamination with non-fissile plutonium-240 and plutonium-242. Separation of the isotopes is not feasible. A dedicated reactor operating on very low [[burnup]] (hence minimal exposure of newly formed plutonium-239 to additional neutrons which causes it to be transformed to heavier isotopes of plutonium) is generally required to produce material suitable for use in efficient [[nuclear weapons]]. While "weapons-grade" plutonium is defined to contain at least 92% plutonium-239 (of the total plutonium), the United States have managed to detonate an [[reactor-grade plutonium nuclear test|under-20Kt device]] using plutonium believed to contain only about 85% plutonium-239, so called '"fuel-grade" plutonium.&lt;ref name="inf15"/&gt; The "reactor-grade" plutonium produced by a regular LWR burnup cycle typically contains less than 60% Pu-239, with up to 30% parasitic Pu-240/Pu-242, and 10–15% fissile Pu-241.&lt;ref name="inf15"/&gt; It is unknown if a device using plutonium obtained from reprocessed civil nuclear waste can be detonated, however such a device could hypothetically fizzle and spread radioactive materials over a large urban area. The [[IAEA]] conservatively classifies plutonium of all isotopic vectors as "direct-use" material, that is, "nuclear material that can be used for the manufacture of nuclear explosives components without transmutation or further enrichment".&lt;ref name="inf15"&gt;{{cite web

===Toxicity===
There are two aspects to the harmful effects of plutonium: the radioactivity and the [[Heavy metal (chemistry)#Detrimental effects|heavy metal poison]] effects. Isotopes and compounds of plutonium are radioactive and accumulate in [[bone marrow]]. Contamination by plutonium oxide has resulted from [[lists of nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents|nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents]], including military nuclear accidents where nuclear weapons have burned.&lt;ref&gt;

During the decay of plutonium, three types of radiation are released—alpha, beta, and gamma. Alpha, beta, and gamma radiation are all forms of [[ionizing radiation]]. Either acute or longer-term exposure carries a danger of [[ionizing radiation#Biological effects|serious health outcomes]] including [[radiation sickness]], [[genetic damage]], [[cancer]], and death. The danger increases with the amount of exposure.&lt;ref name = "Emsley2001"/&gt; Alpha radiation can travel only a short distance and cannot travel through the outer, dead layer of human skin. Beta radiation can penetrate human skin, but cannot go all the way through the body. Gamma radiation can go all the way through the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/substances/toxsubstance.asp?toxid=119 |title=Plutonium, CAS ID #: 7440-07-5 |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) [[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]] |accessdate=February 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once in the bloodstream, plutonium moves throughout the body and into the bones, liver, or other body organs.

Cohen's own estimate is that a dose of 200&amp;nbsp;micrograms would likely be necessary to cause cancer.{{sfn|Kaku|Trainer|1983||p=77}}

Several populations of people who have been exposed to plutonium dust (e.g. people living down-wind of Nevada test sites, Nagasaki survivors, nuclear facility workers, and "terminally ill" patients injected with Pu in 1945–46 to study Pu metabolism) have been carefully followed and analyzed. These studies generally do not show especially high plutonium toxicity or plutonium-induced cancer results, such as [[Albert Stevens]] who survived into old age after being injected with plutonium.&lt;ref name="CohenMyth"/&gt; "There were about 25 workers from Los Alamos National Laboratory who inhaled a considerable amount of plutonium dust during 1940s; according to the hot-particle theory, each of them has a 99.5% chance of being dead from lung cancer by now, but there has not been a single lung cancer among them."&lt;ref name=Cohen-13/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Care must be taken to avoid the accumulation of amounts of plutonium which approach critical mass, particularly because plutonium's critical mass is only a third of that of uranium-235.&lt;ref name = "Heiserman1992"/&gt; A critical mass of plutonium emits lethal amounts of neutrons and [[gamma ray]]s.&lt;ref name = "Miner1968p546"&gt;{{harvnb|Miner|1968|p = 546}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plutonium in solution is more likely to form a critical mass than the solid form due to [[neutron moderator|moderation]] by the hydrogen in water.&lt;ref name = "CRC2006p4-27"/&gt;

[[Criticality accident]]s have occurred in the past, some of them with lethal consequences. Careless handling of [[tungsten carbide]] bricks around a 6.2&amp;nbsp;kg plutonium sphere resulted in a fatal dose of radiation at Los Alamos on August 21, 1945, when scientist [[Harry Daghlian]] received a dose estimated to be 5.1&amp;nbsp;sievert (510&amp;nbsp;[[Roentgen equivalent man|rems]]) and died 25&amp;nbsp;days later.&lt;ref&gt;

In December 1958, during a process of purifying plutonium at Los Alamos, a critical mass was formed in a mixing vessel, which resulted in the death of a chemical operator named [[Cecil Kelley criticality accident|Cecil Kelley]].

===Flammability===
Metallic plutonium is a fire hazard, especially if the material is finely divided. In a moist environment, plutonium forms hydrides on its surface, which are pyrophoric and may ignite in air at room temperature. Plutonium expands up to 70% in volume as it oxidizes and thus may break its container.&lt;ref name = "NucSafety"/&gt; The radioactivity of the burning material is an additional hazard. [[Magnesium oxide]] sand is probably the most effective material for extinguishing a plutonium fire. It cools the burning material, acting as a [[heat sink]], and also blocks off oxygen. Special precautions are necessary to store or handle plutonium in any form; generally a dry [[inert gas]] atmosphere is required.&lt;ref name="NucSafety"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hss.energy.gov/NuclearSafety/techstds/standard/hdbk1081/hbk1081d.html#ZZ281 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428220410/http://www.hss.energy.gov/NuclearSafety/techstds/standard/hdbk1081/hbk1081d.html |archivedate=April 28, 2007 |title=Primer on Spontaneous Heating and Pyrophoricity – Pyrophoric Metals – Plutonium |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Nuclear Safety, Quality Assurance and Environment |date=1994 |location=Washington (DC) |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|group=note|There was a major plutonium-initiated fire at the [[Rocky Flats Plant]] near [[Boulder, Colorado]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first = David|last = Albright|last2=O'Neill |first2=Kevin|date = 1999|url = http://www.isis-online.org/publications/usfacilities/Rfpbrf.html|title = The Lessons of Nuclear Secrecy at Rocky Flats|work = ISIS Issue Brief|accessdate = December 7, 2008|publisher = Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS)| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080708220510/http://www.isis-online.org/publications/usfacilities/Rfpbrf.html| archivedate = July 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==Transportation==
Around 11 metric tons of plutonium may be possessed by Japan alone, with 36 tons pending return after reprocessing in Britain and France. This is probably enough to make 6,000 atomic bombs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sg.news.yahoo.com/2-british-ships-arrive-japan-carry-plutonium-us-015323402.html 2 British ships arrive in Japan to carry plutonium to US]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land and sea===
The usual transportation of plutonium is through the more stable plutonium oxide in a sealed package. A typical transport consists of one truck carrying one protected shipping container, holding a number of packages with a total weight varying from 80 to 200&amp;nbsp;kg of plutonium oxide. A sea shipment may consist of several containers, each of them holding a sealed package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Transport/Transport-of-Radioactive-Materials/ |title=Transport of Radioactive Materials |publisher=World Nuclear Association |accessdate=February 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] dictates that it must be solid instead of powder if the contents surpass 0.74&amp;nbsp;[[Becquerel|TBq]] (20&amp;nbsp;[[Curie]]) of radioactive activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part071/part071-0063.html |title=§ 71.63 Special requirement for plutonium shipments |publisher=[[United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] |accessdate=February 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a recent example, the ships [[MV Pacific Egret|Pacific Egret]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pacific Egret|url=http://www.pntl.co.uk/our-fleet/pntl-ships/pacific-egret-2010/|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Pacific Heron of Pacific Nuclear Transport Ltd. are taking 331&amp;nbsp;kg (730&amp;nbsp;lbs) of plutonium to a United States government facility in [[Savannah River Site|Savannah River]], [[South Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yamaguchi|first1=Mari|title=Two British ships arrive in Japan to carry plutonium to US|url=http://phys.org/news/2016-03-british-ships-japan-plutonium.html|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Two British ships arrive in Japan to transport plutonium for storage in U.S.|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/03/21/national/two-british-ships-arrive-in-japan-to-transport-plutonium-for-storage-in-u-s/|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air===
The U.S. Government air transport regulations permit the transport of plutonium by air, subject to restrictions on other dangerous materials carried on the same flight, packaging requirements, and stowage in the rearmost part of the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cfr/title49/49-2.1.1.3.10.html#49:2.1.1.3.10.3.25.9|title=Part 175.704 Plutonium shipments|work=Code of Federal Regulations 49 — Transportation|accessdate=August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2354055,00.asp "Dean Kamen Honored by Popular Mechanics"], ''[[PC Magazine]]'', October 9, 2009. Accessed October 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Powered by a [[Stirling engine]] running on a combustible fuel source, it claims to be able to produce [[drinking water]] from almost any source&lt;ref&gt;Malnson, Donald. [https://www.engadget.com/2008/04/23/dean-kamen-aims-to-clean-water-generate-electricity-with-slings "Dean Kamen aims to clean water, generate electricity with Slingshot machine"], [[Engadget]], April 23, 2008. Accessed October 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; by means of [[Vapor-compression evaporation|vapor compression distillation]], requires no filters, and can operate using [[w:Cow dung|cow dung]] as fuel.

The name of the machine is a reference to the [[slingshot]] used by [[David]] to defeat [[Goliath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lazarus|first=Paul|title=Slingshot|url=http://focusforwardfilms.com/contest/16/slingshot-paul-lazarus|work=[[General Electric#Focus Forward - Short Films.2C Big Ideas|Focus Forward]]|publisher=[[General Electric]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical characteristics==
In his [[TEDMED]] 2010 presentation, Kamen announced several goals for and characteristics of the machine:&lt;ref name="tedmed2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA5UritjP3c#t=1470s |title=Dean Kamen at TEDMED 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* five years of operation without overhaul or maintenance
* use less than a [[Watt#Kilowatt|kilowatt]] of power (lower than the power consumption of a microwave oven)
* generate 1000 liters of pure water/day, enough for 100 people for hygiene and cooking
* meets the U.S. pharmacopoeic standard for water for injections
* requires no pre-treatment, pipelines, engineers, consumables (osmosis membranes, charcoal, etc.), or installation permits

==History==
Kamen came to develop the device on the basis of statistics that showed lack of access to clean water as a public health crisis. Statistics from the [[World Health Organization]] show that there are 900 million people worldwide without a readily available supply of [[drinking water]] and that some 3.5 million people die annually because of diseases resulting from the consumption of unsanitary water. Despite the fact that over two-thirds of the [[Earth]]'s surface is covered with water, only 1% of it is potable.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;Bergeron, Ryan. [http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/09/11/kamen.water.slingshot/index.html "Segway inventor takes aim at thirst with Slingshot"], ''[[CNN]]'', September 11, 2009. Accessed October 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kamen sought to develop a technology that would transform the 97% of water that is undrinkable into water that can be used and consumed on the spot, readily and inexpensively. The device takes contaminated water and runs it through a vapor compression distiller that produces clean water, producing 250 gallons daily (~946 litres), enough for 100 people. The test devices have been used with "anything that looks wet", including polluted river water, saline ocean water and raw sewage.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt; In a demonstration at a technology conference in October 2004, Kamen ran his own urine through the machine and drank the clean water that came out.&lt;ref name=OC/&gt;

Kamen built two machines&amp;nbsp;— a power generator that would output one kilowatt from "anything that burns", and the water distiller, which uses the electricity. In 2005, the power generator was tested for six months in a village in Bangladesh and generated enough electricity to light 70 energy-efficient light bulbs. The hand-made prototype cost {{US$|100000}} each.&lt;!-- it's unclear in the source if the generator+distiller pair cost $100K, or only the generator --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schonfeld|first=Erick|title=Segway creator unveils his next act|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/02/16/technology/business2_futureboy0216/|publisher=[[Business 2.0]] via [[CNNMoney]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2005, a team of 200 at [[DEKA (company)|DEKA]] had produced 30 units, each the size of a compact refrigerator.&lt;ref name=OC&gt;{{cite web |author=Ryan Pearson |url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/water-4371-really-people.html |title=Segway inventor drinks his own pee (really)| date=December 15, 2005 |publisher = [[Associated Press]] via [[Orange County Register]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pair of Slingshot devices ran successfully for a month in a village in [[Honduras]] during the summer of 2006. While the initial devices cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, Kamen hopes that increased [[economies of scale]] will allow production machines to be made available for $2,000 each.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

In 2008, Kamen demonstrated the device on [[The Colbert Report]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dean Kamen on the Colbert Report|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqg1Hu0PMG0#t=47s|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his TEDMED 2010 presentation, Kamen lamented throughout that when he asked for "a few million dollars" over a few months, no large global health organizations supported the development. Later in the presentation, he announced a partnership with [[The Coca-Cola Company]].&lt;ref name="tedmed2010" /&gt;

In 2011, field tests of Slingshot in five towns in Ghana proved their effectiveness and durability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patton|first=Phil|title=Slingshot: Inventor Dean Kamen’s Revolutionary Clean Water Machine|url=http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/slingshot-inventor-dean-kamens-revolutionary-clean-water-machine|publisher=[[Coca-Cola]]|date=Nov 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, Kamen and Coca Cola CEO [[Muhtar Kent]] announced at the [[Clinton Foundation#Clinton Global Initiative (CGI)|Clinton Global Initiative]] that in collaboration with DEKA Research, [[Africare]] and [[Inter-American Development Bank]], they will start bringing the Slingshot to rural parts of Latin America and Africa. The first initiative will be testing the Slingshot technology in health centers and schools in remote communities in Latin America in 2013.

==Proposed development==
Kamen hopes to send thousands of the units with local village entrepreneurs, in much the same way independent cell phone businesses have thrived and gradually changed the face of many impoverished areas around the globe. Future target price for the device is in the $1,000 to $2,000 range.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.impactlab.net/2008/04/22/dean-kamen-unveils-slingshot-the-ultimate-water-regenerator/ Dean Kamen Unveils Slingshot, The Ultimate Water Regenerator], Impact Lab, April 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, the product does not seem to be in commercial production or wide use. The systems appear to be distributed as a component of EKOCENTER kiosks, of which over 150 have been deployed worldwide.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

'''Smoking in Indonesia''' is common, as there are approximately 57 million smokers in [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://global.tobaccofreekids.org/files/pdfs/en/Indonesia_tobacco_taxes_report_en.pdf|title=Tobacco Economics in Indonesia|publisher=International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease|year=2008|accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of [[Demographics of Indonesia|Indonesian people]], 63% of men and 5% of women reported being smokers, a total of 34% of the population.&lt;ref name="TFC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tobaccofreecenter.org/resources_country/indonesia|title=Indonesia|publisher=Tobacco Free Center|accessdate=September 3, 2010}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 88% of [[Indonesia]] smokers use [[clove]]-flavoured  [[kretek]]s.&lt;ref name="TFC"/&gt;  Kretek manufacturers directly employ over 180,000 people in Indonesia and an additional 10 million indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;Hanusz, Mark ''Smoke''; ''A Century of Kretek'' pp. 140-143&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesia is the fifth largest tobacco market in the world, and in 2008 over 165 billion cigarettes were sold in the country.&lt;ref name="TFC"/&gt; Major tobacco companies dominating the market in Indonesia include [[Gudang Garam]], [[Sampoerna]] ([[Philip Morris International]]), [[Djarum]], [[Bentoel Group]] ([[British American Tobacco]]) and Nojorono Tobacco International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euromonitor.com/tobacco-in-indonesia/report|publisher=Euro Monitor|title=Country Report: Tobacco in Indonesia|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[WHO]] has ranked Indonesia third in the world for total number of smokers.&lt;ref name=English/&gt;

==Child smoking==
According to an official spokesman of a special commission set up to protect children's rights (KPAI) and evolve regulations to prevent children getting addicted to smoking, "The future of 80 million Indonesian children is at stake as the cigarette producers were intentionally aiming children as their future market through massive TV advertisements and sponsorships on activities in which teenagers involved the most."&lt;ref name=English&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90782/90880/7122690.html|title=Indonesia struggling to deter children from smoking|accessdate=2010-09-06|publisher=People’s Daily Online|date=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 30% of Indonesian children reportedly smoke a cigarette before the age of 10.&lt;ref name="Yahoo"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.news.yahoo.com/4/20100903/twl-toddler-who-smoked-40-a-day-kicks-hi-41f21e0.html |title=Toddler Who Smoked 40 a Day Kicks Habit |publisher=Yahoo!

==Kretek cigarettes==
{{Main article|Kretek}}
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Kinderen aan het werk in een sigarettenfabriek Nederlands-Indië TMnr 10022097.jpg|thumb|Child labour in the Kretek industry of the [[Dutch East Indies]] era.]]
Kretek is credited as an invention by Nitisemito of Kudus, an industrial town in [[Central Java]]. They emerged in the late 19th century in [[Java]]. The practice was to roll, by hand, a compound of [[tobacco]], [[cloves]] and [[cocoa solids|cocoa]] in a dry corn husk wrap, which gives a honeyed flavour. It was Nitisemito who introduced cigarette papers in place of corn husk; following this simple innovation, a Kretek manufacturing factory was opened in [[Sumatra]]. The first brand of cigarette produced in this factory, "Bal Tiga" (three balls), became very popular, and as result, the economy of Kudus prospered.  The inventor popularized his brand of cigarettes through a concerted media campaign, even establishing his own radio station for the purpose.{{fact|date=November 2014}} He touted his habit of smoking kretek as the cure for his [[asthma]]. However, intense competition (25 manufactures are now reported in the city and its suburbs) combined with poor management resulted in his eventual financial failure, when he died in 1953.&lt;ref name= Backshall&gt;{{Cite book|last= Backshall|first= Stephen|title= The Rough Guide to Indonesia|page=266|accessdate=2010-09-06|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WKoIooGXjPYC&amp;pg=PA266|publisher= Rough Guides|year= 2003|isbn=1-85828-991-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another local brand, which became very popular in the 1980s, is the Gudang Garam brand of Kretek. [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese businessmen]]{{fact|date=November 2014}} who are credited with establishing this brand of Kretek from a modest beginning in the 1920s produced 40 billion cigarettes in the 1980s. Other business enterprises competing with this brand tried to discredit the brand by attributing use of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]{{fact|date=November 2014}} in addition to cloves and [[tobacco]]. It has the distinction of being the largest single [[Economy of Indonesia|employer in Indonesia]].&lt;ref name=Eliot&gt;{{Cite book|last=Eliot|first=Joshua|author2=Liz Capaldi |author3=Jane Bickersteth |title= Indonesia handbook, Volume 3|page=244|accessdate=2010-09-06|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ktv0_me9x2UC&amp;pg=PA244|publisher= Footprint Travel Guides|year=2001|isbn=1-900949-51-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kretek is very popular in rural areas as this type of cigarette is cheap. Kretek is known to burn slowly, and also self-extinguish.&lt;ref name=Gupta&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gupta|first=Praksh C.|title= Control of tobacco-related cancers and other diseases: proceedings of an international symposium, January 15–19, 1990, TIFR, Bombay|page=16|accessdate=2010-09-06|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Zqo67BjH7UC&amp;pg=PA16|publisher= Prakash C. Gupta|year=1992|isbn=0-19-562961-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence seems to suggest oral lesions may be less common than with other cigarette types. Due to this effect, cigarette smoking has largely replaced [[betel]] chewing.&lt;ref name= Macleod&gt;{{Cite book|last=Macleod|first=Mudo J.|author2=, Evelyn Sakakida Rawski |url=http://www.google.co.in/search?q=Smoking%20in%20Indonesia&amp;hl=en&amp;resnum=1&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbo=u&amp;tbs=nws:1,bks:1&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=np|title=European intruders and changes in behaviour and customs in Africa, America, and Asia before 1800: Snippet View|accessdate=2010-09-06|publisher= Ashgate|year=1998|isbn= 0-86078-522-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Kretek" is [[onomatopoeic]], referring to the crackling sound that is produced when such cigarettes are burnt and inhaled.&lt;ref name= Backshall/&gt;

Kretek cigarettes contain high concentration of [[tar]] and [[nicotine]], approximately four times that of the strongest [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboros]].&lt;ref name="BMJ-Reynolds1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reynolds|first1=Catherine|title=The fourth largest market in the world|journal=Tobacco Control|date=1 March 1999|volume=8|issue=1|pages=89–91|doi=10.1136/tc.8.1.89|url=http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/8/1/89|issn=0964-4563|pmc=1763937}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries (such as the [[United States]]) have banned marketing flavoured cigarettes (including kreteks), as these are often seen as more appealing to the youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Delnevo|first1=Cristine D.|last2=Hrywna|first2=Mary|title=Clove cigar sales following the US flavoured cigarette ban|journal=Tobacco Control|date=1 December 2015|volume=24|issue=e4|pages=e246–e250|doi=10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2013-051415|url=http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/24/e4/e246|issn=0964-4563}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other harmful effect mentioned is from the [[clove oil]] used in making Kretek. The clove oil or [[eugenol]] is harmful to the lungs. The Indonesian Health Department reported in 2000 that 200,000 people are affected by [[cancer]] every year but eugenols exact relation to smoking has not been evaluated. Due to the popularity of Kretek, 5% of the national revenue is from this source, next only to the revenue from oil. Indonesia also records the highest growth of cigarette industry in the world, accounting for 4% of the world consumption.&lt;ref name= Backshall/&gt;

While cigarette smoking is declining throughout the world, in Indonesia, the industry continues to thrive. Indonesia has one of the highest smoking rates in the world and is currently one of the biggest producers of tobacco worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Danubrata|first1=Eveline|last2=Beo Da Costa|first2=Agustinus|title=Exclusive: Indonesia eyes decree on tobacco after bill runs into opposition|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-tobacco-idUSKBN1710WJ|accessdate=19 May 2018|work=Reuters|date=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Malaysia]] and the [[United States]] being two of their important markets.&lt;ref name=Report/&gt; There are hundreds of tobacco companies in the country, with [[Gudang Garam]], [[Djarum]], [[Sampoerna]] and [[Bentoel]] dominating the Indonesian market share.&lt;ref name="BMJ-Reynolds1" /&gt;

Kretek was initially a habit of the lower classes of society. However, it has now become very popular among the "middle class and intelligentsia, to the extent that it has become very ''de rigueur'' and a mark of Indonesian-ness."&lt;ref name=Eliot/&gt;

==Harmful effects and regulations==
Tobacco smoking in Indonesia is said to claim 300,000 lives every year.&lt;ref name="Republika"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.republika.co.id/berita/gaya-hidup/info-sehat/12/05/29/m4sanu-pembunuh-sadis-ini-menewaskan-300-ribu-orang-tiap-tahun|title='Pembunuh Sadis' Ini Menewaskan 300 Ribu Orang Tiap Tahun|author=Endah Hapsari|date= May 30, 2012 &lt;!-- , 10:12 WIB --&gt; |publisher= Republika Online|language=Indonesian|accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the country has required "no smoking" signs in health care units, educational institutions and in [[public transportation]] system, there is no ban on smoking in government and private offices, restaurants and bars. Tax exemptions in the country provide an incentive to the manufacturers to advertise the sale of cigarettes as compared to other countries in the region, in spite of the [[World Bank]] suggesting higher tax rates. As a result, tobacco manufacturers almost run cigarette advertisements for free. All these factors, plus its low cost, have contributed to the extensive proliferation of cigarette smoking in the country among people of all ages.&lt;ref name="TFC"/&gt; So much so, that even a two-year-old child picked up the habit of smoking two packs of cigarettes a day in his fishing village, where every one smokes. It was reported that the child's father initiated his son into this habit at the age of 18 months. However, press reports indicate that the child has been placed in rehabilitation by keeping him in a different environment under the care of a psychologist, and as a result the child has given up smoking.&lt;ref name=toddler&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100903/ap_on_re_as/as_indonesia_smoking_toddler|title=Indonesia's smoking toddler kicks the habit|accessdate=2010-09-06|agency=The Associated Press|via=Yahoo!

'''Sodium hexametaphosphate''' ('''SHMP''') is a [[hexamer]] of composition (NaPO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Van Wazer, John R. ''Phosphorus and its compounds''. New York : Interscience Publishers (1958)&lt;/ref&gt; Sodium hexametaphosphate of commerce is typically a mixture of polymeric metaphosphates, of which the hexamer is one, and is usually the compound referred to by this name. It is more correctly termed sodium polymetaphosphate.

==Uses==
SHMP is used as a [[sequestrant]] and has applications within a wide variety of industries, including as a [[food additive]] in which it is used under the [[E number]] E452i. [[Sodium carbonate]] is sometimes added to SHMP to raise the [[pH]] to 8.0–8.6, which produces a number of SHMP products used for [[water softening]] and [[detergents]].

A significant use for sodium hexametaphosphate is as a [[deflocculant]] in the production of clay-based [[ceramic]] particles.&lt;ref&gt;''The Role Of Sodium Hexametaphosphate In The Dissolution Process Of Kaolinite And Kaolin''F. Andreola; E.Castellini; T.Manfredini; M.Romagnoli. Journal of the European Ceramic Society, Volume 24, Number 7, June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Impact Of Dispersants On The Mechanical Strength Development Of Alumina-Spinel Self-Flowing Refractory Castables.'' Sasan Otroj, Mohammad Reza Nilforushan, Arash Daghighi, Reza Marzban. Ceramics – Silikáty 54 (3) 284–289 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Effect Of Adding Sodium Hexametaphosphate Liquefier On Basic Properties Of Calcium Phosphate Cements''. S. Hesaraki; A. Zamanian; F. Moztarzadeh. Journal of Biomedical Materials Research Part A. Vol. 88A, No. 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Study Of Clay’s Mineralogy Effect On Rheological Behavior Of Ceramic Suspensions Using An Experimental Design.'' Afef Jmal Ayadi; Julien Soro; Amel Kamoun; Samir Baklouti. International Journal of Recent Research and Applied Studies 14 (2). February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used as a dispersing agent to break down clay and other soil types for [[soil texture]] assessment.&lt;ref&gt;ASTM D422 – 63(2007) Standard Test Method for Particle-Size Analysis of Soils.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is used as an active ingredient in toothpastes as an anti-staining and tartar prevention ingredient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crestprohealth.com/pro-health-faq/ Crest Pro-Health Frequently Asked Questions]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food additive===

As a food additive, SHMP is used as an [[emulsifier]].  Artificial maple syrup, canned milk, cheese powders and dips, imitation cheese, whipped topping, packaged egg whites, roast beef, fish fillets, fruit jelly, frozen desserts, salad dressing, herring, breakfast cereal, ice cream, beer, and bottled beverages, among other foods, can contain SHMP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.befoodsmart.com/ingredients/sodium-hexametaphosphate.php | title=Ingredient Results - Sodium Hexametaphosphate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fda.gov/food/ingredientspackaginglabeling/foodadditivesingredients/ucm091048.htm | title=Food Additives &amp; Ingredients - Food Additive Status List}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?fr=173.310 | title=CFR - Code of Federal Regulations Title 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
SHMP is prepared by heating [[monosodium orthophosphate]] to generate sodium acid pyrophosphate:

: 2 NaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Subsequently, the pyrophosphate is heated to give the corresponding sodium hexametaphosphate:

: 3 Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; → (NaPO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

followed by rapid cooling.

==Reactions==
SHMP hydrolyzes in aqueous solution, particularly under acidic conditions, to [[sodium trimetaphosphate]] and [[sodium orthophosphate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Wazer|first1=John|title=Phosphorus and its Compounds|date=1958|publisher=Interscience Publishers|location=New York|url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/010058734|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hexametaphosphoric acid was named (but misidentified) in 1849 by the German chemist [[:de:Theodor Fleitmann|Theodor Fleitmann]] (1828–1904).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fleitmann |first1=Th. |title=Ueber die verschiedenen Metaphosphorsäuren und zwei neue Säuren derselben Verbindungsproportion |journal=Annalen der Physik und Chemie |date=1849 |volume=78 |pages=233–260, 338–366 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951d00321228n;view=1up;seq=251 |series=2nd series |trans-title=On various metaphosphoric acids and two new acids of the same compound proportion |language=German}} On p. 249, Fleitmann coined the name ''Hexametaphosphorsäure'' (hexametaphosphoric acid).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Griffith |first1=E.J. |last2=Buxton |first2=R.L. |title=The preparation and properties of the twelve-membered ring hexametaphosphate anion |journal=Inorganic Chemistry |date=1965 |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=549–551}} ; see p. 549.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1956, [[Paper chromatography|chromatographic analysis]] of [[hydrolysate]]s of Graham's salt (sodium polyphosphate) indicated the presence of cyclic anions containing more than four phosphate groups;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van Wazer |first1=J.

[[File:Rauwolfia serpentina (3) - സര്‍പ്പഗന്ധി.jpg|left|thumb|139x139px|''Rauwolfia Serpentina'']]
Founded by M Manal, the Himalaya Drug Company's history began in 1930. Manal, while in the forests of Burma, became interested in the root, ''"Rauwolfia serpentina"'', which helped pacify elephants.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://www.himalayawellness.com/aboutus/&lt;/ref&gt; Becoming engrossed in the intriguing effects surrounding the root, Manal went on to studying various herbs, and producing tablets. According to Himalaya Wellness, Manal's motivation and "vision was to bring the traditional science of [[Ayurveda]] to society in a contemporary form."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;  Nonetheless, in 1934, Serpina&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, derived from Rauwolfia serpentina, became "the world's first natural antihypertensive drug".&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Another product soon became the Himalaya drug company's best selling medicine, Liv. 52. This product, created in 1955, is "a liver formulation that ensures optimum liver function.".&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;  In addition, the Himalaya Drug company soon introduced several other products, such as Cystone, Bonnisan and Rumalaya forte.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; In the 1930s, the company was based in Dehradun, but subsequently it advanced to Mumbai and extended across India. Then, in 1975, it established a factory.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; in Makali, Bangalore. Finally, in 1991, the company moved its research and development facility to Bangalore.

'''Vikenty Vikentyevich Smidovich''' (January 16, 1867 &amp;ndash; June 3, 1945), better known by his pen name '''Vikenty Vikentyevich Veresaev''', ({{lang-ru|Вике́нтий Вике́нтьевич Вереса́ев}}) was a Russian writer and medical doctor of Polish descent.

==Early life==
Veresaev was born in [[Tula, Russia|Tula]], where his father was a doctor. After graduating from the Tula [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in 1884, he attended [[Saint Petersburg State University|Saint Petersburg University]], taking a master's degree in history in 1888. He then enrolled in [[University of Tartu|University of Dorpat/Yuryev]] and successfully completed a course in medicine.&lt;ref name="Introduction 1988"&gt;{{cite book |title=''Introduction to'' In the Steppe, ''from'' The Salt Pit |last=Shavkuta |first=Anatoly |author2=Tkachenko, Nikolai  |year=1988 |publisher=Raduga Publishers |location=Moscow |isbn=5-05-001671-1 |page=106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
His first work to appear in print was a collection of poems in 1885. His first short story, ''The Puzzle'', was published in 1887.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Vikentii+Vikentevich+Veresaev |title=The Great Soviet Encyclopedia |year=2010 |publisher=The Gale Group |accessdate=2012-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890 he toured the coal mines of [[Donetsk]] with his brother, gathering material for a collection of sketches called ''The Underground Kingdom'', detailing the struggles and hardships of the exploited miners, which he published in 1892.&lt;ref name="Introduction 1988"/&gt;

==Career==
During the 1890s, Veresaev joined a group known as the Legal Marxists, and he published works in such journals as ''New Word'', ''Inception'' and ''Life''. During this period he wrote a cycle of works concerning the intelligentsia’s frame of mind at the turn of the 20th century, including the novella ''Without a Road'' (1895), the short story ''The Craze'' (1898) and the novella ''At the Turning Point'' (1902). He also wrote about the difficult position of the Russian peasantry, such as in the short story ''Lizar'' (1899) which was praised by [[Vladimir Lenin]]. His short story ''On a Dead-end Road'' (1896) and the novella ''Two Ends'' (1899–1903) were devoted to the life of the workers.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"/&gt;

During the first decade of the 20th century Veresaev was a member of the [[Sreda (literary group)|Sreda]] (Wednesday) literary group and published his works in [[Maxim Gorky]]'s [[Znanie (publishing company)|Znanie]] collections. He published his most successful book, the semi-autobiographical ''Memoirs of a Physician'' in 1901, in which he sharply criticized the system of Russian medical education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Russian Literature |last=Terras |first=Victor |year=1991 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0-300-05934-5 |page=474 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1901 he was dismissed from the hospital where he'd been working because of his political views, and was forbidden to live in Moscow or Saint Petersburg for a period of two years.&lt;ref name="Introduction 1988"/&gt;

In 1904, at the outbreak of the [[Russo-Japanese War]], he joined the army as a doctor. He told of his experiences in his book ''In the War'', published in 1906. In this work he showed the heroism of Russian soldiers and officers and, at the same time, the corruption of the tsarist army.&lt;ref name="Introduction 1988"/&gt;

Veresaev also wrote a long critical and philosophical work entitled ''Vital Life'', the first book of which (1910) was devoted to a comparative analysis of [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] (''Man Accursed'') and [[Leo Tolstoy]] (''Long Live the Whole World!''); the second book, ''Apollo and Dionysius'' (1915), was a critique of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s views. In 1911 Veresaev established the Pisately v Moskve Publishing House which he headed until 1918.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"/&gt;

==Later life==
After the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|1917 Revolution]], which he welcomed, he devoted much of his time to cultural development and education. He also completed his cycle of works about the intelligentsia, including the novels ''In a Blind Alley'' (1922- translated into English as ''The Deadlock'') and ''The Sisters'' (1933). He published his reminiscences ''In the Years of My Youth'' in 1927 and ''In My Student Years'' in 1929. He also translated works by ancient Greek and Roman authors, including Homer’s Hymns, [[Sappho]], [[Archilochus]] and others. At the end of the 1930s he began to translate the [[Iliad]] (published in 1949) and the [[Odyssey]] (published in 1953).&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"/&gt;

For his outstanding achievements in the field of literature Veresaev was awarded the [[USSR State Prize|Stalin Prize]] in 1945. He was also awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"/&gt; He died in Moscow in June 1945.&lt;ref name="Introduction 1988"/&gt;

An overcrowding of an area causes visual pollution. Visual pollution is defined as the whole of irregular formations, which are mostly found in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yilmaz|first=Demet|title=In the Context of Visual Pollution: Effects to Trabzon City Center Silhoutte|journal=The Asian Social Science Journal|date=May 2011|volume=7|issue=5|page=99|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/866420567|accessdate=March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nagle, Copeland.

Local managers of urban areas sometimes lack control over what is built and assembled in public places.  As businesses look for ways to increase the profits, cleanliness, architecture, logic and use of space in urban areas are suffering from visual clutter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morozan|first1=Cristian|last2=Enache|first2=Elena|last3=Purice| first3=Suzan

Insensitivity of local administration is another cause for visual pollution.  For example, poorly planned buildings and transportation systems create visual pollution.  High-rise buildings, if not planned properly or sufficiently, can bring adverse change to the visual and physical characteristics of a city, which may reduce said city's [[readability]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yilmaz|first=Demet|title=In the Context of Visual Pollution: Effects to Trabzon City Center Silhoutte|journal=The Asian Social Science Journal|date=May 2011|volume=7|issue=5|page=99|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/866420567|accessdate=March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(2009). Cell Phone Towers as Visual Pollution. Notre Dame Journal of Law, Ethics and Public Policy.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[highway beautification]].  However, with the introduction of new communication technologies the fragmentation and incentive nature of advertising methods will improve, reducing [[Clutter (advertising)|clutter]].

== Prevention ==

=== United States ===

In the United States, there are several initiatives gradually taking place to prevent visual pollution. The Federal [[Highway Beautification Act]] of 1965 limits placement of billboards on Interstate highways and federally aided roads. It has dramatically reduced the amount of billboards placed on these roads.&lt;ref&gt;Nagle, Copeland. (2009). Cell Phone Towers as Visual Pollution.  Notre Dame Journal of Law, Ethics and Public Policy. Retrieved from&lt;/ref&gt; Another highway bill, the [[Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act]] (ISTEA) of 1991 has made transportation facilities sync with the needs of communities. This bill created a system of state and national [[scenic byway]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and provided funds for biking trails, historic preservation and scenic conservation.&lt;ref&gt;Maguire, M., Foote, R., &amp; Vespe, F. (1997). Beauty as well as bread. American Planning Association.Journal of the American Planning Association, 63(3), 317-328. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/229617956&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dunn Foundation is an organization that increases public awareness of visual pollution and landscape appearance in America through educational programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visual Pollution|url=http://161.58.47.7/|publisher=The Dunn Foundation|accessdate=April 2, 2013|year=2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602185309/http://161.58.47.7/|archivedate=June 2, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation has designed an educationally interactive package for students from grades 3-12 on how to improve the visual environment in their communities. Another company working toward prevention of visual clutter is [[Scenic America]]; a non-profit organization that envisions a future movement toward ensuring that scenic conservation boosts the economy and decreases visual pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seven Principles of Scenic Conservation|url=http://www.scenic.org/about-us/seven-principles-of-scenic-conservation|publisher=Scenic America|accessdate=April 2, 2013|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Businesses situated near an interstate can create problems of advertising through large billboards, however now an alternative solution for advertisers is gradually eliminating the problem. For example, logo signs that provide directional information for travelers without disfiguring the landscape are increasing and are a step toward decreasing visual pollution on highways in America.&lt;ref&gt;Maguire, M., Foote, R., &amp; Vespe, F. (1997). Beauty as well as bread. American Planning Association.Journal of the American Planning Association, 63(3), 317-328. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/229617956&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, researchers believe that planners should help and encourage citizens to maintain their communities as citizens have the power to influence government, especially local and regional management where most issues regarding appearance and disclosed.

=== Brazil ===

In September 2006, [[São Paulo]] passed the [[Cidade Limpa]] (Clean City Law), outlawing the use of all outdoor advertisements, including on billboards, transit, and in front of stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Five Years After Banning Outdoor Ads, Brazil's Largest City Is More Vibrant Than Ever|url=http://www.newdream.org/resources/sao-paolo-ad-ban|publisher=The Center for a New American Dream|accessdate=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
