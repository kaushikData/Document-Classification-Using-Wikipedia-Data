'''Academic bias''' is the [[bias]] or perceived bias of [[academia|scholars]] allowing their beliefs to shape their research and the [[scientific community]]. Claims of bias are often linked to claims by conservatives of pervasive bias against political conservatives and religious Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Hibbing|first=John D|year=2014|title=Differences in negativity bias underlie variations in political ideology|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|volume=37|pages=297–350|issn=1939-1323|doi=10.1017/S0140525X13001192}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Proposition|claim]] focuses on what conservatives, such as [[David Horowitz]], say is discrimination against those who hold a conservative ideology and the argument that research has been corrupted by a desire to promote an progressive agenda. Barry Ames et al., John Lee and Henry Giroux have argued that these claims are based upon [[anecdotal evidence]] which would not reliably indicate systematic bias.&lt;ref name="Ames 2005"&gt;{{citation|last=Ames|first=Barry|first2=David C|last2=Barker|first3=Chris W|last3=Bonneau|first4=Christopher J|last4=Carman|year=2005|title=Hide the Republicans, the Christians, and the Women: A Response to "Politics and Professional Advancement Among College Faculty"|journal=The Forum|volume=3|issue=2|issn=1540-8884|doi=10.2202/1540-8884.1075}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee 2006"&gt;{{citation|last=Lee |first=John |date=November 2006 |title=The "Faculty Bias" Studies: Science or Propaganda |publisher=American Federation of Teachers |format=PDF |url=http://www.aft.org/pdfs/highered/facultybiasstudies1106.pdf |accessdate=2014-01-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217043411/http://www.aft.org/pdfs/highered/facultybiasstudies1106.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Giroux|first=Henry A.|year=2006|title=Academic Freedom Under Fire: The Case for Critical Pedagogy|journal=College Literature|publisher=West Chester University|location=West Chester|volume=33|issue=4|pages=1–42|issn=1542-4286|doi=10.1353/lit.2006.0051}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell Jacoby has argued that claims of academic bias have been used to push measures that infringe on [[academic freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Jacoby|first=Russell|year=2005|title=So Universities Hire Liberal Faculty-This Is News?|magazine=[[The Nation]]|url=http://hnn.us/article/10836|authorlink=Russell Jacoby|accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to {{em|[[Academic Questions]]}}, a quarterly journal with a conservative point of view, evidence for academic bias includes the [[Liberal bias in academia|disproportionate percentage of academics who are political progressives]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Klein|first=Daniel B.|first2=Carlotta|last2=Stern|first3=Andrew|last3=Western|year=2005|title=Political diversity in six disciplines|journal=Academic Questions|volume=18|issue=1|pages=40–52|issn=0895-4852|doi=10.1007/s12129-004-1031-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zipp 2006"&gt;{{citation|last=Zipp|first=J.

Instead of conservatives not participating in academia because of discrimination, this theory suggests that conservatives simply are more likely to choose not to pursue an academic career.&lt;ref name="Ames 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gross2&gt;{{citation|last=Gross|first=Neil|title=Why Are Professors Liberal and Why Do Conservatives Care?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5-VLm9EcghoC|date=9 April 2013|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-674-07448-4|accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empirical support for academic bias==
Some research supports the possibility of academic bias against political conservatives and the highly religious. An [[audit study]] suggests that entrance into a [[clinical psychology]] graduate program is negatively affected by whether the applicant is a conservative [[Protestant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Gartner|first=John D|year=1986|title=Antireligious prejudice in admissions to doctoral programs in clinical psychology|journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice|volume=17|issue=5|pages=473–475|issn=1939-1323|doi=10.1037/0735-7028.17.5.473}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examination of the comments made by members of the admission committees of medical schools also indicated religious candidates were more closely questioned because of their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Gunn|first=Albert E|first2=George O Jr|last2=Zenner|title=Religious Discrimination in the Selection of Medical Students: A Case Study|volume=11|issue=4|pages=363–78|pmid=8934858|year=1996|journal=Issues in Law &amp; Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research indicates a willingness of academics to openly admit that they are less likely to hire a colleague, if they find out that the colleague is either religiously or politically conservative.&lt;ref name="Yancey 2011"&gt;{{citation|last=Yancey|first=George A|title=Compromising Scholarship: Religious and Political Bias in American Higher Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KgrKSAAACAAJ|date=January 2011|publisher=Baylor University Press|location=Waco|isbn=978-1-60258-268-2|accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Inbar|first=Yoel|first2=Joris|last2=Lammers|year=2012|title=Political Diversity in Social and Personality Psychology|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|volume=7|issue=5|pages=496–503|issn=1745-6916|doi=10.1177/1745691612448792}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Yancey's research is particularly notable since he finds that academics in a variety of disciplines are open to discriminating against fundamentalists, evangelicals and to a lesser extent Republicans. Research further suggests that certain types of conservatives are more likely to suffer from potential academic bias. Stanley Rothman and S. Robert Lichter's analysis indicates that economic and foreign policy conservatives' academic careers do not appear to be shaped by their conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, Stanley, and S. Robert Lichter. 2009. "The Vanishing Conservative--Is There a Glass Ceiling." In The Politically Correct University: Problem, Scope, and Reforms, edited by Robert Maranto, Richard E. Redding and Frederick M. Hess, 60-76. Washington, DC: The AEI Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Yancey also argues that the label of Republican or Christian may not be enough to trigger bias but those seen as strongly conservative in their political ideology or religious theology may garner discrimination and prejudice.&lt;ref name="Yancey 2012"&gt;{{citation|last=Yancey|first=George|year=2012|title=Recalibrating Academic Bias|journal=Academic Questions|volume=25|issue=2|pages=267–278|issn=0895-4852|doi=10.1007/s12129-012-9282-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore,  evidence of academic bias appears to be stronger in the social sciences and humanities than in the natural sciences.&lt;ref name="Zipp 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yancey 2011"/&gt; According to George Yancey, such findings indicate that if academic bias exists then it does so within a given cultural context.&lt;ref name="Yancey 2012"/&gt;

==Empirical support for self-selection==
However, reasons given for the unwillingness of conservatives to pursue an academic career may be because conservatives prefer higher paying jobs&lt;ref name="Ames 2005" /&gt; and are not as tolerant of controversial ideas&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/18/arts/18liberal.html|title=Professor Is a Label That Leans to the Left|last=Cohen|first=Patricia|date=18 January 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|page=C1|accessdate=2014-01-24|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; as progressives. Empirical support for self-selection can be found in the work of Neil Gross.&lt;ref name=Gross2 /&gt; He conducted an audit study whereby he sent emails to directors of graduate study programs. He varied the emails so that some of them indicated the student supported the presidential candidacy of Senator [[John McCain]], some of them supported the presidential candidacy of then Senator [[Barack Obama]] and some of them were politically neutral. He found that the directors of graduate study programs did not significantly vary in their treatment of the senders of the letters regardless of the implied political advocacy of that sender. His work suggests an absence of systematic discrimination against [[political conservatives]].&lt;ref name="Gross2"/&gt;

==Implications of academic discrimination==
Brent D. Slife and Jeffrey S. Reber assert that an implicit bias against theism limits possible insights in the field of psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Slife|first=Brent D|first2=Jeffrey S|last2=Reber|year=2009|title=Is There a Pervasive Implicit Bias Against Theism in Psychology?|journal=Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology|volume=29|issue=2|pages=63–79|issn=2151-3341|doi=10.1037/a0016985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by a conservative group, the [[American Council of Trustees and Alumni]], argues that course curriculums betray a progressive bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=American Council of Trustees and Alumni|url=http://www.goacta.org/images/download/how_many_ward_churchills.pdf|title=How Many Ward Churchills?|date=May 2006|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, John Lee argues that this research is not based on a probability sample and uses a research design that cannot rule out explanations other than political bias.&lt;ref name="Lee 2006" /&gt;  Furthermore, research suggests little or no leftward movement among college students while they are in college.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Mariani|first=Mack D.|first2=Gordon J|last2=Hewitt|year=2008|title=Indoctrination U.? Faculty Ideology and Changes in Student Political Orientation|journal=PS: Political Science &amp; Politics|volume=41|issue=4|issn=1049-0965|doi=10.1017/S1049096508081031}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Academic bias has also been argued as a problem due to discrimination against conservative students.  Research has indicated that conservative Christians may experience discrimination on colleges and universities, though these studies are anecdotal and rely on self-reported perceptions of discrimination. For example, the Hyers' study includes "Belief Conflicts" and "Interaction Difficulties" as discriminatory events.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Hyers|first=Lauri L|first2=Conrad|last2=Hyers|year=2008|title=Everyday Discrimination Experienced by Conservative Christians at the Secular University|journal=Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy|volume=8|issue=1|pages=113–137|issn=1529-7489|doi=10.1111/j.1530-2415.2008.00162.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Rosik|first=Christopher H|first2=Linda L|last2=Smith|year=2009|title=Perceptions of religiously based discrimination among Christian students in secular and Christian university settings|journal=Psychology of Religion and Spirituality|volume=1|issue=4|pages=207–217|issn=1943-1562|doi=10.1037/a0017076}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other work suggests that very few students experience discrimination based on political ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Rothman|first1=Stanley|last2=Kelley-Woessner|first2=April|last3=Woessner|first3=Matthew|title=The Still Divided Academy: How Competing Visions of Power, Politics, and Diversity Complicate the Mission of Higher Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7PPJdzcf7rAC|date=16 December 2010|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-1-4422-0808-7|accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bias in other dimensions==
There is some evidence that academic bias can be based in non-political and non-religious dimensions. At least one study suggests that perception of classroom bias may be rooted in issues of sexuality, [[race (human classification)|race]], class and sex as much or more than in [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Boysen|first=Guy A|first2=David L|last2=Vogel|first3=Marissa A|last3=Cope|first4=Asale|last4=Hubbard|year=2009|title=Incidents Of Bias in College Classrooms: Instructor and Student Perceptions|journal=Journal of Diversity in Higher Education|volume=2|issue=4|pages=219–231|issn=1938-8934|doi=10.1037/a0017538}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Yancey's research, willingness of academics to discriminate against colleagues indicate little appetite for such discrimination, unless the target is religiously or politically conservative.&lt;ref name="Yancey 2011"/&gt;

'''Academic publishing''' is the subfield of [[publishing]] which distributes academic research and scholarship. Most academic work is published in [[academic journal]] article, book or [[thesis]] form. The part of academic written output that is not formally published but merely printed up or posted on the Internet is often called "[[grey literature]]". Most scientific and scholarly journals, and many academic and scholarly books, though not all, are based on some form of [[peer review]] or editorial refereeing to qualify texts for publication. Peer review quality and selectivity standards vary greatly from journal to journal, publisher to publisher, and field to field.

Most established [[academic discipline]]s have their own journals and other outlets for publication, although many academic journals are somewhat [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]], and publish work from several distinct fields or subfields. There is also a tendency for existing journals to divide into specialized sections as the field itself becomes more specialized. Along with the variation in review and publication procedures, the kinds of publications that are accepted as contributions to knowledge or research differ greatly among fields and subfields.

Academic publishing is undergoing major changes, as it makes the transition from the print to the electronic format. Business models are different in the electronic environment. Since the early 1990s, licensing of electronic resources, particularly journals, has been very common. Currently, an important trend, particularly with respect to journals in the sciences, is [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] via the Internet. In [[Open access (publishing)|open access publishing]], a journal article is made available free for all on the web by the publisher at the time of publication. Open-access journals are often funded by the [[Author-pays model|author paying]] hundreds or thousands of dollars in [[Article Processing Charge|publication fees]], thereby shifting the costs from the reader to the researcher or their funder, but some open-access journals are funded directly. The Internet has facilitated open access [[self-archiving]], in which authors themselves make a copy of their published articles available free for all on the web.&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ercim"/&gt; Some important results&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/01/AR2010070106247.html|title=Russian mathematician wins $1 million prize, but he appears to be happy with $0|newspaper=Washington Post|date=July 2, 2010|first=Marc|last=Kaufman}}&lt;/ref&gt; in mathematics have been published only on [[arXiv]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv&lt;!-- Deny Citation Bot--&gt;|author=Perelman, Grisha|title=The entropy formula for the Ricci flow and its geometric applications|arxiv = math.DG/0211159|date=November 11, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nadejda Lobastova and Michael Hirst, [http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/maths-genius-living-in-poverty/2006/08/20/1156012411120.html "Maths genius living in poverty"], Sydney Morning Herald, August 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ''[[Journal des sçavans]]'' (later spelled ''Journal des savants''), established by [[Denis de Sallo]], was the earliest academic journal published in Europe. Its content included obituaries of famous men, church history, and legal reports.&lt;ref name="Dibner"/&gt; The first issue appeared as a twelve-page [[quarto]] [[pamphlet]]&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt; on Monday, 5 January 1665,&lt;ref name="hallam"/&gt; shortly before the first appearance of the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'', on 6 March 1665.&lt;ref name="royalsociety"/&gt;

At that time, the act of publishing academic inquiry was controversial and widely ridiculed. It was not at all unusual for a new discovery to be announced as an [[anagram]], reserving priority for the discoverer, but indecipherable for anyone not in on the secret: both [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] used this approach. However, this method did not work well. [[Robert K. Merton]], a sociologist, found that 92% of cases of simultaneous discovery in the 17th century ended in dispute. The number of disputes dropped to 72% in the 18th century, 59% by the latter half of the 19th century, and 33% by the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merton|first=Robert K.|date=December 1963|title=Resistance to the Systematic Study of Multiple Discoveries in Science|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-journal-of-sociology-archives-europeennes-de-sociologie/article/resistance-to-the-systematic-study-of-multiple-discoveries-in-science/8FEC108B3D8B0DAD60416B36BE342959|journal=European Journal of Sociology / Archives Européennes de Sociologie|volume=4|issue=2|pages=237–282|doi=10.1017/S0003975600000801|issn=1474-0583}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decline in contested claims for [[Scientific priority|priority]] in research discoveries can be credited to the increasing acceptance of the publication of papers in modern academic journals, with estimates suggesting that around 50 million journal articles&lt;ref name="autogenerated"/&gt; have been published since the first appearance of the ''Philosophical Transactions''. The [[Royal Society]] was steadfast in its not-yet-popular belief that science could only move forward through a transparent and open exchange of ideas backed by experimental evidence.

Early scientific journals embraced several models: some were run by a single individual who exerted editorial control over the contents, often simply publishing extracts from colleagues' letters, while others employed a group decision making process, more closely aligned to modern peer review. It wasn't until the middle of the 20th century that peer review became the standard.&lt;ref name="History of Scientific Publishing"&gt;{{cite podcast|url=http://blogs.plos.org/plospodcasts/2016/04/18/the-history-of-scientific-publishing-an-interview-with-aileen-fyfe/|title= The History of Scientific Publishing: An interview with Aileen Fyfe|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishers and business aspects==
{{See also|Academic journal#Costs|Scientific journal#Cost}}

In the 1960s and 1970s, commercial publishers began to selectively acquire "top-quality" journals that were previously published by nonprofit academic societies. When the commercial publishers raised the subscription prices significantly, they lost little of the market, due to the [[elasticity (economics)|inelastic]] demand for these journals. Although there are over 2,000 publishers, five for-profit companies ([[Reed Elsevier]], [[Springer Science+Business Media]], [[Wiley-Blackwell]], [[Taylor &amp; Francis]], and [[Sage Publications|Sage]]) accounted for 50% of articles published in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2015-06-companies-academic-publishing.html|title=Five companies control more than half of academic publishing |website=Phys.org |date=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Larivière |first=Vincent |last2=Haustein |first2=Stefanie |last3=Mongeon |first3=Philippe |date=10 June 2015 |title=The oligopoly of academic publishers in the digital era |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=10 |issue=6 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0127502 |pmid=26061978 |pmc=4465327 |pages=e0127502|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1027502L }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Since 2013, Springer Science+Business Media has undergone a merger to form an even bigger company named [[Springer Nature]].) Available data indicate that these companies have [[profit margin]]s of around 40% making it one of the most profitable industries,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science|title=Is the staggeringly profitable business of scientific publishing bad for science?|last=Buranyi|first=Stephen|date=27 June 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Time to break academic publishing’s stranglehold on research |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24032052-900-time-to-break-academic-publishings-stranglehold-on-research/ |accessdate=27 November 2018 |work=New Scientist |date=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially compared to the smaller publishers, which likely operate with low margins.&lt;ref name=Business2008/&gt; These factors have contributed to the "[[serials crisis]]" – total expenditures on serials increased 7.6% per year from 1986 to 2005, yet the number of serials purchased increased an average of only 1.9% per year.&lt;ref name="arl"/&gt;

Unlike most industries, in academic publishing the two most important inputs are provided "virtually free of charge".&lt;ref name=Business2008/&gt; These are the articles and the peer review process. Publishers argue that they add value to the publishing process through support to the peer review group, including stipends, as well as through typesetting, printing, and web publishing. Investment analysts, however, have been skeptical of the value added by for-profit publishers, as exemplified by a 2005 Deutsche Bank analysis which stated that "we believe the publisher adds relatively little value to the publishing process... We are simply observing that if the process really were as complex, costly and value-added as the publishers protest that it is,  40% margins wouldn't be available."&lt;ref name="Business2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science?CMP=share_btn_tw|title=Is the staggeringly profitable business of scientific publishing bad for science? |first=Stephen |last=Buranyi |date=2017-06-27 |work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-07-02|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crisis===
{{Main|Serials crisis}}

A crisis in academic publishing is "widely perceived";&lt;ref name=MLAFuture/&gt; the apparent crisis has to do with the combined pressure of budget cuts at universities and increased costs for journals (the [[serials crisis]]).&lt;ref name="Harvard University says it can't afford journal publishers' prices"/&gt; The university budget cuts have reduced library budgets and reduced subsidies to university-affiliated publishers. The humanities have been particularly affected by the pressure on university publishers, which are less able to publish [[monograph]]s when libraries can not afford to purchase them. For example, the ARL found that in "1986, libraries spent 44% of their budgets on books compared with 56% on journals; twelve years later, the ratio had skewed to 28% and 72%."&lt;ref name=MLAFuture/&gt; Meanwhile, monographs are increasingly expected for tenure in the humanities. In 2002 the Modern Language Association expressed hope that [[electronic publishing]] would solve the issue.&lt;ref name="MLAFuture"/&gt;

In 2009 and 2010, surveys and reports found that libraries faced continuing budget cuts, with one survey in 2009 finding that one-third of libraries had their budgets cut by 5% or more.&lt;ref name="libraryjournal"/&gt;

===Academic journal publishing reform===
{{Main|Academic journal publishing reform}}

Several models are being investigated, such as open publication models or adding community-oriented features.&lt;ref name="Reinventing Academic Publishing -Part 1"/&gt;
It is also considered that "Online scientific interaction outside the traditional journal space is becoming more and more important to academic communication".&lt;ref name="Reinventing Academic Publishing -Part 3"/&gt; In addition, experts have suggested measures to make the publication process more efficient in disseminating new and important findings by evaluating the worthiness of publication on the basis of the significance and novelty of the research finding.&lt;ref name="Peer Review for Journals: Evidence on Quality Control, Fairness, and Innovation"/&gt;

==Scholarly paper{{anchor|Scholarly paper}}==
{{See also|Scientific paper|Academic journal#Scholarly articles}}

In academic publishing, a paper is an academic work that is usually published in an [[academic journal]]. It contains original research results or reviews existing results. Such a paper, also called an article, will only be considered valid if it undergoes a process of [[peer review]] by one or more ''referees'' (who are academics in the same field) who check that the content of the paper is suitable for publication in the journal. A paper may undergo a series of reviews, revisions, and re-submissions before finally being accepted or rejected for publication. This process typically takes several months. Next, there is often a delay of many months (or in some subjects, over a year) before an accepted manuscript appears. This is particularly true for the most popular journals where the number of accepted articles often outnumbers the space for printing. Due to this, many academics [[self archiving|self-archive]] a '[[pre-print]]' copy of their paper for free download from their personal or institutional website.

Some journals, particularly newer ones, are now published in [[electronic journal|electronic form only]]. Paper journals are now generally made available in electronic form as well, both to individual subscribers, and to libraries. Almost always these electronic versions are available to subscribers immediately upon publication of the paper version, or even before; sometimes they are also made available to non-subscribers, either immediately (by [[open access journals]]) or after an [[embargo (academic publishing)|embargo]] of anywhere from two to twenty-four months or more, in order to protect against loss of subscriptions. Journals having this delayed availability are sometimes called [[delayed open access journal]]s. Ellison has reported that in economics the dramatic increase in opportunities to publish results online has led to a decline in the use of peer-reviewed articles.&lt;ref name="economic"/&gt;

===Categories of papers===

==Peer review==
{{Main|Academic peer review}}

Peer review is a central concept for most academic publishing; other scholars in a field must find a work sufficiently high in quality for it to merit publication. A secondary benefit of the process is an indirect guard against [[plagiarism]] since reviewers are usually familiar with the sources consulted by the author(s). The origins of routine peer review for submissions dates to 1752 when the Royal Society of London took over official responsibility for ''Philosophical Transactions.'' However, there were some earlier examples.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Kronick, "Peer review in 18th-century scientific journalism." ''JAMA'' (1990) 263#10 pp: 1321-1322.&lt;/ref&gt;

While journal editors largely agree the system is essential to quality control in terms of rejecting poor quality work, there have been examples of important results that are turned down by one journal before being taken to others. Rena Steinzor wrote:
{{quote|Perhaps the most widely recognized failing of peer review is its inability to ensure the identification of high-quality work. The list of important scientific papers that were initially rejected by peer-reviewed journals goes back at least as far as the editor of ''Philosophical Transaction's'' 1796 rejection of [[Edward Jenner]]'s report of the first [[vaccination]] against [[smallpox]].&lt;ref name="Rescuing Science from Politics: Regulation and the Distortion of Scientific ... - Google Books"/&gt; }}

"Confirmatory bias" is the unconscious tendency to accept reports which support the reviewer's views and to downplay those which do not. Experimental studies show the problem exists in peer reviewing.&lt;ref&gt;Mahoney, Michael J. "Publication prejudices: An experimental study of confirmatory bias in the peer review system." ''Cognitive therapy and research'' (1977) 1#2 pp: 161-175.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing process==
The process of academic publishing, which begins when authors submit a [[manuscript (publishing)|manuscript]] to a publisher, is divided into two distinct phases: peer review and production.

The process of peer review is organized by the journal editor and is complete when the content of the article, together with any associated images or figures, are accepted for publication. The peer review process is increasingly managed online, through the use of proprietary systems, commercial software packages, or open source and free software. A manuscript undergoes one or more rounds of review; after each round, the author(s) of the article modify their submission in line with the reviewers' comments; this process is repeated until the editor is satisfied and the work is accepted.

The production process, controlled by a production editor or publisher, then takes an article through [[copy editing]], [[typesetting]], inclusion in a specific issue of a journal, and then printing and online publication. Academic copy editing seeks to ensure that an article conforms to the journal's [[Style guide|house style]], that all of the referencing and labelling is correct, and that the text is consistent and legible; often this work involves substantive editing and negotiating with the authors.&lt;ref name="Iverson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Iverson |first=Cheryl |title="Copy editor" vs. "manuscript editor" vs...: venturing onto the minefield of titles |journal=Science Editor |year=2004 |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=39–41 |url=http://www.councilscienceeditors.org/files/scienceeditor/v27n2p039-041.pdf |accessdate=19 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203093821/http://www.councilscienceeditors.org/files/scienceeditor/v27n2p039-041.pdf |archivedate=3 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the work of academic copy editors can overlap with that of [[authors' editor]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Jager|first=Marije. Journal copy-editing in a non-anglophone environment. In: Matarese, Valerie (ed)|title=Supporting Research Writing: Roles and challenges in multilingual settings|year=2013|publisher=Chandos|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1843346661|pages=157–171}}&lt;/ref&gt; editors employed by journal publishers often refer to themselves as “manuscript editors”.&lt;ref name="Iverson" /&gt;

In much of the 20th century, such articles were photographed for printing into [[proceedings]] and journals, and this stage was known as ''[[camera-ready]]'' copy. With modern digital submission in formats such as [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], this photographing step is no longer necessary, though the term is still sometimes used.

The [[author]] will review and correct proofs at one or more stages in the production process. The proof correction cycle has historically been labour-intensive as handwritten comments by authors and editors are manually transcribed by a [[Proofreading|proof reader]] onto a clean version of the proof. In the early 21st century, this process was streamlined by the introduction of e-annotations in [[Microsoft Word]], [[Adobe Acrobat]], and other programs, but it still remained a time-consuming and error-prone process. The full automation of the proof correction cycles has only become possible with the onset of [[online]] [[collaborative writing]] platforms, such as [[Authorea]], [[Google Docs]], and various others, where a remote service oversees the [[copy-editing]] interactions of multiple authors and exposes them as explicit, actionable historic events.

==Citations==
{{Main|Citation}}

Academic authors cite sources they have used, in order to support their assertions and arguments and to help readers find more information on the subject. It also gives credit to authors whose work they use and helps avoid [[plagiarism]].

Each scholarly journal uses a specific format for citations (also known as references). Among the most common formats used in research papers are the [[APA style|APA]], [[The Chicago Manual of Style|CMS]], and [[The MLA Style Manual|MLA]] styles.

The American Psychological Association (APA) style is often used in the [[social science]]s. The Chicago Manual of Style (CMS) is used in [[business]], [[communications]], [[economics]], and [[social sciences]]. The CMS style uses footnotes at the bottom of page to help readers locate the sources. The [[The MLA Style Manual|Modern Language Association (MLA)]] style is widely used in the [[humanities]].

==Publishing by discipline==

===Natural sciences===
{{Main|Scientific literature}}

Scientific, technical, and medical (STM) literature is a large industry which generated $23.5 billion in revenue; $9.4 billion of that was specifically from the publication of English-language scholarly journals.&lt;ref name=stmReport/&gt; Most [[science|scientific]] [[research]] is initially published in [[scientific journal]]s and considered to be a [[primary source]]. [[Technical report]]s, for minor research results and engineering and design work (including computer software), round out the primary literature. [[Secondary source]]s in the sciences include articles in [[review journals]] (which provide a synthesis of research articles on a topic to highlight advances and new lines of research), and [[book]]s for large projects, broad arguments, or compilations of articles. [[Tertiary source]]s might include [[encyclopedia]]s and similar works intended for broad public consumption or academic libraries.

A partial exception to scientific publication practices is in many fields of applied science, particularly that of U.S. [[computer science]] research. An equally prestigious site of publication within U.S. computer science are some [[academic conference]]s.&lt;ref name="cra"/&gt; Reasons for this departure include a large number of such conferences, the quick pace of research progress, and computer science [[professional society]] support for the distribution and archiving of conference [[proceedings]].&lt;ref name="Why CHI Fragmented"/&gt;

===Social sciences===
Publishing in the [[social science]]s is very different in different fields. Some fields, like economics, may have very "hard" or highly quantitative standards for publication, much like the natural sciences. Others, like anthropology or sociology, emphasize [[field work]] and reporting on first-hand observation as well as quantitative work. Some social science fields, such as [[public health]] or [[demography]], have significant shared interests with professions like [[law]] and [[medicine]], and scholars in these fields often also publish in [[professional magazines]].&lt;ref&gt;Joel Best,  "Following the Money Across the Landscape of Sociology Journals." ''The American Sociologist'' (2015): 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanities===
Publishing in the [[humanities]] is in principle similar to publishing elsewhere in the academy; a range of journals, from general to extremely specialized, are available, and [[university press]]es issue many new humanities books every year.  The arrival of online publishing opportunities has radically transformed the economics of the field and the shape of the future is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Cathy Davidson,  "The futures of scholarly publishing." ''Journal of Scholarly Publishing'' (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike science, where timeliness is critically important, humanities publications often take years to write and years more to publish. Unlike the sciences, research is most often an individual process and is seldom supported by large grants. Journals rarely make profits and are typically run by university departments.&lt;ref&gt;Toby Miller, ''Blow Up the Humanities'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The following describes the situation in the United States. In many fields, such as literature and history, several published articles are typically required for a first [[tenure-track]] job, and a published or forthcoming ''book'' is now often required before tenure. Some critics complain that this ''de facto'' system has emerged without thought to its consequences; they claim that the predictable result is the publication of much shoddy work, as well as unreasonable demands on the already limited research time of young scholars. To make matters worse, the circulation of many humanities journals in the 1990s declined to almost untenable levels, as many libraries cancelled subscriptions, leaving fewer and fewer peer-reviewed outlets for publication; and many humanities professors' first books sell only a few hundred copies, which often does not pay for the cost of their printing. Some scholars have called for a [[publication subvention]] of a few thousand dollars to be associated with each [[graduate student]] [[fellow]]ship or new tenure-track hire, in order to alleviate the financial pressure on journals.

==Open access journals==
{{Main|Open access journal}}

An alternative to the subscription model of journal publishing is the open access journal model, which typically involves a [[Article Processing Charge|publication charge]] being paid by the author.&lt;ref&gt;For typical policies see [http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/scholarlycommunication/oa_fees.html UC Berkeley Library, "Selective List of Open Access Fees"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Prestige journals typically charge several thousand dollars. Oxford University Press, with over 300 journals, has fees ranging from  £1000-£2500, with discounts of 50% to 100% to authors from developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.oxfordjournals.org/oxfordopen/charges.html#Optional%20Author%20Publication%20Charges Oxford Open Pricing]&lt;/ref&gt;  Wiley Blackwell has 700 journals available, and they charge a flat $US3000 open access fee.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://authorservices.wiley.com/bauthor/onlineopen.asp Author Services]&lt;/ref&gt;  Springer, with over 2600 journals, charges US$3000 or EUR 2200 (excluding VAT).&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.springer.com/gp/open-access/springer-open-choice "Open Choice"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The online distribution of individual articles and academic journals then takes place without charge to readers and libraries. Most [[open access journal]]s remove all the financial, technical, and legal [http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/442-guid.html barriers] that limit access to academic materials to paying customers. The [[Public Library of Science]] and [[BioMed Central]] are prominent examples of this model.

Open access has been criticized on quality grounds, as the desire to maximize publishing fees could cause some journals to relax the standard of peer review. It may be criticized on financial grounds as well because the necessary publication fees have proven to be higher than originally expected. Open access advocates generally reply that because open access is as much based on peer reviewing as traditional publishing, the quality should be the same (recognizing that both traditional and open access journals have a range of quality). It has also been argued that good science done by academic institutions who cannot afford to pay for open access might not get published at all, but most open access journals permit the waiver of the fee for financial hardship or authors in [[Developing country|underdeveloped countries]]. In any case, all authors have the option of [[self-archiving]] their articles in their [[institutional repositories]] in order to make them [[open access (publishing)|open access]], whether or not they publish them in a journal.

If they publish in a [[Hybrid open access journal]], authors pay a subscription journal a publication fee to make their individual article open access. The other articles in such hybrid journals are either made available after a delay or remain available only by subscription. Most traditional publishers (including [[Wiley-Blackwell]], [[Oxford University Press]], and [[Springer Science+Business Media]]) have already introduced such a hybrid option, and more are following. Proponents of open access suggest that such moves by corporate publishers illustrate that open access, or a mix of open access and traditional publishing, can be financially viable, and evidence to that effect is emerging{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}. The fraction of the authors of a hybrid open access journal that make use of its open access option can, however, be small. It also remains unclear whether this is practical in fields outside the sciences, where there is much less availability of outside funding. In 2006, several [[funding agency|funding agencies]], including the [[Wellcome Trust]] and several divisions of the [[UK Research Councils|Research Councils]] in the UK announced the availability of extra funding to their grantees for such [[open access journal]] publication fees.

In May 2016, the Council for the European Union agreed that from 2020 all scientific publications as a result of publicly funded research must be freely available. It also must be able to optimally reuse research data. To achieve that, the data must be made accessible, unless there are well-founded reasons for not doing so, for example, intellectual property rights or security or privacy issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.eu2016.nl/latest/news/2016/05/27/all-european-scientific-articles-to-be-freely-accessible-by-2020|title=All European scientific articles to be freely accessible by 2020|last=Zaken|first=Ministerie van Buitenlandse|website=english.eu2016.nl|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/compet/2016/05/26-27/|title=Competitiveness Council, 26-27/05/2016 - Consilium|website=www.consilium.europa.eu|access-date=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth{{anchor|Growth}}==
In recent decades there has been a growth in academic publishing in [[developing country|developing countries]] as they become more advanced in science and technology. Although the large majority of scientific output and academic documents are produced in developed countries, the rate of growth in these countries has stabilized and is much smaller than the growth rate in some of the developing countries. The fastest scientific output growth rate over the last two decades has been in the Middle East and Asia with Iran leading with an 11-fold increase followed by the Republic of Korea, Turkey, Cyprus, China, and Oman.&lt;ref name="Iran showing fastest scientific growth of any country - science-in-society - 18 February 2010"/&gt; In comparison, the only [[G8]] countries in top 20 ranking with fastest performance improvement are, [[Italy]] which stands at tenth and [[Canada]] at 13th globally.&lt;ref name="2005 OST PSA report"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bulletin Board - Which nation's scientific output is rising fastest?"/&gt;

By 2004, it was noted that the output of scientific papers originating from the [[European Union]] had a larger share of the world's total from 36.6 to 39.3 percent and from 32.8 to 37.5 per cent of the "top one per cent of highly cited scientific papers".  However, the United States' output dropped 52.3 to 49.4 per cent of the world's total, and its portion of the top one percent dropped from 65.6 to 62.8 per cent.&lt;ref name="China, Brazil and India lead southern science output"/&gt;

Iran, China, [[India]], [[Brazil]], and [[South Africa]] were the only developing countries among the 31 nations that produced 97.5% of the most cited scientific articles in a study published in 2004. The remaining 162 countries contributed less than 2.5%.&lt;ref name="China, Brazil and India lead southern science output"/&gt; The [[Royal Society]] in a 2011 report stated that in share of English scientific research papers the United States was first followed by China, the UK, Germany, Japan, France, and Canada. The report predicted that China would overtake the United States sometime before 2020, possibly as early as 2013. China's scientific impact, as measured by other scientists citing the published papers the next year, is smaller although also increasing.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

The '''Alternative Center for Excellence''' ('''ACE'''), formerly the '''Alternative Center for Education''', is located in the former '''Locust Avenue School''' at 26 Locust Avenue in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], Connecticut, United States. It is an [[Alternative school|alternative]] high school within the city's school system, meant for at-risk students.

The building itself, a brick [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] structure, was designed by architect [[Warren R. Briggs]] in 1896, and later featured in his book ''Modern American School Buildings''.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv3"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=85001162}} |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Locust Avenue School |date=May 31, 1984 |author1=William E. Devlin |author2=Paulette Pepin |author3=John Herzan |publisher=National Park Service}} and {{NRHP url|id=85001162|title=''Accompanying 16 photos, exterior and interior, from 1984''|photos=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2,13}} For many years it was an [[elementary school]], and a [[laboratory school]] where recent graduates of the state's teacher training schools were sent to hone their skills with actual students before going to their ultimate teaching jobs.

Today it is the last nineteenth-century school building remaining in Danbury, and one of the few remaining laboratory school buildings in the state. It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1985.&lt;ref name="focus"/&gt;

==Building==
The school occupies a {{convert|1.1|acre|m2|adj=on}} lot at the north end of the block formed by Locust, Ninth and Roberts avenues in an otherwise residential neighborhood. [[Western Connecticut State University]], formerly the Danbury State Normal School where the teachers at the school were trained in its laboratory era, is a [[city block|block]] to the west. [[Main Street Historic District (Danbury, Connecticut)|Downtown Danbury]] is a mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) to the west-southwest, and [[Danbury Hospital]] is to the northwest along Locust.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv3" /&gt;{{rp|2}}

The terrain is level. Paved parking lots abut the school on the south and west. The entire site is landscaped, with trees planted shortly after the school was opened to honor veterans of the [[Spanish–American War]].&lt;ref name="nrhpinv3" /&gt;{{rp|2}}

The building itself is a {{convert|60|by|86|ft|m|adj=on}} two-story structure of [[Brickwork#American bond|common bond]] orange-red brick on a raised basement topped by a slate-shingled [[hip roof]]. Modillioned [[galvanization|galvanized]] sheet metal is along the [[eave]]s. At the top of the roof is an orange wooden [[cupola]] with octagonal rounded roof supported by round arches with keys and surrounded by a [[balustrade]] with [[chamfer]]ed [[newel]]s and pointed [[finial]]s. A stone [[water table]] runs around the building at the level of the top of the entrance steps.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv3" /&gt;{{rp|2}}

On both east and west [[facade]]s are a nearly identical projecting two-story [[pavilion]] with a central [[pediment]] with returns. The centrally located entrances, reached by a set of stone steps, are double doors in concentric recessed round arches. A projecting [[bay window]] on the west side, facing Roberts Avenue, is the only difference between the two.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv3" /&gt;{{rp|2–3}}

Inside both entrances lead into [[vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]]s with hooks for hanging coats. Four classrooms are on each floor, two on each side of the central hall, with three-foot (1 m) [[wainscoting]] of [[tongue and groove]] North Carolina [[pine]]. Partitions within the rooms are all brick. Each is lit by six tall windows and floored in pine similar to the wainscoting. The blackboards above the wainscoting have their original [[turning (woodworking)|turned]] trim.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv3" /&gt;{{rp|3}}

The supporting beams in the ceilings are exposed. They are reinforced at the joints by cast iron columns with decorative floral bases. Also exposed along the upper walls are the copper heating pipes with their original brass fittings run; spaces in the ceiling above that originally helped to ventilate the building have been boarded over to comply with modern [[Fire safety#Fire code|fire codes]].&lt;ref name="nrhpinv3" /&gt;{{rp|3}}

In the basement, designed to be fully functional, windows provide similar natural illumination. Brick partitions are pierced with rounded arches, and large brick piers with [[corbel]]ed tops support the ceiling. The walls are decorated with student artwork. The cooking facilities, sink and bathroom stalls are all original. The original 1894 Gurney furnace remains in operation to supplement the modern furnace.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv3" /&gt;{{rp|3}}

==History==
The Town of Danbury, which at that time was in charge of education, built the school in response to growing population on the city's eastern fringe following the [[land subdivision|subdivision]] of the former White Farm in that area. Development on Locust Avenue took off, complemented by new streets like Ninth Avenue. Children in the area had to walk a long distance to the Balmforth Street School. Architect [[Warren Briggs]] had already designed a sister school on Morris Street on the other side of the city.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv3" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

His design, with [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] touches, incorporated his advanced ideas on school construction, primarily that school buildings should be visually appealing. Classrooms were arranged so that the abundant [[Sunlight|natural light]] came over the student's left shoulder. The ventilation and high ceilings kept them airy as well as bright, with space for classes of 50–60 students as was common at the time. The basement was meant to be used as a play space when weather outside was not suitable. In 1899 the Locust Avenue School was one of Briggs' featured designs in his ''Modern American School Buildings''.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv3" /&gt;{{rp|7–8}}

The Danbury Building Company constructed the new school for $23,000 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|23000|1896|r=-3}}}} in contemporary dollars{{Inflation-fn|US}}). After a short delay, students began their spring term there in April 1896. The 150 [[first grade|first]] and [[second grade|second]] graders had previously attended either Liberty Street or Balmforth. The school's first graduating class planted the trees in honor of veterans of the recent [[Spanish–American War]].&lt;ref name="nrhpinv3" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

Within a decade, in 1905, administration was transferred to the nearby Danbury State [[Normal School]] (now [[Western Connecticut State University]]. Students there were required to [[student teacher|teach]], observe or manage for two weeks of the school year at either Locust Avenue or the [[one-room schoolhouse|one-room]] King Street School in the city's northwestern corner. Over time other Danbury schools were included as well, but Locust Avenue remained one of them.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv3" /&gt;{{rp|7}}

The state's [[Connecticut State Department of Education|Department of Education]] continued to staff the school, and the Town of Danbury to maintain it, until 1965. In that year city and town governments were consolidated and control of the school was turned over to the Danbury Board of Education. It continued to be used as an elementary school until 1976. By that time, all of the other schools Danbury had built in the 19th century had been demolished. Statewide, only two other laboratory schools, in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], remain.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv3" /&gt;{{rp|7}}

The next year, 1977, it was reused as what was originally known as the Alternative Center for Education, a program for [[at-risk students]]. A few years later, the building's heating, cooling and ventilation systems, the first of which had been converted from coal to oil in the 1920s, were upgraded to comply with modern building codes. There have been few other changes to the building in its lifetime.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv3" /&gt;{{rp|8}}

==Program==
The Alternative Center for Excellence keeps class sizes low, with a [[student-teacher ratio]] of about 10:1. Approximately a hundred students are in the program in each year. They are divided into nine [[School counselor|guidance]] groups, with each teacher responsible for about ten students.&lt;ref name="ACE history page" /&gt;

Applicants come for a two-day visit, submit three [[letter of recommendation|letters of recommendation]] and do 15 hours of [[community service]]. Afterwards, they are interviewed along with their parents by students and staff. They must demonstrate to the program's satisfaction that they are willing to attend school regularly and devote themselves to academic improvement.&lt;ref name="ACE history page" /&gt;

Over 500 students have completed the program since it was inaugurated. They must meet [[Danbury High School]]'s graduation requirements, and receive a [[diploma]] from it. They attend both the high school's [[graduation]] ceremonies as well as ACE's.

The school's location has been considered a factor in its success. It is a short walk from both the commercial areas on White Street, where many students work after school, and Roberts Avenue School, where many serve as reading [[tutor]]s. For these reasons the program has remained at the Locust Avenue building, helping to [[historic preservation|preserve]] it.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv3" /&gt;{{rp|7}}

'''Anthony Froshaug''' (1920–84) was an [[England|English]] [[typography|typographer]], designer and teacher, born in [[London]] to a Norwegian father and English mother.

Influenced by ideas of European modernism, particularly the work of [[Jan Tschichold]], Froshaug is considered by some to be the most convincing exponent of [[modern typography]] in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;wwword on design: [http://wwword.com/2107/style/on-design/anthony-froshaug/ ANTHONY FROSHAUG]&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthony Froshaug's archive is located at the [[University of Brighton Design Archives]].&lt;ref&gt;University of Brighton Design Archives, [http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/collections/design-archives/archives/anthony-froshaug-archive2 Anthony Froshaug Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Froshaug attended [[Charterhouse School]] and studied [[book design|book production]] and [[wood engraving]] at the [[Central School of Art|Central School of Arts &amp; Crafts]] from 1937 to 1939.

== Career ==

=== Design and typography ===
On leaving the Central in 1939 he began to practice as a freelance graphic designer and typographer. As a typographer, he has been viewed as unusual in running his own small (un-private) press, including two periods of printing in [[Cornwall]] (1949–52, 1954–7). He worked with [[Alan Kitching (Typographic artist)|Alan Kitching]].

=== Teaching===
Froshaug was a natural teacher: he taught typography, first at the Central School (1948–9, 1952–3), then at the [[Hochschule für Gestaltung Ulm]] (1957–61),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisisdisplay.org/collection/large/Journal_of_the_Hochschule_fur_Gestaltung_ulm_4 Ulm 4], Quarterly bulletin of the Hochschule für Gestaltung, Ulm, c. April 1959&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Royal College of Art]] in London (1961–4), Watford School of Art (1964–6); in 1970 he returned to teach (part-time) at the Central School, continuing there until illness forced him to stop. He later also taught at the [[London College of Printing]] Department of Art and Design from 1980–82.

As both a practitioner and a teacher, Froshaug preferred an experimental workshop environment with opportunities for discussion, rather than more formal learning structures.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Froshaug on the [http://archiveshub.ac.uk/data/gb1837-des/afg Archives Hub]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arboricultural Association''' is the largest body in the UK for the [[amenity tree]] [[tree care|care]] professional ([[arboriculturalist]]s).

==Structure==
There are over 2300 Arboricultural Association members and is recognised by local Government, the RHS and increasingly the general public as the focal point for best practice in arboriculture . It has a membership program linked to the [[Qualifications and Credit Framework]] It is represented on a number of national bodies including the [[Tree Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trees.org.uk/about-us/background_information|title=Background Information|publisher=Arboricultural Association | accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a registered charity, charity number 1083845.

It is situated on the B4008 in [[Standish, Gloucestershire|Stroud Green]], north of [[Stonehouse, Gloucestershire|Stonehouse]].
The address is The Malthouse, Stroud Green, Standish, Stonehouse, Gloucestershire GL10 3DL

==Function==
It regulates the education and qualifications of tree surgeons in the UK.
The Arboriculture Association continually strives to raise awareness of the importance of urban and amenity trees and gives a voice to everyone working within the wide and varied industry. Working with the Arboriculture Association allows the progression of the disciplines of arboriculture and makes our villages, towns and cities greener.
Membership with the AA provides support and benefits which are tailored to the members needs as they progress through a career in arboriculture. Members have access to a wide range of benefits, along with the opportunity to get involved with the key developments and decisions in the industry and make their voices heard.

==History==
The AA was founded in 1964 as a scientific and educational organisation, keen to promote the care and value of trees in no forest settings. The passion for trees shown by the founders at that time continues to exist in our Board and members today. 
Following initial discussions between Keith Ross, Don Wells and other interested parties, the Arboricultural Association is formed, and in the same year the Association of British Tree Surgeons and Arborists (ABTSA) is also formed.
In May 1965 Issue 1 of Volume 1 of The Arboricultural Association Journal was published. In this year the AA was also involved in developing new tree-related standards and documents including BS3936:1965 Nursery Stock - Trees and Shrubs; BS3998:1966 ‘Recommendations for Tree Work’ and BS4043:1966 Semi-Mature Trees. The first AA Advisory Leaflet ‘Tree Preservation Orders’ is also published.
In 1974 at the Arboricultural Annual Conference at Merrist Wood College, the AA and ABTSA formally merge to become the ‘new’ AA incorporating ABTSA. Don Wells reported that the Scottish Branch had been very active since 1971. Don Wells reported “A register of Consultants has been drawn up and well established” and that the AA were involved in preparartion of Bristish Standards for ‘Extra Heavy Trees’ and ‘Tree Roots and Construction’.

A '''charrette''' (American pronunciation: {{IPAc-en|ʃ|ɑː|ˈ|ɹ|ɛ|t|}}), often Anglicized to '''charette''' or '''charet''' and sometimes called a '''design charrette''', is an intense period of [[design]] or [[planning]] activity.

==Origins of the term "charrette"==
The word ''charrette'' is [[French language|French]] for "[[cart]]" or "[[chariot]]." Its use in the sense of design and planning arose in the 19th century at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Paris]], where it was not unusual at the end of a term for teams of student architects to work right up until a deadline, when a charrette would be wheeled among them to collect up their scale models and other work for review. Their continued working furiously to apply the finishing touches came to be referred to as working ''en charrette'', "in the cart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonda|first=Penny|title=Sustainable Commercial Interiors|year=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=smbC2VdZE5MC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Zola]] depicted such a scene of feverish activity, a ''nuit de charrette'' or "charrette night," in ''[[L'Œuvre]]'' (serialized 1885, published 1886), his fictionalized account of his friendship with [[Paul Cézanne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gendrat|first=Aurélie|title=Émile Zola, L'Œuvre|year=1999|publisher=Bréal|page=56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y5bLDsrgErkC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term evolved into the current design-related usage in conjunction with working right up until a deadline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The NCI Charrette System|url=http://www.charretteinstitute.org/charrette.html|publisher=Charrette Institute|accessdate=February 12, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126100645/http://www.charretteinstitute.org/charrette.html|archivedate=November 26, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--In the 16th, 17th, and 18th century when travel took long periods, a ''charrette'' referred to long carriage rides{{cn}}, in which politicians and policy makers would be sequestered together in order to collaborate in solving a set problem over the duration of their journey. This origin is most similar to the current usage of the word in the design world.--&gt;

==Charrettes in general==

The word ''charrette'' may refer to any collaborative session in which a group of [[designers]] drafts a solution to a design problem.

While the structure of a charrette varies, depending on the design problem and the individuals in the group, charrettes often take place in multiple sessions in which the group divides into sub-groups.  Each sub-group then presents its work to the full group as material for further [[dialogue]]. Such charrettes serve as a way of quickly generating a design solution while integrating the aptitudes and interests of a diverse group of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govanpartick.com/what.html|title=Govan Partick Charrette|website=www.govanpartick.com|accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the structure of charrettes may vary, the general idea of a charrette is to create an innovative atmosphere in which a diverse group of stakeholders can collaborate to "generate visions for the future".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-007-7031-7_2|title=The Design Charrette|last=Roggema|first=Rob|date=2014|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789400770300|editor-last=Roggema|editor-first=Rob|pages=15–34|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-7031-7_2#page-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compare this term with [[workshop]].

==Specific cases of charrette==
Charrettes take place in many disciplines, including [[land use planning]], or [[urban planning]].  In planning, the charrette has become a technique for consulting with all [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]].  This type of charrette (sometimes called an enquiry by design) typically involves intense and possibly multi-day meetings, involving [[municipal]] officials, [[real estate developer|developer]]s, and residents.  A successful charrette promotes joint ownership of solutions and attempts to defuse typical confrontational attitudes between residents and developers.  Charrettes tend to involve small groups, however the residents participating  may not represent all the residents nor have the [[moral authority]] to represent them.  Residents who do participate get early input into the planning process.   For developers and municipal officials charrettes achieve community involvement, may satisfy [[Public consultation|consultation]] criteria, with the objective of avoiding costly legal battles.  Other uses of the term "charrette" occur within an academic or [[profession]]al setting, whereas urban planners invite the general public to their planning charrettes.  Thus most people (unless they happen to be design students) encounter the term "charrette" in an urban-planning context.

In fields of [[design]] such as [[architecture]], [[landscape architecture]], [[industrial design]], [[interior design]], [[interaction design]], or [[graphic design]], the term ''charrette'' may refer to an intense period of work by one person or a group of people prior to a deadline. The period of a charrette typically involves both focused and sustained effort. The word "charrette" may also be used as a verb, as in, for example, "I am charretting" or "I am on charrette [or: en charrette]," simply meaning I am working long nights, intensively toward a deadline.

An example of a charrette occurred in Florida in 1973 when the future residents of the [[Miccosukee Land Co-op]] in Tallahassee traveled by auto caravan to Orlando and spent the weekend at the offices of the King Helie Planning Group of Orlando (sleeping on the floor) working with its staff to develop the community's land use plans; features desired by individual members and acceptable to the group included a perfectly circular lot, a huge treehouse lot, and streets named after Beatles songs (such as "The Long and Winding Road". "Penny Lane", "Abbey Road"). A more recent example, from [[New College of Florida]], is their Master Plan Design Charrettes that took place over a week in 2005 involving students, alumni, administrators, professors, area residents, and local government staff members as well as architects, designers, and planners from Moule &amp; Polyzoides, The Folsom Group, the Florida House Institute for Sustainable Development, Hall Planning &amp; Engineering, and Biohabitats in a process to make long-range suggestions for the campus layout, landscaping, architecture, and transportation corridors of the master plan for its campus.

In some cases, a charrette may be held on a recurring basis, such as the annual charrette held by the Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning department at Utah State University. Each February, the faculty choose a site in partnership with communities and groups throughout Utah, and hold an intense 5-day design charrette focusing on particular issues in that community or region. The charrette begins with a field visit, followed by all-day work sessions accompanied by project stakeholders and volunteer landscape architects and other professionals, and overseen by senior and graduate level students. The final work is then presented to the community. Charrettes such as these offer students and professionals the opportunity to work together in a close setting on real-world design scenarios, and often provide communities with tens of thousands of dollars of design work for free.

The Schools of Architecture at [[Rice University]] and at the [[University of Virginia]] call the last week before the end of classes ''Charrette''.&lt;ref name="Kemmer2008"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Suzanne Kemmer |title=Charrette: Neologisms |url=https://neologisms.rice.edu/index.php?a=term&amp;d=1&amp;t=11504 |website=neologisms.rice.edu |publisher=Rice University |accessdate=16 September 2018 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20180916151329/https://neologisms.rice.edu/index.php?a=term&amp;d=1&amp;t=11504 |archivedate=September 16, 2018 |location=Houston, Texas |language=en |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maital2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shlomo Maital|title=Innovate Your Innovation Process: 100 Proven Tools|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2-exDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA103|year=2016|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-4759-95-3|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the final deadline time (assigned by the school), all students must put their "pencils down" and stop working. Students then present their work to fellow students and faculty in a [[critique]]d presentation.

Many municipalities around the world develop long-term city plans or visions through multiple charrettes - both communal and professional.  Notable successes on the west coast of Canada include the city of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}, as well as the District of Tofino. Tofino won an Award of Excellence in Planning after a successful multi-day charrette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityspaces.ca/project/tofino-downtown-vitalization-plan/|title=Award-Winning Tofino Downtown Vitalization Plan -|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2301">'''Christine Panushka''' is an independent filmmaker, freelance animator, artist and teacher. She is a Professor in the [[John Hench Division of Animation and Digital Arts]] at the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]].

==Biography==
Panushka received her MFA in Experimental Animation from the [[California Institute of the Arts]] in 1983. During her studies at CalArts, she was mentored under [[Jules Engel]] and [[Don Levy]]. With Dr. [[William Moritz]], she taught a class called "The Aesthetics of Experimental Animation", which was offered only one time. They were expanding on the scholarly writing of the topic of experimental animation, a subject in which little had been written until that time. In the late 1990s, she was associate director of that same program. She has also taught animation to talented high school students at [[California State Summer School for the Arts]].

Her film work includes ''Nighttime Fears and Fantasies: A Bedtime Tale for a Young Girl'' and ''The Sum of Them''. She is also the creator of the award-winning website [http://www.iotacenter.org/visualmusic/articles/moritz/Absolut/ ''Absolut Panushka''], which featured artwork by [[Priit Pärn]], [[Jules Engel]], [[Kihachiro Kawamoto]], [[Ruth Hayes]], [[The DeNoojiers]] and others, during its premiere. The site is no longer active, but an archive of the pages is maintained by the [[iotaCenter]], an organization dedicated to the exhibition and preservation of abstract and experimental animation.

It was founded in 1997 by Charles Willett (1932-2012), as a project of the AIP Task Force&lt;ref&gt;http://libr.org/amtf/&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[American Library Association]]'s Social Responsibilities Round Table.&lt;ref&gt;http://libr.org/srrt/&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2001, Counterpoise became a project of the [[Civic Media Center]] (an alternative library also located in Gainesville, [[Florida]]). Counterpoise magazine focused on marginalized publications—books, magazines, and films on controversial topics or viewpoints that are not adequately represented in American mainstream press. The magazine was released on a quarterly basis; one issue each year was a double issue.

Counterpoise operated as a [[collective]], wherein all members participated in the process of creating and publishing the magazine. The Collective was composed of volunteers and student interns from the [[University of Florida]] and [[Florida State University]]. The magazine was distributed throughout the US, Canada, [[Great Britain]], and [[Europe]]; subscribers and contributors came from a wide range of fields and included historians, journalists, librarians, teachers, and activists of all stripes. Both the CMC and Counterpoise are [[non-profit organization]]s.

In 2011, Charles Willett retired as founding editor and publication of the journal ceased. Back issues can still be ordered through the CMC.

Former volunteers from the Counterpoise collective and the CMC produce a weekly talk radio show for Gainesville's low power FM station [[WGOT-LP]] 94.7, which began broadcasting in January 2008. The show (Counterpoise Radio) airs locally on Fridays at 2pm.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10751">[[File:E-learning.jpg|thumb|A digital learning environment]]'''Digital scholarship''' is the use of digital evidence, methods of inquiry, research, publication and preservation to achieve scholarly and research goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rumsey|first=Abby|title=New-Model Scholarly Communication: Road Map for Change|url=http://www.uvasci.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/SCI9-report.pdf|work=Scholarly Communication Institute 9|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=30 July 2013|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital scholarship can encompass both [[scholarly communication]] using digital media and research on [[digital media]]. An important aspect of digital scholarship is the effort to establish digital media and [[social media]] as credible, professional and legitimate means of research and communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Challenges of Digital Scholarship|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/the-challenges-of-digital-scholarship/38103|accessdate=30 July 2013|newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital scholarship has a close association with [[digital humanities]], though the relationship between these terms is unclear.

Digital scholarship may also include [[born-digital]] means of scholarly communication that are more traditional, like online journals and databases, e-mail correspondence and the digital or digitized collections of research and [[academic libraries]]. Since digital scholarship is concerned with the production and distribution of digital media, discussions about [[copyright]], [[fair use]] and [[digital rights management]] (DRM) frequently accompany academic analysis of the topic. Combined with [[open access]], digital scholarship is offered as a more affordable and open model for scholarly communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hornby|first=Amanda|title=Digital scholarship and scholarly communication|url=http://www.uwb.edu/getattachment/tlc/faculty/teaching-resources/newmedia/scholarlycommunicationhandout.pdf|publisher=University of Washington Libraries|accessdate=30 July 2013|author2=Leslie Bussert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

{{Empty section|date=April 2014}}

==Outlook==
According to [https://depts.washington.edu/gs630/Spring/Boyer.pdf Ernest L. Boyer in Scholarship Reconsidered], discovery, integration, application, and teaching are the four main aspects of scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, Nick; Scanlon, Eileen; Weller, Martin; Ashleigh, Melanie;. ' ' Digital Scholarship Considered.' ' In Education, p. 35. [http://ineducation.couros.ca/index.php/ineducation/article/view/44/509]&lt;/ref&gt;  The growth of digital media means that the main areas of scholarship can each benefit from expansions in their own way thanks to the infinite sharability of digital content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1  = Feeney| first1 = Mary| last2  = Ross| first2 = Seamus| lastauthoramp = yes| title   = Information Technology in Humanities Scholarship, British Achievements, Prospects, and Barriers | journal = Historical Social Research| volume  = 19| issue   = 1 (69)| year    = 1994| pages = 3–59| jstor = 20755828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In education, the main areas of relevance are science, technology, engineering and math.  It is said that students learn best in a classroom when they are actively engaged.  The emergence of digital scholarship and digital media allows for another means for students to become engaged.  Key areas of academia that digital media is used on are to illustrate concepts, model displays and reinforce 21st century skills.&lt;ref&gt;Teachers' domain: digital media (including video!) resources for the STEM classroom and collection. 2010. Knowledgeable Quest, 39 (2).&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics cite concerns about the legitimacy, accessibility and verifiability of digital scholarship and the erosion of authors' rights as reasons to be concerned about digital scholarship. As scholarly communication evolves, controversy over the definition and value of the term "digital scholarship" is likely to continue.

Digital scholarship must take all of cultural, economic, personal, and institutional responsibilities to take its position as academic scholarship and to realize the core purpose of higher education with the possibilities of our time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ayers|first=Edward L.|title=Does Digital Scholarship Have a Future?|url=https://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ERM1343.pdf|accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual property==
Concerns with how to regulate digital scholarship have arisen across universities across the world. The explosion in availability and creation of scholarly works has led many universities to adjust their policies on how they will manage scholarship in the future. These universities feel pressured to take action because digital technologies have led to the easy reproduction and commodification of these creations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ross|first=Sheri|title=Intellectual Property Policies in Academe: Issues and Concerns with Digital Scholarship|journal=Proceedings of the Charleston Library Conference|year=2012|url=https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1389&amp;context=charleston|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many universities are unclear how to address the copyrighting of online classes and media presentations. Current law does not cover these specific areas of media produced in the academic world.&lt;ref name=IP&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ross|first=Sheri V.T.|title=Intellectual Property Policies in Academe: Issues and Concerns with Digital Scholarship|journal=Proceedings of the Charleston Library Conference|year=2012|url=https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1389&amp;context=charleston|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past any printed work done by professors was considered their intellectual property, but now the question stands as to who owns these different forms of multimedia. One of the main concerns of faculty is that universities will soon take ownership of this digital media.

Universities have taken a growing interest in creations that have revenue-generating potential, like online classes or lecture slides, while also showing concern for products that may be used by comparable institutions, potentially reducing their competitive advantage.&lt;ref name=IP /&gt; In order to stay on top of others academically, universities have sought to keep the intellectual property created within the university away from others schools. Not only are universities using digital scholarship to make money and stay ahead, but they also have interests in protecting their brand.&lt;ref name=IP /&gt;

While universities attempt to protect digital scholarship, it is in many professors best interests for their creations to be seen by the world as to grow their brand and acclaim as a professor. Laws that may apply to digital scholarship are largely outdated but professors would like to use the argument of faculty ownership of traditional works as historical practice and practice compatible with mission of higher education as a public good.&lt;ref name=IP /&gt; Professors argue that it took time and serious effort to make the presentations, slides, media.&lt;ref name=IP /&gt; To date professors have been rarely questioned whether they have the right to bring their course outlines, lecture outlines, and lecture notes with them if they decide to leave the university where they created them.&lt;ref name=IP /&gt; Change over the ability of professors to bring digital scholarship with them is expected as universities have begun to take notice and assert copyrights.&lt;ref name=IP /&gt; Professors will argue that since they are the creators and authors of the product they are the owners according to law.

As of now most copyright laws in America indicate that the author or creator holds the copyright, but the same cannot be said for digital scholarship. The law explicitly states that if the work is within the scope of his or her employment then the work is the property of the employer.&lt;ref name=IP /&gt; Since the employer here would be the university, professors are technically creating [[work for hire]]. While faculty of universities appear to not be credited for their work, the primary reason for a university to take ownership of a faculty's work is that the member created the work using university funds mostly.&lt;ref name=IP /&gt; Solutions to the lack of clear laws regarding ownership of digital scholarship are not currently being created but many universities have created written contracts with professors over who owns future work or what they can do with previous work.

For example, in the U.S. Supreme Court case ''[[Stanford v. Roche]]'', the court decided that Roche, a former Stanford researcher, was a co-owner with Stanford of patents for testing kits to detect  HIV.&lt;ref name=Stand&gt;{{cite web|last=Lapin|first=Lisa|title=Stanford 'disappointed' in Supreme Court ruling in Roche case|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2011/june/court-roche-ruling-060711.html|publisher=Stanford News|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this case does not deal with digital scholarship directly, it deals with the ownership of intellectual property of university employees when they leave. This case will set a precedent for future decisions with online classes, lecture notes, and outlines.

==NEA Policy==
The [[National Education Association]] (NEA), the largest professional educational association in the United States, updated its policy on digital learning in 2013. The policy stresses that students need to develop "advanced critical thinking and information literacy skills and master new digital tools," as well as "the initiative to become self-directed learners while adapting to the ever-changing digital information landscape." The NEA also believes that digital learning creates an environment in which learning can be more individualized to meet the needs of each student. The NEA mandates that all public schools must do their best to acquire necessary modern technologies and constantly revise teaching plans to incorporate technology where viable to best prepare students for the 21st century. The NEA's digital learning policy also states that technology must be used in an adaptive manner as to not become a distraction and to remain a tool, as well as that technology should not become a replacement for instructors, merely a supplement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NEA Policy Statement on Digital Learning|url=http://www.nea.org/home/55434.htm|publisher=National Education Association|accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fisher v. University of Texas''''', 570 U.S. ___ (2013), also known as '''''Fisher I''''' (to distinguish it from [[Fisher v. University of Texas (2016)|the 2016 case]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-981_4g15.pdf |title= No. 14–981 Fisher v. University of Tex. at Austin |publisher=[[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] |date=June 23, 2016 |accessdate=June 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case concerning the [[Affirmative action in the United States|affirmative action]] [[College admissions in the United States#Race and ethnicity|admissions policy]] of the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. The Supreme Court voided the lower appellate court's ruling in favor of the University and [[Remand (court procedure)|remanded]] the case, holding that the lower court had not applied the standard of [[strict scrutiny]], articulated in ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'' (2003) and ''[[Regents of the University of California v. Bakke]]'' (1978), to its admissions program. The Court's ruling in ''Fisher'' took ''Grutter'' and ''Bakke'' as given and did not directly revisit the constitutionality of using race as a factor in college admissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-345_l5gm.pdf |title= Abigail Noel Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin (Case 11-345) |publisher= The Supreme Court of the United States }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The suit, brought by undergraduate Abigail Fisher in 2008, asked that the Court declare the University's race-conscious admissions inconsistent with ''Grutter'', which had in 2003 established that race had an appropriate but limited role in the admissions policies of [[List of state universities in the United States|public universities]]. While reasserting that any consideration of race must be "[[Narrow tailoring|narrowly tailored]]", with ''Fisher'' the Court did not go on to overrule ''Grutter'', a relief for political activists who feared that the Court would end affirmative action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Liptak|first=Adam|title=Justices Step Up Scrutiny of Race in College Entry|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/25/us/affirmative-action-decision.html?hp&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=25 June 2013| work =  New York Times|date=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States District Court heard ''Fisher v. University of Texas'' in 2009 and upheld the legality of the University's admission policy in a [[summary judgment]]. The case was appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth Circuit]] which also ruled in the University's favor. The Supreme Court agreed on February 21, 2012, to hear the [[List of United States Supreme Court cases|case]]. Justice [[Elena Kagan]] recused herself because she served as the Solicitor General when the Department of Justice filed an ''amicus curiae'', or friend-of-the-court, brief in the Fisher case when it was pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. On June 24, 2013, the Fifth Circuit's decision was vacated, and the case remanded for further consideration in a 7–1 decision, with Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] dissenting. Justices [[Antonin Scalia]] and [[Clarence Thomas]] filed concurring opinions.

Applying the Supreme Court's 2013 decision, the Fifth Circuit once again found for UT Austin in 2014.  Fisher again appealed the Fifth Circuit's decision, and in 2016 the Supreme Court [[Fisher v. University of Texas (2016)|upheld the lower court in a 4–3 decision]].

== Background ==
Plaintiffs Abigail Noel Fisher and Rachel Multer Michalewicz applied to the University of Texas at Austin in 2008 and were denied admission. The two women, both white, filed suit, alleging that the University had discriminated against them on the basis of their race in violation of the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Richey |first=Warren|title =Affirmative action in college admissions goes back before Supreme Court|url = http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2012/0221/Affirmative-action-in-college-admissions-goes-back-before-Supreme-Court|  work =The [[Christian Science Monitor]]|date=February 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time that the initial lawsuit was filed, the University of Texas at Austin accepted students in the top 10% of each Texas high school's graduating class, regardless of their race; under [[Texas House Bill 588]], 81% of 2008's freshman class were admitted under the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wermiel|first=Stephen|title=SCOTUS for law students: Barbara Grutter, meet Abigail Fisher|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/?p=129451|publisher=SCOTUSblog|date=October 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Starting with the fall 2010 admission class, Senate Bill 175 adjusted this rule to the top 7 percent, but with no more than 75 percent of freshman slots filled under automatic admissions.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

&lt;/ref&gt;

Applicants who, like Fisher, failed to gain acceptance by automatic admissions can still gain admission by scoring highly in a process that evaluates their talents, leadership qualities, family circumstances, and race.&lt;ref name="AS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2012/05/the-other-big-supreme-court-case.html | title=The Other Big Supreme Court Case | work= The New Yorker | author= Jeffrey Toobin }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher had a [[grade point average]] of 3.59 (adjusted to a 4.0 scale)&lt;ref name="JointAppendix65"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.utexas.edu/vp/irla/Documents/Joint%20Appendix.pdf |title= Joint Appendix, Abigail Noel Fisher v.

Austin High School]].&lt;ref name="JointAppendix65"/&gt; She scored 1180 on her [[SAT]] (measured on the old 1600-point scale, because UT Austin did not consider the writing section in its undergraduate admissions decision for the 2008 incoming freshman class).&lt;ref name="JointAppendix65"/&gt; The 25th and 75th percentiles of the incoming class at UT-Austin were 1120 and 1370.&lt;ref name="JointAppendix65"/&gt; She was involved in the orchestra and math competitions and volunteered at [[Habitat for Humanity]].&lt;ref name="JointAppendix65"/&gt;

During the case proceedings, Fisher enrolled at [[Louisiana State University]], from which Fisher graduated in 2012 with a degree in finance.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyTexanFeb21/&gt; In 2011, Michalewicz withdrew from the case, leaving Fisher as the sole plaintiff.&lt;ref name="AS"/&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyTexanFeb21&gt;{{cite news|title=Fisher v.

== Lower courts ==
In 2009, [[United States District Court for the Western District of Texas|United States District Court]] judge [[Sam Sparks]] upheld the University's policy, finding that it meets the standards laid out in ''Grutter v. Bollinger''.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; That decision was affirmed by a Fifth Circuit panel composed of judges [[Patrick Higginbotham]], [[Carolyn Dineen King]] and [[Emilio M. Garza]]. In his ruling, Higginbotham wrote that the "ever-increasing number of minorities gaining admission under this 'Top Ten Percent Law' casts a shadow on the horizon to the otherwise-plain legality of the ''Grutter-like'' admissions program, the Law's own legal footing aside".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Abigail Fisher, et al. v.

A request for a full-court [[en banc]] hearing was denied by a 9–7 vote by circuit judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last =Farmer|first=Liz| title=U.S. Supreme Court to hear case on UT admission policies | url= http://www.dailytexanonline.com/news/2012/02/21/us-supreme-court-hear-case-ut-admission-policies| work = The Daily Texan |date=February 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/09/09-50822-CV1.wpd.pdf "Order on the petition for rehearing en banc"], United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oral arguments ===
On October 10, 2012, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case. Bert Rein represented the petitioner, [[Gregory G. Garre]], a former Solicitor General, represented the respondent, the university,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1 = Leon Lin |title = Fisher v. UT affirmative action case oral arguments heard |url = http://tech.mit.edu/V132/N45/fisher.html|work=[[The Tech (newspaper)|The Tech]] |issue =45 | volume =132 |date= October 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Solicitor General [[Donald Verrilli|Donald Verrilli, Jr.]], presented the government's stance in support of the respondent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author1 = Daniel Fisher |title =Supreme Court's Final Decisions Also A Verdict On SG Verrilli| url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2013/06/19/supreme-courts-final-decisions-also-a-verdict-on-sg-verrilli |work =Forbes |date =June 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the beginning of the petitioner’s argument, Justices [[Sonia Sotomayor|Sotomayor]] and [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ginsburg]] asked questions about whether the case was [[:wikt:moot|moot]]. Specifically, they were concerned with the university's arguments that Fisher would not have earned admission regardless of her race, that she had already graduated from college, and that she only named the $100 application fee as real damages. [[Antonin Scalia|Scalia]] commented that the harm of [[racial discrimination]] alone created an active controversy under the Court’s previous [[Equal Protection]] jurisprudence.&lt;ref name="trans11-345"&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2012/11-345.pdf "Oral Argument Transcript"], U.S. Supreme Court&lt;/ref&gt;

Justices Scalia, [[Samuel Alito|Alito]], and [[Justice John Roberts|Roberts]] asked many questions about the definition of a “critical mass”, which ''Grutter'' named as the central measure of diversity.  Scalia started calling it a “critical cloud” after the university’s lawyer failed, upon multiple requests, to define the central measure of diversity.&lt;ref name="trans11-345"/&gt; Chief Justice Roberts asked whether an applicant who was one-quarter or one-eighth [[Latino]] would be permitted by the University to check the “[[Latino]]” box.&lt;ref name="trans11-345"/&gt;  Garre responded that the applicant was entitled to self-identify as any race, subject to discipline under the university's [[Academic honor code|honor code]], and that the University did not ever question that determination.&lt;ref name="trans11-345"/&gt;

Legal analysts concurred that the process of oral argument indicated that a majority of the justices disliked the university's position.&lt;ref&gt;Nick DeSantis, [http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/argolinkroundups/early-reactions-to-the-supreme-courts-fisher-v-texas-arguments "Early Reactions to Fisher v Texas Arguments"], ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', October 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opinions of the Court ===
The opinion was issued on June 24, 2013—unusually late given that it was argued in October 2012.  In a 7–1 decision, the Court vacated and remanded the Fifth Circuit's ruling. Writing for the majority, Justice Kennedy concluded that the Fifth Circuit failed to apply ''[[strict scrutiny]]'' in its decision affirming the admissions policy. Instead, he wrote, the Fifth Circuit held that Fisher could only challenge "whether the University's decision to use race as an admissions factor 'was made in [[Good faith (law)|good faith]].'  It presumed that the school had acted in good faith and gave petitioner the burden of rebutting that presumption".&lt;ref&gt;''Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin'', 570 U. S., (slip op., at 11).&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy argued that per the ''Grutter ''ruling, the burden of evidence primarily lies with the university "to prove that its admissions program is narrowly tailored to obtain the educational benefits of diversity".&lt;ref&gt;''Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin'', 570 U. S., (slip op., at 13).&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Scalia wrote a one-paragraph concurring opinion, stating that he still holds the view that he first expressed in his concurring opinion in ''Grutter'': "The Constitution proscribes government discrimination on the basis of race, and state-provided education is no exception".&lt;ref&gt;Casey Scott McKay, [https://a.next.westlaw.com/Document/I782fed6fd7f611e398db8b09b4f043e0/View/FullText.html?navigationPath=Search%2Fv3%2Fsearch%2Fresults%2Fnavigation%2Fi0ad604050000014a91c69b1176609585%3FNav%3DANALYTICAL%26fragmentIdentifier%3DI782fed6fd7f611e398db8b09b4f043e0%26startIndex%3D1%26contextData%3D%2528sc.Search%2529%26transitionType%3DSearchItem&amp;listSource=Search&amp;listPageSource=3ad1ed03bbc61d89f599cd6b138b0d22&amp;list=ANALYTICAL&amp;rank=2&amp;grading=na&amp;sessionScopeId=4bf0fdfe230d3f3dc8af052ad5aa1ce9&amp;originationContext=Search%20Result&amp;transitionType=SearchItem&amp;contextData=%28sc.Search%29 "Fishin' with Fisher: Determining the Depth of Deference Does Not Demand Damning Deference to A Dastardly Death"], 83 ''[[Mississippi Law Journal]]'' 951 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Because the petitioner did not ask to overturn the holding in ''Grutter'', that there is a compelling evidence in the educational benefits of diversity to justify racial preferences in university admissions, he joined with the majority in full.&lt;ref&gt;''Fisher v. University of Texas Austin'', 570 U. S., (Scalia, J., concurring slip op., at 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Thomas wrote his own concurrence, stating his reasons for overturning ''Grutter'', and ruled that the use of race in higher education admissions violated the [[Equal Protection Clause]]. Thomas concluded that ''Grutter'' was a radical departure from the Court's application of the strict scrutiny test. According to Justice Thomas, strict scrutiny had only been previously satisfied where the state actor was acting to protect national security or to remedy its own past discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;''Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin'', 570 U. S., (Thomas, J., concurring slip op., at 4–5).&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote that student body diversity was simply not important enough to override the presumption that race-based policies are unconstitutional.

Additionally, comparing such university admissions with [[Racial segregation in the United States|desegregation]], he wrote that "there is no principled distinction between the University’s assertion that diversity yields educational benefits and the segregationists’ assertion that segregation yielded those same benefits".&lt;ref&gt;''Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin'', 570 U. S., (Thomas, J., concurring slip op., at 12).&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote that he believed that such admissions programs may actually be more harmful: "Blacks and Hispanics admitted to the University as a result of racial discrimination are, on average, far less prepared than their white and Asian classmates...the University’s discrimination does nothing to increase the number of blacks and Hispanics who have access to a college education generally...any blacks and Hispanics who likely would have excelled at less elite schools are placed in a position where underperformance is all but inevitable because they are less academically prepared than the white and Asian students with whom they must compete".&lt;ref&gt;''Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin'', 570 U. S., (Thomas, J., concurring slip op., at 17–18).&lt;/ref&gt;

In her dissenting opinion, Justice Ginsburg explained her reasons for affirming the Fifth Circuit's ruling. Noting that the university's 10% plan admitted students regardless of their race, she argued that "the University’s admissions policy flexibly considers race only as a 'factor of a factor of a factor of a factor' ... and is subject to periodic review to ensure that the consideration of race remains necessary and proper to achieve the University's educational objectives ... As I see it, the Court of Appeals has already completed that inquiry, and its judgment, trained on this Court's ''Bakke'' and ''Grutter'' pathmarkers, merits our approbation".&lt;ref&gt;''Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin'', 570 U. S., (Ginsburg, J., dissenting slip op., at 3–4).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Back to the Fifth Circuit ==
In June 2013, the Supreme Court ruled the Fifth Circuit had failed to apply [[strict scrutiny]] to the university's race-conscious admissions policy and sent the case back to the Fifth Circuit court. In November, the Fifth Circuit court heard oral arguments from both sides. In their questions during the arguments, Judges [[Patrick Higginbotham]], [[Carolyn Dineen King]], and [[Emilio M. Garza]] focused on the way the university defines "critical mass" as well as past attempts the university has made to increase minority enrollment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Voeller |first =Amanda| title= Fifth Circuit hears oral arguments for Fisher v.

On July 15, 2014, the Fifth Circuit announced its decision in favor of UT Austin, with Judge Garza dissenting. In its decision, the majority wrote, “It is equally settled that universities may use race as part of a holistic admissions program where it cannot otherwise achieve diversity.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/09/09-50822-CV2.pdf ''09-50822 5th Circuit Court of Appeals'', (2014).]&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher sought a rehearing [[en banc]] with the Fifth Circuit which was denied on 12 of November in a 10–5 decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/09/09-50822-CV3.pdf ''09-50822 ON PETITION FOR REHEARING EN BANC 5th Circuit Court of Appeals'', (2014).]&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher then filed a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotusblog.com/2015/02/fisher-ii-reaches-the-court/ “Fisher II” reaches the Court].

==Return to the Supreme Court==
{{Main|Fisher v. University of Texas (2016)}}
On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court announced that they would hear another challenge to UT Austin's admissions policy. The case was assigned docket number 14-981 and oral arguments were heard on December 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sherman|first1=Mark|title=Supreme Court Will Re-Hear Texas Affirmative Action|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/supreme-court-hear-texas-affirmative-action-32099271|work=ABC News|agency=AP|date=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Legal analysts predict from the justices' questions that the Court would likely either remand the case again to the lower courts for additional fact-finding, strike down UT Austin's policy, or strike down affirmative action in college admissions nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Denniston|first1=Lyle|title=Argument analysis: Now, three options on college affirmative action|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2015/12/argument-analysis-now-three-options-on-college-affirmative-action|work=SCOTUS Blog|date=December 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During oral arguments, Justice Scalia raised the [[Affirmative action#Mismatching|mismatching]] theory and questioned whether black students admitted to top-tier schools suffer because the courses are too difficult. Scalia commented that "There are those who contend that it does not benefit African Americans to get them into the University of Texas, where they do not do well, as opposed to having them go to a less-advanced school, a slower-track school where they do well. One of the briefs pointed out that most of the black scientists in this country don't come from schools like the University of Texas. They come from lesser schools where they do not feel that they're being pushed ahead in classes that are too fast for them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mencimer|first1=Stephanie|title=Justice Scalia Suggests Blacks Belong at "Slower" Colleges|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/12/justice-scalia-suggests-blacks-belong-slower-colleges-fisher-university-texas|work=Mother Jones|date=December 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comments led to outcry from the University of Texas's African American students,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hennessy-Fiske|first1=Molly|title=For black students at Texas, Supreme Court remarks are a burden added|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-na-black-ut-students-20151213-story.html|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spurred the creation of the Twitter hashtag #StayMadAbby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bernstein|first1=Roberta|title=U. of Texas Supreme Court fight gets hashtag: #StayMadAbby|url=http://college.usatoday.com/2015/12/13/u-of-texas-supreme-court-fight-gets-hashtag-staymadabby/|work=USA Today College|date=December 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Justice Antonin Scalia died on February 13, 2016 and Justice Elena Kagan recused herself, the case was decided by the seven remaining justices. On June 23, 2016, a 4-3 vote affirmed the Fifth Circuit's decision for UT Austin.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Glee clubs were very popular in Britain from then until the mid-1850s but by then they were gradually being superseded by choral societies.  ''Glee'' in this context does not refer to the mood of the music or of its singers, but to a specific form of English part song popular between 1650 and 1900, the [[Glee (music)|glee]].  But by the mid-20th century, proper ''glee'' clubs were no longer common.

The term remains in contemporary use, however, for [[choir]]s established in [[North America]]n [[college]]s, [[university|universities]], and high schools, although most American glee clubs are choruses in the standard sense, and rarely perform ''glees''.

'''Hooked on Phonics''' is a commercial brand of educational materials, originally designed for [[reading education]] through [[phonetics]]. First marketed in 1987, it used systematic phonics and scaffolded stories to teach letter–sound correlations (phonics) as part of children's literacy. The program has since expanded to encompass a wide variety of media, including books, [[computer game]]s, music, videos, and [[Flashcards|flash card]]s in addition to books in its materials, as well as to include other subject areas. The target audience for this brand is primarily individuals and home school parents. The product was advertised extensively on television and radio throughout the 1990s.

==History==
{{refimprove|section|date=May 2014}}
Hooked on Phonics was developed in the 1980s by a father who wanted to help his son overcome his reading problems. The original Hooked on Phonics ''Learn to Read'' product was released by Gateway Educational Products in 1987.

The company built a successful business based upon significant advertising, leading to sales of over $100M per year. The product, along with its [[catchphrase]] "Hooked on Phonics worked for me!" (spoken by children in the product's [[television commercial|television ads]]) and its telephone number "1-800-ABCDEFG" (now belonging to the Wilshire Law Firm), became widely recognized during the mid-1990s.

In 1994 the company was featured on the program ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' with an official from the [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]] attacking the company for "deceptive advertising".  The FTC and Gateway reached a settlement later, with Gateway agreeing to advertising ground rules and disclosure of all research data and consumer complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Aaron Nathans |title=Hooked on Phonics Settles With FTC on Advertising Claims | date=1994-12-15 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-12-15/news/mn-9369_1_hooked-on-phonics-program |newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the negative media coverage caused the company's sales to plummet and for the company to file for bankruptcy protection.

The year 2001 saw the introduction of test-taking strategies and [[study skills]] as part of the "Hooked on School Success" program and a new partnership with [[KinderCare Learning Centers]] to use materials in KinderCare's private [[child care]] facilities. 

In 2004 the FTC fined the company, then called Gateway Learning Corporation, for retroactively changing their privacy policy without informing customers, and subsequently sharing private information about customers including children with outside marketing firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Bob Sullivan |title=Hooked on Phonics fined by FTC |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5386195/ns/technology_and_science-security/t/hooked-phonics-fined-ftc/ |date=2004-07-07 |publisher=NBCNews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the product line was acquired by Educate, Inc., who also operated [[Sylvan Learning]], and began selling products in retail. In 2006 the company released a new line of educational programs including ''Hooked on Spanish'', ''Hooked on Handwriting'', and ''Hooked on Spelling'', among many others. 

By 2007, the Hooked on Phonics program had been introduced in over 30 countries. 

Hooked on Phonics was taken private in 2007 and the company renamed to Smarterville, Inc.

The flagship ''Learn to Read'' product underwent a major redesign, featuring DVDs, web customizations, and an entire new line of systematic phonics readers.  It was launched in the summer of 2009. Sixty music videos were added, composed by [[Russell Ginns]] and featuring performances by [[Cathy Fink]], [[Marcy Marxer]] and the a cappella group [[The Bobs]].

Hooked on Phonics was acquired by Sandviks Inc., in 2011.

Their Hooked on Phonics mobile app for iOS and Android was launched in 2013. As of 2018, it has been download more and 500,000 times.

==Awards==
{{unreferenced|section|date=May 2014}}
Hooked on Phonics' products have won several awards over the years, including:
* National Parenting Seal of Approval in 1998, 2005 and 2007
* Teachers' Choice Award in 2004, 2008 and 2009
* Curriculum Administrator Districts’ Choice in 2001

'''''Inspired''''' is an ambitious new [[project]] being developed by the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] in [[London]], [[England]]. 
The Science Museum holds some of the greatest [[Collection (museum)|collections]] of their kind in the world.  However, it is currently only able to display around 8% of its objects, while the rest are hidden away from the public in deep storage at the [[Science Museum Swindon]] and [[Blythe House]].  ''Inspired'' aims to bring all of these objects together in an extensive, [[sustainable]] new facility at the [[Science Museum Swindon]] and open them up to the public, accompanied by comprehensive public engagement in science and engineering, learning programmes and outdoor events.

The '''Inter-University Council for East Africa''' (IUCEA), based in [[Kampala]], [[Uganda]], is an institution of the inter-governmental organisation, the [[East African Community]]. IUCEA aims to foster collaboration between universities in [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]], [[Uganda]], [[Burundi]], [[Rwanda]] and [[South Sudan]].

'''Historical Background'''

In East Africa regional higher education interactions and cooperation originates from the pre-independence era when Makerere University College was the only higher education institution in the region serving students from Kenya, the then Tanganyika, and Zanzibar in East Africa

as well as from the then Rhodesia and Nyasaland in central and southern Africa, which now consist of Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Later in 1963, university colleges were formed in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam as constituent colleges of the then University of East Africa that had been established during the era of independence of the four countries (Uganda, Kenya, Zanzibar and Tanganyika). Makerere College was the third constituent college of the University of East Africa.

In 1970, the University of East Africa was dissolved and the University of Dar es Salaam, Makerere University and the University of Nairobi were established as separate national universities for Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya respectively. In the same year, due to the need to maintain collaboration between these universities the Inter-University Committee (IUC) was established under the auspices of the first EAC. The role of IUC was to facilitate contact and cooperation among the three universities (University of Dar es Salaam, Makerere University and University of Nairobi). IUC was hosted in Kampala, Uganda. In 1977, the former EAC collapsed and the support that IUC was receiving from the Partner States declined. However, IUC continued to coordinate cooperation between the three universities albeit with resource constraints that severely limited its functions.

'''Establishment of IUCEA'''

In 1980, after consultations involving permanent/principal secretaries responsible for higher education in Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya, the vice chancellors of the universities in the three countries met in Nairobi (Kenya) to discuss the future of the cooperation of their institutions. They agreed to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) committing them to maintain cooperation between their universities within the IUC framework. The MoU was subsequently signed, which also led to the transformation of IUC into the current Inter-university Council for East Africa (IUCEA). The MoU spelt out the objectives, functions, membership and governance of IUCEA, and, just like IUC, IUCEA continued and still is hosted in Kampala, Uganda. IUCEA played its role very well until 1992 when decline in financial support from the three governments of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda made it impossible to carry out the collaborative activities. This raised concern about institutional sustainability and hence prompted a study by the Commonwealth Higher Education Management Services (CHEMS) between November 1998 and March 1999 with a view to revitalizing IUCEA. The aim of the study was to develop a viable strategy for expansion and sustainability of IUCEA.

'''Revitalized IUCEA and Integration into EAC Framework'''

The Treaty for the Establishment of the current East African Community (The Treaty) was signed on 30 November 1999 and entered into force on 7 July 2000 following its ratification by the original three Partner States, namely Republic of Kenya, Republic of Uganda, and United Republic of Tanzania. The Republic of Burundi and the Republic of Rwanda acceded to the EAC Treaty on 18 June 2007 and became full Members of the Community with effect from 1 July 2007. Upon its re-establishment, EAC recognized IUCEA as one of the surviving institutions of the former Community. Therefore, it was agreed to establish IUCEA as an institution of the new EAC. In that process in 2000 IUCEA underwent revitalization following the recommendations of the CHEMS study and in 2002 the Ministers responsible for Higher Education of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda signed the IUCEA Protocol as an instrument that made IUCEA a legal body corporate of EAC.

'''The IUCEA Act, 2009'''

In 2009 the East African Legislative Assembly (EALA) enacted the IUCEA Act 2009, thus effectively integrating IUCEA into the EAC operational framework. The Act spells out the objectives, functions, institutional set up and systems of governance and management of IUCEA. According to the Act any university, university college and degree awarding institution may apply for and get admitted to the IUCEA membership as long as it is properly incorporated in the EAC Partner State where it is operating and is pursuing objectives that are consistent with the functions of IUCEA as spelt out in the Act.

Currie has served as a member of the Advisory Committee on Labor and Income Statistics for [[Statistics Canada]] and as a consultant for the [[National Health Interview Survey]] and the [[National Longitudinal Surveys]], and on the advisory board of the [[National Children's Study]].

She served on the Board of Reviewing Editors for ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' magazine from 2014-2018, and as the editor of the ''[[Journal of Economic Literature]]'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Janet|first=Currie,|date=May 2012|title=Report of the EditorJournal of Economic Literature|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.102.3.666|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=102|issue=3|pages=666–668|doi=10.1257/aer.102.3.666|issn=0002-8282|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 2010-2013.

She has previously held editorial roles for numerous economic peer-reviewed journals, including the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]],'' the ''[[Journal of Health Economics]],'' and the ''[[Journal of Public Economics]].''

Although Currie published several studies early in her career about collective bargaining in the public sector,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ashenfelter|first=Orley|last2=Currie|first2=Janet|last3=Farber|first3=Henry S.|last4=Spiegel|first4=Matthew|date=November 1992|title=An Experimental Comparison of Dispute Rates in Alternative Arbitration Systems|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2951527|journal=Econometrica|volume=60|issue=6|pages=1407|doi=10.2307/2951527|issn=0012-9682|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; she is best known for her work on the impact of poverty and government anti-poverty policies on the health and well-being of children over their life cycle. She has written about early intervention programs, expansions of Medicaid program, public housing and food and nutrition programs. She is considered an expert on the topic of [[Head Start (program)|Head Start Program.]] In work with [https://ipl.econ.duke.edu/dthomas/ Duncan Thomas] and Eliana Garces, she showed that children in Head Start made gains relative to their own siblings in terms of both test scores and longer-term measures of attainment. In work with [[Jonathan Gruber (economist)|Jonathan Gruber,]] she showed that expansions of public health insurance to low income women and children improved access to care and reduced infant mortality. Research on the effects of the safety net on American children is reviewed in her book, "The Invisible Safety Net."

Currie has also investigated broader socioeconomic determinants of fetal and child health, including health care, child maltreatment, nutrition, pollution exposure, and maternal education and smoking behaviors. Her work showing that the adoption of EZ-Pass improved infant health in Pennsylvania and New Jersey received wide attention. Her work showing disparities in fetal exposure to pollution and their consequences is summarized in her 2011 Ely lecture to the American Economics Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Currie|first=Janet|date=2011|title=Inequality at Birth: Some Causes and Consequences|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/29783707|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=101|issue=3|pages=1–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In work with [http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Economics/Faculty/Anna_Aizer/ Anna Aizer] and [https://www.econ.uzh.ch/en/people/faculty/schwandt.html Hannes Schwandt], she has shown that inequality in mortality is falling among U.S. children, at the same time that inequality in mortality among adults has been increasing, and attributed this improvement to the protective effect of safety net programs.

She is married to [[W. Bentley MacLeod]], an economist at [[Columbia University]], and together they have two children.

The '''Knowledge is Power Program''', commonly known as '''KIPP''', is a nationwide network of free open-enrollment [[Education in the United States#College and university|college-preparatory]] schools in under-resourced communities throughout the [[United States]].  [[charter school]] laws.   KIPP is America's largest network of charter schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13832483|title=Do charter schools work?  Time for a test |date=June 11, 2009|work=The Economist|accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The head offices are in [[San Francisco]], [[Chicago]], [[New York City]], and [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.kipp.org/contact-us/kipp-foundation-offices KIPP Foundation Offices]." KIPP Foundation. Retrieved on July 17, 2011. "San Francisco, CA (Head office) KIPP Foundation 135 Main Street, Suite 1700 San Francisco, CA 94105"&lt;/ref&gt;

KIPP was founded in 1994 by [[Mike Feinberg]] and Dave Levin, two [[Teach For America]] corps members.&lt;ref name="kipp.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kipp.org/about-kipp/history|title=KIPP Charter Schools History - KIPP Public Charter Schools|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, they opened two KIPP middle schools, one in Houston and one in New York City.&lt;ref name="kipp.org"/&gt; Both schools were among the highest-performing schools in their communities by 1999.&lt;ref name="kipp.org"/&gt; KIPP was one of the charter school organizations to help produce the [[Relay Graduate School of Education]] for teacher training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A new graduate school of education, Relay, to open next fall|author=Elizabeth Green|publisher=Chalkbeat|date=2011-02-14|url=http://ny.chalkbeat.org/2011/02/14/a-new-graduate-school-of-education-relay-to-open-next-fall/|accessdate=2004-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Education in the U.S.}}
KIPP began in 1994 after co-founders Dave Levin and Mike Feinberg completed their two-year commitment to Teach For America. A year later, they launched a program for [[Education in the United States#School grades|fifth graders]] in a public school in inner-city [[Houston, Texas]]. Feinberg developed KIPP Academy Houston into a charter school, while Levin went on to establish KIPP Academy New York in the [[South Bronx]]. The original KIPP Academies have a sustained record of high student achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Mathews, Jay. ''Work hard. Be nice.'' Algonquin Books. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operating principles==
More than 96% of KIPP students are [[African American]] or [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino/Hispanic]];  more than 87% are eligible for the federally subsidized meal program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kipp.org/reportcard|title=National Report Card - KIPP Public Charter Schools|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students are accepted regardless of prior academic record, conduct, or [[socioeconomic]] background. However KIPP schools typically have lower concentrations of special education and [[limited English proficiency]] (LEP) students, than the public schools from which they draw.&lt;ref name="Mathematica Policy Research"&gt;[http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/publications/pdfs/education/KIPP_fnlrpt.pdf "Student Characteristics and Achievement in 22 KIPP Middle Schools"], [http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/ Mathematica Policy Research] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813065842/http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/ |date=2010-08-13 }}, June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==KIPP Foundation==
Doris and [[Donald Fisher]], co-founders of [[Gap Inc]]., formed a partnership with Feinberg and Levin to replicate KIPP's success nationwide. Established in 2000 with a $15 million grant from the Fishers, the [[nonprofit]] KIPP Foundation recruits, trains, and supports outstanding teachers in opening and leading high-performing college-preparatory public schools in educationally underserved communities.&lt;ref name="kipp.org"/&gt; The foundation helps secure facilities and operating contracts while training school leaders through a yearlong fellowship called "Fisher Fellows" that includes a program of coursework, residencies at other KIPP Schools, and support from KIPP staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kipp.org/kipp-school-leadership-fellowships|title=KIPP Leadership - Development for all levels of leaders at KIPP|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

KIPP students are admitted through a lottery system.&lt;ref&gt;Lavon, Roy. "Real Justice in the Age of Obama". Princeton University Press. NJ. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; After a student is selected from the lottery and the student decides that he or she would like to attend a KIPP school, a home visit is set up with a teacher or the principal of the school, who meets with the family and student(s) to discuss expectations of all students, teachers and the parents in KIPP. Students, parents, and teachers are then all required to sign a KIPP commitment of excellence, agreeing to fulfill specific responsibilities, promising that they will do everything in their power to help the student succeed and go to college.&lt;ref&gt;Ravitch, Diane "The death and life of the great American School system" NY New York. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Teachers work approximately 60–80 hours a week and there is a great deal of teacher turnover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/education/teacher-turnover-burnout-charter-schools|title=How teacher turnover, burnout can impact "no-excuses" charter schools - Journalist's Resource|date=20 October 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schoolsmatter.info/2012/09/a-former-kipp-teacher-shares-her-story.html|title=A Former KIPP Teacher Shares Her Story|website=www.schoolsmatter.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of spring 2015, 45 percent of KIPP students have earned a four-year college degree after finishing eighth grade at a KIPP middle school ten or more years ago. This is above the national average for all students (34 percent), and five times the rate of the average student from a low-income community (9 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = College Completion Report - KIPP Public Charter Schools {{!}} Knowledge Is Power Program|url = http://www.kipp.org/results/college-completion-report|website = www.kipp.org|accessdate = 2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

KIPP has extended school days, requires attendance on Saturdays, offers extra-curricular activities, and adds three extra weeks of school in July. Most KIPP schools run from 7:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13825184|title=The underworked American: Children are exceptions to the country's work ethic|date=June 11, 2009|work=The Economist|accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monday through Friday and 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 1:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. on select Saturdays (usually twice a month). KIPP has built partnerships with other organizations, such as the United Negro College Fund, to address financial issues that might be related to the high rate of college attrition for their alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://diverseeducation.com/article/16050/ |title=New College Completion Initiative Targets College Success of KIPP Charter School Alumni |date=July 13, 2011 |work=Diverse Issues in Higher Education |accessdate=2012-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the school year, KIPP students can earn trips to visit colleges, go ice-skating, etc. At the end of the school year, the students can then attend an end of the school year field trip. These trips expose low-income students to new opportunities. For example, KIPP Academy Middle School in Houston, Texas, sends sixth graders to [[Utah]] and eighth graders to [[Washington, D.C.]], while fifth and seventh graders take a small trip within Texas for budget reasons. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Peer group==
KIPP and similar operators of multiple charter schools are known as ''charter management organizations'' (CMOs). KIPP is the largest, with 209 schools. Another non-profit CMO, [[Imagine Schools]], has 55.

For-profit rivals have shied away from managing any brick-and-mortar schools, preferring to offer online curricula and other services. These companies, including [[K12 (company)|K12]] and [[EdisonLearning]] are known as ''education management organizations'' (EMOs). K12 was the largest in the US in 2011-2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charter School Operators|url=http://www.in-perspective.org/pages/operators|publisher=In Perspective|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  K12 does not manage any brick-and-mortar schools, instead delivering schooling on line.

==Outside comments==
In June 2010, [[Mathematica Policy Research]] produced the first findings&lt;ref name="Mathematica Policy Research"/&gt; from a multi-year evaluation of KIPP: "Using a matched comparison group design, results show that for the vast majority of KIPP schools in the evaluation, impacts on students' state assessment scores in math and reading are positive, statistically significant, and educationally substantial."

A February 2007 strategy paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.brookings.edu/views/papers/200702education.pdf |title=An Education Strategy to Promote Opportunity, Prosperity, and Growth |accessdate=2013-08-17 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101223704/http://www3.brookings.edu/views/papers/200702education.pdf |archivedate=November 1, 2007 |df= }}, Brookings Institution, February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[think tank]] the [[Brookings Institution]] commented favorably on the accomplishment of KIPP. 

{{quote|At the vanguard of experimentation with educational methods and techniques are charter schools: public schools that operate outside the normal governance structure of the public school system. In recent years, charter schools such as the Knowledge Is Power Program (KIPP) and [[Achievement First]] have upended the way Americans think about educating disadvantaged children, eliminating the sense of impossibility and hopelessness and suggesting a set of highly promising methods.}}

A research report published in March 2005 by the [[Economic Policy Institute]] in book form as ''The Charter School Dust-Up: Examining the Evidence on Enrollment and Achievement'',&lt;ref name="epi.org"&gt;[http://www.epi.org/content.cfm/book_charter_school The Charter School Dust-Up: Examining the evidence on enrollment and achievement], Teachers College Press, March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; however, described the degree to which KIPP's admission process selects for likely high achievers:

{{quote|KIPP students, as a group, enter KIPP with substantially higher achievement than the typical achievement of schools from which they came. ... [T]eachers told us either that they referred students who were more able than their peers, or that the most motivated and educationally sophisticated parents were those likely to take the initiative to pull children out of the public school and enroll in KIPP at the end of fourth grade. Today, KIPP Schools have added Pre-K through 12th grade schools. A clear pattern to emerge from these interviews was that almost always it was students with unusually supportive parents or intact families who were referred to KIPP and completed the enrollment process.}}

==Criticism and commentary==
Some observers, such as the authors of ''The Charter School Dust-Up'', say that KIPP's admission process self-screens for students who are motivated and compliant and come from similarly motivated, compliant as well as supportive families. The 2010 Mathematica Policy Research study found that KIPP schools had a "lower concentration of special education and limited English proficiency students than the public schools from which they draw".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/publications/pdfs/education/KIPP_fnlrpt.pdf|title=Student Characteristics and Achievement in 22 KIPP Middle Schools|work=Mathematica Policy Research|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, some KIPP schools show high rates of attrition, especially for those students entering the schools with the lowest test scores. A 2008 study by [[SRI International]] found that while KIPP fifth-grade students who enter with below-average scores significantly outperform peers in public schools by the end of year one, "60 percent of students who entered fifth grade at four [[Bay Area]] KIPP schools in 2003–04 left before completing eighth grade",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pressrelease|url=http://www.sri.com/newsroom/press-releases/new-study-finds-san-francisco-bay-area-kipp-students-outperform-peers-0|title=New Study Finds San Francisco Bay Area KIPP Students Outperform Peers|publisher=[[SRI International]]|date=2008-09-16|accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; although research on attrition at one KIPP school in Massachusetts differs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/pam.21647| title = Who Benefits from KIPP?| journal = Journal of Policy Analysis and Management| volume = 31| issue = 4| pages = 837–860| year = 2012| last1 = Angrist | first1 = J. D.| last2 = Dynarski | first2 = S. M.| last3 = Kane | first3 = T. J.| last4 = Pathak | first4 = P. A.| last5 = Walters | first5 = C. R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SRI report also discusses student mobility due to changing economic situations for student's families, but does not directly link this factor into student attrition.

While KIPP's goal is that 75% of KIPP students graduate from college, a report they released in April 2011 stated that the college graduation rate for students who completed the first middle school program in 1999 and 2000 was about 33%.&lt;ref name="MatthewsCitePost"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/class-struggle/post/kipp-criticizes-its-college-graduation-record/2011/04/28/AF6Tao7E_blog.html |title=KIPP criticizes its college graduation record |author=Jay Mathews |authorlink=Jay Mathews |publisher=The Washington Post |date=29 April 2011 |accessdate=2013-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kipp.org/results/college-completion-report |title=College Completion Report |publisher=KIPP: Knowledge is Power Program |work=KIPP Public Charter Schools &amp;#124; Knowledge Is Power Program  |accessdate=2013-03-18}} April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="citypaper_hymowitz"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.city-journal.org/2011/eon0628kh.html|title=Still No Sign of Superman|author=[[Kay S. Hymowitz]]|date=June 28, 2011 |accessdate=2013-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report states that 95% of the students completed high school, 89% of the students went to college, and 33% of the students earned a degree. This is in contrast to only 70% completing high school, 41% going to college, and 8% earning a four-year degree for students in a similar economic background to that which KIPP draws from.&lt;ref name="KIPPccReportpg09"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kipp.org/results/college-completion-report |title=College Completion Report |publisher=KIPP: Knowledge is Power Program |work=KIPP Public Charter Schools &amp;#124; Knowledge Is Power Program  |accessdate=2013-03-18}} April 2011, (see page 9 of the report (page 11 of the issuu document))&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall in the United States 83% of students complete high school, 62% enroll in college, and 31% complete a four-year degree.&lt;ref name="KIPPccReportpg09"/&gt;

For the overall graduation rate for students entering college in the United States one study found a value of 56% (Pathways to Prosperity Study),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Carlozo |first1=Lou |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/27/us-attn-andrea-education-dropouts-idUSBRE82Q0Y120120327 |date=27 March 2012 |accessdate=2013-03-18 |title=Why college students stop short of a degree |publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another study found a value of 54% (American Dream 2.0 Report).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/24/college-dropout-crisis-american-dream-20_n_2538311.html |title=College Dropout Crisis Revealed In 'American Dream 2.0' Report |date=24 January 2013 |accessdate=2013-03-18 |author=Joy Resmovits |publisher=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

KIPP's goal of a 75% college graduation rate is close to the 82% college graduation rate for students coming from the highest income quartile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kipp.org/results/college-completion-report |title=College Completion Report |publisher=KIPP: Knowledge is Power Program |work=KIPP Public Charter Schools &amp;#124; Knowledge Is Power Program  |accessdate=2013-03-19}} April 2011, (see page 7 of the report (page 9 of the issuu document))&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jay Mathews]], writing for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', was encouraged by the results from the KIPP report, although he pointed out that the sample size was only 200 students, and that after graduating from the KIPP middle school the students were no longer attending a KIPP school.&lt;ref name="MatthewsCitePost"/&gt; Both Matthews and [[Kay S. Hymowitz]] writing for [[City Journal (New York)|''City Journal'']] find the 75% goal to be ambitious.

The report published in April 2011 projects that KIPP students who graduate from college will increase from over 6,000 in 2014, to over 7,500 in 2015, to about 10,500 in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kipp.org/results/college-completion-report |title=College Completion Report |publisher=KIPP: Knowledge is Power Program |work=KIPP Public Charter Schools &amp;#124; Knowledge Is Power Program  |accessdate=2013-03-19}} April 2011, (see page 19 of the report (page 21 of the issuu document))&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5472">A '''miscellaneous school''' is a classification of schools under the education laws of Japan and South Korea.

==Japan==

===Overview===
''Kakushu gakkō'' ({{lang-ja|各種学校}}), or a "miscellaneous vocational school,"&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.pref.osaka.lg.jp/jidoseitoshien/shugaku/g_english/shu_5.html List of International Schools]" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6aqnBEzlM Archive]). [[Osaka Prefecture]]. Retrieved on August 17, 2015. Japanese version: "[http://www.pref.osaka.lg.jp/jidoseitoshien/shugaku/g_japanese/shu_5.html 外国人学校リスト]" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6cgoMganR Archive]).&lt;/ref&gt; is a classification of schools in Japan, established by Article 134 of the [[School Education Act]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/law/detail/?id=272&amp;vm=&amp;re=01&lt;/ref&gt; Types of schools classified as miscellaneous schools include [[Driver's education|driving schools]], [[vocational school]]s, and some [[international school]]s (such as the ''[[chōsen gakkō]]'' run by North Korea-aligned [[Chongryon]]). Due to this status they receive a smaller government subsidy than do ordinary Japanese private schools.&lt;ref name=Nakamuraflexible&gt;Nakamura, Akemi. "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2008/01/03/national/flexible-and-diverse-international-schools-thrive/ Flexible and diverse, international schools thrive]" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6cTPqU07X Archive]). ''[[The Japan Times]]''. January 3, 2008. Retrieved on October 23, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Their graduates may also face difficulties registering to take entrance examinations for high schools and universities.&lt;ref name="MEXT"&gt;http://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/shingi/chousa/kokusai/011/attach/1319315.htm&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Osaka Chinese School]] warns parents of prospective students that, while the municipal government of [[Osaka]] allows OCS graduates who are Chinese citizens and people of Chinese descent to sit for public high school examinations, the government has refused the same permission to OCS graduates who are Japanese citizens not of Chinese descent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ocs.ed.jp/pdf/baoming-2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 1, 2007, there were 120 "miscellaneous schools" that were not aimed at Japanese children; they included 79 ''chōsen gakkō'', five Chinese schools, four schools that serve either [[Brazilian schools in Japan|Brazilian]] or Peruvian ([[:ja:ペルー学校|JA]]) students, and one school affiliated with South Korea, along with 31 other international schools.&lt;ref name=Nakamuraflexible/&gt;

===Standards of recognition===

Regulations setting out the standards for accreditation as a miscellaneous school were issued by the then-[[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Ministry of Education]] in 1956. Under those regulations, the power to accredit miscellaneous schools was assigned to the [[Governor (Japan)|prefectural governors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mext.go.jp/a_menu/shougai/senshuu/04062902.htm|title=各種学校規程（昭和三十一年文部省令第三十一号）|publisher=Ministry of Education|year=1956|accessdate=2015-10-23|postscript=none}}. The regulations have also been amended in 2004: {{cite web|url=http://www.mext.go.jp/a_menu/shougai/senshuu/04062903.htm|title=専修学校設置基準の一部を改正する省令及び各種学校規程の一部を改正する省令の施行について（通知）|publisher=[[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology]]|date=2004-06-21|accessdate=2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accreditation standards thus differ by prefecture. For example, as of 2011, the minimum threshold for total assets as a proportion of yearly operational expense ranged from one-sixth to two-thirds, and some prefectures demand that miscellaneous schools own lands and buildings as a condition of accreditation, while others have relaxed this standard and allow schools which rent their facilities on a long-term or even short-term basis.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/shingi/chousa/kokusai/011/attach/1319316.htm Survey Research on Miscellaneous School and Quasi-Incorporated Educational Institution Accreditation of Schools for Foreign Nationals]" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6cUZ4XJRA Archive]).

Some international schools have been able to convert from "miscellaneous school" to so-called "Article 1 school" ({{lang|ja|第1条校}}) status, making them ordinary recognised [[private school]]s under Japanese law.&lt;ref name="MEXT"/&gt; ''Chōsen gakkō'' have been unable to obtain this kind of official recognition as private schools, a situation which their supporters have described as discriminatory.&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.korea-np.co.jp/na-edu/basyo9905hdh/sinboj99060481.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Korea==
The classification of ''gakjong hakkyo'' ({{ko-hhrm|각종학교|各種學校}}) is defined in regulations promulgated under the authority of Article 60, Paragraph 3 of the Primary and Middle Education Act, and Article 59, Paragraph 3 of the Higher Education Act. Article 12 of the regulations defines schools for foreigners following the curricula of a foreign country as one type of ''gakjong hakkyo''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.go.kr/lsInfoP.do?lsiSeq=137574&amp;efYd=20130323&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Art Education Association''' (NAEA) is a [[professional association]] founded in 1947 in the United States. It is the world's largest professional [[art education]] association.

The NAEA's annual convention attracts thousands of art educators and offers art educators a chance to network, establish mentor relationships, and attend professional development events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/index.asp?layout=talkbackCommentsFull&amp;talk_back_header_id=6649576&amp;articleid=CA6726768 Melissa Techman, "Art Teachers Bring 21st-Century Vision to 2010 Conference", ''School Library Journal'', Apr. 20, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;  The NAEA also gives awards for Art Educator of the Year at this convention.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/life/stories/2010/04/19/1a-showtell19-art-gj686cra-1.html?sid=101 "OSU educator honored", ''The Columbus Dispatch'', Apr. 19, 2010], [http://kohd.com/page/170770 "Oregon's Best Art Teacher Selected from Bend", KOHD.com, Apr. 20, 2010], [http://www.dentonrc.com/sharedcontent/dws/drc/entertainment/stories/DRC_artbriefs_0418.25ac6816d.html "UNT art professor wins national award", ''Denton Record-Chronicle'', Apr. 18, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the [[Art &amp; Creative Materials Institute]], in 1969, the NAEA began sponsoring March as [[Youth Art Month]].  Since 1984, Youth Art Month has been run by the [[Council for Art Education, Inc.]], which consists of representatives of the NAEA and other art associations.

As an advocacy organization, the NAEA speaks out in favor of increased funding for art education, and opposing cuts to art funding.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://peoplesworld.org/emergency-funding-urged-to-prevent-worst-school-cuts-in-50-years/ Susan Webb, "Emergency funding urged to prevent worst school cuts in 50 years", ''People's World'', Apr. 21, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The NAEA publishes two journals, ''Art Education'' and ''Studies in Art Education''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/publisher/naea Publisher Information from Jstor]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Skills Academy for Power''' is a skills academy for the energy and power industry in the UK.

==History==
The National Skills Academy for Power was first announced in October 2008 by the [[Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills]]. Steve Davies was made the Chief Executive in September 2009. It was given formal government approval on 18 March 2010.

It was the 15th National Skills Academy. £2.9 million of funding for the project was allocated from the government.

It held its first Annual Conference and Awards Dinner on 9 March 2011 at [[Twickenham Stadium]]. This also included the People in Power Awards.

==Structure==
It is based near [[Monkspath]] on the [[A34 road|A34]], next to the Corus Hotel Solihull&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corushotels.com/Corus-hotel-Solihull/hotel Corus Hotel Solihull]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/85906 Monkspath business park] close to junction 4 of the [[M42 motorway|M42]].

[[Image:Benkid77 Puddington-Shotwick footpath 27 110809.JPG|thumb|right|Power line near [[Shotwick]] in Cheshire]]
It is a partnership between the Sector Skills Council, [[Energy and Utility Skills]], and several energy companies:
* [[Alstom]]
* [[Galliford Try|Morrison]] Utility Services &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morrisonus.com Morrison Utility Services]&lt;/ref&gt; (based in [[Stevenage]])
* [[E.ON UK]]
* [[Scottish Power]]
* [[CE Electric UK]]
* [[Carillion]] Utility Services
* [[National Grid plc]]
* [[EDF Energy]]
* [[ABB Group]]
* [[Balfour Beatty]] Utility Solutions
* [[Scottish and Southern Energy]] 
* [[Morgan Sindall Group]] 
* ITI Energy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iti-energy.com ITI Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

It also works in conjunction with the [[IET Power Academy]], which was set up in 2004, an industry group that was formed by seven universities (Bath, Cardiff, [[Imperial College London]], Manchester, [[Queen's University Belfast]], Southampton and Strathclyde) and eighteen power companies.

==Function==
It seeks to focus and coordinate UK-wide training in the power sector by standardising training materials. It also promotes the industry sector, specifically its career choices, in a way similar to a trade association. Similar work, on a much broader focus, is carried out by the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] (IET).

The '''New York State College of Forestry at Cornell''' was a [[statutory college]] established in 1898 at [[Cornell University]] to teach scientific forestry. The first four-year college of forestry in the country, it was defunded by the State of New York in 1903, over controversies involving the college's forestry practices in the Adirondacks. Forestry studies continued at Cornell even after the college's closing.

==Background==
The idea of a Cornell Forestry school began with Colonel [[William F. Fox]], Superintendent of New York's state-owned forests during the mid-1890s. At that time, forestry research and education was conducted only in Great Britain and Europe.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.cornell.edu/mission/history/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007112429/http://www.dnr.cornell.edu/mission/history/ |archivedate=2007-10-07 |title=Department of Natural Resources - History |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-10-07 |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Governor [[Frank S. Black]] went on a fishing trip with a Cornell trustee and discussed Col. Fox's proposal, the suggestion was made that Cornell would be well-suited to implement the demonstration forest. Cornell President [[Jacob Gould Schurman]] then began lobbying for a state-funded college, just as he had successfully advocated for a state-funded veterinary college in 1894. The legislature quickly approved the new college.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 122 of the Laws of 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; The act authorized New York State to pay for a tract of forest land in the Adirondacks from funds, previously appropriated for the acquisition of lands to be held "forever wild" in the [[Adirondack Forest Preserve]],&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, Alfred Lee,(1921) A History of the Adirondacks, page 203&lt;/ref&gt; with Cornell holding title, possession, management, and control for 30 years.  After 30 years, the land would revert to the State. Schurman recruited German trained, Dr. [[Bernhard Fernow|Bernhard E. Fernow]], who was then the 3rd Chief of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Division of Forestry (predecessor of the [[U.S. Forest Service]]) and one of the top forestry experts in the United States, to be the first Dean of the college.

Fernow moved quickly to acquire a tract of land to serve as a demonstration forest and purchased some.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt; Fernow's plan called for [[clearcutting]] the forestland at the rate of several thousand acres per year to prepare for planting conifers. He contracted with the [[Brooklyn Cooperage Company]] to take the logs and cordwood from the forest land for a 15-year period. In the 1890s, the more valuable red spruce trees had been logged, leaving primarily northern hardwoods. The years 1899, 1903, and 1908 were terrible years for forest fires in the Adirondacks. Many, tens of thousands of acres were consumed by forest fires. Most fires were started by sparks or embers flying from coal-burning locomotive stacks and landing on [[logging slash]]. [[Louis Marshall]], with a summer residence at [[Knollwood Club]] on [[Lower Saranac Lake]], branded locomotives as "instruments of arson."&lt;ref&gt;Angus,Christopher. The extraordinary Adirondack journey of Clarence Petty: wilderness guide, pilot, and conservationist, p. 17, [[Syracuse University Press]] 2002 {{ISBN|0-8156-0741-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worst sin of the lumbermen was the fire menace that they left behind, and which caused incalculable destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas,Howard. Black River in the  North Country, p.89, Prospect Books,1963&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless,  Fernow had a {{convert|6|mi|km|adj=on}} long railroad spur built from Axton to Tupper Lake in order to deliver logs to the Brooklyn Cooperage Company facility. The company turned the hardwood logs into barrels and the cordwood into [[methanol]] and [[charcoal]], through a process called [[destructive distillation]]. Historic charcoal kiln photo:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite APOD|title=Milky Way Over Abandoned Kilns |date=25 July 2011 |access-date=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
To his credit, Fernow established the first tree nursery in New York State at Axton, the site of an old lumber settlement originally called Axe-town. But most of the non-native conifer species he planted, such as [[norway spruce]], did not do well for many years, with a denuded area as a result. Smoke from the burning of brush and logging slash, along with Fernow's arrogant disposition toward landowners from nearby Saranac Lake further alienated the public.&lt;ref&gt;Gove, B. 2005. ''Logging railroads of the Adirondacks''. Syracuse University Press. pp. 176-181.&lt;/ref&gt; Fernow's actions drew criticism also from Adirondack guides such as Ellsworth Petty (father of [[Clarence Petty]]), who protested the plan and, in a letter writing campaign, successfully lobbied the State to assign a special "Committee of the Adirondacks" to tour the Axton site. In its findings, the commission concluded that "the college has exceeded the original intention of the State when the tract was granted the university for conducting silvicultural experiments."&lt;ref name="Christopher 2002. p 31"&gt;Christopher, Angus. 2002. ''The Extraordinary Adirondack Journey of Clarence Petty'', p 31. Syracuse University Press {{ISBN|0-8156-0741-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Existence==

In  1898, the New York State College of Forestry opened at Cornell, which was the first forestry college in North America.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;  Because some of the students were transfer students, even though the College had a four-year curriculum, it graduated students during each of the five years of its operation, and the demand for students with Cornell forestry degrees exceeded the supply.  It also offered an optional  fifth year for a professional masters in forestry degree.

In 1899, Fernow had been recruited as a member of New York's [[E.H. Harriman]] expedition to Alaska, along with fellow Cornellian [[Louis Agassiz Fuertes]]. The expedition set sail from Seattle on May 31, 1899, aboard the refitted steamer, the ''George W. Elder''. "[Fernow's] research on the expedition was hampered by the fact that the coastal itinerary never gave him a look at the inland forests. His overview thus limited, he concluded that Alaska would never be a great source of timber: the wood was inferior and the conditions of lumbering too difficult. Some say that history has proven him wrong, but his opinion did have an effect: for a time, it discouraged commercial interests from prospecting for timber in the Alaskan forests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/harriman/1899/1899_part/participantfernow.html |title=Harriman: Bernhard Fernow |publisher=PBS |date=1923-02-06 |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902, Fernow founded and became editor-in-chief of  the ''[[Journal of Forestry]]'', the pioneering scholarly journal in this field.

The demonstration forest, near Saranac Lake, in the Adirondacks drew heated opposition from neighboring land owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0L8LAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=Brooklyn+Cooperage+Company%5D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3FNnwghrFu&amp;sig=aVmNAw0naLbeOJqb9l1Gyk4E0Eo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QpejSuORNoTYsQOvlImNDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#v=onepage&amp;q=Brooklyn%20Cooperage%20Company%5D&amp;f=false|title=''A history of the Adirondacks, Volume 2''|first=Alfred Lee|last=Donaldson|pages=202–207|publisher=Century Co|year=1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an annual state appropriation for the college of only $10,000, Cornell entered into a contract with Brookyn Cooperage Company for the project to be viable. The contract proved to be profitable and beneficial only for the company. Cornell gained insufficient funds to replant the clear-cut areas. A lawsuit was filed, naming the Brooklyn Cooperage Company as defendant with the People of New York State as plaintiff. (See ''[[People v. the Brooklyn Cooperage Company]]''.)

Although the legislature had adopted the 1903 appropriation without debate,&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt; Governor [[Benjamin B. Odell]] made a [[pocket veto]] of funds for the school. In his statement, Governor Odell said: "The operations of the College of Forestry have been subjected to grave criticism, as they have practically denuded the forest lands of the State without compensating benefits. I deem it wise therefore to withhold approval of this item until a more scientific and more reasonable method is pursued in the forestry of the lands now under the control of Cornell University."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Z. Lincoln, ed. 1910. ''Messages from the Governors, X''. Albany, p.555, as cited in ''Education &amp; Agriculture, A History of the NYS College of Agriculture at Cornell University'', 1963, by Gould P. Colman, p.161, Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sacrifice of College of Forestry for the College of Agriculture==

Dean Bailey and Dean [[Bernhard Fernow]], of the Forestry College were the best of friends.{{according to whom|date=March 2013}} In fact, on that night in May 1903 when the telegram arrived announcing Governor Odell's veto of the annual appropriation for the College of Forestry, Bailey and Fernow were together at a dance. Despite the bad news, the dance went on. Fernow did not want to let the veto end his school, and he continued to work without a salary.  He proposed continuing the school by charging tuition to the students.  (During this time, New York State students attended the College tuition-free.) However, Cornell's Board of Trustees and President Schurman (despite Bailey's urgings to the contrary) decided to close the doors of the Forestry College. In June, 1903, instruction in the College ceased and the faculty was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers, p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A05EEDB1339E333A2575BC1A9609C946297D6CF|title=CORNELL SCHOOL OF FORESTRY SUSPENDED.; Action Followed Failure of State to Provide Means for Its Support.|work=New York Times|date=June 18, 1903|accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was rumored, and with good reason, that a political bargain took place exchanging the College of Forestry, for the establishment of the [[New York State College of Agriculture]] at Cornell University in 1904. To quote Liberty Hyde Bailey, "Last winter at Albany I was confronted by inquiries which indicated that the State would be willing to give to either a College of Forestry or a College of Agriculture, but not to both."&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Education &amp; Agriculture, A History of the NYS College of Agriculture at Cornell University,1963, by Gould P. Colman, page 162, Cornell University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as the legislative session of 1904 began in Albany, a most unexpected mishap occurred: at a hearing before the Federal Commission on Agriculture in Washington, the Secretary of Agriculture, James Wilson, attacked Cornell for not teaching "Soil Physics" and took the occasion to revive the old canards about Cornell misusing the riches conferred by the [[Morrill Act]]. He said of Cornell: "They were better endowed than any institution in the land, yet never did anything." Cornell's President [[Jacob Gould Schurman]] demanded a hearing and spoke in Washington with his usual brilliance, refuting the Secretary point by point.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Meanwhile, in Albany, Senator Ed Stewart of Ithaca introduced a bill drafted by [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]],establishing the New York State College of Agriculture at Cornell. Leading the opposition was Chancellor [[James Roscoe Day|James R. Day]] of Syracuse University. According to Schurman, "the Chancellor led a pious army, the Methodists of the state. He was an angry man; his words breathe a rancor too hot to be contained by facts." He charged that [[Ezra Cornell]] had so "manipulated" the proceeds of the Morrill Act that more than four-fifths were improperly used. He demanded a share in state bounty equal to that accorded Cornell: "Either give to all or not to any!"&lt;ref name="Bishop, p. 367"&gt;Bishop, p. 367.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Bailey broadcast an immediate refutation, but Chancellor Day had already had his speech published by the Syracuse University Press without change. The Chancellor asked for a hearing before the Assembly's Ways and Means Committee. This request granted, he spoke at the hearing but the chairman and other legislators were insufficiently attentive to him, the Chancellor broke off in a fury and left the room,"before he had adduced a single coherent argument." Dean Bailey, later put up a picture of Chancellor Day, in his office, with the subscription: "Founder of the [[New York State College of Agriculture]] at Cornell."&lt;ref name="Bishop, p. 367"/&gt;
  
The announcement of the final passage and signing of the bill, in Albany, creating the [[New York State College of Agriculture]] at Cornell was met with bonfires and the pealing of church bells in Ithaca. However, the price for this new state support at Cornell was the sacrifice of the New York State College of Forestry at Cornell.&lt;ref&gt;Colman,p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

The lawsuit, ''People v. the Brooklyn Cooperage Company'', was decided in favor of the People, and again on appeal in 1906;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9905E2D71F3DE633A25750C1A9619C946797D6CF|title=Cornell Forestry Case: Appellate Division Decision Against Brooklyn Cooperage Company|work=New York Times|page=4|date=July 13, 1906|accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the case defined forestry in the United States for a generation. The {{convert|30000|acre|km2}} of forest lands were placed under the "forever wild" protection of the [[Adirondack Forest Preserve]]. At the conclusion of the case, constitutional lawyer [[Louis Marshall]] stated, "I hold before me the decision in the case of the People against the Brooklyn Cooperage Company.....the consequence of that was that this 'tremendous' tract of thirty thousand acres was to be cut down 'flat' from one end of it to the other, in order that the scientific foresters might start a new forest which might mature a hundred years from the time that that contract was entered into. This is scientific forestry?".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Reznikoff, Charles, ed., ''Louis Marshall: Champion of Liberty. Selected Papers and Addresses''. 2 vols. Philadelphia: The Jewish Publication Society of America, 1957., page 1020.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, [[Bernhard E. Fernow]] became the first professor of forestry in a four-year baccalaureate degree program at [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State]], in State College, after having been the nation's first consulting forester since leaving Cornell and Ithaca in 1903. His office was in New York City. After teaching the 1907 spring semester at Penn State, Dr. Fernow left to become the first head of the Faculty of Forestry at the [[University of Toronto]].

In 1910, [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]], the Dean of Cornell's Agriculture College, succeeded in having what remained of the Forestry College transferred to his school.  At his request, in 1911, the legislature appropriated $100,000 to construct a building to house the new Forestry Department on the Cornell campus, which Cornell later named [[Fernow Hall (Ithaca, New York)|Fernow Hall]]. That Forestry Department continues today as the Department of Natural Resources. In 1927, Cornell established a {{convert|1639|acre|km2|adj=on}} research forest south of Ithaca, the Arnot Woods.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;

In 1911, the State Legislature established a [[State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry|New York State College of Forestry]] at [[Syracuse University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.syr.edu/exhibits/sunyesf.html |title=Syracuse University Archives: Exhibits - "SUNY ESF and SU: 100 Years of Collaboration" |publisher=Archives.syr.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not without opposition from Cornell University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20B1FFA3B5F13738DDDAD0994DD405B838DF1D3&amp;scp=18&amp;sq=new%20york%20state%20college%20of%20forestry,syracuse&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=OPPOSES FORESTRY SCHOOL; Cornell Against $310,000 Appropriation for Syracuse Department | date=May 14, 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, the NYS [[Board of Regents]] questioned the need for duplicate, state-supported forestry programs at Cornell and Syracuse. A formal study resulted in an agreement in 1937 that the Syracuse program would be the only place for professional undergraduate training in forestry. Cornell's Department of Forestry continued with courses in "farm" forestry, to [[cooperative extension]] work in forestry, and to research and graduate education.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt; In an exchange, [[Syracuse University]] agreed to abandon its School of Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.syr.edu/exhibits/sunyesf_1900-1919.html |title=Syracuse University Archives: Exhibits - "SUNY ESF and SU: 100 Years of Collaboration" - 1900-1919 |publisher=Archives.syr.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.syracuse.com/opinion/2013/01/syracuse_universitys_history_a.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2000, SUNY System Administration established ESF's "primacy" among the 64 SUNY campuses and contract colleges for development of new undergraduate degree programs in Environmental Science and Environmental Studies, but ESF does not have a veto power over competing new programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.esf.edu/es/documents/GuidelinesforConsidofnewugDegreePgms6302000.pdf | title=Guidelines for Consideration of New Undergraduate Degree Programs in Environmental Science/Studies| accessdate=2010-12-18| author=Peter D.

Cornell’s vertebrate museum’s fishes collection is particularly strong with great diversity in North American fishes, and minnows in particular. Beginning in the 1940s and continuing into the 1970s the fish collection was greatly expanded thanks to collections made by renowned Cornell ichthyologist Edward Raney and his students.

The Cornell [[Hortorium]] founded by Liberty Hyde Bailey in 1935, has historically been the major U. S. center for the systematics of cultivated plants.&lt;ref&gt;https://plantbio.cals.cornell.edu/hortorium&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/bailey/hortorium/&lt;/ref&gt;

Following in the footsteps of the great [[botanist]] and [[horticulturist]], [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]], a most extraordinary [[plant physiologist]], [[Frederick Campion Steward]], arrived to teach and conduct research at Cornell University in 1950, as Professor of Botany. From his Cornell classrooms and laboratories, Steward was responsible for creating and inspiring a generation of botanists.

In 1978, the [[Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research]] relocated to the Ithaca campus from its original site in Yonkers, NY. Its history is extremely interesting and relevant.&lt;ref name=bti1&gt;[http://bti.cornell.edu/index.php?page=AboutUs&amp;section=History#page=Overview "History of BTI," Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bti&gt;[http://bti.cornell.edu/ Homepage, Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research]&lt;/ref&gt;

“Reprinted with revised Bibliography, 1927, from Appendix V of the Final Report of the National Waterways Commission, 1912. (Senate Document No. 469, 62d Congress, 2d Session)”

“Object of the Report”

“ Of all the direct influences of the forest the influence upon the supply of water in streams and upon the regularity of their flow is the most important in human economy. Yet so many are the factors which play related parts in this influence, so great is the difficulty of observing them with precision, and so wide the range of economic interests affected, that considerable divergence of opinion has arisen on the subject. This, however, if prompted by a sincere desire to reach the bottom of a complicated and vital problem, can only be productive of results of the highest scientific value.”

“ There is, perhaps no other problem facing the American people to-day which demands such care in the scientific accuracy of its data and conclusions as does the relation between forests and water. It is imperative, therefore, that no final conclusions be drawn in regard to this relation until ample, reliable, and critically revised evidence upon which to base them is available. A national policy which, though considering the direct value of forests as a source of timber, fails to take full account also of their influence upon erosion, the flow of streams, and climate, may easily endanger the well-being of the whole people.” (page 1)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/boise/AWAE/labs/awae_flagstaff/Hot_Topics/SierraAnchaEF/publications/hibbert_fortrtmnteffectswateryield.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Orgelkids Doe-orgel leskist.jpg|thumb|200px|The Do-organ of Orgelkids]]
'''Orgelkids''' (Dutch, "organkids") is an [[education]]al project meant to familiarize and educate children with the [[pipe organ]] musical instrument. The project was initiated in the [[Netherlands]] in 2009 by Lydia Vroegindeweij and is directed towards [[cultural heritage|cultural legacy]] and [[music education]].  Initially the project consisted of a website with educational tips and lesson suggestions to organize, among other projects,  an excursion to a large pipe organ.  Since 2013, Orgelkids has at its disposal a speciallly developed educational organ assembly kit.  A complete, craftsman-built organ, in unassembled component parts, is contained in a lesson box.  The instrument can be assembled and subsequently played.  This so-called Do-organ is rented out by Orgelkids to [[organist]]s, [[organ builder]]s or organ teachers who want to organize educational projects for children.

== Justification / Background ==
The classical pipe organ is almost always built in a fixed location in a building and not very accessible for children.  Due to increased [[secularization]] of society, fewer children attend churches, so they have fewer occasions to spontaneously experience a pipe organ.&lt;ref name=secu&gt;an. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Many smaller churches in N. America have electronic organs.  &lt;br /&gt;
In the Netherlands there is a wealth of historical organs.  For the preservation and maintenance of this cultural legacy, it is important to encourage a continuing flow of new organists and organ builders.  To prevent that knowledge and enthusiasm for organs continue to decline, Orgelkids has made a special instrument available to schools.  An [[organist]] or [[organ builder]] visits the school with the Do-organ and supervises the students as they build/assemble the organ.

== Orgelkids Do-organ ==
[[File:2013 Orgelkids Doe-orgel pijpen plaatsen.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Children in primary school are assembling the Do-organ]]
An organ in a lesson box is a unique concept, first conceived and built by Dutch organ builder Wim Janssen specially for the goal of educating children with the technology and playing of the organ.  It is not a demonstration organ with just a few keys, but a real instrument with which children can self-discover how it works.  That is the reason it was given the name, "Do-organ."
The Orgelkids instrument is a mechanical, tracker organ with two [[octave]]s (24 keys) and two [[organ stop|registers]] which can be used independently or in combination. Air (wind in organ parlance)  is supplied by a hand-pumped [[bellows]].&lt;ref name=octaves&gt;Verhoeven 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

All the materials used are identical to those used in a large pipe organ (such as [[oak wood]] and [[sheepskin|sheep leather]]).  Children experience the value and quality of craftsman-made instruments.

The lesson box is supplied with instruction manuals which include many photos, by which children can assemble the organ with a minimum of instructions, in about 45 minutes.  In addition, there are other lesson materials available such as an [[instructional video]] by the builder, an [[e-book]], and a presentation for a digital [[blackboard]].

Ton Stevens, organist of the basilica of St. John in [[Oosterhout]], the Netherlands, works with kids on [[World Animal Day]] in the basilica every year. First they build and play the Do-organ of Orgelkids, and afterwards the children can take a look at the "real" organ built by [[Maarschalkerweerd]] in 1890. Of course songs like ''[[Old MacDonald Had a Farm]]'' are played on the organ on the occasion of that special day.&lt;ref name=stevens&gt;Rodenburg 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== International developments ==
Orgelkids started in the [[Netherlands]] in 2013 with a single lesson box.  The home for this organ is in the [[Amersfoort]] region, which is in the center of the country.  In the first year, 1350 children were reached.
In 2015 it was expanded with a second organ which is based in [[Belgium]], operating out of [[Antwerp]].  In its first year there, 800 children were reached.

The project has attracted more international attention.  In Oregon a sister project, Orgelkids USA, an educational 501c3 nonprofit,&lt;ref name="orgelkidsusa.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Orgelkids USA|url=http://www.orgelkidsusa.org|website=orgelkidsusa.org|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was launched in 2016 with the mission to help grow a nationwide network of independent kits. They helped place five organ kits built by the US builders in their first year. Orgelkids USA kits are being commissioned to serve as regional resources by chapters of the [[American Guild of Organists]] as well as by non-profit organizations whose missions are pipe organ related. 
== Training for organ builders ==
Since 2016, Orgelkids has been supporting the training of organ builders and the passing down of artisanal skills.  Organ building shops can have apprentice builders work on an Orgelkids instrument during their practical training.  In doing so they develop all manner of practical skills which are also needed in the building or restoration of large, monumental organs.  After completion, the organ kit can be made available for educational projects.
For those who wish to build an organ kit themselves, building instructions are available including 20 technical drawings that correspond to the original organ.

== Foundation ==
The Orgelkids project has been brought into the Dutch "Stichting Kerk Muziek Netwerk" (Church Music Network Foundation) since 2013.&lt;ref name=SKMN&gt;Van den Broucke en Vroegindeweij 2016, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; This non-profit foundation engages to make relevant aspects of church music accessible to the greater public.

== Orgelkids USA ==
US-based Orgelkids USA&lt;ref name="orgelkidsusa.org" /&gt; was founded in June 2015 as a program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OrgelKids - USA, Pipe Speak, 1st November 2015, Volume 6 No. 3|url=http://agoeugene.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Nov-2015-Newsletter-Final.pdf|website=Eugene American Guild of Organists|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Eugene Oregon USA chapter of the American Guild of Organists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eugene AGO|url=http://agoeugene.org/|website=Eugene American Guild of Organists|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later incorporated on 29 August 2016 as a section-501(c)(3) non-profit organization. Orgelkids USA shares a similar educational and outreach agenda&lt;ref name="orgelkidsusa.org" /&gt; as the original Netherlands-based Orgelkids organization, serving as a pilot program for the US and helping grow a nationwide network of independent organ kits.

'''Pseudophilosophy''' is a term, often considered derogatory{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}, applied to criticize philosophical ideas or systems which are claimed not to meet an expected set of standards. The etymology of the term is based on appending the prefix [[pseudo-]] ("false") to the word [[philosophy]] ("love of wisdom"); another term to describe false philosophy is "cod philosophy".

==Targets==
{{Cleanup-list|section|date=August 2016}}
The term has been used against many different targets, including:
* To criticise [[dogmatism]] in general, “which is dissolved when philosophy incorporates the scientific method”;{{sfn|Kearney|Rainwater|1996|p=60}}
* To criticise any philosophy in general which does not meet the criteria of [[Analytic philosophy|analytical]] or [[Positivism|positivistic philosophy]];{{sfn|Taylor|Kelly|2013|p=116-117}} 
* To criticise specific philosophical schools, traditions and systems:
** [[Platonism]] as "dogmatic [[metaphysics]]"{{sfn|Baur|Dahlstrom|1999|p=37}}{{refn|group=note|Kant called Plato's ideas "dogmatic metaphysics" and "mysticism".{{sfn|Baur|Dahlstrom|1999|p=37}}}}
** [[scholasticism]]{{sfn|Nichols|1997|p=326}} and [[Medieval philosophy]];{{sfn|Inglis|1998|p=31, 34-35}}
** [[Romanticism|Romantic]]{{sfn|Pieper|2006}}{{sfn|Bunge|2010|p=260}} philosophy, which is based on feeling and intuition, not on discursive thought,{{sfn|Pieper|2006}} "giving up rationality"{{sfn|Bunge|2010|p=260}}
* To criticise some forms of idealism:
** [[German idealism]],{{sfn|Bunge|2010|p=260}} especially [[Hegel]];{{sfn|Schopenhauer|1965|p=15-16}}{{refn|group=note|Bunge mentions Hegel, Fichte, Schelling, "and their Britisn followers".{{sfn|Bunge|2010|p=260}}}}
** [[Continental philosophy]];{{sfn|Soccio|2011|p=497}}{{sfn|Kritzman|Reilly|2007|p=368}}{{refn|group=note|Soccio mentions Heidegger;{{sfn|Soccio|2011|p=497}} Kritzman mentions [[Albert Camus]].{{sfn|Kritzman|Reilly|2007|p=368}}}}
** [[Positivism|positivistic philosophy]]{{sfn|Von Hildebrand|1960|p=7}}
* To label entire specific political worldviews as illogical:
** [[Marxism]];{{sfn|Fletcher Luther|Neumaier|Parsons|1995|p=70}}
** [[Nazism]];{{sfn|Kolinsky|Paterson|1976|p=79}}{{sfn|Wiener|2010|p=76}}{{sfn|Lepenies|2009|p=110}}
** [[Ayn Rand]]'s [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]];&lt;ref name="chait"&gt;[https://newrepublic.com/blog/jonathan-chait/87328/ayn-rands-pseudo-philosophy Jonathan Chait, ''Ayn Rand's Pseudo-Philosophy''.

* To criticise several ([[Pseudoscience|pseudo]])sciences:
** [[Social Darwinism]];{{sfn|Adler|Pouwels|2010|p=545}}
** [[Psychoanalysis]];{{sfn|Clark|1992|p=4}}{{Full citation needed|date=February 2018}}{{refn|group=note|Clarke: "The 'official' Freudian of Jung is expressed by [[Ernest Jones]], Freud's disciple and biographer, who commented that after his early important studies in word-association techniques and schizophrenia, Jung descended 'into pseudo-philosophy out of which he never emerged'."{{sfn|Clark|1992|p=4}}{{Full citation needed|date=February 2018}}}} 
* To criticise some [[Religion|theistic worldviews]]:
** [[Catholicism]];{{sfn|McGrath|2006|p=49}}{{refn|group=note|Heidegger "lambastes Catholicism as a "dogmatic and casuistic pseudo-philosophy, which poses as a particular system of religion," a system that "totally excludes an original and genuine religious experience of value."{{sfn|McGrath|2006|p=49}}}}
** [[Mysticism]];{{sfn|Clark|2013|p=26}}
** Modern [[spirituality]] and [[esotericism]]{{refn|group=note|Irwin and Gracia: "Philosophy needs to replace pseudo-philosophy (crystals, astrology, tarot cards)".{{sfn|Irwin|Gracia|2007|p=48}}}}

==Definitions==
According to Christopher Heumann, an 18th-century scholar, pseudo-philosophy has six characteristics:{{sfn|Hanegraaf|2012|p=131-134}}
# A preference for useless speculation
# It appeals merely to human authority
# It appeals to tradition instead of reason
# It syncretises philosophy with superstition
# It has a preference for obscure and enigmatic language and symbolism
# It is immoral

According to [[Michael Oakeshott]], pseudo-philosophy "is theorizing that proceeds partly within and partly outside a given mode of inquiry."{{sfn|Nardin|2001}}

Pieper notes that there cannot be a closed system of philosophy, and that any philosophy that claims to have discovered a "cosmic formula" is a pseudo-philosophy.{{sfn|Pieper|2006}} In this he follows Kant, who rejected the postulation of a "highest principle" from which to develop [[Transcendental idealism]], calling this pseudo-philosophy and mysticism.{{sfn|Baur|Dahlstrom|1999|p=37}}

[[Nicholas Rescher]], in ''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'', describes ''pseudo-philosophy'' as "deliberations that masquerade as philosophical but are inept, incompetent, deficient in intellectual seriousness, and reflective of an insufficient commitment to the pursuit of truth." Rescher adds that the term is particularly appropriate when applied to "those who use the resources of reason to substantiate the claim that rationality is unachievable in matters of inquiry."

==History==
{{See also|Philosophy}}

According to Pieper, for Pythagoras, Plato and Aristotle philosophy  is the human search "oriented toward [[Sophia (wisdom)|wisdom]] such as God possesses".{{sfn|Pieper|2006}} It suggests that philosophy includes, in its essence, an orientation toward theology.{{sfn|Pieper|2006}} Pieper notes:
{{quote|Thus something is being expressed here that clearly contradicts what in the modern age has become the accepted notion of philosophy; for this new conception of philosophy assumes that it is the decisive feature of philosophical thought to disentangle itself from theology, faith and tradition.{{sfn|Pieper|2006}}}}

The term "pseudo-philosophy" appears to have been coined by [[Jane Austen]].{{sfn|Johnson|Tuite|2011}}

[[Ernest Newman]] (30 November 1868 – 7 July 1959), an English music critic and [[musicologist]], who aimed at intellectual objectivity in his style of criticism, in contrast to the more subjective approach of other critics, published in 1897 ''Pseudo-Philosophy at the End of the Nineteenth Century'', a critique of imprecise and subjective writing.

==Usage==
The term is almost always used [[pejorative]]ly and is often contentious.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Romanticism===
{{Main|Romanticism}}{{See also|Age of Enlightenment}}

According to Bunge,
{{quote|Pseudophilosophy is nonsense parading as deep philosophy. It may have existed since Lao-Tzu, but it was not taken seriously until about 1800, when the Romantics challenged the Enlightenment. By giving up rationality, they generated a lot of pseudophilosophy.{{sfn|Bunge|2010|p=260}}}}

For Kant, intellectual knowledge is discursive knowledge, not intuitive knowledge.{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=14}} According to Kant, intuition is limited to the realm of senses, while knowledge is "essentially realised in the acts of researching, relating, comparing, differentiating, inferring, proving".{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=14}} Kant criticised Romantic philosophy, which is based on feeling and intuition,{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=13}} and not on "philosophical work":{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=13}}
{{quote|In philosophy, Kant writes, "the law of reason, of acquiring possessions through work", prevails. And because it is not work, the Romantic philosophy is not genuine philosophy - an objection that is also leveled by Kant against Plato, the "father of all rapturous fantasizing in philosophy", while it is noted, with both approval and assent, that "the philosophy of Aristotle is, by contrast, work".{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=13-14}}}}

Kant called Romantic philosophy pseudo-philosophy, "in which one is entitled not to work, but only to heed and enjoy the oracle in oneself in order to take complete possession of that wisdom toward which philosophy aims".{{sfn|Pieper|2006|p=14}}

===Mysticism===
{{Main|Mysticism}}

Mysticism has a long history. In the Age of Enlightenment mysticism had fallen into disrepute.{{sfn|Clark|2013|p=26}} Kant called mysticism pseudophilosophy.{{sfn|Clark|2013|p=26}} In the 19th century, with the rise of Romanticism, interest in mysticism was renewed. Rationalists and Lutherans wrote histories of mysticism to reject its claims, but there was a widespread interest in spiritualism and related phenomena.{{sfn|Clark|2013|p=26}}

Interest in [[Meister Eckhart|Eckhart's works]] was revived in the early nineteenth century, especially by German Romantics and [[German idealism|Idealist]] philosophers.{{sfn|McGinn|2001|p=1}}{{sfn|Hackett|2012|p=xxvii}} Since the 1960s debate has been going on in Germany whether Eckhart should be called a "mystic".{{sfn|Hackett|2012|p=xxii}} The philosopher Karl Albert had already argued that Eckhart had to be placed in the tradition of philosophical mysticism of [[Parmenides]], [[Plato]], [[Plotinus]], [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], [[Proclus]] and other [[Neoplatonism|neo-Platonistic]] thinkers.{{sfn|Hackett|2012|p=xxiii}} Heribert Fischer argued in the 1960s that Eckhart was a mediaeval theologian.{{sfn|Hackett|2012|p=xxiii}}

===German Idealism===
{{Main|German Idealism}}

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] wrote the following about [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]:
{{quote|If I were to say that the so-called philosophy of this fellow Hegel is a colossal piece of mystification which will yet provide posterity with an inexhaustible theme for laughter at our times, that it is a pseudophilosophy paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking, and, by the most outrageous misuse of language, putting in its place the hollowest, most senseless, thoughtless, and, as is confirmed by its success, most stupefying verbiage, I should be quite right.{{sfn|Schopenhauer|1965|p=15-16}}}}

However his opinion is not widely held of Hegelianism or German Idealism.

===Continental philosophy===
{{Main|Continental philosophy|Analytic philosophy}}

Soccio notes that analytical inclined philosophers tend to dismiss Heidegger's philosophy as pseudophilosophy.{{sfn|Soccio|2011|p=497}} According to Christensen, Heidegger himself called the philosophy of Husserl ''scheinphilosophy''.{{sfn|Christensen|2008|p=7}}

===Scientism===
{{Main|Scientism}}

[[Dietrich von Hildebrand]] used the term to critique the central place modern science is occupying in western society:
{{quote|This pseudo philosophy, in which science takes the place of metaphysics and religion, more and more corrodes the life of man, making him more and more blind to the real cosmos, in all its plenitude, depth and mystery ... Today we are witnessing a revolt against the deformation expressed in this pseudo philosophy.{{sfn|Von Hildebrand|1960|p=7}}}}

===Objectivism===
{{Main|Objectivism (Ayn Rand)}}
Jonathan Chait  used  the term in the title "Ayn Rand's Pseudo-Philosophy" of an article in ''New Republic'', in which he wrote, "She was a true amateur who insisted on seeing herself as the greatest human being who ever lived because she was almost completely unfamiliar with the entire philosophical canon."&lt;ref name="chait"/&gt;

'''"Putin. War"''' ({{lang-ru|Путин. Война}}) is a report based on materials prepared by the Russian opposition politician [[Boris Nemtsov]] about the [[2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine]]. Published on the website ''Putin. Itogi'' on 12 May 2015, it covers the preparations for the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]] and the involvement of Russian troops in the [[war in Donbass]]. The report includes testimonials of Russian soldiers taken prisoner in Ukraine and photos of Russian military personnel who died in the hostilities.&lt;ref name=RFE-200/&gt;&lt;ref name=MT150512/&gt;&lt;ref name=Meduza150513/&gt;

==Authors==
[[Boris Nemtsov]] began working on the report at the end of January 2015. After [[Assassination of Boris Nemtsov|Nemtsov's assassination]], his close associate [[Ilya Yashin]] headed a team of opposition journalists and activists, who continued writing the report and prepared it for publication.&lt;ref name=RFE-friends/&gt;

[[File:2015-03-01 Шествие памяти Немцова L1520063 Путин — это война.jpg|300px|thumb|"Putin is war"]]

==Structure and content==
The [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] of the report is a post by Boris Nemtsov in Facebook on 31 January 2015:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/boris.nemtsov/posts/758395224230080&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The task of the opposition today is education and truth.&lt;br /&gt;And the truth is that Putin is war and crisis.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The report consists of a preface, 11 chapters and a conclusion. It has 65 large-format pages with 46 color photographs and 8 charts.

Chapters:
#Why [[Vladimir Putin|Putin]] needs this war
#Lies and propaganda
#How they took Crimea
#The Russian military in the east of Ukraine
#Volunteers or mercenaries?
#[[Cargo 200 (code name)|Cargo 200]]
#Vladimir Putin's Army Depot
#Who shot down the [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17|Boeing]]
#Who rules the Donbass
#The humanitarian disaster
#What does the war with Ukraine cost?
Chapters cover the events from the beginning of [[Euromaidan]] when the [[Kremlin]] developed plans for the "annexation of Crimea" up to the start of 2015. The report includes information from relatives of Russian servicemen who died in Ukraine. The authors write that Putin's "[[Hybrid warfare|hybrid war]]" involves [[doublethink]], falsehoods and сowardliness, concluding:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The cowardly and despicable war unleashed by Putin will cost the country a lot. We will be paying for this adventure with the lives of our soldiers, economic crisis and political isolation.

We will pay with enmity from our long-time allies. No people are closer and more like kin to the Russians than the Ukrainians. These are our brothers - without any pathos -- and the war between [[Russians in Ukraine|Russians]] and Ukrainians in Donbass is impossible to characterize in any other way except as fratricide.

This war is the shame of our country. But the problem will not go away by itself. Putin must be stopped. And this can only be done by the Russian people themselves.

Let us stop this war together.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Rules-of-Renovation''' is an educational program that provides training in the [[real estate]] world, specifically home renovation. This program is designed by [[HGTV]] star, [[Hilary Farr]] from ''[[Love It or List It]]''. Farr has many years of experience in real estate and interior design, and has designed Rules of Renovation to help others be successful in the renovation of houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://undercoverrealestate.com/rules-of-renovation-hilary-farr/|title=Rules of Renovation: Hilary Farr|website=Undercover Real Estate|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scamsites.com/review/rules-of-renovation/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Hilary Farr is originally from Canada and was introduced to the real estate world at a young age, by helping her mother decorate her childhood home. Farr was able to move to Los Angeles, where she bought several properties and renovated them. In the beginning, she was working part time jobs, but after a few years her talent for renovation of homes started to gain recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/stage/2016/05/26/hilary-farr-the-new-villainess-in-ross-petty-panto.html|title=‘Love It Or List It’ host the new villainess in Ross Petty panto|first=Bruce|last=DeMara|date=26 May 2016|publisher=|accessdate=27 February 2018|via=Toronto Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://realtytimes.com/advicefromtheexpert/item/1014716-buying-an-old-home-5-steps-to-make-sure-your-renovation-is-effective?rtmpage=lizzieweakley&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nicehomelive.com/old-home-renovations-how-to-update-your-master-bedroom/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Farr was approached by the [[W Network]] to co-host the show ''[[Love It or List It]]'', along with [[David Visentin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://notablelife.com/hilary-farr-redirect-anger-and-be-grateful-for-the-bad/|title=Hilary Farr: Redirect Anger and be Grateful for the Bad - Notable Life|date=17 May 2013|publisher=|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was broadcast on HGTV and the W Network. The show was originally based in Toronto, but in 2014, ''Love It or List It'' began its filming in North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/84797/hilary-farr-talks-about-love-it-or-list-it/|title=Hilary Farr On Mean Homeowners, Hoarders, And Famous Homes She'd Love Or List|publisher=|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hilary Farr co-founded Rules of Renovation to give investors unique strategies on how to successfully renovate homes and then sell them. Investors looking to succeed in the field were invited to register for a free event to see how Rules of Renovation could help their business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rulesofrenovation.com/about/|title=Rules of Renovation details|publisher=|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
While renovating houses and then selling them has became a way for people to make a living, it did not mean that the process is without risk. An investor without the correct tools and strategies has a high chance of making mistakes and failing in the field. Rules of Renovation exploited this market by giving investors the tools for being successful using its trained coaches and their tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/05/house-flipping-is-back-with-all-its-opportunities-and-risks.html|title=House flipping is making a comeback, and that has some people nervous|first=Trent|last=Gillies|date=5 February 2017|publisher=|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://rismedia.com/2017/09/18/real-estate-deal-breakers-how-fix-them-efficiently/&lt;/ref&gt;

This educational program has several different steps offered to investors. First, it starts with a free renovation training event that discusses the basics and shows investors how the program would help them to succeed in their renovations. The second step is a 3-Day Workshop that provides attendees with strategies tailored to each individual. The last step is the ongoing mentoring and coaching. Even after the investors leave the event, they would have access to the coaches and one-on-one trainings for future questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rulesofrenovation.com/faq/|title=Rules of Renovation|publisher=|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Showdown''' is a [[cooperative learning]] technique that allows students to work in a group. It is usually used in [[middle school]] classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=cooperative-learning-showdown|url=http://mathinthemiddleresources.blogspot.in/2012/09/cooperative-learning-showdown.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==

* Students in groups of three or four receive a task card with specific problems from the chapter they are learning about.
* The team leader of the group picks up the card and reads the sentence in it aloud without showing it to the others.
* Other team members write the answers on their paper or chalkboards. When the teacher gives the showdown signal, all the members reveal their responses at once.
* If everyone gets the same answer they can assume the answer is correct. If not, all members need to discuss to see if someone did something wrong and help that student to see what they did wrong.
* For the next task card, a different student on the team becomes the leader.
* The teacher monitors the activity to make sure students are getting the correct answers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Readingonline|url=http://www.readingonline.org/articles/jacobs/showdown.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages claimed for Showdown ==
* It gives opportunity to the individual to expertise their ideas.
* It is easy to perform in a class as it takes less time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kaganonline|url=http://www.kaganonline.com/free_articles/research_and_rationale/increase_achievement.php|website=kaganonline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Software Engineering Body of Knowledge''''' ('''SWEBOK''') is an international standard ISO/IEC TR 19759:2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=33897|title=ISO/IEC TR 19759:2005 |accessdate=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifying a guide to the generally accepted Software Engineering Body of Knowledge.

The Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK Guide) has been created through cooperation among several professional bodies and members of industry and is published by the [[IEEE Computer Society]] ([[IEEE]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Guide to the software engineering body of knowledge : 2004 version," Library of Congress Online Catalog, 2005, http://lccn.loc.gov/2005921729. Retrieved 16 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The standard can be accessed freely from the [[IEEE Computer Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computer.org/portal/web/swebok/home |title=SWEBOK |publisher=Computer.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2013, SWEBOK V3 was approved for publication and released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computer.org/portal/web/pressroom/New-Version-of-Guide-to-the-Software-Engineering-Body-of-Knowledge-Approved |title=New Version of Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge Approved | accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the IEEE Computer Society kicked off the SWEBoK Evolution effort to develop future iterations of the body of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.computer.org/web/peb/swebok-evolution |title=SWEBoK Evolution | accessdate=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SWEBOK Version 3==
The published version of SWEBOK V3 has the following 15 [[knowledge area]]s (KAs) within the field of [[software engineering]]:

* [[Software requirements]]
* [[Software design]]
* [[Software construction]]
* [[Software testing]]
* [[Software maintenance]]
* [[Software configuration management]]
* [[Software engineering management]]
* [[Software engineering process]]
* [[Software engineering]] models and methods
* [[Software quality]]
* [[Software engineering professional practice]]
* [[Software engineering economics]]
* Computing foundations
* Mathematical foundations
* Engineering foundations

It also recognized, but did not define, these related disciplines:

* [[Computer engineering]]
* [[Systems engineering]]
* [[Project management]]
* [[Quality management]]
* General [[management]]
* [[Computer science]]
* [[Mathematics]]

== 2004 Edition of the SWEBOK ==
The 2004 edition of the SWEBOK guide defined ten [[knowledge area]]s (KAs) within the field of [[software engineering]]:
* [[Software requirements]]
* [[Software design]]
* [[Software construction]]
* [[Software testing]]
* [[Software maintenance]]
* [[Software configuration management]]
* Software engineering management ([[Engineering management]])
* [[Software engineering process]]
* [[Software engineering tools and methods]]
* [[Software quality]]

The SWEBOK also defines disciplines related to software engineering:
* [[Computer engineering]]
* [[Computer science]]
* [[Management]]
* [[Mathematics]]
* [[Project management]]
* [[Quality management]]
* Software ergonomics ([[Cognitive ergonomics]])
* [[Systems engineering]]

== Similar Efforts ==
A similar effort to define a body of knowledge for software engineering is the "Computing Curriculum Software Engineering (CCSE)," officially named [[Software Engineering 2004]] (SE2004). The curriculum largely overlaps with the 2004 SWEBOK V2 because the SWEBOK has been used as one of its sources; however, it is more directed towards academia. Whereas the [[SWEBOK]] Guide defines the [[software engineering]] knowledge that practitioners should have after four years of practice, SE2004 defines the knowledge that an [[undergraduate]] software engineering student should possess upon graduation (including knowledge of mathematics, general engineering principles, and other related areas). SWEBOK V3 aims to address these intersections.

'''Sue Sylvester''' is a [[fictional character]] of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] [[musical film|musical]] [[comedy-drama]] series, ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''. The character is portrayed by actress [[Jane Lynch]], and appears in ''Glee'' from its [[Pilot (Glee)|pilot episode]], first broadcast on May 19, 2009, through the show's [[Dreams Come True (Glee)|final episode]], first broadcast on March 25, 2015. Sue was developed by ''Glee'' creators [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]], [[Brad Falchuk]], and [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]]. For the show's first four seasons, Sue is the track-suit wearing coach of the William McKinley High School [[Cheerleader|cheerleading squad]], and a ruthless bully to both students and faculty members alike. Because her cheerleading squad competes with the [[glee club]] for the school's limited funding, she is often at odds with the club and more particularly its director [[Will Schuester]] ([[Matthew Morrison]]). Sue is the main antagonist throughout the series' run. In the show's [[Glee (season 5)|fifth season]], Sue is made the school's new principal, though she is ultimately fired late in the show's [[Glee (season 6)|sixth and final season]].

Due to Lynch's initial limited availability, Sue was originally set to be a recurring character while Lynch was working on a [[Damon Wayans]] [[pilot episode|pilot]] for the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC). When that pilot fell through, Sue became a starring role. The character has been acclaimed by critics. Mary McNamara for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' has written that "Lynch alone makes ''Glee'' worth watching", while ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'s}} Ken Tucker has called Sue "the greatest [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]-musical villain to ever co-star in a TV series". In recognition of her portrayal of Sue, Lynch won an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series|Emmy]] and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film|Golden Globe Award]].

===Season 1===
[[File:Jane Lynch, 2008 appearance (crop).jpg|thumb|upright|Jane Lynch (''pictured'') plays Sue]]

Throughout the [[Glee (season 1)|first season]] of ''Glee'', Sue makes numerous attempts at sabotaging the William McKinley High School [[glee club]], New Directions. She enlists members of her cheerleading squad, the Cheerios, to bring the club down from the inside,&lt;ref name="Showmance"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Showmance |episodelink=Showmance |series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] (director, writer), [[Brad Falchuk]] (writer), Ian Brennan (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=September 9, 2009 |season=1 |number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and conspires to lure away its star member, [[Rachel Berry (Glee)|Rachel Berry]] ([[Lea Michele]]).&lt;ref name="Preggers"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Preggers |episodelink=Preggers |series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Brad Falchuk]] (director, writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=September 23, 2009 |season=1 |number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sue is appointed co-director of the club by [[Principal Figgins]] ([[Iqbal Theba]]),&lt;ref name="Vitamin D"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Vitamin D |episodelink=Vitamin D (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Elodie Keene]] (director), [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=October 7, 2009 |season=1 |number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; but soon scales back her involvement when her attempts to turn the club members against director [[Will Schuester]] ([[Matthew Morrison]]) fail.&lt;ref name="Throwdown"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Throwdown |episodelink=Throwdown (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits= [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] (director), [[Brad Falchuk]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=October 14, 2009 |season=1 |number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoping to ruin the club's chances of winning at the [[show choir]] Sectionals competition, Sue gives New Directions' [[setlist]] to the directors of their rival glee clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Hairography |episodelink=Hairography (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Bill D'Elia]] (director), [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=November 25, 2010 |season=1 |number=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having to devise a new setlist at the last moment, New Directions win by unanimous decision and Sue is suspended by Figgins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Sectionals |episodelink=Sectionals|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Brad Falchuk]] (director, writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=December 9, 2009 |season=1 |number=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; She blackmails him into allowing her back,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Hell-O|episodelink=Hell-O (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Brad Falchuk]] (director), [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=April 13, 2010 |season=1 |number=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is selected as a judge for the show choir Regionals competition. Sue is ridiculed by the other judges for her lack of fame and underdog status, allowing her to empathize with the glee club members. She votes for New Directions to win, and although they place last, she blackmails Figgins into allowing them another year to compete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Journey|episodelink=Journey (Glee)|series=Glee |series-link=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Brad Falchuk]] (director, writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=June 8, 2010 |season=1 |number=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sue's personal life is also explored over the course of the season. She has a commentary feature on the local television news, "Sue's Corner", which she uses to editorialize on issues such as littering and support for [[caning]].&lt;ref name="Preggers"/&gt; She falls in love with news anchor [[Characters of Glee#Rod Remington|Rod Remington]] (Bill A. Jones), but their burgeoning relationship comes to an abrupt end when she discovers he is sleeping with his co-anchor, Andrea Carmichael (Earlene Davis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Mash-Up |episodelink=Mash-Up (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits= [[Elodie Keene]] (director), [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=October 21, 2009 |season=1 |number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode "[[Wheels (Glee)|Wheels]]", Sue allows [[Becky Jackson]] (Lauren Potter), a [[Tenth grade#United States|sophomore]] with [[Down syndrome]], to join the Cheerios. Will is suspicious of her motives, increasingly so when Sue donates money to the school to fund three new ramps for students with disabilities. It is revealed that Sue's older sister Jean (Robin Trocki) also has Down syndrome, and lives in a residential care facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Wheels |episodelink=Wheels (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Paris Barclay]] (director) [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=November 11, 2009 |season=1 |number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sue becomes a minor celebrity when [[Olivia Newton-John]] invites her to remake the video to "[[Physical (Olivia Newton-John song)|Physical]]", after a [[viral video]] of Sue [[Jazzercise|Jazzercising]] to the track achieves internet notoriety.

===Season 2===
At the onset of the [[Glee (season 2)|second season]], Sue has formed a truce with Will, and together they conspire against the school's new football coach, [[Shannon Beiste]] ([[Dot Jones]]). When Will comes to regret his actions and apologizes, Sue renews their enmity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Audition|episodelink=Audition (Glee)|series=Glee |series-link=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Brad Falchuk]] (director), [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=September 21, 2010 |season=2 |number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is appointed acting principal after having Figgins infected with the flu,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Substitute|episodelink=The Substitute (Glee)|series=Glee |series-link=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] (director), [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=November 16, 2010 |season=2 |number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; but although the school board is so impressed with her performance they make her position permanent, she resigns when they refuse to uphold her expulsion of [[Dave Karofsky]] ([[Max Adler (actor)|Max Adler]]), a bully who had threatened to kill glee club member [[Kurt Hummel]] ([[Chris Colfer]]).&lt;ref name="Furt"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Furt|episodelink=Furt|series=Glee |series-link=Glee (TV series) |credits=Carol Banker (director), [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=November 23, 2010 |season=2 |number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Sue learns that Rod and Andrea have become engaged, she announces her intention to marry herself. Her estranged mother Doris ([[Carol Burnett]]), a recently retired [[Nazi hunter]], visits in an attempt to make amends for her absentee parenting, but is continuously critical of her daughter, to the point that Sue disinvites her during her wedding ceremony. Doris leaves, and Sue and Jean comfort each other.&lt;ref name="Furt"/&gt;

Sue grows disillusioned with cheerleading, and in an effort to recapture her love for it, plans to fire cheerleader [[Brittany Pierce]] ([[Heather Morris]]) from a cannon during the team's next competitive routine. Brittany and her friends [[Santana Lopez]] ([[Naya Rivera]]) and [[Quinn Fabray]] ([[Dianna Agron]]) ultimately quit the squad, which loses at Regionals after having won the national title for six straight years. Sue is named Loser of the Year in a televised interview with [[Katie Couric]], and has her budget slashed. Depressed, Sue stages a fake suicide, and as she hoped would happen, is convinced to temporarily join the glee club to lift her spirits, though she really wants to bring down the club from within. When her attempts to do so fail, Sue decides to become the coach of Aural Intensity, one of New Directions' Regionals competitors, and deliberately injures their director in order to get the job. Sue is furious when her club loses to New Directions, and punches the announcer in the face.&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/glee-recap-new-directions-head-to-regionals-in-original-song-20110316|title='Glee' Recap: New Directions Head to Regionals in 'Original Song'|last=Futterman|first=Erica|date=March 16, 2011|work=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner]]|accessdate=March 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More intent than ever on destroying the glee club, Sue forms a "League of Doom", which consists of former glee club director [[Sandy Ryerson]] ([[Stephen Tobolowsky]]), the coach of rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline, [[Dustin Goolsby]] ([[Cheyenne Jackson]]), and Will's ex-wife [[Terri Schuester]] ([[Jessalyn Gilsig]]). Their first mission, to ruin a New Directions benefit, fails when Sandy is won over by a performance from [[Mercedes Jones]] ([[Amber Riley]]) and donates the full amount needed. Devastated by Jean's death from pneumonia, Sue turns to Terri, who has the glee club's plane tickets for Nationals changed from New York to [[Tripoli]]. She also removes Becky from the Cheerios, because she reminds her of her sister. Kurt and his stepbrother [[Finn Hudson]] ([[Cory Monteith]]) help Sue to clean out Jean's things, and she accepts their offer to have New Directions perform at the funeral, as she is afraid no one else will come. At the well-attended funeral service, an emotional Sue is unable to continue reading her [[eulogy]] after a few sentences, and Will reads the remainder for her. Touched by his support, Sue tells Will he is a good friend and she will no longer go after the glee club. She will instead be running for the [[United States House of Representatives]] on a platform of lowering health care costs, as her sister had faced significantly higher bills in her last few years. She then apologizes to Becky, reinstates her as a member of the Cheerios, and tells her she will be captain of the squad next year. As a final act of reconciliation, Sue asks for and receives a hug from Becky.

===Season 3===
At the start of the [[Glee (season 3)|third season]], Sue's campaign for Congress is not going well. She decides to pledge to get rid of all arts programs in schools, music and theater especially, until all students are reading at or above grade level. Will's attempt to embarrass Sue and highlight the value of the arts by [[glitter bombing]] her backfires, and Sue's poll numbers rise. She also goes back on her promise to leave the glee club alone by having her new cheerleading co-captains, Becky and Santana, sabotage the club's recruitment drive. She rails against the school musical, and succeeds in having its funding rescinded. This angers Kurt's father, [[Burt Hummel]] ([[Mike O'Malley]]), who arranges for local businesses to sponsor the musical, and he enters the congressional race as a write-in candidate to defeat her. Sue runs a negative campaign, airing political ads containing false statements about Burt's personal life through her political ads. One of the other candidates in the race discovers that Santana is a lesbian, and uses this to attack Sue on the issue of "family values" for appointing her a cheerleading captain, and to imply that Sue herself is a lesbian. Santana is devastated, as she has not yet come out as a lesbian. Sue attempts to combat the implications by starting a relationship with one of her former bed partners, Ohio State football recruiter Cooter Menkins, who had recently been dating Coach Beiste. Being seen in public with Cooter does not help her in the voting, however; she comes in third, and Burt wins.

In the episode "[[On My Way (Glee)|On My Way]]", Sue reveals she is pregnant, shocking everyone. Her child is revealed by doctors to be a girl, but they mention that there were abnormalities on the scan. Sue mentions to Becky that she will have a child just like her, hinting that the baby may have Down's Syndrome. She shows unusual compassion, telling Will she will help him win nationals, letting Quinn rejoin the Cheerios, and is visibly upset at Karofsky's suicide attempt.

===Season 4===
In the first episode of the [[Glee (season 4)|fourth season]], "[[The New Rachel]]", Sue, now a mother, introduces her newborn child named Robin to [[Kurt Hummel|Kurt]]. Sue then calls Kitty, a new cheerleader into her office to take Robin from her. Sue has a storyline with [[Alex Newell]]'s character, [[Wade Adams|Wade "Unique" Adams]], when she doesn't want him to audition for the role of Rizzo on the school's musical, ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]''. Also, when [[Finn Hudson|Finn]] insults Robin, calling her "retarded", they start a strong rivalry. Sue "proposes" to Finn that if New Directions lose sectionals, the glee club would end. They lose and Sue uses the choir room for the Cheerios practices when the weather is cold. When New Directions discover that they won because the other club cheated, Sue gives them back the choir room.
 
Sue is fired from the William McKinley High School in "[[Shooting Star (Glee)|Shooting Star]]", when Becky's gun is shot by accident, causing everyone to think that there's a school shooting. Sue says it was her gun and she misfired it while checking it, to protect Becky. Coach Roz replaces Sue as the cheerleader squad coach and takes her office. Sue later starts working as a personal trainer, and [[Blaine Anderson|Blaine]] tries to get her back on McKinley's faculty, but she denies his offer by saying that getting fired was the best thing that could have ever happened to her, because now, as a trainer, people respect her, and also admits that she does not miss the Cheerios at all.

===Season 5===
In the episode "[[Love Love Love (Glee)|Love Love Love]]," Sue has come back to McKinley High after Becky confessed to the shooting. Upon her return, Sue gets Principal Figgins fired by faking incriminating details about him. He is demoted to janitor, while she takes his job as principal, where she constantly torments Figgins, and tells Will and Roz that she will keep the Cheerios and New Directions going if they win in their upcoming competitions.

Following Finn's death in the episode "[[The Quarterback (Glee)|The Quarterback]]," Sue orders the memorial in the school to be taken down, which angers Santana to the point where she confronts her and pushes her into a filing cabinet. She later reveals, after Santana apologizes to her, she is heartbroken Finn died believing she hated him, while she actually respected him and looked forward to having him as a colleague. In "[[Puppet Master (Glee)|Puppet Master]]" She experiences a hallucination in the choir room, later to be a gas leak. After fixing the pipe herself, she then becomes the school's permanent principal. In "[[City of Angels (Glee)|City Of Angels]]", after New Directions comes in second in their Nationals competition, Sue fires Will and disbands the club, although she gets Will a job at Carmel High School as the new Coach for Vocal Adrenaline.

===Season 6===
In "[[A Wedding (Glee)|A Wedding]]", Sue tries to attend Brittany and Santana's wedding only to be flatly refused for her treatment of everyone. Showing a softer side, Sue visits Santana's grandmother who doesn't believe in two women marrying and uses "some reverse Suecology" to get the woman to see that no matter what she believes, family is most important. Sue is then allowed to attend the wedding and helps convince [[Kurt Hummel]] and [[Blaine Anderson]] to marry alongside Brittany and Santana, providing the rings for them when they don't have any. Sue later provides the two couples with their dream honeymoons, telling them that despite how she's treated them over the years, she's come to see them like her own kids. She is fired as principal in "[[The Rise and Fall of Sue Sylvester]]".

By 2020, Sue is the Republican [[Vice President of the United States]] to President [[Jeb Bush]]. She is planning on running for President in 2024. She rededicates the McKinley High auditorium to be named in honor of Finn Hudson while apologizing for her previous poor perception of the glee club. McKinley High has now become a model of excellence and other schools are copying its format. New Directions members from years past and present unite for one last massive group song, with Sue and Becky (now working as Sue's bodyguard) joining the entire cast for one final bow.

==Development==
===Casting and creation===
Sue is played by Jane Lynch. The character did not exist when the script for the ''Glee'' pilot was first submitted to Fox. In an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Ryan Murphy said that Fox Entertainment president Kevin Reilly was responsible for her creation. {{" '}}On our first call, Kevin said, "You need a villain,{{" '}} Murphy remembered. 'And I said, "You know, you're right." I knew exactly who she is. I said, "Her name is Sue Sylvester. And she is the cheerleading coach. And she may be on horse estrogen.{{" ' "}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20386845,00.html |title={{-'}}Glee': The show heard round the world|last=Stack|first=Tim|date=May 21, 2010|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The casting notice described Sue as "the anal, tightly wound, and ruthlessly ambitious leader of the Harrison High cheer leading squad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=7825 |title=Development Update: Thursday, October 30|author=The Futon Critic Staff|date=October 30, 2008|work=thefutoncritic.com|accessdate=September 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time she was cast as Sue, Lynch was already committed to do a [[Damon Wayans]] [[pilot episode|pilot]] for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The ''Glee'' role initially had her as a guest star, in the hope that she could become a regular in the future. When the ABC pilot fell through, Lynch became a series regular.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/18/jane-lynch-brings-her-inner-mean-girl-to-glee/|title=Jane Lynch Brings Her Inner Mean Girl to ‘Glee’|last=Itzkoff|first=David|date=May 18, 2009|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=May 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characterization===
Sue is initially presented as the glee club's "arch-nemesis".&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Following the [[Pilot (Glee)|pilot episode]], Lynch said she is "pure evil and doesn't hide it",&lt;ref name="NYPost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/popwrap/item_sbUrfetlC9ck0hU9lqw0eM;jsessionidpi=9918A97B8F5FD78BFB117297FD0F4B98|title=Meet The Cast of 'Glee,' I Did!|last=Wieselman|first=Jarett|date=May 19, 2009|work=[[New York Post]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|accessdate=June 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; explaining that she was created as a product of Murphy, Brennan and Falchuk's "inner mean girl".&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Lynch feels that Sue has the ability to be both "horrible and really delightful at the same time",&lt;ref name="Lynch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2009/09/qa-jane-lynch-might-just-slip-you-a-mickey.html|title=Q&amp;A: Jane Lynch Might Just Slip You a Mickey|last=Spitznagel|first=Eric|date=September 4, 2009|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications]]|accessdate=September 5, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907120405/http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2009/09/qa-jane-lynch-might-just-slip-you-a-mickey.html|archivedate=September 7, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; assessing that she continually speaks her mind as she enjoys appalling people with the things she says.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt; She encapsulates Sue's world view as being about "power and winning", stating that she will do anything to win.&lt;ref name="Lynch"/&gt; Sue's softer side manifests following the revelation that her sister has Down syndrome.

Sue lobbies against the performance of spiritual songs in school, engaging in a philosophical argument on the matter with school guidance counselor [[Emma Pillsbury]] ([[Jayma Mays]]), which Murphy describes as the scene he is "most proud to have been involved with in [his] entire career."&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt; On the fifth-season episode "[[Puppet Master (Glee)|Puppet Master]]", the reason behind Sue's track suit outfit was revealed. It was because she felt that she never received the respect she deserved as a teacher and even the then [[Principal Figgins]] "insulted" her and said that she was a cheerleading coach so she needed to "try some pants" because she was wearing an office skirt and that she had long hair. She said that the moment she put the track suit on, "the world bowed before her" and that she "had one made in every color".

Numerous biologists ([[malacologist]]s) and [[citizen scientist]]s, including many [[scuba diver]]s, study the marine [[mollusk]]s known as [[opisthobranch]]s, which are a large and diverse group of shelled and (mostly) shell-less, saltwater gastropods, the common name for which is [[sea slug]]s (including [[nudibranch]]s, [[sacoglossa]]ns, etc) and bubble snails. '''Symposia and workshops on opisthobranchs''' are meetings where those who specialize in studying these animals meet, in order to share ideas, information and knowledge.

== History ==
[[File:Pectenodoris trilineata.jpg|thumb|''[[Pectenodoris trilineata]]'', a nudibranch]]
Meetings of an informal group of opisthobranch scientists have occurred in the past.

==A day to celebrate sea slugs==
A concept which has been raised at these meetings is the idea of a calendar day on which to celebrate [[nudibranch]]s or sea slugs in general. In 2015, in Southern California, "'''Sea Slug Day'''" was October 29, "the birthday of [[Terry Gosliner]] from the San Francisco's [[California Academy of Sciences]]"&lt;ref&gt;Website, last, "It's Sea Slug Day: Here Are 8 Adorable Ones You Can Find in SoCal", by Carmen TSE Oct 29, 2015, 5:45 pm, [http://laist.com/2015/10/29/sea_slug_day.php#photo-1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105173235/http://laist.com/2015/10/29/sea_slug_day.php |date=2017-11-05 }}, Accessed 2016.3.7&lt;/ref&gt; (Gosliner is an expert on nudibranchs). Alternatively,  "'''International Nudibranch Day'''" was suggested in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Website, Krug Lab - Larval Ecology and Evolution, "Web resources", [http://instructional1.calstatela.edu/pkrug/lab/web_resources.htm], Accessed 2016.3.7&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tarbiat library''' ({{lang-fa|کتابخانه تربیت}}) is the first state library in Iran, established in 1921 at [[Tabriz]]. The library was founded by [[Mahammad Ali Tarbiat]], Iranian journalist and politician as "Ma'aref public library and reading room" ({{lang-fa|كتابخانه و قرائتخانه عمومي معارف}}) which was later renamed after its founder to Tarbiat library.

'''''The Goose-step: A Study of American Education''''' is a book, published in 1923, by the American novelist and [[muckraking]] journalist [[Upton Sinclair]]. It is an [[Investigative journalism|investigation]] into the consequences of [[plutocracy|plutocratic]] [[capitalism|capitalist]] control of American colleges and universities. Sinclair writes, “Our educational system is not a public service, but an instrument of special privilege; its purpose is not to further the welfare of mankind, but merely to keep America capitalist." (p.&amp;nbsp;18)

The book is one of the “Dead Hand” series: six books Sinclair wrote on American [[institution]]s. The series also includes ''[[The Profits of Religion]]'', ''The Brass Check'' (journalism), ''The Goslings'' (elementary and high school education), ''[[Mammonart]]'' (great literature, art and music) and ''Money Writes!'' (literature). The term “Dead Hand” criticizes [[Adam Smith]]’s concept that allowing an "invisible hand" of capitalist greed to shape economic relations provides the best result for society as a whole.

== Context ==
Published in 1923, ''The Goose-step'' was written during the post–[[World War I]] [[First Red Scare|Red Scare]]. It was a time of great political awareness and activism on both [[Left-wing politics|left]] and [[Right-wing politics|right]] in the United States. On the left, there was widespread interest in [[Socialism]] and [[Communism]], especially in the results of the 1917 [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]]. [[Populism|Populist]] ideas were still alive, and [[Anarchism]] was in the news, with the Italian anarchists [[Sacco-Vanzetti|Sacco and Vanzetti]] arraigned in 1920 for a robbery and murder. On the right, the anti-German [[jingoism]] and florid patriotism of the war years had stirred up passions against [[pacifism]] and ‘foreign’ ideas such as Socialism and Communism. The [[Palmer raids]] against suspected radicals occurred in 1919, and superpatriotic organizations like the business-sponsored, anti-union Better America Foundation worked to shape public opinion.

Critiques of higher education had recently appeared, such as [[Thorstein Veblen]]’s 1918 book ''[http://socserv2.mcmaster.ca/%7Eecon/ugcm/3ll3/veblen/higher The Higher Learning in America].''

Sinclair spent a year traveling the country for the book and interviewed over a thousand persons. (Like American filmmaker [[Michael Moore]], Sinclair makes the rejection he received part of the story.) Sinclair also used [[primary source]]s like letters, and [[secondary source]]s like student newspapers.

Sinclair had studied at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]], and the book’s longest section attacks Columbia and its president, [[Nicholas Murray Butler]].

Sinclair originally intended to also critique elementary and high schools, but because of length he saved that material for another book, published in 1924 as ''The Goslings.''

== Title ==
Contemporary readers would have recognized the title, ''The [[Stechschritt|Goose-step]],'' as referring to the authoritarian  [[Prussia]]n culture of Germany, which the United States had recently defeated in [[World War I]]. With the title, Sinclair implies that students in American universities and colleges were being trained to think in unison like German students. This is not surprising, he implies, as the presidents of major universities--[[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[University of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], [[Yale University|Yale]], [[University of California|University of California-Berkeley]] and [[Leland Stanford Jr. University|Stanford]] (p. 115), and the chancellor of [[New York University]] (p. 314)--had studied in Germany. “Everyone (sic) of them learned the Goose-step under the [[William II, German Emperor|Kaiser]]!” (p.&amp;nbsp;115)

== Organization ==
To explain how higher education is controlled by financial interests, Sinclair quotes from a report of the 1913 [[Arsène Pujo|Pujo Committee]] of the [[United States House of Representatives]].

:"[[Interlocking directorate]]s" are "the device whereby three great banks in New York, with two [[Trust company|trust companies]] under their control, manage the financial affairs and direct the policies of a hundred and twelve key [[corporation]]s of America. The three banks are [[J. P. Morgan &amp; Co.|J. P. Morgan and Company]], the First National Bank, and the [[National City Bank of New York|National City Bank]]; and the two trust companies are the [http://www.modernhistoryproject.org/mhp/EntityDisplay.php?Entity=GuarTrustCo Guaranty] and the [[AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company|Equitable]]. Their directors sit upon the [[Board of directors|boards]] of the corporations, sometimes several on each board, and their orders are obeyed because they control [[Credit (finance)|credit]], which is the life-blood of our business world." (p. 19)

The interlocking directorate was equally well represented on the [[Board of Trustees|boards of trustees]] of American universities. Sinclair cites a survey by [[Evans Clark]], "a [[preceptor]] in [[Princeton University]]--until he made this survey." Of the boards of the 29 largest universities, "the plutocratic class…composed 56 per cent of the membership of the privately controlled boards, and 68 per cent of the publicly controlled boards.” In contrast, the board members included 4-6 per cent farmers, no representatives of labor, and no inhouse professors to represent the [[Faculty (university)|faculty]]. (Clark's findings were confirmed by a 1917 study by [[Scott Nearing]].)

For each school (see below), Sinclair describes how the interlocking directorate exercises its influence on the school's Board of Trustees. Bankers and powerful local businessmen dominate the boards, ensuring that school policies support their class interest.

This occurs in various ways. The school president serves the board rather than the educational interest of the students. Unqualified but politically conservative men are hired as administrators or professors. University funds are invested at artificially low interest rates at favored banks. Schools purchase land from people in their administration. The administration represses radical students and prohibits speeches by Socialists like Sinclair. Students at state universities, which are funded by the public, are nevertheless taught to serve the interests of the rich.

A major theme is professors' inability to speak freely in or out of class without fearing for their jobs ([[academic freedom]]). Rather, the Board of Trustees, acting through the school's president, suppressed any criticism of the status quo. Many faculty members were dismissed, driven out or denied promotion because of their political activities or views. Sinclair says that academic freedom was suppressed at church-sponsored and tax-supported (state) schools, as well as at private ones. Only one or two faculty members allowed Sinclair to use their names.

:"I talked with another professor at [[University of Chicago|Chicago]], who does not want his name used. I asked him what he thought about the status of his profession, and he gave the best description of academic freedom in America that I have yet come upon. He said, 'We are good cows; we stand quietly in our [[stanchion]]s, and give down our milk at regular hours. We are free, because we have no desire to do anything but what we are told we ought to do. And we die of premature senility.'" (p. 247)

Other chapters deal with the importance of keeping the support of wealthy and politically conservative alumni/donors, and the influence of plutocrat-founded policy organizations like [[Andrew Carnegie]]'s [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]] and [[John D. Rockefeller]]’s [[General Education Board]]. A chapter, "The Academic [[Pogrom]]," concerns some institutions’ efforts to reduce the number of [[Jewish]] students and applicants. Final chapters support the alternative of workers’ education and labor colleges.

Among his prescriptions for change, Sinclair wanted more professors to unionize by joining the [[American Association of University Professors]] (only 2-3 per cent were unionized). He also wanted college students to experience real life: they should visit jails and work in factories, or alternatively have prisoners and labor leaders speak at their schools.

== Critical reactions ==
Critics have usually praised ''The Goose-step'' for bringing an enormous mass of information together in an engaging and readable book. It is “muckraking at its best”,&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, Granville, "The Survival of Upton Sinclair"'' College English'' 4 (4) (Jan., 1943), 213-20.&lt;/ref&gt; an “honest effort to find out the truth”&lt;ref name="Alvord"&gt;Alvord, Clarence W., ''The Goose-Step'' (Review), ''The Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' 10 (3) (Dec., 1923), pp. 336-7.&lt;/ref&gt; and "indispensable to any student of present American life."&lt;ref name="Lovett"&gt;Lovett, Robert Morss, "Upton Sinclair," ''The English Journal'' 17 (9) (Nov., 1928), 706-14.&lt;/ref&gt; While they rarely if ever find errors of fact,&lt;ref name="Lovett"/&gt; they criticize Sinclair's interpretation as oversimplified: plutocrats are not responsible for all the problems with higher education.

Regarding suppression of academic freedom, one critic argues that “many [cases], perhaps a majority, were the result of war hysteria and should not be regarded as typical.”&lt;ref name="Alvord"/&gt;

'''The National Strategies''' were professional programmes aiming for improvements in the quality of learning and teaching in [[schools]] in [[England]], delivered on behalf of the [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]]. The National Strategies were first introduced in 1998 and were a key national delivery vehicle for many new and existing [[government]] learning priorities.

The programmes provided a mix of resources and services that supported improvements in the quality of learning and teaching in schools, [[colleges]] and early years settings. A key aim of The National Strategies was to help these educational settings raise children's standards of attainment and improve their life chances.

The National Strategies mission was “To raise standards of achievement and rates of progression for children and young people in all phases and settings through personalised learning with a particular focus on the core subjects and early years”. The National Strategies web area, which was closed in 2011, was recognised by the Web Marketing Association Awards as ‘outstanding’ in the categories ‘Best Government Website’ and ‘Best Education Website’.

==Tokugawa bureaucrat training center==
[[File:YushimaSeido8678.jpg|thumb|Colonnade at the reconstructed ''Yushima Seidō'']]
The Yushima Seidō has its origins in a private Confucian temple, the Sensei-den (先聖殿), constructed in 1630 by the [[neo-Confucian]] scholar [[Hayashi Razan]] (1583–1657) in his grounds at Shinobi-ga-oka (now in [[Ueno Park]]). The fifth [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] ''[[shōgun]]'', [[Tsunayoshi]], moved the building to its present site in 1690, where it became the Taiseiden (大成殿) of Yushima Seidō. The Hayashi school of Confucianism moved at the same time.

Under the [[Kansei Edict]], which made neo-Confucianism the official philosophy of Japan, the Hayashi school was transformed into a state-run school under the control of the shogunate in 1797. The school was known as the Shōhei-zaka Gakumonjo (昌平坂学問所) or Shōheikō (昌平黌), after [[Confucius]]'s birthplace, Changping (昌平, pronounced ''Shōhei'' in Japanese). During the time of the Tokugawa shogunate, the school attracted many men of talent, but it was closed in 1871 after the [[Meiji Restoration]].

===''Daigaku-no-kami''===
The title ''Daigaku-no-kami'' identifies the head of the chief educational institution of the state.  It was conferred by the shogun in 1691 when the Neo-Confucian academy moved to land provided by the shogunate at Yushima. In the years which followed, this academic title became hereditary for the ten descendants who followed in succession.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Boyd. (1999).

[https://books.google.com/books?id=6wS_ijD6DSgC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=  ''Sources of Japanese Tradition'', Vol. 2, p. 69.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of the Edo period, the ''seidō'' or Confucian "Hall of Sages" was located in Shinobugaoka; but in 1691, it was moved to a new location at the top of a hill in the Yushima section of Edo.&lt;ref name="debary443"&gt;De Bary, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6wS_ijD6DSgC&amp;pg=PA443&amp;dq=  p. 443.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The hereditary heads of the Edo ''daigaku'' are identified below.

==Institutional history after 1871==
[[File:YushimaSeido8674.jpg|thumb|140px|''Taiseiden'' tablet at reconstructed ''Yushima Seido.'']]
Since the Meiji restoration, Yushima Seidō has temporarily shared its premises with a number of different institutions, including the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|Ministry of Education]], the [[Tokyo National Museum]], and the forerunners of today’s [[Tsukuba University]] and [[Ochanomizu University]] (which is now in a different location but retains "Ochanomizu" in its name).

The site of the school is now occupied by the [[Tokyo Medical and Dental University]].

The colour scheme of the original Taiseiden is believed to have been one of [[vermilion]] paint with [[verdigris]]. After being burnt down on a number of occasions, the Taiseiden was rebuilt in 1799 in the style of the Confucian temple in [[Mito, Ibaraki|Mito]], which used black paint. This building survived through the Meiji period and was designated a national historical site in 1922, but was burnt down in the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake|Great Kantō earthquake]] of the following year. The current Taiseiden is in [[reinforced concrete]] and was designed by [[Itō Chūta]].

Inside the compound is the world's largest statue of Confucius, donated in 1975 by the [[Lions Club]] of [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]]. There are also statues of the Four Sages, [[Yan Hui (disciple of Confucius)|Yan Hui]], [[Zengzi]], [[Zisi|Kong Ji]], and [[Mencius]].

In the 1970s, the Taiseiden was used as the location for scenes in [[Nippon Television|NTV]]'s ''[[Monkey (television series)|Monkey]]'' television series.

Along with the nearby [[Yushima Tenman-gū]], the Yushima Seidō is a mecca for students praying for success in their examinations.

==Transportation==
[[Ochanomizu Station]] and [[Shin-Ochanomizu Station]] are nearby.
