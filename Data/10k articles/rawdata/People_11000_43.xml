[[Malay titles#Tan Sri|Tan Sri]] [[Malay titles#Datuk Sri|Datuk Seri Panglima]] '''Abdul Gani bin Patail''' (born 6 October 1955) is a [[Malaysian people|Malaysian]] [[prosecutor]]. He was the [[Attorney General of Malaysia]] from 2002 to 2015, the first from [[Sabah]] to hold the position (hailing from [[Lahad Datu]] and was born in [[Lahad Datu]] district).&lt;ref name="urlGani Patail, first local to hold post of AG | Sayang Sabah"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sayangsabah.com/en/gani-patail-first-local-to-hold-post-of-ag/ |title=Gani Patail, first local to hold post of AG &amp;#124; Sayang Sabah |format= |work= |accessdate=2015-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdul Gani was the lead prosecutor in former Deputy Prime Minister [[Anwar Ibrahim]]'s [[Anwar Ibrahim sodomy trials|sodomy trial]] of 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sodomy II prosecutor honoured with Federal award |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/sodomy-ii-prosecutor-honoured-with-federal-award/ |publisher=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=5 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608124621/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/sodomy-ii-prosecutor-honoured-with-federal-award |archivedate=8 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Abdul Gani Patail graduated with a [[Bachelor of Laws]] (Hons) degree from the [[University of Malaya]] in 1979. He began his legal career the following year as a Deputy Public Prosecutor (the title for a prosecuting officer in Malaysia) in [[Kota Kinabalu]], [[Sabah]]. In 1985, he was promoted to Senior Federal Counsel for Sabah.&lt;ref name="agc"&gt;[http://www.agc.gov.my/agc/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=115&amp;Itemid=166&amp;lang=en Attorney General's Profile]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Attorney General's Chambers. Accessed 13 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1994, Abdul Gani moved to the [[Attorney General's Chambers]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]]. There he was appointed Head of the Prosecution Division (1994 and again in 2000), Head of the Advisory and International Division (1995) and Commissioner of Law Revision (1997).&lt;ref name="agc"/&gt;

On 1 January 2002, he was appointed Attorney General of Malaysia.&lt;ref name="agc"/&gt;

Abdul Gani's tenure as Attorney General ended in 2015 when the [[Chief Secretary to the Government]] announced he had stepped down due to health reasons. The announcement was abrupt, and Patail himself was apparently unaware of the decision to have him removed from his post.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/gani-says-in-the-dark-over-sudden-termination&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, he was head of a multi-agency taskforce investigating claims of [[1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal|misappropriation of funds]] allegedly involving prime minister [[Najib Razak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gani Patail no longer Attorney-General, chief secretary says |url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/gani-patail-no-longer-attorney-general-chief-secretary-says/ |publisher=[[Malay Mail Online]] |date=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anwar sodomy trial==
It was during his time as Commissioner of Law Revision that Abdul Gani was chosen to lead the prosecution against [[Anwar Ibrahim]] during Anwar's [[Anwar Ibrahim sodomy trials|corruption and sodomy trial of 1998]]. Anwar was sentenced to a combined 15 years in prison for corruption and sodomy in April 1999 and August 2000 respectively. The sodomy conviction was overturned in 2004 by the [[Federal Court of Malaysia|Federal Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/cgi-bin/common/printfriendly.pl?http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2004/s1190999.htm|title=Anwar Ibrahim freed after sodomy sentence overturned|last=Colvin|first=Mark|date=2 September 2004|work=abc.net.au|accessdate=31 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203172614/http://www.abc.net.au/cgi-bin/common/printfriendly.pl?http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abc.net.au%2Fpm%2Fcontent%2F2004%2Fs1190999.htm#|archive-date=3 February 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anwar has personally accused Abdul Gani and then Assistant Commissioner of Police [[Musa Hassan]] of fabricating evidence against him during the trial, in particular introducing the medical report that suggested Anwar's black-eye sustained from beatings in prison were self-inflicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-cop implicates Abdul Gani, Musa in Anwar black-eye case |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/business/27923?task=view |publisher=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=29 May 2009 |last1=Lau |first1=Leslie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002183854/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/business/27923?task=view |archivedate=2 October 2012 }} ([http://anwaribrahimblog.com/2009/05/29/ex-cop-implicates-abdul-gani-musa-in-anwar-black-eye-case/ mirror])&lt;/ref&gt; His claims have been backed by former police officer Mat Zain Ibrahim who investigated the 'black eye' incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ex-cop: How AG interfered in 'black eye' case |url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/91024 |publisher=[[Malaysiakini]] |date=10 October 2008 |last1=Beh |first1=Lih Yi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alan Hale''' (born March 7, 1958)&lt;ref name = Dissertation&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hale|first1=Alan|title= Ph.D. Thesis: Orbital coplanarity in solar-type binary systems: implications for planetary system formation and detection|date=May 1992|url = http://libcat.nmsu.edu/vwebv/holdingsInfo?searchId=430&amp;recCount=25&amp;recPointer=4&amp;bibId=417275|publisher=University Microfilms International|location=New Mexico State University (Branson Library)|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American professional [[astronomer]], best known for his co-discovery of [[Comet Hale–Bopp]] along with amateur astronomer [[Thomas Bopp]].&lt;ref name=IAU/&gt;

Hale specializes in the study of [[Solar analog|sun-like stars]] and the search for [[Exoplanet|extra-solar planetary systems]], and has side interests in the fields of [[comet]]s and [[Near-Earth object#Near-Earth asteroids|near-Earth asteroids]]. He has been an active astronomer most of his life and currently serves as the president of the Earthrise Institute, which he founded, and which has as its mission the use of astronomy as a tool for breaking down international and intercultural barriers.

The [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) has named an asteroid in Hale's honor, [[4151 Alanhale]], in recognition of his numerous comet observations.

==Early life and career==
Hale was born in 1958 in [[Tachikawa]], Japan,&lt;ref name = Dissertation/&gt; where his father was serving in the [[United States Air Force]].&lt;ref name = FFRF&gt;{{cite web|title=Alan Hale|url=https://ffrf.org/news/day/dayitems/item/14697-alan-hale|website=FFRF.org|accessdate=12 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829012023/https://ffrf.org/news/day/dayitems/item/14697-alan-haleL|archive-date = 28 August 2017|dead-url = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four months later his father was transferred to [[Holloman Air Force Base]] outside [[Alamogordo, New Mexico|Alamogordo]], [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref name = Knoxville&gt;{{cite web|title=An Interview with Astronomer Alan Hale – CTV call-in (Knoxville Freethought Forum 4/23/13)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuAg1WA5fW0|website=Youtube.com|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hale was raised in Alamogordo where his father retired from the Air Force and worked in civil service. In 2013 Hale said, "I refuse to say that 'I grew up there' because anyone who know me knows that I really haven’t grown up yet."&lt;ref name = Knoxville/&gt;
He credits several factors for inspiring his interest in science and [[astronomy]] in the 1960s: the clear night skies in Alamogordo, library books on astronomy his father gave him in the first grade, the [[Nasa|US space program]], and the original [[Star Trek]] TV series. Hale also said that as a child he was interested in other sciences as well, and he "went through a [[dinosaur]] phase when I was in 2nd grade. I knew them all. Drove my parent nuts."&lt;ref name = Knoxville/&gt;
 
Hale graduated from Alamogordo High School in 1976, and then served in the [[United States Navy]] from 1976 to 1983.&lt;ref name = FFRF/&gt;&lt;ref name = SWISR&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography of Alan Hale|url=http://www.swisr.org/ahbio.html|website=SWISR.org|accessdate=12 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829013029/http://www.swisr.org/ahbio.html|archive-date = 28 August 2017 |dead-url = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the [[U.S. Naval Academy]] in 1980 with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[physics]].&lt;ref name = Dissertation/&gt;&lt;ref name = FFRF/&gt;
Following his Navy service he worked at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) until 1986 as an [[engineering]] contractor for [[Bendix Corporation|Allied Bendix Aerospace]]&lt;ref name = Dissertation/&gt; working on the [[Deep Space Network]] project, as well as on several [[spacecraft]] projects. During the 1986 [[Voyager 2]] fly-by of [[Uranus]], he worked with the Radio Science Experiment, using the spacecraft [[Carrier wave|carrier signal]] to deduce information about Uranus’ atmosphere and [[Rings of Uranus|rings]].&lt;ref name = Knoxville/&gt;&lt;ref name = SWISR/&gt;

Following the Uranus encounter, Hale enrolled in the [[Astronomy]] department of [[New Mexico State University]],  [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]], where he earned a [[Master's Degree]] and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1989 and 1992 respectively, both in astronomy.&lt;ref name = SWISR/&gt; His [[doctorate|doctoral]] [[Thesis|dissertation]] was published in the January 1994 issue of The [[Astronomical Journal]].&lt;ref name=AJ&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hale|first1=Alan|title= Orbital coplanarity in solar-type binary systems: implications for planetary system formation and detection|journal=The Astronomical Journal|date= December 20, 1993|volume= 107, Number 1|issue=Jan. 1994|pages=306|bibcode=1994AJ....107..306H|doi=10.1086/116855}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After earning his doctorate, Hale worked at The Space Center (now the [[New Mexico Museum of Space History]]) in Alamogordo, New Mexico, as its staff astronomer and outreach education coordinator.&lt;ref name = SWISR/&gt;&lt;ref name = B37/&gt;

==Earthrise Institute==
In 1993 Hale founded the Southwest Institute for Space Research (SWISR), which later became the Earthrise Institute, where Hale serves as president.&lt;ref name = SWISR/&gt;&lt;ref name=ERI/&gt;&lt;ref name="SpaceFest"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alan Hale – Founder and Director, Southwest Institute for Space Research|url=https://www.spacefest.info/?avada_portfolio=alan-hale-founder-and-director-southwest-institute-for-space-research|website=Spacefest|accessdate=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hale said "there is an entire generation that has come of age having never really seen the dark sky", so part of what he wanted to accomplish with Earthrise was "to create an environment where students could spend some nights out under a dark sky and see what it really looks like."&lt;ref name = FEP/&gt;

In 1999 Hale assembled a group of American scientists, students and educators to go on a 2 week+ trip to [[Iran]] (coinciding with a [[solar eclipse]]) where they gave talks throughout the country. Hale feels that "Science is a{{nbsp}}... universal language" and "it would be a great idea if we could use science as a tool to bring people together{{nbsp}}... to break down barriers between nations and between cultures." Hale uses the expression 'Science Diplomacy' in this context, which he says it's possible he coined. "The sky looks the same from Iran as it does from here in the US. It’s the same sky we study{{nbsp}}... Science does not know political boundaries."&lt;ref name = Knoxville/&gt;

This sentiment is reflected in the mission of his Earthrise Institute, which is "to use astronomy, space, and other related endeavors as a tool for breaking down international and intercultural barriers and for bringing humanity together."&lt;ref name = Knoxville/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Earthrise Mission|url=http://www.earthriseinstitute.org/mission.html|website=Earthriseinstitute.org|accessdate=17 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829022902/http://www.earthriseinstitute.org/mission.html|archive-date = 29 August 2017 |dead-url = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earthrise's inaugural educational project was announced in a press release on March 1, 2007:
{{quote|text=The Earthrise Institute is pleased to announce its inaugural educational project, entitled "Countdown to 500 Comets." The project takes its name and focus from Earthrise Institute founder and President Alan Hale's quest to observe 500 comets, a quest he began over 37 years ago. He has recently collected his 400th comet and, in his words, "I've decided to share my quest for comet number 500 with the astronomy students of the world{{nbsp}}... Students of all ages and nationalities are invited to participate in "Countdown." The goal{{nbsp}}... is for students to observe as many of Dr. Hale's next 100 comets as they are able, either by viewing them through a telescope, and/or by taking images of them with appropriately equipped telescopic cameras. Special awards will be presented to any student who successfully observes ten of Dr. Hale's next 100 comets. Hale estimates that it will take five to seven years for him to collect those 100 comets, and thus there are plenty of opportunities for participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EARTHRISE INSTITUTE ANNOUNCES INAUGURAL EDUCATIONAL PROJECT|url=http://www.earthriseinstitute.org/countdown.htm|website=Earthriseinstitute.org|accessdate=18 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829013524/http://www.earthriseinstitute.org/countdown.htm|archive-date = 28 August 2017 |dead-url = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hale remains active with the Earthrise Institute performing science outreach. For example, his "In Our Skies" column appears in the [[Alamogordo Daily News]], in which he discusses current astronomical issues.&lt;ref name = 2016Ups&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hale|first1=Alan|title=A look back at 2016’s ups and downs|url=http://www.alamogordonews.com/story/news/local/community/2017/01/07/look-back-2016s-ups-and-downs/96281772/|website=AlamogordoNews.com|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=29 May 2017| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170829013742/http://www.alamogordonews.com/story/news/local/community/2017/01/07/look-back-2016s-ups-and-downs/96281772/?from=global&amp;sessionKey=&amp;autologin=| archive-date = 28 August 2017 |dead-url = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Cygnus&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hale|first1=Alan|title=Cygnus’ swan is flying down the Milky Way in our nighttime skies|url=http://www.alamogordonews.com/story/news/local/community/2017/05/28/cygnus-swan-flying-down-milky-way-our-nighttime-skies/102248730/|website=AlamogordoNews|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery of Comet Hale–Bopp==
[[File:Comet (circled).png|thumbnail|right|Comet Hale–Bopp]]
Hale first spotted the comet that would come to bear his name from his home in [[Cloudcroft, New Mexico|Cloudcroft]], New Mexico, where the night sky is exceptionally dark. Since 1970 Hale had observed over 200 known comets, and on the night of July 22–23, 1995, after finishing his observations of periodic Comet Clark, and while waiting for periodic [[6P/d'Arrest|Comet d'Arrest]] to become visible above the horizon, he "decided to pass the time by observing some deep-sky objects in [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]]", and pointed his Meade DS-16 telescope towards [[globular cluster]] [[Messier 70|M70]]. He "immediately noticed a fuzzy object in the field" which wasn't present when he had observed that region of the sky two weeks earlier.&lt;ref name=IAU&gt;{{cite web|title=IAUC 6187: 1995 O1| url=http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/iauc/06100/06187.html|website=cbat.eps.harvard.edu|publisher=IAU Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams|accessdate=16 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807005650/http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/iauc/06100/06187.html|archive-date = 7 August 2017 |dead-url = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = FEP&gt;{{cite web|title=Comet Hale–Bopp|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5qyDryAF0&amp;t=51|via=Youtube.com|publisher=Foolish Earthling Productions| accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After consulting his astronomical sources, and determining that the comet was likely unknown, Hale says: 
{{quote|text=I sent an email to Brian Marsden and Dan Green at the [[Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams|Central Bureau]]{{nbsp}}... informing them of a possible comet; later, when I had verified that the object had moved against the background stars, I sent them an additional email. I continued to follow the comet for a total of about 3 hours, until it set behind trees in the southwest, and then was able to email a detailed report, complete with two positions.&lt;ref name=Discovery/&gt;}}

Unknown to Hale, that night [[Thomas Bopp]] was observing the same region of the sky with friends near [[Stanfield, Arizona]]. At around 11:00 pm, Bopp was observing M70 through his telescope and "noticed a fainter, fuzzy object coming into the field". Bopp and his friends followed the object for the next hour, and after seeing it move relative to the background stars, concluded that they had been viewing a comet. Bopp then drove back to his home in Glendale, and sent a telegram to the Central Bureau informing them of the comet.&lt;ref name=Discovery/&gt;

[[File:Cal Pons Torre Nova - Hale Boop.jpg|thumbnail|left|Comet Hale–Bopp]]
On July 23, the [[IAU]] issued Circular 6187&lt;ref name=IAU/&gt; to announce the joint discovery of the new comet.&lt;ref name=Discovery/&gt; Per Hale, calculations indicate that Hale–Bopp likely last appeared on the order of 4000 years ago, but any record of this previous encounter had not yet been positively identified from ancient records.&lt;ref name = Knoxville/&gt; It has also been determined that Hale–Bopp will not return to the inner solar system until approximately 4385.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vitagliano |first1=Aldo |title=Solex 10 estimate for Next Perihelion of C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp) |url=http://home.surewest.net/kheider/astro/Hale-Bopp4385.txt |website=web.archive.org |publisher=Chemistry.unina.it |accessdate=17 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810085857/http://home.surewest.net/kheider/astro/Hale-Bopp4385.txt |archivedate=August 10, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = space.com&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howell|first1=Elizabeth|title=Hale–Bopp Comet Facts|url=http://www.space.com/19931-hale-bopp.html|website=Space.com|accessdate=17 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829020600/https://www.space.com/19931-hale-bopp.html|archive-date = 29 August 2017 |dead-url = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Comet Hale–Bopp]], originally labeled C/1995 O1, and sometimes called "the Great Comet of 1997", became one of the most-viewed comets in human history, and the brightest comet seen since [[Comet West]] in 1976, appearing 1000 times brighter than [[Halley's Comet|Comet Halley]] did at the same distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comet Hale–Bopp, The Great Comet of 1997| first = Ron | last = Baalke | work = [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] | location = [[California Institute of Technology]] |url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/comet/index.html|accessdate=20 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829020410/https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/comet/|

When the comet was at the peak of its brightness, Hale says he was giving talks about the comet in big cities with [[Light pollution|light-polluted]] night skies, so he did not get a chance "to see it all that much when it was really bright."&lt;ref name = FEP/&gt;

Regarding the [[News conference|press conference]] of the comet’s discovery, Hale praised the reporting done by “the very first reporter that broke the story of the comet’s discovery,” the [[Albuquerque Journal|Albuquerque Journal’s]] science reporter John Fleck:{{quote|text=John spoiled me. The rest of the media{{nbsp}}... were mostly not like him. I would go round and round the same things over and over and over again and they would still get it wrong.&lt;ref name = Knoxville/&gt;}}

As an example of the media getting it wrong, Hale told this story:
{{quote|text=Due to frustration with the reporter interviewing him for [[USA Today]] when they asked him about a supposed [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] following the comet, Hale made a joke that he would meet the aliens when they land at [[Roswell, New Mexico|Roswell]] and confront them for following “his” comet. Hale stated that the resulting article reported in seriousness that “Hale said he will go to Roswell to meet the spacecraft when it lands." And that line was the only thing they reported of what he said in the entire 45-minute interview.&lt;ref name = Knoxville/&gt;}}

==Heaven's Gate reaction==
{{main|Heaven's Gate (religious group)}}
[[File:Halebopp031197.jpg|thumbnail|right|Comet Hale–Bopp taken from [[Davis, West Virginia]], US on March 11, 1997]]
Historically linked to the discovery and first recorded appearance of Hale–Bopp is [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate]]. This was a [[cult|religious cult]] in [[San Diego]], California led by [[Marshall Applewhite]] who preached that an alien spacecraft was following Comet Hale–Bopp. The cult members believed that transporting their [[souls]] to the spacecraft and evacuating the Earth – which was soon to be "recycled" – would permit them to achieve salvation. Applewhite and 38 followers [[poison]]ed themselves over three days in March 1997 in the belief this would allow them to pass through "Heaven's Gate" and achieve "the Evolutionary Level Above Human."&lt;ref name = space.com/&gt;&lt;ref name = HG&gt;{{cite web|title=Hale–Bopp Brings Closure to Heaven's Gate| url=http://www.heavensgate.com/|website=Heavensgate.com|accessdate=17 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829020201/http://www.heavensgate.com/|archive-date = 29 August 2017 |dead-url = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale for taking their lives was (and is, as of this writing) clearly detailed on the group's website which is maintained by surviving cult members.

When news broke of the Heaven's Gate mass [[suicide]]s and their relation to Comet Hale–Bopp, Hale's phone "never stopped ringing the entire day." Hale did not respond until the next day, when he spoke at a press conference on the subject, only after he had researched details of the incident.&lt;ref name = Knoxville/&gt;

At the 20th annual convention of the [[Freedom From Religion Foundation]] (FFRF) in [[Tampa, Florida]], in 1997 Hale was a featured speaker and discussed the suicides, calling their death pact and other religion-fostered violence "another victory for ignorance and superstition."&lt;ref name = FFRF/&gt;

Speaking at the Second World Skeptics Congress in [[Heidelberg, Germany]] on July 24, 1998:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Second World Skeptics Congress (Schedule)|url=http://amber.zine.cz/AZOld/occam/congress.htm|website=amber.zine.cz|accessdate=18 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829015927/http://amber.zine.cz/AZOld/occam/congress.htm|archive-date = 29 August 2017 |dead-url = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=Dr. Hale discussed the scientific significance and popular lore of comets and gave a personal account of his discovery. He then lambasted the combination of scientific illiteracy, willful delusions, a radio talk-show's deception about an imaginary spacecraft following the comet, and a cult's bizarre yearnings for ascending to another level of existence that led to the Heaven's Gate mass suicides.&lt;ref name = SI&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frazier|first1=Kendrick|authorlink=Kendrick Frazier|title=Science and Reason, Foibles and Fallacies, and Doomsdays|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|date=1998|volume=22|issue=6|page=6|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/science_and_reason_foibles_and_fallacies_and_doomsdays|accessdate=18 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829015629/http://www.csicop.org/si/show/science_and_reason_foibles_and_fallacies_and_doomsdays|archive-date = 29 August 2017 |dead-url = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hale said that, well before Heaven's Gate, he had told a colleague:
{{quote|text='We are probably going to have some suicides as a result of this comet.' The sad part is that I was really not surprised. Comets are lovely objects, but they don't have apocalyptic significance. We must use our minds, our reason.&lt;ref name = SI/&gt;}}

==Selected appearances==
Following his discovery of Comet Hale–Bopp, Hale was in demand to speak about the comet bearing his name,&lt;ref name = FEP/&gt; and this gave him a platform to discuss Hale-Bopp as well as general astronomy and science. A small sample of his lectures, interviews, and other appearances is as follows:

*Hale was a guest speaker at the February 16, 1996, meeting of [[New Mexicans for Science and Reason]] (NMSR) which according to member and [[New Mexicans for Science and Reason#Science Watch podcast|Science Watch]] host [[Dave Thomas (skeptic)|Dave Thomas]] "was one of our most memorable and well-attended ever." Hale spoke on "Comet Hale–Bopp: Potentials and Opportunities" and cautioned against complacency about asteroid/comet impacts on the Earth. Saying that:
{{quote|text=Although Hale–Bopp will miss Earth by more than 1 [[Astronomical unit|AU]], the newly-discovered [[Comet Hyakutake]] will come within 0.102 AU of our planet. Hyakutake's near-miss of Earth will occur in late March of this year; it was discovered in late January. That's not very much advance warning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Dave|authorlink = Dave Thomas (skeptic)| title=Feb. ‘96 Meeting – Dr. Alan Hale|url=http://www.nmsr.org/MAR96.pdf|website=NMSR.org|accessdate=17 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807005306/http://www.nmsr.org/MAR96.pdf|archive-date = 7 August 2017 |dead-url = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

*On February 26, 1997, Hale was the guest speaker for two public lectures sponsored by the Center for Particle Astrophysics at [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free Public Lecture on  "Comet Hale–Bopp, the Public and the Future"|url=http://cfpa.berkeley.edu/news_items/alan_hale.html|website=cfpa.berkeley.edu|accessdate=20 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807005136/http://cfpa.berkeley.edu/news_items/alan_hale.html|archive-date = 7 August 2017 |dead-url = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Hale has been a periodic guest on ''[[The Space Show]]'', an Internet radio talk show centering on space commerce and exploration, which is also available as a [[podcast]].&lt;ref name="SpaceShow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thespaceshow.com/search-page?keys=alan+hale|title= Alan Hale's appearances|website=The Space Show|accessdate=15 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807004916/http://thespaceshow.com/search-page?keys=alan+hale|archive-date = 7 August 2017 |dead-url = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the March 19, 2002 broadcast, Hale spoke of the importance of the search for [[Near-Earth object#Near-Earth asteroids|Near Earth Asteroids]] (NEAs) and their danger to civilization:
{{quote|text=Even though a major catastrophic event would be very unlikely to occur during our lifetime, if it were to occur it would wipe out a significant fraction of the [[World population|Earth's population]]{{nbsp}}... The chances that there will actually be a major catastrophic world-wide event during our lifetime are actually very slim, but they are NOT zero. If we know where (the NEAs) are we can project their motions out decades into the future. At least then if there is something heading our way we'll have enough lead time – decades perhaps – in order to figure out what we might want to do about it. For objects a hundred meters in diameter we are talking (just) centuries. One such small object exploded over the [[Siberia]] wilderness in 1908 (the [[Tunguska event]]) and created blast effects similar to a [[nuclear explosion]]{{nbsp}}...

*From 2004 to 2006 Hale was host of a weekly radio program, "The Other Side of the Sky" (the precursor to Earthrise Radio).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Other Side of the Sky|url=http://www.swisr.org/otherside.html|website=swisr.org|accessdate=18 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807004539/http://www.swisr.org/otherside.html|archive-date = 7 August 2017 |dead-url = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On March 11, 2006, Hale was interviewed on the [[New Mexicans for Science and Reason|NMSR's]] ''[[New Mexicans for Science and Reason#Science Watch podcast|Science Watch]]'' radio show in an episode called "An Hour-long visit with Dr. Alan Hale, co-discoverer of the Hale–Bopp Comet!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Past Shows|url=http://www.nmsr.org/goradio.htm#pastshows|website=NMSR.org|accessdate=16 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807004359/http://www.nmsr.org/goradio.htm|archive-date = 7 August 2017 |dead-url = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific skepticism advocacy==
As a [[Scientific skepticism|scientific skeptic]], Hale is a periodic contributor to ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' magazine. One such article, titled "An Astronomer’s Personal Statement on UFOs", appeared in the March/April 1997 edition. In the article Hale stated:
{{quote|text=When I am confronted with beliefs about [[Unidentified flying object|UFOs]] or other [[paranormal|paranormal phenomena]] — or, for that matter, just about anything — I am guided by three basic principles, to wit:
:'''1.''' [[Marcello Truzzi#"Extraordinary claims"|Extraordinary claims]] require extraordinary [[evidence]]. 
:'''2.''' The [[Philosophic burden of proof|burden of proof]] is on the positive. (If you are making an extraordinary claim, the burden is on you to produce the extraordinary evidence to prove that you are correct; the burden is not on me to prove that you are wrong.)
:'''3.''' [[Occam’s Razor]]: If one is confronted with a series of [[Phenomenon|phenomena]] for which there exists more than one viable explanation, one should choose the simplest explanation which fits all the observed facts.}}

After an analysis of the claims of [[Ufology|extraterrestrial visitation]] with regards to these three principles, Hale concluded: 
{{blockquote|In summary, I consider it likely that there are [[Extraterrestrial life|advanced alien races]] somewhere "out there," and I remain open to the possibility that, unlikely as it may seem, one or more such races could be visiting Earth. But if so, where are they? If they possess the [[technology]] capable of [[Interstellar travel|traveling interstellar distances]], then they are so far ahead of us that there can be no reason for them to be afraid of us. If they wish to hide from us, they could do so easily; if they don't wish to, then they have no need to play games with us and only show themselves to a few unwitting individuals. Let them reveal themselves to humanity at large, to our scientists, and to me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Astronomer’s Personal Statement on UFOs (Skeptical Inquirer Volume 21.2, March / April 1997)|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/astronomerrsquos_personal_statement_on_ufos|website=csicop.org|accessdate=19 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807004116/http://www.csicop.org/si/show/astronomerrsquos_personal_statement_on_ufos|archive-date = 7 August 2017 |dead-url = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Atheist activism==
Hale is an [[atheist]] and member of the honorary board of the online group [[Internet Infidels]] which has the mission of using the Internet to promote a view that [[supernatural]] forces or entities do not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Internet Infidels Honorary Board|url=http://www.infidels.org/infidels/honorary.html|accessdate=15 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807003919/https://infidels.org/infidels/honorary.html|archive-date = 7 August 2017 |dead-url = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hale has made his position on [[religion]] clear:
{{quote|text=I'm quite biased against invoking mysterious [[Mythology|mythical]] beings that other people want to claim exist but which they can offer no evidence for. By telling students that the beliefs of a [[superstition|superstitious]] tribe thousands of years ago should be treated on an equal basis with the evidence collected with our most advanced equipment today is to completely undermine the entire process of [[Models of scientific inquiry|scientific inquiry]].&lt;ref name = FFRF/&gt;}}

==Awards and honors==
In 1980 Alan Hale was awarded the [[Navy League of the United States]] prize in [[Applied Physics]].&lt;ref name = Dissertation/&gt;

In 1991, years prior to his discovery of Hale–Bopp,&lt;ref name = Dissertation/&gt; the IAU named an asteroid, [[4151 Alanhale]], in Hale's honor in recognition of his numerous comet observations, stating that:
{{quote|text=In the past several years he has published careful visual observations of more than 130 comets, several at more than one apparition. His observations include both magnitude estimates and confirmations of discoveries. He has also applied his magnitude estimating skill to asteroids, particularly the fast-moving objects 1989 AC and 1989 VA, and has participated in [[Occultation#Occultations by asteroids|asteroid occultation]] teams. He has done much to promote asteroid-comet education through articles on comets and emphasis on asteroids in his introductory astronomy classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=(4151) Alanhale|url=http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/db_search/show_object?object_id=4151|website=IAU Minor Planet Center|accessdate=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Alastair-sim-laird-in-geordie.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Sim as the Laird in ''[[Geordie (film)|Geordie]]'', 1955]]
The Scottish actor [[Alastair Sim]] (1900–1976) performed in many mediums of [[light entertainment]], including theatre, film and television.&lt;ref name="Times: Obit" /&gt; His career spanned from 1930 until his death. During that time he was a "memorable character player of faded Anglo-Scottish gentility, whimsically put-upon countenance, and sepulchral, sometimes minatory, laugh".&lt;ref name="BFI: Screenonline" /&gt;

After studying chemistry at the [[University of Edinburgh]], he was employed, between 1925 and 1930, as a lecturer in elocution at [[New College, Edinburgh]], and also established his own school of drama and speech training.{{sfn|Gilbert|2010}} In 1930 he made his professional stage debut as a messenger in ''[[Othello]]'' at the [[Savoy Theatre]], London{{sfn|Simpson|2009|p=38}}—with [[Paul Robeson]] and [[Peggy Ashcroft]] in the lead roles.{{sfn|Gilbert|2010}} During the next five years he appeared on stage in New York and the UK, and spent two years at the [[Old Vic]].{{sfn|Herbert|1978|p=1128}}

In 1935 he made his film debut, appearing in ''[[The Riverside Murder]]'' (dir. [[Albert Parker (director)|Albert Parker]]); he appeared in four films that year, and five the following.{{sfn|Simpson|2009|pp=193–197}} His film career progressed and by the mid 1940s he was a well-known figure in the theatre and cinema.&lt;ref name="BFI: Screenonline" /&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' highlighted some of his more notable films, including ''[[Green for Danger (film)|Green for Danger]]'' (1946), ''[[The Happiest Days of Your Life]]'' (1950), ''[[Scrooge (1951 film)|Scrooge]]'' (1951), ''[[An Inspector Calls (1954 film)|An Inspector Calls]]'' (1954), ''[[The Green Man (film)|The Green Man]]'' (1956) and ''[[School for Scoundrels (1960 film)|School for Scoundrels]]'' (1960).&lt;ref name="Times: Obit" /&gt;

Sim had been [[Rector of the University of Edinburgh]] in 1951, and was awarded [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in 1953, although he turned down a [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]] that was offered to him by [[Edward Heath]].{{sfn|Gilbert|2010}} His biographer, Bruce Babington, considered that "Sim was the paradigm&amp;nbsp;– authority figure, yes, but often shadily duplicitous, often a manipulator of official rhetoric, his sexless bachelor persona containing strains of sexual ambiguity, his jolliness a latent vampirism."&lt;ref name="BFI: Screenonline" /&gt; Sim died in August 1976.{{sfn|Gilbert|2010}}

'''Alexander John Forsyth''' (28 December 1769 – 11 June 1843) was a Scottish [[Presbyterian]] clergyman who invented the [[percussion ignition]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottish-places.info/people/famousfirst143.html Overview of Rev. Alexander John Forsyth, The Gazetteer for Scotland (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gunsmiths like [[Joseph Manton]] invented more reliable forms of [[Lock (firearm)|ignition]], like the tube lock in 1814. The artist [[Joshua Shaw]] designed what is recognized today as the [[percussion cap]],{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} which he patented in the United States in 1822, since Forsyth had threatened his [[Competition (economics)|rivals]] in Britain with [[legal action]]. These new forms of ignition proved popular among [[hunter]]s during the [[Regency period]], who had their old reliable [[flintlock]]s converted.&lt;ref name = Ricketts&gt;Ricketts, H., ''Firearms'' (London, 1962)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

He was educated at [[King's College, Aberdeen]], and succeeded his father as [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] of [[Belhelvie]] in 1791.&lt;ref&gt;Myatt, F, ''19th Century Firearms'' (London, 1989) p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

While hunting [[Mallard|wild duck]], he was dissatisfied with his [[flintlock]] [[fowling-piece]] due to its long lock time (the delay between the time the trigger is pulled and the time the main charge of gunpowder begins burning); by the time the pellets actually left the barrel, the target animal could hear the noise from the trigger being pulled and have time to either fly, dive, or run before the [[Lead shot|shot]] reached it.&lt;ref name = Ricketts/&gt; He patented his scent-bottle lock in 1807; this was a small container filled with [[fulminate of mercury]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/214047/Alexander-John-Forsyth Alexander Forsyth in ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Napoleonic Wars]] Forsyth worked on his design at the [[Royal Armouries|Tower Armouries]]. But when a new [[Master General of Ordnance]] was appointed he was dismissed; other experiments had had destructive results and the new master general did not wish to see Britain's main [[arsenal]] destroyed.

[[Napoleon Bonaparte]] offered Forsyth a reward of £20,000 if he took his [[invention]] to France, but Forsyth declined. The French [[gunsmith]] [[Jean Lepage]] developed a similar form of ignition in 1807 based on Forsyth's design, but this was not pursued.

He began his acting career portraying [[Michael Kelso]] in the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] sitcom ''[[That '70s Show]]'' (1998–2006). He made his film debut in the romantic comedy ''[[Coming Soon (1999 film)|Coming Soon]]'' (1999) and became known by audiences in the comedy film ''[[Dude, Where's My Car?]]'' (2000), which was a box office hit. In 2003, Kutcher moved into romantic comedies, appearing in that year's ''[[Just Married]]'' and ''[[My Boss's Daughter]]''. In 2003, he created and produced the television series ''[[Punk'd]]'', also serving as host for the first eight of its ten seasons. In 2004, Kutcher starred in the lead role of the psychological film  ''[[The Butterfly Effect]]''.

Kutcher subsequently appeared in more romantic comedies, including ''[[Guess Who (film)|Guess Who]]'' (2005), ''[[A Lot Like Love]]'' (2005), ''[[What Happens in Vegas]]'' (2008), and ''[[No Strings Attached (film)|No Strings Attached]]'' (2011).

Since 2016, he has starred as Colt Bennett in the [[Netflix]] series ''[[The Ranch (TV series)|The Ranch]]''.

Beyond entertainment, Kutcher is also a [[venture capitalist]]. He is a co-founder of the venture capital firm [[A-Grade Investments]]. At [[SXSW]] on March 14, 2015, Kutcher announced Sound Ventures, the successor to A-Grade Investments managing a fund backed by institutional funding. Kutcher has also successfully invested in several high technology startups. Kutcher has investments in over 60 companies, the most prominent of which include [[Skype]], [[Foursquare]], [[Airbnb]], [[Path (social network)|Path]] and [[Fab.com]]. Kutcher has invested in five startups as of August 2017 - [[Neighborly]], Zenreach, [[ResearchGate]], Kopari Beauty, and [[Lemonade (insurance)|Lemonade]], marking his foray into the "insurtech" sector.

==Early life==
Kutcher was born in [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]], to Diane (''née'' Finnegan), a [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] employee, and Larry M. Kutcher, a factory worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/49/Ashton-Kutcher.html|title=Ashton Kutcher Biography|publisher=Filmreference.com|accessdate=October 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wire"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-18727013_ITM|title=Interview With Ashton Kutcher&amp;nbsp;— Part 2|publisher=America's Intelligence Wire|date=September 6, 2006|accessdate=October 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has Czech, German, and Irish ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Stated on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', August 12, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lobdellkrotzgenealogy.com/pedigree.php?personID=I92403&amp;tree=lobdellnovy |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120905010156/http://www.lobdellkrotzgenealogy.com/pedigree.php?personID=I92403&amp;tree=lobdellnovy|dead-url=yes|archive-date=September 5, 2012|title=Pedigree Chart for Diane Finnegan|publisher=Lobdellkrotzgenealogy.com|date=May 28, 2010|accessdate=June 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kutcher was raised in a "relatively conservative" [[Catholic]] family.&lt;ref&gt;"Living The Dream&amp;nbsp;– The Making of Spread" (Commentary with Ashton Kutcher saying; ''"I'm from the Mid West. I'm from a Catholic family, from a relatively conservative environment."''), ''Spread on DVD'', [[Katalyst Films]], 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He has an older sister named Tausha and a [[fraternal twin]] brother named Michael, who had a [[heart transplant]] when the brothers were young children. Michael also has [[cerebral palsy]] and is a spokesperson for the advocacy organization Reaching for the Stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brannigan|first=Joseph|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/blogs/yahoo-tv/surprise-ashton-kutcher-twin-brother-190421177.html|title=Surprise!

&lt;!--Kutcher stated that, when he was 13, he contemplated committing [[suicide]] to save his brother's life with a heart transplant; when he told his father he was considering jumping from a Cedar Rapids hospital balcony, his father dissuaded him from doing so shortly before doctors announced that a transplant had become available from an accident victim in another state.&lt;ref name="hollywood"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hollywood.com|work=Profile: Ashton Kutcher Contemplate|url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/detail/article/2439108|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050414182642/http://www.hollywood.com/news/detail/article/2439108|archivedate=April 14, 2005|accessdate=October 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Kutcher attended [[Washington High School (Cedar Rapids, Iowa)|Washington High School]] in Cedar Rapids for his freshman year, before his family moved to [[Homestead, Iowa]], where he attended [[Clear Creek Amana School District|Clear Creek Amana High School]]. During high school, he developed a passion for acting and appeared in school plays. His home life worsened when his parents divorced when he was 16. During his senior year, he broke into his high school at midnight with his cousin in an attempt to steal money; he was arrested leaving the scene. Kutcher was convicted of third-degree [[burglary]] and sentenced to three years of [[probation]] and 180 hours of [[community service]].

He appeared in the 2003 family film ''[[Cheaper By The Dozen (2003 film)|Cheaper By The Dozen]]'' as a self-obsessed actor. In the 2004 drama film ''[[The Butterfly Effect]]'', Kutcher played a conflicted young man who time travels. The film received mixed to negative reviews, but was a box office success.&lt;ref name="azcentral"&gt;{{cite web|last=Frey|first=Jennifer|url=http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061003/NEWS/610030305/1021/RSS06&amp;source=RSS|title=Ashton Kutcher: More than meets the eye?|publisher=Theledger.com|date=October 3, 2006|accessdate=August 18, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201165541/http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20061003%2FNEWS%2F610030305%2F1021%2FRSS06&amp;source=RSS|archivedate=February 1, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"If anything, I'm a trier," says Kutcher between puffs of filtered Lucky Strikes. "I think, more than anything, it comes from the fact that my father always had several irons in the fire. Also, I don't want to fail. If something doesn't work out—if ''That '70s Show'' got canceled or if I wasn't going to have a film career—I always wanted to have backup contingency plans. So I just started doing other things; and on a half-hour sitcom, you're really only working for 30 hours a week. It allows a lot of time for sitting around, which I always kind of filled with work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Strauss |first=  Bob |title= Dramatic Ashton&amp;nbsp;– Comedic Kutcher Gets Serious in ''The Butterfly Effect'' |work= [[Los Angeles Daily News]] |date= January 23, 2004 |url= |page= U6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On September 17, 2008, Kutcher was named the assistant coach for the freshman football team at [[Harvard-Westlake School]] in Los Angeles. However, he was unable to return in 2009 because he was filming ''[[Spread (film)|Spread]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2008/sep/13/sports/spw-kutcher13 ''L.A.

In February 2011, Kutcher sold his [[Hollywood Hills]] home, which he originally bought in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zillow.com/blog/2011-02-03/exclusive-ashton-kutcher-lists-his-bachelor-era-home-for-2-6-million/ |title=Ashton Kutcher Lists His Bachelor-Era Home for $2.6 Million |publisher=Zillow.com |date=February 3, 2011 |accessdate=August 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kutcher, a Roman Catholic, has visited Israel and studied the [[Kabbalah]].&lt;ref name=Israel&gt;{{cite web|last=Ahren |first=Raphael |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-trip-on-tap-for-ashton-kutcher |title=Ashton goes to Israel |publisher=Timesofisrael.com |date=May 7, 2013 |accessdate=August 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[No Strings Attached (film)|No Strings Attached]]'' co-star, [[Natalie Portman]], stated in 2011 that Kutcher "has taught me more about Judaism than I think I have ever learned from anyone else".&lt;ref name=yadasu&gt;{{Cite news|last=Mandell|first=Andrea|title={{-'}}No Strings Attached' binds Portman and Ashton|work=USA Today |date=January 18, 2011|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2011-01-18-kutcherportman18_cv_N.htm|accessdate=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On trips to Israel, Kutcher visited Kabbalah centers in [[Tel Aviv]] and in [[Tsfat]].&lt;ref name=Israel/&gt; In 2013, Kutcher remarked, "Israel is near and dear to my heart ... coming to Israel is sort of coming back to the source of creation&amp;nbsp;– trying to get closer to that. And as a creative person, going to the source of creation is really inspiring. And this place has been really inspiring for me&amp;nbsp;– not only on a spiritual level, but also on an artistic and creative level."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brinn |first=David |url=http://www.jpost.com/Arts-and-Culture/Entertainment/Ashton-Israel-is-close-to-my-heart-313091 |title=Ashton says Israel is close to my heart |publisher=Jpost.com |date=May 14, 2013 |accessdate=August 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, Kutcher became the 500th paying customer to sign up to ride [[Virgin Galactic]]'s [[SpaceShipTwo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moskowitz|first=Clara |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/46795703/ns/technology_and_science-space/t/ashton-kutcher-buys-th-ticket-virgin-galactic-spaceship-ride|title=Ashton Kutcher Buys 500th Ticket for Virgin Galactic Spaceship Ride|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social media presence===
On April 16, 2009, Kutcher became the first Twitter user to reach more than 1 million followers,&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/apr/21/ashton-kutcher-celebrity-twitter|title=Inside Ashton Kutcher's world of Twitter|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=April 21, 2009|accessdate=April 22, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423052639/http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/apr/21/ashton-kutcher-celebrity-twitter|archivedate=April 23, 2009|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; beating [[CNN]] in the site's "Million followers contest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=  John D.|last=Sutter|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/04/15/ashton.cnn.twitter.battle|title=Ashton Kutcher challenges CNN to Twitter popularity contest|publisher=CNN|date= April 15, 2009|accessdate=September 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1609461/20090417/story.jhtml|title=Ashton Kutcher Beats CNN In Twitter-Off|publisher=MTV|date=April 17, 2009|accessdate=September 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been several reports that Twitter manipulated the contest's results by preventing users from "unfollowing" Kutcher or CNN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Needleman|first=Rafe|url=http://news.cnet.com/how-to-unfollow-ashton-kutcher|title=How to unfollow Ashton Kutcher|publisher=[[CNET]]|accessdate=September 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, Kutcher received heavy criticism for his tweet in response to the [[Jerry Sandusky child sexual abuse scandal]], calling the firing of Penn State football coach [[Joe Paterno]] "in poor taste".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20544258,00.html|title=Ashton Kutcher Sorry for His Ignorance in Defending Joe Paterno|author=Nudd, Tim|work=People|date=November 10, 2011|accessdate=June 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kutcher subsequently turned over management of his Twitter account to his team at the Katalyst Media company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Shira, Dahvi|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20544312,00.html|title=Ashton Kutcher Giving Up Management of His Twitter Feed|work=People|date=November 10, 2011|accessdate=June 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 8, 2015, Kutcher sparked a national debate regarding the lack of equal access to diaper changing facilities in men's restrooms with this [[Facebook]] post: "There are NEVER diaper changing stations in mens [''sic''] public restrooms. The first public men's room that I go into that has one gets a free shout out on my FB page!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2015/03/11/living/feat-ashton-kutcher-changing-table/index.html | title = Ashton Kutcher says dads diaper, too! | publisher = CNN | accessdate= September 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kutcher has leveraged his social media presence, particularly on Facebook, to post and promote content published by [[A Plus (aplus.com)|A Plus]], a social media-driven content platform and associated company of which he is the chairman.&lt;ref name=bi_price/&gt;

In April 2011, Kutcher and then-wife [[Demi Moore]] began a [[public service announcement]] campaign to end [[child sex trafficking]].&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-04-14/world/kutcher.moore.piers.morgan_1_human-trafficking-child-prostitution-end-child?|title=Moore, Kutcher: Join our crusade to end child sex trafficking|work=CNN|date=April 14, 2011|dead-url=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520022910/http://articles.cnn.com/2011-04-14/world/kutcher.moore.piers.morgan_1_human-trafficking-child-prostitution-end-child?|archivedate=2011-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kutcher claimed that 100,000 to 300,000 American children were sold into sexual slavery. The number was criticized by newspaper ''[[The Village Voice]]''. Kutcher and others including the ''New York Times'', [[CSPAN]], and CNN used a peer-reviewed study referring to minors at risk for sexual exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sp2.upenn.edu/~restes/CSEC_Files/Exec_Sum_020220.pdf|title=SP2.upenn.edu|format=PDF|accessdate=2014-03-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002000344/http://www.sp2.upenn.edu/~restes/CSEC_Files/Exec_Sum_020220.pdf|archivedate=October 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Village Voice'', from their research, said it was only hundreds of children.&lt;ref name="Village Voice"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2011-06-29/news/real-men-get-their-facts-straight-sex-trafficking-ashton-kutcher-demi-moore|title=Real Men Get Their Facts Straight|work=The Village Voice|location=New York|date=April 14, 2011|accessdate=July 15, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701215931/http://www.villagevoice.com/2011-06-29/news/real-men-get-their-facts-straight-sex-trafficking-ashton-kutcher-demi-moore|archivedate=July 1, 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kutcher claimed the criticism by the ''Village Voice'' promoted child prostitution and used Twitter to request that ''Village Voice'' advertisers withdraw their advertising from publications owned by its parent company.&lt;ref name="Gawker"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gawker.com/5817554/ashton-kutcher-will-destroy-newspaper-over-sex-slavery-article|title=Ashton Kutcher Will Destroy Newspaper Over Sex Slavery Article|work=Gawker|date=July 1, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703075138/http://gawker.com/5817554/ashton-kutcher-will-destroy-newspaper-over-sex-slavery-article|archivedate=2011-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BoingBoing"&gt;{{cite web|author=Xeni Jardin|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2011/07/01/ashton-kutcher-bulli.html|title=Ashton Kutcher bullies Village Voice over sex slavery hype-debunking cover story|publisher=Boing Boing|date=July 1, 2011|accessdate=August 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- RESULTS?? --&gt;

'''Charles Bruce Chatwin''' (13 May 1940{{spaced ndash}}18 January 1989) was an English travel writer,  novelist, and journalist. His first book, ''[[In Patagonia]]'' (1977), established Chatwin as a travel writer, although he considered himself instead a storyteller, interested in bringing to light unusual tales. He won the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for his novel ''[[On the Black Hill]]'' (1982), while his novel ''[[Utz (novel)|Utz]]'' (1988) was [[shortlisted]] for the [[Man Booker Prize]]. In 2008 ''[[The Times]]'' named Chatwin number 46 on their list of "50 Greatest British Writers Since 1945."

Chatwin was born in [[Sheffield]], England. After completing his secondary education at [[Marlborough College]],&lt;ref&gt;The Chatwin Colloquium [http://www.marlboroughcollege.org/news/speakers/article/date/2014/02/the-chatwin-colloquium/ Retrieved 9 February 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; he went to work at the age of 18 at [[Sotheby's]] in [[London]], where he gained an extensive knowledge of art and eventually ran the auction house’s [[Antiquities]] and [[Impressionism|Impressionist Art]] departments. In 1966 he left Sotheby’s to read [[archaeology]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]], but he abandoned his studies after two years to pursue a career as a writer.

''[[The Sunday Times Magazine]]'' hired Chatwin in 1972. He travelled the world for work and interviewed figures such as the politicians [[Indira Gandhi]] and [[André Malraux]]. He left the magazine in 1974 to visit [[Patagonia]], which resulted in his first book. He produced five other books, including ''[[The Songlines]]'' (1987), about Australia, which was a bestseller. His work is credited with reviving the genre of travel writing, and his works influenced other writers such as [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]], [[Claudio Magris]], [[Philip Marsden]], [[Luis Sepúlveda]], and [[Rory Stewart]].

Married and [[bisexual]], Chatwin was one of the first prominent men in Great Britain known to have contracted [[HIV]] and to have died of an [[AIDS]]-related illness, although he hid the details.&lt;ref&gt;[https://deadorkicking.com/bruce-chatwin-dead-or-alive/ Bruce Chatwin death]&lt;/ref&gt; Following his death, some members of the gay community criticised Chatwin for keeping his diagnosis secret.

==Life==
===Early years===
Bruce Chatwin was born on 13 May 1940 in the Shearwood Road Nursing Home in [[Sheffield]], England, to Margharita (''née'' Turnell) and Charles Chatwin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Margharita, had grown up in Sheffield and worked for the local [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] party prior to her marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Charles, was a lawyer from [[Birmingham]] who joined the [[Royal Naval Reserve]] following the outbreak of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chatwin's early years were spent moving regularly with his mother while his father was at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|first1=Elizabeth|title=Under the Sun|date=2010|publisher=Jonathan Cape|location=London|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his birth, Chatwin's parents had lived at [[Barnt Green]], [[Worcestershire]], but Margharita moved to her parents' house in [[Dronfield]], near Sheffield, shortly before giving birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mother and son remained there for only a few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worried about [[The Blitz|Nazi bombs]], Margharita sought a safer place to stay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|title=Under the Sun|first1=Elizabeth|date=2010|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; She took her son with her as they travelled to stay with various relatives during the war. They would remain in one place until Margharita decided to move, either because of concern for their safety, or because of friction among family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shakespeare|1999|p=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in life Chatwin recalled of the war, "Home, if we had one, was a solid black suitcase called the Rev-Robe, in which there was a corner for my clothes and my [[Mickey Mouse]] gas mask."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|first1=Bruce|title=The Songlines|date=1987|publisher=Jonathan Cape|location=London|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war Chatwin and his mother stayed at the home of his paternal grandparents, who had a [[curiosity cabinet]] that fascinated him. Among the items it contained was a "piece of [[brontosaurus]]" (actually a [[mylodon]], a [[giant sloth]]), which had been sent to Chatwin's grandmother by her cousin Charles Milward. Travelling in [[Patagonia]], Milward had discovered the remains of a giant sloth, which he later sold to the [[British Museum]]. He sent his cousin a piece of the animal's skin, and members of the family mistakenly referred to it as a "piece of brontosaurus". The skin was later lost but it inspired Chatwin decades later to visit and write about Patagonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|first1=Bruce|title=In Patagonia|date=1977|publisher=Jonathan Cape|location=London|pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Chatwin lived with his parents and younger brother Hugh (born in 1944&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in [[West Heath, West Midlands|West Heath]] in Birmingham, where his father had a [[lawyer|law practice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|first1=Elizabeth|title=Under the Sun|date=2010|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of seven he was sent to [[boarding school]] at Old Hall School in [[Shropshire]], and then [[Marlborough College]], in [[Wiltshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shakespeare|1999|p=65}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An unexceptional student, he garnered attention from his performances in school plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at Marlborough, Chatwin attained [[GCE Advanced Level (United Kingdom)|A-levels]] in Latin, Greek, and Ancient History.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|first1=Nicholas|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chatwin had hoped to read [[Classics]] at [[Merton College]], [[Oxford]], but the end of [[National Service in the United Kingdom]] meant there was more competition for university places. He was forced to consider other options. His parents discouraged the ideas he offered — an acting career or work in the [[Colonial Service]] in [[Kenya]]. Instead, Chatwin's father asked one of his clients for a letter of introduction to the auction house [[Sotheby's]]. An interview was arranged, and Chatwin secured a job there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|first1=Nicholas|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|publisher=Viking|location=New York|isbn=0-385-49829-2|pages=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art and archaeology===
In 1958, Chatwin moved to London to begin work as a porter in the Works of Art department at Sotheby's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shakespeare|1999|p=86}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Chatwin was ill-suited for this job, which included dusting objects that had been kept in storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|first1=Nicholas|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|publisher=Viking|pages=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sotheby's]] moved him to a junior cataloguer position working in both the [[Antiquities]] and [[Impressionist|Impressionist Art]] departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position enabled him to develop his eye for art, and he quickly became known for his ability to discern [[forgeries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work as a cataloguer also taught him to describe objects in a concise manner and required him to research these objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chatwin advanced to become Sotheby's expert on Antiquities and Impressionist art and would later run both departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shakespeare|1999|p=176}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Chatwin's colleagues thought he would eventually become chairman of the auction house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period Chatwin travelled extensively for his job and also for adventure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=119–120, 166–167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Travel offered him a relief from the [[Social class in the United Kingdom|British class system]], which he found stifling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ignatieff|first1=Michael|title=Interview: Bruce Chatwin|journal=Granta|date=25 June 1987|issue=21|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; An admirer of [[Robert Byron]] and his book, ''[[The Road to Oxiana]]'', he travelled twice to [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=514}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also used these trips to visit markets and shops where he would buy antiques which he would resell at a profit in order to supplement his income from Sotheby's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became friends with artists and art collectors and dealers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clapp|title=With Chatwin|date=1996|pages=101–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=98–99; 118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; One friend, [[Howard Hodgkin]], painted Chatwin in ''The Japanese Screen'' (1962). Chatwin said he was the "acid green smear on the left."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|title=What Am I Doing Here|date=1989|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chatwin was ambivalent about his sexual orientation and had affairs with both men and women during this period of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=131–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his girlfriends, Elizabeth Chanler, an American and a descendent of [[John Jacob Astor]], was a secretary at Sotheby's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=139–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chanler had earned a degree in [[history]] from [[Radcliffe College]] and worked at Sotheby's [[New York (state)|New York]] offices for two years before transferring to their London office in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=146–148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her love of travel and independent nature appealed to Chatwin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1960s Chatwin grew unhappy at Sotheby's. There were various reasons for his disenchantment. Both women and men found Chatwin attractive, and [[Peter Wilson (auctioneer)|Peter Wilson]], then chairman of Sotheby's, used this appeal to the auction house's advantage when using Chatwin to try to persuade wealthy individuals to sell their art collections. Chatwin became increasingly uncomfortable with the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=123–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in life Chatwin also spoke of having become "burnt out" and said, "In the end I felt I might just as well be working for a rather superior funeral parlour. One's whole life seemed to be spent valuing for probate the apartment of somebody recently dead."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Nicholas | authorlink = Nicholas Murray (biographer)|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1994|publisher=[[Seren Books]]|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1964 he began to suffer from problems with his sight, which he attributed to the close analysis of art work entailed by his job. He consulted eye specialist [[Patrick Trevor-Roper]], who diagnosed a latent [[Strabismus|squint]] and recommended that Chatwin take a six-month break from his work at Sotheby's. Trevor-Roper had been involved in the design of an eye hospital in [[Addis Ababa]], and suggested Chatwin visit [[East Africa]]. In February 1965, Chatwin left for [[Sudan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shakespeare|1999|pp=158–159}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was on this trip that Chatwin first encountered a [[nomad]]ic tribe; their way of life intrigued him. "My nomadic guide," he wrote, "carried a sword, a purse and a pot of scented goat's grease for anointing his hair. He made me feel overburdened and inadequate...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|title=Anatomy of Restlessness|date=1996|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chatwin would remain fascinated by nomads for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=171–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chatwin returned to Sotheby's, and to the surprise of his friends, proposed marriage to Elizabeth Chanler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; They married on 21 August 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chatwin was bisexual throughout their married life, a circumstance Elizabeth knew and accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chatwin had hoped he would "grow out of" his homosexual behaviour and have a successful marriage like his parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; During their marriage, Chatwin had many affairs, mostly with men. Some who were aware of Chatwin's affairs with men assumed the Chatwins had a chaste marriage, but according to [[Nicholas Shakespeare]], the author's biographer, this was not true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shakespeare|first1=Nicholas|title=He wandered, but always came back: Bruce Chatwin's letters reveal the rock-solid marriage that survived his gay flings|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA235968816&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=nysl_ca_bethlm&amp;it=r&amp;p=STND&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=8c5ef3b85cebb9613bd2adf44d32a11e|accessdate=27 July 2015|work=Sunday Times|date=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Chatwin and his wife had hoped to have children, but they remained childless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1966, at the age of 26, Chatwin was promoted to a director of Sotheby's, a position to which he had aspired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; To his disappointment, he was made a junior director and lacked voting rights on the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; This disappointment, along with boredom and increasing discomfort over potentially illegal side deals taking place at Sotheby's, including the sale of objects from the [[Pitt Rivers Museum|Pitt-Rivers museum collection]], led Chatwin to resign from his Sotheby's post in June 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shakespeare|1999|p=178}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chatwin enrolled in October 1966 at the [[University of Edinburgh]] to study [[Archaeology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shakespeare|1999|p=189}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He had regretted not attending Oxford and had been contemplating going to university for a few years. A visit in December 1965 to the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]] in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] sparked his interest in the field of archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite winning the Wardrop Prize for the best first year's work,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shakespeare|1999|p=192}}.&lt;/ref&gt; he found the [[rigour]] of academic archaeology tiresome, and he left after two years without taking a degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shakespeare|1999|p=214}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Nomadic Alternative''===
Following his departure from Edinburgh, Chatwin decided to pursue a career as a writer, successfully pitching a book proposal on [[nomad]]s to [[Tom Maschler]], publisher at [[Jonathan Cape]]. Chatwin tentatively titled the book ''The Nomadic Alternative'' and sought to answer the question "Why do men wander rather than stand still?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|first1=Bruce|title=Anatomy of Restlessness|date=1996|publisher=Viking|location=New York|isbn=0-670-86859-0|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chatwin delivered the manuscript in 1972, and Maschler declined to publish it, calling it a "chore to read".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|first1=Elizabeth|title=Under the Sun|date=2010|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1969 and 1972, as he was working on ''The Nomadic Alternative'', Chatwin travelled extensively and pursued other endeavours in an attempt to establish a creative career. He co-curated an exhibit on ''Nomadic Art of the Asian Steppes,'' which opened at Asia House Gallery in [[New York City]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered publishing an account of his 1969 trip to Afghanistan with [[Peter Levi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levi published his own book about it, ''The Light Garden of the Angel King: Journeys in Afghanistan'' (1972).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1993|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chatwin contributed two articles on nomads to [[Vogue (British magazine)|''Vogue'']] and another article to ''[[History Today]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s Chatwin had an affair with [[James Ivory]], a film director. He pitched stories to him for possible films, which Ivory did not take seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972 Chatwin tried his hand at film-making and travelled to [[Niger]] to make a documentary about nomads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespere|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was lost while Chatwin was trying to sell it to European television companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chatwin also took photographs of his journeys and attempted to sell photographs from a trip to [[Mauritania]] to ''[[The Sunday Times Magazine]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=273–274}}&lt;/ref&gt; While ''The Times'' did not accept those photographs for publication, it did offer Chatwin a job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Sunday Times Magazine'' and ''In Patagonia''===
{{Further| In Patagonia}}
In 1972, ''The Sunday Times Magazine'' hired Chatwin as an adviser on art and [[architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shakespeare|1999|p=267}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially his role was to suggest story ideas and put together features such as "One Million Years of Art," which ran in several issues during the summer of 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; His editor, [[Francis Wyndham (writer)|Francis Wyndham]], encouraged him to write, which allowed him to develop his narrative skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=285–286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chatwin travelled on many international assignments, writing on such subjects as Algerian [[migrant workers]] and the [[Great Wall of China]], and interviewing such diverse people as [[André Malraux]], [[Maria Reiche]], and [[Madeleine Vionnet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shakespeare|1999|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|title=Anatomy of Restlessness|date=1996|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Chatwin interviewed the 93-year-old architect and designer [[Eileen Gray]] in her Paris salon, where he noticed a map she had painted of the area of South America called [[Patagonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shakespeare|1999|p=286}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "I've always wanted to go there," Chatwin told her. "So have I," she replied, "Go there for me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|first1=Bruce|title=Anatomy of Restlessness|date=1997|publisher=Penguin|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, in November 1974, Chatwin flew out to [[Lima]] in [[Peru]], and reached Patagonia a month later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shakespeare|1999|pp=287–291}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He would later claim that he sent a [[telegram]] to Wyndham merely stating: "Have gone to Patagonia." Actually he sent a letter: "I am doing a story there for myself, something I have always wanted to write up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the end of Chatwin's role as a regular writer for ''The Sunday Times Magazine'', although in subsequent years he contributed occasional pieces, including a profile of [[Indira Gandhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|first1=Nicholas|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|publisher=Viking|location=New York|pages=294–295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chatwin spent six months in Patagonia, travelling around gathering stories of people who came from elsewhere and settled there. This trip resulted in the book, ''In Patagonia'' (1977). He used his quest for his own "piece of brontosaurus" (the one from his grandparents' cabinet had been thrown away years earlier) to frame the story of his trip. Chatwin described ''In Patagonia'' as "the narrative of an actual journey and a symbolic one.... It is supposed to fall into the category or be a spoof of Wonder Voyage: the narrator goes to a far country in search of a strange animal: on his way he lands in strange situations, people or other books tell him strange stories which add up to form a message."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|first1=Elizabeth|title=Under the Sun|date=2010|page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''In Patagonia'' contains fifteen black and white photographs by Chatwin. According to [[Susannah Clapp]], who edited the book, "[[Rebecca West]] amused Chatwin by telling him that these were so good they rendered superfluous the entire text of the book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clapp|title=With Chatwin|date=1996|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This work established Chatwin's reputation as a travel writer. One of his biographers, [[Nicholas Murray (biographer)|Nicholas Murray]], called ''In Patagonia'' "one of the most strikingly original post-war English travel books"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said that it revitalised the genre of travel writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1993|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, residents in the region contradicted the account of events depicted in Chatwin's book. It was the first time in his career, but not the last, that conversations and characters which Chatwin presented as fact were later alleged to be fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''In Patagonia'' Chatwin received the [[Hawthornden Prize]] and the [[E. M. Forster Award]] from the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=372–373}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Graham Greene]], [[Patrick Leigh Fermor]], and [[Paul Theroux]] praised the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|first1=Nicholas|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|publisher=Viking|location=New York|pages=325–326}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the success of ''In Patagonia'', Chatwin's circle of friends expanded to include people like [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]], [[Susan Sontag]], and [[Jasper Johns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=374–375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ouidah and the Black Hills===
{{Further| The Viceroy of Ouidah}}

Upon his return from Patagonia, Chatwin discovered a change in leadership at ''The Sunday Times Magazine'' and his retainer was discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=321–322}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chatwin intended his next project to be a [[biography]] of [[Francisco Félix de Sousa]], a 19th-century [[slave trader]] born in Brazil, who became the [[Viceroy]] of [[Ouidah]] in [[Dahomey]]. Chatwin had first heard of De Sousa during a visit to Dahomey in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=338}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the country, by then renamed the [[People's Republic of Benin]], in December 1976 to conduct research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=341}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1977, during the [[1977 Benin coup d'état attempt]], Chatwin was accused of being a mercenary and detained for three days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=348–350}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chatwin later wrote about this experience in "A Coup — A Story," which was published in ''Granta'' and included in ''What Am I Doing Here?'' (1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1993|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his arrest and release, Chatwin left Benin and went to Brazil to continue his research on de Sousa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frustrated by the lack of documented information on de Sousa, Chatwin chose instead to write a fictionalised biography of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=356}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book was published in 1980, and [[Werner Herzog]]'s film, ''[[Cobra Verde]]'' (1987), is based on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|title=What Am I Doing Here|date=1989|pages=138–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''The Viceroy of Ouidah'' received good reviews, it did not sell well. Nicholas Shakespeare said that the dismal sales caused Chatwin to pursue a completely different subject for his next book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=394–395}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to his growing reputation as a travel writer, Chatwin said he "decided to write something about people who never went out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clapp|first1=Susannah|title=With Chatwin|date=1996|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; His next book, ''On the Black Hill'' (1982), is a novel of twin brothers who live all of their lives in a farmhouse on the Welsh borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|first1=Bruce|title=On the Black Hill|date=1982|publisher=Jonathan Cape|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this book Chatwin won the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] and the [[Whitbread prize|Whitbread Prize for Best First Novel]], even though he considered his previous book, ''The Viceroy of Ouidah'', a novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=395}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was made into a film in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s Chatwin spent an increasing amount of time in New York City. He continued to have affairs with men, but most of these affairs were short-lived. In 1977 he began his first serious affair with Donald Richards, an Australian stockbroker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=360}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richards introduced him to the [[gay nightclub]] scene in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=362–369}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period Chatwin became acquainted with [[Robert Mapplethorpe]], who photographed him. Chatwin is one of the few men Mapplethorpe photographed fully clothed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=368}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chatwin later contributed the introduction to a book of Mapplethorpe's photographs, ''Lady, Lisa Lyon'' (1983).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1993|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Elizabeth Chatwin had accepted her husband's affairs, their relationship deteriorated in the late 1970s, and in 1980 she asked for a separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=392–393, 420}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1982 Chatwin's affair with Richards had ended and he began another serious affair with [[Jasper Conran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=429, 424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Songlines''===
{{Further| The Songlines}}
In 1983 Chatwin returned to the topic of nomads and decided to focus on [[Aboriginal Australians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shakespeare |title=Bruce Chatwin |date=1999 |pages=426, 433}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was influenced by the work of [[Theodore Strehlow]], a controversial figure who was the author of ''Songs of Central Australia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=426, 431–432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strehlow had collected and recorded Aboriginal songs, and shortly before his death in 1978, he sold photographs of secret Aboriginal initiation ceremonies to a magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chatwin went to Australia to learn more about [[Aboriginal culture]], specifically the [[songline]]s or dreaming tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=438}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each songline is a personal story and functions as a creation tale and a map, and each Aboriginal Australian has their own songline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|title=The Songlines|date=1987|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chatwin thought the songlines could be used as a metaphor to support his ideas about humans' need to wander, which he believed was genetic. However, he struggled fully to understand and describe the songlines and their place in Aboriginal culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=458}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to Chatwin's approach to learning about the songlines. He spent several weeks in 1983 and 1984 in Australia, during which he primarily relied on non-Aboriginal people for information, as he was limited by his inability to speak the Aboriginal languages. He interviewed people involved in the [[Land Rights, Australia|Land Rights]] movement, and he alienated many of them because he was oblivious to the politics and also because he was an admirer of Strehlow's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=434–442}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
While in Australia, Chatwin, who had been experiencing some health problems, first read about AIDS, then known as the gay plague. It frightened him and compelled him to reconcile with his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=448}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fear of AIDS also drove him to finish the book that became ''The Songlines'' (1987). His friend the novelist [[Salman Rushdie]] said, "That book was an obsession too great for him.... His illness did him a favour, got him free of it. Otherwise, he would have gone on writing it for ten years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Songlines'' features a narrator named Bruce whose biography is almost identical to Chatwin's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=440}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrator spends time in Australia trying to learn about Aboriginal culture, specifically the songlines. As the book goes on, it becomes a reflection on what Chatwin stated was "for me, the question of questions: the nature of human restlessness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|title=The Songlines|date=1987|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chatwin also hinted at his preoccupation over his own mortality in the text: "I had a presentiment that the 'travelling' phase of my life might be passing.... I should set down on paper a resume of the ideas, quotations, and encounters that amused me and obsessed me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|title=The Songlines|date=1987|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this statement in ''The Songlines'' Chatwin included extensive excerpts from his moleskine notebooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|title=The Songlines|pages=163–233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chatwin published ''The Songlines'' in 1987, and it became a bestseller in the United Kingdom and in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=512}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was nominated for the [[Thomas Cook Travel Award]], but Chatwin requested that it be withdrawn from consideration, saying the work was fictional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=512}}&lt;/ref&gt; After its publication, Chatwin became friends with the composer [[Kevin Volans]], who was inspired to base a theatre score on the book. The project evolved into an opera, ''The Man with Footsoles of Wind'' (1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illness and final works===
While at work on ''The Songlines'' between 1983 and 1986, Chatwin frequently came down with colds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=450, 464, 479, 487}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also developed skin lesions that may have been symptoms of [[Kaposi's sarcoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=450, 522}}&lt;/ref&gt; After finishing ''The Songlines'' in August 1986, Chatwin went to Switzerland, where he collapsed in the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=488}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a clinic there, he was diagnosed as HIV-positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=489}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chatwin provided different reasons to his doctors as to how he might have contracted HIV, including from a gang rape in Dahomey or possibly from [[Sam Wagstaff]], the [[patron]] and lover of Robert Mapplethorpe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=490–491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chatwin's case was unusual as he had a fungal infection, ''[[Penicillium marneffei]]'', which at the time had rarely been seen and only in South Asia. It is now known as an [[AIDS-defining illness]], but in 1986 little was known about HIV and AIDS. Doctors were not certain if all cases of HIV developed into AIDS. The rare fungus gave Chatwin hope that he might be different and served as the basis of what he told most people about his illness. He gave various reasons for how he became infected with the fungus — ranging from eating a thousand-year-old egg to exploring a bat cave in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=493–494}}&lt;/ref&gt; He never publicly disclosed that he was HIV-positive because of the stigma at the time. He wanted to protect his parents, who were unaware of his homosexual affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=491–492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Chatwin never spoke or wrote publicly about his disease, in one instance he did write about the AIDS epidemic in 1988 in a letter to the editor of the ''[[London Review of Books]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt; "The word 'Aids' is one of the cruellest and silliest neologisms of our time. 'Aid' means help, succour, comfort—yet with a hissing sibilant tacked onto the end it becomes a nightmare.... HIV (Human Immuno-Deficiency Virus) is a perfectly easy name to live with. 'Aids' causes panic and despair and has probably done something to facilitate the spread of the disease."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|first1=Elizabeth|title=Under the Sun|date=2010|page=594}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

During his illness, Chatwin continued to write. Elizabeth encouraged him to use a letter he had written to her from Prague in 1967 as an inspiration for a new story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=500}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this trip, he had met Konrad Just, an art collector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=502}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meeting and the letter to Elizabeth served as the basis for Chatwin's next work. ''[[Utz (novel)|Utz]]'' (1988) was a novel about the obsession that leads people to collect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=503}}&lt;/ref&gt; Set in [[Prague]], the novel details the life and death of Kaspar Utz, a man obsessed with his collection of [[Meissen porcelain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|first1=Bruce|title=Utz|date=1988|publisher=Jonathan Cape|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Utz'' was well-received and was shortlisted for the Booker Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chatwin also edited a collection of his journalism, which was published as ''What Am I Doing Here'' (1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=565}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death in 1989, he was working on a number of new ideas for future novels, including a transcontinental epic provisionally titled ''Lydia Livingstone''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=529–530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chatwin died at a hospital in [[Nice]] on 18 January 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=561}}&lt;/ref&gt; A memorial service was held at the [[Greek Orthodox]] Church of [[Saint Sophia (London)|Saint Sophia]] in West London on 14 February 1989, the same day that a ''[[The Satanic Verses controversy|fatwa]]'' was announced on [[Salman Rushdie]], a close friend of Chatwin's, who attended the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=571–572}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Theroux]], who also attended the service, later commented on it and Chatwin in a piece for ''[[Granta]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.granta.com/Online-Only/Paul-Theroux Theroux's "admiring tribute" to Chatwin],&lt;/ref&gt;  The novelist [[Martin Amis]] described the memorial service in the essay "Salman Rushdie", included in his [[anthology]] ''[[Visiting Mrs Nabokov]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Amis|first1=Martin|title=Visiting Mrs. Nabokov|date=2012|publisher=Vintage|pages=170–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chatwin's ashes were scattered near a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] chapel above [[Kardamili|Kardamyli]] in the [[Peloponnese]]. This was close to the home of one of his mentors, the writer [[Patrick Leigh Fermor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=573}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chatwin had spent several months in 1985 near there, working on ''The Songlines''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=465, 469–473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chatwin's papers, including 85 moleskine notebooks, were given to the [[Bodleian Library]], Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two collections of his photographs and excerpts from the moleskine notebooks were published as ''Photographs and Notebooks'' (US title: ''Far Journeys'') in 1993 and ''Winding Paths'' in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|first1=Bruce|title=Far Journeys|date=1993|publisher=Viking|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|first1=Bruce|title=Winding Paths: Photographs from Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|publisher=Jonathan Cape}}&lt;/ref&gt;

News of Chatwin's AIDS diagnosis first surfaced in September 1988, although the obituaries at the time of his death had referred to Chatwin's statements about a rare fungal infection. After his death, some members of the gay community criticised Chatwin for lack of courage to reveal the true nature of his illness, thinking he would have raised public awareness of AIDS, as he was one of the first high-profile individuals in Britain known to have contracted HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Nicholas|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1993|pages=123–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=524–525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing style==
[[John Updike]] described Chatwin's writing as "a clipped, lapidary prose that compresses worlds into pages",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Updike|first1=John|title=Odd Jobs: Essays and Criticism|date=1991|publisher=Knopf|page=464}}&lt;/ref&gt; while one of Chatwin's editors, Susannah Clapp, wrote, "Although his syntax was pared down, his words were not — or at least not only — plain.... His prose is both spare and flamboyant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clapp|title=With Chatwin|date=1996|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chatwin's writing was shaped by his work as a cataloguer at Sotheby's, which provided him with years of practice in writing concise, yet vivid descriptions of objects with the intention of enticing buyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, his writing was influenced by his interest in nomads. One aspect that interested him was the few possessions they had. Their Spartan way of life appealed to his aesthetic sense, and he sought to emulate it in his life and his writing, striving to strip needless objects from his life and needless words from his prose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=117, 171, 467–468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chatwin experimented with format in his writing. With ''In Patagonia'', Clapp said Chatwin described the book's structure of 97 vignettes as "[[Cubist]]." "[I]n other words," she said, "lots of small pictures tilting away and toward each other to create this strange original portrait of Patagonia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=325}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Songlines'' was another attempt by Chatwin to experiment with format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=513}}&lt;/ref&gt; It begins as a novel narrated by a man named Bruce, but about two-thirds of the way through it becomes a commonplace book filled with quotations, anecdotes, and summaries of others' research, in an attempt to explore restlessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|title=The Songlines|date=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Chatwin's critics did not think he succeeded in ''The Songlines'' with this approach, but others applauded his effort at an unconventional structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=512–513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several 19th and 20th-century writers influenced Chatwin's work. He admitted to imitating the work of Robert Byron when he first began making notes of his travels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|first1=Bruce|title=What Am I Doing Here|date=1989|page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Patagonia he read [[In Our Time (short story collection)|''In Our Time'']] by Ernest Hemingway, whom he admired for his spare prose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=289–290}}&lt;/ref&gt; While writing ''In Patagonia'', Chatwin strove to approach his writing as a "literary [[Henri Cartier-Bresson|Cartier-Bresson]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chatwin's biographer described the resulting prose as "quick snapshots of ordinary people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Hemingway and Cartier-Bresson, [[Osip Mandelstam]]'s work strongly influenced Chatwin during the writing of ''In Patagonia''. An admirer of [[Noël Coward]], Chatwin found the breakfast scene in ''[[Private Lives]]'' helpful in learning to write dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|first1=Bruce|title=What Am I Doing Here|date=1989|publisher=Viking|location=New York|page=366}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once Chatwin began work on ''The Viceroy of Ouidah'', he began studying the work of 19th-century French authors such as [[Honoré de Balzac]] and [[Gustave Flaubert]], who would continue to influence him for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=380–383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Chatwin explored several different themes in his work: human restlessness and wandering; borders and exile; and art and objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|title=The Songlines|date=1987|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1993|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=502–505}}&lt;/ref&gt; He
considered human restlessness to be the focus of his writing. He ultimately aspired to explore the subject in order to answer what he saw as a fundamental question of human existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|first1=Elizabeth|title=Under the Sun|date=2010|pages=131–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|title=The Songlines|date=1987|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought humans were meant to be a migratory species, and once they settled in one place, their natural urges "found outlets in violence, greed, status-seeking or a mania for the new."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first attempt at writing a book, ''The Nomadic Alternative'', Chatwin had tried to compose an academic exposition on nomadic culture, which he believed was unexamined and unappreciated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|first1=Elizabeth|title=Under the Sun|date=2010|pages=131–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this, Chatwin had hoped to discover: "Why do men wander rather than sit still?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|first1=Elizabeth|title=Under the Sun|date=2010|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book proposal he admitted that the interest in the subject was personal: "Why do I become restless after a month in a single place, unbearable after two?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|first1=Elizabeth|title=Under the Sun|date=2010|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Chatwin did not succeed with ''The Nomadic Alternative'', he returned to the topic of restlessness and wandering in subsequent books. Writer Jonathan Chatwin (no relation) stated that Chatwin's works can be grouped into two categories: "restlessness defined" and "restlessness explained." Most of his work focuses on describing restlessness, such as in the case of one twin in ''On the Black Hill'' who longs to leave home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10036/41273|last1=Chatwin|first1=Jonathan|title=Anywhere Out of the World: Restlessness in the work of Bruce Chatwin|date=2008|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the protagonist of ''Utz'', who feels restless to escape to [[Vichy]] each year, but always returns to [[Prague]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=508}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chatwin attempted to explain restlessness in ''The Songlines'', which focused on the Aboriginal Australians' [[walkabout]]. For this, he returned to his research from ''The Nomadic Alternative''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10036/41273|last1=Chatwin|first1=Jonathan|title=Anywhere Out of the World: Restlessness in the work of Bruce Chatwin|date=2008|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Borders are another Chatwin theme. According to Elizabeth Chatwin, he "was interested in borders, where things were always changing, not one thing or another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patagonia, the subject of his first published book, is an area that is in both Argentina and Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Viceroy of Ouidah is a Brazilian who trades slaves in Dahomey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''On the Black Hills'' takes place on the borders of Wales and England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=395}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Songlines'' the characters the protagonist mostly interacts with are people who provide a bridge between the Aboriginal and white Australian worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=434–435}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main character in ''Utz'' travels back and forth across the [[Iron Curtain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The theme of exile, of people living at the margins.... is treated in a literal and metaphorical sense throughout Chatwin's work," stated Nicholas Murray. He identified several examples. There were people who were actual exiles, like some of those profiled in ''In Patagonia'', and the Viceroy of Ouidah, unable to return to Brazil. Murray also cited the main characters in ''On the Black Hill'': "Although not strictly exiles.... [they] were exiles from the major events of their time and its dominant values." Similarly, Murray wrote, Utz is "trapped in a society whose values are not his own but which he cannot bring himself to leave."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1993|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chatwin returned to the subject of art and objects during his career. In his early writing for the ''Sunday Times Magazine'', he wrote about art and artists, and many of these articles were included in ''What Am I Doing Here''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=280–284}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main focus of ''Utz'' is on the impact the possession of art (in this case porcelain figures) has on a collector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=504–505}}&lt;/ref&gt; Utz's unwillingness to give up his porcelain collection kept him in Czechoslovakia even though he had the opportunity to live in the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=503}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chatwin constantly struggled with the conflicting desires to own beautiful items and to live in a space free of unnecessary objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; His distaste for the art world resulted from his days at Sotheby's; some of his final writing focused on this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=197, 505}}&lt;/ref&gt; The topic appears in the final section of ''What Am I Doing Here'', "Tales from the Art World," which consists of four short stories. At the end of ''What Am I Doing Here'', Chatwin shares an anecdote of advice he received from [[Noël Coward]]: "Never let anything artistic stand in your way." Chatwin stated, "I've always acted on that advice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|title=What Am I Doing Here|date=1989|page=366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
With the publication of ''In Patagonia'', Chatwin invigorated the genre of [[travel writing]]; according to his biographer, Nicholas Murray, he "showed that an inventive writer could breathe new life into an old genre."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Nicholas|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1993|publisher=Seren Books|pages=39, 44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of his clear, yet vivid prose and an international perspective at a time when many English writers were more focused on home instead of abroad helped to set him apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Nicholas|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1993|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|first1=Nicholas|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=564, 569}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from his writing, Chatwin was also good looking, and his image as a dashing traveller added to his appeal and helped make him a celebrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|first1=Nicholas|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=564}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the eyes of younger writers such as [[Rory Stewart]], Chatwin "made [travel writing] cool."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stewart|first1=Rory|title=Walking with Chatwin|journal=The New York Review of Books|date=25 June 2012|url=http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2012/06/25/walking-with-bruce-chatwin/|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Andrew Harvey (journalist)|Andrew Harvey]] wrote, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Nearly every writer of my generation in England has wanted, at some point, to be Bruce Chatwin; wanted, like him, to talk of [[Kingdom of Fez|Fez]] and [[Firdausi]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Nuristan]], with equal authority; wanted to be talked about, as he is, with raucous envy; wanted above all to have written his books."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harvey|first1=Andrew|title=Footprints of the Ancestor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/02/books/footprints-of-the-ancestors.html?pagewanted=1|accessdate=27 July 2015|work=The New York Times|date=2 August 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chatwin's books also inspired some readers to visit Patagonia and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=515, 577}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Patagonia experienced an increase in tourism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=577}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it became a common sight for tourists to appear in the region, carrying a copy of ''In Patagonia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=Sandra|title=In Patagonia in Patagonia|journal=The Paris Review|date=14 May 2013|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2013/05/14/in-patagonia-in-patagonia/|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Songlines'' also inspired readers to travel to Australia and seek out the people on whom Chatwin had based his characters, much to their consternation, as he had failed to disclose such intentions to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond travel, Chatwin influenced other writers, such as [[Claudio Magris]], [[Luis Sepúlveda]], [[Philip Marsden]], and [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|first1=Nicholas|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|publisher=Viking|location=New York|page=569}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas Shakespeare stated that some of Chatwin's impact came from the difficulty of categorising his work, which helped to "set free other writers...[from] conventional boundaries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|first1=Nicholas|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|publisher=Viking|location=New York|page=568}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was often called a travel writer, he did not identify himself as one, or as a novelist. ("I don't quite know the meaning of the word novel," he said).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He preferred to call his writing stories or searches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Nicholas|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1993|publisher=Seren|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was interested in asking big questions about human existence, sharing unusual tales, and making connections between ideas from various sources. His friend and fellow writer [[Robyn Davidson]] said, "He posed questions we all want answered and perhaps gave the illusion they were answerable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|first1=Nicholas|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|publisher=Viking|location=New York|page=569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Posthumous influence===
According to his biographer [[Nicholas Shakespeare]], Chatwin's work developed a cult-like following in the years immediately after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|first1=Elizabeth|title=Under the Sun: The Letters of Bruce Chatwin|date=2010|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1998 a million copies of his books had been sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=578}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his reputation diminished following revelations about his personal life and questions about the accuracy of his work.

The accuracy problem had arisen before his death, and Chatwin had admitted to "counting up the lies" in ''In Patagonia'', though he stated there were not many.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Nicholas|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1993|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; While researching Chatwin's life, Nicholas Shakespeare stated he found "few cases of mere invention" in ''In Patagonia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|first1=Nicholas|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|publisher=Viking|location=New York|page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mostly, these tended to be instances of embellishment, such as when Chatwin wrote of a nurse who loved the work of [[Osip Mandelstam]] – one of his favorite authors – when in fact she was a fan of [[Agatha Christie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|first1=Nicholas|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|publisher=Viking|location=New York|page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Michael Ignatieff]] asked Chatwin his opinion of what divided fact from fiction, he replied, "I don't think there is [a division]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ignatieff|first1=Michael|title=Interview: Bruce Chatwin|journal=Granta|date=25 June 1987|issue=21|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some individuals profiled in ''In Patagonia'' were unhappy with Chatwin's portrayals of them. They included a man whom Chatwin insinuated was homosexual and a woman who thought her father was unjustly accused of killing Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Chatwin's biographer found one farmer who was featured in the book who thought Chatwin's depictions of himself and other members of his community were truthful. He stated, "No one likes looking at their own passport photograph, but I found it accurate. It's not flattering, but it's the truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chatwin's bestseller, ''The Songlines'', has been the focus of much criticism. Some describe his viewpoint as "[[colonialist]]", citing his lack of interviews with Aboriginals and reliance instead on white Australians for information about Aboriginal culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=515–516}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other criticism comes from anthropologists and other researchers who spent years studying Aboriginal culture and dismiss Chatwin's work because he visited Australia briefly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=434–435}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet others, such as writer [[Thomas Keneally]], believe ''The Songlines'' should be widely read in Australia, where many people had not previously heard of the songlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=513, 516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The questions about the veracity of Chatwin's writing are compounded by the revelation of his sexual orientation and the true cause of his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=566}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once it became known that Chatwin had been bisexual and had died of an AIDS-related illness, some critics viewed him as a liar and dismissed his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|first1=Elizabeth|title=Under the Sun: The Letters of Bruce Chatwin|date=2010|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas Shakespeare said, "His denial [of his AIDS diagnosis] bred a sense that if he lied about his life, he must have lied about his work. Some readers have taken this as a cue to pass judgement on his books – or else not to bother with them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|first1=Elizabeth|title=Under the Sun: The Letters of Bruce Chatwin|date=2010|publisher=Jonathan Cape|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 ''[[The Guardian]]'s'' review of ''Under the Sun: The Letters of Bruce Chatwin'' opened with the question, "Does anyone read Bruce Chatwin these days?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morrison|first1=Blake|title=Under the Sun: The Letters of Bruce Chatwin|journal=The Guardian|date=3 September 2010|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/sep/04/bruce-chatwin-letters-nicholas-shakespeare|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Rory Stewart has stated, "His personality, his learning, his myths, and even his prose are less hypnotizing [than they once were]. And yet he remains a great writer, of deep and enduring importance.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stewart|first1=Rory|title=Walking with Chatwin|journal=The New York Review of Books|date=25 June 2012|url=http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2012/06/25/walking-with-bruce-chatwin/|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 ''[[The Times]]'' rated Chatwin No. 46 on their list of "50 Greatest British Writers Since 1945".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=46. Bruce Chatwin; The 50 Greatest British Writers Since 1945|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA173066618&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=nysl_ca_bethlm&amp;it=r&amp;p=STND&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=c87255bba66a6fb8db49007ee6fc1ba5|accessdate=23 July 2015|work=The Times (London)|date=5 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
Chatwin's name is used to sell [[Moleskine]] notebooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=564}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chatwin wrote in ''The Songlines'' of little black [[oilskin]]-covered notebooks that he bought in [[Paris]] and called "moleskines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|title=The Songlines|date=1987|pages=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quotes and anecdotes he had compiled in them serve as a major section of ''The Songlines'', where Chatwin mourned the closure of the last producer of such books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|title=The Songlines|date=1987|pages=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Marta Sebregondi read ''The Songlines'' and proposed to her employer, the Italian design and publishing firm Modo &amp; Modo, that they produce moleskine notebooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raphel|first1=Adrienne|title=The Virtual Moleskine|journal=The New Yorker|date=14 April 2014|url=http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-virtual-moleskine|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the company began to sell them and use Chatwin's name to promote them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harkin|first1=James|title=Resurrecting Moleskine Notebooks|journal=Newsweek|date=12 June 2011|url=http://www.newsweek.com/resurrecting-moleskine-notebooks-67817|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modo &amp; Modo was sold in 2006, and the company became known as Moleskine SpA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raphel|first1=Adrienne|title=The Virtual Moleskine|journal=The New Yorker|date=14 April 2014|url=http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-virtual-moleskine|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the clothing label [[Burberry]] produced a collection inspired by Chatwin's books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marriott|first1=Hannah|title=Books inspire Burberry's show at London Collections: Men|journal=The Guardian|date=17 June 2014|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/jun/17/books-inspire-burberry-show-london-collections-men}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Burberry released a limited edition of Chatwin's books with specially designed covers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Connor|first1=Liz|title=Burberry's Bruce Chatwin books just made your shelf far more stylish|journal=GQ|date=8 May 2015|url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/style/articles/2015-05/09/burberry-bruce-chatwin-book-release-christopher-bailey|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208121230/http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/style/articles/2015-05/09/burberry-bruce-chatwin-book-release-christopher-bailey|archivedate=8 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edgar Dewdney''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|PC}} (November 5, 1835 &amp;ndash; August 8, 1916) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] surveyor, road builder, Indian commissioner and politician born in [[Devon]]shire, [[England]]. He emigrated to British Columbia in 1859 in order to act as surveyor for the [[Dewdney Trail]] that runs through the province. In 1870, Dewdney decided to take up a role in Canadian government. In this year, he was elected to the Legislative Council of British Columbia as a representative form the Kootenay region. In 1872, he was elected as a member of Federal Government for the Yale region representing the Conservative party. He was reelected to this position in 1874 and again in 1878. Dewdney served as [[Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories]] from 1879 to 1888, and the fifth [[Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia]] from 1892 to 1897. Additionally, he served as the Indian commissioner in the North-West Territories from 1879 until 1888.  In 1897, Dewdney retired from politics and began working as a financial agent until his death in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lop.parl.ca/sites/ParlInfo/default/en_CA/People/Profile?personId=8373|title=The Hon.

Throughout his political career, Dewdney played a role in the settlement of western Canada and defining the relationship between the government of Canada and the Indigenous peoples of the North-West in the nineteenth century. Dewdney experienced several political and humanitarian issues throughout his political appointments. As Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories, Dewdney had to manage with a starvation crisis faced by the Indigenous peoples after years of buffalo decline. Additionally, as Indian Commissioner, Dewdney  subsequently tackled issues pertaining to the [[North-West Rebellion]] of 1885.

==Early life and career==
Edgar Dewdney was born in Bideford, England to parents Charles Dewdney and Fanny Hollingshead. He grew up in a wealthy family, providing him with many social opportunities. Dewdney had two marriages throughout his life, neither producing any children. The first marriage was to Jane Shaw Moir in 1864, and the second in 1909 to Blanche Elizabeth Plantagenet Kemeys-Tynte.&lt;ref name="Université Laval 2003"&gt;E. Brian Titley. “Dewdney, Edgar” in ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'', vol. 14.

(University of Toronto/Université Laval: 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Dewdney originally wanted to pursue a career in civil engineering, studying the subject at Cardiff University. After his civil engineering training in 1859, he decided to start a life in the Pacific Northwest in hopes of making a fortune with his newly acquired qualifications. In addition, Dewdney was also motivated to move to the North-West Territories after the discovery and further mining of gold in the Fraser Valley.&lt;ref name="Université Laval 2003"/&gt; He was active in the development of pack trails in the colony of British Columbia including the Dewdney Trail which became the main trail into the interior of the colony.&lt;ref name="Université Laval 2003"/&gt;

Dewdney was active in political life in British Columbia throughout the 1860s. Dewdney had a limited understanding of the functions of Canadian politics when his interests first piqued.&lt;ref name="Titley, Brian 1999"&gt;Titley, Brian. ''The Frontier World of Edgar Dewdney''. Toronto, ON: UBC Press, 1999. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; After a few years in Provincial politics, Prime Minister Sir [[John A. Macdonald]] requested Dewdney to become the Indian Commissioner in the North-West, as he knew of the “Indians” in the area quite well.&lt;ref name="Titley, Brian 1999"/&gt; Dewdney had an advantage due to his general knowledge of Indigenous peoples and that he did not originate from Ottawa.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, Brian. ''The Frontier World of Edgar Dewdney''. Toronto, ON: UBC Press, 1999. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in his life, Dewdney held dual titles of Indian Commissioner and Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories.&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey, Hugh A. ''The Amazing Death of Calf Shirt and Other Blackfoot Stories''. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 1994. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia and after three years retired and became a surveyor.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, R.G. ''Carving the Western Path, By River, Rail, and Road Through B.C’s Southern Mountains.'' Toronto, ON: Heritage House, 1998. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his prestigious career in politics, Dewdney was considered suitable to conduct the study and surveying of the Cascades. He discovered three routes, Allison, Coquihalla, and Railroad Passes in his 1902 exhibition. However, he disclosed that he never liked any of these routes due to their engineering difficulties. As a result, Dewdney suggested the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR)]] should be built from Midway to Princeton, then north to Merritt and Spences Bridge, and have Fraser Canyon as the way through the Cascades.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, R.G. ''Carving the Western Path, By River, Rail, and Road Through B.C’s Southern Mountains.'' Toronto, ON: Heritage House, 1998. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Dewdney is recognized as a legendary trail builder of colonial days in British Columbia, as this played a large role in the westward expansion of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, R.G. ''Carving the Western Path, By River, Rail, and Road Through B.C’s Southern Mountains.'' Toronto, ON: Heritage House, 1998. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this recognition, he faced issues regarding Canadian expansionism and the effect on Indigenous peoples.

===Surveyor during the gold rushes of the 1860s===

Dewdney was originally employed as a surveyor, and supervised the survey of [[New Westminster, British Columbia|New Westminster]]. In 1865, Dewdney was appointed by [[Governor of British Columbia|Governor]] [[Frederick Seymour]] to oversee the construction of a trail to the [[Kootenays|East Kootenay]] region of the [[British Columbia Interior]] so that coastal merchants might benefit from the burgeoning trade associated with gold mining in that area. This was also done to secure a line of communication within the region to prevent an American takeover of that part of the province. Although used for only a few years, parts of the Dewdney Trail, as it was known, remain to this day and are used for recreational [[hiking]]. Provincial Highway 3 largely follows the route of the Dewdney Trail.

==Entry into politics==
From 1868 to 1869, Dewdney became active in Colonial politics, representing the electoral district of [[Kootenay (electoral districts)|Kootenay]] in the [[Legislative Council of British Columbia]]. After the Colony joined [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1871, he served as a [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament]] for the riding of [[Yale (electoral district)|Yale]] following his election in 1872. He was appointed a member of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] Sir [[John A. Macdonald]]'s [[Canadian cabinet|cabinet]] in 1879, where he served as Indian commissioner for the [[North-West Territories]] until 1888.

[[File:First Government House shortly after construction in 1883.jpg|thumb|200px|left|First Government House shortly after construction in 1883.]]In 1881, Macdonald arranged Dewdney's appointment as Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories, then an executive position. Dewdney resigned his seat in the [[House of Commons of Canada|Commons]], but remained Indian Commissioner during his term as Lieutenant-Governor, which lasted until 1888. Macdonald, along with being Prime Minister, held the cabinet post Minister of the Interior. Dewdney took orders directly from Macdonald.&lt;ref name = "Kettle"&gt;[http://iportal.usask.ca/docs/ICC/Spidered/ICCP13/4%20-%20Carry%20The%20Kettle%20Cypress%20Hills%20Inquiry%20-%20Parts%20I%20&amp;%20II.pdf Indian Claims Commission. Carry the Kettle First Nation Inquiry, Cypress Hills Claim. pp. 31,32]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Responsible government]] had not been granted to the North-West Territories, so Dewdney was the Territories' head of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thestarphoenix.com/opinion/columnists/history-matters-westerners-had-to-fight-for-vote |title=History matters: Westerners had to fight for vote |last=Waiser |first=Bill |work=[[The StarPhoenix]] |date=2016-03-29 |accessdate=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps his most notable decision in office was changing the territorial [[Capital (political)|capital]] from [[Battleford, Saskatchewan|Battleford]] to [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Wascana]] — Cree for "Pile of Bones" — in 1883: a featureless location without water apart from a short spring run-off [[Wascana Creek]], trees or topography. This is where Dewdney had secured a substantial real estate for himself adjacent to the near-future planned Canadian Pacific Railway line. Other townsites were also considered probable territorial capitals, including [[Fort Qu'Appelle]] and [[Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan|Qu'Appelle]], the latter to the extent of having been designated the cathedral city of the new [[Diocese of Qu'Appelle]] by the [[Anglican Church of Canada|Church of England in Canada]]. The matter was a national scandal at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Berton, ''The Last Spike: The Great Railway 1881-1885'' (Toronto: McLelland and Stewart, 1973), 120)&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the initial major street of Pile of Bones, later renamed Regina by [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Princess Louise, Marchioness of Lorne]], was called Dewdney Avenue.

After his term as Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories, Dewdney was again elected to [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] and served as the [[member of parliament|member]] for Assiniboia East (now southeastern [[Saskatchewan]]) from 1888 to 1891. During this period he also served as Minister of the Interior and Superintendent of Indian Affairs.

In 1892, he was appointed to the non-executive [[viceroy|viceregal]] post of [[Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia]]. He served in this post until 1897.

He retired from politics in 1900, after unsuccessfully running for Parliament in [[New Westminster, British Columbia]].

In 1909, following the death his wife Jane, Dewdney remarried. His new wife was Blanche Kemeys-Tynte, the daughter of [[Colonel]] Charles John Kemeys-Tynte of Halswell, [[Somerset]], [[England]].

==Crisis: The starvation of the natives==

Upon taking office in May, 1879, Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories Edgar Dewdney came face to face with the plight of the natives in the wake of the disappearing buffalo. The exploitation of buffalo for the fur trade had greatly affected the Indigenous peoples who relied completely on every aspect of the buffalo for food, clothing and resources for housing.&lt;ref&gt;McQuillan, D. Aidan. “Creation of indian Reserves on the Canadian Prairies 1870-1885.”

''Geographical Review'' 70, no. 4 (1980): 383.&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous peoples had already starved to death at Qu'Appele, Fort Walsh, Fort Macleod, Battleford, Carlton, Fort Pitt, Fort Saskatchewan, Edmonton, Touchwood Hills, Fort Ellice, Moose Mountain, Fort Calgary, and elsewhere.&lt;ref name = "Kettle" /&gt; Dewdney's solution was to locate the native tribes on reserves. There agents would teach them how to farm.

He reported conditions at the Blackfoot Crossing in July 1879 as follows:

{{quotation|On arriving there I found about 1300 Indians in a very destitute condition, and many on the verge of starvation. Young men who were known to be stout and hearty fellows some months ago were quite emaciated and so weak they could hardly work ; the old people and widows, who with their children live on the charity of the younger and more prosperous, had nothing, and many a pitiable tale was told of the misery they had endured.&lt;ref name = "Scott"&gt;[http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/HistoryofCanadianIndians-1867-1912.htm  Duncan C. Scott, "Indian Affairs, 1867-1912", in Adam Short and Arthur G. Doughty, eds., Canada and Its Provinces, Vol. VII, Toronto, Glasgow, Brook and Company, 1914, pp. 493-526.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By that autumn, seventeen instructors were established at different reserves along with supplies of tools and seed. They began to teach the natives how to farm.&lt;ref name = "Scott" /&gt;

Dewdney was later denounced for not responding to four official requests for food aid during the winter of 1882-83 for "over 2000 Indians here almost naked and on the verge of starvation".&lt;ref&gt;https://elysebruce.wordpress.com/tag/canadian-history/&lt;/ref&gt; When finally pressed to send food supplies after the official requests, Dewdney stated it was government policy to use famine to force Indians onto reserves.

The Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples was conducted by Dewdney in 1880 regarding the administration of Indian Affairs in the North-West Territories. This communication was written to the Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs in Ottawa and provided insight into conditions in the North-West Territories during the 1880s. This report was controversial because it only provided a colonial viewpoint into the lives of Indigenous peoples. The Indigenous voice was omitted from the report, making the report bias to colonial views. Dewdney outlined in the Royal Commission to Inquire into Changes Affecting the Administration of Justice in the North-West Territories that the “scarcity of buffalo in [[Fort Walsh]] had not been exaggerated, and numbers of Indians of the Cree, Assiniboine and Blackfeet were awaiting the arrival of Col. MacLeod and myself.”&lt;ref&gt;Canada. Royal Commission to Inquire Into Changes Affecting the Administration of Justice in the North-West Territories. ''Report of the Royal Commission to Inquire Into Changes Affecting the Administration of Justice in the North-West Territories.'' Ottawa: Indian Affairs, 1880. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The decline of the buffalo populations created a famine which “reduced the Indians to a state of dependence on government relief supplies and even forced the Indians to seek government on their reserves.”&lt;ref&gt;McQuillan, D. Aidan. “Creation of indian Reserves on the Canadian Prairies 1870-1885.” 384.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to resolve the starvation crisis, Dewdney proposed relocating all Indigenous peoples in the region onto reserves. Because of the scarcity in buffalo populations, the government had no other choice but to provide Indigenous peoples on reserves with food rations, distributed by the North-West Mounted Police.

Due to the high decline in the buffalo population, many Indigenous communities were facing starvation. Changes needed to be made in regards to the government’s actions in controlling and alleviating the threat of a starvation crisis. Dewdney traveled to parts of the North-West with Col. [[James Macleod]], the Commissioner of the North-West Mounted Police, in response to the threat of a starvation crisis. Before traveling to Blackfoot Crossing, Macleod stated in Fort Walk that the resolution to the buffalo problem and the starvation of the Indigenous peoples was to promote an agricultural lifestyle rather than one based on the reliance on buffalo. After observing the crisis at Blackfoot Crossing, Dewdney stressed that the Indigenous peoples there should work to relieve themselves of starvation that resulted from the disappearance of buffalo.&lt;ref name="Canada 1880"&gt;Canada. Royal Commission to Inquire Into Changes Affecting the Administration of Justice in the North-West Territories. ''Report of the Royal Commission to Inquire Into Changes Affecting the Administration of Justice in the North-West Territories.'' Ottawa: Indian Affairs, 1880. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed stationing instructors on reserves in order to educate the Indigenous peoples on how to sustain an agricultural society, as well as to provide those on reserves with the necessary supplies. The Royal Commission shows that members of the Blackfoot nation were grateful for Dewdney’s efforts made to ending the crisis.&lt;ref name="Canada 1880"/&gt; Both members of government in Ottawa and Dewdney believed that the Blackfoot Crossing could be a prosperous agricultural settlement. Upon arriving to Blackfoot, Dewdney hoped to talk about this possible prosperity but before his arrival, he had received news that a number of buffalo had crossed through the settlement and destroyed the crops.&lt;ref&gt;Mulvany, Charles P. ''The History of the North-west rebellion of 1885.'' Toronto, ON: A. H. Hovey and CO., 1885. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1880s, government officials such as Dewdney withheld rations from Indigenous people as a tool to bring them into submission.&lt;ref name="Carter, Sarah 1900"&gt;Carter, Sarah. ''Aboriginal People and Colonizers of Western Canada to 1900.'' Toronto, ON: University of Toronto Press, 1999. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1881 to 1883, it was recorded that buffalo and buffalo herds were headed towards Fort Walsh. Upon hearing this, Dewdney ordered that the food rations for Fort Walsh be reduced. [[North-West Mounted Police|The Northwest Mounted Police]](NWMP) began preparation to abandon their post at the fort, which meant Indigenous peoples could only receive their treaty payments and other assistance if or when they signed the treaty and moved north. Dewdney's refusal to allow the supply of relief to Indigenous communities created a volatile environment.&lt;ref&gt;Hogue, Michel. ''Metis and the Medicine Line: Creating a Border and Dividing a People.'' North Carolina, USA: University of North Carolina Press. 2015. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1882, reports from Augustus Jukes, senior surgeon for the NWMP, regarding the limited food and lack of shelter did not have an effect on Dewdney. As a result, Fort Walsh closed in 1882 which left many Indigenous people starved, unless they signed Treaty One or Treaty Two.&lt;ref name="Carter, Sarah 1900"/&gt; Dewdney said that he would recognize any male Cree as a chief if he could get the support of one hundred or more men to accept him as a leader. As a result, many Metis, Cree and Assiniboine separated from their bands in order to receive the promised rations from the government.&lt;ref name="Carter, Sarah 1900"/&gt;

In 1882, it was reported that Cree and Assiniboine that settled in Cyprus Hill were supplied with minimal food rations. As a result, many Cree and Assiniboine began travelling to Indian Head. However, many died along the journey as a result of starvation. The reserve in Indian Head was called Win-cha-pa-ghen, or Skull Mountainettes, because the mountains were covered with the victims of the starvation crisis who received little aid from the government of Canada.&lt;ref name="Carter, Sarah 1900"/&gt; In the spring, many made the journey back to Cyprus Hill, where Augustus Juke reported that many of the Cree and Assiniboine were in a state of starvation and did not have the basic necessities of life. This was the direct result of the Indian Commissioner’s insistence on letting them starve unless they complied with the government's request for them to sign treaties.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Sarah. ''Aboriginal People and Colonizers of Western Canada to 1900.'' Toronto, ON: University of Toronto Press, 1999. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Dewdney was quoted saying “the longer they continue to act against the wishes of the Government, the more wretched will they become.”&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Sarah. ''Aboriginal People and Colonizers of Western Canada to 1900.'' Toronto, ON: University of Toronto Press, 1999. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884, tensions between Louis Riel and the government were rising. Charles Borromée, the Justice of the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories and legal advisor in the North-West Territories, sent a letter to Edgar Dewdney on September 5, 1884 regarding the conditions of Indigenous communities during the North-West Rebellion. Borromée wrote “Riel can harm the country, and that the government must come to the assistance of the Indians or misery and starvation will result.” Dewdney ultimately ignored this information, allowing the half breed (Metis) to starve.&lt;ref&gt;Rouleau Borromee, Charles. Charles Borromee to Edgar Dewdney, September 5, 1884. Held at Glenbow Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, Dewdney described the state’s initiatives to provide rations to Indigenous communities as a “policy of reward and punishment,” implying that only bands deemed as “loyal” would receive rations, livestock, and other farming equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Daschuk, James. ''Clearing the Plains: Disease, Politics of Starvation, and the Loss of Aboriginal''

''Life''. Regina, SK: University of Regina Press, 2013. 159&lt;/ref&gt; To help promote an agricultural society within Indigenous communities, treaties stipulated that farming supplies would be made available as well as livestock. Dewdney believed that one of the reasons Indigenous people could not become self supporting was due to the treaties failing to provide grist mills for grain farming.&lt;ref&gt;McQuillan, D. Aidan. “Creation of indian Reserves on the Canadian Prairies 1870-1885.” ''Geographical Review'' 70, no. 4 (1980): 391.&lt;/ref&gt; Dewdney, as Indian Commissioner, noted that there were insufficient resources and supplies despite the terms of the treaties. The government of Canada promoted self sufficiency in agriculture by Indigenous peoples as a way to offset the cost of famine relief from the government. However, the supplies that would help Indigenous peoples on reserves to create an agricultural based community were lacking. The lack of supplies from the government frustrated many.&lt;ref&gt;McQuillan, D. Aidan. “Creation of indian Reserves on the Canadian Prairies 1870-1885.”

''Geographical Review'' 70, no. 4 (1980): 389-390&lt;/ref&gt;  The starvation crisis would symbolize the defining issue during Edgar Dewdney’s tenure as Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories. The Crisis regarding the starvation of the natives is still seen as a major political and humanitarian crisis.

==The Northwest Rebellion of 1885==

The [[North-West Rebellion]] of 1885 was an uprising led by the Metis and other Indigenous peoples of the [[North-West Territories]] against the Canadian government. The Metis felt threatened by the continuous buying and selling of land by the Canadian government. There was the question of whether the Metis would receive the land that they were entitled to, while the government continued to give more land to settlers. This, in conjunction with the decline in buffalo in the region and the lack of government relief, resulted in the North-West rebellion. The North-West Rebellion began as a peaceful protest by the Metis against the lack of government relief. The reinforcement of the [[North-West Mounted Police]] to the area was seen as a threat to the Metis, and helped to jumpstart violence between the Metis and the government. The violent altercation lasted for five months, with the eventual defeat of the Metis rebels by federal enforcers.&lt;ref&gt;Friesen, Gerald. ''The Canadian Prairies: A History.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1987. 220-227.&lt;/ref&gt;

Edgar Dewdney was the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories during the Riel-led rebellion of 1885. It is clear that there were many issues in the North-West region prior to the outbreak of the Metis rebellion. The North-West Mounted Police Superintendent [[L.N.F. Crozier]] acted as an informant for Dewdney in the events leading up to the outbreak of the rebellion. With the information that he had gathered, Dewdney believed that he could maintain peace within the region and that he had control of the situation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Titley, Brian. ''The Frontier World of Edgar Dewdney''. Toronto, ON: UBC Press, 1999. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did not have faith in the ability of Indian agents across the region to maintain and control the unrest that was beginning to arise within Indigenous communities. As a result, Dewdney called for the appointment of a second roving inspector in 1885, as he believed that it would be difficult for one man to do the job effectively over a vast amount of territory, as well as the fact that the current roving inspector T.P. Wadsworth was reporting his findings to other officials behind Dewdney’s back.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Since his arrival in the North-West Territories, Dewdney supported the increase of rations for Indigenous communities and believed that it was crucial that the terms outlined in treaties were met in order to maintain peace between the Metis and colonial settlers.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, Brian. ''The Frontier World of Edgar Dewdney''. Toronto, ON: UBC Press, 1999. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Land ===
The issue regarding Metis land claims and entitlement had been a topic of discussion for many years prior to the outbreak of rebellion. Louis Riel’s return to Canada caught the attention of the Canadian government, which motivated the efforts of communities along the Saskatchewan River to advance political demands. The Federal Government was not willing to negotiate with the Metis on the matter. Metis leader, [[Louis Riel]] and the Metis forwarded their demands to Ottawa in 1884. Dewdney, as Lieutenant Governor, stated that the government would investigate the claims of those who did not receive land or script in Manitoba, but made no other promises.&lt;ref&gt;Hogue, Michel. ''Metis and the Medicine Line: Creating a Border and Dividing a People.'' North Carolina, USA: University of North Carolina Press. 2015. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; Riel wanted “land titles and government by the people” instead of Dewdney holding absolute power in the region.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Titley, Brian. ''The Frontier World of Edgar Dewdney''. Toronto, ON: UBC Press, 1999. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue had been brought up to Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald many times, but had always been pushed aside to prioritize other issues occurring within the dominion. Many settlers in the region were becoming anxious and feared the outbreak of a rebellion, so in February 1885, Dewdney urged the Prime Minister to respond to their demands from the Metis. This request was once again ignored. Later that month, officials in Saskatchewan began sending reports to Dewdney regarding Metis military action that had begun in the area. It had been reported that the Metis had obtained weapons and ammunition from colonial traders, which was considered illegal. This was alarming for Dewdney, who believed that action needed to be taken to control the Metis and suppress tensions. As a result, Dewdney prepared to send police to the area if conditions worsened.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, Brian. ''The Frontier World of Edgar Dewdney''. Toronto, ON: UBC Press, 1999. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; When Riel and his followers began to take prisoners and recruit support from individuals on nearby reserves, Dewdney allowed one hundred Mounted Police to intervene.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Dewdney was devoted to preventing other Indigenous peoples on reserves from joining Riel in the North-West Rebellion as an attempt to keep settlers in the area at ease. Land was prioritized by Riel and the Metis in order to secure their future prosperity and survival in the area. Their demands were not recognized by the government of Canada and prompted some Metis communities to prepare for military action.

=== Food and Rations ===
Land and food were important tools used by the government of Canada to control Indigenous peoples. Therefore, land and food were key motivators in the resistance. Prior to the outbreak of the rebellion, Dewdney was unwilling to provide large amounts of rations to Metis settlements unless they were in extreme desperation. This mindset changed during the rebellion, as Dewdney’s idea was to “tempt” Metis and other Indigenous peoples to remain on their reserve and remain devoted to the dominion by offering them more rations and goods.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Titley, Brian. ''The Frontier World of Edgar Dewdney''. Toronto, ON: UBC Press, 1999. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; When violence broke out between Riel and the government, Dewdney conducted a tour of reserves in the area, listening to the specific needs of the individuals living on the reserves in an attempt to keep them content. Dewdney offered them more rations of tobacco, bacon, flour, and tea. This was done to keep the Indigenous people on the reserve loyal to the state and separated from the rebellious Metis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Dewdney maintained this appeasement strategy throughout the rebellion. He emphasized the need to be loyal to the state throughout the rebellion. Dewdney suggested that rations and other goods should be withheld from “rebel Indians” after the North-West Rebellion had ended, until it was decided how justice could be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, Brian. ''The Frontier World of Edgar Dewdney''. Toronto, ON: UBC Press, 1999. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Dewdney believed that those who had been loyal to the state should be rewarded after the North-West Rebellion had ended. These individuals were awarded through the distribution of money and livestock.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, Brian. ''The Frontier World of Edgar Dewdney''. Toronto, ON: UBC Press, 1999. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

The North-West Rebellion can be linked to the starvation crisis, which is represented in the [[Frog Lake Massacre]]. The Frog Lake Massacre on April 2, 1885 was due to the restlessness of the Native people in the area of Frog Lake due to the lack of food and resources.&lt;ref&gt;Mulvany, Charles P. ''The History of the North-west rebellion of 1885.'' Toronto, ON: A. H. Hovey and CO., 1885. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Theresa Delaney, a settler who was held captive whose husband was shot in Frog Lake believed that Edgar Dewdney should be blamed as a cause for the massacre in that while visiting Frog Lake, Dewdney made many promises in regards to food and aid, but none of the promises were fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;Delany, Theresa, and Theresa Gowanlock. ''Two Months in the Camp of Big Bear.'' Regina, SK: Canadian Plains Research Centre, University of Regina, 1999. xxx.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the massacre cannot be directly linked to Dewdney’s unfulfilled promises to the Indigenous peoples of Frog Lake, it is clear that the lack of government intervention at a time of crisis worsened the conditions. Due to the lack of resources, aid, and food provided to those in the region, it is clear that the residents of Frog Lake were living in unjust circumstances. Additionally, Dewdney acted as a mediator between the government and the Indigenous peoples of Frog Lake.

=== Result of the Rebellion ===
The North-West Rebellion eventually ended on June 3, 1885 with subsequent consequences and as well as solutions to ensure there would be no repetition of violence. After the North-West Rebellion had ended, Dewdney took actions to improve the level of security on reserves. This was done to prevent another rebellion of the same nature from occurring in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, Brian. ''The Frontier World of Edgar Dewdney''. Toronto, ON: UBC Press, 1999. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Dewdney believed that all of those who were involved in the North-West Rebellion should be sentenced accordingly. He supported heavy jail sentences for the perpetrators and believed that many executions needed to be carried out in order to make a statement, including the execution of Louis Riel.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, Brian. ''The Frontier World of Edgar Dewdney''. Toronto, ON: UBC Press, 1999. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Dewdney believed that the future of Indigenous communities lay in the younger generation. He feared Indigenous children and the power that they held. This was one of the arguments that justified his support the closing of day schools and the creation of [[Indian residential schools]] in order to fully transform Indigenous children into model citizens. He believed that children needed to be removed from the influence of their Indigenous parents and communities. This needed to be done in order to maintain control and ensure that another rebellion of similar nature did not occur.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, Brian. ''The Frontier World of Edgar Dewdney''. Toronto, ON: UBC Press, 1999. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of the North-West Rebellion caused the government of Canada to impose other regulations on the lives of individuals, such as Indian residential schools. The intended purpose of Indian residential schools were to isolate Indigenous children from the influences of their family in order to effectively assimilate them into Euro- Canadian society. These schools operated within Canada until 1996. They were opened and funded by the Canadian government and were operated by the Catholic church. At these schools, Indigenous children faced extreme physical, emotional, and sexual abuse as an assimilation tactic. The traumatization that Indigenous children faced at these schools has been passed down through generations and continues to have an extremely negative effect on Indigenous communities in the twenty-first century.

Dewdney had the prenominal "the Honourable" and the postnominal "PC" for life by virtue of being made a member of the [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada]] on September 25, 1888.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/default.asp?Language=E&amp;Page=informationresources&amp;Sub=PrivyCouncilMembers&amp;doc=PCMembersHistList-A-E_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indigenous Relations ==
Settler expansion westward further strained Indigenous and Crown relations. Metis and Indigenous peoples were affected by the increase in westward expansion and the methods of land settlement imposed by the government in Qu’Appelle and Saskatchewan. The Metis distrusted Dewdney due to his control over the land in question for settlement. New settlers arriving in the region began to push Metis out of Manitoba.&lt;ref&gt;Mulvany, Charles P. ''The History of the North-west rebellion of 1885.'' Toronto, ON: A. H. Hovey and CO., 1885. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The uncertainty regarding the fate of the Metis in Manitoba in regards to settler migration became a reality. Surveying of Metis land for the new settlers created new tensions, which Dewdney failed to acknowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Janigan, Mary. ''Let the Eastern Bastards Freeze in the Dark: The West Versus the Rest Since Confederation''. Toronto, ON: Alfred A. Knopf Canada 2012. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; There are some instances of Dewdney mediating territorial disputes as Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs, and while travelling the areas affected by the starvation crisis in 1879. He noted in the Royal Commission that the Sacree nation was in dispute with the Blackfeet over flour rations. The Sacree were forced to travel to Fort MacLeod in order to avoid further trauma caused by starvation, but voiced concern over the area also being inhabited by the Blackfeet. Dewdney ended the dispute and the Sacree agreed to move to Fort MacLeod.&lt;ref&gt;Canada. Royal Commission to Inquire Into Changes Affecting the Administration of Justice in the North-West Territories. ''Report of the Royal Commission to Inquire Into Changes Affecting the Administration of Justice in the North-West Territories.'' Ottawa: Indian Affairs, 1880. 80-81.&lt;/ref&gt; Dewdney was involved in mediating the territorial disputes between the Metis and settlers when tensions were heightened.

The early 1880s saw raids led by Indigenous bands to steal cattle and horses from ranchers. This is directly linked to the loss of buffalo in the area and the subsequent starvation crisis. These raids occurred across into the United States and created American tensions. As a Result, Dewdney created a permit system in 1882 so that groups such as the Blackfeet and Assiniboine could move across the border to hunt, visit relatives, and for leisure.&lt;ref&gt;Hogue, Michel. “Disputing the Medicine Line: The Plains Crees and the Canadian-American Border, 1876- 1885.” ''Montana: The Magazine of Western History'' 52, no. 4 (2002). 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Dewdney supported and defended the allegations against Canadian Indigenous peoples as being held responsible for the depredations in Northern Montana.&lt;ref&gt;Hogue, Michel. “Disputing the Medicine Line: The Plains Crees and the Canadian-American Border, 1876- 1885.” ''Montana: The Magazine of Western History'' 52, no. 4 (2002). 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Rancher anxieties and prompts from Americans due to raids by Indigenous peoples pushed Dewdney to move Indigenous bands “from the southern prairies of Assiniboia to reserves north of the Canadian Pacific Railroad.” This plan disrupted bands searching and following remaining buffalo across the international boundary. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police were instructed to use force when faced with bands attempting to move north.&lt;ref name="McQuillan, D. Aidan 1885"&gt;McQuillan, D. Aidan. “Creation of indian Reserves on the Canadian Prairies 1870-1885.” 385.&lt;/ref&gt; Dewdney triumphantly claimed that there were no more natives north of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) line.&lt;ref name="McQuillan, D. Aidan 1885"/&gt; As a result, the development of the CPR could continue further west by the instruction of Dewdney.

Concerning governance, Dewdney advocated for the enforcement of the Indian Act to dispose Indian chiefs. This would help the colonial government maintain power in local communities by removing Indigenous leadership and eradicating self-governance. As a result of this enforcement, arrests were made against those who were viewed as ‘bad Indians.’&lt;ref&gt;Monaghan, Jeffrey. “Settler Governmentality and Racializing Surveillance in Canada's North-West.” '' The Canadian Journal of Sociology'' 38, no. 4 (2013). 502.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of language such as ‘bad Indians’ left for interpretation that any Metis or Indigenous person that rejected government policy was atrocious. Additionally, Dewdney mediated territorial disputes as Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs while traveling areas affected by colonial expansion as well as food and land disputes.

== Criticism ==
Dewdney has been criticized for using the courts as an extension of administering his own concept of justice (Gavigan, p.&amp;nbsp;38). He reportedly withheld rations from the Cree until he realized that it created more violence among them (Gavigan, p.&amp;nbsp;36).

Dewdney was known for making many promises to the Indigenous peoples which raised their moral, but ultimately leaving these promises unfulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;Delany, Theresa, and Theresa Gowanlock. ''Two Months in the Camp of Big Bear.'' Regina, SK:

Canadian Plains Research Centre, University of Regina, 1999. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the North-West Rebellion, Dewdney was Indian Commissioner as well as Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories. This gave him a great deal of power and influence in the area and created criticism towards him, as many believe that he was able to abuse this power to ultimately achieve his goals.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, Brian. ''The Frontier World of Edgar Dewdney''. Toronto, ON: UBC Press, 1999. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Dewdney was criticized for not responding to requests for food relief made to the government by Metis, Assiniboine and Cree in the winter of 1882 to 1983. The lack of a response from Dewdney in regard to official requests for food supplies to Indigenous communities can be seen as a tactic used in order to push Indigenous peoples onto reserves.

Additionally, there was concern that the Department of Indian Affairs, its agents, and Dewdney had secretly been in contact with Montana grocery and mercantile firm [[I.G. Baker Company]]. The worry was that the Department had purchased subpar goods to distribute to the Metis who were affected by the starvation crisis. It was claimed by the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] That Dewdney and other key officials in the North-West and Ottawa were linked with the company and therefore profiting off of the starvation crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Daschuk, James. ''Clearing the Plains: Disease, Politics of Starvation, and the Loss of Aboriginal Life''. Regina, SK: University of Regina Press, 2013. 137-138.&lt;/ref&gt; Dewdney's relationship with the Baker Co. relates back to before his appointment as Indian Commissioner. Dewdney was known to involve himself in various business ventures and investments in the North-West that resulted in his personal financial gain.&lt;ref name="Daschuk, James 2013"&gt;Daschuk, James. ''Clearing the Plains: Disease, Politics of Starvation, and the Loss of Aboriginal Life''. Regina, SK: University of Regina Press, 2013. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Flour supplied to Indigenous communities by the Baker Company was unfit for consumption and caused deaths in several reserves. Additionally, there was the belief that the food had been tampered with which created a formal independent investigation into the Baker Company’s flour supply.&lt;ref&gt;Daschuk, James. ''Clearing the Plains: Disease, Politics of Starvation, and the Loss of Aboriginal Life''. Regina, SK: University of Regina Press, 2013. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; It was determined that the flour was indeed substandard, which reflected negatively on Dewdney given his relationship with the Company.

Furthermore, there are also reports that Dewdney and other agents from the Department of Indian Affairs used food as a tool for coercion. Many Indigenous people on reserves were at the mercy of these agents.&lt;ref name="Daschuk, James 2013"/&gt;

== Life After the Rebellion ==
It is important to note that Dewdney never truly liked living in the North-West Territories, as he saw the land as bleak and lifeless. He also disliked the harsh climate of the North-West Territories, as it could become intolerable at times. Dewdney suffered from extreme back pain, preventing him from traveling on horseback and camping between reserves. Dewdney’s wife Jane also expressed a longing to return to life in British Columbia, as it was filled with excitement and adventure.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, Brian. ''The Frontier World of Edgar Dewdney''. Toronto, ON: UBC Press, 1999. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; After the North-West Rebellion, Dewdney requested political appointments outside of the North-West. On September 12, 1888, he was named Minister of the Interior as well as superintendent general of Indian Affairs.&lt;ref name="E. Brian Titley 2003"&gt;E. Brian Titley. “Dewdney, Edgar” in ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'', vol. 14. (University of Toronto/Université Laval: 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Dewdney was appointed as Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia on November 2, 1892 and retired December 1, 1897. After his retirement from politics, Dewdney focused on business ventures. Throughout his life, Dewdney managed his personal finances poorly, resulting in his lack of pension to support him in his later life. Subsequently, he also focused on surveying projects for proposed railways in British Columbia.&lt;ref name="E. Brian Titley 2003"/&gt; His wife Jane died in January 1909, which prompted his second marriage to Blanche Elizabeth Plantagenet Kemeys-Tynte in 1909. Money continued to be an issue for Dewdney up until his death. He attempted to receive a senate appointment as well as an appeal to receive a pension to aid him in his old age. He never received a senate appointment or a pension.&lt;ref name="E. Brian Titley 2003"/&gt;  Edgar Dewdney died on August 8, 1916 in Victoria, British Columbia at the age of eighty.

==Legacy==
*A major east-west street in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], Dewdney Avenue, is named after him; [[Government House (Saskatchewan)|Government House]], the original Territorial government building and the local detachment of the RCMP (formerly its headquarters before these were transferred to Ottawa) and national training centre are on Dewdney Avenue.
*[[Dewdney, British Columbia]] is the name of a locality immediately east of [[Mission, British Columbia]], located below the 920&amp;nbsp;m Dewdney Peak on the north shore of the [[Fraser River]].  The community was the namesake of the former [[Dewdney (electoral district)|Dewdney provincial electoral district]] and also of the now-dismantled [[Dewdney-Alouette Regional District]]
*The [[Dewdney Trunk Road]] was one of the earliest main roads in the [[Fraser Valley|Lower Fraser Valley]] of British Columbia, running from [[Port Moody, British Columbia|Port Moody]] to the community of Dewdney.  Today it exists in sections in [[Coquitlam]] and [[Port Coquitlam]] is a major thoroughfare running between [[Maple Ridge, British Columbia|Maple Ridge]] and Mission (where it is now officially Dewdney Trunk Road) &lt;!--I think -?- --&gt;, today ending short of Dewdney at [[Hatzic, British Columbia|Hatzic]].
*The [[Last Mountain Lake Bird Sanctuary]] in Saskatchewan, established in 1887 upon Dewdney's recommendation and the first [[wildlife reserve]] of its type on the continent, was designated a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{CRHP|13003|Last Mountain Lake Bird Sanctuary|18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elaine of [[Corbenic]]''' (also known as Amite, Heliaebel, Helaine, Perevida or Helizabel; identified as "The Grail Maiden" or "Grail Bearer"),&lt;ref name="timelessmyths"&gt;''Arthurian Women.'' www.timelessmyths.com. Jimmy Joe, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; is a character in the [[Arthurian legend]]. She is the daughter of [[Fisher King|King Pelles]] and the mother of Sir [[Galahad]] by Sir [[Lancelot]]. She first appears in The Prose Lancelot (the [[Vulgate Cycle]]),&lt;ref name="timelessmyths"/&gt; but fully emerges as a character in Sir [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Malory, Sir Thomas. ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Her first significant action is showing the [[Holy Grail]] to Sir Lancelot.

==In Malory==
Elaine's father, [[King Pelles]], knew that [[Sir Lancelot]] would have a son with Elaine, and that that child would be [[Sir Galahad]], described as "the most noblest [sic] knight in the world".&lt;ref name="Malory, p.288"&gt;Malory, p.288.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, King Pelles claims that Galahad will lead a "foreign country...out of danger" and "achieve...the [[Holy Grail]]".&lt;ref name="Malory, p.283"/&gt; The source of King Pelles' knowledge is undisclosed.

She is described as "passing fair and young".&lt;ref name="Malory, p.283"&gt;Malory, p.283.&lt;/ref&gt; The sorceress [[Morgan le Fay]] is jealous of Elaine's beauty, and magically traps her in a boiling bath. After Sir Lancelot rescues her, Elaine falls in love with him, only to find he is already in love with [[Queen Guinevere]] and would not knowingly sleep with another woman. In order to seduce Lancelot, Elaine goes to the sorceress Dame Brusen for help. Dame Brusen gives Lancelot wine and Elaine a ring of Guinevere's in order to trick Lancelot into thinking Elaine is Guinevere.&lt;ref&gt;Malory, p.283-284.&lt;/ref&gt; The next morning, Lancelot is most displeased to discover that the woman he slept with was not Guinevere. He draws his sword and threatens to kill Elaine, but she tells him that she is pregnant with Galahad and he agrees not to kill her, but instead kisses her.&lt;ref&gt;Malory, p.285.&lt;/ref&gt; Lancelot departs, and Elaine remains in her father's castle and gives birth to Galahad.

Thereafter, there is a feast at [[King Arthur]]'s court, and Elaine goes to it. Lancelot ignores her when he sees her, and she is sad because she loves him. She complains of this to Dame Brusen, and Dame Brusen tells her that she will "undertake that this night he [Lancelot] shall lie with [her]".&lt;ref&gt;Malory, p.286.&lt;/ref&gt; That night, Dame Brusen brings Lancelot to Elaine, pretending that it is Guinevere that summons him. He goes along, and once again sleeps with Elaine. At the same time, however, Guinevere herself actually summons Lancelot, and is enraged to discover that he is not in his bedchamber.&lt;ref&gt;Malory, p.287.&lt;/ref&gt; She hears him talking in his sleep, and finds him in bed with Elaine. She is furious with him and tells him she never wants to see him again. Lancelot goes mad with grief and, naked, jumps out a window and runs away.&lt;ref name="Malory, p.288"/&gt;

Elaine confronts Guinevere as to her treatment of Lancelot. She accuses Guinevere of causing Lancelot’s madness and tells her that she is being unnecessarily cruel. After this, she leaves court. Time passes in the story, and Elaine next appears when she finds Lancelot insane in her garden.&lt;ref&gt;Malory, p.297.&lt;/ref&gt; She brings him to the Holy Grail, which cures him. When he regains his mental facilities, he decides to live with Elaine, and they live together for several years as man and wife.&lt;ref&gt;Malory, p.299.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
Elaine of Carbonek (or Corbenic, Corbin, etc.) is often passed over in favor of [[Elaine of Astolat]]. Like the more famous Elaine, Elaine of Carbonek is in love with Lancelot. Yet unlike Astolat, Carbonek is successful in both bedding and marrying Lancelot. Despite this, she has been overlooked by most literary analysts. One theory for why she has been so ignored is because of the moral ambiguities of her actions.&lt;ref&gt;Sklar, Elizabeth S. "Malory’s Other(ed) Elaine". ''On Arthurian Women: Essays in Memory of Maureen Fries''. Bonnie Wheeler and Fiona Tolhurst. Dallas: Scriptorium Press, 2001. pp.59-70.&lt;/ref&gt; She does not fit into a neat category of female characters; she is neither good nor evil, but something in between. [[Roger Sherman Loomis]]'s work ''The Grail: From Celtic Symbol to Christian Myth'' draws a connection between the concept of the feminine "Grail-bearer" and the [[sovereignty goddess]] of Ireland, [[Ériu]], who grants the chalice to only the worthy.

==In modern stories==
Elaine appears in the 1939 novel ''[[The Once and Future King]]'', by [[T.H. White]]. Although the basic character does not change, there are several key differences. Time is more definitely specified in this version; for instance, when Elaine finds Lancelot in the garden, Galahad is three years old. Additionally, Elaine and Lancelot live together as husband and wife for ten years and actively raise Galahad while Lancelot bears a pseudonym to hide from the court at Camelot.&lt;ref name="White"&gt;White, Terence Hanbury. ''The Once and Future King''. New York: G.P. Putnam’s Sons, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; Another key difference between White and Malory is that in White, Lancelot is cured of his insanity by seeing Elaine, but becomes physically sick and is nursed back to health by Elaine. White also chronicles Elaine's final fate, having her commit [[suicide]] when it becomes clear that Lancelot will never truly love her or end his obsession with Guinevere. This creates a parallel with the character of Elaine of Astolat, who is also referenced in the novel.&lt;ref name="White"/&gt;

A more contemporary novel is ''Elaine of Corbenic'' by Tima Z. Newman.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Tima Z. ''Elaine of Corbenic''. Honolulu: Savant Books, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on Malory's account of the three brief encounters of Launcelot and Elaine in ''Le Morte d’Arthur'', it chronicles Elaine’s journey through abandonment to the finding of inner strength and deepening wisdom.

Elaine also appears as a character in ''[[The Mists of Avalon]]'' by [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]. In this version, she tricks Lancelot with the help of Morgaine into sleeping with her by making him believe she was Gwenhwyfar. Her father finds out and forces Lancelot to marry her to keep her honor. She and Lancelot, in addition to their son Galahad, have two daughters by the names of Gwenhwyfar and Nimue, who later becomes a priestess of Avalon and is used to trick the Merlin Kevin into coming with her to the isle to receive punishment for perceived crimes against the Goddess and later drowns herself. Unlike the Elaines in earlier stories, she dies of natural causes later in the book.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2639">'''George Robert Fitzgerald''', aka '''Fighting Fitzgerald''', [[Irish people|Irish]] [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]], died 1786.

FitzGerald came from Turlough, near [[Castlebar]]. He was of an upper-class family, nephew of the Earl of Bristol, Bishop of Derry, and was educated at Eton. A highly eccentric character, he is said to have become so after a blow to the head sometime in his 20s.  Most of his life was spent on his paternal estate in Mayo. There he hunted by torchlight, terrified his friends by keeping bears and other ferocious animals as pets, erected a fort and set the law at defiance. He even held his father to ransom for a sum of £3,000. In 1770 he married Jane, daughter of [[William James Conolly]], but the marriage effectively ended as soon as he had spent her [[dowry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Compendium of Irish Biography | year=1878 | location=Dublin}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He fought many duels, including one with [[Richard Martin (Irish politician)|Richard Martin]] in the barrack's yard of Castlebar, in which both were wounded. Another, with a Mr. French, occurred in Castlebar. French was accused of rustling cattle from Fitzgerald's father; the duel "is said to have started near the bridge at the bottom of Main Street and proceeded with the contestants jumping from one side of the street to the other, smashing traders' stalls in the process. The duel ended on Ellison Street and there appears to have been no serious injury to the pair."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fighting Fitz and French in Main Street showdown|url=http://www.connaughttelegraph.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=479:fighting-fitz-and-french-in-main-street-showdown-&amp;catid=46:auld-stock&amp;Itemid=76|accessdate=5 August 2016|work=Connaught Telegraph|date=27 April 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307003354/http://www.connaughttelegraph.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=479%3Afighting-fitz-and-french-in-main-street-showdown-&amp;catid=46%3Aauld-stock&amp;Itemid=76|archivedate=7 March 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FitzGerald was hanged for murder in 1786 along with his law agent, [[Timothy Brecknock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=My Life in Connaught | publisher=Elliott Stock | author=Armstrong, Thomas | year=1892 | location=London | pages=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Göran Gentele''' (29 September 1917 &amp;ndash; 18 July 1972) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[actor]], [[Film director|director]], and [[opera]] manager. He was briefly the general manager of the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York City in 1972.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=New Manager for the Met |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904611,00.html |quote=Rudolf Bing last week introduced the man who will succeed him two seasons hence as general manager of Manhattan's Metropolitan Opera.

==Biography==
Born in [[Stockholm]], Gentele studied from 1944 until 1946 at the ''[[Dramatens elevskola]]'', beginning a brief career as a [[film]] [[actor]] not long afterwards.  He soon turned to directing, working for a time at the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]] and then at the [[Royal Swedish Opera]], where his more notable productions included [[Gian Carlo Menotti]]'s ''[[The Consul]]'' and [[Karl-Birger Blomdahl]]'s ''[[Aniara (opera)|Aniara]]''.  He became director of the company in 1963.

He also directed films during approximately the same period (1947 to 1969), making at least 15 feature films and television movies. His 1951 film ''[[Leva på 'Hoppet']]'' was awarded the Silver Bear for comedy at the [[1st Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;IMDB: [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0313022/?ref_=nmbio_bio_nm Filmography], Accessed April 29, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

He succeeded Sir [[Rudolf Bing]] as director of the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in [[New York City]] in 1972.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;  Soon after assuming the post, on 18 July 1972, Gentele died in an [[car crash|automobile accident]] while on vacation in [[Sardinia]]; he was killed along with two of his daughters when the car in which they were riding [[head-on collision|collided head-on]] with a truck.  A third daughter was injured, as was Gentele's wife, Marit.  [[Schuyler Chapin]], Gentele's assistant, was named acting director almost at once.

==Legacy==
Despite the fact that he had been in office only a few weeks at his death, several of Gentele's plans for the company were implemented under Chapin.  The most notable of these was a new production of [[Georges Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]'' designed for [[Marilyn Horne]]; this was used to open the 1972-1973 season. Gentele was the second general director of the Metropolitan, behind [[Herbert Witherspoon]], to die before the opening night of his first season with the company.

==Awards==
Gentele won the [[Silver Bear|Silver Bear (Comedies)]] award at the [[1st Berlin International Film Festival]] for his film ''[[Leva på 'Hoppet']]''.&lt;ref name="Berlinale 1951"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1951/03_preistr_ger_1951/03_Preistraeger_1951.html |title=1st Berlin International Film Festival: Prize Winners |accessdate=2009-12-20 |work=berlinale.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Haile Selassie Gugsa''' (1907–1985)&lt;ref name="Royal Ark"/&gt; was an [[Army of the Ethiopian Empire|army commander]] and a member of the [[Imperial family]] of the [[Ethiopian Empire]].

== Biography ==
Haile Selassie Gugsa was the son of [[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles|''Leul'']]{{#tag:ref|Roughly equivalent to Prince.|group=nb}} [[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles|''Ras'']]{{#tag:ref|Roughly equivalent to [[Duke]].|group=nb}} [[Gugsa Araya Selassie]]. Gugsa Araya Selassie was the [[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles|''Shum'']]{{#tag:ref|Roughly equivalent to Governor.|group=nb}} of eastern [[Tigray Province]] as well as the great grandson of Emperor [[Yohannes IV of Ethiopia|Yohannes IV]].

===''Shum'' of eastern Tigray===
In April 1932, Gugsa Araya Selassie died and Haile Selassie Gugsa replaced him as ''Shum'' of eastern Tigray with the title of ''Dejazmatch''.

On 15 June 1932,&lt;ref name="Royal Ark"/&gt; ''Dejazmatch'' Haile Selassie Gugsa married ''[[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles|Leult]]''{{#tag:ref|Roughly equivalent to Princess.|group=nb}} [[Princess Zenebework|Zenebework Haile Selassie]], Haile Selassie's second daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Mockler, ''Haile Sellassie's War'', p. 391&lt;/ref&gt; He was about 25 years old and she was not quite 14 years old.  ''Leult'' Zenebework died in 1934 amid allegations of poor treatment at the hands of her husband.  Relations between Emperor Haile Selassie and ''Dejazmatch'' Haile Selassie Gugsa became quite cold after this.  The strain between them was especially apparent when the Emperor insisted on bringing his daughter's body back to [[Addis Ababa]] for burial rather than allowing her husband to bury her in the capital of eastern Tigray, [[Mek'ele]].  This was a clear sign of Emperor Haile Selassie's unhappiness with his son-in-law.  ''Dejazmach'' Haile Selassie on his part was very bitter that he was not elevated to the titles of ''Leul'' and ''Ras'' which had been held by his father before him, and were held by his rival Seyum Mengesha of western Tigray.

At the same time as the marriage of Haile Selassie Gugsa to Zenebework Haile Selassie, [[Crown Prince]] [[Amha Selassie of Ethiopia|Asfaw Wossen]] married ''Leult'' [[Wolete Israel Seyoum|Wolete Israel Seyum]], the daughter of ''Ras'' [[Seyum Mangasha]] of western Tigray Province.  He was 16 years old and she was about 26 years old.   The two marriages were meant to cement ties between the reigning [[Shewa|Shoa]] branch of the [[Solomonic dynasty|Imperial Ethiopian dynasty]] with both rival sides of the [[Tigray-Tigrinya people|Tigrean]] branch of the dynasty.  The death of Princess Zenebework and the chill in relations between Haile Selassie Gugsa and Emperor Haile Selassie signalled the failure of this policy at least with the Eastern Tigrean branch of the dynasty.

===Italo-Ethiopian War===
On 3 October 1935, as ''[[Dejazmatch]]'',{{#tag:ref|Roughly equivalent to Commander of the Gate.|group=nb}} Haile Selassie Gugsa was the commander in the Mek'ele sector when the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Italians invaded Ethiopia]].  As the [[De Bono's invasion of Abyssinia|Italians advanced]], Emperor Haile Selassie ordered  ''Ras'' Seyum Mangasha, the Commander of the Ethiopian [[Tigray Province|Army of Tigre]], to withdraw a day's march away from the [[Mareb River]].  Later, the Emperor ordered ''Ras'' Seyum to move back fifty-five miles from the border.  ''Dejazmach'' Haile Selassie Gugsa, who was also in the area, was ordered to move back thirty-five miles.  This was to demonstrate to the [[League of Nations]] that Italy was clearly the aggressor.

====Betrayal====
On 10 October, Haile Selassie Gugsa went over to the advancing Italians and announced his submission to Italian rule.  The Italians immediately released photographs of Haile Selassie Gugsa participating in war councils with the Italian commander on the northern front, General de Bono.  Furious Tigrean patriots in Mek'ele promptly set fire to ''Dejazmach'' Haile Selassie Gugsa's home in the town. On 8 November, Mek'ele fell.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolle, David, ''The Italian Invasion of Abyssinia 1935–1936'', p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources indicate that Haile Selassie Gugsa and his forces played an active part in aiding the Italian invasion.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, ''Gugsa Makes Good''&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources indicate his men were soon disarmed.  Either way, Haile Selassie Gugsa remained loyal to the Italians who, at a minimum, used him for propaganda purposes during the balance of the invasion and during the [[Italian East Africa|five years of occupation]].  He was honoured by the Italians with the title of ''Ras'' which had been denied him by Emperor Haile Selassie, as well as an Italian pension, and recognition as the senior Tigrean prince over his rival Seyoum Mengesha.

===Italian East Africa===
In May 1938, Haile Selassie Gugsa was in [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] to welcome [[Nazi Germany|German]] dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] when the Nazi leader paid a state visit to King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]].  Hitler was visiting at the invitiation of the Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] in Rome. Haile Selassie Gugsa watched as Mussolini's son, [[Bruno Mussolini|Bruno]], led a squadron of twenty-eight bombers that sank two 23,000-ton empty freighters in the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;''Time'' magazine, ''Germany/Italy:  $20,000,000 Visit''&lt;/ref&gt;

By 27 September 1939, during the [[Meskel|Feast of Maskal]] in Addis Ababa, ''Ras'' Haile Selassie Gugsa, ''Ras'' [[Hailu Tekle Haymanot]], and ''Ras'' Seyum Mangasha sat with [[Amedeo, 3rd Duke of Aosta]], the Viceroy and Governor General of [[Italian East Africa]] (''Africa Orientale Italiana'', or AOI).&lt;ref&gt;Mockler, ''Haile Sellassie's War'', p. xxxiv&lt;/ref&gt; All three Ethiopian leaders had submitted to Italian control of what had been their homeland and what was now the AOI colony.

===Liberation of Ethiopia===
In 1941, towards the end of the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|liberation of Italian East Africa]] by British, [[Commonwealth]], and Ethiopian ''[[Patriotism|Arbegnoch]]''{{#tag:ref|Equivalent to Ethiopian patriot.|group=nb}} forces, Haile Selassie Gugsa was temporarily placed in power in Tigray by the British.  British [[Brigadier]] [[Maurice Stanley Lush]], Deputy Chief Political Officer for Ethiopia, placed him back in command of eastern Tigray Province, with the intention of separating Tigray from Ethiopia, joining it to Eritrea and establishing a new "Greater Tigray/Tigrign" monarchy under either Haile Selassie Gugsa or Ras Seyum Mangasha.  This plan had the support of many British colonial officers, but not of the British High Command nor of the British government, and Ras Seyum proved to be cold towards any plan of dismembering the Ethiopian Empire.  The Lush group had hoped that Haile Selassie Gugsa would be more accommodating.  However, Haile Selassie Gugsa was soon caught corresponding with the Italians.  As a result, the British took him into custody and kept him first in British held [[Asmara]].  The government of Emperor Haile Selassie I approached the British administration and listed the crimes and treason of Haile Selassie Gugsa and requested his extradition.  The British indicated that they would extradite him only after obtaining a promise that his punishment would not include death.  However, the British ultimately removed Haile Selassie Gugsa from Asmara and sent him to the [[Seychelles]] for safe keeping.&lt;ref name=HS-174&gt;Haile Selassie I, Volume II, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

====Life sentence====
In 1946, after continued requests for extradition, Haile Selassie Gugsa was returned to the Ethiopians. In 1947, he stood trial and was declared a fascist collaborator and a traitor.  Haile Selassie Gugsa then threw himself on the mercy of the Emperor.  As a result, his death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.  He was placed under house arrest at [[Gore, Ethiopia|Gore]], and later at Ambo for twenty-eight years.&lt;ref name=HS-174/&gt; His Italian-supplied honorific title of ''Ras'' was not recognised and he reverted to his old title of ''Dejazmach''.

In 1947, eastern Tigray was incorporated into western Tigray and was governed by ''Ras'' Seyum Mangasha as hereditary prince of all Tigray. ''Dejazmach'' Haile Selassie Gugsa and his side of the family of Emperor Yohannes IV fell from grace.  They no longer enjoy favour either from the Emperor in Addis Ababa or from ''Ras'' Seyum Mangasha in Tigray.

===The Derg and Death===
In 1974, the [[Derg]] toppled the [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopian monarchy]] and ''Dejazmach'' Haile Selassie Gugsa was freed.  However, even after he was released, the Derg continued to regard him as a fascist collaborator and as a traitor to his country.  Haile Selassie Gugsa remained under effective [[house arrest]] at [[Ambo, Ethiopia|Ambo]] in western Ethiopia from that point on although technically no longer a state prisoner.  Haile Selassie Gugsa died in early 1985.&lt;ref name=HS-174/&gt;

'''''Japanese woman''''' ({{lang-hu|Japán nő}}) is an 1871 painting by Hungarian artist [[Bertalan Székely]].&lt;ref name="mng.hu"&gt;Magyar Nemzeti Galéria" '''('''(hu)''')'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#x20;[http://www.mng.hu/kepkereso/oldal:2/596 Székely Bertalan, Japán nő]

==Description==
Oil on canvas, it is 169.5 x 121.5cm and is in the collection of the [[Hungarian National Museum]] in [[Budapest]].&lt;ref name="mng.hu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="europeana.eu"/&gt;

==Analysis==
Szekely a significant artist in 19th century [[Hungary]], also produced a remarkable work in this painting -- for the first time Hungarian art shows the impact of [[Japonism]]. Judging by her look and features, the model does not seem to be Japanese, but other items in the work testify to Japanese culture and spirit and give information about them. Szekely encountered Japanese original works and objects during the East Asia exhibition at the Hungarian National Museum in 1870, and the exhibition inspired him to create this picture the following year.&lt;ref name="europeana.eu"/&gt;

'''Jerry Clyde Rubin''' (July 14, 1938 – November 28, 1994) was an American social activist, anti-war leader, and [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] icon during the 1960s and 1970s. During the 1980s, he became a successful businessman.

==Early life and education==
Rubin was born in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], the son of a truck driver who later became a [[Teamsters]]' union official.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/30/obituaries/jerry-rubin-56-flashy-60-s-radical-dies-yippies-founder-and-chicago-7-defendant.html Jerry Rubin, 56, Flashy 60's Radical, Dies; 'Yippies' Founder and Chicago 7 Defendant] by Eric Pace in International New York Times, November 30, 1994. Accessed February 12, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubin attended Cincinnati's [[Walnut Hills High School (Cincinnati, Ohio)|Walnut Hills High School]], co-editing the school newspaper, ''The Chatterbox'' and graduating in 1956. While in high school Rubin began to write for ''[[The Cincinnati Post]]'', compiling sports scores from high school games. He attended [[Oberlin College]], and [[Hebrew University]] in [[Jerusalem]], and later went on to graduate from the [[University of Cincinnati]], receiving a degree in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finally, Jerry Rubin Trusts People Over 30, Especially Wife Mimi Leonard and His New Wall Street Pals|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20078011,00.html|publisher=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=December 1, 1980|accessdate=November 28, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204174024/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20078011,00.html|archivedate=December 4, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rubin attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1964 but dropped out to focus on [[social activism]].&lt;ref name="Pace"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/30/obituaries/jerry-rubin-56-flashy-60-s-radical-dies-yippies-founder-and-chicago-7-defendant.html |work=The New York Times |first=Eric |last=Pace |title=Jerry Rubin, 56, Flashy 60's Radical, Dies; 'Yippies' Founder and Chicago 7 Defendant |date=November 30, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubin's parents died within ten months of each other, leaving Rubin to take care of his younger brother, Gil, who was 13 at the time. Jerry wanted to teach Gil about the world and planned to take him to [[India]]. When relatives threatened to sue to obtain custody of Gil, Jerry decided to take his brother to [[Israel]] instead, settling in [[Tel Aviv]]. There, Rubin worked in a [[kibbutz]],&lt;ref name="Stanley"/&gt; and studied [[sociology]] while his brother, who had learned [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], decided to stay in Israel and moved permanently into a kibbutz. Before returning to social and political activism, Rubin made a visit to [[Havana]], to learn first-hand about the Cuban revolution.&lt;ref name="Stanley"/&gt;

==Social activism==
Rubin began to demonstrate on behalf of various left-wing causes after dropping out of Berkeley. Rubin also ran for [[Berkeley, California|mayor of Berkeley]], on a platform opposing the [[Vietnam War]], and supporting [[black power]] and the legalization of marijuana,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lee |first=Martin A. |authorlink=|author2=Bruce Shlain |title=Acid Dreams: The Complete Social, History of LSD: The CIA, the Sixties, and Beyond |publisher=Grove Press |year=1992 |location=New York |url=http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/acid_dreams.pdf |doi=|id=|isbn=0-8021-3062-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; receiving over 20% of the vote. Having been unsuccessful, Rubin turned all his attentions to political protest. His first protest was in Berkeley, protesting against the refusal of a local grocer to hire [[African Americans]]. Soon Rubin was leading protests of his own. Rubin organized the [[Vietnam Day Committee]], that led some of the first large numbered protests against the [[Vietnam War]]. He took part in planning the world's largest teach-in against the war, organized rallies and demonstrations that attempted to stop a train transporting troops to the Oakland Army Base, as well as trucks carrying [[napalm]].&lt;ref name="Boesen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jfki.fu-berlin.de/academics/SummerSchool/Dateien2011/Papers/duncan_boesen.pdf |title=Jerry Rubin and the Youth International Party |publisher=University of Copenhagen |date=November 2011 |accessdate=March 16, 2014 |author=Kathrine Boesen}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} The Vietnam Day Committee was a unique early antiwar organization in that it enjoyed large local participation and is believed to be a forerunner to the national movement against the war in Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Lowe"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wiu.edu/cas/history/wihr/WIHRVolIV%20Lowe.pdf |title=Radical Action and a National Antiwar Movement: The Vietnam Day Committee |publisher=Western Illinois Historical Review |work=Radical Action and a National Antiwar Movement: The Vietnam Day Committee |date=Spring 2012 |accessdate=March 16, 2014 |author=Michael Lowe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubin was one of the founding members of the [[Youth International Party]] (YIP) or Yippies, along with social and political activist [[Abbie Hoffman]] and satirist [[Paul Krassner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Torgoff |first=Martin |title=Can't Find My Way Home: America in the Great Stoned Age 1945-2000 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster Paperbacks |year=2004 |location=New York |url=http://books.simonandschuster.com/Cant-Find-My-Way-Home/Martin-Torgoff/9780743230117 |isbn=0-7432-3011-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yippies were not a formal organization with a membership list or a direct relationship with constituency, but played upon the media's appetite for anything new and different. They were influenced by [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s ideas on the importance of electronic communication, and believed that if radical events were made more entertaining the media, especially television would give them greater coverage.

As Rubin recollected:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... [T]he more visual and surreal the stunts we could cook up, the easier it would be to get on the news, and the more weird and whimsical and provocative the theater, the better it would play.&lt;ref name="Can 2004, p. 229"&gt;''Can't Find My Way Home'' 2004, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rubin's appearance before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) hearings is a good example of the Yippies emphasis on conducting political protest as theater, and creating as much attention as possible to their dissent by turning it into a spectacle. Rubin was subpoenaed by HUAC in Washington but instead of pleading the Fifth Amendment as was common, he entered the room dressed in a rented 18th-century American Revolutionary War uniform, proudly claiming to be a descendant of Jefferson and Paine. "Nothing is more American than revolution," he told the committee.&lt;ref name="Fitch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solidarity-us.org/site/node/2843 |title=Remembering Jerry Rubin |publisher=Solidarity |work=Remembering Jerry Rubin |date=March–April 1995 |accessdate=March 16, 2014 |author=Robert Fitch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rubin, showing a total lack of concern or worries, lightheartedly blew soap bubbles as members of Congress questioned his Communist affiliations. He subsequently appeared before the HUAC as a bare-chested guerrilla in [[Viet Cong]] pajamas, with war paint and carrying a toy M-16 rifle, and later as [[Santa Claus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montgomerycollege.edu/Departments/hpolscrv/yippiemanifesto.html A Yippie Manifesto by Jerry Rubin]. History &amp; Political Science Department. Montgomery College. Accessed April 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ron Chepesiuk, ''Sixties Radicals, Then and Now: Candid Conversations with Those Who Shaped the Era'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp; Company, 1995), 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Martin A. Lee]] and Bruce Shlain remark in their book ''[[Acid Dreams]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was a political ploy designed to make a mockery of the HUAC proceedings; the congressmen were caught off guard, and Rubin's stunt became page-one news throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;''Acid Dreams'' 1992, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another media stunt that gave the Yippies free publicity, not only in United States but all over of the world, was when Rubin, Hoffman and others brought the [[New York Stock Exchange]] to halt by tossing money into the air and watched gleefully as the stockbrokers scrambled vehemently for the bills.&lt;ref name="Can 2004, p. 229"/&gt; Yet another successful act in Yippies "guerrilla theater" was when during the Presidential elections of 1968 the Youth International Party nominated their own candidate for the presidency.

The nominee was [[Pigasus (politics)|Pigasus]] the Immortal, a 145-pound (66-kg) pig that they felt was a realistic alternative to [[Richard Nixon]] or his presidential opponents, Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]] and Alabama governor [[George Wallace]]. At the official introductions at Pigasus' first press conference, Rubin, while holding the candidate in his arms, demanded he be given Secret Service protection and be brought to the White House for a foreign policy briefing. He also promised, on behalf of Pigasus, a fair election campaign and if Pigasus won the election he would be eaten. This would, maintained Rubin, reverse the usual democratic process in which the pig is elected "and proceeds to eat the people."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''Acid Dreams'' 1992, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''DO IT!: Scenarios of the Revolution'' Rubin says "media does not ''report'' "news," it creates it. An event ''happens'' when it goes on TV and becomes a myth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Albert |first=Judith Clavir |author2=Stewart Edward Albert |title=The Sixties Papers: Documents of a Rebellious Decade |publisher=Praeger Publishers |year=1984 |location=New York |pages=442 |url=http://stewalbert.com/sixtiespage.html |isbn=0-275-91781-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to say:

&lt;blockquote&gt;TV time goes to those with the most guts and imagination. I never understood the radical who comes on TV in a suit and tie. Turn off the sound and he could be the mayor! The ''words'' may be radical, but the television is a non-verbal instrument! The way to understand TV is to shut off the sound. No one remembers any words they hear; the mind is a technicolor movie of images, not words. I've never seen "bad" coverage of a demonstration. It makes no difference what they ''say'' about us. The picture is the story.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sixties Papers'' 1984, p. 443.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In October 1967, [[David Dellinger]] of the [[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam]] asked Rubin to help mobilize and direct a [[March on the Pentagon]].&lt;ref name="levitate"&gt;[http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/jofreeman/photos/Pentagon67.html Levitate the Pentagon]&lt;/ref&gt; The protesters gathered at the [[Lincoln Memorial]] as Dellinger and [[Dr. Benjamin Spock]] gave speeches to the mass of people.&lt;ref name="space"&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/web/20051021-pentagon-vietnam-protest-washington-dc-lyndon-johnson-jerry-rubin-david-dellinger-allen-ginsberg-yippie-robert-mcnamara.shtml The Day The Pentagon Was Supposed To Lift Off Into Space] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051219220648/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/web/20051021-pentagon-vietnam-protest-washington-dc-lyndon-johnson-jerry-rubin-david-dellinger-allen-ginsberg-yippie-robert-mcnamara.shtml |date=December 19, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From there, the group marched towards the Pentagon. As the protesters neared the Pentagon, they were met by soldiers of the [[82nd Airborne Division]].&lt;ref name="space"/&gt; who formed a human barricade blocking the Pentagon steps.&lt;ref name="levitate"/&gt; Not to be dissuaded, [[Abbie Hoffman]], co-founder of the Yippies, vowed to levitate the Pentagon&lt;ref name="space"/&gt; while [[Allen Ginsberg]] led Tibetan chants to assist.&lt;ref name="space"/&gt; Eventually, things turned ugly. By the time the group's 48-hour permit expired, approximately 680 protesters had been jailed and 50 hospitalized.&lt;ref name="space"/&gt;

As one member of the march recalled:

{{quote|Then someone in authority decided that the Pentagon steps had to cleared. Rifle butts came down on people's heads with dull ugly wet sounding thumps. Blood splashed on to the steps. There were shouts of "Link arms! Link arms!", mixed with screams of pain and curses. People were dragged off and arrested. The brutality was appalling and the people standing on the steps began throwing debris at the soldiers. I saw a garbage can sail over my head. I feared people might be trampled in panic as they tried to escape from the clubs and rifle butts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/jofreeman/photos/Pentaremember3.html Remembering the Pentagon March (1967)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In spite of the brutality of the police the spirits of the demonstrators were not dampened. Many were exhilarated by what had transpired and some felt it was an event that would mark a turning point. "It made me see we could build a movement by knocking off American symbols," said Rubin.&lt;ref name="Acid Dreams 1992, p. 205"&gt;''Acid Dreams'' 1992, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; He added:

{{quote|We had symbolically destroyed Pentagon, the symbol of the war machine, by throwing blood on it, by pissing on it, dancing on it ... painting 'Che lives' on it. It was a total cultural attack on the Pentagon. The media had communicated this all over the country and lots of people identified with us, the besiegers.&lt;ref name="Acid Dreams 1992, p. 205"/&gt;}}

Rubin later played an instrumental role in the [[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity|anti-war demonstration]] that accompanied the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] in Chicago by helping to organize the Yippie "Festival of Life" in [[Lincoln Park]]. He spoke along with Hoffman at an anti-war rally at the [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] bandshell on August 28, 1968 and instructed demonstrators to resist if a riot broke out. However, the extent of violence between Chicago police and demonstrators (which an official government report called a "[[police riot]]") was not anticipated by the Yippie leaders. Some 1,500 people including civilians and police were injured.&lt;ref name="Boesen"/&gt;{{rp|11}} The arrest and trial of the Yippie leaders (known later as the Chicago Conspiracy Trial) which began on September 24, 1969 eventually led to the conviction of Rubin and seven others on charges of incitement to riot,&lt;ref name="Boesen"/&gt;{{rp|10}} including [[Abbie Hoffman]], [[Rennie Davis]], [[John Froines]], [[David Dellinger]], [[Lee Weiner]], [[Tom Hayden]], and [[Bobby Seale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schultz |first=John |title=No One Was Killed: The Democratic National Convention, August 1968 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |year=2009 |location=Chicago |pages=|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/presssite/metadata.epl?isbn=9780226740782 |isbn=978-0-226-74078-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defendants were commonly referred to as the "[[Chicago Eight]]". Seale's trial, however, was severed from the others after he demanded the right to serve as his own lawyer and was sentenced to four years in prison for contempt of court, making the Chicago Eight the Chicago Seven. The trial developed into a quiet spectacle, or "hippie-guerillas theater" as Rubin described it. Rubin, Hoffman and other defendants intentionally and successfully made a mockery of the court, widely covered by the press, with reporters from the ''[[New York Times]]'' and the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reporting on it.

Rubin, who had declared the trial to be "the Academy Award of protest"&lt;ref&gt;''The Sixties Papers'' 1984, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; at one point paraded back and forth in front of Judge [[Julius Hoffman]] (no relation to defendant Hoffman), thrusting his arm in a Nazi salute and shouting "Heil Hitler!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/Chicago7/RubinJ.htm  Jerry Rubin.] "The Chicago Seven" Trial 1969–1970 Homepage. Accessed April 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Another time he and Hoffman wore judge's robes to court. Judge Hoffman ordered both men to remove the robes. They did - but underneath they wore blue Chicago police shirts.&lt;ref name="Pace" /&gt; "The day Abbie and I came in wearing judges' robes was a stoned idea,"  Rubin said later. "It was a turning point in the trial in terms of theatrics, and it just went on from there."&lt;ref&gt;''Can't Find My Way Home'', p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the danger of being busted, Rubin smoked marijuana before the trial. "I got stoned a lot for the trial because it was such complete theater – a front-row seat to history – and marijuana intensifies every experience."&lt;ref&gt;''Can't Find My Way Home'', pp. 236–237.&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Hoffman added to the spectacle. Among other things, Hoffman ordered Black Panther leader [[Bobby Seale]] chained and gagged during part of the trial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1994-11-29/news/mn-2786_1_jerry-rubin 60s Activist Jerry Rubin Dies After Auto Injuries] by Shawn Hubler in Los Angeles Times, November 29, 1994. Accessed April 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubin, along with the six other defendants, was found not guilty on the charge of conspiracy but guilty (with four other defendants) on the charge of incitement. He was also sentenced by the judge to more than three years in prison for contempt of court. All the convictions for incitement were later overturned by an appeals court, who cited judicial and prosecutorial misconduct. Most of the contempt of court citations were also overturned on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schultz |first=John |title=The Chicago Conspiracy Trial: Revised Edition |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |year=2009 |location=Chicago |url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/presssite/metadata.epl?isbn=9780226741147 |isbn=978-0-226-74114-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The retrial was held in 1972.&lt;ref name="Boesen"/&gt;{{rp|12}}

The Vietnam War politicized marijuana, turning it from a sign of an immoral or corrupt person, suffering from [[amotivational syndrome]] (psychological condition associated with diminished inspiration to participate in social activities) into deliberate, calculated civil disobedience.

Jerry Rubin remarked in 1970:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Smoking pot makes you a criminal and a revolutionary. As soon as you take your first puff, you are an enemy of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Booth |first=Martin |authorlink=|author2= |title=Cannabis: A History |publisher=Bantam Books |year=2003 |location=London |url= |doi=|id=|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Jerry Rubin, activist at Flamingo Park during the 1972 Republican National Convention - Miami, Florida 2 (cropped2).jpg|thumb|right|1972 Republican convention]]

In 1972, Rubin was at it again, this time in Miami Beach to organize protests for both the [[1972 Republican National Convention|Republican]] and [[1972 Democratic National Convention|Democratic Conventions]]. This time, the local community knew the Yippies were coming and they organized behind a Rubin of their own, [[Ellis Rubin]], a well known attorney. On June 4, 1972, the Rubins debated at the Unitarian Church in Miami, in front of 500 highly charged churchgoers on both sides of the issue, only divided by a church aisle. Jerry began the debate by thanking "Uncle Ellis" for the invitation to debate. Ellis, who was not related to Jerry feigned disgust at the association and the event was "on". After barbs in both directions, it ended abruptly when Jerry famously dropped an "F-bomb" and Ellis took leave to lead the locals out in a protest of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&amp;dat=19720605&amp;id=X0VQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6VcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7298,982152|title=Two Rubins Debate Protesters' Role|publisher=[[The Evening Independent]]|date=June 5, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubin was also interviewed by journalist [[Dorothy Fuldheim]] about his book ''Do It''. In the interview, Rubin started to quiz Fuldheim, asking her if she drank. He then referred to the police as "pigs," which offended Fuldheim, who replied, "I've got a shock for you. Some of my friends are policemen". Rubin then muttered "Well, I've got a shock for you. I'm good friends with the Black Panthers." At this, Fuldheim threw his book and kicked Rubin off the set saying "Out! Stop the interview" as the cameras rolled.&lt;ref name="odell"&gt;{{cite book |last1=O'Dell |first1=Cary |title=Women Pioneers in Television: Biographies of Fifteen Industry Leaders |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=74fnsRmeeZcC&amp;lpg=RA1-PA111&amp;ots=E81uzNOPjI&amp;dq=dorothy%20fuldheim%20jerry%20rubin&amp;pg=PA111#v=onepage&amp;q=dorothy%20fuldheim%20jerry%20rubin&amp;f=false |accessdate=August 1, 2009 |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland and Company |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0167-2   |oclc=35646616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-activism==
Rubin held a post-election party at his place in New York in January 1973, attended by [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]], after McGovern lost to Nixon. Soon, Rubin retired from politics entirely, and became an [[entrepreneur]] and businessman. He was an early investor in [[Apple Computer]],&lt;ref name="Stanley"&gt;Timothy Stanley (May 14, 2008), {{cite web|url=http://www.the-utopian.org/2008/05/000026.html |title=The Long Haired Conservatives: the Children of '68 Reconsidered |accessdate=September 26, 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820113819/http://www.the-utopian.org/2008/05/000026.html |archivedate=August 20, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the end of the 1970s had become a multimillionaire.&lt;ref name="Stanley"/&gt;  Apple didn’t go public until 1980, so how could that investment make him a millionaire.


In the 1980s, he embarked on a debating tour with [[Abbie Hoffman]] titled "[[Yippie]] versus [[Yuppie]]". Rubin's argument in the debates was that activism was hard work and that the abuse of drugs, sex, and private property had made the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] "a scary society in itself." He maintained that "wealth creation is the real American revolution. What we need is an infusion of capital into the depressed areas of our country." A later political cartoon portrayed Rubin as half-guerrilla and half-businessman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ep.tc/realist/130/ The Realist]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubin's differences with Hoffman were on principle rather than personal. When Hoffman committed suicide in 1989, Rubin attended his funeral.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-20/news/mn-2279_1_youth-international-party-abbie-hoffman-jerry-rubin Turbulent '60s Live Again at Funeral for Activist Radicals, Friends Bid Hoffman Farewell]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his memo's ''Growing (Up) at Thirty-Seven'' Rubin emphasizes the importance of uniting the personal and the political.  He writes:

{{quote|Friends ask me, "Isn't your inward growth trip an escape from social reality?" Yes, it's a far cry from leading a march on [[the Pentagon]] to sitting cross-legged, counting my breaths.  But there is no contradiction. We activists in the 1960's eventually lost touch with ourselves. [[Arica School|Arica]], [[Erhard Seminars Training|est]], bioenergetics, and other growth trips are to creating a centered individual who moves politically from a deep place. Dissatisfaction is not the only source for political action; people can be political from a personally satisfied place ... We have an opportunity to transform the planet, but first we need to free ourselves from the conditioning of the past and find our natural internal harmony; to lower our defenses and establish our common humanity.&lt;ref name="Jerry-Growing"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rubin|first1=Jerry|title=Growing (Up) At Thirty Seven|date=1976|publisher=M.

==Other appearances==

Jerry Rubin appeared posthumously in the 2002 British documentary by [[Adam Curtis]], ''[[The Century of the Self]]''. He appears in episode part 3 of 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1139170/|title=The Century of the Self - There Is a Policeman Inside All Our Heads: He Must Be Destroyed|author= Adam Curtis|publisher=BBC|date=2002|accessdate=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This segment of the documentary discusses the [[Erhard Seminars Training]], also known as The ''[[Erhard Seminars Training|est]]'' Training, of which Rubin was a graduate. In his autobiography ''Growing (Up) at Thirty-Seven'' Rubin dedicates a chapter on his experience of taking the est Training. He explains why est appealed to him, even though he had initially resisted it:

{{quote|Something theatrically revolutionary was happening at est. In the 1960's we had used political guerrilla theater to get people to see beyond their roles. Now Werner was creating a psychological theater provoking people into self-confrontation. Whenever people discover themselves, they grow and learn − and that has to be revolutionary. (My act is liking something ''only'' if I can call it "revolutionary".) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rKToNkxZ_vkC&amp;pg=PA253&amp;dq=growing+up+at+thirty+jerry+rubin+est&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bN3hVLWICMvSaIP5gZgE&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=growing%20up%20at%2|title=American Spiritualities: A Reader|author=Catherine L.

Rubin also appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''{{'}}s second episode of its first season. He was announced as "Jerry Rubin, Leader of the Yippie Movement." The sketch is a fake commercial for wallpaper featuring famous protest slogans from the 1960s and 1970s (e.g., "Make Love, Not War", "Off The Pig!", "Give Peace A Chance", "Hell, No, We Won't Go!", etc.).

===Portrayal in popular culture===
In a motion picture about [[Abbie Hoffman]], ''[[Steal This Movie]]'', Rubin was portrayed by [[Kevin Corrigan]]. Rubin's love for and promotion of countercultural murderer [[Charles Manson]] is chronicled in the film [[Helter Skelter (2004 film)|''Helter Skelter'' (2004)]].&lt;ref&gt;For published references, including to Rubin's admiring book, ''We Are Everywhere'', see http://digital.lib.lehigh.edu/trial/reels/films/list/0_12_9.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2007 documentary ''Chicago 10: The Convention Was Drama. The Trial Was Comedy'' Rubin is featured both with film footage and with animation using [[Mark Ruffalo]] as his voice. In the television show ''[[Dark Skies]]'', Rubin is shown organizing an anti-war protest group in [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] that has been infiltrated by aliens; he is portrayed by [[Timothy Omundson]].

==Author==
Rubin's anti-establishment beliefs were put down in writing in his book, ''DO IT!: Scenarios of the Revolution'' (1970), with an introduction by [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] [[Eldridge Cleaver]] and unconventional design by [[Quentin Fiore]]. In 1971, his journal, written while incarcerated in the [[Cook County Jail]], was published under the title ''We are Everywhere.'' The book includes an inside view of the trial of the [[Chicago Seven]], but otherwise focuses on the [[Weatherman (organization)|Weather Underground]], the [[Black Panthers]], [[LSD]], [[women's rights|women's liberation]] and his view of a coming revolution.

In 1976, Rubin wrote another book entitled ''Growing (Up) at Thirty-Seven'', which contained a chapter about his experience at an [[Erhard Seminars Training]] (EST) session, later included in the book ''American Spiritualities: A Reader'' (2001) edited by Catherine L. Albanese.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.books.google.dk/books?isbn=0253214327 ''American Spiritualities: A Reader'']{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Edited by Catherine L. Albanese. Chapter 11 ''est'' by Jerry Rubin. 2001. Indiana University Press. Accessed April 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Growing (Up) at Thirty-Seven'' Rubin claims a rational society cannot be built by people who are out of touch with themselves and can't even run their own lives rationally. Real political change will not happen unless people transform their own personal reality, and their own relationships. Much like [[Arthur Koestler]] in his collections of essays [[The Yogi and the Commissar]] Rubin argues that political work and self-development has to go hand in hand. It was important, he said, that people ''lived'' the society they hoped to create.

As explained in ''Growing (Up) at Thirty-Seven'' Rubin experimented with many self-improvement techniques in order to overcome his own personal defects, everything from the ''est'' training, hypnotism, meditation and yoga to rolfing, acupuncture, the [[Arica School]], [[Gestalt therapy]] and the [[bioenergetic analysis]] of Wilhelm Reich's pupil Alexander Lowen. In a review of the book Derek VanPelt comments on Rubin's self quest:

{{quote|Rubin, though a crude writer, takes it all in from a fairly skeptical viewpoint and reports in entertaining, thoughtful, and sometimes funny prose.  The depth and sincerity of his search is apparent, and his call for a cooperative relationship between new consciousness and new politics is one of the more promising prospects of the seventies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freeingjohnsinclair.aadl.org/node/201328|title=Jerry Rubin|author=Derek VanPelt|publisher=Ann Arbor Sun|date=May 6, 1976|accessdate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1980, Rubin authored a self-help book with his wife, Mimi Leonard, entitled ''The War Between the Sheets: What's Happening with Men in Bed and What Men and Women Are Doing About It''.&lt;ref name="gaines"&gt;{{cite web|author=Steven Gaines|title=Jerry Rubin, His Penis and Me: A Very Short Story|url=http://observer.com/2014/11/jerry-rubin-his-penis-and-me-a-very-short-story/|publisher=[[The New York Observer]]|date=November 28, 2014|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not well received.&lt;ref name="gaines"/&gt;

==Business==
Sometime in the mid-1970s Rubin reinvented himself as a businessman. Friend and fellow Yippie [[Stew Albert]] claimed Rubin's new ambition was giving capitalists a social consciousness. In 1980 he began a new career on Wall Street as [[stockbroker]] with the [[brokerage firm]] John Muir &amp; Co. "I know that I can be more effective today wearing a suit and tie and working on Wall Street than I can be dancing outside the walls of power,"&lt;ref name="Pace" /&gt; he said. In the 1980s, he became known for his promotion of [[business networking]], having created Business Networking Salons, Inc., a company that organized parties at the Studio 54 and Palladium nightclubs in Manhattan, where thousands of young professionals and entrepreneurs met and shared ideas. Near the end of his life, Rubin became interested in the science of [[life extension]] and was heavily involved in [[multi-level marketing]] of health foods and nutritional supplements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1099.com/c/co/dw/pe/economy010.html What Jerry Rubin did in his final months. Accessed March 15, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; His business activities included marketing of a nutritional drink named Wow! that contained bee pollen, ginseng and kelp.&lt;ref name="Pace" /&gt;

==Death==
On November 14, 1994, Rubin [[jaywalking|jaywalked]] on [[Wilshire Boulevard]], in front of his penthouse apartment&lt;ref name="Pace" /&gt; in the [[Westwood, Los Angeles|Westwood]] area of Los Angeles, California. It was a Monday evening and weekday traffic was heavy, with three lanes moving in each direction. A car swerved to miss Rubin but a second car, immediately behind the first, was unable to avoid him. He was taken to the [[UCLA Medical Center]], where he died of a heart attack two weeks later. He is interred in the [[Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Culver City, California]].

State Senator (D-Santa Monica), fellow [[Chicago Seven]] member and friend [[Tom Hayden]] said after Rubin's death:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He was a great life force, full of spunk, courage and wit. I think his willingness to defy authority for constructive purposes will be missed. Up to the end, he was defying authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1994-11-29/news/mn-2786_1_jerry-rubin 60s Activist Jerry Rubin Dies After Auto Injuries] by Shawn Hubler in Los Angeles Times, November 29, 1994.

'''Sir John Menteith of Ruskie and Knapdale''' (c. 1275 – c. 1329) was a [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish]] nobleman during the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]]. He is known for his capture of Sir [[William Wallace]] in 1305 and later joined with King [[Robert de Brus|Robert I of Scotland]] and received large land grants in [[Knapdale]] and [[Kintyre]] for his service.

==Life== 
John was the younger son of [[Walter Bailloch|Walter Bailloch Stewart]], and [[Mary I, Countess of Menteith|Mary]], [[Earl of Menteith|Countess of Menteith]], the daughter of [[Muireadhach II]] Earl of Menteith.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, Peerage of Scotland, p. 472, ed. 1764&lt;/ref&gt; John possessed the land of [[Ruskie]] in [[Stirlingshire]]. John was a party to the [[Turnberry Bond]] with his father, Walter Stewart and the Bruces, which was signed at [[Turnberry Castle]] on 20 September 1286.

With his older brother [[Alexander, Earl of Menteith|Alexander]], John was involved in the resistance against King [[Edward I of England]] and were both captured after the [[Battle of Dunbar (1296)|Battle of Dunbar]] on 27 April 1296. While Alexander was released after swearing fealty, John remained a prisoner at [[Nottingham Castle]] in England until August 1297, when Edward released John from prison, on his taking oath and giving security to serve with the king in the campaign of 1297 in Flanders.

[[File:John Menteith, seal circa 1297.png|thumbnail|left|150px|Seal of John de Monteith (c.1297)]]
He was appointed the Constable of Lennox and was ravaging the lands of Edward's partisans in Lennox in 1301. John was sent in 1303 to treat of peace with the English, but refrained from pressing his mission. By 1303 John submitted and had been restored to Edward's favour, for on 20 March 1304 John was appointed Warden of the castle, town, and [[Sheriff of Dumbarton|sheriffdom]] of Dumbarton. Edward  was keen to secure the fortification as a major access route into Scotland by sea. John, as sheriff of Dumbarton, captured Sir [[William Wallace]] in 1305 and handed him over to the English. For this John was labeled traitorous and was given the contemporary nickname ''Fause Menteith'' ("Menteith the treacherous, false").
[[Image:Fause Menteith 1.jpg|100px|thumbnail|right|The little [[gargoyle]] head of the ''Fause Menteith'' on the 16th-century guard house at Dumbarton Castle]]

[[Wyntoun]], whose ''"Metrical Chronicle"'' was written in 1418, says:

&lt;div align="center"&gt;''"Schyre Jhon of Menteith in tha days''&lt;br /&gt;
''Tuk in Glasgow William Walays;''&lt;br /&gt;
''And sent hym until Ingland sune,''&lt;br /&gt;
''There was he quartayrd and undone."''&lt;/div&gt;

The English chronicler [[Piers Langtoft]] states that Menteith discovered the retreat of Wallace through the treacherous information of [[Jack Short (betrayer of William Wallace)|Jack Short]], Wallace's servant, and that he came under cover of night and seized him in bed. A passage in the [[Scalachronica]], quoted by [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]], notes, ''"William Walleys was taken of the Counte of Menteith, about Glasgow, and sent to King Edward, and after was hanged, drawn, and quartered at London."''

Menteith was nominated one of the representatives of the Scots barons in the parliament of both nations which assembled at London in September 1305 and was chosen upon the Scottish council, which was appointed to assist [[John of Brittany, Earl of Richmond|John of Brittany]], the new [[Guardian of Scotland]], in the English interest. John received on 1 June 1306 from Edward the [[Earl of Lennox|Earldom of Lennox]], while on 15 June he received the Warden of the castle, town, and sheriffdom of Dumbarton office for life. John returned to Scotland in October.

Edward appealed to John in December 1307 to join him in resisting the revolting [[Robert de Brus]], however John abandoned his earldom of Lennox, joining Brus's side. King Robert I of Scotland, rewarded John with large grants in Knapdale and [[Kintyre]]. In March 1308, John was among the Scottish magnates who wrote to the King [[Philip IV of France]] on behalf of the nation and in 1309, he was sent with Sir Nigel Campbell to treat with [[Richard Óg de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster|Richard de Burgh, Earl of Ulster]], receiving a safe-conduct on 21 August, from King [[Edward II of England]]. John's English lands were forfeited for his treason. In 1316 he was commissioned with [[Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray|Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray]] to treat on behalf of Robert Brus for a truce with the English. John remained closely attached to the royal court, as is shown by the numerous charters he attested and was at the Arbroath parliament in April 1320, and signed the [[Declaration of Arbroath]] sent by the barons of Scotland to [[Pope John XXII]].

John was described as 'guardian' of the earldom of Menteith, as his great-nephew [[Alan II, Earl of Menteith|Alan]], as Alan was a minor upon [[Alan, Earl of Menteith|Alan I, Earl of Menteith]]'s death. John was one of the negotiators of the thirteen years' truce between Bruce and the English, signed on 30 May 1323 and was present at a Scottish council at Berwick in June. The last recorded grants to him are in 1329, during the minority of King [[David II of Scotland]].

Koreans mainly live in the two Korean [[nation state]]s, [[South Korea]] and [[North Korea]] (collectively referred to simply as [[Korea]]), but are also an officially recognized ethnic minority in [[Koreans in China|China]], [[Koreans in Vietnam|Vietnam]], [[Koreans in Japan|Japan]] and [[Koreans in the Philippines|Philippines]], plus a number of former [[USSR|Soviet states]], such as [[Koreans in Russia|Russia]] and [[Koreans in Uzbekistan|Uzbekistan]]. Over the course of the 20th century, significant Korean communities have emerged in [[Korean Australians|Australia]], [[Korean Canadians|Canada]], [[Korean Americans|United States]] and, to a lesser extent, other nations with a primarily immigrant background.

As of 2017, there were an estimated 7.4 million ethnic [[Korean diaspora|Korean]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s residing outside the Korean Peninsula.&lt;ref name="MOFA"/&gt;

==Etymology==
{{see also|Names of Korea}}
[[South Korea]]ns refer to themselves as ''Hanguk-in'' ({{Korean|hangul=한국인|hanja=韓國人}}), or ''Hanguk-saram'' ({{Korean|hangul=한국 사람}}), both of which mean "Korean nation people." When referring to members of the Korean diaspora, Koreans often use the term ''Han-in'' ({{Korean|hangul=한인|hanja=韓人}}; literally "Korean people").

[[North Korea]]ns refer to themselves as ''Joseon-in'' ({{Korean|hangul=조선인|hanja=朝鮮人}}) or ''Joseon-saram'' ({{Korean|hangul=조선 사람}}), both of which literally mean "[[Joseon]] people". The term is derived from the [[Joseon dynasty]], a Korean kingdom founded by [[Yi Seonggye]] that lasted for approximately five centuries from 1392 to 1910. Using similar words, [[Koreans in China]] refer to themselves as '''Chaoxianzu''' ({{zh|c=朝鲜族}}) in Chinese or '''Joseonjok, Joseonsaram''' ({{korean|hangul=조선족, 조선사람}}) in Korean, which are [[cognate]]s that literally mean "Joseon [[ethnic group]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Making of International Law in Korea: From Colony to Asian Power |last=Lee, |first=Seokwoo |year=2016 |isbn=978-9004315785 |page=321}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Ethnicity and Foreigners in Ancient Greece and China |last=Kim |first=Hyunjin  |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |publication-date=21 May 2009 |page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zainichi Koreans]] refer to themselves as '''Zainichi Chousenjin, Chousenjin''' ({{lang-ja|在日朝鮮人, 朝鮮人}}) in Japanese or '''Jaeil Joseonin, Joseonsaram, Joseonin''' ({{korean|hangul=재일조선인, 조선사람, 조선인}}) in Korean

In the chorus of [[Aegukga]], the national anthem of South Korea, the Koreans are referred to as ''Daehan-saram'' ({{Korean|hangul=대한사람}}).

Ethnic Koreans living in Russia and Central Asia refer to themselves as [[Koryo-saram]] ({{Korean|hangul=고려 사람}}; [[Cyrillic script]]: Корё сарам), alluding to [[Goryeo]], a Korean dynasty spanning from 918 to 1392.

==Origins==
===Linguistic and archaeological studies===
Koreans are the descendants or an admixture of the ancient people who settled in the Korean Peninsula, historically said to be Siberian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Sarah M.|title=The Archaeology of Korea}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=186719|script-title=ko:한민족|trans-title=Korean people|language=ko|encyclopedia=Doosan Encyclopædia|via=NAVER Corp.|accessdate=9 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; or paleo-Asian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://preview.britannica.co.kr/bol/topic.asp?article_id=b24h2877b|script-title=ko:한민족|trans-title=Korean people|language=ko|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Korea|accessdate=9 March 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120801195956/http://preview.britannica.co.kr/bol/topic.asp?article_id=b24h2877b|archivedate=1 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological evidence suggests that proto-Koreans were migrants from [[Manchuria]] during the [[Liaoning bronze dagger culture|Bronze Age]].&lt;ref name="Ahn2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahn|first=Sung-Mo|title=The emergence of rice agriculture in Korea: archaeobotanical perspectives|journal=Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences|volume=2|issue=2|date=June 2010|pages=89–98|issn=1866-9557|doi=10.1007/s12520-010-0029-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is noteworthy to mention that there were already people&lt;ref&gt;Vovin, Alexander. 2008.

Travel fully funded by the Seoul National University.&lt;/ref&gt; living on the Korean peninsula from the [[Jeulmun pottery period|Paleolithic age]] and [[Mumun pottery period|Neolithic age]], and thus it is logical to assume that there was intermingling between these populations.

Linguistic evidence indicates speakers of proto-Korean languages were established in southeastern Manchuria and northern Korean peninsula by the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] period, and migrated from there to southern Korea during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Vovin, Alexander (2008). From Koguryo to Tamna: Slowly Riding to the South with Speakers of Proto-Korean|journal=Korean Linguistics|volume=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest concentration of [[dolmen]]s in the world is found on the [[Korean Peninsula]]. In fact, with an estimated 35,000-100,000 dolmen,{{sfn|Nelson|1993|p=147}} Korea accounts for nearly 70% of the world's total. Similar dolmens can be found in [[Manchuria]], the [[Shandong Peninsula]] and the [[Kyushu]] island, yet it is unclear why this culture only flourished so extensively on the Korean Peninsula and its surroundings compared to the bigger remainder of Northeastern Asia.

===Anthropometry===
Stephen Pheasant (1986),&lt;!--1986 is the date it says that Stephen Pheasant wrote Bodyspace in the first sentence of the second paragraph of the right column page 282 of the obituary reference. At the beginning of the obituary, the obituary says that Stephen Pheasant died on March 30, 1996. The 2003 date of the cited book is the date of the edition that was published to the Taylor &amp; Francis e-Library, which is information that is found in Page iv of the Bodyspace book.--&gt; who taught [[anatomy]], [[biomechanics]] and [[Human factors and ergonomics|ergonomics]] at the [[Royal Free Hospital]] and the [[University College London|University College, London]], said that [[Far East]]ern people have proportionately shorter lower limbs than [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] and [[Black people|Black Africans]]. Pheasant said that the proportionately short lower limbs of Far Eastern people is a difference that is most characterized in Japanese people, less characterized in Korean and Chinese people, and the least characterized in [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] and [[Thai people]].&lt;!--The preceding information is in the first sentence of the second paragraph of page 159 of the Bodyspace book. In that sentence, the "have proportionately shorter lower limbs" comparison after the semicolon is a comparison of Far Eastern people to both the European and Black African people who were mentioned before the semicolon. The word "characterized" is a rewording of the Bodyspace book's word "marked," which was used in the quote: "being most marked in the Japanese."--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pheasant, Stephen. (2003).&lt;!--This date comes from Page iv of the Bodyspace book. On Page iv, it says, "This edition published in the Taylor &amp; Francis e-Library, 2003."--&gt; ''Bodyspace: Anthropometry, ergonomics and the design of work'' (2nd. ed.). [[Taylor &amp; Francis]].

In the first sentence of the second paragraph of the right column of page 282 of the obituary, it says that Stephen Pheasant wrote Bodyspace (1986). The information about where and what Stephen Pheasant taught is in the first sentence of the last paragraph of the left column of page 282 of the obituary.--&gt;

====Craniometry====
In a [[Craniometry|craniometric]] study&lt;!--The findings which are attributed to Pietrusewsky (1994) on page 79 are inside a paragraph which is continued from page 78. This continued paragraph, which starts on page 78, is under the subheading "Craniometric studies". Therefore, Pietrusewsky (1994) is a craniometric study.--&gt;, Pietrusewsky (1994) found that the Japanese series, which was a series that spanned from the [[Yayoi period]] to modern times, formed a single branch with Korea.&lt;!--This is a rewording of the quote, which appears in the first paragraph of page 79, that said, "...in a later study (Pietrusewsky 1994) in which he did include Korean specimens, Pietrusewsky found that the Japanese series, from Yayoi to modern times, formed one branch with Korea, to which Ainu and Jōmon were marginally related."--&gt;&lt;ref name="Kumar2009"&gt;Kumar, Ann. (2009). Globalizing the Prehistory of Japan: Language, Genes and Civilisation. London and New York: [[Routledge]] [[Taylor &amp; Francis|Taylor &amp; Francis Group]]. Page 79 &amp; 88. Retrieved January 23, 2018, from [https://books.google.com/books?id=f_aQAgAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22Pietrusewsky%20found%20that%20the%20Japanese%20series%22 link.]&lt;/ref&gt; Later,&lt;!--The Pietrusewsky (1999) study was after the Pietrusewsky (1994) study.--&gt; Pietrusewsky (1999) found, however, that Korean and [[Yayoi people]] were very highly separated in the East Asian cluster, indicating that the connection that Japanese have with Korea would not have derived from Yayoi people.&lt;!--This is a rewording of the last sentence of the first paragraph with a bullet point next to it on page 88 which said, "However, Pietrusewsky (1999) revealed that the Yayoi and the Koreans were very well separated at either side of the East Asian cluster, with the Yayoi at the extreme outer edge — which indicates that the Japanese connection with Korea would not have come from the Yayoi population."--&gt;&lt;ref name="Kumar2009" /&gt;

Park Dae-kyoon&lt;!--The article's web page lists the first author's name as "Dae Kyoon Park." "Park Dae-kyoon" is the Korean ordering of the first author's name.--&gt; et al. (2001) said that distance analysis based on thirty-nine non-metric cranial traits showed that Koreans are closer craniometrically to [[Kazakhs]] and [[Mongols]] than Koreans are close craniometrically to the populations in [[China]] and [[Japan]].&lt;!--The preceding information was written based on the first and last sentences of the article's abstract. The article's abstract misspelled the word "Kazakh" as "Kazach".--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Park | first1 = Dae-kyoon | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2001 | title = Non-metric Traits of Korean Skulls | url = | journal = Korean Journal of Physical Anthropology | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | doi = 10.11637/kjpa.2001.14.2.117 | page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|polymorphisms in the human Y-chromosome]] have so far produced evidence to suggest that the Korean people have a long history as a distinct, mostly [[endogamy|endogamous]] ethnic group, with successive waves of people moving to the peninsula and three major Y-chromosome haplogroups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/p604310l152202g4/ |title=Y chromosome homogeneity in the Korean population|accessdate=4 May 2012 |doi=10.1007/s00414-010-0501-1 |pmid=20714743|volume=124 |issue=6|journal=International Journal of Legal Medicine |pages=653–657 |year=2010 | last1 = Hee Kim | first1 = Soon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reference population for Koreans used in [[Genographic Project#Geno 2.0 Next Generation|Geno 2.0 Next Generation]] is 94% Eastern Asia and 5% Southeast Asia &amp; Oceania.&lt;ref&gt;[[Genographic Project#Geno 2.0 Next Generation|Reference Populations - Geno 2.0 Next Generation]] .

===Genealogy===
[[Korea Foundation]] Associate Professor of History, Eugene Y. Park said that many Koreans seem to have a [[Genealogy|genealogical]] memory blackout before the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="ProfessorEugenePark"&gt;Eugene Y. Park. (n.d.).

Park's credential as "Korea Foundation Associate Professor of History".--&gt;&lt;!--The context of Park's statements indicate that the, "memory blackout, before the twentieth century" which Park talked about, refers to a genealogical memory blackout.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Y. Park, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akiv2ji6EiY&amp;t=7m6s from the 7:06 mark of the YouTube video to the 7:38 mark of the YouTube video], said, "''Secondly, on the one hand, so many Koreans seem to talk, to be able to tell, one, something about his or her [[Kim (Korean surname)#Gyeongju|Gyeongju Kim]] ancestors, of a [[Silla]] kingdom two-thousand years ago. And yet, such a person is unlikely to be able to tell you something about his or her great-great-grandparents, what they were doing hundred years ago, what their occupations were, where they were living, where their family graves are. In other words, a memory blackout, before the twentieth century.''"&lt;/ref&gt; Park said that the vast majority Koreans do not know their actual genealogical history.&lt;!--The context of Park's statements indicate that when Park said, "the vast majority of Koreans have lost memory of their actual history," Park was referring to having lost memory of their actual genealogical history.--&gt; Park said that, through "inventing tradition" in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, families devised a kind of master narrative story that purports to explain a surname-ancestral seat combination's history to the extent where it is next to impossible to look beyond these master narrative stories.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Y. Park, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akiv2ji6EiY&amp;t=16m54s from the 16:54 mark of the YouTube video to the 18:54 mark of the YouTube video], said, "''So, from this point on, then, I would like to survey, how the Koreans descended. Koreans, depending on their ancestors' status category, have dealt with genealogy and ancestry consciousness, in the last, differently, in the last two centuries. And, of course, most Koreans are not descendants of aristocrats, but, the, but what happened in the last hundred fifty, hundred to hundred fifty years, is that those Koreans, the vast majority of Koreans have lost memory of their actual history, in the sense where now, any outside observer who might ask a Korean person about ancestry, would be left with the impression that every Korean is now of aristocratic descent. So let me begin with the aristocracy. In the early modern era, the kind of a master narrative, stories that purport to explain a particular surname-ancestral seat combination's history, crystallize, they became set in stone, through inventing tradition. In the seventeenth and eighteenth century, many, all families devise such a stories, to the extent where, now today in Korea, anybody who is interested in tracing his or her ancestry, has to deal with such master narratives, but at the same time it is next to impossible to look beyond master narratives. In other words, in Korea, today, there's little sense of doing the kind of doing the genealogical research that you and I would do in the United States, by looking at [[United States Census|Census]] documents, and other types of documentation, that have been passed down through generations, or, have been maintained by the government.''"&lt;/ref&gt; Park gave an example of what "inventing tradition" was like from his own family's genealogy where a document from 1873 recorded three children in a particular family and a later 1920 document recorded an extra son in that same family.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Y. Park, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akiv2ji6EiY&amp;t=28m32s from the 28:32 mark of the YouTube video to the 29:21 mark of the YouTube video], said, "''This is an example. Here we see records that gives us a better sense of what inventing tradition was like. Here, a page from an eighteen seventy-three Miryang Pak family genealogy. Here's a man, indicated inside the circle named, Ju ''([[wikt:冑#Korean|冑]])''. He had three sons: Eun-gyeong, Hyeon-gyeong, Won-gyeong ''([[wikt:子#Korean|子]][[wikt:恩#Korean|恩]][[wikt:慶#Korean|慶]], [[wikt:子#Korean|子]][[wikt:賢#Korean|賢]][[wikt:慶#Korean|慶]], [[wikt:子#Korean|子]][[wikt:元#Korean|元]][[wikt:慶#Korean|慶]])''. But the edition that was published a bit later in the nineteen twenty, so we see the same man, Ju, and, under him, we see sons: Eun-gyeong, Hyeon-gyeong, Won-gyeong and, the extra, the fourth son, out of nowhere, Tōkhwa ''([[wikt:子#Korean|子]][[wikt:徳#Korean|徳]][[wikt:華#Korean|華]])''. Actually, this is my family. So, this was commonly done in the modern era, the children, son out of nowhere or claims that we were left out centuries ago, and please include us.''"&lt;/ref&gt; Park said that these master narratives connect the same surname and ancestral seat to a single, common ancestor. Park said that this trend became universal in the nineteenth century, but genealogies which were published in the seventeenth century actually admit that they did not know how the different lines of the same surname or ancestral seat are related at all.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Y. Park, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akiv2ji6EiY&amp;t=18m55s from the 18:55 mark of the YouTube video to the 19:30 mark of the YouTube video], said, "''And, these master narratives, genealogically connect all descent lines of a same surname and ancestral seat, to a single, common, ancestor. And, this was the pattern that was, that became universal by the nineteenth century. Whereas, genealogies published in the seventeenth century, actually, frankly admit that we do not know how these different lines of the same surname or ancestral seat are related or connected at all. So, all these changes took place only in the last two hundred years or so.''"&lt;/ref&gt; Park said that only a small percentage of Koreans had surnames and ancestral seats to begin with, and Park said that the rest of the Korean population had adopted these surname and ancestral seat identities within the last two to three hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Y. Park, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akiv2ji6EiY&amp;t=46m17s from the 46:17 mark of the YouTube video to the 47:02 mark of the YouTube video], said, "''At any rate, so, once, so, based on one's surname Kim, let's say, and the ancestral seat, [[Kim (Korean surname)#Gimhae (Kimhae)|Kimhae]], which is the most common ancestral seat among Kim surname Koreans, one can then look up, consult reference books, encyclopedias, go online to, find all these stories about different branches, famous individuals who are Kimhae Kim. But the problem is, of course, before the early modern era, only a small percentage of Koreans had surnames and the ancestral seat to begin with. In other words, the rest of the population had adopted these identities in the last two-three hundred years, so where does one go from there? And, this was definitely my challenge when I was a child.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

North Korea and South Korea share a common heritage, but the [[Division of Korea|political division]] since 1945 has resulted in some divergence of their modern cultures.

[[File:Panmunjeom inside barack.jpg|thumb|North Korean soldiers in the [[Joint Security Area]]]]
Estimating the size, growth rate, [[human sex ratio|sex ratio]], and age structure of [[North Korea]]'s population has been extremely difficult. Until release of official data in 1989, the 1963 edition of the [[North Korea Central Yearbook]] was the last official publication to disclose population figures. After 1963 demographers used varying methods to estimate the population. They either totalled the number of delegates elected to the [[Supreme People's Assembly]] (each delegate representing 50,000 people before 1962 and 30,000 people afterwards) or relied on official statements that a certain number of persons, or percentage of the population, was engaged in a particular activity. Thus, on the basis of remarks made by President [[Kim Il-sung]] in 1977 concerning school attendance, the population that year was calculated at 17.2 million persons. During the 1980s, health statistics, including life expectancy and causes of mortality, were gradually made available to the outside world.&lt;ref name=Savada1994&gt;{{Loc|article=''North Korea: A Country Study''|url=https://archive.org/details/PAM550-81 |author=Savada, Andreas Matles, ed.

In 1989 the [[Central Bureau of Statistics (North Korea)|Central Bureau of Statistics]] released demographic data to the [[United Nations Population Fund]] in order to secure the UNFPA's assistance in holding North Korea's first nationwide census since the establishment of the state in 1948. Although the figures given to the United Nations might have been distorted, it appears that in line with other attempts to open itself to the outside world, the North Korean regime has also opened somewhat in the demographic realm. Although the country lacks trained demographers, accurate data on household registration, migration, and births and deaths are available to North Korean authorities. According to the United States scholar [[Nicholas Eberstadt]] and demographer Brian Ko, vital statistics and personal information on residents are kept by agencies on the ''ri'' ("village", the [[Administrative divisions of North Korea#Third-level divisions|local administrative unit]]) level in rural areas and the ''dong'' ("district" or "block") level in urban areas.&lt;ref name=Savada1994/&gt;

{{main article|Korean diaspora}} &lt;!-- might rename this page --&gt;
Large-scale emigration from Korea began as early as the mid-1860s, mainly into the [[Russian Far East]] and [[Northeast China]] or what was historically known as [[Manchuria]]; these populations would later grow to more than two million [[Koreans in China]] and several hundred thousand [[Koryo-saram]] (ethnic Koreans in Central Asia and the former [[USSR]]).&lt;ref name="LeeKK"&gt;{{cite book|title=Overseas Koreans|author=Lee Kwang-kyu|publisher=Jimoondang|location=Seoul|year=2000|isbn=978-89-88095-18-8}}

Korean emigration to America was known to have begun as early as 1903, but the [[Korean Americans|Korean American]] community did not grow to a significant size until after the passage of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]]; as of 2017, excluding the undocumented and uncounted, roughly 1.85 million Koreans emigrants and people of Korean descent live in the United States according to the official figure by the US Census.&lt;ref name="koreanamericanstory.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreanamericanstory.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=199&amp;Itemid=134|title=KoreanAmericanStory.org|website=KoreanAmericanStory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Greater Los Angeles Area]] and [[New York metropolitan area]] in the United States contain the largest populations of ethnic Koreans outside of Korea or China. Significant Korean populations are present in China, Japan, and Canada as well. There are also Korean communities in Latin American countries such as [[Argentina]], Brazil, and [[Mexico]]. During the 1990s and 2000s, the number of [[Koreans in the Philippines]] and [[Koreans in Vietnam]] have also grown significantly.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite news|url=http://members.forbes.com/global/2006/0918/028.html|title=Ho Chi Minh Money Trail|last=Kelly|first=Tim|date=18 September 2006|accessdate=27 March 2007|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Meinardus&gt;{{cite news|url=http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/opinion/200512/kt2005121517211054280.htm |publisher=The Korea Times |date=15 December 2005 |accessdate=16 February 2007 |title="Korean Wave" in Philippines |last=Meinardus |first=Ronaldo |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060113170244/http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/opinion/200512/kt2005121517211054280.htm |archivedate=13 January 2006 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Koreans in the United Kingdom]] now form Western Europe's largest Korean community, albeit still relatively small; [[Koreans in Germany]] used to outnumber those in the UK until the late 1990s. In Australia, [[Korean Australians]] comprise a modest minority. Koreans have migrated significantly since the 1960s. Now they form an integral part in society especially in Business, Education and Cultural areas.

The Korean population in the United States represents a small share of the US economy, but has a disproportionately positive impact. [[Korean Americans]] have a savings rate double that of the average American and also graduate from college at a rate double that of the average American, providing a highly skilled and educated addition to the U.S. [[workforce]]. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's Census 2000 data, mean household earnings for Koreans in the U.S. were $59,981, approximately 5.1% higher than the U.S. average of $56,604.&lt;ref name="U.S. Census 2000, Summary File 4, Sample Data"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF4_U_QTP33&amp;-reg=DEC_2000_SF4_U_QTP33:001%7C023&amp;-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF4_U&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-format=&amp;-CONTEXT=qt |title=American FactFinder |publisher=Factfinder.census.gov |accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Krista Branch''' is an American singer whose 2010 song "I Am America" has been called the anthem of the [[Tea Party movement]]. Branch produced "I Am America" with her husband, who wrote the song, to protest the treatment of the Tea Party by Democrats.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; After being uploaded to [[YouTube]], the song was aired on [[Glenn Beck]]'s radio show and it quickly grew in popularity.&lt;ref name="tulsaworld"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bixby singer Krista Branch sings Tea Party praises – and creates a YouTube hit|publisher=[[Tulsa World]]|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/scene/article.aspx?subjectID=454&amp;articleID=20100720_371_0_hrbrFo974328|date=July 20, 2010|accessdate=October 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently performed on [[Fox News]] and at events across the country. A former ''[[American Idol]]'' contestant, Branch was eliminated early in the process.

The Branches became supporters of [[Herman Cain presidential campaign, 2012|2012 presidential candidate]] [[Herman Cain]] after performing at several events where he was a keynote speaker, and "I Am America" was made the official theme song of the campaign. Another song released by Branch, "Remember Who We Are", was made the official campaign anthem of [[Rick Santorum]]'s [[Rick Santorum presidential campaign, 2012|presidential campaign]].

Branch's music regularly expresses religious and political themes emphasizing [[American exceptionalism]]. Her music has been well received among conservative commentators and members of the Tea Party movement for its political message.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; The use of Branch's music in the campaigns of Cain and Santorum has been seen as an indication of its appeal among outsider candidates.&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;{{cite news|last=Weigel|first=David|title=The Rick Santorum Theme Song, Brought to You by the Author of the Herman Cain Theme Song|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2012/03/15/the_rick_santorum_theme_song_brought_to_you_by_the_author_of_the_herman_cain_theme_song.html|accessdate=March 19, 2012|newspaper=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has released nine singles and an [[extended play|EP]], and is working on her debut album for release in 2013.{{update inline|date=July 2016}}

She married Michael Branch in 2000, and they have since had three children together.&lt;ref name=tulsaworld /&gt; Early in their marriage they had a low income, and Branch's husband took on several odd jobs, in addition to his work as a youth pastor, in order to make a living. He describes living with Branch in a "shabby place" in Tulsa, Oklahoma where they struggled to pay $480 a month in rent. Later they bought a house in Tulsa, and rented it out while they were living in Colorado; they got into financial difficulties when the tenants stopped paying the rent, and they accepted the bank's decision to foreclose the mortgage, as that cleared their debt.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; They appeared on the Christian news magazine program, [[the 700 Club]], talking about an incident in which their baby daughter was revived after drowning in their bathtub, and they attributed their child's survival to the power of prayer, having been inspired after seeing ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' a few days earlier.&lt;ref name=700Club /&gt;

== Career ==
While living in [[Bixby, Oklahoma]], Branch auditioned for the [[American Idol (season 7)|seventh season of ''American Idol'']] and was chosen by the judges to move on to the preliminary round in [[Hollywood]]. Footage of her performance was not included on the show, but she appeared in a montage at the end of the episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Four Oklahomans get to next round on 'American Idol'|work=[[Tulsa World]]|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=20080117_1__hrimg71037|date=January 17, 2008|accessdate=October 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later she was eliminated from the competition. Branch told ''[[The New York Times]]'' her decision to enter the contest was not due to a desire to "be somebody", but because she felt she should take any opportunity with the belief that God would bless her efforts.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

Two years later, the video for Branch's fourth single "I Am America" was released on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name=tulsaworld /&gt;&lt;ref name=HuffPo /&gt; Her husband, Michael Branch, wrote the song partly in response to criticism of the [[Tea Party protests]] from [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], while also drawing on his own difficulties in life.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; In an interview for Billy Kelly of [[the Washington Times]]' Tea Party Report, Branch told how soon after her husband wrote the song he had her quickly learn the lyrics and then recorded her performing the song.&lt;ref name="WashingtonTimes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Singer Krista Branch gives the tea party movement its anthem|work=[[The Washington Times]]|url=http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/tea-party-report/2010/jul/22/singer-krista-branch-gives-tea-party-anthem/|date=July 22, 2010|accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She originally felt the song was too confrontational for her, but decided the message was so important that she should record the song.&lt;ref name=Dallasnews /&gt; In the music video, footage of Tea Party rallies is interspersed with scenes of Branch singing on a sound stage and kids holding signs containing political messages and [[scripture]].&lt;ref name=HuffPo /&gt; "I Am America" was played on the July 7, 2010, broadcast of [[Glenn Beck]]'s radio show and a week later Fox News host [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] devoted a portion of his "Pinheads and Patriots" segment to the song, saying that "for honoring legitimate protest" Branch was a patriot.&lt;ref name="tulsaworld"/&gt;&lt;ref name=HuffPo&gt;{{cite news|title=Krista Branch 'I Am America' Song Supports Tea Party|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/07/krista-branch-i-am-americ_n_638596.html|date=July 7, 2010 |accessdate=October 28, 2011 |first=Tj |last=Ortenzi}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 21 days after being uploaded the video had nearly 475,000 views. "I Am America" soon became a popular song with the [[Tea Party movement]] and has been described as the movement's anthem.&lt;ref name=tulsaworld /&gt;&lt;ref name=WashingtonTimes /&gt; ''The New York Times'' described Branch as having a "dynamic presence" on stage when singing the song.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;

Glenn Beck played another Krista Branch song titled "Remember Who We Are" on his Insider Extreme radio program early in August 2010 and the song was featured in a video from Branch promoting Beck's [[Restoring Honor rally]].&lt;ref name=Beckradio&gt;{{cite episode|url=http://www.glennbeck.com/content/show/2010-07-27/|title=Glenn Beck Program|credits=[[Glenn Beck]]|network=[[Premiere Networks]]|station=[[WOR (AM)]]|location=[[New York City]]|airdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Glenn Beck, Sarah Palin to Hold "Restoring Honor Rally"|publisher=[[CBS News]]|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20011688-503544.html|date=July 26, 2010|accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lyrics for "Remember Who We Are" contain a mixture of defiant metaphors with a Christian rock style of music.&lt;ref name=ColoradoIndie /&gt; Branch's husband said he wrote the song to "remind us of who Americans are in the wake of the most trying of times." He stated that Americans stand up and come together in the face of adversity, saying he prayed the song would bring people hope.&lt;ref name=Today /&gt; Calling it an "inspiring patriotic song", the video for the song was made the "Video of the Day" on Glenn Beck's site on September 3, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Video of the Day – September 3, 2010|url=http://www.glennbeck.com/content/articles/article/198/45246/|publisher=GlennBeck.com|accessdate=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her first EP ''I Am America'' was released on September 3, 2010 by Soundmindpro Publishing, a company established by Branch's husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=I Am America EP by Krista Branch|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/i-am-america-ep/id391552323|publisher=[[iTunes]]|accessdate=August 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sound Mind Productions – About|url=http://www.soundmindpro.com/about|publisher=Sound Mind Productions|accessdate=August 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EP included "Remember Who We Are"  as well as "I Am America" and "Foreign Land", a song about departed American soldiers. Jeremiah Holdsworth of IndieVision felt the songs were strong, noting their patriotic themes and subtle religious subtext, and said the song "Foreign Land" particularly moved him.&lt;ref name=IndieVision&gt;{{cite news|last=Holdsworth|first=Jeremiah|title=Krista Branch – I Am America EP|url=http://www.indievisionmusic.com/2011/07/16/krista-branch-i-am-america-ep/|accessdate=April 16, 2012|newspaper=Indie Vision Music|date=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Branch released a new single on July 22, 2011, called "Lead Me On", a cover of [[Lead Me On (Amy Grant song)|the Amy Grant song]] and released a video for the song a month later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lead Me On – Single by Krista Branch|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/lead-me-on-single/id452424023|publisher=[[iTunes]]|accessdate=August 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JTA&gt;{{cite news|title=Krista Branch's pro-Israel song is Amy Grant's song about the Holocaust (and slavery)|publisher=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]|url=http://blogs.jta.org/politics/article/2011/10/30/3090030/krista-branchs-pro-israel-song-is-amy-grants-song-about-the-holocaust-and-slavery|date=October 30, 2011|accessdate=July 11, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419034728/http://blogs.jta.org/politics/article/2011/10/30/3090030/krista-branchs-pro-israel-song-is-amy-grants-song-about-the-holocaust-and-slavery|archivedate=April 19, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was described as pro-Israel with the music video containing imagery related to the history of the Jewish people, including a prominent emphasis on the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Krista Branch, the Tea Party's siren, releases a pro-Israel song|publisher=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]|url=http://blogs.jta.org/politics/article/2011/10/28/3090016/krista-branch-the-tea-partys-siren-releases-a-pro-israel-song|date=October 28, 2011|accessdate=October 28, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030204506/http://blogs.jta.org/politics/article/2011/10/28/3090016/krista-branch-the-tea-partys-siren-releases-a-pro-israel-song|archivedate=October 30, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to her performances in the United States, Branch has performed for teens in Guatemala and Slovakia.&lt;ref name=WashingtonTimes /&gt; She performed at the 2011 [[Sunbelt Ag Expo]] in conjunction with the [[American Bible Society]], singing patriotic songs to support American soldiers and performing the [[Star Spangled Banner|national anthem]] for the Expo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sarachik|first=Justin|title=American Bible Society, Krista Branch Help Soldiers Overcome War Pressures|url=http://global.christianpost.com/news/american-bible-society-krista-branch-help-soldiers-overcome-war-pressures-58696/|accessdate=March 22, 2012|newspaper=[[Christian Post]]|date=October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Armed Services Ministry Goes to Sunbelt|url=http://record.americanbible.org/content/armed-services-ministry-goes-sunbelt|publisher=[[American Bible Society]]|accessdate=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Branch attended the Washington Times' 30th anniversary celebration on October 3, 2012, and performed several songs for the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boltz|first=Martha M.|title=30th Anniversary of The Washington Times celebrated|url=http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/entertainment-news-and-reviews/2012/oct/4/30th-anniversary-washington-times-celebrated/|accessdate=30 October 2012|newspaper=[[The Washington Times]]|date=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Branch regularly performs with Oklahoma jazz saxophonist Grady Nichols.&lt;ref name=tulsaworld /&gt; She is working on her debut album, which was scheduled to be released in early 2013.&lt;ref name=WashingtonTimes /&gt;

=== 2012 Republican presidential primaries ===
Branch's music has gained prominence as a result of its use during the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2012|2012 Republican presidential primary]].&lt;ref name=Dallasnews /&gt; When she was performing "I Am America" at events across the country, [[Herman Cain]] was often the keynote speaker. Branch and her husband came to appreciate his political views and her husband signed on with [[Herman Cain presidential campaign, 2012|Cain's campaign]]. "I Am America" was later adopted by the candidate as his campaign's official theme.&lt;ref name=Dallasnews /&gt; Cain said when interviewed about the song, "The first time I heard that song, the message was so right-on I felt goose bumps just listening to it."&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; The song was later described by the [[National Journal]] as having "underscored Cain's anti-elitist appeal" with its lyrics.&lt;ref name=Journal&gt;{{cite news|last=Boerma|first=Lindsey|title=Santorum Gets a Big Win and His Own Song|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/2012-presidential-campaign/santorum-gets-a-big-win-and-his-own-song-20120314?mrefid=election2012|accessdate=March 19, 2012|newspaper=[[National Journal]]|date=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campaign ads featuring "I Am America" gave the song increased exposure.&lt;ref name=Dallasnews /&gt; A campaign ad using "I Am America" that included Cain's chief of staff was the subject of numerous parodies also featuring the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jon Huntsman's daughters spoof Herman Cain's smoking ad|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2054982/Herman-Cain-smoking-advert-spoofed-Jon-Huntsmans-daughters.html|accessdate=March 19, 2012|newspaper=[[The Daily Mail]]|date=October 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', comedian Stephen Colbert satirically claimed Cain got the line "I Am America" from Colbert's book, ''[[I Am America (And So Can You!)]]''. Several parodies of the ad were then shown on the program using the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stephen Colbert Offers Herman Cain Suggestions For Further Commercials, Issues Challenge |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/26/stephen-colbert-herman-cain_n_1032707.html|date=October 26, 2011|accessdate=October 28, 2011|first=Jason|last=Linkins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rick Santorum announced in March 2012 that he has adopted Branch's song "Remember Who We Are" as an official theme song for his campaign, having been without a theme song prior to the announcement.&lt;ref name=Today&gt;{{cite news|last=Eugenios|first=Jillian|title=Santorum finds his groove with new theme song|url=http://todayonthetrail.today.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/03/15/10699939-santorum-finds-his-groove-with-new-theme-song|accessdate=March 19, 2012|newspaper=[[MSNBC]]|date=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santorum said he chose the song because "few songs express the beauty and strength of who we are as free Americans better than Krista's." The song is seen as representing the emotion of his campaign effort.&lt;ref name=ColoradoIndie&gt;{{cite news|last=Tomasic|first=John|title=Fresh off southern victories, Santorum taps Tea Party singer Branch for theme song|url=http://coloradoindependent.com/115541/fresh-off-southern-victories-santorum-taps-tea-party-singer-branch-for-theme-song|accessdate=March 19, 2012|newspaper=[[The Colorado Independent]]|date=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Journal /&gt; [[David Weigel]] described Branch as the "muse of the insurgent conservative candidate" due to her songs being used by Cain and Santorum in their primary campaigns.&lt;ref name=Slate /&gt;

== Politics ==
Branch has said her patriotism and admiration for America is the unifying principle of her music. She suggests the Tea Party is animated not by rebelliousness, but by patriotism and love of freedom.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; Her music often incorporates political themes and  religious views that have led to her songs resonating with Tea Party supporters and commentators such as Glenn Beck and Bill O'Reilly.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dallasnews /&gt;&lt;ref name=HuffPo /&gt;&lt;ref name=ColoradoIndie /&gt;

The artist has performed at political rallies led by Beck, and at campaign rallies for Herman Cain. Her husband joined Cain's presidential campaign as state director for Tennessee after hearing him speak at events where Branch performed.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; Branch said Cain was a natural choice for her and her husband because she felt their beliefs aligned with Cain's.&lt;ref name=Dallasnews /&gt; Since 2010, she received three payments that totaled $10,000 for live entertainment services provided at political rallies from several [[political action committees]] associated with Cain's campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cain Ad Stars Paid Well, Senator Wants a Super PAC and More in Capital Eye Opener: Oct. 26|publisher=[[Open Secrets]]|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2011/10/herman-cain-ad-stars-paid-well.html|date=October 26, 2011|accessdate=July 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is a collective name for a group of [[Hui people|Hui]] (Muslim Chinese) warlords in [[Northwestern China]] who ruled the [[Chinese provinces]] of [[Qinghai]], [[Gansu]] and [[Ningxia]] for 10 years from 1919 until 1928.  Following the overthrow of the Qing dynasty in 1911, the region came under Chinese Muslim warlord [[Ma Qi]]'s control until the Northern Expedition by the Republic of China consolidated central control in 1928. There were three families in the Ma clique ("Ma" being a common Hui rendering of the common [[Islam|Muslim]] name "[[Muhammad (name)|Muhammad]]"), each of them respectively controlled 3 areas, [[Gansu]], [[Qinghai]], and [[Ningxia]]. The three most prominent members of the clique were [[Ma Bufang]], [[Ma Hongkui]], and [[Ma Hongbin]], collectively known as the '''Xibei San Ma''' ({{zh|西北三马}}, ''Three Mas of the Northwest''). Some contemporary accounts, such as [[Edgar Snow]]'s, described the clique as the "Four Ma" (rather than Three), adding Ma Bufang's brother Ma Buqing to the list of the top warlords.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edgar Snow]], ''Red Star Over China''. Chapter 4, "Moslem and Marxist". Numerous editions.&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent Mas included [[Ma Anliang]], [[Ma Qi]], [[Ma Lin (warlord)|Ma Lin]], [[Ma Hu-shan]], and [[Ma Zhongying]].

==Ma Clique==
The Ma Clique warlords were all Generals in the military of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], who controlled all of [[Mainland China]] until it was overtaken by the communist [[People's Liberation Army]]. The clique was begun by Muslim generals who served in the military of the Qing dynasty, most notably in the [[Kansu Braves]] army, who fought in the [[Boxer Rebellion]] against invading foreign forces. It was continued by two generations of their descendants.

After the [[Xinhai Revolution]] overthrew the Qing, the Ma Clique Generals declared their allegiance to the Republic of China. Unlike the Mongols, Hui Muslims refused to secede from the Republic, and [[Ma Qi]] quickly used his diplomatic and military powers to make the Tibetan and Mongol nobles recognize the Republic of China government as their overlord, and sent a message to President [[Yuan Shikai]] reaffirming that [[Qinghai]] was securely in the Republic. He replaced "Long, Long, Long, Live the reigning Emperor", with "Long live the Republic of China" on inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3C2B9oXVbQC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=ma+qi+general&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3C7PTIX4A8H6lweRkonlCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ma%20qi%20general&amp;f=false|title=Dilemmas The Mongols at China's edge: history and the politics of national unity |author=Uradyn Erden Bulag|year=2002|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=|page=43|isbn=0-7425-1144-8|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ma Anliang also agreed to join the new [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90CN0vtxdY0C&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=ma+anliang's+brother+ma+guoliang&amp;cd=1#v=snippet&amp;q=twenty%20battalions%20of%20loyal%20muslim%20braves&amp;f=false|title=Familiar strangers: a history of Muslims in Northwest China|author=Jonathan Neaman Lipman|year=2004|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle|page=170|isbn=0-295-97644-6|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Kuomintang]] seized power in the [[Northern Expedition]], the Ma Clique warlords became members of the [[Kuomintang]] party, and their armies were renamed as divisions of the [[National Revolutionary Army]]. The Ma Clique [[Ninghai Army]] under General Ma Qi was renamed the National Revolutionary Army 26th Division.

[[Ma Zhongying]] led the [[36th Division (National Revolutionary Army)|KMT 36th Division]] to fight against the pro-Soviet governor of Xinjiang, [[Jin Shuren]] during the [[Kumul Rebellion]], and the Soviets themselves during the [[Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang]]. The 36th Division also crushed the [[First East Turkestan Republic]] at the [[Battle of Kashgar (1934)]].

In the [[Sino-Tibetan War]], Ma Clique forces led by [[Ma Bufang]] defeated the Tibetan Army. Also during the [[Kuomintang Pacification of Qinghai]] Ma Bufang waged war against Tibetan tribes in Qinghai to bring them under his control.

During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Ma Clique forces fought against the Japanese, [[Ma Hongbin]] led his 81st corps to defeat the Japanese at the [[Battle of Wuyuan]]. Ma Bufang sent [[Ma Biao (general)|Ma Biao]] to attack the Japanese army. 40 years before, Ma Biao had fought in the Boxer Rebellion against the Eight Nation Alliance.

[[Ma Bufang]] was ordered by the [[Kuomintang]] to invade [[Xinjiang]] in the 1940s to intimidate and help oust the forces of the pro Soviet Governor [[Sheng Shicai]]. The Ma Clique forces also clashed with the forces of the [[Second East Turkestan Republic]] during the [[Ili Rebellion]].

==The Three Families of the Ma Clique==
* The first family was headed by [[Ma Zhanao]]. He had 2 sons, [[Ma Anliang]], and Ma Guoliang, both of whom became Qing generals. Ma Anliang later became a general in the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. Ma Anliang had 5 sons, 3 were unknown. The other 2 were Ma Tingran and Ma Tingxian, who was executed in 1962 by the Peoples Court.
* The second family was headed by Ma Qianling. [[Ma Hongbin]] and [[Ma Hongkui]] were cousins. Their respective fathers, [[Ma Fulu]] (马福绿) (1854–1900) and [[Ma Fuxiang]] (马福祥) (1876–1932) came from Yangzhushan (阳注山) village in Hanji Town (presently, the county seat of [[Linxia County]]), and were half-brothers. Ma Fulu and Ma Fuxiang's father [[Ma Qianling]], originally a small merchant and farmer from [[Linxia City|Hezhou]], had been an associate of [[Ma Zhan'ao]] – the ruler of [[Linxia City|Hezhou]] region during the [[Dungan revolt (1862–1877)|Great Muslim Rebellion]] of the 1860s – and went over to the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] government's side in 1872 along with Ma Zhan'ao himself; rewarded by the government and successful in his business, he had four sons with his three wives.&lt;ref&gt;Lipman (1998), pp. 167–172&lt;/ref&gt; Ma Zhanao was the father of another 2 Ma clique warlords, [[Ma Anliang]] and Ma Guoliang.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90CN0vtxdY0C&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=ma+anliang's+brother+ma+guoliang&amp;cd=1#v=snippet&amp;q=ma%20zhan'ao%20son%20ma%20anliang&amp;f=false|title=Familiar strangers: a history of Muslims in Northwest China|author=Jonathan Neaman Lipman|year=2004|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle|page=146|isbn=0-295-97644-6|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90CN0vtxdY0C&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=ma+anliang's+brother+ma+guoliang&amp;cd=1#v=snippet&amp;q=ma%20guoliang%20brother&amp;f=false|title=Familiar strangers: a history of Muslims in Northwest China|author=Jonathan Neaman Lipman|year=2004|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle|page=168|isbn=0-295-97644-6|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ma Qianling also had several nephews who died along with Ma Fulu in the [[Boxer Rebellion]].
* [[Ma Haiyan]] started the third family. He had two sons, Ma Qi, and Ma Lin. Ma Qi had 2 sons, [[Ma Buqing]] and [[Ma Bufang]], originally from Monigou Township (漠泥沟乡) in [[Linxia County]].&lt;ref name=lvyou&gt;"临夏旅游" (Linxia Tourism), published by Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture Tourist Board, 2003. 146 pages. No ISBN. pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Their father, [[Ma Qi]] (1869–1931), was based in [[Xining]], controlling what is today [[Qinghai]] Province. [[Ma Zhongying]] was Ma Qi's nephew, and thus a cousin of [[Ma Buqing]] and [[Ma Bufang]]. [[Ma Hushan]] was also a member of this family. This family controlled [[Qinghai]] province. One Generation of this family had the same [[Generation name]], 步 (Bù), [[Ma Bufang]], [[Ma Buqing]], [[Ma Bukang]], Ma Buluan, and Ma Zhongying (whose original name was Ma Buying) all had the Bu character in their names and were of the same generation, all being grandsons of Ma Haiyan.

==History==
The Ma clique traces its origins to the officers of [[Qing dynasty]] General [[Dong Fuxiang]]. General [[Ma Anliang]] was the de facto leader of the Muslims of northwest China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=NnjsTZ2MHcnw0gHfwa12&amp;ct=result&amp;id=NNAMAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Thus+Ma+An-liang%2C+the+leading+figure+in+Kansu+from+1912+to+his+death+in+November+1919%2C+had+led+four+ying+to+the+relief+of+Sining+in+1895.+In+1910+we+find+him+promoted+from+the+Barkul+military+command%2C+perhaps+the+key+cavalry+posting+in&amp;q=+moslem+clique++fu+hsiang+an-liang|title=Chinese Republican studies newsletter, Volumes 5-7|author=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

The Three (or Five) Ma took control of the region during the [[Warlord Era]], siding first with the [[Guominjun]] and then the [[Kuomintang]]; they fought against the Red Army during the [[Long March]] and the Japanese during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].

The Ma Clique controlled vast amounts of land in the northwest, included Xining and Hezhou.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WltwAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=ma+qi+muslim&amp;dq=ma+qi+muslim&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=S3-qTP3bBoKC8gbpgKXhBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwCA|title=China's inner Asian frontier: photographs of the Wulsin expedition to northwest China in 1923 : from the archives of the Peabody Museum, Harvard University, and the National Geographic Society|author=Frederick Roelker Wulsin, Mary Ellen Alonso, Joseph Fletcher, Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, National Geographic Society (U.S.), Peabody Museum of Salem, Pacific Asia Museum|year=1979|publisher=The Museum : distributed by Harvard University Press|location=|page=43|isbn=0-674-11968-1|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Qing dynasty]] had granted [[Ma Bufang]]'s family a yellow standard which had his family name "Ma" on it. Ma Bufang continued to use this standard in battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YJqPc4tqSGEC&amp;pg=PT253&amp;dq=ma+bufang+buddhist&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BELkTZPIKMnogAfJj-2bBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=ma%20bufang%20commanded%2030%2C000%20muslim%20soldiers&amp;f=false|title=Unbound: A True Story of War, Love, and Survival|author=Dean King|editor=|year=2010|publisher=Hachette Digital, Inc.|edition=illustrated|location=|page=|isbn=0-316-16708-8|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ma Bufang]] recruited many [[Salar people|Salar]] officers from [[Xunhua]] County into his army like Han Yimu and General [[Han Youwen]].

During one campaign against the Communists in the Civil War, in Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia, Muslim soldiers numbered 31,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=foATAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=31000+Mohammedan+troops+(Kansu,+Ninghsia,+Chinghai)+40000+Communist+army+(Kansu&amp;dq=31000+Mohammedan+troops+(Kansu,+Ninghsia,+Chinghai)+40000+Communist+army+(Kansu&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qm_sTavcGIObtwfE6aTCAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA|title=The China monthly review, Volumes 80-81|author=|editors=|year=1937|publisher=J.W.

During the final stages of the [[Chinese Civil War]], the Ma fought for the Kuomintang side in defiance until the communists [[Lanzhou Campaign|wiped out his cavalry]] and took Gansu in August 1949, just months before the establishment of the People's Republic of China. Upon [[Lanzhou Campaign|the arrival of communist forces]], Ma Hongbin had little possibility of winning and went to communists side. He was appointed vice-chairman (later restyled vice-governor) of [[Gansu]] province.  He later died in [[Lanzhou]] in 1960. [[Ma Hongkui]] fled with the Kuomintang to [[Taiwan]]. He was indicted by Republic of China Control Yuan as a scapegoat. He later migrated to the United States, where he died on January 14, 1970.

[[Ma Bufang]] with his son Ma Jiyuan fled by an airplane from [[Qinghai]] to [[Chongqing]], then [[Hong Kong]]. In October 1949, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] urged him to return to the Northwest to resist the PLA, but he chose to migrate to [[Saudi Arabia]] with more than 200 relatives and subordinates, in the name of [[hajj]]. He later worked as first ambassador to Saudi Arabia for Rep. of China.

[[Ma Lin (warlord)|Ma Lin]]'s eldest son Ma Burong defected to the Communists after 1949 and donated 10,000 Yuan to support Chinese troops in the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.360doc.com/content/11/0917/16/112480_149020067.shtml 民国少数民族将军(组图)2 - 360Doc个人图书馆]&lt;/ref&gt; One of Ma Chengxiang's Hui officers, Ma Fuchen [[w:zh:馬輔臣|馬輔臣]], defected to the Communists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qh.xinhuanet.com/2009-11/10/content_18191427.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508182927/http://www.qh.xinhuanet.com/2009-11/10/content_18191427.htm |archivedate=May 8, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gs.xinhuanet.com/dfpd/2011-01/04/content_21782709.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618052044/http://www.gs.xinhuanet.com/dfpd/2011-01/04/content_21782709.htm |archivedate=June 18, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ma Guoliang's son Ma Tingbin became a member of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] after defecting to the Communists.

[[Image:Le Voyage dans la lune.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Man in the Moon is struck by a spacecraft in the 1902 fantasy film ''[[Le Voyage dans la Lune]]'']]
The '''Man in the Moon''' refers to any of several [[Pareidolia|pareidolic images]] of a human face, head or body that certain traditions recognize in the disc of the [[full moon]]. The images are composed of the dark areas of the [[Lunar mare|lunar ''maria'']], or "seas" and the lighter highlands of the lunar surface.

==Origin==
[[File:Man In The Moon2.png|thumb|right|200px|Possible interpretations of the Man in the Moon]]
There are various explanations for how the Man in the Moon came to be.

A longstanding European tradition holds that the man was banished to the moon for some crime. Christian lore commonly held that he is the man caught gathering sticks on the Sabbath and sentenced by God to death by stoning in the book of Numbers XV.32-36.&lt;ref&gt;Harley, the Rev. Timothy, FRAS (1885). ''[http://www.sacred-texts.com/astro/ml/ml00.htm Moon Lore]'', London; Swan Sonnenschein, Le Bas &amp; Lowry. p.21. Archived at [[Internet Sacred Text Archive]]. Retrieved March 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Germanic cultures thought he was a man caught stealing from a neighbor's hedgerow to repair his own.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} There is a Roman legend that he is a sheep-thief.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

One medieval Christian tradition claims him to be [[Cain]], the Wanderer, forever doomed to circle the Earth. [[Dante]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy#Inferno|Inferno]]''&lt;ref name="Inferno126"&gt;[[Dante]], [[The Divine Comedy]], [[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]], canto 20, [http://dante.dartmouth.edu/search_view.php?query=&amp;cmd=Search&amp;commentary%5B%5D=0&amp;language=any&amp;cantica=1&amp;canto=20&amp;line=126 line 126] and [http://dante.dartmouth.edu/search_view.php?query=&amp;cmd=Search&amp;commentary%5B%5D=0&amp;language=any&amp;cantica=1&amp;canto=20&amp;line=127 127]. The Dante Dartmouth Project contains the original text and centuries of commentary.&lt;/ref&gt; alludes to this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
For now doth Cain with fork of thorns confine
On either hemisphere, touching the wave
Beneath the towers of [[Seville]]. Yesternight
The moon was round.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is mentioned again in his ''[[The Divine Comedy#Paradiso|Paradise]]'':&lt;ref name="Paradise"&gt;Dante, The Divine Comedy, Paradiso, canto 2, [http://dante.dartmouth.edu/search_view.php?query=&amp;cmd=Search&amp;commentary%5B%5D=0&amp;language=any&amp;cantica=3&amp;canto=2&amp;line=51 line 51].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
But tell, I [[pray thee]], whence the gloomy spots
Upon this body, which below on earth
Give rise to talk of Cain in fabling quaint?&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is also a [[Talmud]]ic tradition that the image of [[Jacob]] is engraved on the moon,&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson, Elliot R. "The Face of Jacob in the Moon" in ''The Seductiveness of Jewish Myth: Challenge or Response?'' edited by S. Daniel Breslauer, Albany NY; SUNY Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; although no such mention appears in the [[Torah]].&lt;ref&gt;Harley, the Rev. Timothy, FRAS (1885). ''Moon Lore'', London; Swan Sonnenschein, Le Bas &amp; Lowry. P.21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harley, Timothy (1885). [http://www.sacred-texts.com/astro/ml/ml06.htm "II. THE MAN IN THE MOON."] [[Internet Sacred Text Archive]]. Retrieved March 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Lyly]] says in the prologue to his ''[[Endymion (play)|Endymion]]'' (1591), ''"There liveth none under the sunne, that knows what to make of the man in the moone."''&lt;ref&gt;Child, Clarence Griffin (1894). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fmAvAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA118 John Lyly and Euphuism]''. Erlangen [etc.]: A. Deichert. p. 118. {{OCLC|1014813258}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Norse mythology]], [[Máni]] is the male personification of the moon who crosses the sky in a horse-drawn carriage. He is continually pursued by the Great Wolf [[Hati Hróðvitnisson|Hati]] who catches him at [[Ragnarök]]. ''Máni'' simply means "Moon".

In [[Chinese mythology]], the goddess [[Chang'e]] is stranded upon the moon after foolishly consuming a double dose of an [[elixir of life|immortality potion]]. In some versions of the myth she is accompanied by Yu Tu, a [[moon rabbit]].&lt;ref&gt;Xueting Christine Ni (2018).

In [[Haida mythology]], the figure represents a boy gathering sticks. The boy's father had told him the moon's light would brighten the night, allowing the chore to be completed. Not wanting to gather sticks, the boy complained and ridiculed the moon. As punishment for his disrespect, the boy was taken from Earth and trapped on the moon.&lt;ref&gt;(1899). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=S8U4AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA704 Report of the 68th Meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science 1898]''. 1899. London: Murray. p. 704.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nosracines.ca/e/page.aspx?id=605508 ''The Hydah mission, Queen Charlotte's Islands''] Charles Harrison, [[Church Missionary Society]] c. 1884{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions==
There is a traditional belief that the Man in the Moon enjoyed drinking, especially claret. An old [[ballad]] runs (original spelling):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Our man in the moon drinks clarret,
With powder-beef, turnep, and carret.
If he doth so, why should not you
Drink until the sky looks blew?&lt;ref&gt;''The Man in the Moon drinks Claret'', as it was sung at the Court in Holy-well. ''Bagford Ballads'', ''Folio Collection'' in the [[British Museum]], vol. ii. No. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the English Middle Ages and renaissance, the moon was held to be the god of drunkards, and at least three London taverns were named "The Man in the Moone".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Poole |first=William |contribution=Introduction |title=The Man in the Moone |year=2009 |editor-last=Poole |editor-first=William |pages=13–62 |publisher=Broadview |isbn=978-1-55111-896-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The man in the moon is named in an early dated English [[nursery rhyme]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The man in the moon came tumbling down
And asked his way to [[Norwich]];
He went by the south and burnt his mouth
With supping cold pease porridge.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Examples and occurrence globally==
One tradition sees a figure of a man carrying a wide burden on his back. He is sometimes seen as accompanied by a small dog.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Ben (2010). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=MYasNyKQIxMC&amp;pg=PA143 Foothold in the Heavens: The Seventies]''. Springer Science &amp; Business Media. p. 143. {{ISBN|1441963421}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Various cultures recognise other examples of [[lunar pareidolia]], such as the [[Moon rabbit]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Terri Windling|Windling, Terri]]. "[https://www.webcitation.org/67AkEBAkB?url=http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/rrRabbits.html The Symbolism of Rabbits and Hares]" Retrieved September 1, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Northern Hemisphere, a common Western perception of the face has it that the figure's eyes are [[Mare Imbrium]] and [[Mare Serenitatis]], its nose is [[Sinus Aestuum]], and its open mouth is [[Mare Nubium]] and [[Mare Cognitum]].&lt;ref&gt;Skilling, Tom (January 20, 2017). "[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/weather/ct-wea-0121-asktom-20170120-column.html Ask Tom: What creates the 'man in the moon'? ]". ''Chicago Tribune''. Retrieved September 1, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; This particular human face can also be seen in tropical regions on both sides of the [[equator]]. However, the moon orientation associated with the face is observed less frequently—and eventually not at all—as one moves toward the [[South Pole]].

Conventionalized illustrations of the Man in the Moon seen in Western art often show a very simple face in the full moon, or a human profile in the crescent moon, corresponding to no actual markings.

"The Man in the Moon" can also refer to a mythological character said to live on or in the moon, but who is not necessarily represented by the markings on the face of the moon. An example is [[Yue-Laou]], from [[China|Chinese]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Xueting Christine Ni (2018). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ck9UDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA141 From Kuan Yin to Chairman Mao: The Essential Guide to Chinese Deities]''. Red Wheel/Weiser. p. 141. {{ISBN|1578636256}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Man in the Moone]], by [[Francis Godwin]] is one of the earliest novels thought of as containing several traits prototypical of [[science fiction]].

==Scientific explanation==
The Man in the Moon is made up of various lunar maria (which ones depend on the pareidolic image seen). These vast, flat spots on the Moon are called "maria" or "seas" because, for a long time, astronomers believed they were large bodies of water. They are large areas formed by lava that covered up old craters and then cooled, becoming smooth, [[basalt]] rock.&lt;ref&gt;Harrington, Philip S., and Edward Pascuzzi (1994). ''Astronomy for All Ages: Discovering the Universe through Activities for Children and Adults''. Old Saybrook, CT: Globe Pequot.&lt;/ref&gt;

The near side of the Moon, containing these maria that make up the man, is always facing Earth. This is due to a [[tidal locking]] or synchronous orbit. Thought to have occurred because of the gravitational forces partially caused by the Moon's oblong shape, its rotation has slowed to the point where it rotates exactly once on each trip around the Earth. This causes the near side of the Moon to always turn its face toward Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.caltech.edu/content/looking-man-moon | title=Looking at the Man in the Moon | website=www.caltech.edu | publisher=[[California Institute of Technology]] | accessdate=July 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mery Valencia''' (born August 28, 1953), also known as "La Señora", is a former Colombian drug trafficker. She led a narcotics operation based on Miami and was one of the leaders of the [[Cali Cartel]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/feds-smash-big-drug-ring-article-1.756535&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1997 and 1998, Valencia's organization made more than $180 million annually and distributed more than 12,000 kilos of cocaine.&lt;ref&gt;https://nypost.com/2000/06/08/queens-now-rule-where-kingpins-once-reigned-women-are-running-drug-rings-after-fall-of-colombian-cartels/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
{{Cali Cartel}}
Valencia was born in the slums of Cali, Colombia. She had multiple contacts with drug traffickers and became associated with the Cali Cartel, later moving to Miami in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;''Mery Valencia'': Episode 9 of Season 4 of ''[[Gangsters: America's Most Evil ]]''. See {{IMDb title|5481118/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, she began a mass distribution of cocaine and heroin across the United States. Many of her family members were involved in drug trafficking and Valencia owned hair salons and beauty parlors as a front for her drug trafficking organization.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capecodtimes.com/article/19991217/NEWS01/312179984?start=2&lt;/ref&gt; She maintained a vast network of cash houses and kept ledger books, recording all members of her organization.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1998/apr/23/local/me-42205&lt;/ref&gt; She later became a naturalized American citizen.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/female-druglord-faces-trial-n-y-article-1.799770&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 7, 1997, DEA agents and Brazilian authorities arrested Valencia at the airport in Rio de Janeiro. She had undergone extensive plastic surgery to alter her appearance and carried 13 passports with false names.&lt;ref&gt;http://panachereport.com/channels/more%20short%20stories/FemaleScarface.htm&lt;/ref&gt; After the Brazilian Supreme Court rejected the appeal to block extradition, Valencia was extradited to the United States and imprisoned in New York to await trial at the Manhattan Federal Court. On July 30, 1999, Valencia was convicted on drug trafficking charges and sentenced to life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/17/nyregion/woman-who-led-drug-ring-is-sentenced-to-life-in-prison.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2012, Valencia was released from the [[Federal Correctional Institution, Tallahassee|Federal Correctional Institution]] in Tallahassee.&lt;ref&gt;https://casetext.com/case/valencia-v-us-3&lt;/ref&gt; Her current whereabouts are unknown, though is speculated that she returned to Colombia.

'''Mbuvi Gideon Kioko Mike Sonko '''&lt;ref name="sonko" /&gt; commonly known as '''Mike Sonko''' or simply '''Sonko''' ([[Sheng slang|Sheng]] for "rich person" or "boss"),&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/03/03/kenyan.lawmaker.attire/index.html?iref=allsearch Kenyan politician thrown out of parliament for earrings] CNN, March 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; is a Kenyan politician who currently serves as the  Second Governor of [[Nairobi County|Nairobi]] since devolution.

== Early life and education ==
Mike Mbuvi Sonko was born in [[Mombasa]] in 1975. His father, Mzee Kivanguli was [[Kamba people|Kamba]] from Mua Hills [[Machakos County]]. He attended Kikowani Primary School before proceeding to Kwale High School.

== Makadara Member of Parliament and Nairobi Senator ==
Mike Sonko rose to national political prominence when he was elected as the Member of Parliament for [[Makadara Constituency]], [[Kenya]]  at the age of 35. The September 20, 2010 by-election was occasioned by a successful petition by Reuben Ndolo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theelephant.info/future/2017/08/07/the-sonkonization-of-nairobi-how-mike-sonko-is-reshaping-city-politics/|title=THE SONKONIZATION OF NAIROBI: How Mike Sonko Is Reshaping City Politics {{!}} The Elephant|date=2017-08-07|work=The Elephant|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iiec.or.ke/sites/default/files/MAKADARA%20RESULTS.pdf Makadara results]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} IIECK September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

After the inauguration of the new constitution of Kenya in 2010 and the creation of the county governments, Sonko announced his intention to run for Senator in Nairobi County. He became the First Senator of [[Nairobi]] after it was announced that, with 808,705 votes, he beat his closest competitor, [[Margaret Wanjiru]] of the [[Orange Democratic Movement]], who had garnered 525,822 votes, in the [[Kenyan general election, 2013|Nairobi senatorial election of 2013]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/news/politics/The-rise-and-rise-of-Servant-Sonko-in-politics-of-the-city-/1064-1722290-13q4qc8z/index.html|title=The rise and rise of Servant Sonko in politics of the city|work=Daily Nation|access-date=2017-11-29|language=en-UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike his time in parliament, where he gained notoriety for flaunting House Rules, including incidences of inappropriate dressing, the Senator mostly dressed in official attire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/03/03/kenyan.lawmaker.attire/index.html|title=Kenyan politician thrown out of parliament for earrings|last=CNN|first=From David McKenzie,|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time in the Senate, he formed the Sonko Rescue Team,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sonkorescue.blogspot.co.ke/|title=SONKO RESCUE TEAM|website=sonkorescue.blogspot.co.ke|access-date=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; an officially registered [[Non-Governmental Organization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2017/05/09/sonko-registers-rescue-team-as-ngo_c1558019|title=Sonko registers rescue team as NGO|work=The Star, Kenya|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; that provided government-like services to residents of Nairobi slums. The then governor of Nairobi County, Dr. Evans Kidero opposed the activities of the group, citing conflict of interests with the county government's operations. The Senator acquiesced and donated the vehicles to the county government after several weeks of tense public exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2015/09/15/sonko-disbands-rescue-team-in-kideros-support-at-fathers-funeral_c1205706|title=Sonko disbands rescue team in Kidero's support at father's funeral|work=The Star, Kenya|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nairobi Governor ==
As early as [https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2016/01/31/sonko-confirms-he-will-vie-for-nairobi-governor-in-2017_c1286343 January 2016], Mike Sonko had announced his intentions to run for Governor of Nairobi County in the [[Kenyan general election, 2017]]. After a grueling primary campaign against Peter Kenneth, Sonko ran for the Gubernatorial seat for Nairobi County with the [[Jubilee Party of Kenya]]  and defeated the incumbent [[Evans Kidero]] to become the second Governor of Nairobi.

== Remarkable event(s) ==
After the [[Westgate shopping mall attack]] in September 2013, Sonko claimed that he had warned the security services of a possible attack  three months prior to the incident .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author1=Bariyo, Nicholas | author2=Vogt, Heidi | author3=Bryan-Low, Cassell|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304526204579096713497161006 | title=Kenya Starts Probe in Wake of Mall Siege| date=25 September 2013| work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.kenyan-post.com/2013/09/shocking-mike-sonko-claims-he-alerted.html | title=Mike Sonko claims he alerted NSIS...| date=25 September 2013| work=The Kenyan Daily Post|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1967">'''Minnie Paterson''' (died 1911) was a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[heroine]] noted for her daring rescue of men from the [[Barquentine|barkentine]] (barque) ''[[Coloma (barquentine)|Coloma]]'' during a severe storm in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=D'Entremont|first1=Jeremy|title=Minnie Patterson: The Grace Darling of the Northwest|url=http://www.lhdigest.com/Digest/StoryPage.cfm?StoryKey=1728|website=lhdigest.com|publisher=Foghorn Publishing|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paterson was the wife of Tom Paterson, [[lighthouse keeper|keeper]] of the [[Cape Beale Light]] near [[Bamfield, British Columbia]].  On December 6, 1906, Keeper Paterson spotted the crippled ''Coloma'' being battered by waves and 80 knot winds near shore.  The [[telegraph]] line was broken, and the nearest hope was the [[lighthouse tender]] ''Quadra'', six miles away on [[Bamfield Inlet]].  While Tom kept watch over the ''Coloma'', Minnie went to seek help.

To reach the ''Quadra'', Mrs. Paterson had to wade through icy, waist-deep seawater and mud, over toppled trees, through rain and hail; four hours later she finally reached Bamfield, and with the aid of another keeper's wife, they rowed a skiff out to alert the crew of the ''Quadra''. Minnie insisted on immediately returning on foot to the lighthouse so that the mother of five could nurse her youngest unweaned baby. The ''Quadra'' eventually came to aid the ''Coloma'', putting out a [[longboat]] just as the barque was breaking up.  All on board were saved.

For her actions, the [[Dominion of Canada|Canadian government]] presented Minnie with a gold watch and a silver plate. Five years after the wreck she developed [[tuberculosis]] and died, her health permanently weakened by her heroic efforts on the trail.

'''Muhammad Kazem Rashid Maruf Sawalha''' (born 1961), also known by the name '''Abu Abada,''' is a senior [[Hamas]] activist.  He is the president of the [[British Muslim Initiative]] (BMI) and currently resides in [[London]], to which he fled from the West Bank in 1990, using forged documents to escape Israeli security authorities.

Before emigrating to the UK, Sawalha was Hamas’s [[West Bank]] military chief. In addition, he supervised the allocation and supply of large amounts of money to Hamas operatives, an activity that led to his being named in a 2004 [[United States of America|U.S.]] indictment against Hamas operative Muhammad Salah.

In addition to his work with Hamas and BMI, Sawalha is a frequent guest on the Islamist [[Al-Hiwar]] television station, and is affiliated with numerous Palestinian and Islamic charities. He has had a hand in organizing several of the [[flotilla]]s and land convoys attempting to reach the [[Gaza Strip]], through which he has transferred financial aid to Hamas. Sawalha helped found the Muslim Association of Britain and is also a trustee of the [[Finsbury Park Mosque]]. In addition, he signed the 2009 Istanbul Declaration, which reaffirms [[jihad]] as the proper means to achieving goals such as unifying [[Israel]] under [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] control.

==Early life and education==
Sawalha was born in [[Tubas]], [[West Bank]], in 1961. Sawalha studied religion at [[Al-Ahliyya Amman University|Amman University]] beginning in 1980.&lt;ref name="Hamas activities in Europe"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hamas continues initiating anti-Israeli activities in Europe|url=http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/data/pdf/PDF_10_034_2.pdf|publisher=Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early activities in the West Bank==
In 1988, after studying at Amman University, Sawalha returned to the West Bank, where he lived in Al-Bireh until 1990. He taught at a religious school in Al-Ram and later at the Islamic college (Kuliyat al-Da’wah) in [[Jerusalem]] and in [[Beit Hanina]].

Sawalha was a senior Hamas activist in the West Bank, and helped establish Hamas' West Bank headquarters in 1989-90. He also instructed regional Hamas commanders to set up military networks, establishing links between local operatives who had not yet been detained and operatives in the United States. After the exposure of his Hamas infrastructure in the West Bank, Israeli security forces declared him a wanted operative. Wanted by Israel, in October 1990 he used forged documents to escape to Jordan, and from there moved on to Britain.  He continues to carry out anti-Israeli activities from there.&lt;ref name="Hamas activities in Europe"/&gt;

==Activities in Britain==
During his first years in Britain, Sawalha continued his operations and sought to consolidate his position as a senior external operative for Hamas. He maintained contact with operatives in the United States, Syria and the West Bank.

Later he would see his active role in Hamas diminish, although his pro-Hamas and anti-Israeli activities have continued. He was a founder of the [[Muslim Association of Britain]] (MAB), and ran it from 1999 to 2007. Later he served as chairman of the British Muslim Initiative.&lt;ref name="BMB Leader"&gt;{{cite web|title=British Muslim Brotherhood Leader Is Resentful Of "The Evil Jew In Britain"|url=http://globalmbreport.org/?p=958|publisher=The Global Muslim Brotherhood Daily Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was described on a Hamas website as head of the International Committee to Lift the Siege on the Gaza Strip.&lt;ref name="Siege on Gaza"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sawalha: The Siege on Gaza must end now|url=http://www.palestine-info.co.uk/En/default.aspx?xyz=U6Qq7k%2bcOd87MDI46m9rUxJEpMO%2bi1s7dO2uUIm5o1neBMTu3XfYKwZChuoHbIRFXFIW3DZTgs4%2bf9KmVFwzNtlZzOEhD7qKs8WBqDAVaEDNaRHoCwn2IfgEnKPAYAYy7zGW%2fLqdv8I%3d|publisher=The Palestinian Information Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 he reportedly was named deputy chairman of the Popular Committee in Support of the Palestinian People. He also signed the 2009 Istanbul Declaration.&lt;ref name="British Muslim leader urged"&gt;{{cite news|last=Doward|first=Jamie|title=British Muslim leader urged to quit over Gaza|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/08/daud-abdullah-gaza-middle-east|newspaper=The Guardian|date=7 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sawalha has been involved in organizing flotillas and land convoys to the Gaza Strip while in Britain.&lt;ref name="Interview with coordinator"&gt;{{cite news|title=Interview with Mohammed Sawalha, Gaza aid flotilla coordinator, London|url=http://gazatvnews.com/2011/06/interview-with-mohammed-sawalha-gaza-aid-flotilla-coordinator-london/|newspaper=Gaza TV News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Mavi Marmara Metaphor"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rich|first=Dave|title=ONLINE Only: The Mavi Marmara Metaphor|url=http://standpointmag.co.uk/node/3210/full|publisher=Standpoint}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aid convoy"&gt;{{cite news|title=Aid convoy sets off for Gaza|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2010/05/2010522133016818451.html|newspaper=Al Jazeera|date=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a BBC program alleged that he had directed funds both for Hamas' armed and missionary wings.&lt;ref name="Panorama BBC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Faith, hate and charity: Transcript|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/panorama/5234586.stm|newspaper=BBC News|date=1 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sawalha has been engaged in [[lawfare]] against Israel, which takes advantage of Britain's universal jurisdiction law to file criminal complaints against Israeli officials.&lt;ref name="Lawfare in the UK"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lawfare in the UK : Who Is Behind It This Time?|url=http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/1545/lawfare-in-the-uk-who-is-behind-it-this-time|publisher=Gatestone Institute}}{{unreliable source?|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2004 U.S. indictment of Salah==
A [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] press release names Sawalha as a co-conspirator in the 2004 indictment of Muhammad Salah. Among the aliases mentioned in the indictment are “Muhammad Khadhem Sawalha,” “Abu Obeida,” “Abu Ubada,” “Abu Ubaydah,” “Abu Ubeida,” and “Abu Obadah”. It was reported that Saleh met and spoke with Abu Marzook and Sawalha, who had been in charge of Hamas operations within the West Bank, regarding the need for a resurgence in Hamas operations in the West Bank. During the meeting, Sawalha identified specific Hamas members who could be used to revitalize Hamas's  activities, including Awadallah and [[Saleh al-Arouri]].&lt;ref name="Finance Hamas Terror Abroad"&gt;{{cite news|title=Chicago and Washington, D.C., Area Men Among Three Indicted in Racketeering Conspiracy in U.S. to Finance Hamas Terror Abroad|newspaper=Department of Justice Documents|date=20 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sawalha told Salah on several occasion to provide money to Hamas operatives on the West Bank, and Salah passed along information to Sawalha as well. Around December 1992, a U.S.-based Hamas member gave pictures of co-conspirator Adel Awadallah, who was on the run from Israeli authorities, to Salah so that Salah could have a false [[passport]] made for Awadallah.&lt;ref name="Finance Hamas Terror Abroad"/&gt; Sawalha reportedly told Salah explicit instructions as to how to dress and behave when distributing funds to local Hamas operatives.&lt;ref name="Panorama BBC"/&gt;

On January 13, 1993, en route from the U.S. to the Middle East, Salah met in London with Sawalha, who instructed Salah to provide money to various Hamas members. Salah was eventually indicted for his Hamas role, and in January 1995 pleaded guilty to participating in Hamas affairs, admitting that he had represented Sawalha and had been appointed head of military operations in the West Bank at the request of Abu Marzook and Sawalha. Another report mentioned in the indictment noted the provision of $400,000 to one 'Brother Mohammed Kadhim,' an alias for Sawalha.&lt;ref name="Court case"&gt;{{cite web|title=IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS EASTERN DIVISION|url=http://www.investigativeproject.org/documents/case_docs/170.pdf|publisher=investigativeproject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sawalha spoke out in 2004 against Israel's [[assassination]] of [[Sheikh Yassin]], the spiritual leader of Hamas, saying that Shaykh Ahmad Yassin “lived with his people and died in the service of their cause.”&lt;ref name=Assassination&gt;{{cite news|title=Assassination|newspaper=IRNA|date=24 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==British Muslim Initiative==
Sawalha is one of the founders of the BMI, which describes itself as follows: “Formed by justice, peace and human rights campaigners, the British Muslim Initiative (BMI) is an organisation which seeks to fight racism and Islamophobia, combat the challenges Muslims face around the world, encourage Muslim participation in British public life, and improve relations between the West and the Muslim world.” The BMI supported the [[Global March to Jerusalem]].
 
In 2009, demonstrators protesting the Gaza attacks clashed with police, and nearly all those arrested were Muslims. Sawalha questioned this disproportion, and also questioned the detainees' treatment. He said the BMI “encourages Muslims to express their feelings and ambitions and frustrations only through political and legal processes. But if anything sends the message that Muslims cannot express themselves through political processes, and they will not be dealt with like others, it will give more strength to the fringes within the community who say democracy and the political system doesn't apply to Muslims in this country. This will only increase the frustration and sense of alienation among these people.”&lt;ref name="Sent to jail"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sent to jail for throwing a single bottle|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/mar/13/gaza-protesters-sent-prison|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sawalha and the BMI supported the January 2012 developments in [[Bangladesh]], condemning the [[International Crimes Tribunal (Bangladesh)|International Crimes Tribunal]].&lt;ref name="Ghulam Azam"&gt;{{cite web|title=BMI condemns state-terrorism in Bangladesh and arrest of prominent leader Ghulam Azam|url=http://bminitiative.net/press-releases/372-bmi-condemns-state-terrorism-in-bangladesh-and-arrestof-%20prominent-leader-ghulam-azam|publisher=BMI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gaza flotillas==
After the 2009 Gaza flotilla, Sawalha said that the next convoy would avoid the type of confrontation that had occurred with Egypt: “the confrontation will be directly with the Zionist enemy itself on the high seas.”&lt;ref name="Turks helping Hamas"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fendel|first=Hillel|title=Turks helping Hamas prepare Gaza port for "protest flotilla"|publisher=Arutz 7 Radio via BBC Monitoring Middle East. May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviewed on Iranian [[PressTV]] about the 2011 flotilla, Sawalha said: “Now the Israelis have to understand that their policies and crimes will not make us turn away and go back. We will continue under any circumstances until we break the siege on Gaza.”&lt;ref name="Activists Gaza"&gt;{{cite web|title=Activists determined to break Gaza siege.|publisher=PressTV. 26 June 2011.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sawalha organized the autumn 2010 LifeLine 5 convoy to Gaza, which reportedly delivered $5 million of aid to the Hamas government.&lt;ref name="Birawi: Lifeline carries 5 million dollars worth of aid"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sawalha: The Siege on Gaza must end now|url=http://uprootedpalestinians.wordpress.com/2010/10/22/sawalha-the-siege-on-gaza-must-end-now/|newspaper=The Palestinian Information Center|date=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His Guantanamo [[Internment Serial Number]] was 497.
American [[counter-terror]] analysts estimate he was born in 1983, in [[Al Arib, Saudi Arabia|Al Arib]], Saudi Arabia.

==Identity==

The official documents from the [[US Department of Defense]], and from the [[Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia, Washington DC]] transliterate Al Subii's name differently:
* His name was transliterated as '''Nasir Maziyad Abdallah Al Qurayshi Al Subii''' on the official lists of names released by the [[US Department of Defense]].&lt;ref name=DoDList2&gt;[http://www.dod.mil/news/May2006/d20060515%20List.pdf list of prisoners (.pdf)], ''[[US Department of Defense]]'', May 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DoDList&gt;[http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/detainees/detainee_list.pdf list of prisoners (.pdf)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930171245/http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/detainees/detainee_list.pdf |date=2007-09-30 }}, ''[[US Department of Defense]]'', April 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Combatant Status Review Tribunal==

Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the [[Geneva Conventions]] to captives from [[the war on terror]]. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a [[competent tribunal]]s to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of [[prisoner of war]] status.

Subsequently the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] instituted the [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]]s. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were ''lawful combatants''—rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an [[enemy combatant]].

==Habeas corpus==

The record shows this captive had at least two habeas corpus petitions submitted on his behalf.

===Nasir Maziyad Abdallah Al Qurayshi Al Asubayi v. George W. Bush===

A [[writ of habeas corpus]]. [[Nasir Maziyad Abdallah Al Qurayshi Al Asubayi v. George W. Bush]], 
was submitted on Nasir Maziyad Abdallah Al Qurayshi Al Asubayi's behalf.&lt;ref name=GuantanamoHabeasNasirMaziyadAbdallahAlQurayshiAlAsubayiVGeorgeWBush&gt;

| date=18 October 2005
| pages=27–42

| accessdate=2008-05-05
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In response, on 18 October 2005,
the Department of Defense released fifteen
pages of unclassified documents related to his Combatant Status Review Tribunal.

On 19 October 2004 
[[Tribunal panel 13]] confirmed his "enemy combatant" status.

His [[Personal Representative (CSRT)|Personal Representative]] met with him, for half an hour, on 13 October 2004.  The decision memo records:
&lt;!-- I am embedding this quote in a table, not a {{quotation}} template, because one can't include {{sic}} templates in a {{quotation}} template.  And one can't include octothorps.  --&gt;
:{| class="wikitable"
| 
:The Personal Representative asked the detainee if he wanted to participate in the Tribunal. The detainee would not answer any questions, only rambled. Due to the detainee's uncooperative and unresponsive behavior, along with his arrogant and belligerent demeanor, the Personal Representative could only conclude that the detainee refused to participate.  The detainee did not request any witnesses nor did he request any classified or unclassified documents be produced. The detainee's sole unsworn statement to his Personal Representative was that all evidence against him was false.
|}

===Al-Subaiy v. Bush===

Another writ of habeas corpus, [[Al-Subaiy v. Bush]], where he was known as '''"Nasser Mazyad Abdullah Al-Subaiy"'''', was submitted on his behalf.&lt;ref name="MotionToDismiss"/&gt;

==Administrative Review Board hearing==

Detainees who were determined to have been properly classified as "enemy combatants" were scheduled to have their dossier reviewed at annual [[Administrative Review Board]] hearings. The Administrative Review Boards weren't authorized to review whether a detainee qualified for POW status, and they weren't authorized to review whether a detainee should have been classified as an "enemy combatant".

They were authorized to consider whether a detainee should continue to be detained by the United States, because they continued to pose a threat—or whether they could safely be repatriated to the custody of their home country, or whether they could be set free.

==Guantanamo record==

There is no record that Al Subii chose to participate in either his Combatant Status Review Tribunal or Administrative Review Board.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

==Repatriation==

Al Subii was repatriated  on February 21, 2007, along with six other Saudis.&lt;ref name=SaudiEmbassy070221/&gt;&lt;ref name=Upi070222/&gt;
The seven men were detained, without charge, in [[Hayer Prison]], while Saudi justice officials determined whether they had violated any Saudi laws.&lt;ref name=ArabNews070224&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4523">'''Nasser Weddady''' ({{lang-ar|'''ناصر ودادي'''}}) is a Mauritanian-American activist known for his social [[media activism]] during the [[Arab Spring]].

==Biography==
Weddady is the son of a Mauritanian diplomat who served as Mauritania's ambassador to Ethiopia, Nigeria, Libya, Benin, and Syria. Consequently, Weddady grew up primarily in Syria and Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leigh|first=Karen|title=Behind the Arab Revolts, an Activist Quietly Pulling Strings From Boston|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/01/behind-the-arab-revolts-an-activist-quietly-pulling-strings-from-boston/251786/2/|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He speaks fluent Arabic, English, French, Spanish, and Hebrew.

When his parents returned to [[Mauritania]] in the 1990s he became involved with the country’s opposition movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leigh|first=Karen|title=Behind the Arab Revolts, an Activist Quietly Pulling Strings From Boston|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/01/behind-the-arab-revolts-an-activist-quietly-pulling-strings-from-boston/251786/2/|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Weddady left the country and sought asylum in the United States.

==Career==
In 2007, Weddady joined the [[American Islamic Congress]] as Director of Civil Rights Outreach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Markon|first=Jerry|title=Seeking cooperation, but also after convictions|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/seeking-cooperation-but-also-after-convictions/2011/08/19/gIQA9tmMqJ_story_4.html|work=Washington Post|accessdate=15 February 2013|date=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, he aided prosecutors in the [[Tarek Mehanna]] case who were seeking to understand the sources of radicalization in the Islamic community.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/seeking-cooperation-but-also-after-convictions/2011/08/19/gIQA9tmMqJ_story_4.html Seeking cooperation, but also after convictions] Jerry Markon, [[Washington Post]], August 31, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He left the AIC in April 2014.

In 2011, during the events of the Arab spring Weddady used Twitter, Facebook and blogs to train activists in the Middle East and draw media attention to critical issues and developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The World|title=Arab Spring Activist Nasser Weddady Reacts to Wave of Protests|url=http://www.theworld.org/2012/09/arab-spring-nasser-weddady/|work=PRI's the World|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[SocialFlow]], the social media tracker, ranked him as one of the top four most influential Twitter users during the uprisings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leigh|first=Karen|title=Behind the Arab Revolts, an Activist Quietly Pulling Strings From Boston|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/01/behind-the-arab-revolts-an-activist-quietly-pulling-strings-from-boston/251786/2/|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weddady has also been credited with contributing to the release of numerous imprisoned activists and bloggers in the MENA region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leigh|first=Karen|title=Behind the Arab Revolts, an Activist Quietly Pulling Strings From Boston|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/01/behind-the-arab-revolts-an-activist-quietly-pulling-strings-from-boston/251786/2/|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Weddady co-edited with journalist [[Sohrab Ahmari]] the anthology ''Arab Spring Dreams'', a collection of the best essays from the [[Dream Deferred Essay Contest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Golia|first=Maria|title=Taking in the Arab Spring|url=http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/article1108763.ece|work=The Times Literary Supplement|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weddady has been published in the New York Times, The International Herald Tribune, Wall Street Journal, Boston Globe, and Baltimore Sun and has appeared on numerous media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boudjalis|first=Chloe|title=Exclusive Interview with Nasser Weddady|url=http://www.whitepinepress.org/news/archive/2011-02-24/nasserweddady.html|work=White Pine Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasser Weddady has stated in his bio that he is involved with law enforcement agencies, such as the FBI, and advised  on "radicalization" activities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.empowerpeace.org/documents/W2W2010SpeakerBios.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], Donnelly helped develop the [[U.S. Navy]]'s [[Bat (guided bomb)|Bat]], the first "[[Precision-guided munition|smart bomb]]" in the history of warfare, which his Navy squadron dropped on Japanese ships in [[Borneo]]'s [[Balikpapan]] Harbor in 1945.&lt;ref name="Interview of Mr. Paul Donnelly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bathead.com"/&gt;

==Biography==

Donnelly was born March 28, 1923 in [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]], the son of Irish immigrant David Roy Donnelly and Magdalena (née Schreiber) Donnelly, born in Germany.  He graduated from Altoona High School in 1940 (and received its Distinguished Alumni Award in 2000). He left to join the Navy in 1942, and completed courses in electronics at [[Grove City College]]. He also attended the Navy's electronics and guided missile technical schools.&lt;ref name="Landing Mission Press Kit 1968 p. 209"&gt;''Apollo 11 Lunar Landing Mission Press Kit'' (July 6, 1968), NASA, Washington, DC, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicknamed "Red" for his hair, Donnelly was stationed at the [[National Bureau of Standards]] in Washington, D.C., working in electronics for classified guided ordnance development, including the Bat, at the Navy's National Hydraulic Laboratory.  On [[Battle of Tarakan (1945)|April 28, 1945]], his VPB-109 Squadron of [[PB4Y-2 Privateer]] bombers, known as the Bat Squadron,&lt;ref name="Interview of Mr. Paul Donnelly"&gt;Butler, Dr. Orville "Interview of Mr. Paul Donnelly" (August 23, 2004), The KSC Oral History Program, Kennedy Space Center, Fla.&lt;/ref&gt; dropped several SWOD-9 Bats, the first fully automatic (radar) guided bombs used in warfare, on Japanese shipping in Borneo's Balikpapan Harbor. The attack sank three ships and destroyed a large oil tank.&lt;ref name="bathead.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pedersen|first=Scott|url=http://bathead.com/asmbat.html|title=ASM-N-2 BAT Glide Bomb|work=|accessdate=2009-11-16|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611034438/http://www.bathead.com/asmbat.html|archivedate=2009-06-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donnelly advanced to the rate of [[Chief petty officer#United States|chief petty officer]] and was awarded nine Navy medals.

After the war, Donnelly became a Navy civil service employee.  He was assigned to aircraft and ordnance testing at the Naval Air Ordnance Test Station at Chincoteague Island, Virginia and the [[Naval Air Station Patuxent River]], Mayland,&lt;ref name="Landing Mission Press Kit 1968 p. 209"/&gt; where he first met [[Alan Shepard]], [[Pete Conrad]], [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]], [[Jim Lovell]] and other future astronauts.  In 1951, he was awarded an electronic engineer-equivalent degree by the [[United States Civil Service Commission|U.S. Civil Service Commission]].

===NASA career===

Donnelly had worked at the National Hydraulic Laboratory for [[Hugh L. Dryden]], who became NASA deputy administrator in 1958.  Dryden recommended Donnelly to [[Robert R. Gilruth]], head of NASA's [[Space Task Group]] at Langley, Virginia, who hired him.&lt;ref name="Interview of Mr. Paul Donnelly"/&gt;

Gilruth sent Donnelly to [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida]] in 1959, where he served as a capsule (spacecraft) test conductor for all [[Project Mercury]] and [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] launches.  He became chief test conductor for the [[Johnson Space Center|Manned Spacecraft Center]]'s Florida Operations during the Gemini program, responsible for planning, scheduling and directing all manned spacecraft pre-launch and launch acceptance tests.  In 1964, he was named launch operations manager for KSC, with oversight of both spacecraft and launch vehicles;&lt;ref name="Landing Mission Press Kit 1968 p. 209"/&gt; reporting to [[Rocco Petrone]], KSC director of launch operations.[[File:Paul C. Donnelly - Apollo 11 rollout.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Donnelly at the [[Apollo 11]] rollout at [[Launch Complex 39|LC-39]] on May 20, 1969]]

Donnelly was the launch operations manager on January 27, 1967, when fire swept through the ''[[Apollo 1]]'' command module, killing the crew; and served as an observer for the Apollo 204 Review Board's Advisory Group later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Charles D.|last1=Benson|first2=William Barnaby|last2=Faherty|title=Moonport: A History of Apollo Launch Facilities and Operations|publisher=US Government Printing Office|year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As launch operations manager in KSC's Test Operations Office during Apollo, he was responsible for the checkout of all manned space vehicles, including boosters and spacecraft, from ''[[Apollo 7]]'' in 1968 through the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]] in 1975. By 1973, he became associate director, launch operations.

In 1976, Donnelly was project manager of Third Century America, a science and technology display at KSC commemorating the [[U.S. Bicentennial]].  In 1977, he led the NASA team conducting [[Approach and Landing Tests|drop tests]] of the [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|space shuttle ''Enterprise'']] at the [[Dryden Flight Research Center]], California.

===Later years===

In 1978, Donnelly retired from NASA as director, Space Transportation Systems Processing at KSC, and joined United Space Boosters, Inc. as vice president, Field Operations-Florida.&lt;ref name="Interview of Mr. Paul Donnelly"/&gt; The firm was prime contractor for [[space shuttle solid rocket booster]] (SRB) assembly, integration, checkout and refurbishment; and for building two [[NASA recovery ship|SRB recovery ships]]. He retired from USBI in 1989 at age 65.

Donnelly was a trustee and former four-term president of the Missile, Space and Range Pioneers, and a founder and two-term chairman of the board of the Astronauts Memorial Foundation. He received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[National Space Club]].

Donnelly died on March 12, 2014 in [[Melbourne, Florida]].

==Family==

Donnelly married Margaret Mary Boyle in 1944, a nurse who once treated [[Arthur Godfrey]].  Their daughters are Penny Martin, Pamela Gene McLeod (Vincent), and Paula Bleakley (McLeod). They had nine grandchildren, Michele Foster, Jackie Nuvy, Christopher Martin, Justin, Nick and Blaise Bleakley; Conor, Kevin and Michael McLeod; and five wonderful great-grandchildren, Austin Nuvy, Amber Nuvy, Cody Nuvy, Caden Martin, Gus Bleakley. He had 12 brothers and sisters.

==NASA medals==

Donnelly received six NASA medals, including two [[NASA Distinguished Service Medal|Distinguished Service Medals]] (1973, for his role in the Apollo program; and 1981, for [[STS-1]]), three [[NASA Exceptional Achievement Medal|Exceptional Achievement Medals]] (1969, for ''Apollo 8''; 1969, for ''Apollo 11''; and 1978, for shuttle Approach and Landing Tests), and an [[NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal|Outstanding Leadership Medal]] (1976, for Third Century America).&lt;ref name="Interview of Mr. Paul Donnelly"/&gt;

'''Raka Levajac''' (1777–1883), known simply as '''[[Raka Levajac]]''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Рака Левајац}}), was a Serbian ''[[Vojvoda]]'' (military commanders) of [[Serbian Revolution]]ary forces in both [[First Serbian Uprising]] and [[Second Serbian Uprising]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]].

==Biography==
He was a participant in the Ostruznica Assembly, the very first national assembly of Serbia on 24–28 April 1804 and [[Karadjordje]]'s delegation at the negotiations in Zemun in 1804. He participated in the battles on [[Battle_of_Mišar|Mišar]] (1806), [[Battle_of_Ljubić|Ljubić]] and Dublje (1815).
[[File:Battle_at_Dublje_26_July_1815.jpg |thumb|right| 200px | Battle at Dublje 26 July 1815]]
After the victory of the rebels near Sjenica and [[Battle_of_Suvodol|Suvodol]], in the spring of 1809, Raka Levajac crossed over Kolašin with [[Milan_Obrenović_(revolutionary)|Milan Obrenović]] and 3500 rebels heading towards the Montenegrin border,&lt;br&gt;
[[Karađorđe]] appealed to the confraternity of the Montenegrins and Bosnians to restore the unity of the Serbian nation, he sent a diplomatic delegation consisting of [[Čolak-Anta Simeonović]] and Raka Levajac as advance party to Montenegro.&lt;ref&gt;A History of the Balkan Peoples, p. 95 Ardent Media&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
According to historians he resented prince Milos Obrenović and prepared a rebellion against him in 1824 and 1825, he also clashed with [[Karađorđe]] refusing to carry his order to arrest [[hajduk]]s in [[Uzice]]&lt;br&gt;

He died in 1833 and was buried by the church in Mojsinje. A new church was built in 1935 but his tombstone disappeared in the process. 
On May 2, 2009, a new memorial plaque was unveiled at the Mojsinje church by Bishop Hrizostom Stolic.

==Legacy==

Milan Đ. Milićević mentions him in his "Monument". One street in Gornji Milanovac is named after him. In November 2008, Goran R. Levajac published the "Vecernje novosti" phenomenon "Morava Duke Raka Levajac" in six parts.

'''Robert Wilks''' (''c.'' 1665 – 27 September 1732) was a [[British people|British]] [[actor]] and [[Actor-manager|theatrical manager]] who was one of the leading managers of [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in its heyday of the 1710s.  He was, with [[Colley Cibber]] and [[Thomas Doggett]], one of the "triumvirate" of actor-managers that was denounced by [[Alexander Pope]] and caricatured by [[William Hogarth]] as leaders of the decline in theatrical standards and degradation of the stage's literary tradition.

[[File:Hogarth-rehearsal (2).png|thumb|right|260px|A print by [[William Hogarth]] entitled ''[[A Just View of the British Stage]]'' from 1724 depicting Robert Wilks, [[Colley Cibber]], and [[Barton Booth]] rehearsing a pantomime play with puppets enacting a prison break down a privy.  The "play" is composed of nothing but special effects, and the scripts for ''Hamlet'', ''inter al.'', are toilet paper.]]

The family was based for many generations in [[Bromsgrove]], [[Worcestershire]]. His great-uncle, [[Judge Wilks]], had served [[Charles I of England]] during the [[English Civil War]], for whom he raised a troop at his own expense. After [[Oliver Cromwell]] won the civil war, Wilks' father moved to [[Dublin]], where Robert Wilks was born.

He was a clerk to [[Robert Southwell (diplomat)|Robert Southwell]] until he joined the [[William III of England|Williamite]] army.  As soon as he was discharged from the army, he worked in the Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin from 1691—1693.  According to Wilks's version of the story, he had first acted when his army company put on an amateur ''[[Othello]]'', and he was so successful that he took up acting as a career.  In 1693, [[Christopher Rich (theatre manager)|Christopher Rich]], manager of Drury Lane, hired him to work in [[London]].  The same year, he married Elizabeth Knapton.

In 1698, he was back in Dublin to perform in [[George Etherege]] plays, and he was so popular that he, according to his story, had to escape to London, and the next year he began his collaboration of [[George Farquhar]].  Farquhar and Wilks were close friends, and the two traveled from Dublin to London together.  In 1699, Wilks appeared in Farquhar's ''The Constant Couple'' as Harry Wildair.  It was a role that became Wilks's signature, and it made him a heartthrob among the young ladies of London.  For the rest of his life Harry Wildair would be Wilks's alter ego, and Wilks would appear in the starring roles in Farquhar plays.

At Drury Lane, Christopher Rich ruled the theater with a Machiavellian hand.  In 1702, Rich had to choose between Wilks and George Powell, the director of rehearsals.  The power struggle went Wilks's way, and Powell left for [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] while Wilks was promoted to director of rehearsals.  This put Wilks in a powerful position within the theater, and when the actor's strike occurred in 1706, Wilks was well placed to win.  Rich was accused of taking one third of all the actors' profits, and the leading actors walked out for the [[Her Majesty's Theatre|Queen's Theatre]] at the Haymarket (now Her Majesty's Theatre).  Rich, and his son, [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]], responded by staging [[opera]] and [[pantomime]].

At the Haymarket, Wilks was a star.  He took the major roles in ''[[1 Henry IV]], [[Hamlet]], [[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', and ''[[The Way of the World]]''.  He also debuted Farquhar's ''The Beaux' Stratagem.''  In 1709, Wilks, with Cibber, Thomas Doggett, and [[Anne Oldfield]] joined [[Owen Swiny]] in managing the Haymarket.  The next year, the group won their struggle and was brought back to Drury Lane, and in 1711 they became the actor-managers of Drury Lane.  Thomas Doggett, according to Colley Cibber's somewhat unreliable memoir, forbade any woman being part of the group of managers, and Owen Swiny decided to return to the Haymarket, and so the remaining actor managers formed a "triumvirate."  These three managers had profitable and difficult positions, and it is likely that from 1711 to 1714 the shares of the triumvirate never made less than the fantastic sum of £1,000 a year.

In 1713, [[Barton Booth]] replaced Doggett as actor-manager, and in 1714 [[Richard Steele]] joined them and got the theatre a royal patent.  This patent allowed the company to present [[Charles Johnson (writer)|Charles Johnson's]] ''The Country Lasses'' without a license in 1715, and from then on the patent itself was an extremely valuable commodity.  Upon Steele's death in 1729, the three current members of the triumvirate got a one-third share in the patent.

The managers were very busy with the details of production, but they were as busy as actors.  Wilks acted one hundred and forty performances in the 1721-2 season, for example, and Wilks rarely toured out of London (with the exception of a single trip to Dublin in 1711).  Wilks was one of the mainstays of Drury Lane, both as a manager and, even more, as an attractive male lead.  Colley Cibber, whose autobiography portrays himself as a voice of reason and calm, paints Wilks as a vain and tempestuous personality, and it is possible to believe Cibber's complaints about others without believing his praise of himself.  Alexander Pope satirized Wilks, along with Cibber and Doggett, in ''[[The Dunciad]]'', both versions.  William Hogarth depicted Wilks as a man busy making a pantomime play of a jail break while using scripts for ''Hamlet'' as toilet paper.  The actor managers responded to the increasing move for "spectacle" plays (see [[Augustan drama]] for context) and quick productions with low costs, and thus the triumvirate, in particular, was frequently satirized for cheapening the stage.

He died in 1732 in London and was buried in St. Paul's Church, [[Covent Garden]].  He had made an exceptional amount of money in his life, but, upon his death, he left his second wife virtually nothing except a share in the Drury Lane patent.

In 2000, Rickford and his father co-wrote ''Spoken Soul: The Story of Black English'', a book about African-American Vernacular English&lt;ref name=SFE1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DM&amp;p_theme=dm&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0ED8226258995030&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Father and son authors make case for acceptance of Ebonics |last=Wagner |first=Venise |date=April 30, 2000 |work=[[The San Francisco Examiner]] |accessdate=November 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which won the [[American Book Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=American Booksellers Association |title=The American Book Awards&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;Before Columbus Foundation [1980–2012] |year=2013 |url=http://www.bookweb.org/btw/awards/The-American-Book-Awards---Before-Columbus-Foundation.html |publisher=BookWeb |quote='''''2000''''' [...] ''Spoken Soul: The Story of Black English, '''John Russell Rickford''' and '''Russell John Rickford''''' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313174235/http://bookweb.org/btw/awards/The-American-Book-Awards---Before-Columbus-Foundation.html |archivedate=March 13, 2013 |accessdate=September 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Spoken Soul" was coined by author [[Claude Brown]] in the 1960s and pays homage to the rhythmic, poetic qualities of African-American English.&lt;ref name=SpokenSoul&gt;{{cite book|author1=John R.

In 2001,&lt;ref name=jouvay/&gt; Rickford left his job in Philadelphia and moved into his parents' [[Garage (house)|garage]] to write the first, and to date only, in-depth biography of [[Betty Shabazz]].&lt;ref name=Eymer/&gt; An effort that spanned five and a half years, ''Betty Shabazz: A Remarkable Story of Survival and Faith Before and After Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'' was published in 2003.&lt;ref name=jouvay/&gt; Writing in ''[[The Crisis]]'', [[William Jelani Cobb]] called Rickford's work "a thorough, insightful and engaging book, befitting its enigmatic—and ultimately heroic—subject".&lt;ref name=WJCobb/&gt;

In 2002, Rickford enrolled at [[Columbia University]], studying for a master's degree in [[African-American studies]] under [[Manning Marable]].&lt;ref name=TheRoot2011&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theroot.com/a-eulogy-for-manning-marable-1790863386 |title=A Eulogy for Manning Marable |last=Rickford |first=Russell |date=April 4, 2011 |work=[[The Root (magazine)|The Root]] |accessdate=April 29, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DartmouthCollegeKing&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~mlk/calendar/what_matters.html |title=What Matters to Me and Why? |date=January 18, 2011 |publisher=[[Dartmouth College]] |accessdate=November 26, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121043323/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~mlk/calendar/what_matters.html# |archive-date=2012-01-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2003 and 2004, he contributed research to Marable's [[Malcolm X]] Project and, according to Marable, "was instrumental in setting up many oral histories and interviews" with Malcolm X's contemporaries.&lt;ref name=MarableMalcolmX&gt;{{cite book|author=Manning Marable|title=Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LO3OvdrIW5wC&amp;pg=PT4|accessdate=November 26, 2011|date=April 4, 2011|publisher=Penguin Books Ltd|isbn=978-0-7139-9895-5|page=492}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marable credited Rickford with coining the term "Malcolmology" to describe the way in which African Americans rediscovered Malcolm X as a cultural icon after he was embraced by major [[hip-hop]] artists of the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name=MarableSouls&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/ccbh/pdfs/marable_souls_mx.pdf |title=Rediscovering Malcolm X's Life: A Historian's Adventures in Living History |last=Marable |first=Manning |work=Souls |volume=7 |issue=1 |date=Winter 2005 |pages=24–29 |accessdate=November 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rickford completed his doctorate in history at Columbia in 2009.&lt;ref name=DartmouthCollegeKing/&gt; His dissertation won that year's Bancroft Dissertation Award. His research concerns African-American politics after the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. In an interview, he said he was trying to answer the question, "Why did [[black nationalism]] become increasingly conservative towards the end of the 20th century?"&lt;ref name=Baum&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedartmouth.com/article/2009/11/despite-cuts-new-profs-join-college-faculty |title=Despite cuts new profs. join College faculty |last=Baum |first=Ann |date=November 10, 2009 |work=[[The Dartmouth]] |accessdate=June 20, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rickford joined the [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] faculty in 2009,&lt;ref name=Baum/&gt; moving to Cornell in 2014. In early 2011, he edited a collection of writings by Marable entitled ''Beyond Boundaries''.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;{{cite web |url=http://diverseeducation.com/article/14988/ |title=Manning Marable Remembered as Public Intellectual and Activist |last=Watson |first=Jamal Eric |date=April 5, 2011 |work=Diverse Issues in Higher Education |accessdate=November 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Described by his former mentor as "one of the most talented and insightful" members of a new generation of black intellectuals,&lt;ref name=Marable2011&gt;{{cite book|author1=Manning Marable|author2=Russell Rickford (editor)|title=Beyond Boundaries: The Manning Marable Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UPvUQgAACAAJ|accessdate=November 26, 2011|date=April 30, 2011|publisher=Paradigm Publishers|isbn=978-1-59451-861-4|page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Rickford completed a history of [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-Africanist]] private schools during the [[Black Power]] era titled ''We Are an African People: Independent Education, Black Power, and the Radical Imagination''.&lt;ref name=Cornell/&gt; Presently he teaches undergraduate seminars and supervises graduate reading at Cornell.&lt;ref name=Cornell/&gt;

On 20 July 2012, Donaghy and her former ''Sugababes'' colleagues, Buena and Buchanan, confirmed their reunion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv.co.uk/news/mks/360117-mutya-keisha-siobhan-mks-sugababes-reunion Original Sugababes Confirm Reunion!] MTV. 20 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The original trio will not be able to release music under the name "Sugababes" as it is still owned by the management company. They will instead release music under the new name, [[Mutya Keisha Siobhan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2176059/Sugababes-Original-members-named-Mutya-Keisha-Siobhan-relaunch.html Original Sugababes come up with catchy new relaunch name...

==History==
Donaghy was born in [[London]], England of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent and has two sisters called Beibhinn and Róisín, who works as her make-up artist.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} She attended [[The Douay Martyrs School]] in Ickenham, in the London Borough of Hillingdon.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} She was discovered by former [[All Saints (group)|All Saints]] manager Ron Tom, who went on to manage [[Sugababes]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===1998–2001: Sugababes===
{{Main|Sugababes}}
The group was created when Donaghy and [[Mutya Buena]] hooked up with Buena's best friend [[Keisha Buchanan]] while working together in a studio. Manager Ron Tom decided they were to be a trio and came up with the name "the Sugababies". Within a year they were offered a record contract by London Records and started calling themselves the Sugababes.&lt;ref name="PonyStep"&gt;{{cite web|work=PonyStep |title=Siobhan Donaghy – The one that got away. |url=http://www.ponystep.com/music/article/SiobhanDonaghyTheonethatgotaway_380.aspx |accessdate=2 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151209004757/http://www.ponystep.com/music/article/SiobhanDonaghyTheonethatgotaway_380.aspx |archivedate=9 December 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their debut single, "[[Overload (Sugababes song)|Overload]]", was a top ten hit in the UK and was nominated for a [[BRIT Award]] for "Best Single".{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} It was a top five hit in Germany and New Zealand.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The group co-wrote most of the tracks on ''[[One Touch (Sugababes album)|One Touch]]'', with the help of [[All Saints (group)|All Saints]] producer [[Cameron McVey]]. ''One Touch'' produced three more top forty singles in the UK: "[[New Year (song)|New Year]]", "[[Run for Cover (Sugababes song)|Run for Cover]]" and "[[Soul Sound]]".{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

According to Donaghy, she left the group because she never got along with Keisha Buchanan, whom she described as a [[Bullying|bully]]. Donaghy became depressed (eventually being diagnosed with [[clinical depression]]) and could no longer be a part of the Sugababes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1104281/bio Biography at IDMb]&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[thelondonpaper]]'', Donaghy said: "It's difficult to leave a band and then make sort of a solo career. I left for a very good reason and I've never for a second wanted to go back there." Despite this, Donaghy maintained contact with Buena, saying she was always pleased to see her.&lt;ref name="PonyStep"/&gt;

In March 2010, it was reported that Donaghy's former colleague, Mutya Buena, was pursuing legal rights to the Sugababes name. Buena was doing it by herself and only listed Donaghy and Buchanan's names on the documentation to register the Sugababes' name with the [[European Union|EU's]] trademark office OHIM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/60484,people,entertainment,mutya-buena-tries-to-trademark-sugababes-name Mutya sues for Sugababes' name]. Thefirstpost.co.uk (4 March 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

===2002–09: ''Revolution in Me'', ''Ghosts'' and hiatus===
Donaghy started writing music with the help of former producer Cameron McVey to help overcome her depression, and began performing under the alias of "Shanghai Nobody", an [[anagram]] of "Siobhán Donaghy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cripps|first1=Charlotte|title=Siobhan Donaghy: My bitter life as a Sugababe|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/siobhan-donaghy-my-bitter-life-as-a-sugababe-89642.html|accessdate=16 June 2016|work=The Independent|date=2 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2003, Donaghy released the 7-inch vinyl single "Nothing but Song" under this title as she did not want to be known as "the girl who left the Sugababes".{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} For the release of her first commercial single in June 2003, "[[Overrated]]" (co-written with McVey and [[Paul Simm]]), Donaghy reverted to her given name. "Overrated" peaked at No. 19 in the UK.&lt;ref name="ukcharts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chartstats.com/artistinfo.php?id=10277 |title=Chart Stats – Siobhan Donaghy |publisher=Chart Stats |accessdate=19 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120724171708/http://www.chartstats.com/artistinfo.php?id=10277 |archivedate=24 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by the single "[[Twist of Fate (Siobhán Donaghy song)|Twist of Fate]]", which was released in September 2003 and charted at No. 52.&lt;ref name="ukcharts"/&gt;

Donaghy's debut album ''[[Revolution in Me]]'' was released by [[London Records]] in September 2003, and entered the UK Albums Chart at No. 117.&lt;ref name=Chartlog&gt;[http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/CLUK_D.HTM Chart Log UK – Siobhan Donaghy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019075638/http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/CLUK_D.HTM |date=19 October 2015 }}. Zobbel.de.&lt;/ref&gt; Working with her on the album were father-son producers and writers Cameron McVey and Marlon Roudette from [[Mattafix]]. Each of the twelve tracks on the album were co-written by Donaghy with McVey, Silvio Pacini, [[Mattafix|Preetesh Hirji]], Matt Kent and others.

In 2005, Donaghy appeared as a backing vocalist on the [[Mattafix]] album ''[[Signs of a Struggle]]'' and on the [[Morcheeba]] album ''[[The Antidote (Morcheeba album)|The Antidote]]''.

Donaghy parted with London Records in a mutual decision with the company.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} She recorded a second album independently which was picked up by [[Parlophone]], part of the [[EMI]] group, which also bought the rights to ''Revolution in Me''. The album's title track, "Ghosts", was released in February 2007 as a 12-inch promotional two-track single with the song "[[Don't Give It Up (Siobhán Donaghy song)|Don't Give It Up]]". The latter song was given a wider release in April 2007 and peaked at No. 45 in the UK.&lt;ref name="ukcharts"/&gt; The second single, "[[So You Say]]", was released in June 2007 and peaked at No. 76.&lt;ref name="ukcharts"/&gt; A remix of "Don't Give It Up" by Jerry Bouthier is featured on the [[Kitsuné]] release ''BoomBox'', released in November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuloop.com/en/cd-dvd/detail/60936/various_artists_mixed_by_jerry_bouthier-boombox.html Siobhan Donaghy Mixed By Jerry Bouthier]. Nuloop.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

The album, ''[[Ghosts (Siobhán Donaghy album)|Ghosts]]'', was also released in June 2007 and peaked at No. 92.&lt;ref name="ukcharts"/&gt; Donaghy had said of the release that she wanted commercial success only so that she could continue to make music. She told The London Paper: "I make left field pop music, and it's a difficult genre to be in because it's not straight pop, it's not alternative, and it's quite hard to market. You have to push it and work it."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070225103106/http://www.siobhandonaghy.co.uk/press.php Press section of her web site].

Donaghy appeared as the character of Mimi, a lead role, in the [[William Baker (fashion designer)|William Baker]]-directed production of ''[[RENT]]'' in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] at the [[Duke of York's Theatre]], which opened in October 2007 and ran until February 2008. She said she was "overwhelmed that she got the part and was looking forward to the challenge". In August 2007 she flew to New York to watch ''RENT'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] to get inspiration for her interpretation of her part.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/donaghy%20lands%20role%20in%20rent_1039759 "Siobhan Donaghy – Donaghy Lands Role In Rent", 6 August 2007, Contact Music].

In a January 2009 interview with the music site We7, Donaghy indicated that there will be no further solo albums released for the time being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.we7.com/magazine/essentials/siobhan-donaghy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213144500/http://www.we7.com/magazine/essentials/siobhan-donaghy |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 February 2009 |title=Siobhan Donaghy's Ghosts voted most underrated album! |publisher=We7.com |accessdate=15 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "At this point in time I have no further plans to undertake another record of my own. Ultimately, the true nature of the business side of the music industry is enough to keep me away. Nonetheless, if I find myself in the future bursting with ideas and experiences I feel the need to share through music, I will be back," Donaghy stated.

In June 2009, Donaghy was featured on the Square1 single "[[Styfling]]" produced by Silvio Pacini. Later in the year, she said in an interview with fashion site ponystep.com that she feels she had "had the break" she wanted from the industry and was currently working on new music but was unsure when it will be finished.&lt;ref name="PonyStep" /&gt;

'''Tamara Natalie Madden'''  (August 16, 1975 – November 4, 2017) was a [[Jamaica]]n-born painter and [[mixed-media]] artist working and living in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fresnobee.com/entertainment/article183994946.html |title=Artist who painted ordinary people into royalty dies at 42 |date=10 November 2017 |website=[[Fresno Bee]] |language=en |access-date=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madden's paintings are allegories whose subjects are the people of the African diaspora.

==Biography==
Madden was born in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], Jamaica. She moved to America from Jamaica permanently when she was an adolescent.
She attended the Frankfield Primary School in [[Manchester, Jamaica]], and [[Rufus King International High School]] in [[Milwaukee, WI]]. She studied at several universities including [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]]. Madden became ill with a rare disease for women and African-Americans called [[IgA nephropathy]] in 1997 and suffered immensely during that time. While living on the dialysis machine, Madden found art again. Art helped her to heal emotionally, so she decided that it was important to pursue it further. She received a kidney transplant from her brother in 2001, and participated in her first art exhibition that same year. Her first solo exhibition was in 2004, and it garnered her an interview with the late James Auer of the ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Auer|first=James|title=After poverty and illness, artist paints to survive|url=http://www.jsonline.com/|accessdate=5 June 2013|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=16 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After her solo exhibition in 2004, Madden relocated near [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. She met her mentors [[Charly "Carlos" Palmer]] and WAK (Kevin A Williams) while living in Atlanta. In 2007, Madden debuted a series entitled, "Kings &amp; Queens", which focused on heightening the everyday person. Her work continued to focus on recognizing nobility, honor and respect in those often overlooked by society. Her subjects can be perceived as wealthy and powerful, but for the artist the imagery often represents a power that exudes from within.

Madden created images based on her memories of the people of her native Jamaica, placing them in high status fabrics (raw silks, colorful satins, etc.), that mimicked those worn by royalty. Birds were a common theme in many of Madden's paintings, chosen as a personal symbol of her freedom from illness. Madden's influences were varied, and included [[Gustav Klimt]], Milwaukee artist Ras Ammar Nsoroma, African royalty, Egypt, Asia and the clothing worn by native African and Indian women. She chose to paint imagery that represented the people of the African diaspora.&lt;ref name=Rushworth&gt;{{cite web|last=Rushworth|first=Katherine|title=Uneven show by 3 African American women offers food for thought at Community Folk Art Center in Syracuse|website=The Post Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tamara Natalie Madden's, The Black Queen.jpg|thumb|The Black Queen (2010) by Tamara Natalie Madden]]
"Similar to the works of Gustav Klimt, Madden clothes the goddess in a boldly patterned dress with clear ties to the arts and crafts movement and its populist underpinnings of advocating for art made by the people for the people. The unique quilting of the dress distinguishes the wearer while harkening to feelings of home and of natural, honest labor. Additionally, Madden's use of decadent colors and gold gives her subjects a life of indulgence that they never had."&lt;ref name=Kersten&gt;{{cite web|last=Kersten|first=Ben|title=Tamara Natalie Madden's beautiful images, Goddesses inspired by Jamaican culture.|url=http://aadatart.com/tamarie-natalie-madden/#.VYD8zxNViko|work=AADAT|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Madden's solo exhibition at the [[Pittsburgh Cultural Trust]] garnered positive feedback from local art critics and observers. Her exhibition entitled, ''Out of Many, One'' (the Jamaican motto) sought to expand the visual repertoire of viewers and their perceptions of Jamaica and its people. "Ms. Madden's recasting of the poor and neglected may remind an observer of [[Kehinde Wiley]]'s regal portraits of inner-city black men, currently on exhibit at the [[Brooklyn Museum]].

'''Thomas Patrick Ashe''' ({{lang-ga|Tomás Pádraig Ághas}}; 12 January 1885 – 25 September 1917) was a member of the [[Conradh na Gaeilge|Gaelic League]], the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] (IRB) and a founding member of the [[Irish Volunteers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alcobia-Murphy|first=Shane|authorlink=|title=Governing the Tongue|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2005|pages=54|doi=|isbn=978-1-904303-60-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Thomas Ashe was born in the [[townland]] of Kinard East, [[Lispole]], [[Dingle]], [[County Kerry]], Ireland, to Gregory Ashe (d. 1927), a farmer, and his wife Ellen Hanifin, on 12 January 1885, according to his baptismal record and his sister Nora,[https://thomaspatrickashe.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/noraashewitnessstatement.pdf]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://churchrecords.irishgenealogy.ie/churchrecords/details/b5d7fa0199366|title=Church records|last=|first=|date=|website=IrishGenealogy.ie|publisher=|access-date=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie/reels/bmh/BMH.WS0645.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; or 15 March 1885, according to state birth records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://civilrecords.irishgenealogy.ie/churchrecords/details-civil/cef4780750695|title=General Registrar's Office|last=|first=|date=|website=IrishGenealogy.ie|publisher=|access-date=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His was a family of ten, seven boys and three girls. Thomas was the seventh child, with three brothers following him. His mother died aged 58, some years before Thomas died. Both Irish and English were spoken in their house,&lt;ref name= Nora&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie/reels/bmh/BMH.WS0645.pdf |title=Witness Statement of Nora Aghas}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Thomas's father being a great Irish Scholar and learners of Irish used to come to listen to his stories.

Having entered De La Salle Training College, Waterford, in 1905 he began his teaching career as principal of Corduff National School, [[Lusk, Dublin|Lusk]], [[County Dublin]], in 1908. He taught Irish in Corduff school. He was fond of the Irish language and started branches of the Gaelic League in Skerries and other neighbouring villages. According to his sister Nora he would get the children to march over a [[Union Jack]].&lt;ref name=Nora/&gt;

He spent his last years before his death teaching children in Lusk, where he founded the award-winning Lusk Black Raven Pipe Band as well as Round Towers Lusk [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) club in 1906.

==Prior to the rising==
[[File:Thomas Ashe Memorial in Cavan - geograph-3766027-by-Eric-Jones.jpg|thumb|right|Thomas Ashe Memorial in Cavan]]
Ashe joined the [[Irish Volunteers]] upon its foundation in November 1913. He was a member of the Keating Branch of the [[Gaelic League]].  He was a member of the [[Lusk, Dublin|Lusk]] company of the volunteers and probably founded it.&lt;ref name=Nora/&gt; He sat on the governing body of the Gaelic League and collected considerable sums of money during a trip to the USA in 1914 for both the Volunteers and the League.&lt;ref name=Glasnevin&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.glasnevintrust.ie/visit-glasnevin/interactive-map/thomas-ashe/ |title=THOMAS ASHE |website=glasnevintrust.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Easter Rising==
Commanding the Fingal [[battalion]] (5th battalion) of the [[Irish Volunteers]], Ashe took a major part in the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] outside the capital city.  Ashe was commandant of 5th battalion of the Dublin brigade; a force of 60–70 men engaged British forces around north County Dublin during the rising.&lt;ref&gt;C Townshend, "Easter 1916: The Irish Rebellion", (London 2006), pp. 169-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Ashe was sent a messenger Mollie Adrian by Pearse with orders to hold the main road from Fairyhouse. She was sent back to report to Connolly, who returned an order to send 40 men to the GPO.&lt;ref&gt;Townshend, pp. 215-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Ashe was only able to send 20 due to his shortage of men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cit web |url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/1916/the-rising-explained/ashbourne-lit-the-blue-touchpaper-for-future-battles-34342342.html |title=Ashbourne lit the blue touchpaper for future battles |publisher=Independent.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was to contact 1st battalion at Cross Guns Bridge, although he found no one there because vice-commandant Piaras Beaslai knew nothing of this plan. The area was dominated by the central feature of Broadstone station, at the end of the line to Athlone, an important British army barracks. But for some reason they decided not to occupy and garrison the station; similarly the Citizens Army had been confusingly required to withdraw from Mallin. The lack of co-operative communication was later discussed in Piaras Beaslai's books, the research for which included taking accounts from Thomas Ashe whilst they were incarcerated.&lt;ref&gt;Irish Bureau of Military History WS 261 (Piaras Beaslai)&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of inexperienced volunteers to properly co-ordinate their deployments was a critical factor at defeat.&lt;ref&gt;Townshend, p169.&lt;/ref&gt; Ashe himself had only been appointed commandant shortly before Easter. They were armed only with a few rounds, about a dozen service rifles, a dozen Mausers, and a dozen Martini carbines; some had only a shotgun against well-equipped army regulars.

The battalion won a major victory in [[Ashbourne, County Meath]] &lt;ref&gt;'The Battle of Ashbourne': http://www.1916rising.com/pic_battleashbourne.html&lt;/ref&gt; where they engaged a much larger force capturing a significant quantity of arms and up to 20 [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] (RIC) vehicles. Eleven RIC members, including County Inspector Alexander Gray, and two volunteers were killed during the five-and-a-half-hour battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coogan|first=Tim Pat|title=1916: The Easter Rising|publisher=Cassel&amp;co|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-four hours after the rising collapsed, Ashe's battalion surrendered on the orders of [[Patrick Pearse]].

When he received the order to surrender he had his doubts as he had difficulty believing the rebels in Dublin had not had success as he did. He sent [[Richard Mulcahy]] to Dublin to verify its authenticity.&lt;ref name=Nora/&gt;

On 8 May 1916, Ashe and [[Éamon de Valera]] were [[court-martial]]led and both were sentenced to death. The sentences were commuted to [[penal servitude]] for life. Ashe was imprisoned in [[Frongoch internment camp|Frongoch Internment camp]] and [[Lewes (HM Prison)|Lewes Prison]] in England.  While in prison he wrote the poem "Let Me Carry Your Cross for Ireland, Lord".

[[File:Thomas Ashe's Grave in-English.JPG|thumb|right|The gravestone of Thomas Ashe, [[Peadar Kearney]] and [[Piaras Béaslaí]] in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]]]]
With the entry of the US into [[World War I]] in April 1917, the British government was put under more pressure to solve the 'Irish problem'. De Valera, Ashe and [[Thomas Hunter (Irish politician)|Thomas Hunter]] led a prisoner [[hunger strike]] on 28 May 1917 to add to this pressure. With accounts of prison mistreatment appearing in the Irish press and mounting protests in Ireland, Ashe and the remaining prisoners were freed on 18 June 1917 by [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] as part of a general amnesty.

==Death and legacy==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2016}}
Thomas Ashe was released from jail in June 1917 under the general amnesty which was given to republican prisoners. Upon release, Ashe returned to Ireland and began a series of speaking engagements. In August 1917, Ashe was arrested and charged with [[sedition]] for a speech that he made in [[Ballinalee]], [[County Longford]], where [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] had also been speaking. He went on the run but was captured in Dublin and detained at the Curragh but was then transferred to [[Mountjoy Prison]] in Dublin.

He was convicted and sentenced to two years hard labour. Ashe and other prisoners, including other Kerrymen [[Fionán Lynch]] and [[Austin Stack]], demanded [[prisoner of war]] status. As this protest evolved Ashe again went on hunger strike on 20 September 1917.  As this was a breach of prison discipline the authorities retaliated by taking away the prisoners' beds, bedding and boots. After five or six days lying on a cold stone floor the prisoners were subjected to forcible feeding. On 25 September, Fionan Lynch saw Ashe being carried away to receive this treatment and called out to him: 'Stick it Tom boy'. Ashe called back 'I'll stick it, Fin'. That was the last time they spoke to each other. Ashe was carried back, blue in the face and unconscious. He was removed to the Mater Misericordiae Hospital (which faces the prison) where he died within a few hours. "Tom Ashe's body lay in state in the hospital morgue, dressed in his Volunteer Republican uniform, and 30,000 mourners filed by.&lt;ref&gt;"Michael Collins", autobiography by Tim Pat Coogan.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[inquest]] into his death, the jury condemned the staff at the prison for the "inhuman and dangerous operation performed on the prisoner, and other acts of unfeeling and barbaric conduct".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Ulick|authorlink=Ulick O'Connor|title=Michael Collins and the Troubles|publisher=[[Mainstream Publishing]]|year=2001|page=124|isbn=1-84018-427-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The death of Thomas Ashe and the subsequent funeral procession had a striking effect on the attitude of the Irish people and became a rallying call to the standard of the Irish Republic.&lt;ref&gt;THOMAS ASHE FUNERAL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrLd5E1f1Fc&amp;feature=youtu.be&lt;/ref&gt; Though not on the scale of O'Donovan Rossa's funeral two years previous, the military aspect of the funeral proved that the Irish Volunteers were well on their way to being restored to pre-1916 levels. Thomas Ashe's remains lay in state in Dublin's City Hall before a funeral procession of over 30,000 marched to [[Glasnevin Cemetery]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.glasnevintrust.ie/visit-glasnevin/interactive-map/thomas-ashe/&lt;/ref&gt; on 30 September 1917. Michael Collins delivered the funeral eulogy in Irish and English, following the firing of a volley by uniformed Irish Volunteers. The English eulogy being " nothing additional remains to be said. That volley which we have just heard is the only speech which is proper to make above the grave of a dead Fenian".

He was related to American actor [[Gregory Peck]].&lt;ref name=Glasnevin/&gt;

'''Tie Xuan''' (1366-1402&lt;ref&gt;《[[国朝献徵录]]》（卷38）：“时年三十七，十月十七日也。”&lt;/ref&gt;)[[courtesy name]] Dingshi 鼎石, born in [[Dengzhou]], [[Henan]] in the [[Yuan dynasty]] was a [[Semu]] [[Hui people|Hui]] person. He served as an official loyal to the deposed [[Ming dynasty]] [[Jianwen Emperor]]. During the [[Jingnan Campaign]] where the Prince of Yan Zhu Di (the later [[Yongle Emperor]]) rebelled against his nephew the Jianwen Emperor, Tie Xuan refused to support Zhu Di and he was sentenced to death by tearing off limbs and frying in oil. Later generations honored him for his unyielding loyalty, in various regions of the country there are temples set up in Tie's honor to offer rituals to him. In the [[Southern Ming]] period he was honored with the title of Grand Protector 太保 and given the posthumous name Zhongxiang 忠襄 (loyal assister). Later on, under  [[Qianlong emperor|Qianlong’s reign]] in the [[Qing dynasty]] he was given the posthumous name Zhongding 忠定.

==Life==
===Early life===
In the reign of the first Ming Emperor Taizu [[Hongwu]] he graduated as a student 太學生 where he did well and was appointed to an official position 給事中, after that he was transferred to the post of military governor and oversaw cases and solved them quickly. Ming Taizu was very happy and gave him the courtesy name dingshi 鼎石. &lt;ref&gt;《[[国朝献徵录]]》（卷38）：“铁鼎石，名铉，邓州丰和乡人。幼处州校，聪敏迈伦。既入国学，学问益大，除礼科给事中，迁五军都督府断事官。高庙每试以盘根错节，知其能，喜而字之曰鼎石。法司有疑狱未决，多属铉以成。”&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years of the Jianwen reign, he was appointed to a high administrative position in Shandong province 山东承宣布政使司. When Li Jinglong and his army were sent north to fight against Zhu Di, Tie Xuan gave him military rations and supplies, and never stopped. In the third year of Jianwen (1400) Li Jinglong lost at Baigou river, he rode his horse alone to escape to Dezhou, the  guards at the gate saw him and they despaired at his loss. Tie Xuan and the ones who helped the army of Gao Yi felt sad over this, were crying with both of their eyes, he went from Linyi straight to Jinan, with Sheng Yong, Song Can's army to fight to the death in defense. &lt;ref&gt;《[[革除逸史]]》：“五月辛未，景隆自德州潜出，奔济南。癸酉，燕将张信入德州，夺军饷百万，转掠济南。参政铁铉、都督盛庸、参赞高魏自临邑入济南。”&lt;/ref&gt; The Prince of Yan's army went charging to Dezhou, Li Jinglong ran to Tie Xuan. Dezhou was lost, the Yan troops got millions of their war supplies and got stronger, and then they went to fight in Jinan. Li Jinglong lost again and went south. &lt;ref&gt;《[[明史]]》（卷142）：“鐵鉉，鄧人。洪武中，由國子生授禮科給事中，調都督府斷事。嘗讞疑獄，立白。太祖喜，字之曰「鼎石」。建文初，為山東參政。李景隆之北伐也，鉉督餉無乏。景隆兵敗白溝河，單騎走德州，城戍皆望風潰。鉉與參軍高巍感奮涕泣，自臨邑趨濟南，偕盛庸、宋參軍等誓以死守。燕兵攻德州，景隆走依鉉。德州陷，燕兵收其儲蓄百餘萬，勢益張。遂攻濟南，景隆復大敗，南奔。”&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fight against the Yan army===
On 15th day of the 5th month the Yan army attacked Jinan, and Tie Xuan and Sheng Yong stood to defend the city. Zhu Di’s letter arrived which urged them to surrender but it failed. &lt;ref&gt;《[[明通鑑]]》（卷12）：“燕師遂圍濟南，鉉與庸等乘城守禦。王知不可驟克，令射書城中趣降。”&lt;/ref&gt; On 17th day of the 5th month the Yan army diverted a river by digging into the river embankment and released water into the city. &lt;ref&gt;《[[明太宗實錄]]》（卷6）：“辛巳，隄水灌濟南城。”&lt;/ref&gt; Tie Xuan saw that the situation  in the turn of events was not encouraging, he decided to send 1,000 men to feign surrender. &lt;ref&gt;《明通鑑》卷十二：鉉乃佯令守陴（牆頭）者皆哭，撤守具，遣千人出城詐降。王大喜，軍中懽呼。鉉設計，預懸鐵板城門上，伏壯士闉堵（甕城）中，候燕王入，下板擊之，又設伏，斷城外橋以遏歸師。&lt;/ref&gt; Zhu Di was overjoyed, and the Yan army officers and soldiers all cheered for this. Tie Xuan ordered his warriors to lie in ambush on top of the city walls, to wait for Zhu Di to enter, they were to throw down iron panels to attack him, together with an additional ambush at the broken bridge. Soon after, Zhu Di did not yet enter the city, the iron panels were unexpectedly thrown down, Zhu Di was greatly alarmed and fled. The hidden troops for the ambush were exposed, the bridge between was also not yet cut off, Zhu Di urged his horse to run quickly and go. Zhu Di was absolutely furious, he decided to employ cannon to besiege and bombard the city. Tue Xuan wrote on some wooden tablets  "The sublime Emperor's spirit tablet" 高皇帝神牌 several times and hanged down on the top of the city walls, the Yan army was obliged to cease bombardment. &lt;ref&gt;《[[明通鑑]]》（卷12）：“初，燕王之攻真定也，三日不下，即解兵去。惟自以得濟南足以斷南北道，即不下金陵，畫疆自守，亦足以徐圖江、淮，故乘此大破景隆之銳，盡力攻之，期於必拔。不意鉉等屢挫其鋒，又令守陴者詈燕，燕王益憤，乃以大炮攻城。城中不支，鉉書高皇帝神牌，懸之城上，燕師不敢擊。”&lt;/ref&gt; After more than three months of the city under siege, Jinan was still strongly defending its position. At that time the pacification troops there numbered 200,000 and they planned to recover the city of Dezhou. The Prince of Yan was fearful so he lifted the siege to return north. &lt;ref&gt;《[[明史]]》（卷142）：“鉉與庸等乘城守禦。燕兵堤水灌城，築長圍，晝夜攻擊。鉉以計焚其攻具，間出兵奮擊。又遣千人出城詐降。燕王大喜，軍中皆歡呼。鉉伏壯士城上，候王入，下鐵板擊之。別設伏、斷橋。既而失約，王未入城板驟下。王驚走，伏發，橋倉卒不可斷，王鞭馬馳去。憤甚，百計進攻。凡三閱月，卒固守不能下。當是時，平安統兵二十萬，將復德州，以絕燕餉道。燕王懼，解圍北歸。”&lt;/ref&gt;。
Zhu Di himself launched his troops again, the offensive was set and determined, after less than two days, he abandoned it and went. He believed only through taking Jinan could he cut off north south passage, on the spot he delimited the boundary and guard, it was not difficult for the Yingtianfu (the [[Nanjing]]-based government of the Jianwen Emperor) to take it, consequently he took advantage of Li Jinglong's dash, with all his strength used to attack, he hoped he must attack and seize Jinan, but because of Tie Xuan he failed and was frustrated. The Jianwen Emperor heard this and was very pleased, he dispatched an official to go and show appreciation, to bestow gold, to confer upon him the title the third 三世. Tie Xuan entered the palace to pay respect and thank, the Jianwen emperor again bestowed upon him a banquet and reception. All of Tie Xuan's suggestions were all imposed and adopted. Tie Xuan was promoted to the Shandong left minister position in its government. &lt;ref&gt;《[[革除逸史]]》：“八月戊申，济南围解。以铁铉为山东左布政使，有功将士姜贵等五十四人升赏有差。”&lt;/ref&gt; In the 12th month of that year he was promoted to an official in the Ministry of War. &lt;ref&gt;《[[明史]]》（卷111）：“十二月任督军。”&lt;/ref&gt;。 The Jianwen Emperor replaced Sheng Yong with Li Jinglong as Yan General,  and he assigned Tie Xuan to participate in military affairs. &lt;ref&gt;《[[明通鑑]]》（卷12）：“九月，辛未，擢鐵鉉山東布政使，參贊軍務，尋進兵部尚書。封盛庸為曆城侯，授平燕將軍，以代景隆，都督陳暉、平安副之。詔庸屯德州，平安及吳傑屯定州，徐凱屯滄州，相為犄角以困北平。”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;《[[国朝献徵录]]》（卷38）：“当世荣之时，李景隆以败军召还，命历城侯盛庸出印代之。铉趋朝谢恩蒙，赐宴碗肉，几所建白，皆如其言。陞山东布政使，不数日拜兵部尚书，参佐盛庸。凡运筹策申军政粮草，主将多倚藉之。”&lt;/ref&gt; In that winter, Sheng Yong inflicted a defeat on Zhu Di in Dongchang, and beheaded his general Zhang Yu. Zhu Di fled back to Beiping (now Beijing). Since after then, the Yan troops all went via [[Xuzhou]], Pei county to go south, they would not dare again go via route of Shandong. &lt;ref&gt;《[[明史]]》（卷142）：“燕王自起兵以來，攻真定二日不下，即捨去。獨以得濟南，斷南北道，即畫疆守，金陵不難圖。故乘大破景隆之銳，盡力以攻，期於必拔，而竟為鉉等所挫。帝聞大悅，遣官慰勞，賜金幣，封其三世。鉉入謝，賜宴。凡所建白皆採納。擢山東布政使。尋進兵部尚書。以盛庸代景隆為平燕將軍，命鉉參其軍務。是年冬，庸大敗燕王於東昌，斬其大將張玉。燕王奔還北平。自燕兵犯順，南北日尋幹戈，而王師克捷，未有如東昌者。自是燕兵南下由徐、沛，不敢復道山東。”&lt;/ref&gt;。

As the Yan troops day by day advanced, the Jianwen Emperor ordered the Liaodong military official Yang Wen to command 100,000 troops to go ahead and link up with Tie Xuan, to break off the Yan troop's escape route. Yang Wen's army arrived at Zhigu (in Tianjin), and was defeated by the Yan General Song Gui, not one of them arrived in Jinan. In the fourth month of the fourth year of Jianwen (1402) the Yan army at the south of the Xiaohe river the central army fought, Tie Xuan and the various  generals beheaded many. Both sides linked up to fight at Lingbi, the pacification soldiers were dispersed and captured. After this Sheng Yong was also defeated. The Yan troops crossed the river, Tie Xuan's soldiers stationed at Huaishang, and army were also defeated. &lt;ref&gt;《[[明史]]》（卷142）：“比燕兵漸逼，帝命遼東總兵官楊文將所部十萬與鉉合，絕燕後。文師至直沽，為燕將宋貴等所敗，無一至濟南者。四年四月，燕軍南綴王師於小河，鉉與諸將時有斬獲。連戰至靈璧，平安等師潰被擒。既而庸亦敗績。燕兵渡江，鉉屯淮上，兵亦潰。”&lt;/ref&gt;。

===Unyielding and dying===
Soon after Tie Xuan's soldiers were defeated he was captured, he refused to surrender, and he sat down with his back turned in court to insult Zhu Di. Zhu Di ordered him to turn his body around, Tie Xuan however all along refused to listen, even after his ears and nose were cut off he refused to look back. Zhu Di commanded to cook his flesh and then to stuff it into his mouth, and also asked, "is it not sweet"? Tie Xuan replied sternly, "the flesh of a faithful official and filial son, why would it not be sweet"? Thereupon his limbs were torn off, Tie Xuan died after incessant torture. After he died they again used oil to cook his corpse, during the course of events wished to face north to worship, but the heat caused oil to unexpectedly splash and drop. &lt;ref&gt;《[[明史纪事本末]]》（卷18）：“兵部尚书铁铉被执至京，陛见，背立廷中，正言不屈，令一顾不可得，割其耳鼻，竟不肯顾。爇其肉，纳铉口中，令啖之，问曰：“甘否？”铉厉声曰：“忠臣孝子肉有何不甘！”遂寸磔之，至死，犹喃喃骂不绝。文皇乃令舁大镬至，纳油数斛熬之，投铉尸，顷刻成煤炭；导其尸使朝上，转展向外，终不可得。文皇大怒，令内侍用铁棒十馀夹持之，使北面。笑曰：“尔今亦朝我耶！”语未毕，油沸蹙溅起丈馀，诸内侍手糜烂弃棒走，尸仍反背如故。文皇大惊诧，命葬之。”&lt;/ref&gt; Tie Xuan's wife Mrs. Yang and their two daughters were put into the [[Royal Academy (China)]], and forced to become prostitutes. His son Tie Fu'an was exiled to [[Hechi]]. His 83-year-old father Tie Zhongming and his mother Mrs. Xue were exiled to Hainan. &lt;ref&gt;《[[明史]]》（卷142）：“燕王即皇帝位，執之至。反背坐廷中嫚罵，令其一回顧，終不可，遂磔於市。年三十七。子福安，戍河池。父仲名，年八十三，母薛，並安置海南。”&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. Yang died of illness, the two daughters refused to agree to be disgraced, after Zhu Di also gave them a pardon, they were married off to scholars. His second son Tie Fushu fled to Manchuria beyond the wall. &lt;ref&gt;《[[明史纪事本末]]》（卷18）：“妻杨氏并儿女发教坊司，杨氏病死，二女终不受辱，久之，铉同官以闻，文皇曰：“渠竟不屈耶？”乃赦出，皆适士人。”&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Ming Chengzu Emperor Zhu Di hated Tie Xuan, he still praised his loyalty. &lt;ref&gt;《[[罪惟录]]》：「對群臣言，每稱鉉忠。」&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of Ming Shenzong ([[Wanli Emperor]])'s rule an imperial edict was ordered "offer sacrifices to the Jianwen emperor's court at all the official's native villages," Tie Xuan was decorated  as the 7th ranking loyal official to Jianwen in his temple. In the time of the [[Southern Ming]]'s Hongguang Emperor [[Zhu Yousong]], the title Grand Protector 太保 was posthumously conferred upon Tie Xuan, and the posthumous name Zhongxiang 忠襄. &lt;ref&gt;《[[爝火录]]》（卷6）：“追补建文死节诸臣赠谥，立祠祀之。……铁铉赠太保，谥“忠襄”。”&lt;/ref&gt; [[Qing Gaozong]] conferred the posthumous name Zhongding 忠定.  In various locations in Shandong, there are many Tie Gong 鐵公 temples, all offer sacrifices to Tie Xuan. Jinan's Da Ming lakeside has a "Tie Gong temple”, the Jinan people regard his spirit as their local city god because he was a native of their city.

'''William Bolts''' (1738–1808) was a Amsterdam-born merchant active in [[India]]. He began his career as an employee of the [[British East India Company]], and subsequently became an independent merchant. He is best known today for his 1772 book, ''Considerations on India Affairs'', which detailed the exploitation and despoliation of [[Bengal]] by the East India Company which began shortly after the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757. The observations and experiences he recorded offer a unique resource for scholars inquiring into the nature of early British rule in Bengal. Throughout his life, Bolts continued to propose and execute various trading ventures on his own behalf and in conjunction with various commercial and governmental partners. The ventures of individual traders like Bolts did much to spur governments and large corporations into the expansion of their own interests and empires.

==Biography==
William Bolts was born in Amsterdam on 7 February 1738.&lt;ref&gt;William Bolts's will made in Lisbon on 12 August 1805 and proved in London on 7 September 1808, National Archives, Kew, National Archives, Kew, PRO, PROB 11/1485, sig.710; cited by H.V. Bowen, entry on William Bolts in the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' Oxford University Press, 2004, Vol.6, pp.496-7.&lt;/ref&gt; The baptismal register of the [[English church at Amsterdam]] records his baptism on 21 February 1738.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archief.amsterdam/indexen/doopregisters_1564-1811/zoek/query.nl.pl?i1=1&amp;a1=bolts&amp;x=19&amp;z=b#000000061680 Amsterdam City Archives, baptismal record]&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were William and Sarah Bolts, who almost left no traces; perhaps both English, like the witnesses although Piot suggested his father was from the [[Palatinate (region)]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Piot, "Deux publications inconnues, de Guillaume Bolts", ''Bulletin du Bibliophile Belge,'' Bruxelles, tome XIII (2e serie, tome IV), 1857, pp.81-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==East India Company service==
When he was fifteen he left for England. Around 1755 he lived in Lisbon where he spent some time working in the diamond trade, according to a deposition he made in 1801, before he went out to Bengal in 1759 where he was employed in Calcutta as a factor in the service of the English [[East India Company]].&lt;ref&gt;William Bolts, "A Short Chronological Narrative of Events [1801]", Cleveland Public Library, Cleveland, Ohio, John G. White Zamboni ms Wq 091.92, B 639s, f.1; cited in Barry M. Gough and Robert J. King, "William Bolts: An Eighteenth Century Merchant Adventurer", ''Archives: the Journal of the British Records Association,'' vol.xxxi, no.112, April 2005, pp.8-28, p.10. A. J. van der Aa, ''Biographisch Woordenboek der Nederlanden,'' Haarlem, J.J. van Brederode, 2 Deel, 1854.&lt;/ref&gt; He learned to speak [[Bengali (language)|Bengali]], in addition to his other languages, English, Dutch, German, Portuguese and French. Later he was appointed to the Company's Benares (Varanasi) factory, where he opened a woolens mart, developed saltpeter manufacturing, established opium works, imported cotton, and promoted the trade in diamonds from the Panna and Chudderpoor (Chhatarpur) mines in [[Bundelkhand]].&lt;ref&gt;William Bolts, "A Short Chronological Narrative of Events [1801]", Cleveland Public Library, John G. White Zamboni ms Wq 091.92, B 639s; and P.J. Marshall, ''East Indian Fortunes,'' Oxford, 1976, p.221. ''Précis de l'Origine, de la Marche et de la Chûte de la Compagnie d'Asie et d'Afrique dans les Ports du Littoral Autrichien,'' Liege, 1785, pp.6-7.

He fell foul of the East India Company in 1768, possibly because diamonds were a favorite means for Company employees to secretly remit to Britain the ill-gotten gains of private trade in India which they were officially forbidden to engage in. He announced in September of that year that he intended to start up a newspaper in Calcutta (which would have been India's first modern newspaper), saying that he had "in manuscript many things to communicate which most intimately concerned every individual", but he was directed to quit Bengal and proceed to Madras and from thence to take his passage to England.&lt;ref&gt;William Bolts, ''Considerations on India Affairs,'' London, 1772, Part II, Vol.III, p.528; cited in J. Natarajan, ''Report of the Press Commission,'' Part 2, ''History of Indian Journalism,'' New Delhi, Government of India Publication Division, 1955, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Company officials declared him bankrupt, "to the irretrievable loss of his Fortune", he later claimed.&lt;ref&gt;William Bolts, "A Short Chronological Narrative of Events [1801]", Cleveland Public Library, John G. White Zamboni ms Wq 091.92, B 639s, f.4.&lt;/ref&gt; He never seems to have been able to redeem himself in the eyes of the Company, and in London and elsewhere fought a rearguard action against his many opponents within it.&lt;ref&gt;William Bolts, ''Considerations on India Affairs,'' London, 1772-5, I, passim; Harry Verelst, ''A View of the Rise, Progress and Present State of the English Government in Bengal,'' London, 1772, passim; [[Lucy Sutherland|L.S. Sutherland]], ''The East India Company in Eighteenth-Century Politics,'' Oxford, 1952, pp.219-22,255-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Author and whistle-blower===
The rearguard action occurred in 1772 with the publication of his book ''Considerations on India Affairs,'' in which he attacked the whole system of the English government in Bengal, and particularly complained of the arbitrary power exercised by the authorities and of his own deportation. Today, this type of exposure would be labeled [[whistle-blowing]]. As an employee of the East India Company, he had seen how Bengal, once a prosperous region, had been despoiled and bled white by the East India Company.  ''Considerations'' was translated into French and enjoyed wide circulation, which contributed to his fame on the Continent.&lt;ref&gt;Kaunitz's to Joseph II, 7 August 1787, "Teehandel in Ostindien und China"; cited in Karl Ottmar von Aretin, "Fürst Kaunitz und die österreichisch-ostindische Handelscompagnie von 1775", ''Vierteljahrsschrift für Sozial- und Wirtschaftsgesichte,'' 46 (3), 1959, S.361-377.&lt;/ref&gt; The observations and experiences he records still offer a unique resource for scholars inquiring into the nature of early British rule in Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;William Bolts, ''Considerations on India Affairs,'' London, 1772; Lucy S. Sutherland, ''The East India Company in Eighteenth-Century Politics,'' Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1952, pp.219-22, 231.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abdul Salaam Khursheed, ''Sahafat Bar-e Sagheer main''; Maskeen Ali Hijazi, ''Nai Sahafat''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The voyage of the ''Giuseppe e Teresa,'' 1776-1781==
In 1775, Bolts offered his services to the Imperial government, putting forward a proposal for re-establishing Austrian trade with India from the Adriatic port of [[Trieste]]. His proposal was accepted by the government of Empress [[Maria Theresa]], and on 24 September 1776, Bolts sailed from Leghorn (today's [[Livorno]]) in the dominions of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold]], Grand Duke of Tuscany, the younger son of the Empress, to India in command of a ship under the Imperial flag, the former Indiaman ''Earl of Lincoln,'' renamed the ''Giuseppe e Teresa'' (also called ''Joseph et Thérèse'' or ''Joseph und Theresia''). He took with him a ten-year charter authorizing him to trade under Imperial colors between Austria's Adriatic ports and Persia, India, China and Africa, and from Africa and Madagascar to America.&lt;ref&gt;"Octroi de Sa Majesté l'Imperatrice Reine Apostolique, accordé au Sieur Guillaume Bolts, à Vienne le 5 Juin 1775", Guillaume Bolts, ''Recueil de pièces authentiques, relatives aux affaires de la ci-devant Société impériale asiatique de Trieste, gérées à Anvers,'' Antwerp, 1787, pp.45-49.&lt;/ref&gt; This enterprise required substantial capital, which Bolts sought in the Austrian Netherlands (Belgium), and he brought in the Antwerp banker, Charles Proli, and his associates, the bankers I.C.I. Borrikens and D. Nagel.&lt;ref&gt;Franz von Pollack-Parnau, "Eine österreich-ostindische Handelskompanie, 1775-1785: Beitrag zur österreichische Wirtschaftsgeschichte unter Maria Theresia und Joseph II", ''Vierteljahrsschrift für Sozial- und Wirtschaftsgesichte,'' Beiheft 12, Stuttgart, 1927, S.24.

===Colonisation of Delagoa Bay===
In the next few years Bolts established factories on the [[Malabar Coast]], on the South East African coast at [[Maputo Bay|Delagoa Bay]] and at the Nicobar Islands.&lt;ref&gt;Fulvio Babudieri, "Le vicende della 'Compagnia Asiatica di Trieste'", ''Archeografo Triestino,'' IV Serie, Vol.XLIX (XCVII della raccolta), 1989, articolo no.1130, pp.217-234.

Carlson, ''Trade and Dependency,'' Uppsala, Acta Universitatis Upsalensis, 1984, ''Studia Historica Upsalensis,'' No.138, p.112.&lt;/ref&gt; He procured three ships to conduct this "country" trade, as trade by Europeans between India and other non-European destinations was called. During his voyage out he obtained Brazilian cochineal beetles at Rio de Janeiro and transported them to Delagoa Bay, thereby predating the introduction to Bengal of this insect for the making of scarlet dyes and carmine. The Imperial flag did not fly for long over Delagoa Bay, as alarmed Portuguese authorities who claimed the place as their own sent a 40-gun frigate and 500 men from Goa to remove Bolts's men in April 1781, and to found the Presidio of [[Lourenço Marques]] ([[Maputo]])that established a permanent Portuguese presence there.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Wadström, ''An Essay on Colonization,'' vol.1, London, 1794, pp.187-195; B.

Jahrhundert", ''Völkerkunde: Beiträge zur Erkenntnis von Mensch und Kultur,'' Bd.III, 1 Jahrgang, 1927, S.184-193; Franz von Pollack-Parnau, "Eine österreich-ostindische Handelskompanie, 1775-1785: Beitrag zur österreichische Wirtschaftsgeschichte unter Maria Theresia und Joseph II", ''Vierteljahrsschrift für Sozial- und Wirtschaftsgesichte,'' Beiheft 12, Stuttgart, 1927, S.81-82; Alexandre Lobato, ''Os Austriácos em Lourenço Marques,'' Maputo, Imprensa de Universidade Eduardo Mondlane, 2000; Walter Markov, "L'expansion autrichienne outre-mer et les intérêts portugaises 1777-81", in Congresso Internacional de História dos Descobrimentos, ''Actas,'' Volume V, II parte, Lisboa, 1961, pp.281-291.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activities in India, 1776-1781===
When it learned of Bolts's venture, the English East India Company instructed its officers in Bengal, Madras and Bombay to "pursue the most effectual means that can be fully justified to counteract and defeat" him.&lt;ref&gt;24 December 1776, British Library, India Office Records and Archives, ''Bengal Despatches,'' VIII, ff.271-4; quoted in Sir Richard Temple, "Austria's Commercial Venture in India in the Eighteenth Century", ''Indian Antiquary,'' vol.XLVI, December 1917, p.279.&lt;/ref&gt; Bolts took full advantage of Austria's neutral status in the war between Britain and France, Spain and the Dutch Republic during 1778 to 1783 that formed part of the struggle for American independence. The Company's repeated acts of hostility against Bolts in India were the subject of urgent representations by the Austrian Ambassador in London, resulting in the sending in January 1782 of instructions from the Court of Directors to India, which ordered their officers in India not to give offence to "any subject of his Imperial Majesty".&lt;ref&gt;25 January 1782, British Library, India Office Records and Archives, ''Bombay Despatches,'' VI, f.297; quoted in Sir Richard Temple, "Austria's Commercial Venture in India in the Eighteenth Century", ''Indian Antiquary,'' vol.XLVII, April 1918, p.68.&lt;/ref&gt;
Although when he first arrived in India, at Surat, he was confronted with a wall of opposition erected by the East India Company, he soon made himself known to [[Hyder Ali]], Nawab of [[Mysore]] and the strongest opponent of the English in India. He visited the Nawab at his capital, [[Seringapatam]], where he was granted permission to establish trading factories in the Nawab's Malabar Coast dominions at [[Mangalore]], Karwar and Baliapatam.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Markov, "La Compagnia Asiatica di Trieste", ''Studi Storici,'' vol.2, no.1, 1961, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonisation of the Nicobar Islands===
While Bolts himself was at Seringapatam, he sent the ''Joseph und Theresia'' to the [[Nicobar Islands]], where she arrived in June 1778. There her captain, Bennet, took possession on 12 July. The islands were the focus of a Christian missionary effort of the [[Moravian Brethren]], who visited from time to time from the Danish base on the Indian mainland at [[Tranquebar]]. In consequence of Bolts' action, the Imperial company had established a trading factory on the island of Nancowery, headed by Gottfried Stahl who was accompanied by five other Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;Franz von Pollack-Parnau, "Eine österreich-ostindische Handelskompanie, 1775-1785: Beitrag zur österreichische Wirtschaftsgeschichte unter Maria Theresia und Joseph II", ''Vierteljahrsschrift für Sozial- und Wirtschaftsgesichte,'' Beiheft 12, Stuttgart, 1927, S.45-47.

===Bolts in dispute with Proli===
In spite of his many achievements since 1776, Bolts's venture, on the whole, had made a loss, to the dismay of his Belgian financial backers, Charles Proli and his associates. Proli also disagreed with Bolts over the importance of the China market: Proli wanted to concentrate exclusively on that market while Bolts urged the equal importance of India as Austrian commodities, such as mercury, lead, copper, iron, tin, and vitriol, could find sale there, in contrast to China where only Spanish silver dollars were accepted in return for Chinese products such as tea, porcelain, and silk. While Bolts was still in India, the Proli group sent out two ships, the ''Ville de Vienne'' to Mauritius and the ''Prince Kaunitz'' to China, without informing him. In ignorance of Bolts' purchase of a ship he called the ''Prince Kaunitz,'' the Proli group sent another ship of the same name to China independently of him.&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume Bolts, ''Précis de l'Origine, de la Marche et de la Chûte de la Compagnie d'Asie et d'Afrique dans les Ports du Littoral Autrichien,'' Liege, 1785, pp.17-8.&lt;/ref&gt; This constituted a breach of their contract with him. They refused to honor the bills he drew upon their bank while he was in India. They petitioned the Imperial Government to have his charter transferred exclusively to them. They also seized the ''Joseph et Therese'' as security when the vessel returned to Leghorn.&lt;ref&gt;Helma Houtman-De Smedt, "The ambitions of the Austrian empire with reference to East India during the last quarter of the eighteenth century", Chaudhury Sushil (ed.), ''Merchants, companies and trade: Europe and Asia in the Early Modern Era,'' Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1999, p.232-3.&lt;/ref&gt; At an audience with Emperor Joseph II in Brussels on 28 July 1781, Bolt and Proli agreed to the transformation of their association into a share company, and in August Bolts surrendered his charters to the new Imperial Company of Trieste and Antwerp for the Commerce of Asia (Société Impériale pour le Commerce Asiatique de Trieste et d'Anvers). The Company was to send six ships to China and India, two to East Africa and Mauritius, and three for the southern whale fishery.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Macpherson (historian)|David Macpherson]], ''The History of the European Commerce with India,'' London, 1812, p.316.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imperial Company of Trieste and Antwerp==
The Imperial Company of Trieste and Antwerp was opened to public subscription in August 1781 to raise, nominally, half its capital in one thousand shares. In fact, the Company was seriously under-capitalized, as the other thousand shares held by the Proli group and Bolts were paid for by the nominal value of the assets of the former association. Bolts' valuation of those assets was accepted at face value, but it was a fictitious valuation and in fact the new Company inherited the old association's debts. It consequently suffered chronic lack of cash and had to resort to short-term loans and bottomry bonds (for which the ships themselves were the collateral) at a premium of 30 to 35 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;Helma Houtman-De Smedt, "The ambitions of the Austrian empire with reference to East India during the last quarter of the eighteenth century", Chaudhury Sushil (ed.), ''Merchants, Companies and Trade: Europe and Asia in the Early Modern Era,'' Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1999, p.232-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Under these conditions, every voyage had to be a success for the Company to remain viable. Also under the terms of the agreement erecting the new company, Bolts ceded his charter to his Belgian partners in return for a loan of 200,000 florins (that is, his 200 shares in the Company) and the right to send two ships on his own account to China.&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume Bolts, ''Recueil de pièces authentiques, relatives aux affaires de la ci-devant Société impériale asiatique de Trieste, gérées à Anvers,'' Antwerp, 1787, pp.60-65; N.L. Hallward, ''William Bolts, A Dutch Adventurer under John Company,'' Cambridge University Press, 1920, pp.190-95.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Imperial Asiatic Company under the direction of the Proli group focussed on the China tea trade. In 1781, 1782 and 1783 the price of tea in Europe, especially in England, had risen to unheard of levels. In 1781 and 1782 no Dutch or French ships appeared at Canton as a result of the American War, and in 1782 only eleven English, three Danish and two Swedish ships called there. Only four out of thirteen English ships returned safely in 1783 due to French naval activity. Attempting to seize the opportunity to make good profits, the Proli group sent five ships to Canton: the ''Croate,'' the ''Kollowrath,'' the ''Zinzendorff,'' the ''Archiduc Maximilien,'' and the ''Autrichien.''&lt;ref&gt;Canton Consultations, 12 October 1783, British Library, India Office Records and Archives, G12/77; cited in Sven H.

Guillaume Bolts, ''Précis de l'Origine, de la Marche et de la Chûte de la chute de la Compagnie d'Asie et d'Afrique dans les ports du littoral autrichien,'' Liege, 1785, pp.29-30.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the opportunity had been missed as, with the signing of an armistice in January 1783 the former belligerents were able to send their ships to Canton safely, and the summer of 1783 saw a total of thirty-eight ships there, including the five Imperial vessels. They had to buy tea at a high price, but when they returned to Ostend in July 1784 they had to sell at a low price on a glutted market, as well as having to pay for permission to return to that port. The price of tea at Ostend collapsed when the British Government introduced the ''[[Commutation Act]]'' in 1784, which reduced the tax on tea from fifty to ten per cent and made smuggling from the Netherlands unprofitable. The price of tea in Europe fell suddenly from 30 to 33 [[French sol]]s to 11 to 14 sols, or around sixty per cent. Disastrously, a sixth ship, the Belgioioso, carrying a large amount of silver specie for the purchase of Chinese goods, foundered in a storm in the Irish Sea soon after departing Liverpool, where she was fitted out, on the voyage to Canton.&lt;ref&gt;''The British Magazine,'' March 1783, p.239.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of mounting losses, debts and liabilities, the Company invested in a further ship, the ''Kaiserliche Adler'' or ''Aigle Impériale'' [''Imperial Eagle''], a giant of 1,100 tons, specially built for the Company by the Fiume shipyards, which was launched in March 1784, bringing the Company's fleet to a total of nine vessels. Matters came to a head in January 1785 when the Company suspended all payments, and shortly afterward it was declared bankrupt, bringing the Proli banking house down with it. Charles Proli committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume Bolts, ''Précis de l'Origine, de la Marche et de la Chûte de la Compagnie d'Asie et d'Afrique dans les Ports du Littoral Autrichien,'' Liege, 1785, pp.31-39, 65-69; Franz von Pollack-Parnau, "Eine österreich-ostindische Handelskompanie, 1775-1785: Beitrag zur österreichische Wirtschaftsgeschichte unter Maria Theresia und Joseph II", ''Vierteljahrsschrift für Sozial- und Wirtschaftsgesichte,'' Beiheft 12, Stuttgart, 1927, S.91-96.

==Bolts's Plan for a voyage to the North West Coast of America==
After Bolts returned from India in May 1781, he developed the idea for a voyage to the North West Coast of America to engage in the trade in [[sea otter]] furs to China and Japan. He apparently heard from John Reid, his agent at Canton ([[Guangzhou]]), of the success the crew of [[James Cook]]'s ships had had there in November 1779 in selling the sea otter pelts they had obtained for trinkets on the American coast in the course of Cook's [[Third voyage of James Cook|third expedition]] to the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Gaziello, ''L'expédition de Lapérouse, 1785-1788,'' Paris, 1984, pp.49-50.&lt;/ref&gt; Bolts' ship, the ''Kaunitz'' (not to be confused with the Proli group's vessel of the same name), arrived back at Leghorn (Livorno) from Canton with this news on 8 July 1781.&lt;ref&gt;''Gazette van Gend,'' 19 July 1779 and 30 July 1781.&lt;/ref&gt; Bolts afterward wrote that he had the ambition of wishing to be the first to profit from this new branch of trade.&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume Bolts, ''Recueil de pièces authentiques, relatives aux affaires de la ci-devant Société impériale asiatique de Trieste, gérées à Anvers,'' Antwerp, 1787, pp.104-5.&lt;/ref&gt; At an audience in Vienna in May 1782, Bolts discussed his plan with Emperor Joseph II, for which he had bought a ship in England in November 1781. The ship was called the ''Cobenzell'' (or ''Cobenzl'') in honor of the Vice-Chancellor of State, Count [[Philipp Cobenzl]] (Kobenzl), a patron of the Imperial Company. Bolts' plan called for the ship to round Cape Horn, take on furs at [[Nootka Island|Nootka]], sell or trade them in China and Japan, and return by the Cape of Good Hope. He engaged four sailors who had served under Cook, including [[George Dixon (Royal Navy officer)|George Dixon]], who subsequently commanded the ''Queen Charlotte'' on a voyage to the North West coast for the Etches Company of London, and [[Heinrich Zimmermann]], who had written an account in German of Cook's final voyage. He bought a sloop, the ''Trieste,'' as a tender, and obtained letters of credence from the Emperor to various rulers at whose ports the ship would touch.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. King, "Heinrich Zimmermann and the Proposed Voyage of the KKS ''Cobenzell'' to the North West Coast in 1782-1783", ''The Northern Mariner/Le Marin du Nord,'' vol.21, no.3, July 2011, pp.235-262.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proposed scientific voyage of discovery===
The Emperor lent a ready ear to Bolts as the venture offered a vehicle for carrying into effect his desire, prompted by the voyages of James Cook, for an Austrian round the world voyage dedicated to scientific research. This had been urged by the eminent savant [[Ignaz von Born]] who, at the Emperor's invitation, nominated five naturalists to go with Bolts on the ''Cobenzell''.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal für Rationelle Politik'' (Hamburg), July 1782.] Guillaume Bolts, ''Recueil de pièces authentiques, relatives aux affaires de la ci-devant Société impériale asiatique de Trieste, gérées à Anvers,'' Antwerp, 1787, pp.99-100.&lt;/ref&gt; The intended expedition was reported in the English press in mid-October 1782, in the following terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Emperor intends to signalise himself, in imitation of other Princes, by sending a ship round the world to make discoveries. The vessel destined for this tedious and dangerous expedition, is the Count de Cobenzet [sic], which cleared out of the Port of London the 15th of April last; sailed from Leghorn the 26th of August, and arrived at Trieste the 1st of September with a great cargo, part of which she is to take out with her, particularly fourteen chests of watches and watch-work, which she brought from London. Four persons of great learning are to be sent out in her, at the Emperor's expence, to make discoveries in Natural Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;''Parker's General Advertiser,'' 18 October 1782. Also in ''[[The Derby Mercury]],'' 3 October, ''The Leeds Intelligencer,'' 8 October and ''The Ipswich Journal,'' 12 October 1782.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although the Emperor was initially enthusiastic, he refused to provide finance for it apart from the expenses of his naturalists, and the venture eventually proved impossible to realize. Bolts' hopes for a commercial voyage and the desire of the Emperor and his naturalists for a voyage of scientific discovery were incompatible as a combined undertaking. The opposition of Bolts' Belgian former financial partners and now rivals in the Imperial Asiatic Company of Trieste and Antwerp was also a cause of it's not going ahead, and in the autumn of 1782, it was abandoned. Instead of sending out a scientific expedition on an Austrian ship as Born had proposed, the Austrian naturalists under the leadership of Franz Jozef Maerter went from Le Havre in April 1783 on the American frigate ''General Washington'' (Captain [[Joshua Barney]]) to Philadelphia and thence to South Carolina, Florida, the Bahamas and Santo Domingo (Hispaniola). Besides plants, they were to collect animal and mineral specimens. Reflecting the origins of the enterprise, their instructions gave them the option (which was not taken up) to take ship from Acapulco in Mexico to the Philippines, thence to the Sunda Islands in the Dutch East Indies, the coasts of Bengal, Coromandel and Malabar, and the Iles de France and Bourbon (Mauritius and Reunion).&lt;ref&gt;Leopold Joseph Fitzinger, ''Geschichte des Kaiserlich-Königlichen Hof-Naturalien-Cabinetes zu Wien,'' Wien, 1856, S.23-24; Helga Hühnel, "Botanische Sammelreise nach Amerika in 18.

===Bolts's approaches to Russia and Naples===
Bolts refused to give up on his hopes for a voyage to the North West coast of America. Emperor Joseph II released Bolts from his obligations (except to his creditors) and gave him leave in November 1782 to take his proposal to the court of [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Bolts to Catherine II, Vienna, November 1782, offering to lead a Russian expedition to the North West Coast of America, Kamchatka and China, Российский государственный архив древних актов, фонд Госархива [Государственный Aрхив Российский Империй], разряд XXIV (Сибирский приказ и управление Сибирью), дело 61 (Проект Капитана Г.И.

===Bolts and the Lapérouse expedition===
With the Emperor's permission, Bolts also put his proposal to Joseph's other brother-in-law, [[Louis XVI]] of France. Bolts outlined his plan in letters he wrote to the Maréchal de Castries on 25 January and 9 April 1785. The ''Cobenzell'' would be sent around Cape Horn to the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii), Nootka Sound, the Kurile Islands, and China. The sloop would be left at Nootka to trade for furs, while a couple of Frenchmen would be left in the Kuriles to learn Japanese and adopt the dress and ways of the inhabitants. At least two ships would be employed to maintain communication with Europe via both the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn. A botanist, metallurgist, and astronomer would be employed. In the South Atlantic, [[Tristan da Cunha]] was to be claimed for France and settled as a base for the whaling industry. In addition to Tristan, "the Island discovered by La Roche in 1675" (probably South Georgia) was to be found and settled.&lt;ref&gt;Bolts à Castries, 25 Janvier 1785 and 9 Avril 1785, Rigsarkivet (Stockholm), Handel och Sjöfart, 193, "W. Bolts' förslag till kolonisation af en ö ... 1786-1790"; cited in Holden Furber, "In the Footsteps of a German 'Nabob': William Bolts in the Swedish Archives", ''The Indian Archives,'' vol.12, nos.1-2, January–December 1958, p.16 (reprinted in Holden Furber, ''Private Fortunes and Company Profits in the India Trade in the 18th Century,'' edited by Rosane Rocher, Aldershot and Brookfield, Variorum, 1997, Variorum Collected Studies CS569).

[[Charles Pierre Claret de Fleurieu]], Directeur des Ports et Arsenaux, stated in the draft of the memorandum on the expedition he submitted to the King: "the utility which may result from a voyage of discovery ... has made me receptive to the views put to me by Mr. Bolts relative to this enterprise". However, as Fleurieu explained to the King: "I am not proposing at all, however, the plan for this voyage as it was conceived by Mr. Bolts".&lt;ref&gt;"Projet de Fleurieu et Instructions du Roi", Archives nationales, Fonds de la Marine, 3JJ 386, ff.29-30; quoted in Catherine Gaziello, ''L'Expédition de Lapérouse 1785-1788: Réplique française aux voyages de Cook,'' Paris, CTHS, 1984, pp.50-51. Archives nationales, Fonds de la Marine, B4 319-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Political and strategic considerations took priority over the commercial. Bolts was paid 1,200 Louis for "the communications useful for the Service which he has given", but was given no part in the preparation or execution of the Lapérouse expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Archives nationales, Fonds de la Marine, 3JJ 389, f.1; quoted in Catherine Gaziello, ''L'Expédition de Lapérouse 1785-1788: Réplique française aux voyages de Cook,'' Paris, CTHS, 1984, p.50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The voyages of the ''Cobenzell'' to India and the ''Belgiojoso'' to China===
At odds with his suspicious Antwerp backers, Bolts found himself declared bankrupt in mid-1782.&lt;ref&gt;N.L. Hallward, ''William Bolts,'' Cambridge, 1920, p.193.

===The voyage of the ''Imperial Eagle''===
Having missed the opportunity provided by the American War of Independence to send a ship to the North West Coast undisturbed by British, American or French competitors, Bolts was apparently able to share in the only voyage sent there under the Imperial flag, that of the ''Imperial Eagle,'' the former English East Indiaman ''Loudoun,'' which in November 1786 sailed from Ostend under [[Charles William Barkley]].&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Ly-Tio-Fane, "A reconnaissance of tropical resources during Revolutionary years: the role of the Paris Museum d'Histoire Naturelle", ''Archives of Natural History,'' vol.18, part 3, 1991, pp.323-362, p.337; Log of the Loudoun/Imperial Eagle, Provincial Archives of British Columbia, A/A/20.5/L92; Beth Hill, ''The Remarkable World of Frances Barkley, 1769-1845,'' Sidney (BC), 1978, p.60; B.M.

Siècle,'' Paris, SEVPEN, 1964, tome III, p.1155.&lt;/ref&gt; Having cleared Ostend in November 1786, the ''Imperial Eagle'' touched at Hawaii in May 1787 and reached Nootka in June, from whence she traded southward for two months along the American coast. Barkley added significantly to knowledge of the geography of the area during this voyage, notably identifying the Strait of Juan de Fuca. He returned to Macao with his takings of furs on 5 November.&lt;ref&gt;''The Public Advertiser,'' 17 June 1788; "New Fur Trade", ''The World,'' 6 and 13 October 1788, and ''The European Magazine,'' November 1788.

Howay, ''A List of Trading Vessels in Maritime Fur Trade, 178 –1794,'' Ottawa, Royal Society of Canada, 1930, p.115.&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition was apparently profitable, as an article in ''The London Chronicle'' of 21 June 1788 reported that, "After taking in his cargo, &amp;c. &amp;c. Captain Berkeley [Barkley] proceeded to Macao, where he disposed of his furs at an amazing price".&lt;ref&gt;Also in The Morning Chronicle, 23 June, The Public Advertiser and ''The Morning Post,'' 24 June, ''The Morning Herald,'' 25 June, and ''Freemans Journal'' (Dublin), 28 June 1788.&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally intended that the ''Imperial Eagle'' would make three voyages to the North West Coast, Japan, and Kamchatka, but when she reached Canton after her first season she was sold under threat of retaliation from the East India Company for breaching its monopoly.&lt;ref&gt;Beth Hill, ''The Remarkable World of Frances Barkley, 1769-1845,'' Sidney (BC), 1978, p.60; F.W.

==Plan to colonize Australia 1786-1787==
In November 1786, Bolts was given a contract by King Gustav III of Sweden to discover an island off the coast of Western Australia, where a Swedish colony and trading post could be established. However, the plan was shelved after Sweden became embroiled in war with Russia the following year. Bolts was given 250 pounds for his trouble, and the proposed colony was never established.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. King, "Gustaf III's Australian Colony", ''The Great Circle,'' vol.27, no.2, 2005, pp.3-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bolts's final years==
Bolts is said to have attempted to revive his fortunes in France, setting up an enterprise near Paris, but the outbreak of war with Austria and Britain once again destroyed his hopes.&lt;ref&gt;Michaud freres, ''Biographie universelle,'' Paris, tome 5, 1812, entry on William Bolts.&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to England in 1800-01, where he attempted unsuccessfully to interest the East India Company in obtaining supplies of copper from Anatolia to sell in India.&lt;ref&gt;Bolts to Hugh Inglis, London, 20 August 1800 ; cited in Willem G.

==Background==
Rabbi [[Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn]] (1880–1950) writes in his memoirs
&lt;ref name="hebrewbooks5"/&gt;  that Yoel’s father was Yisrael Yosef, a disciple of Rabbi [[Mordecai Yoffe]]. Sometime after the latter’s passing in 1612 he moved to Zamosc. A year after his arrival to Zamosc he had a son and named him Yoel. Yoel learned for 5&amp;nbsp;years in the Yeshiva of Rabbi [[Joel Sirkis]] ([[Hebrew]]: יואל סירקיש) (possibly in [[Liuboml]]) who was a [[Halachist]] and adherent of Kabbalah.

Yoel married before the age of 20 and started learning Kabbalah. Upon a dream, Yisrael Yosef sent his son Yoel to [[Prague]] to learn kabbalah from Rabbi [[Eliyahu Baal Shem of Worms|Eliyahu Baal Shem]]. Yoel became one of the closest students of Rabbi Eliyahu Baal Shem who confided all his special teaching to him. Yoel returned to Zamosc and opened a Yeshiva there which became renowned for teaching both ''[[niglah]]'' and ''[[Kabbalah|nistar]]''.

Reb Yoel had a son Uri who learned in the Yeshiva of Rabbi [[David HaLevi Segal]] (author of the ''Turei Zahav'')  in [[Ostroh]] ({{lang-uk|Остро́г}}; {{lang-ru|Остро́г, Ostrog}}, {{lang-pl|Ostróg}}). After the latters passing, he went to learn for another six years under Rabbi [[Avraham Gombiner]] (Hebrew: אברהם אבלי הלוי גומבינר) (author of ''Magen Avraham'') in [[Kalisz]].

Upon Uri’s marriage, Rabbi Yoel appointed him as [[Rosh yeshiva]] for Nigla studies, whilst he remained Rosh Yeshiva for Nistar. He was Rosh yeshiva for some 50&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name="hebrewbooks5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15614&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=94|title=2 - Lubavitcher Rabbi's Memoirs - שניאורסון (page 94 of 318)|publisher=hebrewbooks.org|accessdate=May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings and Legacy==

Rabbi Yoel Baal Shem (I) was the teacher of Rabbi [[Adam Baal Shem]] of [[Ropczyce]] {{IPAc-pl|r|o|p|'|cz|y|c|e}} ({{lang-yi|ראָפּשיץ}}) who instructed Rabbi [[Israel Baal Shem Tov]] in Kabbalah.

Stories and teachings of Rabbi Yoel Baal Shem (I) can be found in various kabbalistic ''[[Sefer (Hebrew)|sefarim]]'',&lt;ref name="hebrewbooks2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hebrewbooks3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hebrewbooks4"/&gt; especially in two ''sefarim'', ''Mifalos Elokim''&lt;ref name="hebrewbooks7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hebrewbooks.org/33921|title=HebrewBooks.org Sefer Detail: מפעלות אלקים -- מפעלות אלהים.|publisher=hebrewbooks.org|accessdate=2014-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Toldos Adam''&lt;ref name="hebrewbooks8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hebrewbooks.org/21501|title=HebrewBooks.org Sefer Detail: תולדות אדם -- אליהו בן יהודה אהרן, מחלם, 1520-1590|publisher=hebrewbooks.org|accessdate=2014-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; which earned the [[imprimatur]] of his grandson, Rabbi Yoel Baal Shem (II), the son of Uri.

Rabbi Yeshaya Heilprin, son of Yoel Helprin (II), was also a kabbalist and expert in kabbalistic amulets.&lt;ref name="hebrewbooks9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=35761&amp;st=%d7%99%d7%95%d7%90%d7%9c+%d7%91%d7%a2%d7%9c+%d7%a9%d7%9d&amp;pgnum=236&amp;hilite=7627e2b2-740b-450d-bb13-0beaab5662ee|title=שפת אמת ולשון זהורית - עמדין, יעקב בן צבי (יעב"ץ) , 1698-1776 (page 236 of 237)|publisher=hebrewbooks.org|accessdate=2014-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
