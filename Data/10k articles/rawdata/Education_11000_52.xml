Alan Curtis Kay (born May 17, 1940&lt;ref name="turingaward"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/kay_3972189.cfm|title=ACM Turing Award|year=2003}} published by the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] 2012&lt;/ref&gt;) is an American [[computer scientist]]. He has been elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[National Academy of Engineering]], and the [[Royal Society of Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech|author=Alan Kay|year=1997|url=http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee380/9697spr/node10.html|title=The Computer Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for his pioneering work on [[object-oriented programming]] and [[Window (computing)|windowing]] [[graphical user interface]] design.

He is the president of the [[Viewpoints Research Institute]], and an adjunct professor of [[computer science]] at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. He is also on the advisory board of [[TTI/Vanguard]]. Until mid-2005, he was a senior fellow at [[HP Labs]], a visiting professor at [[Kyoto University]], and an adjunct professor at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svextra.com/blogs/gmsv/2005/07/hp_converting_s.html |title=HP converting storied garage into recycling center |author=Paczkowski, John |date=21 July 2005 |work=Good Morning Silicon Valley |publisher=Media News Group |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626093934/http://svextra.com/blogs/gmsv/2005/07/hp_converting_s.html |archivedate=2007-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kay is also a former professional [[jazz guitarist]], composer, and theatrical designer, and an amateur classical [[pipe organ]]ist.

== Early life and work ==
In an interview on education in America with the Davis Group Ltd., Kay said,

{{quote| I had the fortune or misfortune to learn how to read fluently starting at the age of three. So I had read maybe 150 books by the time I hit 1st grade. And I already knew that the teachers were lying to me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vimeo.com/20673320 |title=Interview with Alan Kay on education |work=The Generational Divide |publisher=The Davis Group |accessdate=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Originally from [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], Kay's family relocated several times due to his father's career in [[physiology]] before ultimately settling in the [[New York metropolitan area]] when he was nine.

He attended the prestigious [[Brooklyn Technical High School]], where he was suspended due to insubordination in his senior year. Having already accumulated enough credits to graduate, Kay then attended [[Bethany College (West Virginia)|Bethany College]] in [[Bethany, West Virginia]]. He majored in [[biology]] and minored in [[mathematics]] before he was asked to leave by the administration for protesting the institution's Jewish quota.

Thereafter, Kay taught guitar in [[Denver, Colorado]] for a year and hastily enlisted in the [[United States Air Force]] when the local draft board inquired about his nonstudent status. Assigned as a [[computer programmer]] (a rare billet dominated by women due to the secretarial connotations of the field in the era) after passing an aptitude test, he devised an early cross-platform file transfer system.

Following his discharge, Kay enrolled at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]], earning a [[bachelor's degree]] in mathematics and [[molecular biology]] in 1966. Before and during this time, he worked as a professional [[jazz]] guitarist. During his studies at CU, he wrote the music for an adaptation of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and other campus theatricals.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In the autumn of 1966, he began graduate school at the [[University of Utah]] [[University of Utah College of Engineering|College of Engineering]]. He earned an [[M.S.]] in [[electrical engineering]] in 1968 before taking his [[Ph.D.]] in computer science in 1969. His doctoral dissertation, ''FLEX: A Flexible Extendable Language'', described the invention of a [[computer language]] known as [[Flex (language)|FLEX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alan C. Kay|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/761962.pdf|title=FLEX: A Flexible Extendable Language|work= University of Utah|year= 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="H. Peter Alesso, C.F. Smith"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DxGyOaAyd6gC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Connections:+Patterns+of+Discovery&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Connections%3A%20Patterns%20of%20Discovery&amp;f=false|author1=H.

Barnes|url=http://ethw.org/images/2/23/Barnes.pdf|title=Alan Kay: Transforming the Computer Into a Communication Medium|publisher=Engineering &amp; Technology History Wiki|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701083057/http://ethw.org/Images/2/23/Barnes.pdf|archivedate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at Utah, he worked with "father of [[computer graphics]]" [[Ivan Sutherland]], best known for writing such pioneering programs as [[Sketchpad]]. This greatly inspired Kay's evolving views on objects and programming. As he grew busier with [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|ARPA]] research, he ended his musical career.

In 1968, he met [[Seymour Papert]] and learned of the [[Logo (programming language)|Logo]] [[programming language]], a [[Programming language dialect|dialect]] of [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] optimized for [[education]]al purposes. This led him to learn of the work of [[Jean Piaget]], [[Jerome Bruner]], [[Lev Vygotsky]], and of [[Constructionism (learning theory)|constructionist learning]], further influencing his professional orientation.

Leaving Utah as an [[associate professor]] of computer science in 1969, Kay became a visiting researcher at the [[Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]] in anticipation of accepting a professorship at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. Instead, in 1970, he joined the [[Xerox]] [[PARC (company)|PARC]] research staff in [[Palo Alto, California]]. Throughout the decade, he developed prototypes of networked workstations using the programming language [[Smalltalk]]. These inventions were later commercialized by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] in their [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]] and [[Macintosh]] computers.

Kay is one of the fathers of the idea of [[object-oriented programming]], which he named, along with some colleagues at PARC. Some of the original object-oriented concepts, including the use of the words 'object' and 'class', had been developed for Simula 67 at the [[Norwegian Computing Center]]. Later he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm sorry that I long ago coined the term "objects" for this topic because it gets many people to focus on the  lesser idea. The big idea is "messaging"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/squeak-dev/1998-October/017019.html|title= AlanKayOnMessaging}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While at PARC, Kay conceived the [[Dynabook]] concept, a key progenitor of [[laptop]] and [[tablet computer|tablet]] computers and the [[e-book]]. He is also the architect of the modern overlapping windowing [[graphical user interface]] (GUI).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Bergin, Jr. |first1=Thomas J. |last2=Gibson, Jr. |first2=Richard G. |place=New York, NY |year=1996 |publisher=ACM Press, Addison-Wesley |title=History of Programming Languages II |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=234286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Dynabook was conceived as an educational platform, Kay is considered to be one of the first researchers into [[mobile learning]]; many features of the Dynabook concept have been adopted in the design of the [[One Laptop Per Child]] educational platform, with which Kay is actively involved.

The field of computing is awaiting new revolution to happen, according to Kay, in which educational communities, parents, and children will not see in it a set of tools invented by [[Douglas Engelbart]], but a medium in the [[Marshall McLuhan]] sense. He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As with Simulas leading to OOP, this encounter finally hit me with what the destiny of personal computing really was going to be. Not a personal dynamic vehicle, as in Engelbart's metaphor opposed to the IBM "railroads", but something much more profound: a personal dynamic medium. With a vehicle one could wait until high school and give "drivers ed", but if it was a medium, it had to extend into the world of childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gagne.homedns.org/~tgagne/contrib/EarlyHistoryST.html|title=The Early History of Smalltalk|website=gagne.homedns.org|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Recent work and recognition ==
From 1981 to 1984, Kay was [[Atari]]'s Chief Scientist. He became an Apple Fellow in 1984. Following the closure of the company's [[Apple Advanced Technology Group|Advanced Technology Group]] in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.i-programmer.info/history/8-people/438-alan-kay.html?start=1 |title=Alan Kay |date=13 November 2009 |work=I Programmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was recruited by his friend [[Bran Ferren]], head of research and development at [[Disney]], to join [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] as a Disney Fellow. He remained there until Ferren left to start Applied Minds Inc with Imagineer [[Danny Hillis]], leading to the cessation of the Fellows program. In 2001, he founded [[Viewpoints Research Institute]], a non-profit organization dedicated to children, learning, and advanced software development.  For its first ten years, Kay and his Viewpoints group were based at [[Applied Minds]] in [[Glendale, California]], where he and Ferren continued to work together on various projects. Kay was also a Senior Fellow at [[Hewlett-Packard]] until HP disbanded the Advanced Software Research Team on July 20, 2005.

Kay taught a Fall 2011 class, "Powerful Ideas: Useful Tools to Understand the World", at [[New York University]]'s [[Interactive Telecommunications Program]] (ITP) along with full-time ITP faculty member Nancy Hechinger. The goal of the class was to devise new forms of teaching/learning based on fundamental, powerful concepts rather than traditional rote learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Kay |first=Alan |title=Powerful Ideas: Useful Tools to Understand the World |url=https://itp.nyu.edu/registration/CourseInfo.php?course_id=489 |date=2011-09-15 |accessdate=2011-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Squeak, Etoys, and Croquet ===
In December 1995, while still at Apple, Kay collaborated with many others to start the [[Open-source software|open source]] [[Squeak]] version of [[Smalltalk]], and he continues to work on it. As part of this effort, in November 1996, his team began research on what became the [[Etoys (programming language)|Etoys]] system. More recently he started, along with [[David A. Smith (computer scientist)|David A. Smith]], [[David P. Reed]], [[Andreas Raab]], Rick McGeer, [[Julian Lombardi]] and [[Mark McCahill]], the [[Croquet Project]], an open source networked 2D and 3D environment for collaborative work.

=== Tweak ===
In 2001, it became clear that the Etoy architecture in Squeak had reached its limits in what the Morphic interface infrastructure could do. [[Andreas Raab]] was a researcher working in Kay's group, then at Hewlett-Packard. He proposed defining a "script process" and providing a default scheduling mechanism that avoids several more general problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tweakproject.org/ABOUT/FAQ/OriginalTweakMemo/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002012532/http://tweakproject.org/ABOUT/FAQ/OriginalTweakMemo/|archivedate=2 October 2011|title=Events, Scripts &amp; Multiple Processes |author=[[Andreas Raab]] |date=6 July 2001 |accessdate=2009-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a new user interface, proposed to replace the Squeak Morphic user interface in the future. [[Tweak programming environment|Tweak]] added mechanisms of islands, asynchronous messaging, players and costumes, language extensions, projects, and tile scripting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tweakproject.org/TECHNOLOGY/Whitepapers/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002012629/http://tweakproject.org/TECHNOLOGY/Whitepapers/|archivedate=2 October 2011|title= Tweak: Whitepapers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its underlying object system is [[Class (computer programming)|class-based]], but to users (during programming) it acts like it is [[Prototype-based programming|prototype-based]]. Tweak objects are created and run in Tweak project windows.

=== Children's Machine ===
In November 2005, at the [[World Summit on the Information Society]], the MIT research laboratories unveiled a new laptop computer, for educational use around the world. It has many names: the $100 Laptop, the [[One Laptop per Child]] program, the Children's Machine, and the [[XO-1 (laptop)|XO-1]]. The program was begun and is sustained by Kay's friend, [[Nicholas Negroponte]], and is based on Kay's [[Dynabook]] ideal. Kay is a prominent co-developer of the computer, focusing on its educational software using Squeak and Etoys.

=== Reinventing programming ===
Kay has lectured extensively on the idea that the computer revolution is very new, and all of the good ideas have not been universally implemented.  Lectures at OOPSLA 1997 conference and his ACM Turing award talk, entitled "The Computer Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet" were informed by his experiences with [[Sketchpad]], [[Simula]], [[Smalltalk]], and the bloated code of commercial software.

On August 31, 2006, Kay's proposal to the United States [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) was granted, thus funding [[Viewpoints Research Institute]] for several years. The proposal title was: ''STEPS Toward the Reinvention of Programming'': A compact and Practical Model of Personal Computing as a Self-exploratorium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vpri.org/html/work/NSFproposal.pdf|title=Steps Toward The Reinvention of Programming – A Compact And Practical Model of Personal Computing As A Self-Exploratorium|author1=Alan Kay|author2=Dan Ingalls|author3=Yoshiki Ohshima|author4=Ian Piumarta|author5=[[Andreas Raab]]|access-date=2013-03-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508090431/http://www.vpri.org/html/work/NSFproposal.pdf|archive-date=2013-05-08|dead-url=yes|df=}} Proposal to NSF – Granted on August 31st 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A sense of what Kay is trying to do comes from this quote, from the abstract of a seminar on this given at Intel Research Labs, Berkeley: "The conglomeration of commercial and most open source software consumes in the neighborhood of several hundreds of millions of lines of code these days. We wonder: how small could be an understandable practical "Model T" design that covers this functionality? 1M lines of code? 200K LOC? 100K LOC? 20K LOC?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Kay |first=Alan |title=How Simply and Understandably Could The "Personal Computing Experience" Be Programmed? |url=http://www.intel-research.net/berkeley/viewseminarabstract.asp?index=605 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625105727/http://www.intel-research.net/berkeley/viewseminarabstract.asp?index=605 |archivedate=2007-06-25 |date=2006-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Awards and honors ===

The '''American Regions Mathematics League''' (ARML), is an annual, national high school mathematics team competition held simultaneously at four locations in the United States: the [[University of Iowa]], [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State]], [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas|UNLV]], and the newly added site at the [[University of Georgia]].  Past sites have included [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] and at [[Duke University]].

ARML is a prestigious, national math tournament that is often called the "World Series of Mathematics Competitions".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.exeter.edu/documents/Exeter_Bulletin/lo-rez008_pea_su07.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Teams consist of 15 members, which usually represent a large geographic region (such as a state) or a large population center (such as a major city).  Some math and science magnet schools, such as [[Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology]], VA, and the [[Bergen County Academies#AAST Math Team|Academy for the Advancement of Science and Technology]] (AAST), NJ, also field teams.  The competition is held on the first Saturday after Memorial Day.

As of 2014, over 150 teams competed with around 2000 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.arml.com/arml_scoring_permanent/score2013/page_structure/page/index.php?page=public_scores |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-05-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010093059/http://www.arml.com/arml_scoring_permanent/score2013/page_structure/page/index.php?page=public_scores |archive-date=2013-10-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ARML problems cover a wide variety of mathematical topics including [[algebra]], [[geometry]], [[number theory]], [[combinatorics]], [[probability]], and [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]]. [[Calculus]] is not required to successfully complete any problem, but may facilitate solving the problem more quickly or efficiently.  While part of the competition is short-answer based, there is a cooperative team round, and a proof-based power question (also completed as a team).  ARML problems are harder than most high school [[mathematics competitions]].

The contest is largely made possible by the monetary contribution of [[D. E. Shaw &amp; Co.]] among other smaller contributors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arml.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410162231/http://www.arml.com/ |date=2007-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition format==
The competition consists of four formal events:
* A '''team round''', where the entire team has 20 minutes to solve 10 problems. Each problem is worth 5 points, for a possible total of 50 points
* A '''power question''', where the entire team has one hour to solve a multiple-part (usually ten) question requiring explanations and proofs.  This is usually an unusual, unique, or invented topic so students are forced to deal with complex new mathematical ideas. Each problem is weighted for a possible 50 points.
* An '''individual round''', where each team member answers five groups of two questions each, with ten minutes per pair.  Starting in 2009, the individual round expanded from eight questions to ten. Each problem is worth 1 point, for a grand total of 150 points possible for the team. Only 12 students nationwide received a perfect score in 2014. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.arml.com/arml_scoring_permanent/score2013/page_structure/page/index.php?page=public_scores |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-05-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010093059/http://www.arml.com/arml_scoring_permanent/score2013/page_structure/page/index.php?page=public_scores |archive-date=2013-10-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This round's format is similar to that of the Target Round in MATHCOUNTS.
* A '''relay''', where the team is broken into five groups of three.  Within each group, the first team member solves a problem and passes the solution to the next team member, who plugs that answer into their question, and so on.  The allotted time is six minutes, but extra points are given for solving the problem in three minutes. Solving the relay in 3 minutes gives 5 points, solving it in 6 minutes gives 3 points. The whole process is done twice, making the maximum 50 points possible for the team.

At the end, the student(s) with the highest scores on the individual compete for first place.  Each student tied for the highest score is given a single question, and the quickest to get the correct answer wins. In the event of a tie (no one is able to get the correct answer in the given ten minutes), another tiebreaker is given, generally easier than the previous. The tiebreaker results are shared between the four sites to determine the top overall scorer, based on time to get the correct answer. The teams are scored based on the number of points they attained with the maximum being 300 points. 

In recent years, there has been a '''super relay''', where two groups of seven team members (fourteen in all) both work to give a correct answer to the fifteenth team member.  That last team member substitutes ''two'' answers into his problem.  For logistical reasons, the Super Relay has never counted towards the team score.  It was instituted as a "filler" while scores are tabulated. Candies and other goodies are sometimes rewards for the super relay round.

Also in recent years, a '''song contest''' has become an informal event at ARML.  Each school is allowed to have any number of their students perform a song related to mathematics, usually a parody of a popular song, with its lyrics replaced.

The format of the ARML competition is based on the [[New York State Mathematics League|NYSML competition]], but is generally considered{{By whom|date=August 2011}} more difficult than the NYSML competition.  This format also inspired the Great Plains Math League.

==History==
The [[New York State Mathematics League]] held its first competition in 1973, a competition intended for [[New York (state)|New York]] state teams.  A team from [[Massachusetts]] asked to participate in the 1974 NYSML competition, and it took first place.  This led to the creation of the ''Atlantic Regions Mathematics League'' in 1976, which became the American Regions Mathematics League in 1984.

When the Atlantic Regions Mathematics League was founded, the competition was held at a single eastern site that changed from year to year:

After 1983, the coordinators decided to keep the competition at Penn State University.  ARML expanded to two sites in the late 1980s and to three sites in 1995.  In 2008, ARML added a fourth site at the [[University of Georgia]] in Athens to better accommodate students in the Southeast.

The 2006 competition saw significant expansion.  Around 120 teams and a total of around 1800 students competed, which was around 25% larger than during any other year.  The attendance at the western site, [[UNLV]], nearly doubled.

__NOTOC__
'''Archigram''' was an [[avant-garde]] architectural group formed in the 1960s - based at the [[Architectural Association School of Architecture|Architectural Association]], [[London]] - that was [[neofuturistic]], anti-heroic and  pro-consumerist, drawing inspiration from technology in order to create a new reality that was solely expressed through hypothetical projects. The main members of the group were [[Peter Cook (architect)|Peter Cook]], [[Warren Chalk]], [[Ron Herron]], [[Dennis Crompton]], [[Michael Webb (architect)|Michael Webb]] and [[David Greene (architect)|David Greene]]. Designer [[Theo Crosby]] was the "hidden hand" behind the group.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Sadler, ''Archigram: architecture without architecture'', MIT Press, 2005, p.161&lt;/ref&gt; He gave them coverage in ''Architectural Design'' magazine (where he was an editor from 1953–62), brought them to the attention of the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London, where, in 1963, they mounted an exhibition called ''Living Cities'',&lt;ref&gt;Crosby raised the money for this from the Gulbenkian Foundation, and subsequently edited its publication in the ICA's ''Living Arts'' magazine: Sadler, ''op cit'', p.207&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1964 brought them into the Taylor Woodrow Design Group, which he headed, to take on experimental projects.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Cook, ''Archigram'', Princeton Architectural Press, 1999, p.44&lt;/ref&gt; The pamphlet ''Archigram I'' was printed in 1961 to proclaim their ideas. Committed to a 'high tech', light weight, infra-structural approach that was focused towards survival technology, the group experimented with modular technology, mobility through the environment, space capsules and mass-consumer imagery. Their works offered a seductive vision of a glamorous future machine age; however, social and environmental issues were left unaddressed. 

Archigram agitated to prevent modernism from becoming a sterile and safe orthodoxy by its adherents. Unlike ephemeralisation from [[Buckminster Fuller]] which assumes more must be done with less material (because material is finite), Archigram relies on a future of interminable resources.

The works of Archigram had a [[neofuturistic]] slant being influenced by [[Antonio Sant'Elia]]'s works. [[Buckminster Fuller]] and [[Yona Friedman]] were also important sources of inspiration. The works of Archigram served as a source of inspiration for later works such as the [[High-tech architecture|High tech]] '[[Centre Georges Pompidou|Pompidou centre]]' 1971 by  [[Richard Rogers]] and [[Renzo Piano]], early Norman Foster works, [[Gianfranco Franchini]] and [[Future Systems]]. By the early 1970s the strategy of the group had changed. In 1973 Theo Crosby wrote&lt;ref&gt;in ''How to play the environment game'', Penguin, p.49&lt;/ref&gt; that its members had "found their original impulses towards megastructures blunted by the changing intellectual climate in England, where the brash dreams of modern architects are received with ever-increasing horror. They are now more concerned with the infiltration of technology into the environment at a much less obvious level".

{{Cquote|If we consider for a moment [[Christo]]'s seminal work – the 'wrapped cliff' – we might see it in one of two ways: as a wrapped cliff or; preferably, as the point at which all other cliffs are unwrapped. An Archigram project attempts to achieve this same altered reading of the familiar (in the tradition of Buckminster Fuller's question, 'How much does your building weigh?'). It provides a new agenda where nomadism is the dominant social force; where time, exchange and metamorphosis replace stasis; where consumption, lifestyle and transience become the programme; and where the public realm is an electronic surface enclosing the globe —David Greene&lt;ref&gt;Crompton, Dennis (ed.) (1999). ''Concerning Archigram...'' London: Archigram Archives; prologue&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The group was financially supported by mainstream architects, such as [[David Rock (architect)|David Rock]] of [[Building Design Partnership|BDP]]. Rock later nominated Archigram for the [[RIBA]] [[Royal Gold Medal]] which they received in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/architecture/people/showcase/01-02/archigram.htm ''ARCHIGRAM - RIBA Royal Gold Medalists 2002''] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5vOX8Oikq?url=http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/architecture/people/showcase/01-02/archigram.htm |date=31 December 2010 }} Citation by '''David Rock''' retrieved 11 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sixpack France]] dedicated their Summer Spring 2009 Collection to this movement.

==Projects==
===Plug-in-City, Peter Cook, 1964===

Plug-in-City is a mega-structure with no buildings, just a massive framework into which dwellings in the form of cells or standardised components could be slotted. The machine had taken over and people were the raw material being processed, the difference being that people are meant to enjoy the experience.

===The Walking City, Ron Herron, 1964===

The [[Walking city|Walking City]] is constituted by intelligent buildings or robots that are in the form of giant, self-contained living pods that could roam the cities. The form derived from a combination of insect and machine and was a literal interpretation of le-Corbusier's aphorism of a house as a machine for living in. The pods were independent, yet parasitic as they could 'plug into' way stations to exchange occupants or replenish resources. The citizen is therefore a serviced nomad not totally dissimilar from today's executive cars. The context was perceived as a future ruined world in the aftermath of a nuclear war.

===Instant City ===

Instant City is a mobile technological event that drifts into underdeveloped, drab towns via air (balloons) with provisional structures (performance spaces) in tow. The effect is a deliberate overstimulation to produce mass culture, with an embrace of advertising aesthetics. The whole endeavor is intended to eventually move on leaving behind advanced technology hook-ups.

===Other projects===

Tuned City, in which Archigram's infrastructural and spatial additions attach themselves to an existing town at a percentage that leaves evidence of the previous development, rather than subsuming the whole.

[[Image:BenjaminRussell ca1850.png|thumb|right|Benjamin Russell, ca.1850]]

'''Benjamin Russell''' (October 16, 1804 &amp;ndash; March 3, 1885) was an [[list of American artists|American artist]] best known for his accurate [[watercolor]]s of [[whaling]] ships working in [[New England]]. Born in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]], to a wealthy family, Russell started drawing and painting in his late 30s, after a few years spent working as a [[cooper (profession)|cooper]] aboard a whaling ship.
[[Image:WhalingVoyage ca1848 byRussell and Purrington detail NewBedfordWhalingMuseum2.png|300px|thumb|left|Detail from ''Whaling Voyage Round the World'' by Russell &amp; Purrington, ca.1848]]

Russell's depiction of [[perspective (visual)|perspective]] and depth are stiff and flat, and his images "were appreciated more for their accurate representation than their artistic value."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benjamin Russell - New Bedford Whaling Museum |url=http://www.inch.com/~penney/museum_site/collect/c04-russ.htm |work=Benjamin Russell entry |accessdate=29 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527022521/http://www.inch.com/~penney/museum_site/collect/c04-russ.htm |archivedate=27 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, most of his work is perfectly to scale, resembling control drawings, and Russell watercolors are some of the better views of the mid-19th-century American whaling industry, until photography became available in the 1850s.

Russell began making lithographs in 1848, and began teaching art in [[Rhode Island]], after the [[American Civil War]] ended in 1865.

'''Belinda "Billie" Ashford''' is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera ''[[Home and Away]]'', played by [[Tessa de Josselin]]. The actress was first pictured on set in November 2014, before it was announced the following year that she had joined the cast as the younger sister of established character [[Martin Ashford (Home and Away)|Martin Ashford]] (George Mason). De Josselin shot her first scenes in a cemetery on the [[Central Coast (New South Wales)|Central Coast]]. She made her first appearance during the episode broadcast on 27 April 2015. The actress departed the show at the end of her guest stint, but she was later asked back by the producers and she became part of the regular cast.

Billie is portrayed as a feisty, upfront, "tomboy surfer". Bille's introductory storylines focused on her reunion with her brother Ash and a brief casual relationship with [[Kyle Braxton]] ([[Nic Westaway]]). Later storylines saw Billie develop an infatuation with [[Nate Cooper]] ([[Kyle Pryor]]) after he saved her life. She became jealous of his relationship with [[Kat Chapman]] ([[Pia Miller]]) and tried to ruin her career. As the storyline progressed, Billie accused Nate of assaulting her, leading to his arrest. The storyline was criticised by Rosa Walling-Wefelmeyer of [[The F-Word (feminist blog)|The F-Word]], who thought it could potentially reinforce harmful stereotypes about victims of sexual violence.

Billie was then accused of [[arson|burning down]] [[Leah Patterson-Baker]]'s ([[Ada Nicodemou]]) house, despite helping to save three of its occupants and sustaining serious burns. Following a brief departure, Billie returned to [[Summer Bay]] for her court appearance. Billie's early storylines have led her to be called "unhinged", "troublesome" and "the Bay's bad girl" by critics. Billie was later raped by [[Mick Jennings]] ([[Kristian Schmid]]) and became pregnant with his child. She also had a relationship with a then seventeen year old [[VJ Patterson]] (Matt Little). Shortly after giving birth to her daughter, [[Luc Patterson|Luc]], Billie was diagnosed with terminal cancer and she died on 15 February 2017.

==Casting==
On 14 November 2014, Sarah Sayers of the ''[[Daily Mail Australia]]'' reported [[Tessa de Josselin]] had joined the cast of ''Home and Away'' in an unknown role.&lt;ref name="Sayers"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2834757/Beach-babe-alert-Home-Away-newcomer-Tessa-Josselin-sizzles-set-Summer-Bay-pineapple-print-bikini.html|title=Beach babe alert!

===Characterisation===
Billie is the younger sister of [[Martin Ashford (Home and Away)|Martin Ashford]] (George Mason), who was introduced in late 2014.&lt;ref name="Outback"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ellis|first1=Sarah|date=7–13 February 2015|title=Brax &amp; Ash's outback adventure|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=5|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Billie is a feisty, "tomboy surfer", who endured a troubled childhood.&lt;ref name="MeetBillie"/&gt; De Josselin said Billie was fun to play and added "Billie's super upfront and sometimes lacks a social filter."&lt;ref name="MeetBillie"/&gt; De Josselin told Stephen Downie of ''[[TV Week]]'' that she shared some similarities with Billie, such as being "very active", but did not think she was as abrasive and as closed off as Billie.&lt;ref name="SurferGirl"/&gt; De Josselin added, "I think she puts on a front – her kind of tough-girl thing – but I think that's hiding a lot of stuff on the inside."&lt;ref name="SurferGirl"/&gt; The actress was grateful to the writers for writing in her passion for surfing and joked that she always wanted more surfing scenes in the scripts.&lt;ref name="Courting"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downie|first=Stephen|date=6–12 February 2016|title=Courting disaster|journal=[[TV Week]]|issue=6|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introduction===
After he was released from prison, Ash began a search to find his sister. Mason commented, "Billie is the only family Ash has left, and he feels they need to make amends now he's out of jail."&lt;ref name="Outback"/&gt; The siblings were finally reunited on [[Anzac Day]] when they both visited their brother Luke's grave.&lt;ref name="NewArrival"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/neighbours/news/a652328/soap-spoilers-heartbreak-for-paige-in-neighbours-and-a-new-arrival-for-home-and-away/|title=Soap spoilers: Heartbreak for Paige in Neighbours and a new arrival for Home and Away|last=Dainty|first=Sophie|date=13 June 2015|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Billie ran away from Ash and tried to leave in her car, but he stood in the way and asked her not to go. She eventually agreed to stay and they returned to Luke's grave, where they talked about their past.&lt;ref name="NewArrival"/&gt; Ash then convinced Billie to return to [[Summer Bay]] with him, so he could show her around.

When Ash offered to let Billie stay in his caravan, she turned him down and decided to stay at the Braxton house instead. De Josselin commented that Billie was "excited" about meeting new people and finally having a roof over her head, as she had been living out of her car for the past few months.&lt;ref name="Sweet"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downie|first=Stephen|date=2–8 May 2015|title=Sweet music|journal=[[TV Week]]|issue=18|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unaware that Billie was in the other room, [[Kyle Braxton]] ([[Nic Westaway]]) came home and started playing his guitar, waking her up. Billie introduced herself to Kyle and explained that Ricky had allowed her to stay at the house.&lt;ref name="Sweet"/&gt; Kyle apologised for waking her and Billie began flirting with him, before leaning over to kiss him.&lt;ref name="Sweet"/&gt; De Josselin told Stephen Downie of ''[[TV Week]]'', "I think Billie can sense Kyle's a sensitive, caring guy. She can also sense he's going through something."&lt;ref name="Sweet"/&gt; Despite going through a recent break-up, Kyle responded to the kiss and he and Billie had a one-night stand.&lt;ref name="Sweet"/&gt; Kyle felt guilty the following morning and made it clear to Billie that their night together was a mistake.&lt;ref name="Passionate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/neighbours/news/a653859/soap-spoilers-neighbours-newcomer-arrives-and-kyle-and-billie-get-passionate-in-home-and-away/|title=Soap spoilers: Neighbours newcomer arrives and Kyle and Billie get passionate in Home and Away|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=20 June 2015|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Kyle's ex-girlfriend, [[Phoebe Nicholson]] ([[Isabella Giovinazzo]]) came over to reconcile with him, she overheard Kyle asking Billie to keep their one-night stand a secret.&lt;ref name="Passionate"/&gt;

===Assault allegation===
Billie's first major storyline occurred in June 2015 when she developed a crush on [[Nate Cooper]] ([[Kyle Pryor]]) and later accused him of assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/home-and-away/news/a655463/home-and-away-billie-ashford-to-accuse-nate-cooper-of-sexual-assault/|title=Home and Away: Billie Ashford to accuse Nate Cooper of sexual assault|last=Dainty|first=Sophie|date=29 June 2015|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storyline began when Nate and his girlfriend [[Kat Chapman]] ([[Pia Miller]]) spotted Billie floating face down in the sea.&lt;ref name="Triangle"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downie|first=Stephen|date=13–19 June 2015|title=Love triangle|journal=[[TV Week]]|issue=24|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nate ran into the surf to get Billie and carried her to the beach, where he administered [[mouth-to-mouth resuscitation]] to get her breathing again. As Billie came round, Nate assured her she would be okay.&lt;ref name="Triangle"/&gt; As Billie looked at Nate "adoringly", Stephen Downie of ''TV Week'' noted that she was developing a crush on the doctor.&lt;ref name="Triangle"/&gt; Billie's crush on Nate intensified and she began trying to break up his relationship with Kat.&lt;ref name="Shock"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downie|first=Stephen|date=27 June – 3 July 2015|title=Assault shock!|journal=[[TV Week]]|issue=26|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nate rejected Billie's advances and made it clear to her that he was not interested in her romantically, which she seemed to accept.&lt;ref name="NArrested"&gt;{{cite journal|date=22–28 August 2015|title=Nate arrested!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=33|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Billie later approached Nate when she found herself alone with him in the gym and thanked him for being a gentleman, unnerving Nate.&lt;ref name="NArrested"/&gt; Billie's demeanour suddenly changed and she ran her nails down his cheek, scratching his face, and tore at her clothes, while screaming for him to stop.&lt;ref name="NArrested"/&gt; Her screams attracted the attention of [[Chris Harrington (Home and Away)|Chris Harrington]] ([[Johnny Ruffo]]), who rushed into the gym and comforted Billie, as she accused Nate of assaulting her.&lt;ref name="NArrested"/&gt; Nate was questioned by Sergeant [[Mike Emerson]] (Cameron Stewart) at the police station, where he protested his innocence. However, Emerson then produced proof of a sexually explicit text sent from Nate's phone to Billie the previous week.&lt;ref name="Shock"/&gt;

Nate was arrested for the attempted sexual assault of Billie. Kat immediately began trying to prove that Nate was innocent, but had difficulty as Billie "put on a confident performance" for the police, while Chris also backed up her story.&lt;ref name="NArrested"/&gt; However, Nate and Kat came to Chris to plead Nate's innocence and then asked him to help catch Billie out. Chris agreed to help them after finding evidence that Billie was behind an embarrassing poster that threatened to ruin Kat's career.&lt;ref name="Busted"&gt;{{cite journal|date=29 August – 4 September 2015|title=Billie busted!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=34|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris invited Billie over to his house and then tried to get her to confess to setting Nate up. He told her that he knew she was lying, but he wanted to see Nate punished and suggested they work together.&lt;ref name="Busted"/&gt; Billie soon spotted that Chris's phone was recording the conversation and she switched it off, while claiming that she had not fallen for his plan.&lt;ref name="Busted"/&gt; However, when she also admitted to framing Nate, Chris revealed that he was actually wearing a police wire and Billie was arrested by Emerson.&lt;ref name="Busted"/&gt; De Josselin found the storyline challenging to portray, saying "it's not something I would ever do. So, there's a challenge with breaking it down and thinking from the perspective of your character."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvweeklogieawards.com.au/news/articles/2015/12/tessa-de-josselins-star-status-on-the-rise/|title=Tessa de Josselin's star status on the rise|date=14 December 2015|work=[[TV Week]]|accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arson accusation and depression===

When Billie noticed [[Leah Patterson-Baker]]'s ([[Ada Nicodemou]]) house was on fire, she ran into the building to help [[Zac MacGuire]] ([[Charlie Clausen]]) rescue [[Oscar MacGuire]] (Jake Speer) and [[Matt Page]] (Alec Snow).&lt;ref name="Horror"&gt;{{cite journal|date=5–11 September 2016|title=Summer Bay fire horror!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=35|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; She helped Zac kick down a bedroom door, allowing Oscar and Matt to escape. As the men rushed to get out of the house, they inadvertently left Billie behind.&lt;ref name="Horror"/&gt; She became trapped by falling ceiling debris and was seriously injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/home-and-away/spoilers/a665959/leahs-house-fire-is-confirmed-as-arson/|title=Leah's house fire is confirmed as arson|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=29 August 2015|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Billie was recovering at the hospital, Kat arrested her for arson. Ash refused to believe that she was innocent, following her false assault allegation against Nate, and walked away from her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/home-and-away/spoilers/a665961/accusations-fly-around-after-the-fire/|title=Accusations fly around after the fire|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=29 August 2015|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Billie began to feel that no one cared about her, she "fell into a dark depression", leaving Nate concerned about her state of mind.&lt;ref name="Cliffhanger"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morgan|first=Laura|date=12–25 September 2015|title=Cliffhanger!|journal=[[All About Soap]]|issue=357|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nate urged Ash to visit her in the hospital. Ash realised that Billie would not be able to cope with losing another sibling, so he tried to "clear the air" between them.&lt;ref name="Cliffhanger"/&gt;

However, when Ash voiced his doubts about Billie's innocence, she grew angry and disowned him.&lt;ref name="Cliffhanger"/&gt; Billie then decided to get revenge by writing a letter to Ricky telling her that Brax had faked his death and that Ash had lied to her about it.&lt;ref name="Cliffhanger"/&gt; When Billie discharged herself from the hospital, Nate told Kat that he was worried about her mental and physical health, as her burns needed constant treatment.&lt;ref name="Cliffhanger"/&gt; Kat was also aware that Billie was close to breaching her bail conditions and she and Ash began a search. After failing to find her, they called off the search for the night, leaving Ash feeling guilty.&lt;ref name="Cliffhanger"/&gt; The following day, Kat found Billie on top of the [[headland]].&lt;ref name="Plunge"&gt;{{cite journal|date=12–18 September 2015|title=Kat's cliff plunge!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=36|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Josselin told an ''[[Inside Soap]]'' journalist that Billie felt that she had lost her brother and that the whole town was against her, so she had no reason to stay in Summer Bay.&lt;ref name="Plunge"/&gt;

Kat was worried that Billie might jump due to her unstable behaviour, so she tried to talk her into stepping away from the edge.&lt;ref name="Plunge"/&gt; However, it appeared Billie had not heard her as she continued to stare at the sea. When a message came through on Kat's police radio, it startled Billie and in her panic at seeing Kat, she moved closer to the edge of the cliff.&lt;ref name="Plunge"/&gt; De Josselin commented, "When Billie hears Kat's radio, she snaps straight back to reality. She immediately thinks that Kat is there to arrest her for setting fire to Leah's house."&lt;ref name="Plunge"/&gt; Kat was worried that Billie might fall and reached out to grab her in an attempt to save her. Billie stepped to the side at the last minute, causing Kat to go over the edge. She managed to grab hold of a ledge and called for Billie to help her.&lt;ref name="Plunge"/&gt; Billie managed to save Kat by pulling her back over. At the hospital, Billie reiterated that she did not start the fire, before she was transferred to a hospital in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/home-and-away/spoilers/a666027/billie-tries-to-rescue-kat/|title=Billie tries to rescue Kat|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=5 September 2015|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return and trial===
Months later Billie found an unconscious [[Oscar MacGuire]] (Jake Speer) washed up on a beach. She dragged him to a nearby shack, shook him awake and gave him fresh water.&lt;ref name="Alive"&gt;{{cite journal|date=5–11 March 2016|title=Oscar is alive!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=9|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he came round, Oscar was surprised to see Billie was his rescuer and immediately accused her of trying to burn Leah's house down with him inside.&lt;ref name="Alive"/&gt; Bille maintained her innocence and explained to Oscar that she had been living rough since leaving town a few months prior. She then called the police to tell them where Oscar was.&lt;ref name="Alive"/&gt; He wondered if she would return to the Bay with him to see Ash, but she quickly left. Despite Billie not wanting to be found, Oscar told them that she had rescued him.&lt;ref name="Alive"/&gt; Billie was eventually persuaded to return to Summer Bay ahead of her trial for arson.&lt;ref name="Runner"&gt;{{cite journal|date=19–25 March 2016|title=Will Billie do a runner?|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=11|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ash now believed his sister was innocent and was against her lawyer's suggestion that she should plead guilty to gain a lesser sentence.&lt;ref name="Runner"/&gt; He was also worried about her future, and when Phoebe told Billie his fears, she decided that the only option she had was to skip town. Phoebe managed to talk her round, but the following morning, they realised Billie had tried to flee and stopped her.&lt;ref name="Runner"/&gt;

Speaking to Ali Cromarty of ''TV Week'', de Josselin explained that Billie knew she had been set up, but she was "at a loss" because she did not know who really started the fire.&lt;ref name="Courting"/&gt; As she entered the courtroom, Billie was nervous and apprehensive. She knew she was innocent, but she was not sure the judge would feel the same way. She also thought her reputation and past could be used against her.&lt;ref name="Courting"/&gt; De Josselin said, "she feels there are so many things that have happened in the past, so why would anyone believe her? She's feeling disheartened."&lt;ref name="Courting"/&gt; The actress added that Billie was "resigned" to going to prison, especially after Leah gave her testimony.&lt;ref name="InCourt"&gt;{{cite journal|date=26 March – 1 April 2016|title=Billie in court!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=12|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Billie's fate rested on whether the real arsonist, [[Hunter King (Home and Away)|Hunter King]] (Scott Lee), would stand up and confess. Already struggling with his guilt, Hunter was put under more pressure when [[Andy Barrett]] ([[Tai Hara]]) admitted he knew Hunter had started the fire.&lt;ref name="InCourt"/&gt; Cromarty pointed out that if Billie was found innocent, it could be the chance she needed to change her ways.&lt;ref name="Courting"/&gt; De Josselin agreed, stating "all Billie wants is to feel a part of the Summer Bay family. She's upset she's been falsely accused. It could be a turning point – if she can get over it."&lt;ref name="Courting"/&gt; Hunter eventually admitted to starting the fire, clearing Billie's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/home-and-away/pictures/guilty-hunter-confesses-to-arson-in-home-and-away|title=Guilty!

===Relationship with VJ Patterson===
{{Quote box|width=16%|align=right|bgcolor=#E6E6FA|quote="For Billie, there's this beautiful person willing to be there for her when she's needing love."&lt;ref name="Healed"/&gt;|source=—De Josselin on Billie and VJ's relationship (May 2016).}}
A few months later, Billie was given a love interest in the form of seven&lt;!--VJ's age has been changed, see SORAS.--&gt;teen year old [[VJ Patterson]] (Matt Little).&lt;ref name="BigCrush"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/home-and-away/news/a794037/soap-spoilers-home-and-aways-hunter-has-a-shocking-health-scare-while-vj-has-a-big-crush/|title=Soap spoilers: Home and Away's Hunter has a shocking health scare, while VJ has a big crush|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=14 May 2016|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story arc began with VJ developing a crush on Billie, who was initially amused by his flirty behaviour. When she noticed VJ trying unsuccessfully to teach [[Skye Peters]] (Marlo Kelly) how to surf, she offered her help.&lt;ref name="BigCrush"/&gt; When Skye told VJ how good Billie was at teaching her, VJ's quick agreement caused Skye to realise he had feelings for Billie, despite his denial.&lt;ref name="BigCrush"/&gt; VJ later asks Skye to pose as his girlfriend to make Billie jealous, as he believes Billie will want him if she thinks he is unavailable.&lt;ref name="LG"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downie|first=Stephen|date=2–8 April 2016|title=Love game|journal=[[TV Week]]|issue=14|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wanted to prove to Billie that he was "definite boyfriend material".&lt;ref name="LG"/&gt; Skye thought the plan was "silly", but VJ pointed out that it could help her catch Oscar's attention too.&lt;ref name="LG"/&gt; Although Billie was initially uninterested in VJ, she began to develop feelings for him and his friendship helped provide a distraction from everything that had happened to her.&lt;ref name="Healed"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cromarty|first=Ali|date=7–13 May 2016|title=Healed with a kiss|journal=[[TV Week]]|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt;

In an interview with Kerry Harvey of [[Stuff.co.nz]], de Josselin admitted to being surprised by the development.&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt; She thought the age gap between Billie and VJ, who were twenty-three and seventeen respectively, was "a big difference in real life", but she was okay with it and thought that the relationship had a good chance.&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt; She stated, "I don't think age is too much of a deciding factor. If two people are compatible and they've got a good strong bond then they've got a good chance of making it work."&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt; When VJ's mother, [[Leah Patterson-Baker]] ([[Ada Nicodemou]]) spotted Billie and VJ together, she was "livid" to learn they were in an intimate relationship.&lt;ref name="Mother"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downie|first=Stephen|date=14–20 May 2016|title=Mother knows best|journal=[[TV Week]]|issue=20|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was concerned about the age gap, as VJ was still at school. Leah was also aware of Billie's past and her bad reputation.&lt;ref name="Mother"/&gt; De Josselin thought Leah had not had a chance to get to know Billie, especially as she had changed. She also was not aware of how genuine the couple's feelings for each other were.&lt;ref name="Mother"/&gt; The actress also said that Billie's new relationship was helping to heal her and she could tell VJ really loved her.&lt;ref name="Mother"/&gt; Leah and VJ's stepfather Zac chose to support the couple.&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt;

Months later, on his 18th birthday, VJ proposes to Billie. VJ creates a romantic setting in the garden by stringing up fairy lights to spell out "Will you marry me?", but it is "the last thing Billie is expecting" and she turns down the proposal.&lt;ref name="Marry"&gt;{{cite journal|date=19–25 November 2016|title=Marry me, Billie!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=46|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; VJ was "gutted" by the rejection and demanded to know why Billie did not want to marry him. Unable to tell him the truth about the paternity of her unborn child, Billie explains that she thinks VJ only proposed because she is pregnant.&lt;ref name="Marry"/&gt; VJ then gave Billie an ultimatum, saying that if she does not want to get married, then he thinks they should end their relationship. Billie eventually gives into pressure and accepts his proposal.&lt;ref name="Marry"/&gt;

A couple of months later, Billie finally tells VJ the truth about how she conceived her baby.&lt;ref name="Runaway"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Sarah|date=28 January – 3 February 2017|title=The runaway bride!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=4|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; As VJ says his vows during their wedding, Billie realises that she is unable to go through with marrying him and runs away. When VJ demands to know why she has changed her mind, Billie reveals that the baby is not his and that she was raped.&lt;ref name="Runaway"/&gt; A spokesperson told Sarah Ellis of ''Inside Soap'', "The sad thing is, if she had been honest with him from the start, he probably would have stood by her. Instead, she's lied to him for months and humiliated him in front of his loved ones."&lt;ref name="Runaway"/&gt; VJ admits that he still loves Billie, but he cannot promise that they have a future together.&lt;ref name="Runaway"/&gt;

===Rape and pregnancy===
At the same time Billie was beginning a relationship with VJ, she was struggling to cope after being raped by a masked man in the gym.&lt;ref name="Healed"/&gt; She initially kept her assault a secret, until she confided in Oscar, who later died in an explosion, and Phoebe, who agreed to keep quiet.&lt;ref name="Harvey"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/tv-radio/tv-guide/80859688/Home-And-Aways-Tessa-de-Josselin-says-her-rape-storyline-was-confronting|title=Home And Away's Tessa de Josselin says her rape storyline was confronting|last=Harvey|first=Kerry|date=9 June 2016|publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]]|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Josselin commented, "She's really traumatised by the incident and is looking for some reassurance that everything is going to be OK."&lt;ref name="Healed"/&gt; The actress wished that Billie had listened to Phoebe, who advised her to go to the police, as she thought Billie would have been able to take control of the situation.&lt;ref name="BabyLie"&gt;{{cite journal|date=9–15 July 2016|title=Billie's baby lie!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=27|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to her past, Billie was reluctant to report her attack. De Josselin said that it was "very hard" for Billie, and that things would get more difficult as the story arc continued.&lt;ref name="Healed"/&gt; de Josselin explained to Harvey (Stuff.co.nz) that everything had just started to go well for Billie, so the attack had blindsided her and left her in shock.&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt; She continued, "I think initially it's not even really registering in her brain that it happened and that it was real. I think after that she just starts to freak out that no one will believe her because of her past behaviour."&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt;

As the storyline developed, the character soon learned that she was pregnant as a result of her assault. De Josselin admitted that the rape and pregnancy was "a confronting storyline" for her. She did a lot of research before filming to gain an understanding of how women feel after being assaulted.&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt; When Billie was admitted to hospital with severe morning sickness, Ash came to see her and found out she was pregnant. As Billie could not face telling him about her assault, she let him assume VJ was the father of her baby. Ash then confronted VJ, who was shocked to learn he was going to be a father.&lt;ref name="BabyLie"/&gt; Billie undertakes "bizarre behaviour" to hide her ordeal by doctoring her medical records to alter her date of conception.&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt; Billie later discovered that [[Irene Roberts]]' ([[Lynne McGranger]]) son, [[Mick Jennings]] ([[Kristian Schmid]]) is her rapist and the father of her child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvweeklogieawards.com.au/news/articles/2016/6/this-weeks-home-and-away-recap/|title=This week's Home And Away recap|date=23 June 2016|work=[[TV Week]]|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Departure===
On 23 August 2016, the ''[[Daily Mail Australia]]'' published photos taken at Palm Beach, where the show's outdoor scenes are filmed, appearing to show Phoebe mourning Billie at a makeshift memorial on the beach, leading to speculation that the character would be killed off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3753979/Home-Away-kills-MAJOR-character.html|title=Spoiler alert!

While watching the sun rise, Billie dies in VJ's arms.&lt;ref name="Heartbreaking"/&gt; After her character's exit aired, de Josselin revealed that she was "bummed out" when the producers told her that Billie would die, as she wanted her to carry on and do good things. She also felt sadness at seeing a character she had "built, lived and breathed for so long" go.&lt;ref name="Out"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Thomas|date=4–10 March 2016|title=I was bummed out|journal=[[TV Week]]|issue=9|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actress added that she found Billie's final storyline interesting and was glad that she finally achieved peace.&lt;ref name="Out"/&gt;

'''Camp Rising Sun ''' is an [[international]], full-[[scholarship]], leadership summer program for [[students]] aged 14–16 by the Louis August Jonas Foundation (LAJF), a [[non-profit organization]]. Its seven-week program was operated from a boys' facility in [[Red Hook, New York]], and a separate girls' facility in [[Clinton, Dutchess County, New York|Clinton, New York]], about {{convert|90|mi}} north of [[New York City]] in the [[Hudson River Valley]]. Participants come from all over the world and are chosen by merit. Instead of being asked to pay for tuition, campers are requested to pass along, to someone else, the benefits they gained.

There are alumni organizations in numerous countries with more than 5,000 alumni around the world. Among the Camp Rising Sun alumni are a [[United Nations]] Under-[[Secretary General]]; a president of [[Harvard University]]; a winner of the [[Intel Science Talent Search]]; a [[Foreign Minister]] of [[South Korea]]; two former [[Israel]]i ambassadors; an [[Under Secretary of State]] in the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] administration; and [[folk singer]] [[Pete Seeger]].

In 1996, a group of Danish and other European alumni founded Camp Rising Sun Europe for young women. Organized and maintained by the George E. Jonas Foundation and the Camp Rising Sun Alumni Association of Denmark, the program was located in Stendis, [[Region Midtjylland]], [[Denmark]].

The son of a successful businessman, Jonas grew up in privilege and wealth, but was troubled about the advantages he had in comparison with others.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;Carey Winfrey, [https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F30811F83C5E167493C0AB178AD95F438785F9 "Columbia Hails a Boyhood Friend"], ''The New York Times'' (November 22, 1977).

Pondering what he could do to bring a measure of stability and peace to the world, he reasoned that hope rested in the youth of the world and he began to consider what might encourage, stimulate and motivate them. He got the idea to start a camp, one that "is interested not merely in the boy, but in the man the boy will become."&lt;ref name="csm" /&gt; He set up a foundation, naming it after his father; the foundation runs the camp. For decades, Jonas personally interviewed many prospective campers&lt;ref name="flagler" /&gt; and he was fondly called by all by his nickname, "Freddie."&lt;ref name="csm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;

After [[World War II]], the program  was expanded to include youth from every region of the world.

However, in 2018, the campers decided that this word was unjustly stolen from Native American culture. Thus, they ended the use of the word.

The goal of the program is that participants would integrate what they learn at Camp Rising Sun into their lives and pass it along to others.&lt;ref name="csm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="melinda" /&gt; After the two months of sharing and working together, Jonas wanted campers to return to their communities the benefits they had gained.

== International community ==
The roughly 60 participants each year are students from more than 30 countries who are invited to attend the camp.

==Camp activities==
Jonas said, "Schools give you technical training, but they don't necessarily teach you how to think" and set up his camp to supply that need.&lt;ref name="flagler" /&gt; Thus, while CRS includes [[Human swimming|swimming]], [[boating]], [[hiking]], [[ping pong]], [[soccer]], [[basketball]], [[tennis]], and other sports, its focus is on providing opportunities for intellectual growth, for development of leadership skills, and appreciation of the value of diversity. The program challenges campers to try new things, but also offers them the option of participating or not, a freedom some have never experienced before.&lt;ref name="piano" /&gt; Campers work together in peer-led teams to take care of the daily maintenance needs of the camp. Counselors are skilled in a variety of disciplines from [[lifesaving]] to [[Japanese wrestling]] to [[filmmaking]].&lt;ref name="csm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="flagler" /&gt; There is instruction by staff, visiting alumni, guests, or other students on subjects like international affairs, poetry, theater, microscopes, filmmaking,&lt;ref name="flagler" /&gt; [[creative writing]], [[landscaping]],&lt;ref name="csm" /&gt; history, music, art, drama,&lt;ref name="brickle" /&gt; philosophy, ethics, and nature. Three weekly newspapers, written and produced by campers, document the comedic, artistic, and overall progress of the camp.

Students work on projects they conceive, plan and manage, both individually and in peer-led groups. There are evening artistic and intellectual programs, most often planned and executed by campers. At the end of July, there is a dramatic or musical production, involving the entire camp community. Each Saturday evening, there is a large campfire, at which campers discuss their different countries and cultures, about global issues, prejudice and hate and hear presentations, sometimes by outside lecturers.&lt;ref name="brickle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="csm" /&gt;

There is also time available each day for campers to pursue their own activity, be it sports, the arts, reading, an educational pursuit, swimming in the pool or just talking with other campers. Campers are encouraged to keep a journal and prepare other written material that is kept on file and sent to the camper at his&lt;ref name="csm" /&gt; or her twenty-first birthday.

A camper's journal from 2006 offers a glimpse of a typical day at Camp Rising Sun.

{{quote|After waking up at 8 a.m., I had breakfast, attended morning assembly, and worked in the kitchen during teamwork time. For project time, a few campers and I mapped out a plan for a garden that we hoped to plant on cabin hill. After lunch and rest hour, I went to an instruction called "Words Words Words" where a counselor Amy ([[Utah]]) and about seven campers practiced creative writing and poetry.

During free time I went swimming with a bunch of other campers. It was Hester's ([[Netherlands]]) birthday, so dinner became a celebration. I received five letters, and since it's camp tradition, I had to sing to receive them. For the evening program we did Scottish dancing. It was a fun-filled day! After tent check at 10 p.m., I stayed awake and talked with Sepideh ([[Iran]]), Anissa ([[New York (state)|New York]]), Su Bin ([[Korea]]) and Annalisa (Utah), the hiking counselor.&lt;ref name="eva" /&gt;}}

Because of the worldwide [[financial crisis]] that began in 2007, there was no camp program held in 2009 in the United States and the European program was cancelled for 2010.

On September 10, 2014, the LAJF Board outlined its view on financial challenges facing the organization, including the need for a $10 million increase in its endowment in order to meet current and future needs. The LAJF Board made available on the website a presentation from a summit in September 2014 which provided additional details on LAJF’s financial condition and the Board’s views on potential options for the organization. On October 3, 2014, it was announced that as part of its “New Dawn for Rising Sun” program, that the board had unanimously voted to put up for sale both the Red Hook and Clinton campuses, and to begin the process of securing a new site for an undisclosed new program(s) in order to improve the fiscal health of the organization. In addition to the sale of the two campuses, the LAJF Board announced that the 2015 camp season would consist of two 4 week sessions each for the boys and girls, both of which were to take place at the Clinton campus. The LAJF Board also announced a new $4 million fund raising campaign. &lt;ref&gt; [https://web.archive.org/web/20141023025421/http://risingsun.org/polBlogs.cfm?doctype_code=TENTHILL&amp;doc_id=16139  My View From Tent Hill: The Future of CRS and a New Dawn for Rising Sun] Retrieved December 24, 2017. &lt;/ref&gt;

This change in direction from the LAJF Board of Directors led some alumni to voice their concerns.

In mid 2015, after extensive meetings by the Board's Strategic Planning, Building &amp; Grounds and Finance Committees, the LAJF Board agreed to consider the reopening of the Red Hook campus provided certain funds were raised by the alumni, $550,000 of which was needed to be raised by early September, to gain a "formal" commitment to do so.

==CRS alumni==
CRS campers become members of an international alumni group that are supportive of their evolving interests in college and careers. The LAJF Web site has a College Roster that connects young alumni with older alumni who are attending or have attended a broad range of colleges, universities and professional schools. Many alumni later spoke of their experiences at CRS, such as when writing their college essays.&lt;ref name="flagler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="melinda" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pres"&gt;[http://www.presidentialscholars.org/scholars_state2.asp?school_state=MS&amp;offset=15 2005: Wes (James W) Johnson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722194307/http://www.presidentialscholars.org/scholars_state2.asp?school_state=MS&amp;offset=15 |date=2011-07-22 }} Presidential Scholars Foundation, official website.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2790">[[Barrington Moore, Jr.|Barrington Moore]] defines '''Catonism''' in his book ''[[Barrington Moore, Jr.|Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy]]'' as "advocacy of the sterner virtues, [[militarism]], contempt for 'decadent' foreigners and [[anti-intellectualism]]".&lt;ref name="origins"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Moore coined the word "Catonism" with a nod towards [[Cato the Elder]] (234-149 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;

| quote                 = The key elements in the rhetoric - advocacy of the sterner virtues, militarism, contempt for 'decadent' foreigners, and anti-intellectualism - appear in the West at least as early as Cato the Elder (234-149 B.C.) who operated his own ''latifundium'' with slave labor. It is fitting, therefore, to label this complex of ideas with his name. A similar rhetoric, according to some authorities also in response to a threat to traditional peasant economy, had emerged in China with the legalists, around the 4th century B.C.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
He characterized the Catonist attitude as the reaction from rural aristocracy towards rapid political and economic changes:

{{quote|...The function of Catonism is too obvious to require more than brief comment.  It justifies a repressive social order that buttresses the position of those in power. It denies the existence of actual changes that have hurt the peasants. It denies the need for further social changes, especially revolutionary ones. Perhaps Catonism may also relieve the conscience of those most responsible for the damage - after all, military expansion destroyed the Roman peasantry.

Modern versions of Catonism arise too out of the adoption by the landed upper classes of repressive and exploitative methods in response to the increasing intrusion of market relationships into an agrarian economy...&lt;ref name="origins"/&gt;}}

'''Charles Faulkner''' (born January 12, 1952) is an [[Americans|American]] who is a practitioner of [[neuro-linguistic programming]] (NLP), [[life coach]], [[motivational speaker]], [[Trader (finance)|trader]] and author.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

He has authored a number of books and audio tapes on NLP, which is largely considered a [[pseudoscience]]&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;

Faulkner is profiled in the book ''[[The New Market Wizards]]'' by [[Jack D. Schwager]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

== Biography ==
{{Neuro-linguistic programming|expanded=developers}}

However, in 1981, Faulkner discovered a book about neuro-linguistic programming called ''The Structure of Magic I: A Book About Language and Therapy'' by [[Richard Bandler]] and [[John Grinder]].&lt;ref name="Hartle"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verification needed|date=November 2017}} That moment was a major turning point for Faulkner, as he understood that "if you could get to the root of the crucial relationship between language and beliefs, then you could change everything."{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Upon the realization that Bandler and Grinder were developing innovations in areas where [[Northwestern University]] had not yet "cracked the code," Faulkner began NLP training.&lt;ref name="Hartle" /&gt; By 1987, he was a certified NLP trainer.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Today, Faulkner describes Grinder and Bandler as having been at least 10 years ahead of their time.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Eventually, Faulkner found his niche within NLP when he began developing decision-making strategy models based on the thought-patterns and behaviors of highly successful people. He mapped strategies for physicians, international negotiators and accelerated learners.&lt;ref name="mind"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began to take a particular interest in studying the behavior of top traders in 1987 when a bond trader asked him if NLP could be used in the stock market. In 1990 after years of observing the decision-making strategies of successful traders such as [[Richard Dennis]], [[Pete Steidlmayer]], [[Jim Rogers]], [[Paul Tudor Jones]] and [[Tom Baldwin (trader)|Tom Baldwin]], Faulkner decided to become a trader, himself.&lt;ref name="mind" /&gt; His first trade in 1992 was a failure; however, he did succeed in closing the year at a profit. Within three years, Faulkner's trading skills had improved enough that, author, Jack D. Schwager included his profile in ''The New Market Wizards: Conversations with America's Top Traders.''&lt;ref name="Wizards"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, Faulkner decided to live in [[England]], where he felt the economy would be more stable. He, along with other NLP trainers, has modeled successful strategies for overcoming challenges in a wide range of industries including rehabilitation, finance, medicine, sports, and bereavement, as well as others.&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;{{cite news

== Career ==
Faulkner studied NLP with its co-founders.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} By blending his expertise in [[Ericksonian hypnosis]] (the foundation for NLP) with a wide array of cognitive-linguistic disciplines, as well as the Rogerian approach and Gestalt therapy, Charles Faulkner developed a unique system of [[NLP Modeling|modeling]] which he subsequently contributed to the field of NLP.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} In particular, Faulkner applies his modeling expertise to develop success strategies, taught internationally.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Charles Faulkner has given instruction at most of the major NLP training institutes, in both the Practitioner and Master Practitioner programs. In the mid-to-late 80's, Faulkner was involved in learning and mapping NLP's early models such as ''Sub-modalities, Belief change, Sleight-of-mouth,'' and ''the Imperative Self''.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} In 1986 and 1987, he was editor of ''The NLP Connection,'' the journal for the National Association of NLP. During the two years that followed, he served as Executive Director of NLP Comprehensive.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

As of 2008, he has authored and co-authored 10 books (see [[Charles Faulkner (author)#Published works|Published works]]), one of which is ''NLP: The New Technology of Achievement'', the number one selling NLP book on Amazon.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Neurolinguistic Programming ===

==== Early NLP Models ====
Faulkner's numerous contributions to the field of NLP began in 1984 with his modeling of ''Accelerated Learning'', to pioneer more efficient and effective learning strategies. He taught this model together with NLP, to a group of teachers in Japan that same year. The result of this work was the founding of ''Learning How to Learn''.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Upon returning to the U.S. in 1985, he modeled the ''Metaphors of Identity''.&lt;ref name="Outcomes"&gt;{{cite web
  | last       = Faulkner
  | first      = Charles
  | authorlink = Charles Faulkner (author)
  | title      = ReSource
  | date       = April 2005
  | url        = http://www.ppdlearning.co.uk/resources
  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model states that an individual's strategies and behavior patterns are informed by deeply structured metaphors for life, self, desired outcomes and challenges. By adopting new metaphors, an individual can create new pathways to transformation.

The academic research of cognitive linguists [[George Lakoff]] and [[Mark Johnson (professor)|Mark Johnson]] and Faulkner's experience with ''Metaphors'' support his hypothesis that cognitive processes are mostly metaphoric, and unconscious. Hence, conscious desires with functional qualities have parallel metaphors that sustain them. Twenty years later, Faulkner would write about this phenomenon in a two-part article entitled "Outcomes, Decisions &amp; 'Levels' of Meaning."&lt;ref name="Outcomes" /&gt; In the years that followed, Faulkner continued to develop additional models, such as ''Physician Decision Strategies'' in 1986, ''Futures Trading'' in 1987, and finally ''System Structure'' (a simultaneous strategies model) in 1990.

==== Modeler ====
In the 1990s, Faulkner honed his expertise as a modeler. He completed Perpetual Cybernetics, which differentiated the seven "worlds of subjective experience" that NLP uses as a basis for its presuppositions and techniques. In 1993, together with golf pro Mark Staples, he co-founded E.P.I.C Golf by modeling the internal and external behavior patterns of outstanding golfers. Later that same year, Faulkner co-authored and starred in the video ''NLP in Action''{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} and in 1994 he co-authored a book with Robert McDonald, entitled ''Success Mastery with NLP'', based on his work modeling 'flow states' and the behavior of exceptional achievers. He continued to develop ''Perpetual Cybernetics'' in conjunction with his ''Living Myths &amp; Metaphors'' work to arrive at one, single, unified model: ''the Metaphors of Perception''. This work subsequently spawned several more models, including: ''Worlds Within a Word, Rhythms of Time'' (1995), and ''Meta-Patterns'' (1996).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In 2003, Faulkner co-authored with Steve Andreas to write NLP: The New Technology of Achievement. In the book, they write, “Lengthy struggle without success is a sign that what we’re doing isn’t working. It’s time to do something else, anything else. It’s time to realize that pain, struggle, suffering and waiting are signs that it’s time for another approach…." The following year, he attended the ''NLP Conference and Festival'' at the [[University of Bristol]], England. There Faulkner presented "Awakening to the Social – An Introduction to Irresistible Influence."&lt;ref name="2004Conference"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he presented "Expository Cartography," an introduction to advanced mind mapping techniques that could be used to disengage habitual biases and systematically enrich any model including the more complex ones such as the four-quadrant model of [[Ken Wilber]].&lt;ref name="2005Conference"&gt;{{cite web

=== Applications in Stock Trading ===
Faulkner became a futures trader in the early 90's as a way to apply his NLP-based models for peak performance. He encouraged fellow traders who were breaking into the industry to use positive statements when journaling. Otherwise, a trader may wind up unconsciously setting in negative trading patterns. He said in a [[Futures (magazine)]] article, "When you recall something, you reinforce it."&lt;ref name="Journal"&gt;{{cite web

==== "The Intuitive Trader" ====
In Chapter Five of ''The Intuitive Trader,'' by Robert Koppel, Charles Faulkner shares his insights on how to develop the intuition needed to be a successful trader. He defines intuition as “getting a solution and not knowing how you got there” and “an insight into something that's a result from your experience with it.” In other words, developed through expertise, intuition can be rephrased as an “educated inference."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn      = 0-471-13047-8
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Faulkner identifies four barriers to identifying and trusting a true intuitive impulse: lack of awareness in the subtleties of emotions, including those caused by uncertainty; self-imposed limitations of trying to predict market moves; acting on mistaken intuitions, or “cognitive illusions;” and finally, being driven by fear or greed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn      = 0-471-13047-8
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the other hand, a successful intuitive trader has built his confidence as a result of a developed awareness of “subtle inner signals.” Bandler and Grinder—the founders of NLP—discovered early on that these inner signals consist of thoughts that are primarily sensory in nature. In fact, all thoughts, conscious and subconscious, arise as unique combinations of an individual's five senses. Conscious thinking will utilize a person's more developed senses; meanwhile, intuitive thought uses a person's least developed senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last      = Koppel
  | first     = Robert

  | isbn      = 0-471-13047-8
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faulkner recommends that a new trader keep a dated journal of thoughts, feelings, ideas and insights related to the market. In time, the trader will notice certain patterns of how, when and where he receives intuitions. Moreover, a trader can see what happens when he follows an intuition, and—interestingly enough—what happens when he purposely makes a decision that goes counter to his intuition. Over time, having a passion for trading and diligently recording experiences will help a trader develop the awareness needed to trust those intuitive “leaps.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, succeeding at trading is not without its requisite legwork which, according to Faulkner, lies in five key areas: market indicators, trading strategies and money management, emotional management, successful and supportive belief systems, and a winning “metaphoric mindset.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Koppel quotes The Outer Game of Trading, in which Faulkner briefly explores the dynamics of confidence and fear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==== Stocks, Futures and Options Magazine ====
In April 2005, Charles Faulkner contributed to SFO magazine an article entitled, ''Inside the Counterintuitive World of Trend Followers: It's Not What You Think. It's What You Know.'' In this article, Faulkner examines a “trend-following philosophy” which he constructed after having observed the language patterns and behaviors of several top traders.

The counterintuitive strategy of trend followers is highlighted by seven general principles:

1. No one can predict the future&lt;br /&gt;
2. If you can look at "what actually is," you have a big advantage over most human beings&lt;br /&gt;
3. What matters can be measured, so keep refining your measurements&lt;br /&gt;
4. You don’t need to know when something will happen to know that it will&lt;br /&gt;
5. Prices can only move up, down or sideways&lt;br /&gt;
6. Losses are a part of life&lt;br /&gt;
7. There is only now

Faulkner illustrates each principle by referring to the strategic mindsets of top traders such as [[John W. Henry]], Bill Dunn, [[Ed Seykota]], [[Jerry Parker]], [[Richard Dennis]], and [[Gerald Loeb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==== Mastering High Risk Decision Making ====
In Charles Faulkner's DVD, ''Mastering High Risk Decision Making'', he presents how NLP techniques can be applied to decision making strategies within the world of trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He examines the key traits to success shared by top traders. Specifically, successful traders know how to: separate understanding from action, attach to actions in lieu of emotions, prioritize risk management, and excel at being disciplined. Also, Faulkner shares NLP techniques that cultivate discipline, perfect goal-formulating and create a “decisive mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“If you want academic credibility, if you want respect from the established entities, whether they are psychological or medical or whatever, well, you have to play their game. If game sounds too flippant, then you have to meet their values. Have to meet their standards of evidence.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Closed-circuit television''' ('''CCTV'''), also known as '''video surveillance''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Kumar|editor1-first=Vikas|editor2-last=Svensson|editor2-first=Jakob|title=Promoting Social Change and Democracy Through Information Technology|date=2015|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=9781466685031|page=75|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jkdLCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dempsey|first1=John S.|title=Introduction to private security|date=2008|publisher=Thomson Wadsworth|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=9780534558734|page=78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qQo7oDMSVXgC&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the use of [[video camera]]s to transmit a signal to a specific place, on a limited set of monitors. It differs from [[broadcast television]] in that the signal is not openly transmitted, though it may employ point to point (P2P), point to multipoint (P2MP), or [[Mesh networking|mesh]] wired or wireless links.  Though almost all video cameras fit this definition, the term is most often applied to those used for [[surveillance]] in areas that may need monitoring such as banks, stores, and other areas where security is needed. Though [[Videotelephony]] is seldom called 'CCTV' one exception is the use of video in [[distance education]], where it is an important tool.&lt;ref&gt;Verman, Romesh.

Surveillance of the public using CCTV is common in many areas around the world. In recent years, the use of [[body worn video]] cameras has been introduced as a new form of surveillance, often used in law enforcement, with cameras located on a police officer's chest or head.&lt;ref name=Hung&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hung, Esq.; Babin, MD; PhD.; Coberly, PhD.|first1=Vivian; Steven; Jacqueline|title=A Market Survey on Body Worn Camera Technologies|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/250381.pdf|website=The Department of Justice's National Institute of Justice|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Video surveillance has generated significant debate about balancing its use with individuals' [[right to privacy]] even when in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What's wrong with public video surveillance?|url=https://www.aclu.org/other/whats-wrong-public-video-surveillance|publisher=ACLU|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Surveillance Cameras and the Right to Privacy|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/surveillance-cameras-and-the-right-to-privacy/|accessdate=5 January 2017|work=CBS News|date=August 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In industrial plants, CCTV equipment may be used to observe parts of a process from a [[central control room]], for example when the environment is not suitable for humans. CCTV systems may operate continuously or only as required to monitor a particular event. A more advanced form of CCTV, utilizing [[digital video recorder]]s (DVRs), provides recording for possibly many years, with a variety of quality and performance options and extra features (such as [[motion detection]] and email alerts). More recently, decentralized [[IP camera]]s, perhaps equipped with megapixel sensors, support recording directly to [[network-attached storage]] devices, or internal flash for completely stand-alone operation.

There are about 350 million surveillance cameras worldwide as of 2016. About 65% of these cameras are installed in Asia. The growth of CCTV has been slowing in recent years.&lt;ref name="SDM2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdmmag.com/articles/92407-rise-of-surveillance-camera-installed-base-slows|title=Rise of Surveillance Camera Installed Base Slows|date=5 May 2016|accessdate=5 January 2017|publishersdm magazine=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first CCTV system was installed by [[Siemens|Siemens AG]] at [[Test Stand VII]] in [[Peenemünde]], Nazi Germany in 1942, for observing the launch of [[V-2 rocket]]s.&lt;ref name="dornberger"&gt;[[Walter Dornberger|Dornberger, Walter]]: ''V-2'', [[Ballantine Books]] 1954, ASIN: B000P6L1ES, page 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The noted German engineer [[Walter Bruch]] was responsible for the technological design and installation of the system.{{refn|CCTV recording systems are still often used at modern launch sites to record the flight of the rockets, in order to find the possible causes of malfunctions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/pdf/114016main_ET_SRB_Cam_FS.pdf |title=ET_SRB Cam FS.indd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eclipticenterprises.com/products_rocketcam_avs.php |title=Ecliptic Enterprises Corporation |publisher=Eclipticenterprises.com |accessdate=2009-05-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080705073920/http://www.eclipticenterprises.com/products_rocketcam_avs.php |archivedate = July 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; while larger rockets often send pictures of [[Multistage rocket|stage separation]] back to earth by radio link.}}{{failed verification|reason=Note and references do not support claim that Walter Bruch was the engineer responsible.|date=April 2017}}

In the U.S. the first commercial closed-circuit television system became available in 1949, called Vericon. Very little is known about Vericon except it was advertised as not requiring a government permit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pCQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=popular+science+1949+%22Some+time+ago%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gZjhTI-wHZGUnweD79T6Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true '' "Television Rides Wires" '', February 1949, Popular Science] small article, bottom of page 179&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technology ===
The earliest video surveillance systems involved constant monitoring because there was no way to record and store information. The development of reel-to-reel media enabled the recording of surveillance footage. These systems required magnetic tapes to be changed manually, which was a time consuming, expensive and unreliable process, with the operator having to manually thread the tape from the tape reel through the recorder onto an empty take-up reel. Due to these shortcomings, video surveillance was not widespread. [[VCR]] technology became available in the 1970s, making it easier to record and erase information, and use of video surveillance became more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DaQY8CrmqFcC&amp;pg=PA276 |title=CCTV Surveillance|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s, digital [[multiplexing]] was developed, allowing several cameras to record at once, as well as [[Time lapse photography|time lapse]] and motion-only recording. This increased savings of time and money which then led to an increase in the use of CCTV.&lt;ref name="wecusurveillance.com"/&gt;

Recently CCTV technology has been enhanced with a shift toward Internet-based products and systems, and other technological developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fennoturvapalvelut.com/ | title=Internet based CCTV on cloud services|language=Finnish|date=March 27, 2015|publisher=fennoturvapalvelut}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Application ===
Closed-circuit television was used as a form of [[pay-per-view]] [[theatre television]] for sports such as [[professional boxing]] and [[professional wrestling]]. Boxing telecasts were broadcast live to a select number of venues, mostly theaters, where viewers paid for tickets to watch the fight live.&lt;ref name="Ezra"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ezra|first=Michael|title=The Economic Civil Rights Movement: African Americans and the Struggle for Economic Power|date=2013|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=9781136274756|page=105|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DL41bsCigZcC&amp;pg=PA105|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bloodyelbow"&gt;{{cite news|title=History of Prizefighting's Biggest Money Fights|url=https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2017/8/24/16170894/history-of-prizefightings-biggest-money-fights-boxing-mma-ufc|work=[[Bloody Elbow]]|agency=[[SB Nation]]|date=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first fight with a closed-circuit telecast was [[Joe Louis]] vs. [[Jersey Joe Walcott|Joe Walcott]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Television|date=1965|publisher=Frederick A.

In September 1968, [[Olean, New York]] was the first city in the United States to install video cameras along its main business street in an effort to fight crime.&lt;ref name="Robb, Gary C. 1979 pg. 571-602"&gt;[Robb, Gary C. (1979) "Police Use of CCTV Surveillance: Constitutional Implications and Proposed Regulations" University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform. pg. 572]&lt;/ref&gt; Another early appearance was in 1973 in [[Times Square]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="Yesil, Bilge 2006 pg. 400-416"&gt;[Yesil, Bilge. (2006) "Watching Ourselves" Cultural Studies. Vol 20(4-5) pg. 400-416]&lt;/ref&gt; The NYPD installed it in order to deter crime that was occurring in the area; however, crime rates did not appear to drop much due to the cameras.&lt;ref name="Yesil, Bilge 2006 pg. 400-416"/&gt; Nevertheless, during the 1980s video surveillance began to spread across the country specifically targeting public areas.&lt;ref name="wecusurveillance.com"&gt;Roberts, Lucy. "[http://www.wecusurveillance.com/cctvhistory History of Video Surveillance and CCTV]" We C U Surveillance Retrieved 2011-10-20&lt;/ref&gt; It was seen as a cheaper way to deter crime compared to increasing the size of the police departments.&lt;ref name="Yesil, Bilge 2006 pg. 400-416"/&gt; Some businesses as well, especially those that were prone to theft, began to use video surveillance.&lt;ref name="Yesil, Bilge 2006 pg. 400-416"/&gt; From the mid-1990s on, police departments across the country installed an increasing number of cameras in various public spaces including housing projects, schools and public parks departments.&lt;ref name="Yesil, Bilge 2006 pg. 400-416"/&gt; CCTV later became common in banks and stores to discourage theft, by recording evidence of criminal activity. In 1998, 3,000 CCTV systems were in use in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=You're being watched, New York!|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1865828.stm|publisher=BBC|date=11 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Nieto in 2008 found many businesses in the United States had invested heavily in video surveillance technology to protect products and promote safe workplace and consumer environments. A nationwide survey of a wide variety of companies found that 75 percent utilize CCTV surveillance. In private sector CCTV surveillance technology is operated in a wide variety of establishments such as in industry/manufacturing, retailing, financial/insurance/banking, transportation and distribution, utilities/communications, health care, and hotels/motels, parking areas, jewelry shops.

Experiments in the UK during the 1970s and 1980s, including outdoor CCTV in [[Bournemouth]] in 1985, led to several larger trial programs later that decade. The first use by local government was in [[King's Lynn]], Norfolk, in 1987.&lt;ref name=wndc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.west-norfolk.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=21697|title=CCTV|last=Staff|date=August 2007|publisher=Borough Council of King's Lynn &amp; West Norfolk|accessdate=2008-12-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523184010/http://www.west-norfolk.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=21697|archivedate=2009-05-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were deemed successful in the government report "CCTV: Looking Out For You", issued by the [[Home Office]] in 1994, and paved the way for an increase in the number of CCTV systems installed. Today, systems cover most town and city centres, and many stations, car-parks and estates.

== Uses ==

=== Crime prevention ===
[[File:Bulger cctv.jpg|thumb|The two-year-old [[Murder of James Bulger|James Bulger]] being led away by his killers, recorded on shopping centre CCTV in 1993. This [[narrow-bandwidth television]] system had a low [[frame rate]].]]
[[File:IFacility-cctv-warning-sign.jpg|alt=iFacility Warning Sign|thumb|Sign warning that premises are watched by CCTV cameras.]]
A 2009 systematic review by researchers from [[Northeastern University]] and [[University of Cambridge]] used [[meta-analysis|meta-analytic]] techniques to pool the average effect of CCTV on crime across 41 different studies.&lt;ref name="Public"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/economics/housing/surveillance-cameras-and-crime/ |title = Public Area CCTV and Crime Prevention: An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis |publisher = Journalist's Resource.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results indicated that
# CCTV caused a significant reduction of crime by on average 16%.
# The largest effects of CCTV were found in car parks, where cameras reduced crime by on average 51%.
# CCTV schemes in other public settings had small and [[Statistical significance|non-statistically significant]] effects on crime: 7% reduction in city and town centers and 23% reduction in public transport settings.
# When sorted by country, systems in the United Kingdom accounted for the majority of the decrease; the drop in other areas was insignificant.

The studies included in the meta-analysis used [[quasi-experiment|quasi-experimental evaluation designs]] that involve before-and-after measures of crime in experimental and control areas.&lt;ref name="Public"/&gt; However, several researchers have pointed to methodological problems associated with this research literature. First, researchers have argued that the British car park studies included in the meta-analysis cannot accurately control for the fact that CCTV was introduced simultaneously with a range of other security-related measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The economics of subjective security and camera surveillance|url =https://wwz.unibas.ch/fileadmin/wwz/redaktion/wipo/Alois_Stutzer/Zehnder_B-099.pdf = |date = 2009|issn = |pages = |volume =|issue =|doi =|first = |last = Zehnder}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, some have noted that, in many of the studies, there may be issues with [[selection bias]] since the introduction of CCTV was potentially [[Endogeneity (econometrics)|endogenous]] to previous crime trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Effects of Surveillance Cameras on Crime: Evidence from the Stockholm Subway|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecoj.12327/abstract|journal = The Economic Journal|date = 2015-11-01|issn = 1468-0297|pages = F289-F305|volume = 125|issue = 588|doi = 10.1111/ecoj.12327|first = Mikael|last = Priks}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the estimated effects may be biased if CCTV is introduced in response to crime trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Is camera surveillance an effective measure of counterterrorism?|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecoj.12327/abstract|journal = Defence and Peace Economics|date = 2013|issn = |pages = 1–14|volume = |issue = |doi = 10.1080/10242694.2011.650481|first = |last = Stutzer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that problems of selection bias and endogeneity can be addressed by stronger research designs such as [[randomized controlled trials]] and [[natural experiments]]. A 2017 review published in [[Journal of Scandinavian Studies in Criminology and Crime Prevention]] compiles seven studies that use such research designs. The studies included in the review found that CCTV reduced crime by 24-28% in public streets and urban subway stations. It also found that CCTV could decrease unruly behaviour in football stadiums and theft in supermarkets/mass merchant stores. However, there was no evidence of CCTV having desirable effects in parking facilities or suburban subway stations. Furthermore, the review indicates that CCTV is more effective in preventing property crimes than in violent crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Surveillance cameras and crime: a review of randomized and natural experiments|url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14043858.2017.1387410|journal = Journal of Scandinavian Studies in Criminology and Crime Prevention|date = 2017|issn = |pages = |volume = |issue = |doi = 10.1080/14043858.2017.1387410|first = Gustav|last = Alexandrie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another question in the effectiveness of CCTV for policing is around uptime of the system; in 2013 City of Philadelphia Auditor found that the $15M system was operational only 32% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viakoo.com/orphaned-video-system-in-philadelphia/|title=Orphaned Video System in Philadelphia?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is still much research to be done to determine the effectiveness of CCTV cameras on crime prevention before any conclusions can be drawn.

There is strong anecdotal evidence that CCTV aids in detection and conviction of offenders; indeed UK police forces routinely seek CCTV recordings after crimes.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10512087/10484338Police-are-failing-to-recover-crucial-CCTV-footage-new-figures-suggest.html?fbHow&amp;goback=%2Egde_1889337_member_5817222616544473092 Police are failing to recover crucial CCTV footage, new figures suggest.]," ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, CCTV has played a crucial role in tracing the movements of suspects or victims and is widely regarded by antiterrorist officers as a fundamental tool in tracking terrorist suspects. Large-scale CCTV installations have played a key part of the defences against terrorism since the 1970s. Cameras have also been installed on [[public transport]] in the hope of deterring crime,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hereford/worcs/3101016.stm CCTV to drive down cab attacks]," ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/4295859.stm Taxi CCTV cameras are installed]," ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and in mobile police surveillance vehicles, often with [[automatic number plate recognition]], and a network of APNI-linked cameras is used to manage [[London congestion charge|London's congestion charging zone]].

A more open question is whether most CCTV is cost-effective. While low-quality domestic kits are cheap the professional installation and maintenance of high definition CCTV is expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allthings.com.au/Catalogue/cctv%20security%20surveillance%20ip%20network%20dome%20camera%20articles/Tip%20Sheet%205.pdf|title=National community Crime Prevention Programme|date=|format=PDF|accessdate=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gill and Spriggs did a [[Cost-effectiveness analysis]] (CEA) of CCTV in crime prevention that showed little monetary saving with the installation of CCTV as most of the crimes prevented resulted in little monetary loss.&lt;ref name ="Assessing" /&gt; Critics however noted that benefits of non-monetary value cannot be captured in a traditional Cost Effectiveness Analysis and were omitted from their study.&lt;ref name ="Assessing" /&gt;  A 2008 Report by UK Police Chiefs concluded that only 3% of crimes were solved by CCTV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forward-edge.net/the-big-question-are-cctv-cameras-a-waste-of-money-in-the-fight-against-crime-822079.html "Are CCTV cameras a waste of money in the fight against crime?"] Forward Edge, 7 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In London, a [[Metropolitan Police]] report showed that in 2008 only one crime was solved per 1000 cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CCTV in the spotlight: one crime solved for every 1,000 cameras |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/cctv-in-the-spotlight-one-crime-solved-for-every-1000-cameras-1776774.html|last=Hughe|first=Mark|date=25 August 2009|publisher=Independent News and Media Limited|accessdate=2009-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases CCTV cameras have become a target of attacks themselves.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/3676550.stm http://news.bbc.co.uk/]," ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, an "Internet Eyes" website was announced which would pay members of the public to view CCTV camera images from their homes and report any crimes they witnessed. The site aimed to add "more eyes" to cameras which might be insufficiently monitored. Civil liberties campaigners criticized the idea as "a distasteful and a worrying development".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8293784.stm Public to Monitor CCTV From Home], ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Body worn ===
{{Main|Body worn video}}
In recent years, the use of body worn video cameras has been introduced for a number of uses. For example, as a new form of surveillance in law enforcement, with cameras located on a police officer's chest or head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bayley|first1=David H.|last2=Stenning|first2=Philip C.|title=Governing the Police: Experience in Six Democracies|date=2016|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=1412862310|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=klW5CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT100&amp;lpg=PT100&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-AEQD7FVjq&amp;sig=KgWeJnq3DtqZRxWbR7IaRCZ27vk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQ6efEmtDWAhXFXRoKHQs3AhsQ6AEIOjAE#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hung/&gt;

=== Industrial processes ===

Industrial processes that take place under conditions dangerous for humans are today often supervised by CCTV. These are mainly processes in the [[chemical industry]], the interior of reactors or facilities for manufacture of [[nuclear fuel]]. Special cameras for some of these purposes include [[Digital camera#Line-scan camera systems|line-scan cameras]] and [[thermographic camera]]s which allow operators to measure the temperature of the processes. The usage of CCTV in such processes is sometimes required by law. {{Specify|date=June 2010}}

=== Traffic monitoring ===
{{Main article|Traffic camera}}

Many cities and [[motorway]] networks have extensive traffic-monitoring systems, using closed-circuit television to detect congestion and notice accidents.&lt;ref&gt;Motorway Cameras in England, http://www.motorwaycameras.co.uk {{Unreliable source?|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these cameras however, are owned by private companies and transmit data to drivers' [[GPS]] systems.

The UK [[Highways Agency]] has a publicly owned CCTV network of over 3000 Pan-Tilt-Zoom cameras covering the British motorway and trunk road network. These cameras are primarily used to monitor traffic conditions and are not used as [[speed cameras]]. With the addition of fixed cameras for the [[active traffic management]] system, the number of cameras on the Highways Agency's CCTV network is likely to increase significantly over the next few years.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The [[London congestion charge]] is enforced by cameras positioned at the boundaries of and inside the congestion charge zone, which automatically read the licence plates of cars. If the driver does not pay the charge then a fine will be imposed. Similar systems are being developed as a means of locating cars reported stolen.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Other surveillance cameras serve as [[traffic enforcement camera]]s.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

=== Transport safety ===
[[File:digital video recorder.jpg|thumb|right|Digital Video Recorder for Public Transport]]

A CCTV system may be installed where any example, on a [[One-man operation|Driver-only operated]] train CCTV cameras may allow the driver to confirm that people are clear of doors before closing them and starting the train.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=FCC Train Dispatch training video|date=2013-03-25|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k9n6WVihu0|volume=|pages=|access-date=2018-07-26}} (Explains about DOO train dispatch it states about the use of CCTV monitors at certain stations at 7:35 in the video.)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sporting events ===

Many sporting events in the United States use CCTV inside the venue for fans to see the action while they are away from their seats. The cameras send the feed to a central control center where a producer selects feeds to send to the television monitors that fans can view. CCTV monitors for viewing the event by attendees are often placed in lounges, hallways, and restrooms. This use of CCTV is not used for surveillance purposes.

===Monitor employees===
{{See also|Employee monitoring}}
Organizations use CCTV to monitor the actions of workers. Every action is recorded as an information block with subtitles that explain the performed operation. This helps to track the actions of workers, especially when they are making critical financial transactions, such as correcting or cancelling of a sale, withdrawing money or altering personal information.

Actions which an employer may wish to monitor could include:
* Scanning of goods, selection of goods, introduction of price and quantity;
* Input and output of operators in the system when entering passwords;
* Deleting operations and modifying existing documents;
* Implementation of certain operations, such as financial statements or operations with cash;
* Moving goods, revaluation scrapping and counting;
* Control in the kitchen of fast food restaurants;
* Change of settings, reports and other official functions.

Each of these operations is transmitted with a description, allowing detailed monitoring of all actions of the operator. Some systems allow the user to search for a specific event by time of occurrence and text description, and perform statistical evaluation of operator behaviour. This allows the software to predict deviations from the standard workflow and record only anomalous behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icaew.com/en/archive/library/subject-gateways/business-management/smes/small-business-update/2015-01/using-cctv-to-monitor-the-workplace|title=Using CCTV to monitor the workplace {{!}} Small Business Update {{!}} Library {{!}} ICAEW|website=www.icaew.com|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in schools===

There are some restrictions on installation, with cameras not being installed in an area where there is a "reasonable [[expectation of privacy]]", such as bathrooms, gym locker areas and private offices (unless consent by the office occupant is given). Сameras are generally acceptable in hallways, parking lots, front offices where students, employees, and parents come and go, gymnasiums, cafeterias, supply rooms and classrooms. The installation of cameras in classrooms may be objected to by some teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.ncjrs.gov/school/ch2a_18.html/|title = Legal aspects of the use of video cameras in schools = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criminal use ===

Criminals may use surveillance cameras to monitor the public. For example, a hidden camera at an [[Automated Teller Machine|ATM]] can capture people's [[Personal Identification Number|PINs]] as they are entered, without their knowledge. The devices are small enough not to be noticed, and are placed where they can monitor the keypad of the machine as people enter their PINs. Images may be transmitted wirelessly to the criminal. Even lawful surveillance cameras sometimes have their data go into the hands of people who have no legal right to receive it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.letelegramme.fr/france/benalla-trois-policiers-suspendus-pour-avoir-transmis-des-images-de-videosurveillance-20-07-2018-12032279.php|title=Benalla.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, the vast majority of CCTV cameras are not operated by government bodies, but by private individuals or companies, especially to monitor the interiors of shops and businesses. According to 2011 [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] requests, the total number of local government operated CCTV cameras was around 52,000 over the entirety of the UK.&lt;ref name=refBBW1&gt;{{cite web|title=The Price of Privacy: How local authorities spent £515m on CCTV in four years|url=http://www.bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/files/priceofprivacy/Price_of_privacy_2012.pdf|publisher=Big Brother Watch|accessdate=4 February 2015|date=February 2012|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although specific legalities of running a home CCTV system in the UK are rather vague there are published &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ifacility.co.uk/rules-and-regulations-of-home-cctv-installations/|title=Rules and Regulations of Home CCTV installation - iFacility 01749 600600|date=15 March 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; rules and regulations that although are mostly common sense, do include some laws that most people may not be aware of, including registering with ICO as a data controller if any CCTV camera catch images of any of the public on, or outside of your property.

An article published in ''CCTV Image'' magazine estimated the number of private and local government operated cameras in the United Kingdom was 1.85 million in 2011. The estimate was based on extrapolating from a comprehensive survey of public and private cameras within the Cheshire Constabulary jurisdiction. This works out as an average of one camera for every 32 people in the UK, although the density of cameras varies greatly from place to place. The Cheshire report also claims that the average person on a typical day would be seen by 70 CCTV cameras.&lt;ref name=Guardian2011&gt;{{cite news|title=You're being watched: there's one CCTV camera for every 32 people in UK - Research shows 1.85m machines across Britain, most of them indoors and privately operated|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/02/cctv-cameras-watching-surveillance|accessdate=7 January 2017|work=The Guardian|date=2 March 2011|postscript=none}};&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cheshire figure is regarded as more dependable than a previous study by Michael McCahill and Clive Norris of ''UrbanEye'' published in 2002.&lt;ref name=Guardian2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbaneye.net/results/ue_wp6.pdf|title=CCTV in London|accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on a small sample in [[Putney]] High Street, McCahill and Norris extrapolated the number of surveillance cameras in [[London|Greater London]] to be around 500,000 and the total number of cameras in the UK to be around 4,200,000. According to their estimate the UK has one camera for every 14 people. Although it has been acknowledged for several years that the methodology behind this figure is flawed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/society/factcheck+how+many+cctv+cameras/2291167|title=FactCheck: how many CCTV cameras?|publisher=Channel 4 News|date=18 June 2008|accessdate=8 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been widely quoted. Furthermore, the figure of 500,000 for Greater London is often confused with the figure for the police and local government operated cameras in the [[City of London]], which was about 650 in 2011.&lt;ref name=refBBW1 /&gt;

The ''CCTV User Group'' estimated that there were around 1.5 million private and local government CCTV cameras in city centres, stations, airports, and major retail areas in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cctvusergroup.com/art.php?art=94|title=How many cameras are there?|publisher=CCTV User Group |date=18 June 2008|accessdate=8 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This figure does not include the smaller surveillance systems such as those that may be found in local corner shops and is therefore broadly in line with the Cheshire report.

Research conducted by the Scottish Centre for Crime and Justice Research and based on a survey of all Scottish local authorities, identified that there are over 2,200 public space CCTV cameras in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Bannister, J., Mackenzie, S. and Norris, P.

Opponents of CCTV point out the loss of [[privacy]] of people under surveillance, and the negative impact of surveillance on [[civil liberty|civil liberties]]. Furthermore, they argue that CCTV displaces crime, rather than reducing it. Critics often dub CCTV as "[[Big Brother (1984)|Big Brother]] surveillance", a reference to [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', which featured a two-way [[telescreen]] in every home through which [[Ingsoc|The Party]] would monitor the populace.

Proponents of CCTV cameras argue that cameras are effective at deterring and solving crime, and that appropriate regulation and legal restrictions on surveillance of ''public'' spaces can provide sufficient protections so that an individual's [[right to privacy]] can reasonably be weighed against the benefits of surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kroener|first1=Inga|title=CCTV: A Technology Under the Radar?|date=2014|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=9781472400963|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=81OmAwAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Video Surveillance of Public Places: Response Guide No. 4 (2006) |url=http://www.popcenter.org/Responses/video_surveillance/|publisher=Center for Problem-Oriented Policing|accessdate=25 January 2016|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SMILE"&gt;''Smile, the cameras are here to watch over you'' - ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', Tuesday 18 March 2008, Page A14&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[anti-surveillance activists]] have held that there is a right to privacy in public areas. Furthermore, while it is true that there may be scenarios wherein a person's right to public privacy can be both reasonably and justifiably compromised, some scholars have argued that such situations are so rare as to not sufficiently warrant the frequent compromising of public privacy rights that occurs in regions with widespread CCTV surveillance. For example, in her book ''Setting the Watch: Privacy and the Ethics of CCTV Surveillance'', Beatrice von Silva-Tarouca Larsen argues that CCTV surveillance is ethically permissible only in "certain restrictively defined situations", such as when a specific location has a "comprehensively documented and significant criminal threat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Von Silva-Tarouca Larsen|first=Beatrice|year=2011|title=Setting the watch: Privacy and the ethics of CCTV surveillance|publisher=Hart Publishing|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Setting-Watch-Privacy-Surveillance-Studies/dp/1849460841/ref=la_B004QIXX10_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1408946168&amp;sr=1-1|isbn=978-1849460842|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her central reasoning is that widespread CCTV surveillance violates citizens' rights to privacy and anonymity within the [[public sphere]] by jeopardizing both their liberty and dignity. She concludes that CCTV surveillance should therefore be reserved for specific circumstances in which there are clear and reasonably demonstrated benefits to its implementation and few ethical compromises.

In the [[United States]], the Constitution does not explicitly include the [[right to privacy]] although the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has said several of the amendments to the Constitution implicitly grant this right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Right to Privacy|url=https://www.aclu.org/your-right-privacy|publisher=American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to video surveillance recordings may require a judge's [[writ]], which is readily available.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] - [http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/7mcrm.htm Video Surveillance]  Retrieved August 6, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is little legislation and regulation specific to video surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What's Wrong With Public Video Surveillance|url=https://www.aclu.org/whats-wrong-public-video-surveillance|publisher=American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kroener|first1=Inga|title=CCTV: A Technology Under the Radar?|date=2014|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=9781472400963|page=110|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=81OmAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kLSqcFlwnV&amp;sig=bacrY8WdW7kOc0wTCi6dp5yPzpk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3o6jM5MHKAhVHWRoKHSYsA3oQ6AEIXTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All countries in the [[European Union]] are signatories to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] which protects individual rights including the right to privacy. The EU's [[Data Protection Directive]] regulates access to personal data including CCTV recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kroener|first1=Inga|title=CCTV: A Technology Under the Radar?|date=2014|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=9781472400963|page=107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=81OmAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA107&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kLSqcFlwnV&amp;sig=bacrY8WdW7kOc0wTCi6dp5yPzpk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3o6jM5MHKAhVHWRoKHSYsA3oQ6AEIXTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This directive is translated into the national law of each country within the European Union.

In the [[United Kingdom]] the [[Data Protection Act 1998]] imposes legal restrictions on the uses of CCTV recordings and mandates the registration of CCTV systems with the Data Protection Agency. In 2004, the successor to the Data Protection Agency, the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] clarified that this required registration of all CCTV systems with the Commissioner, and prompt deletion of archived recordings. However, subsequent case law (Durant vs. FSA) limited the scope of the protection provided by this law, and not all CCTV systems are currently regulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memorandum by A A Adams, BSc, MSc, PhD, LLM, MBCS, CITP School of Systems Engineering|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldselect/ldconst/18/18we03.htm|website=UK Parliament Constitution Committee - Written Evidence. Surveillance: Citizens and the State|date=January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, private sector personnel in the UK who operate or monitor CCTV devices or systems are considered [[security guard]]s and have been made subject to [[Security Industry Authority|state licensing]].

A 2007 report by the UK Information Commissioner's Office, highlighted the need for the public to be made more aware of the growing use of surveillance and the potential impact on civil liberties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Privacy watchdog wants curbs on surveillance|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1550218/Privacy-watchdog-wants-curbs-on-surveillance.html|publisher=The Telegraph|date=1 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CCTV, computers and the 'climate of fear'|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/cctv-computers-and-the-climate-of-fear-7204625.html|publisher=Evening Standard|date=30 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, a campaign group claimed the majority of CCTV cameras in the UK are operated illegally or are in breach of privacy guidelines.&lt;ref name=Telegraph2007&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/05/31/ncamera131.xml|title=Majority of UK's CCTV cameras 'are illegal'|date=31 May 2007|publisher=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Information Commissioner's Office rebutted the claim and added that any reported abuses of the Data Protection Act are swiftly investigated.&lt;ref name=Telegraph2007 /&gt; Even if there are some concerns arising from the use of CCTV such as involving privacy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/dec/11/home-surveillance-cctv-images-may-breach-data-protection-rules-european-court-judgment-says|title=Home surveillance CCTV images may breach data protection laws, ECJ rules|accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; more commercial establishments are still installing CCTV systems in the UK.

In 2012, the UK government enacted the [[Protection of Freedoms Act 2012|Protection of Freedoms Act]] which includes several provisions related to controlling and restricting the collection, storage, retention, and use of information about individuals. Under this Act, the [[Home Office]] published a code of practice in 2013 for the use of surveillance cameras by government and local authorities. The aim of the code is to help ensure their use is "characterised as surveillance by consent, and such consent on the part of the community must be informed consent and not assumed by a system operator. Surveillance by consent should be regarded as analogous to [[policing by consent]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surveillance Camera Code of Practice|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/204775/Surveillance_Camera_Code_of_Practice_WEB.pdf|publisher=UK Government Home Office|accessdate=1 December 2013|page=5|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canada]], the use of video surveillance has grown very rapidly. In [[Ontario]], both the ''municipal'' and ''provincial'' versions of the [[Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (Ontario)|Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act]] outline very specific guidelines that control how ''images'' and ''[[information]]'' can be gathered by this method and or released.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90f31 Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070924143038/http://www.ipc.on.ca/index.asp?navid=73 |date=September 24, 2007 }} Text&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sweden]], the use of CCTV in public spaces is nationally regulated; requiring permits for any operator (incl. [[Swedish Police Authority]]) to install CCTV in public spaces. In an opinion poll commissioned by [[Lund University]] in August 2017, the general public of Sweden were asked to choose one measure that would ensure their need for privacy when subject to CCTV-operation in public spaces. 43% favored regulation in the form of clear routines for managing, storing and distributing image material generated from surveillance cameras, 39% favored regulation in the form of clear signage informing that camera surveillance in public spaces is present, 2% favored regulation in the form of having permits restricting the use of surveillance cameras during certain times of day/week, 10% favored regulation in the form of having restrictive policies for issuing permits for surveillance cameras in public spaces. 6% were unsure or did not know.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lahtinen|first1=Markus|title=The perception of surveillance cameras and privacy among the general public in Sweden|date=2017|publisher=LUSAX-research group, Lund University School of Economics and Management, Sweden|url=http://lusax.se/Lahtinen_2017_OpinionPoll_DataSheet.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Computer-controlled analytics and identification ===

Computer-controlled cameras can identify, track, and categorize objects in their field of view.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

'''[[Video content analysis]]''' (VCA) is the capability of automatically analyzing [[video]] to detect and determine temporal events not based on a single [[image]], but rather object classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1037097519|title=2018 9th International Conference on Information and Communication Systems (ICICS) : 3-5 April, 2018, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan.|others=Jordan University of Science &amp; Technology,, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. Jordan Section,, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,|isbn=9781538643662|location=[Piscataway, New Jersey]|oclc=1037097519}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it can be seen as the automated equivalent of the biological [[visual cortex]].

A system using VCA can recognize changes in the environment and even identify and compare objects in the database using size, speed, and sometimes colour. The camera's actions can be programmed based on what it is "seeing". For example; an alarm can be issued if an object has moved in a certain area, or if a painting is missing from a wall, or if a smoke or fire is detected, or if running people are detected, or if fallen people are detected and if someone has spray painted the lens, as well as video loss, lens cover, defocus and other so called camera tampering events.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

VCA analytics can also be used to detect unusual patterns in an environment. The system can be set to detect anomalies in a crowd, for instance a person moving in the opposite direction in airports where passengers are supposed to walk only in one direction out of a plane or in a subway where people are not supposed to exit through the entrances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mate.co.il/page.asp?newsid=53&amp;type=6&amp;cat=28&amp;lang=1|title=MATE's Analytics Integrate with Hirsch Security Systems|date=|accessdate=2011-03-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216014657/http://www.mate.co.il/page.asp?newsid=53&amp;type=6&amp;cat=28&amp;lang=1|archivedate=2009-02-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VCA can track people on a map by calculating their position from the images. It is then possible to link many cameras and track a person through an entire building or area. This can allow a person to be followed without having to analyze many hours of film. Currently the cameras have difficulty identifying individuals from video alone, but if connected to a key-card system, identities can be established and displayed as a tag over their heads on the video.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

There is also a significant difference in where the VCA technology is placed, either the data is being processed within the cameras (on the edge) or by a centralized server. Both technologies have their pros and cons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ercim.eu/publication/ws-proceedings/DELOS4/oliveira.pdf|title=Image Processing Techniques for Video Content Extraction|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''[[facial recognition system]]''' is a computer application for automatically identifying or verifying a person from a digital image or a video frame from a video source. One of the ways to do this is by comparing selected facial features from the image and a facial [[database management system|database]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The combination of CCTV and facial recognition has been tried as a form of [[mass surveillance]], but has been ineffective because of the low discriminating power of facial recognition technology and the very high number of [[Type I and type II errors|false positives]] generated. This type of system has been proposed to compare faces at airports and seaports with those of suspected terrorists or other undesirable entrants.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Computerized monitoring of CCTV images is under development, so that a human CCTV operator does not have to endlessly look at all the screens, allowing an operator to observe many more CCTV cameras.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} These systems do not observe people directly. Insta Types of body-movement behavior, or particular types of clothing or baggage.

To many, the development of CCTV in public areas, linked to computer databases of people's pictures and identity, presents a serious breach of [[civil liberties]]. Conservative critics fear the possibility that one would no longer have [[anonymity]] in [[public place]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Todd Lewan|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/surveillance/2007-07-21-chips_N.htm |title=Microchips in humans spark privacy debate|publisher=[[USAToday]]|date=July 7, 2007|accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrations or assemblies in public places could be affected as the state would be able to collate lists of those leading them, taking part, or even just talking with protesters in the street.

Comparatively harmless are [[people counter]] systems. They use CCTV equipment as front end eyes of devices which perform shape recognition technology in order to identify objects as human beings and count people passing pre-defined areas.

=== Retention, storage and preservation ===
Most CCTV systems may record and store digital video and images to a [[digital video recorder]] (DVR) or, in the case of IP cameras, directly to a server, either on-site or offsite.{{citation needed|date=December 2017|reason=Citation needed}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ctssystems.eu/will-emerging-technologies-impact-enhance-home-business-security-future/|title=CCTV Systems for a greater future home &amp; business security|last=|first=|date=2017-11-28|work=CTS Systems Latest News|access-date=2017-12-19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a cost in the retention of the images produced by CCTV systems. The amount and quality of data stored on storage media is subject to compression ratios, images stored per second, image size and is effected by the retention period of the videos or images.&lt;ref name="JVSG Video Compression Guide 2010"&gt;{{cite web|title= MotionJPEG, JPEG2000, H.264 and MPEG-4 compression methods in CCTV|accessdate=2011-05-01|url=http://www.jvsg.com/cctv-compression-guide/}}&lt;/ref&gt; DVRs store images in a variety of [[proprietary file format]]s. Recordings may be retained for a preset amount of time and then automatically archived, overwritten or deleted, the period being determined by the organisation that generated them.

{{See also|Closed-circuit television camera}}

Closed-circuit digital photography (CCDP) is more suited for capturing and saving recorded high-resolution photographs, whereas closed-circuit television (CCTV) is more suitable for live-monitoring purposes.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

However, an important feature of some CCTV systems is the ability to take high resolution images of the camera scene, e.g. on a time lapse or motion-detection basis. Images taken with a digital still camera often have higher resolution than those taken with some video cameras. Increasingly, low-cost high-resolution digital still cameras can also be used for CCTV purposes.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Images may be monitored remotely when the computer is connected to a network.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

=== IP cameras ===
{{Main article|IP camera}}
[[File:Intellinet Network Solutions NSC11-WN Home Network IP Camera.jpg|thumb|Easy Connect Wireless [[IP camera]]]]

A growing branch in CCTV is ''internet protocol'' cameras (IP cameras). It is estimated that 2014 was the first year that IP cameras outsold analog cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkwebcams.co.uk/blog/2013/12/19/the-global-value-of-ip-camera-sales-is-close-to-50-of-total-cctv-cameras-sold-worldwide-but-they-are-not-yet-plug-and-play/|title=Global value of IP camera sales now close to 50% of CCTV cameras sold, but...|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; IP cameras use the [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) used by most [[Local Area Network]]s (LANs) to transmit video across data networks in digital form. IP can optionally be transmitted across the public internet, allowing users to view their cameras through any internet connection available through a computer or a phone, this is considered remote access. For professional or public infrastructure security applications, IP video is restricted to within a private network or [[VPN]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.axis.com/files/articles/ar_10myths_secinfowatch_us_0512.pdf|title=Dispelling the Top 10 Myths of IP Surveillance|date=|format=PDF|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or can be recorded onto a remote server.

=== Networking CCTV cameras ===

The city of [[Chicago]] operates a networked video surveillance system which combines CCTV video feeds of government agencies with those of the private sector, installed in city buses, businesses, public schools, subway stations, housing projects etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The City of Chicago's OEMC and IBM Launch Advanced Video Surveillance System|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/22385.wss|website=IBM News Room|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even homeowners are able to contribute footage. It is estimated to incorporate the video feeds of a total of 15,000 cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704538404574539910412824756|title=Chicago's Camera Network Is Everywhere|last=Bulkeley|first=William M.|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system is used by Chicago's [[Office of Emergency Management]] in case of an emergency call: it detects the caller's location and instantly displays the real-time video feed of the nearest security camera to the operator, not requiring any user intervention. While the system is far too vast to allow complete real-time monitoring, it stores the video data for later usage in order to provide possible evidence in criminal cases.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704538404574539910412824756 Chicago's Camera Network Is Everywhere]", ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New York City]] has a similar network called the [[Domain Awareness System]].

[[London]] also has a network of CCTV systems that allows multiple authorities to view and control CCTV cameras in real time. The system allows authorities including the [[Metropolitan Police Service]], [[Transport for London]] and a number of London [[borough]]s to share CCTV images between them. It uses a network protocol called [[TVNP|Television Network Protocol]] to allow access to many more cameras than each individual system owner could afford to run and maintain.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The Glynn County Police Department uses a wireless mesh-networked system of portable battery-powered tripods for live megapixel video surveillance and central monitoring of tactical police situations. The systems can be used either on a stand-alone basis with secure communications to nearby police laptops, or within a larger mesh system with multiple tripods feeding video back to the command vehicle via wireless, and to police headquarters via 3G.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

=== Integrated systems ===
[[File:Integrated LCD DVR.jpg|thumb|An integrated systems unit.]]

Integrated systems allow different security systems, like CCTV, access control, intruder alarms and intercoms to operate together.  For example, when an intruder alarm is activated, CCTV cameras covering the intrusion area are recorded at a higher frame rate and transmitted to an Alarm Receiving Centre.

=== Wireless security cameras ===
{{Main article|Wireless security camera}}
[[File:Lorex digital wireless camera.jpg|thumb|[[Wireless security camera]]]]

Many consumers are turning to wireless security cameras for home surveillance. Wireless cameras do not require a video cable for video/audio transmission, simply a cable for power. Wireless cameras are also easy and inexpensive to install, but lack the reliability of hard-wired cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arcdyn.com/articles/wired-vs-wireless-ip-security-cameras/%7cdate=October|title=2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous generations of wireless security cameras relied on analog technology; modern wireless cameras use digital technology which delivers crisper audio, sharper video, and a secure and interference-free signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Digital Video Essentials: Shoot, Transfer, Edit, Share By Erica Sadun|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x_yb92nsqnUC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=video+digital+vs+analog&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LXJeUvjiOIiz4ATotYCwDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=video%20digital%20vs%20analog&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Talking CCTV ===
{{main article|Talking CCTV}}
In [[Wiltshire]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], 2003, a pilot scheme for what is now known as "Talking CCTV" was put into action; allowing operators of CCTV cameras to order offenders to stop what they were doing, ranging from ordering subjects to pick up their rubbish and put it in a bin to ordering groups of vandals to disperse. In 2005 Ray Mallon, the mayor and former senior police officer of [[Middlesbrough]] implemented "Talking CCTV" in his area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/tees/5353538.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - England - Tees - Town trials talking CCTV cameras|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other towns have had such cameras installed.  In 2007 several of the devices were installed in [[Bridlington]] town centre, [[East Riding of Yorkshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/humber/6492925.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - England - Humber - 'Talking' CCTV cameras are tested|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Countermeasures ==

Due to the widespread implementation of surveillance cameras, glasses are being built which can defeat CCTV cameras. In December 2016 a form of anti-CCTV and facial recognition sunglasses called 'reflectacles' were invented by a custom-spectacle-craftsmen based in Chicago named Scott Urban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magneticmag.com/2016/12/be-seen-and-unseen-reflectacles-are-the-sunglasses-of-the-future/|title=Be Seen and Unseen! Reflectacles are the Sunglasses of the Future|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They reflect infrared and, optionally, visible light which makes the users face a white blur to cameras. The project easily surpassed its funding goal of $28,000 and reflectacles will be commercially available by June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/reflectacles/reflectacles-reflective-eyewear-and-sunglasses|title=Reflectacles - Reflective Eyewear and Sunglasses|website=Kickstarter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Camera vandalism ==

Unless physically protected, CCTV cameras have been found to be vulnerable against a variety of (mostly illegal) tactics:{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

*Some people will deliberately destroy cameras. Some cameras can come with dust-tight, pressurized, [[Electrical equipment in hazardous areas|explosion proof]], and bullet-resistant housings.
* Spraying substances over the lens can make the image too blurry to view.
* Lasers can blind or damage them. However, since most lasers are monochromatic, color filters can reduce the effect of laser pointers. But filters also impair image quality and overall light sensitivity of cameras (see [[laser safety]] article for details on issues with filters). Also, complete protection from lasers of any wavelength would require use of completely black filters, rendering the camera useless.

== Cost ==
The security camera installation cost in [[Los Angeles]], [[United States]] ranges from [[US$]]300 to US$3,500. On average, however, the cost can be anywhere from US$893 – US$2,267. The price will go up depending on specific requirements or the extent of the security that will be required.&lt;!-- Source required --&gt;

Among other factors, the specific type of camera being used has the most significant impact on its cost. The average cost of two digital cameras packaged with an LCD monitor is around [[US$]]450. Different brands can also have different prices. The type of technology used also has an impact of security camera installation cost. Wireless camera systems are generally more expensive than their wired counterparts.

The specific type of software that is being used also has a role to play on its price. On average, professional level software is offered at US$75, with some of them requiring annual fees for membership. [[Network attached storage]] or [[Digital video recorder|DVR]], used for storing recorded video, will also be part of the cost. On average, that can cost about US$499. This will depend on the storage capacity and other features of the device chosen by the user.

In applied [[linguistics]] and [[educational psychology]], '''competency evaluation''' is a means for teachers to determine the ability of their students in other ways besides the [[standardized test]]. 

Usually this includes [[Career portfolio|portfolio]] assessment. In language testing, it may also include student interviews and checklists (e.g., on a scale from 1 to 5 the student or teacher rates his or her ability to do such tasks as introducing one's family).

While various governments in [[Europe]] and [[Canada]] often employ competency evaluation to evaluate bilingual abilities of public employees, it has only recently begun to receive attention from the [[United States]] where large testing corporations have dominated language evaluation with financially lucrative performance tests such as the [[TOEFL]], [[MCAT]] and [[SAT]] tests.

In [[psychology]], competency can be evaluation to cover civil affairs, such as competency to handle personal finances, and competency to handle personal affairs (such as signing contracts).

'''Culturally Responsive Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (CRPBIS)''' is an ongoing statewide research project founded by Dr. Aydin Bal in 2011. The purpose of CRPBIS is to re-mediate school cultures that reproduce behavioral outcome disparities and marginalization of non-dominant students and families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dpi.wi.gov/|title=Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction|website=Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction|language=en|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; CRPBIS is conducted at the [[Wisconsin Center for Education Research]] at the School of Education, [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]]. CRPBIS develops, utilizes, and researches processes and interventions such as [[Learning Lab]] to create locally meaningful and sustainable systemic transformations together with local stakeholders (educators, families, students, community representatives).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbis.org/|title=PBIS.org Home Page|website=www.pbis.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Learning Lab is an innovative methodology of systemic transformation, informed by [[Cultural-Historical Activity Theory]] (CHAT) (Bal, 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bal |first1=Aydin |title=Culturally Responsive Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports. |journal=WCER Working Paper No. 2015-9 |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;; Engestrom, 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Engeström |first1=Y. |title=From teams to knots: Activity-theoretical studies of collaboration and learning at work |date=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
As a part of CRPBIS, local schools create teams with members of their communities to identify and understand systemic problems (e.g., racial disproportionality in school disciplinary actions) within their own schools, propose new solutions, and examine the effectiveness of their solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rti4success.org/|title=Center on Response to Intervention|website=www.rti4success.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3043">{{nihongo|'''Curriculum guidelines'''|学習指導要領|Gakushū shidō yōryō}} is a standard issued by the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]]　(MEXT) that specifies materials taught at all of [[primary school|elementary]], [[middle school|junior]] and [[secondary school|senior high school]]s in [[Japan]], either [[state school|public]] or [[private school|private]]. The authority of the ministry to issue the standard is due to {{nihongo|the enforcement regulations of the [[School Education Law]]|学校教育法施行規則|Gakkō kyōiku hō shikō kisoku}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.e-gov.go.jp/htmldata/S22/S22F03501000011.html |script-title=ja:学校教育法施行規則 |language=Japanese |accessdate=2008-02-16 |date=2007-12-25 |publisher=Japanese government}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ministry also publishes the {{nihongo|'''commentary to the curriculum guidelines'''|学習指導要領解説|Gakushū shidō yōryō kaisetsu}} that accompanies the guidelines. Nominally, the commentary is not legally binding.

== Legality ==
The legal extent of the standard has been unclear. While the standard is not a [[law]] per se, court cases in the past have shown that it is legally binding to some extent. For example, in 1990, the [[High courts of Japan|High Court]] in Fukuoka ruled that a prefectural high school lawfully fired its teacher who taught a course in a way that violated curriculum guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.courts.go.jp/search/jhsp0030?action_id=dspDetail&amp;hanreiSrchKbn=01&amp;hanreiNo=25867&amp;hanreiKbn=01 |script-title=ja:判例検索システム＞検索結果詳細画面 |language=Japanese |accessdate=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Detention: The Siege at Johnson High''''' (also known as '''''Hostage High''''' and '''''Target for Rage''''') is a 1997 American [[television film|made-for-television]] [[thriller (genre)|thriller]] [[drama (film and television)|drama film]] based on the 1992 [[Lindhurst High School shooting|Lindhurst High School shooting and siege]] that resulted in the death of four people. The film, written by Larry Golin and directed by [[Michael W. Watkins]], stars [[Ricky Schroder|Rick Schroder]], [[Freddie Prinze Jr.]], [[Katie Wright]], Ryan Christopher Mouritsen, [[Alexis Cruz]] and [[Henry Winkler]]. It was originally broadcast on [[CBS]] on 19 May 1997.

==Plot==
Years ago, Jason Copeland, now 24, failed his final exams and did not graduate Johnson High School, for which he still holds his History teacher, Mr. Kroft responsible. He decides to take revenge and enters the school with a 12-gauge shotgun, a revolver, and a massive supply of ammunition. He first starts shooting around, hitting several students. After shooting Mr. Kroft, he decides to take as many hostages as possible in one room. Among them is Aaron Sullivan, a gifted but lazy student who is assigned to answer the phone. Meanwhile, Frankie Rodriguez, the class clown, is ordered to be the message boy, picking up and delivering information and other things from the FBI to Jason. 

Skip Fine is the only hostage negotiator in town, despite being generally regarded as less than the brightest penny on the local police force. Over the telephone he attempts to convince Jason to release his hostages and is almost successful, until Jason suddenly hears a noise from the halls. Frankie is set out to locate the remaining persons in the building and although he finds a filled classroom, he returns with only one pupil. Jason soon realizes there are others still in the building when he hears an FBI agent trying to break into that room. He ends up shooting him and taking the remaining students hostage. 

Meanwhile, Skip decides to quit, feeling he is not prepared enough to be involved with such a responsible job. Jason, however, refuses to talk to the FBI and insists on speaking to Skip only. From this point, Jason softens up, allowing the hostages to order food. Not realizing the seriousness of the situation, most hostages still think Jason is only using the weapons as a threat, and most of them do not realize he has already fatally shot people, including Mr. Kroft. Meanwhile, Aaron wins Jason's trust and is able to deliver local cop Matt Eckert a list with the names of all 62 hostages. Matt is shocked to find out that among them is his daughter Samantha. On his way back, Aaron and Frankie find the body of Travis McGill, one of the few students killed, and they finally realize how dangerous Jason really is.

After being back in the room where the people are taken hostage, Aaron is allowed to let 15 people go. He offers Samantha to be one of them, but she insists on staying. When Jason finds out six students have already been rumored to be killed, he loses his temper and puts a gun to Samantha's head. Skip, however, is able to talk him out of shooting her. Afterwards, he loses his attention for a moment, during which Aaron and Samantha help several people escape. A sniper is ready to shoot Jason, but Skip insists on convincing Jason to give himself up instead. Soon, another 20 students are released and Jason signs a contract in which he agrees to let go the remaining hostages if he is sent to jail for under five years.

Despite an attempted attack on Jason by Frankie, for killing Travis, every student is eventually released. Jason thanks Aaron for his help and gives himself over to the police afterwards. Aaron and Samantha are embraced as the heroes of the tragedy and Jason is sent to [[death row]] for killing four people.

==History==
In 1988, DigiPen was founded by [[Claude Comair]] in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada as a research and development institute for computer science and animation.

In 1990, DigiPen began offering its first dedicated educational program in the subject of 3D computer animation through the [[Vancouver Film School]].

In 1990, DigiPen began offering a 3D animation program and began collaborating with [[Nintendo]] of America to create a post-secondary program for video game programming.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} With Nintendo's support, DigiPen Applied Computer Graphics School accepted its first class of video game programming students in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Who Said School Couldn't Be Fun? |journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=76|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=November 1995|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Game Makers: Programming Schools|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=87|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=December 1995|pages=30–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the [[Washington State Higher Education Coordinating Board]] (HECB) granted DigiPen the authorization to award degree programs in the [[United States]]. DigiPen’s first offered degree program was the Bachelor of Science in Real-Time Interactive Simulation.

In 1998, DigiPen Institute of Technology opened its campus in [[Redmond, Washington]] as a joint campus between DigiPen and [[Nintendo Software Technology]]. Redmond became DigiPen’s home.

In 2002, DigiPen received national accreditation from the [[Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges|ACCSC]]. DigiPen began offering its first Masters program, a Masters of Science in [[Computer Science]]. DigiPen graduated its last classes in its Associate programs, and only offered Undergraduate and Postgraduate programs.

In 2008, DigiPen Institute of Technology opened its campus in [[Singapore]] in conjunction with Singapore’s [[Economic Development Board]].

In 2010, DigiPen relocated its main campus to an independent location, still in Redmond, Washington. DigiPen Institute of Technology Singapore joined the [[public university]] [[Singapore Institute of Technology]].

In 2011, DigiPen Institute of Technology opened its campus in the [[Greater Bilbao]] area, in the municipality of [[Zierbena]].

'''ESN vid Åbo Akademi r.f.''' (also known as '''ESN Åbo Akademi''' or '''ESN ÅA''') is the official ESN section of the [[Erasmus Student Network]] at [[Åbo Akademi University]], the only [[Swedish-speaking Finns|Swedish-speaking]] multidisciplinary university in [[Finland]]. Even if ''ESN'' stands for [[Erasmus Student Network]], referring to the European [[Erasmus programme]], the section doesn't limit its program to only European students but focuses on all international minded students in [[Åbo]] (in Finnish [[Turku]]), [[Finland]].

ESN Åbo Akademi was founded 1994 and is the second oldest ESN Section in Finland. Historically ESN Åbo Akademi has been a very active section being the first one in Finland to officially register at the national association office, and having had several former actives working on the ESN International level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esnfinland.eu/content/history History of ESN Finland]&lt;/ref&gt;

The section aims at fostering the integration between international students and local students in Åbo, Finland. This is done by organizing trips, both within Finland and abroad, cultural events, parties, sport events, etc.&lt;ref&gt;All ESN Åbo Akademi events can be found at the webpage [http://www.esnabo.fi www.esnabo.fi]&lt;/ref&gt;

__TOC__

==Background==

Åbo Akademi University has every year over 200 exchange students and hundreds of international students and researchers. The international students reach over 10% of the total number of students in the university which makes Åbo Akademi University the most international university in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abo.fi&lt;/ref&gt;

The association aims at fostering the integration between the exchange students and the local students at Åbo Akademi University and to improve the well-being of the exchange students in [[Åbo]]. The section organizes trips, parties, sport and cultural events, etc.

In Åbo there is, except ESN ÅA, also two other ESN sections: [http://www.esn-iac.fi ESN IAC] and [http://www.esnuniturku.fi ESN Uni Turku]. Together with ESN ÅA the three sections form the unofficial '''ESN Turku - Åbo''', which organizes most of the biggest ESN events in the city.

==History==

ESN ÅA joined the [[Erasmus Student Network|ESN network]] in 1994, and is the second oldest ESN section in Finland. The section has been, since it was founded, very active on all levels - Local, National and International, having had several National Representatives representing Finland on the international level, and also having had board members in the ESN International board, the most prestige duties within the ESN organization.

During recent years ESN Åbo Akademi has cooperated a lot with the two other ESN sections in Turku and so improved its activities notably. ESN Åbo Akademi has also taken a very active role in the work of the new, in 2010 registered, ESN Finland ry., being responsible for several projects within this organization.

==ESN Åbo Akademi traditions==

Being from the only Swedish-speaking multidisciplinary university in Finland, ESN Åbo Akademi has during the years established some traditions different from other ESN Sections in Finland. The most important is the [[Sitsit|Sitz Parties]], a tradition involving informal dinner parties including a lot of singing. This tradition comes originally from [[Sweden]], but has a long history within the Swedish-speaking minority in Finland.

In [[Finland]] an important tradition is the [[student boilersuit]]s used by the students especially during informal parties. ESN gots since 2009 also its own ones. ESN in Åbo/Turku was the first city in Finland to get own boilersuits, after which it also spread to other cities and ESN sections in Finland. Each year over 250 international student acquire student boilersuits from ESN or from their own subject associations.

ESN Turku-Åbo organizes also twice a year a City Race for the new international students. This race takes the students around Åbo and gets them to know important and touristic places in the city. International tutors and members of ESN Åbo Akademi cooperate in this event.

Since 2010 ESN ÅA organises the weekly sports events, mostly Futsal. ESN Åbo Akademi, since several years ago, also organizes monthly theme movie evenings. Beginning with the [[Cinema of Finland|Finnish movie]] evening and later also other themes such as [[Horror movie|Horror]], [[Cinema of Sweden|Swedish movies]], [[Comedy movie|Comedy]], etc.

The Expedition was a success, with 341 mammal, 545 amphibian, and thousands of insect specimens returning to the United States.,&lt;ref name="Max Hall 1964"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Capinera, John L. 2008 1153–1154"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pamphlets on Biology: Kofoid collection, Volume 1131 p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; yet its most famous legacy and find was the accidental discovery of the world's most complete skeleton of the short-necked [[pliosaur]] ''[[Kronosaurus queenslandicus]]''.

==Finding Specimens==
The MCZ being "weak in Australian animals and...desires[ing] to complete its series",&lt;ref name="nature.com"/&gt; specimen collection was as important as observation. Operating mostly in eastern and southwestern Australia,&lt;ref&gt;Australian Carabid Beetles. Some Clivina from Western Australia - http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/projects/psyche/60/60-052.html&lt;/ref&gt; at least four of the species they collected "were new to science".&lt;ref&gt;Bulletin: Museum Of Comparative Zoology - Australian Amphibia in the Museum Of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, Massachusetts (p.3) By Arthur Loveridge&lt;/ref&gt; Spending a total of three months in Western Australia, the team suffered delays in assembling the collections in Sydney, "obtaining export permits from Customs," and transporting their collections back to the States.&lt;ref name="biodiversitylibrary.org"/&gt; Then, in the last days of 1931, two expedition members returned as well – those being Professors Wheeler (the leader) and Allen, leaving their four counterparts in Sydney. Following the shrinkage of the team, William Schevill reports that Dr. Darlington began, and spent most of his time, collecting various insect, mammal, and bird specimens in the area around Sydney as well as in the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]] in New South Wales; indeed, "he was particularly among the mammals of this region."&lt;ref name="biodiversitylibrary.org"/&gt; This was the beginning of the team working on a more individual basis rather than as a group, for Schevill set out on his own to collect three times and, in February, Ralph Ellis departed from Australia; swiftly followed by medical officer Dr. Ira Dixon as, per Schevill's report, - "his continued services...[were] no longer practicable, since Dr. Darlington and I planned to collect in rather widely separated regions. Thus only two of the original six expedition members remained.&lt;ref name="biodiversitylibrary.org"/&gt;

From this point forward Schevill and Darlington met only when their work required it, the former working more closely with the then Director of the [[Queensland]] Museum (Heber A. Longman) and, through him, with Australia's Under Secretary of the Department of Agriculture and Stock (R. Wilson). The two worked together twice more, in the [[McPherson Range]] and [[Cairns]] where Darlington procured a series of [[tree kangaroo]] and Schevill worked along [[Lake Barrine]].&lt;ref name="biodiversitylibrary.org"/&gt; Indeed, noting Darlington's activities in greater detail than his own, Mr. Schevill reports that "Dr. Darlington's resourceful skill and industry had brought together, from New South Wales and Queensland, not only a large collection of insects, but also over three hundred fifty mammals, representing over sixty species, as well about fifty species of birds; in addition, he had about two hundred fifty reptiles and amphibians."&lt;ref name="biodiversitylibrary.org"/&gt; However, Philip Darlington departed Australia on August 2, 1932 - leaving and making William E. Schevill the last remaining member of the original six-men expedition. And it was Schevill, the team's fossil enthusiast, who was about to make the discovery that made the Harvard Australian Expedition famous.&lt;ref name="biodiversitylibrary.org"/&gt;

==''Kronosaurus queenslandicus''==
In the winter of 1932, Schevill was told by the rancher R.W.H. Thomas of rocks with something "odd" poking out of them on his property near Hughenden.&lt;ref name="Mather"&gt;Mather, Patricia, with Agnew, N.H. et al.

The skull—which matched the holotype jaw fragment of ''K. queenslandicus''—was prepared right away, but time and budget constraints put off restoration of the nearly complete skeleton - most of the bones of which remained unexcavated within the limestone blocks - for 20 years.

===Completion and legacy===
[[File:Kronosaurus queenslandicus.jpg|thumb|left|''K. queenslandicus'' at Harvard University which may have been reconstructed with too many vertebrae]]
This interim ended when they came to the attention of [[Godfrey Lowell Cabot]] - Boston industrialist, philanthropist, and founder of the [[Cabot Corporation]] - "who was then in his nineties had [[Thomas Handasyd Perkins#Gloucester Sea Serpent|been interested in sea serpents since childhood]]."&lt;ref name="Max Hall 1964"/&gt; Having formerly question MCZ director [[Alfred Romer]] about the existence and reports of sea serpents and it thus occurred to Dr. Romer to tell Mr. Cabot about the skeleton in the museum closet. Godfrey Cabot thus asked how much a restoration would cost and "Romer, pulling a figure out of the musty air, replied, 'Oh, about $10,000.'" Romer may not have been serious but the philanthropist clearly was because the check for said sum came shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="Max Hall 1964"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Two years - and more than $10,000 - later, following the careful labor of the museum preparators, the restored and mounted skeleton was displayed at Harvard in 1959.&lt;ref name="Mather" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Meyers" /&gt;
[[File:Kronosaurus scale.svg|thumb|right|''K. queenslandicus'' scale diagram, showing the size of the restored Harvard skeleton along with a more accurate estimate]]
However, Dr. Romer and MCZ preparator Arnold Lewis confirmed that same year in the institution's journal ''Breviora'' that "erosion had destroyed a fair fraction of this once complete and articulated skeleton...so that approximately a third of the specimen as exhibited is plaster restoration."&lt;ref&gt;Romer, A. S. and A. D. Lewis. 1959. A mounted skeleton of the giant plesiosaur Kronosaurus. Breviora 112:1-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the original (real) bones are also layered in plaster; a fact that, while keeping the fossils safe, makes it difficult for paleontologists to study it - an issue which factors into the controversial question of the true size of the ''Kronosaurus queenslandicus''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Size controversy====
Body-length estimates, largely based on the 1959 Harvard reconstruction, had previously put the total length of ''Kronosaurus'' at {{convert|12.8|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Romer &amp; Lewis, 1959"&gt;Romer AS, Lewis AD. 1959. A mounted skeleton of the giant plesiosaur ''Kronosaurus''. ''Breviora'' '''112''': 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recent studies, comparing fossil specimens of ''Kronosaurus'' to other pliosaurs suggests that the Harvard reconstruction may have included too many vertebrae, exaggerating the previous estimate, with the true length probably only {{convert|9|to|10.5|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;Kear BP. 2003.

[[File:History of Humanity Volume Cover 1.jpg|thumb|History of Humanity - Volume I]]

The [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/dialogue/general-and-regional-histories/history-of-humanity/ History of Humanity] is part of [[UNESCO]]’s [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/dialogue/general-and-regional-histories/ General and Regional Histories] Collection.  The publication seeks to contribute to mutual understanding and dialogue between cultures and civilizations. This series seeks to illustrate the encounters between cultures across history and their respective contributions to the general progress of humankind. This is done through the promotion of a pluralist vision of history.

== Objectives and Main Themes ==
::“Combining political, cultural, social and economic history, the many volumes produced have put in perspective, what constitutes, in the diversity of practices, the conceptions and memories that form part of the common heritage of humanity. That was, in particular, the objective of the History of the Scientific and Cultural Development of Mankind.” [[Koichiro Matsuura]], Director-General of UNESCO, 2009 [1]

The [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/dialogue/general-and-regional-histories/history-of-humanity/ History of Humanity – Scientific and Cultural Development] (the complete title of the first edition of the series), provides a universal history of humanity, encompassing a multiplicity of points of view, memories, and opinions from all over the world and from varying points in history. This major task was undertaken by [[UNESCO]] with the collaboration of over 450 distinguished scholars and researchers. This account of history explores the vastness of human cultural progress around the world, seeking to promote mutual respect and solidarity through the disarming of history. [[File:Wikijunior Ancient Civlizations II.png|thumb|''Ancient Civilizations'' Copyright William R. Wilson via Wikimedia Commons]]

The volumes begin with the prehistoric period and the beginnings of civilization, and go through to the twentieth century. Traditional methods of historical research based on written sources are used along with more contemporary critical methods, oral sources, and contributions from archaeology. The [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/dialogue/general-and-regional-histories/history-of-humanity/ History of Humanity] was published in six volumes and in several languages, including English, French, Italian, Russian, Spanish and Portuguese.

== History ==
The initial ideas for [[UNESCO]] to work on a project illustrating the collective memory of humanity were raised in 1946. Following the establishment of the International Scientific Committee and the formation of international teams to undertake the research, the first edition of this series, [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/dialogue/general-and-regional-histories/history-of-humanity/ The History of Humanity - Scientific and Cultural Development], was completed in 1966. Over the following decades, with unprecedented developments in social and physical sciences and technological advances, the project was adapted and again readapted to properly reflect these changes. The second edition was therefore prepared beginning in 1980 and completed in 2009.

==Career==
Professionally, Vail's most notable role was as a [[Russians|Russian]] [[scientist]] Dr. Olga Vukavitch in the late 1990s and early 2000s [[UPN]] [[science fiction]] [[television series]] ''[[Seven Days (TV series)|Seven Days]]''. Vail received positive reviews for her performance on the show.&lt;ref name="The Dispatch"&gt;{{cite news |title='Seven Days' |first=John |last=Martin |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HZkbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=t1IEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6671,3347528&amp;dq=justina-vail&amp;hl=en |newspaper=The Dispatch |date=6 October 1998 |accessdate=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, she won a [[Saturn Award]] for best supporting actress, winning out over ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''{{'}}s [[Amanda Tapping]].&lt;ref name="GateWorld"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/archive/000606_2.shtml |title=Stargate SG-1 wins Saturn Award: Show honored by science fiction academy |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=6 June 2000 |work= |publisher=GateWorld |accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, however, there were reports of dissatisfaction on set. Co-star [[Don Franklin]] expressed his dissatisfaction with the show,&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune"&gt;{{cite news |title=Don Franklin wants a lot more than `Seven Days' |first=Greg |last=Baerg |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/71033939.html?dids=71033939:71033939&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+11%2C+2001&amp;author=Greg+Baerg%2C+Zap2itcom&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=DON+FRANKLIN+WANTS+A+LOT+MORE+THAN+%60SEVEN+DAYS%27&amp;pqatl=google |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=11 April 2001 |accessdate=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Vail was reported to have left the show entirely&lt;ref name="The Vindicator"&gt;{{cite news |title=Network to pull 'Seven Days': The network will have four unaired episodes |author=Knight Ridder Tribune |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3o1cAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tVcNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4272,4213836&amp;dq=justina-vail&amp;hl=en |newspaper=The Vindicator |date=4 April 2001 |accessdate=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (according to some show sources over a dispute with ''Seven Days'' co-star [[Jonathan LaPaglia]]&lt;ref name="EW"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sleeping With the Enemy: Plus, unrest on the set of UPN's "7 Days," and more |first=Lynette |last=Rice |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20354695_92730,00.html |newspaper=Entertainment Weekly |date=21 March 2001 |accessdate=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;), only to later return and finish the third season.&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune"/&gt;

Vail also guest-starred in an episode of ''[[Highlander: The Series]]''. The episode (along with several others like it) were attempts to pilot female immortal leads for the short-lived ''[[Highlander: The Raven]]''. Reviews of the episode were mixed, offering criticism of Vail's character, but not her performance. Ultimately, Vail's character was not the one chosen for the new show.&lt;ref name="Highlander"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitallyobsessed.com/displaylegacy.php?ID=6931 |title=Highlander Season Six: The Final Season |last1=Zimmer |first1=Mark |last2= |first2= |date=7 February 2005 |work= |publisher=DigitallyOBSESSED.com |accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lev Ivanovich Ivanov''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Лев Ива́нович Ива́нов}}; 2 March 1834, Moscow – 24 December 1901, [[Saint Petersburg]]) was a Russian ballet dancer and choreographer and later, Second [[Balletmaster]] of the [[Mariinsky Ballet|Imperial Ballet]]. As a performer with the [[Mariinsky Ballet|Imperial Ballet]], he achieved prominence after performing as an understudy in a benefit performance of ''[[La Fille Mal Gardée]]''.  He is most famous as the choreographer of ''[[Danse des petits cygnes|Dance of the Little Swans]]'' from ''[[Swan Lake]]'', Act II of ''[[Cinderella (Fitinhof-Schell)|Cinderella]]'', and ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', which he choreographed alongside [[Marius Petipa]].

==Biography==
Ivanov entered the Moscow School of Dance, but in 1844 moved to [[Saint Petersburg]] where he studied at the [[Mariinsky Ballet|Imperial Ballet]], becoming an official member of the [[Corps de ballet]] in 1852.  Among his teachers during this time were [[Jean-Antoine Petipa]], Alexandr Pimenov, [[Pierre Frédéric Malavergne]] and Emile Gredlu ({{lang|ru|Эмиль Гредлю}}).

Historically, Ivanov is credited with choreographing the entirety of premiere of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ballet ''[[The Nutcracker]]'' in 1892 due to the ill health of the ballet master, [[Marius Petipa]]. While some contemporary and modern accounts dispute this, Ivanov is still mentioned in ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Second Edition]]'' with choreographing at least the majority of the ballet as Petipa had reportedly not progressed very far in his work.&lt;ref name="goodwin2853"/&gt; Regardless of the amount of work he actually did, Petipa's was the only name listed for choreography on posters for the first production in St. Petersburg.&lt;ref name="goodwin2853"&gt;Goodwin, ''New Grove (2001)'', 2:853.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ivanov worked with Petipa on a new restaging of Tchaikovsky's ''[[Swan Lake]]'' ballet in 1895.  Ivanov choreographed the entirety of the lakeside acts, Act II and Act IV.  This includes the ''[[Danse des petits cygnes|Dance of the Little Swans]]'', an iconic ''[[pas de quatre]]'' where the four cygnets huddle together and dance in unison, before breaking the chain and falling to the floor whilst attempting to fly. Ivanov also choreographed the ''Danse Vénitienne'' (Neapolitan/Venetian Dance) and the ''Pas Hongrois'' (Hungarian Dance) of the third bier scene.&lt;ref name="goodwin2584"&gt;Goodwin, ''New Grove (2001)'', 2:584.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his last years Ivanov was in financial straits. On the strength of his 50 years' service he petitioned the Imperial Theatres for financial assistance.&lt;ref name="goodwin2584"/&gt;

'''Makerere University, Kampala''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|k|ɛr|ər|i}} ;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Roach, Jane Setter, John Esling, eds., ''Cambridge English Pronouncing Dictionary'' (Cambridge University Press, 2011; {{ISBN|0521765757}}), p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; '''MUK''') is [[Uganda]]'s largest and third-oldest institution of higher learning, first established as a [[technical school]] in 1922. In 1963, it became the [[University of East Africa]], offering courses leading to general degrees from the [[University of London]]. It became an independent national university in 1970 when the University of East Africa was split into three independent universities: [[University of Nairobi]] ([[Kenya]]), [[University of Dar es Salaam]] ([[Tanzania]]), and Makerere University. Today, Makerere University is composed of nine colleges and one school offering programmes for about 36,000 undergraduates and 4,000 postgraduates.

''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' has ranked Makerere University as the eighth best university in Africa and the 569th best university worldwide. The ''[[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]]'' for 2016 ranked it as the fourth best university in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/africa&lt;/ref&gt;

Makerere University was [[alma mater]] to many post-independence African leaders, including Ugandan president [[Milton Obote]] and   Tanzanian presidents [[Julius Nyerere]] and [[Benjamin Mkapa]]. The president of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]],  [[Joseph Kabila]], and Kenyan president [[Mwai Kibaki]] are also Makerere alumni.

In the years immediately after Uganda's independence, Makerere University was a focal point for the literary activity that was central to African nationalist culture. Many prominent writers, including [[Nuruddin Farah]], [[Ali Mazrui]], [[David Rubadiri]], [[Okello Oculi]], [[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]], [[John Ruganda]], [[Paul Theroux]], [[V. S. Naipaul]] and [[Peter Nazareth]], were at Makerere University at one point in their writing and academic careers.

Because of [[Student movements in Uganda|student unrest]] and faculty disenchantment, the university was closed three times between 2006 and 2016. The final time was on 1 November 2016 when President [[Yoweri Museveni]] declared it closed indefinitely.&lt;ref name="Statement"&gt;{{Cite news|date=22 November 2016 |title=Statement: Makerere Visitation Committee lists responsibilities |publisher=Uganda Journalists&amp;#039; Resource Centre, The African Centre for Media Excellence (ACME) |url=http://ugandajournalistsresourcecentre.com/statement-makerere-visitation-committee-lists-responsibilities/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202022921/http://ugandajournalistsresourcecentre.com/statement-makerere-visitation-committee-lists-responsibilities/ |archivedate=2 December 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university was reopened in January 2017.&lt;ref name="Reopening"&gt;{{Cite news|date=2 January 2017 |title=Makerere reopens to empty lecture rooms |publisher=New Vision|url=https://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1443193/makerere-reopens-lecture|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103130553/https://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1443193/makerere-reopens-lecture |archivedate= 15 October 2018|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Founding of the technical school===
The [[trade school]] that became Makerere University began operating in 1921 with the first classes in carpentry, building construction and mechanics.&lt;ref name="PS-Review"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Uganda. Public Service Review and Re-organization Commission |year=1990 |title=Public Service Review and Reorganisation Commission, 1989-1990, Volume 1 |location=Kampala, Uganda |publisher=Uganda. Ministry of Public Service and Cabinet Affairs |page=272 |oclc=32432462}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922 it was founded as the  "Uganda Technical College" with additional courses in the arts, education, agriculture and medicine.&lt;ref name="PS-Review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Anno"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Annotated History of Makerere University 1922–2012 |work=90 Years of Makerere University |publisher=Makerere University |url=http://www.90.mak.ac.ug/annotated-history |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911091621/http://www.90.mak.ac.ug/annotated-history |archivedate=11 September 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year it was again renamed as Makerere College.&lt;ref name="PS-Review" /&gt;  In 1928, the vocational classes were separated from the college and renamed Kampala Technical School.&lt;ref name="PS-Review" /&gt; In 1937 the college began offering post-secondary education certificate courses.&lt;ref name="Anno" /&gt;

===University===
In 1943, the British Protectorate government proposed the university, which led to a controversial struggle.  It was described as "a plot to steal African soil for European settlement," by the [[Uganda National Congress|Bataka Party]].  In response to this campaign, there was rioting in the capital of [[Kampala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1949 Makerere College was granted university status and its name became Makerere College, University of East Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Byaruhanga, Frederick K. |year=2013 |title=Student Power in Africa's Higher Education: A Case of Makerere University |edition=second |location=New York |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis (Routledge) |page=20 |isbn=978-1-135-51448-8}}, originally published in 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-415-97746-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same year, the Bataka Party had been banned by the British Protectorate government, because of acts of riot and arson committed after a Bataka protest gathering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Unrest in the 2000s===
The university was closed three times between 2006 and 2016.&lt;ref name="Barungi"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Barungi. Andrew |date=21 November 2016 |title=Makerere University is closed. Now what? |publisher=Uganda Journalists&amp;#039; Resource Centre, The African Centre for Media Excellence (ACME) |url=http://ugandajournalistsresourcecentre.com/closing-makerere-university-not-solution/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202023049/http://ugandajournalistsresourcecentre.com/closing-makerere-university-not-solution/ |archivedate=2 December 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning on 1 August 2016, the non-teaching staff went on strike demanding their back pay.  The strike lasted three weeks and the government agreed to pay them by the end of October; however, the government failed to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Tusiime |first=Christopher |date=30 November 2016 |title=Non-teaching staff in public universities to go on strike |newspaper=Campus Bee |location=Makerere University |url=https://campusbee.ug/news/breaking-non-teaching-staff-public-universities-go-strike/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202031818/https://campusbee.ug/news/breaking-non-teaching-staff-public-universities-go-strike/ |archivedate=2 December 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was but one more broken promise in the cycle of failed promises, strikes and more promises.&lt;ref name="Barungi" /&gt; That strike was followed by a strike of the lecturers over unpaid incentive pay, and that strike was joined by students in solidarity. This led to President Yoweri Museveni closing the university "indefinitely".&lt;ref name="Barungi" /&gt; Additional protests, including from parents whose children were left hanging in mid-semester, led to Museveni appointing a special commission to try to rectify the situation but with no promises of reopening.  The commission's report is due in late February 2017.&lt;ref name="Statement" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2844">'''Marie Elisabeth Joys''' (2 June 1872 – 21 November 1944) was a Norwegian [[nurse]] and [[Nursing educator|nursing teacher]].

She was born in [[Bergen]] as a daughter of teacher and military officer Wessel Joachim Reehorst Joys (1841–1922) and Lina Storjohann (1841–1925). On the maternal side she was a niece of [[Nanna Storjohann|Nanna]] and [[Johan C. H. Storjohann]], and a first cousin of [[Marie Michelet]].&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Marie Joys|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Jorunn|last=Mathisen|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Marie_Joys/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After primary school, Joys travelled to [[Berlin]] in 1892 to undergo nursing education at the institution Victoriahaus. While studying she was a subordinate nurse at Friedrichshain Hospital, and after graduating in 1895 she was hired as a chief nurse there, only 23 years of age. In 1897 she was persuaded to return to Bergen, where she was offered the job as chief nurse at the [[Haukeland University Hospital|Bergen Municipal Hospital]] surgical department. She stayed here until her retirement in 1933.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

She was credited (together with Camilla Struve and Betty Bull) with planning and establishing the first three-year [[nursing education]] in Norway. This started at Bergen Municipal Hospital in 1908. At this course they also pioneered the pre-training school, a theoretical course that aspiring nurses had to attend before entering the practical training. This idea was soon adapted by other nursing educators as well as the [[Norwegian Nurses' Union]]. Joys was a co-founder of the Norwegian Nurses' Union in 1912.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

During the [[First Balkan War]], during the winter of 1912–1913, Joys volunteered at an Ottoman [[military hospital]] in [[Constantinople]]. She thus became known as one of the first nurses to volunteer in a catastrophic setting abroad—already from her study days she had been an admirer of [[Florence Nightingale]]. In 1948 she issued her memoirs, ''Erindringer'', where she described the war among other things.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

Arntzen was awarded the [[King's Medal of Merit|King's Medal of Merit in gold]] in 1923 and the international [[Florence Nightingale Medal]] from the [[Red Cross]] in 1937. She did not marry. She died in November 1944 in Bergen.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

The '''National Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee''' ('''NJATC''') is the former name for the [[Electrical Training Alliance]], a [[nonprofit organization]] created in 1941 by the [[International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers]] (IBEW) and the [[National Electrical Contractors Association]] (NECA).

==Overview==
The organization works with [[subject-matter expert|subject matter experts]] (SMEs), industry leaders, and various manufacturers to ensure that [[electrician|electrical]] [[apprenticeship|apprentices]] in the organized [[labour movement|labor movement]] have access to the most-up-to date training initiatives in the electrical [[construction]] industry. The NJATC is committed to developing and standardizing education in the electrical industry to properly and effectively train members of NECA and the IBEW, providing the electrical construction industry with the most highly trained and highly skilled workforce possible.

Across the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] more than 200 local Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committees (JATCs) use the NJATC’s curricula to help train electrical apprentices. The NJATC develops electrical training [[curriculum|curricula]] for Inside Wireman, [[Lineman (technician)|Outside Lineman]], Voice-Data-Video (VDV), and Residential Wireman programs. Emerging technologies such as [[photovoltaics]] (solar), [[wind power]] generation and [[programmable logic controller]]s (PLCs) are also encompassed in the NJATC curricula, along with codes and safety and instrumentation training. The organization is also responsible for spearheading a variety of electrical industry certifications such as cable splicing and [[tube bending|conduit bending]].

The NJATC is well known for its “[[On-the-job training|Earn While You Learn]]” initiative that allows electrical apprentices to work and earn respectable living wages while receiving related instructional training. This program also allows JATC electrical apprenticeship programs to operate without the financial support of taxpayers. With the help of the [[American Council on Education]], the NJATC has also developed a program that allows electrical apprentices to translate their instructional training into college credit. Depending on the area of study pursued, electrical apprentices can now transfer up to 60 college credit hours from their electrical apprenticeship to [[college]]s, [[university|universities]], or [[community colleges in the United States|community colleges]].

The organization is also known for hosting the National Training Institute (NTI), the largest electrical training seminar in North America. Nearly 2,000 electrical workers attend this event to learn about new industry trends, to see new products, and to attend in-depth training seminars. NTI is also home to one of the largest electrical trade shows in the construction industry.

As of 2007, there are more than 40,000 electrical apprentices enrolled in JATC programs throughout the United States and Canada. Since its inception, more than 325,000 electrical apprentices have completed NJATC training programs and become competent [[journeyman|journeymen]], making the organization one of the largest electrical training and apprenticeship programs of its kind.

The term '''non-commercial educational''' ('''NCE''') applies to a [[radio station]] or [[TV station]] that does not accept on-air [[advertisement]]s ([[TV ad]]s or [[radio ad]]s), as defined in the [[United States]] by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC).  NCE stations do not pay [[broadcast license]] [[fee]]s for their [[non-profit]] uses of the [[radio spectrum]].  Stations which are almost always operated as NCE include [[public broadcasting]], [[community radio]], and [[college radio]], as well as many [[religious broadcasting]] stations.&lt;ref&gt;FCC 31 Nonprofit Media Though public radio and TV https://transition.fcc.gov/osp/inc-report/INoC-31-Nonprofit-Media.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reserved channels==
On the [[FM broadcast band]], the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) has reserved the lowest 20 channels, 201~220 (88.1~91.9 [[megahertz|MHz]]) for NCE stations only.  This is known as the '''reserved band'''.  It also includes channel 200 (87.9&amp;nbsp;MHz), but only for [[list of broadcast station classes|class D]] NCE stations.  This is only for "full-service" stations forced to move by a full-power station ([[KSFH (FM)|KSFH]] being the only one {{As of|2008|lc=on}}), however one [[broadcast translator]] (K200AA, a [[CSN International translators|CSN International translator]] parented to [[KAWZ]]) has been allowed to use this channel anyway.

On the [[TV band]], individual channels are reserved, such that there is at least one in every area, and almost always two or three in each [[metropolitan area]]. This is also the case for FM along [[international boundary]] zones, within 320 kilometers (just under 200 miles) of the [[Mexico–United States border]] and the [[Canada–United States border]]. This is because many of the reserved-band channels are used by stations in the other country, such as with [[San Diego-Tijuana metropolitan area#Broadcasting|broadcasting in the San Diego/Tijuana metropolitan area]]. Additionally, neither the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] nor the [[Federal Telecommunications Institute]] have such a reserved band in Canada or Mexico, respectively. (In Mexico, individual stations belonging to state and federal governments, educational institutions, and non-profit groups are licensed under permits or ''permisos'', which are non-commercial, non-profit licenses that do not permit advertising.)

NCE stations may also operate on a non-reserved channel. However this was rare in the United States due to the high cost of buying a [[commercial broadcasting]] station, and because for years the FCC failed to maintain a process that would ensure that non-commercial applicants would have a chance against those who could afford to [[Bidding|bid]] at [[spectrum auction]]s.  Two such stations are [[WGPB (FM)|WGPB]] FM in [[Rome, Georgia]] and [[WNGH-FM]] in [[Chatsworth, Georgia]], former commercial stations purchased in 2007 and 2008 and operated by [[Georgia Public Broadcasting]] (GPB), serving the [[north Georgia mountains|mountains]] northwest of [[Atlanta]] which previously had no GPB radio service. This is also rare in Mexico, though [[XEIMT-TV]], a cultural channel in Mexico City, and [[XEWH-TV]], the main station of the state network of Sonora, operate under commercial concessions and not permits. A number of new low power FM ([[Low-power broadcasting|LPFM]]) NCE stations operating in the non-reserved part of the spectrum have been licensed by the FCC since the [[Local Community Radio Act]] was enacted in 2010. 

==Definition of "commercial"==
The FCC defines several different activities as being commercial in nature.  [[Sponsor (commercial)|Sponsorship]] of NCE stations is called [[underwriting]], and stations may make [[Public service announcement|announcement]]s of these [[Grant (money)|grant]]s on-air.  However, they may not accept [[money]] for such mentions, only [[goods and services]], unless the sponsor itself is a [[non-profit]], such as a [[charitable organization]] or [[public college]].  Money can be accepted if there is no on-air mention of the sponsor.  NCE stations may also not mention prices or qualities of commercial products or services in any situation which would be construed as [[sales promotion|promoting]] or [[Testimonial|endorsing]] any company, regardless of whether it sponsors the station.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

[[Underwriting spot]]s are brief and to-the-point, as they must not be disruptive to programming.  Additionally, underwriting spots on public TV are at the beginning or end of the [[TV show]] rather than in the middle, as they have increasingly become on commercial stations.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

[[Retransmission consent]] has often been chosen over must-carry by the major commercial television networks.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} Under the present rules, a new agreement is negotiated every three years, and stations must choose must-carry or retransmission consent for each cable system they wish their signal to be carried on. Non-commercial stations (such as local PBS stations) may not seek retransmission consent and may only invoke [[must-carry]] status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/guides/cable-carriage-broadcast-stations|title=Cable Carriage of Broadcast Stations|author=|date=9 December 2015|website=fcc.gov|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multichannel obligations==
Like commercial stations, NCE stations are allowed to [[lease]] [[subcarrier]]s in exchange for [[money]], essentially making the station a [[common carrier]].  This may be for a [[Commerce|commercial]] [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]], [[video]], or [[data]] service, or a non-commercial one like a [[radio reading service]] for the [[blindness|blind]].

NCE stations broadcasting in [[digital TV]] or [[HD Radio]] may lease part of their [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] (actually [[bitrate]]) in a similar manner, however, the commercial use is limited.  The main program must always be non-commercial, and must not have its quality diminished excessively by increased [[lossy compression]] done in order to fit the auxiliary service within the allowable [[bit rate]].  NCE [[digital television]] (DTV) stations do not pay the FCC a percentage of their [[revenue]] from these leases as commercial DTV stations do.  No such [[datacasting]] fee is levied on any analog or FM/AM station, whether commercial or NCE.

'''Official Museums of Amsterdam''' ('''OAM''') is a consulting association of museums in [[Amsterdam]]. The organisation has existed since the eighties but it was formally founded in 1994. The organization contains both private and public museums, all of which are registered as members of [[De Museumvereniging]], the [[Dutch Museum Association]].

The OAM association has a limited jurisdiction and an elected chair and vice-chair.

The 'official' museums of Amsterdam actually do not exist. The name is a misleading translation of the unofficial name of an unincorporated meeting club of mostly government subsidized museums who co-ordinate their marketing to monopolize further government subsidies for city marketing and government assistance. The website of the Jewish Historical Museum slightly more correctly calls them: 'organization' of Amsterdam Museums with an office in the Amsterdam Uitburo or the city's entertainment desk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |   url=http://www.jhm.nl/organisation/joint-projects/organisation-of-amsterdam-museums/ | title= Organization of Amsterdam Museums | publisher=Jewish Historical Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the real Dutch name, as in the logo, is 'overleg' or 'meeting.'

The foundation [[Samenwerkende Amsterdamse Musea]] (SAM) represents the collective business interests of the OAM. [[Bjorn Stenvers]] was founding director of SAM from 2012 to 2017.

The '''Pay As You Earn''' program is a United States federal program that was passed into law on December 21, 2012. It was the first student debt relief law signed by President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/totalreturn/2012/11/05/a-new-student-loan-program-launches/ A New Student-Loan Program | blogs.WSJ.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qualification==
Only new borrowers may qualify if they receive a disbursement on a loan on or after October 1, 2011. You are a new borrower if you had no outstanding balance on a Direct Loan or FFEL Program loan when you received a Direct Loan or FFEL Program loan on or after Oct. 1, 2007.  As with Income-Based Repayment (IBR), the borrower must prove Partial Financial Hardship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/understand/plans/pay-as-you-earn Pay as You Earn | Studentaid.ed.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed changes==

President Obama's 2015 budget proposes substantial changes to the Pay As You Earn program.  In addition to extending the program to all borrowers, regardless of when their first loans were disbursed, it proposes certain limits to PAYE that are designed to "protect against institutional practices that may further increase student indebtedness, while ensuring the program provides sufficient relief for students committed to public service." These proposed changes include:

• Eliminating the standard payment cap under PAYE so that high-income, high-balance borrowers pay an equitable share of their earnings as their income rises;

• Calculating payments for married borrowers filing separately on the combined household Adjusted Gross Income;

• Capping Public Sector Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) at the aggregate loan limit for independent undergraduate students to protect against institutional practices that may further increase student indebtedness, while ensuring the program provides sufficient relief for students committed to public service;

• Establishing a 25-year forgiveness period for borrowers with balances above the aggregate loan limit for independent undergraduate students;

• Preventing payments made under non-income driven repayment plans from being applied toward PSLF to ensure that loan forgiveness is targeted to students with the greatest need; and

• Capping the amount of interest that can accrue when a borrower’s monthly payment is insufficient to cover the interest to avoid ballooning loan balances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget15/justifications/s-loansoverview.pdf  U.S. Dep't of Education | Student Loans Overview - Fiscal Year 2015 Budget Proposal]&lt;/ref&gt;

In sum, although the budget proposes to expand PAYE to all borrowers, it severely restricts its benefits for those with high income/high student loan balances and for those pursuing careers in public interest.  If passed, it is unclear whether those who borrowed prior to the implemented changes will be grandfathered in to existing PAYE, IBR, and PSLF plans.

A petition has been started asking the White House to reconsider its limitations on the PSLF program.

==PAYE extension==

On June 9, 2014, President Barack Obama announced an [[executive order]] to extend the Pay as You Earn (PAYE) repayment to student loans acquired before October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/06/09/factsheet-making-student-loans-more-affordable White House Factsheet | Whitehouse.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Petr Beckmann''' (November 13, 1924 – August 3, 1993) was a professor of [[electrical engineering]] who became a well-known advocate of [[libertarianism]] and [[nuclear power]]. Later in his life he challenged [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]] and other accepted theories in [[modern physics]].

==Biography==
In 1939, when Beckmann was 14, his family fled their home in [[Prague, Czechoslovakia]] to escape the [[Nazis]]. From 1942 to 1945, he served in a [[Czechs|Czech]] squadron of the [[RAF]].  He received a B.Sc. in 1949, a [[Ph.D.]] in 1955, and a D.Sc. in 1962, all from [[Prague]]'s [[Czech Academy of Sciences]] in [[electrical engineering]].  He [[defector|defected]] to the [[United States]] in 1963 and became a Professor (later, [[Emeritus]]) of [[electrical engineering]] at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]]. In the United States, he became acquainted with novelist [[Ayn Rand]], a contributing editor to a publication devoted to her ideas, ''[[The Intellectual Activist]]'', and a speaker at The Thomas Jefferson School, an intellectual conference of similar purpose.

Beckmann was a prolific author; he wrote several electrical engineering textbooks and non-technical works.  By 1968 he had founded Golem Press, which published most of his books, including ''The Health Hazards of Not Going Nuclear'' (1976), which argued in favor of [[nuclear power]] during the height of the [[anti-nuclear]] movement by contrasting the cost, in human terms, with the equivalent costs of the alternatives available.  Beckmann also wrote  ''[[A History of Pi|A History of {{math|π}}]]'', documenting the history of the calculation of [[pi|{{math|π}}]].  He published his own monthly newsletter, ''Access to Energy'', which since September 1993 has been written by [[Arthur B. Robinson]].

In 1981, he took early retirement with Emeritus status, in order to devote himself fully to what he saw as the defense of science, technology and [[free enterprise]], through his newsletter, ''Access to Energy''. He founded the Golem Press in 1967, publishing more than nine books. These included ''The History of {{math|π}}'', ''Einstein Plus Two'', and ''The Health Hazards of Not Going Nuclear'' (with an Introduction by [[Edward Teller]]). He wrote more than 60 scientific papers and eight technical books. Dr. Beckmann spoke at [[International Society for Individual Liberty]](ISIL)'s San Francisco Conference in 1990 where he received a standing ovation for his speech in which he attacked "sham environmentalists".&lt;ref&gt;FREEDOM NETWORK NEWS, [http://www.rkba.org/libertarian/isil/fnn/fnn04.txt OBITUARIES – DR. PETR BECKMANN, 1924–1993] (Fall 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

Beckmann was also a frequent and colorful participant in [[Usenet]] debates. In them, he claimed to have debunked [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of special relativity]] in his book ''Einstein Plus Two'' as well as in a disputatious journal, ''Galilean Electrodynamics'', which he also founded. The ''History of π'' also expresses his  intense and colorful opposition to [[Catholicism]] (and other [[religion]]s), [[Nazism]], and [[Communism]].

{{Sri Lankan Tamil history}}
The '''policy of standardization''' was a policy implemented by the Sri Lankan government in 1971&lt;ref name="worldbank pub"&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTSRILANKA/Resources/App1.pdf The Root Causes of the Ethnic Conflict in Sri Lanka]&lt;/ref&gt;  to rectify disparities created in university enrollment in [[Sri Lanka]] under Colonial rule.&lt;ref name='jej-e3w'/&gt; In 1972, the government added a district quota as a parameter within each language.&lt;ref name="worldbank pub"/&gt;

==The reasoning for the law==

In 1946 minister C. W. W. Kannangara introduced free education in all the government institutions (Schools, government universities) in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailynews.lk/2009/06/08/fea26.asp Daily News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518031057/http://www.dailynews.lk/2009/06/08/fea26.asp |date=2013-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Government funded all the money by bearing the expenses.

Under the [[British India|British]], English was the state language and consequently greatly benefited English speakers. However the majority of Sri Lankan populace lived outside urban areas and did not belong to the social elite, and therefore did not enjoy the benefits of English-medium education. The issue was compounded further by the fact that in Northern and Eastern regions of the island, where a largely [[Tamil people|Tamil]] populace resided,&lt;ref name='jej-e3w'&gt;{{cite book  | last =Jayasuriya  | first =J. E. | title =Education in the Third World  | publisher =[[Indian Institute of Education]]  | year =1981  | location =[[Pune]]  | oclc =  7925123 }}&lt;/ref&gt; students had access to English-medium education through missionary schools regardless of their socio-economy strata. This created a situation where a large proportion of students enrolled in universities throughout the country were English speaking Tamils and [[Sinhalese People|Sinhalese]] from urban centers like Colombo,&lt;ref name='jej-e3w'/&gt; particularly in professional courses such as [[medicine]] and [[engineering]].

==The implementation of the law==
The government policy of standardization in essence was an [[affirmative action]] scheme to assist geographically disadvantaged students to gain tertiary education. The benefits enjoyed by Sinhalese students also meant a significant fall in the number of Tamil students within the Sri Lankan university student populace.

University selection of 1971 was calculated based on language they sit. Numbers of allocations were proportional to the number of participants who sat to the examination in that language. As guaranteed before the exam, Tamil share was dropped to the proportion of the Tamils medium students(According to 1971 consensus 27% of the total population used Tamil as first medium).&lt;ref name="worldbank pub"/&gt;

According to 1971 exam results, a large proportion of the Tamil allocation was enjoyed by Tamils in Jaffna and a large proportion of the Sinhalese share was enjoyed by the Sinhalese in Colombo.

In 1972 government added district quota as a parameter within each languages.&lt;ref name="worldbank pub"/&gt; 30% of university places were allocated on the basis of island-wide merit; half the places were allocated on the basis of comparative scores within districts and an additional 15% reserved for students from under privileged districts.

==The effect of the law==
30% of university places were allocated on the basis of island-wide merit; half the places were allocated on the basis of comparative scores within districts and an additional 15% reserved for students from under privileged districts.

In 1969, the [[Northern Province, Sri Lanka|Northern Province]], which was largely populated by Tamils and comprised 7%&lt;ref name='dos-pds'&gt;''Department of Census and Statistics'', [http://www.statistics.gov.lk/PopHouSat/PDF/Population/p9p1%20Growth.pdf Population by district, size, intercensal increase and average growth rates]&lt;/ref&gt; of the population of the country, provided 27.5 percent of the entrants to science-based courses in Sri Lankan universities. By 1974, this was reduced to 7%.&lt;ref name='jej-e3w'/&gt; However, the hardest hit population group were the urban Tamils and Sinhalese in the [[Western Province, Sri Lanka|Western Province]], which contained 26%&lt;ref name='dos-pds'/&gt; of the islands population. In 1969, the Western Province provided 67.5 percent of admissions to science-based courses. This reduced to 27% in 1974, after the law came into effect.&lt;ref name='jej-e3w'/&gt; The majority of the share enjoyed by Jaffna Tamils were distributed among Tamils in other areas ( Eastern province, Hill country and Muslims) . Majority of the share enjoyed by Colombo was distributed among rest of the Sinhalese.

"In 1971, a system of standardisation of marks was introduced for admissions to the universities, obviously directed against Tamil-medium students (referred to earlier). K.M. de Silva describes it as follows:

'The qualifying mark for admission to the medical faculties was 250 (out of 400) for Tamil students, whereas it was only 229 for the Sinhalese. Worse still, this same pattern of a lower qualifying mark applied even when Sinhalese and Tamil students sat for the examination in English. In short, students sitting for examinations in the same language, but belonging to two ethnic groups, had different qualifying marks.'

He observes that by doing this in such an obviously discriminatory way, 'the United Front Government of the 1970s caused enormous harm to ethnic relations.'

This was not the end; in 1972 the 'district quota system' was introduced, again to the detriment of the [[Sri Lankan Tamil people]]. The (Sinhalese) historian C.R. de Silva wrote:

'By 1977 the issue of university admissions had become a focal point of the conflict between the government and Tamil leaders. Tamil youth, embittered by what they considered discrimination against them, formed the radical wing of the Tamil United Liberation Front. Many advocated the use of violence to establish a separate Tamil state of Eelam. It was an object lesson of how inept policy measures and insensitivity to minority interests can exacerbate ethnic tensions .'

==Reaction==

When the policy was implemented, the urban Sinhalese population had reconciled themselves to the fact that the position of privilege they had enjoyed under the British would not last forever, and the situation had to stabilize at the population level.&lt;ref name='jej-e3w'/&gt; However Tamils saw the policy along communal terms, and strongly opposed the move.&lt;ref name='jej-e3w'/&gt;

== Changing the standardization ==

The language based standardization of university entrance was abandoned in 1977, and introduced different standardization based on merits, district quotas. 80% of the university places were filled in accordance with raw marks scored by students. The remaining 20% of places was allocated to students in districts with inadequate educational facilities.&lt;ref name='jej-e3w'/&gt;

'''Education in Australia''' can be classified according to sources of funding and administrative structures. There are two broad categories of school in [[Australia]]: public schools (also known as government or state schools) and private schools, which can be further subdivided into Catholic schools and independent schools.

==Primary and secondary==
At primary and secondary levels, government schools educate about half of students.  The major part of their costs is met by the relevant state or territory government.&lt;ref name="immedu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immi.gov.au/living-in-australia/settle-in-australia/everyday-life/education/whatis.htm|title=What is the Australian education system?|publisher=[[Department of Immigration and Citizenship]]|accessdate=2010-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Private schools, both religious or secular (the latter often with specialisations), may charge higher fees.  Regardless of whether a school is government or private, it is regulated by the same curriculum standards framework.  Most schools, government and private, enforce a uniform or dress code, although there are varying expectations.

===Government===
Government (or state) schools are run by the respective state government. They offer free education; however, many schools ask parents to pay a contribution fee and a materials and services charge. They can be divided into two categories: open and [[selective school]]. Open schools accept all students from their government-defined catchment areas, and teach using the [[curriculum]]. Many open government schools have selective classes in which better-performing students are offered extended and accelerated work. Selective government schools are considered more prestigious than open government schools. They have high entrance requirements and cater to a much larger area. Entrance to selective schools is often highly competitive.

Access to Selective schools, grammar schools and upper stream of public schools is not available for people on temporary resident visa.

===Private===
[[File:Scotch College Melbourne chapel 2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Chapel at [[Scotch College, Melbourne]], a well known private Australian P-Y12 college]]
Private schools can  be divided into two groups. Religion-based systems of education are operated by the [[:Category:Anglican schools in Australia|Anglican]], [[:Category:Lutheran schools in Australia|Lutheran]], and [[:Category:Roman Catholic schools in Australia|Roman Catholic]] [[Christian denomination|denominations]] as well as a number of other church or [[parachurch]]-based low-fee schools. By far the most numerous are [[Catholic school]]s, which are run by diocese-based educational institutions within the Catholic Church called the Catholic Education/Schools Offices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceomelb.catholic.edu.au/|title=Catholic Education Office Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; although some more prestigious Catholic schools are independent. The rest are known as [[independent school]]s, which are largely [[Protestant]] [[grammar school]]s. There are also a few Jewish and [[Islamic organisations in Australia#schools|Islamic schools]], and a growing number of independent [[Montessori education|Montessori]] and [[Waldorf education|Waldorf]] schools.

The [[International Baccalaureate]] programmes are taught at over 150 schools, both private and state.

The major independent schools in each city (such as the [[Associated Public Schools of Victoria|APS Schools]] and the [[Associated Grammar Schools of Victoria|AGSV Schools]] in Melbourne) charge high fees (up to $30,000 per year) and are therefore able to afford facilities that government schools and church-run Catholic schools cannot. Funding for independent schools often comes under criticism from the [[Australian Education Union]] and the [[Australian Labor Party]] because, in addition to their fees, these schools also receive funding from both state and federal governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aeufederal.org.au/Publications/1999/ReidPaper.html|title=The Redefinition of Public Education|author=Alan Reid|accessdate=2010-02-16}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is sometimes assumed, by parents or other observers, that attending a private school will guarantee achievement in later life, because of a perceived superiority, real or imagined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/resources/e-seminars/potts-paper|title=Public and Private Schooling in Australia - Historical and Contemporary Considerations|author=Anthony Potts|publisher=Institute of Historical Research|accessdate=2010-02-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425000806/http://www.history.ac.uk/resources/e-seminars/potts-paper|archivedate=2011-04-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Private school fees can vary from under $100 per month&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ypct.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6722&amp;Itemid=66|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402133041/http://www.ypct.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6722&amp;Itemid=66|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2015-04-02|title=Private Schools fee rise|author=Rhiannon Koch|newspaper=[[Yorke Peninsula]] Country Times|pages=|publisher=|date=2010-02-17}} &lt;/ref&gt; to $2000 and upwards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exfin.com/private-school-costs|title=Private School Fees and Costs|accessdate=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the student's year level and the school's size. Private school uniforms tend to be more expensive than those for public schools, and more strictly enforced.

==Tertiary==
Both private and public [[List of universities in Australia|universities]] can be found in Australia.  As of 2006, there are 36 public, two Catholic and one non-profit private universities in Australia.  Admissions by Australian citizens to public and Catholic universities in Australia are based on the prospective student's academic achievement.  Admission to the private university, [[Bond University]], is dependent on a student's ability to pay tuition fees as well as academic achievement and "one on one" interviews with admission officers (the only university in Australasia to do this for all students).  [[Melbourne University Private]] was a whole university developed and owned by a public university to operate under this model.

Domestic students are not usually subject to upfront fees at a public university if enrolled in a Commonwealth Supported Place.  As well as receiving substantial government subsidies to the cost of tertiary education, students in CSPs have the option of deferring their financial contributions to their education completely via the [[Tertiary education fees in Australia#Commonwealth supported students|Commonwealth Supported Students]] scheme.  Students may also enrol in a non-Commonwealth Supported Place, known as a [[Tertiary education fees in Australia#Fee-paying students|FULL-FEE]] place, and must pay all upfront fees, which are typically greater than a standard [[Tertiary education fees in Australia#Commonwealth supported students|Commonwealth Supported Students]] debt, usually undertaken to reduce academic entrance requirements. The [[Government of Australia|national government]] provides funding for all universities in Australia.&lt;ref name="immedu" /&gt;

'''Recy Taylor''' (''née'' '''Corbitt'''; December 31, 1919&amp;nbsp;– December 28, 2017)&lt;ref name="at the dark" /&gt;{{rp|297}} was an [[African-American]] woman from [[Abbeville, Alabama|Abbeville]] in [[Henry County, Alabama]], U.S. She was born and raised in a [[sharecropping]] family in the [[Jim Crow]] era [[Southern United States]].  Taylor's refusal to remain silent about a brutal rape she suffered, perpetrated by white men, led to organizing in the African-American community on behalf of justice and civil rights.

On September 3, 1944, Taylor was [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] while leaving church and [[gang-rape]]d by six white men.&lt;ref name="at the dark"&gt;{{cite book|last=McGuire|first=Danielle L.|title=At the Dark End of the Street: Black Women, Rape, and Resistance&amp;mdash;A New History of the Civil Rights Movement from Rosa Parks to the Rise of Black Power|year=2010|publisher=[[Random House]] |isbn=978-0-307-26906-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xv-xvii}} Despite the men's confessions to authorities, two grand juries subsequently declined to indict the men; no charges were ever brought against her assailants.&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/12/29/obituaries/recy-taylor-alabama-rape-victim-dead.html|title=Recy Taylor, Who Fought for Justice After a 1944 Rape, Dies at 97|last=Chan|first=Sewell|work=New York Times|date=December 29, 2017|access-date=December 30, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[Alabama Legislature]] officially apologized on behalf of the state "for its failure to prosecute her attackers." Taylor's rape, refusal to remain silent, and the subsequent court cases were among the early instances of nationwide protest and activism among the African-American community, and ended up providing an organizational spark in the [[civil rights movement]].&lt;ref name="at the dark" /&gt;{{rp|39}}

At the [[75th Golden Globe Awards|2018 Golden Globe Awards]], while accepting the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award]], [[Oprah Winfrey]] discussed and brought awareness to Taylor's story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2018/01/08/recy-taylor-woman-whose-rape-inspired-rosa-parks-1944-inspiring/|title=Recy Taylor: the woman whose rape inspired Rosa Parks in 1944, and is inspiring Oprah Winfrey today|last=Vincent|first=Alice|date=2018|work=The Telegraph|access-date=January 8, 2018|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Congressional Black Caucus]] led Democratic Caucus members in wearing red "Recy" pins while attending the 2018 [[State of the Union]],  where Taylor's granddaughter, Mary Joyce Owens, was a guest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna842271?__twitter_impression=true |title='She spoke up': Lawmakers wear 'Recy' pins in honor of Recy Taylor |publisher=Nbcnews.com |date= |accessdate=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Recy Corbitt was born on December 31, 1919 in rural Alabama, where her family were farmworkers doing [[sharecropping]].  At 17, her mother died and she cared for her six siblings.  She continued to work in sharecropping and by the time she was 24 in 1944, she had married Willie Guy Taylor and they had a young daughter, Joyce Lee.&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes/&gt;

==Assault==
Recy Taylor was walking home from church on September 3, 1944, with her friend Fannie Daniel and Daniel's teenage son West, when a car pulled up on the side of the road. In the car were [[US Army]] Private Herbert Lovett and six other men, all armed. Herbert Lovett accused Taylor of cutting Tommy Clarson "that white boy in [[Clopton, Alabama|Clopton]] this evening."&lt;ref name="at the dark" /&gt;{{rp|xv}} This accusation was false, as Taylor had been with Daniel all day. The seven men forced Taylor into the car at gunpoint and proceeded to drive her to a patch of trees on the side of the road. They forced her to remove her clothes saying "Get them rags off, or I'll kill you and leave you down here in the woods." After she was forcibly undressed, Taylor begged to return home to her family, including her husband and an infant child. The assailants ignored her requests, all removed their clothes, and watched as Lovett ordered Taylor to lie down and for her to "act just like you do with your husband or I'll cut your damn throat."&lt;ref name="at the dark" /&gt;{{rp|xvi}} She was raped by six of the men, including Lovett.&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcguire2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGuire|first=Danielle L.|date=December 2004|title="It Was like All of Us Had Been Raped": Sexual Violence, Community Mobilization, and the African American Freedom Struggle|journal=The Journal of American History|volume=91|number=3|pages=906–931|doi=10.2307/3662860|url=https://www.cla.purdue.edu/from-plessy-to-brown/activities/3662860.pdf|access-date=January 9, 2018|jstor=3662860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions to the assault==
Taylor's kidnapping was reported immediately to the police by Daniel. Daniel identified the car as belonging to Hugo Wilson, who admitted to picking up Taylor and, as he put it, "carrying her to the spot" and pinned the rape on six men, Dillard York, Billy Howerton, Herbert Lovett, Luther Lee, Joe Culpepper and Robert Gamble.&lt;ref name="at the dark" /&gt;{{rp|6–7}} Even though three eyewitnesses identified Wilson as the driver of the car, the police did not call in any of the men Wilson named as assailants, and Wilson was fined $250 ({{Inflation|US|250|1944|fmt=eq|r=-1}}).&lt;ref name="at the dark" /&gt;{{rp|8}} The black community of Abbeville was outraged at the actions taken by the police, and the event was reported to the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) in [[Montgomery, Alabama]].&lt;ref name="at the dark" /&gt;{{rp|xvii}} The NAACP sent down their best investigator and activist against [[sexual assault]]s on black women, [[Rosa Parks]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.al.com/wire/2010/10/southern_black_women_find_just.html "Southern black women find justice elusive for civil rights-era rapes"]. Associated Press, October 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  In early October, the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'', which had a national African-American audience, ran a front-page article entitled "Victim of White Alabama Rapists", which profiled Taylor and the case.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;

==First trial==
Parks took the case back to Montgomery where she started to form support for Taylor with the assistance of [[E.D. Nixon]], Rufas A. Lewis, and E.G. Jackson, all influential men in the Montgomery community. Parks and her allies formed the Alabama [[The Committee for Equal Justice|Committee for Equal Justice]] for Taylor, "with support from national labor unions, African-American organizations, and women's groups." The group recruited supporters across the entire country and by the spring of 1945 they had organized what the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'' called the "strongest campaign for [[Equal justice under law|equal justice]] to be seen in a decade."&lt;ref name="at the dark" /&gt;{{rp|13}}

The trial took place on October 3–4, 1944, with an all-white, all-male jury. However, none of the assailants had been arrested, which meant that the only witnesses were Taylor's black friends and family. Taylor's family could not identify the names of the assailants, and since Sheriff Gamble "never arranged a police line-up, Taylor could not identify her attackers in court". Also, the $250 bond Gamble placed Wilson and his accomplices under "were issued late in the afternoon, the day ''after'' Taylor's hearing".&lt;ref name="at the dark" /&gt;{{rp|13}} After five minutes of deliberation, the jury dismissed the case. The only way it could be re-opened would be through an [[indictment]] from the grand jury.

==Violent intimidation==
In the months following the trial, Taylor received multiple [[death threat]]s, and her home was [[firebombing|firebombed]] by [[White supremacy|white supremacists]]. Taylor, along with her husband and child, moved into the family home, where her father and siblings would help protect Taylor from other death threats. Her entire family was afraid to go out after dark, and Taylor would not leave even during the day. She not only feared the threats from the angry [[vigilante]]s of the town, but also the threats from her attackers the night of the assault. Benny Corbitt took guard in a tree every night with a gun guarding Taylor and her family until daybreak. Taylor and her family assumed they would live the rest of their lives in fear. However, talk of "the brutal rape and phony hearing" resonated through NAACP chapters throughout the south and within black communities. These organizations and others came together to defend Taylor and demand punishment for her attackers as well as Taylor's safety.&lt;ref name="at the dark" /&gt;{{rp|14}}

==Activism for justice==
The activists convened at the [[Negro Masonic Hall|Negro Masonic Temple]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], where members of the Montgomery and Birmingham NAACP, editors and reporters from the ''Alabama Tribune'' and ''Birmingham World'', and members of the [[Southern Negro Youth Congress]], or SNYC, amongst others coordinated efforts to bring justice for Recy Taylor. SNYC members, together with Rosa Parks and other primarily female activists helped spread Recy Taylor's story all the way up the coast to [[Harlem, New York]].&lt;ref name="at the dark" /&gt;{{rp|15}} Stories of Taylor's assault were printed in the ''[[Pittsburgh Courier]]'' making the "rape of Recy Taylor a southern injustice" which "immediately sparked nation-wide interest." This led to a publication in the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' titled "Alabama Authorities Ignore White Gang's Rape of Negro Mother" and attacked the long lasting [[Racial segregation|segregation]] and defense of white womanhood as well as the "manipulation of interracial rape to justify violence against black men."&lt;ref name="at the dark" /&gt;{{rp|17}} After various other newspaper publications and widespread knowledge of the attack, black activists started writing to the then Governor of Alabama, [[Chauncey Sparks]].&lt;ref name="1945 letters"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital.archives.alabama.gov/cdm/ref/collection/voices/id/8028 |title=Material related to the case of Recy Taylor, an African American woman who was raped by six white teenagers in her hometown of Abbeville, Alabama. |date=January–October 1945|website=[[Alabama Department of Archives and History]] |access-date=January 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sparks had promised during his election campaign to "keep the federal government's nose out of Alabama business", so after numerous attacks including comparisons of the Henry County's police to the [[Nazis]], "Governor Sparks reluctantly agreed to launch an investigation."&lt;ref name="at the dark" /&gt;{{rp|119–125}}

Rosa Parks, in her instrumental work to bring justice for Taylor, spearheaded the creation of the "[[Committee for Equal Justice for the Rights of Mrs. Recy Taylor|Committee for Equal Justice for Mrs. Recy Taylor]]" (CEJRT). It quickly gathered national support, with local chapters springing up across the United States. The group had an illustrious membership; "luminaries included [[W.E.B. Du Bois]]; [[Mary Church Terrell]], a suffragist and founder of the [[National Association of Colored Women]]; [[Charlotte Hawkins Brown]], a popular clubwoman and respected educator; Ira De A. Reid, a [[sociologist]] and assistant director of the new formed [[Southern Regional Council]]; [[John Sengstacke]], the publisher of the [[Chicago Defender]]; [[Countee Cullen]] and [[Langston Hughes]] of [[Harlem Renaissance]] fame; [[Lillian Smith (author)|Lillian Smith]], author of the controversial interracial love story ''[[Strange Fruit (novel)|Strange Fruit]]''; and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] impresario [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]." The "illustrious" group drew the attention of the [[FBI]] as the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] argued that the group was simply a cover for the [[Communist Party]].&lt;ref name="at the dark" /&gt;{{rp|31}}

==Investigation==
After Governor Sparks launched an investigation, Sheriff Gamble was interviewed again about the measures he took to ensure justice on the behalf of Taylor. Gamble falsely claimed that he started an investigation of his own immediately after the attack. He also claimed that he had arrested all of the men involved in the rape two days after the assault, and that he had placed Hugo Wilson, the man identified as being the owner of the car, under a $500 bond. He also accused Taylor of being "nothing but a whore around Abbeville" and that she had been "treated for some time by the Health Officer of Henry County for venereal disease." Later, other white men from Abbeville identified Taylor as an "upstanding, respectable woman who abided by the town's racial and sexual mores".&lt;ref name="at the dark" /&gt;{{rp|33}} Investigators interviewed the rapists, and four of the seven men "admitted to having intercourse with Taylor, but argued that she was essentially a prostitute and willing participant."&lt;ref name="at the dark" /&gt;{{rp|34}} Others, including Herbert Lovett, denied knowing anything about the attack. However, one of the assailants, Joe Culpepper, admitted that he and the other rapists were out looking for a woman the night of the attack, that Lovett got out of the car with a gun and spoke to Taylor, that Taylor was forced into the car and later forced out of the car and made to undress at gunpoint, was raped and later blindfolded and left on the side of the road. Culpepper's retelling of the story was directly in line with Taylor's original account. However, even with this information including several of the alleged assailants testimonies, the attorney general "failed to convince the jurors of Henry County that there was enough evidence to indict the seven suspects when he presented Taylor's case on February 14, 1945."&lt;ref name="at the dark" /&gt;{{rp|35}} The second all-white male jury refused to issue any indictments.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2017/11/27/the-gang-rape-was-horrific-the-naacp-sent-rosa-parks-to-investigate-it/ |title=Recy Taylor’s brutal rape: The NAACP sent Rosa Parks to investigate |last=Brown |first=DeNeen L. |date=January 8, 2018|work=Washington Post |access-date=January 10, 2018|language=en-US |issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The black community was shocked at the second dismissal of Taylor's case. The news coverage of the second hearing was more hostile towards Taylor based on the false claims of her being a prostitute. The assistant attorney general stated that: "This case has been presented to two grand juries in Henry County and both grand juries have not seen fit to find an indictment", claiming that "no facts or circumstances connected with this case have been suppressed."&lt;ref name="at the dark" /&gt;{{rp|36}} Despite the outcome, the case was considered a major victory for the formation of the civil rights movement because of the successful mobilization of activists across the nation: "The Recy Taylor case brought the building blocks of the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott|Montgomery bus boycott]] together a decade earlier."&lt;ref name="at the dark" /&gt;{{rp|39}}

Taylor lived in Abbeville with her family for two decades after the attack. She said that during those years she lived "in fear, and many white people in the town continued to treat her badly, even after her attackers left." She eventually moved to Florida where she worked picking oranges.  She later separated from her husband.  Their only child died in an automobile accident in 1967.  Taylor lived for many years in [[Winter Haven, Florida]], until her family brought her back to Abbeville, due to failing health.&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes/&gt;

The publication of Danielle L. McGuire's book ''At the Dark End of the Street:&amp;nbsp;Black Women, Rape, and Resistance&amp;mdash;a New History of the Civil Rights Movement from Rosa Parks to the Rise of Black Power'' in 2011 led to&amp;nbsp;formal apologies&amp;nbsp;from the [[Alabama Legislature]] to Taylor on behalf of the state "for its failure to prosecute her attackers."&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes/&gt;&lt;ref name="CRRJ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nuweb9.neu.edu/civilrights/apologies/acknowledging-its-complicity-in-denying-justice-to-recy-taylor-the-state-of-alabama-issues-an-official-apology/ |title=After 67 Years, Alabama Lawmakers Apologize to Woman |date=April 21, 2011 |website=[[Civil Rights and Restorative Justice Project]] |access-date=January 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A joint resolution was adopted by the Alabama legislature on April 21, 2011, stating:

State Representative [[Dexter Grimsley]], along with Abbeville Mayor Ryan Blalock and Henry County Probate Judge JoAnn Smith, also apologized to Taylor for her treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.al.com/wire/2011/03/abbeville_mayor_apologizes_for.html|title=Abbeville mayor apologizes for 1944 rape of black woman by white men|work=AL.com|access-date=January 8, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor received the apologies on Mother's Day in 2011, when she visited Rock Hill Holiness Church in Abbeville, the very church where she worshipped the night of the crime.

In describing Taylor later in life, McGuire said "She was funny, witty. She was a churchgoer. She loved going to church, she loved to sing. She was very welcoming . . ."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/01/08/576566358/how-recy-taylor-spoke-out-against-her-rape-decades-before-metoo |title=How Recy Taylor Spoke Out Against Her Rape, Decades Before #MeToo |last=Davis |first=Wynne |work=National Public Radio |access-date=January 9, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rosa Luxemburg Foundation''' ({{lang-de|Rosa-Luxemburg-Stiftung}}) named in recognition of [[Rosa Luxemburg]], occasionally referred to as ''Rosa-Lux'', is a transnational alternative policy group and educational institution, centered in [[Germany]] and affiliated to the democratic socialist [[Left Party (Germany)| Left Party]]. The foundation, which was established in [[Berlin]] in 1990 (originally as the "Social Analysis and Political Education Association").&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, William. 2014.  “Alternative Policy Groups and Transnational Counter-Hegemonic Struggle.” Pp. 259-84 in Yıldız Atasoy (ed.) Global Economic Crisis and the Politics of Diversity. London &amp; New York: Palgrave MacMillan&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals and Activities==
RosaLux’s mission is to engage productively with what it sees as a diverse, pluralistic and transnational 'political left’, and to help develop its transformative capacities.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, William. 2014.  “Alternative Policy Groups and Transnational Counter-Hegemonic Struggle.” Pp. 259-84 in Yıldız Atasoy (ed.) Global Economic Crisis and the Politics of Diversity. London &amp; New York: Palgrave MacMillan&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, the foundation's activities consists of two main tracks: general political education and academic/scientific work. 

Through the '''Institute for Critical Social Analysis''', RosaLux delivers critical research on neoliberal capitalism, produces analytic work on political strategy, policy and democratic socialist alternatives, as well as work addressing injustices pertaining to gender, sexuality, race and nation.&lt;ref&gt;.http://rosalux.de/english/foundation/research-projects.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the '''Academy for Political Education,''' the foundation offers extensive programs of political education in the form of public conferences, seminars and workshops, and provides courses for youth and adult learners on topics including economic literacy, gender inequalities, sustainable development and political communication. It engages social movements directly and through media such as its website, public events and through the production of informational materials such as pamphlets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rosalux.de/english/foundation/political-education.html&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Further, through the '''Centre for International Dialogue and Cooperation''', it engages and supports social movement groups and organizations in Latin America, Africa, Asia, Europe and North America in the form of funding, as well as through seminars and conferences that are organized with local partners.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rosalux.de/english/worldwide.html&lt;/ref&gt;

While the foundation is centered in Germany, its transnational presence and reach is extensive, with 16 foreign offices supporting activities in more than 25 countries.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, William. 2014.  “Alternative Policy Groups and Transnational Counter-Hegemonic Struggle.” Pp. 259-84 in Yıldız Atasoy (ed.) Global Economic Crisis and the Politics of Diversity. London &amp; New York: Palgrave MacMillan&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In September 2014, the Rosa Luxemburg Foundation and the Center for Development Studies at [[Birzeit University]] organized a conference entitled, "Alternatives to Neo-Liberal Development in the Occupied Palestinian Territories – Critical Perspectives",&lt;ref name=RLF&gt;{{cite web|title=Alternatives to Neo-Liberal Development in the Occupied Palestinian Territories – Critical Perspectives|url=https://www.facebook.com/rlfpal/posts/902387746456825|publisher=September 16 2014 at 5:26am|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] Israeli Haaretz journalist [[Amira Hass]] was asked by two Birzeit lecturers to leave on account of a rule against the presence of Israelis (which she judged to mean Israeli Jews).&lt;ref name=Hass-Birzeit&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hass|first1=Amira|title=When a Haaretz journalist was asked to leave a Palestinian university|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/features/.premium-1.618007|accessdate=28 September 2014|publisher=haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said that she had attended the university many times and had never heard of such a rule.&lt;ref name=Hass-Birzeit/&gt; The international conference's organizers were offended. The regional head of the Rosa Luxembourg Foundation Katja Hermann stated after the incident that she would not have agreed to hold the conference at Birzeit if she was aware of the policy.&lt;ref name=Hass-Birzeit/&gt; The university later issued a statement that "The administration has nothing against the presence of the journalist Hass. The university as a national institution differentiates between friends and enemies of the Palestinian people…and works with every person or institution that is against the occupation."&lt;ref name=Hass-Birzeit/&gt; In a previous incident, Israeli anti-Zionist historian [[Ilan Pappé]] had been invited to deliver a lecture at Birzeit which was held off-campus, as not to infringe with the alleged ban on Israeli Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.algemeiner.com/2014/09/29/left-wing-israeli-journalist-justifies-her-own-exclusion-by-palestinians/ Left-Wing Israeli Journalist Justifies Her Own Exclusion by Palestinians, September 29, 2014] [[Algemeiner Journal]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7840">'''S. Walter Poulshock''' (died 1997) was an American historian and psychotherapist. As a young assistant professor at [[Rutgers University]], he resigned his position after it was discovered that his 1965 book ''The Two Parties and the Tariff in the 1880s'' among other work was based on fabricated quotes.

Poulshock subsequently retrained as a psychotherapist, and practiced in this field, dying in 1997. The case has been described as one of the most notable examples of [[academic fraud]] in American historical research prior to the more widely publicised ''[[Arming America]]'' case.

==Career as historian==
Poulshock studied for a PhD at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], specialising in politics of the 1880s, and graduated in 1962.&lt;ref name="Pennsylvania History"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Poulshock|first1=S. Walter|title=Pennsylvania and the Politics of the Tariff, 1880-1888|journal=Pennsylvania History|date=1962|volume=29|issue=3|url=https://journals.psu.edu/phj/article/view/22887|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then adapted his thesis into a book, published by [[Syracuse University Press]].&lt;ref name=Book&gt;{{cite book|last1=Poulshock|first1=S. Walter|title=The two parties and the tariff in the 1880s|date=1965|publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]]|url=https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/114433|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poulshock received an appointment as an assistant professor at Rutgers and the book initially received some favourable attention.&lt;ref name="Sternstein 02"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sternstein|first1=Jerome|title=Historical Fraud and the Seduction of Ideas: The Poulshock Case|url=http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/568|website=History News Network|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arbagi&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arbagi|first1=Martin|title=News from Old Friends (in RSAS Graduate Newsletter, 2015)|url=http://history.rutgers.edu/docman-docs/newsletters/1315-2015-graduate-newsletter/file|publisher=[[Rutgers University]]|accessdate=5 January 2016|quote=Many of the first generation [of PhD students] also remember the Poulshock scandal...Professor Poulshock was fired immediately. (At least one faculty member, we heard through the rumor mill, wanted him to stay on to the end of the semester so he could leave quietly during the summer, but that proposal was overridden.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, reviewer Jerome L. Sternstein (who wrote two articles on the case in 2002) and others came to realise that many quotes were from letters that did not exist. In addition, it emerged that Poulshock had never been to a department of the Library of Congress where he claimed to have carried out much of his research.&lt;ref name="Sternstein 02" /&gt;

Poulshock was reportedly challenged by a meeting of Rutgers faculty, where he confessed and agreed to leave.&lt;ref name="Sternstein 02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Arbagi /&gt;&lt;ref name=Yusem /&gt;

==Aftermath==
The book was initially withdrawn under the justification of 'technical issues'. A rush of buying copies took place as historians aware of the real facts sought to quickly buy copies for their own examination or as souvenirs before the book was withdrawn.&lt;ref name="Sternstein 02" /&gt;

The University of Pennsylvania declined to provide a comment on the topic to its [[The Daily Pennsylvanian|student newspaper]], leading the paper to publish both a news article and an opinion piece in April 1966 on the topic in protest.&lt;ref name=Yusem&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yusem|first1=Liz|title=Honor in the Ivory Tower?|url=http://dparchives.library.upenn.edu/cgi-bin/pennsylvania?a=d&amp;d=tdp19660419-01.2.19|accessdate=5 January 2016|work=[[The Daily Pennsylvanian]]|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]|date=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Explanation Needed"&gt;{{cite news|title=Explanation Needed (editorial)|url=http://dparchives.library.upenn.edu/cgi-bin/pennsylvania?a=d&amp;d=tdp19660419-01.2.15&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------|accessdate=5 January 2016|work=[[The Daily Pennsylvanian]]|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|date=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1966 the ''[[American Historical Review]]'' stated that the book was based "confessedly in part upon evidence which does not exist, has been withdrawn as far as possible from circulation, and anyone attempting to use it should be advised of this."&lt;ref name=Critics&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sternstein|first1=Jerome|title=Are Michael Bellesiles’s Critics Afraid to Say What They Really Think?|date=2002|publisher=History News Network|url=http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/667|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Historical News 1966"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Historical News |journal=The American Historical Review |date=July 1966 |doi=10.1086/ahr/71.4.1536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sternstein wrote in 2002 that he was concerned that the case had not been sufficiently publicised, meaning that Poulshock's work continued to be cited by historians unaware that it was fraudulent, and it had never been removed from the shelves of many university libraries. This concern has also been raised since.&lt;ref name="Sternstein 02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Luker&gt;{{cite web|last1=Luker|first1=Ralph|title=The Year When We Got Caught|url=http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/1184|website=History News Network|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, his book and thesis have continued to be occasionally cited, as recently as 2013.&lt;ref name=Margolies&gt;{{cite book|last1=Margolies|first1=Daniel S.|title=Henry Watterson and the new South the politics of empire, free trade, and globalization|date=2006|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|location=Lexington, Ky.|isbn=9780813138527|page=317|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hTk7xGOP66wC&amp;pg=PA317|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Farrar-Myers&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farrar-Myers|first1=Victoria A.|title=Scripted for change: the institutionalization of the American presidency|date=2007|publisher=Texas A &amp; M University Press|location=College Station|isbn=9781603444637|page=252|edition=1st |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pW9ojP-HMbYC&amp;pg=PT271|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sachsman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sachsman|first1=David|last2=Bulla|first2=David|title=Sensationalism murder, mayhem, mudslinging, scandals, and disasters in|date=2013|publisher=Transaction|location=[S.l.]|isbn=9781412851138|page=144|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_RduAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA144|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Skocpol&gt;{{cite book|last1=Skocpol|first1=Theda|title=Protecting soldiers and mothers the political origins of social policy in the United States|date=1995|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780674043725|page=581 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LHTHNalul5IC&amp;pg=PA581|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dehler2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gregory J.

[[File:School-marking.JPG|thumb|right|300px|These school road markings outside [[Barking Abbey School]] in Barking show that parking during term time is illegal]]
The '''school run''' is a modern [[United Kingdom|British]] phenomenon resulting from [[parent]]s taking their [[child]]ren to [[school]] by [[automobile|car]]. Many parents park their cars in school parking lots and driveways to drop off and pick up their children at the appropriate times.

== Background ==
In the past it was normal for children to walk to school, either on their own, with friends, or accompanied by an adult. Walking to school has fallen from 61% of primary school pupils in 1992/4 to 50% in 2004.&lt;ref name=DFT_National_Travel_Survey&gt;{{cite web|title=Key points from national travel survey 2004|publisher=Department for Transport|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/personal/mainresults/nts2004/keypointsandnewinformation?version=1|accessdate=2007-03-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206083753/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/personal/mainresults/nts2004/keypointsandnewinformation?version=1|archivedate=6 February 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In recent years walking to school has become less common as more and more students are dropped off at school by parents using cars, sometimes in a [[carpool|rota]] with other parents.

The reasons for this are manifold. Firstly, in many cases both parents work and do not have time to walk their children to school, and do not know any other parents who have the time either. Secondly, even if the children are old enough to walk on their own (or cycle), most parents are worried that something may happen to them, e.g. [[Kidnapping|abduction]], [[car accident]]s, etc. Often there is no convenient bus service, and the distance is too far for walking, thus forcing the school run.

The risk of children being run over near their schools is much higher than in the past due to all the parents driving their own children to school and parking in unsafe places near the school gates. It is not unusual to see drivers parking their cars in bus stops, on pedestrian crossings or facing the wrong way, with children getting in or out of the car.

The fear that something may happen to the children has perhaps more to do with media coverage of isolated cases than any real threat.

== Problems arising from 'the school run' ==

Some schools now have a 20&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit operating when the children are about, though traffic congestion often necessitates a lower speed.

With the increase in a choice of schools for parents, children may have to travel further and are more likely to require a bus or car ride.

It is claimed that the school run is responsible for a large amount of the traffic problems in the morning [[rush hour]]. 

The decreasing amount of [[exercise]] and associated increase in [[obesity]] are also partly blamed on the school run.

To combat the issue of exercise, or lack thereof, many schools have started employing programs and techniques to encourage children to walk to school, whilst mitigating the possible dangers of walking to school. An example of one of these programs is the 'walking school bus' whereby children at selected schools can elect to travel within an organised group of school children and volunteer parents.&lt;ref name="Walking School Bus"&gt;{{cite web|title=Walking School Bus|publisher=US Department of Transport/Walking School Bus Organisation|url=http://www.walkingschoolbus.org/|accessdate=2008-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The school run has become a popular target for some politicians and campaigners against the use of cars for journeys which could be better walked or cycled. One of the campaigns promoting this alternative is the [[walk to school campaign]].

==Early life and education==
{{expand section|date= April 2017}}
Atran was born in [[New York City]] in 1952.

While a student, he became assistant to anthropologist [[Margaret Mead]] at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. He received his BA from [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia College]], MA from [[Johns Hopkins University]], and PhD in [[anthropology]] from [[Columbia University]].

==Career==
Atran has taught at Cambridge University, [[Hebrew University]] in [[Jerusalem]], the [[École des Hautes Études]] and [[École Polytechnique]] in Paris, and [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice]] in New York City. He is a research director in anthropology at the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]] and member of the [[Jean Nicod Institute]] at the [[École Normale Supérieure]]. He is also research professor of [[public policy]] and [[psychology]] at the [[University of Michigan]], founding fellow of the Centre for the Resolution of Intractable Conflict at [[Oxford University]], and cofounder of ARTIS International.

===Early years===
In 1974 he originated a debate at the Abbaye de Royaumont in France on the nature of universals in human thought and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editor-first= Lawrence |editor-last= Kritzman| title= The Columbia History of Twentieth-Century French Thought| place= New York| publisher= Columbia University Press| year= 2006| pages= 179–180| isbn= 978-0-231-10791-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other participants included linguist [[Noam Chomsky]], psychologist [[Jean Piaget]], anthropologists [[Gregory Bateson]] and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last= Kwong |first= Emily |url=  http://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/columbia?a=d&amp;d=cs20091117-01.2.6 |title=Columbia antro dept. remembers Claude Lévi-Strauss |publisher=Columbia Spectator |date=November 17, 2009 |accessdate=July 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and biologists [[François Jacob]] and [[Jacques Monod]], which Harvard's [[Howard Gardner]] and others consider a milestone in the development of cognitive science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Harold| last= Gardner| chapter= Encounter at Royaumont| title=Art, Mind, and Brain: A Cognitive Approach to Creativity| place= New York| publisher= Basic Books| year= 1982| pages= 16–26| isbn= 978-0-465-00444-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atran has also been a staunch opponent of political attempts to eliminate government funding for social science, arguing that it is critical to the national interest, including innovation and security in business, technology, medicine and defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/03/15/social_warfare_budget_republicans |title=Social Warfare |work=Foreign Policy |date=March 15, 2013 |accessdate=March 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has collaborated on research on how political negotiations could be made more likely to produce agreement. Atran and the psychologists [[Jeremy Ginges]] and [[Douglas Medin]] and political scientist [[Khalil Shikaki]] conducted an experiment that surveyed "600 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, more than 500 Palestinian refugees, and more than 700 Palestinian students, half of whom identified with Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad."&lt;ref name="sacred bounds"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Jeremy |last1=Ginges |first2=Scott |last2=Atran |first3=Douglas |last3=Medin |first4=Khalil |last4= Shikaki |title=Sacred bounds on rational resolution of violent political conflict |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |year=2007 |volume=104 |issue=18 |pages=7357–60 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0701768104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pinker Angels"&gt;{{cite book| first= Steven| last= Pinker| title= The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined| publisher= Viking Press| year= 2011| isbn= 978-0-670-02295-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|638}} The researchers divided the subjects into three groups, each of which was presented with a different "hypothetical peace deal." In the basic situation, those surveyed were presented with "a two-state solution in which the Israelis would withdraw from 99 percent of the West Bank and Gaza but would not have to absorb Palestinian refugees"; the proposal "did not go over well."&lt;ref name="Pinker Angels" /&gt;{{rp|638}} For the second group, the hypothetical deal "was sweetened with cash compensation from the United States and the European Union, such as a billion dollars a year for a hundred years, or a guarantee that the people would live in peace and prosperity. With these sweeteners on the table, the nonabsolutists, as expected, softened their opposition a bit. But the absolutists, forced to contemplate a taboo tradeoff, were even more disgusted, angry, and prepared to resort to violence."&lt;ref name="Pinker Angels" /&gt;{{rp|638–39}} But for the third group, the proposed two-state solution was "augmented with a purely symbolic declaration by the enemy in which it compromised on one of its sacred values."

In the deal presented to Israeli settlers, the Palestinians "would give up any claims to their right of return" or "would be required to recognize the historic and legitimate right of the Jewish people to Eretz Israel";&lt;ref name="Pinker Angels" /&gt;{{rp|639}} in that presented to the Palestinians, Israel "would recognize the historic and legitimate right of the Palestinians to their own state and would apologize for all wrongs done to the Palestinian people," or would "give up what they believe is their sacred right to the West Bank" or would "symbolically recognize the historic legitimacy of the right of return [without in fact granting it]".&lt;ref name="sacred bounds" /&gt; In summarizing the result, cognitive psychologist [[Steven Pinker]] claims, "Unlike the bribes of money or peace, the symbolic concession of a sacred value by the enemy, especially when it acknowledges a sacred value on one's own side, reduced the absolutists' anger, disgust, and willingness to endorse violence."&lt;ref name="Pinker Angels" /&gt;{{rp|639}}

In a study of Middle East leaders published in [[Science (journal)]], Atran interviewed leaders, as distinct from popular views. In the earlier responses, people rejected material concessions without symbolic concessions, but were open to negotiations that started with symbolic concessions. Leaders responded the same way, except that they saw the symbolic concession as only an introduction to significant material concessions as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Atran |first=Scott |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/317/5841/1039 |title=Sacred Barriers to Conflict Resolution |work=American Association for the Advancement of Science |date=August 24, 2007 |accessdate=January 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, when the researchers asked [[Musa Abu Marzouk]], deputy chairman of Hamas, about a trade-off for peace without granting a right of return, he said “No.” When he was offered a trade-off with a substantial material incentive, he said “No” even more emphatically; “we do not sell ourselves for any amount.” But when he was offered an apology, he said “Yes,” although an apology would only be a beginning. “Our houses and land were taken away from us and something has to be done about that.”

Similarly, when the researchers asked [[Binyamin Netanyahu]] (then opposition leader), “Would you seriously consider accepting a two-state solution following the 1967 borders if all major Palestinian factions, including Hamas, were to recognize the right of the Jewish people to an independent state in the region?” he said, “Yes, but the Palestinians would have to show that they sincerely mean it, change their textbooks and anti-Semitic characterizations and then allow some border adjustments so that Ben Gurion [Airport] would be out of range of shoulder-fired missiles.”

====Field research on terrorism====
His work on the ideology and social evolution of transnational terrorism, which has included fieldwork with [[mujahedin]] and supporters in Europe, the Middle East, Central and Southeast Asia, and North Africa, has challenged common assumptions. Cognitive psychologist [[Steven Pinker]] summarizes some of Atran's findings thus: 
{{quote|Far from being ignorant, impoverished, nihilistic, or mentally ill, suicide terrorists tend to be educated, middle class, morally engaged, and free of obvious psychopathology. Atran concluded that many of the motives may be found in nepotistic altruism... [Atran shows that] [[Hamas]] and other Palestinian terrorist groups [hold] out a carrot rather than a stick to the terrorist's family in the form of generous monthly stipends, lump-sum payments, and massive prestige in the community.... Atran has [also] found that suicide terrorists can be recruited without these direct incentives. Probably the most effective call to martyrdom is the opportunity to join a happy band of brothers. Terrorist cells often begin as gangs of underemployed single young men who come together in cafes, dorms, soccer clubs, barbershops, or Internet chat rooms and suddenly find meaning in their lives by a commitment to the new platoon.... Commitment to the group is intensified by religion, not just the literal promise of paradise but the feeling of spiritual awe that comes from submerging oneself in a crusade, a calling, a vision quest, or a jihad. [Atran writes that religion] may also turn a commitment to a cause into a sacred value — a good that may not be traded off against something else, including life itself. The commitment can be further stoked by the thirst for revenge, which in the case of militant Islamism takes the form of vengeance for the harm and humiliation suffered by any Muslim anywhere on the planet at any time in history, or for symbolic affronts such as the presence of infidel soldiers on sacred Muslim soil.&lt;ref name="Pinker Angels" /&gt;{{rp|356–57}} }}

Atran has summarized his work and conclusions: 
{{quote|When you look at young people like the ones who grew up to blow up trains in Madrid in 2004, carried out the slaughter on the London underground in 2005, hoped to blast airliners out of the sky en route to the United States in 2006 and 2009, and journeyed far to die killing infidels in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen or Somalia; when you look at whom they idolize, how they organize, what bonds them and what drives them; then you see that what inspires the most lethal terrorists in the world today is not so much the Koran or religious teachings as a thrilling cause and call to action that promises glory and esteem in the eyes of friends, and through friends, eternal respect and remembrance in the wider world that they will never live to enjoy.... Jihad is an egalitarian, equal-opportunity employer: ...fraternal, fast-breaking, thrilling, glorious, and cool.| Scott Atran, Testimony before U.S. Senate&lt;ref name="Pinker Angels" /&gt;{{rp|357–58}} }}

Regarding Atran's analysis of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] as a revolutionary movement of "world-historic proportions,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Atran |first=Scott |url=https://aeon.co/essays/why-isis-has-the-potential-to-be-a-world-altering-revolution |title=ISIS is a Revolution |work=AEON |date=December 15, 2016 |accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Atran |first=Scott |url=https://instagloss.com/read/tempsreel.nouvelobs.com-monde-20160129.obs3681-l-etat-islamique-est-une-revolution-par-scott-atran.html |title=L'Etat islamique est une révolution, par Scott Atran |work=L'OBS |language= French| date=February 2, 2016 |accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a writer for ''The New York Times'' considers Atran: 
{{quote|...a top anthropologist in Paris [who has combined] his research among disaffected youth with insights from such disparate figures as Hitler, Burke, Darwin and Hobbes, as well as close observation of the Islamic State’s advance into a 'globe-spanning jihadi archipelago'. He argues that we dismiss ISIS at our peril, and that in fact, we do much to promote its growth. Some of his historical conclusions will be controversial, but this is French intellectualism at its most profound — and most useful. Here’s a telling anecdote: When [[Charlie Chaplin]] and the French filmmaker [[René Clair]] watched '[[Triumph of the Will]]' (1935), [[Leni Riefenstahl]]’s visual paean to National Socialism, 'Chaplin laughed but Clair was terror-stricken, fearing that, if it were shown more widely, all might be lost in the West'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nordland |first=Ron |url= http://news.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/what-were-reading-120/ |title=The Allure of ISIS |work=The New York Times  |date=January 12, 2016 |accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] accompanied Atran to frontlines in the battle against ISIS in Iraq, where he and his research team were assessing "will to fight" among the combatants: 
{{quote|Atran  fleshes out what he calls the 'Devoted Actor Framework' [as opposed to standard 'rational actor' frameworks], which pulls sacred values [which are immune to material trade offs] and identity fusion [complete merging of individual identity with group identity] into a single theory and offers advice for beating ISIS: 'The science suggests that sacred values are best opposed with other sacred values that inspire devotion, or by sundering the fused social networks that embed those values.' Left unspoken: How do you offer an equally inspiring alternative? By what method can those social networks be sundered? Atran doesn’t pretend to know the answer, but he does think that current attempts at so-called "countermessaging" are destined to fail because those messages are 'disembodied from the social networks in which ideas are embedded and given life.' Scholarly squabbles aside, there is near-universal admiration, bordering on awe, for how Atran is able to collect data in the midst of a violent conflict."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bartlett |first=Tom |url=http://chronicle.com/article/The-Scientist-Who-Talks-to/236521 |title=The Road to ISIS: An unorthodox anthropologist goes face to face with ISIS.

A series of experimental studies directed by Atran and social psychologist Ángel Gómez&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0193-3 |title=The devoted actor’s will to fight and the spiritual dimension of human conflict |journal=Nature Human Behaviour |year=2017 |volume=1 |doi=10.1038/s41562-017-0193-3 |pages=673–679 | last1 = Gómez | first1 = Ángel | last2 = López-Rodríguez | first2 = Lucía | last3 = Sheikh | first3 = Hammad | last4 = Ginges | first4 = Jeremy | last5 = Wilson | first5 = Lydia | last6 = Waziri | first6 = Hoshang | last7 = Vázquez | first7 = Alexandra | last8 = Davis | first8 = Richard | last9 = Atran | first9 = Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt; performed with captured ISIS fighters, fighters of the Kurdistan Workers Party ([[PKK]]), [[Peshmerga]], Iraq Army and Arab Sunni Militia in Iraq, as well as with thousands of ordinary European citizens, have further elaborated the Devoted Actor framework in an effort to “help to inform policy decisions for the common defense.” According to reporting from ''CNN'':
{{quote|The researchers discovered that three crucial factors motivate both ISIS fighters and those fighting them: a deep commitment to sacred values, the readiness to forsake family for those values, and the perceived spiritual strength of the group or community that the fighter represents. [But] 'in our material world, we have underestimated or underplayed the spiritual dimension of human action,' [Atran] said. 'Doing so runs the risk of leaving ourselves open to people who are motivated by deeper spiritual and sacred values and virtues, and I think that's the greatest danger we face.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Howard |first=Jacqueline |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/04/health/isis-fighters-human-behavior-study/index.html |title=What motivates ISIS fighters -- and those who fight against them |work=CNN  |date=September 4, 2017 |accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Atran argues in an interview in ''The Washington Post'' that: "Never in history have so few people with so few means caused so much fear."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gebelhoff |first=Robert |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2017/02/03/rethinking-the-war-on-terror-with-the-help-of-science/ |title=Rethinking the war on terrorism, with the help of science |work=The Washington Post  |date=February 3, 2017 |accessdate=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his research colleagues at ARTIS International contend that: 
{{quote|Despite intense efforts by intelligence agencies and countless conferences, articles, and books, fundamental aspects of terrorism remain unclear: What identifies terrorists before they act; how do they radicalize; what motivates their violence; when do they act; what countermeasures are most effective? These efforts to find answers have fallen short in part because... policymakers tend to fit such information to prevailing paradigms in foreign policy, military doctrine, and criminal justice, each with serious drawbacks when applied to terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6323/352 |title=Challenges in researching terrorism from the field | first1= Scott| last1= Atran| first2= Robert| last2= Axelrod| first3= Richard| last3= Davis| first4= Baruch| last4= Fischhoff |work=Science |date=January 27, 2017 |accessdate=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Atran and colleagues propose an alternative approach, driven by theoretically-framed field research that ground-truths big data and informs policy-making while maintaining intellectual independence. In 2017, Atran co-authored a groundbreaking paper with Angel Gomez, Lucia Lopez-Rodriguez, Hammad Sheikh, Jeremy Ginges, Lydia Wilson, Hoshang Waziri, Alexandra Vazquez, and Richard Davis. Titled 'The Devoted Actor's Will to Fight and the Spiritual Dimension of Human Conflict',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gómez|first=Ángel|last2=López-Rodríguez|first2=Lucía|last3=Sheikh|first3=Hammad|last4=Ginges|first4=Jeremy|last5=Wilson|first5=Lydia|last6=Waziri|first6=Hoshang|last7=Vázquez|first7=Alexandra|last8=Davis|first8=Richard|last9=Atran|first9=Scott|date=September 2017|title=The devoted actor’s will to fight and the spiritual dimension of human conflict|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0193-3|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|language=En|volume=1|issue=9|pages=673–679|doi=10.1038/s41562-017-0193-3|issn=2397-3374}}&lt;/ref&gt; the piece focuses on the spiritual dimensions of conflict based upon field work in Iraq with combatants and lab studies, assessing non-utilitarian dimensions of conflict.

[[File:The+Starehe+Lion+Crest.jpg|thumb|Logo]]
'''Starehe Boys' Centre and School''' (popularly known as "Starehe") is a partial-board,
boys-only school in [[Nairobi]], Kenya. The school was founded in 1959 by Dr. [[Geoffrey William Griffin]], [[State Commendations of Kenya|MBS]], [[OBE]], Geoffrey Gatama Geturo and Joseph Kamiru Gikubu.&lt;ref&gt;Anthem of Bugles: The story of Starehe Boys Centre and School by Roger Martin&lt;/ref&gt; It started as a rescue centre. Starehe and Brookhouse School are the only African schools south of the [[Sahara]] and north of the [[Limpopo]] distinguished as [[Round Square]] members.

==Status==
Starehe Boys' Centre and School educates at least 70% of its students free, and the rest at a reduced rate. This stems from its founding charter as a charitable school. School fees are paid on a means-tested basis, with substantial subsidies paid by the school, so that students from all walks of life are able to have a public school education that would otherwise be beyond their means.

The entrance process uses results from the national [[KCPE]] exams and prefers to award school places to those who show academic potential.

The school is governed by a Managing Committee chaired by Jimmy Mugerwa, Country Chairman of Kenya [[Shell and BP]], the school's main sponsors since its inception.

===Admissions===
Admission of students is by open competitive examination. Each year about 20,000 applications are received; only 250 are selected to join the student body and about 6 places are left for very needy situations where the applicant might not have found a chance to apply but is still merited.

Candidates are judged according to need and parental income and their performance in the national [[KCPE]] examinations. Selection is solely on merit.

==History==
Starehe Boys' Centre was the result of the vision of [[Geoffrey William Griffin]], assisted by [[Joseph Kamiru Gikubu|Joseph Gikubu]], and [[Geoffrey Gatama Geturo|Geoffrey Geturo]]. Its genesis was the earlier [[State of Emergency]] declared by the Governor of Colonial Kenya during the 1952 [[Mau Mau Uprising]] and the resultant overflow on to the streets of poor and destitute Mau Mau orphans.

The first 17 boys entered the school from [[Kariokor]] Rescue Centre, [[Nairobi]], and it was established in two tin huts donated by Kenya [[Shell and BP]] in 1959. After a few months it moved to its current location at [[Starehe]], Nairobi.

The name "Starehe" is Swahili for 'Tranquility', 'Peace', or 'Comfort', signifying a place where orphaned boys could find solace in its humble beginnings. It is also the name of the place in which the institution is situated.

The school is a member of the international [[Round Square (educational organisation)|Round Square]] school organisation, offering education to children from diverse backgrounds, many of whom are poor.

==Traditions==
The [[school uniform]] is blue [[short trousers]] and red shirt, worn with a black tie and [[blazer]] or wind-breaker.

Links with the country and the community are maintained, with a monthly vacation spent in voluntary service to the community, either in hospitals, clinics, dispensaries or government offices, or any other institution that the students deem fit. This is referred to as the Voluntary Service Scheme, and is a way of giving back to society.

Starehe hosts an annual football grudge match against [[Lenana School]] immediately before Founders' Day Dinner.

==Accommodation==
Students take 'githeri' (mixture of beans and maize), a staple of the school since its inception.Starehe's education places emphasis on academic excellence as well as duty and discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Teaching Beyond Teaching: Dr. Geoffrey William Griffin and Starehe Boys Centre and School&amp;nbsp;– by Peter Otiato Ojiambo&lt;/ref&gt; An inscription at the Assembly Hall entrance reads "the path of Duty is the way to Glory".

Students perform daily duties that include cleaning their dormitories and the school compound as well as classes and laboratories. These duties are assigned and supervised by the prefects.

==Discipline==
Starehe follows a rank-based prefect system. A student may become a prefect from the second year at the school but never are full prefects. They only bear the rank of sub-prefect and are so confirmed during assembly where the Director announces their promotion. Promotion through the ranks is assessed by School Prefects (normally referred to as House Captains), who form the Cabinet of the School. Any potential prefect is vetted by the Cabinet, which consists of the School Prefects, the School Captains and the Director.

Commoners are divided according to year. Those in Form One and Two are Junior Boys, Form Three and Four are Senior boys.

When [[School corporal punishment|corporal punishment]] was legal in Kenya, only the Director was allowed to use the [[caning|cane]] at Starehe. This was so that he kept abreast of all serious offences in the school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpun.com/kes00008.htm#6029 "Rising Student Unrest Blamed On Poor Managers"], ''Daily Nation'', Nairobi, 7 August 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Griffin took issue with the government's ban on caning, saying the government was bowing to international pressure and that little thought had been given to the implications. It would lead to an escalation in indiscipline and a decline in educational standards, he said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpun.com/kes00107.htm "Caning Ban Debate Rages On"], ''Daily Nation'', Nairobi, 4 July 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3593">'''''TerraNova''''' is a series of [[standardized test|standardized]] [[achievement test]]s used in the [[United States]] designed to assess [[K-12]] student achievement in reading, language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, vocabulary, spelling, and other areas.&lt;ref name="IDEA"&gt;[http://www.intidea.org/handbook/testing.htm TerraNova] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20040421133728/http://www.intidea.org/handbook/testing.htm |date=2004-04-21 }} testing information&lt;/ref&gt; 

The test series is published by [[CTB/McGraw-Hill]]. On June 30, 2015 [[McGraw-Hill Education]] announced that Data Recognition Corporation (DRC) had agreed to acquire "key assets" of the [[CTB/McGraw-Hill]] assessment business.&lt;ref name="Data Recognition Corporation (DRC) Announces Agreement To Acquire Key Assets of the CTB Assessment Business of McGraw-Hill Education"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/data-recognition-corporation-drc-announces-agreement-to-acquire-key-assets-of-the-ctb-assessment-business-of-mcgraw-hill-education-300106912.html/|title= Data Recognition Corporation (DRC) Announces Agreement To Acquire Key Assets of the CTB Assessment Business of McGraw-Hill Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''TerraNova'' was created with an update in 1996 CTB to the California Achievement Tests and the California Tests of Basic Skills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctb.com/ctb.com/control/ctbLandingPageViewAction?landngPageId=25190#TerraNova] CTB History&lt;/ref&gt;

''TerraNova'' are used by many [[Department of Defense Dependents Schools]]. The state of [[California]] used the test as part of the ''CAT/6'' or ''[[California Achievement Levels Test|California Achievement Tests]], 6th edition'' as part of the statewide [[Standardized Testing and Reporting|STAR]] testing program, though only in certain grades. The CAT series of tests have been available for quite some time and before many US states began developing their own standards-based tests as part of an overall testing movement in the United States, which began in the early 2000s. The CAT were also widely used outside of California to assess student achievement.

''TerraNova'' are used widely throughout the nation, including [[Pennsylvania]].

==Tests==
The tests are usually multiple choice and answered with bubble sheets. Many take fifteen minutes to few hours, and the tests sometimes extend to over one day. Fifth grade and above include short answers. The results are nationally [[norm-referenced]], meaning that students' scores reflect their achievement in comparison to all students who took the test nationally. Typically this is expressed as a raw score that is then converted into a percentile ranking. This is different from [[criterion-referenced test]]s, which measure student performance based on mastery of the material.

In 2015, CTB released ''TerraNova 3'' Online. The online administered test includes a full battery of constructed-response and selected-response test items provides detailed diagnostic information on students' basic and applied skills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctb.com/ctb.com/control/ctbProductViewAction?p=products&amp;productFamilyId=449&amp;productId=66434] ''TerraNova 3'' Online&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University Child Development Center''' (UCDC) at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] is a [[child care]] and early childhood education center located on Clyde Street in [[Shadyside (Pittsburgh)|Shadyside]] just east of the main [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland]] campus approximately one half mile from the center of campus at the [[Cathedral of Learning]] and adjacent to the rear property of the [[Chancellor's Residence (University of Pittsburgh)|University's Chancellor's Residence]] on the Oakland-Shadyside border in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].

The University acquired the building, the former [[First Church of Christ, Scientist (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)|First Church of Christ, Scientist]], in the fall of 1992 for $1.015 million.  In 1994, the Pitt proceeded with a $2 million renovation of the building to accommodate the UCDC which opened its doors in the facility on May 30, 1995 after having previously been located in [[Bellefield Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mac10.umc.pitt.edu/u/FMPro?-db=ustory.fp5&amp;-format=d.html&amp;-lay=a&amp;-sortfield=issueid%3a%3aissuedate&amp;-sortorder=descend&amp;keywords=%22child%20development%20center%22&amp;-max=50&amp;-recid=37483&amp;-find= University Times, Some campus construction, renovation projects completed, Sept. 15, 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mac10.umc.pitt.edu/u/FMPro?-db=ustory.fp5&amp;-format=d.html&amp;-lay=a&amp;-sortfield=issueid%3a%3aissuedate&amp;-sortorder=descend&amp;keywords=%22child%20development%20center%22&amp;-max=50&amp;-recid=37816&amp;-find= University Times, Moving!, May 25, 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]]-style building was designed by [[Solon Spencer Beman]] and built between 1904 and 1905.&lt;ref name="PHLF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wqedmultimedia.com/education/pghist/units/folks/oakland_tour03.shtml WQED Walking Tour of Oakland: Craig Street and Fifth Avenue, accessdate=2008-07-17]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 it had been designated a local historic landmark by the [[Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.phlf.org/plaques/locallist.html  | title = Internet Archive: Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation: PHLF Plaques &amp; Registries| date=2007-01-27 | accessdate = 2008-07-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070127092030/http://www.phlf.org/plaques/locallist.html |archivedate = 2007-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University Child Development Center serves as a near-site child care and early childhood education center for children ranging in age from six weeks through six years who belong to the faculty, staff, and students of the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.provost.pitt.edu/handbook/ch6_anc_ucdc.htm Provost: University Child Development Center]&lt;/ref&gt; The UCDC also provides laboratory, research, and practicum experiences in observing and participating with young children in classroom-based settings, for Pitt students, and students from other institutions of higher learning. The UCDC also provides resources and technical assistance in implementing appropriate programs and practices that serve young children in Pittsburgh and other communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hr.pitt.edu/ucdc/default.htm University of Pittsburgh - Office of Human Resources - University Child Development Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

The UCDC facility houses twelve classrooms including three infant rooms, four toddler rooms, and two three-year-old preschool rooms. Each room is designed to be age-appropriate for the group occupying the space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hr.pitt.edu/ucdc/tour1.htm UCDC Virtual Tour:page 1]&lt;/ref&gt; The UCDC also includes two large motor rooms (one for infants and toddlers and the other for preschool children) and an outdoor playground facility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hr.pitt.edu/ucdc/tour4.htm UCDC Virtual Tour: page 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Sumpter "W. S." McIntosh''' (February 2, 1921 –- March 4, 1974) was a civil rights leader from [[Dayton, Ohio]]. In 1960, McIntosh went to [[Atlanta, Georgia]] to observe the Reverend [[Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]] and on February 26, 1961, he led one of the first major [[civil rights]] protests in the Dayton, Ohio community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daytondailynews.com/n/content/oh/story/news/local/2007/02/01/ddn020207mcintosh.html DaytonDailyNews: Dayton, Ohio, news and information&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  He challenged segregation in Dayton before the [[Civil Rights Movement]] gained attention nationally. McIntosh tried negotiation first. If that didn't work, he roused blacks to push for their rights by picketing, sit-ins and boycotts.  He utilized nonviolent methods to fight for the [[rights]] of [[minorities]] to work at [[Rike Kumler Co.|Rike's]] department store, Liberal supermarket, and other establishments in the Dayton area.

McIntosh organized community groups and was the executive director of the Dayton chapter of the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE).

On March 4, 1974, McIntosh was shot in the heart and killed by Calvin Farmer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cincypost.com/news/1999/farmer111399.html|title=A killer's journey: Now he's a lawyer|first=Kimball|last=Perry|work=[[The Cincinnati Post]]|publisher=[[E.

==Recognition==
In recognition of W. S. McIntosh's heroic efforts and civic responsibility, the [[Dayton, Ohio|City of Dayton]] has named a park in his honor - W. S. McIntosh Park. Dayton community and University of Dayton leaders offered a public salute to W. S. McIntosh in June 2007 at the Dayton Cultural and RTA Center.  In conjunction with the [[University of Dayton]], they sponsor a [[scholarship]] for minority students who reside in the city of Dayton.  This scholarship, the W. S. McIntosh Memorial Leadership Award, covers tuition, fees, and room and board while the student is attending the University of Dayton for eight semesters and is awarded to one student each year.

As with [[John Locke]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/sullivanonlibertarians.html ''Are you a real libertarian, or a royal libertarian'']
’'Furthermore, Locke based his scenario on pre-monetary societies, where a landholder would find that "it was useless, as well as dishonest, to carve himself too much, or take more than he needed." With the introduction of money, Locke noted, all land quickly became appropriated. Why? Because with money, those who can take more land than they have personal use for suddenly have reason to do so, as between them they will have taken all the land, and others will have to pay rent to them. So, with the introduction of money, the Lockean rationale for landed property falls apart, even according to Locke. And while Locke did not propose a remedy specifically for to this problem, he repeatedly stated that all taxes should be on real estate.'’&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Stuart Mill]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

They grow richer, as it were in their sleep, without working, risking, or economizing. What claim have they, on the general principle of social justice, to this accession of riches?

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ogilvie is cited as an influence by reformers internationally.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wealthandwant.com/docs/Ogilvie_Essay_1782.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal authority and main published source of information&lt;ref&gt;see also Ritchie in ODNB, 2004 (whose principal source is also DC MacDonald).&lt;/ref&gt; on William Ogilvie and his life is his 19th-century biographer DC MacDonald, who says:&lt;blockquote&gt;The facts known about Ogilvie’s life are exceedingly scanty, and {{not a typo|woul|d of}} themselves be of little importance; but when considered along with the conception we form of the man as displayed on every page of his book, the smallest scrap of authentic information will in these days be of some interest, not only to “men of enlarged and inquisitive minds”, but also to readers in general. It is in the book, however, and in the book alone, that we meet face to face with the author. Ogilvie instilled his soul into it, and he left us evidence that it was the chief aim of his life. We, therefore, should as soon think of separating the man Isaiah from the Book of Isaiah, as we {{not a typo|shoul|d of}} separating the man Ogilvie from the book of Ogilvie.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;DC MacDonald's Biographical Notes, in Ogilvie 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Life==

Born in 1736, William Ogilvie was the only son of James Ogilvie of Pittensear, Morayshire, and of Marjory Steuart of Tannachy in the neighbouring county of Banff. “A born and bred patrician”,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; he was lineally descended from [[Gilla Críst of Angus|Gillecrist]], the last [[Mormaer of Angus|Maor Mor of Angus]], one of the seven provinces of [[Pict]]ish Scotland. "By birth and lineage an anti-[[Whig (British political faction)|Whig]], and, as a man, he must have despised the wirepulling Scotch Whigs of his time as 'but a pack o' traitor louns'".&lt;ref&gt;DC MacDonald's Biographical Notes (quoting Robert Burns' "'Awa' Whigs, Awa'"), in Ogilvie 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no authentic account of Ogilvie's boyhood, according to his biographer, who assumes that until he left home for College he was brought up in the diminutive mansion-house of Pittensear and attended the Grammar School in [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]], the county town and cathedral city five miles away. One dramatic incident in his childhood may have been defining:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When the so-called Royal Army was passing through Morayshire in 1746 [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland|'Butcher' Cumberland]]'s government troops on their way to the [[Battle of Culloden]], a short halt was made at Pittensear House, and three cannon shots were fired at it. One of these shots struck the front wall close to the dining-room window, and, we need not say, caused the inmates much alarm. William Ogilvie, then about ten years of age, in all probability witnessed that scene—a sad example of what even a Whig Government may do at the head of a mercenary army. He, without any doubt, surveyed the wreck after the storm had passed. We have it on the authority of old people still living near Pittensear, that his mother, who happened to be in childbed at the time, never recovered the shock of that day's proceedings, and that shortly thereafter she was laid in a premature grave. And a few years later, when his disconsolate and broken-hearted father had quitted life's stage, he was left alone, in place of both father and mother, as guardian to four orphan girls. Here we may trace the way in which, what we may call a motherly feeling towards all the children of men, was developed in his breast.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1755, at the age of nineteen, Ogilvie entered King's College, Aberdeen. On graduating in 1759 he was appointed Master of the Grammar School at [[Cullen, Moray|Cullen]], Morayshire—remaining there a year. He then attended Glasgow University in the winter session of 1760–61 and Edinburgh University the following winter. While he was at Glasgow, studying under Dr. [[Joseph Black]], the engineer inventor [[James Watt]] was demonstrating his scientific discoveries at the University and [[Adam Smith]] occupied the Chair of Moral Philosophy.

MacDonald says that between 1759 and 1762 Ogilvie was travelling tutor and companion to Alexander, [[Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon|4th Duke of Gordon]]—"during which time he probably found himself in the company of Adam Smith as travelling tutor and companion to [[Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch]]."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; But Ritchie points out that the period of travel "coincided with the commencement of Ogilvie's teaching duties and [Gordon] is known to have taken another tutor"&lt;ref name="Ritchie in ODNB, 2004"&gt;Ritchie in ODNB, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Ogilvie on '[[Grand Tour]]' would have had good opportunity to survey the broad continent of Europe and witness the condition of its people: his reformer eye would not have missed those circumstances and conditions that were to lead to the [[French Revolution]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The widow is gathering nettles for her children's dinner; a perfumed seigneur, delicately lounging in the ''Œil de Bœuf'', hath an alchemy whereby he will extract from her the third nettle, and call it rent.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald (1970, p.162) identifies his source (and quotes it in-text) incorrectly, viz.: "''Carlyle's Past and Present'', inspired by Byron, see ''Age of Bronze'' XIV. 'The grand agrarian alchemy, high rent'." Cited in DC MacDonald's Biographical Notes, in Ogilvie 1997." A correct reference would be: Carlyle, T., 1878 (?). ''The French Revolution — a history''. Copyright edition. London: Chapman and Hall. p.178.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1761 Ogilvie was appointed Assistant Professor of Philosophy in [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]], Aberdeen, and Regent&lt;ref&gt;"(A regent, from the Latin regens "reigning", is a person selected to act as head of state).... [but] [o]ccasionally, the term regent refers to positions lower than the ruler of a country.... [including] a management board for a college or university; this is commonly stated as: 'Board of Regents'" [[Regent|Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt; in 1764. The following year he exchanged offices with the Professor of Humanity, which class he taught until he retired in 1817. Ogilvie appears to have lived a somewhat reclusive life, remaining unmarried and childless. He is buried in the south transept of [[St. Machar's Cathedral|St Machar's Cathedral]] in [[Old Aberdeen]], adjacent to his college: a discreet stone in the wall describes him as "William Ogilvie, Esquire of Pittensear, in the County of Moray, and Professor of Humanity in the University and King’s College, Aberdeen, who died on the 14th February 1819, aged 83 years".&lt;ref&gt;Kirkyard of St Machar’s Cathedral, visited and inscription read by Peter Gibb, August 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; His Times obituary called him "one of the most accomplished scholars of the age".&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 23 February 1819.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Book of Ogilvie—''Birthright in Land''==

[[File:Frontispiece, William Ogilvie's (published anonymously) (1782) An Essay on the Right of Property in Land, &amp;c.pdf#file|thumb|left]]The declared object of ''An Essay on the Right of Property in Land'', according to its original title and introduction, is to show how "property in land might be rendered more beneficial to the lower ranks of mankind".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Due to what MacDonald calls the 'boycotting' of Ogilvie and his masterwork by the establishment, "the lower ranks of mankind in England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, and the British Colonies never heard that such a man lived, far less that he left them such a legacy".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
 
In his preface to the 1891 edition of Ogilvie's book, DC MacDonald elucidates Ogilvie's core message:&lt;blockquote&gt;When a child is born, we recognise that it has a natural right to its mother’s milk, and no one can deny that it has the same right to mother-earth. It is really its mother-earth, plus the dew and sunshine from heaven and a little labour, that supplies the milk and everything else required for its subsistence. The monster that would deprive a babe of its mother’s milk, or would monopolise the breasts of several mothers, to the exclusion of several children, is not more deserving of being destroyed than the monster who seizes absolute possession of more than his share of the common mother of mankind, to the exclusion of his fellow-creatures.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;DC MacDonald's Preface, in Ogilvie 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his ''Essay'' Ogilvie claims the birthright of every citizen to an equal share in the value of property in land, and outlines the practical policy means by which this would progressively be achieved. He asserts "land values as having three parts, the original, the improved, and the improvable values; the first and third of these [belong] to the community and only the second to the landholder".&lt;ref name="Ritchie in ODNB, 2004"/&gt; Fillebrown provides a considered critical analysis of Ogilvie's proposal: "The crux of the land problem, according to Ogilvie's analysis, lies in the reconciliation" of the conflict between "the claims to an equal share of land, involving right of occupancy, and the claim to more than an equal share, based on labour.... 'Rude nations have adhered to the first of these maxims, neglecting the second. Nations advanced in industry and arts have adhered to the second, neglecting the first.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Community Ground Rent', by Peter Gibb, Afterword, in Ogilvie 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; However his analysis and proposal are incomplete, says Fillebrown:&lt;blockquote&gt;"His enumeration of the moral benefits to accrue to mankind from a realisation of his fiscal ideal is a brilliant prognostication that no later and greater economic light has sufficed to dim. But Ogilvie's failure to grasp the full significance of economic rent, especially urban rent, as a social product, and the stress laid by him on his proposed agrarian law, a plan devoted to a now admittedly impossible mechanical allotment of land; are responsible for his being relegated from the Authorities to the Appendix [ie. by Fillebrown from the body of his book to its appendix].&lt;ref&gt;Fillebrown 1917, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Frontispiece to Birthright in Land.pdf|thumb]]MacDonald describes Ogilvie's ''Essay'' as "a pastoral prose poem, through which we can realise this beautiful world, with its ample provision for satisfying man's instinctive and rational faculties of enjoyment." Ogilvie wrote his revolutionary masterwork between 1776 ([[United States Declaration of Independence|the US declaration of independence]]) and 1781—eight years before the [[The storming of the Bastille|storming of the Bastille]]. He presented the work as a warning to the "friends of mankind", he being "well aware that great changes suddenly accomplished are always pregnant with danger".&lt;ref&gt;Ogilvie's Essay, in Ogilvie 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his so-called 'boycotting', Ogilvie and his work does appear to have had contemporary influence. A copy of his ''Essay'', marked "with the author's compliments", was found in the repositories of the modernising [[Frederick the Great]]; and Ogilvie was involved in the land tenure reforms carried out by [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]] in lower Bengal in 1793.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Ogilvie's work was praised by Fillebrown as "a notable contribution to economic literature, a product of
original and independent thinking".&lt;ref&gt;Fillebrown 1917, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; The ideas it contains were to be taken up and developed a hundred years later by the American social reformer [[Henry George]] and definitively presented in own masterpiece, the economics best-seller ''[[Progress and Poverty]]''. Thus would Ogilvie's [[Scottish Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] insights be turned into a significant 19th century social and political movement, and become a philosophy that would in turn inspire and inform the modern land reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

"The modern land reform movement originated in the last quarter of the eighteenth century, in Great Britain. Its aims and ends are different from those of the Peasants' War ([[English peasants' revolt of 1381|1381]], 1449, 1549) and the [[Diggers]] (1649), for, while these fought either for a restoration of the village community or the establishment of a communism, it advocates a compromise between communism and private property, with a view to increase the number of farmers and, generally, to improve the condition of the labouring population.

The pioneers are [[Thomas Spence]] (1750–1814), William Ogilvie (1736–1813(sic)), and, to some extent, [[Thomas Paine]] (1737–1809). They all argue from the [[natural law]] doctrines, according to which the earth and the fulness thereof were, in the original state of society, or the state of nature, the common property of mankind, so that every child born into the world had ''ipso facto'' an inalienable right to an equal share in the common inheritance." p. v.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ecological economics|Green movements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jamesrobertson.com/tpnews/turningpoint-jan2000.pdf |title=''Turning Point 2000'', James Robertson, January 2000 |accessdate=15 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The fundamental political measure – Community Ground Rent', by Peter Gibb, ''[[Reforesting Scotland]]'', issue 16, spring 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

MacDonald delivers a closing paean on Ogilvie's work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;His ''Essay on the Right of Property in Land'', in every line of it, says: suffer little children to come unto me, and I shall teach them that God is no respecter of persons; that all the children of men are entitled indiscriminately to an equal share in the soil, in all wild animals, game, fish, and the whole products of nature, necessary for man’s subsistence or enjoyment; and that anything contrary to this doctrine is a gross and blasphemous slander on the Creator, as well as a most iniquitous fraud on the bulk of mankind.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Friend of Robert Burns==

Ogilvie’s biographer makes a sustained and compelling argument—presenting circumstantial but no concrete evidence—that Ogilvie was personally acquainted with his compatriot [[Robert Burns]]. He appealingly places the two men side by side:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Both were lovers of mankind, and there was a very strong mental affinity between them. Ogilvie was known as “the gentleman an’ scholar”, but never (except within a very limited circle) as a Land Law Reformer. This is a regretful circumstance. It is equally regretful that Burns is more known as “a rhyming, ranting, roving billie” than as a pioneer and great thinker, in regard to reforms for the benefit of mankind…. Ogilvie and Burns saw eye to eye; but while Burns roused up his fellow-men from the gutter of serfdom, Ogilvie reasoned with them as to the causes which brought them to such a low condition, and also as to the means of reclaiming their natural rights. Ogilvie considered the whole question from a magnanimous, impartial, and truly scientific point of view. He pleaded for “free inquiry”; he sought after truth; he was not one of those rough-and-ready reformers who would simply say, “Abolish landlordism and all evils will vanish”. No. He looked upon modern landlordism not as a cause but as an effect. The primary and fundamental cause of all the evils under which humanity suffers is traced by him to man’s want of knowledge; and landlordism, with all its consequent evils, under which humanity groans, according to him, is directly owing to man’s ignorance of his natural rights. It is this ignorance which begets slavish submission and breeds oppression. Ogilvie considered the situation logically. In his view ignorant humanity must neglect its rights, and without its rights cannot perform its duties. Rights and duties are co-relative. Ogilvie recognised this very old maxim of Natural Law.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Landowner==

Ogilvie came from a family of agricultural [[British Agricultural Revolution|improvers]]. A [[gentleman farmer]] and [[landlord]], he managed in-hand a good portion of his inherited lands of Pittensear until 1772, when, apparently for family reasons, he sold the property to the [[Earl of Fife]] (reserving a lease on the mansion house and manor farm, which he retained "to the last parting pang").&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 1773 Ogilvie purchased the property of Oldfold and Stonegavel, on Deeside, about six miles outside [[Aberdeen]]. In 1808, after thirty-five years of agricultural improvement, having borrowed £2000 from the Duke of Gordon for draining, trenching, blasting and legal fees, he sold it again.&lt;blockquote&gt;"In the year 1802 we find him carrying through a Process in the Court of Teinds, by which he saved the property from being plundered by increased tithes on the increased value arising from his improvements. He got the tithes valued according to the old rental."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Although an academic intellectual, Ogilvie appears to have been a practical man: his management of his landed property benefited from his profound theoretical insights; while his theoretical knowledge was bolstered by his hands-on practical experience on the land.

==Antiquarian and collector==

Ritchie says "Ogilvie enthralled his students with the outstanding quality of his translations of classical writers, especially [[Virgil]] and [[Horace]], although these were never published", and that "his scholarship extended to natural history and the fine arts".&lt;ref name="Ritchie in ODNB, 2004"/&gt; Ogilvie was a keen antiquary, medallist, [[numismatist]] and collector—of natural specimens and of rare prints, mainly portraits.&lt;ref&gt;DC MacDonald's Biographical Notes, in Ogilvie 1891.&lt;/ref&gt; Commencing around 1772, Professor Ogilvie began&lt;blockquote&gt;of his own accord to put together a collection of specimens for a [[Museum#History|museum]] of natural history in the [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]], and has now fitted up, and furnished three apartments for their accommodation. [He procured]...an assortment of specimens of fossils, and in the various branches of [[zoology]] as might serve to excite the liberal curiosity of youth, and make them, in some measure, acquainted the immense variety of the works of nature.... One is astonished to find so large a collection of birds, fishes, marbles, spars etc., accumulated in so short a space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Educational reformer==

During his tenure at Aberdeen Ogilvie was an active educational reformer, helping to sweep aside "a gavelkind system of distributing University honours".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; "Ogilvie's clarity of thought, freedom from preconceptions, and disinterested motives inevitably brought him into conflict with colleagues in King's College".&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie, in ODNB, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Ogilvie held the modern view that Universities were public institutions, and professors public servants (with regard to teaching) and trustees for the public (with regard to endowments, buildings, libraries, etc). The 18th century Masters of King’s College collectively were of a different view.

MacDonald records that during Ogilvie’s time as a member of King’s College&lt;blockquote&gt;his colleagues not only alienated some of the lands belonging to the College, but they misapplied and ‘misappropriated’ College funds. They also disposed of the patronage of no less than fifteen churches, and, worse still, the right of presentation to twenty bursaries. The great landlords were the purchasers of these saleable commodities, and in this way they became the private owners of rights and duties which, until then, were held by the Professors in trust for the public. The money received for Church patronage has been accounted for, but the price of the other articles of commerce was appropriated by the Masters as their own private property. It became 'money in their purse'.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ogilvie protested and sought reform:&lt;blockquote&gt;For upwards of half-a-century Prof. Ogilvie was perhaps the most energetic member of Senatus, his decidedly progressive views bringing him not infrequently into conflict with his more conservative colleagues. The pages of the College Minutes during his incumbency bristle with protests against, and reasons of dissent from, the decision of the majority.&lt;ref&gt;Note by Mr P J Anderson, Secretary to the New Spalding Club, in 'Scottish Notes and Queries for June 1889', cited in DC MacDonald's Biographical Notes, in Ogilvie 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A contemporary printed paper titled 'Outlines of a Plan for Uniting the King’s and Marischal Universities of Aberdeen, With a View to Render the System of Education More Complete' is believed to have been authored by Ogilvie.&lt;ref&gt;WR Humphries, 'William Ogilvie and the projected union of the colleges, 1786–1787', 1940, cited by Ritchie in ODNB, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Its reform proposals were rejected by his own College, with seven out of Ogilvie’s ten Professor colleagues opposing it—the "seven wise Masters" as they became known.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It was not until 1860 finally that the 1786 plans were implemented.

In 1764 Ogilvie’s name is connected with a scheme for a Public Library in Aberdeen. This, like educational reform, was another grand public project that would remain unrealised in his lifetime (but since achieved). His greatest, radical yet practical proposition for the public good—the equitable sharing of nature's bounty among all citizens—remains unfulfilled.

==History==
The school was founded as Fifteenth Mathematical Gymnasium (''XV. matematička gimnazija'') in 1964. It was the among the first schools in former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] specializing in mathematics along with [[Matematička gimnazija|Mathematical Gymnasium]] (''Matematička gimnazija'') in [[Belgrade]].

The first principal was Stefanija Bakarić, sister of [[Vladimir Bakarić]], one of the leading politicians in the ruling [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] and the chairman of the [[League of Communists of Croatia]] at the time. The original curriculum was composed with the help from acclaimed university professors [[Svetozar Kurepa]], Branislav Marković and Vladimir Devide.&lt;ref name=Bresic_book&gt;{{Cite book|title= Zagrebačka XV. gimnazija |last= Brešić |first= Biserka |year= 2008 |publisher= Školska Knjiga |location= Zagreb, Croatia |isbn= 978-953-0-61277-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning, most of the teachers were university professors.

In 1965, it became the first school in Croatia to have information science as a school subject. Students first got the chance to work on actual computers in 1980.

In 1977, the school, now in a new building, merged with Seventh Gymnasium (''VII. gimnazija'') and Fourteenth Gymnasium (''XIV. gimnazija'', also then known as ''25. maj''). The newly founded school was named '''Education Center for Mathematics and Computer Science''' (''Matematičko informatički obrazovni centar''), abbreviated as '''MIOC'''. The school is still informally widely known under that name.

Denis Kuljiš, a known Croatian political columnist and opinion maker, himself an alumnus of XV. gimnazija, argues that at this point the quality of the school started to go down, since the teachers at other schools involved in the merger were not up to the standards of the school.&lt;ref name=Nez_izbrisani&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nezavisne.com/kolumne/vijesti/4576/Izbrisani.html |title=Izbrisani |work=[[Nezavisne novine]] |language=Croatian |accessdate=19 December 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, MIOC was renamed to MIOC Vladimir Popović. 

In 1991, after the fall of Communism, the school changed its name and was once again known as Fifteenth Gymnasium.

In 2007, the management of the school planned to hold a celebration of its thirty years of existence which sparked strong protests from alumni who graduated before 1977.&lt;ref name=Jut_bivsi_ucenici_prosvjeduju&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/bivsi-ucenici-prosvjeduju-zbog-obljetnice-mioc-a/209303/ |title=Bivši učenici prosvjeduju zbog obljetnice MIOC-a |work=Jutarnji list |language=Croatian |accessdate=19 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406201505/http://www.jutarnji.hr/bivsi-ucenici-prosvjeduju-zbog-obljetnice-mioc-a/209303/ |archivedate=6 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, the school held the celebration while mentioning both 1964 and 1977 as important dates in the history of the school.

==Building==
[[File:XV. gimnazija Zagreb (aerial).jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of the school. In the upper-left corner, the new wing can be seen.]]
The school moved to the current building in Jordanovac, which is in the [[Maksimir]] neighborhood of Zagreb, in the seventies. Before that, it was located in an older building in Sutlanska street. The new building was built especially for this purpose and thus contains some of the infrastructure that schools in Zagreb, Croatia and the whole [[Balkans|Balkan region]] lack. There are two gyms, an outdoor sports center, a cafeteria and a movie theater. The school prides itself especially on the amount of modern technology available to both teachers and students.&lt;ref name=XVG_informacije&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mioc.hr/web/index.php?inc=informacije&amp;ids=2 |title=Informacije |publisher=XV. gimnazija |language=Croatian |accessdate=19 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907010501/http://www.mioc.hr/web/index.php?ids=2&amp;inc=informacije |archivedate=7 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the third wing of the building was opened. With an increased number of classrooms, the classes now take place only in the morning while afternoons are reserved for extracurricular activities, a relative rarity among Croatian schools.&lt;ref name=Met_otvorenje_treceg_trakta&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://metro-portal.hr/vijesti/zagreb/otvorenje-treceg-trakta-u-mioc-u |title=Otvorenje trećeg trakta u MIOC-u |work=Metro portal |language=Croatian |accessdate=19 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curriculum==
There are around 1200 students divided into two parts: the so-called "national program" and the [[International Baccalaureate]] program.

In the national program, the students follow the curriculum of mathematical - natural scientific gymnasium, as outlined by the Ministry of Science, Education and Sports (''Ministarstvo znanosti, obrazovanja i športa''). There are three sub-programs, the "Information Science" program which has an additional weekly hour of mathematics and an additional weekly hour of computer science, the Mathematics program. with two additional weekly hours of mathematics, and the "General" program with two weekly hours of a second foreign language, usually [[German Language|German]].&lt;ref name=XVG_program&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mioc.hr/web/index.php?inc=program&amp;ids=2 |title=Program |publisher=XV. gimnazija |language=Croatian |accessdate=19 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830154521/http://www.mioc.hr/web/index.php?inc=program&amp;ids=2 |archivedate=30 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Baccalaureate program, implemented at the school in 1991, is not publicly funded but is instead financed by student tuitions. In it, the school follows the usual IB curriculum, divided into two segments: [[IB Middle Years Programme]] (grades 9 and 10) and [[IB Diploma Programme]] (grades 11 and 12). Around 200 Croatian and foreign students are in IB classes. All the classes are conducted in English.

==Extracurricular Activities and Successes==
Besides the usual range of extracurricular activities, the school prides itself on the work it does preparing their students for national and international competitions. University students work along full-time teachers preparing the students, which is a rather uncommon way of preparing used only in a few Croatian schools and a few more schools in the Balkans.&lt;ref name=XVG_godisnji_plan&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mioc.hr/web/content/datoteke/Plan%20i%20program%202009-2010.doc |title=Godišnji plan i program |publisher=XV. gimnazija |language=Croatian |accessdate=19 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119190818/http://www.mioc.hr/web/content/datoteke/Plan%20i%20program%202009-2010.doc |archivedate=19 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among most notable international results are multiple successes, both in team and single events, at:
* [[International Olympiad in Informatics]]&lt;ref name=Ind_hrvatski_informaticari&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/hrvatski-informaticari-osvojili-zlato-dva-srebra-i-broncu/154904.aspx |title=Hrvatski informatičari osvojili zlato, dva srebra i broncu |work=Index.hr |language=Croatian |accessdate=19 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also noted in the local media, arguably even more than the more important successes mentioned above, were the successes in [[American Computer Science League]], controversially painted in the media as "triumph of knowledge over wealth".&lt;ref name=Vje_pobjeda_znanja&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vjesnik.com/html/2005/06/06/Clanak.asp?r=pis&amp;c=1 |title=Pobjeda znanja nad bogatstvom |work=[[Vjesnik]] |language=Croatian |accessdate=19 December 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jut_ucenici_MIOC-a&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/ucenici-mioc-a-prvaci-svijeta--razvalili-smo-amerikance/221291/ |title=Učenici MIOC-a prvaci svijeta: Razvalili smo Amerikance |work=Jutarnji list |language=Croatian |accessdate=19 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322023312/http://www.jutarnji.hr/ucenici-mioc-a-prvaci-svijeta--razvalili-smo-amerikance/221291/ |archivedate=22 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ACS_2007_08&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acsl.org/acsl/results/2007-2008.htm |title=2007-08 All-Star Contest |publisher=American Computer Science League |accessdate=19 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the students participating in the international and top-tier national competitions come from the publicly funded national program.

==Cooperation==
Besides cooperating with many governmental and non-governmental organizations dealing with education in Zagreb, the school is noted for its long-standing friendship with Second Gymnasium (''II. gimnazija'') in [[Maribor]], [[Slovenia]]. The students of Second Gymnasium participated in the school celebrations in 2007 with the performance of the musical [[We Will Rock You (musical)|We Will Rock You]].

Also, the school runs an exchange and cooperation program with [[Kasetsart University Laboratory School]], one of the more notable schools in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]].&lt;ref name=XVG_suradnja&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mioc.hr/web/index.php?inc=novosti&amp;act=2&amp;id=10 |title=Suradnja XV. gimnazije i Satit Kaset IP, Kasetsart University Laboratory School – International Program |publisher=XV. gimnazija |language=Croatian |accessdate=19 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719174322/http://www.mioc.hr/web/index.php?inc=novosti&amp;act=2&amp;id=10 |archivedate=19 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alumni==
As Fifteenth Gymnasium specializes in mathematics and computer science, it is understandable that most alumni of the school continue their studies at the [[Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing]] and at the Faculty of Science at the [[University of Zagreb]]. Some of them continue working in the science industry after university graduation. There are many alumni working at aforementioned faculties ranging from teaching assistants to academics, such as Marko Tadić, a professor at the Department of Mathematics. Branko Jeren, who was the Minister of Science and Technology of Croatia in the mid-nineties,  who is also currently a professor at [[Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing]], is also an alumnus of the school.

Many of MIOC graduates went abroad, either immediately after finishing high school or later. Perhaps the most notable scientist who graduated from MIOC is [[Marin Soljačić]], a physicist currently residing in the [[United States]]. Some later returned to Croatia, but continued working internationally, such as Bojan Žagrović.&lt;ref name=Med_Bojan_Zagrovic&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medils.hr/index.php/group-leaders/bojan-zagrovic/ |title=Bojan Žagrović |publisher=[[Mediterranean Institute for Life Sciences]] |accessdate=19 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721101257/http://www.medils.hr/index.php/group-leaders/bojan-zagrovic/ |archivedate=21 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As alumni culture is not well-developed in the Balkans, it is difficult to compose a complete list of notable alumni of Fifteenth Gymnasium, especially in areas other than science. Besides Denis Kuljiš, a known political columnist and reporter from Zagreb, some national TV personalities and actors also graduated from Fifteenth Gymnasium. Examples include Filip Brajković, Amar Bukvić (who graduated in the International Baccalaureate program)&lt;ref name=Mal_Amar_Bukvic&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mala-scena.hr/home/biografije/a/amar-bukvic.aspx |title=Amar Bukvić |publisher=Kazalište Mala scena |language=Croatian |accessdate=19 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Domagoj Novokmet, who acted as a host for the celebration of the school held in 2007 in [[Vatroslav Lisinski Concert Hall]].&lt;ref name=HRT_Voditelji_jutra&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://djh.hrt.hr/voditeljiizbornik |title=Voditelji jutra |publisher=[[Hrvatska radiotelevizija]] |language=Croatian |accessdate=19 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Football player [[Niko Kranjčar]] also graduated from MIOC.&lt;ref name=Jut_MIOC-u_trece_krilo&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/mioc-u-trece-krilo-za-43--rodendan/217399 |title=MIOC-u treće krilo za 43. rođendan |work=Jutarnji list |language=Croatian |accessdate=19 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626063718/http://www.jutarnji.hr/mioc-u-trece-krilo-za-43--rodendan/217399/ |archivedate=26 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is probably the most notable sportsperson known to be an alumnus of the school. [[Andrej Kramarić]], also a professional footballer from Zagreb, is expected to graduate from the school in 2010.&lt;ref name=Spo_skromni_Kramaric&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sportske.jutarnji.hr/index.php?cmd=show_clanak&amp;clanak_id=11753 |title=Skromni Kramarić: Imao sam sreće, ne treba se sad praviti važan! |work=[[Sportske novosti]] |language=Croatian |accessdate=19 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
