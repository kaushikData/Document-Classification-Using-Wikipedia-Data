An '''Abrolhos squall''' (or '''Abroholos squall''' or simply '''abroholos''') typically occurs from May through August (austral winter) near the [[Abrolhos Archipelago|Abrolhos Islands]] off the coast of eastern [[Brazil]] near 18°S latitude, located between [[Cabo de São Tomé]] and [[Cabo Frio]].

The southeast [[trade winds]] of the tropical [[South Atlantic Ocean]] acquire heat and moisture traversing the warm [[Brazilian current]] offshore, providing moisture for this rain and thundersquall phenomenon.  The Abrolhos squall typically occurs along Antarctic cold fronts penetrating into the tropics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15734">In [[mathematical logic]] and [[theoretical computer science]], an '''abstract rewriting system''' (also '''(abstract) reduction system''' or '''abstract rewrite system'''; abbreviation '''ARS''') is a [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalism]] that captures the quintessential notion and properties of [[rewriting]] systems. In its simplest form, an ARS is simply a [[set (mathematics)|set]] (of "objects") together with a [[binary relation]], traditionally denoted with &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;; this definition can be further refined if we index (label) subsets of the binary relation. Despite its simplicity, an ARS is sufficient to describe important properties of rewriting systems like [[Normal form (abstract rewriting)|normal form]]s, [[Termination (term rewriting)|termination]], and various notions of [[Confluence (abstract rewriting)|confluence]].

Historically, there have been several formalizations of rewriting in an abstract setting, each with its idiosyncrasies. This is due in part to the fact that some notions are equivalent, see below in this article. The formalization that is most commonly encountered in monographs and textbooks, and which is generally followed here, is due to [[Gérard Huet]] (1980).&lt;ref&gt;Book and Otto, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

'''Abstract reduction system''', (abbreviated '''ARS''') is the most general (unidimensional) notion about specifying a set of objects and rules that can be applied to transform them. 
More recently authors use '''abstract rewriting system''' as well.&lt;ref name = terese7&gt;Terese, p. 7,&lt;/ref&gt; (The preference for the word "reduction" here instead of "rewriting" constitutes a departure from the uniform use of "rewriting" in the names of systems that are particularizations of ARS. Because the word "reduction" does not appear in the names of more specialized systems, in older texts '''reduction system''' is a synonym for ARS).&lt;ref&gt;Book and Otto, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

An ARS is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] ''A'', whose elements are usually called objects, together with a [[binary relation]] on ''A'', traditionally denoted by →, and called the '''reduction relation''', '''rewrite relation'''&lt;ref name = terese7/&gt; or just '''reduction'''.&lt;ref&gt;Book and Otto, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; This (entrenched) terminology using "reduction" is a little misleading, because the relation is not necessarily reducing some measure of the objects.
&lt;!--- deleted, since string rewriting systems aren't discussed futher here: 
this will become more apparent when discussing string rewriting systems further in this article. ---&gt;

In some contexts it may be beneficial to distinguish between some subsets of the rules, i.e. some subsets of the reduction relation →, e.g. the entire reduction relation may consist of [[associativity]] and [[commutativity]] rules. Consequently, some authors define the reduction relation → as the indexed union of some relations; for instance if &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow_1 \cup \rightarrow_2 = \rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;, the notation used is (A, →&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, →&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

As a mathematical object, an ARS is exactly the same as an unlabeled [[state transition system]], and if the relation is considered as an indexed union, then an ARS is the same as a labeled state transition system with the indices being the labels. The focus of the study, and the terminology are different however. In a  [[state transition system]] one is interested in interpreting the labels as actions, whereas in an ARS the focus is on how objects may be transformed (rewritten) into others.&lt;ref&gt;Terese, p. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example 1==

Suppose the set of objects is ''T'' = {''a'', ''b'', ''c''} and the binary relation is given by the rules ''a'' → ''b'', ''b'' → ''a'', ''a'' → ''c'', and ''b'' → ''c''. Observe that these rules can be applied to both ''a'' and ''b'' to get ''c''. Note also, that ''c'' is, in a sense, a "simplest" object in the system, since nothing can be applied to ''c'' to transform it any further. Such a property is clearly an important one.

== Basic notions ==

Example 1 leads us to define some important notions in the general setting of an ARS. First we need some basic notions and notations.&lt;ref&gt;Baader and Nipkow, pp.&amp;nbsp;8-9&lt;/ref&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\stackrel{*}{\rightarrow}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[transitive closure]] of &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow \cup =&lt;/math&gt;, where = is the [[identity relation]], i.e. &lt;math&gt;\stackrel{*}{\rightarrow}&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest [[preorder]] ([[reflexive relation|reflexive]] and [[transitive relation|transitive]] relation) containing &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;. It is also called the [[reflexive transitive closure]] of &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow \cup \rightarrow^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, that is the union of the relation → with its [[inverse relation]], also known as the [[symmetric closure]] of &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\stackrel{*}{\leftrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[transitive closure]] of &lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow \cup =&lt;/math&gt;, that is &lt;math&gt;\stackrel{*}{\leftrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest [[equivalence relation]] containing &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;. It is also known as the [[reflexive transitive symmetric closure]] of &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;.

== Normal forms and the word problem ==
[[File:Solving the word problem without and with completion_svg.svg|thumb|Solving the word problem: deciding if &lt;math&gt;x \stackrel{*}{\leftrightarrow} y&lt;/math&gt; usually requires heuristic search ({{color|#c00000|red}}, {{color|#00c000|green}}), while deciding &lt;math&gt;x\downarrow = y\downarrow&lt;/math&gt; is straight-forward ({{color|#808080|grey}}). For term rewriting systems the [[Knuth-Bendix completion algorithm]] enlarges &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; to establish unique normal forms, if possible.]]
{{main|Normal form (abstract rewriting)}}
An object ''x'' in ''A'' is called '''reducible''' if there exist some other ''y'' in ''A'' and &lt;math&gt;x \rightarrow y&lt;/math&gt;; otherwise it is called '''irreducible''' or a '''normal form'''. An object ''y'' is called a normal form of ''x'' if &lt;math&gt;x \stackrel{*}{\rightarrow} y&lt;/math&gt; and ''y'' is irreducible. If ''x'' has a ''unique'' normal form, then this is usually denoted with &lt;math&gt;x\downarrow&lt;/math&gt;. In example 1 above, ''c'' is a normal form, and &lt;math&gt;c = a\downarrow = b\downarrow&lt;/math&gt;. If every object has at least one normal form, the ARS is called '''normalizing'''.

One of the important problems that may be formulated in an ARS is the '''word problem''': given ''x'' and ''y'' are they equivalent under &lt;math&gt;\stackrel{*}{\leftrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt;? This is a very general setting for formulating the [[Word problem (mathematics)|word problem for the presentation of an algebraic structure]]. For instance, the [[word problem for groups]] is a particular case of an ARS word problem. Central to an "easy" solution for the word problem is the existence of unique normal forms: in this case two objects are equivalent under &lt;math&gt;\stackrel{*}{\leftrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if they have the same normal form. The word problem for an ARS is [[undecidable problem|undecidable]] in general.

== Joinability and the Church&amp;ndash;Rosser property ==

A related, but weaker notion than the existence of normal forms is that of two objects being '''joinable''': ''x'' and ''y'' are said joinable if there exists some ''z'' with the property that &lt;math&gt;x \stackrel{*}{\rightarrow} z \stackrel{*}{\leftarrow} y&lt;/math&gt;. From this definition, it's apparent one may define the joinability relation as &lt;math&gt;\stackrel{*}{\rightarrow} \circ \stackrel{*}{\leftarrow}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; is the [[composition of relations]]. Joinability is usually denoted, somewhat confusingly, also with &lt;math&gt;\downarrow&lt;/math&gt;, but in this notation the down arrow is a binary relation, i.e. we write &lt;math&gt;x\mathbin\downarrow y&lt;/math&gt; if ''x'' and ''y'' are joinable.

An ARS is said to possess the '''Church-Rosser property''' if and only if &lt;math&gt;x \stackrel{*}{\leftrightarrow} y&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;x\mathbin\downarrow y&lt;/math&gt; for all objects ''x'', ''y''. Equivalently, the Church-Rosser property means that the reflexive transitive symmetric closure is contained in the joinability relation. [[Alonzo Church]] and [[J. Barkley Rosser]] proved in 1936 that [[lambda calculus]] has this property;&lt;ref&gt;Alonzo Church and J. Barkley Rosser. Some properties of conversion. Trans.
AMS, 39:472-482, 1936&lt;/ref&gt; hence the name of the property.&lt;ref&gt;Baader and Nipkow, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; (The fact that lambda calculus has this property is also known as the [[Church-Rosser theorem]].) In an ARS with the Church-Rosser property the word problem may be reduced to the search for a common successor. In a Church-Rosser system, an object has ''at most one'' normal form; that is the normal form of an object is unique if it exists, but it may well not exist. In lambda calculus for instance, the expression (λx.xx)(λx.xx) does not have a normal form because there exists an infinite sequence of [[beta reduction]]s (λx.xx)(λx.xx) → (λx.xx)(λx.xx) → ...&lt;ref&gt;S.B. Cooper, ''Computability theory'', p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notions of confluence ==
{{see also|Confluence (abstract rewriting)}}
Various properties, simpler than Church-Rosser, are equivalent to it. The existence of these equivalent properties allows one to prove that a system is Church-Rosser with less work. Furthermore, the notions of confluence can be defined as properties of a particular object, something that's not possible for Church-Rosser. An ARS &lt;math&gt;(A,\rightarrow)&lt;/math&gt; is said to be,

* '''confluent''' if and only if for all ''w'', ''x'', and ''y'' in ''A'',  &lt;math&gt;x \stackrel{*}{\leftarrow} w \stackrel{*}{\rightarrow} y&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;x\mathbin\downarrow y&lt;/math&gt;. Roughly speaking, confluence says that no matter how two paths diverge from a common ancestor (''w''), the paths are joining at ''some'' common successor. This notion may be refined as property of a particular object ''w'', and the system called confluent if all its elements are confluent.
* '''semi-confluent''' if and only if for all ''w'', ''x'', and ''y'' in ''A'',  &lt;math&gt;x \leftarrow w \stackrel{*}{\rightarrow} y&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;x\mathbin\downarrow y&lt;/math&gt;. This differs from confluence by the single step reduction from ''w'' to ''x''.
* '''locally confluent''' if and only if for all ''w'', ''x'', and ''y'' in ''A'',  &lt;math&gt;x \leftarrow w \rightarrow y&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;x\mathbin\downarrow y&lt;/math&gt;. This property is sometimes called '''weak confluence'''.

[[File:Cyclic_locally,_but_not_globally_confluent_rewrite_system.png|thumb|Example of a locally-confluent rewrite system not having the Church-Rosser property]]
'''Theorem.''' For an ARS the following three conditions are equivalent: (i) it has the Church-Rosser property, (ii) it is confluent, (iii) it is semi-confluent.&lt;ref&gt;Baader and Nipkow, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Corollary'''.&lt;ref&gt;Baader and Nipkow, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; In a confluent ARS if &lt;math&gt;x \stackrel{*}{\leftrightarrow} y&lt;/math&gt; then
* If both ''x'' and ''y'' are normal forms, then ''x'' = ''y''.
* If ''y'' is a normal form, then &lt;math&gt;x \stackrel{*}{\rightarrow} y&lt;/math&gt;

Because of these equivalences, a fair bit of variation in definitions is encountered in the literature. For instance, in Terese the Church-Rosser property and confluence are defined to be synonymous and identical to the definition of confluence presented here; Church-Rosser as defined here remains unnamed, but is given as an equivalent property; this departure from other texts is deliberate.&lt;ref&gt;Terese p.11&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the above corollary, one may define a normal form ''y'' of ''x'' as an irreducible ''y'' with the property that &lt;math&gt;x \stackrel{*}{\leftrightarrow} y&lt;/math&gt;. This definition, found in Book and Otto, is equivalent to common one given here in a confluent system, but it is more inclusive in a non-confluent ARS.

Local confluence on the other hand is not equivalent with the other notions of confluence given in this section, but it is strictly weaker than confluence. The typical counterexample is &lt;math&gt;\{b\rightarrow c, c\rightarrow b, b\rightarrow a, c\rightarrow d\}&lt;/math&gt;, which is locally confluent but not confluent (cf. picture).

== Termination and convergence ==
An abstract rewriting system is said to be '''terminating''' or '''noetherian''' if there is no infinite chain &lt;math&gt;x_0 \rightarrow x_1 \rightarrow x_2 \rightarrow \cdots&lt;/math&gt;. (This is just saying that the rewriting relation is a [[Noetherian relation]].) In a terminating ARS, every object has at least one normal form, thus it is normalizing. The converse is not true. In example 1 for instance, there is an infinite rewriting chain, namely &lt;math&gt;a \rightarrow b \rightarrow a \rightarrow b \rightarrow \cdots&lt;/math&gt;, even though the system is normalizing. A confluent and terminating ARS is called '''canonical''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=David A. Duffy| title=Principles of Automated Theorem Proving| year=1991| publisher=Wiley}} Here: sect.7.2.1, p.153&lt;/ref&gt; or '''convergent'''. In a convergent ARS, every object has a unique normal form. But it is sufficient for the system to be confluent and normalizing for a unique normal to exist for every element, as seen in example 1.

'''Theorem''' ([[Newman's Lemma]]): A terminating ARS is confluent if and only if it is locally confluent.

The original 1942 proof of this result by Newman was rather complicated. It wasn't until 1980 that Huet published a much simpler proof exploiting the fact that when &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; is terminating we can apply [[well-founded induction]].&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1881 [[Marion Talbot]] and [[Ellen Swallow Richards]] invited 15 alumnae from 8 colleges to a meeting in Boston, Massachusetts.&lt;ref name="Cullen-DuPont2000"/&gt; The purpose of this meeting was to create an organization of women college graduates that would assist women in finding greater opportunities to use their education, as well as promoting and assisting other women's college attendance. The Association of Collegiate Alumnae or ACA, (AAUW's predecessor organization) was officially founded on January 14, 1882. The ACA also worked to improve standards of education for women so that men and women's higher education was more equal in scope and difficulty.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Degrees of Equality: The American Association of University Women and the Challenge of Twentieth-Century Feminism|last = Levine|first = Susan|publisher = Temple University Press|year = 1995|isbn = 9781566393263|location = |pages = 6, 9–11, 19|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5XBwy5rYUm8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=%22American%20Association%20of%20University%20Women%20%22&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q=%22American%20Association%20of%20University%20Women%20%22&amp;f=false|chapter = Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of 1884, the ACA had been meeting only in Boston. However, as more women across the country became interested in its work, the Association saw that expansion into branches was necessary to carry on its work. Washington, D.C., was the first branch to be created in 1884, and New York, Pacific (San Francisco), Philadelphia, and Boston branches followed in 1886.

In 1885, the organization took on one of its first major projects: they essentially had to justify their right to exist. A common belief held at the time that a college education would harm a woman’s health and result in infertility. This myth was supported by Harvard-educated Boston physician Dr. Edward H. Clarke.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An ACA committee led by [[Annie Howes]] created a series of questions that were sent to 1,290 ACA members; 705 replies were received.  After the results were tabulated, the data demonstrated that higher education did not harm women’s health. The report, "Health Statistics of Female College Graduates" was published in 1885 in conjunction with the [[Massachusetts Bureau of Statistics of Labor]]. This first research report is one of many conducted by AAUW during its history.&lt;ref&gt;Health Statistics of Female College Graduates, 1885. Published by Massachusetts Bureau of Statistics of Labor.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887, a fellowship program for women was established. Supporting the education of women through fellowships would continually remain a critical part of AAUW’s mission.

Back in 1883, a similar group of college women had considered forming a Chicago, Illinois branch of the ACA; however, they had reconsidered and formed their own independent organization. They formed the Western Association of Collegiate Alumnae (WACA) with [[Jane M. Bancroft]] as its first president. WACA was broad in purpose and consisted of five committees: fine arts, outdoor occupations,domestic professions, press and journalism, and higher education of women in the West.  In 1888, WACA awarded its first fellowship of $350 to [[Ida Street]], a [[Vassar College]] graduate, to conduct research at the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, Marion and Lois Kimball Mathews Rosenberry. The History of the American Association of University Women, Cambridge, MA: Riverside Press, 1931, p, 40-45.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1889, WACA merged with the ACA, further expanding the groups' capacity.

In 1919, the ACA participated in a larger effort led by a group of American women which ultimately raised $156,413 to purchase a gram of radium for [[Marie Curie]] for her experiments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astr.ua.edu/4000WS/CURIE.html University of Alabama article] accessed March 11. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Brownell, 1922 President of the American Association of University Women, S.F. Bay Branch, Who's who among the women of California]]

In 1921, the ACA merged with the Southern Association of College Women to create the AAUW, although local branches continued to be the backbone of AAUW. The policy of expansion greatly increased both the size and the impact of the Association, from a small, local organization to a nationwide network of college educated women, and by 1929, there were 31,647 members and 475 branches.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During World War II, AAUW officially began raising money to assist female scholars displaced by the Nazi led occupation who were unable to continue their work. The War Relief Fund received numerous pleas for help and worked tirelessly to find teaching and other positions for refugee women at American schools and universities and in other countries. Individual branch members of AAUW also participated by signing immigration affidavits of support. During 1940, its inaugural year, the War Relief Committee raised $29,950 for distribution with 350 branches contributing.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The organization was "largely apolitical" until the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://montanawomenshistory.org/things-to-be-done-which-money-and-men-will-never-provide-the-activism-of-montanas-aauw/|title = "Things to be done which money and men will never provide": The Activism of Montana’s AAUW|date = 23 December 2014|accessdate = 21 December 2015|website = Women's History Matters|publisher = The Montana Historical Society|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, women in the workforce had increased to the extent that they made up 38% of workers by the end of the 1960s. Women graduating from college were looking for good employment. Membership in 1960 was at 147,920 women, most of them middle class.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Degrees of Equality: The American Association of University Women and the Challenge of Twentieth-Century Feminism|last = Levine|first = Susan|publisher = Temple University Press|year = 1995|isbn = 9781566393263|location = |pages = 140–141|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5XBwy5rYUm8C |chapter = Mainstream Feminism and the New Activism, 1960-1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AAUW Legal Advocacy Fund (LAF), a program of the Foundation, is the United States' largest legal fund focused solely on [[sex discrimination]] against women in higher education. LAF provides funds and a support system for women seeking judicial redress for sex discrimination in higher education. Since 1981, LAF has helped female students, faculty, and administrators challenge sex discrimination, including sexual harassment, pay inequity, denial of tenure and promotion, and inequality in women’s athletics programs.

AAUW sponsors grassroots and advocacy efforts, research, and Campus Action Projects and other educational programs in conjunction with its ongoing programmatic theme, Education as the Gateway to Women's Economic Security.&lt;ref&gt;AAUW, [http://www.aauw.org/education/financialLit/index.cfm Education as the Gateway to Women's Economic Security] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504080606/http://www.aauw.org/education/financialLit/index.cfm |date=2007-05-04 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with three other organizations, it founded the [[CTM Madison Family Theatre]] in 1965.

'''BigDFT''' is a [[free software|free]] [[Software package (installation)|software package]] for [[physicist]]s and [[chemist]]s, distributed under the [[GNU General Public License]], whose main program allows the total [[energy]], [[Current density|charge density]], and [[Electron configuration|electronic structure]] of systems made of [[electron]]s and [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] ([[molecules]] and periodic/crystalline [[solid]]s) to be calculated within [[density functional theory]] (DFT), using [[pseudopotential]]s, and a [[wavelet]] basis.&lt;ref&gt;''Daubechies wavelets as a basis set for density functional pseudopotential calculations
'', L. Genovese, A. Neelov, S. Goedecker, T. Deutsch, S. A. Ghasemi, A. Willand, D. Caliste, O. Zilberberg, M. Rayson, A. Bergman, R. Schneider, Daubechies wavelets as a basis set for density functional pseudopotential calculations, Journal of Chemical Physics, '''129''', 014109 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
BigDFT implements [[density functional theory]] (DFT) by solving the [[Kohn–Sham equations]] describing the electrons in a material, expanded in a [[Daubechies wavelet]] basis set and using a self-consistent direct minimization or Davidson diagonalisation methods to determine the energy minimum. Computational efficiency is achieved through the use of fast short convolutions 
and [[pseudopotential]]s to describe core electrons. In addition to total energy, forces and stresses are also calculated so that geometry optimizations and ab initio molecular dynamics may be carried out.

The Daubechies wavelet basis sets are an orthogonal systematic basis set as plane wave basis set but has the great advantage to allow adapted mesh with different levels of resolutions (see [[multi-resolution analysis]]). Interpolating scaling functions are used also to solve the [[Poisson's equation]]&lt;ref&gt;''Efficient solution of Poisson's equation with free boundary conditions'', L. Genovese, T. Deutsch, A. Neelov, S. Goedecker, G. Beylkin, Journal of Chemical Physics, '''125''', 074105 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Efficient and accurate three-dimensional Poisson solver for surface problems'', L. Genovese, T. Deutsch, S. Goedecker, Journal of Chemical Physics, '''127''', 054704 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; with different [[boundary condition]]s as isolated or surface systems.

BigDFT was among the first massively parallel density functional theory codes which benefited from [[graphics processing units]] (GPU)&lt;ref&gt;''Density Functional Theory calculation on many-cores hybrid CPU-GPU architectures in hybrid architecture'', L. Genovese, M. Ospici, T. Deutsch, J.-F. Méhaut, A. Neelov, S. Goedecker,  Journal of Chemical Physics '''131''', 034103 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; using [[CUDA]] and then [[OpenCL]] languages.

Because the Daubechies wavelets have a compact support, the Hamiltonian application can be done locally&lt;ref&gt;''Daubechies wavelets for linear scaling density functional theory
'', S. Mohr, L. E. Ratcliff, P. Boulanger, L. Genovese, D. Caliste, T. Deutsch, S. Goedecker, Journal of Chemical Physics, '''140''', 204110 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; which permits to have a [[Ab_initio_quantum_chemistry_methods#Linear_scaling_approaches | linear scaling]] in function of the number of atoms instead of a cubic scaling for traditional DFT software.

It was first observed by [[Sergey Blazhko]] in 1907 in the star [[RW Draconis]].&lt;ref&gt;

The physics behind the Blazhko effect is currently still a matter of debate, with there being three primary hypotheses.
In the first, referred to as the resonance model, the cause of the modulation is a [[nonlinear resonance|non-linear resonance]] among either the fundamental or the first overtone pulsation mode of the star and a higher mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Kolláth | first1 = Z. | last2 = Molnár | first2 = L. | last3 = Szabó | first3 = R. | title = Period-doubling bifurcation and high-order resonances in RR Lyrae hydrodynamical models | year = 2011 | journal = MNRAS | volume = 414 | pages = 1111| arxiv = 1102.0157 | bibcode = 2011MNRAS.414.1111K | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.18451.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Buchler | first1 = J.

&lt;/ref&gt; The second, known as the magnetic model, assumes the variation to be caused by the magnetic field being inclined to the rotational axis, deforming the main radial mode.

Observational evidence based on [[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler]] observations indicates much of the Blazhko effect's two-cycle light curve modulation is due to simple period-doubling. Many RR Lyrae stars have a variability period of approximately 12 hours and ground-based astronomers typically make nightly observations about 24 hours apart; thus period-doubling results in brightness maximums during nightly observations that are significantly different than the daytime maximum.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Bubble fusion''' is the non-technical name for a [[nuclear fusion]] reaction hypothesized to occur inside extraordinarily large collapsing gas bubbles created in a liquid during [[Sonic cavitation|acoustic cavitation]]. The more technical name is '''sonofusion'''.&lt;ref name="Chang-practical"&gt;{{cite news

The term was coined in 2002 with the release of a report by [[Rusi Taleyarkhan]] and collaborators that claimed to have observed evidence of sonofusion. The claim was quickly surrounded by controversy, including allegations ranging from experimental error to academic fraud. Subsequent publications claiming independent verification of sonofusion were also highly controversial.

Eventually, an investigation by [[Purdue University]] found that Taleyarkhan had engaged in falsification of independent verification, and had included a student as an author on a paper when he had not participated in the research. He was subsequently stripped of his professorship. One of his funders, the [[Office of Naval Research]] reviewed the report by Purdue and barred him from federal funding for 28 months.&lt;ref name=reich /&gt;

In the March 8, 2002 issue of the peer-reviewed journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', [[Rusi Taleyarkhan|Rusi P. Taleyarkhan]] and colleagues at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)]] reported that acoustic cavitation experiments conducted with [[Deuterium|deuterated]] [[acetone]] ({{carbon|3}}{{deuterium|6}}{{oxygen}}) showed measurements of [[tritium]] and [[neutron]] output consistent with the occurrence of fusion. The neutron emission was also reported to be coincident with the [[sonoluminescence]] pulse, a key indicator that its source was fusion caused by the heat and pressure inside the collapsing bubbles.&lt;ref name="Taleyarkhan-2002-03-08"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taleyarkhan|first=R.

== Oak Ridge failed replication ==
The results were so startling, that the Oak Ridge National Laboratory asked two independent researchers, D. Shapira and M. J. Saltmarsh, to repeat the experiment using more sophisticated [[neutron detection]] equipment. They reported that the neutron release was consistent with random coincidence.&lt;ref name="Shapira-2002-08-19"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rebuttal by Taleyarkhan and the other authors of the original report argued that the Shapira and Saltmarsh report failed to account for significant differences in experimental setup, including over an inch of shielding between the neutron detector and the sonoluminescing acetone. According to Taleyarkhan ''et al.'', when properly considering those differences, the results were consistent with fusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bubble Fusion takes next hurdle|author=Haiko Lietz|url=http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/20/20542/1.html|accessdate=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 2002, while experimental work was still in progress, Aaron Galonsky of Michigan State University, in a letter to the journal ''Science''&lt;ref name="Galonsky-2002-09-06"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
expressed doubts about the claim made by the Taleyarkhan team. In Galonsky's opinion, the observed neutrons were too high in energy to be from a [[deuterium]]-deuterium (d-d) fusion reaction. In their response (published on the same page), the Taleyarkhan team provided detailed  counter-arguments and concluded that the energy was "reasonably close" to that which was expected from a fusion reaction.

In February 2005 the documentary series ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' commissioned two leading sonoluminescence researchers, Seth Putterman&lt;ref name="Putterman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://personnel.physics.ucla.edu/directory/faculty/putterman |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006174400/http://personnel.physics.ucla.edu/directory/faculty/putterman |archivedate=2011-10-06 |df= }}, Seth Putterman personal page.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kenneth S. Suslick]], to reproduce Taleyarkhan's work.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results differed from the original results in that fusion was claimed to occur over longer times than previously reported. The original report only claimed neutron emission from the initial bubble collapse following bubble nucleation, whereas this report claimed neutron emission many acoustic cycles later.

In July 2005, two of Taleyarkhan's students at [[Purdue University]] published evidence confirming the previous result. They used the same acoustic chamber, the same deuterated acetone fluid and a similar bubble nucleation system. In this report, no neutron-sonoluminescence coincidence was attempted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006, in the midst of accusations concerning Taleyarkhan's research standards, two different scientists visited the meta-stable fluids research lab at Purdue University to measure neutrons, using Taleyarkhan's equipment. Dr. Edward R. Forringer and undergraduates David Robbins and Jonathan Martin of [[LeTourneau University]] presented two papers at the [[American Nuclear Society]] Winter Meeting that reported replication of neutron emission. Their experimental setup was similar to previous experiments in that it used a mixture of deuterated acetone, [[deuterated benzene]], [[tetrachloroethylene]] and [[uranyl nitrate]]. Notably, however, it operated without an external neutron source and used two types of [[Neutron detection|neutron detectors]]. They claimed a liquid [[scintillation (physics)|scintillation]] detector measured neutron levels at 8 [[standard deviation]]s above the background level, while plastic detectors measured levels at 3.8 standard deviations above the background. When the same experiment was performed with non-deuterated [[Experimental control|control]] liquid, the measurements were within one standard deviation of background, indicating that the neutron production had only occurred during cavitation of the deuterated liquid.&lt;ref name="LeTourneau-2006-11-17"&gt;"Bubble Fusion Confirmed by LETU Research" LeTourneau University News (www.letu.edu/opencms/opencms/events/Bubble_Fusion_Confirmed_by_LETU_Research.html) link inactive as of 2008-05-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANS-pgm"&gt;{{cite web

Tsoukalas, head of the School of Nuclear Engineering at Purdue, and several of his colleagues at Purdue, had convinced Taleyarkhan to move to Purdue and attempt a joint replication. In the 2006 ''Nature'' report they detail several troubling issues when trying to collaborate with Taleyarkhan. He reported positive results from certain set of raw data, but his colleagues had also examined that set and it only contained negative results. He never showed his colleagues the raw data corresponding to the positive results, despite several requests. He moved the equipment from a shared laboratory to his own laboratory, thus impeding review by his colleagues, and he didn't give any advance warning or explanation for the move. Taleyarkhan convinced his colleagues that they shouldn't publish a paper with their negative results. Taleyarkhan then insisted that the university's press release present his experiment as "peer-reviewed" and "independent", when the co-authors were working in his laboratory under his supervision, and his peers in the faculty were not allowed to review the data. In summary, Taleyarkhan's colleagues at Purdue said he placed obstacles to peer review of his experiments, and they had serious doubts about the validity of the research.&lt;ref name="silencing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hot air"&gt;{{cite journal

''Nature'' also revealed that the process of anonymous peer-review had not been followed, and that the journal ''Nuclear Engineering and Design'' was not independent from the authors. Taleyarkhan was co-editor of the journal, and the paper was only peer-reviewed by his co-editor, with Taleyarkhan's knowledge.&lt;ref name="hot air"/&gt;

In 2002 Taleyarkhan  filed a patent application on behalf of the United States Department of Energy, while working in Oak Ridge. ''Nature'' reported that the patent had been rejected in 2005 by the US Patent Office. The examiner called the experiment a variation of discredited [[cold fusion]], found that there was "no reputable evidence of record to support any allegations or claims that the invention is capable of operating as indicated", and found that there was not enough detail for others to replicate the invention. The field of fusion suffered from many flawed claims, thus the examiner asked for additional proof that the radiation was generated from fusion and not from other sources. An appeal was not filed because the Department of Energy had dropped the claim in December 2005.&lt;ref name="hot air_2"&gt;{{cite journal

Doubts among Purdue University's Nuclear Engineering faculty as to whether the positive results reported from sonofusion experiments conducted there were truthful prompted the university to initiate a review of the research, conducted by Purdue's Office of the Vice President for Research.

On February 7, 2007, the Purdue University administration determined that "the evidence does not support the allegations of research misconduct and that no further investigation of the allegations is warranted". Their report also stated that "vigorous, open debate of the scientific merits of this new technology is the most appropriate focus going forward."&lt;ref name="Purdue-2007-02-07"&gt;{{cite news

In June 2008, a multi-institutional team including Taleyarkhan published a paper in Nuclear Engineering and Design to "clear up misconceptions generated by a webposting of UCLA which served as the basis for the ''Nature'' article of March 2006", according to a press release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

On July 18, 2008, Purdue University announced that a committee with members from five institutions had investigated 12 allegations of research misconduct against Rusi Taleyarkhan.  It concluded that two allegations were founded—that Taleyarkhan had claimed independent confirmation of his work when in reality the apparent confirmations were done by Taleyarkhan's former students and was not as "independent" as Taleyarkhan implied, and that Taleyarkhan had included a colleague's name on one of his papers who had not actually been involved in the research ("the sole apparent motivation for the addition of Mr. Butt was a desire to overcome a reviewer's criticism", the report concluded).&lt;ref name="report2008"&gt;{{cite web

  |accessdate = 2008-07-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taleyarkhan's appeal of the report's conclusions was rejected.  He said the two allegations of misconduct were trivial administrative issues and had nothing to do with the discovery of bubble nuclear fusion or the underlying science, and that "all allegations of fraud and fabrication have been dismissed as invalid and without merit — thereby supporting the underlying science and experimental data as being on solid ground".&lt;ref name="Nature_India_2008"&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A researcher questioned by the LA Times said that the report had not clarified whether bubble fusion was real or not, but that the low quality of the papers and the doubts cast by the report had destroyed Taleyarkhan's credibility with the scientific community.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-sci-misconduct19-2008jul19,0,1765099.story Purdue physicist found guilty of misconduct], Los Angeles Times, July 19, 2008, Thomas H. Maugh II&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 27, 2008 he was stripped of his named Arden Bement Jr. Professorship, and forbidden to be a thesis advisor for graduate students for at least the next 3 years.&lt;ref name="Nature_India_2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SFC"&gt;{{cite news

Despite the findings against him, Taleyarkhan received a $185,000 grant from the [[National Science Foundation]]  between September 2008 and August 2009 to investigate bubble fusion. In 2009 the Office of Naval Research debarred him for 28 months, until September 2011, from receiving U.S. Federal Funding. During that period his name was listed in the 'Excluded Parties List' to prevent him from receiving further grants from any government agency.&lt;ref name=reich&gt;{{cite magazine |author= Reich, Eugenie Samuel |title= Bubble-fusion scientist debarred from federal funding |magazine=[[Nature (magazine)|Nature]] |date= 23 November 2009 |doi= 10.1038/news.2009.1103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is equivalent to 1 Debye-Ångström, where 1 [[Debye]] = 1{{e|&amp;minus;18}} [[statcoulomb]]-[[centimetre]] is the cgs unit of [[molecular dipole moment]] and 1 [[Ångström]] = 1{{e|&amp;minus;8}} cm. 

One Buckingham corresponds to the quadrupole moment resulting from two opposing dipole moments but an equal magnitude of 1 Debye which are separated by a distance of 1 Angstrom, a typical [[bond length]]. This is analogous to the Debye unit for the dipole moment of two opposing charges of 1{{e|&amp;minus;10}} statcoulomb separated by 1 Angstrom, and the name Buckingham for the unit was in fact suggested by [[Peter Debye]] in 1963 in honour of Buckingham.&lt;ref&gt;Chemical and Engineering News, 1963, 41 (16), pp 40–43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D.C.

'''''Calculating Space''''' ({{lang-de|Rechnender Raum}}) is [[Konrad Zuse]]'s 1969 book on [[digital physics]].&lt;ref name=mainzer-chua&gt;{{cite book | first1=Klaus | last1=Mainzer | first2=Leon | last2=Chua | title=The Universe as Automaton: From Simplicity and Symmetry to Complexity | page=6 | publisher=Springer |date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zuse proposed that the [[universe]] is being computed by some sort of [[cellular automaton]] or other discrete computing machinery,&lt;ref name=mainzer-chua/&gt; challenging the long-held view that some physical laws are continuous by nature. He focused on cellular automata as a possible substrate of the computation, and pointed out (among other things) that the classical notions of [[entropy]] and [[second law of thermodynamics|its growth]] do not make sense in deterministically computed universes.

[[Bell's theorem]] is sometimes thought to contradict Zuse's hypothesis, but it is not applicable to [[deterministic universe]]s, as Bell himself pointed out. Similarly, while [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]]'s [[uncertainty principle]] limits in a fundamental way what an observer can observe, when the observer is himself a part of the universe he is trying to observe, that principle does not rule out Zuse's hypothesis, which views any observer as a part of the hypothesized deterministic process. So far there is no unambiguous physical evidence against the possibility that "everything is just a computation," and a large amount has been written about [[digital physics]] since Zuse's book appeared.

'''Choice''' was a [[credit card]] [[test market]]ed by [[Citibank]] in the [[United States]], announced in 1977, and first issued in 1978. It was one of the first cards to offer a cash refund program, and no annual fee. Choice was intended to create a rival to [[Visa (credit card)|Visa]], [[MasterCard]], and [[American Express]], but proved unsuccessful, and was withdrawn in 1987. Citibank has continued to use the "Choice" name on some of its Visa and MasterCard cards.

The card was introduced in 1977, when Citibank bought '''NAC''', a regional credit card based in [[Baltimore]], renaming it Choice. A subsequent campaign in [[Maryland]] in 1980 turned the card into a regional success, earning more than one million cardholders in the Baltimore and [[Washington, DC]], area.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1985/02/04/65549/index.htm |title=The Great Plastic Card Fight Begins |accessdate=2008-08-22 |author=Monci Jo Williams |publisher=Fortune magazine |date=February 4, 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With a view to nationwide expansion, the test market was expanded to include [[Colorado]]. 

Despite the success of [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears]]' [[Discover Card]], which offered many of the same features as Choice when it was introduced in 1985 (such as a rebate on purchases and no annual fee), Citibank decided Choice could not compete with Visa and MasterCard in the longer term, and the card was reissued as a Visa at the end of 1987, aimed at entry level customers and those with poor credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gazette.net/gazette_archive/2005b/200517/business/features/272654-1.html |title=A Bountiful Harvest: John Hollerbach is reaping the rewards of persistence and hard work |accessdate=2008-08-22 |author=Rachel Golden |publisher=Gazette.net |date=April 29, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was also said that Citibank's owner, Citicorp, was not willing to accept the eventual estimated costs of establishing another national credit card, after Sears had spent an estimated USD$80 million creating its Discover Card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/11/business/citicorp-to-convert-choice-card-to-visa.html?emc=rss&amp;partner=rssnyt |title=Citicorp to Convert Choice Card to Visa |accessdate=2008-08-22 |author=Eric N. Berg |publisher=New York Times |date=August 11, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its fate was similar to that of Citibank's first credit card, the "First National City Charge Service" (or "[[The Everything Card]]"), introduced on the East Coast in 1967 to compete with BankAmericard (today's Visa) but which became part of Master Charge (now MasterCard) in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citigroup.com/citigroup/corporate/history/citibank.htm |title=Citigroup History: Citibank N.A. |accessdate=2008-08-22 |publisher=Citigroup website |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613210609/http://www.citigroup.com/citigroup/corporate/history/citibank.htm |archivedate=2008-06-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Commentariolus''''' (''Little Commentary'') is [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]'s brief outline of an early version of his revolutionary [[Copernican heliocentrism|heliocentric theory]] of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Koyre-1973|Koyré]] (1973, pp.18&amp;ndash;28); [[#CITEREFSwerdlow1973|Swerdlow]] (1973, pp.423–4); [[#CITEREEFCopernicus1992|Copernicus]] (1992, pp.20, 208–52); [[#Reference-Rosen-2004|Rosen]] (2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ceSnipu4MykC&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false pp.6&amp;ndash;7], [https://books.google.com/books?id=ceSnipu4MykC&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 57&amp;ndash;90]).&lt;/ref&gt;  After further long development of his theory, Copernicus published the mature version in 1543 in his landmark work, ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (''On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres'').

Copernicus wrote the "Commentariolus" in Latin some time before 1514 and circulated copies to his friends and colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;A reference to the "Commentariolus" is contained in a library catalogue, dated May 1st, 1514, of a 16th-century historian, Matthew of Miechow, so it must have begun circulating before that date (Koyré, [[#Reference-Koyre-1973|1973, p.85]]; Gingerich, [[#Reference-Gingerich-2004|2004, p.32]]).&lt;/ref&gt;  It thus became known among Copernicus's contemporaries, though it was never printed during his lifetime. In 1533, [[Johann Albrecht Widmannstetter]] delivered a series of lectures in [[Rome]] outlining Copernicus' theory. [[Pope Clement VII]] and several [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Catholic cardinals]] heard the lectures and were interested in the theory. On 1 November 1536, [[Nikolaus von Schönberg]], [[Archbishop of Capua]] and since the preceding year a cardinal, wrote to Copernicus from Rome and asked him for a copy of his writings "at the earliest possible moment".&lt;ref&gt;[http://webexhibits.org/calendars/year-text-Copernicus.html Schönberg, Nicholas, Letter to Nicolaus Copernicus, translated by Edward Rosen].&lt;/ref&gt;

Although copies of the "Commentariolus" circulated for a time after Copernicus's death,&lt;ref&gt;[[Tycho Brahe]] obtained a copy in 1575, and subsequently presented copies to students and colleagues as tokens of his esteem ([[#dreyer-1890|Dreyer]], 1890, [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924005641380#page/n106/mode/1up/search/commentariolus p.83]; [[#thoren-1990|Thoren]], 1990, [https://books.google.com/books?id=F5a83U4B8XkC&amp;pg=PA98 pp.98&amp;ndash;99])&lt;/ref&gt; it subsequently lapsed into obscurity, and its previous existence remained known only indirectly, until a surviving manuscript copy was discovered and published in the second half of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="first published"&gt;According to [[#Reference-Rosen-2004|Rosen (2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;6–7)]], a manuscript copy of the "Commentariolus" was discovered in Vienna and published in 1878. It was said by [[#Reference-Koyre-1973|Koyré (1973, p.&amp;nbsp;76)]] that a very poor copy was published in the 1854 Warsaw edition of ''De revolutionibus''. This seems to be a mistake.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
The Commentariolus is subdivided into eight sections (or chapters), of which all but the first bear brief descriptive titles.  After a brief introduction, the first section states seven postulates from which Copernicus proposes to show that the apparent motion of the planets can be explained systematically.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFGoddu2010|Goddu]] (2010, pp.[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=iEjk13-1xSYC&amp;pg=PA243 243-6]).&lt;/ref&gt;

===  The seven postulates===
#Celestial bodies do not all revolve around a single point.
#The centre of the [[Earth]] is the centre of the lunar sphere—the orbit of the moon around the Earth.
#All the spheres rotate around the [[Sun]], which is near the centre of the Universe.
#The distance between the Earth and the Sun is an insignificant fraction of the distance from the Earth and the Sun to the stars, so [[parallax]] is not observed in the stars.
#The stars are immovable; their apparent daily motion is caused by the daily rotation of the Earth.
#The Earth is moved in a sphere around the Sun, causing the apparent annual migration of the Sun; the Earth has more than one motion.
#The Earth’s orbital motion around the Sun causes the seeming reverse in direction of the motions of the planets.

The remaining seven sections are titled, in order, ''De ordine orbium'' (''"The order of the spheres"''), ''De motibus qui circa solem apparent'' (''"The apparent motions of the Sun"''), ''Quod aequalitas motum non ad aequinoctia sed ad stellas fixas referatur'' (''"Equal motion should be measured not by the equinoxes but by the fixed stars"''), ''De Luna'' (''"The [[Moon]]"''), ''De tribus superioribus: Saturno, Jove et Marte'' (''"The outer planets: [[Saturn]], [[Jupiter]] and [[Mars]]"''), ''De Venere'' (''"[[Venus]]"'') and ''De Mercurio'' (''"[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]"'').&lt;ref&gt;The English translations of the section titles are Rosen's ([[#Reference-Rosen-2004|2004]], pp.[http://copernicus.torun.pl/en/archives/astronomical/1/?view=transkrypcja&amp;lang=en 57–65])&lt;/ref&gt;

===The order of the spheres===
In this section, the heavenly spheres are given in order from outermost to innermost.  
The outermost sphere is that of the fixed stars, which remains perfectly stationary.  Then follow those of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Earth, Venus and Mercury, which each revolve about the Sun from west to east with successively shorter periods of revolution, Saturn's being between 29 and 30 years, Jupiter's between 11 and 12, Mars's between 2 and 3, Earth's exactly one, Venus's between 8 and 9 months,&lt;ref&gt;Copernicus does not specify which type of month he is referring to.  His period for Venus would be correct if he were referring to [[lunar month#Tropical month|tropical]] or [[lunar month#Sidereal month|sidereal month]]s.  Venus's period is, however, ''less than 8'' [[lunar month#Synodic month|synodic month]]s&lt;/ref&gt; and Mercury's between 2 and 3 months.  The Moon's sphere, however, revolves around the Earth in a period of one month, and moves with it around the Sun like an [[epicycle]].

===The apparent motion of the Sun===
This section explains how the apparent motion of the Sun could arise from three separate motions of the Earth.  The first motion is a uniform revolution, with a period of one year, from west to east along a circular orbit whose centre is offset from the Sun by 1/25 of the orbit's radius.

The second motion is the daily rotation about an axis which passes through the Earth's centre and is inclined at an angle of about 23{{frac|1|2}}° to the perpendicular to the plane of its orbit.

The third motion is a [[precession]] of the Earth's axis of rotation about an axis perpendicular to the plane of its orbit.  Copernicus specified the rate of this precession with respect to the radial line from the Earth to the centre of its orbit as being slightly less than a year, with an implied direction as being from west to east.   ''With respect to the fixed stars'', this precession is very slow, and in the opposite direction—from east to west—and explains the phenomenon of the [[axial precession|precession of the equinoxes]].

===Equal motion should be measured not by the equinoxes but by the fixed stars===
Here Copernicus asserts that the motion of the equinoxes and celestial poles has not been uniform, and argues that consequently they should not be used to define the reference frame with respect to which the motions of the planets are measured, and that the periods of the various planetary motions  are more accurately determinable if those motions are measured with respect to the fixed stars.  He maintains that he had found the length of the [[sidereal year]] to have always been 365 days 6 hours and 10 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;A value that lies within one minute of what it is now.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Moon===
[[File:Commentariolus moon.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.35|Diagram of the moon's orbit, as described by Copernicus in his ''Commentariolus'']]
Including the annual revolution around the Sun, which the Moon shares with the Earth in his system, 
Copernicus explains the Moon's motion as composed of five independent motions. Its motion around the Earth lies in a plane which is inclined at an angle of 5° to the plane of the Earth's orbit, and which precesses from east to west around an axis perpendicular to that plane, with a period of between 18 and 19 years with respect to the fixed stars.  The remaining three motions, which take place within this orbital plane, are depicted in the diagram to the right.  The first of these is that of the first, and larger, of two [[epicycle]]s, whose center (represented by the point e1 in the diagram) moves uniformly from west to east around the circumference of a [[deferent]] centred on the Earth (represented by point T in the diagram), with a period of one [[lunar month#Draconitic month|draconitic month]].&lt;ref&gt;The period referred to here is the time between two successive passages of the epicycle's centre through its ascending node (represented in the diagram by the point W), or two successive passages through its descending node (represented in the diagram by the point E). Copernicus does not always distinguish which periods and which types of month he is referring to, but these can be inferred from our knowledge of the actual motion of the moon.&lt;/ref&gt;  The centre of the second, smaller epicycle (represented by the point e2 in the diagram) moves uniformly from east to west around the circumference of the first so that the period of the angle β in the diagram is one [[lunar month#Anomalistic month|anomalistic month]].&lt;ref&gt;Swerdlow ([[#CITEREFSwerdlow1973|1973]], pp.456–7).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moon itself, represented by the point M in the diagram, moves uniformly from west to east around the circumference of the second epicycle so that the period of the angle γ is half a [[synodic month]].&lt;ref&gt;Swerdlow ([[#CITEREFSwerdlow1973|1973]], pp.456–7).&lt;/ref&gt;  Copernicus states that whenever the point e1 lies on the line joining the Earth to the centre of its orbit (represented by the dotted line OTC in the diagram, of which only the point T here lies in the Moon's orbital plane), the Moon M will lie precisely between e1 and e2.  However, this can occur only once every 19 years, when this line coincides with the line of nodes WTE.  At other times it does not lie in the moon's orbital plane and the point e1 cannot therefore pass through it. In general, then, while the Moon will be ''close to'' conjunction or opposition to the Sun whenever it lies precisely between e1 and e2, these events will not be precisely simultaneous.

The ratio which Copernicus took as that for the relative lengths of the small epicycle, large epicycle and deferent is 4:19:180.

===The outer planets, Saturn, Jupiter and Mars===
The theories Copernicus gives in the ''Commentariolus'' for the motions of the outer planets all have the same general structure, and only differ in the values of the various parameters needed to specify their motions completely.   Their orbits are not [[coplanar]] with that of the Earth, but do share its centre as their own common centre, and lie in planes that are only slightly inclined to the Earth's orbital plane.  Unlike the Moon's orbital plane, those of the superior planets do not precess.  Their inclinations to the Earth's orbital plane do oscillate, however, between the limits 0°10′ and 1°50′ for Mars, 1°15′ and 1°40′ for Jupiter, and 2°15′ and 2°40′ for Saturn.  Although Copernicus supposes these oscillations to take place around the orbits' [[line of nodes|lines of nodes]] that he assumes to remain fixed, the mechanism he uses to model them does cause tiny oscillations in the  lines of nodes as well.  As Kepler later pointed out, the necessity for assuming oscillations in the inclinations of the outer planets' orbital planes is an artefact of Copernicus's having taken them as passing through the centre of the Earth's orbit.  If he had taken them as passing through the Sun, he would not have needed to introduce these oscillations.&lt;ref&gt;Swerdlow ([[#CITEFSwerlow1973|1973]], p.486).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Commentariolus outer planets.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.5|Diagram of an outer planet's orbit, as described by Copernicus in his ''Commentariolus'']]
Like the Moon's motion, that of the outer planets, represented in the diagram to the right, is produced by a combination of a deferent and two epicycles. The centre of the first, and larger of the two epicycles, represented by the point e1 in the diagram, revolves uniformly from west to east around the circumference of a deferent whose centre is the centre of the Earth's orbit, represented by the point &lt;span style="text-decoration: overline"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt; in the diagram, with a period relative to the fixed stars as given in the section ''[[#The order of the spheres|The order of the spheres]]'' above.

The centre of the second epicycle, represented by the point e2 in the diagram, revolves uniformly from east to west around the circumference of the first, with the same period relative to the radial line joining &lt;span style="text-decoration: overline"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt; to e1.   As a consequence, the direction of the radial line joining e1 to e2 remains fixed relative to the fixed stars, parallel to the planet's [[apse line|line of apses]] EW, and the point e2 describes an eccentric circle&lt;ref&gt;That is, a circle whose centre is offset from what would be regarded as the natural centre of the planet's orbit—in this case, the centre of the Earth's orbit.&lt;/ref&gt; whose radius is equal to that of the deferent, and whose centre, represented by the point O in the diagram, is offset from that of the deferent by the radius of the first epiycle.  In his later work, ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'', Copernicus uses this eccentric circle directly, rather than representing it as a combination of a deferent and an epicycle.

The planet itself, represented by the point P in the diagram, revolves uniformly from west to east around the circumference of the second epicycle, whose radius is exactly one third of that of the first, at twice the rate of revolution of e1 about &lt;span style="text-decoration: overline"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;.  This device enabled Copernicus to dispense with the [[equant]], a much-criticised feature of [[Geocentric model#Ptolemaic model|Claudius Ptolemy's theories]] for the motions of the outer planets.   In a heliocentric version of Ptolemy's models, his equant would lie at the point Q in the diagram, offset along the line of apses EW from the point &lt;span style="text-decoration: overline"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt; by a distance one and a third times the radius of Copernicus's first epicycle.  The centre of the planet's deferent, with the same radius as Copernicus's, would lie at the point C, mid-way between &lt;span style="text-decoration: overline"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt; and Q.  The planet itself would lie at the point of intersection of this deferent with the line QP.  While this point only coincides exactly with P whenever they are both at an [[apsis]],&lt;ref&gt;At all other times it will lie strictly between Q and P.&lt;/ref&gt; the difference between their positions is always negligible in comparison with the inaccuracies inherent to both theories.

For the ratios of the radii of the outer planets' deferents to radius of the Earth, the ''Commentariolus'' gives 1{{frac|13|25}} for Mars, 5{{frac|13|60}} for Jupiter, and 9{{frac|7|30}} for Saturn.  For the ratios of the radii of their deferents to the radii of the larger of their epicycles, it gives 6{{frac|138|167}} for Mars, 12{{frac|553|606}} for Jupiter, and 11{{frac|859|1181}} for Saturn.&lt;ref&gt;Copernicus does not give these ratios directly, but expresses the radii of the planets' deferents and epicycles in terms of a unit of length which is {{frac|1|25}}th of the radius of the Earth's orbit.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venus===
In the last two sections Copernicus talks about Venus and Mercury. The first has a system of circles and takes 9 months to complete a revolution.

===Mercury===
Mercury's orbit is harder than any of the other planets' to study because it is visible for only a few days a year. Mercury, just like Venus, has two epicycles, one greater than another. It takes almost three months to complete a revolution.

'''Cum sole''' is a Latin phrase meaning ''with the sun''. The term is sometimes used in [[meteorology]] and [[physical oceanography]] to refer to [[anticyclonic]] motion, which is [[clockwise]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and [[counterclockwise]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] (but ''with'' the sun's apparent motion when facing [[Equator]] in both [[hemispheres of the Earth|hemispheres]]) (Pond and Pickard, 1983).&lt;ref name=pon83&gt;{{cite book | year=1983 | title=Introductory dynamical oceanography (2nd ed.) | author=Pond |author2=Pickard | isbn=0-7506-2496-5

The opposite of '''Cum sole''' is '''Contra solem''' ([[cyclonic]] motion). Both terms are infrequently used.

'''Edward Francis DeLong''' is a marine [[microbiologist]] and professor in the Department of [[Oceanography]] at the [[University of Hawaii]], [[Manoa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/oceanography/|title=Department of Oceanography at UH Manoa - Home|first=Angelos K. Hannides and Kristin|last=Uyemura|website=www.soest.hawaii.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered a pioneer in the field of [[metagenomics]]. He is best known for his discovery of the bacterial use of the [[rhodopsin]] protein in converting sunlight to biochemical energy in marine microbial communities.

==Early life and education==
DeLong was born in [[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]], [[California]]. He studied biology at [[Santa Rosa Junior College]] and obtained an [[Associate of Science|A.S.]] degree in 1980. While continuing his education at the [[University of California, Davis]], DeLong had originally planned on becoming a medical technologist, but after a meeting and working as an undergraduate researcher with bacteriologist Paul Baumann, he found a new interest in marine microbiology.&lt;ref name="delongOoA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cen.ulaval.ca/merge/pdf/OceansofArchaea.pdf |title=Oceans of Archaea |last=DeLong |first=Edward F |work=[[ASM News]] Volume 69, Number 10, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degree in bacteriology at UCD in 1982 and moved to the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]], where he received a [[Ph.D.]] in [[marine biology]] after finishing doctoral work with Art Yayanos in 1986. DeLong completed his postdoctoral training at [[Indiana University in Bloomington]] with Norman Pace, where he surveyed communities of [[picoplankton]] via [[DNA sequencing]].

==Work==
[[Image:Model of the energy generating mechanism in marine bacteria.jpg|thumbnail|right|280px|Energy gathering mechanism in marine bacteria via ''[[Proteorhodopsin]]''.]]
With Pace and his group at Indiana University, DeLong developed a method that can be used to identify single cells phylogenetically through the use of [[phylogenetic]] stains.&lt;ref name="dcwhite"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://davidcwhite.org/award_research_2009.html |title=David C. White Research and Mentoring Award - 2009 |work=[[Website of David C. White]] February, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[rRNA]]-based probes identify the cells based on the binding of fluorescent probes to individual cells through use of [[oligonucleotides]] that are complementary to [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S]] rRNA sequences of specific phylogenetic groups. The use of multiple probes with different fluorescent dyes allows for the identification of different cell types in the same field.

DeLong subsequently expanded upon this work and applied [[gene cloning]] and sequencing to the study of complex marine microbial communities and their role in the [[biosphere]]. These techniques carried significance in that microbes could be studied without the use of a standard [[microbial culture]].

After receiving an independent study award in 1989, DeLong spent some time at the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute]] in [[Woods Hole]], [[Massachusetts]], and would later on become [[Associate Professor]] in the Biology and Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology Departments at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]. DeLong’s surveys during his time at UCSB led him to participate in the study of widespread abundance and diversity of marine [[archaea]] in the world’s oceans. Prior to 1992, archaea were thought only to exist in the extreme environments of [[hypersaline]] lakes, [[hydrothermal vents]], and similar places. This changed the general view of the scientific community on the role of archaea in the biosphere and opened up new possibilities in applied potential of such microbial assemblages.

In the years following, DeLong’s work took him to the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute]] and it is during his time there that he made a crucial discovery in the understanding of the Earth’s carbon and energy cycles. A team of microbiologists led by DeLong discovered a gene in several species of bacteria&lt;ref name="AcASM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academy.asm.org/index.php/fellows/news-a-views/interviews-with-fellows/152-ed-delong- |title=Interviews with Fellows |work=[[American Academy of Microbiology]] |accessdate=02-01-2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; responsible for production of the protein [[rhodopsin]], previously unheard of in the domain [[Bacteria]]. These proteins found in the cell membranes are capable of converting light energy to biochemical energy due to a change in configuration of the rhodopsin molecule as sunlight strikes it, causing the pumping of a [[proton]] from inside out and a subsequent inflow that generates the energy.&lt;ref name="PopSci"&gt;''Bacteria with Batteries'', Popular Science magazine, January 2001, Page 55.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, DeLong moved to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he worked on developing gene expression studies targeting microbial communities in the wild.  At MIT, his collaborations with CMORE and  Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute colleagues, he discovered of highly synchronized microbial populations having oscillating patterns of gene expression&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25013074 ]&lt;/ref&gt;  across many species.  In 2014, DeLong relocated to the University of Hawaii, where he serves as Co-Director for the Center for Microbial Oceanography: Research and Education, C-MORE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmore.soest.hawaii.edu|title=Center for Microbial Oceanography – Research and Education|website=cmore.soest.hawaii.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Simons Collaboration on Ocean Processes and Ecology,  SCOPE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scope.soest.hawaii.edu|title=Simons Collaboration on Ocean Processes and Ecology (SCOPE)|website=scope.soest.hawaii.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flamelet-Generated Manifold''' ('''FGM''') is a [[combustion]] [[combustion models for CFD|chemistry reduction technique]]{{dubious|date=November 2015}}.&lt;ref&gt;J.A. van Oijen &amp; L.P.H. de Goey, Modelling of Premixed Laminar Flames using Flamelet-Generated Manifolds, Combustion Science and Technology. Volume 161, Issue 1, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The approach of FGM is based on the idea that the most important aspects of the internal structure of the flame front should be taken into account. In this view, a low-dimensional chemical manifold is created on the basis of one-dimensional flame structures, including nearly all of the transport and chemical phenomena as observed in three-dimensional flames. In addition, the progress of the flame is generally described by transport equations for a limited number of control variables.

'''Gerard Smets''' (''fl.'' October 31, 1888 – 1890) was a [[Belgian]] [[paleontologist]], [[scientist]] and [[abbé]] known for the misidentification of the [[plant]] [[genus]] ''[[Aachenosaurus]]'', named after the locale of [[Aachen]] in [[Belgium]].

Smets was most likely born in or near [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] before 1855.

==History of the ''Aachenosaurus''==
''Aachenosaurus'' was found and named by Smets on October 31, 1888, who named the type species  ''Aachenosaurus multidens''.  Based on these fragments he determined that the specimen was a [[hadrosaur]] reaching an estimated 4 to 5 meters in length which might have had dermal spines.&lt;ref name="Smets"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smets |first=G. |date=1888 |title=Notices palaeontologiques |journal=Ann. Soc. Science Brussels (Bulletin de la société Belge de Géologie de Paléontologie &amp; D'Hydrologie) |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=193–214}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defended this conclusion, citing that the fossils had been examined visually with the naked eye, magnifying lenses and with the microscope. However, his error was soon demonstrated by [[Louis Dollo]]. Smets at first tried to defend his original identification but was again proven wrong by a neutral commission and withdrew from science completely from pure embarrassment.&lt;ref name="Wright2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Wright|title=The Naming of the Shrew: A Curious History of Latin Names|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qWDGBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47|year=2014|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4088-2035-3|pages=47–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cofounder Drost has described the program as, "optimized for people who want to be software engineers as their main, day-to-day work. Their life's work."&lt;ref name=Downs131013/&gt; The curriculum focuses on [[JavaScript]] and associated technologies including the MEAN stack, React and Backbone.&lt;ref name="BI130614"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/hot-education-startups-2013-6?op=1|title=12 New Companies That Will Make Going To College Unnecessary|date=14 June 2013|work=[[Business Insider]]|last1=Russell|first1=Kyle|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://techbeacon.com/complete-guide-top-24-coding-bootcamps|title=Complete Guide to the top 24 Coding Bootcamps|website=TechBeacon|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Hack Reactor acquired Austin-based [[MakerSquare]] as "their first deal in a plan to develop a network of coding bootcamps" in an effort to "make a large dent in transforming the old education system into one that focuses on student outcomes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newman|first1=Kira M.|title=Coding Bootcamp Hack Reactor Acquires MakerSquare|url=http://tech.co/coding-bootcamp-hack-reactor-acquires-makersquare-2015-01|website=Tech Cocktail|accessdate=2 July 2015|date=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following month, a pair of Hack Reactor alumni partnered with the company to open Telegraph Academy "to teach software engineering to under-represented minorities" and create a "growing community of diverse software engineers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.telegraphacademy.com/|title=Telegraph Academy the Leading Coding School for People of Color.|website=Telegraph Academy|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dugdale|first1=Emily|title=Berkeley coding school aims to help close tech race gap|url=http://www.berkeleyside.com/2015/06/22/berkeley-coding-school-telegraph-academy-launches-aimed-at-people-of-color/|website=Berkeleyside|accessdate=2 July 2015|date=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, Hack Reactor rebranded all of its schools to share the Hack Reactor name.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc-7.com/story/33548858/hack-reactor-unifies-its-network-of-coding-schools-under-flagship-brand|title=Hack Reactor Unifies Its Network of Coding Schools under Flagship Brand|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Admissions process ==
Hack Reactor's admissions standard has been described as "highly selective, only accepting ten to fifteen percent of applicants for each cohort."&lt;ref name="TGM150411" /&gt; Though many applicants who do not pass the first admission interview are encouraged to try again when they feel they are better prepared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quora.com/Did-Hack-Reactor-become-a-group-full-of-elitists#ans13162184|title=Did Hack Reactor become a group full of elitists?|last1=Pethiyagoda|first1=Ruan|date=9 June 2015|website=Quora|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, Hack Reactor has two admissions paths. Students can either self-study and pass a technical interview or join their Structured Study Program, a live class which includes preparation, readiness assessment and admittance.

The technical interview tests both technical skills (JavaScript basics such as objects, arrays, functions and the ability to solve basic coding problems using JavaScript) and soft skills, such as the student’s willingness and ability to learn.

Hack Reactor has created financial partnerships with SkillsFund and Climb Credit and to assist students with paying tuition.&lt;ref name="hackreactor.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hackreactor.com/questions|title=FAQ|website=Coding Bootcamp in San Francisco. JavaScript focused programming school.|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, [[WeFinance]] and Reactor Core (Hack Reactor's parent company) have launched a platform that allows anyone to lend to incoming students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wefinance.co/group/reactor_core|title=Lend to the Reactor Core Family|website=www.wefinance.co|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Course Structure ==
Accepted students are assigned pre-course work, which takes "at least 50-80 hours" and is due prior to the start of their cohort.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Hack Reactor’s course is offered in 12-week full-time and 9-month part-time formats. During the first half of the program, students work in pairs on two-day “sprints.” Pair and group work helps teach communication and collaboration skills. During this part of the course, the day typically starts with a “toy problem,” which is a programming challenge designed to illustrate core concepts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.computerpoweruser.com/article/19555/qa-with-phillip-alexander|title=Q&amp;A with Phillip Alexander|last=|first=|date=2016-12-28|website=Computer Power User|publisher=Computer Power User|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is followed by a lecture in which the instructor frequently checks in with students to assess how well they understand the material.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The JavaScript tools and technologies taught at Hack Reactor include [[AngularJS|Angular]], [[Node.js|Node]], [[MongoDB]], [[Express.js|Express]], [[React (JavaScript library)|React]], [[Backbone.js|Backbone]] and [[ECMAScript|ES6]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursereport.com/blog/hack-reactor-vs-makersquare-your-ultimate-guide|title=Hack Reactor vs MakerSquare: Your Ultimate Guide|website=www.coursereport.com|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of this part of the course is for students to become “autonomous learners and programmers.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursereport.com/schools/hack-reactor#/news/instructor-spotlight-fred-zirdung-of-hack-reactor|title=Hack Reactor Reviews {{!}} Course Report|website=www.coursereport.com|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second half of the course focuses on projects. Students complete “increasingly elaborate” coding projects of their own design, using whatever languages and frameworks they choose. Students often adopt technologies not taught in the course using “fundamentals and self-teaching methods” taught in the first half of the course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://techbeacon.com/complete-guide-top-24-coding-bootcamps|title=Complete guide to the top 24 coding bootcamps|website=TechBeacon|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Student Outcomes ==
Co-Founder Shawn Drost says that Hack Reactor is "committed to being the leading coding immersive in terms of quality, student experience and student outcomes." In 2017, they joined a 501(c)(6) non-profit organization called the Council on Integrity in Results Reporting (CIRR) as a founding member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hackreactor.com/blog/hack-reactor-cirr-outcomes-reporting|title=CIRR Raises the Bar in Student Outcomes Reporting|work=Hack Reactor|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; CIRR requires members to report "the outcomes of every enrolled student must be reported in a single, simple, clear report" using common standards and follow "CIRR Truth in Advertising policies".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cirr.org/standards|title=High standards and a commitment to transparency and accountability. - Council on Integrity in Results Reporting (CIRR)|website=cirr.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hack Reactor Remote ==
In July 2014, Hack Reactor launched an online program, Hack Reactor Remote. This program has the same curriculum, course structure and teaching method as Hack Reactor’s onsite program. Students attend and participate in the lectures at the same time as the other students, work on the same assignments, and benefit from the same job search and placement resources as the onsite program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/06/16/hack-reactor-is-launching-an-online-coding-bootcamp-but-you-still-need-to-quit-life-to-do-it/|title=Hack Reactor is launching an online coding bootcamp, but you still need to quit life to do it|website=VentureBeat|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hack Reactor's Remote program has comparable student outcomes to its in-person campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hackreactor.com/outcomes|title=Student Outcomes &amp; Graduate Performance|website=Hack Reactor|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Hack Reactor began offering a part-time version of their remote program, known as Hack Reactor Remote Part-Time.

== MakerSquare Acquisition ==
In January 2015, Hack Reactor acquired coding bootcamp MakerSquare, which had locations in Austin and San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/01/coding-bootcamp-boom-continues-hack-reactor-buy/|title=Hack Reactor Expands Its Code Bootcamps by Acquiring a Rival|website=WIRED|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; MakerSquare has since expanded into Los Angeles and New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-makersquare-los-angeles-20150408-story.html|title=MakerSquare to open L.A. campus to train software engineers|last=Times|first=Los Angeles|website=latimes.com|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/makersquare-school-of-software-engineering-launches-new-york-city-campus-300233910.html|title=MakerSquare School of Software Engineering Launches New York City Campus|last=|first=|date=10 March 2016|website=PR Newswire|publisher=PR Newswire|access-date=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MakerSquare has the same admissions process, hiring partner network, and the same curriculum with a few small modifications.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In November 2016, they rebranded to share the Hack Reactor name.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Social Responsibility ==

=== Code.7370 ===
In collaboration with The Last Mile, Hack Reactor launched Code.7370, a coding program in San Quentin State Prison. Inmates have to apply to be a part of the program. Once accepted, they learn HTML, CSS, Python and JavaScript for 8 hours a day, 4 days a week.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fastcoexist.com/3038589/the-prison-coding-class-that-might-have-inmates-making-six-figures-on-their-release|title=The Prison Coding Class That Might Have Inmates Making Six Figures On Their Release|date=2014-11-17|website=Co.Exist|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hack Reactor instructors volunteered as teachers. In addition to class time students are also given time to work on personal projects.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Because inmates are not permitted access to the internet, Code.7370 operates by a proprietary programming platform that simulates a normal web environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thelastmile.org/|title=The Last Mile – Paving The Road to Success|website=thelastmile.org|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of Code.7370 is to reduce recidivism and help felons reenter the workforce.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17487">'''High resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS)''' is a tool used in [[surface science]]. The [[inelastic scattering]] of [[electron]]s from surfaces is utilized to study electronic excitations or vibrational modes of the surface or of molecules adsorbed to a surface. Hence in contrast to other electron energy loss spectroscopies ([[EELS]]) HREELS deals with small energy losses in the range of 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; eV to 1 eV.
It plays an important role in the investigation of surface structure, [[catalysis]], [[dispersion relation|dispersion]] of surface [[phonon]]s and the monitoring of [[epitaxy|epitaxial growth]].

==Overview of HREELS==
[[Image:HREELS spectrum.gif|thumb|215px|right|HREELSpectrum showing surface phonons at 15 and 38 meV (The appearance of peaks on both sides of the elastic scattering peak can be understood by looking at [[Raman scattering|Raman spectroscopy]])]]
In general electron energy loss spectroscopy is based on the energy losses of electrons when inelastically scattered on matter. An incident beam of electrons with a known energy (E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) is scattered on a sample. The scattering of these electrons can excite the electronic structure of the sample. If this is the case the scattered electron loses the specific energy (ΔE) needed to cause the excitation. Those scattering processes are called inelastic. It may be easiest to imagine that the energy loss is for example due to an excitation of an electron from an atomic K-shell to the M-shell. The energy for this excitation is taken away from the electron's kinetic energy.
Then the energies of the scattered electrons (E&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) are measured and the energy loss can be calculated. From the measured data an intensity versus energy loss diagram is established. In the case of scattering on phonons the so-called energy loss can also be a gain of energy (see: [[Raman scattering|Raman spectroscopy]]).
These energy losses allow, using comparison to other experiments, or theory, to draw conclusion about surface properties of the sample.

Excitations of the surface structure are usually very low energetic ranging from 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; eV to 10 eV. In spectra electrons with only small energy losses, like also Raman scattering, the interesting features are all located very close together and especially near to the very strong elastic scattering peak. Hence the used spectrometers require a  high resolution. Therefore, this regime of EELS is called High Resolution EELS.
In this context resolution shall be defined as the energy difference in which two features in a spectrum are just distinguishable divided by the mean energy of those features: &lt;math&gt; \Delta E / E &lt;/math&gt;

In the case of EELS the first thing to think of in order to achieve high resolution is using incident electrons of a very precisely defined energy and a high quality analyzer.
Further high resolution is only possible when the energies of the incident electrons are not far bigger than the energy losses. For HREELS the energy of the incident electrons is therefore mostly significantly smaller than 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; eV.

Considering that 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; eV electrons have a mean free path of around 1&amp;nbsp;nm (corresponds to a few monolayers), which is decreasing with lower energies, this automatically implies that HREELS is a surface sensitive technique.
This is the reason why HREELS must be measured in reflection and has to be implemented in [[ultra high vacuum]] (UHV). In contrast to e.g. Core Level EELS which operates at very high energies and can therefore also be found in [[Transmission electron microscopy|transmission electron microscopes]] (TEM).

In HREELS not only the electron energy loss can be measured, often the angular distribution, of electrons of a certain energy loss, in reference to the specular direction gives interesting insight to the structures on the surface.

==Physics of HREELS==
As mentioned above HREELS involves an inelastic scattering process on a surface. For those processes the conservation of energy as well as the conservation of momentum’s projection parallel to the surface hold:
{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt; E_{i} =  E_{s} + \Delta E &lt;/math&gt;
|}
{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt; k_{i,||} =  k_{s,||} + q_{||} + G &lt;/math&gt;
|}

E are energies, k and q are wave vectors and G denotes a reciprocal lattice vector. One should mention at this point that for non perfect surfaces G is not in any case a well defined quantum number, what has to be considered when using the second relation. Variables subscripted with i denote values of incident electrons those subscripted with s values of scattered electrons. “||” denotes parallel to the surface.

For the description of the inelastic scattering processes due to the excitation of vibrational modes of adsorbates different approaches exist.
The simplest approach distinguishes between regimes of small and large scattering angles:

===Dipole scattering===
[[Image:HREELS dipole scattering.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Figurative interpretation of dipole scattering]]
The so-called dipole scattering can be applied when the scattered beam is very near to the specular direction. In this case a macroscopic theory can be applied to explain the results. It can be approached using the so-called dielectrical theory of which a quantum mechanical treatment was first presented by E. Evans and D.L. Mills in the early 1970s. Or by a more unformular model which exactly only holds for perfect conductors:
A unit cell at the surface does not have homogenous surrounding hence it is supposed to have an electrical dipole moment. When a molecule is adsorbed to the surface there can be an additional dipole moment and the total dipole moment P is present. This dipole moment causes a long range electronic potential in the vacuum above the surface. On this potential the incident electron can scatter inelastically which means it excites vibrations in the dipole structure. The dipole moment can then be written as &lt;math&gt; P + p e^{I \omega t} &lt;/math&gt;. When the adsorbate sticks to a metal surface imaginary dipoles occur as shown in the figure on the right. Hence for an adsorbed dipole normal to the surface the dipole moment “seen” from the vacuum doubles. Whereas the dipole moment of a parallel to the surface adsorbed dipole vanishes. Hence an incident electron can excite the adsorbed dipole only when it is adsorbed normal to the surface and the vibrational mode can be detected in the energy loss spectrum. If the dipole is adsorbed parallel then no energy losses will be detected and the vibrational modes of the dipole are missing in the energy loss spectrum.

The dielectric model holds also when the material on which the molecule adsorbs is not a metal. The picture shown above is then the limit for &lt;math&gt; \epsilon \rightarrow \infty &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt; denotes the relative dielectrical constant.
When measuring the intensity of the electron energy loss peaks and comparing to other experimental results or to theoretical models it can also be told whether a molecule is adsorbed normal to the surface or tilted by an angle.

As the incident electron in this model has to be scattered in the region above the surface it does not come to a direct impact at the surface and as the amount of momentum transferred is therefore small the scattering of is very much into the specular direction.

===Impact scattering===
Impact scattering is the regime which deals with electrons that are scattered further away from the specular direction. In those cases no macroscopic theory exists and a [[microscopic theory]] like, [[quantum mechanical dispersion theory]], has to be applied. Symmetry considerations then also result in certain selection rules (They assume that the energy loss in the inelastic scattering process is negligible): 
* When the scattering plane is a plane of reflection symmetry then the scattering amplitude for every k&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; in the scattering plane vanishes.
* When the plane perpendicular to the surface and the scattering plane is a plane of reflection symmetry and time reversal symmetry holds then the scattering amplitudes in specular direction vanishes for modes whose normal coordinates are odd under the reflection.
* When the axis normal to the surface is an axis of twofold symmetry, and time reversal symmetry holds then the scattering amplitudes in specular direction vanishes for modes whose normal modes are odd under the twofold rotation.
All those selection rules make it possible to identify the normal coordinates of the adsorbed molecules.

===Intermediate negative ion resonance===
Intermediate negative ion resonance: The electron forms a compound state with an adsorbed molecule during the scattering process. But the lifetime of those states are so short that this type of scattering is barely observed.
All of those regimes can at once be described with the help of the single microscopic theory the selection rule find their origins that in symmetry considerations.

==Selection rules for dipole scattering from the perspective of vibrational eigenmodes==
A microscopic theory makes it for example possible to approach the selection rule for dipole scattering in a more exact way. The scattering cross section is only none vanishing in the case of a nonzero matrix element
&lt;math&gt; \left\langle i \right| p_{z} \left| f \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;.
Where i denotes the initial and f the final vibrational mode of the adsorbed molecule and p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; the z component of its dipole moment.

As the dipole moment is something like charge times length p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; has the same symmetry properties as z, which is totally symmetric. Hence the product of i and f has to be a totally symmetric function, too, otherwise the matrix element would vanish. Hence

&lt;center&gt;
''excitations from the totally symmetrical ground state of a molecule are only possible to a totally symmetric vibrational state.''
&lt;/center&gt;

This is the surface selection rule for dipole scattering. Note that it says nothing about how big the intensity for scattering is nor that of the displacement of the atoms of the adsorbate but its total dipole moment is the operator in the matrix element. This is important as a vibration of the atoms parallel to the surface can cause a vibration of the dipole moment normal to the surface, too. So the result in the section "dipole scattering" was not exactly correct.

When trying to gain information from selection rules it has to be carefully considered whether really a pure dipole or impact scattering region is investigated.
Further symmetry breaking due to strong bindings to the surface must be considered. 
Another problem is that in cases of bigger molecules often many vibrational modes are degenerate, which could again be resolved due to strong molecule surface interactions.
Those interactions can also generate completely new dipole moments which the molecule normally does not have. But when investigating carefully it is due to analysis of normal dipole modes mostly possible to get a very good picture of how the molecule adheres to the surface.

==High resolution electron energy loss spectrometer==
[[File:HREELS Spectrometer.svg|thumb|300px|right|Principle of a HREELS setup]]
As the electrons used for HREELS are of low energy they do not only have a very short mean free path length in the sample materials but also under normal atmospheric conditions. Therefore, one has to set up the spectrometer in UHV.
The spectrometer is in general a computer simulated design that optimizes the resolution while keeping an acceptable electron flux.

The electrons are generated in an electron source, by heating a tungsten cathode, which is encapsulated by a negatively charged so called repeller that prevents stray electrons from coming into the detector unit. The electrons can leave the source only through a lens system, like e.g. a slot lens system consisting of several slits all on different potential. The purpose of this system is to focus the electrons on the entrance of the monochromator unit, to get a high initial electron flux.

The monochromator is usually a [[concentric hemispherical analyser]] (CHA). In more sensitive setups an additional pre-monochromator is used. The task of the monochromator is to reduce the energy of the passing electrons to some eV due to the help of electron lenses. It further lets only those electrons pass which have the chosen initial energy. To achieve a good resolution it is already important to have incident electrons of a well defined energy one normally chooses a resolution of &lt;math&gt; \frac{\Delta E_M}{E_i} &lt;/math&gt; for the monochromator. This means, the electrons leaving the monochromator with e.g. 10 eV have an energy accurate to 10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; eV. The beam’s flux is then in the orders of 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; A to 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; A. The radii of the CHA are in the order of several 10&amp;nbsp;mm. And the deflector electrodes have a saw tooth profile to backscatter electrons which are reflected from the walls in order to reduce the background of electrons with the wrong E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. The electrons are then focused by a lens system onto the sample. These lenses are, in contrary to those of the emitter system very flexible, as it is important is to get a good focus on the sample. To enable measurements of angular distributions all those elements are mounted on a rotate able table with the axis cantered at the sample.Its negative charge causes the electron beam to broaden. What can be prevented by charging the top and bottom plates of the CHA deflectors negative. What again causes a change in the deflection angle and has to be considered when designing the experiment.

In the scattering process at the sample the electrons can lose energies from several 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; eV up to a few electron volt. The scattered electron beam which is of around 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; lower flux than the incident beam then enters, the analyzer, another CHA.

The analyzer CHA again allows only electrons of certain energies to pass to the analyzing unit, a [[channel electron multiplier]] (CEM). For this analyzing CHA the same facts are valid as for the monochromator. Except that a &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{2/5} &lt;/math&gt; higher resolution as in the monochromator is wanted. Hence the radial dimensions of this CHA are mostly bigger by like a factor 2. Due to aberrations of the lens systems the beam has also broadened. To sustain a high enough electron flux to the analyzer the apertures are also about a factor 2 bigger. To make the analysis more accurate, especially to reduce the background of in the deflector scattered electrons often two analyzers are used, or additional apertures are added behind the analyzers as scattered electrons of the wrong energy normally leave the CHAs under large angles. In this way energy losses of 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; eV to 10 eV can be detected with accuracies of about 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; eV.

===General problems of HREEL spectrometers===
Due to the electron flux the apertures can become negatively charged, which makes them effectively smaller for the passing electrons. This has to be considered when doing the design of the setup as it is anyway difficult to  keep different potentials, of repeller, lenses, screening elements, and the reflector, constant. 
Unstable potentials on lenses or CHA deflectors would cause fluctuations in the measured signal. Similar problems are caused by external electric or magnetic fields, either they cause fluctuations in the signal, or add a constant offset. That is why the sample is normally shielded by equipotential, metal electrodes to keep the region of the sample field free so that neither the probe electrons nor the sample is affected by external electric fields. Further a cylinder of a material with a high magnetic permeability, e.g. [[Mu-metal]], built around the whole spectrometer to keep magnetic fields or field inhomogeneties at the experiment down to 10 mG or 1mG/cm. 
Because of the same reason the whole experiment, except the lenses which are normally made of coated copper, is designed in stainless antimagnetic steel and insulating parts are avoided wherever possible.

In [[physics]], '''horror vacui''', or '''plenism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|l|iː|n|ɪ|z|əm}}), is commonly stated as "'''Nature abhors a vacuum'''". It is a postulate attributed to [[Aristotle]], who articulated a belief, later criticized by the [[atomism]] of [[Epicurus]] and [[Lucretius]], that nature contains no vacuums because the denser surrounding material continuum would immediately fill the rarity of an incipient void.&lt;ref name="Physica"&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/physics/book4.html#section32 |title=Physics |at=IV, 6–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued against the void in a more abstract sense (as "separable"), for example, that by definition a void, itself, is nothing, and following [[Plato]], nothing cannot rightly be said to exist. Furthermore, insofar as it would be featureless, it could neither be encountered by the senses, nor could its supposition lend additional explanatory power. [[Hero of Alexandria]] challenged the theory in the first century CE, but his attempts to create an artificial vacuum failed.&lt;ref name="genz"&gt;{{cite book |last=Genz |first=Henning |year=1999 |origyear=1994 |title=Nothingness, the Science of Empty Space |edition=translated from German by Karin Heusch |location=New York |publisher=Perseus |isbn=978-0-7382-0610-3 |oclc=48836264 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was debated in the context of 17th-century [[fluid mechanics]], by [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Robert Boyle]],&lt;ref name="Shapin2011"&gt;{{cite book |first=S. |last=Shapin |first2=S. |last2=Schaffer |year=2011 |origyear=1989 |title=Leviathan and the Air-Pump: Hobbes, Boyle, and the Experimental Life |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9781400838493 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U0WYRhODPLAC&amp;pg=PA9 |pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others, and through the early 18th century by [[Sir Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]].&lt;ref name="sep-newton-stm"&gt;{{cite web |first=Robert |last=Rynasiewicz |editor=Edward N.

==Origin==
{{quote|In a void, no one could say why a thing once set in motion should stop anywhere; for why should it stop here rather than here? So that a thing will either be at rest or must be moved ad infinitum, unless something more powerful gets in its way.

Further, things are now thought to move into the void because it yields; but in a void this quality is present equally everywhere, so that things should move in all directions.

Further, the truth of what we assert is plain from the following considerations. We see the same weight or body moving faster than another for two reasons, either because there is a difference in what it moves through, as between water, air, and earth, or because, other things being equal, the moving body differs from the other owing to excess of weight or of lightness.

Now the medium causes a difference because it impedes the moving thing, most of all if it is moving in the opposite direction, but in a secondary degree even if it is at rest; and especially a medium that is not easily divided, i.e. a medium that is somewhat dense. ''A'', then, will move through ''B'' in time ''G'', and through ''D'', which is thinner, in time ''E'' (if the length of ''B'' is equal to ''D''), in proportion to the density of the hindering body. For let ''B'' be water and ''D'' air; then by so much as air is thinner and more incorporeal than water, ''A'' will move through ''D'' faster than through ''B''. Let the speed have the same ratio to the speed, then, that air has to water. Then if air is twice as thin, the body will traverse ''B'' in twice the time that it does ''D'', and the time ''G'' will be twice the time ''E''. And always, by so much as the medium is more incorporeal and less resistant and more easily divided, the faster will be the movement.

Now there is no ratio in which the void is exceeded by body, as there is no ratio of 0 to a number. For if 4 exceeds 3 by 1, and 2 by more than 1, and 1 by still more than it exceeds 2, still there is no ratio by which it exceeds 0; for that which exceeds must be divisible into the excess + that which is exceeded, so that will be what it exceeds 0 by + 0. For this reason, too, a line does not exceed a point unless it is composed of points! Similarly the void can bear no ratio to the full, and therefore neither can movement through the one to movement through the other, but if a thing moves through the thickest medium such and such a distance in such and such a time, it moves through the void with a speed beyond any ratio. For let ''Z'' be void, equal in magnitude to ''B'' and to ''D''. Then if ''A'' is to traverse and move through it in a certain time, ''H'', a time less than ''E'', however, the void will bear this ratio to the full. But in a time equal to ''H'', ''A'' will traverse the part ''O'' of ''A''. And it will surely also traverse in that time any substance ''Z'' which exceeds air in thickness in the ratio which the time ''E'' bears to the time ''H''. For if the body ''Z'' be as much thinner than ''D'' as ''E'' exceeds ''H'', ''A'', if it moves through ''Z'', will traverse it in a time inverse to the speed of the movement, i.e. in a time equal to ''H''. If, then, there is no body in ''Z'', ''A'' will traverse ''Z'' still more quickly. But we supposed that its traverse of ''Z'' when ''Z'' was void occupied the time ''H''. So that it will traverse ''Z'' in an equal time whether ''Z'' be full or void. But this is impossible. It is plain, then, that if there is a time in which it will move through any part of the void, this impossible result will follow: it will be found to traverse a certain distance, whether this be full or void, in an equal time; for there will be some body which is in the same ratio to the other body as the time is to the time.&lt;ref name="Physica"/&gt;|Aristotle|''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', Book IV, section 8}}

Galileo was surprised by the fact that water could not rise above a certain level in an aspiration tube in his [[suction pump]], leading him to conclude that there is a limit to the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Dugas1988"&gt;{{cite book|author=René Dugas|title=A history of mechanics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jmKxffjQtasC&amp;pg=PA144|accessdate=9 July 2011|year=1988|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-65632-8|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[René Descartes]] proposed a plenic interpretation of atomism to eliminate the void, which he considered incompatible with his concept of space.&lt;ref name="sep-newton-stm"/&gt; The theory was rejected by later scientists, such as Galileo's pupil [[Evangelista Torricelli]] who repeated his experiment with [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]. [[Blaise Pascal]] successfully repeated Galileo's and Torricelli's experiment and foresaw no reason why a perfect vacuum could not be achieved in principle. Scottish philosopher [[Thomas Carlyle]] mentioned Pascal's experiment in the [[Edinburgh Encyclopedia]] in an 1823 article titled "Pascal".&lt;ref name=Pascal&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlyle|first=Thomas|title=Sartor Resartus, The Life and Opinions of Herr Teufelsdröckh in Three Books|year=2000|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, California|isbn=0-520-20928-1|page=282|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GE3L1nKRLNkC&amp;pg=PA282&amp;dq=gargantua+aristotle+nature+abhors+a+vacuum&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iDEyUvO3COKdigKh8oEQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=gargantua%20aristotle%20nature%20abhors%20a%20vacuum&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Magdeburg hemispheres]] used by [[Otto von Guericke]] in 1650 were seen by some as proof that the theory was not correct.{{cn|date=July 2012}}

[[James Clerk Maxwell]] subscribed to this philosophy when he argued forcefully for the existence of the [[luminiferous aether]] in his 1861 [[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field|electromagnetic theory of light]].

Ordinary water ice is known as [[ice Ih|ice I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;]],  (in the [[Percy Williams Bridgman|Bridgman]] nomenclature).  Different types of ice, from [[ice II]] to ice XVI, have been created in the laboratory at different temperatures and pressures.

On 14 June, 2009, Christoph Salzmann at the University of Oxford and colleagues reported having created ice XV and say that its properties differ significantly from those predicted.

The '''International Union of Crystallography''' ('''IUCr''') is an organisation devoted to the international promotion and coordination of the science of [[crystallography]]. The IUCr is a member of the [[International Council for Science|International Council for Science (ICSU)]].

== Objectives ==
The objectives of the IUCr are to promote international cooperation in [[crystallography]] and to contribute to all aspects of crystallography, to promote international publication of crystallographic research, to facilitate standardization of methods, units, nomenclatures and symbols, and to form a focus for the relations of crystallography to other sciences.

The IUCr fulfils these objectives by publishing in print and electronically primary scientific journals through ''Crystallography Journals Online'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''Crystallography Journals Online'' |url=http://journals.iucr.org/ |website=Crystallography Journals Online |publisher=The International Union of Crystallography}}&lt;/ref&gt; the series of reference volumes ''International Tables for Crystallography'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=International Tables for Crystallography |url=http://it.iucr.org/ |website=International Tables for Crystallography |publisher=International Union of Crystallography}}&lt;/ref&gt; distributing the quarterly ''IUCr Newsletter'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IUCr Newsletter |url=http://www.iucr.org/news/newsletter |website=IUCr Newsletter |publisher=The International Union of Crystallography}}&lt;/ref&gt; maintaining the online ''World Directory/Database of Crystallographers'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World Directory of Crystallographers |url=http://www.iucr.org/people/wdc |website=World Directory of Crystallographers |publisher=The International Union of Crystallography}}&lt;/ref&gt; awarding the ''Ewald Prize''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Ewald Prize |url=http://www.iucr.org/iucr/ewald-prize |website=The Ewald Prize |publisher=The International Union of Crystallography}}&lt;/ref&gt; and organising the triennial ''Congress and General Assembly''.

== History ==
&lt;ref name="IUCr_history" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ewald (editor) |first1=Paul P |title=The Consolidation of the New Crystallography |url=http://www.iucr.org/publ/50yearsofxraydiffraction/full-text/consolidation |publisher=The International Union of Crystallography}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1944 the yearly meeting of the X-ray Analysis Group (XRAG) of the UK [[Institute of Physics]] was held in Oxford, and the distinguished German crystallographer [[Paul Peter Ewald]], who then taught at [[Queen's University Belfast]], was invited to give the evening lecture. In it he gave a historical survey of some of the stages in the evolution of [[X-ray crystallography]] and ended with a strong plea for the formation of an international society or union which would represent, and unify publication for, the new science. This idea was followed up by the British crystallographers, and particularly by Sir [[Lawrence Bragg]], the Chairman of XRAG. In June 1946, within a year of the termination of fighting in [[WWII]], he arranged for an international meeting of crystallographers in London which was attended by some 120 scientists from most of the allied countries.&lt;ref&gt;With one very distinguished exception, the German physicist [[Max von Laue]], who won the 1914 Nobel Prize for his discovery of [[X-ray diffraction]] in crystals, who's invitation and acceptance required some degree of political and personal courage by both Bragg and von Laue.&lt;/ref&gt; In that London meeting Ewald was elected Chairman of the Provisional International Crystallographic Committee, which put into action the decision to form the International Union of Crystallography. Sir [[Lawrence Bragg]] was the first formally elected President of this IUCr,&lt;ref name="IUCr_history"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kamminga |first1=Harmke |title=The International Union of Crystallography: its formation and early development |journal=Acta Crystallogr. |date=1989 |volume=A45 |pages=581–601 |url=http://www.iucr.org/iucr/history/early-history}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Ralph Walter Graystone Wyckoff]] &lt;ref name="RWGW-bio"&gt;"Ralph W. G. Wyckoff 1897-1994," ''Acta Crystallogr''. (1995). A51, 649-650. Accessed online at http://ww1.iucr.org/people/wyckoff.htm on 3/23/2010&lt;/ref&gt; and Arne Westgren &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Obituary: Arne  Westgren  1889-1975 |url=http://journals.iucr.org/a/issues/1976/01/00/a28677/a28677.pdf |publisher=The International Union of Crystallography}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Vice-Presidents. Ewald was elected as 5th President of the IUCr, the 'international society or union' that he had originally conceived, in 1960.

== IUCr Symmetry notation ==
The IUCr notation is the notation for the symmetry group adopted by the International Union of Crystallography in 1952. It identifies members of the [[Wallpaper group]] with a 4 character name. First it has a ''P'' or ''C'' for ''primitive'' or ''centered'' groups. Groups are denoted by a number 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 for the highest order of symmetry. Groups can have one or two reflections, denoted as vertical mirrors first (horizontal reflection), and horizontal second (vertical reflection). A simple reflection is denoted by an ''m'' (mirror), and a glide-reflection is denoted by a ''g''. Place holder ''1'' denotes an orthogonal direction with no reflections.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3108">In [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical physics]], an '''invariant''' is a property of a system which remains unchanged under some [[Transformation (mathematics)|transformation]].

==Examples==
{{See also|Lorentz scalar}}
In the current era, the immobility of [[Polaris]] (the North Star) under the [[diurnal motion]] of the [[celestial sphere]] is a classical illustration of physical invariance.

{{Quotation|For example the rule describing Newton's force of gravity between two chunks of matter is the same whether they are in this galaxy or another ([[translational invariance]] in space). It is also the same today as it was a million years ago (translational invariance in time). The law does not work differently depending on whether one chunk is east or north of the other one ([[rotational invariance]]). Nor does the law have to be changed depending on whether you measure the force between the two chunks in a railroad station, or do the same experiment with the two chunks on a uniformly moving train ([[principle of relativity]]).|[[David Mermin]]: ''It's About Time - Understanding Einstein's Relativity'', Chapter 1}}

Another example of a physical invariant is the [[speed of light]] under a [[Lorentz transformation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= French |first= A.P. |title= Special Relativity|year= 1968|publisher= W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn= 0-393-09793-5|ref=harvnb}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[time]] under a [[Galilean transformation]]. Such spacetime transformations represent shifts between the [[reference frames]] of different observers.

By [[Noether's theorem]] invariance of the action of a physical system under a [[continuous symmetry]] represents a fundamental [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]]. For example, invariance under translation leads to [[conservation of momentum]], and invariance in time leads to [[conservation of energy]].

Quantities can be invariant under some common transformations but not under others. For example, the velocity of a particle is invariant when switching from rectangular coordinates to curvilinear coordinates, but is not invariant when transforming between frames of reference that are moving with respect to each other. Other quantities, like the speed of light, are always invariant.

==Importance==
Invariants are important in modern theoretical physics, and many theories are expressed in terms of their [[symmetry in physics|symmetries]] and invariants. 

[[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|Covariance and contravariance]] generalize the mathematical properties of [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariance]] in [[tensor|tensor mathematics]], and are frequently used in [[electromagnetism]], [[special relativity]], and [[general relativity]].

When a [[nucleotide]] sequence is written as text using a four-letter alphabet, the repetitiveness of the text, that is, the repetition of its [[N-gram]]s (words), can be calculated and serves as a measure of sequence complexity.

The meaning of LC may be better understood by regarding the presentation of a sequence as a [[Tree (data structure)|tree]] of all subsequences of the given sequence. The most complex sequences have maximally balanced trees, while the measure of imbalance or tree asymmetry serves as a [[Computer linguistics|complexity measure]]. The number of nodes at the tree level {{math|&lt;var&gt;i&lt;/var&gt;}} is equal to the actual vocabulary size of words with the length {{math|&lt;var&gt;i&lt;/var&gt;}} in a given sequence; the number of nodes in the most balanced tree, which corresponds to the most complex sequence of length N, at the tree level {{math|&lt;var&gt;i&lt;/var&gt;}} is either 4&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; or N-j+1, whichever is smaller. Complexity ({{math|&lt;var&gt;C&lt;/var&gt;}}) of a sequence fragment (with a length RW) can be directly calculated as the product of vocabulary-usage measures (U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;):&lt;ref name=Gabrielian1999 /&gt;

{{nb5}} &lt;math&gt;C = U_1 U_2...U_i....U_w &lt;/math&gt;

Vocabulary usage for [[oligomers]] of a given size {{math|&lt;var&gt;i&lt;/var&gt;}} can be defined as the ratio of the actual vocabulary size of a given sequence to the maximal possible vocabulary size for a sequence of that length. For example, U&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for the sequence ACGGGAAGCTGATTCCA = 14/16, as it contains 14 of 16 possible different dinucleotides; U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; for the same sequence = 15/15, and U&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;=14/14. For the sequence ACACACACACACACACA, U&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=1/2; U&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=2/16=0.125, as it has a simple vocabulary of only two dinucleotides; U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; for this sequence = 2/15. k-tuples with k from two to W considered, while W depends on RW. For RW values less than 18, W is equal to 3; for RW less than 67, W is equal to 4; for RW&lt;260, W=5; for RW&lt;1029, W=6, and so on. The value of {{math|&lt;var&gt;C&lt;/var&gt;}} provides a measure of sequence complexity in the range 0&lt;C&lt;1 for various DNA sequence fragments of a given length.&lt;ref name=Gabrielian1999 /&gt;
This formula is different from the original LC measure&lt;ref name=Trifonov1990 /&gt; in two respects: in the way vocabulary usage U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is calculated, and because {{math|&lt;var&gt;i&lt;/var&gt;}} is not in the range of 2 to N-1 but only up to W. This limitation on the range of U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; makes the algorithm substantially more efficient without loss of power.&lt;ref name=Gabrielian1999 /&gt;
In &lt;ref name=TAKLB01&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/18.5.679| title = Sequence complexity profiles of prokaryotic genomic sequences: A fast algorithm for calculating linguistic complexity| journal = Bioinformatics| volume = 18| issue = 5| pages = 679–88| year = 2002| last1 = Troyanskaya | first1 = O. G.| last2 = Arbell | first2 = O.| last3 = Koren | first3 = Y.| last4 = Landau | first4 = G. M.| last5 = Bolshoy | first5 = A. | pmid=12050064}}&lt;/ref&gt; was used another modified version, wherein linguistic complexity (LC) is defined as the ratio of the number of substrings of any length present in the string to the maximum possible number of substrings. Maximum vocabulary over word sizes 1 to m can be calculated according to the simple formula .&lt;ref name=TAKLB01 /&gt;
This sequence analysis complexity calculation can be used to search for conserved regions between compared sequences for the detection of low-complexity regions including simple sequence repeats, imperfect [[Direct repeat|direct]] or [[inverted repeat]]s, polypurine and polypyrimidine [[Triple-stranded DNA|triple-stranded DNA structures]], and four-stranded structures (such as [[G-quadruplex]]es).&lt;ref name=Kalendar2011&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kalendar | first1 = R. | last2 = Lee | first2 = D. | last3 = Schulman | first3 = A.

===North Korean provincial flags===
{{See also|Committee for the Five Northern Korean Provinces}}
As the South Korean government claims the territory of North Korea as its own, provincial flags also exist for the North Korean provinces that are claimed by South Korea. The following are flags of the five Korean provinces located entirely north of the Military Demarcation Line as according to the South Korean government, as it formally claims to be the sole legitimate government of the entire Korean Peninsula.

=== Swedish ===
* ''skyskrapa'' calques ''skyscraper''.
* ''tonåring'' calques English ''teen-ager'': ''fem'''ton''''' = ''fif'''teen''''', ''åring'' = ''annual harvest''

== Slavic languages ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}

=== Serbian ===
* Serbian 'misliti izvan kutije' calques English 'to think outside of the box':
** Sr. 'misliti' = Eng. 'to think'
** Sr. 'izvan' = Eng. 'outside'
** Sr. 'kutija' = Eng. 'box'

=== Macedonian ===
* Macedonian ракопис (''rakopis'') calques Latin-derived 'manuscript' and 'handwriting':
** Mac. root рака (''raka'') = Lat. manus = 'hand'
** Mac. root пис- (''pis-'') = Lat. scribo = 'to write'
* Macedonian правопис (''pravopis'') calques Greek-derived 'orthography':
** Mac. root право (''pravo'') = Gr. ορθός (''orthos'') = 'correct';
** Mac. root пис- (''pis-'') = Gr. γράφειν (''graphein'') = 'to write'
* Macedonian православие (''pravoslavie'') calques Greek-derived 'orthodoxy':
** Mac. root право (''pravo'') = Gr. ορθός (''orthos'') = 'correct';
** Mac. root славие (''slavie'') = Gr. δοξα (''doxa'') = 'glorification'

In more recent times, the Macedonian language has calqued new words from other [[Prestige dialect|prestige languages]] including [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]].

* Macedonian натчовек (''natčovek'') = calques German-derived 'overman' (''[[Übermensch]]'')
** Mac. root над- (''nad-'') = Ger. über = 'over'
** Mac. root човек (''čovek'', man) = Ger. mensch = 'people'
* Macedonian облакодер (''oblakoder'') = calques English ''skyscraper'':
** Mac. root облак (''oblak'', cloud)
** Mac. root дере (''dere'', to flay)
* Macedonian клучен збор (''klučen zbor'') = calques English ''keyword'':
** Mac. root клуч (''kluč'', key)
** Mac. root збор (''zbor'', word)

Some words were originally calqued into [[Russian language|Russian]] and then absorbed into Macedonian, considering the close relatedness of the two languages. Therefore, many of these calques can also be considered [[Russianism]]s.

=== Russian ===
The poet [[Aleksandr Pushkin]] (1799–1837) was perhaps the most influential among the Russian literary figures who would transform the modern Russian language and vastly expand its ability to handle abstract and scientific concepts by importing the sophisticated vocabulary of Western intellectuals.

Although some Western vocabulary entered the language as loanwords – e.g., Italian ''salvietta'', "napkin", was simply Russified in sound and spelling to салфетка (''salfetka'') – Pushkin and those he influenced most often preferred to render foreign borrowings into Russian by calquing. Compound words were broken down to their component roots, which were then translated piece-by-piece to their Slavic equivalents. But not all of the coinages caught on and became permanent additions to the lexicon; for example, любомудрие (''ljubomudrie'') was promoted by 19th-century Russian intellectuals as a calque of "philosophy", but the word eventually fell out of fashion, and modern Russian instead uses the loanword философия (''filosofija'').

* Russian любомудрие (''ljubomudrie'') calqued Greek-derived 'philosophy':
** Russ. root любить (''ljubit' '') = Gr. φιλεῖν (''filein'') = 'to love';
** Russ. root мудрость (''mudrost' '') = Gr. σοφία (''sofia'') = 'wisdom'
* Russian зависимость (''zavisimost' '') calques Latin-derived 'dependence':
** Russ. root за (''za'') = Lat. ''de'' = 'down from'
** Russ. root висеть (''viset' '') = Lat. ''pendere'' = 'to hang; to dangle'
* Russian совпадение (''sovpadenije'') calques Latin-derived 'coincidence':
** Russ. prefix со- (''so'') = Lat. ''co-'' = 'in; with; together'
** Russ. prefix в- (''v'') = Lat. ''in-'' = 'in; into'
** Russ. root падать (''padat' '') = Lat. ''cidere'' = 'to fall'
* Russian полуостров (''poluostrov'') calques German ''Halbinsel'', both meaning 'peninsula':
** Russ. root полу- (''polu-'') = Ger. ''halb'' = 'half; semi-'
** Russ. root остров (''ostrov'') = Ger. ''Insel'' = 'island'
* Russian детский сад (''detskij sad'') calques German ''Kindergarten'', both literally suggesting 'children's garden'

== Greek ==
* ''Διαδίκτυο'' from English Internet
* ''Ποδόσφαιρο'' from English "football", referring specifically to association football
* ''Τηλεόραση'' from Television

== Irish ==
* ''[[uisce beatha]]'' calques Latin ''[[aqua vitae]]'' – The English word '''[[whiskey]]''' is actually derived from this phrase

== Finnish ==
Since Finnish, a [[Uralic languages|Uralic language]], differs radically in pronunciation and orthography from Indo-European languages, most loans adopted in Finnish either are calques or soon become such as foreign words are translated into Finnish. Examples include:
* from Greek: ''sarvikuono'' (rhinoceros, from Greek ρινόκερος "rinokeros"),
* from Latin: ''viisaudenhammas'' (wisdom tooth, from Latin "dens sapientiae"),
* from English: ''jalkapallo'' (English "football", specifically referring to association football),
* from English: ''koripallo'' (English "basketball"),
* from English: ''kovalevy'' (English "hard disk"),
* from French: ''kirpputori'' (flea market, French "marché aux puces"),
* from German: ''lastentarha'' (German "Kindergarten"),
* from German: ''panssarivaunu'' (German "Panzerwagen"),
* from Swedish: ''pesukarhu'' (raccoon, from Swedish "tvättbjörn" and ultimately German "Waschbär"),
* from Swedish: ''moottoritie'' (highway, from Swedish "motorväg" and ultimately German "autobahn"),
* from Chinese: ''aivopesu'' (brainwash, from Chinese "xi nao"),
* from Spanish: ''siniverinen'' (blue-blooded, from Spanish "de sangre azul")

== Modern Hebrew ==
When Jews [[aliyah|immigrate to Israel]], they often [[Hebraization of surnames|Hebraize]] their surnames. One approach to doing so was by calque from the original (often German or Yiddish) surname. For instance, Imi Lichtenfield (itself a half-calque), founder of the martial art [[Krav Maga]], became Imi Sde-Or. Both last names mean "light field". For more examples and other approaches, see the article on [[Hebraization of surnames]].
* ''mesilat barzel'' (obsolete term for railway) from German ''Eisenbahn'' (iron track); "sach-rachok" (a proposed term for telephone that became famous for not catching on) from German "Fernsprecher" (itself a calque from Greek "telephone")
* "zarkor" (searchlight) from German "Scheinwerfer" (light-thrower=&gt;zorek-or, contracted to "zarkor")
* ''iton'' (newspaper) from German and Yiddish ''Zeitung'' (Zeit and Et both mean time or era,first syllable e become i with the -on suffix)
* ''tappuach adamah'' (potato) from French ''pomme-de-terre''
* ''gan yeladim'' from German ''Kindergarten''
* ''kaduregel'' (כדורגל) (football, specifically association football/[[soccer]]) from English ''football''; "kadursal" (basketball); "kaduryad" (handball);...
* "kelev yam" (seal) from German "Seehund" ("sea dog")
* "karnaf" (contraction of "keren af"/"nosehorn") from Greek [[rhinoceros]], possibly via German Nashorn
* names of many chemical elements are calqued from German and/or Greek: "meiman" (hydrogen) from Wasserstoff, "pachman" (carbon) from Kohlstoff, "chankan" (nitrogen) from Stickstoff, "chamtzan" (oxygen) from Sauerstoff, zarkhan (phosphorus) from Greek, ... Some others are derived from Biblical or Mishnaic Hebrew words: kesef (silver), barzel (iron), nechoshet (copper), zahav (gold), oferet (lead), ashlagan (potassium, from "ashlag"=potash),
* many computing terms are calqued from English: "luach em" (motherboard), "me`abed" (processor), "natav" (router), akhbar (mouse), cartis reshet (network card), sapak koach (power supply), mat`en (charger),... Other terms are loanwords: "disq" (disk), ... Yet others are 'native' Hebrew words, either newly coined or adapted from earlier usage: "mikledet" (keyboard "typer"), "madpeset" (printer, by analogy with "mekhonat dfus"/printing press), "reshet" (network, from Hebrew for a net),  ...

According to linguist [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], the more contributing languages have a structurally identical expression, the more likely it is to be calqued into the target language. In Israeli (his term for "Modern Hebrew") one uses ''má nishmà'', lit. "what's heard?", with the meaning of "what's up?". Zuckermann argues that this is a calque not only of the Yiddish expression ''Was hört sich?'' (usually pronounced ''v(o)sérts´kh''), but also of the parallel expressions in Polish, Russian and Romanian. Whereas most revivalists were native Yiddish-speakers, many first speakers of Modern Hebrew spoke Russian and Polish too. So a Polish speaker in the 1930s might have used ''má nishmà'' not (only) due to Yiddish ''Was hört sich?'' but rather (also) due to Polish ''Co słychać?'' A Russian Jew might have used ''ma nishma'' due to ''Что слышно?'' (pronounced ''chto slyshno'') and a Romanian Israeli would echo ''ce se aude''.&lt;ref&gt;See p. 62 in [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] (2009), [http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/Hybridity_versus_Revivability.pdf Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns]. In ''Journal of Language Contact'', Varia 2 (2009), pp. 40–67.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Zuckermann, such multi-sourced calquing is a manifestation of the [[Congruence principle (disambiguation)|Congruence principle]].&lt;ref&gt;See p. 48 in Zuckermann, Ghil'ad, [http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/Hybridity_versus_Revivability.pdf Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns]. In ''Journal of Language Contact'', Varia 2 (2009), pp. 40–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Malayalam ==
Modern Malayalam is replete with calques from English. The calques manifest themselves as idioms and expressions and many have gone on to become clichés. However standalone words are very few. The following is a list of commonly used calque phrases/expressions.All of these are exact translations of the corresponding English phrases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19478">This is a list of software [[package management system]]s, categorized first by package format (binary, source code, hybrid) and then by [[operating system]] family.

==Binary packages==
The following package management systems distribute apps in [[Binary (software)|binary]] [[package (package management system)|package]] form; i.e., all apps are [[Compiler|compiled]] and ready to be installed and use.

===Unix-like===
====Linux====
* [[apk-tools|apk-tools (apk)]]: Alpine Package Keeper, the package manager for [[Alpine Linux]].
* [[dpkg]]: Originally used by [[Debian]] and now by [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]. Uses the [[deb (file format)|.deb format]] and was the first to have a widely known dependency resolution tool, [[Advanced Packaging Tool|APT]]. The [[ncurses]]-based front-end for APT, [[aptitude (software)|aptitude]], is also a popular package manager for Debian-based systems. 
* [[Sabayon Linux#Package management|Entropy]]: used by and created for [[Sabayon Linux]]. It works with binary packages that are bzip2-compressed tar archives (file extension: &lt;code&gt;.tbz2&lt;/code&gt;), that are created using Entropy itself, from tbz2 binaries produced by [[Portage (software)|Portage]] from ebuilds, a type of specialized shell script.

===z/OS===
* [[SMP/E]]

==Source code-based==
The following package management systems distribute the [[source code]] of their apps. Either the user must know how to compile the packages, or they come with a script that automates the compilation process. For example, in [[GoboLinux]] a recipe file contains information on how to download, unpack, compile and install a package using its [[GoboLinux#.22Compile.22 program|Compile]] tool. In both cases, the user must provide the computing power and time needed to compile the app, and is legally responsible for the consequences of compiling the package.

* [[apt-build]] is used by distributions which use [[deb (file format)|deb packages]], allowing automatic compiling and installation of software in a deb source repository.
* [[Sourcemage#Sorcery|Sorcery]] is [[Sourcemage|Sourcemage GNU/Linux]]'s [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]] based package management program that automatically downloads software from their original site and compiles and installs it on the local machine.
* [[Arch Build System|ABS]] is used by [[Arch Linux]] to automate binary packages building from source or even other binary archives, with automatic download and dependency checking.

===macOS (OS X)===
* [[fink]], for [[OS X]], derives partially from dpkg/apt and partially from ports.
* [[MacPorts]], formerly called DarwinPorts, originated from the [[OpenDarwin]] project.
* [[Homebrew (package management software)|Homebrew]], with close Git integration.
* [[pkgsrc]] can be used to install software directly from source-code, or to use the binary packages provided by several independent vendors

== Hybrid systems ==
* [[Nix package manager]]: Package manager that manages software in a [[purely functional programming|purely functional]] way, featuring multi-user support, atomic upgrades and rollbacks. Allows multiple versions or variants of a software to be installed at the same time. It has support for macOS and is cross-distribution in its Linux support.
* [[Portage (software)|Portage]] and [[Portage (software)#Emerge|emerge]] are used by [[Gentoo Linux]], [[Funtoo Linux]], and [[Sabayon Linux]]. It is inspired by the BSD ports system and uses text based "ebuilds" to automatically download, customize, build, and update packages from source code. It has automatic dependency checking and allows multiple versions of a software package to be installed into different "slots" on the same system. Portage also employs "use flags" to allow the user to fully customize a software build to suit the needs of their platform in an automated fashion. While source code distribution and customization is the preferred methodology, some larger packages that would take many hours to compile on a typical desktop computer are also offered as pre-compiled binaries in order to ease installation.
* [[Upkg]]: Package management and build system based on [[Mono (software)|Mono]] and XML specifications. Used by [[Paldo (operating system)|paldo]] and previously by ExTiX Linux.
* [[MacPorts]] (for OS X)
* [[NetBSD]]'s [[pkgsrc]] works on several [[Unix-like]] operating systems, with regular binary packages for macOS and Linux provided by multiple independent vendors.
* [[Collective Knowledge (software)|Collective Knowledge Framework]] is a cross-platform package and workflow framework with JSON API that can download binary packages or build them from sources for Linux, Windows, MacOS and Android platforms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Portable-workflows
| title=Portable and reproducible research workflows
| date=2017-03-27
| accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Meta package managers ==
The following unify package management for several or all Linux and sometimes Unix variants. These, too, are based on the concept of a recipe file.
* [[AppImage]] (previously klik and PortableLinuxApps) aims to provide an easy way to get software packages for most major distributions without the dependency problems so common in many other package formats.
* [[Autopackage]] uses .package files.
* [[Zero Install]] installs each package into its own directory and uses [[environment variable]]s to let each program find its libraries. Package and dependency information is downloaded directly from the software authors' pages in an XML format, similar to an [[RSS]] feed.
* [[PackageKit]] is a set of utilities and libraries for creating applications that can manage packages across multiple package managers using back-ends to call the correct program.

==Proprietary software systems==
A wide variety of package management systems are in common use today by [[proprietary software]] operating systems, handling the installation of both proprietary and free packages.
* [[Software Distributor]] is the [[HP-UX]] package manager.

'''Metal testing''' is a process or procedure used to check composition of an unknown [[metal]]lic substance. There are destructive processes and nondestructive processes. Metal testing can also include, determining the properties of newly forged [[metal alloy]]s. With many [[chemical database|chemical-property databases]] readily available, identification of unmarked pure,common metals can be a quick and easy process. Leaving the original sample in complete, re-usable condition. This type of testing is nondestructive.  When working with alloys (forged mixtures) of metals however, to determine the exact composition, could result in the original sample being separated into its starting materials, then measured and calculated. After the components are known they can be looked up and matched to known alloys. The original sample would be destroyed in the process.  This type of testing is destructive.

==Destructive testing (DT)==

In this kind of testing, the material undergoes mechanical testing and is discarded thereafter. Test results are compared with specifications. Subtypes include:

* Bend test
* Impact test – Further categorised as [[Charpy test]] and [[Izod test]]
* Hardness test
* [[Tensile test]]
* Fatigue test
* Corrosion resistance test
* Wear test

==Nondestructive testing (NDT)==

Raw and finished material undergoes testing according to code specifications such as [[ASME]] Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section V. The tested material is not damaged by the test. Subtypes include:
* Visual testing
* [[Dye penetrant inspection]]
* [[Magnetic particle inspection]]
* [[Radiographic testing]]
* [[Ultrasonic testing]]
* Leak testing
* Eddy current testing
* Remote field electromagnetic testing
* LR UT

'''Mind Sports South Africa (MSSA)''' is recognised by [[Act of Parliament]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/SportRecreation/Documents/National_Sport_RecAct_1998.pdf|title=National Sport and Recreation Act 110 of 1998|publisher=|access-date=10 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913180122/https://www.capetown.gov.za/en/SportRecreation/Documents/National_Sport_RecAct_1998.pdf#|archive-date=13 September 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the national controlling body for [[mind sport]]s in South Africa.

Mind Sports South Africa (MSSA) is also an affiliate of the [[International eSports Federation]], [[Fédération Mondiale du Jeu de Dames]], and the [[International Wargames Federation]]. Due to its membership of such international bodies, the MSSA is the sole authority for the games that it caters for in terms of the Sport and Recreation Act, number 110 of 1998 (as amended).

==History==
Mind Sports South Africa was formally constituted on 14 December 1985. However, it was not until 1990 that the MSSA became a member of NOCSA in 1990, and in 1991 that the MSSA became affiliated to the Confederation of South African Sports Confederation (COSAS).

The MSSA was one of the members that encouraged unity during the [[apartheid]] era, and thus voted in favour of the unifying of sport. As a consequence of the actions of the many National Federations, the National Sports Council was formed in 1994 and was immediately accepted as a full member of the newly formed body. Upon dissolution of the NSC in 1999, the MSSA played its part in supporting the formation of the South African Sports Commission in 1999.

Once the South African Sports Commission was formed (by Act of Parliament) the MSSA again was accepted as a full member. Even when the Minister of Sport and Recreation saw the need to ask Parliament to amend the Sports and Recreation Act (number110 of 1998),&lt;ref name="srsa.gov.za"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srsa.gov.za/MediaLib/Home/DocumentLibrary/464863(3).pdf|title=National Sport and Recreation Act 110 of 1998|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the official recognition of Mind Sports South Africa remained unchanged as the MSSA became a founding member of the [[South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee]] (SASCOC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sascoc.co.za/|title=SASCOC – Official site of the SOUTH AFRICAN SPORTS CONFEDERATION AND OLYMPIC COMMITTEE|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All the games promoted by Mind Sports South Africa are accredited as national sports. Such accreditation by the Sports and Recreation Act (number110 of 1998),&lt;ref name="srsa.gov.za"/&gt; guarantees the MSSA as being the only authority for the administration and control of the games that fall under the MSSA's jurisdiction.

The MSSA changed its name in 2005 from the South African Wargames Union (SAWU) to that of Mind Sports South Africa.

==Structure ==
Mind Sports South Africa, like other sports federations in South Africa, is constituted as a [[voluntary association]].

The highest authority of the MSSA is the Annual General Meeting which holds all Committees accountable for their actions.

The Executive Committee meets a minimum of twice a year, and requires a full report from the Management Board.

The Management Board deals with the day-to-day operations of the MSSA and overseas the different Boards of Control. Clubs are directly affiliated to the MSSA which ensures that there is greater transparency and inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mindsportsa.co.za/|title=Mind Sports South Africa – MSSA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the emblem==
Back in the early 1990s, the South African Wargames Union (as the MSSA was then known) was invited to participate in the World Team Championships for Wargames. Up until that point the MSSA used the rampant lion as its symbol. However, it was felt by the committee to approach the [[Bureau of Heraldry|State Herald]] to design something specifically for the MSSA that best represented the games as administered by the MSSA. The State Herald [[Frederick Brownell]] designed the Janus Knight for the MSSA.

The logo is made up of the following aspects:

The double-headed knight chess piece:
The knight chess piece is already an international symbol for army battle school. The symbol represents tactical and strategic thought and training. By making the symbol a double-headed knight, it also incorporates the concepts of considering the opponent's moves and shows the mental versatility of gamers.

The circle:
The circle represents the rules to which all the games are played, and the unity of all the games that the MSSA represents.

==Disciplines and games under the jurisdiction of the MSSA==
In terms of its Constitution, Mind Sports South Africa caters for a wide variety of Mind Sports in South Africa, such as:

'''Board gaming'''

==Introduction==

A model of teaching is a plan or pattern that can be used to shape curriculum's,to design instructional materials and to guide instruction in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=models of teaching social science|url=http://www.slideshare.net/AileenAsim/models-of-teaching-11201700|ref=slideshare}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance==
* To understand the society in which they live and to learn how it is structured, governed and managed.
* To grow up as an active,responsible and reflective members of society.
* To learn to respect each other's differences of opinion,lifestyle and language.
* To question and examine received ideas,institutions and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Models of teaching social science|url=http://www.ncert.nic.in/new_ncert/ncert/rightside/links/pdf/focus_group/social_sciencel.pdf|ref=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of teaching models ==
* Classroom Teaching- It helps to strengthen one's responsibility to oneself and others.This model has rules and structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=models of teaching social science|url=http://thesecondprinciple.com/teaching-essentials/models-teaching/|ref=webpage}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Graffiti model- In this model the students are asked to given written responses to questions posed by teachers.
* Jigsaw model-This model was started originally in 1960's to facilitate racial integration. This is a co-operative learning technique that reduces racial conflict among students,promotes better learning,improves motivation among students and increases enjoyment of learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Models of teaching social science|url=https://www.jigsaw.org/|ref=webpage}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Role play model-This is a teaching strategy.It is used by teachers especially to help solve interpersonal problems in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Models of teaching social science|url=http://www2.maxwell.syr.edu/plegal/crit3/a1.html|ref=html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as a topical overview of science:

'''[[Science]]''' – the systematic effort of acquiring knowledge—through observation and experimentation coupled with logic and reasoning to find out what can be proved or not proved—and the knowledge thus acquired. The word "science" comes from the Latin word "scientia" meaning [[knowledge]]. A practitioner of science is called a "[[scientist]]". Modern science respects [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] [[logical reasoning]], and follows a set of core procedures or rules in order to determine the nature and underlying natural laws of the universe and everything in it. Some scientists do not know of the rules themselves, but follow them through research policies. These procedures are known as the [[#Scientific method|scientific method]].

{{TOC limit|3}}

== Essence of science ==
* [[Research]] – systematic investigation into existing or new knowledge.
* [[Scientific discovery]] – observation of new phenomena, new actions, or new events and providing new reasoning to explain the knowledge gathered through such observations with previously acquired knowledge from abstract thought and everyday experiences.
* [[Laboratory]] – facility that provides controlled conditions in which scientific research, experiments, and measurement may be performed.
* [[Objectivity (science)|Objectivity]] – the idea that scientists, in attempting to uncover truths about the natural world, must aspire to eliminate personal or cognitive biases, a priori commitments, emotional involvement, etc.
* [[Inquiry]] – any process that has the aim of augmenting knowledge, resolving doubt, or solving a problem.

== Scientific method ==

[[Scientific method]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of scientific method|outline]]) – body of techniques for investigating phenomena and acquiring new knowledge, as well as for correcting and integrating previous knowledge. It is based on observable, empirical, measurable evidence, and subject to laws of reasoning, both deductive and inductive.
* [[Empirical method]] –
* Experimental method – The steps involved in order to produce a reliable and logical conclusion include:
*# Asking a question about a natural [[phenomenon]]
*# Making observations of the phenomenon
*# Forming a [[hypothesis]] – proposed explanation for a phenomenon. For a hypothesis to be a scientific hypothesis, the scientific method requires that one can test it. Scientists generally base scientific hypotheses on previous observations that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available scientific theories. 
*# [[Predicting]] a logical consequence of the hypothesis
*# Testing the hypothesis through an experiment – methodical procedure carried out with the goal of verifying, falsifying, or establishing the validity of a hypothesis. The 3 types of scientific experiments are:
*#* [[Controlled experiment]] – experiment that compares the results obtained from an experimental sample against a control sample, which is practically identical to the experimental sample except for the one aspect the effect of which is being tested (the independent variable).
*#* [[Natural experiment]] – empirical study in which the experimental conditions (i.e., which units receive which treatment) are determined by nature or by other factors out of the control of the experimenters and yet the treatment assignment process is arguably exogenous. Thus, natural experiments are observational studies and are not controlled in the traditional sense of a randomized experiment.
*#** [[Observational study]] – draws inferences about the possible effect of a treatment on subjects, where the assignment of subjects into a treated group versus a control group is outside the control of the investigator.
*#* [[Field experiment]] – applies the scientific method to experimentally examine an intervention in the real world (or as many experimentalists like to say, naturally occurring environments) rather than in the laboratory.  See also [[field research]].
*# Gather and analyze data from experiments or observations, including indicators of [[uncertainty]].
*# Draw [[logical consequence|conclusion]]s by comparing data with predictions.  Possible outcomes:
*#* Conclusive:
*#** The hypothesis is falsified by the data.  
*#** Data are consistent with the hypothesis.
*#** Data are consistent with alternative hypotheses. 
*#* Inconclusive:
*#** Data are not relevant to the hypothesis, or data and predictions are [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurate]].
*#** There is too much uncertainty in the data to draw any conclusion.
* [[Deductive-nomological model]]
* [[Scientific modelling]] –
* Models of scientific method
** [[Hypothetico-deductive model]] – proposed description of scientific method. According to it, scientific inquiry proceeds by formulating a hypothesis in a form that could conceivably be falsified by a test on observable data. A test that could and does run contrary to predictions of the hypothesis is taken as a falsification of the hypothesis. A test that could but does not run contrary to the hypothesis corroborates the theory.

== Branches of science ==
{{See also|Index of branches of science}}

[[Branches of science]] – divisions within science with respect to the entity or system concerned, which typically embodies its own [[terminology]] and [[nomenclature]].

=== Natural science ===
{{See also|Outline of science#Social science}}

[[Natural science]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of natural science|outline]]) – major branch of science, that tries to explain and predict nature's phenomena, based on empirical evidence. In natural science, hypotheses must be verified scientifically to be regarded as scientific theory. Validity, accuracy, and social mechanisms ensuring quality control, such as peer review and repeatability of findings, are amongst the criteria and methods used for this purpose. Natural science can be broken into two main branches: biology, and physical science. Each of these branches, and all of their sub-branches, are referred to as natural sciences.
* [[Branches of natural science]] (also known as the natural sciences)

=== Formal science ===

In the [[natural sciences]], a '''protocol''' is a predefined written [[standard operating procedure|procedural method]] in the design and implementation of [[experiment]]s. Protocols are written whenever it is desirable to standardize a laboratory method to ensure successful [[reproducibility|replication]] of results by others in the same laboratory or by other laboratories. Detailed protocols also facilitate the assessment of results through [[peer review]]. In addition to detailed procedures and lists of required equipment and instruments, protocols often include information on safety precautions, the calculation of results and reporting standards, including statistical analysis and rules for predefining and documenting excluded data to avoid bias. Protocols are employed in a wide range of experimental fields, from [[social science]] to [[quantum mechanics]]. Written protocols are also employed in manufacturing to ensure consistent quality.

== Overview ==
Formal protocol is the general rule in fields of applied science, such as environmental and medical studies that require the coordinated, standardized work of many participants. Such predefined protocols are an essential component of [[Good Laboratory Practice]] (GLP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?cfrpart=58|title=CFR - Code of Federal Regulations Title 21|website=www.accessdata.fda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Good clinical practice|Good Clinical Practice]] (GCP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ich.org/fileadmin/Public_Web_Site/ICH_Products/Guidelines/Efficacy/E6/E6_R1_Guideline.pdf|title=Guideline for Good Clinical Practice E6 R1|date=1996-06-10|publisher=International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for the Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use|accessdate=2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; regulations. Protocols written for use by a specific laboratory may incorporate or reference [[standard operating procedure]]s (SOP) governing general practices required by the laboratory. A protocol may also reference applicable laws and regulations that are applicable to the procedures described. Formal protocols typically require approval by a laboratory official before they are implemented for general use.

In a [[clinical trial]], the protocol is carefully designed to safeguard the health of the participants as well as answer specific research questions. A protocol describes what types of people may participate in the trial; the schedule of tests, procedures, medications, and dosages; and the length of the study. While in a clinical trial, participants following a protocol are seen regularly by research staff to monitor their health and to determine the safety and effectiveness of their treatment. Since 1996, clinical trials conducted are widely expected to conform to and report the information called for in the [[Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials|CONSORT]] Statement, which provides a framework for designing and reporting protocols. Though tailored to health and medicine, ideas in the CONSORT statement are broadly applicable to other fields where experimental research is used. Clearly defined protocols are also required by research funded by the [[National Institutes of Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/info/understand | title = Understanding Clinical Trials | accessdate = 2012-04-21 | work = ClinicalTrials.gov | publisher = National Institute of Health | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120410030741/http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/info/understand | archivedate = 2012-04-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety ==
Safety precautions are a valuable addition to a protocol, and can range from requiring goggles to provisions for containment of microbes, environmental hazards, toxic substances, and volatile solvents. Procedural contingencies in the event of an accident may be included in a protocol or in a referenced [[Standard operating procedure|SOP]].

==Procedures==
Procedural information may include not only safety procedures but also procedures for avoiding contamination, calibration of equipment, equipment testing, documentation, and all other relevant issues. These procedural protocols can be used by skeptics to invalidate any claimed results if flaws are found.

==Equipment==
Equipment testing and documentation includes all necessary specifications, calibrations, operating ranges, etc. Environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, and other factors can often have effects on results. Documenting these factors should be a part of any good procedure.

==Calculations, statistics and bias==
Protocols for methods that produce numerical results generally include detailed formulae for calculation of results. Formula may also be included for preparation of reagents and other solutions required for the work. Methods of [[statistics|statistical analysis]] may be included to guide interpretation of the data. 

Many protocols include provisions for avoiding bias in the interpretation of results. [[Approximation error]] is common to all measurements. These errors can be absolute errors from limitations of the equipment or propagation errors from approximate numbers used in calculations. [[Sample bias]] is the most common and sometimes the hardest bias to quantify. Statisticians often go to great lengths to ensure that the [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] used is representative. For instance political polls are best when restricted to likely voters and this is one of the reasons why web polls cannot be considered scientific. The [[sample size]] is another important concept and can lead to biased data simply due to an unlikely event. A sample size of 10, i.e. polling 10 people, will seldom give valid polling results. [[Standard deviation]] and [[variance]] are concepts used to quantify the likely relevance of a given [[sample size]]. The [[mass media]] and the public often use ''[[average]]'' and ''[[arithmetic mean|mean]]'' values interchangeably, which can lead to dubious and even misleading arguments. The [[placebo effect]] and [[observer bias]] often require an experiment to use a [[double blind]] protocol and a [[control group]].

==Blinded protocols==
A protocol may require blinding to avoid bias. 

: A [[single blind]] protocol requires that the experimenter does not know the identity of samples or animals during the testing and calculations. It is appropriate when no human subjects are involved.

: A [[double blind]] protocol comes into play when human subjects are tested and requires ensuring neither the experimenter nor experimental subjects have knowledge of the identity of the treatments or the results until after the experiment is complete.

:A [[triple blind]] protocol is used when it is required that neither the experimenter, experimental subject(s), nor statisticians have knowledge of the identity of the treatments or the results  until after the experiment is complete.

An experimenter may have latitude defining procedures for blinding and controls but may be required to justify those choices if the results are published or submitted to a regulatory agency. When it is known during the experiment which data was negative there are often reasons to rationalize why that data shouldn't be included. Positive data are rarely rationalized the same way.

== Reporting ==
A protocol may specify reporting requirements. Reporting requirements would include all elements of the experiments design and protocols and any environmental factors or mechanical limitations that might affect the validity of the results.

'''Research and development intensity''' or simply '''R&amp;D intensity''', is generally defined as expenditures by a firm on its research and development ([[R&amp;D]]) divided by the firm's sales. There are two types of R&amp;D intensity: direct and indirect. R&amp;D intensity varies, in general, according to a firm's industry sector, product knowledge, manufacturing, and technology, and is a metric that can be used to gauge the level of a company's investment to spur innovation in and through [[Basic research|basic]] and [[applied research]]. A further aim of R&amp;D spending, ultimately, is to increase [[productivity]] (e.g., [[Factor of production|factor productivity]]) as well as an organization's salable output.

==Definition and aim of metric==
Generally speaking, R&amp;D is seen as a main driver of societal and business innovation.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The [[OECD]]'s ''Frascati Manual'' describes R&amp;D as "creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications."&lt;ref name=OECD02Fr&gt;OECD (2002) ''Frascati Manual 2002: Proposed Standard Practice for Surveys on Research and Experimental Development, The Measurement of Scientific and Technological Activities,'' p. 30, Paris, FR: OECD Publishing, DOI 10.1787/9789264199040-en, see [http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/frascati-manual-2002_9789264199040-en], accessed 13 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

R&amp;D expenditure and R&amp;D intensity are two of the key indicators used to monitor resources devoted to science and technology worldwide.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} R&amp;D intensity has been defined as "the ratio of expenditures by a firm on research and development to the firm's sales."&lt;ref name=Meyer05&gt;{{cite news|author=Meyer, Peter B. (Editor)|date=2005|title=R&amp;D intensity|work=Glossary of Research Economics|url=http://econterms.com/econtent.html|accessdate= October 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Leonard has described research intensity as "measured usually by ratios of scientific personnel to total employment or by R&amp;D expenditures/sales" to gains in such variables as productivity, profits, sales, and asset status.&lt;ref name=Leonard71/&gt; R&amp;D intensity is therefore a measure of a company's [[R&amp;D]] spending toward activities aimed at expanding sector and product knowledge, manufacturing, and technology,{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} and so aimed at spurring innovation in and through basic and applied research.&lt;ref name=CohenLevinthal90&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Cohen, Wesley M. &amp; Levinthal, Daniel A. |date=1990|title=Absorptive Capacity: A New Perspective on Learning and Innovation|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|volume=35|pages= 128–152|doi=10.2307/2393553}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Burgelman0208&gt;{{cite news|authors=Burgelman, Robert A. &amp; Christensen, Clayton &amp; Wheelwright, Steven |date=2008|title=Strategic Management of Technology and Innovation|edition= 5th |pages=748–772|location= New York, NY|publisher= McGraw-Hill|isbn= 9780073381541 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it is aimed at increasing "[[Factor of production|factor]] [[productivity]] and salable output".&lt;ref name=Leonard71&gt;{{cite journal | jstor = 1832108 |journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume= 79|number= 2; March–April|date=1971|title= Research and Development in Industrial Growth |author=William N.

There are two types of R&amp;D intensity, calculated as follows:&lt;ref name="European Commission"/&gt;
* Direct R&amp;D intensity, calculated by dividing R&amp;D expenditure by output
* Indirect R&amp;D intensity, which quantifies the R&amp;D expenditure embodied in the intermediate goods used in the production of another sector and can be calculated using Input-Output Tables

==In enterprises and companies==
As the [[National Science Foundation]] explains: absolute levels of "R&amp;D expenditures indicate the level of effort dedicated to producing future products and process improvements while maintaining current [[market share]] and increasing operating [[efficiency]]. By extension, such expenditures may reflect firms' perceptions of the market's demand for new and improved technology."  However, R&amp;D intensity is the most frequently used measure "to gauge the relative importance of R&amp;D across industries and among firms in the same industry."&lt;ref name=NSF10&gt;{{cite book |last1=NSF |author-link1=National Science Foundation |year=2010 |chapter= Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages (Ch. 4) |title= Science and Engineering Indicators 2010 |location= Arlington, VA, USA|publisher= National Science Foundation, National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, National Science Board | url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind10/c4/c4h.htm | page= |access-date= 13 October 2015  }}{{page needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2015}} Economic research on sixteen industries by William Leonard, "the relation [between investment and gains] appears two years after R&amp;D spending and increases thereafter", although research intensity relates "less effectively" to "[[Human resources|manpower]] ratios [ratios of scientific personnel to total employment]."&lt;ref name=Leonard71/&gt;

==Among sectors==
R&amp;D intensity differs between different sectors: [[High tech|high-tech]] sectors (such as aircraft &amp; spacecraft, electrical equipment, and pharmaceuticals) are characterized by the highest R&amp;D intensity, while [[Low tech|low-tech]] sectors (such as food products, iron and steel, and textiles) usually have low R&amp;D intensity.&lt;ref name="European Commission"&gt;{{cite web|title=Reviewing the nomenclature for high-technology trade – the sectoral approach|url=http://www.oecd.org/std/its/41419823.ppt|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, R&amp;D intensity could be used as the sole indicator to identify high-tech sectors.&lt;ref name="European Commission"/&gt;

==By countries and regions==
R&amp;D intensity for a ''country'' or larger political or geographical entity is defined as its R&amp;D expenditure as a percentage of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the entity. Generally speaking, developed countries have higher R&amp;D intensities than developing countries.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} As Eurostat noted in 2013, for a preceding period,{{when|date=October 2015}}{{quote|1=The European Union (EU) is currently lagging behind both the USA and Japan in terms of expenditure on R&amp;D as a proportion of GDP, primarily due to slow relative growth in business R&amp;D expenditure. The European Council set an overall target of 3% of GDP by the year 2010, with industry asked to contribute two thirds of this objective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anon.|date=2013|title=Glossary: R&amp;D intensity|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:R_%26_D_intensity|publisher=Eurostat|accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

GERD can be broken down among four sectors of performance: business enterprise, higher education, government, and private not-for-profit institutions serving households (PNP).&lt;ref name=OECD13&gt;OECD (2013).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9221">The '''selectorate theory''' is detailed in ''The Logic of Political Survival'', authored by [[Bruce Bueno de Mesquita]] of [[New York University]] (NYU), Alastair Smith of NYU, Randolph M. Siverson of [[UC Davis]], and [[James D. Morrow]] of the [[University of Michigan]].

==Overview==
In selectorate theory, three groups of people affect leaders. These groups are the nominal selectorate, the real selectorate, and the winning coalition. The nominal selectorate, also referred to as the interchangeables, includes every person who has some say in choosing the leader (for example, in an American presidential election, all registered voters). The real selectorate, also referred to as the influentials, are those who really choose the leaders (for example, in an American presidential election, those people who cast a vote). The winning coalition, also referred to as the essentials, are those whose support translates into victory (for example, in an American presidential election, those voters that get a candidate to 270 [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] votes). In other countries, leaders may stay in power with the support of much smaller numbers of people, such as senior figures in the security forces, and business oligarchs, in contemporary Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Applebaum, Anne. "How He and His Cronies Stole Russia." [[The New York Review of Books]] [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2014/12/18/how-he-and-his-cronies-stole-russia/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental premise in selectorate theory is that the primary goal of a leader is to remain in power. To remain in power, leaders must maintain their winning coalition. When the winning coalition is small, as in autocracies, the leader will tend to use private goods to satisfy the coalition. When the winning coalition is large, as in democracies, the leader will tend to use public goods to satisfy the coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=''[[The Dictator's Handbook: Why Bad Behavior is Almost Always Good Politics]]''|last=Bueno de Mesquita|first=Bruce|authorlink=Bruce Bueno de Mesquita|last2=Smith|first2=Alastair|publisher=[[PublicAffairs]]|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Dictator's Handbook]]'', Bueno de Mesquita and Smith state five rules that leaders should use to stay in power: (1) The smaller the winning coalition the fewer people to satisfy to remain in control. (2) Having a large nominal selectorate gives a pool of potential people to replace dissenters in coalition. (3) Maintain control of revenue flows to redistribute to your friends. (4) But only pay friends enough that they will not consider overthrowing you and at the same time little enough so that they depend on you. (5) Don't take your friends' money and redistribute it to the masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=''[[The Dictator's Handbook: Why Bad Behavior is Almost Always Good Politics]]''|last=Bueno de Mesquita|first=Bruce|authorlink=Bruce Bueno de Mesquita|last2=Smith|first2=Alastair|publisher=[[PublicAffairs]]|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution of goods==
A [[public good]] is one that everyone enjoys non-exclusively such as national defense or clean water. A [[private good]] is a good that is enjoyed exclusively by a select few, usually within the winning coalition, and cannot be shared. An example of such a good would be anything exclusionary, such as cash or legal impunity.

It can be said, then, that everyone in the selectorate, including the winning coalition, reap the benefits of public goods while only those within the winning coalition enjoy private goods.

==Government types, leaders, and challenger threats==
According to the selectorate theory, a leader has the greatest chance of political survival when the selectorate is large and the winning coalition is small, which occurs in an [[autocracy]]. This is because those who are in a winning coalition can easily be replaced by other members of the selectorate who are not in the winning coalition. Thus, the costs of defection for those members of the winning coalition can be potentially large, namely the loss of all private goods. Similarly, the chances of a challenger in replacing the leader are similarly smallest in such an autocratic system since those in the winning coalition would be hard pressed to defect. The ratio of private to public goods as payoff to the winning coalition is the highest in such a system.

A [[monarchy]], where the selectorate is small and the winning coalition is even smaller, provides a challenger with a greater opportunity to overthrow the current leader. This is because the proportion of selectorate members who are also in the winning coalition is relatively large. That is, if a new leader comes to power, chances are a given member of the winning coalition will remain within the coalition. The incentive for defection to attain a greater amount of goods offered by a challenger is not, in this case, outweighed by the risk of not being included in the new winning coalition. Here, the proportion of private goods in relation to public goods is seen declining.

A scenario in which both the winning coalition is large and the selectorate is even larger provides the least amount of stability to a leader’s occupancy of power; such a system is a [[democracy]]. Here, the proportion of public goods outweighs private goods simply because of the sheer size of the winning coalition; it would be far too costly to provide private goods to every individual member of the winning coalition when the benefits of public goods would be enjoyed by all. Because of this fact—that the leader cannot convince winning coalition members to remain loyal through private good incentives, which are in turn cost-restrictive—the challenger poses the greatest threat to the incumbent. This degree of loyalty to the incumbent leader, whatever the government structure may be, is called the loyalty norm.

A scenario where the winning coalition is large and the selectorate is small is logically impossible since the winning coalition is a subset of the selectorate.

== Implication of selectorate theory ==
Bruce Bueno de Mesquita and Alastair Smith further applied the selectorate theory to the field of foreign aid. The fundamental reason behind foreign aid practice, as the selectorate theory suggests, is to improve the survival of political leaders in both donor and recipient states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mesquita|first=Bruce Bueno de|last2=Smith|first2=Alastair|date=2009-04-01|title=A Political Economy of Aid|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/political-economy-of-aid/3C886EB47B1B8CC7657ACF6DEED0808B|journal=International Organization|volume=63|issue=2|pages=336|doi=10.1017/S0020818309090109|issn=1531-5088}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that the size of leader's winning coalition and government revenues affect leader's decision making on policy concession and aid. By analyzing the bilateral aid transfers by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) nations between 1960 and 2001, they discovered that leaders in aid recipient countries are more likely to grant policy concession for donors when the winning coalition is small because leaders with small winning coalitions can easily reimburse supporters for their concession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mesquita|first=Bruce Bueno de|last2=Smith|first2=Alastair|date=2009-04-01|title=A Political Economy of Aid|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/political-economy-of-aid/3C886EB47B1B8CC7657ACF6DEED0808B|journal=International Organization|volume=63|issue=2|pages=309–310|doi=10.1017/S0020818309090109|issn=1531-5088}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, relatively poor, small coalition systems are most likely to get aid. The conclusion of their study shows that interest exchange is the primary reason for foreign aid practice and OECD members have little humanitarian motivation for aid giving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mesquita|first=Bruce Bueno de|last2=Smith|first2=Alastair|date=2009-04-01|title=A Political Economy of Aid|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/political-economy-of-aid/3C886EB47B1B8CC7657ACF6DEED0808B|journal=International Organization|volume=63|issue=2|pages=335|doi=10.1017/S0020818309090109|issn=1531-5088}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nancy Qian]]'s study supported this conclusion by arguing that “The literature shows that the primary purpose of aid is often not to alleviate poverty and that out of all of the foreign aid flows, only 1.69% to 5.25% are given to the poorest twenty percent of countries in any given year"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nancy|first=Qian|date=2014|title="Making Progress on Foreign Aid."|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nq3/NANCYS_Yale_Website/resources/papers/Aid_20140816_FINAL.pdf|journal=Annual Review of Economics|volume=3|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Silo''' is a computer [[file format|data format]] and [[Library (computing)|library]] developed at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL) for storing [[rectilinear grid|rectilinear]], curvilinear, unstructured, or point [[Polygon mesh|meshes]] in 2D and 3D.  It supports data upon those meshes, including scalar, vector, and tensor variables; volume fraction-based materials; and mass fraction-based species. It fully supports block structured [[adaptive mesh refinement]] (AMR) meshes by way of mesh blocks structured in a hierarchy.  Silo sits on top of other low-level storage libraries such as PDB, [[NetCDF]], and [[HDF5]].

Currently, [[VisIt]], an [[open source software]] package with its start at LLNL, supports the Silo format for [[Scientific visualization|visualization]] and analysis, among many other formats.

As of Version 4.8, July, 2010, the Silo source code is now available
under the standard BSD Open Source License.

The source code for two compression libraries which have been part of
previous releases of the Silo library is not available under the
terms of the BSD Open Source license. These are the Hzip and FPzip
compression libraries.

For this reason, two different releases of the Silo source code are
made available.

'''Stephen Wolff''' is one of the many fathers of the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name=PostelAward-2002/&gt; He is mainly credited with turning the Internet from a government project into something that proved to have scholarly and commercial interest for the rest of the world. Dr. Wolff realized before most the potential in the Internet and began selling the idea that the Internet could have a profound effect on both the commercial and academic world.

== Education ==
Stephen Wolff earned a BSc with Highest Honors in Electrical Engineering from [[Swarthmore College]] in 1957, and a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from [[Princeton University]] in 1961. In 1962 he continued his studies with post-doctoral work at [[Imperial College]]. He taught electrical engineering at the [[Johns Hopkins University]] for ten years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apan.net/meetings/ChiangMai2012/Session/MedicalWG/Health2/Bio_data_StephenWolff.pdf "Biography of Stephen S. Wolff"], Session information for the 33rd Asia-Pacific Advanced Network (APAN) meeting in Chiang Mai, Thailand, 13-17 February 2012, accessed 19 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PostelAward-2002"/&gt;

== Contributions to the Internet ==
For fourteen years, Wolff worked as a communications and technology researcher for the [[United States Army]]. While working for the Army, Wolff introduced the [[UNIX]] operating system to Army labs in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=Cisco2002/&gt; Also while working for the Army, Wolff managed a research group that participated in the development of [[ARPANET]], a major technology precursor to the Internet.&lt;ref name=Cisco2002&gt;[http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/ts_073002.html "Stephen Wolff -- Hustling for Innovation: Cisco Employee Receives ISOC Award for Contributions to Internet Development"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120225414/http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/ts_073002.html |date=2011-01-20 }}, Charles Waltner, Cisco Inc., 30 July 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Wolff became Division Director for Networking and Communications Research and Infrastructure at the [[National Science Foundation]] where he managed the [[NSFNET]] project which included a national backbone network in the U.S. that interconnected NSF sponsored supercomputing centers, regional research and education networks, federal agency networks, and international research and education networks. The five super computing centers were located at Princeton, Cornell, the University of California at San Diego, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and the University of Pittsburgh. Wolff also managed grants to link the nation's universities together into regional networks that connected to the backbone and so provided universal connectivity to the academic community. The NSFNET was compatible with, interconnected to, and eventually replaced the ARPANET network.&lt;ref&gt;Banks, Michael. [http://www.apress.com/9781430208693 ''On the Way to the Web'']. New York: Apress, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolff also conceived the Gigabit Testbed, a joint NSF-[[DARPA]] project designed to prove the feasibility of IP networking at gigabit speeds.&lt;ref&gt;Cerf, Vinton, et al. [http://www.internetsociety.org/internet/internet-51/history-internet/brief-history-internet#wolff "A Brief History of the Internet"]. Internet Society. 10 December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Wolff left NSF and joined [[Cisco]] where he helped with projects such as [[Internet2]] and the [[Abilene Network]]. Wolff's career at Cisco began as business development manager for the Academic Research and Technology Initiative program. There Wolff helped advance the University Research Project (URP) which supports academic research candidates with grants to further networking technology.&lt;ref name=Cisco2002/&gt; He was named the interim Vice President and Chief Technology Officer of [[Internet2]] on March 31, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Bass, Ryan. [https://lists.internet2.edu/sympa/arc/i2-news/2011-03/msg00002.html "Steve Wolff Named New Internet2 Interim Vice President and Chief Technology Officer"]. 31 Mar 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The World in Six Songs: How the Musical Brain Created Human Nature''''' is a [[popular science]] book written by the [[McGill University]] [[neuroscientist]] [[Daniel J. Levitin]], and first published by [[Dutton Penguin]] in the U.S. and Canada in 2008, and updated and released in paperback by Plume in 2009, and translated into six languages. Levitin’s second ''New York Times'' bestseller, following the publication of ''[[This Is Your Brain on Music]]'', received praise from a wide variety of readers including Sir [[George Martin]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Elizabeth Gilbert]], and [[Adam Gopnik]]. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it "masterful". The ''[[New York Times]]'' wrote: "A lively, ambitious new book whose combined elements can induce feelings of enlightenment and euphoria. Will leave you awestruck."&lt;ref name="Itzkoff"&gt;Itzkoff, D. (2008, August 31). "Book Review". ''[[The New York Times]]'', p. BR5.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' wrote "Levitin is such an enthusiastic anthropologist, such an exuberant song and dance man, such a natural-born associative thinker, that you gotta love the guy." &lt;ref name="Finlayson"&gt;Finlayson, I. (2009, April 18). "Book Review". ''[[The Times of London|The Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; It was named one of the best books of 2008 by the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' and by ''[[Seed Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name="Seed"&gt;Seed Magazine (2008, December 23). "SeedPicks 2008". ''[[Seed Magazine]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

''The World in Six Songs'' combines science and art to reveal how music shaped humanity across cultures and throughout history. This book leans more heavily on [[anthropology]] and [[evolutionary biology]] than did ''This Is Your Brain On Music'', which skewed more toward findings in [[psychoacoustics]] and [[neuroscience]].

Levitin identifies six fundamental song functions or types (friendship, joy, comfort, religion, knowledge, and love) then shows how each in its own way has enabled the social bonding necessary for human culture and society to evolve. He shows, in effect, how these six song types function in our brains to preserve the emotional and literal history of our lives and species. Levitin illuminates, through songs, how music has been instrumental in the evolution of language, thought and culture. Musical examples ranging from [[Beethoven]] to [[The Beatles]], [[Busta Rhymes]] to [[Bach]], are used to support the book's propositions.

Using cutting-edge scientific research from his music cognition lab at [[McGill University]]; his own experiences in the music business; and interviews with musicians such as Sting and [[David Byrne]], as well as conductors, anthropologists, and evolutionary biologists.

'''UFO [[conspiracy theories]]''' argue that various [[governments]], and [[politicians]] globally, most notably the officials of [[Washington, D.C.]], are suppressing [[evidence]] of extraterrestrial [[unidentified flying objects]] and alien visitors. Such conspiracy theories commonly argue that Earth governments, especially the [[Federal government of the United States|Government of the United States]], are in communication and/or cooperation with [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrials]] despite public claims to the contrary, and further that some of these theories claim that the governments are [[explicit knowledge|explicitly]] allowing [[alien abduction]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2002/may/05/spaceexploration.research Paul Harris: Cold War hysteria sparked UFO obsession, study finds]&lt;/ref&gt;

Various UFO conspiracy ideas have flourished on the [[internet]] and were frequently featured on [[Art Bell]]'s program, ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Genoni Jr., Thomas C., Peddling the Paranormal: Late-Night Radio's Art Bell, ''[[Skeptical Briefs]]'', [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]], volume 8, issue #1, March 1998 http://www.csicop.org/sb/show/peddling_the_paranormal_late-night_radios_art_bell/&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[MUFON]], the [[National Enquirer]] reported that a survey found 76% of participants felt the government was not revealing all it knew about UFOs, 54% thought UFOs definitely or probably existed, and 32% thought UFOs came from outer space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mufon.com/znews_publicopinion.html |title=Public Opinion Surveys and Unidentified Flying Objects 50+ years of Sampling Public Opinions |publisher=Mutual UFO Network |date=January 2000 |author=John F.

==Chronology==

===1930s===
On the night before [[Halloween]] in 1938, [[Orson Welles]] directed ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]'' live radio adaptation of [[H. G. Wells]]'s classic novel, ''[[The War of the Worlds (novel)|The War of the Worlds]]''. By mimicking a [[news]] broadcast, the show was quite realistic sounding for its time, and some listeners were fooled into thinking that a [[Martian]] invasion was underway in the United States. Widespread confusion was followed by outrage and controversy. Some later studies{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} have argued that the contemporary press exaggerated the extent of the panic, but it remains clear that many people were caught up, to some degree, in the confusion.

In other countries, reactions were similar. In 1949, part of the script for ''The War of the Worlds'' was read out over the radio in Quito, Ecuador without announcement, as if it were a major piece of breaking news. Huge crowds of people emerged onto the streets and sought refuge inside churches with their families. When the radio station was informed of this, its announcers broadcast the fact that  no invasion was happening. An angry mob formed and burned the station to the ground, causing between six and twenty deaths. Many other countries also experienced problems when broadcasting ''The War of the Worlds''.

According to U.S. Air Force Captain [[Edward J. Ruppelt]],&lt;ref name=Ruppelt&gt;[http://www.nicap.org/rufo/contents.htm Ruppelt: Roswell UFO Cover]&lt;/ref&gt; the Air Force's files often mentioned the panicked aftermath of the 1938 ''War of the Worlds'' broadcast as a possible reaction of the public to confirmed evidence of UFOs; however, the files have not been made available to corroborate his assertions.

===1940s===

[[Donald Keyhoe]] later began investigating flying saucers for [[True (magazine)|True Magazine]]. Keyhoe was one of the first significant conspiracy theorists, asserting eventually that the saucers were from outer space and were on some sort of scouting mission. Keyhoe claimed to derive his theory from his contacts in Air Force and Navy intelligence. [[Project Sign]], based at Air Technical Intelligence Command at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] and its successors [[Project Grudge]] and [[Project Blue Book]] were officially assigned to investigate the flying saucers. [[Edward Ruppelt]]'s book ''The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects'',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.nicap.org/rufo–01.htm The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects]'', [[Doubleday Books]]&lt;/ref&gt; reports that many people within these research groups did in fact support the hypothesis that the flying saucers were from outer space.

Keyhoe later founded [[NICAP]], a civilian investigation group that asserted the US government was lying about UFOs and covering up information that should be shared with the public. NICAP had many influential board members, including [[Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter]], the first director of the [[CIA]]. To date no [[Scientific evidence|substantiating evidence]] for NICAP's assertions has been presented beyond accounts that are anecdotal and documented hear-say or rumor. &lt;ref name=csicop/&gt;

====The Great Los Angeles Air Raid====
{{Main|Battle of Los Angeles}}
"The Great Los Angeles Air Raid" also known as "The Battle of Los Angeles" is the name given by contemporary sources to the imaginary enemy attack and subsequent anti-aircraft artillery barrage which took place from late 24 February to early 25 February 1942 over [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]].&lt;ref name="Caughy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Caughey|first1= John |last2=Caughey|first2=LaRee |title=Los Angeles: biography of a city |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YADTxxBmer8C&amp;pg=PA364&amp;dq=great+los+angeles+air+raid#v=onepage&amp;q=great%20los%20angeles%20air%20raid&amp;f=false|year=1977|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-03410-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Farley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Farley|first=John E. |title=Earthquake fears, predictions, and preparations in mid-America  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N_pf4YBuu9wC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=%22great+los+angeles+air+raid%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22great%20los%20angeles%20air%20raid%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=May 17, 2010|year=1998|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|isbn=978-0-8093-2201-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the target of the aerial barrage was thought to be an attacking force from [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], but [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Frank Knox]] speaking at a press conference shortly afterward called the incident a "false alarm." A small number of modern-day [[UFOlogist]]s have suggested the reported targets were [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.majesticdocuments.com/documents/pre1948.php Documents Dated Prior to 1948] The Majestic Documents&lt;/ref&gt;

When documenting the incident in 1983, the U.S. Office of Air Force History attributed the event to a case of "war nerves" likely triggered by a lost [[weather balloon]] and exacerbated by stray flares and shell bursts from adjoining batteries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist9/aaf2.html San Francisco virtual museum article]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ghost rockets====
{{Main|Ghost rockets}}
In 1946 and 1947, numerous reports occurred of so-called [[ghost rockets]] appearing over [[Scandinavia]]n countries, primarily [[Sweden]], which then spread into other European countries.&lt;ref name=GhostR&gt;Ghost Rockets:

Similarly, 20 years later, Greek physicist Dr. [[Paul Santorini]] publicly stated that in 1947 he was put in charge of a Greek military investigation into reports of ghost rockets sighted over [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Greece]] [Timothy Good 1988, p 23; Donald Keyhoe, p 142].&lt;ref name=GhostR/&gt; Again, they quickly concluded the objects were real and not of conventional origin. Santorini claimed their investigation was killed by U.S. scientists and high military officials who had already concluded the objects were extraterrestrial in origin and feared public panic because no defense existed.&lt;ref name=ghost&gt;[[ghost rockets#External links|Ghost Rockets: list of External links to sources]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Roswell Incident====
{{Main|Roswell UFO Incident}}
In 1947, the [[United States Air Force]] issued a press release stating that a "flying disk" had been [[Roswell UFO incident|recovered]] near [[Roswell, New Mexico]]. This press release was quickly withdrawn, and officials stated that a [[weather balloon]] had been misidentified. The Roswell case quickly faded even from the attention of most [[ufology|UFOlogists]] until the 1970s. Speculation persisted despite the official denial that an alien spacecraft crashed near Roswell. For example, retired Brigadier General [[Arthur E. Exon]], former commanding officer of [[Wright-Patterson AFB]], told researchers [[Kevin D. Randle]] and [[Donald R. Schmitt]]&lt;ref name=RanSmi&gt;Roswell: Randle and Schmitt
* Kevin Randle &amp; Donald Schmitt, ''[[UFO Crash at Roswell]]'', 1991; ''[[Kevin D. Randle#Bibliography|The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell]]'', 1994
* ''see also'' {{Cite journal | last=Kouff | first=Kal | date=August 1997 | url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/what_really_happened_at_roswell | title=What Really Happened at Roswell | journal=Skeptical Inquirer | volume=21 | issue=4 | accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a spacecraft had crashed, alien bodies were recovered, and the event was covered up by the U.S. government. Exon further claimed he was aware of a very secretive UFO controlling committee made up primarily of very high-ranking military officers and intelligence people. His nickname for this group was "The Unholy Thirteen" (see also [[Majestic 12]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roswellproof.com/Exon.html |title=Brig. Gen. Arthur E. Exon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, the US military published two reports disclosing the true nature of the crashed aircraft: a surveillance balloon from Project Mogul. Nevertheless, the Roswell incident continues to be of interest in popular media, and conspiracy theories surrounding the event persist. Roswell has been described as "the world's most famous, most exhaustively investigated and most thoroughly debunked UFO claim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv |title=A Roswell requiem |first=B.D. |last=Gildenberg |journal=Skeptic |volume=10 |issue=1 |year=2003 |page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mantell Incident====
{{Main|Mantell UFO incident}}
In 1948, Air Force pilot Thomas Mantell was killed in a crash while pursuing what he described as "a metallic object...of tremendous size".&lt;ref name=clark&gt;Clark, Jerome, ''The UFO Book: Encyclopedia of the Extraterrestrial'', Visible Ink, 1998 {{ISBN|978-1-57859-029-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Project Blue Book]] concluded that Mantell had lost control of his aircraft while chasing a then-classified [[Skyhook balloon]].&lt;ref name="PopMech2"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wenz |first1=John |title=11 UFO Photos Unearthed From the Air Force's Vaults |url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/g1902/here-are-some-ufo-photos-from-project-bluebook/ |website=Popular Mechanics Magazine |publisher=Hearst Media |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some UFOlogists reject Bluebook's conclusion because of its initial suggestion that Mantell was chasing "Venus or a comet".&lt;ref name="WaPost"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kirkpatrick |first1=Nick |last2=Moyer |first2=Justin Wm. |title=Two decades of mysterious Air Force UFO files now available online |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/01/21/two-decades-of-mysterious-air-force-ufo-files-now-available-online/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.108233b4e959 | website=Washington Post | publisher=Washington Post | accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Project Sign====
{{Main|Project Sign}}
The U.S. Air Force may have planted the seeds of UFO conspiracy theories with [[Project Sign]] (established 1947) (which became [[Project Grudge]] and [[Project Blue Book]]). [[Edward J. Ruppelt]], the first director of Blue Book, characterized the Air Force's public behavior regarding UFOs as "[[schizophrenic]]": alternately open and transparent, then secretive and dismissive. Ruppelt also revealed that in mid-1948, Project Sign issued a top secret [[Estimate of the Situation]] concluding that the flying saucers were not only real but probably extraterrestrial in origin. According to Ruppelt, the Estimate was ordered destroyed by Air Force Chief of Staff [[Hoyt Vandenberg]].&lt;ref name=Ruppelt/&gt;

Project Sign's final report, published in early 1949, stated that while some UFOs appeared to represent actual aircraft data were insufficient to determine their origin.&lt;ref name=Blum1990&gt;Blum, Howard, Out There: The Government's Secret Quest for Extraterrestrials. Simon and Schuster, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit====
Some UFOlogists have claimed the existence of a U.S. government group called the "Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit" allegedly established by [[General Douglas MacArthur]] that was "supposedly formed to investigate crashed and retrieved flying saucers".&lt;ref name="Spignesi2000"&gt;Stephen J. Spignesi. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=BRHoKVTawnMC&amp;pg=PA24 The Ufo Book of Lists]''. Citadel Press; 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-8065-2109-1}}. p. 24–.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950s===
The 1950s saw an increase in both governmental and civilian investigative efforts and reports of public [[disinformation]] and suppression of evidence.

The UK [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]’s UFO Project has its roots in a study commissioned in 1950 by the MOD’s then Chief Scientific Adviser, the great radar scientist Sir [[Henry Tizard]]. As a result of his insistence that UFO sightings should not be dismissed without some form of proper scientific study, the Department set up the [[Flying Saucer Working Party]] (or FSWP).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nickpope.net/ufos_an_official_history.htm Nick Pope, ''UFOs: An Official History''].&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1950, Montanan baseball manager [[The Mariana UFO Incident|Nicholas Mariana]] filmed several UFOs with his color 16mm camera. [[Project Blue Book]] was called in and, after inspecting the film, Mariana claimed it was returned to him with critical footage removed, clearly showing the objects as disc-shaped. The [[The Mariana UFO Incident|incident]] sparked nation-wide media attention.

[[Frank Scully]]'s 1950 ''Behind the Flying Saucers'' suggested that the U.S. government had recovered a crashed flying saucer and its dead occupants near [[Aztec, New Mexico]], in 1948. It was later revealed that Scully had been the victim of a prank by "two veteran [[con artist|confidence artists]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.smu.edu/~pseudo/UFOs/Scully/Cahn1.pdf J. P. Cahn exposé, ''True Magazine'', 1952].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald Keyhoe]] was a retired [[United States Marines|U.S. Marine]] who wrote a series of popular books and magazine articles that were very influential in shaping public opinion, arguing that UFOs were indeed real and that the U.S. government was suppressing UFO evidence. Keyhoe's first article on the subject came out in [[True (magazine)|True Magazine]], January 1950, and was a national sensation. His first book, ''Flying Saucers Are Real'' also came out in 1950, about the same time as Frank Scully's book, and was a bestseller. In 1956, Keyhoe helped establish [[NICAP]], a powerful civilian UFO investigating group with many inside sources. Keyhoe became its director and continued his attacks on the Air Force. Other contemporary critics also charged that the [[United States Air Force]] was perpetrating a [[cover-up]] with its [[Project Blue Book]].

Canadian radio engineer Wilbert B. Smith, who worked for the Canadian Department of Transport, was interested in flying saucer propulsion technology and wondered if the assertions in the just-published Scully and Keyhoe books were factual. In September 1950, he had the Canadian embassy in Washington D.C. arrange contact with U.S. officials to try to discover the truth of the matter. Smith was briefed by Dr. Robert Sarbacher, a physicist and consultant to the Defense Department's Research and Development Board.  Other correspondence, having to do with Keyhoe needing to get clearance to publish another article on Smith's theories of UFO propulsion, indicated that [[Vannevar Bush|Bush]] and his group were operating out of the [[Vannevar Bush#National Science Foundation|Research and Development Board]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roswellproof.com/smith_papers.html Roswell Proof: Smith Papers]&lt;/ref&gt; Smith then briefed superiors in the Canadian government, leading to the establishment of [[Project Magnet]], a small Canadian government UFO research effort. Canadian documents and Smith's private papers were uncovered in the late 1970s, and by 1984, other alleged documents emerged claiming the existence of a highly secret UFO oversight committee of scientists and military people called [[Majestic 12]], again naming Vannevar Bush. Sarbacher was also interviewed in the 1980s and corroborated the information in Smith's memos and correspondence. Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, Smith granted public interviews, and among other things stated that he had been lent crashed UFO material for analysis by a highly secret U.S. government group which he wouldn't name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidentialufo.com/hardware.htm Presidential UFO.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408085039/http://presidentialufo.com/hardware.htm |date=2009-04-08 }} [http://www.roswellproof.com/debris8_misc.html#anchor_3697 Roswell Proof.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

A few weeks after the Robertson Panel, the Air Force issued Regulation 200-2, ordering air base officers to publicly discuss UFO incidents only if they were judged to have been solved, and to classify all the unsolved cases to keep them out of the public eye.  In addition, UFO investigative duties started to be taken on by the newly formed 4602nd Air Intelligence Squadron (AISS) of the [[Air Defense Command]]. The 4602nd AISS was tasked with investigating only the most important UFO cases having intelligence or national security implications. These were deliberately siphoned away from Blue Book, leaving Blue Book to deal with the more trivial reports. (Dolan, 210-211)&lt;ref name=Dolan&gt;Richard M. Dolan, ''UFOs and the National Security State: Chronology of a Cover-up 1941–1973'', 2002, {{ISBN|1-57174-317-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954 an automatic working station for UFO monitoring was installed at [[Shirley's Bay]] near Ottawa in Canada. After this station detected the first suspicious event, all data gained by this station was classified as secret, although the cameras of the monitoring station could not make any pictures because of fog.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/ufo/002029-1400.01-e.html ''Canada's UFOs'', Shirley's Bay, Ontario, Project Magnet, 1952, Library and Archives of Canada].&lt;/ref&gt;

1956 saw the publication of [[Gray Barker]]'s ''They Knew Too Much About Flying Saucers'', the book which publicized the idea of sinister [[Men in Black]] who appear to UFO witnesses and warn them to keep quiet. There has been continued speculation that the men in black are government agents who harass and threaten UFO witnesses.

Also in 1956, the group [[Foundation for Earth-Space Relations]], led by film producer [[Tzadi Sophit]], tested their own flying saucer outside the Long Island town of Ridge Landing. It is speculated in Robertson's "[[The Long Island Saucer]]" that an FBI cover-up silenced witnesses. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-08-04/features/1997216040_1_ufo-network-long-island-radioactive|title=Long Island's UFO plot Trial: A flying saucer true believer must answer charges that he intended to kill three people he believed were covering up alien landings.|last=|first=|date=|work=Baltimore Sun|access-date=2018-06-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On January 22, 1958, when [[Donald Keyhoe]] appeared on CBS television, his statements on UFOs were precensored by the Air Force. During the show when Keyhoe tried to depart from the censored script to "reveal something that has never been disclosed before", CBS cut the sound, later stating Keyhoe was about to violate "predetermined security standards" and about to say something he wasn't "authorized to release". What Keyhoe was about to reveal were four publicly unknown military studies concluding UFOs were interplanetary including the 1948 [[Project Sign]] [[Estimate of the Situation]] and a 1952 Project Blue Book engineering analysis of UFO motion presented at the [[Robertson Panel]].

[[Astronaut]] [[Gordon Cooper]] reported suppression of a flying saucer movie filmed in high clarity by two [[Edwards AFB]] range photographers on May 3, 1957. Cooper said he viewed developed negatives of the object, clearly showing a dish-like object with a dome on top and something like holes or ports in the dome. When later interviewed by [[James E. McDonald|James McDonald]], the photographers and another witness confirmed the story. Cooper said military authorities then picked up the film and neither he nor the photographers ever heard what happened to it. The incident was also reported in a few newspapers, such as the [[Los Angeles Times]]. The official explanation was that the photographers had filmed a weather balloon distorted by hot desert air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ufoevidence.org/Newsite/Files/MacDonaldSubmissionUFOSymposium.pdf|title=McDonald, 1968 Congressional testimony, Case 41|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624204634/http://www.ufoevidence.org/Newsite/Files/MacDonaldSubmissionUFOSymposium.pdf|archivedate=2006-06-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s===

Throughout much of the 1960s, atmospheric physicist [[James E. McDonald]] suggested—via lectures, articles and letters—that the U.S. Government was mishandling evidence which would support the [[extraterrestrial hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;''see'' James E. McDonald: [[James E. McDonald#External links|External links]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
Clark notes that many UFO conspiracy theory tales "can be traced to a mock documentary, [[Alternative 3]], broadcast on British television on June 20, 1977, and subsequently turned into a paperback book." (Clark, 213–4)&lt;ref name=clark/&gt;

====Holloman Air Force Base====

Clark cites a 1973 encounter as perhaps the earliest suggestion that the U.S. government was involved with ETs. That year, Robert Emenegger and Allan Sandler of [[Los Angeles, California]] were in contact with officials at [[Norton Air Force Base]] in order to make a [[documentary film]]. Emenegger and Sandler report that Air Force Officials (including [[Paul Shartle]]) suggested incorporating UFO information in the documentary, including as its centerpiece genuine footage of a 1971 UFO landing at [[Holloman Air Force Base]] in [[New Mexico]]. Furthermore, says Emenegger, he was given a tour of Holloman AFB and was shown where officials conferred with [[Extraterrestrial life | Extraterrestrial Biological Entities (EBEs)]]. This was supposedly not the first time the U.S. had met these aliens, as Emenegger reported that his U.S. military sources had "been monitoring signals from an alien group with which they were unfamiliar, and did their ET guests know anything about them? The ETs said no" (Clark 1998, 144).&lt;ref name=clark/&gt; The documentary was released in 1974 as ''UFO's: Past, Present and Future'' (narrated by [[Rod Serling]]) containing only a few seconds of the Holloman UFO footage, the remainder of the landing depicted with illustrations and re-enactments.

In 1988, Shartle said that the film in question was genuine, and that he had seen it several times.

In 1976 a televised documentary report ''UFOS: It Has Begun''&lt;ref&gt;''UFOS: It Has Begun'', Producer [[Allan F. Sandler]], Director [[Ray Rivas]], Writer [[Robert Emenegger]], 1976, Featuring [[Rod Serling]], Special Appearances by [[José Ferrer]] and [[Burgess Meredith]] – VCI Sci-Fi DVD Double Feature: ''UFOs: It Has Begun / UFO Syndrome'', Distributed by [[VCI Entertainment]]  http://www.vcient.com&lt;/ref&gt; written by Robert Emenegger was presented by Rod Serling, [[Burgess Meredith]] and [[José Ferrer]]. Some sequences were recreated based upon the statements of eyewitness observers, together with the findings and conclusions of governmental civil and military investigations. The documentary uses a hypothetical UFO landing at Holloman AFB as a backdrop.

====Paul Bennewitz====

The late 1970s also saw the beginning of controversy centered on [[Paul Bennewitz]] of [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;''see'' Paul Bennewitz: [[Paul Bennewitz#Further reading|References and External Links]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===

====MJ-12====

The so-called [[Majestic 12]] documents surfaced in 1982, suggesting that there was secret, high-level U.S. government interest in UFOs dating to the 1940s.

====Linda Moulton Howe====
[[Linda Moulton Howe]] is an advocate of [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] that [[cattle mutilations]] are of [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] origin and speculations that the U.S. government is involved with aliens.&lt;ref name="Knight2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Knight|title=Conspiracy Theories in American History: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMIDrggs8TsC&amp;pg=PA125|accessdate=18 October 2012|year=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-812-9|pages=125–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barkun2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Barkun|title=A Culture of Conspiracy: Apocalyptic Visions in Contemporary America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA86|accessdate=18 October 2012|date=4 May 2006|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24812-0|pages=86–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Editor1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nancy Lusignan, Editor|title=Fear Itself: Enemies Real and Imagined in American Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dkYyuNvfqY8C&amp;pg=PA415|accessdate=18 October 2012|date=1 September 1998|publisher=Purdue University Press|isbn=978-1-55753-115-5|pages=415–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Landes2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Landes|title=Encyclopedia of Millennialism and Millennial Movements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4eVZaI20_mEC&amp;pg=PA731|accessdate=18 October 2012|date=6 July 2000|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-92246-3|pages=731–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Milton William Cooper====

In the 1980s, [[Milton William Cooper]] achieved a degree of prominence due to his conspiratorial writings.&lt;ref&gt;''see'' Milton William Cooper: [[Milton William Cooper#Further reading|References]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bob Lazar====

In November 1989, [[Bob Lazar]] appeared in a special interview with investigative reporter George Knapp on Las Vegas TV station KLAS to discuss his alleged employment at S-4.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.8newsnow.com/story/3369879/bob-lazar-the-man-behind-area-51 KLAS-TV: 8 News Now: George Knapp, Investigative Reporter: "Bob Lazar The Man Behind Area 51: NEW: Area 51 Exposed] retrieved 21 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In his interview with Knapp, Lazar said he first thought the saucers were secret, terrestrial aircraft, whose test flights must have been responsible for many UFO reports. Gradually, on closer examination and from having been shown multiple briefing documents, Lazar came to the conclusion that the discs must have been of extraterrestrial origin. He claims that they use [[moscovium]], an element that decays in a fraction of a second, to warp space, and that he has since met Grey aliens from the "[[Zeta Reticuli]]" star system. According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]],'' he never obtained the degrees he claims to hold from MIT and Caltech.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Los Angeles Times]]'': May 6, 1993, [[Ray Rivenberg|Rivenberg, Ray]], "Unusually Fanatical Observers Ike Struck Deal With Aliens!"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidentialufo.com/articles-a-papers/379-the-true-story-of-area-51-a-look-at-the-actual-evidence The Presidents UFO Website: ''The True Story of Area 51: A Look at the Actual Evidence''], Written by [[Grant Cameron]], Monday, 03 October 2011 18:29 retrieved 21 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

====''UFO Cover-Up?: Live!''====

On October 14, 1988, actor [[Mike Farrell]] hosted ''U.S. UFO Cover-Up: Live!'', a two-hour television special "focusing on the government's handling of information regarding UFOs" and "whether there has been any suppression of evidence supporting the existence of UFOs".&lt;ref name="TCM"&gt;{{cite web|title=UFO Cover-Up?... Live (1988|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/475950/UFO-Cover-Up-Live/|website=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=Turner Classic Movies, Inc.|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====July 1989 MUFON Convention====

The [[Mutual UFO Network]] held their 1989 annual convention in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], on July 1, 1989.

[[Bill Moore (ufologist)]] was scheduled as the main speaker, and he refused to submit his paper for review prior to the convention, and also announced that he would not answer any follow-up questions as was common practice. Unlike most of the convention's attendees, Moore did not stay at the same hotel that was hosting the convention.

When he spoke, Moore said that he and others had been part of an elaborate, long-term [[disinformation]] campaign begun primarily to discredit [[Paul Bennewitz]]: "My role in the affair ... was primarily that of a freelancer providing information on Paul's (Bennewitz) current thinking and activities" (Clark, 1998, 163).&lt;ref name=clark/&gt; Air Force Sergeant Richard C. Doty was also involved, said Moore, though Moore thought Doty was "simply a pawn in a much larger game, as was I." (ibid.)&lt;ref name=clark/&gt; One of their goals, Moore said, was to disseminate information and watch as it was passed from person to person in order to study information channels.

Moore said that he "was in a rather unique position" in the disinformation campaign: "judging by the positions of the people I knew to be directly involved in it, [the disinformation] definitely had something to do with national security. There was no way I was going to allow the opportunity to pass me by ... I would play the disinformation game, get my hands dirty just often enough to lead those directing the process into believing I was doing what they wanted me to do, and all the while continuing to burrow my way into the matrix so as to learn as much as possible about who was directing it and why."(ibid., 164)&lt;ref name=clark/&gt;

Once he finished the speech, Moore immediately left the hotel. He left Las Vegas that same night.

Moore's claims sent shock waves through the small, tight-knit UFO community, which remains divided as to the reliability of his assertions.

===1990s===

On November 24, 1992, a UFO reportedly crashed in Southaven Park, [[Shirley, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ufocasebook.com/southavenufo.html UFO Crash At Southaven Park&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.ufocasebook.com&lt;/ref&gt;   John Ford, a Long Island [[Mutual UFO Network|MUFON]] researcher, investigated the crash.  Four years later, on June 12, 1996, Ford was arrested and charged with plotting to poison several local politicians by sneaking [[radium]] in their toothpaste. On advice of counsel Ford pleaded insanity and was committed to the Mid Hudson Psychiatric Center. Critics say the charges are a [[frame-up]].

The [[Branton Files]] have circulated on the internet at least since the mid-1990s. They essentially recirculate the information presented above, with many asides from "[[Bruce Alan Walton|Branton]]", the document's editor.

Philip Schneider of the [[patriot movement]], an engineer and geologist formerly working for the U.S. government, made a few appearances at UFO conventions in the 1990s, espousing essentially a new version of the theories mentioned above. He claimed to have played a role in the construction of Deep Underground Military Bases (DUMBs) across the United States, and as a result he said that he had been exposed to classified information of various sorts as well as having personal experiences with EBEs. He claimed to have survived the [[Dulce Base]] catastrophe and decided to tell his tale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Phil Schneider Story|url=http://www.apfn.org/apfn/phil.htm|publisher=APFN|accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died by suicide on January 17, 1996, after a series of lectures given in late 1995 on topics including the [[Black Budget]] and underground alien bases. Others believe that Schneider did not take his own life and that he was actually murdered by the government. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apfn.org/apfn/ex_wifephil.htm|title=Message from ex-wife of Phil Schneider|website=www.apfn.org|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 a group in France published a study, "UFOs and Defense: What Must We Be Prepared For?" Among other topics, the study concluded that the United States government has withheld valuable evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ufoevidence.org/topics/cometa.htm UFO Evidence : COMETA Report&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.ufoevidence.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
2003 saw the publication of ''Alien Encounters'' ({{ISBN|1-57821-205-7}}), by [[Chuck Missler]] and Mark Eastman, which primarily re-stated the notions presented above (especially Cooper's) and presents them as fact.

====MoD secret files====
Eight files from 1978 to 1987 on UFO sightings were first released on May 14, 2008, to the National Archives' website by the British Ministry of Defence. 200 files were set to be made public by 2012. The files are correspondence from the public sent to government officials, such as the MoD and [[Margaret Thatcher]]. The information can be downloaded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ufos UFO files from The National Archives&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.nationalarchives.gov.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Copies of Lt.

====Disclosure====
In the early 2000s, the concept of "disclosure" became increasingly popular in the UFO conspiracy community: that the government had suppressed information on alien contact and full disclosure was needed, and was pursued by activist lobbying groups.

In 1993, [[Steven M. Greer]] founded the Disclosure Project to promote the concept. In May 2001, Greer held a press conference at the [[National Press Club (United States)|National Press Club]] in [[Washington, D.C.|D.C]] that demanded Congress hold hearings on "secret U.S. involvement with UFOs and extraterrestrials".&lt;ref name="washtimes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Government is covering up UFO evidence, group says |first=Julia |last=Duin |url=http://www.washtimes.com/national/20010510-19816390.htm |newspaper=[[The Washington Times]] |date=11 May 2001 |accessdate=8 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010516132431/http://www.washtimes.com/national/20010510-19816390.htm |archivedate=May 16, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily Record"&gt;{{cite web | title=They're Here; UFO watchers to reveal proof that aliens have visited Earth | publisher=The Daily Record | date=May 9, 2001 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-74321804.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abcnews"&gt;{{cite news

Other such groups include [[Citizens Against UFO Secrecy]], founded in 1977.

==Allegations of evidence suppression==
Allegations of suppression of UFO related evidence have persisted for many decades. Some conspiracy theories also claim that some governments might have removed and/or destroyed/suppressed physical evidence; some examples follow.

On July 7, 1947, William Rhodes photographed an unusual object over [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roswellproof.com/Rhodes_Phoenix.html Rhodes_Phoenix]&lt;/ref&gt; The photos appeared in a Phoenix newspaper and a few other papers. An Army Air Force intelligence officer and an FBI agent interviewed Rhodes on August 29 and convinced him to surrender the negatives, which he did the next day. He was informed he wouldn't be getting them back, but later he tried, unsuccessfully, to retrieve them.&lt;ref&gt;http://bluebookarchive.org/page.aspx?PageCode=NARA-PBB1-913&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://bluebookarchive.org/page.aspx?PageCode=NARA-PBB1-920&lt;/ref&gt; The photos were analyzed and subsequently appeared in some classified Air Force UFO intelligence reports. (Randle, 34–45, full account)&lt;ref name=RanSmi/&gt;

A June 27, 1950, movie of a "flying disk" over [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]], taken by a Louisville ''Courier-Journal'' photographer, had the USAF Directors of counterintelligence ([[Air Force Office of Special Investigations|AFOSI]]) and intelligence discussing in memos how to best obtain the movie and interview the photographer without revealing Air Force interest. One memo suggested the [[FBI]] be used, then precluded the FBI getting involved. Another memo said "it would be nice if OSI could arrange to secure a copy of the film in some covert manner," but if that wasn't feasible, one of the Air Force scientists might have to negotiate directly with the newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;http://bluebookarchive.org/page.aspx?PageCode=NARA-PBB90-218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://bluebookarchive.org/page.aspx?PageCode=NARA-PBB90-219&lt;/ref&gt; In a recent interview, the photographer confirmed meeting with military intelligence and still having the film in his possession until then, but refused to say what happened to the film after that.&lt;ref&gt;[http://roswellproof.homestead.com/UFO_CalNev_1950.html Strange rocket-like UFO over California/Nevada, June 24, 1950]&lt;/ref&gt;

In another 1950 movie incident from Montana, Nicholas Mariana filmed some unusual aerial objects and eventually turned the film over to the U.S. Air Force, but insisted that the first part of the film, clearly showing the objects as spinning discs, had been removed when it was returned to him. (Clark, 398)&lt;ref name=clark/&gt;

According to some conspiracy theorists, during the military investigation of [[green fireballs]] in [[New Mexico]], UFOs were photographed by a tracking camera over [[White Sands Proving Grounds]] on April 27, 1949. They claim that the final report in 1951 on the green fireball investigation claimed there was insufficient data to determine anything. Conspiracy theorists claim that documents later uncovered by Dr. [[Bruce Maccabee]] indicate that [[triangulation]] was accomplished. The conspiracy theorists also claim that the data reduction and photographs showed four objects about 30 feet in diameter flying in formation at high speed at an altitude of about 30 miles. According to conspiracy theorists, Maccabee says this result was apparently suppressed from the final report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nicap.org/ncp/ncp-brumac.htm NCP-12: The White Sands Proof – Maccabee]&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 22, 1958, when [[NICAP]] director [[Donald Keyhoe]] appeared on CBS television, his statements on UFOs were pre-censored by the Air Force.  During the show when Keyhoe tried to depart from the censored script to "reveal something that has never been disclosed before," CBS cut the sound, later stating Keyhoe was about to violate "predetermined security standards" and about to say something he wasn't "authorized to release." Conspiracy theorists claim that what Keyhoe was about to reveal were four publicly unknown military studies concluding UFOs were interplanetary (including the 1948 [[Project Sign]] [[Estimate of the Situation]] and Blue Book's 1952 engineering analysis of UFO motion).

A March 1, 1967 memo directed to all USAF divisions, from USAF Lt. General Hewitt Wheless, Assistant Vice Chief of Staff, stated that unverified information indicated that unknown individuals, impersonating USAF officers and other military personnel, had been harassing civilian UFO witnesses, warning them not to talk, and also confiscating film, referring specifically to the Heflin incident. AFOSI was to be notified if any personnel were to become aware of any other incidents. (Document in Fawcett &amp; Greenwood, 236.)&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Fawcett and Barry J. Greenwood, ''The UFO Cover-Up'' (originally ''Clear Intent''), New York: Fireside Books (Simon &amp; Schuster), 1992, {{ISBN|0-671-76555-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Callahan, former Division Chief of the Accidents and Investigations Branch of the [[FAA]], Washington D.C., also a [[Disclosure Project]] witness, said that following the [[Japan Air Lines flight 1628 incident]] that involved a giant UFO over Alaska, recorded by air and ground radar, the FAA conducted an investigation.  Callahan held a briefing a few days later for President Reagan's Scientific Study Group, the FBI, and CIA.  After the briefing, one of the CIA agents told everybody they "were never there and this never happened," adding they were fearful of public panic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ufoevidence.org/documents/doc1324.htm UFO Evidence.org documents]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one [[CIA Kennedy assassination conspiracy theory|theory related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy]], the CIA killed Kennedy in order to prevent him from leaking information to the Soviet Union about a covert program to reverse-engineer alien technology (i.e., Majestic 12).&lt;ref name=Speigel&gt;{{cite news|last=Speigel|first=Lee|title=The JFK-UFO Connection: Bogus Documents or Unanswered Questions?|url=http://www.aolnews.com/2011/04/18/the-jfk-ufo-connection-bogus-documents-or-unanswered-questions/|accessdate=January 2, 2013|newspaper=AOL News|date=April 18, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027082646/http://www.aolnews.com/2011/04/18/the-jfk-ufo-connection-bogus-documents-or-unanswered-questions/|archivedate=October 27, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nick Cook (writer)|Nick Cook]], an aviation investigative journalist for ''[[Jane's Information Group]]'' and researcher of ''Billion Dollar Secret''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2002/09/into-the-black/303076 Review of ''Billion Dollar Secret'' and ''The Hunt for Zero Point'', "Into the Black" by Frank Bures, ''The Atlantic'' magazine].&lt;/ref&gt; and author of ''The Hunt for Zero Point''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2002/08/05/zero_gravity Review of "The Hunt for Zero Point" by Kurt Kleiner at Salon.com]&lt;/ref&gt; claims to have uncovered documentary evidence that top-secret US Defense Industry technology has been developed by government-backed Defense Industry programs, beginning in the 1940s using research conducted by Nazi scientists during WWII and recovered by Allied Military Intelligence, then taken to the U.S. and developed further with the collaboration of the same former German scientists at top-secret facilities established at White Sands, New Mexico, and later at [[Area 51]], allegedly resulting in production of real-world prototype operational supersonic craft actually tested and used in clandestine military exercises, with other developments incorporated later into spy aircraft tasked with overflying hostile countries: the UFO story that evidence of alien technology is being suppressed and removed or destroyed was generated and then promoted by the CIA, beginning 1947, as false-lead [[disinformation]] to cover it all up for the sake of National Security, particularly during the Cold War, at a time when (his investigations found) the Soviet Union too was developing its own top-secret high-tech UFO craft. Cook's conclusions, alleging suppression of evidence of advanced ''human'' technology instead of alien, together with what he presents as declassified top-secret documents and blueprints, and his interviews of various experts (some of doubtful reliability), was developed and broadcast as a feature documentary on British television in 2005 as "UFOs: The Secret Evidence" and in the US in 2006 as a two-part episode on the History Channel's [[UFO Files#2006 season|UFO Files]], retitled "An Alien History of Planet Earth", with an added introduction by actor [[William Shatner]]. The ''History Channel'' program teaser promised "...a look at rumors of classified military aircraft incorporating alien technology into their designs."

In 1993, [[Steven M. Greer]] founded the [[Disclosure (ufology)|Disclosure]] project to promote the concept of disclosing allegedly suppressed evidence of extraterrestrials. In May 2001, Greer held a press conference at the [[National Press Club (United States)|National Press Club]] in [[Washington, D.C.|D.C]] that featured "20 retired Air Force, Federal Aviation Administration and intelligence officers" who demanded that Congress begin hearings on "secret U.S. involvement with UFOs and extraterrestrials"&lt;ref name="washtimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily Record"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abcnews"/&gt;

In 2013, [[Mike Gravel|Sen. Mike Gravel]] claimed that the government was suppressing evidence of extraterrestrials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.yahoo.com/blogs/power-players-abc-news/former-sen-mike-gravel-says-white-house-suppressing-112957111.html | title=  Out there: Former Sen. Mike Gravel says White House suppressing evidence of ETs | publisher=[[Yahoo! News]]/[[ABC News]] | date=2013-05-03 | accessdate=2013-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benjamin Radford]] has pointed out how unlikely such suppression of evidence is given that "[t]he UFO coverup conspiracy would have to span decades, cross international borders, and transcend political administrations" and that "all of the world's governments, in perpetuity, regardless of which political party is in power and even among enemies, [would] have colluded to continue the coverup."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Radford |first1=Benjamin |authorlink1=Benjamin Radford |title=The Phantom Menace of UFO Revelation |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=28-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular fiction==
In fiction, television programs (''[[The X-Files]]'' and ''[[Stargate]]''), films (''[[Men in Black (1997 film)|Men in Black]]'' and ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'') and any number of [[novel]]s have featured elements of UFO conspiracy theories. Fictionalized elements may include the government's sinister operatives from ''Men in Black'', the military bases known as [[Area 51]], [[RAF Rudloe Manor]] or [[Porton Down]], a rumored crash site in [[Roswell, New Mexico]], the [[Rendlesham Forest Incident]], a political committee dubbed "[[Majestic 12]]", or the successor of the UK Ministry of Defence's [[Flying Saucer Working Party]] (FSWP).&lt;ref name="Robertson2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=David G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4211">'''Wolfgang Karl Weyrauch''' (1907 - 1970) was a [[Germany|German]] - [[Peru]]vian  [[Malacology|malacologist]] and [[Entomology|entomologist]].

==Life==
Wolfgang Karl Weyrauch was born on December 7, 1970, in [[Elberfeld]], Germany. He received his PhD in Zoology in 1929 from the [[University of Berlin]] with a thesis on insect neurophysiology.&lt;ref name="Barbosa2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barbosa | first1 = André F. | last2 = Delhey | first2 = Valdemar K. | last3 = Coan | first3 = Eugene V. | title = Molluscan Names And Malacological Contributions Of Wolfgang Karl Weyrauch (1907–1970) With A Brief Biography | journal = Malacologia | volume = 50 | issue = 1 | year = 2008 | pages = 265–277 | issn = 0076-2997 | doi = 10.4002/0076-2997-50.1.265}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1928 to 1929, he was an assistant of [[Richard Hesse]], and from 1931 to 1943 he worked for the German Council of Scientific Research doing field studied on entomology and ecology.&lt;ref name="Barbosa2008" /&gt;

In 1938, he worked as an entomologist at the agricultural experimental station (Estación Agrícola de La Molina) in [[Lima]]. At the time of the [[World War II]], he moved to [[Texas]], where he did field work in entomology and malacology. In 1946, he was at the Estación experimental Agrícola de Tingo María in Lima. From 1948 on, he worked for the [[National University of San Marcos|Universidad Mayor de San Marcos]] in Lima as a Professor of zoology and Genetics at the [[Museum of Natural History, Lima|Museo Nacional de Historia]]. In addition, he was from 1959 to 1961 Professor of agricultural zoology at the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Peru|Pontificia Universidad Católica del Lima]]. In 1962, he went to Argentina and became professor at the Instituto Miguel Lillo in [[San Miguel de Tucumán|Tucumán]]. He died of a heart attack in 1970.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Works==
Weyrauch studied land and freshwater gastropods of [[South America]], mainly taxa belonging to the families [[Camaenidae]], [[Charopidae]],  [[Clausiliidae]], [[Endodontidae]], [[Helicinidae]], “[[Hydrobiidae]]”, [[Orthalicidae]], [[Pupillidae]], [[Scolodontidae]], [[Subulinidae]], and [[Urocoptidae]]. He left behind many type specimens in museums, of which he published no original description. He was the author of 198 molluscan names.

==Species named in his honor==
The following gastropod species were named after Weyrauch:&lt;ref name="Barbosa2008" /&gt;

Zooplankton is a categorization spanning a range of [[organism]] sizes including small [[protozoa]]ns and large [[metazoa]]ns.  It includes [[holoplankton]]ic organisms whose complete [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] lies within the plankton, as well as [[meroplankton]]ic organisms that spend part of their lives in the plankton before graduating to either the [[nekton]] or a [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]], [[benthos|benthic]] existence.  Although zooplankton are primarily transported by ambient water currents, many have [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]], used to avoid predators (as in [[diel vertical migration]]) or to increase prey encounter rate.

[[Ecology|Ecologically]] important protozoan zooplankton groups include the [[foraminifera]]ns, [[radiolaria]]ns and [[dinoflagellate]]s (the last of these are often [[mixotroph]]ic).  Important metazoan zooplankton include [[cnidaria]]ns such as [[jellyfish]] and the [[Portuguese Man o' War]]; [[crustacea]]ns such as [[copepod]]s, [[ostracod]]s, [[isopod]]s, [[amphipod]]s, [[mysids]] and [[krill]]; [[Chaetognatha|chaetognath]]s (arrow worms); [[Mollusca|molluscs]] such as [[pteropod]]s; and [[chordate]]s such as [[salp]]s and juvenile fish. This wide [[phylogeny|phylogenetic]] range includes a similarly wide range in feeding behavior: [[filter feeder|filter feeding]], [[predation]] and [[symbiosis]] with [[autotrophic]] [[phytoplankton]] as seen in corals.  Zooplankton feed on [[bacterioplankton]], phytoplankton, other zooplankton (sometimes [[Cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalistically]]), [[detritus]] (or [[marine snow]]) and even nektonic organisms.  As a result, zooplankton are primarily found in surface waters where food resources (phytoplankton or other zooplankton) are abundant.

Just as any species can be limited within a geographical region, so are zooplankton. However, species of zooplankton are not dispersed uniformly or randomly within a region of the ocean.  As with phytoplankton, ‘patches’ of zooplankton species exist throughout the ocean. Though few physical barriers exist above the [[mesopelagic]], specific species of zooplankton are strictly restricted by salinity and temperature gradients; while other species can withstand wide temperature and salinity gradients.&lt;ref name="Lalli and Parsons"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lalli, C.M.  |author2=Parsons, T.R. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Biological Oceanography An Introduction|year=1993|publisher=Elsevier|location=30 Corporate Drive, Burlington, MA 01803|isbn=978-0-7506-3384-0|pages=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zooplankton patchiness can also be influenced by biological factors, as well as  other physical factors.  Biological factors include breeding, predation, concentration of phytoplankton, and vertical migration.&lt;ref name="Lalli and Parsons"/&gt; The physical factor that influences zooplankton distribution the most is mixing of the water column ([[upwelling]] and [[downwelling]] along the coast and in the open ocean) that affects nutrient availability and, in turn, phytoplankton production.&lt;ref name="Lalli and Parsons"/&gt;

Through their consumption and processing of phytoplankton and other food sources, zooplankton play a role in aquatic [[food web]]s, as a resource for consumers on higher [[trophic level]]s (including fish), and as a conduit for packaging the organic material in the [[biological pump]].  Since they are typically small, zooplankton can respond rapidly to increases in phytoplankton abundance,{{Clarify|date=March 2011}} for instance, during the [[spring bloom]].

Zooplankton can also act as a [[infectious disease|disease]] [[natural reservoir|reservoir]].  Crustacean zooplankton have been found to house the bacterium ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', which causes [[cholera]], by allowing the cholera vibrios to attach to their chitinous [[exoskeleton]]s.  This [[symbiotic]] relationship enhances the bacterium's ability to survive in an aquatic environment, as the exoskeleton provides the bacterium with carbon and nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;
