Many of the characters names as well as certain phrases are taken from [[Slavic languages]] as well.
Since its creation Archaic has gained a rather large amount of attention in the American comics community. The series has earned several award nominations, such as Golden Chazzie nominations for ''Best Ongoing Series'' and ''Best Artist'' for 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.needcoffee.com/updates/the-2006-golden-chazzie-nominees Golden Chazzie Nominees]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wizard (magazine)|''Wizard Comics Magazine'']] rated it number 4 in its 2007 top 40 indie comics.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wizard Magazine]] ''(issue 186, Feb. 28 2007), page 124&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
Premiering at [[Comic-Con International]] 2005, Archaic immediately released with 5 issues in an early small press production run that saw different covers from the later Diamond releases. Archaic began distribution through Diamond in January 2006. It originally released 6 issues in a bi-monthly format that have since been collected in 2 separate [[Trade paperback (comics)|Trade paperback]]s, ''Rule of the Deviant'' and ''Winter Children''. After a several month hiatus however, the series has continued forward starting in July 2006. Now Archaic has begun a monthly release schedule from issue 7 onward.

==Synopsis==
'''''Archaic''''' is an ongoing fictional story dealing with a fantasy realm and several of its both heroic and villainous inhabitants. The Antagonist, Král Groznyj rules over a vast region of land, fearing no one but those foretold in an ancient prophecy to be his own downfall. The prophecy claims that children of his own nephews would one day rise up and destroy him. From there the story covers several generations of people living in Tzenebraum, otherwise known as "The Thrice-Nine Lands".

===Rule of the Deviant (issues #1-3)===
The story begins with the šarkan general, Petr Drakanov besieged in his family's castle. Nestled safely behind the walls of the Drakánc Hrad, Petr sees his time coming to an end. Petr's uncle, the šarkan king Král Groznyj has sent forces to capture and kill him and his family. Well Petr holds out for sometime, eventually the betrayal of his own soldiers draws him into battle. A young and ambitious knight by the name of Valen makes a deal with Groznyj. The aid of Valens allows Groznyj to convince Sir Marcus, Petr's head knight, that Petr is a murderer. Shocked and disgusted by this false information, Sir Marcus leads an attack on Petr's castle. Petr is slain on the bridge of his fortress, his last words asking the very knight who killed him to protect his new born son. 
When King Groznyj eventually arrives for Petr family, Sir Marcus is the one to drag Petr's wife, Cassandra, and son, Košice, across the bridge of Drakánc Hrad. However, Sir Marcus soon realizes his mistake and is killed by Valen. Valen is able to take Cassandra to Groznyj, but Košice is spirited away by the magic of the last loyal knights under Petr's command.
Meanwhile, Groznyj's armies lay waste to the cities of Faeries in a mass genocide. The Lunatai, a [[werewolf]] like species of faerie, lead the attacks on their biological cousins. During these attacks, the Lunatai are made an offer, all the northern lands in trade for hunting down two children, the descendents of the Drakanovy. The Teardrop Knights, also looking for the descendents of the Drakanovy, dispatch several groups to track down Košice and return him to safety. An older knight by the name of Velshin is the one to finally retrieve Košice, however he loses the rest of his team. Velshin then chooses to take the Drakanov child north, into hiding, until aid from the Order of Teardrop can be sent. Through all of this we also find out that Mikal Drakanov, Petr's brother, is currently imprisoned in the dungeons of Král Groznyj.

===Winter Children (issues #4-6)===
Years have passed since the death of Petr Drakanov and his son, Košice, now hides in the north under the watchful eye of Velshin. Velshin has told the now teenaged boy very little of his past and renamed him Kalias to hide his identity. However, with years having passed and Košice have disappeared without a trace, Groznyj fears for his future. In response Groznyj sends one of his best men, Genosik the Kinslayer, to track down and kill Košice. Genosik, along with his group of assassins, track down Košice to the village široke. At the same time, Grimm, an ex-teardrop knight under the command of Sir Marcus, leads a group of mercenaries to široke. Grimm was mortally wounded on the bridge of Drakánc Hrad the day Košice disappeared. He had since vowed to undo his misdeeds against his lord by finding and protecting the young Košice.
All parties arrive at a bar in široke within minutes of each other, leading to a large confrontation. The end result leaves many dead, Košice blinded and confused, and Genosik fleeing back to Groznyj. Lying dead in the snow, the aged knight, Velshin tells Grimm to bring Košice to Teardrop. 
During this time we are also introduced to Solare, an elf faerie, and his group of Lunatai hunting friends. Solare and his men are on a quest of vengeance to kill all the Lunatai for their horrid acts on faerie kind.
Košice, Grimm, and the only survivor of Grimm's mercenary group eventually reach the floating city of teardrop. As they question how to gain access to the city, the workings of war stir in Groznyj's kingdom. Groznyj has asked the Lord Sialenec ze Tak Tak to lead an army against the knights of Teardrop. As Tak Tak raises his men, a female assassin he is quite fond of returns to his life. The assassin, Allysyn, is tasked with capture the other Drakonov child, Mikal's daughter, Erzebet

===The Hollow (issues #7-9)===
The Hollow tells the tale of Solare's group of warriors as well as that of Allysyn and her lover, Lane. Lane, an ex-teardrop knight, is introduced fighting a group of sickmen, [[zombie]] like undead creatures. We come to realize that Lane and Allysyn's mission is to track down Erzebet Drakanov, daughter of Mikal Drakanov. Erzebet was long ago kidnapped and held captive by pack of lunatai. As fate would have it, Solare comes across the same pack of lunatai that hold the Drakanov girl. Fearing Erzebet is soon to be lunatai food, one of Solare's group dashes into combat to save the girl. Solare reluctantly follows, slaughtering many lunatai. Unfortunately Lane soon enters the fray, choosing to also kill Solare and his ally, Jun. Lane leaves Solare for dead, having found Erzebet. 
Later that evening Jeeves, another victim of Lane's sword and [[butler]] to Erzebet Drakanov, comes across the badly damaged Solare. Solare rises from his seemingly dead state, healing with the speed expected of a faerie. Solare vows revenge on Lane for killing Jun. With the aid of Jeeves, Solare begins a hunt for Lane and Allysyn. During this journey, we learn of the language of the spiders and that Erzebet and Jeeves are both familiar with it. Erzebet leaves a trail of information through [[spider web]]s across the country side, allowing Jeeves to track her. Eventually the two warriors have their final clash outside a Brillianti church. Solare manages to kill both Allysyn and Lane, once more with the aid of Jeeves. Solare takes leave to continue his quest well Jeeves once more returns to the service of Miss Erzebet. After Solare has left, Erzebet uses a dark and hidden power of hers, reviving Allysyn and Lane as some form of undead servants.
In Groznyj's dungeon we find the king talking with his imprisoned nephew, Mikal. There he tells Mikal of Erzebet's secret power, a power which Mikal cannot believe.
As this story arc progresses, we are also introduced to The Brillianti's task force, The Chorus. The Chorus is to help Lord Tak Tak as an additional force in the war against the knights of Teardrop.

===The Storm (issues #10-12)===
After a few calm months living in teardrop, the council has gathered to discuss the fate of young Košice. At the same time, Lord Tak Tak's forces invade the floating city of teardrop, allied with The Chorus.

== History ==

Backstage (the company) was founded by [[Allen Zwerdling]] and [[Ira Eaker (publisher)|Ira Eaker]] in New York City in December 1960 as a weekly tabloid-sized newspaper called ''Back Stage'' (later renamed ''Backstage'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.backstage.com/news/dec-2-1960-the-curtain-rises-on-a-brand-new-publication/|title=Dec. 2, 1960:  The Curtain Rises on a Brand New Publication|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zwerdling and Eaker had worked together for years as editor and advertising director, respectively, of the ''[[Show Business Weekly|Show Business]]'' casting newspaper, which was founded by Leo Shull as ''Actor's Cues'' in 1941. After Zwerdling and Eaker left ''Show Business'' they looked into creating a casting section within ''[[The Village Voice]]'' newspaper; but, having been turned down, they decided to launch ''Backstage'' on their own.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;{{cite news |first=Steven|last= McElroy|title=Allen Zwerdling, Theater Journalist, Dies at 86|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/27/theater/27zwerdling.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=26 January 2009|accessdate=27 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of its founding, ''Backstage'' (the [[newsmagazine]]) was primarily a casting paper for New York actors intended to compete with ''Show Business Weekly''. It gradually broadened its scope to include coverage of New York's television commercial production industry and a variety of performing arts, the former of which proved to be so lucrative advertising-wise that the commercial-production beat came to dominate the publication. Additionally, ''Backstage's ''reach began to slowly spread across the U.S., although the largest portion of its readership remained on the East Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.backstage.com/news/spotlight/back-stage-celebrates-50th-anniversary/|title=Back Stage Celebrates 50th Anniversary|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to the disparity between its main areas of coverage—a focus on casting and entertainment-industry job opportunities, general coverage of the performing arts (acting, legitimate theatre, cabaret, etc.), and its expanding coverage of the commercial production market—''Backstage'' eventually incorporated the film and video production elements of its coverage into a weekly pull-out section called ''Backstage Shoot,'' a sort of mini-publication with a special focus on the commercials industry.

Then, in 1975, ''Backstage'' opened a Los Angeles bureau and began to more actively extend its casting and editorial coverage across the U.S., with correspondents based in Boston, Florida, Chicago, London, and other key entertainment-industry-centric areas added to the Backstage roster over the years.

Around 1977, co-founder Ira Eaker's daughter, Sherry Eaker, joined ''Backstage'' as an editor and worked to further expand ''Backstage''{{'}}s editorial coverage, especially in the areas of theater criticism, cabaret, dance, union news, and advice columns for performers. Sherry Eaker also fostered a relationship between ''Backstage'' and its historical antecedent, the British-based newspaper ''[[The Stage]]'', which shared a similar look, printing schedule, and market-focus.

In 1986, ''Backstage'' was bought by Billboard Publications Inc. (BPI), owner of such publications as ''[[Billboard (magazine)]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/21/business/billboard-publications-is-purchased.html|title=Billboard Publications Is Purchased by Affiliated Publications After Acquiring Backstage|last=Fabrikant|first=Geraldine|date=1987-03-21|work=|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-07-11|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, BPI bought ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/07/business/hollywood-s-version-of-trade-wars.html|title=Hollywood's Version of Trade Wars|last=Angeles|first=A.

Writer Based In Los|date=1988-08-07|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Backstage and ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' along with a few other related brands, were grouped together within BPI, becoming its film and performing arts division, a group designed to compete with ''[[Variety (magazine)]]'' and other entertainment-industry trade publications. Backstage would become involved in a number of other acquisitions, mergers, spin-offs, and sales over the next few decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-01-15/business/fi-12141_1_hollywood-reporter|title=Dutch Giant Buys Parent Firm of 'The Reporter' :  Media: BPI, which puts out Hollywood paper as well as Billboard and Adweek, sells for $220 million.|last=BATES|first=JAMES|date=1994-01-15|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Backstage Shoot''===
{{main article|Shoot (advertising magazine){{!}}SHOOT}}
On July 6, 1990, the ''Backstage Shoot ''pull-out section of ''Backstage ''magazine'' ''was spun off into a full, standalone publication, ''SHOOT''. The concept was to have ''Backstage'' concentrate on actors, performing artists, and theatre, while ''SHOOT'' would continue to "serve the news and information needs of creative and production decision-makers at ad agencies, and executives &amp; artisans in the production industry" (according to their official press materials found on ShootOnline.com).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.shootonline.com/go/about|title=About SHOOT|website=SHOOTonline.com|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; To emphasize the change, the official ''Backstage'' tagline "The complete service weekly for the communications and entertainment industry" was switched to ''The Performing Arts Weekly''.

===''Ross Reports''===
Around this time, ''Backstage'' acquired the New York-based ''Ross Reports'' publication, a monthly digest founded in 1949 by [[Wallace A. Ross]].  ''The Ross Reports'' compiled information on casting directors, agents, managers, production companies, and upcoming film and television productions.

In early 1994, Netherlands-based company [[VNU]] bought ''Backstage'' owner BPI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/vnu-picks-up-us-publishing-firm-for-dollars-220m-bpi-purchase-fulfils-american-dream-1400124.html|title=VNU picks up US publishing firm for dollars 220m: BPI purchase fulfils|date=1994-01-15|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; VNU eventually came to own a variety of trade publications — including all of the BPI magazines as well as ''[[Mediaweek]],'' ''[[Adweek]], [[Film Journal International]]'', ''The Hollywood Creative Directory'', and many others — along with measurement company [[Nielsen Media Research]], and events such as [[ShoWest]] and the [[Clio Awards]].

===''Backstage West''===
Also in early 1994, ''Backstage'' Publisher Steve Elish hired a West Coast editor-in-chief, Rob Kendt, to help create a new publication, ''Back Stage West'', a weekly trade paper similar to the New York-based ''Backstage'' but with a special focus on the West Coast acting community and casting opportunities based in California. At the time, despite past efforts, ''Backstage'' was still popular primarily in the Northeast U.S.

Then, in 1997, Backstage.com was founded, which combined content from ''Backstage,'' ''Back Stage West'', and ''Ross Reports'' with selected news articles from ''The Hollywood Reporter'' and ''Billboard'' and original online-only content intended to reach a larger, international audience.

===''Drama-Logue''===
And in May 1998, ''Backstage'' under Publisher Steve Elish bought its chief LA competitor, ''Drama-Logue''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/las-back-stage-west-buys-drama-logue-magazine-com-75414|title=L.A.'s Back Stage West Buys Drama-Logue Magazine {{!}} Playbill|website=Playbill|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Drama-Logue company was founded by Bill Bordy in 1969 as a casting hotline, and in 1972 it became a weekly trade publication entitled ''The Hollywood Drama-Logue Casting Sheet'', commonly known simply as ''Drama-Logue''. Before the end of 1998, Drama-Logue's holdings were fully integrated into Backstage.com and ''Back Stage West''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/profile-of-an-acquisition-back-stage-west-drama-logue-actors-trade-weekly-circulates-new-spin-on-advertising-direction-78058262.html|title=Profile of an Acquisition: Back Stage West-Drama-Logue Actor's Trade Weekly Circulates New Spin on Advertising Direction|last=West/Drama-Logue|first=Back Stage|website=www.prnewswire.com|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;'','' which for a time became known as ''Back Stage West/Drama-Logue.'' However, the Drama-Logue brand name was slowly phased out.

===Backstage.com===
Beginning in the late 1990s, a number of [[casting (performing arts)]] information and entertainment job websites began cropping up, offering specialized online tools for actors, performers, and models, including online casting submission systems and video-enhanced resumes. Backstage.com, introduced by Publisher Steve Elish, was a leader in taking the casting industry online. Its early products included a paid member's area, which charged $9.95 per month for unlimited access to articles and casting calls across New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Florida, Las Vegas, and other key entertainment-industry hubs. The monthly fee also entitled subscribers to inclusion in the website's first iteration of a headshot and resume database.

Starting in 2000, writer-editor-filmmaker and web-developer Luke Crowe joined the company, and began working on the development of online casting tools for Backstage. He later edited this page to include his own name. Over the next few years, Backstage.com introduced options for casting directors to self-post breakdowns, a searchable acting-jobs database of casting notices, interactive audition lists, casting coverage in every state in the U.S., and an advanced headshot and resume talent database, among other new options, some of the first online tools ever developed for actors and casting directors. The number of new casting notices listed on Backstage.com each week expanded from the hundreds to the thousands over the next few years, while monthly site traffic increased from the hundreds-of-thousands to the millions.

In addition to encompassing all of the content from Backstage{{'}}s print publications, the website's scope continued to expand to include more online-exclusive casting notices and original online-only news stories, feature articles, entertainment-industry listings, and reviews. During this time period, several competitors challenged the brand, but it remained the industry leader. However, the competition eventually sparked major changes in Backstage{{'}}s development, and in October 2005 Backstage relaunched its print and online publications in order to regain its edge.

===Relaunches and acquisitions===
During this 2005 relaunch process, all Backstage publications were redesigned (including ''Backstage West''); various staffing changes took place; the East Coast/New York edition of ''Backstage'' was renamed ''Backstage East''; Backstage.com began publishing more articles on a daily basis and introduced more exclusive editorial content, blogs, feeds, and tools; and Casting. Backstage.com was founded, giving Backstage.com users access to even more advanced casting/job search, sort, alert, and application tools, along with a more robust talent database featuring resumes, pictures, video reels, and audio reels of thousands of working and aspiring actors and performers.

Around this same time, the primary ''Backstage'' [[tagline]] changed from "The Performing Arts Weekly" to "The Actor's Resource." A secondary branding slogan, "Casting You Can Trust — Since 1960" was also added and given prominent placement both on Backstage.com and on the front covers of the weekly East Coast and West Coast newspaper/magazine versions of Backstage. And sister publication ''SHOOT'' (and ShootOnline.com) was sold to another publishing company.

In 2006, a company called Valcon Acquisition B.V., run by a private equity group consortium, bought VNU, making Valcon the new owner of Backstage and all other VNU holdings. Then, on January 18, 2007, VNU rebranded itself [[The Nielsen Company]], with its trade-publication division being renamed Nielsen Business Media.

In early 2007, VP/Group Publisher Steve Elish retired from ''Backstage'' after 34 years. However, co-founder Ira Eaker's daughter, former longtime Backstage editor-in-chief Sherry Eaker, carried on her father's work as Backstage's editor at large, along with editor-at-large David Sheward, who left his executive editor position at Backstage after working for the brand for over 28 years. Former publishers include Steve Elish, Jeff Black, and Charlie Weiss. Former lead editors include Sherry Eaker, Rob Kendt, Jamie Painter Young, Daniel Holloway, Dany Margolies, Tom Penketh, Erik Haagensen, Roger Armbrust, Leonard Jacobs, David Fairhurst, Andrew Salomon, Dan Lehman, dance editor Jennie Schulman (who wrote for Backstage for over 40 continuous years, starting with its first issue on Dec. 2, 1960&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.backstage.com/news/centerstage-a-true-dance-devotee/|title = A True Dance Devotee: Jennie Schulman|website = Backstage|date = 21 February 2001|last = Eaker|first = Sherry}}&lt;/ref&gt;), film and television editor [[Jenelle Riley]], contributing editor Jackie Apodaca, and actor-columnist [[Michael Kostroff]] (known for his work in ''[[The Wire]]''), among others.

In October 2008, ''Backstage East'' and ''Backstage West'' were permanently combined into a single weekly publication with an expanded national focus. This new "national edition" was given the same name as the original 1960 edition: ''Back Stage''.&lt;ref name=NationalEdition&gt;{{cite news |first=Luke|last= Crowe|title=The New Backstage National Edition: More Casting — From Across the U.S.|url=http://backstage.blogs.com/blogstage/2008/10/the-new-back-stage-national-edition-more-castingfrom-across-the-us.html|work=[[Blog Stage]]|date=24 October 2008|accessdate=24 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Backstage'' also launched a number of blogs around this time, including [http://backstage.blogs.com/blogstage/ Blog Stage], [http://backstage.blogs.com/espresso/ Espresso], [http://www.backstage.blogs.com/unscripted/ Backstage Unscripted], and [http://backstage.blogs.com/the411faq/ The Backstage 411 Casting FAQ], all of which were discontinued in early 2012.

In early 2009, ''Ross Reports'' was renamed ''[http://www.rossreports.com/ Call Sheet by Backstage]'', working with ''The Hollywood Creative Directory'' to expand its listings to include a wider variety of entertainment-industry contacts.

In late 2009, ''Backstage'' and other Nielsen Business Media brands were sold to [[e5 Global Media]], which was later renamed [[Prometheus Global Media]], and then renamed Guggenheim Digital Media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/press-room/2009/pluribus_capital_and.html|title=Pluribus Capital and Guggenheim Partners to Acquire Eight Nielsen Business Media Brands including The Hollywood Reporter Billboard and Adweek|website=www.nielsen.com|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Backstage'' brand remained closely tied to its primary sister publications, ''The Hollywood Reporter'' and ''Billboard'', as well as the other e5 Global Media publications, such as ''Adweek'', ''Film Journal International'', and ''The Hollywood Creative Directory''. However, ''Backstage'' also carved out its own industry niche by focusing on the needs of actors, models, performers, and casting directors; publishing directories (such as ''Call Sheet'', a bimonthly listing of [[talent agent]]s, [[casting director]]s, and film productions), books (actor handbooks and biographies published under the [[Watson-Guptill]] imprint Backstage Books),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.backstage.com/news/back-stage-books-is-back/|title=Back Stage Books Is Back|access-date=2016-07-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814083529/http://www.backstage.com/news/back-stage-books-is-back/|archivedate=2016-08-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; casting-director mailing labels,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.backstage.com/mailing-labels/|title=Entertainment-Industry Mailing Labels and the Call Sheet Digital Edition|last=|first=|date=|website=www.backstage.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and special "insert" magazines (such as award-season nomination guides, theatre-school guides, and the ''ACTION'' magazine for actors interested in making their own movies); producing live events; and continuing the development of Internet casting technology.

''Backstage'' continued to be a resource for [[audition]] information, casting calls/casting notices, training opportunities, and entertainment-industry jobs, news, and interviews. Film and theatre were the main topics reviewed and reported upon, but the television, radio, dance, music, cabaret, voice-over, modeling, commercial advertising, and stand-up comedy industries were also included in ''Backstage''{{'}}s coverage.

In October 2011, media entrepreneur John Amato led Backstage through a spin-off from Prometheus Global Media as part of a new strategic partnership, with the new company being called Backstage, LLC. Prometheus shareholder [[Guggenheim Partners]] backed the sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2011/10/the-hollywood-reporters-parent-company-unloading-more-assets-to-cut-costs-prometheus-selling-back-stage-178490/|title=Update: Prometheus Selling 'Back Stage'; The Hollywood Reporter's Parent Company "Dropping Assets Like Flies Now"|last=Finke|first=Nikki|date=2011-10-03|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thr-backstagesold&gt;{{cite web|title=Prometheus Global Media, Investor Group Strike Alliance for Back Stage|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/prometheus-global-media-investor-group-243120|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, ''Backstage'' was relaunched again, changing its name from ''Back Stage'' (two words) to ''Backstage'' (one word), updating its logo and branding, completely rebuilding its website, and changing its print edition from a weekly tabloid-sized newspaper to a weekly full-color glossy magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foliomag.com/back-stage-ties-print-and-digital-together-redesign/|title=Backstage Ties Print and Digital Together with Redesign|last=|first=|date=|website=www.foliomag.com|access-date=2012-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2013, Backstage LLC acquired Sonicbids, a service designed to help musicians find [[Gig (music)|gigs]], for $15 million&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/01/30/backstage-acquires-music-promotion-startup-sonicbids-for-15m-to-build-a-linkedin-for-creatives/|title=Backstage Acquires Music Promotion Startup Sonicbids For $15M+ To Build A LinkedIn For Creatives|last=Empson|first=Rip|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, Prometheus Global Media, now fully owned by Guggenheim, bought the remainder of Backstage LLC. John Amato was made president of the Billboard Group, a new unit that would oversee ''Backstage'', ''Billboard'', and Sonicbids.&lt;ref name=billboard-group&gt;{{cite web|title=Guggenheim Digital Media Announces Formation of Billboard Group|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/branding/1558441/guggenheim-digital-media-announces-formation-of-billboard-group|work=Billboard.biz|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=variety-shakeup&gt;{{cite web|title=In Guggenheim Shakeup, Ross Levinsohn No Longer Overseeing THR or Billboard|url=https://variety.com/2014/biz/news/in-guggenheim-shakeup-ross-levinsohn-no-longer-overseeing-thr-or-billboard-1201036717/|work=Variety|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyp-bound&gt;{{cite web|title=Prometheus bound|url=https://nypost.com/2013/01/16/prometheus-bound/|work=New York Post|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=adweek-guggenbackstage&gt;{{cite web|title=Guggenheim Digital Media Buys Remaining Stake in Backstage, Sonic Bids|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/guggenheim-digital-media-buys-remaining-stake-backstage-sonic-bids-148658|work=Adweek|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, Backstage and Sonicbids were acquired by RZ Capital.&lt;ref name="nypost-mincontrol"&gt;{{cite web|title=THR editor Min gains control of Guggenheim’s Billboard|url=https://nypost.com/2014/01/08/min-gets-the-keys-to-billboard-hollywood-reporter/|website=The New York Post|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, Backstage expanded its online casting tools and editorial coverage to include a wider international scope, with an initial focus on casting in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.backstage.com/news/casting/london-now-casting-royal-caribbeans-cats-and-more-gigs/|title=London Now Casting: Royal Caribbean’s ‘Cats’ and More Gigs|work=Backstage.com|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, Backstage launched its first fully integrated mobile casting app.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://backstage.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004346086-App-Features|title=App Features|website=Backstage Help Center|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current team===
As of 2017, principals at ''Backstage'' included vice president and national casting editor Luke Crowe. Current ''Backstage'' writers and editors include managing casting editor Melinda Loewenstein and supervising casting editor Veronika Daddona, among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.backstage.ventures/|title=Backstage Media - Team Members|publisher=Backstage|website=www.backstage.ventures|language=en|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bleachers.jpg|thumb|220px|Wooden bleachers]]

'''Bleachers''', or '''stands''', are raised, tiered rows of benches found at [[sports]] fields and other spectator events.  Stairways provide access to the horizontal rows of seats, often with every other step gaining access to a row of benches.

Benches range from simple planks to elaborate ones with backrests.  Many bleachers are open to the ground below so that there are only the planks to sit and walk on. Some bleachers have vertical panels beneath the benches, either partially or completely blocking the way to the ground.

== Name origins ==
The open seating area in baseball was called the "bleaching boards" as early as 1877.&lt;ref name=seymour/&gt; The term "bleachers" used in the sense of benches for spectators can be traced back to at least 1889;&lt;ref name=etymonline/&gt; named as such because the generally uncovered wooden boards were "bleached by the sun".&lt;ref name=etymonline/&gt;&lt;ref name=oed_bleacher3/&gt;

''The Dickson Baseball Dictionary'' lists as a ''secondary'' definition the fans sitting in them. By the early 1900s, the term "bleachers" was being used for both the seating area and its occupants.

In modern usage, the term "bleachers" almost always refers only to the seating area, and those sitting there may be called "bleacher fans," or "bleacherites." Terms such as [[Chicago]]'s "bleacher bums," or [[Yankee Stadium]]'s [[Bleacher Creatures]] are also used.

== Types ==

Bleacher structures vary depending on the location, but most outdoor modern bleachers have either an aluminium tube or steel angle understructure (known as frame-type bleachers) or steel I-beams (known as an I-beam bleacher). Most smaller bleachers are frame-type bleachers and most larger bleachers are I-Beam bleachers. Bleachers range in size from small, modular, aluminum stands that can be moved around soccer or hockey fields to large permanent structures that flank each side of an [[American football]] field. Some bleachers have locker rooms underneath them. In indoor gyms, bleachers can be built in so that they slide on a track or on wheels and fold in an [[accordion]]-like, stacking manner. These type of bleachers are known as telescoping bleachers.

== Baseball ==

In baseball stadiums, the bleachers are usually located beyond the outfield fences. However, center-field bleachers are located in the line of sight of the batter, and the presence of fans makes it difficult for the batter to pick out the ball.  As a result, most stadiums have vacant areas or black backgrounds where the seats would be.  This is known as either the "Backdrop" or the [[Batter's eye]].  The old [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] featured black-painted vacant bleachers, nicknamed ''the black'' by baseball fans.

Though many stadiums offer only bleacher seating, in those that offer both seats and bleachers, the bleachers are typically in less desirable locations and/or have lower ticket prices, giving the term "bleachers" a connotation of lower-class seating.

== American Football ==

The popularity of American football has made seating on outdoor and indoor football fields a necessity. Professional football, colleges, high schools, and even middle schools have bleacher systems set up to accommodate their fans. They vary in size from 10 feet wide that seat 25 all the way to full stadiums that seat thousands and wrap around the entire field. It is not uncommon to see football bleachers that rise hundreds of feet into the air. American Football bleachers are commonly made from concrete or aluminum with concrete footings or superstructure underneath.

'''''Charlie Brooker's Gameswipe''''' is a special one-off British, [[video game]] culture show by [[Charlie Brooker]], aired in September 2009 during the BBC's Technology season. Following on from Brooker's ''[[Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe|Screenwipe]]'' and ''[[Newswipe with Charlie Brooker|Newswipe]]'', ''Gameswipe'' featured reviews of various video games and consoles as well as an insight into the video game industry.&lt;ref name="incgamers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.incgamers.com/News/18168/charlie-brookers-gameswipe-detailed |title=Charlie Brooker’s Gameswipe Detailed |publisher=incgamers |accessdate=8 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00n1j8q |title=Charlie Brooker's Gameswipe |publisher=BBC |accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The one-off special was very similar to its predecessors, in that Brooker, along with a camera and various games consoles, reviewed and previewed video games in the same style as ''Screenwipe''. Brooker claimed that it would attempt to prove that video games can be just as engaging as television and just as dumb. He said to "Expect pixels, joypads, some of the world's weirdest games, celebrity cameos and the occasional sound effect.”&lt;ref name="incgamers" /&gt;

In the show, Brooker reviews ''[[Wolfenstein (2009 video game)|Wolfenstein]]'', ''[[50 Cent: Blood on the Sand]]'' and ''[[The Beatles: Rock Band]]''. The show also contains contributions from [[Dara Ó Briain]], [[Robert Florence]], Ryan Macleod, Larry Bundy Jr, Rebecca Mayes and [[Graham Linehan]].

==Reception==
The debut airing of Gameswipe drew 361,000 viewers,&lt;ref name="MCV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/35987/Gameswipe-grabs-361000-viewersrn |title=Gameswipe grabs 361,000 viewers |publisher=MCV |date=30 September 2009 |accessdate=26 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; outdoing the typical performances of both Screenwipe and Newswipe.&lt;ref name="INTERVIEW - Charlie Brooker Part 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/features/556/INTERVIEW-Charlie-Brooker-Part-2 |title=INTERVIEW – Charlie Brooker (Part 2) |publisher=MCV |date=16 October 2009 |accessdate=26 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; UK video games trade magazine [[Market for Home Computing and Video Games|MCV]] said of the show: "It’s fair to say that the reaction from the industry to last night’s TV debut of Charlie Brooker’s Gameswipe was mixed. But if its intention was to offer an informed, reasoned and mature take on the games industry of both past and present, then it’s hard to regard the show as anything other than an overwhelming success."&lt;ref name="o, what did we think of Gameswipe?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/35972/So-what-did-we-think-of-Gameswipe |title=So, what did we think of Gameswipe? |publisher=MCV |date=30 September 2009 |accessdate=26 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The future==
In October 2009, Brooker told [[Market for Home Computing and Video Games|MCV Magazine]] that he would consider working on either a further episode of ''Gameswipe'' or, potentially, a brand new series, though he added that he himself may choose not to present the show.&lt;ref name="INTERVIEW - Charlie Brooker Part 2"/&gt;

'''Circus Contraption''' (founded in 1998) was the name of a one-ring [[circus]], [[vaudeville]] and [[dark cabaret]] troupe based in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. The troupe, which employs about a dozen performers, uses live, original music paired with old-style circus performances, heavily influenced by cabaret and vaudeville acts. The shows are conceived for adults and usually feature some mature content.

The troupe first performed at the Seattle Fringe Theatre Festival, but soon branched out to other venues around the U.S., including a U.S. tour in 2005.  Their local and touring shows, with names like "Bracing Curative," "Eat Circus," "The Beer, Bread &amp; Cheese Cabaret," "A Raree Show," and "Gallimaufry: An Evening of Jiggery-Pokery," played to sold-out audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://circuscontraption.com/shows.html|title=Circus Contraption: Shows|website=circuscontraption.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The troupe disbanded in 2009.  Joe Albanese (aka Dexter Mantooth) and Drew Keriakedes (aka Shmootzi the Clod) and three other victims were killed in the [[2012_Seattle_cafe_shooting_spree|Cafe Racer shooting]] on May 30, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2012/05/31/the-thursday-morning-news&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''comedian''' or '''comic''' is a person who seeks to [[entertainment|entertain]] an audience by making them [[Laughter|laugh]]. This might take many forms including [[Joke|jokes]], satirical observations, [[Amusement|amusing]] situations, acting foolish (as in [[Slapstick|slapstick]]) or employing [[prop comedy]]. A comedian who addresses an audience directly is called a [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]]. Other practises include the [[sitcom]], [[sketch comedy]] and [[improvisational theatre|improv]].

A popular saying, variously quoted but generally attributed to [[Ed Wynn]],&lt;ref name=Bartleby&gt;{{cite web|title=Simpson's Contemporary Quotations, 1988|url=http://www.bartleby.com/63/93/8993.html|accessdate=2008-04-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316092036/http://www.bartleby.com/63/93/8993.html|archivedate=2008-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is, "A comic says funny things; a comedian says things funny", which draws a distinction between how much of the [[comedy]] can be attributed to verbal content and how much to acting and persona.

A lot of creative and original comedy is based on surrealism and absurdity. Early pioneers in these comedic forms include [[Spike Milligan]] and [[Monty Python]]. Current examples include [[Vic and Bob]], [[Noel Fielding]] and [[Sam Simmons (comedian)|Sam Simmons]]. Elements of surreal and absurd comedy include the non-sequitur (where language or events do not follow a logical process/sequence), irony (where a message is conveyed in a way contrary to its content) and deadpan performance (in the face of surreal and absurd situations, furthering the absurdity).

Since the 1980s, a new wave of comedy, called [[alternative comedy]], has grown in popularity with more offbeat and experimental style. Alternative comedy was initially inspired by [[punk subculture|punk culture]] and rejected old comedy forms, the establishment and bigoted humour. [[Ben Elton]], [[Rik Mayall]], [[Malcolm Hardee]] and [[Alexi Sayle]] were among the most well-known 1980's alternative comedians. Alternative comedy experienced a revival since around 2010, with [[Stewart Lee]] promoting the liberal, progressive values of the movement and many younger comedians in the UK banding together in groups dedicated to alternative comedy including [[The Alternative Comedy Memorial Society]] and [[Weirdos Comedy Club|the Weirdos Collective]].

Many comics achieve a [[cult following]] while touring famous comedy hubs such as the [[Just for Laughs]] festival in [[Montreal]], the [[Edinburgh Fringe]], and [[Melbourne Comedy Festival]] in [[Australia]]. Often a comic's career advances significantly when they win a notable comedy award, such as the [[Edinburgh Comedy Award]] (formerly the Perrier comedy award). Comics sometimes foray into other areas of entertainment, such as film and television, where they become more widely known; e.g., [[Eddie Izzard]] or [[Ricky Gervais]].  However, a comic's stand-up success does not guarantee a film's critical or box office success.

==History==
===Ancient Greeks===
{{See also|Ancient Greek comedy}}
Comedians can be dated back to 425 BC, when [[Aristophanes]], a comic author and playwright, wrote ancient comedic plays. He wrote 40 comedies, 11 of which survive and are still being performed. Aristophanes' comedy style took the form of [[satyr plays]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YhaawA_m9SEC&amp;pg=PR9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Lysistrata | author=Aristophanes | pages=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shakespearean comedy===
{{See also|Shakespearean comedy}}
The English poet and playwright [[William Shakespeare]] wrote many comedies. A Shakespearean comedy is one that has a happy ending, usually involving marriages between the unmarried characters, and a tone and style that is more light-hearted than Shakespeare's other plays.

===Modern era===
[[File:Chaplin The Champion.jpg|thumb|[[Charlie Chaplin]] in the film ''[[The Champion (1915 film)|The Champion]]'', 1915]]

[[Charlie Chaplin]] was the most popular screen comedian of the first half of the 20th century. Chaplin and [[Stan Laurel]] were protégés of [[Fred Karno]], the English theatre impresario of British [[music hall]], and in his biography Laurel stated, "Fred Karno didn't teach Charlie [Chaplin] and me all we know about comedy. He just taught us most of it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burton|first1=Alan|title=Pimple, pranks &amp; pratfalls: British film comedy before 1930|date=2000|publisher=Flicks Books|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaplin wrote comedic [[silent films]] such as ''[[Modern Times (film)|Modern Times]]'' and ''[[The Kid (1921 film)|The Kid]]''. His films still have a major impact on comedy in films today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.montgomerycollege.edu/Departments/hpolscrv/msiegler.htm | title=Charlie Chaplin Biography | date=1 May 2001 | accessdate=2 December 2013 | author=Sigler, Michael S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most popular forms of modern-day comedy is [[stand-up comedy]]. Stand-up comedy is a comic monologue performed by one or more people standing on a stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/stand-up+comedy?s=t | title='stand-up comedy' definition | accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bob Hope]] was the most popular stand-up comedian of the 20th century, and also starred in numerous comedy films over a five-decade span.  Other noted stand-up comedians include [[Billy Connolly]], [[George Carlin]], [[Richard Pryor]], [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Mort Sahl]], [[Louis CK]] and [[Chris Rock]].

[[Radio]] has been a proving-ground for many comedians. [[Ricky Gervais]] career began at a London radio station called [[XFM]] and [[Chris Morris (satirist)]] began his career at Radio Cambridgeshire. [[The League of Gentlemen]], [[Mitchell and Webb]] and [[The Mighty Boosh]] all transferred to television after broadcasting on [[BBC Radio 4]]. Between 2002 and 2011 [[BBC Radio 6 Music]] used to feature regular shows presented by comedians including [[Phil Jupitus]], [[Stephen Merchant]] and [[Adam &amp; Joe]]. Now BBC radio comedy is mainly available on BBC Radio 4 and [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]]. Before television, radio was one of the main ways to enjoy comedy, [[The Goon Show]] and [[Hancock's Half Hour]] being among the most popular early shows.

On television there are comedy talk shows where comedians make fun of current news or popular topics. Such comedians include [[Jay Leno]], [[Conan O'Brien]], [[Graham Norton]], [[Daniel Tosh]], [[Chris Hardwick]], [[Jimmy Fallon]], [[David Letterman]], and [[Chelsea Handler]]. There are sketch comedies, such as [[Kids In The Hall and [[Monty Python]] who created their sketch comedy show ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' (a [[BBC]] show that influenced ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''), then there are sitcoms, for example [[Friends]], [[Porridge (TV series)|Porridge]] and [[Father Ted]], as well as popular panel shows like [[QI]], [[Spicks and Specks (TV series)|Spicks and Specks]] and [[8 out of 10 Cats]].

Comedy is increasingly enjoyed online. Comedians with popular long-running podcasts series include [[Ricky Gervais]], [[Richard Herring]] and [[Scott Aukerman]]. Comedians streaming video of their standup include [[Bridget Christie]], [[Louis C.K.]] and [[Daniel Kitson]]. Many comedians publicise their work and build an audience through social media, especially [[Twitter]].

==Jokes==
There are many established formats for jokes. One example is the [[pun]] or double-entendre, where similar words are interchanged. [[The Two Ronnies]] often used puns and double-entendre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-12068221 BBC News - Ronnie Corbett Christmas Return]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bec Hill]] and [[Tim Vine]] are examples of current comedians who deploy numerous puns. Jokes based on puns tend to be very quick and easy to digest, which sometimes leads to other joke forms being overlooked, for example in the Funniest Joke of the Fringe awards. Other jokes may rely on confounding an audience's expectations through a misleading setup (known as a 'pull back and reveal' in the UK and a 'leadaway' in the US).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chortle.co.uk/correspondents/2010/09/22/11771/missing_a_trick Chortle - Missing A Trick]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ed Byrne (comedian)|Ed Byrne]] is an example of a comedian who has used this technique.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chortle.co.uk/correspondents/2010/09/22/11771/missing_a_trick Chortle - Missing A Trick]&lt;/ref&gt; Some jokes are based on [[ad absurdum]] extrapolations, for example much of [[Richard Herring]] and [[Ross Noble]]'s standup.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQ9eqdqQLXw Russel Howard's Good News Extra]&lt;/ref&gt;. In [[irony|ironic]] humour there is an intentional mismatch between a message and the form in which it is conveyed (for example the work of [[Danielle Ward]]). Other joke forms include observation (eg. [[Peter Kay]]), whimsy (eg. [[Bill Bailey]]), self-deprecation (eg. [[Daniel Kitson]]) and parody (eg. [[Jennifer Saunders]]).

==Personality traits==
In a January 2014 study, conducted in the ''[[British Journal of Psychiatry]]'',  scientists found that comedians tend to have high levels of [[psychotic]] personality traits. In the study, researchers analyzed 404 male and 119 female comedians from [[Australia]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and the [[United States]]. The participants were asked to complete an online questionnaire designed to measure psychotic traits in healthy people. They found that comedians scored "significantly higher on four types of psychotic characteristics compared to a control group of people who had non-creative jobs." Gordon Claridge, a professor of experimental psychology at the [[University of Oxford]] and leader of the study claimed, "the creative elements needed to produce humor are strikingly similar to those characterizing the cognitive style of people with psychosis—both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder."&lt;ref name=Kelland-Psychotic&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelland|first=Kate|title=Comedians have psychotic personality traits, study finds|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/16/us-comedians-psychotic-idUSBREA0F00M20140116|accessdate=31 January 2014|newspaper=Reuters|date=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, labeling comedians' personality traits as "psychotic" does not mean that individual is a psychopath,&lt;ref name=Seubsaeng-Study&gt;{{cite news|last=Suebsaeng|first=Asawin|title=Study Says Comedians Have Psychotic Personality Traits—Here's What Some Comedians Have To Say About That|url=https://www.motherjones.com/mixed-media/2014/01/study-comedians-psychotic-traits-rob-delaney-steve-hofstetter|accessdate=31 January 2014|newspaper=Mother Jones|date=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cooper-White&gt;{{cite news|last=Cooper-White|first=Macrina|title=Comedians Have 'High Levels' Of Psychotic Personality Traits, New Study Shows|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/17/comedians-psychotic-personality-traits_n_4610414.html|accessdate=31 January 2014|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; since [[psychopathy]] is distinct from [[psychosis]], and neither does it mean their behavior is necessarily pathological.

'''El Sonido de mi Tierra''' is a company from Argentina, for Tango Argentino and Folklore Argentino, foundet by [[Luis Pereyra]] in 1996. "El Sonido de mi Tierra" means "The sound of my land". 
'''The Great Dance of Argentina''' is the international name of the same company, but used outside of Argentina and Spanish speaking countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-great-dance-of-argentina.de, Company and Production Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; Both names are of the same company and same production.

== History ==
"El Sonido de mi Tierra" was founded in 1996 with the "peña folklóica artística", organized by Luis Pereyra in "La Galería de Tango". He promoted an event in [[Buenos Aires]], with the idea to bring together artists of both cultures of Argentina, which has been separated always: those of Argentine Folklore and those of Tango Argentino, and in this way he created a unification of one complete culture of Argentina, which represents all provinces of Argentina, which are 23, bringing them to a culture and art unification.

The creator of the company is Luis Pereyra. In 2001 [[Nicole Nau]] entered the company. 2003 she becomes first dancer of the company and also gets in the general and executive production. Nicole Nau and Luis Pereyra are members of [[CID Unesco]].

1998 the company "El Sonido de mi Tierra" performs in theatre, the Teatro Avenida, [[Buenos Aires]] and presents "Tango La Danza de fuego", a production which tells the story of "Orillas Maldonadas", written by Luis Pereyra, based on "El hombre de la ezquina rosada" of [[Jorge Luis Borges]]. In 2003 the company travels to [[Europe]], later to [[Japan]] and [[Centeramerica]].

In 2012 appears for the first time the name "The Great Dance of Argentina". This name the company since then is using for international workm keeping the original name "El Sonido de mi Tierra" as always besides.

Condition and habilities to get artist of this company is foundet knowledge of popular dances and music of Argentina, Tango Argentino, percussion, tap dance, vocal and playing instruments.

Luis Pereyra and this company work with Tango and Folklore on a same level, as one only culture which belongs together. He follows strictly his principles to understand Tango Argentino as part of the whole Argentine Culture and Folklore. Being from Buenos Aires, the ango Argentino is the urban folklore. Roots of Folklore, Black Music, natives, migration inside the country and from abroad are showing up, in the relationship between Tango and Folklore. The instruments Luis Pereyra is using are the authentic ones of his country and those introduced by immigrants. The stage productions tells of the deepness of the culture, orientated on roots, archaic culture and symbols.

[[File:EGBA_Logo.jpg|frame]]
The '''European Gaming and Betting Association (EGBA)''' is the main association representing the leading privately owned European online betting and gaming operators, licensed in the [[European Union]]. EGBA promotes the implementation of a regulated and competitive market for online gambling operators throughout Europe in line with EU law. The association was created in 2007 and represents 7 member companies and three trade associations. Its headquarters are located in [[Brussels]].

== History ==
EGBA was created in February 2007 and was formerly known as the European Betting Association. Maarten Haijer serves as the association’s Secretary-General since April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.igamingbusiness.com/egba-promotes-haijer EGBA promotes Haijer]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership ==
EGBA is composed of seven leading online betting companies: 
* [[Bet365]]
* [[Bet-at-home.com|Bet-at-home]]
* [http://www.betcliceverestgroup.com/edito/ Betclic] and [[Expekt.com|Expekt]]
* [[Betsson]]
* [http://www.gvc-plc.com/index.asp GVC Holdings PLC]
* [[Kindred Group]]  
* [http://www.zeal-network.co.uk/websites/zeal/English/0/welcome.html ZEAL]
Three national associations are affiliate members of EGBA:
* [http://gbga.gi/ Gibraltar Betting and Gaming Association] 
* [http://bos.nu BOS] 
* [https://ovwg.at/en OVWG]

== Objectives ==
EGBA promotes the creation of a safe and reliable European digital environment for online gambling players. A well-functioning digital environment requires regulation that provides a high level of [[consumer protection]] and takes into account the reality of the [[digital economy]] and consumer demand. It must also ensure that the regulated offer can be attractive enough to appeal to the maximum number of players so as to channel them away from unregulated offers.

== Actions and Partnerships ==

=== Responsible Gaming Day ===
Each year, EGBA organises a high level conference “[http://responsiblegamingday.eu/ Responsible Gaming Day]”. The latest edition took place in the [http://www.bibliothequesolvay.be/ Solvay Library] in Brussels. The conferences have become an annual meeting on European gambling policy gathering representatives from European institutions, national regulators and other stakeholders of the gambling sector. The event, which has been running since 2008, provides an opportunity for a fact-based discussion of best practices for responsible gaming and betting in the EU.

=== Partnership with ESSA ===
All EGBA members are also members of the [http://www.eu-ssa.org/ European Sports Security Association] (ESSA) whose objective is to promote sport integrity and combat [[match-fixing]]. Thanks to an early warning system, ESSA members are able to identify unusual betting patterns in sport competitions and to immediately inform the competent sports authorities.

=== Partnership with EU Athletes ===
In 2010, EGBA entered into a partnership with the European Elite Athletes Association ([http://www.euathletes.org/ EU Athletes]) to fund a campaign to educate players on match fixing: the [http://www.protect-integrity.com/about-the-campaign.html Protect Integrity] project. The co-funded European Commission project, which is supported by the European Elite Athletes Association, EGBA and the European Sports Security Association (ESSA) began in 2010 and has been prolonged following considerable success. In October 2015, the Protect Integrity project received €488,305 in funding from the [http://www.euathletes.org/media-press/news-from-eu-athletes/eu-athletes-news/article/european-commission-funds-betting-industry-backed-player-education-project.html?tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=361&amp;cHash=d7cf0d5a60f2d867f848192ee959addb European Commission], ensuring that it continues for another 2 years, kicking off in January 2016 until the end of 2017. The project teaches 15.000 professional athletes about sports betting integrity.

=== Memorandum of Understanding with the IOC ===
Prior to the Winter Olympics in 2014, EGBA, ESSA and the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) agreed on a new information reporting arrangement regarding suspicious betting activities. The agreement, which runs until the summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, aims to safeguard major sport competitions from manipulation linked to betting.

=== CEN Workshop Agreement ===
All EGBA operators adhere to the Workshop Agreement on “Responsible Remote Gambling Measures” published by the [[European Committee for Standardization]] (CEN). In absence of pan-European regulations on gambling, the workshop agreement provides for evidence based self-regulatory control measures which aim to create a safe and secure environment for customers throughout the EU.

=== EGBA News ===
EGBA publishes a quarterly [http://www.egba.eu/news-centre/egba-news/ newsletter] discussing current issues of the gambling sector at EU level. The issue of April 2014 featured a contribution&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egba.eu/media/EGBA-Newsletter-14th-Edition-final-version1.pdf Online Gambling: results and challenges for the future]&lt;/ref&gt; from European Commissioner [[Michel Barnier]] in which he outlines the achievements and opportunities of and related to the online gambling sector.

== The European Online Gambling Sector ==
Online gambling is a rapidly growing sector within the European Union. Revenues in Europe are expected to reach €13 billion in 2015, up from €9,3 billion in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://euobserver.com/online-gambling/123649 Gambling in the EU: A long way from harmonised rules]&lt;/ref&gt; The online gambling segment is projected to represent 15% of the total European gambling market in 2015.

'''Evolutionary musicology''' is a subfield of [[biomusicology]] that grounds the psychological mechanisms of [[music perception]] and [[music production (music psychology)|production]] in [[evolutionary theory]]. It covers [[Animal communication|vocal communication]] in non-human animal species, theories of the evolution of human music, and cross-cultural human universals in musical ability and processing.

== History ==
The origins of the field can be traced back to [[Charles Darwin]] who wrote in his [[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|Descent of Man]]:
: "When we treat of sexual selection we shall see that primeval man, or rather some early progenitor of man, probably first used his voice in producing true musical cadences, that is in singing, as do some of the gibbon-apes at the present day; and we may conclude from a widely-spread analogy, that this power would have been especially exerted during the courtship of the sexes,—would have expressed various emotions, such as love, jealousy, triumph,—and would have served as a challenge to rivals.  It is, therefore, probable that the imitation of musical cries by articulate sounds may have given rise to words expressive of various complex emotions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|authorlink=[[Charles Darwin]]|title=The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|year=1871|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext00/dscmn10.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory of a musical protolanguage has been revived and re-discovered repeatedly, often without attribution to Darwin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Origins of Music|year=2000|publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |author=Nils L. Wallin, Björn Merker, and Steven Brown (Editors)|isbn=0-262-23206-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven Mithen, ''The Singing Neanderthals: the Origins of Music, Language, Mind and Body'', Harvard University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The origins of music ==
{{See also|Prehistoric music|Music archaeology|Cognitive neuroscience of music}}
Two major topics for any subfield of [[evolutionary psychology]] are the adaptive function (if any) and phylogenetic history of the mechanism or behavior of interest including when music arose in human ancestry and from what ancestral traits it developed. Current debate addresses each of these.

One part of the adaptive function question is whether music constitutes an evolutionary [[adaptation]] or [[exaptation]] (i.e. by-product of evolution). [[Steven Pinker]], in his book ''[[How the Mind Works]]'', for example, argues that music is merely "auditory [[cheesecake]]"—it was evolutionarily adaptive to have a preference for fat and sugar but cheesecake did not play a role in that selection process. This view has been directly countered by numerous music researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Perlovsky L. Music. Cognitive Function, Origin, And Evolution Of Musical Emotions. WebmedCentral PSYCHOLOGY 2011;2(2):WMC001494&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alison Abbott. 2002. Neurobiology: Music, maestro, please! Nature 416, 12–14 (7 March 2002) | doi:10.1038/416012a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steven Pinker's Cheesecake For The Mind"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Abstracts/Carroll_C98.html | title=Steven Pinker's Cheesecake For The Mind | publisher=Cogweb.ucla.edu | year=1998 | accessdate=29 December 2012 | author=Carroll, Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adaptation, on the other hand, is highlighted in hypotheses such as the one by Edward Hagen and Gregory Bryant which posits that human music evolved from animal territorial signals, eventually becoming a method of signaling a group's social cohesion to other groups for the purposes of making beneficial multi-group alliances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hagen|first=Edward H|author-link=|last2=Bryant|first2=Gregory A|author2-link=|title=Music and dance as a coalition signaling system|journal=Human Nature|volume=14|issue=1|pages=21–51|year=2003|url=http://itb.biologie.hu-berlin.de/~hagen/papers/music.pdf|doi=10.1007/s12110-003-1015-z|id=|access-date=3 December 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612013500/http://itb.biologie.hu-berlin.de/~hagen/papers/music.pdf|archive-date=12 June 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hagen |first=Edward H |author2=Hammerstein P |year=2009 |title=Did Neanderthals and other early humans sing? Seeking the biological roots of music in the loud calls of primates, lions, hyenas, and wolves |journal=Musicae Scientiae |url=http://anthro.vancouver.wsu.edu/media/PDF/musicae.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The bipedalism hypothesis===
The evolutionary switch to bipedalism may have influenced the origins of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larsson|first=Matz|title=Self-generated sounds of locomotion and ventilation and the evolution of human rhythmic abilities|journal=Animal Cognition|date=August 2013|doi=10.1007/s10071-013-0678-z|volume=17|pages=1–14|pmc=3889703}}&lt;/ref&gt; The background is that noise of locomotion and ventilation may mask critical auditory information. Human locomotion is likely to produce more predictable sounds than those of non-human primates. Predictable locomotion sounds may have improved our capacity of entrainment to external rhythms and to feel the beat in music. A sense of rhythm could aid the brain in distinguishing among sounds arising from discrete sources and also help individuals to synchronize their movements with one another. Synchronization of group movement may improve perception by providing periods of relative silence and by facilitating auditory processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larsson|first=Matz|title=Possible functions of the octavolateralis system in fish schooling|journal=Fish and Fisheries|year=2009|volume=10|pages=344–355|doi=10.1111/j.1467-2979.2009.00330.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larsson|first=Matz|title=Incidental sounds of locomotion in animal cognition|journal=Animal Cognition|year=2012|volume=15|issue=1|pages=1–13|doi=10.1007/s10071-011-0433-2|pmc=3249174}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adaptive value of such skills to early human ancestors may have been keener detection of prey or stalkers and enhanced communication. Thus, bipedal walking may have influenced the development of entrainment in humans and thereby the evolution of rhythmic abilities. Primitive hominids lived and moved around in small groups. The noise generated by the locomotion of two or more individuals can result in a complicated mix of footsteps, breathing, movements against vegetation, echoes, etc. The ability to perceive differences in pitch, rhythm, and harmonies, i.e. “musicality,” could help the brain to distinguish among sounds arising from discrete sources, and also help the individual to synchronize movements with the group. Endurance and an interest in listening might, for the same reasons, have been associated with survival advantages eventually resulting in adaptive selection for rhythmic and musical abilities and reinforcement of such abilities. Listening to music seems to stimulate release of dopamine. Rhythmic group locomotion combined with attentive listening in nature may have resulted in reinforcement through dopamine release. A primarily survival-based behavior may eventually have attained similarities to [[dance]] and music, due to such reinforcement mechanisms . Since music may facilitate social cohesion, improve group effort, reduce conflict, facilitate perceptual and motor skill development, and improve trans-generational communication,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huron|first=David|title=Is music an evolutionary adaptation?|journal=Ann N Y Acad Sci|year=2001|volume=930|pages=43–61|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb05724.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; music-like behavior may at some stage have become incorporated into human culture.

Another proposed adaptive function is creating intra-group bonding. In this aspect it has been seen as complementary to language by creating strong positive emotions while not having a specific message people may disagree on. Music's ability to cause [[Entrainment (biomusicology)|entrainment]] (synchronization of behavior of different organisms by a regular beat) has also been pointed out. A different explanation is that signaling fitness and creativity by the producer or performer in order to attract mates. Still another is that music may have developed from human mother-infant auditory interactions ([[motherese]]) since humans have a very long period of infant and child development, infants can perceive musical features, and some infant-mother auditory interaction have resemblances to music.&lt;ref name=Oxford2007&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, Edited by Robin Dunbar and Louise Barret, Oxford University Press, 2007, Chapter 45 Music and cognitive evolution.&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the problem in the debate is that music, like any complex cognitive function, is not a holistic entity but rather [[Modularity of mind|modular]]&lt;ref&gt;Fodor, Jerry A. (1983). Modularity of Mind: An Essay on Faculty Psychology. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press. {{ISBN|0-262-56025-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;—perception and production of [[rhythm]], [[melody|melodies]], [[harmony]] and other musical parameters may thus involve multiple cognitive functions with possibly quite distinct evolutionary histories.&lt;ref&gt;Honing, H. (ed.) (2018). The Origins of Musicality. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Musilanguage hypothesis ===
{{Undue weight section|date=August 2011}}
"Musilanguage" is a term coined by Steven Brown to describe his hypothesis of the ancestral human traits that evolved into language and musical abilities. It is both a model of musical  and linguistic evolution and a term coined to describe a certain stage in that evolution. Brown argues that both music and human language have origins in a  "musilanguage" stage of evolution and that the structural features shared by music and language are not the results of mere chance parallelism, nor are they a function of one system emerging from the other. This model argues that "music emphasizes sound as emotive meaning and language emphasizes sound as referential meaning."&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite book|author=Brown S|veditors=Wallin NL, Merker B, Brown S |date=1999-12-03|chapter=The "Musilanguage" Model of Music Evolution|title=The Origins of Music|isbn=0-262-23206-5|publisher=The MIT Press|pages=271&amp;ndash;301}}&lt;/ref&gt; The musilanguage model is a structural model of music evolution, meaning that it views music's acoustic properties as effects of homologous precursor functions.  This can be contrasted with functional models of music evolution, which view music's innate physical properties to be determined by its adaptive roles.

The musilanguage evolutionary stage is argued to exhibit three properties found in both music and language: lexical tone, combinatorial phrase formation, and expressive phrasing mechanisms.  Many of these ideas have their roots in existing phonological theory in linguistics, but Brown argues that phonological theory has largely neglected the strong mechanistic parallels between melody, phrasing, and rhythm in speech and music. 
::Lexical tone refers to the pitch of speech as a vehicle for semantic meaning.  The importance of pitch to conveying musical ideas is well-known, but the linguistic importance of pitch is less obvious.  [[Tone (linguistics)|Tonal language]]s such as Thai and Cantonese, wherein the lexical meaning of a sound depends heavily on its pitch relative to other sounds, are seen as evolutionary artifacts of musilanguage.  Non-tonal, or "intonation" languages, which do not depend heavily on pitch for lexical meaning, are seen as evolutionary late-comers which have discarded their dependence on tone.  Intermediate states, known as [[pitch accent]] languages, which exhibit some lexical dependence on tone, but also depend heavily on intonation, are exemplified by [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language]].

::Combinatorial formation refers to the ability to form small phrases from different tonal elements.  These phrases must be able to exhibit melodic, rhythmic, and semantic variation, and must be able to combine with other phrases to create global [[melodic formula]]s capable of conveying emotive meaning.  Examples in modern speech would be the rules for arranging letters to form words and then words to form sentences.  In music, the notes of different scales are combined according to their own unique rules to form larger musical ideas.

::Expressive [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]] is the device by which expressive emphasis can be added to the phrases, both at a local (in the sense of individual units) and global (in the sense of phrases) level.  There are numerous ways this can occur in both speech and music that exhibit interesting parallels.  For instance, the increase in the amplitude of a sound being played by an instrument accents that sound much the same way that an increase in amplitude can emphasize a particular point in speech.  Similarly, speaking very rapidly often creates a frenzied effect that mirrors that of a fast and agitated musical passage.

===AVID model of music evolution===
[[Joseph Jordania]] has suggested that music (as well as several other universal elements of contemporary human culture, including [[dance]] and [[body painting]]) was part of a predator control system used by early [[hominids]]. He suggested that rhythmic loud singing and drumming, together with the threatening rhythmic body movements and body painting, was the core element of the ancient "Audio-Visual Intimidating Display" (AVID).&lt;ref&gt;Jordania J. ''[[Who Asked the First Question?]] The Origins of Human Choral Singing, Intelligence, Language and Speech'' (2006) Logos&lt;/ref&gt; AVID  was also a key factor in putting the hominid group into a specific [[altered state of consciousness]] which he calls  "battle trance" where they would not feel fear and pain, and would be religiously dedicated to group interests. Jordania suggested that listening and dancing to the sounds of loud rhythmic rock music, used in many contemporary combat units before the combat missions is directly related to this.&lt;ref&gt;Jordania, J. (2009) ''Times to fight and times to relax: Singing and humming at the beginning of Human evolutionary history'' 1: 272-277&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the defense from predators, Jordania suggested that this system was the core strategy to obtain food via confrontational, or aggressive [[scavenging]].

Apart from loud rhythmic singing-stomping-dancing, Jordania also suggested that soft [[humming]] could have played an important role in the early human ([[hominid]]) evolution as [[contact calls]]. Many [[social animals]] produce seemingly haphazard and indistinctive sounds (like chicken cluck) when they are going about their everyday business ([[foraging]], feeding). These sounds have two functions: (1) to let group members know that they are among kin and there is no danger, and (2) in case of the appearance of any signs of danger (suspicious sounds, movements in a forest), the animal that notices danger first, stops moving, stops producing sounds, remains silent and looks in the direction of the danger sign. Other animals quickly follow suit and very soon all the group is silent and is scanning the environment for the possible danger. [[Charles Darwin]] was the first to notice this phenomenon on the example of the wild horses and the cattle.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. ''Descent of Men'', 2004:123&lt;/ref&gt; Jordania suggested that for humans, as for many [[social animals]], silence can be a sign of danger, and that's why gentle humming and musical sounds relax humans (see the use of gentle music in [[music therapy]], [[lullaby|lullabies]])

'''ExploreMusic''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] multimedia rock music recommendation project run by [[Corus Entertainment|Corus Interactive]] and [[Integrated Solutions]], the online arm of [[Corus Entertainment#Radio shows|Corus Radio]].  It consists of a website, a syndicated radio show, and a weekly TV show that offers exposure to songs and artists with the vision of providing "context, perspective, recommendation and discovery of music that’s new (or new to you)."{{citation needed|date=September 2009}} ExploreMusic achieves this through artist interviews, exclusive performances, music news, album reviews, and lists of recommended songs that are presented on a daily and weekly basis. 

The program was first broadcast on 6 October 2008, and is heard on radio stations across [[Canada]]. It has a weekly audience of approximately one million. The program is also syndicated in the [[United States]]. A television adaptation of the program currently airs on [[Aux (TV channel)|Aux]].

==Creation==
Prior to the launch of ExploreMusic, there had been a number of discussions within Corus about the need to update the concept of the radio DJ as the trusted filter for new music. With online being the first choice of more and more people looking for new music, the decision was made to create a service where "real people, real passionate music fans, could recommend music to other real passionate music fans, without any sort of mechanical or electronic filters."&lt;ref name="CityTV" /&gt; The concept was inspired by the success of [[Pandora (music service)|Pandora]] and [[Last.fm]].&lt;ref name="CityTV" /&gt; However, while Pandora and Last.fm work on complex algorithms, ExploreMusic was designed as a place where music fans could turn to discover new music and information about the artists involved, as well as be encouraged to make recommendations themselves with the goal of creating conversation and community. On 1 July 2008, [[Alan Cross]], the host of ''[[The Ongoing History of New Music]]'' and former Program Director of Toronto radio station [[CFNY-FM|102.1 The Edge]], took the position of senior program director at Corus Interactive and Integrated Solutions (then known as Splice). Planning and development continued through the summer. 

The program was first broadcast on 6 October 2008 on [[CFNY-FM|102.1 The Edge]] in [[Toronto]], [[CJXY-FM|Y108]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[CFPL-FM|FM96]] in [[London, Ontario|London]], [[CJKR-FM|Power 97]] in [[Winnipeg]], and [[CFOX-FM|The Fox]] in [[Vancouver]]. The show has since been included on [[CILV-FM|Live 88.5]] in [[Ottawa]], [[CJSS-FM|Rock 101.9]] in [[Cornwall, Ontario|Cornwall]], [[CFEX-FM|X92.9]] in [[Calgary]], [[CHDI-FM|SONiC 102.9]] in [[Edmonton]], and [[CKWF-FM|The Wolf 101.5]] in [[Peterborough, Ontario]], with plans to branch out to more affiliates in the future.&lt;ref name="CityTV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/entertainment/movies/article/5933--veteran-radio-host-alan-cross-launches-music-discovery-project-exploremusic-on-air-and-online |title=Veteran Radio Host Alan Cross Launches Music Discovery Project ExploreMusic On-Air And Online |first=Suzanne |last=Ellis |work=[[Citytv|CityNews]] |date=2008-10-22 |accessdate=2009-10-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5keaSMOmG?url=http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/entertainment/movies/article/5933--veteran-radio-host-alan-cross-launches-music-discovery-project-exploremusic-on-air-and-online |archivedate=2009-10-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exploremusic.com/explore-music-radio |title=ExploreMusic: The Radio Show |publisher=ExploreMusic |accessdate=2009-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620214322/http://www.exploremusic.com/explore-music-radio |archivedate=June 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program began syndication in the United States after ExploreMusic partnered with [[FMQB|Friday Morning Quarterback]]. It currently airs on two US radio stations, [[WEDG|103.3 The Edge]] in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], and [[WRZX|X103]] in [[Indianapolis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fmqb.com/Article.asp?id=1524852 |title=ExploreMusic.com partners with FMQB to syndicate radio content in the U.S. |publisher=FMQB |accessdate=2009-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.exploremusic.com/press-release/2009-09-28/ExploreMusic-Ongoing-History-and-Legends-of-Classic-Rock-FINALLY-Go-International |title=Press Release: ExploreMusic, Ongoing History and Legends of Classic Rock FINALLY Go International! |first=Alan |last=Cross |authorlink=Alan Cross |publisher=ExploreMusic |date=2009-09-28 |accessdate=2009-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated one million people listen to the program each week in Canada.&lt;ref name="Huszar" /&gt;

==Program==
Five thirty-minute radio shows are produced and distributed each week. Meetings to determine the program content are held once a week. Each person attending the meeting brings a list of five songs, two that have been newly released and three that are a year or more older. They discuss the tracks and decide which ones to use on the broadcast, and which to add to the website.&lt;ref name="CityTV" /&gt; Cross noted that "we're appreciative of everybody's diverse tastes. The whole idea is to introduce people to music that is new and new to them."&lt;ref name="CityTV" /&gt; The programs are written and hosted by Alan Cross, and are recorded in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. The four pillars driving the show are context, perspective, recommendation, and discovery. Every song and story featured on ExploreMusic is created in accordance with those four pillars.

The typical show content includes the "Big new song of the day", "The Music News Countdown", which contains the program’s top five music stories of the day, the music recommendation "The Five Songs You Gotta Hear Today", and an abbreviated interview with a musical artist, which frequently includes an exclusive performance of a song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://podcasts.streamtheworld.com/podcast/audio-793-II51Nwm-1003073.rss |title=ExploreMusic with Alan Cross |publisher=Stream the World |accessdate=2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Apple 1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=292870843 |title=ExploreMusic with Alan Cross |publisher=iTunes Store |accessdate=2009-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, ExploreMusic TV debuted on [[BiteTV]], a Canadian digital tier channel aimed at males 18-34.  Hosted by Cross, the programme is a weekly roundtable discussion on music issues with guests from various parts of the music industry.  It currently airs on Aux, produced in cooperation with Corus Entertainment Inc. and GlassBOX Television Inc.  The show is currently in its second season on the channel.

===Web content===
The topics and categories on the ExploreMusic radio show are also included on the website, often enhanced by links, images, additional text, audio, and video.  The site is presented in blog format, with posts tagged as "News", "Reviews", "New Releases", "WTF", and other categories.

'''Finncon''' is the largest [[science fiction]] [[Science fiction convention|convention]] in [[Finland]] and, with up to 15,000 participants, one of the largest SF conventions in [[Europe]]. Finncon is unique among SF conventions because it has no participation/membership fee, and is funded primarily on various cultural grants as well as income from traders. The event is organised annually in different cities in Finland.

From 2003 to 2009 and in 2011 the convention included the anime convention [[Animecon (Finland)|Animecon]], which boosted the convention's attendance and public visibility significantly. Since then the conventions have separated, and the future of the Finnish Animecon is currently uncertain beyond the 2011 combined Finncon-Animecon.

Finncon alternates between different cities in Finland without a formal rota. Recently the event has been held almost every year, but occasionally a year is skipped if no city is found to host the event that year.

{{refimprove|date=January 2010}}

'''Flicker''' is a [[Visual perception|visible]] change in [[brightness]] between cycles displayed on [[video display]]s. It applies especially to the [[vertical refresh|refresh]] interval on [[Cathode ray tube]] (CRT) televisions and [[computer monitor]]s, as well as Plasma based [[computer display|computer screens]] and [[television]]s. 

==Occurrence==
Flicker occurs on [[cathode ray tube|CRT]]s when they are driven at a low [[refresh rate]], allowing the [[brightness]] to drop for time intervals sufficiently long to be noticed by a human eye&amp;nbsp;– see [[persistence of vision]] and [[flicker fusion threshold]]. For most devices, the screen's [[phosphor]]s quickly lose their excitation between sweeps of the [[electron gun]], and the afterglow is unable to fill such gaps&amp;nbsp;– see [[phosphor persistence]]. A refresh rate of 60&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] on most screens will produce a visible "flickering" effect. Most people find that refresh rates of 70–90&amp;nbsp;Hz and above enable [[flicker-free]] viewing on CRTs. Use of refresh rates above 120&amp;nbsp;Hz is uncommon, as they provide little noticeable flicker reduction and limit available resolution.

Flatscreen [[Plasma display]]s have a similar effect. The plasma pixels fade in brightness between refreshes.

In [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] screens, the LCD itself does not flicker, it preserves its opacity unchanged until updated for the next frame. However, in order to prevent accumulated damage LCD displays quickly alternate the voltage between positive and negative for each pixel, which is called 'polarity inversion'. Ideally, this wouldn't be noticeable because every pixel has the same brightness whether a positive or a negative voltage is applied. In practice, there is a small difference, which means that every pixel flickers at about 30&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref&gt;http://machineryequipmentonline.com/video-equipment/liquid-crystal-display-lcdpolarity-inversion/&lt;/ref&gt; Screens that use opposite polarity per-line or per-pixel can reduce this effect compared to when the entire screen is at the same polarity, sometimes the type of screen is detectable by using patterns designed to maximize the effect.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/inversion.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Much more of a concern is the [[LCD backlight]]. Earlier screens used [[fluorescent lamp]]s which flickered at 100 or 120&amp;nbsp;Hz; most modern screens use an electronic ballast that flickers at 25–60&amp;nbsp;kHz which is far outside the human perceptible range. [[LED-backlit LCD|LED backlights]] should not flicker at all, though some designs may "dim" themselves by switching on and off rapidly and noticeably.

Flicker is necessary for a [[movie projector]] to block the light as the film is moved from one frame to the next. The standard framerate of 24&amp;nbsp;fps produces very obvious flicker, so even very early movie projectors added additional vanes to the rotating shutter to block light even when the film was not moving. Most common is 3 vanes raising the rate to 72&amp;nbsp;Hz. Home movie projectors (and early theater projectors) often have four vanes, to raise the 18&amp;nbsp;fps used by silent film to 72&amp;nbsp;Hz. Digital projectors typically use [[Digital Light Processing|DLP]] mirrors which do not have flicker. [[RealD 3D|Some]] 3D projection rapidly alternates between the picture for each eye (alternating the polarization at the same rate) at 144&amp;nbsp;Hz. Movie projectors typically use an [[incandescent lamp]] or [[arc lamp]] which does not itself flicker.

Televisions use [[interlaced video]] so the screen flickers at twice the rate (50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz) that the image changes (25 or 30&amp;nbsp;Hz). This was considered necessary even in the very first televisions which used very slow phosphors.

The exact refresh rate necessary to prevent the perception of flicker varies greatly based on the viewing environment. In a completely dark room, a sufficiently dim display can run as low as 30&amp;nbsp;Hz without visible flicker.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} At normal room and TV brightness this same display rate would produce flicker so severe as to be unwatchable.

The human eye is most sensitive to flicker at the edges of the human field of view (peripheral vision) and least sensitive at the center of gaze (the area being focused on). As a result, the greater the portion of our field of view that is occupied by a display, the greater is the need for high refresh rates. This is why computer monitor CRTs usually run at 70 to 90&amp;nbsp;Hz, while TVs, which are viewed from further away, are seen as acceptable at 60 or 50&amp;nbsp;Hz (see [[Analog television#Standards|Analog television Standards]]).{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Chewing something [[Crunchiness|crunchy]] such as [[tortilla chip|tortilla chips]] or [[granola]] can induce flicker perception due to the vibrations from chewing synchronizing with the flicker rate of the display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=119579|title=Answer Geek:How Chewing Affects TV Flicker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software artifacts==

Software can cause flicker effects by directly displaying an unintended intermediate image for a short time. For example drawing a page of text by blanking the area to white first in the [[frame buffer]], then drawing 'on top' of it, makes it possible for the blank region to appear momentarily onscreen. Usually this is much faster and easier to program than to directly set each pixel to its final value.

When it is not feasible to set each pixel only once, [[double buffering]] can be used. This creates an off-screen drawing surface, drawing to it (with as much flicker as you want), and then copying it all at once to the screen. The result is the visible pixels only change once. While this technique cuts down on software flicker, it can also be very inefficient.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catch22.net/tuts/flicker.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Flicker is used intentionally by developers on low-end systems to create the illusion of more objects or colors/shades than are actually possible on the system, or as a speedy way of simulating transparency. While typically thought of as a mark of older systems like 16-bit game consoles, the flicker technique continues to be used on new systems, such as the [[temporal dithering]] used to fake [[True Color|true color]]&lt;!--target is case sensitive (June 2014)--&gt; on most new LCD monitors.

Video hardware outside the monitor can also cause flicker through many different timing and resolution-related artifacts such as [[screen tearing]], [[z-fighting]] and [[aliasing]].

==Health effects==
Flicker of a CRT monitor can cause various symptoms in those sensitive to it such as headaches in migraine sufferers and seizures in epileptics{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}.

As the flicker is most clearly seen at the edge of our vision there is no obvious risk in using a CRT, but prolonged use can cause a sort of retinal shock where the flickering is seen even when looking away from the monitor. This can create a sort of [[motion sickness]], a discrepancy between the movement detected by the fluid in the inner ear and the motion we can see. Symptoms include [[dizziness]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[headaches]] and (sometimes extreme) [[nausea]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} The symptoms usually disappear in less than a week without CRT use, and usually only last a few hours unless the exposure has been over a long period.

'''Fred Cherry''' (15 April 1926 &amp;ndash; 30 July 2003) was an [[United States|American]] [[activist]] for greater rights for [[janes (prostitution)|janes]] and [[John (prostitution)|johns]] (clients of [[prostitution|prostitute]]s). He gained some measure of fame as self-styled "elector of [[homophobia]]" in his fight against (in his own words) "the Organized [[Homosexual]] Conspiracy of America", who he said opposed his own fight to get his freedom to patronize prostitutes recognized as being a matter of [[civil rights]].

In 1985, Cherry, and [[Margo St. James]], filed a [[lawsuit]] against [[Ed Koch]], then mayor of [[New York City]], seeking to overturn New York's laws banning prostitution on the grounds that Cherry's [[disability]] would make it impossible for him to find sexual companionship other than prostitutes, thereby violating the [[equal protection clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. The lawsuit was dismissed.

Cherry helped make mathematical history when he published, in collaboration with such distinguished combinatorialists as E.T. Parker and Walter Wallis, a construction of orthogonal pairs of doubly diagonal [[Latin squares]] of order 10, thus completing the proof that such pairs exist for all orders other than 2,3 and 6. In his words: "this accomplishment gave me a tremendous boost in my self-esteem. Before I had done this, I used to think of myself as a rich bum. Now, I can truly call myself a mathematician, even though I only have a bachelor's degree in mathematics."

'''Freestyle wrestling''' is a style of [[amateur wrestling]] that is practiced throughout the world. Along with [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]], it is one of the two styles of wrestling contested in the [[Olympic games]]. [[United States|American]] [[high school]] and [[college]] wrestling is conducted under different rules and is termed [[scholastic wrestling|scholastic]] and [[collegiate wrestling]].
 
Freestyle wrestling, like collegiate wrestling, has its greatest origins in [[Catch wrestling|catch-as-catch-can wrestling]] and, in both styles, the ultimate goal is to throw and pin the opponent to the mat, which results in an immediate win. Freestyle and collegiate wrestling, unlike Greco-Roman, allow the use of the wrestler's or his opponent's legs in offense and defense. Freestyle wrestling brings together traditional wrestling, judo, and sambo techniques.

According to wrestling's world governing body, [[United World Wrestling|United World Wrestling (UWW)]], freestyle wrestling is one of the four main forms of amateur competitive [[wrestling]] that are practiced internationally today. The other main forms of wrestling are [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]] and [[grappling]] (also called [[submission wrestling]]). The Executive Board of the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) recommended dropping wrestling as a sport from the 2020 Olympic Games, but the decision was later reversed by the IOC.

==History==
[[Image:FreestyleWrestling3.jpg|thumb|250px|Freestyle wrestling has been in the [[Olympic Games]] since the 1904 Olympics in [[Saint Louis, Missouri|Saint Louis]], [[Missouri]].]]
Modern freestyle wrestling, according to [[United World Wrestling|UWW]] (formerly FILA), is said to have originated in [[Great Britain]] and the [[United States]] by the name of [[Catch wrestling|"catch-as-catch-can" wrestling]].&lt;ref name=FILAFreestylesite&gt;{{cite web| last =[[International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles]]| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Freestyle Wrestling| work =| publisher =[[International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles|FILA]]| date =| url =http://www.fila-official.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=33&amp;Itemid=75| format =| doi =| accessdate =2008-10-28| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110711001604/http://www.fila-official.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=33&amp;Itemid=75| archivedate =2011-07-11| df =}}
&lt;/ref&gt; "Catch-as-catch-can" wrestling had a particular following in [[Great Britain]] and the variant developed in [[Lancashire]] had a particular effect on freestyle wrestling.&lt;ref name=PoliakoffFreestyle1190&gt;"Wrestling, Freestyle" by Michael B. Poliakoff from ''Encyclopedia of World Sport: From Ancient Times to the Present'', Vol. 3, p. 1190, eds. David Levinson and Karen Christensen (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; "Catch-as-catch-can" wrestling gained great popularity in fairs and festivals during the 19th century. In catch-as-catch-can wrestling, both contestants started out standing and then a wrestler sought to hold his opponent's shoulder to the ground (known as a fall). If no fall was scored, both wrestlers continued grappling on the ground, and almost all holds and techniques were allowable. A [[Scotland|Scottish]] variant of Lancashire wrestling also became popular which began with both wrestlers standing chest to chest, grasping each other with locked arms around the body and, if no fall was made, with the match continuing on the ground.&lt;ref name="PoliakoffFreestyle1190" /&gt; In addition, there was the [[Irish people|Irish]] [[collar-and-elbow]] style, where wrestlers started out on their feet with both wrestlers grasping each other by the collar with one hand and by the elbow with the other. If neither wrestler then achieved a fall, the contestants would continue both standing and on the ground until a fall was made. Irish [[immigrants]] later brought this style of wrestling to the United States, where it soon became widespread, especially because of the success of the wrestling champion of the [[Army of the Potomac]], [[George William Flagg]] from [[Vermont]].&lt;ref name="PoliakoffFreestyle1190" /&gt; Catch-as-catch can was the style performed by at least a half dozen [[President of the United States|U.S. presidents]], including [[George Washington]], [[Zachary Taylor]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Andrew Johnson]], [[Ulysses S. Grant]], and [[Theodore Roosevelt]].&lt;ref name="FILAFreestylesite" /&gt;

Because of the widespread interest in and esteem of professional Greco-Roman wrestling and its popularity in many international meets in nineteenth century [[Europe]], freestyle wrestling (and wrestling as an amateur sport in general) had a tough time gaining ground on the continent. The 1896 Olympic Games had only one wrestling bout, a heavyweight Greco-Roman match.&lt;ref name="PoliakoffFreestyle1190" /&gt; Freestyle wrestling first emerged as an Olympic sport in the [[Saint Louis, Missouri|Saint Louis]] Olympics of 1904. All 40 wrestlers who participated in the 1904 Olympics were American. The 1904 Olympics sanctioned the rules commonly used for catch-as-catch can, but imposed some restrictions on dangerous holds. Wrestling by seven weight classes—47.6&amp;nbsp;kg (104.9&amp;nbsp;lb), 52.2&amp;nbsp;kg (115.1&amp;nbsp;lb), 56.7&amp;nbsp;kg (125.0&amp;nbsp;lb), 61.2&amp;nbsp;kg (134.9&amp;nbsp;lb), 65.3&amp;nbsp;kg (143.9&amp;nbsp;lb), 71.7&amp;nbsp;kg (156.7&amp;nbsp;lb), and greater than {{convert|71.7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}—was an important innovation in the [[Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name="FILAFreestylesite" /&gt;

Since 1921, the [[International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles|International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles (FILA)]], which has its headquarters near [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]], has set the "Rules of the Game", with regulations for scoring and procedures that govern tournaments such as the World Games and the competition at the Summer Olympics. These were later adopted by the [[Amateur Athletic Union|Amateur Athletic Union (AAU)]] for its freestyle matches. Freestyle wrestling gained great popularity in the [[United States]] after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. By the 1880s, tournaments drew hundreds of wrestlers. The rise of cities, increased industrialization, and the closing of the frontier provided the affable environment for amateur wrestling, along with [[boxing]], to increase in esteem and popularity. Amateur wrestling teams soon emerged, such as the wrestling team of the New York Athletic Club, which had its first tournament in 1878. [[History of professional wrestling in the United States#"Farmer" Burns-Frank Gotch era|Professional wrestling]] also developed, and by the 1870s, professional championship matches offered allowances of up to $1,000.&lt;ref name="PoliakoffFreestyle1190" /&gt;

Nineteenth century wrestling matches were particularly long, and especially [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]] bouts (where holds below the waist and the use of the legs are not allowed) could last as many as eight to nine hours, and even then, it was only decided by a draw.&lt;ref&gt;"Wrestling, Greco-Roman" by Michael B. Poliakoff from ''Encyclopedia of World Sport: From Ancient Times to the Present'', Vol. 3, p. 1196, eds. David Levinson and Karen Christensen (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, time limits were set for matches.&lt;ref name=PoliakoffFreestyle1191&gt;"Wrestling, Freestyle" by Michael B. Poliakoff from ''Encyclopedia of World Sport: From Ancient Times to the Present'', Vol. 3, p. 1191, eds. David Levinson and Karen Christensen (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; For more than forty years into the twentieth century, freestyle and its American counterpart, [[collegiate wrestling]], not have a scoring system that decided matches in the absence of a fall. The introduction of a point system by [[Oklahoma State University]] wrestling coach [[Art Griffith]] that gained acceptance in 1941 influenced the international styles as well. By the 1960s international wrestling matches in Greco-Roman and freestyle were scored by a panel of three judges in secret, who made the final decision by raising colored paddles at the match's end. [[Albert de Ferrari|Dr. Albert de Ferrari]] from [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] who became vice president of FILA, lobbied for a visible scoring system and a rule for "controlled fall", which would recognize a fall only when the offensive wrestler had done something to cause it. These were soon adopted internationally in Greco-Roman and freestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; By 1996, before a major overhaul of FILA rules, an international freestyle match consisted of two three-minute periods, with a one-minute rest between periods.&lt;ref name="PoliakoffFreestyle1191" /&gt; Today, wrestlers from [[Post-Soviet states]], Iran, U.S., Bulgaria, Cuba, Turkey, and Japan, have had the strongest showings. [[Alexander Medved]] of [[Belarus]] won 10 world championships and three Olympic gold medals, in the period of 1964-1972.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fila-official.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=768&amp;Itemid=100236&amp;lang=en{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Collegiate wrestling|collegiate]] wrestlers have moved on to freestyle competition, particularly internationally with great success.&lt;ref&gt;"Wrestling, Freestyle" by Michael B. Poliakoff from ''Encyclopedia of World Sport: From Ancient Times to the Present'', Vol. 3, p. 1193, eds. David Levinson and Karen Christensen (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 2013, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted wrestling out of the core sports for the summer Olympics beginning in 2020&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/olympics/wrestling/story/_/id/8939185/ioc-drops-wrestling-2020-olympics&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of this news the wrestling community started a massive campaign in order to reinstate the sport.  A largely online group called 2020 vision lead the movement.  They had several campaigns as well as Facebook and Twitter pages that spread awareness and gathered support for the cause of wrestling's return to the Olympics. They had a mission of gaining 2,000,020 signatures (online and offline) in support of wrestling's return to the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.themat.com/section.php?section_id=3&amp;page=showarticle&amp;ArticleID=26242&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2013 the IOC voted to allow wrestling back into the Olympics for 2020 and 2024 as a probationary sport.  In order to achieve this FILA, the international governing body of wrestling made several changes to the rules as well as changes to the weight classes.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/olympics/story/_/id/9650530/wrestling-gets-reinstated-2020-olympics&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also discussions about uniform changes as well as changes to the competition mat.

&lt;/ref&gt; Different nations may have different weight classes and different age categories for their levels of freestyle competition.

==Structure of the tournament==
A typical international wrestling tournament takes place by direct elimination with an ideal number of wrestlers (4, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc.) in each weight class and age category competing for placement. The competition in each weight class takes place in one day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The day before the wrestling in a scheduled weight class and age category takes place, all the applicable wrestlers are examined by a physician and weighed-in. Each wrestler after being weighed on the scale then draws a token randomly that gives a certain number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

If an ideal number is not reached to begin elimination rounds, a '''qualification round''' will take place to eliminate the excess number of wrestlers. For example, 22 wrestlers may weigh-in over the ideal number of 16 wrestlers. The six wrestlers who drew the highest numbers after 16 and the six wrestlers who drew the six numbers immediately before 17 would then wrestle in six matches in the qualification round. The winners of those matches would then go on to the elimination round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

In the '''elimination round''' or "blood round", the ideal number of wrestlers then pair off and compete in matches until two victors emerge who will compete in the finals for first and second place. All of the wrestlers who lost to the two finalists then have the chance to wrestle in a '''[[repechage]] round'''. The repechage round begins with the wrestlers who lost to the two finalists at the lowest level of competition in the elimination round. The matches are paired off by the wrestlers who lost to one finalist and the wrestlers who lost to the other. The two wrestlers who win after every level of competition are the victors of the repechage round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

After the finals match, the awards ceremony will take place. The first place and second place wrestlers will receive a gold and silver medal, respectively. (At the FILA World Championships, the first place wrestler will receive the World Championship Belt.) The two repechage round winners will each be awarded third place with a bronze medal. The two wrestlers who lost in the finals for the third place are awarded fifth place. From seventh place down, the wrestlers are ranked according to the classification points earned for their victories or losses. If there is a tie among wrestlers for classification points, the ranking is determined in this order from the highest to the lowest:
* Most victories earned by fall
* Most matches won by technical superiority
* Most periods won by technical superiority
* Most points scored in the tournament
* Fewest points scored in the tournament
Wrestlers who remained tied after that will be awarded placements "ex aequo." Wrestlers classified from the fifth to the 10th place will receive a special diploma. The wrestling tournaments in the [[Olympic Games]] and the Senior and Junior World Championships are designed to take place over three days on three mats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Layout of the mat==
The match takes place on a thick rubber mat that is shock-absorbing to ensure safety. For the Olympic Games, all World Championships, and World Cups, the mat has to be new. The main wrestling area has a nine-meter diameter and is surrounded by a {{convert|1.5|m|ft|sing=on}} border of the same thickness known as the '''protection area'''. Inside the nine meter in diameter circle is a red band of one meter (3&amp;nbsp;ft 3&amp;nbsp;in) in width that is on the outer edge of the circle and is known as the '''red zone'''. The red zone is used to help indicate passivity on the part of a wrestler; thus, it is also known as the '''passivity zone'''. Inside the red zone is the '''central wrestling area''' which is seven meters {{convert|7|m|ftin}} in diameter. In the middle of the central surface of wrestling is the '''central circle''', which is one meter in diameter. The central circle is surrounded by a band 10 centimeters (4&amp;nbsp;in) wide and is divided in half by a red line eight centimeters (3&amp;thinsp;&lt;small&gt;{{frac|1|8}}&lt;/small&gt; in) in width. The diagonally opposite corners of the mat are marked with the wrestlers' colors, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

For competition in the Olympic Games, the World Championships, and the Continental Championships, the mat is installed on a platform no greater than {{convert|1.1|m|ftin}} in height. If the mat lies on a podium and the protection margin (covering and free space around the mat) does not reach two meters (6&amp;nbsp;ft 6&amp;nbsp;in), the sides of the podium are covered with 45° (degree) inclined panels. In all cases, the color of the protection area is different from the color of the mat.&lt;ref name=FILAIWR9&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==
* A '''[[Wrestling singlet|singlet]]''' is a one-piece wrestling garment made of [[spandex]] that should provide a tight and comfortable fit for the wrestler. It is made from [[nylon]] or [[lycra]] and prevents an opponent from using anything on the wrestler as leverage. One wrestler usually competes in a &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; singlet and the other in a &lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt; singlet.&lt;ref name="FILAIWR9" /&gt;
* A special pair of '''[[Wrestling shoes|shoes]]''' is worn by the wrestler to increase his mobility and flexibility. Wrestling shoes are light and flexible in order to provide maximum comfort and movement. Usually made with rubber soles, they help give the wrestler's feet a better grip on the mat.&lt;ref name=FILAIWR10&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
* A '''handkerchief,''' also called a '''bloodrag''', is carried in the singlet. In the event of bleeding, the wrestler will remove the cloth from his singlet and attempt to stop the bleeding or clean up any bodily fluids that may have gotten onto the mat.&lt;ref name="FILAIWR9" /&gt;
* '''[[Wrestling headgear|Headgear]]''', equipment worn around the ears to protect the wrestler, is optional in freestyle. Headgear is omitted at the participant's own risk, as there is the potential to develop [[cauliflower ear]].&lt;ref name="FILAIWR10" /&gt;

==The match==
A match is a competition between two individual wrestlers of the same weight class. In freestyle wrestling, a jury (or team) of three [[Referee|officials (referees)]] is used. The '''referee''' controls the action in the center, blowing the whistle to start and stop the action, and supervises the scoring of holds and infractions. The '''judge''' sits at the side of the mat, keeps score, and occasionally gives his approval when needed by the referee for various decisions. The '''mat chairman''' sits at the scoring table, keeps time, is responsible for declaring technical superiority, and supervises the work of the referee and judge. To call a fall, two of the three officials must agree (usually, the referee and either the judge or the mat chairman).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Session format===
[[Image:FreestyleWrestling4.jpg|thumb|200px|The freestyle wrestler in the blue [[wrestling singlet|singlet]] scores points over the wrestler in the red singlet to win by decision.]]
In Greco-Roman and freestyle, the format is two three-minute sessions. Before each match, each wrestler's name is called, and the wrestler takes his place at the corner of the mat assigned to his color. The referee then calls both of them to his side at the center of the mat, shakes hands with them, inspects their apparel, and checks for any perspiration, oily or greasy substances, and any other infractions. The two wrestlers then greet each other, shake hands, and the referee blows his whistle to start the session.&lt;ref name="fila-official.com"&gt;http://www.fila-official.com/{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wrestler wins the match when he has outscored his opponent at the end of the two three-minute sessions. For example, if one competitor were to score four points in the first session and his opponent two, and then two in the second session, his opponent zero, the competitor would win. Only a fall, injury default, or disqualification terminates the match; all other modes of victory result only in session termination.&lt;ref name="fila-official.com"/&gt;

In freestyle, if no wrestler scores in two minutes, the referee of the match will then identify the more passive wrestler, and that wrestler will be given a thirty-second window of opportunity to score, and if he doesn't, then his opponent will be awarded a point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

When the session (or match) has concluded, the referee stands at the center of the mat facing the officials' table. Both wrestlers then approach each other, shake hands, and stand on either side of the referee to await the decision. The referee then proclaims the winner by raising the winner's hand. At the end of the match, each wrestler then shakes hands with the referee and returns to shake hands with his opponent's coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Match scoring=== 

In freestyle wrestling, as well as in Greco-Roman wrestling, points are awarded mostly on the basis of explosive action and risk. For example, when one wrestler performs a grand amplitude throw that brings his opponent into the danger position, he is awarded the greatest number of points that can be scored in one instance. Also, a wrestler who takes the risk to briefly roll on the mat (with his shoulders in contact with the mat) could give a certain number of points to his opponent. Scoring can be accomplished in the following ways:
* '''Takedown''' ('''2 to 5 points'''): A wrestler is awarded points for a takedown when the wrestler gains control over his opponent on the mat from a neutral position (when the wrestler is on his feet). At least three points of contact have to be controlled on the mat (e.g. two arms and one knee; two knees and one arm or the head; or two arms and the head).&lt;ref name="fila-official.com"/&gt; 
::('''5 points'''):5 points are awarded for a takedown brought about by a throw of grand amplitude (a throw in which a wrestler brings his opponent off of the mat and controls him so that his feet go directly above his head) either from the standing or ''par terre'' position into a direct and immediate danger position.&lt;ref name=FILAIWR37&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
::('''4 points'''):  4 points are awarded for a takedown brought about by a throw of grand amplitude as in the 5-point throw, but does not put the opponent into a direct and immediate danger position or if the opposing wrestler maintains contact with at least one hand on the mat.
::('''3 points'''): Generally, three points are awarded for a takedown brought about by a short amplitude throw that does not bring his opponent in a direct and immediate danger position or for a takedown in which a wrestler's opponent is taken from his feet or his stomach to his back or side (a throw of short amplitude) so that he is in the danger position.&lt;ref name="FILAIWR37" /&gt;
::('''2 points&lt;ref&gt;http://content.themat.com/section.php?section_id=3&amp;page=showarticle&amp;ArticleID=26490&lt;/ref&gt;'''):Two points are awarded for a takedown brought about by a wrestler taking his opponent from his feet to his stomach or side such that his back or shoulders are not exposed to the mat and while in this position holding him down with control.&lt;ref name=FILAIWR36&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Reversal''' ('''1 point'''): A wrestler is awarded one point for a reversal when the wrestler gains control over his opponent from a defensive position (when the wrestler is being controlled by his opponent).&lt;ref name="FILAIWR36" /&gt;
[[Image:FreestyleWrestling5.jpg|thumb|200px|Two [[United States military]] servicemen grapple in a freestyle wrestling championship match.]]
* '''Exposure''' also called the '''Danger Position''' ('''2 or 3 points'''): A wrestler is awarded points for exposure when the wrestler exposes his opponent's back to the mat for several seconds. Points for exposure are also awarded if one's back is to the mat but the wrestler is not pinned. Criteria for exposure or the danger position is met when 1) a wrestler's opponent is in a bridge position to avoid being pinned, 2) a wrestler's opponent is on one or both elbows with his back to the mat and avoids getting pinned, 3) a wrestler holds one of his opponent's shoulders to the mat and the other shoulder at an acute angle (less than 90 degrees), 4) a wrestler's opponent is in an "instantaneous fall" position (where both of his shoulders are on the mat for less than one second), or 5) the wrestler's opponent rolls on his shoulders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Penalty''' ('''1 or 2 points'''): Under the 2004-2005 changes to the international styles, a wrestler whose opponent takes an injury time-out receives one point unless the injured wrestler is bleeding. Other infractions (e.g. fleeing a hold or the mat, striking the opponent, acting with brutality or intent to injure, using illegal holds, etc.) are penalized by an award of either one or two points, a '''Caution''', and a choice of position to the opponent.&lt;ref name="FILAIWR3637" /&gt; A wrestler whose opponent regularly refuses to take an ordered hold is awarded a point.&lt;ref name="themat"&gt;http://www.themat.com/forms/Rulebook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Three cautions automatically result in the match being awarded to the opponent.
* '''Out-of-Bounds''' ('''1 point'''): Whenever a wrestler places his foot in the protection area, the match is stopped, and one point is awarded to his opponent.&lt;ref name="FILAIWR36" /&gt;
* '''Passivity''' ('''1 point'''): A point awarded to the attacking wrestler whose opponent flees the hold or refuses to start.&lt;ref name="themat" /&gt;

Classification points are also awarded in an international wrestling tournament, which give most points to the winner and in some cases, one point to the loser depending on the outcome of the match and how the victory was attained. For example, a victory by fall would give the winner five classification points and the loser no points, while a match won by technical superiority with the loser scoring technical points would award three points to the winner and one point to loser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Victory conditions==
[[Image:FreestyleWrestling.jpg|thumb|200px|Compared to [[Collegiate wrestling|collegiate (scholastic or folkstyle) wrestling]], the main style done in [[United States|U.S.]] [[high school]]s, [[college]]s, and [[university|universities]], freestyle wrestling involves a greater emphasis on explosive action by both wrestlers, as opposed to one wrestler's dominance and control of the other.]]
A match can be won in the following ways:
* '''Win by [[pin (amateur wrestling)|Fall]]''': The object of the entire wrestling match is to attain victory by what is known as the '''[[Pin (amateur wrestling)|fall]]'''. A '''fall''', also known as a '''[[pin (amateur wrestling)|pin]]''', occurs when one wrestler holds both of his opponents' shoulders on the mat simultaneously. In Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling, the two shoulders of the defensive wrestler must be held long enough for the referee to "observe the total control of the fall" (usually ranging from one half-second to about one or two seconds). Then either the judge or the mat chairman concurs with the referee that a fall is made. (If the referee does not indicate a fall, and the fall is valid, the judge and the mat chairman can concur together and announce the fall.) A fall ends the match entirely regardless of when it occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Win by [[Technical Fall|Technical Superiority]]''' (Also called '''Technical Fall'''): If at any point during the match, a wrestler gains a ten-point lead over his opponent, the wrestler would win the match by technical fall.&lt;ref name="fila-official.com"/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Win by Default''': If one wrestler is unable to continue participating for any reason or fails to show up on the mat after his name was called three times before the match begins, his opponent is declared the winner of the match by '''default''', '''forfeit''', or '''withdrawal'''.&lt;ref name=FILAIWR27,30&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Win by Injury''': If one wrestler is injured and unable to continue, the other wrestler is declared the winner. This is also referred to as a '''medical forfeit''' or '''injury default'''. The term also encompasses situations where wrestlers become ill, take too many injury time-outs, or bleed uncontrollably. If a wrestler is injured by his opponent's illegal maneuver and cannot continue, the wrestler at fault is disqualified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Win by Disqualification''': Normally, if a wrestler is assessed three '''Cautions''' for breaking the rules, he is disqualified.

===Team scoring in tournaments===
In an international wrestling tournament, teams enter one wrestler at each weight class and score points based on the individual performances. For example, if a wrestler at the 60&amp;nbsp;kg weight class finishes in first place, then his team will receive 10 points. If he were to finish in tenth place, then the team would only receive one. At the end of the tournament, each team's score is tallied, and the team with the most points wins the team competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2008-10-28 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Team competition===
A '''team competition''' or '''dual meet''' is a meeting between (typically two) teams in which individual wrestlers at a given weight class compete against each other. A team receives one point for each victory in a weight class regardless of the outcome. The team that scores the most points at the end of the matches wins the team competition. If there are two sets of competitions with one team winning the ''home'' competition and one winning the ''away'' competition, a third competition may take place to determine the winner for ranking purposes, or the ranking may take place by assessing in order: 1) the most victories by adding the points of the two matches; 2) the most points by fall, default, forfeit, or disqualification; 3) the most matches won by technical superiority; 4) the most periods won by technical superiority; 5) the most technical points won in all the competition; 6) the fewest technical points won in all the competition. This works similarly when more than two teams are involved in this predicament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Women's freestyle wrestling==
{{weasel|date=December 2013}}
At the collegiate, world, and Olympic levels, women wrestle freestyle.  During competition the wrestlers will either wear a red singlet or blue singlet depending on where they are placed in the bracket.  All female competitors are required to wear a women’s cut singlet with proper fitting to minimize any distracting incidents.

The United States is still behind Canada with regard to the acceptance of Women’s Wrestling. The U.S. struggles with implementing high school teams for girls.  As a result, many high school girls participate on the boys' team where they wrestle American Freestyle.  However, the U.S. has made strides amongst universities boasting 14 schools registered on the Women’s Collegiate Wrestling Association website offering opportunities to continue wrestling while getting an education.  Gator Wrestling Club, Titan Mercury Wrestling Club, New York Athletic Club, Army World Class Athlete Program, Sunkist Kids, and the Pennsylvania Wrestling Club are domestic sponsors that support many of the nations top girls.

In addition to colleges and universities, there are programs like the Beat the Streets-[http://www.nycwomenswrestling.com Girls Wrestling Program].  This organization is highly successful at targeting inner city kids and introducing them to the world of wrestling at no cost.  Other notable organizations include [http://www.chickwrestler.com Chick Wrestler], which was created in January 2012 to market and promote women’s wrestling at the Olympic Level.

Women’s wrestling made its Olympic Debut in Athens 2004.  Typically the females have 7 weight classes (48&amp;nbsp;kg, 51&amp;nbsp;kg, 55&amp;nbsp;kg, 59&amp;nbsp;kg, 63&amp;nbsp;kg, 67&amp;nbsp;kg, 72&amp;nbsp;kg) that compete in a World Championships.  Though, during the Olympic year, the weights are reduced to only 4 (48&amp;nbsp;kg, 55&amp;nbsp;kg, 63&amp;nbsp;kg, and 72&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.olympic.org/wrestling-freestyle&lt;/ref&gt;  Only one representative from each weight class is permitted to enter Olympic Competition.

'''Gilberto Emiro Correa Romero''' (born February 24, 1943)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tecnologiahechapalabra.com/entretenimiento/record_report/radiotv/articulo.asp?i=5445 Gilberto Correa, más de 30 años de carrera elevando su estilo]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Venezuelan people|Venezuelan]] television personality known for hosting ''De Fiesta Con Venevision'' from 1969–1983 and ''[[Súper Sábado Sensacional]]'' from 1988-1996. Correa is also best known for his deep voice on [[Venevision]]'s commercial bumpers and promos during the 1980s and 1990s.

==Career==
===Venevision===
Correa began his career on [[Venevision]] at age 21, on the show ''Ritmo y Juventud''. His popularity soon earned him the position of being an announcer and host of numerous events. In 1969, Correa was hired to host ''De Fiesta Con Venevision'' a variety show which lasted through 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.6topoder.com/2012/01/01/gilberto-correa-confiesa-sus-secretos-luego-de-51-anos-de-carrera-entrevista/ Gilberto Correa confiesa sus secretos luego de 51 años de carrera (+Entrevista)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201040241/http://www.6topoder.com/2012/01/01/gilberto-correa-confiesa-sus-secretos-luego-de-51-anos-de-carrera-entrevista/ |date=2012-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His voice was also heard on several of Venevision's commercial bumpers and promos. Correa has also hosted the [[Miss Venezuela]] pageant at various times since 1971. In 1985, Correa hosted and produced the news magazine show ''Close Up''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://loscorotos.wordpress.com/2007/11/19/close-up-con-gilberto-correa/ Close Up con Gilberto Correa]&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1980s, Correa often filled in for [[Amador Bendayan]] on the variety show ''[[Sábado Sensacional]]''. By 1988, Bendayan's health was deteriorating and was forced to retire from the show. Bendayan died shortly after Correa took over as host. On Saturday of that week, a special edition of ''Sábado Sensacional'' aired in which Correa read Bendayan's last will. In 1990, the show was renamed ''Súper Sábado Sensacional'' and focused more on multitudinary events, generating higher ratings. In 1996, future host [[Daniel Sarcos]] hosted a new game show segment called ''Mega Match Sensacional''. Correa stepped down as the main host of ''Súper Sábado Sensacional'' in favor of Sarcos, who would host the show for the next twelve years. Correa eventually left the network that same year.

Correa reappeared on ''Súper Sábado Sensacional'' numerous times (the first being in 2007, celebrating the late Ricardo Pena's 30 years of producing the show). Correa returned again in 2009 to participate in a tribute to Amador Bendayan presented by Daniel Sarcos. In March 2011, Correa returned once again to ''Súper Sábado Sensacional'' to co-host the episode celebrating Venevision's 50th anniversary alongside current host Leonardo Villalobos. In 2013, Correa, along with several of Venevision's current and former personalities, returned to participate in a tribute dedicated to the late Joaquin Riviera, who served as general production manager of the network from 1986 until his death in April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJ3uRfu7yZQ Homenaje a Joaquín Riviera - Homenaje en vida al mago de la television]&lt;/ref&gt;

===After ''Súper Sábado Sensacional''===
After leaving ''Súper Sábado Sensacional'' in 1996, he worked with [[Televen]] hosting ''Flash'', a news magazine show. In 2002, he hosted a variety show called ''El Momento de La Verdad'' (''"The Moment of Truth"''), which also aired on Televen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0465833/ El Momento de La Verdad hosted by Gilberto Correa]&lt;/ref&gt; Correa continued hosting the Miss Venezuela pageant regularly from 2002 until 2003. In 2006, Correa guest-hosted the pageant alongside then-host Daniel Sarcos. Currently, Gilberto Correa can be seen as a spokesperson in numerous commercials for numerous companies, including [[Telcel]] and Multinacional de Seguros.

==Personal life==
===Marriages===
Correa has been married five times. His first marriage was with Argentine model Claudia Spangher in 1976. From 1982 until 1986, Correa was married to Maria Eugenia Maury with whom he has a daughter, Karina (b. 1983). In 1988, Correa married former Miss Venezuela contestant Raquel Lares with whom he has a son, Carlos (b. 1990). The couple later divorced in 1993.

The '''Golden Demon competition''' is the [[figure painting (hobby)|miniature painting]] and modelling competition run by [[Games Workshop]], and is held during the [[Games Day (Games workshop)|Games Day Event]] in the UK, USA and other countries.

==History==
Games day is on 17e of April
The Golden Demon competition has been held since 1987 in the UK, since 1991 in the USA, since 1997 in France and in other countries more recently.

The competition is named for the first prize [[trophy]] in each category, the Golden Demon. The Golden Demon trophy itself is a figurine of a horned [[demon]] painted gold, posed with its arms crossed over its chest (in a manner somewhat reminiscent of [[Academy Awards#The Oscar|the Oscar]]). Silver and Bronze Demon trophies are given for second and third places, respectively in each category.

The overall winner across all categories at the event receives the "Slayer Sword", an actual full-size [[broadsword]] about 5 feet in length from [[Hilt|pommel]] to tip.

The competition measures the skills of painting and modelling, since conversions and alterations of existing miniatures are encouraged.

==Example categories==

==Competition rules==
{{quote|Overall, the judges will be looking for well-painted models that adhere to the imagery and ethos of the worlds represented in the fictional worlds of Warhammer and Warhammer 40,000.

Finally, the point of the painting tournaments is to showcase the efforts of all those who paint miniatures in our hobby and to have some fun.}}

Key points of rules paraphrased from Golden Demon website:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.games-workshop.com/goldendemon/competitors-guidelines/1/ |title=Games Workshop "Golden Demon Competitor's Guidelines" |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715150644/http://uk.games-workshop.com/goldendemon/competitors-guidelines/1/ |archivedate=2007-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*"You can only enter once in each category"
*"all entries...must be painted Citadel miniatures, Forge World or Imperial Armour models or scratch-built models that you have sculpted yourself. 
*Entries from other miniature companies are not accepted.
*Entry to any of the competitions gives Games Workshop the right to photograph and publish details of models entered as they see fit.

==Territorial differences==

In Australia the Golden Demon competition is slightly different: entrants take their models to a Games Workshop store on a specified day.  The best 3 in each category in the store gain a place in the regional finals and the best 3 in each category there gain a place in the national finals in Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oz.games-workshop.com/community/goldendemon/event.htm |title=Games Workshop Australia "Golden Demon" |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504101033/http://oz.games-workshop.com/community/goldendemon/event.htm |archivedate=2007-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2007, Australian Golden Demon has included an "Intermediate" category. This category is open to painters aged 15–17, and has both the Warhammer Fantasy and 40000 miniatures combined.

In [[theatre]], '''house management''' concerns the selling of [[Ticket (admission)|ticket]]s, the [[wiktionary:usher|usher]]ing of [[patron]]s in [[FOH (theatre)|front of house]] areas, and the maintenance and management of the [[Theater (structure)|theatre building]]. House management staff usually work for the theatre, under the supervision of the ''house manager'', and not for the theatrical [[wiktionary:troupe|troupe]] which is occupying it. Often in regional or smaller theatres the responsibility falls under the aegis of the ''production manager''. In any case, house management works closely with the [[production management]] team for the presentation of the theatrical production.

In domestic services, "house management" refers to the overseeing of employees that make up the staff of the household, including drivers, nannies, and housekeepers.

'''Humor research''' (also '''humor studies''') is a multifaceted field which enters the domains of [[linguistics]], [[history]], and [[literature]]. Research in humor has been done to understand the psychological and physiological effects, both positive and negative, on a person or groups of people. Research in humor has revealed many different [[theories of humor]] and many different kinds of humor including their functions and effects personally, in relationships, and in society.

==Areas==
Humor research deals with a wide variety of issues,&lt;ref name=mn2002&gt;M.P. Mulder, A. Nijholt (2002). [http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/580062.html Humour&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; Research: State of the Art].&lt;/ref&gt; which can be categorized according to several [[theories of humor]]. Because of its interdisciplinary nature, humor research has many areas of study which aim to explain the phenomenon of humor.

===Neuroanatomy of humor===
[[Cognitive neuroscience]] has provided insight into how humor is neurologically realized. Brain imaging techniques such as [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] and [[Positron emission tomography|PET scans]] have been implemented in this subfield of humor research.
 
There are a few main regions of the human brain associated with humor and laughter. The production of laughter involves two primary brain pathways, one for involuntary and one for voluntary laughter (i.e., Duchenne and non-Duchenne laughter). Involuntary laughter is usually emotionally driven and includes key emotional brain areas such as the [[amygdala]], [[thalamus|thalamic areas]], and the [[brainstem]]. Voluntary laughter, however, begins in the premotor opercular area in the temporal lobe and moves to the motor cortex and pyramidal tract before moving to the brainstem. Wild et al. (2003)&lt;ref name="Wild, B. 2003"&gt;Wild, B., Rodden, F.A., Grodd, W., &amp; Ruch, W. (2003). Neural correlates of laughter and humour&lt;!--[sic]--&gt;. ''Brain'', 126, 2121-1238.&lt;/ref&gt; propose that the generation of laughter is mostly influenced by neural pathways that go from the premotor and motor cortex to the ventral side of the brainstem through the cerebral peduncles. It is also suggested that real laughter is not produced from the motor cortex, but that the normal inhibition of cortical frontal areas stops during laughter.

When the electrical activity of the brain is measured during and after hearing a joke, a prominent response can be seen approximately 300ms after the punchline, followed by a depolarization about 100ms later. The fact that humor response occurs in two separate waves of activity supports the idea that humor processing occurs in two stages.

Functional MRI and PET studies further illuminate which parts of the brain are participating in the experience of humor. A study by Ozawa et al. (2000) found that, when participants heard sentences that they rated as humorous, the [[Broca's area]] and the middle [[frontal gyrus]] were activated. Additionally, [[Wernicke's area]] and the [[transverse temporal gyri]] were activated, but these areas also were also found to be active in control (non-humorous) conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Ozawa, F., Matsuo, K., Kato, C., Nakai, T., Isoda, H., Takehara, Y., et al. (2000). The effects of listening comprehension of various genres of literature on response in the linguistic area: An fMRI study. ''NeuroReport'', 11, 1141-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study using fMRI showed that the linguistic basis of jokes participants found to be humorous impacted which parts of the brain were activated. In response to [[pun]]s, the left posterior middle temporal gyrus and the left inferior frontal gyrus were activated. When listening to semantic jokes, the left posterior middle temporal gyrus was again activated, as were the left posterior inferior temporal gyrus, the right posterior middle temporal gyrus, and the cerebellum. Brain activity in the medial ventral prefrontal cortex was associated with ratings of funniness that the participants gave after the brain scan and initial humor response. This response may stem from the mood or emotional change that occurs after hearing humor.&lt;ref&gt;Goel, V., &amp; Dolan, R. (2001). The functional anatomy of humor: Segregating cognitive and affective components. ''Nature Neuroscience'', 4(3), 237-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Induction of laughter through direct brain stimulation has been reported in a number of studies, and includes areas such as ACC, globus pallidus, floor of the third ventricle, and most recently left superior frontal gyrus – though these results are hard to draw inferences from (may be inhibitory, may be artefacts, etc.) Because the nature of laughter is so complex—involving facial muscles, respiratory actions, etc.--a control center has been hypothesized in the upper pons.&lt;ref name="Wild, B. 2003"/&gt;

===Play research===
[[File:Children playing in the sand at Lido Beach- Sarasota, Florida (4565683128).jpg|thumb|Children playing in the sand in Florida, United States]]

Studies within [[play (activity)|play]] research have provided correlates to the study of humor, as play often takes on a humorous demeanor. A child's social play often invokes the use of [[joke]]s, non-serious social [[Theories of humor#Incongruity theory|incongruity]], physical [[slapstick]] humor. Studies on how play "promot[es] [[social cohesion]], [[cooperation]], and even [[altruism]],"&lt;ref name=Gervais2005&gt;Gervais, M. &amp; Wilson, D., 2005. The evolution and functions of laughter and humor: A synthetic approach. ''The Quarterly Review of Biology''. 80(4), 395-430&lt;/ref&gt; have been used to describe humor's function. Laughter is often a byproduct of playful social interactions, and can therefore be viewed as serving a similar function as play. It can be said that the perception and appreciation of humor decreases aggression and stress while promoting cooperation and fairness. Play research can provide a functional look at humor in its relation to social interactions.

===Evolutionary psychology===
Evolutionary theorists have attempted to study and explain the phenomena of laughter and humor in terms of survival benefit. Laughter-like behavior is not unique to humans, but humans do display a much more consistent and complex use of humor and laughter than other animals &lt;ref name=Gervais2005 /&gt; The evolution and functions of laughter and humor have been explored in an attempt to understand how and why humor and laughter have become part of human existence.

[[Duchenne de Boulogne|Duchenne]] [[laughter]] refers to laughter that is stimulus-driven and linked to some positive experience. This is usually the result of a perceived social incongruity. Non-Duchenne laughter refers to laughter that is unconnected to any emotional experience, but rather laughter that is originated voluntarily. Duchenne laughter evolved before non-Duchenne laughter with the function of making play and playful emotions contagious. In these situations, laughter serves as an in-group designator. Early evolutionary laughter is also theorized to serve the function of dissolving social tension. During moments of displays of social superiority, laughter could be used to dissolve tensions that otherwise could lead to fighting or exclusion from a group, by designating those situations as play rather than as a real challenge. Duchenne laughter, which should be thought of as emotionally-valenced rather than simply spontaneous, can increase positive [[affect (psychology)|affect]] and mood of an individual as well as a group.&lt;ref&gt;Spoor, J. R. &amp; Kelly, J. R. (2004). The evolutionary significance of affect in groups: Communication and group bonding. ''Group Processes and Intergroup Relations'', 7, 398-412&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neuhoff, C. &amp; Shaeffer, C. (2002). Effects of laughing, smiling, and howling on mood. ''Psychological Reports'', 91, 1079-1080&lt;/ref&gt; So, early laughter most likely provided survival benefits through effects of emotional contagion that served to strengthen within-group ties. Non-duchenne laughter developed later than Duchenne laughter. Non-duchenne laughter was co-opted for a variety of other social situations as laughter and humor already existed. Voluntarily accessing the laughter system that was already in place would serve to strengthen in-group fitness just as genuine, emotional laughter did before it, but now it could be done at will. Thus, non-Duchenne laughter developed to express things like aggression, nervousness, hierarchy positions, and to do things such as manipulate, appease, and make fun of others. Even when non-Duchenne laughter is unconscious, that does not mean it is necessarily emotional or using the same brain pathways as genuine Duchenne laughter. As social situations became more complex in later hominid stages of evolution, so did the functions and usefulness of laughter. As linguistics developed, proto-laughter and proto-humor were both co-opted for assistance in the production of and response to effective communication.&lt;ref&gt;Panksepp, J. &amp; Panksepp, J.B. (2000). The seven sins of evolutionary psychology. ''Evolution and Cognition'', 6, 108-131.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Humor as a mental fitness indicator====
It has been hypothesized that intentional humor evolved as indicator of [[intelligence]]. Humor is often rated as important in mate selection, and it may be that partners are selecting for genetic fitness. General intelligence predicted higher ratings on humor tasks, even after controlling for [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] personality factors.&lt;ref&gt;Howrigan, D. &amp; MacDonald, K. (2008). Humor as a mental fitness indicator. ''Evolutionary Psychology'', 6(4), 652-666.&lt;/ref&gt;

Greengross &amp; Miller&lt;ref name="greengross"&gt;Greengross, G. &amp; Miller, G. (2011). Humor ability reveals intelligence, predicts mating success, and is higher in males. ''Intelligence'', 39, 188-192.&lt;/ref&gt; propose that humor plays into sexual selection. Rather than being sexually attractive for its own sake, humor is attractive because it is an indicator of other things which humor is correlated with, such as intelligence, [creativity], and other desirable traits. Intelligence has been shown to be a mental fitness indicator and is highly sexually desirable for both traits&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D.M. (1989). Sex differences in human mate preferences: Evolutionary hypotheses tested in 37 cultures. ''The Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 12, 1-49.&lt;/ref&gt; Intelligence and humor ability are positively correlated and the ability to produce humor on the spot predicts mating success. In line with theories regarding sex differences of mating strategies, humor ability was rated higher by a blind panel of judges when produced from males than females.

A large proportion of humor is produced during informal conversation and involves the derision of a specific person (either oneself or another). The adaptiveness of deprecating humor in social interactions is a point of interest among researchers. Drawing attention to one's own faults seems counter-intuitive when considering humor's function of strengthening within-group fitness and sexual desirability. Other-deprecating humor has functions which are implicated in establishing same-sex rivalries. This sort of humor usually targets fitness indicators of rivals, which can be risky if an opponent perceives the humor as a threat worthy of retaliation. Self-deprecating humor is proposed to fit within [[cost signaling theory]]. Greengross and Miller&lt;ref name="greengross" /&gt; found that self-deprecating humor had predictive value for long-term sexual attractiveness. However, this occurred as an interaction effect, and only was predictive for high-status individuals. Self-deprecating humor may only work for high-status individuals because it ironically points out the desirable traits by way of discrepancy. In low-status individuals, this approach is unproductive, as the humor is pointing to actual weak fitness traits rather than a discrepancy as with high-status individuals.

==Benefits of humor==

===Psychological benefits===

==== Humor style and psychological outcomes ====
There are two [[adaptive]] styles of humor and two [[maladaptive]] styles of humor.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, R. A., Puhlik-Doris, P., Larsen, G., Gray, J., &amp; Weir, K. (2003). Individual differences in the uses of humor and their relation to psychological well-being: Development of the Humor Styles Questionnaire. Journal of Research in Personality, 37, 48–75&lt;/ref&gt; Affiliative and self-enhancing humor are the two adaptive styles. The defining feature of affiliative humor is humor that is used to strengthen interpersonal relationships or ease tensions within those relationships. Self-enhancing humor involves the use of a humorous outlook on situations in life as a coping tool. In this instance, humor is used to mitigate stress without targeting others or the self in a hurtful way. The two maladaptive humor styles are aggressive humor, which uses sarcasm and other humor styles to target or put down others and self-defeating humor, which uses self-deprecating tactics for the enjoyment of others.  Martin et al. (2003) found that higher levels of adaptive humor are related to psychological well-being in terms of lower levels of depression and higher self-esteem. Self-defeating humor contrasts with the adaptive types, and is associated with poorer psychological health. Kuiper and McHale (2009) found support for humor styles being mediators between self-evaluation and psychological well-being. Simply put, rather than humor styles directly affecting psychological well-being, they are involved with how people self-evaluate, which results in different amounts of psychological well-being.

In a study examining humor as an intervention, random assignment to a humor group, a social group, and a non-intervention control group was used. A standardized manual and booklet were used in the intervention group, and results showed that the humor group demonstrated significant increases in emotional well-being. Importantly, self-efficacy, positive affect, optimism, and perceptions of control were found to go up while other negative measures decreased. Crawford &amp; Caltabiano (2011)&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, S.A. &amp; Caltabiano, N.J. (2011). Promoting emotional well-being through the use of humor. ''The Journal of Positive Psychology'', 6(3), 237-252.&lt;/ref&gt; found support for humor as an intervention which may increase positive aspects of emotional well-being. Humor skills of the intervention group were targeted through the use of a manual. Humor increased several measures of well-being including self-efficacy, positive affect, optimism, and perception of control, even more than a “social group” control or a non-intervention control group. The exposure to humor and humor skills training was also found to decrease certain negative aspects of emotional well-being, including perceived stress, certain depressive symptoms, and anxiety.

==== Benefit vs. detriment of humor ====
Adaptive components of humor show facilitative effects on psychological well-being. Maladaptive styles that were self-focused showed detrimental effects, while maladaptive styles that did not focus on self were unrelated to personal well beings. Self-deprecating humor is the specific component of maladaptive humor that results in decreased psychological well-being, while both of the adaptive styles of humor (affiliative and self-enhancing) are associated with positive psychological outcomes, such as greater self-esteem, lower depression and anxiety levels, and greater endorsement of self-efficacy. It is important to note that the relevant psychological states may have preceded the humor style rather than vice versa.

===Physical health benefits===
Humor research includes investigations into the positive benefits of humor, sense of humor, and laughter on physical health. In recent decades, humor research has seen a surge in publications in part because of [[Norman Cousins]] and his claims that he became cured from ankylosing spondilitis due to a daily regimen which included humor and laughter.

====Humor and immune response====
Positive affect is theorized to influence physical health by means of the [[immune system]]. The immune system could be influenced positively by humor in a number of ways. The possibilities include simple immunoenhancement, stress moderation, or both.&lt;ref&gt;Berk L, Tan S, Eby B, Carmons M, Vorce D. Modulation of human natural killer cells by catecholamines. Clin Res. 1984;32(1):51A&lt;/ref&gt; The pleasant experience of humor is thought to positively influence affect so that stress is moderated. The antibody secretory immunoglobin A (S-IgA) is associated with both positive and negative affect states, with negative states decreasing effectiveness and positive states increasing effects of the antibody.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, A. A., Cox, D. S., Valdimarsdottir, H., Jandorf, L., &amp; Neale, J. M. (1987). Evidence that secretory IgA antibody is associated with daily mood. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 52, 988-993.&lt;/ref&gt; Levels of immune response can be predicted by the number of desirable events (and presumably mood) which occur in preceding days to the immune assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, A. A., Neale, J. M., Cox, D. S., Napoli, A., Valdimarsdottir, H., &amp; Kennedy-Moore, E. (1994). Daily events are associated with secretory immune response to an oral antigen in men. ''Health Psychology'', 13, 440 446.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is also evidence that significant mood changes in either direction can induce an increase in immune response.&lt;ref&gt;Knapp, P. H., Levy, E. M., Giorgi, R. G., Black, P. H., Fox, B. H., &amp; Heeren, T. C. (1992). Short-term immunological effects of induced emotions. ''Psychosomatic Medicine'', 54, 133-148.&lt;/ref&gt; Laughter as an overt behavior is also associated with immune response, specifically [[NK cell]] activity, which are part of the body’s immune response. [[Glucocorticoids]] are lower in subjects who laughed while watching a humorous video, and glucocorticoids decrease NK cell activity, so humor theory posits this pathway as a possible mechanism for humor as a benefit to immune responses.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, M.P., Zeller, J. M., Rosernberg, L., McCann, J., (2003). The effect of mirthful laughter on stress and natural killer cell activity. ''Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine'', 9(2), 38-45.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is unclear whether these effects on this specific immune response measurement have long-term effects with clinical significance. Using humor as a coping style is a way which these long-term effects on the immune system may be enacted. In one study, levels of S-IgA and the use of humor as a coping style were positively correlated, although the saliva sampling procedure of this study was subsequently called into question.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, K. M., Minchoff, B., &amp; Baker, K. H. (1985-1986). Positive emotional states and enhancement of the immune system. ''International Journal of Psychiatry in Medicine'', 15, 13-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salovey, P., Rothman, A.J., Detweiler, J.B., &amp; Steward, W.T. (2000). Emotional States and Physical Health. ''American Psychologist'', 55(1), 110-121.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Humor and stress====
Humor is thought to play a role in the levels of [[stress (psychological)|stress]] that people experience, both in the short-term and long-term. Watching a humorous video for 20 minutes can significantly lower stress levels, on a level comparable to 20 minutes of exercise. Since watching a video is more widely feasible than exercising for 20 minutes for large portions of the population, humor researchers hope that the acute anxiety-alleviating effects of humor can be used in a therapeutic setting.&lt;ref name="Szabo"&gt;Szabo, A. (2003) The acute effects of humor and exercise on mood and anxiety. ''Journal of Leisure Research''. (35)2, 152-162.&lt;/ref&gt; Although acute benefits of humor may be obtained, this does not guarantee any long term benefits.&lt;ref name="Szabo"/&gt;

====Humor and pain====
Humor's effect on pain tolerance is another point of interest within humor research. Hypotheses for this research include the idea that the positive feelings of humor will increase the threshold of pain that a person can endure. These ideas are implicit in some folk wisdom&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthcentral.com/chronic-pain/coping-277931-5.html&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in anecdotes such as Norman Cousins' recovery story. Though not all studies have showed support for the pain-reducing effect of humor,&lt;ref&gt;Nevo, O., Keinan, G., &amp; Teshimovsky-Arditi, M. (1993). Humor and pain tolerance. Humor: International Journal of Humor Research, 6, 71-88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hudak, D. A., Dale, A., Hudak, M. A., &amp; DeGood, D. E. (1991). Effects of humorous stimuli and sense of humor on discomfort. ''Psychological Reports'', 69, 779-786.&lt;/ref&gt; humor and comedy stimuli do have effects on pain tolerance and perception, particularly when pain is assessed after the humor stimuli is completed.&lt;ref&gt;Martin (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cogan, R., Cogan, D., Waltz, W., &amp; McCue, M. (1987). Effects of laughter and relaxation on discomfort thresholds. Journal of Behavioral Medicine, W, 139-144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.laughterremedy.com/2010/12/humor-and-laughter-reduce-pain/&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the measures of most studies examining pain, it is difficult to tell if simply consuming humorous material is sufficient for pain reduction, or if actual laughter is a necessary component.&lt;ref name="Martin, R. A. 2001"&gt;Martin, R. A. (2001). "Humor, laughter, and physical health: Methodological issues and research findings." ''Psychological bulletin'', (127)4, 504-519.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, some studies that used negative affect control groups found that pain thresholds also increased for people experiencing unsettling stimuli, such as a clip from a horror movie.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, J., &amp; Zillmann, D. (1994). Effect of humor and tragedy on discomfort tolerance. Perceptual and Motor Skills, 78, 632-634.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weisenberg, M., Tepper, L, &amp; Schwarzwald, J. (1995). Humor as a cognitive technique for increasing pain tolerance. Pain, 63, 207-212.&lt;/ref&gt; So, humor does have an effect on pain, but it is unclear what exact behavioral requirements are necessary as well as if humor has an effect greater than other emotionally salient experiences.

====Issues in humor research and physical health====
Even though the positive benefits of humor have been lauded by popular media and have found support among scientific research, the field of humor research also has received criticism. The scientific support for the physical benefits of humor are somewhat sparse, and the findings from the existing research have been called into question in some cases.&lt;ref name="Martin, R. A. 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, R.A. (2004). Sense of humor and physical health: Theoretical issues, recent findings, and future directions. ''Humor'', 17, 1-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Humor is assessed differently based on the theories which underpin the research, such as whether humor is a stable personality trait or not. Because of the non-standard measurements of humor in research, it is difficult to tell whether researchers are measuring the same thing across studies. Sense of humor, internal humor response, and laughter can all be targeted to measure humor, but are not necessarily interchangeable. Martin (2001) critiques several studies for not measuring laughter along with their self-report humor measures.

Aside from theoretical issues, the methods of some key humor research was also called into question by Martin.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the immune response sampling techniques of some humor research may have not been reliable because of how baseline immune levels were set. According to Martin (2001), within the nine studies assessing S-IgA levels in response to humor, three did not have control groups, five had control groups which involved a documentary viewing where interest was not assessed, and only one study had a negative affect control. Proper use of control groups is among the major issues within humor research. Some experimental findings are encouraging, but no firm conclusions involving humor and physical health where controls were not used correctly can be drawn. Thus, there is only partial support of immune effects of humor.

===Humor in marriage===
[[File:YoungCoupleEmbracing-20070508.jpg|thumb|A couple laughing together]]&lt;!-- alternately [[File:Laughing couple.jpg]] --&gt;

In 2002, a study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Koning|first=E.E.|author2=Weiss, R. L.|title=The Relational Humor Inventory: Functions of humor in close relationships.|journal=American Journal of Family Therapy |year=2002|volume=30|issue=1|pages=1–18|doi=10.1080/019261802753455615}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was conducted on the functions of humor in close relationships. The study examined three types of humor:

*'''positive humor''', describing positive aspects of humor, such as humor appreciation, attractiveness, and closeness
*'''negative humor''', describing humor used to express aggression, or humor used in a manipulative manner
*'''instrumental humor''', measuring the extent to which the person uses humor to avoid tension or tries to smooth over negative feelings

Positive humor is expected to be related to intimacy and marital satisfaction. This relation was true for the wives, but not for the husbands. This suggests that whether or not husbands use positive humor, it has nothing to do with how closely they feel to their partner or their marital satisfaction. Research suggests that instrumental humor is negatively related to marital satisfaction and is an indicator of potential future marital deterioration. Results showed that husbands acknowledged using instrumental humor in their relationship in relation to demand-withdrawal, in which the wife demands and the husband withdraws. Wives, on the other hand, did not acknowledge the use of instrumental humor in this communication pattern. This seems to indicate that men more often withdraw than women, in this case, with the use of humor. Negative humor was not related to any of the other humor measure in the study. This makes sense considering that put-downs or hurtful humor does not tend to lead to laughter or humor appreciation. Negative humor items in the questionnaire given to the participants described expressing negative emotion. Negative humor somewhat correlated with demand-withdrawal for husbands and wives. This humor can be a form of passive aggressiveness where the one using the humor is not taking responsibility for the put-down or hurtful joke, and in doing so, avoiding, or withdrawing from, conflict.

==Measuring responses to humor==
When someone finds something funny, there are different ways of expressing it. Common responses of humor include laughing and smiling. In 2008, a study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=G.|author2=Sadler, S. J. |author3=Barrett, C. E. |author4=Beaven, A. |title=Measuring responses to humor: How the testing context affects individuals' reaction to comedy.|journal=Humor: International Journal of Humor Research|year=2008|volume=21|issue=2|pages=143–155|doi=10.1515/HUMOR.2008.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was conducted using 155 undergraduate students at North London University in order to measure responses to humor using a British comedy. The participants were divided into one of three categories: watched a video of the comedy, listened to an audiotape of the comedy, or read a script of the comedy. Approximately half of the participants were observed by an overt video camera and half were observed by a covert video camera. Results showed that participants laughed and smiled much more frequently when watching a video of the comedy and listening to the audiotape of the comedy than when reading a script. The difference in the frequency of smiling and laughing between the video and the audiotape was not significant. Participants laughed and smiled more frequently when observed by a covert video camera than an overt video camera. Aspects of the video and audiotape such as visualization of the acting, auditory representation, and also the presence of audience laughter significantly increase the frequency of laughter and smiling.

'''Hydroaviasalon''' or in full '''International Exhibition and Scientific Conference on Hydroaviation''' ({{lang-ru|Гидроавиасалон}}, [[transliteration|translit.]] ''Gidroaviasalon'') is an international [[airshow]] on [[hydroaviation]] held in [[Russia]]. It's held every even year since 1996 on a seashore at [[Gelendzhik]]. The event alternates with [[MAKS Airshow]] on [[general aviation]], which is held in odd years.

The airshow draws special attention to [[amphibious aircraft]] and [[seaplane]]s, ship-based aircraft, [[fire-fighting]] aviation, missiles and sea-based space systems, [[search-and-rescue]] aviation, sea ecological monitoring aviation, navigation equipment, small ships, launches and [[yacht]]s, [[Ground effect in aircraft|Wing-In-Ground effect (WIG) crafts]]. 

Aircraft such as [[Beriev Be-200]], [[Beriev A-40|A-40]], [[Beriev Be-12|Be-12P-200]] and [[Beriev Be-103|Be-103]] are frequently shown at Hydroaviasalon.

'''''Hyper''''' is a multi-platform Australian video game magazine. Australia's longest running gaming magazine, it has been in publication since 1993. It is currently edited by Daniel Wilks.

''Hyper'''s sister magazine is the [[PC game]]-oriented ''[[PC PowerPlay]]'', also published by Next Media.

==History==
''Hyper'' was launched in 1993 by Next Media with Stuart Clarke in the editor's seat. Clarke had previously edited Megazone; a then multi-platform magazine published by Sega Ozisoft, before being taken over by Mason Stewart publishing in September 1993 and being made Sega only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retrogamingaus.com/wiki/index.php?title=Megazone|title=Megazone – Australian Gaming Database|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke left Megazone at the time of the Mason Stewart takeover, when he was asked by Next Media publisher, Phil Keir, to start a new multi-platform gaming magazine. Clarke recounted the events in Hyper's 100th issue:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"Just as I was starting to relax, Phil Keir, owner of Next Media and publisher of Rolling Stone, rang me at home one night to ask a few questions. Before I knew it he had asked me to set up a brand new games magazine – one that I created and controlled completely! So after a few nano-seconds of thought I said, 'Um, okay then'. One of the first decisions was to make it a true multi-format title, covering the best games on all platforms." '''- Stuart Clarke, February 2002 issue 100 of Hyper'''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 28 April 2010, Hyper Magazine released its 200th issue. Daniel Wilks was the then editor of Hyper since 2007 and the 200th issue was his last. He then passed the baton onto deputy editor Darren Wells, after the success of the 200th issue release.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"I started on the magazine about six years ago, and during that time we had competition come and go, as well as all the horror stories and nay-saying that print was dead,"'' says Wilks. ''"I'll admit there were a few times that I thought the end days may have been coming – especially during the peak of the GFC when every publishing company seemed to be shedding staff and magazines like it was going out of style, but I've always believed that the magazine could weather anything thrown at it. All of us who have worked on Hyper feel the same way. 200 is a pretty huge milestone for a magazine."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.theage.com.au/digital-life/screenplay/2010/04/28/stillhyperaft.html|last=Hill|first=Jason|title=Screen Play: Digital Life|work=Still Hyper after 200 issues|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The launch issue of the magazine was created in two months with Clarke as editor, Andrew Humphreys as deputy editor, and Aaron Rogers as art director.

Despite numerous competitors entering the market at various stages, such as ACP's [[Gamestar (Australia)|Gamestar]], [[Australian GamePro]], and the relaunched Megazone, all these titles folded within 12 months of launch while Hyper remained a strong title.

Since its inception, Hyper has developed and maintained a reputation for being independent and honest with its readers. It is known for its irreverent sense of humour and both entertaining and informative features, reviews, and previews.

Next Media announced in late 2014 that Hyper would become a quarterly publication from 2015 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcvpacific.com/news/read/hyper-magazine-to-go-quarterly/0142564|title=Hyper Magazine to go quarterly|publisher=MVC Pacific|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

In addition to coverage of all current major video game systems and game releases, ''Hyper'' also covers [[anime]], DVD movies, [[arcade games|arcade]] and classic games, and features in-depth interviews with industry professionals and articles on game-related content such as computer hardware and [[video game music]]. The magazine also features 100% Australian content (Mag Nation 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magnation.com/Hyper-2712.php?browseState=1e091|title=Hyper Magazine Subscription|publisher=Mag Nation|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine contains regular sections such as: news, features, previews, reviews, opinion pieces, and a letters page.

The website has hosted an [[internet forum]] (Previous to that was an IRC channel hosted by Webcentral) since 1996 that serves as a link between editors and readers of the magazine.  The site also encourages feedback about game reviews through a comments section while is also linked to a Twitter feed and Facebook page.  Latest information on industry events, games development programmes and competitions is also linked to the site (Hyper 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 April|url=http://www.hyper.com.au/2012/04/|work=Hyper – Australia's Ultimate Video Magazine – Blog|publisher=NextMedia|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3687">A '''''Jeep Show''''' was a [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]] [[European theatre of World War II|European Theatre of Operations]] initiative to bring entertainment to rapidly advancing American troops.

==Bringing entertainment to a rapidly moving front==
During the Second World War the [[United Service Organizations]] and Army's [[Special Services (entertainment)|Special Services]] brought entertainment to American servicemen and women in both the United States and overseas from isolated outposts to military bases near the front lines.  However, in late 1944 the American military was advancing through Western Europe so fast that entertainment units could not keep up with them &lt;ref&gt;p. 250  Hoopes, Roy ''When the Stars Went to War: Hollywood and World War II'' Random House, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;.

Major [[Joshua Logan]] then an officer in Special Services noted that the advancing [[G.I. (military)|G.I.]]s were "never in one place long enough to see a show".  He was credited with coming up with the idea of small quick moving entertainment units to entertain at rapid notice &lt;ref&gt; p. 244  Lertzman, Richard A. &amp;  Birnes, William J. ''The Life and Times of Mickey Rooney'' Simon and Schuster, 20 Oct 2015&lt;/ref&gt; called "jeep shows". 

A jeep show consisted of three unarmed soldier entertainers, often including a serving soldier who had been a well known celebrity from [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], the [[Golden Age of Radio]] or club entertainment such as [[Mickey Rooney]], [[Bobby Breen]] and [[Red Buttons]]. The small troupe usually comprised a comedian, dancer/singer and musician.  They traveled in a [[jeep]] with their musical instruments and other equipment carried in a quarter ton trailer that would be converted into a stage. They broadcast their show through a [[public address system]] using the jeep's battery.  Each show lasted an average of 45 minutes and troupes could  be combined into nine or 18 man shows for larger shows. &lt;ref&gt;Leigh, Lt. Col. Randolph ''48 Million Tons To Eisenhower: The Role Of The SOS In The Defeat Of Germany'' Pickle Partners Publishing, 6 Nov. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The jeep show troops carried easily transportable musical instruments such as guitars, saxophones, banjos, accordions and drums.  The troupe presented songs, skit, jokes, dancing, and [[pantomime]] &lt;ref&gt; p. 31  Herrera, Brian Eugenio ''Latin Numbers: Playing Latino in Twentieth-Century U.S. Popular Performance'' University of Michigan Press, 2 Jun 2015&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rooney recalled his first show being between two [[Sherman tank]]s three miles from the front in Belgium for 60 soldiers. Rooney's troupe sometimes put on seven shows a day and covered 150,000 miles in a year&lt;ref&gt;p. 37 Marill, Alvin H.''Mickey Rooney: His Films, Television Appearances, Radio Work, Stage Shows, and Recordings'' McFarland, 8 Dec 2004&lt;/ref&gt;,

One unit of 54 men served the Western European front, another unit of 15 men served in the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations]]&lt;ref&gt;p.128 ''Annual Report United States Army Service Forces'' U.S. Government Printing Office, 1945&lt;/ref&gt;.

Before [[Victory in Europe Day]] the jeep shows played before 23,749 troops in eighty-one performances&lt;ref&gt; p. 23 United States Army. Army, 1st ''Report of Operations: Oct. 20, 1943/Aug. 1, 1944-Feb. 23/May 8, 1945, Volume 12, Issues 1-8'' United States Army&lt;/ref&gt;.

By tradition, in some countries, [[April 1]] or [[April Fools' Day]] is marked by [[practical joke|pranks and practical jokes]]. Notable practical jokes have appeared on radio and TV stations, newspapers, web sites, and have been performed by large corporations.

==Television stations==
&lt;!--PLEASE do NOT add pranks without references: the article needs to be well referenced--&gt;
* [[Spaghetti tree]]s: The [[BBC]] television programme ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' ran a hoax in 1957, purporting to show the [[Swiss]] harvesting [[spaghetti]] from trees. They claimed that the despised pest, the spaghetti weevil, had been eradicated. A large number of people contacted the BBC wanting to know how to cultivate their own spaghetti trees. It was, in fact, filmed in [[St Albans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/southern_counties/3591687.stm Still a good joke – 47 years on] ([[BBC News]], April 1, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The editor of ''Panorama'' at the time, Michael Peacock, approved the idea, which was pitched by freelance camera operator Charles de Jaeger. Peacock told the BBC in 2014 that he gave de Jaeger a budget of £100. Peacock said the respected ''Panorama'' anchorman Richard Dimbleby knew they were using his authoritativeness to make the joke work. He said Dimbleby loved the idea and went at it with relish.&lt;ref&gt;BBC TV News interview with Michael Peacock 1/4/14...&lt;/ref&gt;  Decades later [[CNN]] called this broadcast "the biggest hoax that any reputable news establishment ever pulled".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Saeed Ahmed CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/04/01/april.fools.pranks/index.html |title=A nod and a link: April Fools' Day pranks abound in the news |publisher=CNN |accessdate=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1962, [[Sveriges Television|Swedish national television]] broadcast a 5-minute special&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/archive/permalink/instant_color_tv |title=Instant Color TV, 1962 |publisher=museumofhoaxes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; on how one could get color TV by placing a nylon stocking in front of the TV. A rather in-depth description on the physics behind the phenomenon was included. Thousands of people tried it.
* [[Smell-o-vision]]: In 1965, the [[BBC]] purported to conduct a trial of a new technology allowing the transmission of [[odor|odour]] over the airwaves to all viewers. Many viewers reportedly contacted the BBC to [[Placebo|report the trial's success]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/af_1965.html|title=April Fools' Day, 1965|publisher=Museum of Hoaxes|accessdate=March 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the BBC website repeated an online version of the hoax,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/home/images/main_promo/picture_promo/april_fool_first.jpg |title=BBC Smell-o-vision |author=BBC |authorlink=BBC |date=April 1, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106071510/http://www.bbc.co.uk/home/images/main_promo/picture_promo/april_fool_first.jpg |archivedate=January 6, 2010 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=April 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did [[Google]] in 2013, in tribute.
* In 1969, the public broadcaster NTS in the Netherlands announced that inspectors with remote scanners would drive the streets to detect people who had not paid their radio/TV tax ("kijk en luistergeld" or "omroepbijdrage"). The only way to prevent detection was to wrap the TV/radio in [[aluminium foil]]. The next day all supermarkets were sold out of their aluminium foil, and a surge of TV/radio taxes were being paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allesopeenrij.nl/article.php?aid=388|title=Geslaagde 1 aprilgrappen in Nederland|date=December 24, 2011|publisher=|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Great Blue Hill eruption prank]]: On April 1, 1980, Boston television station [[WNAC-TV]] aired a fake news bulletin at the end of the 6 o'clock news which reported that [[Great Blue Hill]] in [[Milton, Massachusetts]] was erupting. The prank resulted in panic in Milton, where some residents began to flee their homes. The executive producer of the 6 o'clock news, Homer Cilley, was fired by the station for "his failure to exercise good news judgment" and for violating the [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s rules about showing [[stock footage]] without identifying it as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Loohauls|first=Jackie|title=These practical jokers didn't fool around|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19840330&amp;id=-2caAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EioEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1843,6882515|accessdate=May 12, 2014|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|date=March 30, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Volcano joke ends in firing|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1696&amp;dat=19800401&amp;id=KP4eAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BJgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5719,508484|accessdate=2 April 2014|newspaper=[[Bowling Green Daily News]]|date=3 April 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Piot|first=Debra K.|title=TV station fires producer for airing April-fool prank|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1980/0404/040423.html|accessdate=2 April 2014|newspaper=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|date=4 April 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1989, on the [[BBC]] television sports show ''[[Grandstand (TV series)|Grandstand]]'', a fight broke out between members of staff directly behind [[Des Lynam]] who was commenting on the professionalism of his team. At the end of the show it was revealed to be an April Fools joke.

* [[Jovian–Plutonian gravitational effect]]: In 1976, British astronomer [[Sir Patrick Moore]] told listeners of [[BBC Radio 2]] that unique alignment of two planets would result in an upward gravitational pull making people lighter at precisely 9:47&amp;nbsp;am that day. He invited his audience to jump in the air and experience "a strange floating sensation".

* Death of a mayor: In 1998, local [[WAAF (FM)|WAAF]] [[shock jock]]s [[Opie and Anthony]] were discussing April Fool's Day hoaxes, and sardonically stated that [[Boston]] mayor [[Thomas Menino]] had been killed in a car accident. Menino happened to be on a flight at the time, lending credence to the prank as he could not be reached. The pair repeated that the mayor was dead several times throughout the broadcast, however listeners who tuned in late to the broadcast did not hear that they were repeating a bit, and when they pretended to tell the "news" to an unsuspecting listener (the listener thought she was calling a different show), the rumor spread quickly across the city, eventually causing news stations to issue alerts denying the hoax. The pair were fired shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-Q3rGE0JYg |title=Opie and Anthony: WAAF April Fools Day Prank Part 1 |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2011-10-14 |accessdate=2013-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In 1998, UK presenter [[Nic Tuff]] of [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] radio station pretended to be the British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] when he called the then South African President [[Nelson Mandela]] for a chat.

* iBod: Every year, [[National Public Radio]] in the United States does an extensive news story on April 1. These usually start off more or less reasonably, and get more and more unusual.

* Canadian three-dollar coin: In 2008, the [[CBC Radio]] program ''[[As It Happens]]'' interviewed a [[Royal Canadian Mint]] spokesman who broke "news" of plans to replace the Canadian five-dollar bill with a three-dollar coin.

* U2 live on rooftop in [[Cork (city)|Cork]]: In 2009, hundreds of [[U2]] fans were duped in an elaborate prank when they rushed to a shopping centre in Cork believing that the band were playing a surprise rooftop concert.

There was no shuttle flying that day. &lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1993-04-02/news/mn-18176_1_april-fools-joke Michael Granberry, "April Fools Hoax No Joke in San Diego", April 2, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[Scientific American]]'' columnist [[Martin Gardner]] wrote in an April 1975, article that [[MIT]] had invented a new chess computer program that predicted "[[Ware Opening|pawn to queens rook four]]" is always the best opening move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Braunlich | first =Tom | title =Martin Gardner, Mathematician and Lifelong Chess Fan, Dies at 95 | publisher =The United States Chess Federation | date =May 28, 2010 | url =http://www.uschess.org/content/view/10436/588/ | accessdate = January 23, 2015 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150123174519/http://www.uschess.org/content/view/10436/588/ | archivedate = January 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A 1985 issue of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', dated April 1, featured a story by [[George Plimpton]] on a baseball player, [[Sidd Finch|Hayden Siddhartha Finch]], a [[New York Mets]] [[pitcher|pitching]] prospect who could throw the ball {{convert|168|mph|km/h}} and who had a number of eccentric quirks, such as playing with one barefoot and one hiking boot. Plimpton later expanded the piece into a full-length novel on Finch's life. ''Sports Illustrated'' cites the story as one of the more memorable in the magazine's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1119283/1/index.htm | title = The Curious Case Of Sidd Finch | last = Plimpton | first = George | authorlink = George Plimpton | date = April 1, 1985 |work=Sports Illustrated | volume = 62 | issue = 13 | page = 58 | accessdate =April 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Associated Press]] were fooled in 1983 when Joseph Boskin, a professor of history at Boston University, provided an alternative explanation for the origins of April Fools' Day. He claimed to have traced the practice to Constantine's period, when a group of court jesters jocularly told the emperor that jesters could do a better job of running the empire, and the amused emperor nominated a jester, Kugel, to be the king for a day. Boskin related how the jester passed an edict calling for absurdity on that day and the custom became an annual event. Boskin explained the jester's role as being able to put serious matters into perspective with humor. An Associated Press article brought this alternative explanation to public's attention in newspapers, not knowing that Boskin had invented the entire story as an April Fool's joke itself, and were not made aware of this until some weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Origin and History of April Fools' day|url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/aprilfools1.html|accessdate=April 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of major '''sports controversies in Australia''' or concerning Australian sportspeople. These controversies cover areas such as rules, match fixing, cheating, sportsmanship, doping and sport administration. They have generated large scale media coverage over a period of time and may have resulted in a large scale inquiry. These controversies affect the integrity of sport.

[[Finland]] has submitted twenty-seven films for consideration in the Best Foreign Language Film category to the [[Oscars]]. The [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] is handed out annually by the [[United States]] [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] to a [[feature length|feature-length]] motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-[[English language|English]] dialogue.&lt;ref name="Rules"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rule Thirteen: Special Rules for the Foreign Language Film Award |work=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/86/rule13.html |accessdate=2013-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822101822/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/86/rule13.html |archivedate=22 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Finnish Academy Awards submission is selected by an expert jury which is chosen by the [[Finnish Film Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ses.fi/en/news_news.asp?id=2470{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All 31 films listed below were accepted by [[AMPAS]], although two films- ''[[Drifting Clouds (film)|Drifting Clouds]]'' and ''[[Lights in the Dusk]]''- were withdrawn by director [[Aki Kaurismäki]] after the films were sent to Hollywood in both 1996 and 2006. According to [[Mark Johnson (producer)|Mark Johnson]], the chairman of the Academy's foreign-language committee, he was told by the Finnish selection committee that Kaurismaki does not like film competitions.&lt;ref name="Selkokari"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117952175.html | work=Variety | title=Kaurismaki turns off 'Lights' on Oscar bid | first=Antti | last=Selkokari | date=2006-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2017}}, only one Finnish film has been nominated for the Foreign Film Oscar- their 2002 submission ''[[The Man Without a Past]]'' was nominated for an Oscar on January 2003. Ironically, ''Past'' was also directed by Kaurismäki, but was not withdrawn. However, Kaurismaki boycotted the Academy Awards ceremony as protest over the U.S. involvement in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].&lt;ref name="Selkokari"/&gt;

Because of Kaurismaki's withdrawals, Klaus Härö has represented Finland more than any other Finnish director - four times.

==Submissions==
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956.&lt;ref name="HistPg2"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Academy Awards - Page 2 |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |url=http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/history02.html |accessdate=2008-08-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622191328/http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/history02.html |archivedate=22 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via [[secret ballot]] to determine the five nominees for the award.&lt;ref name="Rules"/&gt; Below is a list of the films that have been submitted by Finland for review by the Academy for the award by the year of the submission and the respective Academy Award ceremony.

All films were in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] except for their 2000 submission ''Seven Songs from the Tundra'' which was in [[Nenets languages|Nenets]] and 2011 submission ''Le Havre''  which was in [[French language|French]]. Their 2003 &amp; 2005 submissions were half in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] (also an official language of Finland), and their 1973 submission was in a Finnish dialect native to the Northern part of the country. The 2015 submission was in Estonian.

Cafarella developed an idea for a new television series that was loosely based on the original concept for GLOW and later used for [[Women of Wrestling]] (WOW). With Steve Blance, [[Jimmy Hart]], and the Flying Farley Brothers (brothers of late comedian [[Chris Farley]]), he filmed matches for the pilot episode of a proposed all-women's wrestling/sketch comedy television series called ''CRUSH'' in February 2003.

Although Hart stated in radio interviews that the series would debut on the [[Comedy Central]] network in fall 2003 and that [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]] would be involved in the series, the pilot was not sold to any networks or distributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crushwas73594.yuku.com/topic/372/t/CRUSH.html|title=CRUSH - Group|publisher=Yuku|accessdate=2010-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Cafarella and Hart partnered with Jonathan Vargas, who won a [[Powerball]] jackpot of [[United States dollar|$]]35.3 million the same year. Reusing many of the characters (although portrayed by different wrestlers and models/actresses) from CRUSH, they filmed matches for the pilot of [[Wrestlicious]] during the summer.

The Female Wrestling Channel was started in 2012 as the answer to Pro Wrestling not putting the ladies in front and because of Pro Wrestling having fake and pre-scripted outcomes when it comes to their matches.   The website features no nudity and implores fans to support the rare ladies who are willing to wrestle in a competitive and real fashion.

===Championships===
Monroe Jamison was handed the championship on Episode 65.  She is the current champion at the time of this writing, but faces stiff competition from the likes of Remy Rush, Scarlett Squeeze, and other ladies who are quickly rising on the roster.

'''''Machina II/The Friends &amp; Enemies of Modern Music''''' is the sixth studio album by the American [[alternative rock]] band [[The Smashing Pumpkins]]. It was released for free on the [[Internet]] on September 5, 2000. Plans for a standard physical release, bundled with the first part ''[[Machina/The Machines of God]]'', were revealed to happen sometime in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/smashing-pumpkins-announce-reissues-new-album-20110426 | title = Smashing Pumpkins Announce Reissues, New Album | work = [[Rolling Stone]] | date = 2011-04-26 | accessdate = 2011-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has since been postponed indefinitely.

The album itself, a double [[LP record|LP]], was packaged with three [[Extended play|EPs]] full of [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] and alternate versions.&lt;ref name="pr"&gt;{{cite press release | title = Machina II / The Friends and Enemies of Modern Music – Press Release | publisher = Constantinople Records | date = 2000-09-05 | url = https://spfreaks.wordpress.com/2012/11/14/collecting-to-the-extreme-episode-2/ | accessdate = 2015-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''Machina'' albums are loose [[concept album]]s telling the story of "a rock star gone mad".&lt;ref name="pr" /&gt; ''Machina II'' was the last Smashing Pumpkins studio album until the band reformed in 2006, and also their final studio album to feature the guitarist [[James Iha]], until his comeback in 2018's ''[[Shiny and Oh So Bright, Vol. 1 / LP: No Past. No Future. No Sun.]]''.

==Background==
Near the conclusion of the ''Machina'' sessions, it was [[Billy Corgan]]'s wish to release a double album of material, but [[Virgin Records]] was unwilling to do that following the disappointing sales of ''[[Adore (The Smashing Pumpkins album)|Adore]]''. After the release and poor sales of the single-disc ''Machina/The Machines of God'', Corgan then wanted to release the second ''Machina'' album separately, but Virgin declined to do this as well. The band nonetheless returned to the [[Chicago Recording Company]] in July 2000 to finish what would become ''Machina II/The Friends &amp; Enemies of Modern Music'', which was subsequently released on Corgan's own label [[Constantinople Records]]. Only twenty-five copies were made, and were given mostly to friends of the band in addition to radio station Q101. A few of the 25 copies were purposely shipped to prominent fans in the online community, with instructions to immediately redistribute it on the Internet free of charge.&lt;ref name="pr" /&gt;

==Promotion==
The Pumpkins performed a track from the album ("Cash Car Star") on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', which also ended up being the band's final television appearance until their 2007 revival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE8iPynWIKk|title=The Smashing Pumpkins - CASH CAR STAR (Live HD)|first=|last=iscariotwalkingshade|date=4 November 2009|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; A previous live performance of the song, in an earlier and slightly different-than-final-version form, had been broadcast as a portion of [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]' 1998 ''[[Psycho Circus]]'' Halloween special, where The Smashing Pumpkins served as the opening act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDZxIEf-xFk|title=The Smashing Pumpkins - Cash Car Star ~ Live|first=|last=Andrew Linck|date=28 December 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical style==

''Machina II'' reflects "Corgan's obsession with [[dream pop|dream-pop]], [[The Cure|Cure]]- and [[Depeche Mode]]-styled synth-[[Gothic rock|goth]], and [[glam rock|glam]]-tinged [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]."&lt;ref name="onion"/&gt; The album picks up the thematic elements of "Glass and The Machines of God" started in [[Machina/The Machines of God]]. Songs like "Glass' Theme", "Cash Car Star", "Home", and the B-side "Speed Kills" are related to Corgan's story. The first three songs ("Glass' Theme", "Cash Car Star", and "Dross"), considerably more intense than much of the Pumpkins' other releases,&lt;ref name="onion" /&gt; are a hearkening to the earlier, famous Smashing Pumpkins sound, blending dream pop with [[arena rock]],&lt;ref name="pitchfork" /&gt; while "[[Let Me Give the World to You]]" has a melodic, radio-friendly sound.&lt;ref name="pitchfork" /&gt;  "Real Love", which would later appear on the band's ''[[Rotten Apples]]'', has a sound reminiscent of [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]].&lt;ref name="onion" /&gt; "Home" has been called "simply gorgeous"&lt;ref name="pitchfork" /&gt; and compared to [[U2]].&lt;ref name="onion" /&gt; The album's closing track, "Here's to the Atom Bomb", has been compared favorably to the Pumpkins' biggest hit, "[[1979 (song)|1979]]."&lt;ref name="pitchfork" /&gt;

Because it was not released conventionally, few professional reviews of the album were published, but those that surfaced were generally positive. ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' called it an "artistic high" for the band.&lt;ref name="onion" /&gt; [[Pitchfork Media]] opined that the band sounded "energized and at a creative peak."&lt;ref name="pitchfork"/&gt; [[AllMusic]] stated that "As a high-class artifact and a gift to a loyal fan base, Machina II is a winner. "&lt;ref name="allmusic" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Critic reviews for Machina II: The Friends and Enemies of Modern Music | url = http://www.metacritic.com/music/machina-ii-the-friends-and-enemies-of-modern-music/critic-reviews | accessdate = 2007-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Michigan Daily]]'' also published a review calling the music "some of the best Pumpkins material to date."&lt;ref&gt;Whetsell, Ben. "Pumpkins a Smash on MP3".  [[Michigan Daily]].  2000-09-29.  Archived at [https://web.archive.org/web/20020827164518/http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/2000/sep/09-29-2000/arts/05.html Archive.org].&lt;/ref&gt; However, a more mixed review came from [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]], who noted that "There isn't really any new ground broken here, but the band revisits nearly every style they've adopted over the years", ultimately concluding that listeners should "take this as a proper farewell to the Smashing Pumpkins" and that "it's a nice album to remember them by".&lt;ref name="pitchfork"/&gt;

In April 2010, Billy Corgan commented on the album's reception, stating that: "I think the fan response at the time was very positive, as the fans who were around at the time seemed to like ''Machina II'' better than ''[[Machina/The Machines of God|Machina I]]''. That said, ''Machina I'' is proving now to be the more influential part of the work for many of the younger bands that I've talked to. [...] At the time I saw [releasing the album for free] as a one-time thing. I never thought we would see a near collapse of the music business and its dominant control on how music reaches people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|last=Corgan |first=Billy |authorlink=Billy Corgan |interviewer=Steven Rosen |title=Smashing Pumpkins: 'There Are Always More Riffs Than Words' |url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/smashing_pumpkins_there_are_always_more_riffs_than_words.html |date=24 April 2010 |accessdate=15 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027154534/http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/smashing_pumpkins_there_are_always_more_riffs_than_words.html |archivedate=27 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two-LP set is the album itself. Corgan has said that the three EPs are "technically the [[B-side]]s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Fricke | first = David | title = Smashing Pumpkins Look Back in Wonder | publisher = ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' | date = 2000-12-22 | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/smashingpumpkins/articles/story/5918770/smashing_pumpkins_look_back_in_wonder |accessdate = 2007-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; CR-01, CR-02, etc. all refer to their released on Constantinople Records (Constantinople Records-Released 1, etc.). The only other Constantinople release, CR-05, was ''[[Live at Cabaret Metro 10-5-88]]'', a gift given to fans exiting their farewell concert at the [[Cabaret Metro]]. The songs "[[Let Me Give the World to You]]," "Saturnine," and "Cash Car Star" were originally written and recorded for ''[[Adore (The Smashing Pumpkins album)|Adore]]''. The original "Let Me Give the World to You" was produced by [[Rick Rubin]], and was later released on the deluxe edition of the 2014 reissue of ''Adore'', alongside demos and remixes of "Saturnine" and a remixed version of Cash Car Star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Kaufman | first = Gil| title = Post-''Adore'' Album! | work = Addicted to Noise | date = 1998-03-04 | url = http://jamesiha.org/newsdatabase.php?id=1493 | accessdate = 2007-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release sources==
{{original research|section|date=January 2008}}
A number of a release sources exist for ''Machina II''. All of them are sourced from vinyl (except for the noted commercial releases of select tracks).

'''Virgin promos'''&lt;br/&gt;
This source is from in-house promo CDs made for internal use at Virgin Records (sourced from the vinyl records), made before ''Machina II'' was released to the public over the Internet. Two versions of the promos exist, a UK (type I) and U.S. (type II) version, both with four CDs corresponding to the vinyl copies.&lt;ref&gt;Images and descriptions of all four discs of both promos can be found [http://spfreaks.com/Default.aspx?page=COLLDETAILS&amp;item=351 here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228164711/http://spfreaks.com/Default.aspx?page=COLLDETAILS&amp;item=351 |date=2009-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As it was done in-house at a record company, it is generally assumed to be a high-quality transfer, though some of the faint voices which can be heard in the background before some of the EP songs are cut off, and in general, it is missing a considerable amount of audio between song transitions.

'''Q101 transfer'''&lt;br/&gt;
As mentioned above, the radio station Q101 received one of the 25 vinyl copies. It was subsequently transferred to two CDs by the station (one CD containing the EP tracks and one containing the LP tracks). The transfer was done by a high-profile radio station (presumably with high-end equipment and professional oversight) and [[spectrogram|spectral analysis]] shows the transfer to be of good quality. Copies were given away as prizes from the station.

'''SPIFC transfer'''&lt;br/&gt;
The [http://www.spifc.org SPIFC] transfer was produced from a vinyl copy by a member of the SPIFC. A transfer was eventually performed onto two CDs with "high-end" equipment. The SPIFC offers MP3 downloads of the transfer to members and held a contest giving away CD-R copies. The SPIFC transfer shows a 21&amp;nbsp;kHz tone which casts some doubt on the quality of the transfer.

'''MP3 web releases'''&lt;br/&gt;
Following the vinyl release a number of MP3 versions quickly surfaced on the web. A select number of people involved in the Smashing Pumpkins online fan community received one of the 25 releases. Using audio equipment they had immediate access to, these tracks were recorded, encoded to MP3, and quickly released for the masses. Later MP3 releases may be from one of the CD sources listed above or newer lesser known transfers. The Smashing Pumpkins' official site also had the full 25 tracks for download in both mp3 format (at 320kbit/s) and in [[RealAudio]] format.&lt;ref&gt;
The archived download page is available [https://web.archive.org/web/20010208184528/http://smashingpumpkins.com/lofi/M2pgLOFI.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the album was once again posted for download on the newly reopened SmashingPumpkins.com.[https://web.archive.org/web/20071019175945/http://www.smashingpumpkins.com/audio_upload/audio/machinaii/]

'''Commercial releases'''&lt;br/&gt;
Four tracks from ''Machina II'' have been released commercially. These are of specific note, because these versions were sourced from the master tapes rather than amateur vinyl transfers. "Real Love" was featured on ''[[Rotten Apples]]''. "Lucky 13" and "Slow Dawn" appeared on ''[[Judas O]]'', which was included with early copies of ''Rotten Apples''. The ''Machina II'' version of "[[Try, Try, Try]]" was one of the B-sides to the "[[Untitled (The Smashing Pumpkins song)|Untitled]]" single, titled "Try (Alternate Version)." The studio banter that precedes "Try, Try, Try" on ''Machina II'' has been removed from this version

==Features==
{{Expand section|date=March 2015}}

''MotoGP 15'' features 18 tracks, and the official riders from the 2014 and 2015 seasons of [[2015 Moto3 Series season|Moto3]], [[2015 Moto2 Series season|Moto2]] and [[2015 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|MotoGP]], and will also feature customizable bikes. The season starts with the night race in [[Losail International Circuit|Losail]], and also includes [[Circuito de Jerez|Jerez]], [[TT Circuit Assen|Assen]] and [[Sepang International Circuit|Sepang]], with a wind and wet weather system. Other features include tire wear, damage and mechanical failures.

Per official entries, [[Paul Bird Motorsport]] retired from the championship, but [[Suzuki]] and [[Aprilia]] made an official return. One new feature is the ability for the player to create their own racing team, with choice of logo and [[livery]]. Starting off with a [[Mahindra Racing|Mahindra]] MGP3O bike, the player must advance through the classes, and recruit sponsors. The game also has a mode which focuses on recreating events from the 2014 season, and in particular the rivalry between [[Jorge Lorenzo]], [[Valentino Rossi]] and [[Marc Márquez]], and the comebacks from riders such as [[Andrea Iannone]]. The PlayStation 4 version features an online league mode, where players battle for the best lap times.

[[File:Marc Marquez.jpeg|225px|thumb|right|Current riders Marquez (foreground) and Rossi (background) are both included in the game]]
The game includes a total of over 100 riders, each in their respective teams, making up the three current classes (e.g. the [[Ducati Desmosedici]] and [[Honda NSF250R]]), and one historic class (covering 1992-2001, e.g. the [[Cagiva GP500]]), with a total of around 25 bikes. Some riders need to be unlocked via the game's [[experience point|experience/level system]]. A further historic class is available to download (covering 2004-2006, e.g. the [[Kawasaki ZX-RR]]). After Releasing of DLC 4-Stroke Champions It is the first game under [[Milestone S.r.l.]] to feature the main 
[[Kawasaki ZX-RR]] [[Motorcycle]].

Pre-race introduction voice-overs are provided by Gavin Emmett.

The game had mixed reviews. The developer issued a warning that the Xbox One version contained a number of bugs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamespot.com/articles/motogp-dev-warns-of-xbox-one-performance-issues/1100-6428442/&lt;/ref&gt; On the PlayStation 4, the consensus was that it looked ok, but did not improve significantly on the previous game. The Official PlayStation Magazine praised the bike handling, adding that "AI riders put up a great fight, outbraking you into hairpins and slipstreaming past you down the straights. ... overall, the racing is solid and challenging, and securing a podium finish without resorting to the rewind function is a significant achievement."&lt;ref name="opmr" /&gt;  Analog Addiction praised the customisable race options and the stable and enjoyable multiplayer component.&lt;ref name="aarev" /&gt;

''MotoGP 15'' reached number 11 in the UK PS3 sales charts, as of April 19, 2016 still not available in North America&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chart-track.co.uk/index.jsp?c=p%2Fsoftware%2Fuk%2Farchive%2Findex_test.jsp&amp;ct=110031&amp;arch=t&amp;lyr=2015&amp;year=2015&amp;week=26&lt;/ref&gt; and number 16 in the PS4 charts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chart-track.co.uk/index.jsp?c=p%2Fsoftware%2Fuk%2Farchive%2Findex_test.jsp&amp;ct=110042&amp;arch=t&amp;lyr=2015&amp;year=2015&amp;week=26&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''One More Time''''' is a [[memoir]] by [[comedian]] [[Carol Burnett]]. It was published by [[Random House]] in 1986 and became a ''[[New York Times]]'' [[non-fiction]] [[bestseller]].

Burnett spent her childhood in a Depression-scarred [[Hollywood]] neighborhood, where she lived in a dingy single-room apartment with her grandmother, a [[hypochondriac]] devoted to [[Christian Science]]. The child of alcoholic parents - a mother who fantasized about success in [[Tinseltown]] and a father who eventually was committed to a public [[sanatorium]] - she constantly daydreamed about a [[show business]] career while at the same time realizing the odds of achieving one were very much against her, until a mysterious benefactor financed her move to [[New York City]]. In this book, she presents a [[coming of age]] tale that's humorous, heartbreaking, and hopeful.

The book served as the basis for the play ''[[Hollywood Arms]]'', which Burnett co-wrote with her daughter [[Carrie Hamilton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/05/02/carol-burnett-gets-candid-about-her-daughters-death-didnt-want-to-get-out-bed-for-while.html|title=Carol Burnett gets candid about her daughter's death: 'I didn't want to get out of bed for a while'|last=Nolasco|first=Stephanie|publisher=[[Fox News]]|date=May 2, 2018|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prima televize''' (previously '''Prima family''', originally '''Premiéra''') is a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] private [[television station]]. Its channel is broadcast from [[Prague]]. Its current owner is FTV Prima, spol. s&amp;nbsp;r.&amp;nbsp;o., general manager [[Marek Singer]].

The channel has been broadcast since 26 November 1992. First only in [[Prague]] and Central [[Bohemia]] under the name '''FTV Premiéra'''; later '''Premiéra TV'''. It has held a broadcasting licence since 1994 with a condition that a part of the broadcasting time will be used for local and regional broadcasters. But in fact their total proportion of local programming has been gradually lowered. Since 1997, the name of station has been '''Prima televize''' (which in [[Czech language|Czech]] means "cool television"). In 2003, Prima's broadcasting licence was extended until 28 June 2018.

In autumn 2005, a 50% stake was purchased by [[Modern Times Group|MTG]].,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iprima.cz/o-spolecnosti/predstaveni-spolecnosti | title = Představení společnosti | work = Prima TV | date = 24 July 2009 | accessdate = 27 January 2010 | language = Czech | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110701065045/http://www.iprima.cz/o-spolecnosti/predstaveni-spolecnosti | archivedate = 1 July 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; since this date, the channel has also aired many new western TV series such as ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'', ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'', ''[[The Closer]]'', ''[[Medium (TV series)|Medium]]'', ''[[Criminal Minds]]'', ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'' and many more, although '''Prima''' has many years of broadcasting of German and French crime series. See the ''Foreign series'' section.

==Renaming into Prima family==

As 31 October 2011, Prima's owner reported the channel's cancellation as of 1 January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prima Televize po Silvestru skončí, nahradí jí její rodinnější verze|url=http://kultura.idnes.cz/prima-televize-po-silvestru-skonci-nahradi-ji-jeji-rodinnejsi-verze-1g8-/televize.aspx?c=A111031_172832_televize_tt|accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prima TV has ended and since 4:47 AM is substituted by '''Prima family'''. Its first show was ''[[Finding Nemo]]''.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

==Controversy==
The network has been criticised for its biased anti-migrant position during the [[European migrant crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21707125-politics-central-and-eastern-europe-are-increasingly-driven-businesses-own-media How a media mogul helped turn Czechs against refugees]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[pantomime]], a '''principal boy''' role is the young male protagonist of the play, traditionally played by a young [[actress]] in boy's clothes.

The tradition grew out of laws restricting the use of child actors in London theatre, and the responsibility carried by such lead roles. A [[Breeches role]] was also a rare opportunity for an early 20th-century actress to wear a costume revealing the legs covered only in tights, potentially increasing the size of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.limelightscripts.co.uk/scripts/history.htm |title=History of British Pantomime |author=anon |publisher=Limelight Scripts |year=2005 |accessdate=18 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110421063824/http://www.limelightscripts.co.uk/scripts/history.htm |archivedate=21 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of having a female play the principal boy has become less common,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Copping |first=Jaspar |date=1 December 2013 |title=Curtain falls on traditional panto - oh yes it does! |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-news/10486457/Curtain-falls-on-traditional-panto-oh-yes-it-does.html |newspaper=The Telegraph|access-date=8 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as further outlets are sought for the talents of young male popular stars and actors.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Although not written as a pantomime,{{non sequitur|date=December 2016}} ''[[Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up]]'' is often produced as one with the tradition of a female principal boy continuing.

==HIV==
{{main|HIV/AIDS in Tanzania}}
[[Tanzania]] faces a mature, generalized HIV epidemic. In 2011, an estimated 1.6 million Tanzanians were living with HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/documents/epidemiology/2012/gr2012/JC2434_WorldAIDSday_results_en.pdf|title='UNAIDS World AIDS Day Report 2012|page=7|author=|date=2012|publisher=UNAIDS}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 1 out of 20 residents in the capital [[Dar es Salaam]] and 1 in 3 sex workers are infected with the [[HIV]] virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/health-july-dec13-prostitutes_11-01/ |title=The HIV rebound nobody is discussing &amp;#124; Updates &amp;#124; PBS NewsHour |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nationally, 28% of sex workers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HIV prevalence amongst sex workers |url=http://www.aidsinfoonline.org/gam/stock/shared/vc/vcshare.html?id=d9c0ff12-f62c-44e7-8e2c-dbe736bbea30 |website=www.aidsinfoonline.org |publisher=UNAIDS |accessdate=22 July 2018 |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 4.7% of all adults are infected.&lt;ref name="unaids16"&gt;{{cite web|title=United Republic of Tanzania 2017 Country factsheet|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/unitedrepublicoftanzania|website=[[UNAIDS]]|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports show that an increase in the number of cases of HIV and [[AIDS]] are growing at an alarming rate in Zanzibar. This is thought to have been added to by large numbers of tourists entering Zanzibar and fueling demand for prostitutes.&lt;ref name="hartford-hwp1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/36/546.html|title=Tourists Influx Sparks HIV/AIDS In Zanzibar|author=|date=5 April 2000|location=Dar es Salaam|agency=TOMRIC News Agency|via=Hartford Web Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Tanzania}}
Tanzania is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to sex trafficking. Internal trafficking is more prevalent than transnational trafficking and characteristically facilitated by victims’ family members, friends, or intermediaries offering assistance with education or securing employment in urban areas. Impoverished children from the rural interior remain most vulnerable to trafficking. Girls are exploited in sex trafficking, particularly in tourist hubs and along the border with [[Kenya]]. Previous media reports indicate girls are subjected to sex trafficking in [[China]]. Tanzanian nationals are sometimes subjected sex trafficking in other African countries, the [[Middle East]], Europe, [[Asia]], and the [[United States]]. Trafficking victims from other countries, particularly children from [[Burundi]], [[Rwanda]], and Kenya, as well as adults from [[India]], [[Nepal]], and [[Yemen]] are subjected to sex trafficking. Citizens of neighbouring countries may transit Tanzania before being subjected to sex trafficking in [[South Africa]], Europe, and the Middle East.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tanzania 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271296.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=14 January 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Tanzania as a "[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]]" country.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

==Honiara Central Market==
In 2009, there were active student surveys of the sex trade involving market women and young girls from the ''[[Honiara Central Market|Central Market]]''.&lt;ref name="Markets-Profile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unwomen-asiapacific.org/docs/publications/fiji/knowledge_products/Solomon_Islands_Markets_Profiles.pdf|title=Solomon Islands Markets Profile|series=Partners to Improve Markets (PIM)|date=2009|publisher=UN Women}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, fishermen, who were paid to transport girls to foreign fishing vessels outside the harbour of Honiara, described the ''Central Market'' as one of "the most evident or well-known pickup spots" for prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.solomonstarnews.com/news/national/3748-police-on-prostitution|title=Police on prostitution|date=27 August 2014|newspaper=Solomon Star|access-date=31 August 2016|first=Jeremy|last=Inifiri |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160911130514/http://www.solomonstarnews.com/news/national/3748-police-on-prostitution |archive-date=27 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==RAMSI==
In 2006, the Solomon Islands' Prime Minister, [[Manasseh Sogavare]], filed a police complaint against the Australian led [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands]] (RAMSI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solomons opposition chides PM for attacks on RAMSI|url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/166184/solomons-opposition-chides-pm-for-attacks-on-ramsi|website=Radio New Zealand|accessdate=8 February 2018|language=en-nz|date=17 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He alleged the peacekeeping force were smuggling local women into their base at the former Guadalcanal Beach Resort and using them as prostitutes. The claims were denied by the RAMSI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RAMSI rejects Solomons prostitute claims|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/ramsi-rejects-solomons-prostitute-claims/2006/11/15/1163266598949.html|website=The Age|accessdate=8 February 2018|language=en|date=15 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
The Solomon Islands is a source, transit, and destination country for local and [[Southeast Asia]]n women subjected to [[forced prostitution]], and local children subjected to sex trafficking. Women from [[China]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], and the [[Philippines]] are recruited for legitimate work, some paying large sums of money in recruitment fees, and upon arrival are forced into prostitution.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Solomon Islands 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271279.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=8 February 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solomon Island children are subjected to sex trafficking within the country, sometimes in exchange for money or goods, particularly near foreign logging camps, on foreign and local commercial fishing vessels, and at hotels and entertainment establishments. Girls and young women are recruited to travel to logging camps for domestic work and some are subsequently exploited in prostitution. Some parents receive payments for sending young women and girls into forced marriages with foreign workers at logging and mining companies; many of them are exploited in prostitution.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks the Solomon Islands as a "[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]]" country.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4787">'''Red''' was a [[nightclub]] located in [[Washington D.C.]]. It shut its doors on October 23, 2005, after nine years of operation. The club was owned by Farid Ali, and featured a set roster of weekly resident DJs as well as a number of guest DJs from around the U.S. and abroad.
==Background==
The club was located at 1802 Jefferson Place NW in Washington D.C., and was simply a basement venue with a small bar, a dance floor, painted red brick walls, and minimal seating. The sound system, however, was considered the heartbeat of the club and was often referred to as one of the better sounding systems in the city. Red was known for parties that often lasted until the early morning hours.
Red was opened in 1996, and was decidedly influential in the Washington D.C. [[club scene]]. [[Urb Magazine]] named Red the 'Best intimate nightclub' in 2003. Red was officially closed in 2005, after a four-day dance marathon. The club's owner cited rising rent as the reason for the shutdown[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/20/AR2005102000724.html?sub=AR]. A discussion of the club's closing by some of its patrons can be found on [http://deephousepage.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=31;t=006562 deephousepage.com] and [http://www.districtsoul.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=3946&amp;start=0 districtsoul.com.]

{{about|the Latin music|other uses|Rock en Español (disambiguation)}}{{distinguish|Latin rock}}
'''Rock en español''' ({{lang-es|Spanish-language rock}}) is a term used widely in the English-speaking world to refer any kind of [[rock music]] featuring Spanish vocals. Unlike English-speaking bands, very few acts reached worldwide success and often not even between different Spanish-speaking countries due to a lack of promotion. Despite ''rock en español'' 's origins in the late 1950s, many rock acts achieved at best nationwide fame until the Internet consolidated the listeners. However, some ''rock en español'' artists did become internationally popular with the help of a promotional campaign from the mid 1980s to the mid 1990s called ''"Rock en tu idioma"'' ([[Rock in your language]]). Some specific rock-based styles influenced by folkloric rhythms have also developed in these regions. Some of the more prominent styles are ''[[Latin rock]]'', a fusion of rock music with Latin American and Caribbean folkloric sounds developed in Latino communities; ''[[Latin alternative]]'', an alternative rock scene which blended a Latin sound with other genres like Caribbean [[ska]], [[reggae]], and [[Soca music|soca]]; or ''[[Flamenco rock|Andalusian rock]]'', a flamenco-influenced style that emerged in Spain.

==History==

=== Beginnings (1956–1964)===
[[File:Teentops-enargentina.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Los Teen Tops]] playing live in Argentina in 1962.]]
Spanish-speaking rock music began in the late-1950s, through listening to performers like [[Elvis Presley]], [[Buddy Holly]] and [[Bill Haley]], who popularized [[rockabilly]] in the United States. The song "El relojito" by Gloria Ríos released in 1956 is often considered the blueprint of ''rock en español''. In 1958, [[Ritchie Valens]] covered the Mexican folk song "[[La Bamba (song)|La Bamba]]", popularizing Spanish-language rock music throughout Latin America. That year, [[Danny Flores|Daniel Flores]] performed his hit song "[[Tequila (song)|Tequila]]", which reached nº1 in Billboard charts. 

The new sound immediately caught the attention of the middle and upper class.

The first rock bands in Latin America were created in the late 1950s with [[Los Llopis]] and [[Los Teen Tops]] achieving some success covering American rock classics during the early 1960s. The Spanish scene received some influences of non-English-speaking countries with the [[Yé-yé]] style as could be seen with [[Raphael (singer)|Raphael]]. In the early 1960s, those styles of commercial rock music were nicknamed ''[[Nueva ola]]'' (New wave) in some South American countries to refer the bands that adopted the American and European styles.

===British invasion effect (1964–1970)===
[[File:Los Gatos.jpg|thumb|[[Los Gatos (band)|Los Gatos]] in 1967. With their single "[[La balsa]]", they turned the movement into a massive youth phenomenon.]]
After the popularization of [[The Beatles]] and the world success of the [[British Invasion]], the Hispanophone world adapted new styles like Beat music, rhythm and blues, psychedelia, soul, folk-rock and pop music.

The influences of beat music and psychedelic pop were noticeable in some acts such as [[Los Brincos]], [[El Kinto]], [[Los Gatos (band)|Los Gatos]] or [[The Speakers]], while other successful bands featured mostly English and few Spanish vocals like [[Los Bravos]] or [[Los Shakers]]. Success outside of the native&lt;!-- is this something other than Spanish that early? --&gt; and Spanish-speaking scene proved difficult to attain though, and the few hits these bands achieved worldwide were sung in English, as [[Miguel Ríos]] and Los Bravos did for example. [[Los Saicos]] were one of the very oldest proto-punk bands in the world.

By mid-decade the Mexican (later US citizen) [[Carlos Santana]] moved north to California and soon joined the burgeoning [[San Francisco]] rock scene. Forming the band [[Santana (band)|Santana]] towards the end of the sixties, he would gather a shifting group of musicians from mixed Anglo-Saxon and Hispanic backgrounds; the band would become one of the more popular acts of the 1970s in the U.S., Mexico, and Europe and brought together elements of rock 'n' roll and jazz with Latin percussion and harmonics (as evidenced, for example, on ''[[Abraxas (album)|Abraxas]]'' (1970) and ''[[Moonflower (album)|Moonflower]]'' (1977)). The band would consistently alternate lyrics in Spanish and English; they were arguably the most successful crossover Latin/Anglo rock band to date, and were important in spreading interest in Latin percussion and drumming around the world.
 
Although he is not a rock en español musician, Carlos Santana's background is that of a traditional Latin musician who has fused rock guitar (and jazz and [[salsa music|salsa]] rhythms) with classic Latin American songs and a sizeable body of compositions by himself and his band. Their hit song "[[Oye Como Va]]" is an example of Santana's fusion, being originally composed by famous [[Latin jazz]] and [[Mambo (music)|mambo]] musician [[Tito Puente]]. From the late 1960s on, concurrently with the success of Santana, there was a growing interest in Latin-American folk music and dancing as well as a [[Latin American Boom|worldwide cultural boom for Latin-American literature]] and its colourful, sometimes surrealist and [[Magic realism|magic realist]] storytelling, which sustained an interest in Latin music in general, though not always in Latin rock music as such. There was a noticeable Latin influence in 1970s jazz (e.g. [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Flora Purim]], [[Return to Forever]]) and some acts like [[Malo (band)|Malo]] were performing Latin Rock during the same decade.

However, styles like blues, acid rock, hard rock, and prog rock would be very influential around the next decade. [[Almendra (band)|Almendra]], led by [[Luis Alberto Spinetta]], was one of the most important prog bands of the late 1960s and later, Spinetta would become one of the most important artists of the 1970s rock en español scene,

===Prog rock domain, hard rock origins and Repression (1970-1979)===
[[File:Luis Alberto Spinetta en 1976.jpg|thumb|[[Luis Alberto Spinetta]] was the frontman of [[Almendra (band)|Almendra]], [[Pescado Rabioso]], [[Invisible (band)|Invisible]], among others.]]
[[File:Triana - Billboard.jpg|left|thumb|[[Triana (band)|Triana]] in the recording studio in 1974.]]
Influenced by the new trends of the 60's, psychedelic acts like [[Los Dug Dug's]], [[Pescado Rabioso]] (heavy psych)— or [[La Revolución de Emiliano Zapata]] (although rarely they featured Spanish vocals during these years); blues acts like [[Manal]] and progressive rock bands like [[Invisible (band)|Invisible]], [[Sui Generis]] (folk prog), [[Témpano]], [[Los Jaivas]] (Andean rock), [[Vox Dei]] (which style would turn harder sounding) o [[Triana (band)|Triana]] (heavily influenced by flamenco) appeared. Triana were pioneers of the [[flamenco rock|Andalusian rock]] scene, a new style emeged in Spain that melt prog rock with flamenco.

As the hard rock merged in the UK in the late 1960s, the first hard rock acts appeared in the early 1970s with bands like [[Pappo's Blues]]. Also, a new hard rock movement influenced by prog, blues and punk called Spanish [[Rock urbano]] lead the harder scene of the late 1970s with bands like [[Leño]].

But in these days appeared some repression of rock music in Mexico. The government forced artists, labels and radio stations to go "underground" as they associated the music with the breakdown of societal standards. The main pushing edge that created tension with the government was due to the Avándaro Rock Festival in 1971. Also the dictatorship established in Argentina in 1976 make some Argentine artist leave the country for greener pastures in Europe, mostly Spain. They joined the Spanish rock scene and sometimes Hispano-Argentine bands [[Tequila (band)|Tequila]] get formed and achieved success. Tequila joined an rock and roll, glam and rhythm &amp; blues scene along with other Spanish acts [[Burning (band)|Burning]] or [[La Orquesta Mondragón]].

===Internationalization (1980s)===
While the declining of punk rock in the Anglophone scene, the more prominent punk bands appeared along the 1980s with [[La Polla Records]], [[Siniestro Total]] or [[Los Violadores]]. Subgenres derived from punk like [[New wave music|New Wave]] and [[Post punk]] were also important during the 1980s. [[La Movida Madrileña]] was an important movement of these styles among others.
In the mid-1980s, a promotional campaign called "Rock en tu idioma" (Rock in your language) started helping to internationalize some bands. [[Soda Stereo]] is largely credited as the first Spanish-language rock band to gain widespread popularity across [[Latin America]]. However, there was equal transnational success in the late 1980s from [[Virus (Argentine band)|Virus]], [[Radio Futura]], [[Enanitos Verdes]], [[Caifanes]], [[Hombres G]], or [[Los Prisioneros]] among others during the same time period.

Though mainly a teen-pop band, Puerto Rican band [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]] at times also dabbled into Rock en Espanol during this decade; examples of their rock music work include their albums "Quiero Ser" (alternatively named "Rock Chiquillo" in some markets), "A Todo Rock" and "Hijos del Rock" as well as songs such as "Quiero Rock", "Rock en la TV", "Mi Banda Toca Rock", "[[Sube a mi Motora]]" and "Jovenes".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.musicofpuertorico.com/index.php/artistas/menudo/&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Los Chicos de Puerto Rico]] a band that was similar to Menudo, had a song named "Rock Solido" which was released during 1983.

===Recent times (1990s onward)===
The final amalgamation into a coherent international scene was helped by the introduction of [[MTV Latin America]] in 1993, where the first video shown, "[[We are sudamerican rockers]]" by Chilean band [[Los Prisioneros]], reflected its aims to create a Latin American scene. In the late 1990s, [[MTV]] created the Latino Award in the [[MTV Video Music Award]]s and [[Los Premios MTV Latinoamérica|Premios MTV Latinoamérica]] in 2002, awards that recognize the talented bands and achievements of the genre. However, MTV Latin America was criticized for focusing primarily on rock bands from Argentina and Mexico, with the occasional band from Chile or [[Colombia]].  For example, bands on MTV Latino that received very regular airplay were [[Los Fabulosos Cadillacs]], [[Mano Negra]], [[Café Tacuba]], [[Aterciopelados]], [[Maldita Vecindad]], [[Babasónicos]], [[Los Rodríguez]] and [[Héroes del Silencio]]. On the other hand, some hard rock bands like [[La Renga]], [[Cuca (band)|Cuca]] or [[Extremoduro]] achieved success.

During the success of Alternative rock in the 1990s, many bands performed alt rock and [[Latin Alternative]] (style that combined alt rock with ska, reggae and Latin folkloric elements) like [[Robi Draco Rosa]], [[Caifanes]], [[Café Tacuba]], and [[La Ley (band)|La Ley]] initiated a new stage of Latin rock by broadening its international appeal. Since then, successful bands and musicians include [[Juanes]], [[Líbido (band)|Libido]], [[Maná]] (Mexico), [[Jaguares (band)|Jaguares]], [[Aterciopelados]], [[Bersuit Vergarabat]], [[Jorge Drexler]] and [[Los Tres]] among others. The new bands were able to be successful through the development of the music video in the 1990s.

==Rock en español in the United States==
{{see also|Chicano rock}}
Rock en español borrows heavily from rock and roll music and traditional and popular music of Spanish-speaking countries such as [[cumbia]], [[ranchera]], [[rumba]], and [[Tango (dance)|tango]]. In its 50-year history, it has evolved from having a cult-like following to being a more well established music genre.

In [[Los Angeles]], an underground scene has developed and continues to flourish that supports the local rock en español acts. Top bands from the LA REE scene include Motita, Pastilla, Maria Fatal, Rascuache, Voz de Mano, Cabula, Las 15 letras, Verdadera FE, and Los Olvidados.

Record labels that have supported US based REE include Aztlan records, El Mero Mero Records, and Mofo Records. Many of them have been associated to the [[Chicano rock]] scene.

==Synopsis==
{{main|List of Smash episodes}}
The show revolves around a group of characters creating new [[Broadway musical]]s, where everyone must balance their often chaotic personal life with the all-consuming demands of life in the theater. The series features original music by composers [[Marc Shaiman]] and [[Scott Wittman]].

===Season 1 (2012)===
{{main|Smash (season 1)}}
Julia Houston ([[Debra Messing]]) and Tom Levitt ([[Christian Borle]]), a Broadway writing team, came up with the idea of a new musical based on the life of [[Marilyn Monroe]] titled ''[[Bombshell (musical)|Bombshell]]''. Producer Eileen Rand ([[Anjelica Huston]]), in the midst of divorce proceedings from her philandering husband, jumps on board and brings with her Derek Wills ([[Jack Davenport]]), a difficult but brilliant director. Ivy Lynn ([[Megan Hilty]]) is initially cast as Marilyn, but is forced to deal with competition from the talented, yet naive ensemble member Karen Cartwright ([[Katharine McPhee]]). Julia's former lover Michael Swift ([[Will Chase]]) is initially cast in the role of [[Joe DiMaggio]]. However, when Julia and Michael's reunion causes serious trouble in her marriage to Frank ([[Brian d'Arcy James]]), the decision is made to fire Michael. The role of Marilyn is recast with film star Rebecca Duvall ([[Uma Thurman]]), leaving Ivy devastated. After a somewhat disastrous out-of-town opening in Boston, Rebecca has fallen sick due to a peanut allergy and the actor playing Joe departs the production for a better gig. Derek subsequently casts Karen in the role of Marilyn and Michael is reinstated as Joe. Karen discovers Ivy has slept with her fiancé Dev ([[Raza Jaffrey]]), while Eileen finds out that her assistant Ellis (Jaime Cepero) was the one who poisoned Rebecca and fires him. Karen gets through her debut and the season ends with the closing number being applauded by the audience.

===Season 2 (2013)===
{{main|Smash (season 2)}}
As ''[[Bombshell (musical)|Bombshell]]'' works to open on Broadway in New York City, the show runs into legal and creative troubles which threaten its future.  Meanwhile, the cast and crew (featured in Season 1) attempt to find work. Karen meets two aspiring friends and partners (Kyle, a stage writer played by Andy Mientus, and Jimmy, a composer played by [[Jeremy Jordan (stage actor)|Jeremy Jordan]]) and tries to get their work noticed, especially by Derek. Derek works with Broadway star Veronica Moore ([[Jennifer Hudson]]), who becomes friends with Karen. Ivy gets the lead in ''Liaisons'', a show based on the play ''[[Les liaisons dangereuses (play)|Les Liaisons Dangereuses]]''. ''[[Bombshell (musical)|Bombshell]]'' needs work in order to open on Broadway. First, Peter Gillman ([[Daniel Sunjata]]), a [[dramaturg]] with whom Julia had a rocky relationship is hired in order to help re-write the show. Second, Jerry ([[Michael Cristofer]]) replaces Eileen as the show's producer after she had to step down when the federal authorities found out (through Jerry's orchestration) that she had financed ''Bombshell'' with illegal money. Jimmy and Kyle's show, called ''[[Hit List (musical)|Hit List]]'', eventually goes to the New York Fringe Festival and then they meet a producer for an off-broadway theater called Manhattan Theatre Workshop. Karen quits ''Bombshell'' to be in ''Hit List'' because she has to choose one of them. Ivy takes Karen's role as Marilyn Monroe in ''Bombshell''. ''Hit List'' starts rehearsals. Karen and Jimmy's relationship starts to develop but may cause some disturbance in the work place with Derek's secret feelings for Karen. ''Hit List'' goes to Broadway produced by Jerry and ''Bombshell'' and ''Hit List'' go face to face at the [[Tony Awards]]. ''Hit List'' wins 7 Tonys, which is more than ''Bombshell'', however ''Bombshell'' wins Best Musical and Best Actress (Ivy Lynn) in a Leading Role.

==Cast and characters==
{{main|Characters of Smash}}
* [[Debra Messing]] as Julia Houston,&lt;ref name="smashbios"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcumv.com/mediavillage/networks/nbcentertainment/smash/biographies |title=Smash Biographies |publisher=NBCUniversal Media Village |date= |accessdate=March 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205003041/http://www.nbcumv.com/mediavillage/networks/nbcentertainment/smash/biographies |archivedate=February 5, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a successful Broadway lyricist and the musical's co-writer. She is married with a son, but had an affair with Michael Swift, who played Joe DiMaggio in the initial ''Marilyn'' workshop. Houston is based on creator Theresa Rebeck.&lt;ref name="THR1" /&gt; 
* [[Jack Davenport]] as Derek Wills,&lt;ref name="smashbios"/&gt; the director of the musical, who will stop at nothing to make the show a success. He has an on-and-off relationship with ''Marilyn'' workshop star Ivy Lynn, though he has also shown interest in Karen Cartwright and had a physical relationship with Rebecca Duvall during the Boston preview before she left the show. 
* [[Katharine McPhee]] as Karen Cartwright,&lt;ref name="smashbios"/&gt; an [[Ingenue (stock character)|ingenue]] from [[Iowa]], who lands a successful audition and becomes a serious contender for the role of Monroe. Somewhat new to show business, her naiveté is generally scorned by her peers, though her talent is rarely called into question. She played Marilyn for the Boston preview, when Rebecca Duvall left. In season 2, she helps ''Hit List'' get started and plays Amanda/Nina after she quits Bombshell.
* [[Christian Borle]] as Tom Levitt,&lt;ref name="smashbios"/&gt; a theatrical composer and Julia's longtime songwriting partner. He and Derek Wills have an acrimonious relationship stemming from a business fallout 11 years ago. Tom briefly dates a Republican lawyer but later becomes attracted to Sam Strickland, a dancer in the ensemble of ''Bombshell''.
* [[Megan Hilty]] as Ivy Lynn,&lt;ref name="smashbios"/&gt; a seasoned performer who, at the beginning of the series, is working in the ensemble of ''Heaven On Earth'', another Broadway musical that Tom and Julia wrote. Ivy is favored by nearly everyone on board with the production to play Marilyn Monroe, but after the workshop flops, she is replaced by Rebecca Duvall. Throughout the show, she is in an on-and-off relationship with the ''Bombshell'' director Derek Wills and finds herself constantly competing with Karen in many different situations, eventually losing the role of Marilyn to her for the Boston preview.
* [[Anjelica Huston]] as Eileen Rand,&lt;ref name="smashbios"/&gt; the musical's tenacious producer, who is dealing with divorce proceedings from her husband, Jerry, which could threaten the musical and forces her to think outside the box in securing funds for the show.  A running gag throughout the series is Eileen throwing drinks into Jerry's face.
* [[Jeremy Jordan (stage actor)|Jeremy Jordan]] as Jimmy Collins (Season 2), a working-class man from Brooklyn who is on the brink of self-destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2012/05/21/smash-season-2-casting-new-series-regulars/|title=Exclusive: ''Smash'' Shakes Up Cast, Adding Three New Regulars for Season 2|first=Matt Webb|last=Mitovich|publisher=TVLine|date=May 21, 2012|accessdate=June 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2012/06/14/smash-jeremy-jordan/|title=''Smash'' Exclusive: ''Newsies'' Star Jeremy Jordan Joins Season 2 Cast as a Series Regular|first=Michael|last=Ausiello|publisher=TVLine|date=June 14, 2012|accessdate=June 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the first season continues, Ellis, convinced his suggestion of Marilyn created the show, takes more steps to be recognized as a producer, including giving Rebecca a drink mixed with peanuts, which she is allergic to, in order to remove her as the star. He boasts of this to Eileen as proof of his skills but she responds by firing him. 
* [[Raza Jaffrey]] as Dev Sundaram (Season 1),&lt;ref name="smashbios"/&gt;&lt;ref name="season2cast"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eonline.com/news/watch_with_kristin/smash_shocker_which_stars_were_just/318281 |title=''Smash'' Shocker!

James was credited as guest star in the pilot, but was promoted to regular from episode 2. He made guest appearances in the second season premiere and the series finale.

==Development and production==

===Conception===
Development began in 2009 at [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] by then-Showtime entertainment president [[Robert Greenblatt]] and [[Steven Spielberg]], from an idea by Spielberg, who had been working on the concept for years;&lt;ref name=showspielteam&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118008994 | title = Showtime, Spielberg team on series | last = Littleton | first = Cynthia |date = September 22, 2009 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate = June 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenblatt, described as a "devoted theater geek", had also produced a short-lived [[9 to 5 (musical)|musical adaptation]] of the film ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]'' in 2009.&lt;ref name="Buzzfeed story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Aurthur|first=Kate|title=How 'Smash' Became TV's Biggest Train Wreck|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/kateaurthur/how-smash-became-tvs-biggest-train-wreck|newspaper=[[BuzzFeed]]|date=January 30, 2013|accessdate=March 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original concept was that each season would follow the production of a new musical; if any of them were "stage-worthy", Spielberg would make them into actual Broadway musicals.&lt;ref name="concept"&gt;{{cite web|last=Green |first=Jesse |url=http://nymag.com/arts/tv/features/smash-2012-1/index1.html |title=Will 'Smash' on NBC Be a Success? |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=January 2, 2012 |accessdate=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was inspired by ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'' and ''[[Upstairs, Downstairs (1971 TV series)|Upstairs, Downstairs]]'' as role models for successful TV dramas. [[Garson Kanin]]'s novel ''[[Smash (novel)|Smash]]'' (New York: Viking, 1980) provided the title and setting, although the plots have little in common.&lt;ref name="concept"/&gt;

Greenblatt then brought the project with him to [[NBC]] when he was made NBC Entertainment president in January 2011. [[Theresa Rebeck]] wrote the pilot script and is series creator.&lt;ref name="concept"/&gt; Executive producers [[Craig Zadan]] and [[Neil Meron]] suggested Rebeck for the series to Spielberg and Greenblatt.&lt;ref name="concept"/&gt; NBC ordered production of a pilot in January 2011 for the [[2011–12 United States network television schedule|2011–12 television season]].&lt;ref name=pilotordered&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.deadline.com/2011/01/nbc-picks-up-2-pilots-including-hourlong-musical-from-steven-spielberg/ | title = NBC Orders Steven Spielberg Musical Pilot | last = Andreeva | first = Nellie |date = January 21, 2011 | website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] | accessdate = June 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series has a large number of executive producers including [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Craig Zadan]], [[Neil Meron]], [[David Marshall Grant]], Rebeck, Darryl Frank and Justin Falvey.&lt;ref name=nbcups/&gt; [[Marc Shaiman]] and [[Scott Wittman]] serve as the composers and executive producers.&lt;ref name=nbcups/&gt; In March 2012, Rebeck stepped down as showrunner of the musical drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |title='Smash' Creator Theresa Rebeck To Depart |url=http://www.deadline.com/tag/theresa-rebeck/ |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |accessdate=April 25, 2012 |date=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 24, 2012, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported that ''[[Gossip Girl]]'' executive producer [[Joshua Safran]] would take the lead for the second season while Rebeck would remain a writer and an executive producer.&lt;ref name="THR1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |title='Smash' Taps 'Gossip Girl's' Josh Safran as New Showrunner |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/smash-gossip-girl-josh-safran-showrunner-315983 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=April 25, 2012|date=April 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on May 2, 2012, Rebeck stated in an interview that she would not be returning to the show in any capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Siegler |first=Mara |title=Showrunner Theresa Rebeck on Smash: 'I'm Moving On' |url=http://www.vulture.com/2012/05/theresa-rebeck-on-smash-im-moving-on.html |publisher=Vulture.com |accessdate=May 21, 2012|date=May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production===
Many of those behind ''Smash'' began the series with high hopes. Rebeck was a large part of that. As one early hire later described her to ''[[BuzzFeed]]'': "She was this kick-ass woman [[showrunner]] who wasn't taking shit from the network. Someone who had a very clear vision who was going to stand up to the network. They were all good things in the beginning."&lt;ref name="Buzzfeed story" /&gt;

Despite her experience writing and producing in television, Rebeck had never been a showrunner, responsible for the day-to-day operations of a series, before. [[David Marshall Grant]], a [[playwright]] and actor who had served in that capacity during ''[[Brothers &amp; Sisters (2006 TV series)|Brothers &amp; Sisters]]''' final seasons, was hired as [[executive producer]] to help her with it. Rebeck was reportedly resentful, and worried that she was being [[setting up to fail|set up to fail]] and Grant positioned to replace her. Very quickly she began shutting him out of key decisions.&lt;ref name="Buzzfeed story" /&gt;

Rebeck also decided she would not run a "writers' room," i.e., a regular meeting with the entire writing staff to discuss and perfect episodes and plotlines. "[They] really are not my thing, because I can only stand being in a room with people so many hours a day," she told ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''. "And I feel like early drafts should be speedy because everyone changes their mind, so why spend a lot of time up front parsing sentences?"&lt;ref name="NY mag preview story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Green|first=Jesse|title=A House of Mirrors Called 'Smash'|url=http://nymag.com/arts/tv/features/smash-2012-1/index2.html|newspaper=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=December 26, 2011|accessdate=March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead she would follow the example of showrunners like [[Matthew Weiner]] and [[Aaron Sorkin]] and have writers submit a first draft, which she then revised.&lt;ref name="Buzzfeed story" /&gt;

Very quickly, the writers recalled, the show became a "dictatorship." Rebeck's opinion was the only one that mattered. She insisted on writing the second and third episodes herself, and writers said that the drop in quality was evident during pre-air screenings. During this time Rebeck was often fighting with Spielberg, who wanted Hilty, Greenblatt, or Grant replaced. As a result of these distractions, plotlines like Julia's adoption dilemma (mirroring Rebeck's real life) began to assume unusual prominence, and along with them secondary characters like Leo and Ellis became almost main characters—the latter because Spielberg reportedly liked him.&lt;ref name="Buzzfeed story" /&gt;

Since the writers never met as a group, they found that finished episodes often repeated the same character moments instead of advancing those characters, and that strange out-of-context moments, usually musical numbers set away from the stage, had been inserted. They were particularly frustrated in trying to write for Julia, whom Rebeck had based on herself and consequently would not allow to have any difficulties. Later in the season, they were hoping that Greenblatt would win some of their fights. "You know it's bad when ''our last hope was the network''," one told ''BuzzFeed''. However, many of them said the show's own problems were not entirely Rebeck's fault, since Greenblatt also intervened in things like costume design and Spielberg was not informed of the conflicts until near the end.&lt;ref name="Buzzfeed story" /&gt;

After she left the show, Rebeck, who, citing confidentiality requirements, did not respond to the ''BuzzFeed'' story at first other than to say she "was treated quite badly",&lt;ref name="Buzzfeed story" /&gt; spoke at some length to ''[[The New York Observer]]'' about ''Smash'':
{{quote|One of the points of contention last year was that the network thinks they have the right to say to the writer of the show, "We don't want her to do this. We want her to do this ... And I would sometimes say back to them, "She would never do that." And they'd look at me like I was crazy, and I'd be like, "Nope, it's not crazy, it's just who the character is." You have to respect who the character is. It has its own internal truth and you can't betray that. And if you don't betray that, it will not betray you. There is this sort of sense that if you don't fuck with the muse—if you don't fuck with the muse, the muse will stand by you ...  It turns into bigger questions about power and art, power and storytelling. Is power itself bigger than storytelling? And I would say no.&lt;ref name="NY Observer Rebeck interview"&gt;{{cite news|last=D'Addario|first=Daniel|title=Rebeck Redux: Smushed by ''Smash'', Playwright Bounces Back With Katie Holmes-Starring Play|url=http://observer.com/2012/11/rebeck-redux-smushed-by-smash-playwright-bounces-back-with-katie-holmes-starring-play/?show=all|newspaper=[[The New York Observer]]|date=November 27, 2012|accessdate=March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Following the show's cancellation, Kate Aurthur, the writer of the ''BuzzFeed'' story, reposted an email exchange she had with Rebeck. Pointing to the show's decline in ratings during its second season, Rebeck asked, "If in fact [I] was the problem with [the show], wouldn't things have gotten better—rather than dramatically worse—once [I] left?" She accused Aurthur of relying on a single unnamed source and asked that the story, which she called "wildly untrue", be taken down.&lt;ref name="BuzzFeed Rebeck exchange post"&gt;{{cite web|last=Aurthur|first=Kate|title="Smash" Creator Theresa Rebeck Emailed Me|publisher=[[BuzzFeed]]|date=April 30, 2013|accessdate=May 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Original Broadway production===

During production of the show, executive producer Craig Zadan said: "We stand on the set, watch the ''Bombshell'' numbers and say, "Wouldn't this be great on Broadway? And so far that's where we've left it. Our priority now is producing a great TV show".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/smash-producers-musical-hit-broadway-article-1.1234794&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015 following the sold-out performance at the Minskoff Theatre, it was announced that "Bombshell" would head to the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stage. The executive producers of "Smash" and the "Bombshell" concert [[Neil Meron]] and [[Craig Zadan]] are set to executive produce the Broadway production. No timeline for the show has been announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/smash-musical-bombshell-headed-to-the-stage-351824|title="Smash" Musical Bombshell Headed to the Stage|work=Playbill|accessdate=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
The pilot of ''Smash'' received positive reviews from television critics, but the critical response was less positive as the season progressed.

Review aggregator ''[[Metacritic]]'', which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 of reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 79 based on 32 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/smash|title=Smash - Season 1|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maureen Ryan of ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' called it one of the strongest new shows of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryan |first=Maureen |url=http://www.aoltv.com/2011/11/21/smash-nbc-exclusive-first-look-katharine-mcphee/ |title='Smash' Exclusive First Look: Is This the Show That Will Save NBC? |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=November 21, 2011 |accessdate=February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Huffington Post'' writer Karen Ocamb praised the writing and the creativity of the series.&lt;ref name="huffington"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ocamb |first=Karen |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karen-ocamb/nbc-smash_b_1206829.html |title=Karen Ocamb: NBC's Smash Is a Musical About Creativity and the Drama of Big Dreams |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=January 17, 2012 |accessdate=February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary McNamara of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called the show a "triumph" and also went on to say that the creator Theresa Rebeck as well as her team, "have managed to capture the grand and sweeping gesture that is musical theater and inject it with the immediate intimacy of television."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McNamara |first=Mary |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-smash-review-20120206,0,1017618.story |title=Television review: 'Smash' on NBC NBC's new series featuring Debra Messing and 'American Idol' runner-up Katharine McPhee lovingly examines Broadway's travails and triumphs |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=February 6, 2012 |accessdate=February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Wiegand]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' gave the program a rave review: "[It's so] good you can't help wondering why no one thought of it before, a compelling mix of credible real-life melodrama with a fictionalized approximation of what it takes to get a Broadway show from the idea stage to opening night."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=David Wiegand |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2012/01/31/DDH91N0FKL.DTL |title='Smash' review: NBC series lives up to title |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=February 1, 2012 |accessdate=March 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Goodman from ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' called the pilot episode "Excellent, a bar-raiser for broadcast networks", and superior to ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''.&lt;ref name="thr"&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodman |first=Tim |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/smash-tv-review-katharine-mcphee-debra-messing-286296 |title=Smash: TV Review |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=February 2, 2012 |accessdate=February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also praised writing and acting for the series, comparing it to the quality of a [[Cable television|cable television series]].&lt;ref name="thr"/&gt; Matt Mitovich of [[TVLine]] called the cast "pretty damn perfect" and complimented the musical numbers.&lt;ref name="tvline"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mitovich, Matt |url=http://www.tvline.com/2011/12/tv-review-smash-nbc/ |title=Winter TV First Impression: Does NBC's Smash Hit All the Right Notes? |publisher=[[TVLine]] |date=December 29, 2011 |accessdate=February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Bianco of ''[[USA Today]]'' gave the show three and a half out of four stars and wrote, "Unless you're allergic to musicals in general and Broadway in particular, you should find that a compelling central story, a strong cast, an out-of-the-procedural-mold premise and some rousing, roof-raising numbers more than compensate for any lingering problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/reviews/story/2012-02-05/NBCs-Smash-review/52974100/1 |title='Smash' pulls out all the entertainment stops and succeeds |work=[[USA Today]] |date=February 6, 2012 |accessdate=March 27, 2012 |last=Bianco |first=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanner Stransky of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' ranked the pilot episode as the 8th best television episode of 2012 saying, "After we watched the subsequent 14 episodes of ''Smash'' with a mixture of fascination and dismay (seriously, did Debra Messing's Julia wear a men's pajama top to meet her lover?), it was difficult to recall that the pilot was positively magical. But it was. In fact, that episode-ending performance of 'Let Me Be Your Star' (featuring dueling divas Megan Hilty and Katharine McPhee) was among TV's most watchable and gleeful three minutes of the year. Rare is the series whose high-water mark is its pilot, and Smash is a shining example."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/12/31/best-and-worst-tv-episodes-2012/ |title=Best &amp; Worst of 2012: 10 great and 5 not-so-great episodes |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=December 31, 2012 |accessdate=January 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Harnick of ''The Huffington Post'' wrote, "How has the rest of Season 1 been so far? Not so phenomenal. That's not to say it has been downright terrible—there have been some highly entertaining moments—but it certainly hasn't been goosebumps-inducing, like the final moments of Episode 1, set to '[[Let Me Be Your Star]].'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-harnick/smash-season-2-nbc_b_1375703.html |title='Smash': Season 2 Can Win Me Back If... |newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]] |last=Harnick |first=Chris |date=March 26, 2012 |accessdate=March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin Fallon summed up the response in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', writing that "there's been an almost visceral reaction to how rapidly and sharply the show's quality has dipped, and just how much promise ''Smash'' has thwarted...In other words: It's ''bad.''" Fallon cites other critics in demonstrating the general acceptance of this opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/04/the-tv-musical-is-dead/255643/ |title=The TV Musical is Dead |work=[[The Atlantic]] |date=April 10, 2012 |accessdate=April 10, 2012 |last=Fallon |first=Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Season 2, Smash was scheduled for Tuesdays at 10 at mid-season starting February 5, behind the low-rated The New Normal and several weeks before the new season of ''The Voice'' premiered, and the ratings cratered, with the February 5, 2013 2-hour 2-episode season premiere getting a 1.2 rating in the 18-49 demo. The ratings slid further to 0.9 for the 3rd episode and stayed around that number through the sixth episode, when NBC announced it was moving Smash to Saturdays as of April 6, 2013 and changing up its Tuesday lineup to put its dating reality show ''[[Ready for Love (TV series)|Ready for Love]]'' behind ''The Voice''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/03/nbcs-smash-to-move-to-saturday-go-on-to-thursday-apprentice-expands/ |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=March 13, 2013 |title=NBC's 'Smash' To Move To Saturday, 'Go On' To Thursday, 'Ready For Love' To Tuesday |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |accessdate=March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, ''The Lizzie Bennet Diaries'' became the first web series to win an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]], for Outstanding Creative Achievement In Interactive Media – Original Interactive Program.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Format==
The story is told in [[vlog]]-style by the [[eponymous]] character; each episode is between two and eight minutes long.&lt;ref&gt;The shortest episode, ''The Charming Mr. Lee'' (episode 11), lasts 2 minutes and 41 seconds. The longest, ''An Understanding'' (episode 87), lasts 8 minutes and 12 seconds.&lt;/ref&gt; As the show primarily takes place in Lizzie's bedroom, many major events happen offscreen and are retold by Lizzie, with her friend Charlotte and sisters Lydia and Jane adding different perspectives. Occasionally they perform reenactments, using a recurring costume to denote who's who (such as a cap and bowtie for Darcy, a blue plaid shirt for Lizzie, etc.). From Episode 25 onwards, the show begins to visit other sets, allowing them to introduce outside characters, such as Bing Lee, Caroline, and Mr. Collins.

There are also semi-frequent Q&amp;A videos, once per every ten episodes, in which Lizzie answers questions asked by real viewers, sometimes with the help of another character. In addition to the videos, all the characters also have various social media accounts, through which they interact and reveal portions of the story and perspectives that are not necessarily represented in Lizzie's vlogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lizziebennet.com/story/|work=The Lizzie Bennet Diaries|title= The Full Story|publisher=LizzieBennet.com|accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Elizabeth "Lizzie" Bennet is a [[mass communications]] graduate student still living at home with her parents and two sisters, the sweet, timid Jane and rebellious, party-loving Lydia. With the help of her friend Charlotte Lu, she starts a vlog series for her thesis, discussing the trials and tribulations of her daily life. Wealthy medical student Bing Lee moves into the Netherfield mansion nearby, bringing with him his even richer friend William Darcy. Mrs Bennet quickly begins conspiring to match Bing up with one of the girls, believing "it's a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife." When the Bennets finally meet the new neighbors at a wedding, Jane and Bing instantly have chemistry, but Darcy's rude and snobbish behaviour causes Lizzie to dislike him.

At [[VidCon]], Charlotte and Lizzie run into childhood friend Ricky Collins, who now runs online media company "Collins and Collins," with the help of his wealthy patron Ms Catherine de Bourgh. He proposes Lizzie join him as a business partner, but she declines. Charlotte accepts the offer in her place. During this time Lydia starts her own vlog series.

While at a bar with Lydia, Lizzie meets swim coach George Wickham and begins seeing him. He reveals Darcy was a family friend who supposedly refused to give him a college fund he was promised, furthering Lizzie's poor opinion of the man. Lizzie quickly moves on when it becomes apparent George isn't that into her. Though their relationship had been going well, Bing suddenly leaves for L.A. without telling Jane. Lizzie assumes Darcy must have poisoned Bing's opinion of her sister.

Lizzie decides to spend her last semester shadowing at companies, starting with C&amp;C. There she runs into Darcy, who's been asked to monitor the company by his aunt, Catherine. He confronts Lizzie and reveals he's in love with her. She furiously tells him she could never love him back, because of his rudeness and how he's hurt George and Jane, accidentally revealing the existence of the vlogs in the process.

After watching them all, he gives her a letter explaining his side of things. He steered Bing away from Jane because he thought she was only being nice. George was given enough money to pay his full college tuition, but spent it all in one year and then became angry when Darcy refused to give him more.

Lydia misinterprets one of Lizzie's 21st birthday presents and storms off to Las Vegas for New Years, and eventually begins dating George Wickham.

Lizzie discovers the final company she's to visit, Pemberley Digital, belongs to Darcy. They begin spending time together, now on better terms, but their growing friendship is cut short when Lizzie has to rush home, having been informed there's a website counting down to the release of a sex tape involving George and Lydia. Lizzie and Lydia haven't spoken since Christmas.  When Lizzie confronts Lydia, it transpires Lydia didn't know about the website.

Jane urges Lizzie to watch all of Lydia's videos, after which Lizzie realizes her younger sister isn't as shallow as she thought and that she doesn't really know Lydia all that well. Lydia herself realizes she's been selfish and breaks down crying in Lizzie's arms and the two sisters reconcile.  The day the sex-tape is meant to go live, the website disappears.

During her healing journey, Lydia discovers that Darcy has bought the company that owns the website and all rights to the video. Lizzie realizes she loves him, but thinks it's come too late. Bing returns to apologize; he discovered Lizzie's vlogs and saw how much Jane cared about him in them, and the two get back together. Darcy confesses to Lizzie that he still loves her, and the two finally get together. Lizzie decides what to do in her professional life and decides to stop vlogging so she can focus on actually living her life.

==Characters==
*'''Elizabeth "Lizzie" Bennet''' ([[Ashley Clements]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lizziebennet.com/cast/ashley-clements/|work=The Lizzie Bennet Diaries | title= Ashley Clements|accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Pride and Prejudice#Elizabeth Bennet|Elizabeth Bennet]]'' in the novel) is the middle Bennet sister and the narrator of most of the vlogs. She is a graduate student studying [[mass communications]] and, like her original counterpart, believes women should be highly educated and do more with their lives than simply pursue husbands. She is very close with her best friend, Charlotte Lu, who was born on the same day as she, as well as her older sister, Jane, while appearing to have a more strained relationship with her younger sister, Lydia. While it is clear that she cares for her family and friends, she can also be fairly prejudiced and quick to judge people who she perceives as condescending or a threat to her way of life, such as Darcy and, at first, Bing Lee.
*'''Charlotte Lu''' (Julia Cho;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lizziebennet.com/cast/julia-cho/|work=The Lizzie Bennet Diaries | title= Julia Cho|accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Pride and Prejudice#Charlotte Lucas|Charlotte Lucas]]'' in the novel) is Lizzie's best friend and often the director/editor of her vlog. Charlotte wants to be a [[filmmaker]] and convinced Lizzie to start her vlog as part of a school project. While the original character of Charlotte Lucas from the books is a minor character, Lu's role in ''The Lizzie Bennet Diaries'' has been greatly expanded; she appears in many of the beginning episodes, and, according to both Lizzie and Jane, practically lives at the Bennet house. Charlotte and Lizzie have a falling-out after Charlotte accepts Ricky Collins' job offer (which Lizzie originally turned down), but the two soon reconcile.
*'''Jane Bennet''' ([[Laura Spencer (actor)|Laura Spencer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lizziebennet.com/cast/laura-spencer/|work=The Lizzie Bennet Diaries | title= Laura Spencer|accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the eldest of the Bennet children, and an overworked, underpaid merchandise coordinator in the fashion world. She is incredibly polite, sweet and, according to Lizzie, "practically perfect in every way."&lt;ref name=LBD2&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lizziebennet.com/episode-2-my-sisters-problematic-to-practically-perfect/ | work = The Lizzie Bennet Diaries | title = Episode 2: My Sisters – Problematic to Practically Perfect | accessdate = 2013-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Bing Lee moves into town, Jane is immediately smitten with him, much to the absolute joy of her mother. Jane is devastated by Bing's sudden departure. She moves to Los Angeles for both a new job and the hope of reconnecting with Bing. She later returns to her home to support her sister Lydia through her difficulties. After this is resolved, Jane is offered a new job in New York City and reconciles with Bing.
*'''Lydia Britney Bennet''' ([[Mary Kate Wiles]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lizziebennet.com/cast/mary-kate-wiles/|work=The Lizzie Bennet Diaries | title= Mary Kate Wiles|accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the youngest Bennet child, currently attending [[community college]]. She is "feisty, energetic, and unapologetic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lizziebennet.com/characters/lydia-bennet/|work=The Lizzie Bennet Diaries | title= Lydia Bennet|accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lizzie, somewhat less kindly, describes her as "too old to be on any [[Reality TV|reality shows]] about having babies in high school."&lt;ref name=LBD2/&gt;  She has also created a series of her own videos starring herself, her cousin Mary, and her cat, Kitty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/TheLydiaBennet/|title=The Lydia Bennet|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=July 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the occasion of her 21st birthday in December 2012, she and Lizzie get into a bitter argument about Lydia's perceived immaturity, and Lydia makes plans to vacation in Las Vegas for New Year's Eve, where she meets George Wickham and begins dating. Later, after being the victim of George Wickham's money-making site, she makes up with her sisters.
*'''Bing Lee''' ([[Christopher Sean]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lizziebennet.com/cast/christopher-sean/|work=The Lizzie Bennet Diaries | title= Christopher Sean|accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Pride and Prejudice#Charles Bingley|Charles Bingley]]'' in the novel) is a young, wealthy Asian-American medical student who has moved into The Netherfield House in the same neighborhood as the Bennets. He quickly falls for Jane Bennet and begins to date her. Bing abruptly leaves Netherfield and Jane by returning to Los Angeles, breaking Jane's heart, after Darcy suggests that Jane is only engaging in a relationship with him for his money and Caroline tells him that Jane flirted with another guy at his birthday party. However, after a run-in with Lizzie during her time at Pemberley Digital, he makes a return, having quit medical school to pursue his own passions. He and Jane move to New York together in episode 92.
*'''Caroline Lee''' (Jessica Jade Andres;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lizziebennet.com/cast/jessica-jade-andres/|work=The Lizzie Bennet Diaries | title= Jessica Jade Andres|accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Pride and Prejudice#Caroline Bingley|Caroline Bingley]]'' in the novel) is Bing Lee's sister. She is aware of Lizzie's vlog diaries and appears to help Lizzie keep Bing and Darcy from discovering them during Lizzie and Jane's stay at Netherfield. She has a romantic interest in William Darcy, although her feelings aren't reciprocated. She is later revealed to have attempted to manipulate events to keep Bing and Jane apart, as well as (to a lesser extent) stymie Darcy's feelings for Lizzie. Caroline reappears in ''Emma Approved'' as Senator James Elton's fiancé, replacing Augusta Elton, the original wife of Philip Elton, from the novel.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgw0iGxdcyk|title=Karma is a ... – Emma Approved Ep: 41|date=31 March 2014|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Ricky Collins''' (Maxwell Glick;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lizziebennet.com/cast/maxwell-glick/|work=The Lizzie Bennet Diaries | title= Maxwell Glick|accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Mr. Collins|William Collins]]'' in the novel) is a former classmate of Lizzie and Charlotte's, who asks that he be addressed only as Mr. Collins. He has formed an alliance with [[venture capitalist]] Catherine de Bourgh,  to attempt a foray into the world of web video. Mr. Collins frequently visits the Bennets while in town for a few weeks and, near the end of his stay, offers Lizzie a lucrative job at his company, Collins and Collins. Lizzie turns him down, so he offers the job to Charlotte, who accepts. This decision causes a brief but bitter argument between the two best friends, but they reconcile after Charlotte invites Lizzie to visit Collins &amp; Collins (in the fictional town of Hunsford, California), where Lizzie also learns to tolerate Mr. Collins.
*'''William Darcy''' ([[Daniel Vincent Gordh]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lizziebennet.com/cast/daniel-gordh/|work=The Lizzie Bennet Diaries | title= Daniel Vincent Gordh|accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Fitzwilliam Darcy]]'' in the novel) is Bing Lee's best friend and the wealthy heir to an entertainment corporation called Pemberley Digital. He stays with Bing and Caroline at Netherfield until they all leave for Los Angeles. He first meets Lizzie at a wedding, and she overheard him telling Bing that she was "decent enough", which is when her dislike towards him starts. He is described by Lizzie as a snobby and condescending robot, and Jane has difficulty coming up with a flattering descriptor of him, beyond "tall";&lt;ref name=LBD12&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lizziebennet.com/episode-12-jane-chimes-in/ | work = The Lizzie Bennet Diaries | title = Episode 12: Jane Chimes In | accessdate = 2013-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Charlotte, however, believes that Darcy has a crush on Lizzie.&lt;ref name=LBD15&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lizziebennet.com/episode-15-lizzie-bennet-is-in-denial/ | work = The Lizzie Bennet Diaries | title = Episode 15: Lizzie Bennet is in Denial | accessdate = 2013-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For a long time, second-hand characterization is all the audience has to go by, as Darcy is referred to but never seen, making his first appearance in episodes 59&lt;ref name=LBD59&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lizziebennet.com/episode-59-staff-spirit/ | work = The Lizzie Bennet Diaries | title = Episode 59: Staff Spirit | accessdate = 2013-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (only from the neck down) and 60,&lt;ref name=LBD60&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lizziebennet.com/episode-60-are-you-kidding-me/ | work = The Lizzie Bennet Diaries | title = Episode 60: Are you kidding me! | accessdate = 2013-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he confirms Charlotte's suspicions by confessing his love for Lizzie.
*'''[[George Wickham]]''' (Wes Aderhold&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lizziebennet.com/cast/wes-aderhold/|work=The Lizzie Bennet Diaries | title= Wes Aderhold|accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the coach of a university swim team who forms a short-lived romantic attachment with Lizzie.  He claims that though he and Darcy were childhood friends, Darcy ruined his life by withholding money Darcy's father had promised, thereby ending George's hopes of a college education.&lt;ref name=LBD45&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lizziebennet.com/episode-45-wickham-story-time/ | work = The Lizzie Bennet Diaries | title = Episode 45: Wickham Story Time | accessdate = 2013-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He leaves town for work, eventually re-entering the story after New Year's Day, where he meets and becomes romantically involved with Lydia, as chronicled in her spin-off videos.  At the same time, Lizzie learns that George gambled away all the money the elder Darcy left for him, and then took advantage of Gigi Darcy, William's sister, for more. Finally, he attempts to exploit "YouTube Star Lydia Bennet" by releasing a sex tape of the two of them online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lydiabennettape.com | title = &lt;Default Title&gt; | quote = We're sorry. Due to reasons beyond our control, we are no longer able to offer this product. | postscript = : }} The website consists of a single page with the quoted message and a "NE" logo&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Fitz Williams''' (Craig Frank;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lizziebennet.com/cast/craig-frank/|work=The Lizzie Bennet Diaries | title= Craig Frank|accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Col. Fitzwilliam'' in the novel) is Darcy's friend and colleague. Lizzie meets him while dining with Catherine de Bourgh, Darcy's aunt and Charlotte's boss. He has a boyfriend, Brandon, whose name was officially confirmed on Fitz's Twitter, and is particularly good at making [[CARE Package|care-packages]].
*'''Georgiana "Gigi" Darcy''' (Allison Paige;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lizziebennet.com/cast/allison-paige/|work=The Lizzie Bennet Diaries | title= Allison Paige|accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Pride and Prejudice#Georgiana Darcy|Georgiana Darcy]]'' in the novel) is William Darcy's younger sister and a graphic designer at Pemberley Digital. Her first appearance in The Lizzie Bennet Diaries was Episode 77. She is aware of the video diaries, and claims to like them. She and George Wickham were romantically involved, but this ended when William proved that George was taking advantage of her for the money. Twitter posts between Gigi and Fitz suggest that she actively tries to push Lizzie and Darcy together.  She is also instrumental in helping to end George's money-making plot: though the website itself did not list his name and George had stopped returning calls, he answers Gigi when she calls him, allowing Fitz and Darcy to track him down.  Thereafter Darcy bought out the company which owned the rights to the sex tape, preventing it from ever being released.
*'''Mrs. Bennet''' is Lizzie's mother. She appears to be a traditional Southern woman, eager to see her daughters married and interested in little else besides neighborhood gossip. She is almost always impersonated by Lizzie.
*'''[[Mr Bennet|Mr. Bennet]]''' is Lizzie's father. He appears more calm and levelheaded than his wife, though one of his favorite activities, according to Lizzie, is winding her up.&lt;ref name=LBD3&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lizziebennet.com/episode-3-my-parents-opposingly-supportive/ | work = The Lizzie Bennet Diaries | title = Episode 3 – My Parents: Opposingly Supportive | accessdate = 2013-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a special fondness for bonsai trees and prepares a train extravaganza every Christmas. He is often impersonated by Charlotte and Lydia.
*'''Catherine de Bourgh''' (''[[Lady Catherine de Bourgh (character)|Lady Catherine de Bourgh]]'' in the novel) is Darcy's aunt and an extremely wealthy venture capitalist who is the primary investor in Collins &amp; Collins, the new media firm run by Mr. Collins, where Charlotte accepts a job offer after Lizzie rejected it. Catherine is very attached to her sickly dog who she calls Annie Kins. She is quick with her opinions and judgements. Charlotte said that Catherine is "on Team Caroline," meaning that she wants her nephew to be with Caroline. She is impersonated by Lizzie, and Ashley Clements says her impression is a combination of [[Julia Child]], [[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|Miranda Priestly]] and [[Dolores Umbridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://theashleyclements.tumblr.com/post/33383391530/is-catherine-modeled-on-anyone-in-particular | title = Is Catherine modeled on anyone in particular? | work = Ashley Clements | publisher = Tumblr }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Mary Bennet''' ([[Briana Cuoco]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lizziebennet.com/cast/briana-cuoco/|work=The Lizzie Bennet Diaries | title= Briana Cuoco|accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is Lydia, Jane, and Lizzie's cousin who has appeared sporadically in Lydia's vlogs and once in Lizzie's. She becomes better friends and occasional tutor with Lydia while Lydia is staying at her house despite their opposing personalities. She is often the "forgotten" character and her Twitter reads, "I am Mary, never forgotten." Mary also has a boyfriend by the name of Eddie (a subtle nod to the character of Edmund Bertram from Austen's ''[[Mansfield Park]]''.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rachelkiley.tumblr.com/post/28587637085/eddie-was-actually-a-reference-to-mansfield|title="Eddie" was actually a reference to Mansfield...|work=tumblr.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the novel, she is actually one of the five Bennet sisters, being the middle sister between Elizabeth and Kitty.
*'''Kitty Bennet''' (Rosie of House Wiles) is Lydia's cat who appears in Lydia's vlogs. In the novel, she is actually one of the five Bennet sisters, being the second youngest after Lydia.

==Spin-offs==
In addition to Lizzie's vlogging, other characters also released videos which provided access to alternate perspectives and story elements.

===The Lydia Bennet===
Lydia decides to start her own vlog series while Lizzie is away.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|2276512|The Lydia Bennet!!}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|u=TheLydiaBennet|title=The Lydia Bennet}}&lt;/ref&gt; As its main purpose is to show Lydia's story arc when she can't appear on the main webshow, it's only ever maintained when she and Lizzie are apart, such as when Lizzie is staying at Netherfield or visiting companies. It allows the audience to witness things like Lydia becoming friends with her cousin Mary, running away to LA to see her sister Jane, meeting George Wickham in Las Vegas on New Year's Eve, and having a relationship with him. Unlike the main webshow, Lydia's vlogs are not stationary, are all one single continuous take (presumably as Lydia would consider learning how to edit a nerdy thing to do), and rarely ever set in the same place twice.

===Maria of the Lu===
After beginning her job at Collins and Collins, Charlotte gets her younger sister Maria Lu a summer internship, who documents the experience in a series of video diaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|2398576|Maria of the Lu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|u=MariaOfTheLu|title=Maria Lu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collins and Collins===
Mr. Collins's company produces instructional videos called "Better Living with Collins and Collins." Currently, there are eight episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|u=CollinsandCollins|title=CollinsandCollins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pemberley Digital===
Hosted by Darcy's younger sister Gigi, Pemberley Digital posts demo videos to unveil and promote their new prototype: "Domino," an application that can automatically edit and upload videos recorded on it.&lt;ref name=PEM3&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lizziebennet.com/domino-episode-3-tracking/ | work = The Lizzie Bennet Diaries | title = Domino: Episode 3 – Tracking | accessdate = 2013-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This premise allows the audience to see Darcy and Gigi's efforts to track down George Wickham and get his website taken down, before he releases a sex tape he filmed involving Lydia.

==Sequels==

===''Welcome to Sanditon''===
Taking place after the events of ''The Lizzie Bennet Diaries'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgOlD8TImVB4xalJTiO6eqQ|title=Pemberley Digital|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Welcome to Sanditon'' follows Gigi Darcy as she spends her summer in Sanditon, CA to run a beta demo of the Pemberley Digital Domino application. The residents of Sanditon have all been invited to join in the test, and discover how this “life-revealing” app performs.

The mini-series is a modernized adaptation of Jane Austen's unfinished novel, ''[[Sanditon]]''. One notable difference from the source material is Gigi replaces the unfinished novel's original heroine, Charlotte Heywood (as ''Sanditon'' is actually not connected to ''Pride and Prejudice'' in any way).

===''Emma Approved''===
Taking place after the events of ''Welcome to Sanditon'', ''[[Emma Approved]]'' focuses on Emma Woodhouse, a confident and proud female entrepreneur who believes she is an excellent matchmaker.&lt;ref name="tubefilter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2013/08/02/emma-approved-bernie-su-jane-austen-lizzie-bennet-diaries/|title='Lizzie Bennet Diaries' Team Will Take On Jane Austen's 'Emma' Next|work=Tubefilter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series is a modernized adaptation of Jane Austen's novel, ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]''.&lt;ref name="tubefilter" /&gt; One notable difference from the source material is Caroline Lee replaces Augusta Hawkins as Philip Elton's wife (as ''Emma'' is actually not connected to ''Pride and Prejudice'' in any way).&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;

===''The Epic Adventures of Lydia Bennet''===
''The Epic Adventures of Lydia Bennet'' is a book by Kate Rorick and Rachel Kiley, and audiobook with Mary Kate Wiles performing all the voices, telling Lydia's story from a few months after TLBD for about a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rorick|first1=Kate|last2=Kiley|first2=Rachel|title=The Epic Adventures of Lydia Bennet|date=2015|publisher=Touchstone|location=New York|isbn=9781476763231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''[[The Guardian]]'' called ''The Lizzie Bennet Diaries'' "the best Austen adaptation around" at the 200th anniversary of ''Pride and Prejudice''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pride and Prejudice at 200: the best Jane Austen small-screen adaptations |first=Kaite |last=Welsh |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/jan/28/youtube-austen-pride-and-prejudice |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=28 January 2013 |accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 it was announced that ''The Lizzie Bennet Diaries'' will be awarded an award for Original Interactive Program at the Creative Arts Emmys, becoming the first digital series to win an Emmy Award.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/blogs/emmys/-top-chef--s--last-chance-kitchen----oprah-s-lifeclass---the-nick-app--and--the-lizzie-bennet-diaries--to-receive-interactive-media-emmys-151953269.html|title='Top Chef's' 'Last Chance Kitchen,' 'Oprah's Lifeclass,' the Nick App, and 'The Lizzie Bennet Diaries' to Receive Interactive Media Emmys|date=22 August 2013|work=yahoo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''University of Psychogenic Fugue''''', sometimes abbreviated to '''''UPF''''', is a satirical humor book in the form of a [[parody]] college course catalog for a fictional American [[University]] written by Tye R Farrell and Jeffrey Morrow. It was published by Meteorite Press in 2002. Its subtitle is '''''A Course Catalog for Students of Life'''''.

The book dryly satirizes the 21st century college experience and the foibles of modern life through hundreds of "classes" in 15 "departments" of study, including Glamour, Suburban Science, Life Science, and Love. In addition, the book describes fictional [[scholarships]], grants, university buildings, and meaingless complex policies. There are also numerous campus clubs, [[fraternities and sororities]], including Gamma Lambda Ding Dong and Eradicate Ugliness Worldwide. The book's sometimes cynical humor has been described as similar to ''[[The Onion]].''

The University's name comes from a psychological condition, [[psychogenic fugue]], in which a person is unable to remember his or her past. The term psychogenic fugue was recategorized as [[dissociative fugue]] so now (according to the authors) it is a state of mind that doesn't exist. This attitude reflects many of the mock course offerings you're not likely to encounter in traditional [[higher education]], including:

* Glamour 106: Build a Better Supermodel
* Business 112: Advanced Drug Dealing
* Life Science 599: Postmodern Coffee
* Love 214: Valentine's Day Sabotage
* Suburban Science 244: How to be a Carnie
* Culinary Arts 105: Living Without Food
* Generally Accepted Science 131: Cadaver Farming
* Ethics 102: Living a Lie II
* Communications 121: Calling in Sick

The book received a number of humor and culture awards. Its format has drawn attention from diverse sources, from the [[Chronicle of Higher Education]] to counterculture magazine ''[[High Times]]'', as well as college and [[internet]] press.

UPF also hosts an online satirical counterpart where web surfers can learn more about the University and its programs of study.

'''Halo Halo Radio''' is a brand name for Viva's radio stations. It was launched as '''Oomph! Radio''' before the end of 2014 following the acquisition of Ultimate Entertainment and its FM stations (but spun-off its concert/theatrical production arm and became Ultimate Shows, which remained owned by the Manalang family), thus it is Viva's new venture into radio broadcasting. Its format playlist consisted of local and international songs.

In May 2016, Viva Live briefly dropped the Oomph! Radio brand and went to an independent branding among stations by adding 70s, 80s and 90s music to its playlist, despite retaining its format and the Ultimate Radio name. In July 2016, however, Viva Live brought back the Oomph! Radio brand and its Top 40/OPM format. In February 2017, the Oomph! Radio brand was dropped permanently due to management decision.

In May 2017, Oomph! Radio was relaunched as Halo Halo Radio, an all-OPM station. With this launch, Halo Halo Radio became the ''de facto'' provincial counterpart of Manila-based [[DWDM-FM|Pinas FM 95.5]] (a radio station of [[Iglesia ni Cristo]]'s for-profit broadcast arm [[Eagle Broadcasting Corporation]]), the country's first all OPM radio station.

{{coord|37.818209|N|97.321229|W|display=title}}

'''Wild West World''' was a [[Wild West]] theme park in [[Park City, Kansas]] that opened on May 5, 2007 and closed on July 9, 2007. It was located on {{convert|130|acre|ha}} along [[Interstate 135]] near [[Phil Ruffin]]'s Wichita Greyhound Park, which closed the same year.

==History==
The park was owned, developed, and operated by Thomas and Cheryl Etheredge doing business as Wild West World, LLC and Restoration Farms, Inc.  They also owned the Prairie Rose Chuck Wagon entertainment venue in [[Butler County, Kansas|Butler County]].

The announcement for the park appeared in the ''[[Wichita Eagle]]'' on December 19, 2004. Groundbreaking began on August 15, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wildwestworld.net/newsarticles.htm#na8&lt;/ref&gt; It was billed as the only all-western theme park in the world, and the first major one in [[Kansas]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.a2mediagroup.com/?c=146&amp;a=13412&lt;/ref&gt; The claim to being the only all-western one is a mere technicality because [[Frontier City]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontiercity.com Welcome to Frontier City!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]], has one non-western-themed ride (Mindbender) in an otherwise western-themed park.  According to the ''Hutchinson News'' the rides were off-the-shelf [[Traveling carnival|carnival]] attractions dressed up in a western facade. {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

==Closure==
On July 9, 2007, barely two months after the park opened, the owners filed for [[bankruptcy]] and closed it down. They cited lagging attendance and bad weather as the main factors for the decision, but experts also point to an inadequate business plan and a poor theming choice.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kansascity.com/657/story/185691.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Etheredges were also forced to close and sell the Prairie Rose Chuck Wagon. The park was for sale, and the owners publicly stated that they hoped to reopen it in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/8389667.html KAKE - HomePage&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, no sale materialized. The fixtures, equipment, and materials were auctioned by Bud Palmer Auctions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.budpalmerauctions.com/news,page,43,topic_id,content_pages Bud Palmer Auctions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  A few empty buildings are all that remain, but all remaining structures and landscaping were auctioned off November 6, 2010 so that the site could be bulldozed and prepared for future development.

==Securities Fraud==

On April 19, 2009, Thomas Etheredge was arrested on 10 counts of securities fraud related to investments in the park totaling $800,000, much of which was raised from the members of Wichita's Summit Church. The Summit Church split from Immanuel Baptist Church, where Etheredge had also been a member, when pastor Terry Fox resigned, and the new church congregated in the Johnny Western Theater on the park grounds during construction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/wichita/stories/2009/05/04/story5.html&lt;/ref&gt; After the park filed bankruptcy, it was learned that Etheredge had previously served three years in prison for securities fraud in another investment scheme. Etheredge was convicted on February 10, 2010 on 7 counts of securities fraud.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kansas.com/news/local/article1026992.html&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced on April 2 to five years in prison,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kansas.com/news/local/crime/article1028396.html&lt;/ref&gt; and paroled on July 29, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kansas.com/news/article1119561.html&lt;/ref&gt;
