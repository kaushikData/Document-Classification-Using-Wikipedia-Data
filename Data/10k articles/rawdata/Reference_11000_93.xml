It refers to the left faction in the [[culture wars]] in Western politics,{{original research inline|date=September 2018}} implying support of [[multiculturalism]],
[[political correctness]] and [[affirmative action|positive discrimination]]. In more than 400 answers submitted by ''[[Zhihu]]'' users during  2015 to May 2017, the term is defined as referring to 
those who are hypocritically "obsessed with political correctness" in order to "satisfy their own feeling of moral superiority" motivated from an "ignorant and arrogant" Western-centric worldview who "pity the rest of the world and think they are saviours". A related term is {{lang|pny|shèngmǔ}} ({{lang|zh|圣母}}, {{lang|zh|聖母}}, literally "holy mother", title for the mother of an emperor), a sarcastic reference to those whose political opinions are guided by emotions and a hypocritical show of selflessness and empathy, represented by celebrities such as [[J. K. Rowling]] and [[Emma Watson]].&lt;ref&gt;Chenchen Zhang: [https://www.opendemocracy.net/digitaliberties/chenchen-zhang/curious-rise-of-white-left-as-chinese-internet-insult The curious rise of the ‘white left’ as a Chinese internet insult], ''[[openDemocracy]]'', 11 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''baizuo'' was apparently coined in a 2010 article published on [[Renren|Renren Network]], entitled ''The Fake Morality of the Western White Left and the Chinese Patriotic Scientists'' ({{lang|zh|西方白左和中国爱国科学家的伪道德}}).
No further use of the term is known until 2013, with only isolated use during 2013&amp;ndash;2015.&lt;ref name=szhgh&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.szhgh.com/Article/wsds/culture/2017-12-10/155367.html|title=方可成：“白左”污名化与社会达尔文主义|date=2017-12-10|access-date=2018-06-06|author=方可成|website=红歌会网|language=zh-hans|dead-url=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180606173644/http://www.szhgh.com/Article/wsds/culture/2017-12-10/155367.html|archive-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Substantial use in Chinese internet culture begins in early 2016, at first at [[MIT BBS]], a  bulletin board system used by many Chinese in US, during the [[United States presidential election of 2016]].
Baizuo was here used to criticize to the policies of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] with regard to "minorities", perceived as granting advantages to African-Americans and Mexicans, but not Asians.&lt;ref name=szhgh/&gt;
English-language reception of the term begins in 2017, with a definition posted on [[Urban Dictionary]] in May of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yangqiu.cn/windsorfort/2913919.html|title=论白左|date=2017-06-21|access-date=2018-06-06|author=周方舟|website=杨邱自媒体|language=zh-hans|dead-url=no|archive-url=https://archive.today/20180606174632/http://www.yangqiu.cn/windsorfort/2913919.html|archive-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the United States presidential election, the term came to be more widely used, e.g.
in reference to the policies of [[Angela Merkel]] in the [[European migrant crisis]],&lt;ref name="Germany"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article170917663/Chinesen-verspotten-Merkel-als-naiven-weissen-Gutmenschen.html|title="Baizuo": Chinesen verspotten Merkel als Gutmensch|last=Graw|first=Ansgar|date=2017-11-23|work=DIE WELT|access-date=2017-12-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171128075643/https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article170917663/Chinesen-verspotten-Merkel-als-naiven-weissen-Gutmenschen.html|archivedate=2017-11-28|df=}}.

'''Bulgarian National [[Cinematheque|Film Archive]]''' ({{lang-bg|Българска Национална Филмотека}}) also known as Bulgarian [[Cinematheque]] is an organization formed to acquire, restore, preserve and store film and film related archival artefacts of the national and world culture. Since 1959 it is a Member of the [[International Federation of Film Archives]].&lt;ref&gt;http://bnf.bg/en/film_library/about_us/#international_statute international statute, Official site&lt;/ref&gt;

The head office of the Cinematheque is accommodated in an old [[Art Deco]]-style house located in the [[Sofia]] city center. The very archive is currently stored in several cities – [[Sofia]], [[Stara Zagora]] and [[Belogradchik]].
The main base where the film collection is held is located just nearby the [[Boyana Film]] Centre (Sofia suburb).

As a structure the institution is consist of Direction; Sector Administrative; Sector Film Collection; Sector Information, Repertoire and Programming and a small cinema hall named Odeon.&lt;ref&gt;http://bnf.bg/en/film_library/#structure BFA structure, Official site&lt;/ref&gt;

The logo of the Bulgarian National Film Archive was designed by [[Stefan Kanchev]], the "father of Bulgarian graphic design".&lt;ref&gt;http://stefankanchev.com/en/default.html Logos by Stefan Kanchev web gallery&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since the year of the making of the first Bulgarian feature film ''[[Bulgaran is Gallant]]'' is disputable
the exact date of foundation of the Film Archive also varies in the memories of the people who worked there. Howsoever it corresponds with the period when the first national film archives were established. For instance, it is reported that the first film archives are found during 1935 in [[London]] and [[New York City]] followed by the French one in 1936.

When the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|communist regime]] took the rule in the country, the Bulgarian film-making was nationalized.  Subsequently, in 1948 a National Film Museum was founded. Its beginnings were laid again by the pioneer of Bulgarian cinema [[Vasil Gendov]]. He collected the film-copies of the distribution net as well as of the nationalized distributors and also found and restored posters, photos and materials about our film-making history. The collection started with 154 newsreels, 117 short films, most of them shot by foreign cameramen, 15 Bulgarian feature films, 500 foreign feature films and about 550 Bulgarian documentaries and popular science films.&lt;br&gt;
The first official documents manifested the foundation of the Film Archive in 1952 as a part of the nationalized Bulgarian cinematography. The General department of archives in Bulgaria methodically guided the work of the Film Archive in those years.

In 1994, after the liberation, by Ordinance issued by the [[Government of Bulgaria|Council of Ministers]] is determined the status of the Bulgarian National Film Archive as cultural institution of national significance. Its range is directly under the [[Ministry of Culture (Bulgaria)|Ministry of Culture]].

==The Cinema Hall==
[[Image:OdeonCinemaSofia.jpg|thumb|right|330px|Odeon Cinema [[Sofia]] in 2010]]

Since it is typical for the film archive institutions to have in their structure small cinemas that screens particularly classic and [[Art film|art-house films]], the Bulgarian one has a cinema hall too. It is named "Odeon" and located in Sofia city center too, not far from the head office house.

Initially the cinema was opened in 1961 in the hall of the Arts and Culture Club at 108 [[Georgi Rakovski Street|Rakovski st]]. After some break the Film Archive rented Vlaikova Cinema hall in 1969 with consideration to convert it into specialized cinematheque cinema. Soon the screenings in this hall were ceased too, only to be continued at the newly opened Vitosha cinema. A year later the Film Archive got its own hall named Druzhba cinema. In 1991,  after the falling of the communist regime it was renamed "Odeon cinematheque cinema". Being a specialized cinema it organizes its program in cycles, arranges special weeks, foreign film reviews, celebrations of local and international artists.

The hall is housed on the ground floor in a seven-storeyed corner building. It is situated by one of the [[Sofia]] landmarks - the [[Patriarch Evtimiy Square]] with the monument of [[Patriarch Evtimiy of Bulgaria|Evtimiy of Tarnovo, Patriarch of Bulgaria]]. The place is also a popular meeting point for the residents of the city.

[[Ido (language)|Ido]] and [[Interlingua]] are two [[constructed language]]s created in the 20th century. Both have had some measure of success, but Interlingua has enjoyed greater diffusion and acceptance by public and private institutions—it is taught in many high schools and universities, for example. Ido is what is called ''schematic'' (easier to learn for speakers of very different languages), whereas Interlingua is what is called ''naturalistic'' (easier to understand for speakers of related languages).

== Neutrality of vocabulary ==
While both languages have a majority of Latin/Romance words in their lexicons, Ido has a somewhat larger number of Germanic and Slavic words, so it could be suggested that Ido is more internationally neutral.  Germanic and Slavic words in Interlingua are often Romanized. Compare English ''blockade'', German ''Blockade'', and Interlingua ''blocada''. When Interlingua adopts foreign words, however, they frequently retain their original form.  By comparison, almost all words in Ido take on characteristic Ido finals and orthographies. (Ido proper names have a greater degree of flexibility than other Ido words.)

Both languages make use of an objective procedure to identify international words for their lexicons. Interlingua’s procedure identifies a ''prototype'' that is common to the various forms of a word in its source languages, and its control languages are selected to increase the internationality of its vocabulary. Since their vocabularies are very similar, it is likely that both languages possess an internationality that extends beyond the Western language families.

Wordforms can enter the vocabulary of Interlingua by derivation from a small number of roots and affixes. Speakers who are familiar with these roots and affixes can understand words developed from them, a feature that facilitates learning for speakers of any language background.

== Orthography ==
Both languages use the Latin alphabet, but Ido orthography is such that based on the spelling of a word, you can pronounce it unambiguously. This is largely true of Interlingua as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="84814">An [[e-reader]], also known as an e-book reader, is a portable electronic device that is designed primarily for the purpose of reading [[e-book]]s and [[Periodical literature|periodicals]]. E-readers have a similar [[form factor (design)|form factor]] to a [[tablet computer|tablet]] and usually refers to devices that use [[electronic paper]] resulting in better screen readability, especially in bright sunlight, and longer battery life when compared to a tablet. An e-reader's battery will typically last for multiple weeks. In contrast to an e-reader, a tablet has a screen capable of higher refresh rates which make them more suitable for interaction such as playing a [[video game]] or watching a [[video clip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-20016818-37.html|title=Best Buy: iPad cutting into laptop sales|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of electronic-paper displays==
All electronic paper types offer lower power consumption and better sunlight contrast than LCDs. Some offer a backlight to allow for low-light reading. With the backlight turned off, all have a similar appearance to "ink on paper" and are readable in bright environments.

* '''[[E Ink#Commercial Display Products|E ink]]''': [[E Ink Corporation]]'s 1st generation technology, also known as E Ink Vizplex. Although "eInk" may be used to talk about all electronic paper displays, "eInk" and "E Ink" are trademarked by E Ink, which provides the majority of the electronic paper displays used in devices. 
* '''[[E Ink#E Ink Pearl|E Ink Pearl]]''': E Ink's 2nd generation technology, which has higher contrast and a greater number of different levels of gray than their earlier technology. A further revision of Pearl is [[E Ink#E Ink Mobius|'''Mobius''']], which uses flexible plastic in the display.
* '''[[E Ink#E Ink Triton|E Ink Triton]]''': E Ink's 3rd generation technology that featured the ability to show color in the display.
* '''[[E Ink#E Ink Carta|E Ink Carta]]''': E Ink's 4th generation technology, which has higher contrast and a greater number of different levels of gray than their earlier technology and the displays have a [[pixel density]] between 212 and 300 ppi.
* SiPix: A former competitor to E Ink, which had displays with almost instantaneous page turns. It was acquired by E Ink in December 2012.
* LG Flex: Electronic paper that allows for a flexible screen, that is still in development. With these displays, the user is able to bend the e-reader without damaging it and can fold it up to put in a pocket.

== Commercially available devices sold by maker or designer ==

Notes:

* '''Library DRM compatible''' – Can be used to borrow e-books from public libraries, e.g. the [[EPUB]] and/or [[PDF]] formats with [[Digital rights management|digital-rights-management]] (DRM) are supported.
*"microSDHC" is the most popular format for external memory cards. Devices which support a different card have that format listed.
*Listed are only products for which either the product itself or its company is notable, as shown by having a Wikipedia article (without notability notice).

{{main article|Java (programming language)}}

Java has strong IDE support, due not only to its historical and economic importance, but also due to a combination of reflection and static-typing making it well-suited for IDE support.
Some of the leading Java IDEs (such as IntelliJ and Eclipse) are also the basis for leading IDEs in other programming languages (e.g. for [[Python (programming language)|Python]], IntelliJ is rebranded as [[PyCharm]], and Eclipse has the [[PyDev]] plugin.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2452">A '''conceptual dictionary''' (also '''ideographic''' or '''ideological dictionary''') is a [[dictionary]] that groups [[word]]s by [[concept]] or [[semantics|semantic relation]] instead of arranging them in [[alphabetization|alphabetical order]].  Examples of conceptual dictionaries are [[picture dictionary|picture dictionaries]], [[thesaurus|thesauri]], and [[visual dictionary|visual dictionaries]]. Onelook.com and ''Diccionario Ideológico de la Lengua Española'' (for Spanish)&lt;ref name=Diccionario&gt;Casares Sánchez, Julio (ed.), ''Diccionario Ideológico de la Lengua Española'', Editorial Gustavo Gili, Barcelona, 1943.&lt;/ref&gt; are specific online and print examples.

This is also known as a [[reverse dictionary]]: a reference work that is organized by concepts, phrases, or the [[definition]]s of words. This is in contrast to a standard dictionary, in which words are indexed by the [[headword]]s, but similar in function to a [[thesaurus]], where one can look up a concept by some common, general word, and then find a list of near-[[synonym]]s of that word. (For example, in a thesaurus one could look up "doctor" and be presented with such words as healer, physician, surgeon, M.D., medical man, medicine man, academician, professor, scholar, sage, master, expert.)  In theory, a reverse dictionary might go further than this, allowing you to find a word by its definition only (for example, to find the word "doctor" knowing only that he is a "person who cures disease").  Such dictionaries have become more practical with the advent of [[computer]]ized information-storage and retrieval systems (i.e. computer databases).

An example of this type of reverse dictionary is the ''Diccionario Ideológico de la Lengua Española'' (Spanish Language Ideological Dictionary).&lt;ref name=Diccionario/&gt; This allows the user to find words based on a small set of general concepts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18692">{{History of Uganda}}In early August 1972, the [[President of Uganda]], [[Idi Amin]], ordered the expulsion of his country's [[Indians in Uganda|South Asian minority]], giving them 90 days to leave the country.&lt;ref name="BBC On This Day"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/7/newsid_2492000/2492333.stm|title=1972: Asians given 90 days to leave Uganda|last=|first=|date=7 August 1972|work=|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|via=|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the expulsion, there were approximately 80,000 individuals of South Asian descent (mostly [[Gujarati people|Gujaratis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/international/story/19790515-hopes-soar-among-ugandan-asians-as-idi-amin-dictatorial-regime-falls-822011-2014-02-28|title=Hopes soar among Ugandan Asians as Idi Amin's dictatorial regime falls|date=February 28, 2014|first=K|last=Srinivas|publisher=[[India Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=toi&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Gujaratis-survived-Idi-Amin-fuelled-East-Africas-economy/articleshow/3625352.cms|title=Gujaratis survived Idi Amin, fuelled East Africa’s economy|date=October 22, 2008|first1=Ashish|last1=Vashi|first2=Ankur|last2=Jain|publisher=[[The Times of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in Uganda, of whom 23,000 had had their applications for citizenship both processed and accepted.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt; Although the latter were ultimately exempted from the expulsion, many chose to leave voluntarily.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981"&gt;{{harvnb|Jørgensen|1981|pp=285–290}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expulsion took place against a backdrop of [[Anti-Indian sentiment|Indophobia]] in Uganda, with Amin accusing a minority of the Asian population of disloyalty, non-integration and commercial malpractice, claims Indian leaders disputed.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt; Amin defended the expulsion by arguing that he was giving Uganda back to ethnic Ugandans.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981" /&gt;

Many of the expellees were citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies and 27,200 subsequently emigrated to the [[United Kingdom]]. Of the other refugees who were accounted for, 6,000 went to [[Canada]], 4,500 refugees ended up in [[India]] and 2,500 went to nearby [[Kenya]].&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981" /&gt; In total, some 5,655 firms, ranches, farms, and agricultural estates were reallocated, along with cars, homes and other household goods.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981" /&gt;

== Background ==
The presence of South Asians in Uganda was the result of deliberate choices by the British administration (1894–1962).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{harvnb|Henckaerts|Sohn|1995|pp=22&amp;ndash;24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were brought to the [[Uganda Protectorate]] by the British to "serve as a buffer between Europeans and Africans in the middle rungs of commerce and administration".&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981" /&gt; In addition, in the 1890s, 32,000 labourers from British India were [[Indian diaspora in Southeast Africa|brought to Southeast Africa]] under indentured labour contracts to work on the construction of the [[Uganda Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jørgensen|1981|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the surviving Indians returned home, but 6,724 individuals decided to remain in the [[African Great Lakes]] after the line's completion.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} At the time of the expulsion, there were approximately 80,000 individuals of South Asian descent in Uganda, of whom 23,000 had had their applications for citizenship both processed and accepted.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia"&gt;{{harvnb|Patel|1972|pp=12&amp;ndash;19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further 50,000 were British passport holders,&lt;ref name="BBC On This Day" /&gt; though Amin himself used the apparently exaggerated figure of 80,000 British passport holders in his initial expulsion speech.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt;

The British had invested in the education of the Asian minority, in preference to that of indigenous Ugandans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By the early 1970s, many Indians in Southeast Africa and Uganda were employed in the [[sartorial]] and [[banking]] businesses{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} and [[Indophobia]] was already engrained by the start of Amin's rule in February 1971.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt; While not all Ugandan Asians were well off, they were on average better off than the indigenous communities,&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt; constituting 1% of the population while receiving a fifth of the national income.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Indians were stereotyped as "merely traders" and labelled as "dukawallas" (an occupational term that degenerated into an anti-Indian slur during Amin's time{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}), who tried to cheat unsuspecting purchasers and looked out only for their own families.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Patel|1972|pp=19&amp;ndash;21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, it was "not unusual to find that Indians possessed attitudes of superiority and negative pictures of the ability and efficiency of Africans".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Racial segregation was institutionalised.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Gated ethnic communities served elite healthcare and schooling services. Additionally, the tariff system in Uganda had historically been oriented toward the economic interests of South Asian traders.&lt;ref name="Journal of Modern African Studies"&gt;{{harvnb|Jamal|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Milton Obote]]'s government had pursued a policy of "Africanisation" which included policies targeted at Ugandan Asians. The 1968 Committee on the "Africanisation in Commerce and Industry", for example, had made far-reaching Indophobic proposals and a system of work permits and trade licenses was introduced in 1969 to restrict the role of non-citizen Indians in economic and professional activities. Nevertheless, Amin's policies represented a significant acceleration.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In August 1971, Amin announced a review of the citizenship status awarded to Uganda's Asian community, followed by the declaration of a [[census]] of Uganda's Asian population in October that year.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt; In order to resolve the "misunderstandings" regarding the role of Uganda's Asian minority in society, he then convened an Indian 'conference' for 7–8 December. In a memorandum presented on the second day of the conference, he set out his hope that "the wide gap" between Ugandan Asians and Africans would narrow.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt; While paying tribute to Indians' contribution to the economy and the professions, he accused a minority of the Asian population of disloyalty, non-integration and commercial malpractice, claims Indian leaders disputed.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt; On the vexed question of citizenship, he said his government would recognise citizenship rights already granted, but all outstanding applications for citizenship (which by this point were thought to number more than 12,000) would be cancelled.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt;

This expulsion of an ethnic minority was not the first in Uganda's history as the country's [[Kenya]]n minority, numbering approximately 30,000, had been expelled in 1969–70.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mutibwa|1992|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The expulsion==

On 4 August 1972, Amin declared that Britain would need to take on responsibility for British subjects of Asian origin,&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981" /&gt; accusing them of "sabotaging Uganda's economy and encouraging corruption".&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt; The deadline for British subjects to leave was confirmed as three months, which came to mean 8 November. On 9 August, the policy was expanded to include citizens of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981" /&gt; The position of the 23,000 Asians who had been granted Ugandan citizenship (and in particular those who held no other citizenship) was less clear. Not originally included, on 19 August, they were seemingly added to the list, before being re-exempted three days later following international protest. Many chose to leave rather than endure further intimidation, with only 4,000 known to have stayed.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981" /&gt; Exemptions for certain professions were added, then later removed.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt;

The precise motivation for the expulsion remains unclear. Some of his former supporters suggest that it followed a dream in which, he claimed, Allah had told him to expel them, as well as plot vengeance against the British government for refusing to provide him with arms to invade Tanzania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-04-15/india/27882308_1_devang-raval-museveni-indians | work=The Times Of India | title=Idi Amin had targeted Indians in 70s | date=15 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amin defended the expulsion by arguing that he was giving Uganda back to the ethnic Ugandans:

{{quote|We are determined to make the ordinary Ugandan master of his own destiny, and above all to see that he enjoys the wealth of his country. Our deliberate policy is to transfer the economic control of Uganda into the hands of Ugandans, for the first time in our country's history.|Idi Amin|quoted in ''Uganda: a modern history''.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981"/&gt;}}

Ugandan soldiers during this period engaged in theft and physical and sexual violence against the Asians with impunity.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Restrictions were imposed on the sale or transfer of private businesses by Ugandan Asians and on 16 August Amin made it clear that after he was done with Indian-owned business, European-owned businesses would be next.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt;

== Impact ==
Amin's decrees drew immediate condemnation, including from India, who severed diplomatic relations with Uganda. The Indian government warned Uganda of dire consequences, but took no action when Amin's government ignored the ultimatum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paralumun.com/waridiamin.htm|title=Idia Amin Biography|accessdate=29 October 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927025444/http://www.paralumun.com/waridiamin.htm|archivedate=27 September 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom froze a £10 million loan which had been arranged the previous year; Amin simply shrugged this off.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt;

Many of the Indians were citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies and 27,200 refugees subsequently emigrated to the [[United Kingdom]]. Of the other refugees who were accounted for, 6,000 went to [[Canada]], 4,500 ended up in [[India]] and 2,500 went to nearby [[Kenya]]. [[Malawi]], [[Pakistan]], [[West Germany]] and the [[United States]] took 1,000 refugees each, with smaller numbers emigrating to [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], [[Mauritius]] and [[New Zealand]]. About 20,000 refugees were unaccounted for.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981" /&gt;&lt;ref name="socialorigins"&gt;{{harvnb|Kasozi |Musisi|Sejjengo|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few hundred remained behind.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt; Reluctant to expand its newly introduced immigration quota, the British government had sought agreement from its British overseas territories to resettle them; however, only the [[Falkland Islands]] responded positively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jan/01/past.politics | title=Ministers hunted for island to house Asians | first=Alan | last=Travis | work=The Guardian | date=1 January 2003 | accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]] similarly closed their borders with Uganda to prevent an influx of refugees.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt;

Some of those expelled were [[Nizari Ismaili]] [[Muslims]]. The [[Aga Khan]], the Imam of Nizari Ismailis phoned his long-time friend Canadian Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]]. Trudeau's government agreed to allow thousands of Nizari Ismailis to emigrate to Canada.&lt;ref name="macleansHolyMan"&gt;{{harvnb|Geddes|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exodus of Ugandan Asians took on a new level of urgency on the September following a telegram from Amin to the UN Secretary General [[Kurt Waldheim]], in which it appeared that Amin was sympathetic to Hitler's treatment of Jews and an airlift was organised.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia" /&gt; The UN dispatched the Executive Secretary of the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Africa|Economic Commission for Africa]], [[Robert K. A. Gardiner]], who attempted in vain to convince Amin to reverse his decision.{{sfn|Sherwood|2014|p=43}}

Before the expulsion, Asians owned many large businesses in Uganda but the purge of Asians from Uganda's economy was virtually total. In total, some 5,655 firms, ranches, farms, and agricultural estates were reallocated, along with cars, homes and other household goods.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981"/&gt; For political reasons, most (5,443) were reallocated to individuals, with 176 going to government bodies, 33 being reallocated to semi-state organisations and 2 going to charities. Possibly the biggest winner was the state-owned [[Uganda Development Corporation]], which gained control over some of the largest enterprises, though both the rapid nature of the growth and the sudden lack of experienced technicians and managers proved a challenge for the corporation, resulting in a restructuring of the sector in 1974–5.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981"/&gt; "The Ugandan economy fell deep into a crisis under the strain of civil wars, the nationalization of certain industries and the expulsion of the Asians... By 1987, President Yoweri Museveni had inherited an economy that suffered the poorest growth rate in Africa."&lt;ref&gt;Samani, Vishva. Interview in the International Business Times, August 6, 2012. http://www.ibtimes.com/uganda-forty-years-after-idi-amin-expelled-asians-739228&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return==
Thousands of Gujaratis returned to Uganda after [[Yoweri Museveni]], the subsequent head of state of Uganda, criticized Idi Amin's policies and invited them to return.&lt;ref name=toi/&gt; According to Museveni, "Gujaratis have played a lead role in Uganda's social and industrial development. I knew that this community can do wonders for my country and they have been doing it for last many decades." The Gujaratis have resurfaced in Uganda and helped rebuild the economy of East Africa, and are financially well settled.&lt;ref name=toi/&gt;&lt;ref name="SinghRajan2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=A.

'''Claude Hamilton Gresham Jr.''' (June 21, 1922 &amp;ndash; February 18, 2008), better known as '''Grits Gresham''', was an internationally known [[United States|American]] [[Sportsperson|sportsman]], [[author]], [[photographer]] and [[television]] personality who hosted [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The American Sportsman]]'' [[television series|series]] from 1966 to 1979. Gresham, who resided on the historic [[Cane River|Cane River Lake]] in [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]], the oldest city in [[Louisiana]], traveled throughout the globe, particularly [[South America]] and [[Africa]], to engage in [[hunting]], [[fishing]] and [[shooting]] with various American [[celebrity|celebrities]]. He was a champion of the [[environmental ethic|environment]] and [[conservation ethic|conservation]], the subject of his [[graduate school]] [[thesis]].&lt;ref name=NSSF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nssf.org/share/BP2/links/Grits_Gresham.cfm|title=Outdoorsman Grits Gresham Dies at 85 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302035327/http://www.nssf.org/share/BP2/links/Grits_Gresham.cfm|publisher=National Shooting Sports Foundation|archivedate=March 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years, education, military==
Gresham was born in [[Spartanburg County, South Carolina|Spartanburg County]], [[South Carolina]], to Claude Gresham Sr. and the former Belle Hill. He inherited his nickname from his father, a semi-professional [[baseball]] player known as "Grit". Gresham grew up in rural South Carolina. As a small boy, he was so interested in hunting that he slept with his [[air rifle]] beside his bed. He took his first shot of the day out of his bedroom window.  "Two things were going to happen every day when I was growing up. The sun was going to rise, and I was going to shoot something," Gresham said in a 1996 interview.&lt;ref name="Times of London"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article3417569.ece|title=Grits Gresham|work=The Times|place=London|date=February 23, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523053431/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article3417569.ece|archivedate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended on a baseball [[scholarship]] the [[Blue Ridge School for Boys]], a private male [[boarding school]] named for the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] and located in [[Hendersonville, North Carolina|Hendersonville]], [[North Carolina]]. This school closed its doors in 1968. He also studied at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] at [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], [[Vanderbilt University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], and [[Yale University]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Connecticut]], but he procured his [[Bachelor of Science]] and [[Master of Science]] degrees, with specialty in [[forestry]] and [[wildlife management]], from [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], where he was thereafter an inductee into the LSU Hall of Distinction.&lt;ref name="outdoor legend"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shreveporttimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080219/NEWS01/802190322/1002/NEWS|title=Outdoor legend Grits Gresham dies|author=Timothy, Philip|work=The Shreveport Times|date=February 19, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315205326/http://www.shreveporttimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080219%2FNEWS01%2F802190322%2F1002%2FNEWS|archivedate=March 15, 2008|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Gresham began his long career in outdoor [[journalism]], he signed a baseball contract with the [[Chicago Cubs]] organization and was on the roster of the Cubs' [[Shelby, North Carolina]] farm team but never played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.star-telegram.com/sports/columnists/bob_hood/story/485777.html|title=Outdoors personality Grits Gresham dies|author=Hood, Bob|work=Fort Worth Star-Telegram|date=February 20, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312152054/http://www.star-telegram.com/sports/columnists/bob_hood/story/485777.html|archivedate=March 12, 2008|accessdate=August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=gresha001cla|title=Claude Gresham|publisher=baseball-reference|accessdate=August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son, Tom Gresham, learned of the baseball offer from the Cubs several years after his father's death while looking through old family records. "He went to work to take care of his young family ... I wonder how much it hurt him to make that decision. So much that he never, ever told us he was signed by the Cubs."&lt;ref name=btompkins&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/longform/sports/outdoors/2015/04/10/iconic-outdoorsman-grits-greshman-life-revealed/25569349/|title=Iconic outdoorsman Gresham's other life revealed|author=Tompkins, Bob|date=April 10, 2015|work=The Town Talk|accessdate=May 24, 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6sWWNvUha?url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/story/sports/outdoors/2015/04/10/iconic-outdoorsman-grits-greshman-life-revealed/25569349/|archivedate=August 6, 2017|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], Gresham served in the [[United States Army Air Corps]], the precursor to the [[United States Air Force]]. He considered his military service as important as his success in journalism.&lt;ref name=womenhunters&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womenhunters.com/outdoorsman-gresham-lisa-metheny.html|title=Outdoorsman Grits Gresham Dies at 85|author=Metheny, Lisa|date=February 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303213743/http://www.womenhunters.com/outdoorsman-gresham-lisa-metheny.html|work=WomenHunters.com|archivedate=March 3, 2008|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, Gresham married the former Mary Eleanor Ryan (July 4, 1925 &amp;ndash; March 5, 2001). She was a [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]], and he was a [[Baptist]]; they wed in a [[Methodist Church]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] while he was in between military assignments. In their first thirteen years of marriage, they had a different address each Christmas. Mary became an excellent cook by necessity and assisted her husband on his assignments with the use of her memory, note-taking, and photographic skills.&lt;ref name=btompkins/&gt;

The Greshams had three children, including [[Tom Gresham|Thomas Hamilton "Tom" Gresham]], host of weekly radio program ''[[Gun Talk]]''. There are three Gresham grandchildren, Delta Music Experience chief executive officer Amanda Gresham, ''Gun Talk'' principal Ryan Gresham, and landscape professional Meredith Gresham.

==Outdoors journalist and commentator==
Gresham worked for the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] and thereafter edited the ''Louisiana Conservationist'' magazine. He was the former outdoors editor of ''[[The Times (Shreveport)|The Shreveport Times]]'' too.&lt;ref name="Advocate remembering"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2theadvocate.com/sports/outdoors/15829857.html|title=Remembering Grits|author=Macaluso, Joe|work=The Advocate|date=February 21, 2008|page=10C|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305003730/http://www.2theadvocate.com/sports/outdoors/15829857.html?index=1&amp;c=y|archivedate=March 5, 2008|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gresham succeeded former [[Governor of South Dakota|Governor]] [[Joe Foss]] of [[South Dakota]] as the host of ''The American Sportsman''. He was thereafter joined by [[Curt Gowdy]] as co-host. Gresham further hosted ''[[Shooting Sports America]]'', sponsored by [[Chevrolet|Chevy Trucks]] on the [[ESPN]] network. For twenty-six years, he was the shooting [[editing|editor]] of ''[[Sports Afield]]'' magazine. He was also published in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' and ''[[Gentleman's Quarterly]]''. He appeared in television commercials for [[Miller Beer|Miller Lite Beer]].&lt;ref name="Times of London"/&gt;

Entertainers such as [[Bing Crosby]], [[Burt Reynolds]], [[Jonathan Winters]], [[Phil Harris]], [[Rip Torn]] and [[Andy Griffith]] joined Gresham on hunting and fishing trips as did sports figures such as [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[decathlon]] [[gold medal]]ist [[Caitlyn Jenner|Bruce Jenner]] (now Caitlyn Jenner),{{efn|Jenner changed her name due to [[gender transition]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leibovitz|first=Annie|title=Introducing Caitlyn Jenner|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/06/caitlyn-jenner-bruce-cover-annie-leibovitz/|work=Vanity Fair|date=June 1, 2015|accessdate=June 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; }} [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] defensive tackle [[Buck Buchanan]], and [[Bert Jones]], the 1976 [[National Football League]] [[National Football League Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]].&lt;ref name="outdoor legend"/&gt;

==The interview with Reagan==
In an interview with [[U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan]], Gresham reported that Reagan, as a fledgling [[radio]] announcer, had once used a [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] pistol to save a nurse in [[Des Moines, Iowa]] from a [[robbery|mugging]] on a street. After Gresham's story broke, the nurse came forward and confirmed the story but had no recollection that the young man who had saved her so many years before had turned out to have become the popular actor and President of the United States.&lt;ref name=womenhunters /&gt;

==Robert Barham and Bert Jones recall Gresham==
[[Robert J. Barham]], the Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries and a former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] member of the [[Louisiana State Legislature|Louisiana State Senate]], was among Gresham's longtime admirers. Gresham spent a lot of time with Barham's late father, Erle McKoin "Ninety" Barham (1916–1976) of [[Morehouse Parish]], who was also an environmentalist. Barham recalled a "picture of my dad in one of his books -- ''The Complete Wildfowler''. As a child, I got to meet him and be around him. He was just so easy to be around. Grits was nothing like the television celebrities of today. People were drawn to him. He made them feel at ease ... he made me feel at ease, and I was just a child. ... There will never be another like him,"  Barham told ''[[The Shreveport Times]]''.&lt;ref name="outdoor legend"/&gt;

==Fishing and the wetlands==
Gresham was among the first to sound the alarm about the loss of [[wetlands]] in Louisiana. He worked with [[Ray Scott (angler)|Ray Scott]], the founder of the [[Bass Anglers Sportsman Society]], to halt the cheating that had previously haunted tournament bass fishing. Gresham's ''Kiss the Land Goodbye'' was one of the early works about vanishing wetlands.&lt;ref name="outdoor legend"/&gt;

Gresham's ''The Complete Book of Bass Fishing'' is, according to Ray Scott, "the best book ever written on bass fishing." Gresham wrote a column for Scott's ''Bassmaster'' magazine [[pro bono]].&lt;ref name="outdoor legend"/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Gresham died at his home on Cane River Lake in Natchitoches, a small city in north central Louisiana, of complications from [[Alzheimer's disease]] &amp;ndash; [[pneumonia]] and infection. He had spent most of his last year in a [[nursing home]] in Natchitoches. In addition to his children, he was survived by three sisters, Rosa Schemmel of [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]], [[Kansas]], and Edith Kelley and Ruth Bedingfield of [[Ware Shoals, South Carolina|Ware Shoals]] in northwestern [[South Carolina]]. Services were held on February 22, 2008 in the chapel of Blanchard-St. Denis [[funeral home|Funeral Home]] in Natchitoches, with the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] minister Louis E. Sklar, III, officiating. Among Gresham's pallbearers was [[Louisiana State Legislature|State Representative]] [[Rick Nowlin]] of Natchitoches. Burial was in Memory Lawn Cemetery on [[Louisiana Highway 6]] near Natchitoches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|24753682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gresham received an honorary doctorate of humane letters from [[Northwestern State University]] in Natchitoches. On February 9, 2006, he received the only Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which established, with the Professional Outdoor Media Association, an ongoing "Grits Gresham Shooting Sports Communicator" award. The recipient of the award receives a [[bronze]] replica of Gresham's trademark "cowboy" hat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nssf.org/blast/view.cfm?vol=archive&amp;ed=E16|title=Grits Gresham receivers Lifetime Achievement Award|work=SHOT Show Blast|publisher=National Shooting Sports Foundation|date=March 22, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827010504/http://www.nssf.org/blast/view.cfm?vol=archive&amp;ed=E16|archivedate=August 27, 2007|accessdate=August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was among the most known spokesmen for the National Shooting Sports Federation.&lt;ref name=NSSF /&gt;

Gary Garth, the outdoor editor of ''[[The Courier-Journal]]'' in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], relates that he became "addicted" to [[duck]] hunting as a child, based on the encouragement of Grits Gresham columns. "Through my work I've had the opportunity to meet, hunt, and fish with a few of the giants in my business. But I never met Grits. It's just as well. Some [[pedestal]]s should remain untouched," Garth said in his tribute to the legendary outdoorsman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courier-journal.com/blogs/outdoors/2008/02/grits-gresham.html|title=Grits Gresham|date=February 19, 2008|work=Gary Garth's Field Notes|publisher=The Courier-Journal|place=Louisville, KY|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120724111628/http://www.courier-journal.com/blogs/outdoors/2008/02/grits-gresham.html|archivedate=July 24, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joe Macaluso, outdoor editor of the ''[[The Advocate (Baton Rouge)|Baton Rouge Morning Advocate]]'' recalled a fishing trip with Gresham on [[Toledo Bend Reservoir]] at the Texas-Louisiana boundary. Macaluso described Gresham as "the most famous of all Louisiana outdoors writers and media members... He was like a loaf of good [[French bread]], crusty-hard on the outside and tender on the inside. When I told him that, he laughed [and said] 'Don’t tell anyone else'..."&lt;ref name="Advocate remembering"/&gt;

Peter published the Latin editions of these texts, without translation and with introductions in Latin; for the greatest part of the twentieth century, this was the standard edition of such texts.

'''''Hut 33''''' is a [[BBC Radio 4]] [[sitcom]] set at [[Bletchley Park]] in 1941.  It includes both the writer ([[James Cary (writer)|James Cary]]) and producer ([[Adam Bromley]]) from ''[[Think the Unthinkable]]'' and ''[[Concrete Cow]]''.

==Production==
The first six-part series  was recorded at the BBC Radio Theatre in [[Broadcasting House]] on 24 June, 1 July and 8 July 2007. It was broadcast at 11.30am on Mondays from 25 June–30 July 2007. The second series ran from 21 May–25 June 2008. James Cary began writing Series 3 in February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Cary, James (3 February 2009). "[http://hut33.blogspot.com/2009/02/starting-writing-episode.html Starting Writing an Episode]". Hut 33 blog. Retrieved on 10 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The third series was recorded on 25 May, 25 Sep and 27 Sep 2009.  Series three broadcasts began 14 October 2009.

==Cast==
*[[Tom Goodman-Hill]] as Archie, a [[Geordie]] Marxist. Spends a great deal of his time antagonising Charles.
*[[Robert Bathurst]] as Professor Charles Gardner, the ultra-conservative snob and don who rejected Archie from [[Oxford University]] for not knowing how to use a fish knife at the dinner table.
*[[Fergus Craig]] as Gordon, 17-year-old child maths prodigy, still in short trousers, in love with Minka.
*[[Alex MacQueen]] as 3rd Lt. Joshua Featherstonhaugh-Marshall ("Josh"), theoretically in charge of the hut, made 3rd Lt when he could not be demoted any further from [[Second Lieutenant|2nd Lt]] after losing a tank regiment in the [[Battle of France]] by driving them into the sea.  Josh did attend Oxford, which angers Archie, especially once he discovers that Charles let Josh in as a ''quid pro quo'' for admission to the [[Garrick Club]].
*[[Olivia Colman]] as Minka, the Hut's [[Polish people|Polish]] secretary, worryingly keen on extreme violence as the solution to all problems.  Minka also takes jobs such as watchperson, interrogator, camp guard, detective and burglar.  A running joke involves Minka startling the other characters by sneaking up silently and suddenly announcing her presence.
*[[Lill Roughley]] as Mrs Best, their sex-obsessed landlady who claims to have bedded both [[Bomber Harris]] and [[Hermann Göring]].  Not to mention [[Donald Bradman]], [[Albert Einstein]] and just about any other notable person of her time.
*Winstanley, the silent occupant of Hut 33 always working at his desk.  At any given time he may be naked, or wearing [[pajamas|pyjamas]], or otherwise eccentrically dressed.  In series 1 episode 3 he decides to wear a suit of armour, so his responses are assorted clanks and creaks - or is he just an empty suit?

'''IMDb''' ('''Internet Movie Database''') is an [[online database]] of information related to films, television programs, home videos and video games, and internet streams, including cast, production crew and personnel biographies, plot summaries, trivia, and fan reviews and ratings. An additional fan feature, message boards, was abandoned in February 2017. Originally a fan-operated website, the database is owned and operated by IMDb.com, Inc., a subsidiary of [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]].

{{As of|2018|10}}, IMDb has approximately {{Formatnum: {{#expr: {{Formatnum:5,310,913 |R}} / 1e6 round 1}}}} million&lt;!--Condensed values per MOS:LARGENUM--&gt; titles (including episodes) and {{Formatnum: {{#expr: {{Formatnum: 9,285,228 |R}} / 1e6 round 1}}}} million&lt;!--Condensed values per MOS:LARGENUM--&gt; personalities in its database,&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt; as well as 83 million registered users.

==Features==
The movie and talent pages of IMDb are accessible to all internet users, but a registration process is necessary to contribute information to the site.

Most data in the database is provided by volunteer contributors. The site enables registered users to submit new material and edits to existing entries. Users with a proven track record of submitting factual data are given instant approval for additions or corrections to cast, credits, and other demographics of media product and personalities. However, image, name, character name, plot summaries, and title changes are supposedly screened before publication, and usually take between 24 and 72 hours to appear.

All registered users choose their own site name, and most operate anonymously. They have a ''profile page'' which shows how long a registered user has been a member, as well as personal movie ratings (should the user decide to display them) and, since 2015, "badges" are added representing how many contributions a particular registered user has submitted. These badges range from total contributions made to independent categories such as photos, trivia, bios, etc. If a registered user or visitor is in the entertainment industry and has an IMDb ''page'', that user/visitor can add photos to that page by enrolling in IMDbPRO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Submission guide for users |series=Help Center |url=https://www.imdb.com/help/search?domain=helpdesk_faq&amp;index=2&amp;file=contact_information&amp;ref_=hlp_sr_1 |website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no single index of contributors, no index on each profile page of the items contributed, and (except for plot synopses and biographies) no identification of contributors to each product's or person's data pages.

Users are also invited to rate any film on a scale of 1 to 10, and the totals are converted into a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|weighted mean]]-rating that is displayed beside each title, with online filters employed to deter [[ballot-stuffing]].

==History==
===History before website===
IMDb originated with a [[Usenet]] posting by British film fan and computer programmer [[Col Needham]] entitled "Those Eyes", about actresses with beautiful eyes. Others with similar interests soon responded with additions or different lists of their own. Needham subsequently started an "Actors List", while Dave Knight began a "[[film director|Directors]] List", and Andy Krieg took over "THE LIST" from Hank Driskill, which would later be renamed the "Actress List". Both lists had been restricted to people who were alive and working, but soon retired people were added, so Needham started what was then (but did not remain) a separate "Dead Actors/Actresses List". The goal of the participants now was to make the lists as inclusive as possible.

By late 1990, the lists included almost 10,000&amp;nbsp;movies and television series correlated with actors and actresses appearing therein. On 17&amp;nbsp;October 1990, Needham developed and posted a collection of [[Unix]] [[shell script]]s which could be used to search the four lists, and thus the database that would become the IMDb was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chmielewski |first=Dawn C. |date=19 January  2013 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/19/business/la-fi-himi-needham-20130120 |title=Col Needham created IMDb |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, it was known as the "rec.arts.movies movie database".

===On the web===
The database had been expanded to include additional categories of filmmakers and other demographic material as well as trivia, biographies, and plot summaries. The movie ratings had been properly integrated with the list data, and a centralized email interface for querying the database had been created by Alan Jay. Later, in 1993, it moved onto the [[World Wide Web]], (a network in its infancy at that time) under the name of ''Cardiff Internet Movie Database''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/movies/ |title=Historical Internet Movie Database Site |publisher=Cardiff School of Computer Science &amp; Informatics |access-date=21 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324121844/http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/movies/ |archivedate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The database resided on the servers of the computer science department of [[Cardiff University]] in Wales. [[Rob Hartill]] was the original web interface author. In 1994, the email interface was revised to accept the submission of all information, which enabled people to email the specific list maintainer with their updates. However, the structure remained so that information received on a single film was divided among multiple section managers, the sections being defined and determined by categories of film personnel and the individual filmographies contained therein. Over the next few years, the database was run on a network of [[Web mirror|mirrors]] across the world with donated bandwidth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IMDB History |url=https://www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?history |website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As an independent company===
In 1996 IMDb was incorporated in the United Kingdom, becoming the Internet Movie Database Ltd. Founder Col.&amp;nbsp;Needham became the primary owner as well as the figurehead. General revenue for site operations was generated through advertising, licensing and partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IMDB turned 20 on 17&amp;nbsp;October 2010 |url=https://www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?history}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As Amazon.com subsidiary (1998–present)===
In 1998, [[Jeff Bezos]], founder, owner, and CEO of Amazon.com, struck a deal with Needham and other principal shareholders to buy IMDb outright for approximately $55&amp;nbsp;million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.secinfo.com/dr643.7kp.c.htm#2ndPage |title=SEC Info - Amazon Com Inc - '8-K' for 4/27/98 - EX-99.2 |website=secinfo.com |date=April 27, 1998 |accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attach it to Amazon as a subsidiary, private company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=37602 |title=Internet bookseller Amazon.com announces acquisition of United Kingdom company The Internet Movie Database Ltd. |author=IMDb |agency=PR Newswire Europe |access-date=15 January 2007 |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This gave IMDb the ability to pay the shareholders salaries for their work, while Amazon.com would be able to use IMDb as an advertising resource for selling DVDs and videotapes.

IMDb continued to expand its functionality. On 15&amp;nbsp;January 2002, it added a subscription service known as IMDbPro, aimed at entertainment professionals. IMDbPro was announced and launched at the 2002 [[Sundance Film Festival]]. It provides a variety of services including film production and box office details, as well as a company directory and the ability of subscribers to add personal information pages with details at variance with pages about them appearing in the database.

As an additional incentive for users, {{as of|2003|lc=y}}, users identified as one of "the top 100&amp;nbsp;contributors" of hard data received complimentary free access to IMDbPro for the following calendar year; for 2006 this was increased to the top&amp;nbsp;150 contributors, and for 2010 to the top&amp;nbsp;250.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/updates/guide/top_contributors#top2010 |series=IMD; announcement |title=Top&amp;nbsp;250 contributors for 2010 |access-date=25 August 2011 |first=Col |last=Needham |date=1 January 2011 |website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, IMDb launched their first official foreign language version with the German IMDb.de. Also in 2008, IMDb acquired two other companies: [[Withoutabox]] and [[Box Office Mojo]].

The website was originally [[Perl]]-based, but IMDb no longer discloses what software it uses for reasons of security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://help.imdb.com/article/imdb/general-information/what-software-are-you-using-to-run-imdb/GH25HF4NB3C2KP9E |title=What software are you using to run IMDb? |publisher=IMDb |year=2017 |access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May&amp;nbsp;2011, the site has been [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|filtered in China]] for more than one year, although many users address it through [[proxy server]] or by [[VPN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/china-blocks-number-one-movie-site-imdb-663458 |title=China blocks number-one movie site IMDb |publisher=2012 [[Future US, Inc.]] |date=14 January 2010 |last=Chacksfield |first=Marc |website=TechRadar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==IMDbPro==
Actors, crew, and industry executives can post their own resume and upload photos of themselves for a yearly fee. This fee gives them membership in IMDbPro. IMDbPro can be accessed by anyone willing to pay the fee, which is US$19.99&amp;nbsp;per month, or if paid annually, US$149.99. Membership enables a user to access the rank order of each industry personality, as well as agent contact information for any actor, producer, director etc. that has an IMDb page. Enrolling in IMDbPro for industry personnel, enables those members the ability to upload a head shot to open their page, as well as the ability to upload hundreds of photos to accompany their page. Anyone can register as an IMDb user and contribute to the site as well as view its content, however those users enrolled in IMDbPro have greater access and privileges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://secure.imdb.com/signup/index.html |title=IMDbPro signup |website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television episodes numbers==
On 26&amp;nbsp;January 2006, "Full Episode Support" came online, allowing the database to support separate cast and crew listings for each episode of every television series. This increased the number of titles in the database from 485,000 to nearly 755,000.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Characters' filmography==
On 2&amp;nbsp;October 2007,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} the characters' filmography was added. Character entries are created from character listings in the main filmography database, and as such do not need any additional verification by IMDb staff. They have already been verified when they are added to the main filmography.

==Instant viewing==
On 15&amp;nbsp;September 2008, a feature was added that enables instant viewing of over 6,000&amp;nbsp;movies and television shows from CBS, Sony and a number of [[independent film]] makers, with direct links from their profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13515_3-10042280-26.html?tag=mncol |publisher=[[cnet]] |title=IMDb now serves full-length videos |first=Harrison |last=Hoffman |date=15 September 2008 |access-date=17 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to licensing restrictions, this feature is available only to viewers in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/09/16/imdb_adds_streaming_movies_and_tv/ |publisher=The Register |title=IMDb adds full-length streaming movies (Show your US ID card at the door) |last=Modine |first=Austin |date=16 September 2008 |accessdate=17 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This feature has since been discontinued. As quoted from IMDb.com video faq's "You won't be able to view the movie or TV Show on IMDb. The videos on IMDb are Trailers, Interviews, Clips, Featurettes, and other original content that dive deeper into great movies and TV shows."

Date discontinued: [information needed]

==Content and format==
===Data provided by subjects===
In 2006, IMDb introduced its "Résumé Subscription Service", where actors and crew can post their own [[résumé]] and upload photos of themselves&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023141910/http://www.lycos-europe.com/Index-Eng/G-English-Files/PR-20060710-IMDb.html |archive-date=2006-10-23 |dead-url=yes |url=http://www.lycos-europe.com/Index-Eng/G-English-Files/PR-20060710-IMDb.html |title=Lycos Europe and IMDb sign sales agreement for 9&amp;nbsp;European markets |website=[[Lycos Europe]] |series=press release |date=10 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a yearly fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |series=Resume FAQ |website=IMDb |url=https://resume.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?resumenotrecurring |title=Can I subscribe only for one month or one year? |access-date=22 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The base annual charge for including a photo with an account was US$39.95 until 2010, when it was increased to US$54.95. IMDb résumé pages are kept on a sub-page of the regular entry about that person, with a regular entry automatically created for each résumé subscriber who does not already have one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |series=Resume FAQ |website=IMDb |url=https://resume.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?resumenamepagediff |title=Is there any difference between a regular IMDb name page and an IMDb name page created via IMDb Resume? |access-date=22 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2012}}, Resume Services is now included as part of an IMDbPro subscription, and is no longer offered as a separate subscription service.

===Copyright, vandalism and error issues===
All volunteers who contribute content to the database technically retain copyright on their contributions but the compilation of the content becomes the exclusive property of IMDb with the full right to copy, modify, and sublicense it and they are verified before posting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/help/show_article |title=Copyright and Conditions of Use |website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Credit is not given on specific title or filmography pages to the contributor(s) who have provided information. Conversely, a credited text entry, such as a plot summary, may be corrected for content, grammar, sentence structure, perceived omission or error, by other contributors without having to add their names as co-authors. Due to the time required for processing  submitted data or text before it is displayed, IMDb is different from user-contributed projects like Wikipedia, [[Discogs]], or [[OpenStreetMap]] in that contributors cannot add, delete, or modify the data or text on impulse, and the manipulation of data is controlled by IMDb technology and salaried staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/interfaces#plain |title=The plain text data files |series=Alternate Interfaces |website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IMDb has been subject to deliberate additions of false information; in 2012 a spokesperson said: "We make it easy for users and professionals to update much of our content, which is why we have an 'edit page.' The data that is submitted goes through a series of consistency checks before it goes live. Given the sheer volume of the information, occasional mistakes are inevitable, and, when reported, they are promptly fixed. We always welcome corrections."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/james-marsden-likes-barry-manilow-390278 |title=Which A-list star is hacking IMDb pages? |newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=14 November 2012 |access-date=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Java Movie Database (JMDB)&lt;ref name="jmdb" /&gt; is reportedly creating an IMDb_Error.log file that lists all the errors found while processing the IMDb plain text files. A Wiki alternative to IMDb is Open Media Database&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omdb.org |title=Open Media Database |website=omdb.org |access-date=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose content is also contributed by users but licensed under [[Creative Commons license|CC-by]] and the [[GNU Free Documentation License|GFDL]]. Since 2007, IMDb has been experimenting with wiki-programmed sections for complete film synopses, parental guides, and FAQs about titles as determined by (and answered by) individual contributors.

===Data format and access===
IMDb does not provide an [[Web API|API]] for automated queries. However, most of the data can be downloaded as [[data compression|compressed]] plain text files and the information can be extracted using the [[command-line interface]] tools provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://imdb.com/interfaces |title=Alternate Interfaces |website=IMDb |access-date=15 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a Java-based [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) application available that is able to process the compressed plain text files, which allows a search and a display of the information.&lt;ref name="jmdb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmdb.de/ |title=Java Movie Database (JMDB) |website=Jmdb.de |access-date=27 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This GUI application supports different languages, but the movie related data are in English, as made available by IMDb. A [[Python (programming language)|Python]] package called IMDbPY can also be used to process the compressed plain text files into a number of different [[SQL]] databases, enabling easier access to the entire dataset for searching or data mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net/|title=IMDbPY |website=IMDbPY |access-date=14 February 2011 |publisher=sourceforge.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film titles===
The IMDb has sites in English as well as versions translated completely or in part into other languages ([[Danish language|Danish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], French, German, [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], Italian, [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], Spanish and [[Romanian language|Romanian]]). The non-English language sites display film titles in the specified language. Originally, IMDb's [[English language]] sites displayed titles according to their original country-of-origin language, however, in 2010 IMDb began allowing individual users in the UK and USA to choose primary title display by either the original-language titles, or the US or UK release title (normally, in English).

==Ancillary features==
===User ratings of films===
As one adjunct to data, the IMDb offers a [[rating scale]] that allows users to rate films on a scale of one to ten. It has been alleged that the rating system is flawed, for several reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://screenrant.com/imdbs-top-250-discussion/|title=Why IMDb's Top&amp;nbsp;250 matters ... and why it doesn't |publisher=Screenrant.com |date=13 April 2010 |access-date=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IMDb indicates that submitted ratings are filtered and weighted in various ways in order to produce a [[weighted mean]] that is displayed for each film, series, and so on. It states that filters are used to avoid [[ballot stuffing]]; the method is not described in detail to avoid attempts to circumvent it. In fact, it sometimes produces an extreme difference between the weighted average and the arithmetic mean.

====Rankings====
The IMDb Top 250 is a list of the top rated 250 films, based on ratings by the registered users of the website using the methods described. {{As of|2018|09|26}}, ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]'' is #1 on the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.imdb.com/chart/top |title=Top&amp;nbsp;250 movies as voted by our users |publisher=IMDb |access-date=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Top&amp;nbsp;250" rating is based on only the ratings of "regular voters". The number of votes a registered user would have to make to be considered as a user who votes regularly has been kept secret. IMDb has stated that to maintain the effectiveness of the Top&amp;nbsp;250 list they "''deliberately do not disclose the criteria used for a person to be counted as a regular voter''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/help/search?domain=helpdesk_faq&amp;index=1&amp;file=notintop250 |title=The user votes average on film or show ''X'' is 9.4, so it should appear in your Top&amp;nbsp;250 Movies or TV list, yet it doesn't. Why? |website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to other weightings, the Top&amp;nbsp;250 films are also based on a weighted rating formula referred to in [[actuarial science]] as a ''credibility formula''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://stats.lse.ac.uk/norberg/links/papers/CRED-eas.pdf |title=Encyclopedia of Actuarial Science |format=PDF |last=Norberg |first=Ragnar |doi=10.1002/9780470012505.tac068 |chapter=Credibility Theory |year=2006 |isbn=0470846763 |dead-url=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703084323/http://stats.lse.ac.uk/norberg/links/papers/CRED-eas.pdf |archive-date=3 July 2007 }} also available via {{cite web |url=http://isfaserveur.univ-lyon1.fr/~norberg/links/papers/CRED-eas.pdf |title=Credibility Theory |series=mirror }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This label arises because a statistic is taken to be more credible the greater the number of individual pieces of information; in this case from eligible users who submit ratings. Although the current formula is not disclosed, IMDb originally used the following formula to calculate their weighted rating:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IMDB's statement on their voting calculation |url=https://www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?votes |website=imdb.com |access-date=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IMDB Vote FAQ |url=https://www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?votestopfaq |website=IMDb.com |accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;W = \frac{\ R \cdot v + C \cdot m\ }{v + m} &lt;/math&gt;
where:
:&lt;math&gt;W\ &lt;/math&gt; = weighted rating
:&lt;math&gt;R\ &lt;/math&gt; = average for the movie as a number from 1 to 10 (mean) = (Rating)
:&lt;math&gt;v\ &lt;/math&gt; = number of votes for the movie = (votes)
:&lt;math&gt;m\ &lt;/math&gt; = minimum votes required to be listed in the Top 250 (currently 25,000)
:&lt;math&gt;C\ &lt;/math&gt; = the mean vote across the whole report (currently 7.0)

The &lt;math&gt;W\ &lt;/math&gt; in this formula is equivalent to a Bayesian posterior mean (''see [[Bayesian statistics]]'').

The IMDb also has a Bottom&amp;nbsp;100 feature which is assembled through a similar process although only 1500&amp;nbsp;votes must be received to qualify for the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.imdb.com/bottom_100_films |title=Bottom&amp;nbsp;100 |publisher=IMDb |access-date=1 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Top&amp;nbsp;250 list comprises a wide range of feature films, including major releases, cult films, independent films, critically acclaimed films, silent films, and non-English language films. Documentaries, short films and TV&amp;nbsp;episodes are not currently included.

Since 2015, there has been a Top&amp;nbsp;250 list devoted to ranking television shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/chart/toptv/ |title=Top&amp;nbsp;250 TV |website=IMDb |access-date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Message boards===
Beginning in 2001, the Internet Movie Database also maintained message boards for every title (excepting, {{as of|2013|lc=y}}, TV episodes&lt;ref&gt;Each TV episode uses the same message board for the whole series&lt;/ref&gt;) and name entry, along with over 140 main boards. This began in 2001. In order to post on the message boards a user needed to "authenticate" their account via cell phone, credit card, or by having been a recent customer of the parent company [[Amazon.com]]. Message boards expanded in recent years. The Soapbox started in 1999 as a general message board meant for debates on any subjects. The Politics board started in 2007 was a message board to discuss politics, news events, and current affairs, as well as history and economics.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

By 20&amp;nbsp;February 2017, all the message boards and their content were permanently removed. According to the website, the decision was made because the boards were "no longer providing a positive, useful experience for the vast majority of our more than 250&amp;nbsp;million monthly users worldwide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/boards/announcement |title=IMDb Message Boards |accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Col Needham also mentioned in a post some months earlier that the boards received less income from ads, and that their members only made up a very small part of the website's visitors. The boards were costly to run due to the system's age and dated design, which did not make business sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://getsatisfaction.com/imdb/topics/can-someone-on-the-inside-explain-to-me |title=Can someone on the inside explain to me |website=IMDb.com Customer Community |access-date=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to remove the message boards was met with outspoken backlash across the web and on social media, and sparked an online petition garnering over 8,000&amp;nbsp;signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pgxeab/how-some-users-are-trying-to-save-imdbs-message-board |title=How some users are trying to save IMDB's message board |website=Vice.com |access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the days leading up to 20&amp;nbsp;February 2017, both Archive.org&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/archiveteam_imdb |title=The Archiveteam IMDb message board archive (raw data) |publisher=Archive.org |access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and MovieChat.org&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://moviechat.org |title=The MovieChat IMDb Message Board Archive (web-based) |publisher=MovieChat.org |access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; preserved the entire contents of the IMDb message boards using "web scraping" technologies. Archive.org and MovieChat.org have published IMDb message board archives, which is legal under the fair use doctrine, because it has no effect on IMDb's potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107/ |title=17 U.S. Code § 107 - Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use |publisher=[[Cornell Law School]] |access-date=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movietvforums.com/imdb-message-board-archives-legal/ |title=Movie &amp; TV Forums: IMDb Message Board Archives: Are They Legal? |publisher=MovieTVForums.com |access-date=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Litigation==
In 2011, in the case of ''[[Hoang v. Amazon.com]]'', IMDb was sued by an anonymous actress for more than {{Currency|1&amp;nbsp;million}} due to IMDb's revealing her age (40, at the time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bahr |first=Lindsey |url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/10/18/imdb-lawsuit/ |title=Lawsuit against IMDb revealing private information |website=Insidemovies.ew.com |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |date=18 October 2011 |access-date=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actress claimed that revealing her age could cause her to lose acting opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-15492579 |title=Acting unions criticise IMDb in age row |website=BBC News |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=29 October 2011 |access-date=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge [[Marsha J. Pechman]], a U.S. district judge in Seattle, dismissed the lawsuit, saying the actress had no grounds to proceed with an anonymous complaint. The actress re-filed and so revealed that she was Huong Hoang of Texas, who uses the stage name Junie Hoang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/home/world-news/article/16144281 |title=Actress sued Amazon for revealing age&amp;nbsp;40 identified as Huong (Junie) Hoang |publisher=News.sky.com |date=7 January 2012 |access-date=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Pechman dismissed all causes of action except for a [[breach of contract]] claim against IMDb; a jury then sided with IMDb on that claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Actress age claim against IMDb rejected |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-22120587 |website=BBC News |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] affirmed the district court judgment in March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gardner |first=Eriq |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/imdb-preserves-legal-win-revelation-784985 |title=IMDb preserves legal win over revelation of actress' age |newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2011, in the case of United Video Properties Inc., et al. v. Amazon.Com Inc. et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Case Docket: United Video Properties Inc., et al v. Amazon.Com Inc. et al. |url=https://archive.org/details/gov.uscourts.ded.45528 |publisher=[[RECAP]] |access-date=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; IMDb and Amazon were sued by [[Rovi Corporation]] and others for patent infringement over their various program listing offerings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Masnick |first=Mike |title=Rovi sues Amazon for not licensing its Electronic TV Guide patent |url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110105/03393312527/rovi-sues-amazon-not-licensing-its-electronic-tv-guide-patent.shtml |date=12 January 2011 |newspaper=[[Techdirt]] |accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patent claims were ultimately construed in a way favorable to IMDb and Rovi / United Video Properties lost the case, though as of November&amp;nbsp;2014 it is on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mullin |first=Joe |date=4 November 2013 |title=Netflix roasts Rovi's 'Interactive TV guide' patents at ITC |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/11/netflix-roasts-rovis-interactive-tv-guide-patents-at-itc/ |accessdate=5 November 2013 |website=[[Ars Technica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1&amp;nbsp;January 2017, the State of California implemented state bill AB-1687, a [[SAG-AFTRA]]-backed anti-ageism statute which requires "commercial online entertainment employment services" to honor requests by their subscribers for their ages and birthdays to be hidden.&lt;ref name="thr-imdblaw"&gt;{{cite news |title=California enacts law requiring IMDb to remove actor ages on request |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/california-enacts-law-requiring-imdb-932330 |newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23&amp;nbsp;February 2017, Judge Vince Girdhari Chhabria issued a stay on the bill pending a further trial, claiming that it possibly violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] because it inhibited the public consumption of factual information. He also questioned the intent of the bill, as it was ostensibly meant to target IMDb.&lt;ref name="thr-lawstruck"&gt;{{cite news |title=Judge pauses enforcement of IMDb Age Censorship law |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/judge-pauses-enforcement-imdb-age-censorship-law-978797 |newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the beginning of 2017, IMDb had received more than 2,300&amp;nbsp;requests from individuals to remove their date of birth from the site. Included in this group were 10&amp;nbsp;[[Academy Award]] winners and another 71 nominated for Oscars, [[Emmy Award|Emmys]], or [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bray |first=Hiawatha |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2017/03/22/internet-censorship-hollywood-style/SnSepVsdtqkoAgqLQqj2SM/story.html |title=Internet censorship, Hollywood style |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=23 March 2017 |access-date=23 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516164039/http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2017/03/22/internet-censorship-hollywood-style/SnSepVsdtqkoAgqLQqj2SM/story.html |archive-date=16 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Internet Provider Security''' ('''IPS''') '''tags''' are used by [[domain registrar]] to administer a [[domain name]] [[domain registration|registration]] service and related [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) services. An IPS tag is the label that applies to each registrar that registers domains in the country-code top level domain ''uk'' and is required to transfer domain names from one registrar to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nominet Registrar Rules|url=http://www.nominet.uk/resources/policy/policies-rules/|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original meaning of ''IPS tag'' was thought to be lost after it was created with [[Nominet UK]]'s predecessor, the Naming Committee; it is widely speculated that it stands for ''Internet Provider Security tag''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The term ''IPS tag'' itself is considered obsolete by [[Nominet UK]], and has since been replaced by the term ''registrar tag''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} However, there are also records of those involved in the early internet industry who believe it was a typo of the acronym for Internet Service Provider made by an unnamed junior systems administrator, ISPs being the main bodies responsible for registering domains in the early years of the commercial internet. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mail-archive.com/search?l=discuss-list@opensrs.org&amp;q=subject:%22Re%5C%3A+Change+IPS+Tag%22&amp;o=newest&amp;f=1|title=Re: Change IPS Tag|website=The Mail Archive|date=14 November 2002|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The identity of the engineer making the typo is known but the identity is not currently referenced on the web.&lt;ref&gt;Personal communication.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Transferring a domain name from one registrar to another requires the original registrar to change the IPS tag to that of the new registrar. Domain name owners can often, but not always, change this tag themselves in the respective domain management control panels.

It is possible to change the IPS tag via the Nominet website. The cost for this feature is £10+VAT.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nominet.org.uk/uk-domain-names/manage-your-domain/change-registrar&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baranyai Decsi János.jpg|thumb|right|János Baranyai Decsi]]
'''János Baranyai Decsi''' ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian:]] ''Baranyai Decsi Csimor János'' ) is a Hungarian [[Renaissance]] writer who lived in the 16th century. He lived in the [[Transylvania]]n court of [[Báthory]] Zsigmond.

==Life==

He was born in [[Decs]] in [[Ottoman Hungary]] in 1560. His family name was Csimor. He belonged to the [[Calvinist]] Church.

He completed his studies in [[Tolna, Hungary|Tolna]], [[Debrecen]] and Kolozsvár (now [[Cluj-Napoca]]). In 1587, he travelled abroad accompanying the young Hungarian aristocrat, Ferenc Bánffy de Losoncz. The pair studied in [[Wittenberg]], where Bánffy was elected as [[rector (academia)|rector]].

In 1590, they moved to [[Strasbourg]]. The family estate had been ruined by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Turks. In 1592, he moved to Kolozsvár (now [[Cluj-Napoca]]), where the Duke, [[Sigismund Báthory]] supported him. The following year, he moved to Marosvásárhely (now [[Târgu Mureş]]) where he began working as a teacher, which he held until his death.

He travelled a great deal, to Gyulafehérvár ([[Alba Iulia]]), to Kolozsvár (now [[Cluj-Napoca]]) , and once even to [[Strasbourg]] to be granted a higher degree.

==History of Hungary 1592–1598 ==

Baranyai was close to the official documents of the [[Transylvania]]n court, he mentions as informators Márton Pethe, [[Demeter Naprágyi]], Ferenc Dersffy, Sebestyén Thököly, László Hommonai, Miklós Czobor. He even interviewed the beg of Lippa (now [[Lipova, Arad|Lipova]]) Mohamed in prison.

His source for earlier periods is often [[Antonio Bonfini]]. His relation to the Catholic duke was contradictory; on the one hand Baranyai needed the prince's support to finance his own work, but Baranyai often spoke out against what he perceived as the duke's crimes and impotence in military or political matters. He often quotes the facts without commentary.

The work would copy [[Antonio Bonfini]] in its structure, written in the form of the ten decades of Hungarian history but Baranyai only wrote the tenth decade.

First editions are of [[Marton Kovachich]] 1798 and of [[Ferenc Toldy]] in 1866.

'''Kidzu Children's Museum''' is a private, 501(c)(3) non-profit children's museum serving ages infant through tween. The museum was established in 2006 in a store front on [[Franklin Street (Chapel Hill)|Franklin Street]] in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]]. The museum soon outgrew the location and began looking for a larger space. In November 2011, after construction delays pushed back the move to a larger space, the museum temporarily moved to University Square. Then in February 2014, Kidzu reopened in [[University Place (Chapel Hill, North Carolina)|University Place]] in Chapel Hill. They are contracted to stay in the mall through 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kidzuchildrensmuseum.org/aboutus/ourstory Our Story]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=White|first=Corinne|title=Kidzu Children's Museum rises above construction delay|url=http://www.dailytarheel.com/index.php/article/2011/09/kidzu_rises_above_construction_delay|accessdate=3 January 2012|newspaper=Daily Tar Heel|date=2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lindenfeld Hall|first=Sarah|title=Kidzu Children's Museum's opening delayed|url=http://www.wral.com/lifestyles/goaskmom/blogpost/9704001/|newspaper=WRAL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''laboratory notebook''' ([[colloquialism|''colloq.'']] '''lab notebook''' or '''lab book''') is a primary record of [[research]].  Researchers use a lab notebook to document their [[hypothesis|hypotheses]], [[experiment]]s and initial analysis or interpretation of these experiments.  The notebook serves as an organizational tool, a memory aid, and can also have a role in protecting any [[intellectual property]] that comes from the research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schnell|first=Santiago|date=2015-09-10|title=Ten Simple Rules for a Computational Biologist’s Laboratory Notebook|url=http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004385|journal=PLOS Computational Biology|volume=11|issue=9|pages=e1004385|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004385|issn=1553-7358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The guidelines for lab notebooks vary widely between institution and between individual labs, but some guidelines are fairly common, for example, like those in the reference.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Friedrich Ebel, Claus Bliefert, William E. Russey,"The art of scientific writing: from student reports to professional publications in chemistry and related fields", 2nd edition, Wiley, 2004, pp.15-20. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Aj1Filb-TvoC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=laboratory+notebook&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xKSjTZftFondgQeX_djaBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwAzgU#v=onepage&amp;q=laboratory%20notebook&amp;f=false (Google books)]&lt;/ref&gt; The lab notebook is typically permanently bound and pages are numbered. Dates are given as a rule. All entries are with a permanent writing tool, e.g., a ballpoint pen (though a [[permanent marker]] may be undesirable, as the ink might bleed through multiple pages). The lab notebook is usually written as the experiments progress, rather than at a later date. In many laboratories, it is the original place of record of data (no copying is carried out from other notes) as well as any observations or insights. For data recorded by other means (e.g., on a computer), the lab notebook will record that the data was obtained and the identification of the data set will be given in the notebook.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kühne and Andreas W. Liehr, "Improving the Traditional Information Management in Natural Sciences", Data Science Journal, 2009, 8, 18-26, [https://dx.doi.org/10.2481/dsj.8.18 DOI 10.2481/dsj.8.18]&lt;/ref&gt; Many adhere to the concept that a lab notebook should be thought of as a diary of activities that are described in sufficient detail to allow another scientist to replicate the steps. In laboratories with several staff and a common laboratory notebook, entries in the notebook are signed by those making them.

==Legal aspects==
To ensure that data cannot be easily altered, notebooks with permanently bound pages are often recommended.  Researchers are often encouraged to write only with unerasable pen, to sign and date each page, and to have their notebooks inspected periodically by another scientist who can read and understand it.  All of these guidelines can be useful in proving exactly when a discovery was made, in the case of a patent dispute.  It is worth noting however that following March 2013, lab notebooks are of limited legal use in the United States, due to a change in the law that grants patents to the first person to file, rather than the first person to invent. The lab notebook is still useful for proving that work was not stolen, but can no longer be used to dispute the patent of an unrelated party.

==Electronic formats==
Several companies now offer [[electronic lab notebook]]s.  This format has gained some popularity, especially in large pharmaceutical companies, which have large numbers of researchers and great need to document their experiments.

Lab notebooks kept online have started to become as transparent to the world as they are to the researcher keeping them, a trend often referred to as Open Notebook Science, after the title of a 2006 blogpost by chemist [[Jean-Claude Bradley]]. The term is frequently used to distinguish this aspect of ''Open Science'' from the related but rather independent developments commonly labeled as [[Open Source]], [[Open access (publishing)|Open Access]], [[Open Data]] and so forth. The openness of the notebook, then, specifically refers to the set of the following points, or elements thereof:
#Sharing of the researcher's laboratory notebook online in real time without password protection or limitations on the use of the data.
#The [[raw data]] used by the researcher to derive observations and conclusions are made available online to anyone.
#All experimental data are shared, including failed or ambiguous attempts.
#Feedback and other contributions to the research effort can be integrated easily with the understanding that everything is donated to the [[public domain]].
The use of a [[wiki]] makes it convenient to track contributions by individual authors.

'''Leonard Percival Howell''' (June 16, 1898&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/teenage/We-are-HEROES---Leonard-Howell-_8063954 We are HEROES - Leonard Howell ]&lt;/ref&gt; – February 25, 1981), also known as '''The Gong'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/Bunny-Wailer-considers-claiming-Tuff-Gong-albums_8078096 Regaining Bob Marley’s catalogue - Legal battles ahead for Tuff Gong?]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''G.G. Maragh''' (for ''Gong Guru''), was a [[Jamaica]]n [[religion|religious]] figure. According to his biographer Hélène Lee,&lt;ref&gt;See a review of ''The First Rasta - Leonard Howell and the Rise of Rastafarianism'' (Lawrence Hill Books) by Hélène Lee: [http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=504]&lt;/ref&gt; Howell was born into an Anglican family. He was one of the first preachers of the [[Rastafari movement]] (along with [[Joseph Hibbert]], [[Archibald Dunkley]], and [http://www.darcfoundation.org/robert-hinds.html Robert Hinds]), and is known by many as '''The First Rasta'''.

Born in May Crawle River, [[Jamaica]], Howell left the country as a youth, traveling to many places, including Panama and New York, and returned in 1932. He began preaching in 1933 about what he considered the symbolic portent for the [[Africa]]n [[diaspora]]&amp;mdash;the crowning of [[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles|Ras]] Tafari Makonnen as [[Emperor]] [[Haile Selassie I]] of [[Ethiopia]]. His preaching asserted that Haile Selassie was the "Messiah returned to earth," and he published a book called ''[[The Promise Key|The Promised Key]]''. Although this resulted in his being arrested, tried for [[sedition]], and imprisoned for two years, the Rastafari movement grew.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book | chapter=The Rastafarians | first=Leonard E. | last=Barrett Sr |author2=[[Helene Lee|Lee, Helene]] |title=The First Rasta: HON.Leonard Howell and the Rise of Rastafarianism | publisher=Chicago Review Press, USA | year=2005 | isbn=1-55652-558-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following years, Howell came into conflict with all the establishment authorities in Jamaica: the planters, the trade unions, established churches, police, and colonial authorities. Howell was seen as a threat largely due to the anti-colonial message of the Rastafarian movement, which he was perpetuating along with the sermons promoting the idea of a positive black racial identity. Local ruling elites were uneasy with Howell’s popular call for black people to take a stand. Colonial authorities hoped to quell Howell’s growing movement early so as to snuff out support early on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunkley|first=D.

He formed a town or commune called Pinnacle in [[Saint Catherine Parish]] that became famous as a place for Rastafari. This movement prospered, and today the Rastafari faith exists worldwide. Unlike many Rastas, Howell never wore [[dreadlocks]].

Leonard Howell died in February 1981 in [[Kingston, Jamaica]].

== Early life ==
Howell was born on June 16, 1898 in May Crawle village in the Bull Head mountain district of upper [[Clarendon Parish, Jamaica|Clarendon]] in Jamaica. He was the eldest of a family of ten children. Charles Theophilus Howell, his father, worked as peasant cultivator and tailor. Clementina Bennett, his mother, worked as an agricultural laborer.

During the [[World War I|First World War]], Howell worked as a seaman and served as part of a Jamaican contingent sent to [[Panama]]. Before temporarily settling in Panama in 1918, he travelled back and forth between [[New York City]] and Panama several times. While in New York he became a member of [[Marcus Garvey]]’s [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League|Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA)]] after being confronted with his identity as a black man in [[Harlem]] for the first time and meeting Garvey, the revolutionary UNIA leader, in person.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Howell lived abroad for a total of some twenty years in his early life, during which time he was arrested and jailed for his involvement with the UNIA because the organization's pro-black messages were viewed as threatening. After migrating to Panama and the United States, he eventually returned home in December 1932 at the age of 34 after being deported from the US.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Leonard-Percival-Howell-Genesis-Rastafari/dp/9766405492|title=Leonard Percival Howell and the Genesis of Rastafari|date=2015-09-30|publisher=University of the West Indies Press|isbn=9789766405496|editor-last=Hutton|editor-first=Clinton A.|language=English|editor-last2=Barnett|editor-first2=Michael A.|editor-last3=Dunkley|editor-first3=D. A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was deported because of his involvement with the UNIA, which was perceived as threatening by the US government, due to the organization's messages of black power and anti-colonialism. Upon returning to his homeland, he decided to leave his family home and spread the word about Rastafarianism. This decision to break away from his home was due to a conflict between Howell and his family, presumably because of his controversial belief in the divine nature of Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Charles|first=Christopher A. D.|date=2013-12-26|title=The Process of Becoming Black: Leonard Howell and the Revelation of Rastafari|ssrn=2372178|location=Rochester, NY|publisher=Social Science Research Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Howell married a woman named Tethen, whose grave in Pinnacle is said to have been desecrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reggaevibe.org/news/138-rastafari-people-defending-pinnacle-with-the-help-of-reggae-artist|title=Rastafari people defending Pinnacle with the help of Reggae artist|last=Mahddy|first=Ras|website=reggaevibe.org|access-date=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howell's eldest son is named Monty Howell&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunkley|first=D.A.|year=2013|title=The Suppression of Leonard Howell in Late Colonial Jamaica, 1932-1954|url=http://lphfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/D.A.-Dunkley-Suppression-of-L.P-Howell-NWIG-087-01-02-62-93.pdf|journal=New West Indian Guide|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very little information is available about Tethen, their marriage or other children of Leonard Howell.

== Rastafari evangelism ==
Howell’s first public articulation of the divinity of Haile Selassie occurred in January 1933. This first open deification, which proclaimed the Emperor of Ethiopia to be the incarnation of God, took place at “Redemption Ground” in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] but was not successful in gaining converts.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

In February 1933, Howell relocated his meeting to a southeastern parish of [[Saint Thomas Parish, Jamaica|St. Thomas]] and two months later, on April 18, he addressed about two hundred people at a meeting in [[Trinity Ville, Jamaica|Trinity Ville]], St. Thomas. During this meeting, police were present to monitor and control the event, which they deemed to be of a “seditious nature.” Despite concerns, authorities chose not to press charges against Howell so as not to draw extra attention to his movement and decided instead to closely monitor him.

According to Howell and his followers, Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia was the “Black Messiah” – an incarnation of God predicted by biblical prophecy. Howell believed that the grand coronation of Haile Selassie (who was widely traditionally claimed to be the descendant of [[David|King David]], [[Solomon|King Solomon]], and the [[Queen of Sheba]], in part due to the medieval Ethiopian text [[Kebra Nagast]]), was the realization of a prophecy. The grandness of the emperor's ascension to power appeared to validate Howell's imperative claim.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Howell's teachings often began with background information about the people, land, and sovereignty of Ethiopia as an unchanged land populated by original, primitive [[Christian]] people who were under direct rule of a king who was a direct descendant of King David. He idealized Ethiopia in his preaching, calling the country a land with unmatched people and a perfect language, the sole uncorrupted language on Earth. Howell emphasized the coming of a new civilization based upon and founded in the glory and power of Haile Selassie, the "Supreme Black King." He instructed his followers to adore the Ethiopian emperor as the supreme God over all of humanity. In Howell's view, it was through Ethiopia that the truths of good character, social order, manhood and womanhood were preserved and were unfolding for all to see. Howell preached that Ethiopian culture was re-emerging to overtake hegemonic [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] forces that had kept Africans enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;Niaah, Jahlani. ''Leonard Howell's Philosophy of Rasafari Manhood.''  2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Core values, leadership, and social network ==
Among his followers, Howell preferred being called Gangunguru Maragh or G.G. Maragh to distinguish his ritual, mystical personality from his secular identity. Howell’s ritual name is thought to be a combination of three [[Hindi]] words – gyan (wisdom), gun (virtue or talent), and guru (teacher). In Hindi, Maragh means "great kings" or "king of kings."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Howell used this name as a pseudonym when he published ''The Promised Key.''

In a meeting at [[Port Morant|Port Mortant]], St. Thomas, on September 1933, it is recorded that Howell held a meeting that began with the singing of hymns. Then, Howell reportedly taunted clergymen of other religious denominations at the gathering and discouraged people from attending church because “ministers were liars.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He also spoke critically of [[slavery]], claiming that “the White man stole Africa from the Africans, and that Black people should think that Africa is their home, not Jamaica”.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/First-Rasta-Leonard-Howell-Rastafarianism/dp/1556525583|title=The First Rasta: Leonard Howell and the Rise of Rastafarianism|last=Lee|first=Hélène|last2=Davis|first2=Stephen|date=2004-01-01|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=9781556525582|edition=Tra|location=Chicago, Ill.|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howell’s message of praise for Emperor Haile Selassie also came with an open call for black supremacy as a way to combat [[colonialism]] and reject oppression by whites. At times, Howell would ask his congregants to join together and sing “God Save the King” – the king being Haile Selassie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Charles|first=Christopher A. D.|date=2014-01-12|title=Racial Socialization, Black Identity Transactions, Beauty and Skin Bleaching|ssrn=2378112|location=Rochester, NY|publisher=Social Science Research Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howell’s central doctrine acted as a force against white colonial ideology due to his placement of blackness as morally superior to whiteness, as is explained in his widely read publication, ''The Promised Key''.

Howell is remembered as being a charismatic and authoritarian leader who sincerely cared about the wellbeing of his followers. In 1937, Howell founded the [http://lphfoundation.org/the-ethiopian-salvation-society/ Ethiopian Salvation Society (ESS)] whose objective was to use collective savings to better its members. A secondary purpose of the ESS was to help spread the good news about salvation and Christianity and underscore the value of self-help and good citizenship. These secondary purposes were expressly stated so as to shield the organization from suspicion that it was promoting sedition. Nevertheless, in 1940 the Jamaican governor responded to pressure from the colonial secretary and the labor leadership by officially banning a meeting of the ESS due to the resentment the organization was creating as well as its internationalization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition to his leadership role in the ESS, Howell served as a role model and father figure for the growing Rastafarian community. His audacious, generous personality, combined with his well-traveled background, made early Rastafarians particularly receptive to his messages. Howell brought “the hope of a new generation, one which was inspired by the magnificence of the new Ethiopian emperor.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

To expand Howell’s Rastafarian network, he formed relationships with other black groups such as the [[Afro-Athlican Constructive Gaathly]] and the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League|UNIA]]. Additionally he collaborated closely with other icons of the Rastafarian movement such as Marcus Garvey and [[George Padmore]], a [[Trinidadians|Trinidadian]] journalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoenisch|first=Michael|date=1988-01-01|title=Symbolic Politics: Perceptions of the Early Rastafari Movement|jstor=25090008|journal=The Massachusetts Review|volume=29|issue=3|pages=432–449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howell’s appeal for identification with Africa was in opposition to concurrent movements in Jamaica promoting a Jamaican [[creole peoples|creole]] nationalism. Howell positioned himself as an opponent of the labor nationalists [[Alexander Bustamante|Bustamante]] and [[Michael Manley|Manley]] who had gained a substantial following among the working class. Howell preached to both the working class and the peasantry in Jamaica, attempting to unite disenfranchised black people to overcome colonial oppression.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DUNKLEY|first=DAIVE A.|date=2012-01-01|title=Leonard P. Howell's Leadership of the Rastafari Movement and his "Missing Years"|jstor=43487732|journal=Caribbean Quarterly|volume=58|issue=4|pages=1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jamaica's independence in 1962 (which nevertheless maintained social, political and economic ties between Jamaica and Great Britain) was largely a disappointment for Howell, who had called for the complete severance of relations with imperial Britain.

== Trials and punishments ==
In January 1934, Howell and Robert Hinds, another pioneer of the Rastafarian movement, were arrested and charged with sedition due to their gatherings and speeches at a meeting of 300 people at [[Seaforth, Jamaica|Seaforth]], St Thomas, on December 10, 1933.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Howell was put on trial for sedition on March 13, 1934, and pleaded not guilty to openly expressing hatred and contempt for the Jamaican government and the King in addition to disturbing public peace on the island. Howell defended himself in court, using a photograph of Haile Selassie as evidence. During this historic trial, Howell is remembered as being the first person to declare that Haile Selassie was “the Messiah returned to earth.” Ultimately he was sentenced to two years in jail for sedition by the Jamaican chief justice, Robert William Lyall-Grant.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Later, in 1938, Howell was sent to a mental asylum in Kingston called the [[Bellevue Aslyum]] after being certified as insane for the inflammatory statements he published in his book ''The Promised Key''. In this publication, which was released while Howell was still incarcerated, he labeled the [[Roman Catholic Pope]] as "Satan the Devil" and created the impression that war was being declared against colonialism and white supremacy - which Howell asserted should be replaced with "Black supremacy." Furthermore, he openly objected to locally created religious systems like Revivalism and Obeah, a Jamaican folk practice. Although small, the book was powerful and very popular to the dismay of the Jamaican government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.academia.edu/9963034/D.A._Dunkley_Leonard_P._Howell_s_Leadership_of_the_Rastafari_Movement_and_his_Missing_Years_Caribbean_Quarterly_58_4_2012_1-24|title=D.A. Dunkley, Leonard P. Howell’s Leadership of the Rastafari Movement and his “Missing Years”, Caribbean Quarterly 58:4 (2012): 1-24|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As one of the most charismatic and outspoken of Rastafarian leaders, Howell was incarcerated at notably higher rates than other pioneers of the Rastafrian movement, such as [[Joseph Hibbert|Joseph Nathaniel Hibbert]] and Hinds.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Described as “the most persecuted Rastafarian to date,” Howell suffered considerably under constant state surveillance because of his Rastafarian teachings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Due to his repeated imprisonment and persecution, he suffered the blow of being absent during Haile Selassie’s 1966 visit to Jamaica.

Especially threatening to the powers that be was his prophetic call for people to destroy the legitimacy and might of the British empire and international white supremacy, a message that caused people to reconsider their for identity, agency, and socio-political mobilization in Jamaica and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Black-Heretics-Prophets-Political-Intellectuals/dp/0415943256|title=Black Heretics, Black Prophets: Radical Political Intellectuals|last=Bogues|first=Anthony|date=2003-04-06|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415943253|edition=1|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creation of Pinnacle Community ==
Following his release from prison for his teachings of black power and denunciation of colonial rule, Howell created the first Rastafarian village in Jamaica at [[Sligoville]], [[Saint Catherine Parish|St. Catherine]] in 1940. The settlement was called "Pinnacle" due to its high hilltop elevation and was symbolically located in the first free village established to house former slaves in Jamaica.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Pinnacle was one of the country’s first self-sustaining communities, its community members were able to meet their needs without dependence on outside resources. Some refer to Pinnacle as a commune, in which Howell's form of socialism was practiced.&lt;ref&gt;Price, Charles. "The Cultural Production of a Black Messiah: Ethiopianism and the Rastafari." ''Journal of Africana Religions'', vol. 2, no. 3, 2014., pp. 418-433.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after its foundation, other similar Rastafarian communities were established across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20140202/news/news41.html|title=BLACK HISTORY: Leonard P. Howell the first Rasta|website=jamaica-gleaner.com|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pinnacle was especially known for the cultivation of ganja ([[marijuana]]) that has religious significance for Rastafarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=CAMPBELL|first=HORACE|date=1980-01-01|title=Review of the Rastafari Movement in Britain, Rastaman|jstor=40795025|journal=Caribbean Quarterly|volume=26|issue=4|pages=86–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In efforts to shut down Howell and his followers, police raided Howell’s community of Pinnacle multiple times and labeled the community a "[[Communism|communist]] experiment" in 1941. Just one year after the creation of the settlement, government forces infiltrated and arrested many of Howell’s followers. After escaping immediate arrest, Howell was eventually arrested and tried once again for sedition and consequently was faced with two more years behind bars. Upon his release in 1943, he returned to Pinnacle once again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Leonard-Howell-and-the-struggles-that-he-fought_15927397|title=Leonard Howell and the struggles that he fought - News|last=Limited|first=Jamaica Observer|website=Jamaica Observer|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howell hired guards and brought in watch dogs to protect Pinnacle from future attacks.

The police raided Pinnacle several more times in the 1950s. In 1954, militia invaded the community and almost completely destroyed the village. Even after this mass destruction, settlers returned, though the settlement was never restored to its previous thriving state. During a final raid in 1958, the police cleared out the remaining residents completely. Despite its ultimate destruction, the impact of the settlement made it legendary among other settlements around the country, who were observed to have been "miniature Pinnacles."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Alleged disappearance and ongoing legacy ==
Some claim that Howell disappeared from public sight between 1958 and 1960, completely dropping out of his role as a Rastafarian leader. Accounts that he was neither heard from nor interacted with between this period and his death in 1981 have been challenged by historians who examined his life, however.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Even after the final major raid of Pinnacle and Howell's confinement in a mental asylum, he reportedly continued in his leadership of the Pinnacle community and as a Rastafari foundational role model, as evidenced by his role as a defendant in several cases at the Home Circuit Court, Kingston, regarding disputes about his ownership of Pinnacle.

Today Howell is remembered as a pioneer of the Rastafarian movement. Additionally, in honor of his values and persistent fight against colonial authority, he is seen as a leader of [[Pan-Africanism]]. To fight for his remembrance, the Leonard P Howell Foundation was created to “perpetuate and honor the memory of Leonard P Howell.”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Foundation calls for the restoration of a portion of the Pinnacle Property so that it can become a UNESCO world heritage site, an international Rastafarian worship and research center, and a monument in tribute to the vision and leadership of Leonard Percival Howell.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lphfoundation.org/about-lph-foundation/mission/|title=Leonard P Howell Foundation|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Carta-caminha.png|thumb|180px]]In his letter to [[Manuel I of Portugal]], [[Pêro Vaz de Caminha]] gives what is considered by many today as being one of the most accurate accounts of what [[Brazil]] used to look like in 1500. ''"Arvoredo Tanto, e tamanho, e tão basto, e de tanta folhagem, que não se pode calcular"'', which roughly translates as "Such vastness of the enormous treeline, with abundant foliage, that is incalculable", is one of Pêro's  most famous descriptions. He describes in a diary from the first journey from Portugal to Brazil and their arrival in this country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This letter is considered the first document of the Brazilian history as much as its first literary text.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The original of this 27-page document can be found in the [[Arquivo Nacional da Torre do Tombo]], Lisbon.

== Contextual Information ==
Manuel I ascended the throne at a time when Portugal was discovering wealth in Africa and the East; he was keen on ensuring Portugal maintained dominance in trade with the East.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=10.7722/j.ctt163tbwt.6|title=Portugal: A Traveller's History|date=2004|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn=9781843830634|editor-last=Livermore|editor-first=Harold|edition=NED - New |pages=9–36|doi=10.7722/j.ctt163tbwt.6#toc_tab_contents}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portugal has established their presence with enclaves, forts and fortified trading posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vasco Da Gama and the Age of Portuguese Expansion: AN Exhibition at the John Carter Brown Library|last=Danforth|first=Susan|last2=Fernández-Armesto|first2=Felipe|publisher=The John Carter Brown Library|year=1998|location=Rhode Island}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pedro Álvares Cabral led the largest fleet in Portuguese fleet on a mission to Calicut, India where Vasco da Gama has opened a sea route to 2 years prior.

|''"A feição deles é serem pardos, um tanto avermelhados, de bons rostos e bons narizes, bem feitos. Andam nus, sem cobertura alguma. Nem fazem mais caso de encobrir ou deixa de encobrir suas vergonhas do que de mostrar a cara. Acerca disso são de grande inocência."''
|They are brown skinned, of a quite reddish complexion, with handsome faces and noses, in such "scarved" features.  They go about naked, without clothing.  They do not bother about to cover or to uncover their bodies, and show their private parts as readily as they show their faces. In this matter they are of great innocence.
|-
| ''"... andam bem curados, e muito limpos. E naquilo ainda mais me convenço que são como aves, ou alimárias montezinhas, as quais o ar faz melhores penas e melhor cabelo que às mansas, porque os seus corpos são tão limpos e tão gordos e tão formosos que não pode ser mais!''"
| ... they take a good care of themselves and they are really hygienic. In that I am convinced they are like birds, or mountain animals, with whom the "air" (referring to refreshing hygiene habits) does better to feathers and hair than the comfort [of the lack of regular washing and grooming], because their bodies are so clean and so plump and in such nice shape that could not be better!
|-
|''"E não comem senão deste inhame, de que aqui há muito, e dessas sementes e frutos que a terra e as árvores de si deitam. E com isto andam tais e tão rijos e tão nédios que o não somos nós tanto, com quanto trigo e legumes comemos."''
|They only eat this "[[Yam (vegetable)|yam]]" (referring to the [[manioc]], then unknown to the Europeans), which is very plentiful here, and those seeds and fruits that the earth and the trees give of themselves. Nevertheless, they are of a finer, sturdier, and sleeker condition than we are for all the wheat and vegetables we eat.
|}

=== Comments on the native women, comparing them to European women ===
{|
|''"Ali andavam entre eles três ou quatro moças, bem novinhas e gentis, com cabelos muito pretos e compridos pelas costas; e suas vergonhas, tão altas e tão cerradinhas e tão limpas das cabeleiras que, de as nós muito bem olharmos, não se envergonhavam."''
|Walking among them there were three or four women, young and gentle, with their hair very black and very long, loose to their backs; their private parts, so prominent and so neat, and so clean of their hairs that we, by very much looking at them, did not get ashamed.
|-
| ''"E uma daquelas moças era toda tingida de baixo a cima, daquela tintura e certo era tão bem feita e tão redonda, e sua vergonha tão graciosa que a muitas mulheres de nossa terra, vendo-lhe tais feições envergonhara, por não terem as suas como ela."''
| One of those young women had the whole body painted, from bottom to top with that tincture, and sure she was so good shaped and so rounded, and her private part so graceful that most women in our land, if had seen those features would feel abashed for not having their own like she has hers.

=== Other ===
The admiral of the ship that sailed to Brazil sent Nicolau Coelho out to interact with the natives. The people they encountered when they arrived in Brazil lived by a mix of hunting-gathering and agriculture. They were brown and reddish-skinned and completely unclothed. Their languages were divided in four major families with many isolates, and even related languages and dialects were likely to not be mutually intelligible, so they had to communicate through actions and sign languages. They tried to give the natives things to eat such as bread, fish, cakes, honey and even wine. The natives took one taste of the things then spit them all out. They also tried to give them just water but the natives only swashed the water in their mouths, then spit it out. The one thing they did consent to was a cloak they could use to cover themselves while they slept.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

== Analysis ==
Apart from being the first ever literary description of Brazil, what sets Caminha's letter apart from other documents like it was his style of writing. Whilst writing this letter, Caminha was not trying to create a literary work but trying to report exactly what he found; it was a detailed commentary on the "customs, religion and physical characteristics of native people."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is devoid of hyperbole and does not use excessive metaphors to validate descriptions. He states things for what they are, not for what he thinks they represent.  Other early accounts of the New World emphasized on the idea of prosperity and use adjectives and hyperbole to describe the quantity and quality of its bounty.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Jerry M.|date=1991|title=Pero Vaz de Caminha: The Voice of the Luso-Brazilian Chronicle|jstor=3513430|journal=Luso-Brazilian Review|volume=28|issue=2|pages=59–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a general tone of optimism that Brazil will provide both spiritual and material gifts. He emphasizes on the "simplicity and good nature" of the indigenous people.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

=== Caminha's Opinions ===
Caminha did not describe the native Brazilians as bestial and lesser-humans as is common with other early Brazilian narratives. He does not describe them as more or less attractive than they were and seems to be particularly enthralled by their nudity and body paints. He shows "sentiments of admiration, enchantment and protectionism."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He believes that they are part of God's creation; he is respectful and understanding them that is why he calls for syncretism instead of enslavement. During the first mass, the native Brazilians responded favorably and thus, to Caminha, are worth saving because "they have no apparent trace of spiritual corruption." &lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; There is the assumption that it will be easy to convert indigenous people to Christianity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6618">This is a '''list of Keepers of the Records in the Tower of London'''. The position was medieval in origin, and ended in 1838 with the creation of the London [[Public Record Office]].

In the 16th century the distinction was made between [[Chancery (medieval office)#In England|Chancery Rolls]] from the reign of [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] onwards, which were under the direct control of the [[Master of the Rolls]], and earlier Rolls that were kept in the [[Tower of London]], with a designated Keeper. The Masters of the Rolls wished to keep at least a theoretical control over the Keepers, but until 1604 and a judgement against [[Sir Roger Wilbraham]] there was no case law to support the claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in English Official Historical Documents|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UHI8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA21|publisher=CUP Archive|page=21|id=GGKEY:K8P8U72H8CP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lost Dutchman's Gold Mine''' (also known by similar names) is, according to [[Urban legend|legend]], a rich [[gold]] mine hidden in the southwestern [[United States]]. The location is generally believed to be in the [[Superstition Mountains]], near [[Apache Junction, Arizona|Apache Junction]], east of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]].  There have been many stories about how to find the mine, and each year people search for the mine. Some have died on the search.

The mine is named after [[Germany|German]] immigrant Jacob Waltz (''c.'' 1810–1891), who purportedly discovered it in the 19th century and kept its location a secret. "Dutchman" was a common American term for a "German" ("Dutch" being the [[Names for the Dutch language#Etymology|English cognate]] to the [[German language|German]] [[demonym]] "Deutsch").

The Lost Dutchman's is perhaps the most famous [[Lost mines|lost mine]] in American history. Arizona place-name expert Byrd Granger wrote, as of 1977, the Lost Dutchman's story had been printed or cited at least six times more often than two other fairly well-known tales, the story of [[William Kidd|Captain Kidd]]'s lost treasure, and the story of the [[Pegleg Smith|Lost Pegleg mine]] in [[California]]. People have been seeking the Lost Dutchman's mine since at least 1892,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Other Lost Dutchman's mines ==
Robert Blair wrote "[t]here have been at least four legendary Lost Dutchman's gold mines in the [[Western United States|American West]], including the famed Superstition mine of Jacob Waltz".&lt;ref&gt;Blair, 21&lt;/ref&gt; One Lost Dutchman's mine is said to be in [[Colorado]], another in California; two are said to be located in Arizona. Tales of these other Lost Dutchman's mines can be traced to at least the 1870s. The earliest Lost Dutchman's mine in Arizona was said to have been near [[Wickenburg, Arizona|Wickenburg]], about {{convert|180|km|mi|abbr=on}} north-west of the Superstition Mountains: a "Dutchman" was allegedly discovered dead in the desert near Wickenburg in the 1870s alongside [[saddlebag]]s filled with gold. Blair suggested that "fragments of this legend have perhaps become attached to the mythical mine of Jacob Waltz".&lt;ref&gt;Blair, 22&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stories about the mine ==
Granger wrote that "fact and fiction blend in the tales",&lt;ref name=G99/&gt; but that there are three main elements to the story:

: "They are, first, tales of the lost [[Apache]] gold or Dr. Thorne's mine; second, tales about the Lost Dutchman's; and, third, stories of the soldiers' lost gold vein ... [t]he most complete version of the Lost Dutchman's story incorporates all three legends".&lt;ref name=G99/&gt; Blair argued that there are kernels of truth at the heart of each of these three main stories, though the popular story is often badly garbled from the actual account.  Other theories have materialized that speculate the mine is buried at the bottom of Apache or Roosevelt Lake.

In 1977, Granger identified 62 variants of the Lost Dutchman's story – some of the variations are minor, but others are substantial, casting the story in a very different light from the other versions.

=== Lost Apache gold or Dr. Thorne's story ===
In this story (actually two interconnected stories), members of the Apache tribe are said to have a very rich gold mine located in the Superstition Mountains. Famed Apache [[Geronimo]] is sometimes mentioned in relation to this story. In most variants of the story, the family of a man called Miguel Peralta discovered the mine and began mining the gold there, only to be attacked or massacred by Apaches in about 1850 in the supposed [[Peralta massacre]]. Years later, a man called Dr. Thorne treats an ailing or wounded Apache (often alleged to be a chieftain) and is rewarded with a trip to a rich gold mine. He is blindfolded and taken there by a circuitous route, and is allowed to take as much gold ore as he can carry before again being escorted blindfolded from the site by the Apaches. Thorne is said to be either unwilling or unable to relocate the mine.

==== The truth about the Peralta Mine ====
Most likely because [[Pedro de Peralta]] had been the Spanish Governor of New Mexico (in the 1600s) his family name of “Peralta” was the inspiration for a number of legends in the American Southwest. [[James Reavis]] tried to assert that the Peralta family had a Spanish land grant and a barony granted by the King of Spain, which included a huge swath of Arizona and New Mexico, including the Superstition Mountains. The [[Peralta Massacre]] is a legend that Apaches supposedly ambushed a mining expedition the Peralta family sent into the mountains. Some carved stones in the area are referred to as “[[Peralta Stones]]” and Spanish text and crude maps on them are considered by some to be clues to the location of a Peralta family gold mine in the Superstition Mountains, although others believe the stones to be modern fakes. A lack of historical records leaves uncertainty as to whether a Peralta family ever had possession of land, or mines, in or near the Superstition Mountains.

Blair insisted that the Peralta portion of the story is unreliable, writing: "The operation of a gold mine in the Superstitions by a Peralta family is a contrivance of 20th century writers".&lt;ref&gt;Blair, 87&lt;/ref&gt; A man named Miguel Peralta and his family did operate a successful mine in the 1860s – but near [[Valencia, Santa Clarita, California|Valencia, California]], not in Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, 98&lt;/ref&gt; The mine was quite profitable, earning about $35,000 in less than one year; Blair described this as "an unusually good return" for such a small gold mine to earn in such a relatively brief period.&lt;ref name=B108&gt;Blair, 108&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1975, ruins of the Peralta mine were standing.&lt;ref name=B108/&gt;

However, the Peralta Mine eventually became unprofitable and after the money was gone Miguel Peralta turned to [[fraud]]. Dr. [[George M. Willing Jr.]] paid Peralta $20,000 for the mining rights for an enormous swath of land – about {{convert|3000000|acre|km2|abbr=on}} in southern Arizona and [[New Mexico]] – based on a deed originally granted by the [[Spanish Empire]] in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, 110&lt;/ref&gt; Trouble came after Willing learned that the deed was entirely bogus. Despite his efforts, Willing was never able to recover the money he gave to Peralta. This land grant was the basis of the [[James Reavis]] Arizona land swindle (Reavis became Willing's partner and continued to try to prove the authenticity of the land grant for years after Willing's death).

Blair argued that this Peralta story (well known to Arizona residents) was eventually incorporated in the Lost Dutchman's story, in a severely distorted version, following the renewed interest in the Lost Dutchman's mine in the 1930s.

Since [[James Reavis]], "[[the Baron of Arizona]]", was convicted of fraud when the Peralta family genealogy and other documents to support the land grant (and a barony associated with that land) were determined to be forgeries it also raises questions about the original purchase of the land grant by Dr. [[George M. Willing Jr.]] (the transaction had supposedly occurred at a primitive campsite to the southeast of Prescott without the benefit of the typical documentation; instead of a [[notarized]] [[deed]], the [[conveyancing|conveyance]] was recorded on a piece of greasy camp paper bearing signature of several witnesses). Willing died in 1874 before there had been a thorough investigation of the documents or opportunity to cross examine him on the stand as was later done with Reavis.

==== The truth about Dr. Thorne ====
Another detail which casts doubt on the story is the fact that, according to Blair, there was never any Dr. Thorne in the employ of the Army or indeed of the [[Federal government of the United States|Federal Government]] in the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, 132&lt;/ref&gt; According to Blair, the origin of this story can be traced to a doctor named Thorne who was in private practice in New Mexico in the 1860s. Thorne claimed that he was taken captive by [[Navajo people|Navajos]] in 1854, and that during his captivity he had discovered a rich gold vein.&lt;ref name=B133&gt;Blair, 133&lt;/ref&gt; Thorne related his claims to three U.S. soldiers in about 1858.&lt;ref name=B133/&gt; The three soldiers set out to find the gold, but without success. Over the decades, this tale was gradually absorbed into the Lost Dutchman's story.

=== The Lost Dutchman's story ===
This tale involves two German men, Jacob Waltz (or Weitz, Weitzer, Walls, Welz, Walz, et cetera) and Jacob Weiser. However, Blair argued that there is a strong likelihood that there never was a second man named Weiser, but rather that a single person named Waltz (or a variant thereof) was, over the years, turned into two men as the legend of the Dutchman's mine evolved. Blair contended that this story can be divided into "hawk" and "dove" versions, depending on whether the German(s) are said to behave violently or peacefully.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, 11&lt;/ref&gt; In most versions of the tale, Waltz and/or Weiser located a rich gold mine in the Superstition Mountains (in many versions of the story, they rescue or help a member of the Peralta family and are rewarded by being told the location of the mine). Weiser is attacked and wounded (whether by marauding Apaches or by a greedy Waltz), but survives at least long enough to tell a man called Dr. Walker about the mine. Waltz is also said to make a deathbed confession to Julia Thomas, and draws or describes a crude [[map]] to the gold mine.

John D. Wilburn in his book ''Dutchman's Lost Ledge of Gold'' (1990), wrote that the Bulldog Gold Mine near [[Goldfield, Arizona]], fits very well the description Jacob Waltz gave as the location of his 'lost mine'. Furthermore, Wilburn stated that geology indicates that there is no gold in the Superstition Mountains, which are [[igneous]] in origin. (However, in some versions,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{IMDb title|0041610|Lust for Gold}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 'mine' is actually a cache put there by the Peraltas.)

=== Stories of the soldiers' lost gold vein ===
In yet another version of the tale, two (or more) [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] soldiers are said to have discovered a vein of almost pure gold in or near the Superstition Mountains. The soldiers are alleged to have presented some of the gold, but to have been killed or to have vanished soon after.

This account is usually dated to about 1870. According to Blair, the story may have its roots in the efforts of three U.S. soldiers to locate gold in an area of New Mexico, based on an allegedly true story related to them by Dr. Thorne of New Mexico; see above.

== The historical Jacob Waltz ==
[[Image:LostDutchman-002.JPG|thumb|right|A view of Superstition Mountains in Lost Dutchman State Park]]
[[File:Phoenix-Pioneer Military and Memorial Park-1850-Jacob the “Dutchman” Waltz.JPG|thumb|Grave of Jacob Waltz, Pioneer and Military Cemetery, west of downtown Phoenix]]

Blair cited evidence of the historical Jacob Waltz and suggested that additional evidence supports the core elements of the story – that Waltz claimed to have discovered (or at least heard the story of) a rich gold vein or cache. But Blair suggested that this core story was distorted in subsequent retellings, comparing the many variants of the Lost Dutchman's story to the game of [[Chinese whispers]], where the original account is distorted in multiple retellings of the tale.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, 75&lt;/ref&gt;

There was indeed a Jacob Waltz who emigrated to the U.S. from [[Germany]]. The earliest documentation of him in the U.S. is an 1848 affidavit in which Waltz declared himself to be "about 38 years old".&lt;ref&gt;Blair, 25&lt;/ref&gt; A man called Jacob ''Walz'' was born in September 1810 in [[Württemberg]]. Blair suggested that this Waltz could be the same Waltz who later came to be regarded as the legendary Dutchman, and that he Americanized the spelling of his family name.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, 29&lt;/ref&gt;  Note that tombstone pictured shows birth year as 1808.

Waltz relocated to Arizona in the 1860s, and stayed in the territory for most of the rest of his life. He pursued mining and prospecting, but seems to have had little luck with either. An alternate view which better fits the lost mine legend is that he periodically appeared with large amounts of gold, ''The Sterling Legend'' by Estee Conatser reports that a Jacob Walzer sold $250,000 in gold to the U.S.Mint during the 1880s and had $1500 when he died in 1891. In 1870, Waltz had a homestead of about {{convert|160|acre|km2|abbr=on}} near Phoenix where he operated a [[farm]].&lt;ref&gt;Blair, 59&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a catastrophic flood in Phoenix in 1891, and Waltz's farm was one of many that was devastated. Afterwards, Waltz fell ill (he was rumored to have contracted [[pneumonia]] during the flooding). He died on October 25, 1891, after having been nursed by an acquaintance named Julia Thomas (she was usually described as a [[quadroon]]). Waltz was buried in Phoenix at what is now called the [[Pioneer and Military Memorial Park]].

Blair had little doubt that Waltz related to Thomas the location of an alleged gold mine. As early as September 1, 1892, The ''Arizona Enterprise'' was reporting on the efforts of Thomas and several others to locate the lost mine whose location was told to her by Waltz.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, 73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn94051692/1892-09-08/ed-1/seq-2/|title=The St. Johns herald. (St. Johns, Apache County, Arizona Territory [Ariz.]) 1885-1903, September 08, 1892, Image 2|author=|date=8 September 1892|publisher=|via=chroniclingamerica.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this was unsuccessful, Thomas and her partners were reported to be selling maps to the mine for $7 each.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, 74&lt;/ref&gt;

== The death of Adolph Ruth ==
Were it not for the death of amateur explorer and [[Treasure hunting|treasure hunter]] Adolph Ruth, the story of the Lost Dutchman's mine would probably have been little more than a footnote in Arizona history as one of hundreds of "lost mines" rumored to be in the American West. Ruth disappeared while searching for the mine in the summer of 1931. His skull – with two holes in it identified as bullet holes – was recovered about six months after he vanished, and the story made national news, thus sparking widespread interest in the Lost Dutchman's mine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a story that echoes some of the earlier tales, Ruth's son Erwin C. Ruth was said to have learned of the Peralta mine from a man called Pedro Gonzales (or Gonzalez). According to the story, in about 1912 Erwin C. Ruth gave some legal aid to Gonzales, saving him from almost certain imprisonment. In gratitude, Gonzales told Erwin about the Peralta mine in the Superstition Mountains, and gave him some antique maps of the site (Gonzales claimed to be descended from the Peralta family on his mother's side). Erwin passed the information to his father Adolph, who had a long-standing interest in lost mines and amateur exploration. The elder Ruth had fallen and badly broken several bones while seeking the lost Pegleg mine in California. He had metal pins in his leg, and used a cane to help him walk.

In June 1931, Ruth set out to locate the lost Peralta mine. After traveling to the region, Ruth stayed several days at the ranch of Tex Barkely to outfit his expedition. Barkely repeatedly urged Ruth to abandon his search for the mine, because the terrain of the Superstition Mountains was treacherous even for experienced outdoorsmen, let alone for the 66-year-old Ruth in the heat of the Arizona summer.

However, Ruth ignored Barkely's advice, and set out for a two-week stint in the mountains. Ruth did not return as scheduled, and no trace of him could be found after a brief search. In December, 1931, ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' reported on the recent discovery of a human skull in the Superstition Mountains. To determine if the skull was Ruth's, it was examined by Dr. [[Aleš Hrdlička]], a well-respected [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] who was given several photos of Ruth, along with Ruth's [[Forensic dentistry|dental records]]. As [[Curt Gentry]] wrote, "Dr. Hrdlicka positively identified the skull as that of Adolph Ruth. He further stated, after examining the two holes [in the skull], that it appeared that a [[shotgun]] or high-powered [[rifle]] had been fired through the head at almost point-blank range, making the small hole when the bullet entered and the large hole when it exited".&lt;ref&gt;Gentry, 101&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1932, human remains were discovered about three-quarters of a mile (1.21&amp;nbsp;km) from where the skull had been found. Though the remains had been scattered by scavengers, they were undoubtedly Ruth's. Many of Ruth's personal effects were found at the scene, including a [[Handgun|pistol]] (not missing any shells) and the metal pins used to mend his broken bones. But the map to the Peralta mine was said to be missing.

Tantalizingly, Ruth's [[Cheque|checkbook]] was also recovered, and proved to contain a note written by Ruth wherein he claimed to have discovered the mine and gave detailed directions. Ruth ended his note with the phrase "[[Veni, vidi, vici]]."&lt;ref&gt;Gentry, 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Authorities in Arizona did not convene a criminal inquest regarding Ruth's death. They argued that Ruth had probably succumbed to thirst or heart disease (though, as Gentry wrote, "[o]ne official went so far as to suggest that [Adolph Ruth] might have committed suicide ... While this theory did not ignore the two holes in the skull, it did fail to explain how Ruth had managed to remove and bury the empty shell, then reload his gun, after shooting himself through the head".&lt;ref&gt;Gentry, 102–103&lt;/ref&gt; Blair noted that the conclusion of the Arizona authorities was rejected by many, including Ruth's family, and "those who held onto the more romantic murdered-for-the-map story".&lt;ref&gt;Blair, 97&lt;/ref&gt;

Blair wrote that "the national wire services picked up the story [of Ruth's death] and ran it for more than it was worth", possibly seeing the mysterious story as a welcome reprieve from the bleak news that was otherwise typical of the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Blair, 96&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other searches for the mine==
Throughout the 20th century, various expeditions and individuals continued to search the Superstitions for the Lost Dutchman Mine.  One of the most professional and serious-minded efforts was led by Oklahoma City private detective Glen Magill, who organized multiple expeditions in the late 60's and early 70's, and claimed on at least two occasions to have identified the location of the mine, later to concede he was either mistaken or the locations were "played out," or bereft of gold.  Magill's adventures were chronicled in the popular book "The Killer Mountains," by Curt Gentry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1142170.The_Killer_Mountains|title=The Killer Mountains|author=|date=|website=www.goodreads.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other deaths and disappearances ==
Since Ruth's death, there have been several other deaths or disappearances in the Superstition Mountains. Some searchers for the mine have disappeared in likely wilderness accidents.
* In the mid-1940s, the headless remains of prospector James A. Cravey were reportedly discovered in the Superstition Mountains. He'd allegedly disappeared after setting out to find the Lost Dutchman's mine.&lt;ref name="Kollenborn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superstition-sar.org/downloads/kollenborn_air_rescue_history.pdf |title=One Man's Dream: Air Rescue |last=Kollenborn |first=Tom |accessdate= 28 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121207133253/http://www.superstition-sar.org/downloads/kollenborn_air_rescue_history.pdf |archivedate=2012-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In his 1945 book about the Lost Dutchman's mine, ''Thunder God's Gold'', Barry Storm (pen name of John Griffith Climenson) claimed to have narrowly escaped from a mysterious [[sniper]] he dubbed "Mr. X". Storm further speculated that Adolph Ruth might have been a victim of the same sniper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

* In late 1961 George Conrad "Shorty" Mueller exalted to friends in the Phoenix area that he'd found the mine. He claimed he needed help removing the gold from the cache, and asked two friends to accompany him back into the area around Weaver's Needle. However, less than two weeks later on January 1, 1962, Shorty Mueller died of a heart attack.  
* In late November or early December 2009, [[Denver, Colorado]] resident Jesse Capen (35) went missing in the [[Tonto National Forest]]. His campsite and car were found abandoned shortly afterward. He was known to have been obsessed with finding the mine for several years and had made previous trips to the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Arizona desert searched for missing Denver man seeking gold mine| newspaper= The Denver Post|url= http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_14208899 |first= Kirk | last= Mitchell| date=January 17, 2010| accessdate=January 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Fool's Gold |first=Martin |last=Cizmar |url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2010-04-22/news/fool-s-gold-prospectors-have-looked-for-the-lost-ducthman-gold-for-a-century-but-jesse-capen-figured-he-could-find-it-he-probably-died-trying |newspaper= Phoenix New Times |date= April 22, 2010| accessdate=January 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.9news.com/news/article.aspx?storyid=130951&amp;catid=339 | title = Mother of missing treasure hunter holds onto hope| first= Cheryl | last= Preheim| date = January 2010| work = 9News.com| publisher = KUSA TV| accessdate = 25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capen's body was found in November 2012 by a local search and rescue organization, wedged into a crevice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/11/29/body-found-in-arizona-superstition-mountains-believed-to-that-missing-treasure/?intcmp=trending|title=Body of man who hunted legendary 'Lost Dutchman's' gold mine believed found in Arizona mountains|author=Joshua Rhett Miller|publisher=[[FOX News]]|date=2012-11-29|accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program ''[[Disappeared (TV series)|Disappeared]]'' covered the case (mentioning others) in the episode "The Dutchman's Curse".

It is easily accessible about 40 miles east of Phoenix via [[U.S. Highway 60]], the [[Superstition Freeway]]. Hiking and camping are popular activities. There are several paths that go through the brush and cacti. The short "Discovery Trail" is a clear route with several placards giving the natural history of the area. Serious gold prospecting is not allowed.

'''Michael Vincent Drake''' (born July 9, 1951)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LAF|id=n 86010175}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[university administrator]] and [[physician]]. In 2014, he became the current president of [[The Ohio State University]]. From 2005 to 2014, he was the chancellor of the [[University of California, Irvine]]. While UC Irvine chancellor, Drake controversially fired and rehired legal scholar [[Erwin Chemerinsky]] as dean of the then-new [[UC Irvine school of law]]. At Ohio State, Drake has been criticized for firing [[TBDBITL|the university's marching band]] director [[Jon Waters]] after a report criticized the band's "sexualized culture."

==Early years and education==
Drake grew up in [[Englewood, New Jersey]], until moving with his family to [[Sacramento, California]]. He attended [[Stanford University]] and [[UC San Francisco]].

==Career==
Drake was an [[ophthalmology]] professor and associate dean at UCSF.&lt;ref name="UCI Biography"&gt;{{cite web | author=Office of the Chancellor | title=Michael V.

===University of California, Irvine chancellorship===
In 2005, Drake was appointed as the fifth chancellor of the [[University of California, Irvine]] (UCI). He officially began his term on July 1, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=UC Regents |title=UC vice president named new UC Irvine chancellor |url=http://www.today.uci.edu/news/release_detail.asp?key=1329 |work=Today@UCI |date=May 26, 2005 |accessdate=2008-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070810085618/http://today.uci.edu/news/release_detail.asp?key=1329 |archivedate=August 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.calit2.net/newsroom/release.php?id=603&lt;/ref&gt; His annual $350,000 salary remained unchanged from his previous position at the Office of the President, up from $70,000 paid to the previous UCI chancellor.  As of 2010 he earned $374,969.32.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=The Sacramento Bee | title=State Worker Salary Search | url=http://www.sacbee.com/statepay/?name=Drake&amp;agency=&amp;salarylevel=300000 | work=University of California, Irvine | date=February 2, 2012 | accessdate=2012-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chemerinsky firing and rehiring====
{{See also|University of California, Irvine School of Law#Chemerinsky hiring controversy}}
Drake's first major firing scandal was to fire the Dean of the [[UCI law school]], [[Erwin Chemerinsky]]. After signing a contract on September 4, 2007, the hire was rescinded by UCI Chancellor Michael V. Drake, because he felt the law professor's commentaries were "polarizing"; Drake claimed the decision was his own and not the subject of any outside influence.&lt;ref name=LAT091307a&gt;Garrett Therolf and Henry Weinstein, [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-uci13sep13,1,1474059,full.story UC Irvine aborts hiring Chemerinsky as law school dean], ''Los Angeles Times'', September 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The action was criticized by both liberal and conservative scholars who felt it hindered the academic mission of the law school and violated principles of [[academic freedom]], and few believed Chancellor Drake's claims that it was not the result of outside influence.&lt;ref name=LAT091307a/&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT901307b&gt;Dana Parsons, [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-parsons13sep13,1,1694812.column Excuse for UCI's fumble on law school dean not good enough], ''Los Angeles Times'', September 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was the subject of an [[editorial]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on Friday, September 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/14/opinion/14fri3.html | work=The New York Times | title=A Bad Beginning in Irvine | date=September 14, 2007 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Details emerged revealing that UCI had received criticism on the hire from the [[California Supreme Court]]'s then-Chief Justice [[Ronald M. George]], who criticized Chemerinsky's grasp of death penalty appeals, as well as a group of prominent local [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], including Los Angeles County Supervisor [[Michael D. Antonovich]], who wanted to stop the appointment. Drake traveled over a weekend to meet with Chemerinsky in [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]], North Carolina, where he was a professor at the [[Duke University School of Law]] at the time, and the two reached an agreement late Sunday evening.&lt;ref name=LAT901707&gt;Garrett Therolf, [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-uci18sep18,0,3167475.story?coll=la-home-center Chemerinsky returns to UC Irvine post], ''Los Angeles Times'', September 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 17, Chemerinsky issued a joint press release with Drake indicating that Chemerinsky would head the UCI law school.&lt;ref name=PressRelease070917&gt;[http://www.ocblog.net/ocblog/2007/09/statement-fro-1.html OC Blog: Statement From Chemerinsky &amp; Drake&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029170502/http://www.ocblog.net/ocblog/2007/09/statement-fro-1.html |date=October 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 20, 2007, Chemerinsky's hire was formally approved by the [[Regents of the University of California]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120114011928/http://today.uci.edu/iframe.php?p=/news/release_detail_iframe.asp?key=1665 ''today.uci.edu'']&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Chemerinsky said that he and Drake had since reconciled.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/2014/jan/30/local/la-me-uci-chancellor-20140131&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ohio State University presidency===
On January 30, 2014, the [[Ohio State University]] Board of Trustees named Dr. Drake as the 15th president of The Ohio State University. He began his tenure at the university on June 30, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Background==
The employees of Euro-National devised a complicated scheme to purchase Euro-National shares that were financed by Euro-National. 

But the time under section 62(1) of the Companies Act [1955] made it illegal for a company to financially assist in the purchase of its own shares (since repealed), although there were numerous exceptions, such as financing share purchases of employees.

Whilst the Act deemed such a transaction "illegal" under the law, the Act did not expressly exclude validation as relief.

As a result, NZI sought validation of the transaction in question.

==Decision==
As the object of section 62(1) was to protect the interests of the shareholders and creditors of Euro-National, the court refused to grant validation. Richardson J stated "The deficiencies of the present arrangement cannot be categorized as procedural  or technical. They go to the heart of the proviso".

'''Footnote:''' This case is often contrasted with [[Catley v Herbert]], where a similar transaction that also contravened section 62(1) was validated

The '''''Rules of Russian Orthography and Punctuation''''' ({{lang-ru|"Правила русской орфографии и пунктуации"}}, [[Romanization of Russian|tr.]]: ''Pravila russkoj orfografii i punktuacii'') of 1956 is the current reference to regulate the modern [[Russian language]].&lt;ref name="RROP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strana-oz.ru/?numid=2&amp;article=149|title= Reforma ili novaya redaktsiya?|author=Svetlana Kuzmina |accessdate=2007-10-13|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approved by the [[Academy of Sciences of the USSR]], Soviet Ministries of Education and Higher Education, it also became the first legally fixed obligatory set of rules.&lt;ref name="RROP"/&gt; However, it became a rare book and its principles are learned from school-books and manuals based upon it.

The rules it lays down have been criticised for incompleteness in some cases. In particular, the spellings of such words as [[wiktionary:maître|maître]] (мэтр, ''metr'') or [[Racket (crime)|racket]] (рэкет, ''reket'') are given with "[[E (Cyrillic)|e]]", whereas in other rules there are three fixed words in which a [[Russian phonology|hard consonant]] is followed by "e": [[Peerage (disambiguation)|peer]] (пэр,''per''), [[mayor]] (мэр, ''mer'') and [[sir]] (сэр, ''ser''). In 1990 an attempt was made to fill the gaps in the Rules of Russian Orthography and Punctuation.&lt;ref name="RROP"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4856">'''Samuel Newman''' (May 10, 1602 – July 5, 1663) was a [[clergy]]man in colonial [[Massachusetts]] whose [[concordance of the Bible]], published first in [[London]] in 1643, far surpassed any previous work of its kind. 

Newman was born in [[Banbury]], [[Oxfordshire]], [[England]], in 1602, son of Richard Newman. He graduated from [[Trinity College, Oxford]] in 1620, took orders in the [[Church of England]]. He was prosecuted for nonconformity and emigrated to [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], probably in 1636.

After preaching nearly two years at [[Dorchester (Boston)|Dorchester]], he became pastor of the church at [[Weymouth, Massachusetts|Weymouth]], where he remained until 1643. The following year he removed with part of his church to Seconet, in [[Plymouth Colony]].  There they founded the town of [[Rehoboth, Massachusetts|Rehoboth]], which then embraced what is now [[Seekonk, Massachusetts]] and [[Rumford, Rhode Island]].  He died in Rehoboth on July 5, 1663.

Newman's famous ''Concordance'' was the third in English ever published and greatly superior to its two predecessors.  The first edition was published in London in 1643, just before Newman's removal from Weymouth to Rehoboth.  At Rehoboth, he revised and greatly improved it, using in the evening (according to [[Ezra Stiles]], a President of [[Yale University|Yale]]) pine knots instead of candles.  The second edition was published at [[Cambridge]] in 1662 and the concordance was usually known after that as the ''Cambridge Concordance''.   The concordance was reprinted at least as late as 1889, almost 250 years after it was first published.

The '''school shark''' (''Galeorhinus galeus'') is a [[houndshark]] of the [[Family (biology)|family]] Triakidae, and the only member of the genus ''Galeorhinus''. Common names also include '''tope shark''', '''snapper shark''', and '''soupfin shark'''. It is found worldwide in temperate seas at depths down to about {{convert|800|m|abbr=on}}. It can grow to nearly {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} long. It feeds both in midwater and near the seabed, and its reproduction is [[ovoviviparous]]. This shark is caught in [[Fishery|fisheries]] for its flesh, its fins, and its liver, which has a very high [[vitamin A]] content. The [[IUCN]] has classified this species as "[[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]]" in its [[Red List of Threatened Species]].

==Description==
The school shark is a small, shallow-bodied shark with an elongated snout. The large mouth is crescent-shaped and the teeth are of a similar size and shape in both jaws. They are triangular-shaped, small, and flat, set at an oblique angle facing backwards, serrated and with a notch. The spiracles are small. The first dorsal fin is triangular with a straight leading edge and is set just behind the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin is about the same size as the anal fin and is set immediately above it. The terminal lobe of the caudal fin has a notch in it and is as long as the rest of the fin. School sharks are dark bluish grey on their upper (dorsal) surfaces and white on their bellies (ventral surface). Juveniles have black markings on their fins. Mature sharks range from {{convert|135|to|175|cm|abbr=on}} for males and  {{convert|150|to|195|cm|abbr=on}} for females.&lt;ref name=Jenkins&gt;{{cite book |title=The Fishes of the British Isles |last=Jenkins |first=J. Travis |year=1958 |publisher=Frederick Warne &amp; Co. |asin=B00ABHEN6Y |pages=308–309 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FishBase&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fishbase.org/summary/Galeorhinus-galeus.html |title=''Galeorhinus galeus'', Tope shark |publisher=Fishbase.org |date=2012-07-03 |accessdate=2013-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Distribution==
The school shark has a widespread distribution and is found mainly near the seabed around coasts in temperate waters, down to depths around {{convert|800|m|abbr=on}}. It occurs in the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea, where it is uncommon and the Southwest Atlantic where it occurs between Patagonia and southern Brazil. It also occurs around the coast of Namibia and South Africa. It is present in the Northeast Pacific where it occurs between British Columbia and Baja California, and in the Southeast Pacific off Chile and Peru. It also occurs round the southern coasts of Australia, including Tasmania, and New Zealand.&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt;

==Behaviour==
The school shark is a migratory species. Animals tagged in the United Kingdom have been recovered in the Azores, the Canary Islands, and Iceland. Tagged individuals in Australia have travelled distances of {{convert|1200|km|abbr=on}} along the coast and others have turned up in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt;

The school shark feeds primarily on fish. Examination of stomach contents of fish caught off California showed that they were not fussy eaters and consumed whatever fish were plentiful at the time. Their diet was predominantly [[sardines]], [[Midshipman fish|midshipmen]], [[flatfish]], [[Scorpaena|rockfish]], and [[squid]]. Feeding is done both in open water and near the seabed as sardines and squid are [[pelagic]] animals, while the remainder are [[Benthos|benthic species]].&lt;ref name=Fishliver/&gt;

The school shark is [[ovoviviparous]]; its eggs are fertilised internally and remain in the uterus where the developing foetus feeds on the large yolk sac. Males become mature at a length around {{convert|135|cm|abbr=on}} and females around {{convert|150|cm|abbr=on}}. The gestation period is about one year and the number of developing pups carried varies with the size of the mother, averaging between about 28 and 38.&lt;ref name=Fishliver/&gt; Pups in the same litter may have different sires, possibly because females are able to store sperm for a long time after mating.&lt;ref name="School Shark, Galeorhinus galeus"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bray|first1=Dianne|title=School Shark, Galeorhinus galeus|url=http://www.fishesofaustralia.net.au/home/species/1960#summary|website=Fishes of Australia|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The females have traditional "pupping" areas in sheltered bays and estuaries where the young are born. The juvenile fish remain in these nursery areas when the adults move off to deeper waters.&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt;

==Uses==
[[Image:Cazón Adobo (Valencia).jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Cazón en adobo'']]
The [[shark meat|meat]] of the school shark is consumed in [[Andalusian cuisine]], where it is usually known as ''cazón''. Among recipes are the traditional ''cazón en [[adobo]]'' in the mainland, and ''tollos'' in the Canary Islands. In [[Mexican cuisine]], the term ''cazón'' refers to other species, and is prepared similarly. In the United Kingdom, the flesh is sometimes used in "[[fish and chips]]" as a substitute for the more usual [[Atlantic cod|cod]] or [[haddock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/faq/fishfaq1d.html |title=Can shark meat be used as food for humans? |date=2011-06-16 |publisher=NOAA: Northeast Fisheries Science Center |accessdate=2013-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826215853/http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/faq/fishfaq1d.html |archivedate=2013-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Greek cuisine]],  it is known as ''galéos'' (γαλέος) and usually is served with [[skordaliá]] (σκορδαλιά), a dip made of mashed potatoes or wet white bread, with mashed garlic and olive oil.

Before 1937, the school shark was caught in California to supply a local market for shark fillet, and the fins were dried and sold in the Far East. Around that date, laboratory tests on its liver showed that it was higher in [[vitamin A]] content than any other fish tested.&lt;ref name=Fishliver/&gt; Subsequent to this discovery, it became the subject of a much larger-scale fishery which developed as a result of the high prices obtainable for the fish and its liver. It became the main source of supply for vitamin A in the United States during [[World War II]], but was overexploited, populations were reduced, and the numbers of fish caught dwindled. Its oil was replaced by a similar product from the spotted spiny dogfish (''[[Squalus suckleyi]]'') and subsequently by lower-potency fish oils from Mexico and South America.&lt;ref name=Fishliver&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repositories.cdlib.org/sio/lib/fb/64/ |title=Fish Bulletin No. 64. The Biology of the Soupfin ''Galeorhinus zyopterus'' and Biochemical Studies of the Liver |publisher=Repositories.cdlib.org |accessdate=2013-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school shark, along with the [[gummy shark]], is the most important species in the southern Australian commercial fishery.&lt;ref name="School Shark, Galeorhinus galeus"/&gt;  It is fished throughout its range and heavily exploited.

==Conservation status==
The IUCN lists the school shark as "vulnerable" in its Red List of Threatened Species. Although it is widely distributed, it is threatened by overexploitation in many parts of its range, where it is targeted for its liver oil, flesh, and fins. It is caught primarily by [[Gillnetting|gillnets]] and [[longline fishing]] and to a lesser extent by [[trawling]]. Pups are sometimes caught inshore and some nursery areas are subject to siltation and their habitat may become degraded.

In 2010, Greenpeace International added the school shark to its seafood red list. &lt;!-- "The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries." --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=

The '''Shanghai Museum''' is a [[museum]] of ancient [[Chinese art]], situated on the [[People's Square]] in the [[Huangpu District, Shanghai|Huangpu District]] of [[Shanghai]], China. Rebuilt at its current location in 1996, it is considered one of China's first world-class modern museums.&lt;ref name="becker"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://gotheborg.com/qa/mrma.shtml |title=Ma Chengyuan and the creation of Shanghai Museum |author=Jasper Becker |newspaper=South China Morning Post |date=3 January 2001 |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Shanghai Museum exterior 5.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Exterior of Shanghai Museum]]
The museum was founded in 1952 and was first open to the public in the former Shanghai Racecourse club house, now at 325 West [[Nanjing Road]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shanghaimuseum.net/en/history/history.jsp&lt;/ref&gt; The founding collections came principally from three sources: a batch of artifacts gathered by the Communist 3rd Field Army during the civil war from accidental finds and confiscations of private property and brought to Shanghai upon the Communists' conquest of the city; artifacts confiscated by the customs service; items sold by private collectors due to political pressure during political purges and purchased by the government. The former Shanghai Municipal Museum was also merged into the new Shanghai Museum.

In the next few years, the museum's collections were further enriched from other private and institutional collections in Shanghai, including the collection of the former Shanghai Museum of the [[Royal Asiatic Society]], which were moved to the museum as "foreign" institutions gradually left the city in the 1950s. In 1959 the museum moved into the Zhonghui Building at 16 South Henan Road, which housed insurance companies and bank offices.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="museum"/&gt; During the metal-gathering campaign of the [[Great Leap Forward]], the Shanghai Museum participated in rescuing bronzeware from metal that had been confiscated or donated and were sent to be melted down. Before the [[Cultural Revolution]], a tradition formed whereby Shanghai's wealthy collectors would make annual donations to the museum.

The museum's work largely halted as a result of the Cultural Revolution. After the end of the revolution, as one of China's most important museums, the collections have continued to be enriched with the fruit of donations, government purchases, and important finds from archaeological excavations.

The growth of its collections put enormous pressure on the cramped premises. For his role in ensuring a large, purpose-built home, it is said that Shanghai Museum owes much of its current existence to [[Ma Chengyuan]], its director from 1985 until his retirement in 1999. When a new museum was omitted from Shanghai's five-year reconstruction plan in 1992, Ma lobbied Mayor [[Huang Ju]] for its rebuilding. After seeing the dilapidated rooms of the Zhonghui Building, Huang agreed to allocate a prime site on the [[People's Square]], but the museum had to raise its own building funds.&lt;ref name="becker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/15/arts/15ma.html |title=Ma Chengyuan, 77, President of Shanghai Museum, Dies |newspaper=New York Times |date=15 October 2004 |accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ma raised US$25 million by leasing the old building to a Hong Kong developer. He also made many trips abroad to solicit donations, mainly from the Shanghai diaspora who had fled to Hong Kong after the Communist revolution, raising another $10 million. The money still ran short, but he eventually won another 140 million yuan from the city government to complete the building.&lt;ref name="becker"/&gt;

Construction of the current building started in August 1993. It was inaugurated on October 12, 1996&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; to wide acclaim.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; It is 29.5 meters high with five floors, covering a total area of 39,200 m².&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

Designed by local architect Xing Tonghe,&lt;ref name="museum"/&gt; the building is designed in the shape of an ancient bronze cooking vessel called a ''[[ding (vessel)|ding]]''. It is said that the inspiration for the design was specifically provided by the [[Da Ke ding]], now on exhibit in the museum. The building has a round top and a square base, symbolizing the ancient Chinese perception of the world as "round sky, square earth" ({{zh|c=天圆地方|links=no}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhongshu|first=Zhao|date=1992-01-01|title=Round Sky and Square Earth (Tian Yuan Di Fang): Ancient Chinese Geographical Thought and its Influence|jstor=41145346|journal=GeoJournal|volume=26|issue=2|pages=149–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Collections==

'''Anti-Chinese sentiment''' or '''Sinophobia''' (from [[Late Latin]] ''Sinae'' "China" and [[Greek language|Greek]] φόβος, ''phobos'', "fear") is a sentiment against [[China]], its people, [[overseas Chinese]], or [[Chinese culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=Sinophobic]. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Online Edition. Retrieved 2012-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; It often targets Chinese minorities living outside of China and is complicated by the dilemma of [[immigration]], development of national identity in neighbouring countries, disparity of wealth, the fall of the past central tribute system and [[Minority group|majority-minority relations]]. Its opposite is [[Sinophilia]]. Factors contributing to sinophobia include disapproval of the [[Government of China|Chinese government]], historical grievances, fear of economic competition, and [[racism]]. Sinophobia also stems from older ethnic tensions, such as those related to [[Japanese nationalism]], [[Korean nationalism]], [[Indian nationalism]] and [[Vietnamese nationalism]].

==Statistics and background==
In 2013, [[Pew Research Center]] conducted a survey over Sinophobia, finding that China was viewed favorably in just half (19 of 38) of the nations surveyed, excluding China itself. Beijing's strongest supporters are in Asia, in [[Malaysia]] (81%) and [[Pakistan]] (81%); African nations of [[Kenya]] (78%), [[Senegal]] (77%) and [[Nigeria]] (76%); as well as Latin America, particularly in countries dependent on the Chinese market, such as [[Venezuela]] (71%), [[Brazil]] (65%) and [[Chile]] (62%).&lt;ref name=pewglobal&gt;http://www.pewglobal.org/2013/07/18/chapter-3-attitudes-toward-china/&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-Chinese sentiment remains permanent, however, in the West and other Asian countries: only 28% of Germans and Italians and 37% of Americans view China favorably. It is in Japan where, more than anywhere else, antipathy toward China is striking. Just 5% of Japanese have a favorable opinion of China. At the same time, outright anti-China sentiment is limited. In 2013, in just 11 of the 38 nations surveyed is China actually viewed unfavorably by at least half of those surveyed. The strongest anti-China sentiment is in Japan, where 93% see the People's Republic in a negative light, including 48% of Japanese who have a very unfavorable view of China. There are also large majorities in Germany (64%), Italy (62%) and Israel (60%) who hold negative views of China. The rise in anti-China sentiment in Germany is particularly striking:  from 33% disfavor in 2006 to 64% under the 2013 survey. And such unfavorable views exist despite Germany's success exporting to China.&lt;ref name=pewglobal /&gt;

Despite China's general appeal to the young, half or more of those people surveyed in 26 of 38 nations think that China acts unilaterally in international affairs, notably increasing tensions between China and other neighboring countries, excluding Russia, over territorial disputes. This concern about Beijing's failure to consider other countries' interests when making foreign policy decisions is particularly strong in the Asia-Pacific – in Japan (89%), South Korea (79%) and Australia (79%) – and in Europe – in Spain (85%), Italy (83%), France (83%) and Britain (82%). About half or more of those in the seven Middle Eastern nations surveyed also think China acts unilaterally. This includes 79% of Israelis, 71% of Jordanians and 68% of Turks. There is relatively less concern about this issue in the U.S. (60%). African nations – in particular strong majorities in Kenya (77%), Nigeria (70%), South Africa (67%) and Senegal (62%) – believe Beijing does consider their interests when making foreign policy decisions.&lt;ref name=pewglobal /&gt; Fifty-six per cent of Chinese think China should be more respected.&lt;ref name=pewglobal /&gt;

==History==
Anti-Chinese sentiment has long roots stretching back through a thousand years of history.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Modern anti-Chinese sentiment only dates back to the 19th century.{{cn|date=October 2018}} At the time of the [[British Empire]]'s [[First Opium War]] (1839-1842) against [[Qing dynasty|Qing China]], [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] regarded the Chinese as uncivilized and suggested that the British must attack China to show up their superiority as well as to demonstrate what a "civilized" nation could do.&lt;ref name=booksgoogle&gt;https://books.google.com.vn/books?id=SMZTCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA56-IA14&amp;lpg=PA56-IA14&amp;dq=british+sinophobia+opium+war&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=K8Puh2Hbe3&amp;sig=eCTvDxdOYUJR6Vn_XxQHqmngTxQ&amp;hl=vi&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj0uPi76-faAhWGFpQKHbF2BE4Q6AEIUTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=british%20sinophobia%20opium%20war&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; The trend became commonly popular throughout the [[Second Opium War]] (1856-1860), when repeated attacks against foreign traders in China inflamed anti-Chinese campaigns.&lt;ref name=booksgoogle /&gt; With the defeat of China in both wars, and brutal behavior of Chinese towards foreigners, [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]] upon his arrival in [[Beijing|Peking]] in 1860 ordered the looting and burning of China's [[Old Summer Palace|Summer Palace]] in vengeance, highlighting the deep Sinophobic sentiment existing in the West.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.historytoday.com/ewr-lumby/lord-elgin-and-burning-summer-palace&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1882 the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] further deepened{{cn|date=October 2018}} deep Sinophobic sentiment in the U.S., which escalated to tensions. Chinese workers were forbidden and treated as second-class citizens.&lt;ref name="yeefow"&gt;{{cite web |title= An Evidentiary Timeline on the History of Sacramento's Chinatown: 1882 – American Sinophobia, The Chinese Exclusion Act and "The Driving Out"|publisher=Friends of the Yee Fow Museum, [[Sacramento, California]]|url=http://www.yeefow.com/past/1882.html |accessdate=2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, during mid-19th century in [[Peru]], Chinese had been enforced as slave workers and they were not allowed to have any positions in the society.&lt;ref name=brown&gt;https://library.brown.edu/create/modernlatinamerica/chapters/chapter-6-the-andes/moments-in-andean-history/chinese-peru/&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the [[Empire of Japan]] was also known for strong Sinophobia. After the [[Nagasaki incident|violence]] in [[Nagasaki]] caused by Chinese sailors, it stemmed anti-Chinese sentiment in Japan and following Qing China's non-apology, it even strained further. After the end of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], Japan defeated China and soon acquired colonial possessions of [[Taiwan]] and [[Ryukyu Islands]].

Throughout 1920s, Sinophobia was still common in Europe, notably in Britain. Chinese men had been a fixture of [[London]]'s docks since the mid-eighteenth century, when they arrived as sailors working for the East India Company, importing tea and spices from the Far East. Conditions on those long voyages were so dreadful that many sailors decided to abscond and take their chances on the streets rather than face the return journey. Those who stayed generally settled around the bustling docks, running laundries and small lodging houses for other sailors or selling exotic Asian produce. By the 1880s, a small but recognizable Chinese community had developed in the Limehouse area, to the consternation of white native-born Londoners, fearful of racial mixing and an influx of cheap labor. The entire Chinese population of London was only in the low hundreds—in a city of roughly seven million—but nativist feelings ran high, as evidenced by the Aliens Act of 1905, a bundle of legislation that sought to restrict entry to poor and low-skilled foreign workers.&lt;ref name=theparisreview&gt;https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/05/05/unspeakable-affections/&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese also had to work as robbers to drug dealers.&lt;ref name=theparisreview /&gt;

At the time of [[World War II]], both [[Nazi Germany]] and Japanese Empire started its long persecution against ethnic Chinese in each countries, as well as Japanese territorial control in mainland China. Anti-Chinese massacres like [[Nanking Massacre]] that would have been the remaining key reason for the issues remaining between China and Japan today.&lt;ref&gt;https://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/odd-couple-japan-and-china-politics-history-and-identity&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Cold War]], anti-Chinese sentiment became permanent in medias of the Western world as well as anti-communist countries, largely after the establishment the [[People's Republic of China]]. Throughout 1950s to 1980s, anti-Chinese sentiment was so deep in [[Korea]], where the [[Korean War]] occurred and subsequent [[People's Volunteer Army|Chinese intervention]] against [[South Korea]]. Many Koreans claim China as perpetrator dividing two Koreas like today.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/opinion/2017/10/618_212796.html&lt;/ref&gt; In Burma, Thailand, India, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines, the Chinese were often targeted for alleged link with the Chinese Government while Australia passed [[White Australia policy]] further banning immigrants from non-white, mostly Chinese, emigrating the country.

Even in the [[Soviet Union]], anti-Chinese sentiment was so common due to differences between China and the USSR{{clarify|date=July 2018}} that it nearly resulted in war outside border conflict. The “Chinese threat” described in [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]]'s letter prompted expressions of anti-Chinese sentiment in conservative Russian [[samizdat]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com.vn/books?id=1jbHAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=anti-chinese+sentiment+soviet+union&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=81UWszLeW3&amp;sig=jBMPspOUzybzN3kgFw9MHyt8zeE&amp;hl=vi&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwil_oS98ufaAhVGnZQKHetJC844ChDoAQg4MAY#v=onepage&amp;q=anti-chinese%20sentiment%20soviet%20union&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern anti-Chinese sentiment still remains high even after the [[Cold War]], driven by Western fears of the Chinese role in communism's mission to take over the "[[Free World]]".

Since the 1990s, [[Chinese economic reform]] has made China a global power. Nonetheless, distrust of China and Chinese is attributable{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} to [[Backlash (sociology) |backlash]] against the historical memory of [[Sinicization]] pursued by Imperial China and later by the Republic of China, and to backlash against modern policies of the Chinese government, which is permanent in many countries like the United States, India, Korea, Japan and Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/26/west-understand-china-trust-xi-jinping&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese Government's claims that the Chinese rise is peaceful have been viewed with skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;

====Xinjiang====
{{see also|Xinjiang Wars|Xinjiang conflict|East Turkestan Independence Movement}}
Historically, Xinjiang is one of the most violent regions in China due to long time conflict of two different people, the majority Han Chinese and the indigenous Turkic [[Uyghurs]] in Xinjiang. Major key reasons behind increasing violence in the region is the difference of ethnicity, when the Uyghurs are follower of [[Islam]], while Han Chinese aren't; and historically, the region used to be under several rulers such as the independence Turkic Uyghur to the Chinese rulers spanned for thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-26414014&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous riots against China occurred with the establishment of the People's Republic of China includes [[Ghulja incident]] of 1997,&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9702/10/china.riots/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; or the most recent serious [[July 2009 Ürümqi riots]] leading to nearly 150 casualties in the region.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/06/china-uighur-urumqi-riots&lt;/ref&gt; This has prompted China to increase their military presence to keep the stability of that area, and it was accused for turning the region into a police state,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-china-42911468/china-xinjiang-police-state-fear-and-resentment.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tibet====
{{see also|Sino-Tibetan War|Self-immolation protests by Tibetans in China}}
Tibet has a complicated relations with China. Both countries as part of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan language family]] and share a long history. [[Tang dynasty]] and [[Tibetan Empire]] did enter into a military conflict&lt;ref&gt;https://www.historyguy.com/tibet_china_wars_conflicts.html#.W1iFKu94nIU&lt;/ref&gt; and had a major effect on the rise of Sinophobia among Tibetans. In the 13th century, Tibet fell into the rule of [[Yuan dynasty]] but it soon broke out with the collapse of Yuan dynasty. Relationship between Tibet with China remains complicated until Tibet was invaded again by the [[Qing dynasty]]. Following the [[British expedition to Tibet]] at 1904, many Tibetans look back to it as an exercise of Tibetan self-defence and an act of independence from the [[Qing dynasty]] [[Qing dynasty#Fall of the dynasty|as the dynasty was falling apart]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/10/world/asia/10gyantse.html "China Seizes on a Dark Chapter for Tibet"], by Edward Wong, ''The New York Times'', 9 August 2010 (10 August 2010 p. A6 of NY ed.). Retrieved 10 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and has left a dark chapter in their modern relations. The [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] failed to reconquer Tibet but the later People's Republic of China retook Tibet and incorporated it as [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] within China. Despite [[14th Dalai Lama]] and [[Mao Zedong]] had together signed [[Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet]], China was accused for not honoring the treaty&lt;ref&gt;https://people.howstuffworks.com/dalai-lama3.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and led to [[1959 Tibetan uprising]] which was totally suppressed by China&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thoughtco.com/the-tibetan-uprising-of-1959-195267&lt;/ref&gt; and Dalai Lama escaped to [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;http://time.com/3742242/dalai-lama-1959/&lt;/ref&gt;

Tibetans once again rioted against Chinese rule twice, the [[1987–89 Tibetan unrest|1987–89 unrest]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tibetanreview.net/herod-in-tibet/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[2008 Tibetan unrest|2008 unrest]], where they directed their angers against [[Han people|Han]] and [[Hui people|Hui]] Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;http://factsanddetails.com/china/cat6/sub32/item408.html&lt;/ref&gt; Both have been suppressed by China and China has increased their military presence in the region, despite self-immolations against China are still ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;https://freetibet.org/about/self-immolation-protests&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inner Mongolia====
{{see also|Occupation of Mongolia|Inner Mongolian independence movement}}
Inner Mongolia used to be part of [[Pan-Mongolism|Greater Mongolia]], until Mongolia was absorbed into China at 17th century following the Qing conquest. For three centuries, Mongolia was marked with little interests even during the expansion of [[Russian Empire]]. With the Qing collapse, China attempted to retake Mongolia only to see its rule fallen with the [[Mongolian Revolution of 1921]], overthrowing the Chinese rule; but it was proposed that [[Zhang Zuoling]]'s domain (the Chinese "[[Manchuria|Three Eastern Provinces]]") take [[Outer Mongolia]] under its administration by the Bogda Khan and Bodo in 1922 after pro-Soviet Mongolian Communists seized control of Outer Mongolia.&lt;ref name="LattimoreNachukdorji"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Owen Lattimore |author2=Sh Nachukdorji |title = Nationalism and Revolution in Mongolia |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=28wUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA171&amp;dq=bogda+khan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwBGoVChMIsb6ako2PyQIVi7YeCh2g0Q_E#v=onepage&amp;q=bogda%20khan&amp;f=false |publisher = Brill Archive |pages = 171– |id=GGKEY:4D2GY636WK5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, China failed to take Outer Mongolia (which would become modern [[Mongolia]]) but successfully maintained their presence in Inner Mongolia. For this reason, it has led to a strong anti-Chinese sentiment among the native Mongol population in Inner Mongolia which have rejected assimilation, which prompted Mongolian nationalists and Neo-Nazi groups to be hostile against China.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/02/mongolia-far-right&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most renown unrest in modern China is the [[2011 Inner Mongolia unrest]], following the murder two ethnic Mongolians in separate incidents.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13592514&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hong Kong====
{{see also|Hong Kong–Mainland conflict}}
Although [[Hong Kong]]'s [[Transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong|sovereignty was transferred to China]] in 1997, only a small minority consider themselves exclusively and simply Chinese. According to a survey conducted by the [[University of Hong Kong]] in December 2014, 42.3% of respondents identified themselves as "Hong Kong citizens", versus only 17.8% who identified as "Chinese citizens", and 39.3% who chose a mixed identity (a Hong Kong Chinese or a Hong Konger living in China).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hkupop.hku.hk/english/popexpress/ethnic/eidentity/poll/datatables.html |title=HKU POP releases latest survey on Hong Kong people's ethnic identity |publisher=Hong Kong University |date=22 December 2014 |accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of mainland Chinese visitors to Hong Kong has surged since the handover, reaching 28 million in 2011. The conspicuous consumption and rude behaviour of some mainlanders has upset many locals. In 2012, a group of Hong Kong residents published a newspaper advertisement depicting mainland visitors and immigrants as locusts.&lt;ref name="Juliana Liu"&gt;{{cite news |title=Surge in anti-China sentiment in Hong Kong |author=Juliana Liu |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-16941652 |newspaper=BBC |date=8 February 2012 |accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014, about 100 Hong Kongers harassed mainland tourists and shoppers during what they styled an "anti-locust" protest in [[Kowloon]].

====Japan====
{{See also|Anti-Chinese sentiment in Japan|Nanking Massacre|China–Japan relations}}

After [[World War II]] ended, the relationship between China and Japan gradually improved. However, since 2000, Japan has seen a gradual resurgence of anti-Chinese sentiments. Many Japanese believe that China is using the issue of the countries' checkered history, such as the [[Japanese history textbook controversies]], many past [[Japanese war crimes|war crimes committed by Japan's military]], and official visits to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]] (at which a number of war criminals are interred), both as a diplomatic card and to make Japan a scapegoat in domestic politics.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Forney, "Why China Loves to Hate Japan". Time Magazine, December 10, 2005. http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1139759,00.html, accessed 1 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2005 anti-Japanese demonstrations|Anti-Japanese Riots]] in Spring of 2005 also were a source of more anger towards China within the Japanese public. Anti-Chinese sentiments in Japan have been on a sharp rise since 2002. According to Pew Global Attitude Project (2008), unfavorable view of China was 84%, unfavorable view of Chinese people was 73%, the most Sinophobic perception from any other country in the world.&lt;ref name=pew&gt;[http://pewglobal.org/reports/pdf/260.pdf 24-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Survey(2008)] 35p, Pew Research&lt;/ref&gt;

====Korea====
{{See also|History of Sino-Korean relations|Northeast Project of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences|Goguryeo controversies}}

Korea has a long history of both resistance against and subordination to the Chinese empire.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com.vn/books?id=sxm3CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=Korean+historical+anti-chinese+sentiment&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=E1SeTDlHLn&amp;sig=WcSYvCFTZoCU7O1NxvpRYufGiWw&amp;hl=vi&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi60svDvr7cAhWEFYgKHSe_DIUQ6AEwC3oECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Korean%20historical%20anti-chinese%20sentiment&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/opinion/2018/07/618_212796.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the arrival of Western imperialism in the 19th century, Korea had been part of the [[Sinocentrism|sinocentric]] East Asian regional order.&lt;ref name="Gries"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Koguryo Controversy, National Identity, and Sino-Korean relations Today|author=[[Peter Gries|Gries, Peter Hays]] |url=http://www.ou.edu/uschina/gries/articles/texts/Gries2005KoguryoEAIQ.pdf |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 2000s, a dispute over the history of [[Goguryo]], which both Koreas and China claim as their own, caused tension between the two countries.&lt;ref name="Gries" /&gt;

[[File:Anti-China riot in Heijo.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Anti-Chinese riots in Pyongyang, Korea in the aftermath of the Wanpaoshan Incident]]
In 1931, while [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea was dominated by Imperial Japan]], there was a dispute between Chinese and Korean farmers in [[Wanpaoshan Incident|Wanpaoshan]], Manchuria. It was highly sensationalized in the Japanese and Korean press, and used as propaganda to increase anti-Chinese sentiment. It caused a series of anti-Chinese riots throughout Korea, starting in [[Incheon]] on July 3 and spreading rapidly to other cities. Chinese sources estimate that 146 people were killed, 546 wounded, and a considerable number of properties were destroyed {{citation needed|date=February 2017}}. The worst riot occurred in Pyongyang on July 5. In this effect, the Japanese had a considerable influence on sinophobia in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=59633 |script-title=ko:만보산사건 |publisher=Naver/Doosan Encyclopedia |language=Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in October 1950, the [[People's Volunteer Army]] fought in the [[Korean War]](1950–1953) on the side of North Korea against [[Republic of Korea Army|South Korean]] and [[United Nations]] troops. The participation of the PVA made the relations between South Korea and China hostile. Throughout the [[Cold War]], there were no official relations between capitalist South Korea and communist China until August 24, 1992, when formal diplomatic relations were established between Seoul and Beijing.

In the 1960s, South Korean laws directed against foreign property ownership, at a time when most foreign ownership was by ethnic Chinese, led to many Chinese emigrating from South Korea to Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Kim|first=Kwang-ok|chapter=Chinese in Korea|pages=688–697|title=Encyclopedia of diasporas: immigrant and refugee cultures around the world|editor-first=Melvin|editor-last=Ember|editor2-first=Carol R.|editor2-last=Ember|editor3-first=Ian A.|editor3-last=Skoggard|isbn=978-0-306-48321-9|year=2004|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-Chinese sentiments in South Korea have been on a steady rise since 2002. According to the Pew Global Attitude Project, favorable view of China steadily declined from 66% in 2002 to 48% in 2008, while unfavorable view of China rose from 31% in 2002 to 49% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;World Public Opinion surveys, 2002–2008 www.worldpublicopinion.org&lt;/ref&gt; According to polls by the East Asia Institute, positive view of China's influence declined from 48.6% in 2005 to 38% in 2009, while negative view of Chinese influence rose from 46.7% in 2005 to 50% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;East Asia Institute Foreign Perception Survey 2005–2009, some in collaboration with BBC World Service Polls 2005–2008 www.eai.or.kr&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations further strained with the deployment of [[THAAD]] is South Korea in 2017, in which China started its boycott against Korea, making Koreans to develop anti-Chinese sentiment in South Korea over reports of economic retaliation by Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.voanews.com/a/poll-shows-rising-anti-china-sentiment-in-south-korea/3775137.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Taiwan====
{{see also|Cross-Strait relations|Taiwan independence movement|Taiwanese identity}}

Due to historical reasons, the relationship between the two majority Chinese speaking nations has been tense due to the fact that China has threatened repeatedly to invade Taiwan once Taiwan declares independence from China. This creates strong divisions between China and Taiwan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34729538|title=What's behind the China-Taiwan divide?|date=3 December 2016|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further strains the relationship between two nations.

Anti-Chinese sentiment in Taiwan also comes from the fact that many Taiwanese do not want to identify themselves with Chinese people from the mainland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalia.info/new/10739/three-out-of-four-taiwanese-do-not-consider-themselves-to-be-chinese-youths-even-less-so|title=Three out of four Taiwanese do not consider themselves to be Chinese (youths even less so)|date=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are against having closer ties with the Chinese mainland, like those in the [[Sunflower Student Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/1f137b9e-b7fd-11e3-af5e-00144feabdc0|title=Thousands of Taiwanese rally against closer ties with China|work=Financial Times|date=30 March 2014|author=Jamil Anderlini}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Taiwanese also believe they are more civilized against uncivilized mainlanders, according to Peng Mingmin, a Taiwanese professor.&lt;ref&gt;https://china-journal.org/2017/02/26/civilized-taiwanese-vs-uncivilized-mainlanders-peng-mingmin-and-anti-chinese-rhetoric/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central Asia===
====Mongolia====
Mongolians traditionally hold very unfavorable views of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Billé|date=2015|title=Sinophobia: Anxiety, Violence, and the Making of Mongolian Identity}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common stereotype is that China is trying to undermine Mongolian sovereignty in order to eventually make it part of China (the [[Republic of China]] has claimed Mongolia as part of its territory, see [[Outer Mongolia]] ). Fear and hatred of ''erliiz'' ({{lang-mn|эрлийз|}}, {{IPA-mn|ˈɛrɮiːt͡sə|}}, literally, double seeds), a derogatory term for people of mixed [[Han Chinese]] and Mongol ethnicity,&lt;ref name="ttr"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Tea Road: China and Russia Meet Across the Steppe|first=Martha|last=Avery|publisher=五洲传播出版社|year=2003|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a common phenomena in Mongolian politics. ''Erliiz'' are seen as a Chinese plot of "[[genetic pollution]]" to chip away at Mongolian sovereignty, and allegations of Chinese ancestry are used as a political weapon in election campaigns – though not always with success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Mongolian Modernity and Hybridity|author=Bulag, Uradyn E.|journal=Minpaku|number=19|date=December 2004|publisher=[[National Museum of Ethnology (Osaka)]]|pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/politik/international/die_mongolen_bestimmen_einen_neuen_praesidenten_1.2618076.html NZZ: Die Mongolen bestimmen einen neuen Präsidenten] (in German): "Die Kampagne des bisherigen Amtsinhabers Enkhbayar hatte an chauvinistische Gefühle appelliert und dem Gegenkandidaten Elbegdorj mehr oder weniger direkt unterstellt, chinesische Vorfahren und damit «kein reines mongolisches Blut» zu haben."&lt;/ref&gt; Several Neo-Nazi groups opposing foreign influence, especially China's, are present within Mongolia.&lt;ref&gt;Tania Branigan, 2 August 2010, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/02/mongolia-far-right Mongolian neo-Nazis: Anti-Chinese sentiment fuels rise of ultra-nationalism], Guardian UK&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kazakhstan====
Massive land reform protests were held in Kazakhstan. Protesters were against land renting to Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-36163103 |title=Kazakhstan's land reform protests explained – BBC News |publisher=Bbc.com |date= |accessdate=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Catherine Putz, The Diplomat |url=http://thediplomat.com/2016/05/land-protests-persist-in-kazakhstan/ |title=Land Protests Persist in Kazakhstan |publisher=The Diplomat |date= |accessdate=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other issues leading to rise of Sinophobia in Kazakhstan is also over [[Xinjiang conflict]] and Kazakhstan hosting a significant number of Uyghur separatists.

====Tajikistan====
Relationship between Tajikistan and China is very complicated in the past. During 19th century, with the increasing riots within Xinjiang, [[Yaqub Beg]], a Tajik adventurer, founded [[Kashgar]]ia and declared its independence from Chinese rule, which was seen as the rebirth of Uyghur nationalism and Islamism in the region.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.siasat.pk/forums/threads/yakub-beg-ameer-of-kashgaria-the-jehadi-who-kept-china-and-russia-from-occupying-muslim-parts-o.525574/&lt;/ref&gt; China was accused of secretly arming the [[Taliban]] which was formed by dominant [[Pashtuns]] against the majority Tajik-backed [[Northern Alliance]] in [[Afghanistan]], as it took place even before [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;https://rense.com/general26/chintel.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/anderscorr/2017/02/21/sanction-china-for-its-support-of-taliban-terrorists/#3fb05cab4060&lt;/ref&gt;

Resentment against China and Chinese also increased in Tajikistan recent years due to accusation of China's land grab from Tajikistan.&lt;ref&gt;https://eurasianet.org/s/tajikistan-chinas-advance-causing-increasing-unease-among-tajiks&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Tajik Popular Social-Democrat Party leader, Rakhmatillo Zoirov, claimed Chinese troops were entering to Tajikistan deeper than it got from land ceding.&lt;ref&gt;http://enews.fergananews.com/news.php?id=2561&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kyrgyzstan====
Kyrgyzstan is traditionally non-aligned and somewhat positive of China. There are historical grievances, however, such as occupation by Qing China, ethnic cleansing.  A Kyrgyz farmer claimed "''We always run the risk of being colonized by the Chinese,''", in fear of future being colonized by China.&lt;ref name=atimes&gt;http://www.atimes.com/article/hopes-fears-peoples-silk-road-krygyzstan/&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, same like majority Central Asian nations, Kyrgyz people mostly sympathize with Uyghur separatism in China, further complicated relations.&lt;ref name=atimes /&gt;

====Afghanistan====
The [[Taliban]], which once controlled almost Afghanistan for five years was secretly supported and financed by China through [[Pakistan]], China's long time ally, and the secret tie continues even after Taliban was overthrown in 2001. This has sparked a Sinophobic sentiment among Afghans.&lt;ref&gt;https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/08/03/chinas-man-in-the-taliban-mullah-omar/&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the [[Xinjiang conflict]] even strained the relations between Afghanistan and China.&lt;ref&gt;https://thediplomat.com/2014/12/sinophilia-and-sinophobia-in-afghanistan/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Abdul Jabar Qahraman, military operations chief in volatile [[Helmand]] province, blamed China for supporting Taliban terrorists with weaponry in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;https://ariananews.af/china-supporting-taliban-in-helmand/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Singapore====
To counteract the city state's low birthrate, Singapore's government has been offering financial incentives and a liberal visa policy to attract immigrants. The policy has nearly doubled Singapore's population since 1990. Many of the newcomers are from China, although about half are from Southeast Asia. The immigrants are blamed for competing with the native-born Singaporeans for jobs and housing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/27/world/asia/in-singapore-vitriol-against-newcomers-from-mainland-china.html New York Times: In Singapore, Vitriol Against Chinese Newcomers]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Malaysia====
Due to race-based politics and [[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|Bumiputera]] policy, there had been several incidents of racial conflict between the Malays and Chinese before the 1969 riots.  For example, in Penang, hostility between the races turned into violence during the centenary celebration of [[George Town, Penang|George Town]] in 1957 which resulted in several days of fighting and a number of deaths,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UwA1aaB2WGgC&amp;pg=PA275&amp;lpg=PA275#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Deadly Ethnic Riot|author= Donald L. Horowitz |publisher=University of California Press |year= 2003 |page=275 |isbn=978-0520236424 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there were further disturbances in 1959 and 1964, as well as a riot in 1967 which originated as a protest against currency devaluation but turned into racial killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://penangmonthly.com/penangs-forgotten-protest-the-1967-hartal/ |date=August 25, 2014 |title=Penang's forgotten protest: The 1967 Hartal |work=Penang Monthly }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UwA1aaB2WGgC&amp;pg=PA255&amp;lpg=PA255#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Deadly Ethnic Riot|author= Donald L.

The [[13 May Incident]] probably the highest race riot happen in Malaysia with more than 143 or suggested 600 killed, mostly are Chinese.

The conflict fueled discrimination against and consequent emigration by the country's [[Hoa people|ethnic Chinese]]. From 1978 to 1979, some 450,000 ethnic Chinese left [[Vietnam]] by boat (mainly former South Vietnam citizens fleeing the Vietcong) as [[refugee]]s or were expelled across the land border with China.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, Kevin.

According to journalist Daniel Groos, Sinophobia is omnipresent in modern Vietnam, where "from school kids to government officials, China-bashing is very much in vogue." According to Groos a majority of Vietnamese resent the import and usage of Chinese products, considering them distinctly low status.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Daniel.

====Laos====
In [[Laos]], anti-Chinese sentiment is frequently associated with Chinese businesses that are perceived to be responsible for destroying or 'stealing' the country's natural resources, or which are responsible for the relocation of citizens from their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asian-power.com/project/more-news/chinese-firm-heeds-protests-stop-cambodian-hydro-projects|title=Chinese firm heeds protests to stop Cambodian hydro projects|work=Asian Power|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cambodia====
{{see also|Chinese Cambodians|Cambodia–China relations}}

During the late 1960s an estimated 425,000 ethnic Chinese lived in [[Cambodia]]. By 1984, as a result of the [[Khmer Rouge]] genocide and emigration, only about 61,400 Chinese remained in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/genocide/g_cambodia1.html|title=GENOCIDE –  CAMBODIA|publisher=|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genocidewatch.org/aboutgenocide/stantoncambodianlaw.htm The Cambodian Genocide and International Law]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-studies.com/cambodia/the-chinese.html|title=Cambodia the Chinese|publisher=|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hatred for Chinese was projected on the ethnic Chinese of Cambodia during 80s. A Vietnamese report had noted "In general, the attitude of young people and intellectuals is that they hate Cambodian-Chinese."&lt;ref&gt;"Cambodia after the Khmer Rouge: inside the politics of nation building", p. 174, by Evan Gottesman&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philippines====
{{see also|Chinese Filipino|China–Philippines relations}}

The Spanish introduced the first anti-Chinese laws in the Philippine archipelago. The Spanish massacred or expelled Chinese several times from Manila, and the Chinese responded by fleeing to the [[Sulu Sultanate]] and supporting the [[Moro people|Moro Muslims]] in their war against the Spanish. The Chinese supplied the Moros with weapons and joined them in fighting the Spanish directly during the [[Spanish–Moro conflict]].

The [[Spratly Islands dispute|standoff]] in [[Spratly Islands]] and [[Scarborough Shoal]] between China and the [[Philippines]] contributes to anti-China sentiment among Filipinos. Campaigns to boycott Chinese products began in 2012. People protested in front of the Chinese Embassy and it had led the Chinese embassy to issue travel warning for its citizens to the Philippines for a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thediplomat.com/2014/09/china-warns-citizens-to-stay-away-from-philippines/|work=The Diplomat|author=Shannon Tiezzi|title=China Warns Citizens to Stay Away From Philippines|date=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indonesia====
{{see also|Discrimination against Chinese Indonesians}}
The Dutch introduced anti-Chinese laws in the Dutch East Indies. The Dutch colonialists started the first massacre of Chinese in the [[1740 Batavia massacre]] in which tens of thousands died.  The [[Java War (1741–43)]] followed shortly thereafter.

In the 18th century, [[Qing dynasty]] China attempted to conquer Myanmar in [[Sino-Burmese War (1765–69)|four failed invasions]].{{source?|date=September 2018}}

The infamous [[1967 anti-Chinese riots in Myanmar|1967 riots]] in Burma against Chinese community had sparked angers among Chinese, led to the arming of ethnic and political rebels by China against Burma.

====Bhutan====
The relation between [[Bhutan]] and China has historically been tense and past events have led to anti-Chinese sentiment within the country. Notably the Chinese government's destruction of Tibetan Buddhist institutions in Tibet in 1959 led to a wave of anti-Chinese sentiment in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TOVaMckcO0MC&amp;pg=PA176&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=anti+china+sentiment+in+Bhutan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oYuUSOIbDz&amp;sig=Or9TcBeB-PoXxFgwOT37L4DLqmc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwislt6XrYzKAhXBxqYKHVc8Df0Q6AEIITAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Protracted Contest: Sino-Indian Rivalry in the Twentieth Century – John W.

Anti-Chinese sentiment in Sri Lanka rises mainly due to the unclean Chinese investments in Sri Lanka, notably the lease of [[Hambantota]] Port for China, which was believed to be a new Chinese colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-38541673|work=BBC|title=Sri Lanka protest over Chinese investment turns ugly|date=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/wadeshepard/2017/01/08/violent-protests-against-chinese-colony-in-hambantota-sri-lanka-rage-on/|work=Forbes|title=Violent Protests Against Chinese 'Colony' In Sri Lanka Rage On|author=Wade Shephard|date=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bangladesh====
{{main|Bangladesh–China relations}}
During the 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation War]], China supported [[Pakistan]], its long-standing ally, against Bangladesh and [[India]]. In the following years until 1976, Bangladesh and China were at odd due to hostility between two nations. Thus, anti-Chinese sentiment remains deep and high in Bangladesh due to the historical grievances.&lt;ref name=dhakatribune&gt;https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/2017/10/27/which-favours-china-bangladesh/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Honiara]]'s Chinatown suffered damage when it was looted and burned by rioters following a contested election. Ethnic Chinese businessmen were falsely blamed for bribing members of the [[Solomon Islands]]' Parliament.

Russia and China no longer have territorial disputes and China does not claim land in Russia, however, there is also a perceived fear of a demographic takeover by Chinese immigrants in sparsely populated Russian areas.&lt;ref name="AFPC_russiansfear"&gt;{{cite web|last=Santoli|first=Al|title=Russian far east residents fear takeover by China; Sino-Russian "strategic cooperation" pact aimed at US|work=|publisher=[[American Foreign Policy Council]]|date=2001-01-29|url=http://www.afpc.org/crm/crm357.shtml |doi=|accessdate=2008-03-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071116171806/http://www.afpc.org/crm/crm357.shtml &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dawn_russiansfear"&gt;{{cite news|first=Peter |last=Baker |pages= |title=Russians fear Chinese 'takeover' of Far East regions |date=2003-08-02 |publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |url=http://www.dawn.com/2003/08/02/int7.htm |accessdate=2008-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116195122/http://www.dawn.com/2003/08/02/int7.htm |archivedate=November 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Turkey====
Anti-Chinese sentiment in Turkey has been a strong factor, due to historical issues between two countries, remains. Despite far away thousand miles, in the past, the Turkic peoples, from the [[Göktürks]] to the [[Uyghurs]], had often fought against Imperial China.

In 2009, following the riots in Ürümqi, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan claimed "''The martyrs of East Turkestan are our martyrs,''" and criticized China for the suppression of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, which inflamed tensions between China and Turkey for a year.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/f30ddb40-709c-11de-9717-00144feabdc0&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 4, 2015, a group of around 2,000 [[Turkish nationalism|Turkish nationalists]] from the Grey Wolves linked to MHP protesting against [[China]]'s fasting ban in Xinjiang mistakenly attacked [[Koreans|South Korean]] [[tourists]] in Istanbul,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=VIDEO: Turkish nationalists protesting China attack Korean tourists in Istanbul |work=[[Hurriyet Daily News]] |date=4 July 2015 |agency=Doğan News Agency |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-nationalists-protesting-china-attack-korean-tourists-in-istanbul.aspx?PageID=238&amp;NID=84972&amp;NewsCatID=338}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Turks protesting against China attack Koreans 'by mistake' |work=[[Malay Mail]] |date=5 July 2014 |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/world/article/turks-protesting-against-china-attack-koreans-by-mistake}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to China issuing a [[travel warning]] to its citizens [[traveling]] to [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/05/us-china-turkey-idUSKCN0PF08L20150705 |title=China says tourists attacked in Turkey during anti-China protests |publisher=Reuters |date=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Uyghur employee at a Chinese restaurant was beaten by the Turkish Grey Wolves-linked protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ivan |last=Plis |title=Turks Protesting China Pick Random Chinese Restaurant, Trash It  |work=Daily Caller |date=30 June 2015 |url=http://dailycaller.com/2015/06/30/turks-protesting-china-pick-random-chinese-food-restaurant-trash-it/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event negatively impacted [[China–Turkey relations]].&lt;ref name="aa"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aa.com.tr/en/world/550973--beijing-troubled-by-turkish-anti-china-protests |title=Beijing troubled by Turkish anti-China protests |publisher=Anadolu Agency |date=7 June 2015 |accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Devlet Bahçeli]], a leader from Turkey's MHP ([[Nationalist Movement Party]]), said that the attacks by MHP affiliated Turkish youth on South Korean tourists was "understandable", telling the Turkish news paper Hurriyet that: "What feature differentiates a Korean from a Chinese? They see that they both have slanted eyes. How can they tell the difference?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lefevre  |first1= Amy Sawitta  |last2=Dikmen  |first2=Yesim |date= 9 Jul 2015|title=Thai PM defends decision to send Uighurs back to China |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/09/us-thailand-uighurs-turkey-idUSKCN0PJ18620150709 |newspaper= Reuters |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another translation of his remarks was : "What is the difference between a Korean and a Chinese anyway?

====Azerbaijan====
Due to sharing a similar history with Turkey for being common Turkic root, Sinophobia is also omnipresent in Azerbaijan. In 2009, following the riots in Xinjiang, Azerbaijan was one of the first country to cover about the riots, stemming Sinophobia within Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;http://regionplus.az/az/articles/view/4040&lt;/ref&gt; Azerbaijan is also noted for supporting several pan-Turkist separatist groups, such as [[Southern Azerbaijan National Awakening Movement]] (SANAM) which have strong tie with East Turkestan Independence Movement. [[Mahmudali Chehreganli]], leader of SANAM and [[Rebiya Kadeer]], leader of ETIM, underlined that South Azerbaijan and East Turkestan will act jointly in struggling against each other's enemies and said Iranian or Chinese governments will never prevent the Turks of South Azerbaijan and East Turkestan from struggling, expressed their confidence that 35 million Turks of South Azerbaijan and more than 20 million Uyghur Turks will be soon liberated.&lt;ref&gt;http://unpo.org/article/15150&lt;/ref&gt;

====Syria====
Although Sinophobia is not widely practiced in Syria, the [[Syrian opposition]] has accused China for supporting the Government of [[Bashar al-Assad]] as China has vetoed UN resolutions condemning Assad's war crimes; Syrian and Lebanese nationalists have burnt Chinese flag in response.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ibtimes.com/china-will-not-protect-any-party-syria-violence-410420&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western world and Latin America===

[[File:Yellow peril rupert.jpg|thumb|Cover of the third edition of [[G. G. Rupert]]'s ''The Yellow Peril'', depicting [[Uncle Sam]] engaged in a sword fight with a stereotypical pigtailed Chinese warrior.]]
Like China's perception in other countries, China's large population, long history and size has been the subject of fear somewhat. China has figured in the [[Western world|Western]] imagination in a number of different ways as being a very large civilization existing for many centuries with a very large population; however the rise of the [[People's Republic of China]] after the [[Chinese Civil War]] has dramatically changed the perception of China from a relatively positive light to negative because of the fear of [[communism]] in the West, and repeated public accusations against China of human rights abuses.

Sinophobia became more common as China was becoming a major source of immigrants for the west (including the [[American West]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History|first=Michael|last=Kazin|authorlink=Michael Kazin|first2=Rebecca|last2=Edwards|first3=Adam|last3=Rothman|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=2010|title=Immigration Policy|quote=Compared to its European counterparts, Chinese immigration of the late nineteenth century was minuscule (4 percent of all immigration at its zenith), but it inspired one of the most brutal and successful nativist movements in U.S. history. Official and popular racism made Chinese newcomers especially vulnerable; their lack of numbers, political power, or legal protections gave them none of the weapons that enabled Irish Catholics to counterattack nativists.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous Chinese immigrants to North America were attracted by wages offered by large railway companies in the late 19th century as the companies built the [[transcontinental railroad]]s.

Sinophobic policies (such as the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]], the [[Chinese Immigration Act of 1923]], anti-Chinese [[zoning]] laws and [[restrictive covenant]]s, the policies of [[Richard Seddon]], and the [[White Australia policy]]) and pronouncements on the "[[yellow peril]]" were in evidence as late as the mid-20th century in the [[Australia]], [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[New Zealand]].

====Italy====
{{See also|Sino-Roman relations}}
Although historical relations between two were friendly and even [[Marco Polo]] paid a visit to China, during the [[Boxer Rebellion]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] was part of [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] against the rebellion, thus this had stemmed anti-Chinese sentiment in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;https://dailyhistory.org/How_did_the_Boxer_Rebellion_unite_Imperial_Powers_and_create_Chinese_Nationalism%3F&lt;/ref&gt; Italian troops looted, burnt and stole a lot of Chinese goods to Italy, whom many are still being displayed in Italian museums.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com.vn/books?id=1fOmBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=boxer+rebellion+italia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d9UsiuBrMI&amp;sig=Dz1PIUGN1zALn2tLog1peyrOqko&amp;hl=vi&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjtifa1-8DcAhXDdN4KHQW4AB84ChDoATAIegQIBxAB#v=onepage&amp;q=boxer%20rebellion%20italia&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern era, Sinophobia still exists in Italy. In 2007, an anti-Chinese unrest occurred when Italian residents of [[Milan]] and [[Rome]] had complained that, as Chinese neighbourhoods expand, Italian stores are being squeezed out by merchants who obtain licences for retail shops but then open up wholesale distribution operations for goods flooding in from China.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/apr/13/italy.tomkington&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Italian town of [[Prato]] became increasingly anti-Chinese, accusing them for not obeying Italian law.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.voanews.com/a/ancient-italian-town-turns-against-chinese-migrants-105597568/128777.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Venezuela====
A recent increasing Sinophobic sentiment sparked in [[Venezuela]] as for the direct consequence of [[Crisis in Venezuela (2012–present)|Venezuelan crisis]], which China was accused for looting and exploiting Venezuelan natural resources and economic starvation in the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.postwesternworld.com/2015/12/10/whats-venezuela-sinophobia/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Australia====
{{See also|History of Chinese Australians}}
The Chinese population was active in political and social life in [[Australia]]. Community leaders protested against discriminatory legislation and attitudes, and despite the passing of the Immigration Restriction Act in 1901, Chinese communities around Australia participated in parades and celebrations of Australia's Federation and the visit of the Duke and Duchess of York.

Although the Chinese communities in Australia were generally peaceful and industrious, resentment flared up against them because of their different customs and traditions. In the mid-19th century, terms such as "dirty, disease ridden, [and] insect-like" were used in Australia and New Zealand to describe the Chinese.&lt;ref name="reviewofEbySouth"&gt;{{cite web|last=Young|first=Jason|title=Review of East by South: China in the Australasian Imagination|work=|publisher=[[Victoria University of Wellington]]|url=http://www.victoria.ac.nz/atp/bookreviews/Young_07.doc|format=[[DOC (computing)|.doc]]|doi=|accessdate=2008-03-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414023129/http://www.victoria.ac.nz/atp/bookreviews/Young_07.doc|archivedate=2008-04-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A poll tax was passed in Victoria in 1855 to restrict Chinese immigration. New South Wales, Queensland, and Western Australia followed suit. Such legislation did not distinguish between naturalised, British citizens, Australian-born and Chinese-born individuals. The tax in Victoria and New South Wales was repealed in the 1860s,

In the 1870s and 1880s, the Growing [[Australian labour movement|trade union]] movement began a series of protests against foreign labour. Their arguments were that Asians and Chinese took jobs away from white men, worked for "substandard" wages, lowered working conditions and refused unionisation.&lt;ref name="Markey"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these objections to restricting immigration, between 1875 and 1888 all Australian colonies enacted legislation which excluded all further Chinese immigration.&lt;ref name="Griffiths" /&gt; Asian immigrants already residing in the Australian colonies were not expelled and retained the same rights as their Anglo and Southern compatriots.

In 1888, following protests and strike actions, an inter-colonial conference agreed to reinstate and increase the severity of restrictions on Chinese immigration. This provided the basis for the 1901 Immigration Restriction Act and the seed for the [[White Australia Policy]], which although relaxed over time, was not fully abandoned until the early 1970s.

Number of cases have been reported, related to Sinophobia in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/chinese-students-at-risk-in-australia-20120426-1xn5v.html|title=China Outrage Over Sydney Train Assault|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, on February 2013, a Chinese football team had reported about the abuses and racism they suffered on Australia Day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/chinese-aussie-rules-players-suffer-abuse-racism/story-e6frf7kx-1226583002494 Chinese Aussie rules players suffer abuse, racism], ''Herald Sun''&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a spate of racist anti-Chinese graffiti and posters in universities across [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]] which host a large number of Chinese students. In July and August 2017, hate-filled posters were plastered around [[Monash University]] and [[University of Melbourne]] which said, in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], that Chinese students were not allowed to enter the premises, or else they would face deportation, while a “kill Chinese” graffiti, decorated with swastikas was found at [[University of Sydney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-07-25/offensive-flyers-removed-from-melbourne-university-building/8741820 | title=Offensive flyers targeting Chinese students found at Melbourne universities | date=25 July 2017 | author=Lord, Kathy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/chinese-social-media-outraged-by-racist-graffiti-at-sydney-university/news-story/f0ac109ff239a2471e3a3f70c8c3fc13 | title=Chinese social media outraged by racist graffiti at Sydney University | date=2 August 2017 | author=Riordan, Primrose}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Antipodean Resistance]], a white supremacist group that identifies itself as pro-Nazi, claimed responsibility for the posters on Twitter.

====Germany====
{{See also|Persecution of Chinese people in Nazi Germany}}

In 2016, [[Günther Oettinger]], the former [[European Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society]], called Chinese people derogatory names, including "sly dogs," in a speech to executives in [[Hamburg]] and had refused to apologize for several days.&lt;ref&gt;https://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/11/05/2016/germany-defends-itself-against-chinese-ma-onslaught&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spain====
Spain first issued anti-Chinese sentiment when [[Limahong]], a renown Chinese pirate, attacked Spanish settlement in the [[Philippines]]. One of his famous actions was a failed [[Battle of Manila (1574)|invasion of Manila]] at 1574, with the supports of Chinese and Moro pirates.&lt;ref&gt;https://kahimyang.com/kauswagan/articles/1319/the-story-of-limahong-and-his-failed-attempt-to-conquer-manila-in-1574&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish conquistadors massacred or expelled Chinese several times from Manila, notably the 1603 massacre of Chinese in Manila in autumn with the reasons for this uprising remain unclear. The motives range from the desire of the Chinese to dominate Manila, to their wanting to abort the Spaniards' moves that seemed to lead to their elimination. The Spaniards quelled the rebellion and massacred around 20,000 Chinese.The Chinese responded by fleeing to the [[Sulu Sultanate]] and supporting the Moro Muslims in their war against the Spanish. The Chinese supplied the Moros with weapons and joined them in fighting the Spanish directly during the [[Spanish–Moro conflict]]. Spain also upheld a plan to conquer China, thus never materialized.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.samuelhawley.com/imjinarticle3.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern era, anti-Chinese racism remains relevant in Spain. In 2014, Spanish channel Telecinco's "Aida" programme featured a scene in which a bar owner adds "and no Chinese either" to a sign barring dogs from his establishment, leading to sheer criticisms from China.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thelocal.es/20140522/china-slams-spanish-tv-show-over-racist-sign&lt;/ref&gt;

====Peru====
{{See also|Chinese Peruvians|China–Peru relations}}

Peru was a popular destination for Chinese immigrants at 19th century, mainly due to its vulnerability over slave market and subsequent needed for Peru over military and laborer workforce. However, relations between Chinese workers and Peruvian owners have been tense, due to mistreatments over Chinese laborers and anti-Chinese discrimination in Peru.&lt;ref name=brown /&gt;

Due to the Chinese support for [[Chile]] throughout the [[War of the Pacific]], relations between [[Peruvians]] and Chinese became increasingly tenser aftermath. After the war, armed [[indigenous peoples in Peru|indigenous]] peasants sacked and occupied [[hacienda]]s of landed elite [[criollo people|criollo]] "collaborationists" in the central Sierra – majority of them were of ethnic Chinese, while indigenous and [[mestizo]] Peruvians murdered Chinese shopkeepers in Lima in response to Chinese [[coolie]]s revolted and even joined the Chilean Army.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;Taylor, Lewis.

''[[Past &amp; Present (journal)|Past and Present]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Even in 20th century, memory of Chinese supports for Chile was so deep that [[Manuel A. Odría]], once dictator of Peru, issued ban against Chinese immigration as a punishment for their betrayal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.vn/books?id=OP-EBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=sinophobia+peru&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hJsiEwA8Xe&amp;sig=LVE_M83bDe-Mm2igEeTSldf_O4I&amp;hl=vi&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj4_L72g-vaAhWJurwKHb1ZBrIQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=sinophobia%20peru&amp;f=false/ Dragons in the Land of the Condor: Writing Tusán in Peru]&lt;/ref&gt; This caused a deep wound still relevant today in Peru.

====Canada====
{{See also|History of Chinese immigration to Canada}}

In the 1850s, sizable numbers of Chinese immigrants came to [[British Columbia]] seeking gold; the region was known to them as [[Gold Mountain (Chinese name for part of North America)|Gold Mountain]]. Starting in 1858, [[China|Chinese]] "[[coolies]]" were brought to Canada to work in the mines and on the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]. However, they were denied by law the rights of citizenship, including the right to vote, and in the 1880s, "[[tax per head|head taxes]]" were implemented to curtail immigration from China. In 1907, a riot in [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]] targeted Chinese and Japanese-owned businesses. In 1923, the federal government passed the ''[[Chinese Immigration Act of 1923|Chinese Immigration Act]]'', commonly known as the ''Exclusion Act'', prohibiting further Chinese immigration except under "special circumstances". The Exclusion Act was repealed in 1947, the same year in which [[Chinese Canadian]]s were given the right to vote. Restrictions would continue to exist on immigration from Asia until 1967, when all racial restrictions on [[immigration to Canada]] were repealed, and Canada adopted the current points based immigration system. On June 22, 2006, Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] offered an apology and compensation only for the head tax once paid by Chinese immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Canada| authorlink=Office of the Prime Minister (Canada)| year=2006| url=http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?category=2&amp;id=1220/| title=Address by the Prime Minister on the Chinese Head Tax Redress| publisher=Government of Canada| accessdate=2006-08-08| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/673FgoIBG?url=http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?category=2&amp;id=1220/| archivedate=2012-04-19| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Survivors or their spouses were paid approximately CAD$20,000 in compensation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sympaticomsn.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060621/head_tax_060622 Sympatico / MSN : News : CTV.ca: PM apologizes in House of Commons for head tax] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220085617/http://sympaticomsn.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060621/head_tax_060622 |date=2012-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sinophobia in Canada has been fueled by extreme real estate price distortion resulting from Chinese demand, forcing locals out of the market.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.richmond-news.com/news/anti-chinese-sentiment-partly-governments-fault-steves-1.3144628&lt;/ref&gt;

====Brazil====
There is a growing Sinophobic sentiment in Brazil, largely due to the issue over economic and political manipulation from China over Brazil. Recently, Chinese have been accused for grabbing land in Brazil, involving on unclean political ties, further deepens Sinophobia in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.postwesternworld.com/2012/02/04/can-brazil-learn-to-manipulate-china/&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese investments in Brazil have been largely influenced by this negative impression.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14747731.2017.1377374?src=recsys&amp;journalCode=rglo20&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
{{See also|British Chinese|China–United Kingdom relations|Opium Wars}}
The United Kingdom developed a strong Sinophobic sentiment dated back at 1800s when China and the [[British Empire]] fought for influence in Asia. It resulted with the [[First Opium War]] which [[Qing dynasty|Qing China]] suffered a tremendous defeat and forced to pay fee.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nam.ac.uk/explore/opium-war-1839-1842&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, due to strong anti-British sentiment in China, anti-Chinese sentiment grew in the U.K. as a response. Such negative impression on China was exported to the world mainly due to the British.

Today, negative impression over China continues to be an issue in the United Kingdom. The Chinese emigrants in Britain often issued themselves to be among the most discriminated people,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/19/chinese-community-reports-highest-proportion-of-racial-harassment-in-britain&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a lack of reporting over anti-Chinese discrimination in the U.K. as consequence, notably violence against Chinese Britons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2016-08/18/content_26518302.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Further, British Chinese even claimed they had been "ignored" from such discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/30538929/british-chinese-people-say-racism-against-them-is-ignored&lt;/ref&gt;

====Portugal====

In the 16th century, increasing sea trades between Europe to China had led Portuguese merchants to China, however Portuguese military ambitions for power and its fear of China's interventions and brutality had led to the growth of Sinophobia in Portugal. Galiote Pereira, a Portuguese Jesuit missionary who was imprisoned by Chinese authorities, claimed China's juridical treatment known as ''bastinado'' was so horrible as it hit on human flesh, becoming the source of fundamental anti-Chinese sentiment later; as well as brutality, cruelty of China and Chinese tyranny.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/27772737/Sinophobia_vs._Sinofilia_in_the_16th_Century_Iberian_World&lt;/ref&gt; With Ming China's brutal reactions on Portuguese merchants following the [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|conquest of Malacca]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOc-AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=envoy,+had+most+effectively+poured+out+his+tale+of+woe,+of+deprivation+at+the+hands+of+the+Portuguese+in+Malacca;+and+he+had+backed+up+the+tale+with+others+concerning+the+reprehensible+Portuguese+methods+in+the+Moluccas,+making+the+case+(quite+truthfully)&amp;dq=envoy,+had+most+effectively+poured+out+his+tale+of+woe,+of+deprivation+at+the+hands+of+the+Portuguese+in+Malacca;+and+he+had+backed+up+the+tale+with+others+concerning+the+reprehensible+Portuguese+methods+in+the+Moluccas,+making+the+case+(quite+truthfully)&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BHafTvGvLILo0QHDuNXeBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA|title=Barbarians and mandarins: thirteen centuries of Western travelers in China|volume=Volume 681 of A phoenix book|year=1976|author=Nigel Cameron|publisher=University of Chicago Press|edition=illustrated, reprint|location=|isbn=0-226-09229-1|quote=envoy, had most effectively poured out his tale of woe, of deprivation at the hands of the Portuguese in Malacca; and he had backed up the tale with others concerning the reprehensible Portuguese methods in the Moluccas, making the case (quite truthfully) that European trading visits were no more than the prelude to annexation of territory.

====Mexico====
{{See also|Chinese immigration to Mexico}}
Anti-Chinese sentiment was first recorded in Mexico at 1880s. Similar to most Western countries at the time, Chinese immigration and its large business involvement has always been a fear for native [[Mexicans]]. Violence against Chinese occurred such as in [[Sonora]], [[Baja California]] and [[Coahuila]], the most notable was the [[Torreón massacre]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1886/04/07/archives/an-antichinese-mob-in-mexico.html&lt;/ref&gt; although it was sometimes argued to be different than other Western nations.&lt;ref&gt;http://history.utoronto.ca/events/chino-anti-chinese-racism-mexico&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Zealand====
Anti-Chinese sentiment grew in New Zealand at 19th century when the [[British Empire]] issued the Yellow Perils to embrace xenophobic sentiment against Chinese population and China, and it remains relevant today in New Zealand. It was begun with Chinese Immigration Acts at 1881, limiting Chinese from emigrating to New Zealand and excluding Chinese from major jobs, to even anti-Chinese organizations.&lt;ref name=pantograph&gt;http://pantograph-punch.com/post/old-asian-new-asian&lt;/ref&gt; Today, mostly anti-Chinese sentiment in New Zealand is about the labor issue.&lt;ref name=pantograph /&gt;

K. Emma Ng reported that "''One in two New Zealanders feel the recent arrival of Asian migrants is changing the country in undesirable ways''"&lt;ref name=pantograph /&gt;

Attitude over Chinese in New Zealand remains fairly negative, and Chinese are still considered to be less respected people in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/84211773/new-zealand-is-no-paradise-rugby-racism-and-homophobia&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with the [[California Gold Rush]] in the late 19th century, the United States—particularly the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] states—imported large numbers of Chinese migrant laborers. Early Chinese immigrant worked as gold miners, and later on subsequent large labor projects, such as the building of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]]. The decline of the [[Qing Dynasty]] in China caused many Chinese to emigrate overseas in search of a more stable life, and this coincided with the rapid growth of American industry. The Chinese were considered by employers as "reliable" workers who would continue working, without complaint, even under destitute conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Norton|first=Henry K.|title=The Story of California From the Earliest Days to the Present|publisher=A.C. McClurg &amp; Co.|year=1924|location=Chicago|pages=283–296|url=http://www.sfmuseum.net/hist6/chinhate.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese migrant workers encountered considerable prejudice in the United States, especially by the people who occupied the lower layers in white society, because Chinese "[[coolies]]" were used as a scapegoat for depressed wage levels by politicians and labor leaders.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5046/%7C&lt;/ref&gt; Cases of physical assaults on the Chinese include the [[Chinese massacre of 1871]] in [[Los Angeles]] and the [[murder of Vincent Chin]]. The 1909  murder of [[Elsie Sigel]] in New York, of which a Chinese person was suspected, was blamed on the Chinese in general and led to physical violence. "The murder of Elsie Sigel immediately grabbed the front pages of newspapers, which portrayed Chinese men as dangerous to "innocent" and "virtuous" young white women. This murder led to a surge in the harassment of Chinese in communities across the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chinese St. Louis: From Enclave to Cultural Community|first=Huping|last=Ling|publisher=[[Temple University Press]]|year=2004|page=68|quote=The murder of Elsie Sigel immediately grabbed the front pages of newspapers, which portrayed Chinese men as dangerous to "innocent" and "virtuous" young white women. This murder led to a surge in the harassment of Chinese in communities across the United States.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian-Americans and Irish-Americans, who had once been subject to similar prejudice themselves, were often involved in such assaults, believing that their condition had been worsened by the influx of Chinese laborers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

The emerging American [[trade unions]], under such leaders as [[Samuel Gompers]], also took an outspoken anti-Chinese position,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Meat vs. Rice: American Manhood against Asiatic Coolieism: Which Shall Survive?|first=Samuel|last=Gompers|authorlink=Samuel Gompers|first2=Herman|last2=Gustadt|publisher=[[American Federation of Labor]]|year=1902}}&lt;/ref&gt; regarding Chinese laborers as competitors to white laborers. Only with the emergence of the international trade union, [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW]], did trade unionists start to accept Chinese workers as part of the American working-class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chinese American Transnational Politics|author=Lai, Him Mark|authorlink=Him Mark Lai|author2=Hsu, Madeline Y. |publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|year=2010|pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1870s and 1880s various legal discriminatory measures were taken against the Chinese. These laws, in particular the [[Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)|Chinese Exclusion Act]] of 1882, were aimed at restricting further immigration from China.&lt;ref name="yeefow" /&gt; although the laws were later repealed by the [[Chinese Exclusion Repeal Act of 1943]]. In particular, even in his lone dissent against ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' (1896), then-[[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] Justice [[John Marshall Harlan]] wrote of the Chinese as: "a race so different from our own that we do not permit those belonging to it to become citizens of the United States. Persons belonging to it are, with few exceptions, absolutely excluded from our country. I allude to the Chinese race."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chin|first=Gabriel J.|title=Harlan, Chinese and Chinese Americans|url=http://academic.udayton.edu/race/02rights/immigr10.htm|publisher=University of Dayton Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===

According to a recent Pew Research Center survey of six African countries, [[Ghana]], [[Kenya]], [[Nigeria]], [[Senegal]], [[South Africa]], and [[Uganda]] had higher disapproval towards China compared to previous years while they had higher positive view for the [[United States]].

====Kenya====
Anti-Chinese sentiment broke out in [[Kenya]] when Kenyans accused Chinese for looting and stealing jobs from Kenyans, thus attacking Chinese workers and Chinese immigrants inside the country in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/rise-anti-chinese-violence-kenya-forces-halt-major-rail-project-1576945&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ghana====
[[Ghana]]ians have alleged Chinese miners of illegally seizing jobs, polluting community water supplies, and disturbing agricultural production through their work.

A sixteen-year-old illegal Chinese miner was shot in 2012, while trying to escape arrest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gladstonemedia.ca/soufan/tsg-intelbrief-rising-sinophobia-in-africa/ TSG IntelBrief: Rising Sinophobia in Africa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229042103/http://gladstonemedia.ca/soufan/tsg-intelbrief-rising-sinophobia-in-africa/ |date=2013-12-29 }}, 31 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Though he failed to win elections thrice, he won the [[Zambian general election, 2011|2011 election]]. Despite toning down his rhetoric, the investment climate for Zambia was read as uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/09/2011922234557755338.html|title=Opposition leader wins Zambia election|publisher=|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{original research inline|date=May 2013}}

====South Africa====
During the 19th century the [[British Empire]], which used to control most of South Africa, spread Sinophobia across the country.

Recent rise of Sinophobic sentiment in South Africa is largely contributed to by economic looting from China and growing Chinese influence in the country. In 2015, South Africa planned to allow for [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] to be taught in schools in South Africa solicited umbrage from the teachers' union and set social media and comment sections ablaze with fears of a Chinese "imperialism" in Africa and a new "colonialism"; as well as recent increasing Chinese immigration to the country.&lt;ref&gt;https://thisisafrica.me/south-africas-latest-disease-sinophobia/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, violence against Chinese immigrants and other foreign workers broke out in [[Durban]], then quickly spread out in other major cities in South Africa as for the result of Chinese fears over taking South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;https://thediplomat.com/2015/04/chinas-south-african-ties-complicated-by-recent-violence/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Depiction of China and Chinese in media ==
Depiction of China and Chinese in official medias have been somewhat under subject in general, but overall, the majority of depiction over China and Chinese are surrounded about coverages, mainly, as negative. In 2016, [[Hong Kong]]'s L. K. Cheah said to [[South China Morning Post]] that Western journalists who regard China's motives with suspicion and cynicism are cherry-picking facts based on a biased view, and the misinformation they produce as a result is unhelpful, and sympathetic of the resentment against China.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1963504/western-media-should-rethink-its-distorted-portrayal-chinas&lt;/ref&gt; Many Chinese consider this is "war of information".

According from China Daily, a nationalist press of China, [[Hollywood]] is accused for its negative portrayal of Chinese in movies, such as bandits, dangerous, cold-blood, weak and cruel;&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.chinadaily.com.cn/blog-1376588-36421.html&lt;/ref&gt; while the Americans as well as several European or Asians like Filipino, Taiwanese, Korean, Hong Konger, Vietnamese, Indian and Japanese characters in general are depicted as saviors, even anti-Chinese [[whitewashing in film]] is common. [[Matt Damon]], the American actor who appeared in ''[[The Great Wall (film)|The Great Wall]]'', had also faced criticism that he had participated in “whitewashing” through his involvement in forthcoming historical epic The Great Wall, a large-scale Hollywood-Chinese co-production, which he denied.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/07/matt-damon-on-great-wall-whitewashing-i-didnt-take-role-from-chinese-actor&lt;/ref&gt; Several another examples is the depiction of ancient [[Tang dynasty|Tang Chinese]] in [[Yeon Gaesomun (TV series)|Yeon Gaesomun]], a Korean historical drama, as "barbaric, inhuman, violent" seeking to conquer [[Goguryeo]] and subjecting Koreans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4kfh-82XIo/ YeonGaesomun(연개소문): Battle of Ansiseong Part I]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39GIeOzzJ3A/ YeonGaesomun(연개소문): Battle of Ansiseong Part II]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFSZ9ou8U0Q/ YeonGaesomun(연개소문): Battle of Ansiseong Part III]&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, anti-Chinese political rhetoric usually puts emphasis on highlighting policies and practices of the Chinese government that are criticised internally - [[Corruption in China|corruption]], [[Human rights in China|human rights issues]], unfair trades, [[Censorship in China|censorship]], violence, military expansionism, political interferences and historical imperialist legacies. It is often in line with independent medias opposing Chinese Government in China as well as [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]].&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/opinion/murong-beijings-propaganda-crisis.html&lt;/ref&gt; In defence of this rhetoric, some sources critical of the Chinese government claim that it is Chinese state-owned media and administration who attempt to discredit the "neutral" criticism by generalizing it into indiscriminate accusations of the whole Chinese population and targeting those who criticize the regime&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2005/jun/14/newmedia.china&lt;/ref&gt; - or Sinophobia.&lt;ref name=nytimes /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://time.com/4985307/xi-jinping-china-propaganda-censorship-19th-congress/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00472336.2011.610617?src=recsys&amp;journalCode=rjoc20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-11-16/cctv-struggles-to-silence-criticism-it-is-a-propaganda-machine/5894682&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued, however, that the Western media, similar to Russia's case, doesn't make enough distinction between CPC's regime and China and the Chinese, thus effectively vilifying the whole nation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinafile.com/reporting-opinion/viewpoint/why-do-we-keep-writing-about-chinese-politics-if-we-know-more-we-do&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business ==
Due to the deep resentment over China-made business as well as unfair trades from Chinese corporations, several countries have taken measures to ban or limit Chinese companies from investing in its markets. Notably is the case of [[Huawei]] and [[ZTE]], which were banned from operating or doing business with American companies in the United States due to alleged involvements from Chinese Government and security concerns.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-zte/u-s-ban-on-sales-to-chinas-zte-opens-fresh-front-as-tensions-escalate-idUSKBN1HN1P1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/17/technology/huawei-trade-war.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnet.com/news/us-bans-american-exports-to-chinese-phone-company-zte/&lt;/ref&gt; It was seen as discrimination against China. Some countries like India also moves closer to full ban or limit operations of Chinese corporations inside their countries for the exact reasons.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.firstpost.com/business/hello-indian-telcos-heard-the-us-warning-on-huawei-zte-485934.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/news/10579-chinese-telecom-giants-india-s-security-spotlight&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Economist]]'', many Western as well as non-Chinese investors still think that anything to do with China is somewhat "dirty" and unfresh&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/node/17155730&lt;/ref&gt; as most look on China as a country which often interferes on other businesses. Alexandra Stevenson from ''[[The New York Times]]'' also noted that "''China wants its giant national companies to be world leaders in sectors like electric cars, robotics and drones, but the authorities are accused of curtailing foreign firms' access to Chinese consumers.''"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/business/china-global-business-xi-jinping.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Derogatory terms ==
There are a variety of derogatory terms referring to China and Chinese people. Many of these terms are viewed as racist. However, these terms do not necessarily refer to the Chinese ethnicity as a whole; they can also refer to specific policies, or specific time periods in history.

=== In English ===
* '''Ah Tiong''' – refers specifically to Chinese nationals, and never to overseas Chinese. Primarily used in Singapore to differentiate between the Singaporeans of Chinese heritage and Chinese nationals. From the Hokkien '阿中', 中 referring to the PRC's Chinese name. Considered offensive.
* '''Cheena''' – same usage as 'Ah Tiong' in Singapore.
* '''[[Chinaman (term)|Chinaman]]''' – the term Chinaman is noted as offensive by modern dictionaries, dictionaries of slurs and euphemisms, and guidelines for racial harassment.
* '''[[Ching chong]]''' – Used to mock people of Chinese descent and the Chinese language, or other East Asian looking people in general.
* '''Ching chang chong''' – Used to mock people of Chinese descent and the Chinese language, or other East Asians in general.
* '''[[Chink]]''' – racial slur referring to a person of Chinese ethnicity, but could be directed towards anyone of East Asian descent in general.
* '''[[Chinky]]''' – the name "chinky" is the adjectival form of chink and, like chink, is an ethnic slur for Chinese occasionally directed towards other East Asian people.
* '''Chonky''' – refers to a person of Chinese heritage with white attributes whether being a personality aspect or physical aspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=e0lfyT2EJwAC&amp;pg=PA222&amp;dq=Chonky |title=? |author= |date= 2008-05-23|work= |publisher= |accessdate= |isbn=978-1-59385-710-3 |author1=Fontes, Lisa Aronson }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YY0BpjV4vDYC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=Chonky#PPA149,M1 |title=? |author= |date= 2008-01-28|work= |publisher= |accessdate=23 August 2010 |isbn=9789042023512 |author1=Robert Lee, A}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Coolie]]''' – means [[Laborer]] in reference to Chinese manual workers in the 19th and early 20th century.
* '''Slope''' – used to mock people of Chinese descent and the sloping shape of their [[skull]], or other East Asians. Used commonly during the [[Vietnam War]].

* '''Lingling''' – used to call someone of Chinese descent.

=== In Filipino (Tagalog) ===
* '''''Intsik''''' – is used to refer to refer people of Chinese ancestry including [[Chinese Filipino]]s. The originally neutral term recently gained negative connotation with the increasing preference of Chinese Filipinos not to be referred to as ''intsik''. The term originally came from ''in chiek'', a [[Hokkien dialect|Hokkien]] term referring to one's uncle. The term has variations, which may be more offensive in tone such as ''intsik beho'' and may used in a deregatory phrase, ''intsik beho tulo laway'' ("old Chinaman with drooling saliva").&lt;ref name="bayanihannews.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bayanihannews.com.au/2013/09/13/pinoy-or-tsinoy-what-is-the-problem/|title=Pinoy or Tsinoy, What is the Problem?|publisher=|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/columns/view/20110128-317065/Intsik|title=Intsik – INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos|publisher=|accessdate=9 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219182955/http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/columns/view/20110128-317065/Intsik|archivedate=19 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Superannuation Complaints Tribunal''' is an independent statutory body established by the [[Australian Government]] to deal with complaints about superannuation (and certain life insurance annuities).

== History==

The Superannuation Complaints Tribunal was established under the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act in 1993.  It was established at the same time as a new prudential and disclosure framework was put in place under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, protecting employees compulsory superannuation contributions (introduced in 1992).

==Operation of the Tribunal==

In order for the Tribunal to deal with a complaint, a member (former member or potential beneficiary) of a superannuation fund must first make a formal complaint to the Trustee of that fund (under the fund's own internal complaints procedures).  If the complaint is not resolved to the member's satisfaction (or has not been dealt with within a 90-day period) then a complaint can be made to the Tribunal.

The Tribunal will only deal with complaints as they relate to a trustee decision affecting an individual member. The Tribunal cannot deal with complaints about the fund as a whole (e.g. poor investment performance). [http://www.sct.gov.au/Making_a_complaint/default.asp?images=b] 

The Tribunal will first try and resolve the complaint through conciliation (where the SCT will facilitate a discussion with all parties involved).

If conciliation is not successful, the Tribunal will make a "review" decision that is binding on all parties.

From July 1, 2018, the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA) will replace the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS), the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal (SCT) and the Credit and Investments Ombudsman.

'''''The Art of Sexual Ecstasy''''' (New York: Tarcher/Putnam, 1989) is the best-known work of author [[Margot Anand]]. It presents the foundation of her method known as "SkyDancing Tantra". It has been translated into at least eleven languages and has gone through numerous printings. It is possibly the most popular book on [[Tantra]] addressed to a Western audience, and is notable for its use of concrete sexual exercises to demonstrate the often esoteric principles of Tantra.

==Publication history==
&lt;!--  Commented out: The Book of General Ignorance (US Cover).jpg --&gt;
First published by [[Faber and Faber]] in Britain on 19 October 2006, ''The Book of General Ignorance'' was published in the United States (on 7 August 2007 by [[Harmony Books]]), in France as ''Les autruches ne mettent pas la tête dans le sable: 200 bonnes raisons de renoncer à nos certitudes'' (on 3 October 2007 by [[:fr:Dunod|Dunod]]) and in the Netherlands as ''Het grote boek van foute feiten'' (on 1 November 2007 by Uitgeverij Forum). A surprise Christmas 2006 best-seller in the UK, the book became "[[Amazon.co.uk|Amazon]]'s number one Global bestseller for Christmas 2006."&lt;ref&gt;[http://qitalk.blogspot.com/2007/01/everything-qi-quite-interesting.html Everything QI: Quite Interesting, the QI Blog.

==Background==
The title "General Ignorance", chosen both to emulate and parody [[general knowledge]] quizzes, was first used to describe the final round of the panel game ''[[QI]]'', which was created by Lloyd and had Mitchinson as head researcher.&lt;ref name=BehindQ1/&gt; Appearing initially in the unbroadcast pilot (subsequently available on DVD), the round has varied little in content and style since, although the questions became slightly more obtuse. From the start the round consisted of several deliberately misleading questions which appear to have obvious answers that are actually inaccurate (for example, aircraft [[flight recorder|black box]]es are in fact orange, for visibility.) The pilot also introduced the concept of penalising answers that were overly predictable, especially obvious jokes: one such question in the pilot was, "What is the sixth most popular name for a baby boy in Germany?" The answer to the question is, in fact, "Tim". However, ''QI's'' regular panellist [[Alan Davies]] answered with the jokey suggestion "[[Adolph]]", allowing host [[Stephen Fry]] to produce a prepared piece of card reading "Adolph," whereupon the obvious-but-inaccurate answer was revealed to carry a penalty score of −10 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = [[QI (A series)|Pilot]] | series = QI }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the pilot was shown to the then-controller of [[BBC Two]] ([[Jane Root]]), it was this feature that particularly caught her attention, and penalties remained a regular feature throughout the first nine series of the programme.&lt;ref name="Factoid"&gt;''QI Series 1 DVD'' Factoids&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the nature of the questions in the final round, however, the majority of penalties would always be awarded during "General Ignorance".

While most episodes are structured around a theme topic beginning with the Series' initial letter (each Series is alphabetically structured, with Series 5 being "E", etc.), "General Ignorance" contains questions on a range of diverse subjects, linked only by common misunderstanding. Occasionally the round differs, in particular during the Christmas specials. During the course of the "B" Series special, Fry and Davies swapped places for "General Ignorance", with Fry attempting to answer questions ostensibly written by Davies to stump him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = [[QI (B series)|Series B Christmas Special]] | series = QI | airdate = 26 December 2004 | season = B | number = 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During "D"s Christmas Special, all the "GI" questions revolved around [[saint]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = [[QI (D series)|Series D Christmas Special]] | series = QI | airdate = 15 December 2006 | season = D | number = 13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
''The Book of General Ignorance'' contains a list of 230 questions, most of which previously appeared in episodes of ''QI''. Each question explains the correct answer, and usually attempts to show why people tend to make the wrong assumptions, or believe certain myths. Each book contains two [[foreword]]s, one by Fry, the other by Davies. Davies' initial "foreword" was credited as "Four words," which read simply: "Will this do, Stephen?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Davies | first = Alan | authorlink = Alan Davies |author2=[[John Lloyd (writer)|Lloyd, John]] |author3=[[John Mitchinson (researcher)|Mitchinson, John]] | title = QI: The Book of General Ignorance | publisher = Faber and Faber | date = 5 October 2006 | pages = xv | isbn = 0-571-23368-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
[[File:The Book of General Ignorance (Rough Cover).jpg|140px|thumb|right|An earlier version of the cover, playing on the idea of ignorance with a typo]]
Response to the book has been mostly positive, both critically and commercially. Critic Jennifer Kay said, "''The Book of General Ignorance'' won't make you feel dumb. It's really a call to be more curious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Kay | first = Jennifer | title = Everything You Think You Know Is Wrong | publisher = ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' | date = 30 July 2007 | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/07/30/entertainment/e112437D14.DTL | accessdate = 1 August 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080111074310/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2007%2F07%2F30%2Fentertainment%2Fe112437D14.DTL | archivedate = 11 January 2008 | deadurl = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Liesl Schillinger in [[The New York Times]] praised the book for gathering "so much repeatable wisdom […] in one place," asking the rhetorical question of interested parties—"In the Information Age, can you afford to remain ignorant of these precious factoids?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/fashion/02books.html|title=The Book of General Ignorance: Everything You Think You Know Is Wrong|first=Liesl|last=Schillinger|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2 September 2007|accessdate=23 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doug Brown reviewed the book for Powell's Books, noting that it has a "UK-heavy emphasis", and that "Overall The Book of General Ignorance is a lot of fun, and you're guaranteed to learn something you didn't know (but thought you did)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powells.com/review/2007_11_24.html Powell's Books "Review-a-Day"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210014901/http://www.powells.com/review/2007_11_24.html |date=10 February 2008 }}. Retrieved 10 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
Aileen Marshall rates it with the maximum five stars for the Librarian Book Review at TeensPoint.org, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This book is just fun to read, alone or with your spouse or friends. And it broadens your horizon. Even if you don't plan on attending a trivia-gameshow anytime soon, your newly acquired knowledge will be beneficial when the need for smalltalk arises.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teenspoint.org/reading_matters/single_resource.asp?media=staffbook&amp;resource_id=25564 "This book is for people who know they don't know a lot." reviewed by Aileen Marshall]. Accessed February 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book was favourably reviewed in other places, among them such American newspapers as the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[Monsters and Critics]]'', ''[[USA Today]]'', ''[[Seattle Times]]'', ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' and ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qi.com/news/search.php?id=4 ''QI'' News: ''Book of General Ignorance''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215143109/http://www.qi.com/news/search.php?id=4 |date=15 February 2008 }}. Retrieved 10 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; However, some reviews were critical; Kirsten Garrett suggested in her review that, ''The Book of General Ignorance'' "is in danger of being too smart for its own good. In fact, a bit smart-arse."&lt;ref name=KirstenGarrett&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/bookshow/stories/2007/1866120.htm |first=Kirsten |last=Garrett |date=12 March 2007 |title=The Book of General Ignorance (review)|publisher=ABC Radio National |accessdate=10 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also noted that "It's a disgrace that in a book of this kind there is no index. It's not possible to look up a subject about which you are ignorant".&lt;ref name=KirstenGarrett/&gt;
	
[[Marcus Berkmann]] drew attention to the over-abundance of similarly themed books (to which the ''QI'' title—and series—clearly owe a certain debt), commenting that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A book of the show has become all but necessary, if only to allow us to ingest this information at normal brain speed, and because such fine and creative research genuinely deserves to be captured in print. So it's slightly disappointing that the book arrives in the question-and-answer format made so familiar by last year's big hit ''[[Does Anything Eat Wasps?]]'' There are actually about 20 such books out this year, all asking these quirky questions (Do Sheep Shrink In The Rain? Do Fish Drink Water?), all piled up in ''[[Waterstones]]'', making book-buyers feel a bit depressed.&lt;ref name=CriticsView&gt;{{cite web | last = Berkmann | first = Marcus | authorlink = Marcus Berkmann | title = QI News: Critic's view | date = 2006-12-08 | url = http://www.qi.com/news/item.php?id=54 | accessdate = 2007-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Berkman's complaints, however, are countered by his admission that "this book is already the amusing trivia success of the season," containing many "eye-watering" and "eyebrow-raising" facts, even if he thinks it a little smug.&lt;ref name=CriticsView/&gt;

Both the "question and answer" format and indexing issues were addressed for the follow-up ''[[The Book of Animal Ignorance]]'', which had an alphabetised structure (with contents page), and stand-alone facts, rather than responses.

==Sequels==
A "Pocket edition" of ''The Book of General Ignorance'' was published on 3 April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qi.com/shop/general_ignorance_pb.php|title=The Pocket Book of General Ignorance|publisher=QI|accessdate=18 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second book in the series, ''[[The Book of Animal Ignorance]]'', was released in the UK a year after ''The Book of General Ignorance'', on 4 October 2007. An audiobook adaptation called ''The Sound of General Ignorance'' was scripted and read by the authors on 4 November 2008. On 25 December 2008 an extended version of the book, entitled ''The Noticeably Stouter Edition'', was published to coincide with ''QI'' moving to [[BBC One]]. This new version included new facts, quotes from the show, a list of all the episodes made at the time, an [[Index (publishing)|index]], and a new collection of "Four words" from Davies.

On 1 November 2007 another ''QI'' spin-off title was produced: The ''QI'' [[Annual publication|annual]], intended as  a continuing work focusing on the Series' alphabetic themes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://qitalk.blogspot.com/2007/04/qi-book-releases-for-2007.html QI Talk Blog - QI Book Releases For 2007]. Created 19 April 2007. Retrieved 15 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The annual featured contributions from most of "QI"s guest panellists and the comedian [[Rowan Atkinson]]. In 2010 the second book of General Ignorance was released.

In the context of [[information retrieval]], a '''thesaurus''' (plural: "thesauri") is a form of controlled vocabulary that seeks to dictate semantic manifestations of [[metadata]] in the indexing of content objects. A thesaurus serves to minimise semantic ambiguity by ensuring uniformity and consistency in the storage and retrieval of the manifestations of content objects. ANSI/NISO Z39.19-2005 defines a content object as "any item that is to be described for inclusion in an information retrieval system, website, or other source of information".&lt;ref&gt;ANSI &amp; NISO 2005, Guidelines for the Construction, Format, and Management of Monolingual Controlled Vocabularies, NISO, Maryland, U.S.A, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; The thesaurus aids the assignment of preferred terms to convey semantic metadata associated with the content object.&lt;ref&gt;ANSI &amp; NISO 2005, Guidelines for the Construction, Format, and Management of Monolingual Controlled Vocabularies, NISO, Maryland, U.S.A, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

A thesaurus serves to guide both an indexer and a searcher in selecting the same preferred term or combination of preferred terms to represent a given subject. [[ISO 25964]], the international standard for information retrieval thesauri, defines a thesaurus as a “controlled and structured vocabulary in which concepts are represented by terms, organized so that relationships between concepts are made explicit, and preferred terms are accompanied by lead-in entries for synonyms or quasi-synonyms.”

A thesaurus is composed by at least three elements: 1-a list of words (or terms), 2-the relationship amongst the words (or terms), indicated by their hierarchical relative position (e.g. parent/broader term; child/narrower term, synonym, etc.), 3-a set of rules on how to use the thesaurus.

== History ==
Wherever there have been large collections of information, whether on paper or in computers, scholars have faced a challenge in pinpointing the items they seek. The use of classification schemes to arrange the documents in order was only a partial solution. Another approach was to index the contents of the documents using words or terms, rather than classification codes. In the 1940s and 1950s some pioneers, such as [[Calvin Mooers]], Charles L. Bernier, [http://pubs.acs.org/cen/priestley/recipients/1951crane.html Evan J. Crane] and [[Hans Peter Luhn]], collected up their index terms in various kinds of list that they called a “thesaurus” (by analogy with the well known thesaurus developed by [[Peter Roget]]).&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, N. The pre-history of the information retrieval thesaurus. ''Journal of Documentation'', 40(4), 1984, p.271-285.&lt;/ref&gt; The first such list put seriously to use in information retrieval was the thesaurus developed in 1959 at the E I Dupont de Nemours Company.&lt;ref&gt;Aitchison, J. and Dextre Clarke, S. The thesaurus: a historical viewpoint, with a look to the future. ''Cataloging &amp; Classification Quarterly'', 37 (3/4), 2004, p.5-21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krooks, D.A. and Lancaster, F.W. The evolution of guidelines for thesaurus construction. ''Libri'', 43(4), 1993, p.326-342.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first two of these lists to be published were the ''Thesaurus of ASTIA Descriptors'' (1960) and the ''Chemical Engineering Thesaurus'' of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (1961), a descendant of the Dupont thesaurus. More followed, culminating in the influential ''Thesaurus of Engineering and Scientific Terms'' (TEST) published jointly by the Engineers Joint Council and the US Department of Defense in 1967. TEST did more than just serve as an example; its Appendix 1 presented ''Thesaurus rules and conventions'' that have guided thesaurus construction ever since.
Hundreds of thesauri have been produced since then, perhaps thousands. The most notable innovations since TEST have been:
(a)	Extension from monolingual to multilingual capability; and 
(b)	Addition of a conceptually organized display to the basic alphabetical presentation.

Here we mention only some of the national and international standards that have built steadily on the basic rules set out in TEST:

* [[UNESCO]] ''Guidelines for the establishment and development of monolingual thesauri''. 1970 (followed by later editions in 1971 and 1981)
* DIN 1463 ''Guidelines for the establishment and development of monolingual thesauri''. 1972 (followed by later editions)
* ISO 2788 ''Guidelines for the establishment and development of monolingual thesauri''. 1974 (revised 1986)
* ANSI ''American National Standard for Thesaurus Structure, Construction, and Use''. 1974 (revised 1980 and superseded by ANSI/NISO Z39.19-1993)
* ISO 5964 ''Guidelines for the establishment and development of multilingual thesauri''. 1985
* ANSI/NISO Z39.19 ''Guidelines for the construction, format, and management of monolingual thesauri''. 1993 (revised 2005 and renamed ''Guidelines for the construction, format, and management of monolingual controlled vocabularies''.)
* ISO 25964 ''Thesauri and interoperability with other vocabularies''. Part 1 (''Thesauri for information retrieval'') published 2011; Part 2 (''Interoperability with other vocabularies'') published 2013.

The most clearly visible trend across this history of thesaurus development has been from the context of small-scale isolation to a networked world.&lt;ref&gt;Dextre Clarke, Stella G. and Zeng, Marcia Lei. [http://www.niso.org/publications/isq/2012/v24no1/clarke/ From ISO 2788 to ISO 25964: the evolution of thesaurus standards towards interoperability and data modeling] ''Information standards quarterly'', 24(1), 2012, p.20-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Access to information was notably enhanced when thesauri crossed the divide between monolingual and multilingual applications. More recently, as can be seen from the titles of the latest ISO and NISO standards, there is a recognition that thesauri need to work in harness with other forms of vocabulary or knowledge organization system, such as subject heading schemes, classification schemes, taxonomies and ontologies. The official website for ISO 25964 gives more information, including a reading list.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.niso.org/schemas/iso25964/ ISO 25964 – the international standard for thesauri and interoperability with other vocabularies.]'' National Information Standards Organization, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
{{refimprove section|small=z|date=March 2016}}
In information retrieval, a thesaurus can be used as a form of controlled vocabulary to aid in the indexing of appropriate metadata for information bearing entities. A thesaurus helps with expressing the manifestations of a concept in a prescribed way, to aid in improving [[precision and recall]]. This means that the semantic conceptual expressions of information bearing entities are easier to locate due to uniformity of language. Additionally, a thesaurus is used for maintaining a hierarchical listing of terms; usually single words or bound phrases that aid the indexer in narrowing the terms and limiting semantic ambiguity.

The [[Art and Architecture Thesaurus|Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus]], for example, is used by countless museums around the world, to catalogue their collections. [[AGROVOC]], the thesaurus of the UN’s [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], is used to index and/or search its AGRIS database of worldwide literature on agricultural research.

== Structure ==
{{refimprove section|small=z|date=March 2016}}
Information retrieval thesauri are formally organized so that existing relationships between concepts are made clear. For example, "citrus fruits" might be linked to the broader concept of "fruits" and to the narrower ones of "oranges", "lemons", etc. When the terms are displayed online, the links between them make it very easy to browse the thesaurus, selecting useful terms for a search. When a single term could have more than one meaning, like tables (furniture) or tables (data), these are listed separately so that the user can choose which concept to search for and avoid retrieving irrelevant results. For any one concept, all known synonyms are listed, such as "mad cow disease", "bovine spongiform encephalopathy", "BSE", etc. The idea is to guide all the indexers and all the searchers to use the same term for the same concept, so that search results will be as complete as possible. If the thesaurus is multilingual, equivalent terms in other languages are shown too. Following international standards, concepts are generally arranged hierarchically within facets or grouped by themes or topics. Unlike a general thesaurus used for literary purposes, information retrieval thesauri typically focus on one discipline, subject or field of study.

==History==
The search engine was first created by its founder Tim Yu&lt;ref name="cuhkshaw" /&gt; in July 1997. As an engineer and a remarkably book lover, Yu discovered that a Hong Kong-oriented search engine would be way more effective in processing massive data (in both English AND Chinese) and allow user to get the exact useful information.&lt;ref name="alumnicuhk2000"/&gt; Seeing the great potential in this area, Yu started a searchable directory in Hong Kong even earlier than Yahoo!HK,&lt;ref name="yhk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hk.yahoo.com/beginner/yhk.html|title=Yahoo! 初學者入門|accessdate=2009-03-24|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhk.yahoo.com%2Fbeginner%2Fyhk.html&amp;date=2009-03-24|archivedate=2009-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which marked a milestone in the developments of HK search portal business.

'''&lt;u&gt;Milestones:&lt;/u&gt;''' 
* Founded in July 1997 by Tim Yu,&lt;ref name="cuhkshaw" /&gt; using a former domain name of hksrch.com.
* Registered as a Hong Kong registered company in February 1998.  
* Changed the domain name to timway.com in 1999.&lt;ref name="About Timway" /&gt;
* Education portal was established in 2000.  A wide range of education courses are supplied. The cooperation with tens of education providers makes it an education supermarket, thus finding education courses becomes convenient.&lt;ref name="About Timway" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edu.timway.com/ Timway Education]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Starting from 2005, Timway appoints Professor Michael Chau as the senior technology advisor.&lt;ref name="michaelchau"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fbe.hku.hk/~mchau/cv.html|title=Michael Chau Professional Experience|accessdate=2009-03-25|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fbe.hku.hk%2F%7Emchau%2Fcv.html&amp;date=2009-03-25|archivedate=2009-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* By 2009, Timway is of the top ten websites in [[Hong Kong]] according to web traffic analysis company of [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]], ranked by popularity.&lt;ref name="alexahk" /&gt;
* Timway ran a website called Timway Quiz before.  It made use of the technology of [[Coldfusion]] for enhanced interactivity with the users.&lt;ref name="adobe"&gt;{{cite web | title= Adobe 成功案例 | url =http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/showcase/index.cfm?event=casestudydetail&amp;casestudyid=16601&amp;loc=zh_cn |accessdate = 2009-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Few academic studies examined user information seeking behavior when using non-English search engine and Timway is one of the few contributed to this.&lt;ref name="WebSearchCharacter"&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5fWFnjDFX Chau, M., Lu, Y., Fang, X., and Yang, C.

'''TrueMajorityACTION''' was a separate but closely related organization, which had a different status under U.S. law so that it could campaign for specific parties and politicians. TrueMajority merged with [[USAction]] in 2007.

TrueMajority was mentioned on [[The Colbert Report]] on March 5, 2007, when Ben and [[Jerry Greenfield|Jerry]] made a guest appearance. In the episode, they offered free frisbees to Colbert viewers who visited the web site, and then they signed up each viewer who visited as a member of the advocacy group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Ben and Jerry| url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/83216/march-05-2007/ben-and-jerry---introducing-americone-dream| date=2007-03-05| publisher=[[The Colbert Report]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a wish tree was installed at the [[Museum of Modern Art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travelogged.com/2010/07/20/make-a-wish-yoko-onos-wish-tree-at-the-moma/|title=Make a Wish!

Paper is provided for the visitor to tie a wish to the tree.
The work builds on the Japanese tradition of tying prayers to trees. 
Returning the paper back to its source evokes an offering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artificeau.blogspot.com/2007/04/yoko-ono-wish-tree-for-washington.html|title=ARTifice: Fear and Loathing in DC|work=artificeau.blogspot.com|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
