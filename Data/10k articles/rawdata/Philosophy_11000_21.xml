[[Adolf Hitler]] and his top officials took a variety of measures to ensure animals were protected.&lt;ref name="RA132"&gt;{{cite book | author1=Arnold Arluke | author2=Clinton Sanders | title= Regarding Animals | publisher=Temple University Press | location= | year=1996 | page=132 | isbn=1-56639-441-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[List of Nazi Party leaders and officials|Nazi leaders]], including Hitler and [[Hermann Göring]], were supporters of animal rights and conservation.

In his private diaries, Nazi Propaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] described [[Adolf Hitler and vegetarianism|Hitler as a vegetarian]] whose hatred of the Jewish and Christian religions in large part stemmed from the ethical distinction these faiths drew between the value of humans and the value of other animals; Goebbels also mentions that Hitler planned to ban slaughterhouses in the German Reich following the conclusion of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Goebbels"&gt;{{cite book| last = Goebbels| first = Joseph|author2= Louis P.

The legacy of Nazi animal welfare laws is controversial. Some critics of animal rights use the historical link with Nazism to condemn the modern animal rights movement, by way of a fallacious argument of [[guilt by association]]. On the other hand, supporters of animal rights often deny the historical link between Nazism and animal welfare. The current animal welfare laws in [[Germany]] are diluted versions of the laws introduced by the Nazis.&lt;ref name="RRNM92"&gt;{{cite book | author= Bruce Braun, Noel Castree | title= Remaking Reality: Nature at the Millenium&lt;!-- PLEASE NOTE that "Millenium" is deliberately spelled incorrectly here, reflecting the mistake on the external page. --&gt; | publisher= Routledge | location= | year= 1998 | page=92 | isbn= 0-415-14493-0
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measures==
At the end of the nineteenth century, [[Shechita|kosher butchering]] and [[vivisection]] (animal experimentation) were the main concerns of the German animal welfare movement. The Nazis adopted these concerns as part of their political platform.&lt;ref name="RA133"&gt;{{cite book | author= Arnold Arluke, Clinton Sanders | title= Regarding Animals | publisher= Temple University Press | location= | year= 1996 | page=133 | isbn= 1-56639-441-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Boria Sax]], the Nazis rejected anthropocentric reasons for animal protection—animals were to be protected for their own sake.&lt;ref name="ATRPSH42"&gt;{{cite book | author=Boria Sax | title=Animals in the Third Reich: Pets, Scapegoats, and the Holocaust | publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group | location= | year=2000 | page=42 | isbn=0-8264-1289-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, a Nazi representative to the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]] called for actions against cruelty to animals and kosher butchering.&lt;ref name="RA133"/&gt;

In 1931, the Nazi Party (then a minority in the Reichstag) proposed a ban on [[vivisection]], but the ban failed to attract bipartisan support. By 1933, after Hitler had ascended to the Chancellery and the Nazis had consolidated control of the Reichstag, the Nazis immediately held a meeting to enact the ban on vivisection. On April 21, 1933, almost immediately after the Nazis came to power, the parliament began to pass laws for the regulation of animal slaughter.&lt;ref name="RA133"/&gt; On April 21, a law was passed concerning the slaughter of animals; no animals were to be slaughtered without anesthetic. 

On April 24, Order of the Prussian Ministry of the Interior was enacted regarding the slaughter of [[poikilotherm]]s.&lt;ref name="ATRPSH181"&gt;{{cite book | author=Boria Sax | title=Animals in the Third Reich: Pets, Scapegoats, and the Holocaust | publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group | location= | year=2000 | page=181 | isbn=0-8264-1289-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany was the first nation to ban vivisection.&lt;ref name="ABAHR125"&gt;{{cite book |author= Kathleen Marquardt | title= Animalscam: The Beastly Abuse of Human Rights | publisher= Regnery Publishing | location= | year=1993 | page=125 | isbn= 0-89526-498-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A law imposing total ban on vivisection was enacted on August 16, 1933, by [[Hermann Göring]] as the prime minister of [[Prussia]].&lt;ref name="GB55"&gt;{{cite book | author= Frank Uekötter | title= The Green and the Brown: A History of Conservation in Nazi Germany | publisher= Cambridge University Press | location= | year= 2006 | page=55 | isbn= 0-521-84819-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He announced an end to the "unbearable torture and suffering in animal experiments" and said that those who "still think they can continue to treat animals as inanimate property" will be sent to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]].&lt;ref name="RA133"/&gt; On August 28, 1933, Göring announced in a radio broadcast:&lt;ref name="ABAHR124"&gt;{{cite book | author= Kathleen Marquardt | title= Animalscam: The Beastly Abuse of Human Rights | publisher= Regnery Publishing | location= | year= 1993 | page=124 | isbn= 0-89526-498-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|An absolute and permanent ban on vivisection is not only a necessary law to protect animals and to show sympathy with their pain, but it is also a law for humanity itself.... I have therefore announced the immediate prohibition of vivisection and have made the practice a punishable offense in Prussia. Until such time as punishment is pronounced the culprit shall be lodged in a concentration camp.&lt;ref name="ABAHR124"/&gt;}}

Caricature from ''[[Kladderadatsch]]'', a satirical journal, September 1933. Göring prohibited vivisection and said that those who "still think they can continue to treat animals as inanimate property" would be sent to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]].&lt;ref name="RA133"/&gt;]]

Göring also banned commercial [[animal trapping]] and imposed severe restrictions on [[hunting]]. He prohibited boiling of [[lobster]]s and [[crab]]s. In one incident, he sent a fisherman to a concentration camp&lt;ref name="ABAHR124"/&gt; for cutting up a bait [[frog]].&lt;ref name="ABAHR125"/&gt;

On November 24, 1933, Nazi Germany enacted another law called ''Reichstierschutzgesetz'' (Reich Animal Protection Act), for protection of animals.&lt;ref name="ATRPSH179"&gt;{{cite book | author=Boria Sax | title=Animals in the Third Reich: Pets, Scapegoats, and the Holocaust | publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group | location= | year=2000 | page=179 | isbn=0-8264-1289-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NEO91"&gt;{{cite book | author= Luc Ferry | title= The New Ecological Order | publisher= University of Chicago Press | location= | year= 1995 | page=91 | isbn= 0-226-24483-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This law listed many prohibitions against the use of animals, including their use for [[filmmaking]] and other public events causing pain or damage to health,&lt;ref name="ATRPSH175"&gt;{{cite book | author=Boria Sax | title=Animals in the Third Reich: Pets, Scapegoats, and the Holocaust | publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group | location= | year=2000 | page=175 | isbn=0-8264-1289-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; feeding fowls forcefully and tearing out the thighs of living frogs.&lt;ref name="ATRPSH176"&gt;{{cite book | author=Boria Sax | title=Animals in the Third Reich: Pets, Scapegoats, and the Holocaust | publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group | location= | year=2000 | page=176 | isbn=0-8264-1289-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two principals (''Ministerialräte'') of the German Ministry of the Interior, Clemens Giese and Waldemar Kahler, who were responsible for drafting the legislative text,&lt;ref name="NEO91"/&gt; wrote in their juridical comment from 1939, that by the law the animal was to be "protected for itself" ("''um seiner selbst willen geschützt''"), and made "an object of protection going far beyond the hitherto existing law" ("''Objekt eines weit über die bisherigen Bestimmungen hinausgehenden Schutzes''").&lt;ref&gt;Clemens Giese and Waldemar Kahler (1939).

On February 23, 1934, a decree was enacted by the Prussian Ministry of Commerce and Employment which introduced education on animal protection laws at [[Primary education|primary]], [[Secondary education|secondary]] and [[Higher education|college]] levels.&lt;ref name="ATRPSH181"/&gt; On 3 July 1934, a law ''Das Reichsjagdgesetz'' (The Reich Hunting Law) was enacted which limited hunting. The act also created the [[Deutsche Jägerschaft|German Hunting Society]] with a mission to educate the hunting community in ethical hunting. On July 1, 1935, another law ''Reichsnaturschutzgesetz'' (Reich Nature Conservation Act) was passed to protect nature.&lt;ref name="NEO91"/&gt; According to an article published in ''Kaltio'', one of the main Finnish cultural magazines, Nazi Germany was the first state in the world to [[Gray wolf#Europe|place the wolf under protection]].&lt;ref name="AnimalRightsThirdReich"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kaltio.fi/index.php?494 |title=Animal Rights in the Third Reich |last=Aikio |first=Aslak |date=February 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906213920/http://www.kaltio.fi/index.php?494 |archivedate=September 6, 2006 |accessdate=February 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nazi Germany "introduced the first legislation for the protection of wolves."&lt;ref name="TheMythicalZoo"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Mythical Zoo: an Encyclopedia of Animals in World Myth, Legend, and Literature |last=Sax |first=Boria |page=272 |year=2001 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |ISBN=1-5760-7612-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, Nazi Germany hosted an international conference on animal welfare in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name="RA137"&gt;{{cite book | author= Arnold Arluke, Clinton Sanders | title= Regarding Animals | publisher= Temple University Press | location= | year= 1996 | page=137 | isbn= 1-56639-441-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 27, 1936, an order on the slaughter of living [[fish]] and other poikilotherms was enacted. On March 18 the same year, an order was passed on [[afforestation]] and on protection of animals in the wild.&lt;ref name="ATRPSH181"/&gt; On September 9, 1937, a decree was published by the Ministry of the Interior which specified guidelines for the transportation of animals.&lt;ref name="ATRPSH182"&gt;{{cite book | author=Boria Sax | title=Animals in the Third Reich: Pets, Scapegoats, and the Holocaust | publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group | location= | year=2000 | page=182 | isbn=0-8264-1289-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, the Nazis introduced animal protection as a subject to be taught in public schools and universities in Germany.&lt;ref name="RA137"/&gt;

==Effectiveness==
Although various laws were enacted for animal protection, the extent to which they were enforced has been questioned. The law enacted by Hermann Göring on August 16, 1933 banning vivisection was revised by a decree of September 5 of that year, with more lax provisions, then allowing the Reich Interior Ministry to distribute permits to some universities and research institutes to conduct animal experiments under conditions of anesthesia and scientific need.&lt;ref name="GB56"&gt;{{cite book | author= Frank Uekötter | title= The Green and the Brown: A History of Conservation in Nazi Germany | publisher= Cambridge University Press | location= | year= 2006 | page=56 | isbn= 0-521-84819-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Pfugers Archiv für die Gesamte Physiologie'' (Pfugers Archive for the Total Physiology), a science journal at that time, there were many animal experiments during the Nazi regime.&lt;ref name="SCGG90"&gt;{{cite book | author= C. Ray Greek, Jean Swingle Greek | title= Sacred Cows and Golden Geese: The Human Cost of Experiments on Animals | publisher= Continuum International Publishing Group | location= | year= 2002 | page=90 | isbn= 0-8264-1402-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, the ''Tierärztekammer'' (Chamber of Veterinarians) in [[Darmstadt]] filed a formal complaint against the lack of enforcement of the animal protection laws on those who conducted illegal animal testing.&lt;ref name="GB57"&gt;{{cite book | author= Frank Uekötter | title= The Green and the Brown: A History of Conservation in Nazi Germany | publisher= Cambridge University Press | location= | year= 2006 | page=57 | isbn= 0-521-84819-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Policies regarding non-Nazi activists===
Animal rights activist [[Boria Sax]] argues in his book ''Animals in the Third Reich: Pets, Scapegoats, and the Holocaust'' that the Nazis manipulated attitudes towards animal protection to conform to their own symbolic system. Presumably, by equating the [[Nazi Party|National Socialist German Workers Party]] with "[[nature]]", the Nazis reduced ethical issues to biological questions.&lt;ref name="ATRPSH"&gt;{{cite book | author= Boria Sax | title= Animals in the Third Reich: Pets, Scapegoats, and the Holocaust | publisher= Continuum International Publishing Group | location= | year= 2000 |pages= | isbn= 0-8264-1289-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars who argue that the Nazis were not authentic supporters of animal rights point out that the Nazi regime disbanded some organizations advocating environmentalism or animal protection. These organizations, such as the 100,000-member strong [[Friends of Nature]], were disbanded because they advocated [[Marxism]] or other political ideologies that were illegal under Nazi law.&lt;ref name="ATRPSH41"&gt;{{cite book | author=Boria Sax | title=Animals in the Third Reich: Pets, Scapegoats, and the Holocaust | publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group | location= | year=2000 | page=41 | isbn=0-8264-1289-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benjamin Jowett''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|oʊ|ɪ|t}},&lt;ref&gt;Letter of [[C. S.

''[[Collins English Dictionary]] – Complete and Unabridged 10th Edition'', 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 15 April 1817 – 1 October 1893) was renowned as an influential tutor and administrative reformer in the [[University of Oxford]], a theologian and translator of [[Plato]] and [[Thucydides]].&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, E.A.

==Early life==

Jowett was born in Peckham, Kent, and grew up in Camberwell, the third of nine children.  His father was a furrier originally from a [[Yorkshire]] family that, for three generations, had been supporters of the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] movement in the [[Church of England]]; and an author of a metrical translation of the Old Testament Psalms.{{sfn|Bostridge|2015|p=390}} His mother was a Langhorne, related to [[John Langhorne (poet)|John Langhorne]], the poet and translator of Plutarch.  At twelve, Jowett was placed on the foundation of [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] (then in [[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]] Churchyard) where he soon gained a reputation as a precocious classical scholar.  Aged eighteen he was awarded an open [[scholarship]] to [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he remained for the rest of his life. He went up in 1836, and was quickly recognized as one of the leading Oxford Dons of his generation, made a Fellow while still an undergraduate in 1838; he graduated with first-class honours in 1839. This was at the height of the Oxford [[Tractarian]] movement: through the friendship of [[William George Ward|W. G. Ward]] he was drawn for a time in the direction of [[High church|High Anglicanism]]; but a stronger and more lasting influence was that of the [[Matthew Arnold|Arnold]] school, represented by [[Arthur Penrhyn Stanley|A. P. Stanley]]. The controversy caused Jowett to withdraw from High Table at college to lodgings in Broad Street.

==Heretical controversialist==

As early as 1839, Stanley had joined with [[Archibald Campbell Tait]], the future [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], in advocating certain university reforms. From 1846 onwards, Jowett threw himself into this movement, which in 1848 became general amongst the younger and more thoughtful fellows, until it took effect in the commission of 1850 and the act of 1854. Jowett then concentrated on [[theology]]: he spent the summers of 1845 and 1846 in Germany with Stanley, and became an eager student of German criticism and speculation. His views became more than radical, they were heretical, which severely curtailed prospects for advancement within the walls of the conformity of Anglican Oxford. Amongst the writings of that period he was most impressed by those of [[Ferdinand Christian Baur|F.C. Baur]]. But he never ceased to exercise an independent judgment, and his work on [[Paul of Tarsus|St Paul]], which appeared in 1855, was the result of much original reflection and inquiry. Benjamin Jowett found a friend and correspondent in [[Florence Nightingale]], but whether there was any romantic attachment is unclear. It has been suggested that he belatedly proposed marriage, but was rejected, and lived the latter part of his life in regret that never knew matrimonial bliss. Jowett's didactic and pedagogic nature tended him towards instruction of her complicated character accusing her of exaggeration, an emotional intensity occasioned by hysteria.{{sfn|Bostridge|2015|p=8}} He was a father figure, paternalistic towards a deeply conservative woman, religious, self-censoring and strict in her conduct. Another educational reform, the opening of the [[Indian Civil Service]] to competition, took place at the same time, and Jowett was one of the commission. He had two brothers, William and Alfred who had served and died in India, and he never ceased to take a deep and practical interest in Indian affairs.  After the Second Royal Commission in May 1859 he called Philomela 'the Governess of Governors of India' for her robust dealings with the poor conditions in Calcutta "the natives themselves...educated to cleanliness &amp; health by the enforcement of sanitary regulations in the large towns."&lt;ref&gt;Jowett Letters, p. 163, n3.&lt;/ref&gt; When an old man he visited Claydons, where Margaret Verney donated him a print portrait of Florence which he later bequested in his will to Somerville College.  A. Sorabji, an Indian writer, was a student barrister at Somerville College in 1890s, when the Master of Balliol, pointing to the picture declared her love for him: the story was never confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;see Bostridge's narrative, arguments and quoting of Sorabji, India Calling, (1934), p. 32; Cook, Life of Florence Nightingale contradicted the story that he was ever good for her. (1971)&lt;/ref&gt; In another story entirely Margot Tennant later wife of Henry Asquith, befriended Jowett, only to learn that he had had a "violent...very violent" relationship with Nightingale. Jowett was an ''[[éminence grise]]'' of liberal theology but could be somewhat chaotic in his recollections.{{efn | from a Gentleman's Pocket Daily Companion, 1877, BL 45847, was one of the few that survived Nightngale's executors; and perhaps as unreliable as Margot Tennant's ''Autobiography'' (1920), p. 75}}

==Oxford career==

Jowett was appointed to the [[Regius Professorship of Greek (Oxford)|Regius Professorship of Greek]] in autumn 1855. He had been a tutor of Balliol and a clergyman since 1842 and had devoted himself to the work of tuition: his pupils became his friends for life. He discerned their capabilities and taught them to know themselves. This made him a reputation as "the great tutor."

A great disappointment, his repulse for the mastership of Balliol, also in 1854, appears to have roused him into the completion of his book on ''The Epistles of St Paul''. This work, described by one of his friends as "a miracle of boldness," is full of originality and suggestiveness, but its publication awakened against him a storm of theological opposition from the [[Orthodox Evangelicals]], which followed him more or less through life. Instead of yielding to this, he joined with [[Henry Bristow Wilson]] and [[Rowland Williams (theologian)|Rowland Williams]], who had been similarly attacked, in the production of the volume known as ''[[Essays and Reviews]]''.  This appeared in 1860 and gave rise to a strong outbreak of criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Atherstone|first= Andrew |date=2003|title=Benjamin Jowett's Pauline Commentary: An Atonement Controversy|journal=The Journal of Theological Studies|volume= LIV|issue= 1|pp=139—153|jstor=23968970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jowett's loyalty to those who were prosecuted on this account was no less characteristic than his persistent silence while the augmentation of his salary as Greek professor was withheld. This persecution was continued until 1865, when [[Edward Augustus Freeman|E.A. Freeman]] and [[Charles Isaac Elton|Charles Elton]] discovered by historical research that a breach of the conditions of the professorship had occurred, and [[Christ Church, Oxford]] raised the endowment from £40 a year to £500. Jowett was one of the recipients of Nightingale's three volume work ''Suggestions for Thought'' for proof-reading and criticism.  In the third volume of ''Essays and Reviews'' he contributed ''On the Interpretation of Scripture'' in which he attempted to reconcile her assertion that religion was law and could be unified with science. Her radical thoughts on women's place in the home, and his departure from liberal Anglican theology helped to block his career advancement for a decade to the Mastership of Balliol. By 1860, he was already [[Regius Professor of Greek (Oxford)|Regius Professor of Greek]] and a [[Fellow of Balliol]], but an increase in his stipend was withheld.  While the work gained fulsome praise from philosopher-politician John Stuart Mill, it profoundly shook the more traditional establishment's fervent belief that the working-classes would continue to worship in parish churches. Recognition that this was no longer so, was just one of the theological departures.{{sfn|Bostridge|2015|pp=369—372}} In October 1862 he was invited to [[Oak Hill Park]] to offer Florence the sacrament. Accepting the prospect with relish, he nonetheless consulted with Archbishop Tait for permission.  Many of his letters to her and Mrs Bracebridge have survived; their religion was tinged with a mutual respect for their shared common interests and intellectual gifts.{{sfn|Bostridge|2015|pp=389—390}} Also included is an unflattering description of a middle-aged man.

==Height of intellectual powers==

[[File:Benjamin Jowett.png|thumb|upright|200px|Benjamin Jowett, by [[Leslie Ward|Sir Leslie Ward, 'Spy']], 1876.]]

Meanwhile, Jowett's influence at Oxford had steadily increased; he had his favourites. It culminated when the country clergy, provoked by the final acquittal of the essayists, had voted in convocation against the endowment of the Greek chair. Jowett's pupils, who were now drawn from the university at large, supported him with enthusiasm.  He made friends with the Freemantles (related to Gladstone's minister, Grant Duff), and the Verneys at Claydons. On holiday in Derbyshire he would write to them and Florence describing his findings at Lea Hurst in 1864. One historian has identified his relations with her being most intense 1863 to 1866: in April 1864, he had advised Florence Nightingale to prevent Garibaldi, her world-famous guest, from stirring up trouble in Italy. This coincided with a big philosophical argument in which they were poles apart: there were three major pieces of sanitary legislation, the Contagious Diseases Acts which in 1870 came under fire from [[Josephine Butler]], a feminist and social reformer, who wished their repeal. The rational theologian in Jowett warned Nightingale to ignore those "on the wrong tack".&lt;ref&gt;Jowett to Nightingale, 30 Jan 1870, Letters, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; Rising incidents of venereal disease posed a moral question about whether to regulate prostitution, when men still might die from the infection. Policing of the health conditions became a case for which women's rights campaigners demanded repeal, they launched a vociferous attack in the press on amongst other, Jowett. He was a compassionate man, visiting the selfless Hilary Bonham Carter dying from cancer, in May 1865 administering his own brand of prayer and kindness.&lt;ref&gt;Jowett Letters, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; He was a staunch critic of the Poor Laws that condemned the poor, sick, and vulnerable to appalling degradation, left people to starve. In London alone in 1866 there 21,500 patients with no trained nurses. But his influence could be profound in 1874 he criticised her impending Report of Land Tenure in India to the extent that it was never published because she "could lose influence".{{sfn|Bostridge|2015|p=477}}

In the midst of other labours,&lt;!--Please do not alter the spellings--&gt; Jowett had been quietly exerting his influence so as to conciliate all shades of liberal opinion, and bring them to bear upon the abolition of the theological test, which was still required for the [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge)|M.A.]] and other degrees, and for university and college offices.  He spoke at an important meeting upon this question in London on 10 June 1864, which laid the ground for the [[Universities Tests Act 1871|University Tests Act of 1871]], directly after he had made as Master, Balliol College "a sort of heaven on earth" in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Jowett Letters, xxvi-xxvii&lt;/ref&gt;  The liberal reforms to college commenced radical scientific enquiries into the nature of man's existence questioning empirical data on the basis of findings the meaning of Christianity and its very existence.  The shock waves reverberated through the liberal establishment into the founding of the Labour Party and the New Liberalism of the Great War.

In connection with the Greek professorship, Jowett had undertaken a work on [[Plato]] which grew into a complete translation of the ''Dialogues'' with introductory essays, for which Florence Nightingale's criticism was gratefully received.{{sfn|Bostridge|2015|p=38}} At this he laboured in vacation time for at least ten years. He argued that platonic love between men was devoid of sexual activity, though [[Walter Pater]] would later disagree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720001606/http://www.sydneyline.com/Higher%20Sodomy.htm|archive-date=2008-07-20|url=http://www.sydneyline.com/Higher%20Sodomy.htm|date=September 1998|work=[[The Australian's Review of Books]]|title=The Remains of the Gay|first=Keith |last=Windschuttle|author-link=Keith Windschuttle}}&lt;/ref&gt; He showed no interest in offering his own opinion on God, theology in his translations, in several editions of Plato's works. The educated middle-classes were looking for an answer to how Plato could be relevant to Victorians. But his interest in theology had not abated, and his thoughts found an outlet in occasional preaching. The university pulpit, indeed, was closed to him, but several congregations in [[London]] delighted in his sermons, and from 1866 until the year of his death he preached annually in [[Westminster Abbey]], where Stanley had become Dean in 1863. Three volumes of selected sermons were published posthumously. The years 1865–70 were occupied with assiduous teaching and writing.

Amongst his pupils at Balliol were men destined to high positions in the state, whose parents had thus shown their confidence in the supposed heretic, and gratitude on this account was added to other motives for his unsparing efforts in tuition. In 1870, [[Robert Scott (Balliol)|Robert Scott]], [[Master (college)|Master]] of Balliol College, was promoted to the deanery of [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] and Jowett, finally after years of trying, was elected to the vacant Mastership by the fellows of Balliol.  Jowett attributed this arrangement to his liberal friend [[Robert Lowe, 1st Viscount Sherbrooke|Robert Lowe]], afterwards Lord Sherbrooke (at that time a member of [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone's]] ministry). From the vantage-ground of this long-coveted position the Plato was published in 1871. It had a great and well-deserved success. While scholars criticized particular renderings (and there were many small errors to be removed in subsequent editions), it was generally agreed that he had succeeded in making Plato an English classic.

[[File:Rossetti-4.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Benjamin Jowett, by [[Max Beerbohm]], 1922.]]

From 1866, his authority in Balliol had been paramount, and various reforms in college had been due to his initiative. The opposing minority were now powerless, and the younger fellows who had been his pupils were more inclined to follow him than others would have been. There was no obstacle to the continued exercise of his firm and reasonable will. He still knew the undergraduates individually, and watched their progress with a vigilant eye. His influence in the University was less assured. The pulpit of [[University Church of St Mary the Virgin|St Mary's]], the University church, was no longer closed to him, but the success of Balliol in the schools gave rise to jealousy in other colleges, and old prejudices did not suddenly give way; while a new movement in favour of "the endowment of research" ran counter to his immediate purposes.

Meanwhile, the tutorships in other colleges, and some of the headships also, were being filled with Balliol men, and Jowett's former pupils were prominent in both houses of parliament and at the bar. He continued the practice, which he had commenced in 1848, of taking with him a small party of undergraduates in vacation time, and working with them in one of his favourite haunts, at [[Askrigg]] in [[Wensleydale]], or Tummel Bridget or later at [[West Malvern]]. Included in this list was [[Abel Hendy Jones Greenidge]] who became recognised as equal to the great classical scholar [[Theodor Mommsen]]. The new hall (1876), the organ there, entirely his gift (1835) and the [[cricket]] ground (1889), remain as external monuments of the master's activity.  Neither business nor the many claims of friendship interrupted literary work.  The six or seven weeks of the long vacation, during which he had pupils with him, were mainly employed in writing. The translation of [[Aristotle]]'s [https://archive.org/details/aristotlespoliti00arisuoft ''Politics''], the revision of Plato, and, above all, the translation of [[Thucydides]] many times revised, occupied several years. The edition of the ''Republic'', undertaken in 1856, remained unfinished, but was continued with the help of Professor [[Lewis Campbell (classicist)|Lewis Campbell]].

Other literary plans were not to take effect — an ''Essay on the Religions of the World'', a ''Commentary on the Gospels'', a ''Life of Christ'', a volume on ''Moral Ideas''. Such plans were frustrated, not only by his practical avocations, but by his determination to finish what he had begun, and the fastidious self-criticism which it took so long to satisfy. The book on ''Morals'' might, however, have been written but for the heavy burden of the [[chancellor (education)|vice-chancellorship]], which he was induced to accept in 1882,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/about/organisation/university-officers/vice-chancellor/previous-Vice-Chancellors|title=Previous Vice-Chancellors | publisher=[[University of Oxford]], UK|accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the hope, only partially fulfilled, of securing many improvements for Oxford University. The [[Vice-Chancellor]] was ''ex officio'' a delegate of the [[Oxford University Press]], where he hoped to effect much; and a plan for draining the [[Thames Valley]], which he had now the power of initiating, was one on which his mind had dwelt for many years.

However, one plan that certainly came to fruition to great applause was the co-operation with Florence Nightingale to bring a lecture tour to Oxford for undergraduates training in the agricultural sciences for the Indian Civil Service. It was supported by economist Arnold Toynbee, also at Balliol, and W R Robertson, Principal of Madras Agricultural College. For the first time, Indians would receive a proper education in the technical aspects of forestry and farming.{{sfn|Bostridge|2015|p=494}}

==Later life and death==

[[File:Portrait of B. Jowett.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Benjamin Jowett.]]

The exhausting labours of the vice-chancellorship were followed by illness (1887); after this he relinquished the hope of producing any great original writing. His literary industry was thenceforth confined to a commentary on the ''Republic'' of Plato, and some essays on [[Aristotle]] which were to have formed a companion volume to the translation of the ''Politics''. The essays which should have accompanied the translation of [[Thucydides]] were never written. Jowett, who never married, died on 1 October 1893 in Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goodwin|first= William W. |date=1893–94|jstor=20020575|title=Benjamin Jowett|journal=Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences|volume= XXIX|pp=460–462}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funeral was one of the most impressive ever seen in that city. The pall-bearers were seven heads of colleges and the provost of [[Eton College|Eton]], all old pupils.

Theologian, tutor, University reformer, renowned Master of an Oxford college, Jowett's best claim to the remembrance of succeeding generations was his greatness as a [[morality|moral]] teacher. Many of the most prominent Englishmen of the day were his pupils and owed much of what they were to his precept and example, his penetrative sympathy, his insistent criticism, and his unwearying friendship. Seldom have ideal aims been so steadily pursued with so clear a recognition of practical limitations. "Dear (tho perfidious) Professor" Jowett's theological work was transitional; yet has an element of permanence, "Mr Jowett put as much of his genius into Plato as Plato did into Mr Jowett', eulogised Florence Nightingale on her old friend.&lt;ref&gt;Nightingale to Jowett, 7 Aug 1871, Letters, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bostridge|2015|p=393}}

As has been said of another thinker, he was "one of those deeply religious men who, when crude theological notions are being revised and called in question seek to put new life into theology by wider and more humane ideas." In earlier life he had been a zealous student of [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]], and to the end he never ceased to cultivate the philosophic spirit; but he had little confidence in metaphysical systems, and sought rather to translate philosophy into the wisdom of life. As a classical scholar, his scorn of littlenesses sometimes led him into the neglect of minutiae, but he had the higher merit of interpreting ideas. A well-known [[Balliol rhyme]] about him runs:{{quote|Here come I, my name is Jowett.&lt;br /&gt;All there is to know I know it.&lt;br /&gt;I am Master of this College,&lt;br /&gt;What I don't know isn't knowledge!}}

Jowett is buried in [[St Sepulchre's Cemetery]] off [[Walton Street, Oxford|Walton Street]] in [[Oxford]].

'''Roman Catholic Marian music''' shares a trait with some other forms of [[Christian music]] in adding another emotional dimension to the process of veneration and in being used in various Marian ceremonies and feasts. Marian music is now an ''inherent element'' in many aspects of the veneration of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Blessed Virgin Mary]] in [[Roman Catholic Mariology]].

Throughout the centuries Marian music has grown and progressed, and witnessed a resurgence along with the [[Renaissance]], e.g. with the composition of the [[Ave Maria]] [[motet]] by [[Josquin des Prez]]. The tradition continued with a number of great composers up to the late 19th century, e.g. with [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''Ave Maria'' in 1880 followed by his ''Laudi alla Vergine Maria''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Ave_Maria_(Giuseppe_Verdi)|title=Ave Maria (Giuseppe Verdi) - ChoralWiki|website=www.cpdl.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Laudi_alla_Vergine_Maria_(Giuseppe_Verdi)|title=Laudi alla Vergine Maria (Giuseppe Verdi) - ChoralWiki|website=www.cpdl.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saint Ambrose==

One of the oldest Marian intonations is credited to Saint [[Ambrose of Milan]] (339-374).  The Church names an ancient liturgy after him ([[Ambrosian Rite]]), which is actually older but nonetheless traditionally attributed to him.&lt;ref&gt;Paredi, Marienlexikon, 176&lt;/ref&gt; Some 870 parishes in the diocese of [[Milan]] still use the ancient Ambrosian rite. Several Ambrosian rite Marian texts were intonated{{explain|date=October 2015}}, for example the  famous Gaude:&lt;ref&gt;Paredi 176&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Gaude et latare
:Exultation angelorum
:Gaude domini virgo
:Prophetarum gaudium
:Gaudeas benedicta
:Dominus tecum est
:Gaude, que per angelum gaudium mundi suscepisti
:Gaude que genuisti factorum et Dominum
:Gaudeas que dignas es esse mater Christi''

Marian hymns by Ambrose include the ''Confractorium'' from the Christmas liturgy and in a poetic creation of Saint Ambrose celebrating the Mother of God: ''Intende, qui Regis Israel.''&lt;ref&gt;Paredi 177&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marian music for the Liturgy of the Hours==

[[Image:Salve Regina.png|right|frameless|upright=1.5]]
One of the earliest medieval Marian compositions is the popular [[Salve Regina]] in [[Latin]] from a Benedictine monk at the Reichenau Island (Lake Constance), which exists in several Gregorian versions. The liturgy of the hour includes several offices to be sung. At the close of the Office, one of four ''[[Marian antiphon]]s'' is sung. These songs, ''[[Alma Redemptoris Mater]], [[Ave Regina Caelorum]], [[Regina Coeli]],'' and ''[[Salve Regina]]'', have been described as "among the most beautiful creations of the late Middle Ages."&lt;ref&gt;Willi Apel, ''Gregorian Chant'' p. 404.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{listen|filename=Alma Redemptoris Mater.ogg|title=Alma Redemptoris Mater|description=Marian antiphon sung at Compline and Lauds between the First Sunday of Advent and Candlemas|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Other Marian supplications exist in numerous Latin versions as well.&lt;ref&gt;(Sub tuum praesidium, Seven Dolours of the Virgin, Seven Joys of the Virgin )&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to trace the beginning of non-[[Gregorian chant|Gregorian]] Marian liturgical music. In the year 1277 [[Pope Nicholas III]] prescribed  rules for liturgy in Roman churches.&lt;ref name="Bäumer, 652"&gt;Bäumer, 652&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, in 1280, [[Petrus de Cruce]] published his Marian anthem ''Ave virgo regia, Ave gloriosa O maria Maris stella.''  Later, composer [[Pérotin]] followed with his ''Alleluja, Navitatis gloriosae virginis,'' to be sung at the feast of the birth of Mary.  Marian motets became very popular in the Middle Ages, a large collection of which is in St. Paul Cathedral in London.&lt;ref name="Bäumer, 652"/&gt;  [[Pope John XXII]] (1316–34) issued the [[apostolic constitution]] ''Docta SS Patrum'' about Church music. It was the first modern music regulations for musical presentation during the liturgy&lt;ref name="Bäumer, 652"/&gt;

[[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]]'s [[Vespro della Beata Vergine 1610|''Vespro della Beata Vergine'']] contains distinctly Marian texts among its 13 movements, though the composer's intention for the work as a whole is debated. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] composed in honour of the Virgin Mary Latin Masses and several shorter operas.&lt;ref&gt;Dixit &amp; Magnificat KV 193:  C-Major,
Regina Coeli KV 108:  C- Major,  
Regina Coeli KV 127:  B- Major, 
Graduale Sancta Maria KV 273, 
Offertorium Alma Dei creatoris KV 277, 
Litaniae de Beata Maria Virgine KV 109&lt;/ref&gt;  Other known classic composers with Marian compositions mainly in Latin include [[Orlando di Lasso]] and [[Franz Schubert]].

[[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]], [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]], [[Mozart]], [[Haydn]], and others are well-known composers who contributed to Marian music. Less known is the fact that before 1802, the [[secularisation]], many religious congregations had their own composers.&lt;ref&gt;In Germany, in the monastery of  Andechs, Father Nonnosus Madleder, in Ottobeuren, Father Franx Schnizer, in Irsee Father Meinrad Spiess, and in Banz&lt;/ref&gt;  A totally unknown Father [[Valentin Rathgeber]], OSB, (1682–1750) wrote 43 Masses, 164 offertories, 24 concerts, and 44 Marian antiphones. [[Missa de Beata Virgine (disambiguation)|''Missa de Beata Virgine'']] and the  [[Messe de Nostre Dame]] are examples of individual contributions. [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]]'s [[Vespro della Beata Vergine 1610|''Vespro della Beata Vergine'']] has remained structurally unchanged for the past 1500 years. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] composed in honour of the Virgin Mary Latin Masses and several shorter operas.&lt;ref&gt;Dixit &amp; Magnificat KV 193:  C-Major,
Regina Coeli KV 108:  C- Major,
Regina Coeli KV 127:  B- Major,
Graduale Sancta Maria KV 273,
Offertorium Alma Dei creatoris KV 277,
Litaniae de Beata Maria Virgine KV 109&lt;/ref&gt;  Other known classic composers with Marian compositions mainly in Latin include [[Orlando di Lasso]] and [[Franz Schubert]].

==Marian plays and songs==

In 12th century France the tradition began of Christmas dramas, in which the nativity events are reproduced by actors. This became popular in other European countries and is seen as the origin of popular Christmas carols, which were an integral part of the Christmas drama. These early Christmas songs are largely devotions to the Mother of God. Early manifestations are in Bavaria in the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Kloster Benediktbeuren, Seckau,&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, Easter songs are often converted into Marian hymns, for example the hymn ''Te virgini Mariae laudes concinant Christianae''. The assumption of Mary is praised in numerous songs from the 10th century,&lt;ref&gt;Ave dei genitrx …cuius nunc regni dominando, tu possides ut mater filii.&lt;/ref&gt; In several songs, Mary is praised to be above all saints and angels and participates in the kingdom of her son. Her assumption is “wished by the faithful people” in a song from the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Exulta exaltata, Gottschalk von Limburg&lt;/ref&gt;  The Marian songs and hymns in this epoch are too numerous to mention. They include pious excitement, even some exaggerations, and valuable insights into the Marian belief, especially in the assumption.

==Ave, salve, and gaude hymns==

Examples of Ave (Hail Mary) songs include:&lt;ref&gt;Mäumker, Kirchenlieder aus dem 12th Jahrhundert,&lt;/ref&gt;  
: Ave dei genitrix, caelstium terrestrium infernorum domina;
: Ave spes mundi, Maria, ave mitis, ave pia
: Ave plena, signulari gratia

Examples of Salve songs include:
:Salve regina, mater misericordiae
: Salve prodis Davidis
: Salve Mater Misericordiae

Gaude (Rejoice) hymns include:
:Gaude Maria templum summae majestatis
:Gaude mater luminis
:Gaude, plaude, clara Rosa

Vale (farewell) and Mater dolorosa (mother of sorrows) are also subjects of numerous Marian hymns.&lt;ref&gt;Engelhardt, Marienkunde, 1336&lt;/ref&gt;

==Holy Mass music==

It seems that settings of the [[Ordinary of the Mass]] are a latter development than Liturgy of the Hours music .&lt;ref name="Bäumer, 652"/&gt;  Modern [[Kyriale]]s designate two [[Gregorian chant]] [[mass (music)|Mass settings]] for Marian feasts, ''[[Missa de Beata Virgine (disambiguation)|In solemnitatibus et Festis Beatae Mariae Virginis]] ''and'' in Festis et Memoriis''.&lt;ref&gt;Graduale Romanum,  Kyriale IX And X.&lt;/ref&gt;  Before the [[Council of Trent]] the [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|''Gloria'']] of the first of these contained the [[trope (music)|trope]] ''Spiritus et alme orphanorum paraclete'', heard in [[Josquin des Pres|Josquin]]'s ''[[Missa de Beata Virgine (Josquin)|Missa de Beata Virgine]]'' but not in [[Guillaume de Machault|Machault]]'s [[Messe de Nostre Dame]] which was written as a [[Votive Mass]]. The [[list of compositions by Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]] includes numerous Marian masses:

* Missa Salve Regina
* Missa Alma Redemptoris
* Missa Assumpta est Maria
* Missa Regina coeli
* Missa de beata Virgine
* Missa Ave Regina coelorum
* Missa Descendit Angelus Domini
* Missa O Virgo simul et Mater

==Marian music during the Baroque period==

The Marian music in the [[Baroque music|baroque period]] is strongly influenced by the Latin tradition, but develops its own characteristics. Marian songs venerate her exceptional sanctity. Many Marian songs have the form of litanies, expressing veneration of Mary. Others moralize the faithful in light of her virtuous life.&lt;ref&gt;Büse, Marienkunde,585&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Poland]] and [[Hungary]], baroque Marian compositions stress her national protective powers for the Polish and Hungarian nation, an aspect largely missing in Italy, France, and Germany, where Mary is likely to be called upon to protect a city or region rather than a nation.&lt;ref&gt;Büse 585&lt;/ref&gt;  Many  Latin Marian hymns are now translated into a vernacular language, especially in Germany under the influence of Lutheran use of the [[vernacular]] in [[liturgy]]. Latin texts are often enriched with flowery reverences and Marian praises. Like Marian poetry, Marian music has flourished most in Italy, Spain, Portugal, and France, countries uninfluenced by the reformation.&lt;ref&gt;Büse 589&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the German [[German Mediatisation|secularisations of 1802]] many religious congregations had their own composers. In the monastery of  [[Andechs]], Father Nonnosus Madleder, in [[Ottobeuren]], Father Franx Schnizer, in [[Irsee]], Father Meinrad Spiess, and in Banz, Father [[Valentin Rathgeber]], OSB, (1682–1750): 43 Masses, 164 offertories, 24 concerts, and 44 Marian antiphones. {{explain|date=October 2015}}&lt;!-- Is that between the 4 of them? --&gt;

==Marian music in the Enlightenment era==

Besides the above-mentioned Vespers, [[Joseph Haydn]] wrote several Marian [[Musical composition|composition]]s including two famous Marian Masses, the ''Missa Cellensis in honorem Beatissimae Virginis Mariae,'' No. 5 in E flat major, also known as the ''Grosse Orgelmesse'' (Great Organ Mass) (H. 22/4) (1766) and the ''[[Missa Cellensis in honorem Beatissimae Virginis Mariae]]'' No. 3 in C major (H. 22/5) (1766–73).

== Romantic Marian music ==
Several [[Motets (Bruckner)|motets by Anton Bruckner]] are related to Mary, including three settings of [[Ave Maria (Bruckner)|Ave Maria]]. Max Reger composed the motet ''[[Unser lieben Frauen Traum]]'' in 1914.

== Contemporary Marian music ==
Francis Poulenc composed ''[[Litanies à la Vierge Noire]]'' and a [[Stabat Mater (Poulenc)|Stabat Mater]] in 1950. Arvo Pärt composed several works related to Mary, including a [[Magnificat (Pärt)|Magnificat]] in 1989 and a [[Salve Regina (Pärt)|Salve Regina]] in 2001.

The Franciscan [[Helmut Schlegel]] wrote in 2009 a hymn, "[[Glauben können wie du]]", addressing Mary and wanting to imitate her virtues [[Theological virtues|faith, hope and love]]. It was included in 2015 in an oratorio, ''[[Laudato si' (oratorio)|Laudato si']]'', which narrates stations of her life, quoting the [[Magnificat]].

'''Disemvoweling''', '''disemvowelling''' (see [[American and British English spelling differences#Doubled in British English|doubled ''L'']]), or '''disemvowelment''' of a piece of [[alphabet]]ic text is rewriting it with all the [[vowel letter]]s removed.&lt;ref name="Macmillan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionaries.com/wordoftheweek/archive/070813-disemvowelling.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070624125730/http://www.macmillandictionaries.com/wordoftheweek/archive/070813-disemvowelling.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 June 2007 |title=disemvowelling or disemvoweling |last=Maxwell |first=Kerry |date=13 August 2007 |website=Word of the Week Archive |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] |accessdate=6 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=May 2014}} This original sentence:

Disemvoweling is a common feature of [[SMS language]]&lt;ref name="Macmillan" /&gt; as disemvoweling requires little [[cognitive load|cognitive effort]]{{Citation needed|reason=citation needed to prove claim|date=May 2014}} to read, so it is often used where space is costly. The word ''disemvoweling'' is a [[portmanteau]] combining ''vowel'' and ''[[Disembowelment|disembowel]]''.&lt;ref name="Macmillan" /&gt;

The word was used with precisely this meaning in the 1939 novel ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' (p.&amp;nbsp;515).

==History==
A technique dubbed ''splat out'' was used by [[Usenet]] moderators to prevent [[flamewar]]s, by substituting a "splat" (i.e., [[asterisk]]) for some letters, often the vowels, of highly charged words in postings. Examples include ''[[Godwin's Law|Nazi]]''→''N*z*'', ''[[Creation–evolution controversy|evolution]]''→''*v*l*t**n'', ''[[gun control]]''→''g*n c*ntr*l''. "The purpose is not to make the word unrecognizable but to make it [[use–mention distinction|a mention rather than a use]]."&lt;ref name="splatout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catb.org/jargon/html/S/splat-out.html|title=splat out|last=Raymond |first=Eric |authorlink=Eric S.

==Criticism==
In July 2008, ''New York Times'' reporter Noam Cohen criticized disemvoweling as a moderation tool, citing a June 2008 dispute about the deletion of all posts on ''Boing Boing'' that mentioned sex columnist [[Violet Blue (author)|Violet Blue]]{{Citation needed|reason=citation needed to prove claim|date=May 2014}}
. In the ''Boing Boing'' comment threads resulting from this controversy, Nielsen Hayden used the disemvoweling technique. Cohen noted that disemvoweling was "Not quite censorship, but not quite unfettered commentary either."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Noam|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/07/business/media/07link.html|title=Poof!

Matt Baumgartner, a blogger at the [[Times Union (Albany)|Albany ''Times Union'']], reported in August 2009 that the newspaper's lawyers had told him to stop disemvoweling comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.timesunion.com/baumgartner/a-e-i-o-u-and-sometimes-why/1641/|title=A, E, I, O, U and sometimes why|last=Baumgartner |first=Matt |date=31 August 2009|website=City Brights|publisher=[[Times Union (Albany)|Times Union]] |accessdate=6 October 2009 |location=Albany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
Nielsen Hayden originally disemvoweled postings manually, using [[Microsoft Word]]. Because the letter Y is sometimes a vowel and sometimes a consonant, there are a variety of ways to treat it. Nielsen Hayden's policy was never to remove Y, in order to maintain legibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/008862.html#181688|title=Moderation certificate: Comment #10|last=Nielsen Hayden |first=Teresa |date=18 April 2007|website=Making Light |authorlink=Teresa Nielsen Hayden |accessdate=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique has been facilitated by [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] [[filter (software)|filters]] to automate the process. The first, for [[MovableType]], was written in 2002;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bryant.livejournal.com/669399.html |title=Deprecating Disemvowelment |author=Bryant |date=8 March 2009 |accessdate=6 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629133337/http://bryant.livejournal.com/669399.html |archivedate=29 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; others are available for [[WordPress]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/search.php?q=Disemvowel Disemvowel plugins]&lt;/ref&gt; and other content management systems.

'''Domain knowledge''' is [[knowledge]] of a specific, specialized discipline or field, in contrast to [[general knowledge]], or domain-independent knowledge.  The term is often used in reference to a more general discipline, as, for example, in describing a software engineer who has general knowledge of programming, as well as domain knowledge about the pharmaceutical industry.  People who have domain knowledge, are often considered [[Domain expert|specialists or experts]] in the field.

==Knowledge capture==
In [[software engineering]] ''domain knowledge'' is knowledge about the environment in which the target system operates, for example, [[software agent]]s. Domain knowledge usually must be learned from software users in the domain (as domain specialists/experts), rather than from software developers. It may include user workflows, data pipelines, business policies, configurations and constraints and is crucial in the development of a software application. Expert’s domain knowledge (frequently informal and ill-structured) is transformed in computer programs and active data, for example in a set of rules in knowledge bases, by [[knowledge engineer]]s.

Communicating between end-users and software developers is often difficult. They  must find a common language to communicate in. Developing enough shared vocabulary to communicate can often take a while.

The same knowledge can be included in different domain knowledge.
Knowledge which may be applicable across a number of domains is called ''domain-independent'' knowledge, for example [[logic]]s and mathematics.
Operations on domain knowledge are performed by [[meta-knowledge]].

In [[philosophy]], '''epistemic theories of truth''' are attempts to analyze the [[notion (philosophy)|notion]] of [[truth]] in terms of [[epistemic]] notions such as [[knowledge]], [[belief]], [[acceptance]], [[verificationist|verification]], [[Theory of justification|justification]], and [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]]. 

A variety of such conceptions can be classified into [[verificationist]] theories, [[perspectivalism|perspectivalist]] or [[relativist]] theories, and [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] theories.

Verificationism is based on verifying [[proposition]]s. The distinctive claim of verificationism is that the result of such verifications is, by definition, [[truth]]. That is, truth is reducible to this process of [[verification theory|verification]].
 
According to perspectivalism and [[relativism]], a [[proposition]] is only true relative to a particular perspective. Roughly, a proposition is true relative to a perspective [[if and only if]] it is accepted, endorsed, or [[legitimated]] by that perspective.

Many authors writing on the topic of the notion of truth advocate or endorse combinations of the following positions. Each of these epistemic conceptions of truth can be subjected to various criticisms. Some criticisms apply across the board, while others are more specific.

==Verificationist views==
{{Main|Verificationism}}

The two main kinds of verification philosophies are [[positivism (philosophy)|positivism]] and [[A priori and a posteriori|a-priori]]sm.

In [[positivism (philosophy)|positivism]], a proposition is meaningful, and thus capable of being true or false, if and only if it is verifiable by [[sense|sensory]] [[experience]]s.

A-priorism, often used in the [[Field of study|domains]] of [[logic]] and [[mathematics]], holds a proposition true if and only if ''a priori'' reasoning can verify it.  In the related [[certainty theory]], associated with [[Descartes]] and [[Spinoza]], a proposition is true if and only if it is known with [[certainty]].

[[Logical positivism]] attempts to combine positivism with a version of a-priorism.

Another theory of truth which is related to a-priorism is the concept-containment theory of truth. The concept-containment theory of truth is the view that a proposition is true if and only if the concept of the predicate of the proposition is "contained in" the concept of the subject. For example, the proposition that bachelors are unmarried men is true, on this view, because the concept of the predicate (unmarried men) is contained in the concept of the subject (bachelor). A contemporary reading of the concept-containment theory of truth is to say that every true proposition is an [[logical truth|analytically true]] proposition.

==Perspectivist views==
According to perspectivalism and [[relativism]], a proposition is only true relative to a particular perspective. The [[Sophists]]' relativist and [[Nietzsche]]'s philosophy are some of the most famous examples of such perspectivalism. There are four main versions of perspectivalism, and some interesting subdivisions:

===Individual perspectivalism===
According to individual perspectivalism, perspectives are the points of view of particular individual persons. So, a proposition is true for a person if and only if it is accepted or believed by that person (i.e., "true for me").

===Discourse perspectivalism===
According to discourse perspectivalism, a perspective is simply any system of [[discourse]], and it is a matter of [[Convention (norm)|convention]] which one chooses. A proposition is true relative to that particular discourse if and only if it is somehow produced (or "[[legitimated]]") by the methods of that particular discourse. An example of this appears in the [[philosophy of mathematics]]: [[formalism (mathematics)|formalism]]. A proposition is true relative to a set of assumptions just in case it is a [[deductive reasoning|deductive]] consequence of those assumptions.

===Collectivist perspectivalism===
In [[collectivist perspectivalism]], perspectives are understood as collectivities of people ([[cultures]], [[traditions]], etc.). There are, roughly, three versions of collectivism:

====Consensus====
A perspective is, roughly, the broad opinions, and perhaps [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] and [[Practice (social theory)|practices]], of a [[community]] of people, perhaps all having some special feature in common. So, a proposition is true (for a community C) if, and only if, there is a [[consensus]] amongst the members of C for believing it.

====Power====
In the power-oriented view, a perspective is a [[community]] enforced by [[power (sociology)|power]], [[authority]], [[Armed forces|military might]], [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]], etc. So, a proposition is true if it "makes us powerful" or is "produced by power", thus the slogan "truth is power"{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.

This view of truth as a political stake may be loosely associated with [[Heidegger]] or with [[Michel Foucault]]'s specific analysis of [[Philosophy of history#Michel Foucault's analysis of historical and political discourse|historical and political discourse]], as well as with some [[social constructionism|social constructivist]]s.

However, the [[Nazi mysticism]] of a [[communitarianism|communitarian]] "[[Blood and soil|Blood community]]" conception radically differs from Heidegger or Foucault's criticism of the notion of the individual or collective [[subject (philosophy)|subject]].

====Marxist====
Truth-generating perspectives are [[collectives]] opposed to, or engaged in struggle against, power and [[authority]]. For example, the collective perspective of the "[[proletariat]]". So, proposition is true if it is the "product of political struggle" for the "[[freedom (political)|emancipation]] of the workers" ([[Theodor Adorno|Adorno]]). This view is again associated with some [[social constructivist]]s (e.g., [[feminism|feminist]] [[epistemologists]]).

===Transcendental perspectivalism===
On this conception, a truth-conferring perspective is something [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]], and outside immediate human reach. The idea is that there is a transcendental or ideal [[epistemic perspective]] and truth is, roughly, what is accepted or recognized-as-true from that ideal perspective. There are two [[subvarieties]] of [[transcendental perspectivalism]]:

====Coherentism====
The ideal epistemic perspective is the set of "maximally [[coherentism|coherent]] and [[consistent]] propositions". A proposition is true if and only if it is a member of this maximally coherent and consistent set of propositions (associated with several [[Germany|German]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] 19th century [[idealist]]s).

====Theological perspectivalism====
Theologically, the ideal epistemic perspective is that of [[God]] ("God's point of view"). From this perspective, a proposition is true if and only if it agrees with the thoughts of God.

==Pragmatic views==
{{Main|Pragmatic theory of truth}}

Although the [[pragmatic theory of truth]] is not strictly classifiable as an epistemic theory of truth, it does bear a relationship to theories of truth that are based on concepts of inquiry and knowledge.

The ideal epistemic perspective is that of "[[completed science]]", which will appear in the (temporal) "limit of scientific inquiry". A proposition is true if and only if, in the long run it will come to be accepted by a group of [[inquirers]] using scientific [[rational inquiry]]. This can also be [[modalized]]: a proposition is true if, and only if, in the long run it would come to be accepted by a group of inquirers, if they were to use scientific rational inquiry. This view is thus a modification of the consensus view. The consensus need to satisfy certain constraints in order for the accepted propositions to be true. For example, the methods used must be those of scientific inquiry ([[criticism]], observation, [[reproducibility]], etc.).  This "modification" of the consensus view is an appeal to the correspondence theory of truth, which is opposed to the consensus theory of truth. 

Long-run scientific pragmatism was defended by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].  A variant of this viewpoint is associated with [[Jürgen Habermas]], though he later abandoned it.

'''Fruitlands''' was a [[Utopia]]n agrarian [[commune (intentional community)|commune]] established in [[Harvard, Massachusetts]], by [[Amos Bronson Alcott]] and [[Charles Lane (transcendentalist)|Charles Lane]] in the 1840s, based on [[Transcendentalist]] principles.  An account of its less-than-successful activities can be found in ''[[Transcendental Wild Oats]]'' by Alcott's daughter [[Louisa May Alcott]].{{sfn|Francis|2010|pp=250-}}

Lane purchased what was known as the Wyman farm and its {{convert|90|acre|ha}}, which also included a dilapidated house and barn. Residents of Fruitlands ate no animal substances, drank only water, bathed in unheated water and "no artificial light would prolong dark hours or cost them the brightness of morning."&lt;ref&gt;McFarland, Philip. ''Hawthorne in Concord''. New York: Grove Press, 2004. p. 81. {{ISBN|0-8021-1776-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, property was held communally, and no animal labor was used.

The community was short-lived and lasted only seven months. It was dependent on farming, which turned out to be too difficult. The original farmhouse, along with other historic buildings from the area, is now a part of [[Fruitlands Museum]].

==History==
[[File:Fruitlands in 1915.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Fruitlands photographed in 1915]]

Amos Bronson Alcott, a teacher and member of the [[New England Non-Resistance Society]],{{sfn|Rose|1981|p=118}} came up with the idea of Fruitlands in 1841. He traveled to England the following year, where he hoped to find support and people to participate with him in the experiment. England was home to his strongest group of supporters, a group of educators who had founded the [[Alcott House]], a school based on his [[philosophy of education|philosophy of teaching]]. One of his supporters was Charles Lane, who journeyed with him to the United States on October 21, 1842.&lt;ref name=Packer148&gt;Packer, Barbara L. ''The Transcendentalists''.

In May 1843, Lane purchased the {{convert|90|acre|sing=on}} Wyman Farm in [[Harvard, Massachusetts]]&lt;ref name=Packer148/&gt; for $1800. Though Alcott had come up with the idea of Fruitlands himself, he was not involved in purchasing the land, largely because he was penniless after the failure of his [[Temple School, Boston (1830s)|Temple School]] and his subsequent years in [[Concord, Massachusetts]] as a farmer. In July, Alcott announced their plans in ''[[The Dial]]'': "We have made an arrangement with the proprieter of an estate of about a hundred acres, which liberates this tract from human ownership".&lt;ref name=Packer148/&gt; They had officially moved to the farm on June 1 and optimistically named it "Fruitlands" despite only ten old apple trees on the property.&lt;ref name=Packer148/&gt;

In principle, the Fruitlands reformers did not believe in [[Land tenure|purchasing property]]; Lane said the following on the subject: "We do not recognize the purchase of land; but its redemption from the debasing state of proprium, or property, to divine uses, we clearly understand; where those whom the world esteems owners are found yielding their individual rights to the Supreme Owner"&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Jessica. "[http://www.vcu.edu/engweb/transcendentalism/ideas/fruitlands.html Transcendental Ideas: Social Reform]". American Transcendentalism Web. 20 Feb. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The commune attracted 14 residents, including the Alcott and Lane families. By July, the community had succeeded in planting {{convert|8|acre}} of grains, one of vegetables, and one of melons.{{sfn|Felton |2006|p=132}} On July 8, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] visited along with [[William Ellery Channing (poet)|Ellery Channing]]. Although he was impressed by the serenity of the site and the idea of hard work, he cautiously recorded, "I will not prejudge them successful... They look well in July. We will see them in December."{{sfn|Francis|2010|pp=190-1}}

Alcott and Lane collaborated on a letter which was published in the ''[[New-York Tribune|New York Evening Tribune]]'' on September 1 and soon republished elsewhere. In the article, titled "The Consociate Family Life", the duo explained their main purpose was to improve society through "simplicity in diet, plain garments, pure bathing, unsullied dwellings".{{sfn|Francis|2010|pp=207-8}}

Fruitlands ultimately failed the winter after it opened, largely due to food shortages and accompanying unrest in the inhabitants. The rigors of a New England winter proved too severe for the members of the Fruitlands.

==Philosophy==
[[File:Amos Bronson Alcott.jpg|thumb|right|Fruitlands co-founder [[Amos Bronson Alcott]]]]
Many of Alcott's and Lane's ideas were derived from [[Transcendentalism]]. They were influenced by the Transcendental ideas of God not as the traditional view from the Bible but as a world spirit.&lt;ref name=Hankins37&gt;Hankins, Barry. ''The Second Great Awakening and the Transcendentalists''. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 2004: 37. {{ISBN|0-313-31848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcott's view of Transcendentalism was a sort of religious [[anarchism]], a renunciation of the world to focus on the spirit.{{sfn|Rose|1981|p=117}} The members of Fruitlands believed that spiritual regeneration was linked to physical health, that "outward abstinence is a sign of inward fullness".&lt;ref name=Delano118&gt;Delano, Sterling F. ''Brook Farm: The Dark Side of Utopia''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2004: 118. {{ISBN|0-674-01160-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it was based on working together as a community, Fruitlands also hoped for individualistic improvement.&lt;ref name=Hankins37/&gt; Alcott also believed in the perfect intuition of children and, therefore, put a strong emphasis on education and hoped that their innocence would have a rejuvenating effect on elders.{{sfn|Rose|1981|p=197}}

===Economy===
Fruitlands residents, who called themselves "the consociate family",&lt;ref name=Packer148/&gt; wished to separate themselves from the world economy by refraining from trade, having no personal property, and not using hired labor. Alcott and Lane believed that the community could achieve complete freedom only by eliminating economic activity altogether.&lt;ref name=Hankins36&gt;Hankins, Barry. ''The Second Great Awakening and the Transcendentalists''. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 2004: 36. {{ISBN|0-313-31848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcott in particular believed the present economy was evil.{{sfn|Rose|1981|p=118}} To this end, they strove towards self-sufficiency by planning on growing all the food they would need themselves and making only the goods they needed. By accomplishing these two goals, they would eliminate the need to participate in trade or to purchase their food from the outside world. Initially, Bronson Alcott and Lane modeled their ideas about personal property off the [[Shakers]], who held property communally. However, the Shakers were not completely self-sufficient; they traded their hand-made goods for [[coffee]], [[tea]], meat and milk. Bronson Alcott and Lane eliminated the need to trade for these supplies because they eliminated animal products and [[stimulants]] from their diets entirely.

In the end, the Fruitlands community had no effect on the economy of the outside world; Fruitlands allowed its residents to practice their ideals without forcing them to effect any real change.&lt;ref&gt;"Fruitlands." Amos Bronson Alcott Network. 20 Feb. 2008 &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alcott.net/alcott/home/fruitlands.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724033249/http://www.alcott.net/alcott/home/fruitlands.html |archivedate=2008-07-24 |df= }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lifestyle and diet===
Fruitlands residents began their days with a purging cold-water shower&lt;ref name=Delano118/&gt; and subsisted on a simple diet containing no stimulants or animal products. They were [[vegans]], excluding even milk and honey from their diets. “Neither coffee, tea, molasses, nor rice tempts us beyond the bounds of indigenous production,” Lane wrote. “No animal substances neither flesh, butter, cheese, eggs, nor milk pollute our tables, nor corrupt our bodies.” Diet was usually fruit and water; many vegetables—including carrots, beets, and potatoes—were forbidden because they showed a lower nature by growing downward.&lt;ref name=Hankins36/&gt; [[File:The Circumstantial Law.jpg|thumb|left|300px| Greaves' Table of the Circumstantial Law, as revised by Fruitlands co-founder [[Charles Lane (transcendentalist)|Charles Lane]]]]

Fruitlands members wore only linen clothes and canvas shoes; cotton fabric was forbidden because it exploited slave labor and wool was banned because it came from sheep.&lt;ref name=Hankins36/&gt; Bronson Alcott and Lane believed that animals should not be exploited for their meat or their labor, so they used no animals for farming. This arose out of two beliefs: that animals were less intelligent than humans and that, therefore, it was the duty of humans to protect them; and that using animals "tainted" their work and food, since animals were not enlightened and therefore unclean. Eventually, as the winter was coming, Alcott and Lane compromised and allowed an ox and a cow.&lt;ref name=Hankins36/&gt;

==Residents==
There were no formal admission requirements or procedures to join the community at Fruitlands, and there was no official record-keeping of members. Many residents stayed only for a short period of time and most lists are based on the journals of Alcott's wife [[Abby May]].{{sfn|Rose|1981|p=128}} Residents of the Fruitlands came to be called "consecrated cranks" and followed strict principles and virtues. They strongly believed in the ideas of simplicity, sincerity, and brotherly love.

*[[Amos Bronson Alcott]] - Born in 1799, Bronson Alcott was a prominent educator and Transcendentalist who believed in eliminating [[corporal punishment]], and incorporating field trips, [[physical education]], art and music into the curriculum.
*[[Abigail Alcott]] - Abigail was Bronson Alcott's wife and also a reformer. She was one of only two women who lived at Fruitlands, and was primarily responsible for taking care of the house and farm, as well as raising her four children.
*[[Louisa May Alcott]] - The Alcotts' second daughter, her short piece ''[[Transcendental Wild Oats]]'' was written about her experiences at Fruitlands.&lt;ref name="tran_Amos"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Amos Bronson Alcott 1799 - 1888 | last=Brown|first=Amy B.  | work = American Transcendentalism Web | date =June 2002  | accessdate = 2015-10-26 | url = http://transcendentalism-legacy.tamu.edu/authors/alcott/ | language =   | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Charles Lane (transcendentalist)|Charles Lane]] - Lane met Bronson Alcott in England in 1841, at which time Lane was living at the [[Alcott House]] school in [[Surrey]]. His strict views on living a "pure" life were ultimately part of what destroyed the Fruitlands community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alcott.net/alcott/home/champions/Lane.html |title=Charles Lane, 1800 - 1870 |accessdate=2014-10-05 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219145959/http://www.alcott.net/alcott/home/champions/Lane.html |archivedate=February 19, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His son was also a resident of Fruitlands.
*[[Joseph Palmer (communard)|Joseph Palmer]] - Palmer joined Fruitlands in August 1843, and stayed through the demise of the commune, later purchasing the farm and founding another [[utopia]]n society there. He was famous for wearing a full beard, despite social stigma against it; he had even served time in prison for defending his right to wear a beard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alcott.net/alcott/home/champions/Palmer.html |title=Joseph Palmer, 1791 - 1875 |accessdate=2014-10-05 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617045441/http://www.alcott.net/alcott/home/champions/Palmer.html |archivedate=June 17, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Isaac Hecker]] - Hecker began life as a baker in [[New York City]], but then went through a progression of religious and spiritual explorations. He resided at [[Brook Farm]], another Transcendentalist community, for six months before joining the Fruitlands community. He was initially attracted by the "deeper" spiritual life at Fruitlands compared to Brook Farm,&lt;ref&gt;Delano, Sterling F. ''Brook Farm: The Dark Side of Utopia''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2004: 120. {{ISBN|0-674-01160-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he only stayed for two months. He later became a Roman Catholic priest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alcott.net/alcott/home/champions/Hecker.html |title=Isaac Thomas Hecker, 1819 - 1888 |accessdate=2014-10-05 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219225915/http://www.alcott.net/alcott/home/champions/Hecker.html |archivedate=February 19, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Samuel Larned - Like Hecker, Larned lived briefly at Brook Farm before coming to Fruitlands. He was known for using foul language because he believed that swears said with a pure heart uplifted listeners.{{sfn|Felton |2006|p=131}}
*Abraham Everett - Also known as Abraham Woods, he changed his name upon his arrival at Fruitlands, to Wood Abram. He had once been committed to an insane asylum before joining Fruitlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alcott.net/alcott/home/champions/Everett.html?index=0 |title=Abraham Everett |accessdate=2014-10-05 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830101247/http://www.alcott.net/alcott/home/champions/Everett.html?index=0 |archivedate=August 30, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Samuel Bower - Bower lived at Fruitlands for only a few months, after which he left to experiment with nudism, believing that clothes "stifled the spirit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alcott.net/alcott/home/champions/Bower.html |title=Samuel Bower |accessdate=2014-10-05 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721174410/http://www.alcott.net/alcott/home/champions/Bower.html |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ann Page - Besides Abby May Alcott, Page was the only adult female member of Fruitlands.&lt;ref name=Packer148/&gt; Page and Mrs. Alcott were responsible for most of the household chores and often had to take care of the farm as well. Page was eventually kicked out of Fruitlands, supposedly for eating a piece of fish, which was forbidden in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alcott.net/alcott/home/champions/Page.html |title=Ann Page |accessdate=2014-10-05 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219225926/http://www.alcott.net/alcott/home/champions/Page.html |archivedate=February 19, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissolution and legacy==
[[File:Fruit lands Alcott house, 2015 marker.jpg|thumb|right|Historical marker at the former site of Fruitlands]]
The biggest challenge at Fruitlands was farming. The community had arrived at the farm a month behind the planting schedule and only about {{convert|11|acre}} of land were [[arable land|arable]].&lt;ref name=Delano118/&gt; The decision not to use animal labor on the farm proved to be the undoing of the commune, combined with the fact that many of the men of the commune spent their days teaching or philosophizing instead of working in the field. Using only their own hands, the Fruitlands residents were incapable of growing a sufficient amount of food to get them through the winter.

Fruitlands was also hampered by its structure. Alcott and Lane wielded nearly limitless authority and dictated very strict and repressive models for living. "I am prone to indulge in an occasional hilarity", wrote Alcott's wife [[Abby May]], "but seem frowned down into still quiet and peace-less order... [and] am almost suffocated in this atmosphere of restriction and form".{{sfn|Rose|1981|p=127}}
The Fruitlands experiment ended only seven months after it began. According to Bronson Alcott, the inhabitants left Fruitlands in January 1844; his daughter, Louisa May, wrote that they left in December 1843, which is considered to be the more accurate date.&lt;ref&gt;Alcott, Amos Bronson. [http://www.alcott.net/alcott/home/fruitlands.html "Fruitlands"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724033249/http://www.alcott.net/alcott/home/fruitlands.html |date=2008-07-24 }}, 5 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Alcott was deeply dismayed by the failure of Fruitlands and, moving with his family to live with a nearby farmer, refused to eat for several days. Later, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] helped purchase a home for the family in Concord.&lt;ref&gt;Packer, Barbara L. ''The Transcendentalists''. Athens, Georgia: The University of Georgia Press, 2007: 149–50. {{ISBN|978-0-8203-2958-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fruitlands had only a brief opportunity to impact America and the Transcendentalist movement. After it had ended, the land was bought by one of its former participants, Joseph Palmer, who for 20 years used the site as a refuge for former reformers.{{sfn|Rose|1981|p=123}} The property was purchased in 1910 by [[Clara Endicott Sears]], who opened the farmhouse to the public in 1914 as a museum.{{sfn|Felton |2006|p=133}} Today, the [[Fruitlands Museum]] also includes a museum on Shaker life, an art gallery of nineteenth-century paintings, and a museum of Native American art and crafts.{{sfn|Felton |2006|p=133}}

== Preimplantation genetic diagnosis ==
{{further|Preimplantation genetic diagnosis}}
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD or PIGD) refers to [[Genetics|genetic]] evaluation of [[embryo]]s and [[oocyte]]s prior to [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]]. When used to screen for a specific genetic condition, the method also makes it possible to select embryos with intersex conditions for termination. Some national authorities, such as the UK Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority, maintain lists of conditions for which PGD is permissible, including intersex conditions such as [[5 alpha reductase deficiency]], [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]], [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] and others.&lt;ref name="hfea" /&gt;

[[intersex medical interventions|Surgical interventions]] on children with intersex conditions are contentious and may lead to selection for other traits like same sex attraction.&lt;ref name="sparrow2013"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/15265161.2013.828115| issn = 1526-5161 | volume = 13| issue = 10| pages = 29–38| last = Sparrow| first = Robert| title = Gender Eugenics?

He concluded that the acceptability of elimination of intersex conditions has "uncomfortable" implications for "other nonpathological human variations" that do not affect physical health.&lt;ref name="sparrow2013" /&gt;

[[Organisation Intersex International Australia]] has quoted research showing [[Abortion|pregnancy termination]] rates of up to 88% in [[Klinefelter syndrome|47,XXY]] even while the [[World Health Organization]] describes the trait as "compatible with normal life expectancy", and "often undiagnosed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Radicioni|first1=A F|last2=Ferlin|first2=A|last3=Balercia|first3=G|last4=Pasquali|first4=D|last5=Vignozzi|first5=L|last6=Maggi|first6=M|last7=Foresta|first7=C|last8=Lenzi|first8=A|date=2010|title=Consensus statement on diagnosis and clinical management of Klinefelter syndrome|journal=[[Journal of Endocrinological Investigation]]|volume=33|pages=839–850}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/genomics/gender/en/index1.html|title=Gender and Genetics|work=[[World Health Organization]] Genomic resource centre|access-date=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, it called for the Australian [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] to prohibit such interventions, noting a "close entanglement of intersex status, gender identity and sexual orientation in social understandings of sex and gender norms, and in medical and medical sociology literature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|url=http://oii.org.au/25621/submission-ethics-genetic-selection-intersex-traits/|title=Submission on the Review of Part B of the Ethical Guidelines for the Use of Assisted Reproductive Technology in Clinical Practice and Research, 2007|last1=Carpenter|first1=Morgan|author2=Organisation Intersex International Australia|date=April 30, 2014|location=Sydney|author2-link=Organisation Intersex International Australia|work=Organisation Intersex International Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the organization wrote about the sponsorship of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex ([[LGBTI]]) events by IVF clinics in Australia, stating that, in addition to ethical issues raised by the elimination of intersex traits, "sponsorship of "LGBTI" events by such businesses raises more ethical issues still, including the nature of community and comprehension of issues relating to intersex bodily diversity".&lt;ref name="oii2016"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oii.org.au/30555/sponsorship-elimination-intersex-traits/|title=LGBTI sponsorship and the elimination of intersex traits|last=Organisation Intersex International Australia|author-link=Organisation Intersex International Australia|date=July 10, 2016|accessdate=2017-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Sparrow, [[Georgiann Davis]] argues that such discrimination fails to recognize that many people with intersex traits led full and happy lives, and that the "intersex community is only "invisible" to those who choose to ignore it", while "the medical profession, not the intersex trait itself, is a major source of the social and psychological harm that perpetuates intersex stigmatization and the "hostile social environment" that individuals with intersex traits encounter".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/15265161.2013.828119| issn = 1526-5161| volume = 13| issue = 10| pages = 51–53| last = Davis| first = Georgiann| author-link=Georgiann Davis|title = The Social Costs of Preempting Intersex Traits| journal = The American Journal of Bioethics| date = October 2013| url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15265161.2013.828119| pmid=24024811}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Nisker links the elimination of intersex conditions to their pathologization, describing how "[o]nce a difference becomes a medical disorder to which the medical profession is dedicating time and resources to prevent, procedures to this end become endowed with appropriateness".&lt;ref name="nisker"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nisker Jeff | year = 2013 | title = Informed Choice and PGD to Prevent "Intersex Conditions" | doi = 10.1080/15265161.2013.828125 | pmid = 24024809 | journal = The American Journal of Bioethics | volume = 13 | issue = 10| pages = 47–49 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Intersex people's right to life can be violated in discriminatory "sex selection" and "preimplantation genetic diagnosis, other forms of testing, and selection for particular characteristics".

[[Alice Dreger]], Ellen Feder, and [[Anne Tamar-Mattis]] describe how research published by Saroj Nimkarn and [[Maria New]] in 2010 constructs "low interest in babies and men – and even interest in what they consider to be men's occupations and games – as "abnormal", and potentially preventable with prenatal dexamethasone".&lt;ref name="nimkarn2010" /&gt; The authors state that "weak and unsupported conclusions" of investigations into the attempted "prevention of benign behavioral sex variations" indicates gaps in the ethical management of clinical research.&lt;ref name="dreger2012"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/s11673-012-9384-9| issn = 1176-7529| volume = 9| issue = 3| pages = 277–294| last1 = Dreger| first1 = Alice| last2 = Feder| first2 = Ellen K.| last3 = Tamar-Mattis| first3 = Anne| author1-link = Alice Dreger | author3-link = Anne Tamar-Mattis | title = Prenatal Dexamethasone for Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia: An Ethics Canary in the Modern Medical Mine| journal = Journal of Bioethical Inquiry| date = September 2012 | url = https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11673-012-9384-9| pmc = 3416978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Hirvikoski and others described a lack of long-term follow-up studies of individuals exposed to prenatal treatment, and the results of a 10-year Swedish study of 43 mothers and children. The authors found evidence of unacceptable side-effects in their study, including neurological consequences. Treatment with dexamethasone was discontinued in Sweden.&lt;ref name="hirvik2012" /&gt;

'''Jorge Agustín Nicolás Ruiz de Santayana y Borrás''', known in English as '''George Santayana''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|æ|n|t|i|ˈ|æ|n|ə|,_|-|ˈ|ɑː|n|ə}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/santayana|title=the definition of Santayana|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; December 16, 1863 – September 26, 1952), was a philosopher, essayist, poet, and novelist. Originally from [[Spain]], Santayana was raised and educated in the United States from the age of eight and identified himself as an [[Americans|American]], although he always kept a valid [[Spanish passport]].&lt;ref&gt;George Santayana, "Apologia Pro Mente Sua," in P. A. Schilpp, ''The Philosophy of George Santayana'', (1940), 603.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote in English and is generally considered an American [[man of letters]]. At the age of forty-eight, Santayana left his position at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and returned to Europe permanently, never to return to the United States.

Santayana is popularly known for [[aphorisms]], such as "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it",&lt;ref&gt;George Santayana (1905) ''Reason in Common Sense'', p. 284, volume&amp;nbsp;1 of ''[[The Life of Reason]]''&lt;/ref&gt; "Only the dead have seen the end of war",&lt;ref&gt;George Santayana (1922) ''Soliloquies in England and Later Soliloquies'', number 25&lt;/ref&gt; and the definition of beauty as "pleasure objectified".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/intro/artbook.html/c8023.htm|title=Beauty as Intrinsic Pleasure by George Santayana|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although an atheist, he treasured the Spanish Catholic values, practices, and worldview in which he was raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lovely |first1=Edward W. |title=George Santayana's Philosophy of Religion: His Roman Catholic Influences and Phenomenology |date=Sep 28, 2012 |publisher=Lexington Books |pages=1, 204–206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santayana was a broad-ranging cultural critic spanning many disciplines.

==Early life==
Jorge Agustín Nicolás Ruiz de Santayana y Borrás was born on December 16, 1863, in [[Madrid]], and he spent his early childhood in [[Ávila, Spain|Ávila]], Spain. His mother, Josefina Borrás, was the daughter of a Spanish official in the [[Philippines]], and Jorge was the only child of her second marriage.

Josefina Borrás first husband was George Sturgis, a [[Boston]] merchant, with whom she had five children, two of whom died in infancy. She lived in Boston for a few years following her husband's death in 1857, but in 1861 moved with her three surviving children to live in Madrid. There she encountered Agustín Ruiz de Santayana, an old friend from her years in the Philippines. They married in 1862. A [[Colonialism|colonial]] [[civil servant]], Ruiz de Santayana was also a painter and minor [[intellectual]].  The family lived in Madrid and Ávila.

In 1869 Josefina Borrás de Santayana returned to Boston with her three Sturgis children, because she had promised her first husband to raise the children in the United States. She left the six-year-old Jorge with his father in Spain. Jorge and his father followed her to Boston in 1872.  However, his father, finding neither Boston nor his wife's attitude to his liking, soon returned alone to Ávila, and remained there the rest of his life. Jorge did not see him again until he entered [[Harvard College]] and began to take his summer vacations in Spain. Sometime during this period, [[Jorge]]'s first name was anglicized as [[George (given name)|George]], the English equivalent.

==Education==
[[File:Hollis Hall, Harvard University.JPG|alt=Hollis Hall: a four-story red brick building with white trim in a courtyard.|thumb|Santayana lived in [[Hollis Hall]] as a student at [[Harvard]].]]
Santayana attended [[Boston Latin School]] and [[Harvard College]], where he studied under the philosophers [[William James]] and [[Josiah Royce]] and was involved in eleven clubs as an alternative to athletics. He was founder and president of the Philosophical Club, a member of the literary society known as the O.K., an editor and cartoonist for ''[[The Harvard Lampoon]]'', and co-founder of the literary journal ''[[The Harvard Monthly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Parri, Alice ''Two Harvard Friends: Charles Loeser and George Santayana''[http://berenson.itatti.harvard.edu/berenson/items/show/3028]&lt;/ref&gt; In December, 1885, he played the role of Lady Elfrida in the Hasty Pudding theatrical ''Robin Hood'', followed by the production ''Papillonetta'' in the spring of his senior year.&lt;ref&gt;Garrison, Lloyd McKim, ''An Illustrated History of the Hasty Pudding Club Theatricals'', Cambridge, Hasty Pudding Club, 1897.&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating [[Phi Beta Kappa]] from Harvard&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbk.org/infoview/PBK_InfoView.aspx?t=&amp;id=59 Who Belongs To Phi Beta Kappa] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/64rvFrU3p?url=http://www.pbk.org/infoview/PBK_InfoView.aspx?t=&amp;id=59 |date=2012-01-21 }}, ’Phi Beta Kappa website’’, accessed Oct 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; in 1886, Santayana studied for two years in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=SANTAYANA, George|magazine=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 59|page=1555|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1555}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then returned to Harvard to write his dissertation on [[Hermann Lotze]] and teach philosophy, becoming part of the Golden Age of the Harvard philosophy department. Some of his Harvard students became famous in their own right, including [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Robert Frost]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Horace Kallen]], [[Walter Lippmann]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. [[Wallace Stevens]] was not among his students but became a friend.&lt;ref&gt;Lensing, George S. (1986). Wallace Stevens: A Poet's Growth. LSU Press. 313 pp. {{ISBN|0807112976}}. p.12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1896 to 1897, Santayana studied at [[King's College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=SNTN896G|name=Santayana, George}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Santayana never married. His romantic life, if any, is not well understood. Some evidence, including a comment Santayana made late in life comparing himself to [[A. E. Housman]], and his friendships with people who were openly [[homosexual]] and [[bisexual]], has led scholars to speculate that Santayana was perhaps homosexual or bisexual himself, but it remains unclear whether he had any actual heterosexual or homosexual relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/santayana/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first1=Herman|last1=Saatkamp|first2=Martin|last2=Coleman|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=1 January 2014|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, Santayana resigned his position at Harvard to spend the rest of his life in Europe. He had saved money and been aided by a legacy from his mother. After some years in Ávila, [[Paris]] and [[Oxford]], after 1920, he began to winter in [[Rome]], eventually living there year-round until his death. During his forty years in Europe, he wrote nineteen books and declined several prestigious academic positions. Many of his visitors and correspondents were Americans, including his assistant and eventual literary executor, [[Daniel Cory]]. In later life, Santayana was financially comfortable, in part because his 1935 novel, ''[[The Last Puritan]]'', had become an unexpected best-seller. In turn, he financially assisted a number of writers, including [[Bertrand Russell]], with whom he was in fundamental disagreement, philosophically and politically.

[[File:Santayana 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Santayana early in his career]]
Santayana's one novel, ''[[The Last Puritan]]'', is a ''[[bildungsroman]]'', centering on the personal growth of its protagonist, Oliver Alden. His ''Persons and Places'' is an [[autobiography]]. These works also contain many of his sharper opinions and [[List of French expressions in English#Bon mot|''bons mots'']]. He wrote books and essays on a wide range of subjects, including philosophy of a less technical sort, literary criticism, the history of ideas, politics, human nature, morals, the influence of religion on culture and social psychology, all with considerable wit and humor.

While his writings on technical philosophy can be difficult, his other writings are far more accessible and pithy. He wrote poems and a few plays, and left an ample correspondence, much of it published only since 2000. Like [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], Santayana observed American culture and character from a foreigner's point of view. Like [[William James]], his friend and mentor, he wrote philosophy in a literary way. [[Ezra Pound]] includes Santayana among [[List of cultural references in The Cantos|his many cultural references in]] ''[[The Cantos]]'', notably in "Canto LXXXI" and "Canto XCV". Santayana is usually considered an American writer, although he declined to become an American citizen, resided in fascist Italy for decades, and said that he was most comfortable, intellectually and aesthetically, at [[Oxford University]]. Following 1935 and the writing of his only novel ''The Last Puritan'', he continued to winter in [[Rome]], eventually living there year-round until his death in 1952.

==Philosophical work and publications==
[[File:Egotism in German Philosophy (1916).djvu|alt=The first page of Egotism in German Philosophy|thumb|upright|Although schooled in [[German idealism]], Santayana was critical of it and made an effort to distance himself from its [[epistemology]].]]

Santayana's main philosophical work consists of ''[[The Sense of Beauty]]'' (1896), his first book-length monograph and perhaps the first major work on [[aesthetics]] written in the United States; ''[[The Life of Reason]]'' five volumes, 1905–6, the high point of his Harvard career; ''[[Skepticism and Animal Faith]]'' (1923); and ''[[The Realms of Being]]'' (4 vols., 1927–40). Although Santayana was not a [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] in the mold of [[William James]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Josiah Royce]], or [[John Dewey]], ''The Life of Reason'' arguably is the first extended treatment of [[pragmatism]] written.

Like many of the classical pragmatists, and because he was well-versed in [[evolutionary theory]], Santayana was committed to [[metaphysical naturalism]]. He believed that human [[cognition]], cultural practices, and social institutions have evolved so as to harmonize with the conditions present in their environment. Their value may then be adjudged by the extent to which they facilitate human happiness. The alternate title to ''The Life of Reason'', "the Phases of Human Progress," is indicative of this [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] stance.

Santayana was an early adherent of [[epiphenomenalism]], but also admired the classical [[materialism]] of [[Democritus]] and [[Lucretius]] (of the three authors on whom he wrote in ''Three Philosophical Poets'', Santayana speaks most favorably of Lucretius). He held [[Spinoza]]'s writings in high regard, calling him his "master and model."&lt;ref&gt;The Letters of George Santayana: Book Eight, 1948–1952 By George Santayana p 8:39&lt;/ref&gt;

Although an [[atheist]],&lt;ref&gt;"My atheism, like that of Spinoza, is true piety towards the universe, and denies only gods fashioned by men in their own image, to be servants of their human interests." George Santayana, "On My Friendly Critics," in ''Soliloquies in England and Later Soliloquies'', 1922 (from Rawson's Dictionary of American Quotations via credoreference.com). Accessed August 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Santayana playfully called himself 'a Catholic atheist,' but in spite of the fact that he deliberately immersed himself in the stream of Catholic religious life, he never took the sacraments. He neither literally regarded himself as a Catholic nor did Catholics regard him as a Catholic." Empiricism, Theoretical Constructs, and God, by Kai Nielsen, The Journal of Religion, Vol. 54, No. 3 (Jul., 1974), pp. 199-217 (p. 205), published by The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; he held a fairly benign view of religion. Santayana's views on religion are outlined in his books ''Reason in Religion'', ''The Idea of Christ in the Gospels'', and ''Interpretations of Poetry and Religion''. Santayana described himself as an "[[aesthetics|aesthetic]] [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]]." He spent the last decade of his life at the Convent of the Blue Nuns of the Little Company of Mary on the [[Celian Hill]] at 6 Via Santo Stefano Rotondo in Rome, where he was cared for by the Irish sisters.

Santayana also held views of racial superiority and eugenic ideations discouraging the races he believed to be superior from "intermarriage with inferior stock".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/?id=c_QDCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT96&amp;lpg=PT96&amp;dq=%22some+races+are+obviously%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22some%20races%20are%20obviously%22&amp;f=false | title=The Life of Reason: Human Understanding| last1=Santayana| first1=George| date=2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Santayana is remembered in large part for his [[aphorism]]s, many of which have been so frequently used as to have become [[cliché]]d. His philosophy has not fared quite as well. He is regarded by most as an excellent prose stylist, and Professor [[John Lachs]] (who is sympathetic with much of Santayana's philosophy) writes, in ''On Santayana'', that his eloquence may ironically be the very cause of this neglect.

Santayana influenced those around him, including [[Bertrand Russell]], whom Santayana single-handedly steered away from the ethics of [[G. E. Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael K. Potter. ''Bertrand Russell’s Ethics''. London and New York: Continuum, 2006. Pp. xiii, 185. {{ISBN|0826488102}}, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; He also influenced many prominent people such as Harvard students [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Robert Frost]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Horace Kallen]], [[Walter Lippmann]], [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], [[Conrad Aiken]], [[Van Wyck Brooks]], and Supreme Court Justice [[Felix Frankfurter]], as well as [[Max Eastman]] and the poet [[Wallace Stevens]]. Stevens was especially influenced by Santayana's aesthetics and became a friend even though Stevens did not take courses taught by Santayana.&lt;ref&gt;Lensing, George S. (1986).

Santayana is quoted by the Canadian-American sociologist [[Erving Goffman]] as a central influence in the thesis of his famous book ''[[The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life]]'' (1959). Religious historian [[Jerome A. Stone]] credits Santayana with contributing to the early thinking in the development of [[religious naturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Religious Naturalism Today'', pp. 44–52&lt;/ref&gt; English mathematician and philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead]] quotes Santayana extensively in his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] ''[[Process and Reality]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, A.N. (1929). ''Process and Reality. An Essay in Cosmology. Gifford Lectures Delivered in the University of Edinburgh During the Session 1927–1928'', Macmillan, New York, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chuck Jones]] used Santayana's description of [[fanaticism]] as "redoubling your effort after you've forgotten your aim" to describe his cartoons starring [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner]].&lt;ref&gt;See the sixth paragraph, [http://www.opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110004344 That's Not All, Folks! "Of course you know this means war."

Santayana is referenced in the lyrics to singer [[Billy Joel]]'s 1989 music single, "[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.billyjoel.com/song/we-didnt-start-fire-11/ We Didn't Start the Fire]. BillyJoel.com. Retrieved 2016-09-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The belief that '''God became the Universe''' is a theological doctrine that has been developed several times historically, and holds that the [[Creator deity|creator]] of the [[universe]] actually became the universe. Historically, for versions of this theory where God has ceased to exist or to act as a separate and conscious entity, some have used the term [[pandeism]], which combines aspects of [[pantheism]] and [[deism]], to refer to such a theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Development==

===In mythology===
Many ancient [[mythologies]] suggested that the world was created from the physical [[Substance theory|substance]] of a dead [[deity]] or a being of similar [[Power (philosophy)|power]]. In [[Babylonian mythology]], the young god [[Marduk]] slew [[Tiamat]] and created the known world from her body. Similarly, [[Norse mythology]] posited that [[Odin]] and his brothers, [[Vili and Vé]] defeated a frost giant, [[Ymir]] and then created the world from his skull.  [[Chinese mythology]] of the [[Three Kingdoms]] era recounts the creation of elements of the physical world (mountains, rivers, the sun and moon, etc.) from the body of a creator called [[Pangu|Pángǔ]] ([[盤古]]). Such stories did not go so far as to identify the [[designer]] of the world as being one as having used his or her own body to provide the material.

But, one such example exists in [[Polynesian mythology|Polynesian]] myth, for in the islands of the [[Pacific]], the idea of Supreme Deity manifests in a divinity that [[New Zealand]]ers call [[Tangaroa]], the [[Hawaiia]]ns [[Kanaroa]], the [[Tonga]]ns and [[Samoa]]ns [[Tangaloa]], the Georgian and Society islanders [[Ta'aroa|Taaroa]]. A native poetic definition of the Creator relates: " He was; Taaroa was his name; he abode in the void. No earth, no sky, no men. Taaroa calls, but nought answers; and alone existing, he became the universe. The props are Taaroa; the rocks are Taaroa; the sands are Taaroa; it is thus he himself is named."&lt;ref&gt;Edward Burnett Tylor, ''Primitive culture: researches into the development of mythology, philosophy, religion, art, and custom'', 1871, 312-313&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient philosophy===
[[Religious studies]] professor, [[Francis Edward Peters]] traced this idea to the philosophy of the [[Milesians (Greek)|Milesians]], who had also pioneered knowledge of pantheism, in his 1967 ''Greek Philosophical Terms: A Historical Lexicon'', noting that "[w]hat appeared... at the center of the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] tradition in philosophy, is another view of ''[[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]'' that seems to owe little or nothing to the pan-vitalism or ''pan-deism'' that is the legacy of the Milesians.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis E. Peters]], ''Greek Philosophical Terms: A Historical Lexicon'', p. 169 (NYU Press 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

Milesian philosopher [[Anaximander]] in particular favored the use of [[rationalism|rational]] principles to contend that everything in the world was formed of variations of a single substance (''[[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]''), which had been temporarily liberated from the primal state of the world. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], in his ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]'', stated that Anaximander viewed "...all coming-to-be as though it were an illegitimate emancipation from eternal being, a wrong for which destruction is the only penance."&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche, ''Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks'' (1873) § 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Anaximander was among the [[Material monism|material monists]], along with [[Thales]], who believed that everything was composed of [[water]], [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], who believed it was [[air]], and [[Heraclitus]], who believed it to be [[fire]].

[[Gottfried Große]] in his 1787 interpretation of [[Pliny the Elder]]’s [[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]], describes Pliny, a first-century figure, as a pandeist as well.&lt;ref name="Große"&gt;{{cite book|last=Große|first=Gottfried|title=Naturgeschichte: mit erläuternden Anmerkungen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ro9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=pandeisten&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=pandeisten&amp;f=false|year=1787|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 9th century, [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]] proposed in his great work, ''[[De divisione naturae]]'' (also called ''Periphyseon'', probably completed around 867 AD), that the nature of the universe is divisible into four distinct classes:
[[File:Johannes-Scotus-Erigena.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Johannes Scotus Eriugena was among the first to propose that God became the universe, and did so to learn something about itself.]]

# that which creates and is not created;
# that which is created and creates;
# that which is created and does not create;
# that which neither is created nor creates.

The first is God as the ground or origin of all things, the last is God as the final end or goal of all things, that into which the world of created things ultimately returns. One particularly controversial point made by Eriugena was that God was "nothing", in that God could not fall into any earthly classification. Eriugena followed the argument of [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Pseudo-Dionysius]] and from [[neo-Platonism|neo-Platonists]] such as [[Gaius Marius Victorinus]] that because God was above being, God was not a being: "So supremely perfect is the essence of the Divinity that God is incomprehensible not only to us but also to Himself. For if He knew Himself in any adequate sense He should place Himself in some category of thought, which would be to limit Himself."&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05519a.htm William Turner, ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]: John Scotus Eriugena''].&lt;/ref&gt; A more contemporary statement of this idea is that: "Since God is not a being, he is therefore not intelligible... This means not only that we cannot understand him, but also that he cannot understand himself. Creation is a kind of divine effort by God to understand himself, to see himself in a mirror."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeremiah Genest]], ''[http://www.granta.demon.co.uk/arsm/jg/eriugena.html John Scottus Eriugena: Life and Works]'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Eriugena depicts God as an evolving being, developing through the four stages that he outlines. The second and third classes together compose the created universe, which is the manifestation of God, God in process, ''Theophania''; the second being the world of [[Plato]]nic ideas or [[Theory of forms|forms]]. The third is the physical manifestation of God, having evolved through the realm of [[idea]]s and made those ideas seem to be [[matter]], and may be pantheistic or pandeistic, depending on the interference attributed to God in the universe:

{{quote|[God] enters... the realm of space and time, where the ideas become subject to multiplicity, change, imperfection, and decay. In this last stage they are no longer pure ideas but only the appearances of reality, that is phenomena. ... In the realm of space and time the ideas take on the burden of matter, which is the source of suffering, sickness, and sin. The material world, therefore, of our experience is composed of ideas clothed in matter&amp;nbsp;— here Eriugena attempts a reconciliation of Platonism with Aristotelean notions. Man, too, is composed of idea and matter, soul and body. He is the culmination of the process of things from God, and with him, as we shall see, begins the process of return of all things to God.&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"/&gt;}}

The divine system is thus distinguished by beginning, middle and end; but these are in essence one; the difference is only the consequence of man's temporal limitations. This eternal process is viewed with finite comprehension through the form of time, forcing the application of temporal distinctions to that which is extra- or supra-temporal. Eriugena concludes this work with another controversial argument, and one that had already been scathingly rejected by [[Augustine of Hippo]], that "[n]ot only man, however, but everything else in nature is destined to return to God."&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"/&gt; Eriugena's work was condemned by a [[council at Sens]] by [[Honorius III]] (1225), who described it as "swarming with worms of [[heresy|heretical]] perversity," and by [[Pope]] [[Gregory XIII]] in 1585. Such theories were thus suppressed for hundreds of years thence.

===16th century on===
[[File:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The ideas of [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] lay the foundations for pandeism.]]
[[Giordano Bruno]] conceived of a God who was immanent in nature, and for this very purpose was uninterested in human affairs (all such events being equally part of God). However, it was Baruch Spinoza in the 17th century who appears to have been the earliest to use deistic reason to arrive at the conception of a pantheistic God. Spinoza's God was deistic in the sense that it could only be proved by appeal to reason, but it was also one with the universe.

Unlike Eriugena, Spinoza's pantheistic focus on the universe as it already existed did not address the possible creation of the universe from the substance of God, for Spinoza rejected the very possibility of changes in the form of matter required as a premise for such a belief.
[[File:Junghuhn.jpg|thumb|right|[[Franz Wilhelm Junghuhn]] was the first to articulate a pantheistic deism.]]
18th-century British philosopher [[Thomas Paine]] also approached this territory in his great philosophical [[treatise]], ''[[The Age of Reason]]'', although Paine was concentrated on the deistic aspects of his inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomaspaine.org/Archives/AOR1.html Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason].&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Encyclopedia of American Philosophy "Later [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] Christians (such as [[William Ellery Channing]]), transcendentalists (such as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]]), writers (such as [[Walt Whitman]]) and some pragmatists (such as [[William James]]) took a more pantheist or pandeist approach by rejecting views of God as separate from the world."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lachs]] and [[Robert Talisse]], ''American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia'', 2007, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; It was [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Natural history|naturalist]] Franz Wilhelm Junghuhn who first specifically detailed a religious philosophy incorporating deism and pantheism, in his four volume treatise, ''Java, seine Gestalt, Pflanzendecke, und sein innerer Bau'' (''[[Image]]s of [[Light]] and [[Shadow]] from Java's interior'') released anonymously between 1850 and 1854. Junghuhn's book was [[banned books|banned]] for a time in [[Austria]] and parts of [[Germany]] as an attack on Christianity. In 1884, theologian [[Sabine Baring-Gould]] would contend that [[Christianity]] itself demanded that the seemingly irreconcilable elements of pantheism and deism must be combined:

{{quote|This world is either the idea or it is the workmanship of God. If we say that it is the idea,--then we are Pantheists, if we say that it is the work, then we are Deists... But how, it may be asked, can two such opposite theories as Pantheism and Deism be reconciled,--they mutually exclude one another? I may not be able to explain how they are conciliable, but I boldly affirm that each is simultaneously true, and that each must be true, for each is an inexorably logical conclusion, and each is a positive conclusion, and all positive conclusions must be true if Christ be the Ideal and the focus of all truths.&lt;ref&gt;Sabine Baring-Gould, ''The Origin and Development of Religious Belief Part II'' (1884) Page 157.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Within a decade after that, [[Andrew Martin Fairbairn]] similarly wrote that "both Deism and Pantheism err because they are partial; they are right in what they affirm, wrong in what they deny. It is as antitheses that they are false; but by synthesis they may be combined or dissolved into truth".&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Martin Fairbairn, ''The Place of Christ in Modern Theology'' (1893) p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, Fairbairn's criticism concluded that it was the presence of an active God that was missing from both concepts, rather than the rational explanation of God's motives and appearance of absence.

In 1838, Italian [[phrenologist]] [[Luigi Ferrarese]] in ''Memorie Riguardanti la Dottrina Frenologica'' ("Thoughts Regarding the Doctrine of Phrenology") attacked the philosophy of [[Victor Cousin]] as a doctrine which "locates reason outside the human person, declaring man a fragment of God, introducing a sort of spiritual Pandeism, absurd for us, and injurious to the Supreme Being."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferrarese|first=Luigi|title=Memorie risguardanti la dottrina frenologica|year=1838|page=15|quote=Dottrina, che pel suo idealismo poco circospetto, non solo la fede, ma la stessa ragione offende (il sistema di Kant): farebbe mestieri far aperto gli errori pericolosi, così alla Religione, come alla Morale, di quel psicologo franzese, il quale ha sedotte le menti (Cousin), con far osservare come la di lui filosofia intraprendente ed audace sforza le barriere della sacra Teologia, ponendo innanzi ad ogn'altra autorità la propria: profana i misteri, dichiarandoli in parte vacui di senso, ed in parte riducendoli a volgari allusioni, ed a prette metafore; costringe, come faceva osservare un dotto Critico, la rivelazione a cambiare il suo posto con quello del pensiero istintivo e dell' affermazione senza riflessione e colloca la ragione fuori della persona dell'uomo dichiarandolo un frammento di Dio, una spezie di '''pandeismo''' spirituale introducendo, assurdo per noi, ed al Supremo Ente ingiurioso, il quale reca onda grave alla libertà del medesimo, ec, ec.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cousin had often been identified as a pantheist, but it was said that he repudiated that label on the basis that unlike Spinoza, Cousin asserted that "he does not hold with Spinoza and the Eleatics that God is a pure substance, and not a cause."
&lt;ref&gt;James Strong, ''Cyclopaedia of Biblical, theological, and ecclesiastical literature'', Volume 7, 1894, page 622.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developments from the 20th century to today===
{{See also| Tat Tvam Asi}}

In the 1940s, [[process theology|process theologian]] [[Charles Hartshorne]] identified pandeism as one of his many models of the possible nature of God, acknowledging that a God capable of change (as Hartshorne insisted God must be) is consistent with pandeism. Hartshorne preferred pandeism to pantheism, explaining that "it is not really the [[God (word)|theos]] that is described".&lt;ref&gt;Charles Hartshorne, ''Man's Vision of God and the Logic of Theism'' (1941, republished in 1964) p. 347 {{ISBN|0-208-00498-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he specifically rejected pandeism early on in favor of a God whose characteristics included "absolute perfection in some respects, relative perfection in all others" or "AR", writing that this theory "is able consistently to embrace all that is positive in either deism or pandeism."&lt;ref name="Man p. 348"&gt;''Man's Vision of God and the Logic of Theism'', p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt; Hartshorne accepted the label of panentheism for his beliefs, declaring that "panentheistic doctrine contains all of deism and pandeism except their arbitrary negations".&lt;ref name="Man p. 348"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald Luther Jackson, ''Religious Lies&amp;nbsp;– Religious Truths: It's Time to Tell the Truth!'', page 175 (2012): "Charles Hartshorne introduced his process theology in the 1940s, in which he examined, and discarded pantheism, deism, and pandeism in favor of panentheism, finding that such a doctrine contains all of deism and pandeism except their arbitrary negative aspects."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Scott Adams published ''[[God's Debris|God's Debris: A Thought Experiment]]'', in which a fictional character puts forth a  radical form of [[kenosis]], surmising that an [[omnipotence|omnipotent]] God annihilated himself in the [[Big Bang]], because God would already know everything possible except his own lack of existence, and would have to end that existence in order to complete his knowledge. Adams' protagonist asks about God, "would his omnipotence include knowing what happens after he loses his omnipotence, or would his knowledge of the future end at that point?"&lt;ref&gt;Scott Adams, ''God's Debris'' (2001) p.43 {{ISBN|0-7407-2190-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He proceeds from this question to the following analysis:

{{quote|A God who knew the answer to that question would indeed know everything and have everything. For that reason he would be unmotivated to do anything or create anything. There would be no purpose to act in any way whatsoever. But a God who had one nagging question—what happens if I cease to exist?—might be motivated to find the answer in order to complete his knowledge. ... The fact that we exist is proof that God is motivated to act in some way. And since only the challenge of self-destruction could interest an omnipotent God, it stands to reason that we... are God's debris.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, ''God's Debris'', p. 43-44.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Adams' God exists now as a combination of the smallest units of [[energy]] of which the universe is made (many levels smaller than [[quarks]]), which Adams called "God Dust", and the law of [[probability]], or "God's debris", hence the title. The protagonist further proposes that God is in the process of being restored not through some process such as the [[Big Crunch]], but because humankind itself is becoming God.

The 1976 [[Simon Raven]] novel, ''[[The Survivors (Simon Raven novel)|The Survivors]]'' includes an exchange between characters where one observes, "God became the universe. Therefore the universe is God." while the other counters:

{{quote|In becoming the universe God abdicated. He destroyed himself as God. He turned what he had been, his true self, into nullity and thereby forfeited the Godlike qualities which pertained to him.  The universe which he has become is also his grave. He has no control in it or over it. God, as God, is dead.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Raven, ''[[The Survivors (Simon Raven novel)|The Survivors]]'', 1976, page 90.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Criticisms===
Some theologians have criticised the notion of a Creator wholly becoming the universe. An example is [[William Walker Atkinson]], in his ''Mastery of Being'':&lt;ref name=wwa&gt;William Walker Atkinson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2QpsrDUijTUC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=%22Another+error+of+pantheism%22&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Another%20error%20of%20pantheism%22&amp;f=false Mastery of Being], 1911, pages 56 to 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It will be seen that this fact of the Immutability of REALITY, when clearly conceived, must serve to confute and refute the erroneous theories of certain schools of Pantheism which hold that "God becomes the Universe by changing into the Universe." Thus it is sought to identify Nature with God, whereby, as Schopenhauer said, "you show God to the door." If God changes Himself into The Phenomenal Universe, then God is non-existent and we need not concern ourselves any more about Him, for he has committed suicide by Change. In such case there is no God, no Infinite, no Immutable, no Eternal; everything has become finite, temporal, separate, a mere union of diverse finite parts. In that case are we indeed adrift in the Ocean of Diversity. We have lost our Foundation of REALITY, and are but ever-changing "parts" of physical things governed by physical laws. Then, indeed, would be true the  idea of some of the old philosophies that "there is No Being; merely a Becoming." Then would there, in truth, be nothing constant, the universe never the same for two consecutive moments, with no permanent ground of REALITY to support it. But the reason of man, the very essence of his mental being, refuses to so think of That-which-IS. In his heart of hearts he recognizes the existence of THAT-WHICH-CHANGES-NOT, THAT-WHICH-IS-ETERNAL, THAT-WHICH-IS-REALITY.&lt;br&gt;....&lt;br&gt;Moreover, the idea of the immutability of REALITY must, serve to confute the erroneous idea of certain schools of metaphysics which assert the existence of "an Evolving God"; that is, a God which ''increases in intelligence, nature, and being'' by reason of the change of the universe, which is an expression of Himself. This conception is that of a Supreme Being who is growing, developing, and increasing in efficiency, wisdom, power, and character. This is an attempt to combine the anthropomorphic deity and the pantheistic Nature-God. The conception is clearly anthropomorphic, as it seeks to attribute to God the qualities and characteristics of man. It defies every fact of Ultimate Principle of REALITY. It is extremely unphilosophical and will not stand the test of logical examination.&lt;ref name=wwa/&gt;}}

He claims that if God were evolving or improving, being an infinite being, it would have to be traceable back to some point of having "an infinitely undeveloped state and condition."&lt;ref name=wwa/&gt; But, this claim was made prior to the rise of scientific knowledge pinpointing the beginning of the universe in time, and connecting time with space, so that time would not exist as we know it prior to the universe existing. In Islam, a criticism is raised, wherein it is argued that "from the juristic standpoint, obliterating the distinctions between God and the universe necessarily entails that in effect there can be no [[Sharia]], since the deontic nature of the Law presupposes the existence of someone who commands (amir) and others who are the recipients of the command (ma'mur), namely God and his subjects."&lt;ref&gt;Aḥmad ibn ʻAbd al-Ḥalīm Ibn Taymīyah, Wael B. Hallaq, ''Ibn Taymiyya against the Greek logicians'', 1993, xxvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, [[Pastor]] Bob Burridge&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.girs.com/institute/executivedirector.html Genevan Institute for Reformed Studies].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burridge.net/bob/ Homepage of Bob Burridge].&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Genevan Institute for Reformed Studies]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.girs.com/ Genevan Institute for Reformed Studies].&lt;/ref&gt; wrote in his ''Survey Studies in Reformed Theology'' an essay on "The Decrees of God,"&lt;ref name="Burridge"&gt;Bob Burridge, "[http://www.genevaninstitute.org/syllabus/unit-two-theology-proper/lesson-4-the-decrees-of-god/ Theology Proper: Lesson 4 – The Decrees of God]", ''Survey Studies in Reformed Theology'', Genevan Institute for Reformed Studies (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; also identifying the notion of God becoming the universe as incompatible with Christianity:

{{quote|All the actions of created intelligences are not merely the actions of God. He has created a universe of beings which are said to act freely and responsibly as the proximate causes of their own moral actions. When individuals do evil things it is not God the Creator and Preserver acting. If God was the proximate cause of every act it would make all events to be "God in motion". That is nothing less than pantheism, or more exactly, pandeism.&lt;ref name="Burridge"/&gt;}}
Burridge disagrees that such is the case, decrying that "The Creator is distinct from his creation. The reality of secondary causes is what separates Christian theism from pandeism."&lt;ref name="Burridge"/&gt; Burridge concludes by challenging his reader to determine why "calling God the author of sin demand[s] a pandeistic understanding of the universe effectively removing the reality of sin and moral law."&lt;ref name="Burridge"/&gt;

==Compatibility with scientific and philosophical proofs==

[[Stephen Hawking]]'s recent determination that our universe (and others) needed no Creator to come about inspired the response from [[Deepak Chopra]], interviewed by [[Larry King]], that:

{{quote|He says in the book that at least 10 to the power of 500 universes could possibly exist in super position of possibility at this level, which to me suggests an omniscient being. The only difference I have was God did not create the universe, God became the universe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1009/10/lkl.01.html Deepak Chopra interview with Larry King].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Chopra insists that Hawking's discoveries speak only to the nature of God, not to its existence.

===''The God Theory''===

Physicist [[Bernard Haisch]] has published two books expressing such a model of our universe.  The first was the 2006 book entitled ''The God Theory'', in which he writes:
{{quote|I offer a genuine insight into how you can, and should, be a rational, science-believing human being and at the same time know that you are also an immortal spiritual being, a spark of God. I propose a worldview that offers a way out of the hate and fear-driven violence engulfing the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= The God Theory: Universes, Zero-point Fields, And What's Behind It All | author = Bernard Haisch | year = 2006 | ISBN = 1578633745}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Haisch published a followup in 2010, "The Purpose-Driven Universe." Both books reject both atheism and traditional theistic viewpoints, favoring instead a model wherein the deity has become the universe, to share in the actualized experiences therein manifested.  Haisch provides as proof of his views a combination of [[fine tuning]] and mystical experiences arguments. Haisch additionally points to the peculiar capabilities of persons with [[autism]] and like defects of the [[brain]] experiencing [[savant syndrome]], and especially having the ability to perform complex mathematical calculations. Haisch contends that this is consistent with humans being fragments of a supreme power, with our minds acting as filters to reduce that power to a comprehensible experience, and with the savantic mind having a broken filter which allows access to the use of greater capacities.

Alan Dawe's 2011 book ''The God Franchise'', likewise proposes the human experience as being a temporarily segregated sliver of the experience of God.&lt;ref name="Dawe"/&gt; In 2013, [[Australia]]n [[religious studies]] scholar Raphael Lataster proposed that "Pandeism could be the most likely God-concept of all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A mixture of the two, pandeism, could be the most likely God-concept of all.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warren Sharpe wrote:
{{quote|To the Hindu, for example, God didn't ''create'' the universe, but God ''became'' the universe. Then he forgot that he became the universe. Why would God do this?

No, you should have all the fun yourself. To accomplish this, God transformed into the whole universe. ''God is the Universe'', and everything in it. But the universe doesn't know that because that would ruin the suspense. The universe is God's great drama, and God is the stage, the actors, and the audience all at once. The title of this epic drama is "The Great Unknown Outcome". Throw in potent elements like passion, love, hate, good, evil, free will; and who knows what will happen?

Brahma "expands", and becomes the Universe woven out of his own substance.&lt;ref&gt;Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, ''The secret doctrine: the synthesis of science, religion, and philosophy'', Volume 1, 1893, 111.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}
The '''Golden Rule''' is the principle of treating others as one's self would wish to be treated. It is a [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] that is found in many religions and [[culture]]s.&lt;ref name="Flew"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=golden rule|editor =[[Antony Flew]] | encyclopedia=A Dictionary of Philosophy |publisher = [[Pan Books]] in association with [[Macmillan Publishers|The MacMillan Press]] | year = 1979 | location = London | page = 134 | isbn=0-330-48730-2}} This dictionary of philosophy contains the following quote under the entry for "golden rule": "The maxim 'Treat others how you wish to be treated'.

Various expressions of the rule exist in the tenets of most religions and creeds through the ages, testifying to its universal applicability." (end quote).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Terence Stace]] argued that the Golden Rule was much more than simply an [[ethics|ethical code]]. Instead, he posits, it "express[es] the essence of a universal [[morality]]." The rationale for this crucial distinction occupies much of his book ''The Concept of Morals'' (1937). See:

The Golden Rule can be considered an '''ethic of reciprocity''' in some [[religion]]s, although other religions treat it differently. The maxim may appear as either a positive or negative [[injunction]] governing conduct:

* One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself (positive or directive form).
* One should ''not'' treat others in ways that one would ''not'' like to be treated (negative or prohibitive form).&lt;ref name="Flew" /&gt;
* What you wish upon others, you wish upon yourself (empathic or responsive form).&lt;ref name="Flew" /&gt;

The idea dates at least to the early [[Confucian]] times (551–479 BCE) according to [[Rushworth Kidder]], who identifies that this concept appears prominently in [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Judaism]], [[Taoism]],  [[Zoroastrianism]], and "the rest of the world's major religions".&lt;ref name="W.A.

== Ancient history ==

=== Ancient Egypt ===
Possibly the earliest affirmation of the maxim of reciprocity, reflecting the ancient Egyptian goddess [[Ma'at]], appears in the story of [[The Eloquent Peasant]], which dates to the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (c. 2040–1650 BC): "Now this is the command: Do to the doer to make him do."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/wsrp/information/REL499_2011/Eloquent%20Peasant.pdf Eloquent Peasant PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925125920/http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/wsrp/information/REL499_2011/Eloquent%20Peasant.pdf |date=25 September 2015 }} "Now this is the command: do to the doer to make him do"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John Albert Wilson p. 121"&gt;''"The Culture of Ancient Egypt"'', John Albert Wilson, p. 121, [[University of Chicago Press]], 1956, {{ISBN|0-226-90152-1}} "Now this is the command: Do to the doer to cause that he do"&lt;/ref&gt; This proverb embodies the ''[[do ut des]]'' principle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/wsrp/information/REL499_2011/Eloquent%20Peasant.pdf Eloquent Peasant PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925125920/http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/wsrp/information/REL499_2011/Eloquent%20Peasant.pdf |date=25 September 2015 }} "The peasant quotes a proverb that embodies the do ut des principle"&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]] (c. 664–323 BC) papyrus contains an early negative affirmation of the Golden Rule: "That which you hate to be done to you, do not do to another."&lt;ref&gt;"''[http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/saoc52.pdf A Late Period Hieratic Wisdom Text: P.

=== Ancient India ===

==== Sanskrit tradition ====
In ''[[Mahabharata|Mahābhārata]]'', the ancient epic of India, there is a discourse in which the wise minister Vidura advises the King Yuddhiśhṭhira
{{quote|Listening to wise scriptures, austerity, sacrifice, respectful faith, social welfare, forgiveness, purity of intent, compassion, truth and self-control—are the ten wealth of character (self). O king aim for these, may you be steadfast in these qualities. These are the basis of prosperity and rightful living. These are highest attainable things. All worlds are balanced on ''dharma'', ''dharma'' encompasses ways to prosperity as well. O King, ''dharma'' is the best quality to have, wealth the medium and desire (''kāma'') the lowest. Hence, (keeping these in mind), by self-control and by making ''dharma'' (right conduct) your main focus, treat others as you treat yourself.| ''Mahābhārata Shānti-Parva'' 167:9}}

==== Tamil tradition ====
In Chapter 32 in the [[Aram (Kural book)|Part on Virtue]] of the [[Tirukkuṛaḷ]] (c. 200 BC – c. 500 AD), [[Tiruvalluvar]] says: "Do not do to others what you know has hurt yourself" (K. 316.); "Why does one hurt others knowing what it is to be hurt?" (K. 318). He furthermore opined that it is the determination of the spotless (virtuous) not to do evil, even in return, to those who have cherished enmity and done them evil. (K. 312) The (proper) punishment to those who have done evil (to you), is to put them to shame by showing them kindness, in return and to forget both the evil and the good done on both sides (K. 314)

=== Ancient Greece ===
The Golden Rule in its prohibitive (negative) form was a common principle in [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[Greek philosophy|philosophy]]. Examples of the general concept include:
* "Avoid doing what you would blame others for doing."&amp;nbsp;– [[Thales]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laërtius]], "The Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers", I:36&lt;/ref&gt;  (c. 624 BC – c. 546 BC)
* "What you do not want to happen to you, do not do it yourself either. "&amp;nbsp;– [[Sentences of Sextus|Sextus the Pythagorean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/sent.html|title=The Sentences of Sextus}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest extant reference to Sextus is by Origen in the third century of the common era.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sentences of Sextus|''The Sentences of Sextus Article'']]&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Do not do to others that which angers you when they do it to you."&amp;nbsp;– [[Isocrates]]&lt;ref&gt;Isocrates, ''Nicocles or the Cyprians''&lt;!--not to be confused with the work ''To Nicocles''--&gt;, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0144%3Aspeech%3D3%3Asection%3D61 Isoc 3.61] ([https://archive.org/stream/2139247.0001.001.umich.edu#page/70/mode/2up original text in Greek]); cf.

=== Ancient Persia ===
The [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi Texts]] of [[Zoroastrianism]] (c. 300 BC–1000 AD) were an early source for the Golden Rule: "That nature alone is good which refrains from doing to another whatsoever is not good for itself." Dadisten-I-dinik, 94,5, and "Whatever is disagreeable to yourself do not do unto others."

==== Judaism ====
{{See also|Judaism|Jewish ethics}}
A rule of altruistic reciprocity was first stated positively in a well-known Torah verse (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|ואהבת לרעך כמוך}}):
{{quote|You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against your kinsfolk. Love your neighbor as yourself: I am the LORD.|{{bibleverse||Leviticus|19:18|JP}}}}

[[Hillel the Elder]] (c. 110 BC – 10 AD),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=730&amp;letter=H Jewish Encyclopedia: Hillel]: "His activity of forty years is perhaps historical; and since it began, according to a trustworthy tradition (Shab. 15a), one hundred years before the destruction of Jerusalem, it must have covered the period 30 BC–10 AD&lt;!--B.C. in the original--&gt;"&lt;/ref&gt; used this verse as a most important message of the [[Torah]] for his teachings. Once, he was challenged by a gentile who asked to be converted under the condition that the Torah be explained to him while he stood on one foot. Hillel accepted him as a candidate for [[conversion to Judaism]] but, drawing on {{bibleverse||Leviticus|19:18|JP}}, briefed the man:
{{quote|What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow: this is the whole Torah; the rest is the explanation; go and learn.|{{sourcetext|source=Babylonian Talmud|version=|book=Shabbath|chapter=folio|verse=31a}}|[[Babylonian Talmud]]}}

Hillel recognized brotherly love as the fundamental principle of Jewish ethics. [[Rabbi Akiva]] agreed and suggested that the principle of love must have its foundation in Genesis chapter 1, which teaches that all men are the offspring of Adam, who was made in the image of God ([[Sifra]], Ḳedoshim, iv.; Yer. Ned. ix. 41c; [[Genesis Rabba]] 24).&lt;ref name="a" /&gt; According to [[Adam in rabbinic literature|Jewish rabbinic literature]], the first man [[Adam]] represents the ''unity of mankind''. This is echoed in the modern preamble of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights#Preamble|Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Sanhedrin.4?lang=en|title=Mishnah Seder Nezikin Sanhedrin 4.5|publisher=sefaria.org|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toseftaonline.org/Tractate-Sanhedrin-chapter-8-tosefta-4|title=Tosefta on Mishnah Seder Nezikin Sanhedrin 8.4–9 (Erfurt Manuscript)|publisher=toseftaonline.org|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; And it is also taught, that Adam is last in order according to the evolutionary character of God's creation:&lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=758&amp;letter=A&amp;search=adam#1 |title=ADAM |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Why was only a single specimen of man created first? To teach us that he who destroys a single soul destroys a whole world and that he who saves a single soul saves a whole world; furthermore, so no race or class may claim a nobler ancestry, saying, 'Our father was born first'; and, finally, to give testimony to the greatness of the Lord, who caused the wonderful diversity of mankind to emanate from one type. And why was Adam created last of all beings? To teach him humility; for if he be overbearing, let him remember that the little fly preceded him in the order of creation.&lt;ref name="a" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Jewish Publication Society's edition of [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]] states:&lt;blockquote&gt;Thou shalt not hate thy brother. in thy heart; thou shalt surely rebuke thy neighbour, and not bear sin because of him. 18 Thou shalt not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Torah|publisher=Jewish Publication Society|page=19:17|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/jps/lev019.htm|chapter=Leviticus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This Torah verse represents one of several versions of the ''Golden Rule'', which itself appears in various forms, positive and negative. It is the earliest written version of that concept in a positive form.&lt;ref name="Plaut p. 892"&gt;[[Gunther Plaut|Plaut]], ''The Torah&amp;nbsp;– A Modern Commentary''; Union of American Hebrew Congregations, New York 1981; p. 892.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the eras, the Jewish rabbis were discussing the scope of the meaning of Leviticus 19:18 and 19:34 extensively:

{{quote|The [[Ger toshav|stranger who resides with you]] shall be to you as one of your citizens; you shall love him as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt: I the LORD am your God.|{{bibleverse||Leviticus|19:34|JP}}}}

Commentators summed up foreigners (= Samaritans), proselytes (= 'strangers who resides with you') (Rabbi Akiva, bQuid 75b) or Jews (Rabbi Gamaliel, yKet 3, 1; 27a) to the scope of the meaning.

On the verse, "Love your fellow as yourself," the classic commentator [[Rashi]] quotes from Torat Kohanim, an early Midrashic text regarding the famous dictum of Rabbi Akiva: "Love your fellow as yourself&amp;nbsp;– Rabbi Akiva says this is a great principle of the Torah."&lt;ref&gt;Kedoshim 19:18, Toras Kohanim, ibid. See also Talmud Yerushalmi, Nedarim 9:4; Bereishis Rabbah 24:7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Postage stamps and postal history of Israel|Israel's postal service]] quoted from the previous Leviticus verse when it commemorated the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] on a 1958 [[postage stamp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marbl.library.emory.edu/DigitalExhibits/stamps/015.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407164111/http://marbl.library.emory.edu/DigitalExhibits/stamps/015.html |archivedate=7 April 2008 |title=Sol Singer Collection of Philatelic Judaica |publisher= [[Emory University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bloch-SermonOnTheMount.jpg|thumb|230px|right|[[Jesus]] taught the Golden Rule during the [[Sermon on the Mount]].]]
The "Golden Rule" was given by [[Jesus of Nazareth]] ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+7%3A12&amp;version=NCV Matthew 7:12 NCV], see also [[s:Bible (King James)/Luke#6:31|Luke 6:31]]). The common English phrasing is "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you". A similar form of the phrase appeared in a Catholic [[catechism]] around 1567 (certainly in the reprint of 1583).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

They forbid idolatry, apostasy, heresy, superstition, perjury, blasphemy, and move us to the pure and true worshipping of God in heart, word and deed. In the Second table be seven Commandments, which command us to give reverence and honor to every man in his degree, to profit all, and hurt none: to do unto others, as we would be done to ourselves.")

The Golden Rule is stated positively numerous times in the [[Old Testament]]:  {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Leviticus|chapter=19|verse=18}} ("Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD."; see also [[Great Commandment]]) and {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Leviticus|chapter=19|verse=34}} ("But treat them just as you treat your own citizens. Love foreigners as you love yourselves, because you were foreigners one time in Egypt. I am the Lord your God.").

The [[Old Testament]] [[Deuterocanonical]] books of [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]] and [[Sirach]], accepted as part of the Scriptural canon by [[Catholicism|Catholic Church]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]], and the [[Non-Chalcedonian]] Churches, express a negative form of the golden rule:

{{quote|"Do to no one what you yourself dislike."|Tobit 4:15}}
{{quote|"Recognize that your neighbor feels as you do, and keep in mind your own dislikes."|Sirach 31:15}}

Two passages in the [[New Testament]] quote [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] espousing the positive form of the Golden rule:

[[Matthew 7:12]]
{{quote|Do to others what you want them to do to you. This is the meaning of the law of Moses and the teaching of the prophets.}}

{{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Luke|chapter=6|verse=31}}
{{quote|Do to others what you would want them to do to you.}}

A similar passage, a parallel to the [[Great Commandment]], is {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=New International Readers Version|book=Luke|chapter=10|verse=25|range=-28}}

{{quote|&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;And one day an authority on the law stood up to put Jesus to the test. "Teacher," he asked, "what must I do to receive eternal life?"
&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;What is written in the Law?" Jesus replied. "How do you understand it?"
&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;He answered, " ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Love him with all your strength and with all your mind.’(Deuteronomy 6:5) And, ‘Love your neighbor as you love yourself.’ "
&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;"You have answered correctly," Jesus replied. "Do that, and you will live.".}}

The passage in the book of Luke then continues with Jesus answering the question, "Who is my neighbor?", by telling the parable of the [[Good Samaritan]], indicating that "your neighbor" is anyone in need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christnotes.org/commentary.php?b=42&amp;c=10&amp;com=wes |title=John Wesley's Explanatory Notes on Luke 10 |publisher=Christnotes.org |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This extends to all, including those who are generally considered hostile.

Jesus' teaching goes beyond the negative formulation of not doing what one would not like done to themselves, to the positive formulation of actively doing good to another that, if the situations were reversed, one would desire that the other would do for them. This formulation, as indicated in the parable of the Good Samaritan, emphasizes the needs for positive action that brings benefit to another, not simply restraining oneself from negative activities that hurt another.&lt;ref&gt;Moore: Judaism in the First Centuries of the Christian Era; Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 1927–1930; Vol. 2, p. 87, Vol. 3, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one passage of the [[New Testament]], [[Paul the Apostle]] refers to the golden rule:

{{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Galatians|chapter=5|verse=14 | Galatians 5:14 }}
{{quote|&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.}}

==== Islam ====
{{See also|Islamic ethics}}

The Arabian peninsula was known to not practice the golden rule prior to the advent of Islam.  "Pre-Islamic Arabs regarded the survival of the tribe, as most essential and to be ensured by the ancient rite of blood vengeance"{{according to whom|date=May 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Th.

However, this all changed when Muhammad came on the scene:
{{quote|Fakir al-Din al-Razi and several other Qur'anic commentators have pointed out that Qur'an 83:1-6 is an implicit statement of the Golden Rule, which is explicitly stated in the tradition, "Pay, Oh Children of Adam, as you would love to be paid, and be just as you would love to have justice!" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Th.

{{quote|Similar examples of the golden rule are found in the hadith of the prophet Muhammad.

Prophet said: "As you would have people do to you, do to them; and what you dislike to be done to you, don't do to them. Now let the stirrup go!" [This maxim is enough for you; go and act in accordance with it!]"|[[Kitab al-Kafi]], vol. 2, p. 146}}

==== Jainism ====
{{See also|Jainism|Ahimsa in Jainism}}

The Golden Rule is paramount in the Jainist philosophy and can be seen in the doctrines of [[Ahimsa in Jainism|Ahimsa]] and [[Karma in Jainism|Karma]]. As part of the prohibition of causing any living beings to suffer, Jainism forbids inflicting upon others what is harmful to oneself.

The following quotation from the [[Acaranga Sutra]] sums up the philosophy of Jainism:
{{Quote|Nothing which breathes, which exists, which lives, or which has essence or potential of life, should be destroyed or ruled over, or subjugated, or harmed, or denied of its essence or potential.

In support of this Truth, I ask you a question – ''"Is sorrow or pain desirable to you ?"'' If you say ''"yes it is"'', it would be a lie. If you say, ''"No, It is not"'' you will be expressing the truth. '''Just as sorrow or pain is not desirable to you, so it is to all which breathe, exist, live or have any essence of life.''' To you and all, it is undesirable, and painful, and repugnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Jacobi | first =Hermann | title =Ācāranga Sūtra, Jain Sutras Part I, Sacred Books of the East, Vol. 22. | year= 1884 | url =http://www.sacred-texts.com/jai/sbe22/index.htm}} Sutra 155–6&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|A man should wander about treating all creatures as he himself would be treated. | [[Sutrakritanga]] |''1.11.33''}}

{{Quote|In happiness and suffering, in joy and grief, we should regard all creatures as we regard our own self.|Lord Mahavira|24th Tirthankara}}

Dixit | title ={{IAST|Samaṇ Suttaṁ}} | publisher =Bhagwan Mahavir memorial Samiti | year= 1993 | location =New Delhi }}&lt;/ref&gt; gives further insight into this precept:-

{{Quote|Just as pain is not agreeable to you, it is so with others. Knowing this principle of equality treat other with respect and compassion.|Suman Suttam|''verse 150''}}

{{Quote|Killing a living being is killing one's own self; showing compassion to a living being is showing compassion to oneself. He who desires his own good, should avoid causing any harm to a living being. |Suman Suttam|''verse 151''}}

The same idea is also presented in V.12 and VI.30 of the ''[[Analects]]'' (c. 500 BC), which can be found in the online [[Chinese Text Project]]. The phraseology differs from the Christian version of the Golden Rule. It does not presume to do anything unto others, but merely to avoid doing what would be harmful. It does not preclude doing good deeds and taking moral positions, but there is slim possibility for a Confucian missionary outlook, such as one can justify with the Christian Golden Rule.

Mozi regarded the golden rule as a corollary to the cardinal virtue of impartiality, and encouraged [[egalitarianism]] and selflessness in relationships.

And although it isn’t possible to know what it really feels like to be a different person or live in different circumstances and have different life experiences, it isn’t difficult for most of us to imagine what would cause us suffering and to try to avoid causing suffering to others.

''[is] (…)'' the single greatest, simplest, and most important moral axiom humanity has ever invented, one which reappears in the writings of almost every culture and religion throughout history, the one we know as the Golden Rule.

Moral directives do not need to be complex or obscure to be worthwhile, and in fact, it is precisely this rule's simplicity which makes it great. It is easy to come up with, easy to understand, and easy to apply, and these three things are the hallmarks of a strong and healthy moral system. The idea behind it is readily graspable: before performing an action which might harm another person, try to imagine yourself in their position, and consider whether you would want to be the recipient of that action. If you would not want to be in such a position, the other person probably would not either, and so you should not do it. It is the basic and fundamental human trait of empathy, the ability to vicariously experience how another is feeling, that makes this possible, and it is the principle of empathy by which we should live our lives.|sign=Adam Lee|source=Ebon Musings, "A decalogue for the modern world"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebonmusings.org/atheism/new10c.html |title=A decalogue for the modern world |publisher=Ebonmusings.org |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Other contexts ==

=== Human rights ===
According to [[Marc H. Bornstein]], and William E. Paden, the Golden Rule is arguably the most essential basis for the modern concept of [[human rights]], in which each individual has a right to just treatment, and a reciprocal responsibility to ensure justice for others.&lt;ref&gt;Defined another way, it "''refers to the balance in an interactive system such that each party has both rights and duties, and the subordinate norm of complementarity states that one's rights are the other's obligation.''"{{cite book|last=Bornstein |first=Marc H.|title=Handbook of Parenting|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|year=2002|page=5|isbn=978-0-8058-3782-7}} See also: {{cite book|last=Paden |first=William E.|title=Interpreting the Sacred: Ways of Viewing Religion|publisher=Beacon Press|year=2003|pages=131–132|isbn=978-0-8070-7705-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However [[Leo Damrosch]] argued that the notion that the Golden Rule pertains to "rights" per se is a contemporary interpretation and has nothing to do with its origin. The development of human "rights" is a modern political ideal that began as a philosophical concept promulgated through the philosophy of [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] in 18th century France, among others. His writings influenced [[Thomas Jefferson]], who then incorporated Rousseau's reference to "inalienable rights" into the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] in 1776. Damrosch argued that to confuse the Golden Rule with human rights is to apply contemporary thinking to ancient concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Science and economics ==
{{further information|Reciprocity (social psychology)|Reciprocal altruism}}

There has been research published arguing that some 'sense' of fair play and the Golden Rule may be stated and rooted in terms of [[Neuroscience|neuroscientific]] and [[Neuroethics|neuroethical]] principles.&lt;ref&gt;Pfaff, Donald W., "The Neuroscience of Fair Play: Why We (Usually) Follow the Golden Rule", Dana Press, The Dana Foundation, New York, 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-932594-27-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Golden Rule can also be explained from the perspectives of psychology, philosophy, sociology, human evolution, and economics. Psychologically, it involves a person [[Empathy|empathizing]] with others. Philosophically, it involves a person perceiving their neighbor also as "I" or "self".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Golden Rule |last1=Wattles | first1=Jeffrey | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologically, "love your neighbor as yourself" is applicable between individuals, between groups, and also between individuals and groups.  In evolution, "[[reciprocal altruism]]" is seen as a distinctive advance in the capacity of human groups to survive and reproduce, as their exceptional brains demanded exceptionally long childhoods and ongoing provision and protection even beyond that of the immediate family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vogel| first1=Gretchen|title=The Evolution of the Golden Rule|journal=Science|volume=303|issue=Feb 2004|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Golden Rule#Economics|economics]], Richard Swift, referring to ideas from [[David Graeber]], suggests that "without some kind of reciprocity society would no longer be able to exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swift|first1=Richard|title=Pathways &amp; possibilites|journal=New Internationalist|volume=484|issue=July/August 2015|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Philosophers, such as [[Immanuel Kant]]&lt;ref name="Kant" /&gt; and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2007/05/the_golden_rule.html |title=Only a Game: The Golden Rule |publisher=Onlyagame.typepad.com |date=24 May 2007 |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; have objected to the rule on a variety of grounds. The most serious among these is its application. How does one know how others want to be treated? The obvious way is to ask them, but this cannot be done if one assumes they have not reached a particular and relevant understanding.

=== Differences in values or interests ===
[[George Bernard Shaw]] wrote, "Do not do unto others as you would that they should do unto you. Their tastes may be different."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=George Bernard|title=Man and Superman|date=1903|publisher=Archibald Constable &amp; Co.|page=227|url=https://archive.org/stream/mansupermancomed00shawrich#page/226/mode/2up|accessdate=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that if your values are not shared with others, the way you want to be treated will not be the way they want to be treated. Hence, the Golden Rule of "do unto others" is "dangerous in the wrong hands,"&lt;ref&gt;Source: p. 76 of ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'', [[Iain King]], 2008, Continuum, {{ISBN|978-1-84706-347-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; according to philosopher [[Iain King]], because "some fanatics have no aversion to death: the Golden Rule might inspire them to kill others in suicide missions."&lt;ref&gt;Source: p. 76 of ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'', Iain King, 2008, Continuum, {{ISBN|978-1-84706-347-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Differences in situations ===
[[Immanuel Kant]] famously criticized the golden rule for not being sensitive to differences of situation, noting that a prisoner duly convicted of a crime could appeal to the golden rule while asking the judge to release him, pointing out that the judge would not want anyone else to send him to prison, so he should not do so to others.&lt;ref name="Kant"&gt;Kant, Immanuel ''Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals'', footnote 13. Cambridge University Press (28 April 1998). {{ISBN|978-0-521-62695-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant's ''[[Categorical imperative|Categorical Imperative]]'', introduced in ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]]'', is often [[Categorical imperative#The Golden Rule|confused with the Golden Rule.]]

=== Cannot be a sole guide to action ===
In his book ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'', philosopher [[Iain King]] has argued that "(although) the idea of mirroring your treatment of others with their treatment of you is very widespread indeed… most ancient wisdoms express this negatively – advice on what you should not do, rather than what you should."&lt;ref&gt;Source: p. 110 of ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'', Iain King, Continuum, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-84706-347-2}}. Accessed 20 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues this creates a bias in favour of inertia which allows bad actions and states of affairs to persist. The positive formulation, meanwhile, can be "incendiary",&lt;ref name="Source 2008"&gt;Source: p. 112 of ''How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time'', Iain King, Continuum, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-84706-347-2}}. Accessed 20 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; since it "can lead to cycles of tit-for-tat reciprocity," unless it is accompanied by a corrective mechanism, such as a concept of forgiveness.&lt;ref name="Source 2008" /&gt; Therefore, he concludes that there can be no viable formulation of the Golden Rule, unless it is heavily qualified by other maxims.&lt;ref&gt;Source: p. 114 of ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'', Iain King, Continuum, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-84706-347-2}}. Accessed 20 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Responses to criticisms&lt;!--linked from [[The Platinum Rule]]; [[Platinum Rule (principle)]] redirects here--&gt; ===
[[Walter Terence Stace]], in ''The Concept of Morals'' (1937), wrote:

{{quote|Mr. Bernard Shaw's remark "Do not do unto others as you would that they should do unto you. Their tastes may be different" is no doubt a smart saying. But it seems to overlook the fact that "doing as you would be done by" includes taking into account your neighbor's tastes as you would that he should take yours into account. Thus the "golden rule" might still express the essence of a universal morality ''even if no two men in the world had any needs or tastes in common''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Marcus George Singer]] observed that there are two importantly different ways of looking at the golden rule: as requiring (1)&amp;nbsp;that you perform specific actions that you want others to do to you or (2)&amp;nbsp;that you guide your behavior in the same general ways that you want others to.&lt;ref&gt;M. G. Singer, The Ideal of a Rational Morality, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; Counter-examples to the golden rule typically are more forceful against the first than the second.

In his book on the golden rule, Jeffrey Wattles makes the similar observation that such objections typically arise while applying the golden rule in certain general ways (namely, ignoring differences in taste, in situation, and so forth). But if we apply the golden rule to our own method of using it, asking in effect if we would want other people to apply the golden rule in such ways, the answer would typically be no, since it is quite predictable that others' ignoring of such factors will lead to behavior which we object to. It follows that we should not do so ourselves—according to the golden rule. In this way, the golden rule may be self-correcting.&lt;ref&gt;Wattles, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; An article by Jouni Reinikainen develops this suggestion in greater detail.&lt;ref&gt;Jouni Reinikainen, "The Golden Rule and the Requirement of Universalizability." Journal of Value Inquiry. 39(2): 155–168, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible, then, that the golden rule can itself guide us in identifying which differences of situation are morally relevant. We would often want other people to ignore any prejudice against our [[Race (human categorization)|race]] or nationality when deciding how to act towards us, but would also want them to not ignore our differing preferences in food, desire for aggressiveness, and so on. This principle of "doing unto others, wherever possible, as ''they'' would be done by..." has sometimes been termed the [[platinum rule]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Popper]], ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', Vol. 2 (1966 [1945]), p. 386. Dubbed "the platinum rule" in business books such as Charles J. Jacobus, Thomas E. Gillett, ''Georgia Real Estate: An Introduction to the Profession'', Cengage Learning, 2007, p. 409 and Jeremy Comfort, Peter Franklin, ''The Mindful International Manager: How to Work Effectively Across Cultures'', Kogan Page, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gordon Alan Baym''' (born July 1, 1935) is an American [[theoretical physicist]].

Born in New York City, he graduated from the [[Brooklyn Technical High School]], and received his undergraduate degree from [[Cornell University]] in 1956. He earned his Ph.D. from [[Harvard University]] in 1960, studying under [[Julian Schwinger]].

He joined the physics faculty of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] in 1963, becoming a full professor in 1968. His areas of research range from [[condensed matter physics|condensed-matter physics]] to [[nuclear physics]] and [[astrophysics]], as well as the [[history of physics]].

In 1962 he and [[Leo Kadanoff]] collaborated on ''Quantum Statistical Mechanics: [[Green's function|Green's Function]] Methods in Equilibrium and Nonequilibrium Problems''.  In 1969 he published ''Lectures on Quantum Mechanics'', a widely used graduate textbook that, unconventionally, begins with [[photon polarization]].  In 1991 he and Chris Pethick published the [[monograph]] ''Landau [[Fermi liquid|Fermi-Liquid]] Theory: Concepts and Applications''.

Baym was awarded the [[Hans Bethe Prize|Hans A. Bethe Prize]] in 2002 "For his superb synthesis of fundamental concepts which have provided an understanding of matter at extreme conditions, ranging from crusts and interiors of [[neutron star]]s to [[Quark–gluon plasma|matter at ultrahigh temperature]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aps.org/programs/honors/prizes/prizerecipient.cfm?name=Gordon%20Baym&amp;year=2002 Prize Recipient&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He also received the [[Lars Onsager Prize]] in 2008 "for fundamental applications of statistical physics to quantum fluids, including Fermi liquid theory and ground-state properties of dilute quantum gases, and for bringing a conceptual unity to these areas"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aps.org/programs/honors/prizes/prizerecipient.cfm?name=Gordon%20Baym&amp;year=2008 Prize Recipient&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Christopher Pethick]] and Tin-Lun Ho.

He has four children, professors of communications [[Nancy Baym]] and [[Geoffrey Baym]], mathematician and biologist [http://math.mit.edu/~baym/ Michael Baym], and cognitive neuroscientist Carol Baym. He was married to [[Nina Baym]], a professor of English at the UIUC, and [[Lillian Hoddeson]], a professor of History at UIUC.

{{Chinese Legalism}}

'''Han Fei''' ({{IPAc-en|h|ɑː|n}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/han "Han"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{zh|t=韓非|s=韩非|p=Hán Fēi|first=t}}; {{circa|lk=no|280}}{{snd}}233 BC), also known as '''Han Fei Zi''', was a Chinese philosopher of the [[Warring States period]] "[[Chinese Legalist]]" school. He is often considered to be the greatest representative of Chinese Legalism for his eponymous work the ''[[Han Feizi]],&lt;ref name=cc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_aboutchina/2003-09/24/content_23104.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150808084724/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_aboutchina/2003-09/24/content_23104.htm |archivedate=2015-08-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;'' synthesizing the methods of his predecessors.&lt;ref name = "hpt"/&gt;

His writings were very influential on the future first emperor of China, [[Qin Shi Huang]]. After the early demise of the [[Qin dynasty]] Han's philosophy was officially vilified by the following [[Han Dynasty]]. Despite its outcast status throughout the history of imperial China, his political theory continued to heavily influence every dynasty thereafter, and the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] ideal of a rule without laws was never again realised. [[Shu Han]]'s chancellor [[Zhuge Liang]] demanded emperor [[Liu Shan]] read the Han Feizi for learning the way of ruling.&lt;ref name = "hpt"/&gt;

Han borrowed [[Shang Yang]]'s emphasis on laws, [[Shen Buhai]]'s emphasis on administrative technique, and [[Shen Dao]]'s ideas on authority and prophecy, emphasising that the autocrat will be able to achieve firm control over the state with the mastering of his predecessors' methodologies: his position of power (勢, ''Shì''); technique (術, ''Shù''), and law (法, ''[[Fa (concept)|Fǎ]]'').

==Name==
''Han Fei'' is his name, while -''Zi'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|子}}}}, &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"Master") was often added to philosophers' names as an [[Chinese honorifics|honorific]]. The title ''Han Feizi'' is also used to denote the [[Han Feizi (book)|book written by him]].

==Life==
Unlike the other famed philosophers of the time, Han Fei was a member of the ruling aristocracy, having been born into the ruling family of the [[Han (state)|State of Han]] during the end phase of the [[Warring States period]]. In this context, his works have been interpreted by some scholars as being directed to his cousin, the King of Han.{{ref|nobility}} [[Sima Qian]]’s [[Shi ji]] says that Han Fei studied together with future Qin chancellor [[Li Si]] under the Confucian philosopher [[Xun Kuang|Xunzi]].  It is said that because of his stutter, Han Fei could not properly present his ideas in court. His advice otherwise being ignored, but observing the slow decline of his Han state, he developed "one of the most brilliant (writing) styles in ancient China."&lt;ref name=cc/&gt;&lt;ref name = "hpt"&gt;''Hàn Phi Tử'', Vietnamese translation by Phan Ngọc, Nhà xuất bản Văn học, HCMC 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Sima Qian's biography of Han Fei is as follows: "Han Fei was a prince of Han, in favor of the study of name/form and law/art which takes its root in the [[Huang-Lao]] philosophy. He was born a stutterer and was not able to dispute well, but he was good at writing papers. Together with his friend, Li Si, he served Xun Qing, and Si himself admitted that he was not as competent as Fei. Seeing Han was on the decline, he often remonstrated with the king of Han by submitting papers, but the king did not agree to employ him. At this, Han Fei was frustrated with the reality that, in governing a state, the king did not endeavour to refine and clarify the juridical system of the state, to control his subjects by taking over power, to enhance state property and defence, or to call and employ the wise by enhancing the state.

Rather, the king employed the corrupted and treacherous and put them in higher positions over the wise. He regarded the intellectuals as a disturbance to the Law by employing their literature, and thought that knights violate the prohibition of the state by using armed forces. While the state was in peace, the king liked to patronise the honoured; while in need, he employed warriors with armour and helmet. So the cultivated men could not be employed and the men employed could not be cultivated. Severely distressed over the reality that men of high integrity and uprightness were not embraced by the subjects with immorality and corruption, he observed the changes in the gaining and losing of the past. Therefore, he wrote several papers like Gu Fen, Wu Tan, Nei-Wai Chu, Shou Lin, and Shei Nan, which amount to one hundred thousand words. However, while Han Fei himself knew well of the difficulty of persuasion and created the detailed writing, Shei Nan, he eventually killed himself at Qin. He could not escape the trap of words for himself."&lt;ref&gt;Tae Hyun KIM 2010 p.15, Other Laozi Parallels in the Hanfeizi&lt;/ref&gt;

His works ultimately ended up in the hands of [[Qin Shi Huang|the thrilled Qin king]]. Qin king commented "''If I can make friends with this person (Han Fei), I may die without regrets''." and invited Han Fei to Qin. Han Fei presented the essay "Preserving the Han" to ask Qin king not to attack his homeland, but his ex-friend and rival Li Si - who was jealous of Han Fei - used that essay to convinced to imprison Han Fei on account of his likely loyalty to Han. Han Fei responded by writing another essay named "In the first time of meeting Qin king", hoping to use his writing talent to win the king's heart. Han Fei did win the king's heart, but not before Li Si forced him to commit suicide by drinking poison. The Qin king later regretted about the unfortunate death of Han Fei.&lt;ref name=cc/&gt;&lt;ref name="hpt"/&gt;

Xunzi formed the hypothesis that human nature is evil, virtueless and suggested human infants must be brought to their virtuous form through social-class-oriented Confucian moral education. Without such, Xunzi argued, man would act virtuelessly and be steered by his own human nature to commit immoral acts. Han Fei's education and life experience during the Warring States period, and in his own Han state, contributed his synthesis of a philosophy for the management of an amoral and interest-driven administration, to which morality seemed a loose and inefficient tool. Han agreed with his teacher's theory of "virtueless by birth", but as in previous Legalist philosophy, pragmatically proposed to steer people by their own interest-driven nature.

Hoppe identifies as a [[cultural conservatism|culturally conservative]] libertarian. Some of his remarks and ideas have provoked controversy among his libertarian peers and his colleagues at UNLV. His belief in rights of property owners to establish private covenant communities, from which homosexuals and political dissidents may be "physically removed," has proved particularly divisive.&lt;ref name="pp. 216–218" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/library/my-battle-thought-police|title=My Battle With The Thought Police|first=|last=kanopiadmin|date=11 April 2005|website=Mises.org|access-date=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoppe also garners controversy due to his support for restrictive limits on immigration which critics argue is at odds with libertarianism and anarchism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ganz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2017/09/19/libertarians-have-more-in-common-with-the-alt-right-than-they-want-you-to-think/|title=Perspective - Libertarians have more in common with the alt-right than they want you to think|first=John|last=Ganz|date=19 September 2017|publisher=|access-date=16 October 2017|via=www.WashingtonPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
[[File:MurrayBW.jpg|thumb|upright|left|125px|Hoppe called [[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard]] his [[mentor]] and master.]]

Hoppe was born in [[Peine]], [[West Germany]], did undergraduate studies at [[Universität des Saarlandes]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://thegodthatfailed.org/2011/10/01/jeff-tucker-interviews-hans-hermann-hoppe/ ''Jeff Tucker interviews Hans-Hermann Hoppe''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003232639/http://thegodthatfailed.org/2011/10/01/jeff-tucker-interviews-hans-hermann-hoppe/ |date=2011-10-03 }} (1 October 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; and received his MA and PhD degrees from [[Goethe University Frankfurt]].&lt;ref name="UNLV cat"/&gt; He studied under [[Jürgen Habermas]], a leading German intellectual of the post-WWII era, but gradually came to reject Habermas's ideas, and European leftism generally, regarding them as "intellectually barren and morally bankrupt."&lt;ref&gt;[[Lew Rockwell]], introduction to Hoppe's ''A Short History of Man'' (2015), Auburn, Mississippi: Mises Institute, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a post-doctoral fellow at the [[University of Michigan]], in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], from 1976 to 1978 and earned his [[habilitation]] in Foundations of Sociology and Economics from the University of Frankfurt in 1981. From 1986&lt;ref name=rallo&gt;{{cite web|title=Juan Ramón Rallo interviews Mises Institute scholar Hans-Hermann Hoppe at the Instituto Juan de Mariana's|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AETnctIcpVI#t=302s}}&lt;/ref&gt; until his retirement in 2008,&lt;ref name="Bell1"/&gt; Hoppe was a professor in the School of Business at [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]]. He is a Distinguished Fellow of the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], the publisher of much of his work, and was editor of various Mises Institute periodicals.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Herman Hoppe, [https://mises.org/books/economicsethics.pdf ''The Ethics and Economics of Private Property], Second Edition, [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], p. xii, {{ISBN|978-0945466406}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoppe has stated that [[Murray Rothbard]] was his "principal teacher, mentor and master".&lt;ref name="Bell1"/&gt; After reading Rothbard's books and being converted to a [[Murray Rothbard|Rothbardian]] political position, Hoppe moved from Germany to New York City to be with Rothbard, and then followed Rothbard to the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]], "working and living side-by-side with him, in constant and immediate personal contact."  According to Hoppe, from 1985 until Rothbard's 1995 death, Hoppe considered Rothbard his "dearest fatherly friend".&lt;ref&gt;Hoppe, Hans-Hermann (1995). L. Rockwell (Ed.), from ''[https://mises.org/books/memoriam.pdf Murray Rothbard, In Memoriam]''. Auburn, AL: Ludwig von Mises Institute. pp. 33–37&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoppe resides in Turkey with his wife Gulcin Imre Hoppe, an Austrian school economist.&lt;ref name="Hans-Hermann Hoppe"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salihovic, Elnur (2015). Major Players in the Muslim Business World. Universal Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Property and Freedom Society===
{{Main|Property and Freedom Society}}
In 2006, Hoppe founded The Property and Freedom Society ("PFS") as a reaction against the [[Milton Friedman]]-influenced [[Mont Pelerin Society]], which he has derided as "socialist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Belien|first=Paul|title=The Property and Freedom Society: Standing Athwart History, Yelling Stop|url=http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/1104|publisher=Brussels Journal|access-date=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the fifth anniversary of PFS, Hoppe reflected on its goals:&lt;ref name="4H PFS"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoppe|first=Hans Hermann|title=The Property And Freedom Society – Reflections After Five Years|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/1970/01/hans-hermann-hoppe/my-life-on-the-right/|publisher=lewrockwell.com|access-date=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|On the one hand, positively, it was to explain and elucidate the legal, economic, cognitive and cultural requirements and features of a free, state-less natural order.

On the other hand, negatively, it was to unmask the State and showcase it for what it really is: an institution run by gangs of murderers, plunderers and thieves, surrounded by willing executioners, propagandists, sycophants, crooks, liars, clowns, charlatans, dupes and useful idiots – an institution that dirties and taints everything it touches.}}

Controversially, invitees have included disparate political dissenters ranging from [[Neo-Ottomanism|neo-Ottomanist]] and [[Islam|Muslim]] speakers such as [[Mustafa Akyol]] &lt;ref name="PFS08"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://propertyandfreedom.org/2018/02/pfs-2008-annual-meeting-speakers-and-presentations/|title=PFS 2008 Annual Meeting|website=propertyandfreedom.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[alt-right]] and [[white nationalist]] speakers such as [[Richard B. Spencer|Richard Spencer]] and [[Peter Brimelow]], the founder of [[VDARE]].&lt;ref name="Ganz"/&gt; He has stated that his invitation to alt-right figures was a feature of his conception of free speech rather than common ground in ideology. Rather than inviting any alt-right figures to later conferences, he has claimed to oppose their ideals and instead invited speakers including [[Peter Thiel]].&lt;ref name="Thiel PFS invitation"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inc.com/tess-townsend/thiel-out-new-yorker-tech-fest.html|title=Embroiled in Controversy, Peter Thiel Cancels Another Public Appearance|last=Townsend|first=Tess|website=Inc.com|date=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting on the presence of [[alt-right]] speakers at previous meetings, and his decision against re-inviting them, Hoppe stated at the 2018 Annual Meeting:&lt;ref name="Libertarianism and the Alt-right"&gt;Hans Hoppe, [https://misesuk.org/2017/10/20/libertarianism-and-the-alt-right-hoppe-speech-2017/], Libertarianism and the Alt-right&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We do not approve of violence, and we reject any solutions that are bad in themselves, and that require a larger and more intrusive state than we now have. Libertarians believe in freedom of speech and freedom of association without reservation. Many individuals of the Alternative Right – not all of them, it should be said – appear to believe in these freedoms for themselves, and only for others until they are in charge.}}

==Argumentation ethics==
{{Main|Argumentation ethics}}
[[File:Hans-Hermann-Hoppe.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Hoppe in 2005]]
In the September 1988 issue of [[Liberty (libertarian magazine)|''Liberty'']],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoppe|first=Hans-Hermann|title=The Ultimate Justification of the Private Property Ethic|journal=Liberty|date=September 1988|volume=2|issue=1|pages=20–22|url=http://www.libertyunbound.com/sites/files/printarchive/Liberty_Magazine_September_1988.pdf|quote=The mere fact that an individual argues presupposes that he owns himself and has a right to his own life and property. This provides a basis for libertarian theory radically different from both natural rights theory and utilitarianism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoppe attempted to establish an [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] and [[Value judgment|value-neutral]] justification for [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] ethics by devising a new theory which he named ''[[argumentation ethics]]''.&lt;ref name=libertymag&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hanshoppe.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/liberty_symposium.pdf|title=''Symposium: Breakthrough or Buncombe?'' with comments from Murray Rothbard, David D. Friedman, Leland B. Yeager, David Gordon and Douglas B. Rasmussen and from Hans-Hermann Hoppe|journal=Liberty|date= November 1988|volume=2|number=2|access-date=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoppe asserts that any argument which in any respect purports to contradict libertarian principles is logically incoherent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/journals/jls/20_2/20_2_3.pdf Hans-Hermann Hoppe's Argumentation Ethic: A Critique], Robert Murphy and Gene Callahan. Relevant text on Page 3: "Therefore, [Hoppe] concludes that the libertarian view of property rights is the only one that can possibly be defended by rational argument."&lt;/ref&gt; In the following issue, ''Liberty'' published comments by ten of Hoppe's fellow libertarians, followed by a rejoinder from Hoppe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Symposium|title=Hans-Hermannn Hoppe's Argumentation Ethics: Breakthrough or Buncombe?|journal=Liberty|date=November 1988|volume=2|issue=2|pages=44–54 |url=http://www.libertyunbound.com/sites/files/printarchive/Liberty_Magazine_November_1988.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his comment, Hoppe's friend and Mises Institute supervisor Murray Rothbard wrote that Hoppe's theory was "a dazzling breakthrough for political philosophy in general and for libertarianism in particular" and that Hoppe, "has managed to transcend the famous is/ought, fact/value dichotomy that has plagued philosophy since the days of the Scholastics, and that had brought modern libertarianism into a tiresome deadlock". However, the majority of Hoppe's colleagues surveyed by ''Liberty'' rejected his theory. In his response, Hoppe derided his critics as "[[utilitarians]]".&lt;ref name=libertymag/&gt;

Fellow Mises Institute Senior Fellow [[Roderick T. Long]] states that Hoppe's ''a priori'' formulation of libertarianism denies the fundamental principle of Misesean [[praxeology]]. On the issue of utilitarianism, Long writes, "Hoppe's argument, if it worked, would commit us to recognizing and respecting libertarian rights regardless of what our goals are – but as a praxeologist, I have trouble seeing how any practical requirement can be justified apart from a means-end structure."&lt;ref name="Long Hoppriori"&gt;{{cite web|last=Long|first=Roderick T.|title=The Hoppriori Argument|url=http://praxeology.net/unblog05-04.htm#10|accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another critic argues that Hoppe has not provided any non-circular reasons why we "have to regard moral values as something that ''must'' be regarded as being established through (consensual) argument instead of 'mere' subjective preferences for situations turning out in certain ways". In other words, the theory relies "on the existence [of] certain intuitions, the acceptance of which cannot itself be the result of 'value-free' reasoning."&lt;ref&gt;J. Mikael Olsson, ''Austrian Economics as Political Philosophy'', Stockholm Studies in Politics 161, p. 157, 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on democracy==

{{Main|Democracy: The God That Failed}}

In 2001, Hoppe published ''[[Democracy: The God That Failed]]'' which examines various social and economic phenomena which, Hoppe argues, are problems caused by democratic forms of government. He attributes democracy's alleged failures to pressure groups which seek to increase government expenditures and regulations. Hoppe proposes alternatives and remedies, including [[secession]], decentralization of government, and "complete freedom of contract, occupation, trade and migration".&lt;ref&gt;R.M. Pearce, [http://www.nationalobserver.net/2003_autumn_br5.htm Book Review: Democracy: the God That Failed], [[National Observer (Australia)]], No. 56, Autumn 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Hoppe argues that monarchy would preserve individual liberty more effectively than democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Gordon (philosopher)|David Gordon]], [https://mises.org/misesreview_detail.aspx?control=199 Review of Hans-Hermann Hoppe, ''Democracy: The God that Failed'',] "The Mises Review" of [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], Volume 8, Number 1, Spring 2002; Volume 8, Number 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Hoppe reflected on the relationship between democracy and the arts and concluded that "democracy leads to the subversion and ultimately disappearance of the notion of beauty and universal standards of beauty. Beauty is swamped and submerged by so-called 'modern art'."&lt;ref&gt;Fonseca, Joel (August 1, 2013). [http://www.mises.org.br/Article.aspx?id=1644 "The Brazilian Philosophy Magazine Dicta &amp; Contradicta Interviews Hans-Hermann Hoppe"]. Mises Institute Brazil&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter Block]], a colleague of Hoppe's at the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], asserts that Hoppe's arguments shed light "on historical occurrences, from wars to poverty to inflation to interest rates to crime". Block notes that while Hoppe concedes that 21st-century democracies are more prosperous than the monarchies of old, Hoppe argues that if nobles and kings replaced today's political leaders, their ability to take a long term view of a country's well-being would "improve matters". Block also shared what he called minor criticisms of Hoppe's theses regarding [[time preference]]s, immigration and the gap between libertarianism and conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Block]], [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1946360 Review of ''Democracy: The God that Failed: The Economics and Politics of Monarchy, Democracy, and Natural Order''], [[The American Journal of Economics and Sociology]], Vol. 61, No. 3, July, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hoppe, four years before the publication of ''Democracy'', Alberto Benegas Lynch, Jr. criticized Hoppe's thesis that monarchy is preferable to democracy.&lt;ref name=Reply2ABL&gt;Hoppe, Hans-Hermann (1997). [http://www.hanshoppe.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/benegas.pdf "On Theory and History. Reply to Benegas-Lynch, Jr."]. Published in Gerard Radnitzky, ed., ''Values and the Social Order'', Vol. 3 (Aldershot: Avebury, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;
A Professor of Economics at the [[University of Buenos Aires]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato.org/people/alberto-benegas-lynch "Alberto Benegas Lynch."] Cato.org&lt;/ref&gt; Benegas Lynch provided empirical evidence demonstrating that modern monarchies tend to be far poorer than modern democracies. In reply, Hoppe stated that as a Misesian economist, he believes that economic theories cannot be "established or refuted by historical data." Hoppe also cited the work of scientist [[J. Phillipe Rushton]] to argue that the data are misleading because many modern monarchies are composed of "[[Negroid]]" people {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}. According to Hoppe, "since Caucasians have, on the average, a significantly lower degree of time preference than Negroids, any comparison [between African monarchies and Western democracies] would amount to a systematic distortion of the evidence."  Regardless, Hoppe argues that these data would otherwise systemically favor his case, "and if anything I have erred - though unavoidably so - on the side of democracy."&lt;ref name=Reply2ABL/&gt;{{synthesis inline|date=February 2014}}

===Expulsion of homosexuals and dissidents===
In ''Democracy'' Hoppe describes a fully libertarian society{{Secondary source needed|date=September 2016}} of "[[Covenant (law)#Exclusionary covenants|covenant communities]]" made up of residents who have signed an agreement defining the nature of that community. Hoppe writes "There would be little or no 'tolerance' and 'openmindedness' so dear to left-libertarians. Instead, one would be on the right path toward restoring the freedom of association and exclusion implied in the institution of private property". Hoppe writes that towns and villages could have warning signs saying "no beggars, bums, or homeless, but also no homosexuals, drug users, Jews, Moslems, Germans, or Zulus".&lt;ref name=Hoppe211&gt;Hoppe, Hans-Hermann (2001). ''Democracy: The God That Failed: The Economics and Politics of Monarchy, Democracy and Natural Order'', Transaction Publishers, p. 211. {{ISBN|1412815290}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Block, Walter (2007). [http://www.reasonpapers.com/pdf/29/rp_29_10.pdf "Plumb-Line Libertarianism: A Critique of Hoppe"]. Reason Papers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoppe writes:

{{quote|In a covenant concluded among proprietor and community tenants for the purpose of protecting their private property, no such thing as a right to free (unlimited) speech exists, not even to unlimited speech on one's own tenant-property.&lt;!-- Economist Gene Callahan quotes the previous sentence. [http://ppe.sagepub.com/content/12/1/48.short] Do not remove it without thoroughly discussing it on the talk page. --&gt; One may say innumerable things and promote almost any idea under the sun, but naturally no one is permitted to advocate ideas contrary to the very purpose of the covenant of preserving and protecting private property, such as democracy and communism. There can be no tolerance toward democrats and communists in a libertarian social order. They will have to be physically separated and expelled from society. Likewise, in a covenant founded for the purpose of protecting family and kin, there can be no tolerance toward those habitually promoting lifestyles incompatible with this goal. They – the advocates of alternative, non-family and kin-centered lifestyles such as, for instance, individual hedonism, parasitism, nature-environment worship, homosexuality, or communism – will have to be physically removed from society, too, if one is to maintain a libertarian order.&lt;ref name="pp. 216–218"&gt;Hoppe, ''Democracy: The God That Failed'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=qARC56X5vxcC&amp;pg=PA216e pp. 216–218]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Commenting on this passage, Martin Snyder of the [[American Association of University Professors]] said Hoppe's words will disturb "[t]hose with a better memory than Hoppe for segregation, apartheid, internment facilities and concentration camps, for yellow stars and pink triangles".&lt;ref name="Snyder"/&gt; Hoppe also provoked controversy by calling homosexuality a "perversity or abnormality", alongside vulgarity, drug use, deviant sexual behaviours and pedophilia.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Hermann Hoppe, ''Democracy: The God That Failed: The Economics and Politics of Monarchy, Democracy and Natural Order'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=qARC56X5vxcC&amp;pg=PA206 p. 206].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter Block]] wrote that Hoppe's statement calling for advocates of homosexuality "to be physically removed from society" was "exceedingly difficult to reconcile ... with libertarianism" because "the libertarian philosophy would support the rights of both groups to act in such manners". He continues: "As for homosexuality, it is entirely possible that some areas of the country, parts of Gotham and San Francisco for example, will require this practice, and ban, entirely, heterosexuality. If this is done through contract, private property rights, restrictive covenants, it will be entirely compatible with the libertarian legal code."&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Block]] ([[Loyola University New Orleans]]), [https://mises.org/journals/scholar/block15.pdf "Libertarianism is unique; it belongs neither to the right nor the left: a critique of the views of Long, Holcombe, and Baden on the left, Hoppe, Feser and Paul on the right"], undated, published at [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] website, pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Support for immigration restrictions and critiques ==
As a self-proclaimed anarchist who favors abolishing the nation-state, Hoppe believes that as long as states exist, they should impose some restrictions on immigration. Hoppe has equated free immigration to "forced integration" which violates the rights of native peoples, since if land were privately owned, immigration would not be unhindered but would only occur with the consent of private property owners.&lt;ref name="migrations"&gt;Hans Hoppe, [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig/hermann-hoppe1.html On Free Immigration and Forced Integration], [[LewRockwell.com]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Hoppe's Mises Institute colleague [[Walter Block]] has characterized Hoppe as an "anti-open immigration activist" who argues that, though all public property is "stolen" by the state from taxpayers, "the state compounds the injustice when it allows immigrants to use [public] property, thus further "invading" the private property rights of the original owners".&lt;ref name="mises2"&gt;Anthony Gregory and Walter Block On [https://mises.org/journals/jls/21_3/21_3_2.pdf Immigration: Reply to Hoppe], [[Journal of Libertarian Studies]], Volume 21, No. 3, Fall 2007, pp. 25–42.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Block rejects Hoppe's views as incompatible with libertarianism. Employing a [[reductio ad absurdum]] argument, he argues that Hoppe's logic implies that flagrantly unlibertarian laws such as regulations on prostitution and drug use "could be defended on the basis that many tax-paying property owners would not want such behavior on their own private property".&lt;ref name="BlockLaborEcon"&gt;{{cite book |last=Block |first1=Walter |title=Labor Economics From A Free Market Perspective: Employing The Unemployable |page=225 |deadurl=no |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_mXICgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA225&amp;lpg=PA225 |accessdate=2018-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another libertarian author, Simon Guenzl, writing for ''Libertarian Papers'' argues that: "supporting a legitimate role for the state as an immigration gatekeeper is inconsistent with Rothbardian and Hoppean libertarian anarchism, as well as with the associated strategy of advocating always and in every instance reductions in the state's role in society."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guenzl|first=Simon|date=June 23, 2016|title=Public Property and the Libertarian Immigration Debate|journal=Libertarian Papers|volume= 8|quote=I conclude that supporting a legitimate role for the state as an immigration gatekeeper is inconsistent with Rothbardian and Hoppean libertarian anarchism, as well as with the associated strategy of advocating always and in every instance reductions in the state's role in society.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of specific immigration restrictions, Hoppe argued that an appropriate policy will require immigrants to the United States to display proficiency in English in addition to "superior (above-average) intellectual performance and character structure as well as a compatible system of values".&lt;ref&gt;Walter Block and Gene Callahan, [http://www.walterblock.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/block-callahan_right-immigrate-2003.pdf Is There a Right to Immigration?: A Libertarian Perspective], [[Human Rights Review]], October–December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that these criteria would lead to a "systematic pro-European immigration bias". Jacob Hornberger of the ''Future of Freedom Foundation'' opined that the immigration test Hoppe advocated would probably be prejudiced against Latin American immigrants to the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Hornberger, [http://fff.org/explore-freedom/article/lets-stick-traditional-american-values/ Let’s Stick with Traditional American Values!], The Future of Freedom Foundation, February 1, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; due to differences between European Americans and Latin Americans [[Race and intelligence|differences in average IQs]]. Hoppe has stated, "No one is against immigration and immigrants per se. But immigration must be by invitation only. All immigrants must be productive people and hence, be barred from all domestic welfare payments."&lt;ref name="Libertarianism and the Alt-right"/&gt;

==Iraq War and foreign policy views==
Hoppe spoke out against invading Iraq (which later happened in [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003]]) in a 2002 interview and criticized the [[interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] foreign policy, stating that "if you meddle in foreign affairs, you should not be surprised if besides some friends you will also make plenty of enemies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quebecoislibre.org/021207-8.htm|title=HANS-HERMANN HOPPE ON WAR, TERRORISM, AND THE WORLD STATE|first=Marc|last=Grunert|date=|website=www.QuebecoisLibre.org|access-date=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a March 4, 2004, lecture on [[time preference]] at the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] (UNLV), a student complained that Hoppe created a hostile classroom environment by stating that  homosexuals tend to be more shortsighted than heterosexuals in their ability to save money and plan (economically) for the future, in part because they tend not to have children.&lt;ref name="Snyder_a"&gt;{{Cite news | issn = 0190-2946 | volume = 91 | issue = 2 | pages = 127 | last = Snyder | first = Martin | title = Birds of a Feather? | work = Academe | quote=So what ignited the controversy in Nevada? In March 2004, a student formally accused Hoppe of creating a hostile classroom environment during a lecture on time preference, a notion in economics identifying individuals' varying degrees of willingness to defer the immediate consumption of goods in favor of saving and investment. Hoppe opined that certain demographic groups, for instance homosexuals, tend to be more shortsighted in their economic outlook than those who have children.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoppe also suggested that [[John Maynard Keynes]]'s homosexuality might explain his economic views, with which Hoppe disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | issn = 0190-2946 | volume = 91 | issue = 2 | pages = 127 | last = Snyder | first = Martin | title = Birds of a Feather? | work = Academe | quote=He also suggested that the economic theories of John Maynard Keynes might be explained by Keynes's reputed homosexuality.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoppe also stated that very young and very old people, and couples without children, were less likely to plan for the future. Hoppe told a reporter that the comments lasted only 90 seconds of a 75-minute class, no students questioned the comments in that class, and that in 18 years of giving the same lecture all over the world, he had never previously received a complaint about it. At the request of university officials, Hoppe apologized to the class. He said, "Italians tend to eat more spaghetti than Germans, and Germans tend to eat more sauerkraut than Italians" and explained that he was speaking in generalities. Thereafter, Hoppe told the reporter, the student alleged that Hoppe did not take the complaint seriously and filed a formal complaint. Hoppe told the reporter that he felt as if it were he who was the victim in the incident and that the student should have been told to "grow up".&lt;ref name=Lake&gt;Richard Lake, {{cite web |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Feb-05-Sat-2005/news/25808494.html |title=UNLV accused of limiting free speech |accessdate=2013-05-15 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050209040615/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Feb-05-Sat-2005/news/25808494.html |archivedate=February 9, 2005 |df= }} [[Las Vegas Review-Journal]], February 05, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigation was conducted and the university's provost, [[Raymond W. Alden III]], issued Hoppe a non-disciplinary letter of instruction on February 9, 2005, with a finding that he had "created a hostile or intimidating educational environment in violation of the University's policies regarding discrimination as to sexual orientation". Alden also instructed Hoppe to "... cease mischaracterizing opinion as objective fact", asserted that Hoppe's opinion was not supported by peer-reviewed academic literature, and remarked that Hoppe had "refus[ed] to substantiate [his] in-class statements of fact ..."&lt;ref name="alden2005"&gt;{{cite web|last=Alden, III|first=Raymond W.|title=Findings and non-disciplinary letter of instruction|url=https://www.mises.org/pdf/hoppeletter.pdf|authorlink=Raymond W. Alden III|date=February 9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoppe appealed the decision, saying the university had "blatantly violated its contractual obligations" toward him and described the action as "frivolous interference with my right to academic freedom".&lt;ref&gt;Justin Chomintra, ''[http://archive.mises.org/3137/the-thought-police-and-hoppe/ Professor, ACLU may sue UNLV] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903112107/http://archive.mises.org/3137/the-thought-police-and-hoppe/ |date=2013-09-03 }}'', ''The Rebel Yell'', February 10, 2005; reprinted by [[Stephen Kinsella]] at Mises.org, February 10, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; He was represented by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]. The ACLU threatened legal action.&lt;ref name=LVSFeb8&gt;{{cite news|title=Efforts to punish UNLV professor gains exposure|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2005/feb/08/effort-to-punish-unlv-professor-gains-exposure/#axzz2UBIVranP|accessdate=May 23, 2013|newspaper=[[Las Vegas Sun]]|date=February 8, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACLU attorney Allen Lichtenstein said "The charge against professor Hoppe is totally specious and without merit".&lt;ref name=Lake/&gt; The Nevada ACLU executive director said "We don't subscribe to Hans' theories and certainly understand why some students find them offensive ... But academic freedom means nothing if it doesn't protect the right of professors to present scholarly ideas that are relevant to their curricula, even if they are controversial and rub people the wrong way".&lt;ref name=Lake/&gt; Alden's decision was picked up by [[Fox News]] and several blogs and libertarians organized a campaign to contact the university.&lt;ref name=LVSFeb8/&gt; The university received two weeks of bad publicity and the Interim Chancellor ([[Nevada System of Higher Education]]) [[James E. Rogers|Jim Rogers]] expressed concerns about "any attempts to thwart free speech".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Exoneration sought for UNLV professor |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2005/feb/21/exoneration-sought-for-unlv-professor/#axzz2UBIVranP|accessdate=May 23, 2013|newspaper=[[Las Vegas Sun]]|date=February 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jim Rogers intervened in the matter. He rejected Hoppe's request for a one-year paid sabbatical,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rogers nixes Hoppe sabbatical|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2005/feb/23/rogers-nixes-hoppe-sabbatical/#axzz2UBIVranP|accessdate=May 23, 2013|newspaper=[[Las Vegas Sun]]|date=February 23, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and UNLV President [[Carol Harter]] acted upon Hoppe's appeal on February 18, 2005. She decided that Hoppe's views, even if non-mainstream or controversial, should not be cause for reprimanding him. She dismissed the discrimination complaint against Hoppe and the non-disciplinary letter was withdrawn from Hoppe's personnel file.&lt;ref name="Snyder"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Snyder|first=Martin D.|title=Birds of a Feather?|journal=Academe|date=March 1, 2005|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-829841891.html|access-date=April 17, 2013 |publisher=American Association of University Professors}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote:

{{quote|UNLV, in accordance with policy adopted by the Board of Regents, understands that the freedom afforded to Professor Hoppe and to all members of the academic community carries a significant corresponding academic responsibility. In the balance between freedoms and responsibilities, and where there may be ambiguity between the two, academic freedom must, in the end, be foremost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement of Dr. Carol Harter, President of UNLV, regarding Professor Hans-Hermann Hoppe|url=https://www.mises.org/pdf/harterstatement.pdf|author=Carol Harter|authorlink=Carol Harter|date=February 18, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hoppe later wrote about the incident and the UNLV investigation in an article entitled "My Battle With the Thought Police".&lt;ref name=ThoughtPolice&gt;Hans-Hermann Hoppe, [https://mises.org/daily/1792 "My Battle With the Thought Police"], [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] web site, April 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Snyder of the [[American Association of University Professors]] wrote that he should not be "punished for freely expressing his opinions".&lt;ref name="Snyder"/&gt;

Various controversies about [[academic freedom]], including the Hoppe matter and remarks made by Harvard University President [[Lawrence Summers]], prompted the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, to hold a conference on academic freedom in October 2005.&lt;ref&gt;The role of [[Tenure (academic)|academic tenure]] was included during the conference. {{cite news|title=Teachers' tenure on front burner|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2005/oct/13/teachers-tenure-on-front-burner/#axzz2UBIVranP|accessdate=May 23, 2013|newspaper=[[Las Vegas Sun]]|date=October 13, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 UNLV proposed a new policy that included the encouragement of reporting by people who felt that they had encountered bias.&lt;ref name="Hsu"&gt;The proposed policy defined "bias incidents" as "'verbal, written, or physical acts of intimidation, coercion, interference, frivolous claims, discrimination, and sexual or other harassment motivated, in whole or in part, by bias" based on characteristics including actual or perceived race, religion, sex (including gender identity or gender expression or a pregnancy-related condition), physical appearance and political affiliation.' {{cite news|last=Hsu|first=Charlotte|title=ACLU airs free speech concerns on bias policy: Faculty express concern; UNLV official says proposal would encourage expression|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/apr/25/aclu-airs-free-speech-concerns-bias-policy/#axzz2UBIVranP|accessdate=May 23, 2013|newspaper=[[Las Vegas Sun]]|date=April 25, 2009 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed policy was criticized by the Nevada ACLU and some faculty members who remembered the Hoppe incident as adverse to academic freedom.&lt;ref name="Hsu" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.lasvegassun.com/media/pdfs/blogs/documents/2009/04/24/unlv_bias_policy.pdf Policy on Bias Incidents and Hate Crimes (Final draft)], [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]], Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs, Department of Police Services, Office of the Vice President for Diversity and Inclusion Policy on Bias Incidents and Hate Crimes.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hjalmar Magnus Eklund''' (12 January 1880 in [[Turku]] – 10 June 1937 in [[Pargas]]) was the first Finnish expert in mathematical logic and philosophy and also a pioneer in the [[Ido language]].

==Life and career==
Eklund was born in Turku in 1880, the son of a sea captain.&lt;ref name="Elfving1981"&gt;{{cite book|last=Elfving|first=Gustav|title=The history of mathematics in Finland, 1828–1918|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lpw9AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=15 July 2012|year=1981|publisher=Societas Scientiarum Fennica|isbn=978-951-653-098-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was very talented in many areas. He studied mathematics, physics and philosophy at the [[University of Helsinki]], and graduated MA in 1903.&lt;ref name="Elfving1981"/&gt; He focused on set theory, and became the first Finnish expert in logic, which was then a new area. In 1906, he worked at the linguistic department of the university where he became interested in languages.

From 1906 to 1918, Eklund worked as a teacher in different high schools in [[Turku]] and [[Pori]]. Around the same time he continued his studies and graduated with a master's degree in philosophy in 1911. He also studied in Germany in 1909 and 1910 in [[Göttingen]], mathematics, philosophy in Leipzig in 1913 and 1914 again philosophy in Göttingen.&lt;ref name="Elfving1981"/&gt;  His most important works of that time were “Russells antimoni och andra paradoxala motsägelser. Logiska undersökningar” (1916), and “Über Mengen, die Elemente ihrer selbst sind” (1918).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Hjalmar Magnus Eklund | title=Über Mengen, die Elemente ihrer selbst sind | journal=Nyt Tidsskrift for Matematik, Avd. B | volume=29 | pages=8&amp;mdash;28 | year=1918 | JSTOR=24533478 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immanuel Kant]]'s philosophy in ethical thinking was a major influence on Eklund. The members of the [[Vienna Circle]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Moritz Schlick]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s philosophy was familiar to him. Hjalmar Eklund was an atheist. He wrote critically but objectively in anti-religious articles. In 1906, he was involved in founding the Student Association Prometheusta and later became  a member of the Committee of statehood, freedom of religion.

In addition, Hjalmar Eklund was a socialist and a journalist. In the 1918 [[Finnish Civil War]], Eklund was imprisoned for participation in the rebellion, but he was released in November 1918.&lt;ref name="Elfving1981"/&gt;  In 1919, Eklund became a Democrat in Turku, later a Socialist. There he wrote several articles on artificial languages including Ido.

Later in 1919, Eklund formed the [[Finnish Workers' Educational Association]] (STL), and became its secretary.  In 1926 he returned to Helsinki and worked for an insurance company until 1933. Hjalmar Eklund died in 1937 in [[Pargas]], only 57 years old.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1814">'''Humanitarian-political''' is an ideology that advocates a political standpoint based on a [[humanitarian]] perspective. The standpoint that come out of this ideology is constructed upon the conviction that every human being must have the right to;

*[[freedom of speech]]
*[[freedom of press]]
*[[freedom of assembly]]
*[[freedom to information]]
*[[freedom to demonstrate]]
*[[freedom of establishing organisations]] and
*[[freedom of religion]].

The core of the humanitarian-political point of view is that these liberties are fundamental necessities in order for people to be able to influence political decisions and to shape their society and destiny.

There are many [[humanitarian organisation]]s all over the world that advocate these liberties and in their work strive for a world where they can be implemented. However none of them make any rigorous standpoints in the political arena as they concentrate their efforts on basic humanitarian issues. A humanitarian-political organisation on the other hand does sufficient work in both fields and puts these together in order to make as big a difference as possible.

'''Organisations'''

The first [[organisation]] that introduced the concept of humanitarian-policy was Initiative for democracy in Iran ([[Initiative iran]]), a [[non-profit organisation]] that was established in [[Stockholm]] [[Sweden]] in September 2006. Initiative-Iran can thus be considered as the pioneers to hold a humanitarian-political point of view as a foundation of an organisation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5795">[[File:IbnTumlus.JPG|thumb|right|Sculpture of Ibn Ṭumlūs in Alcira]]

'''Ibn Ṭumlūs''' (1164-1223) was a [[Valencia]]n scholar whose interests ranged over medicine, philosophy, grammar and poetry. Today he is mainly known today for his work in logic. Ibn Ṭumlūs is known by his biographers under the name of '''Abū al-Ḥajjāj''' or '''Abū Isḥāq Yūsuf ibn Muhammed ibn Ṭumlūs'''. In Latin sources, he is known as '''Alhagiag Bin Thalmus'''. 

==Biography==
He was born in [[Alzira, Valencia|Alzira]], near [[Valencia]], sometime between 1150 and 1165. He studied philosophy, medicine and perhaps jurisprudence with [[Averroes]] (Ibn Rushd), and his achievements in medicine were such that he succeeded Averroes as doctor of the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohad]] caliph, [[Muhammad al-Nasir|Mohammad al-Nāṣir]], from 1199 to 1213. He died at Alcira in 1223.&lt;ref name="EI2BEL"&gt;{{EI2|volume=3|page=960|title=Ibn Ṭumlūs|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/ibn-tumlus-SIM_3396|last=Vernet|first=J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Work==
Not one of the works of Ibn Ṭumlūs known of today is mentioned by his biographers. Conversely, not one of the works mentioned by his biographers is available today. Ibn Abbar stated that Ibn Ṭumlūs authored some works on the sciences of the Arabic language, but these do not seem to be extant. In addition, Ibn Ṭumlūs’s biographers transmitted to us some poems made by him, which have been transcribed in Fouad Ben Ahmed's definitive biobibliography.&lt;ref&gt;Fouad Ben Ahmed, ''Ibn Ṭumlūs (620 H/ 1223): Sīrat Biblyographiyya'' (Beirut: Manšurāt Ḍifāf, 2017) [in Arabic, with English summary]&lt;/ref&gt; There are only two major works that are known to have survived, his ''Book on Logic'' and his commentary on Avicenna's ''Medical Poem.''

===''Book on Logic''===
Ṭumlūs’ ''Book on Logic'' (''Kitāb fī Mantiq'') survives in just a single manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;MS Escorial, árabe 649 , fol. 1 v-172r&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript is undated and untitled. Some scholars have proposed dates, but these remain speculative. Although parts of the treatise have been edited under the title ''Introduction to the Art of Logic,'' in fact neither Ibn Ṭumlūs nor his copyist gave a title to the work. The text covers all the parts of Aristotle's [[Organon]], including a Book of Rhetoric and Book of Poetics. Indeed, his advocacy of this expanded Organon is one the significant features of the work. The treatise begins with a long introduction (''Ṣadr'') to the text in which Ibn Ṭumlūs addresses several controversies concerning his education in logic and the attitudes of the scholars of his time towards logic (namely, the jurists and the students of the prophetic tradition). He considers also the value of [[al-Ghazali|al-Ghazālī]]’s and [[al-Farabi|al-Fārābī]]’s logical works, both from a philosophical and a religious point of view. Yet although both of these figures are influential on Ibn Ṭumlūs, recent scholarship has shown that his principal influence is his teacher, Averroes.&lt;ref name="ben Ahmed" /&gt;

Excerpts from the ''Book on Logic'' have been edited and translated by various scholars:
* part of the introduction into French&lt;ref&gt;Miguel Asín Palacios, "La logique d’Ibn Toumlous d’Alcira," ''Revue Tunisienne'' (1908) 474–79&lt;/ref&gt;
* the introduction and first three sections into Spanish&lt;ref&gt;''Introducción al arte de la lógica por Abentomlús de Alcira,'' texto árabe y trad. española por Miguel Asín Palacios (Madrid: Centro de Estudios Históricos, 1916)&lt;/ref&gt;
* excerpts from the section on poetics into French&lt;ref&gt;Maroun Aouad, "Le syllogisme poétique selon le Livre de la poétique d’Ibn Ṭumlūs," in R. Arnzen and J. Thielmann (eds.), ''Words, Texts and Concepts Cruising the Mediterranean Sea'' (Leuven: Peeters, 2004) 259-270&lt;/ref&gt;
* the section on rhetoric into French&lt;ref&gt;''Le Livre de la Rhétorique du philosophe et du médecin Ibn Ṭumlūs (Alhagiag bin Thalmus),'' Introduction générale, édition critique du texte arabe, traduction française et tables par M. Aouad (Paris: Vrin, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
A critical Arabic edition of the sections on dialectic and sophistical topics has recently been made by Fouad Ben Ahmed,&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Ṭumlūs, ''Kitāb fī Mantiq (Treatise on Logic), Kitāb al-Ǧadal (Book of Dialectic), and Kitāb al-Amkina al-Muġalliṭa (Book of Sophistical Topics),'' ed. Fouad Ben Ahmed (Difaf Publishing, 2016) [in Arabic, with English introduction] http://www.neelwafurat.com/itempage.aspx?id=lbb258184-241120&amp;search=books&lt;/ref&gt; who is at work on an Arabic edition of the remainder of the work. At present, no English translations are available.

===''Commentary on Avicenna's Medical Poem''===

Ibn Ṭumlūs' other major surviving work is his commentary on [[Avicenna]]'s ''Medical Poem'' (''Šarḥ al-Urǧūza''). Although there are eight known manuscripts containing this work, with more probably yet to be identified, no complete edition of the work has been made. A colophon at the end of one manuscript dates Ibn Ṭumlūs' final revisions of the work to [[Marrakesh]] in 1209.&lt;ref name="ben Ahmed"&gt;Fouad Ben Ahmed, ''Ibn Ṭumlūs''&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarship on this work is, at this point, extremely limited.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmud Aroua, "Réflexions sur le commentaire au poème de la médecine d’Ibn Sīnā par Ibn Ṭumlūs," in A. Hasnawi (ed.), ''Sciences et philosophies arabes: méthodes, problèmes et cas'' (Carthago, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ikshana''' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''īkṣaṇa'') is a noun which means sight, care and superintendence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=Theodor Benfey|publisher=Asian Educational Services|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JYoxtJZvg4EC&amp;pg=PA233&amp;dq=Ikshana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bBzjUta3MtOO7Qago4H4Dw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Ikshana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also refers to eye, sight, look, seeing, viewing, aspect, caring for, looking after, regarding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url= http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+Ikshana&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', [[Brahma]] is said to have become the Ikshana (eye), in the form of this mobile and immobile universe, of all entities that took birth; in the phrase ''Vrishbhekshana'', ''Virishbha'' implies the ''[[Vedas]]'' and ikshana, the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa|publisher=Bharata Press|pages=228, 277|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YbZZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Ikshana&amp;dq=Ikshana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uR3jUtPnE4zB7Ab0hYHIDw&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kalidasa]], in the phrase मदिरेक्षणे appearing in passage II.72 of his [[Shakuntala|Abhigyanashakuntalam]], has also used the word Ikshana to mean the eye, which phrase Sankara explains is – ''madira'' ('wine') as applied to the eye (ikshana), - eye as equivalent to 'beautiful', ''madirekhshane'' means the one whose eyes intoxicate like wine or is the wine-eyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sakuntala|author=Kalidasa|pages=123–124|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zXk-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=Ikshana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nhvjUoD9IYnR7Ab8i4GwDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Ikshana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ikshana is a technical term used in [[Vedanta]] to show how creation took place by the beholding of Para-brahman as an intelligent and a personal act of the creator; it means revelation of the created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Hindu-catholic|publisher=Asian Trading Corporation|page=183|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E7lPAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Ikshana+vedanta&amp;dq=Ikshana+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jyDjUouKDcnR7Aa80YG4Dg&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parabrahman is essentially ''citta'' who produces his self as [[Shabda Brahman]] (Logos) by ''ikshana'' ('beholding').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gregorianum Vol.87 Issue 4|author=Bryon Lobo|publisher=Gregorian Biblical Bookshop|page=17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qL4iy-iOCm4C&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=Ikshana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Am3jUpiCIsKv7Ab-8IHQAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Ikshana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Badarayana]] states:-

:इक्षतिकर्मव्यपदेशात् सः| ([[Brahma Sutras|Brahma Sutra]]) I.iii.13

:"From the mention as the object of the act of seeing, it follows that the supreme Self is meant."

[[Adi Shankara]], in his commentary on this ''sutra'', states that the object of ''ikshana'' ('seeing') is the supreme Self, [[Brahman]], and not [[Hiranyagarbha]], the inferior Brahman. He says that the term ''ikshati-karma'' means the object covered by the act of seeing. The all-pervading entity (Purusa) that is to be seen can be seen to be "higher than the high one" meditated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brahma Sutra Bhasya of Sankaracarya|author=Swami Gambhirananda|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=177–180|url= https://www.amazon.com/Brahma-Sutra-Bhasya-Sankaracarya/dp/8175051051 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pippalada]] tells Satyakama, son of Sibi, that he by the ''Sama'' hymns is elevated to the ''Brahmaloka'', he from this ''jivanghata'' ('the Macrocosmic Soul') beholds the supreme Being – एतस्माज्जीवघ्नात्परात्परं पुरिशयं पुरुषुमीक्षति - [[Prashna Upanishad]] V.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Prasna Upanishad|publisher=The Ramakrishna Math|page=63|url=http://www.estudantedavedanta.net/Prashna%20Upanishad%20-%20Swami%20Sarvanand%20[Sanskrit-English].pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statement – ''uho nama vi-tarkoktih pra-vicharekshanatmakah'', the terms ''Vitarka'' and ''Tarka'' are used interchangeably, ''tarka'' occurs after speech, mind and prana have been restrained immediately before Samadhi, vitarka consists of advanced thought and observation (ikshana); it is through discernment (''uha'') that one leaves the lower plane of ''savikalpa'' and gets uplifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yoga-sutras of Patanjali|author=Patanjali|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=663–665|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2G3KR32j-T4C&amp;pg=PA664&amp;dq=Ikshana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bBzjUta3MtOO7Qago4H4Dw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Ikshana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vedic concept of [[tapas]] and the Upanishadic concept of ikshana to the effect that consciousness and force are ultimately the same and every will has an aspect of force, helped [[Aurobindo|Sri Aurobindo]] to conclude that the fact is only a partial reflection of the Idea which has created it and that it is the idea which expresses itself in matter and takes to itself bodies, and formulate the 'Theory of ideas as forces'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Political Philosophy of Aurobindo|author=V.P.Verma|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=106–108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bLrp0c0hizAC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=Ikshana+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jyDjUouKDcnR7Aa80YG4Dg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Ikshana%20vedanta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was through ''ekacittekshana-samyukta-prajna'' the supreme perfect knowledge was realized (''abhisambodha'') by [[Gautama Buddha]], that converted ''Boddhisattva'' to ''Buddha''; ''ekacittekshana'' refers to ''[[Prajna (Vedic)|Prajna]]'' exercised in unison with 'one-thought-viewing' when there is no separation between 'knower' and the 'known', all are viewed in one thought and enlightenment is the outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Essays in Zen Buddhism|author=Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki|publisher=Grove Press|pages=124–125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o2d7wV4Ttx4C&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=Ikshana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uR3jUtPnE4zB7Ab0hYHIDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Ikshana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ackrill has been said to be, along with [[Gregory Vlastos]] and [[G. E. L. Owen]], "one of the most important figures responsible for the upsurge of interest in ancient Greek philosophy among Anglo-American philosophers of the second half of this century".&lt;ref&gt;Owen Goldin [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/1998/98.4.01.html „J.

In 1940 he entered John's College, Oxford, as a scholar in Classics&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/professor-john-ackrill-oxford-professor-of-the-history-of-philosophy-who-was-a-leader-in-the-study-765718.html|title=Professor John Ackrill: Oxford Professor of the History of Philosophy|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; where his philosophy tutors were [[Paul Grice]] and John Mabbott&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.The next year he left for war service in the [[Royal Berkshire Regiment]] and General Staff, reaching the rank of captain. He returned to Oxford in 1945 to read ''[[Literae humaniores|Literae Humaniore]]'', graduating in 1948. He then accepted a teaching position as assistant lecturer in Logic at [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]] before being appointed university lecturer at Oxford in Ancient Philosophy in 1949.  Granted two years of study-leave, Ackrill was a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in 1950-51 (as he was again in 1961-62)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/ Institute for Advanced Study: A Community of Scholars]&lt;/ref&gt; before becoming, in 1953, a tutorial fellow at Brasenose College. In 1966, Oxford university created a statutory chair in the History of Philosophy, to which Ackrill was elected as the first holder. He retained that Chair, whilst remaining a fellow of Brasenose, until he retired in 1989 as an Emeritus Professor. In 1981 he was elected a Fellow of the British Academy and, in 1996, an Honorary Fellow of St John's.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''John Cowper Powys''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|uː|p|ər|_|ˈ|p|oʊ|ɪ|s}}; 8 October 1872{{spaced ndash}}17 June 1963) was a British philosopher, lecturer, novelist, literary critic, and poet. Powys was born in [[Shirley, Derbyshire]], where his father was vicar of St. Michael and All Angels Parish Church, between 1871 and 1879.&lt;ref&gt;Peak District online [http://www.peakdistrictonline.co.uk/the-derbyshire-powys-a-forgotten-literary-family-c2610.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although Powys published a collection of poems in 1896 and his first novel in 1915, he did not gain success as a writer until he published the novel ''[[Wolf Solent]]'' in 1929. He was influenced by many writers, but he has been particularly seen as a successor to [[Thomas Hardy]], and ''[[Wolf Solent]]'', ''[[A Glastonbury Romance]]'' (1932), along with ''[[Weymouth Sands]]'' (1934) and ''[[Maiden Castle (novel)|Maiden Castle]]'' (1936), are often referred to as his [[Thomas Hardy's Wessex|Wessex]] novels. As with Hardy's novels, the [[landscape]] plays a major role in Powys's works, and an elemental philosophy is important in the lives of his characters. In 1934 he published his important ''[[John Cowper Powys's Autobiography|Autobiography]]''. 

Powys was also a highly successful itinerant lecturer, first in England and then from 1905 until 1930 in the USA.  Many of Powys's novels were written in America and his early novels, and all his major novels, up to and including ''Owen Glendower'', as well as ''Autobiography,'' were first published in the United States

Powys moved to [[Dorset]], England, from America, in 1934 with his American partner Phyllis Playter, but in 1935 they moved to [[Corwen]] in [[Merionethshire]], Wales. This led to the publication of two [[historical novels]] set in Wales ''[[Owen Glendower (novel)|Owen Glendower]]'' (1941) and ''[[Porius: A Romance of the Dark Ages|Porius]]'' (1951). Then in 1955 they moved to [[Blaenau Ffestiniog]] where Powys died in 1963.

==Biography==

===Early life===
[[File:Montacute.jpg|thumb|left|[[Montacute]]: Powys' father, the Reverend Charles Francis Powys (1843–1923) was the vicar between 1885 and 1918]]
Powys was born in [[Shirley, Derbyshire]], in 1872, the son of the Reverend Charles Francis Powys (1843–1923), and Mary Cowper Johnson, a descendant of the poet [[William Cowper]].&lt;ref&gt;John Cowper Powys, ''Autobiography'' (1934). London: Macdonald, 1967. The most up-to-date biographical information is found in Morine Krissdottir's, ''Descents of Memory: The Life of John Cowper Powys''. New York: Overlook Duckworth, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He came from a family of eleven children, many of whom were also talented. The family lived in Shirley between 1871-79, briefly in Dorchester, Dorset and then they moved to [[Montacute]], Somerset, where Charles Powys was vicar for thirty-two years. 

John Cowper Powys's two younger brothers [[Llewelyn Powys]] (1884–1939) and [[Theodore Francis Powys]] were well-known writers, while his sister [[Philippa Powys|Philippa]] published a novel and some poetry. Another sister Marian Powys was an authority on lace and lace-making and published a book on this subject.&lt;ref&gt;''Lace and Lace-Making''. Boston: Mass., Ch. Branford, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; His brother A. R. Powys was Secretary of the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]], and published a number of books on architectural subjects.&lt;ref&gt;London: J. M. Dent &amp; Sons Ltd., 1929; From ''The Ground Up Collected Papers Of A. R. Powys by A.R. Powy''. London: Dent, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; Powys studied at [[Sherborne School]] and graduated from [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], June 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=PWS891JC|name=Powys, John Cowper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 April 1896 he married Margaret Lyon. They had a son, Littleton Alfred, in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Williams, ''John Cowper Powys''. Bridgend, Wales: Seren,1997, pp. 36, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Powys's first employment was teaching in girls’ schools in [[Brighton]], and then [[Eastbourne]].&lt;ref&gt;''Autobiography'' (1967), pp. 210, 244&lt;/ref&gt; His first published works were two highly derivative collections of poetry published in the 1890s. He worked from 1898 as an Extension lecturer throughout England, for both Oxford and Cambridge Universities.&lt;ref name="Kenneth Hopkins 1964, p.13"&gt;Kenneth Hopkins, ''John Cowper Powys: A Selection from his Poems''. Hamilton, NY: Colgate University Press, 1964, p. 13. ''Autobiography'' (1967), p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lecturer in America===
Then from 1905 to the early 1930s, he lectured in the United States for the American Society for the Extension of University Teaching, gaining a reputation as a charismatic speaker.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Williams, ''John Cowper Powys'', pp. 52–3.&lt;/ref&gt; He spent his summers in England. During this time he travelled the length and breadth of the US, as well as into Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Williams, p. 55, Robin Paterson, "Powys in Canada: John Cowper Powys's Canadian Lectures". ''Powys Notes'' (1994/95, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Powys's marriage was unsatisfactory, and Powys eventually lived a large part of each year in the USA, and had relationships with various women.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Williams, pp. 77, 70.&lt;/ref&gt; An important woman in his life was the American poet Frances Gregg, whom he first met in [[Philadelphia]] in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powys-lannion.net/Powys/America/Gregg.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a friend of the famous dancer [[Isadora Duncan]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Williams, ''John Cowper Powys'', pp. 83–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Another friend and an important supporter in America was the novelist [[Theodore Dreiser]].&lt;ref&gt;''Autobiography'' (1967), pp. 528, 550–5.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921 he met Phyllis Playter, the twenty-six-year-old daughter of industrialist and business man Franklin Playter.&lt;ref&gt;Morine Krissdottir's, ''Descents of Memory'', pp. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually they established a permanent relationship, though he was unable to divorce his wife Margaret, who was a Catholic. However, he diligently supported Margaret and the education of their son.&lt;ref&gt;Morine Krissdottir, ''Descents of Memory'', pp. 72, 86–90, 170, 298.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US he engaged in a public debate with the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] on marriage, and he also debated with the philosopher and historian [[Will Durant]].&lt;ref&gt;''Autobiography'' (1967), p. 535.&lt;/ref&gt; Powys was also a witness in the obscenity trial of [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Morine Krissdottir's, ''Descents of Memory'', pp. 235–6; p. 212; p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; and was mentioned with approval in the autobiography of US feminist and anarchist, [[Emma Goldman]]. Powys would later share Goldman's support for the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;''Vision on fire: Emma Goldman on the Spanish Revolution'' edited by David Porter, AK Press, 2006, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Patchin Place through gate.jpg|thumb|right|375px|[[Patchin Place]] New York (2011) where Powys lived in [[Greenwich Village]].]]
His first novel ''Wood and Stone'', which Powys dedicated to [[Thomas Hardy]], was published in 1915. This was followed by two collections of literary essays ''Visions and Revisions'' (1915) and ''Suspended Judgment'' (1916). In ''Confessions of Two Brothers'' (1916), a work that also contains a section by his brother Llewelyn, Powys writes about his personal philosophy, something he elaborated on in ''The Complex Vision'' (1920), his first full length work of popular philosophy. He also published three collections of poetry between 1916 and 1922.

Politically, Powys described himself as an anarchist and was both [[anti-fascist]] and [[Anti-Stalinist left|anti-Stalinist]]: "Powys already regarded fascism and Stalinism as appalling, but different, totalitarian regimes".&lt;ref&gt;H. Gustav Klaus and Stephen Thomas Knight, ''To Hell with Culture: Anarchism and Twentieth-Century British Literature''. University of Wales Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0708318983}}. p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until 1929, with the novel ''[[Wolf Solent]]'', that Powys achieved any critical or financial success.&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Coates. ''John Cowper Powys in Search of a Landscape''. Totowa, NJ: Barnes and Nonle, 1982, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930 Powys and Phyllis moved from [[Greenwich Village]] in New York City to [[Hillsdale (town), New York|Hillsdale]] in rural [[New York (state)|upstate New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Williams, p.  97.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Powys's most admired novels, ''[[A Glastonbury Romance]]'', published in 1932, sold well, though he made little if any money from it because of a libel lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;Coates, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Another important work,  ''[[John Cowper Powys's Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', was published in 1934.

===Settling in Wales===
Then in June 1934 Powys and Phyllis left America and moved to England, living first in [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]], the setting for the final [[Wessex]] novel, ''[[Maiden Castle (novel)|Maiden Castle]]'', before eventually moving in July 1935 to [[Corwen]], [[Denbighshire]] [[North Wales]], with the help of the novelist [[James Hanley (novelist)|James Hanley]], who lived nearby.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Williams, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Corwen]] was historically part of Edeirnion or [[Edeirnion|Edeyrnion]] and an ancient [[commote]] of [[medieval Wales]], once a part of the '''[[Kingdom of Powys]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/Edeirnion,_Denbighshire Family Search: "Edeirnion, Denbighshire Genealogy"]&lt;/ref&gt; There Powys immersed himself in Welsh literature, mythology and culture, including learning to read Welsh.&lt;ref&gt;Krissdottir pp. 330–31.&lt;/ref&gt; The move inspired two major historical novels with Welsh settings, ''[[Owen Glendower (novel)|Owen Glendower]]'' (1941) and ''[[Porius (A Romance of the Dark Ages)|Porius]]'' (1951).

Margaret Powys died in 1947, and his son Littleton Alfred in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Morine Krissdottir's, ''Descents of Memory'', pp. 370, 407.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1955 they moved, for the last time, to [[Blaenau Ffestiniog]] in North Wales. John Cowper Powys died in 1963 and Phyllis Playter in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;See Powys's ''Autobiography'' (1967) and ''Descents of Memory'' by Morine Krissdottir.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Blaenau Ffestiniog.jpg|thumb|[[Blaenau Ffestiniog]], where Powys lived from 1955 until he died in 1963]]

==Works==

===Poetry===
Powys's first published works were poetry: ''Odes and Other Poems'' (1896), ''Poems'' (1899), collections which have "echoes […] of [[Tennyson]], [[Matthew Arnold|Arnold]], [[Swinburne]], among contemporaries, and of [[John Milton]] and [[Wordsworth]] and [[Keats]]". These were published with the assistance of his cousin Ralph Shirley, who was a director of William [[Rider (imprint)|Rider]] and Son the publisher of them.&lt;ref&gt;name=Kenneth Hopkins 1964, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1905 Powys composed "The Death of God" an epic poem "modelled on the blank verse of Milton, Keats, and Tennyson" that was published as ''Lucifer'' in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;''Autobiography'' (1967), p.  338. ''Lucifer'' was published by Macdonald.&lt;/ref&gt; There were three further volumes of poetry: ''Wolf's Bane'' (1916), ''Mandragora'' (1917) and ''Samphire'' (1922). The first two collections were published by Powys's manager G. Arnold Shaw. An unfinished, short narrative poem "The Ridge" was published in January 1963, shortly before Powys's death that June.&lt;ref&gt;''Review of English Literature'', vol. IV, no.1, pp. 53–58.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964 Kenneth Hopkins published ''John Cowper Powys: A Selection from his Poems'' and in 1979 the Welsh poet and critic [[Roland Mathias]] thought this side of Powys worthy of critical study and published ''The Hollowed-Out Elder Stalk: John Cowper Powys as Poet''.&lt;ref&gt;London: Enitharmon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Belinda Humfrey, suggests that "[p]erhaps Powys's best poems are those given to Jason Otter in ''Wolf Solent'' and Taliessin in ''Porius''."&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction" to ''Essays on John Cowper Powys'', ed. Belinda Humfrey. Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1972, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse]] (1973) edited by English poet [[Philip Larkin]] contains "In A Hotel Writing-Room" by Powys.

===Novels===

====Wessex novels====
While he was a famous lecturer and published a variety of both fiction and non-fiction regularly from 1915, it was not until he was in his early fifties, with the publication of ''Wolf Solent'' in 1929, that he achieved critical and financial success as a novelist.&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Coates, ''John Cowper Powys in Search of a Landscape''.  Totowa, NJ: Barnes and Noble, 1982, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; This novel was reprinted several times in both the United States and Britain and translated into German in 1930 and French in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Langridge,'' John Cowper Powys: A Record of Achievement''. London: The Library Association, 1966, pp. 115, 121&lt;/ref&gt; In the Preface he wrote for the 1961 Macdonald edition of the novel Powys states: "''Wolf Solent'' is a book of Nostalgia, written in a foreign country with the pen of a traveller and the ink-blood of his home".&lt;ref&gt;1964 Penguin edition, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wolf Solent'' is set in Ramsgard, based on [[Sherborne]], Dorset, where Powys attended school from May 1883, as well as Blacksod, modelled on [[Yeovil]], Somerset, and [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]] and [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]], both in Dorset, all places full of memories for him.&lt;ref&gt;Krissdottir, p. 37 re school.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year ''The Meaning of Culture'' was published and it, too, was frequently reprinted. ''In Defence of Sensuality'', published at the end of the following year, was yet another best seller.&lt;ref name=langridge/&gt; First published in 1933, ''A Philosophy of Solitude'' was another best seller for Powys in the USA.&lt;ref name=langridge&gt;Derek Langridge, ''John Cowper Powys: A Record of Achievement''&lt;/ref&gt;

Before ''Wolf Solent'' there had been four earlier apprentice novels; ''Wood and Stone'' (1915), ''Rodmoor'' (1916), the posthumous ''After my Fashion'' (1980), which was written around 1920, and ''Ducdame'' (1925).&lt;ref&gt;For ''After My Fahion'', see Krissdottir, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wolf Solent'' was the first of  the so-called Wessex novels, which include ''[[A Glastonbury Romance]]'' (1932), ''Weymouth Sands'' (1934) and ''Maiden Castle'' (1936).&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Powys was an admirer of Thomas Hardy, and these novels are set in Somerset and Dorset, part of Hardy's mythical Wessex.&lt;ref&gt;Powys's first novel ''Wood and Stone'' was dedicated to Thomas Hardy. It is set on the Dorset and Somerset border.&lt;/ref&gt; American scholar Richard Maxwell describes these four novels "as remarkably successful with the reading public of his time".&lt;ref&gt;"Two Canons: On the Meaning of Powys's Relation to Scott and his Turn to Historical Fiction", ''Western Humanities Review'', vol. LVII, no. 1, Spring 2003, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Maiden Castle'', the last of the Wessex novels, is set in [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]], Thomas Hardy's [[Casterbridge]], and which he intended to be a "rival" to Hardy's ''[[Mayor of Casterbridge]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Krissdottir, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

All the same, despite his indebtedness to the Victorian novel and his enthusiasm for Hardy and [[Walter Scott]], as well as for lesser figures such as [[Harrison Ainsworth|Ainsworth]], Powys was clearly a [[modernist]],&lt;ref&gt;See ''In the Spirit of Powys: New Essays'', ed. Denis Lane, London: Associated Universities Presses, 1990, especially the "Foreword" by Jerome J. McGann and Lane's "Introduction".&lt;/ref&gt; and has affinities also with [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Walter Pater]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[Carl Gustav Jung]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[James Joyce]], and [[Dorothy Richardson]].&lt;ref&gt;He published short studies of both Dostoievsky and Richardson and corresponded with Richardson; re Nietzsche, Pater, Proust, see references in ''Autobiography''. Re Jung, see Morine Krissdottir's, ''Descents of Memory'', pp. 267–8, and Freud pp. 403–4.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Maiden Castle, Dorchester..jpg|thumb|[[Maiden Castle, Dorset]] hill fort has an important role in Powys's novel ''Maiden Castle'']]
It is clear from Powys's diaries that his newfound success was greatly helped by the stability that his relationship with Phyllis Playter gave him and her frequent advice on his work in progress.&lt;ref&gt;Morine Krissdottir's, ''Descents of Memory'', p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

''A Glastonbury Romance'' sold particularly well in its British edition, though this was of little avail as it was the subject of an expensive libel case brought by [[Gerard Hodgkinson]], the owner of the [[Wookey Hole Caves]], who felt himself identifiably and unfairly portrayed in the character of Philip Crow.&lt;ref&gt;There were five impressions of the novel in Britain, but Morine Krissdottir suggests that it was less successful in the USA, ''A Descent of Memory''. (New York: Overlook Duckworth, 2007), p. 263. Re the libel case, see Krissdottir pp. 301–2, 304–8.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Powys this novel's "heroine is the [[Grail]]",&lt;ref&gt;"Preface" to ''A Glastonbury Romance''. London: Macdonald, 1955, p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; and its central concern is with the various myths, legends and history associated with Glastonbury. Not only is ''A Glastonbury Romance'' concerned with the legend that [[Joseph of Arimathea]] brought the Grail, a vessel containing the blood of Christ, to the town, but the further tradition that [[King Arthur]] was buried there.&lt;ref&gt;Krissdottir, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, one of the novel's main characters, the Welshman Owen Evans, introduces the idea that the Grail has a Welsh (Celtic), pagan, pre-Christian origin.&lt;ref&gt;See Ben Jones "The 'mysterious word Esplumeoir' and Polyphonic Structure" in ''A Glastonbury Romance'' in ''In the Spirit of Powys'', p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The main sources for Powys's ideas on mythology and the Grail legend are [[Sir John Rhys]]'s ''Studies in the Arthurian Legend'', [[R. S. Loomis]]'s ''Celtic Myth and Arthurian Romance'', and the works of [[Jessie L. Weston]], including ''[[From Ritual to Romance]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Krissdottir, Morine. ''Descent of Memory: The Life of John Cowper Powys''. London: Overlook Press, 2007, pp. 252–3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Wasteland]]'' is another possible influence.&lt;ref&gt;See Krissdottir, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; A central aspect of ''A Glastonbury Romance'' is the attempt by John Geard, ex-minister now the mayor of Glastonbury, to restore Glastonbury to its medieval glory as a place of religious pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;Krissdottir, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the Glastonbury industrialist Philip Crow, along with John and Mary Crow and Tom Barter, who are, like him, from Norfolk, view the myths and legends of the town with contempt.&lt;ref&gt;See Cavaliero, pp. 61-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip's vision is of a future with more mines and more factories. John Crow, however, as he is penniless, takes on the task of organising a pageant for Geard. At the same time an alliance of [[anarchism|Anarchists]], [[Marxists]], and [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]] try to turn Glastonbury into a commune.

====Welsh novels====
[[File:Portals Caer Drywn.jpg|300px|thumb|left|[[Caer Drewyn]], [[Corwen]], locally known as Mynydd-y-Gaer, the hill fort where Powys completed ''Owen Glendower'' on 24 December 1939. It is also an important setting in ''[[Porius]]''.]]

While [[Welsh mythology]] was already important in ''A Glastonbury Romance'' and ''Maiden Castle'' it became even more important after he and Phyllis Playter moved to [[Corwen]], Wales, in 1935, first in the minor novel ''Morwyn or The Vengeance of God'' (1937).&lt;ref&gt;See Wilson Knight ''The Saturnian Quest''. London: Methuen, 1964, pp. 39-40, 52-55, 65, 74-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Another important element in ''Morwyn'', is condemnation of animal cruelty, especially [[vivisection]], a theme also found in ''Weymouth Sands'' (1934).&lt;ref&gt;For ''Morwyn'' see Herbert Williams, ''John Cowper Powys'', p. 130, and re ''Weymouth Sands'' Morine Krissdottir, ''Descents of Memory'', p. 278; also John Cowper Powys, ''Autobiography''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1934, pp. 583–4,&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, some writers have claimed Powys anticipated the modern [[animal rights]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dudley Ryder, ''Animal revolution: changing attitudes toward speciesism''. Berg Publishers, 2000, p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John M. Kistler, ''People Promoting and People Opposing Animal Rights: In Their Own Words''. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

There then followed two major historical novels set in Wales, ''[[Owen Glendower (novel)|Owen Glendower]]'' (1941)&lt;ref&gt;Issued 24 January 1941. Dante Thomas ''A Bibliography of the Principal Writings of John Cowper Powys''&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Porius (A Romance of the Dark Ages)|Porius]]'' (1951). The first deals with the rebellion of the Welsh Prince [[Owen Glendower]] (A.D.1400–16), while ''Porius'' takes place in the time of the mythic King Arthur (A.D. 499). However, Arthur is a minor character compared with the Welsh Prince Porius, and the King's magician [[Myrddin]] ([[Merlin]]). In both works, but especially ''Porius'', Powys makes use of the mythology found in the Welsh classic ''[[The Mabinogion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See index of Morine Krissdottir's, ''Descents of Memory'', for this.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Porius'' is, for some, the crowning achievement of Powys's maturity, but others are repelled by its obscurity. It was originally severely cut for publication, but in recent years two attempts have been made to recreate Powys's original intent.&lt;ref&gt;Colgate University Press, 1994, ed. Wilbur T. Albrecht, and OverlookDuckworth, 2007, ed. Judith Bond and Morine Krissdottir.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not surprising that John Cowper Powys should, after he moved to Corwen, decide to begin a novel about [[Owen Glendower]], because it was in Corwen that Owen's rebellion against [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] began on 16 September 1400,&lt;ref&gt;R. Rees Davies, ''The Revolt of Owain Glyn Dŵr'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press), 1995. {{ISBN|0-19-285336-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he formally assumed the ancestral title of Prince of Powys at his manor house of [[Glyndyfrdwy]], then in the parish of Corwen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.castlewales.com/gldwr_mt.html] Glyndyfrdwy.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1935 Phyllis Playter had suggested that he should write an historical novel about Owen Glendower.&lt;ref&gt;Krissdóttir, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; An important aspect of ''Owen Glendower'' are historical parallels between the beginning of the fifteenth century and the late 1930s and early 1940s: "A sense of contemporataneousness is ever present in ''Owen Glendower''. We are in a world of change like our own".&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Williams, ''John Cowper Powys'' (Brigend: Seren,, 1997), p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was conceived at a time when the "[[Spanish Civil War]]&lt;ref group = note&gt;On the April 26, 1937, two days after Powys began his novel, the Spanish town of [[Bombing of Gernika|Guernica]], was bombed by the [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[Luftwaffe]]. It inspired the painting ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' by [[Pablo Picasso]].&lt;/ref&gt; was a major topic of public debate" and completed on 24 December 1939, a few months after [[World War II]] had begun.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Lock, "''Owen Glendower'' and the Dashing of Expectations". ''The Powys Journal'', vol. XV, 2005, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Porius'' is set mainly in Corwen. The events in this novel take place during the week of "October 18, to October 25, A.D. 499", during a historical period when, Powys claims, "There appears to be an absolute blank, as far as documentary evidence goes, with regard to the history of Britain".&lt;ref name = powys499&gt;"Historic Background to the Year of Grace A.D. 499", ''Porius'' (2007), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; This was in fact a time of major transition in the history of Britain, with the replacing of Roman traditions with [[Saxon]] rule, as well as the conversion of the British to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Powys Digital History Project]]: [http://history.powys.org.uk/history/common/early1.html].&lt;/ref&gt; There are again, as with ''Owen Glendower'', parallels with contemporary history: "The Dark Ages and the 1930s are the periods of what Powys, in [[Yeats]]ian phrase calls 'appalling transition' ".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ballin, "''Porius'' and the Dialectic of History", p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; and there was the clear possibility of [[Operation Sea Lion|another "Saxon" invasion]], when Powys began writing Porius in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ballin, "''Porius'' and the Cauldron of Rebirth", p217.&lt;/ref&gt; In prefatory comments, probably written around 1949, at the time of the beginning of the [[Cold War]], Powys suggests that,
&lt;blockquote&gt;As we contemplate the historic background to&amp;nbsp;[…] the last year of the fifth century [sic], it is impossible not to think of the background of human life from which we watch the first half of the twentieth century dissolve into the second half. As the old gods were departing then, so the old gods are departing now. And as the future was dark with the terrifying possibilities of human disaster then, so, today, are we confronted by the possibility of catastrophic world events.&lt;ref&gt;"Historic Background to the Year of Grace A.D. 499", p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Powys also saw the period of Owen Glendower's rebellion taking place at the time of "one of the most momentous and startling epochs of ''transition'' that the world has known".&lt;ref&gt;'"Argument" to ''[[Owen Glendower]]''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, [1941], p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as the landscape of [[Dorset]] and [[Somerset]], and the characters' deep personal relationships with it, had been of great importance in the great [[Wessex]] novels, so the landscape of Wales, especially that of the Corwen region, was now significant.

The landscape and the intimate relationship that characters have with the elements, including the sky, wind, plants, animals, and insects, are of great significance in all Powys's works.&lt;ref&gt;See especially Denis Lane, "Elementalism in John Cowper Powys' ''Porius''. ''Papers on Language and Literature'' 17, no. 4 (1981), pp. 381–404.&lt;/ref&gt; These are linked to another major influence on Powys, [[Romanticism]], especially [[William Wordsworth]]&lt;ref&gt;"my great master", ''Autobiography'' (1967), p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; and writers influenced by Wordsworth such as [[Walter Pater]].&lt;ref&gt;''Autobiography'', pp. 301, 391.&lt;/ref&gt; Powys was also an admirer of [[Goethe]] and [[Rousseau]].&lt;ref&gt;John Cowper Powys, ''Enjoyment of Literature'', New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1938, pp. 276–308 and ''Autobiography'' (1967), p. 626.&lt;/ref&gt; Words such as ''mysticism''&lt;ref&gt;For Harald Fawkner, Powys is "one of the great mystic writers of all time". "Porius and Exteriority", ''Powys Notes'', vol.10, no.1, 1995, pp.28, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''pantheism''&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Coates, pp. 152–3.&lt;/ref&gt; are sometimes used in discussing Powys’s attitude to nature, but what he is concerned with is an ecstatic response to the natural world, epiphanies such as Wordsworth describes in his "[[Ode: Intimations of Immortality]]",&lt;ref&gt;''Autobiography'' (1967), pp. 38, 286.&lt;/ref&gt; with an important difference in that Powys believes that the ecstasy of the young child can be retained by any adult who actively cultivates the power of the imagination.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Harold Fawkner, ''The Ecstatic World of John Cowper Powys''.London: Associated University Presses,1986, pp. 34-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have compared this to zen and such contemplative practices,&lt;ref&gt;Ichiro Hara, "John Cowper Powys and Zen". ''The Powys Review'', vol. IIiii (no.7) Winter 1980, pp. 24–34 and Cicely Hill "'Susukeshi Hina Mo': John Cowper Powys and the Chuang-Tse Legacy", ''The Powys Review'' (no.7), pp. 34–44.&lt;/ref&gt; and for Powys, and the protagonists of his novels who usually resemble him, the cultivation of a psycho-sensuous philosophy is as important as the Christian religion was for an earlier generation.&lt;ref&gt;See Powys's ''Autobiography'' (1967) pp. 35, 414 and C. A Coates, pp. 151–3,165–9, especially.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Late novels====
More minor in scale, the novels that followed ''Porius'' are characterized by an element of fantasy. ''The Inmates'' (1952) is set in a madhouse and explores Powys's interest in mental illness. But it is a work on which Powys failed to bestow sufficient "time and care".&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Coates, p. 156; and Cavaliero, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Glen Cavaliero, in ''John Cowper Powys: Novelist'', describes the novels written after ''Porius'' as "the spontaneous fairy tales of [[Rabelais]]ian [[surrealist]] enchanted with life", and finds ''Atlantis'' (1954) "the richest and most sustained" of them.&lt;ref&gt;Cavaliero, pp. 131, 133.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Atlantis'' is set in the [[Homer]]ic world and the protagonist is Nisos the young son of [[Odysseus]] who plans to voyage west from [[Ithaca]] over the drowned [[Atlantis]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Wilson Knight, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Powys final fiction, such as ''Up and Out'' (1957) and ''All or Nothing'' (1960) "use the mode of science fiction, although science has no part in them".&lt;ref&gt;Coates, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-fiction===

====Autobiographical====
One of Powys's most important works, his ''[[John Cowper Powys's Autobiography|Autobiography]]'' (1934), which describes his first 60 years. While he sets out to be totally frank about himself, and especially his sexual peculiarities and perversions, he largely excludes any substantial discussion of the women in his life.&lt;ref&gt;Krissdottir pp. 287-294.&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is now much clearer because we now know that it was written while he was still married to Margaret, though he was living in a permanent relationship with Phyllis Playter.

It is one of his most important works and writer [[J. B. Priestley]] suggests that, even if Powys had not written a single novel, "this one book alone would have proved him to be a writer of genius."&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction". ''Autobiography'' . London: Macdonald, 1967, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; And it "has justly been compared to the ''[[Confessions (Rousseau)|Confessions of Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]."&lt;ref&gt;See Morine Krissdottir, ''Descents of Memory'', p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Cowper Powys was a prolific writer of letters, many of which have been published, and kept a diary from 1929; several diaries, including this one, have been published.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Head, "Introduction" to ''The Diary of John Cowper Powys for 1929'', ed. Anthony Head. London: Cecil Woolf, 1998, p7.&lt;/ref&gt; Among his correspondents were the novelists [[Theodore Dreiser]], [[James Purdy]], [[James Hanley (novelist)|James Hanley]], [[Henry Miller]] and [[Dorothy Richardson]], but he also replied to the many ordinary admirers who wrote to him.&lt;ref&gt;See letters of Theodore Dreisser, and for Purdy, Miller, Richardson, and others in the bibliography. With regard to James Hanley, letters can be found in the National Library of Wales and Liverpool Record Office and Local History Service.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philosophical====
Periodically, over almost 50 years, starting with ''Confessions of Two Brothers'' in 1916, Powys wrote works that present his personal philosophy of life. These are not works of philosophy in the academic sense, and in a bookstore the appropriate section might be [[self-help book|self-help]]. Powys describes ''A Philosophy of Solitude'' (1933) as a "short textbook of the various mental tricks by which the human soul can obtain […] comparative happiness beneath the normal burden of human fate".&lt;ref&gt;John Cowper Powys, "Introduction to the English edition", ''A Philosophy of Solitude''. London: Jonathan Cape, 1933, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; It might seem that Powys's various works of popular philosophy were mere potboilers, written to help their finances while he was working on his novels, but critics like Denis Lane, Harald Fawkner, and Janina Nordius believe that they give insight into "the intellectual structures that form the metastructures of the great novels".&lt;ref&gt;Harald Fawkner quoted by Janina Nordius in '"I Am Myself Alone",' p. 16. Denis Lane frequently quotes from Powys's non-fiction in his "Introduction" to ''In the Spirit of Powys: New Essays''.&lt;/ref&gt; These works were frequently best sellers, especially in the USA. ''The Meaning of Culture'' published in 1929 went through twenty editions in Powys's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Head, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; ''In Defence of Sensuality'', published at the end of the following year, was yet another best seller,&lt;ref name=langridge/&gt; as was ''A Philosophy of Solitude'' (1933).&lt;ref name="langridge"/&gt;

====Literary criticism====
Taking advantage of his reputation as an itinerant lecturer, Powys published in 1915 a collection of literary essays, ''Visions and Revisions''. This was published by the manager of his lecture tours, Arnold Shaw, as was the subsequent ''Suspended Judgements: Essays on Books and Sensations'' (1916) and ''One Hundred Best Books'' (1916). ''Visions and Revisions'' went through four impressions in sixteen months.&lt;ref&gt;Krissdottir, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; In the next thirty years he published another collection of essays, ''The Enjoyment of Literature'' (1938)  (''The Pleasures of Literature'' in the UK), and three studies of writers, ''Dorothy Richardson'' (1931), ''Dostoievsky'' (1947), and ''Rabelais'' (1948), as well as essays in journals on various writers, including [[Theodore Dreiser]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[James Joyce]], and [[D.H. Lawrence]].&lt;ref&gt;See Langridge.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a work on [[John Keats]], part of which was published posthumously, and a study of [[Aristophanes]] that Powys was working on in his later years.&lt;ref&gt;John Cowper Powys. ''John Keats: or Popular Paganism'', ed. Cedric Hentschel. London: Cecil Woolf, 1993. Re Aristophanes see Morine Krissdottir's, ''Descents of Memory'', p.  409.&lt;/ref&gt;

Powys's literary criticism was generally well received by reviewers and Morine Krissdottir in her recent biography of Powys describes the essays in ''Suspended Judgements'' as "fine criticism".&lt;ref&gt;Krissdottir, p. 152. For another example see Percy Hutchinson, "Adventures Among Masterpieces", ''New York Times Book Review'', 20 November 1938, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to ''The Pleasures of Literature'', writer Kenneth Hopkins states that "[i]f ever there was a book of criticism for the general reader, this is it".&lt;ref&gt;''The Powys Brothers: A biographical appreciation''. Southrepps, Norfolk: Warren House Press, 1967, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s Powys wrote books on two of his favourite authors, ''Dostoievsky'' (1946) and ''Rabelais'' (1948). The latter was particularly praised by a number of reviewers. Rabelais scholar Donald M. Frame, for example, in the ''Romantic Review'', December 1951, describes Powys's translation (which was only of one fourth of Rabelais) "the best we have in English".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by W. J. Keith "John Cowper Powys and Rabelais". ''la letter powysienne'', no. 20, Autumn, 2010, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; A French translation of ''Rabelais'', by Catherine Lieutenant, was published in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Verviers, La Thalamège.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reputation===
Powys is a somewhat controversial writer "who evokes both massive contempt and near idolatry".&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Coates, ''John Cowper Powys in Search of a Landscape'' (179)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus while [[Walter Allen]] in ''Tradition and Dream'' recognises Powys's genius, he is dissatisfied with what Powys has done with it, seeing Powys's approach to the novel, as "so alien to the temper of the age as to be impossible for many people to take seriously".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by C.A. Coates, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Annie Dillard]], however, views things quite differently: "John Cowper Powys is a powerful genius, whose novels stir us deeply."&lt;ref&gt;''Writers Choice: A Library of Rediscoveries''. Ed. Katz and Katz (95)&lt;/ref&gt; What is noteworthy is that throughout his career he consistently gained the admiration of novelists as diverse as [[Theodore Dreiser]], [[Henry Miller]], [[Iris Murdoch]], [[Margaret Drabble]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,1842437,00.html A Guardian article Aug. 2006 by [[Margaret Drabble]]: Overview of works and career of Powys]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Purdy]], as well as the academic critics [[George Painter]], [[G. Wilson Knight]], [[George Steiner]],&lt;ref&gt;: [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1988/05/02/1988_05_02_116_TNY_CARDS_000139392 Review by George Steiner in the ''New Yorker'', 2 May 1988]&lt;/ref&gt; Harald Fawkner, and [[Jerome McGann]]. In his autobiography, film director [[John Boorman]] wrote that he had contemplated a movie adaptation of ''[[A Glastonbury Romance]]'' early in his career.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/sep/13/film.highereducation] David Thomson, "Making masterpieces": a review of John Boorman's ''Adventures of a Suburban Boy''. ''The Guardian'', Saturday 13 September 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958 "Powys was presented with the Bronze Plaque of [[Freie Akademie der Künste Hamburg|the Hamburg Free Academy of Arts]] in recognition of his outstanding services to literature and philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;Langridge, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; Then on 23 July 1962, Powys, who was 90, was awarded the honorary degree of [[Doctor of Letters]] ''in absentia'', by the [[University of Wales]] at [[University College, Swansea|Swansea]], where he was described as "patriarch of the literature of these islands".&lt;ref&gt;Langridge, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; He was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] by [[Enid Starkie]] in 1958, and by [[G. Wilson Knight]] in 1959 and 1962.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/redirector/?redir=archive/&lt;/ref&gt;

Powys's works have been translated into French,&lt;ref&gt;French Wikipedia article [[:fr:John Cowper Powys#.C5.92uvres]]&lt;/ref&gt; German,&lt;ref&gt;German Wikipedia page [[:de:John Cowper Powys#Werke]]&lt;/ref&gt; Swedish,&lt;ref&gt;Swedish Wikipedia page [[:sv:John Cowper Powys]]&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese,&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction" to ''Powys to a Japanese Friend: The Letters of John Cowper Powys to Ichiro Hara'', edited Anthony Head.

'''John Peter Portelli''' (born 1954) is a Maltese [[educationist]], and (at least in the Maltese context) a minor [[philosopher]]. In philosophy he mostly specialised in the [[Philosophy of Education]] with interests in [[Political Theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Montebello, ''Il-Ktieb tal-Filosofija f’Malta'' (''A Source Book of Philosophy in Malta''), PIN Publications, Malta, 2001, Vol. II, p. 110; Mark Montebello, ''20th Century Philosophy in Malta'', Agius &amp; Agius, Malta, 2009, pp. 139-140; Mark Montebello, ''Malta’s Philosophy &amp; Philosophers'', PIN Publications, Malta, 2011, pp. 122-125.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Portelli was born on March 21, 1954, at [[Mosta]], Malta. In 1975 he acquired a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[philosophy]] and [[Maltese language|Maltese]] from the [[University of Malta]]. Subsequently, he began teaching [[history]] and [[modern languages]] at [[Savio College, Dingli|Savio College]], [[Dingli]], Malta, and then, in 1976, [[philosophy]] at [[De La Salle College (Malta)|De La Salle College]], [[Cottonera]], Malta. In 1977 he pursued his studies in [[Canada]] at the [[McGill University]], [[Montreal]], from where he acquired a [[Master’s degree|Masters]] (1979) and a [[Doctorate]] (1984). He permanently emigrated from Malta to Canada in 1980.

In [[Canada]] Portelli began teaching at the [[McGill University]], where four year later, in 1982, he became lecturer of philosophy with the Faculty of Education. He also taught at the [[Cégep Marie-Victorin]] (college) in [[Montreal]] (1982–83), and was a Killam Fellow at the [[Dalhousie University]], [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], where he also taught philosophy (1986, 1988, 1990, 1992). Between 1986 and 1992, he taught [[Philosophy of Education]] at [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]]. He also taught at [[St. Mary's University, Texas|St. Mary’s University]], [[Texas]], U.S. (1994–95); the [[Acadia University]], [[Wolfville]], [[Nova Scotia]] (1997–98); and at the [[University of British Columbia]], [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] (1998).

Portelli was appointed Associate Professor of Philosophy in 1989, and Professor of Philosophy in 1994. He began teaching at the [[University of Toronto]], Canada, in 1999. He was Assistant editor (1992–96), and then Editor (1996–99), of the periodical ''Paideusis'', the official magazine of Canada's [[Philosophy of Education]].

'''Joseph ben Simeon Kara''' ({{circa}} 1065 – c. 1135) ({{lang-he|יוסף בן שמעון קרא}}), also known as '''Mahari Kara''', was a French [[Bible exegete]] who was born and lived in [[Troyes]]. His uncle and teacher was [[Menahem ben Ḥelbo]], whom Ḳara often cites in his commentaries, these quotations being almost the only source of knowledge concerning Menahem's exegesis.

Ḳara frequented [[Rashi]]'s house; it is even possible that he was Rashi's pupil,&lt;ref&gt;[[Zunz]], ''Z.G.'' p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; though this is denied by [[A. Epstein]]. They each quote from the other.&lt;ref&gt;comp. Joseph Ḳara on [[Prov.]] iv.4, v.14, vi.23, xviii.22; Rashi on [[Book of Judges|Judges]] iii.26; [[Num.]] xvii.5, xxiv.14; [[Isa.]] x.24).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social milieu ==
In Rashi's house Ḳara also made the acquaintance of [[Samuel ben Meïr]].&lt;ref&gt;Compare RaSHBaM on [[Gen.]] xxxvii.13.&lt;/ref&gt; They likewise quote each other.&lt;ref&gt;Compare RaSHBaM on [[Gen.]] xxiv.60 and [[Num.]] iv.10; Rosin, ''R. Samuel ben Meïr,'' pp. 12 et seq., 72 et seq.; Joseph Ḳara on [[Book of Amos|Amos]] iii.12; [[Book of Job|Job]] xi.17; [[Gen.]] x.15; Porges, in ''Monatsschrift,'' 1883, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isaac Ḳara]], of whose exegesis specimens are given in ''Monatsschrift,'' 1864, p.&amp;nbsp;219; 1865, p.&amp;nbsp;384,&lt;ref&gt;Compare Rosin, l.c. pp. 24 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; may be a son of Joseph.

The surname "Ḳara" is usually taken to be a professional name, meaning "reader" or "interpreter of the Bible".&lt;ref&gt;See ''Jew. Encyc.'' iii.168, s.v. Bible Exegesis&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adolf Jellinek]] points out, however,&lt;ref&gt;''Commentarien zu Esther, Ruth,'' etc., p. vi, Leipzig, 1855.&lt;/ref&gt; that "Ḳara," as contrasted with "Darshan," means the representative of the "Peshaṭ" ("Pashṭan").

He was among the first French exegetes and the forerunner of the French school of exegetes later to come. They were all to some extent influenced by his works, most notably among them, the [[Rashbam]]. [[Rashi]] too was influenced by R. Yosef who repeated his teacher's comments to him and incorporated several of them in his commentary&lt;ref&gt;The Rishonim, The Artscroll history series. Entry R. Yosef Kara.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Works ==
Ḳara was a prolific exegetical writer. When he copied Rashi's commentary on the [[Pentateuch]] he added numerous glosses and remarks in order to supplement and revise it; and these glosses were inserted by the scribes in the text of Rashi. They have been collected.&lt;ref&gt;By [[A. Geiger]] in ''Niṭ'e Na'amanim,'' i.1 et seq.; idem in ''Parschandatha,'' pp. 21 et seq.; and by [[Abraham Berliner]] in ''Pletath Soferim'' (Hebr. part), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original or independent Bible commentaries of Ḳara are:
* According to Berliner (l.c. p.&amp;nbsp;16), a commentary on ''[[Deuteronomy]]'' i–iv. (printed l.c. [Hebr. part], pp.&amp;nbsp;6 et seq.).
* Commentaries on the [[Neviim|Prophets]] published in ''Miḳra'ot Gedolot,'' Lublin, 1897 (see [[Samuel Poznanski]] in ''Zeit. für Hebr. Bibl.'' v.68); extracts from these commentaries were published by Wolf in ''Ha-Shaḥar,'' ii.289, iii.688, iv.55 (see also, [[L. Dukes]] in ''Orient, Lit.'' 1847, p.&amp;nbsp;344); by Littmann in ''Josef ben Simeon Kara,'' pp.&amp;nbsp;26–32 (from [[Isaiah]] and [[Ezekiel]]). Those on the ''[[Book of Samuel]]'' and most of the [[Minor Prophets]] are not genuine (Porges, in ''Monatsschrift,'' 1883, p.&amp;nbsp;170; Rosin, l.c. p.&amp;nbsp;72, note 2). The ''[[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]]'' commentary was published separately by Schlossberg (''Commentaire sur Jerémie,'' Paris, 1881; comp. Brüll's ''Jahrb.'' vii.170 et seq.; see, also, [[Zunz]], ''Z.G.'' p.&amp;nbsp;68; Geiger, l.c. i.18); that on ''[[Hosea]],'' Breslau, 1861.
* Commentaries on most of the ''[[Hagiographa]]'' namely:
** ''[[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]]''; see the quotation in Ḳara's commentary on [[Eccl.]] vii.12.
** ''[[Book of Job]],'' published in ''Monatsschrift,'' vols. v., vi, and vii (see also, [[S.D. Luzzatto]] in ''Kerem Ḥemed,'' vii. 61 et seq.; [[A. Geiger]], l.c. [Hebr. part], pp.&amp;nbsp;11 et seq.).
** ''[[Canticles]]'' (i. 1-vii. 13), published by Hübsch (''Ḥamesh Megillot,'' Prague, 1866; see Salfeld, ''Das Hohelied Salomo's,'' p.&amp;nbsp;49).
** ''[[Book of Ruth]],'' published by Hübsch, l.c., and by A. Jellinek, l.c. (comp. A. Epstein in ''Ha-Ḥoḳer,'' i.31, note 2).
** ''[[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]],'' published in Naples in 1486, and by Hübsch (l.c.), Jellinek (l.c.), and E. Ashkenazi (''Dibre Ḥakamim,'' pp.&amp;nbsp;17 et seq., Metz, 1849), and by [[S. Buber]] in two different recensions in ''Kaufmann Gedenkbuch,'' pp.&amp;nbsp;8 et seq.
** ''[[Ecclesiastes]],'' published by Hübsch (l.c.) and Einstein (in Berliner's ''Magazin,'' xiii. [''Oẓar Ṭob'']).
** ''[[Book of Esther]],'' published by Hübsch (l.c.), Jellinek (l.c.), and Berliner (ib. 1878; comp. ib. 1876, p.&amp;nbsp;158).

It is quite possible that Ḳara wrote also commentaries on ''[[Ezra and Nehemiah]],'' but that the commentaries on these books as contained in MS. Saraval No. 27, and ascribed to Joseph Ḳara, are not genuine ([[A. Geiger]], in ''Oẓar Neḥmad,'' iv.43 et seq.). Some comments of Ḳara on ''[[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]]'' must have existed, as is proved by the quotations in [[pseudo-Rashi]] to those books (see ''II Chron.'' iii.15, v.9, xxv.24). According to Epstein (l.c. i.29 et seq.), Ḳara wrote additionally
* glosses to the pseudo-Rashi commentary on ''[[Genesis Rabbah]],'' and
* a commentary on the ''[[Maḥzor]]'' (comp. [[Zunz]], ''Ritus,'' p.&amp;nbsp;198).

== Characteristics ==
While in his glosses on the Pentateuch and in his commentaries on the Prophets Ḳara depends upon Rashi to the greatest extent, his explanations of the ''Hagiographa'' are more original. He quotes [[Menahem ben Saruḳ]], [[Dunash ibn Labraṭ]], [[Judah ha-Darshan|Judah]] and [[Moses ha-Darshan]], [[Ḳalir]], [[Meïr Sheliaḥ Ẓibbur]], [[Kalonymus]], and others. In his commentary on ''[[Book of Job]]'' he frequently uses the writings of [[Shabbethai Donnolo]], and gives very valuable extracts from the lost ''[[Baraita of Samuel]]'' with Donnolo's commentary (comp. Epstein, l.c. pp.&amp;nbsp;34 et seq.).

His grammatical standpoint is that of Rashi. Whole Hebrew sentences are sometimes translated into [[French language|French]]. In his expressions he is not as terse as Rashi. He is bold enough to express the opinion that the [[Book of Samuel]] was not written by the prophet himself, but later (''Commentary on I Samuel'' ix.9). He does not go into grammatical or philological research, and cares more for the sense of the whole sentence than for a single word. He shows more common sense than depth, and though he does not altogether hold aloof from [[haggadic]] interpretations, he takes a leading place among the exegetes of northern France, who in general preferred the rational exegesis.

'''''Seon Buddhism''''' ([[Korean language|Korean]]: 선; [[Help:IPA/Korean|IPA]]: [sŏn]) is the transformative facture of [[Chan Buddhism]] tradition and creed in Korea. A main feature of Seon Buddhism is a method of meditation, [[Hua_Tou |Ganhwa Seon]] (Korean: 간화선). A Korean monk, Jinul (Korean: 지눌) accepted partially a meditative method of Chan Buddhism in 1205. In Chan Buddhism, hwadu (Korean: 화두) was a delivery of realising a natural state of the Awakening. Jinul addressed a doctrine of Sagyo Yiepseon (Korean: 사교입선) that monks should live an inborn life after learning and forgetting all creeds and theories. Within the doctrine of Jinul, hwadu is the witnessing of truthful meaning in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dic.tvbuddha.org/s1/view.htm?vtype=search&amp;search_key=%EA%B0%84%ED%99%94%EC%84%A0&amp;page=1&amp;num=230&amp;PHPSESSID=9cc76a10b115e52b7b6f6b7186c251f8|title=실용 한-영 불교용어사전|website=dic.tvbuddha.org|language=ko|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Seon==
{{See also|Korean Buddhism}}During the [[Goryeo]] dynasty [[Jinul]] strongly influenced Korean Buddhism. He was the first monk to be appointed a national teacher and advisor by the king, having written a book presenting the Seon tradition from the [[Song dynasty|Song]] dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.koreanbuddhism.net/bbs/board.php?bo_table=3060&amp;wr_id=25|title=Jinul &gt; Korean Seon Masters {{!}} Welcome to Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism|website=www.koreanbuddhism.net|language=en|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; And this Seon tradition preserved well to this day, after [[Taego Bou]] brought his Dharma transmission to Goryeo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.koreanbuddhism.net/bbs/board.php?bo_table=1030&amp;wr_id=49|title=Bou &gt; Korean Seon Masters {{!}} Welcome to Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism|website=www.koreanbuddhism.net|language=en|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Joseon]] dynasty suppressed buddhism in favour of [[confucianism]]. In spite of the suppression, [[Hyujeong]] wrote about the three religions (Seon Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism) in the Joseon dynasty from Seon point of view. He also succeeded to the Dharma transmission. During the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)]], Hyujeong and [[Yujeong]] commanded guerrilla units of monks and took part in diplomacy. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.koreanbuddhism.net/bbs/board.php?bo_table=3060&amp;wr_id=24|title=Hyujeong &gt; Korean Seon Masters {{!}} Welcome to Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism|website=www.koreanbuddhism.net|language=en|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under annexation by [[Japan]] most monks were forced to marry - this lasted about 40 years until the act of purification. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.beopbo.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=94214|title=한국 전통 간화선풍 되살린 선지식 진면목 - 법보신문|access-date=2017-09-06|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;During those times, masters like [[Gyeongheo|Gyoengheo]] and [[Mangong]] kept Dharma transmission alive.

21th centry, the few left this Dharma transmission. "남진제 북송담'(南眞際 北松潭) (Jinje to the south, Songdam to the north)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.beopbo.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=95179|title=“송담 스님 잘못 보필한 허물 참회합니다” - 법보신문|access-date=2017-09-06|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; is well-known phrase in Korean seon tradition these days. Others are [[Seungsahn]], [[Daewon]].[[File:Monk seon.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Seon [[bhikkhuni|bhikṣuṇī]] in Seoul, South Korea]]

===Unified Silla Period (668–935)===

====Transmission of Chan to Korea====
Chan was transmitted into [[Unified Silla]] (668-935).{{sfn|Marshall|1995|p=63}}{{sfn|Keown|Prebish|2007}}&lt;ref group=web name="RoutledgeBpK"&gt;[http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/G201 Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ''"Buddhist philosophy, Korean"'']&lt;/ref&gt; Beomnang (法朗, Pŏmnang, Peomnang) (632-646), who studied with the Fourth Patriarch [[Dayi Daoxin]] (道信) (580-651), was the first to bring the teachings to Korea.{{sfn|Marshall|1995|p=63}}{{sfn|Keown|Prebish|2007}} Beomnang transmitted his teachings to Sinhaeng (神行) (704-779), who also traveled to China. Sinhaeng studied with Puji (651–739), a successor of [[Yuquan Shenxiu]] (died 706), the head of the [[East Mountain Teaching]] of Chan.{{sfn|Keown|Prebish|2007}} Seon was further popularized by Doui (道義) (died 825) at the beginning of the ninth century.

====Nine Schools====
{{Main|Nine mountain schools}}

Seon was gradually further transmitted into Korea, as Korean monks of predominantly [[Hwaeom]] (華嚴) and [[Yogacara]] (唯識) background{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} began to travel to China to study the [[Hongzhou school]] of [[Mazu Daoyi]] (709–788) and his successors{{sfn|Keown|Prebish|2007}} and the [[Rinzai school]] of [[Linji Yixuan]]. Mazu's successors had numerous Korean students, some of whom returned to Korea and established their own schools at various mountain monasteries with their leading disciples.{{sfn|Keown|Prebish|2007}}

Initially, the number of these schools was fixed at nine. Seon was termed the [[nine mountain schools]]" at the time.{{sfn|Marshall|1995|p=63}} Eight of these were of the lineage of Mazu Daoyi (馬祖道一) (709-788), as they were established through connection with either him or one of his eminent disciples.{{sfn|Keown|Prebish|2007}} The one exception was the Sumi-san school founded by Yieom (利嚴) (869-936), which had developed from the [[Caodong school]] (曹洞).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Toǔi (道義 Doui) (died 825), who studied with [[Zhizang]] (735-814) and [[Baizhang Huaihai]] (百丈) (749-814)  is regarded as the first patriarch of Korean Sŏn. He founded the Kaji Mountain school (迦智山 Gaji san school). The Nine mountain Schools adopted the name [[Jogye Order]] in 826.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The first record of the Nine Mountains school dates from 1084.{{sfn|Keown|Prebish|2007}}

===Goryeo Dynasty (918–1392)===
[[File:Dkh.PNG|thumb|right|upright|Korean [[bhikkhu|bhikṣu]] of the Seon school]]

====Tension====
By the eleventh century Sŏn Buddhism became established in Korea. It distinguished itself from the existing Five Schools{{refn|group=note|Kyeyul chong (Vinaya school), Yŏlban chong (Nirvāna school), Pŏpsŏng chong (Dharma Nature school), Hwaŏm chong (Huayen school), and Pŏpsang chong (Yogācāra school).{{sfn|Keown|Prebish|2007}}}} and their scriptural emphasis.{{sfn|Keown|Prebish|2007}} Tension developed between the new meditational schools and the previously existing scholastic schools, which were described by the term ''gyo'', meaning "learning" or "study".{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Efforts were needed to attain mutual understanding and rapprochement between Sŏn and these scholastic schools.{{sfn|Keown|Prebish|2007}}

====Jinul====
{{Main|Jinul}}

The most important figure of Goryeo-era Seon was [[Jinul]] ({{korean|hangul=지눌|hanja=知訥}}, 1158-1210), who established a reform movement in Korea. In his time, the sangha was in a crisis of external appearance and internal issues of doctrine. Buddhism was seen as infected by secular tendencies and involvements, such as fortune-telling and the offering of prayers and rituals for success in secular endeavors. This perceived corruption was seen to create a profusion of monks and nuns with questionable motives. Therefore, the correction, revival, and improvement of the quality of Buddhism were prominent issues for Buddhist leaders of the period.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Jinul sought to establish a new movement within Korean Seon, which he called the "[[samadhi|samādhi]] and [[prajñā (Buddhism)|prajñā]] society". Its goal was to establish a new community of disciplined, pure-minded practitioners deep in the mountains. He eventually accomplished this mission with the founding of the [[Songgwangsa]] (松廣寺) at [[Jogyesan]] as a new center of pure practice.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Jinul's works are characterized by a thorough analysis and reformulation of the methodologies of Seon study and practice. He laid an equal emphasis on doctrinal teaching and Sŏn practice.{{sfn|Keown|Prebish|2007}} One major issue that had long fermented in Chan, and which received special focus from Jinul, was the relationship between "gradual" and "[[Subitism|sudden]]" methods in practice and enlightenment.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Drawing upon various Chinese treatments of this topic, most importantly those by [[Guifeng Zongmi]] (780-841) and [[Dahui Zonggao]] (大慧宗杲) (1089–1163), Jinul created Pojo Sŏn,{{sfn|Keown|Prebish|2007}} a "sudden enlightenment followed by gradual practice" dictum, which he outlined in a few relatively concise and accessible texts.{{sfn|Buswell|1991a}} Jinul incorporated Dahui Zonggao's ''gwanhwa'' ({{zh|c=觀話|p=guān huà}}, "observing the critical phrase") into his practice.{{sfn|Buswell|1991b}} This form of meditation is the main method taught in Korean Seon today.{{sfn|Lachs|2012}}

Jinul's philosophical resolution of the Seon-Gyo conflict brought a deep and lasting effect on Korean Buddhism.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

====Hyesim====
Jinul’s successor, Chin’gak Hyesim (혜심/慧諶: 1178~1234) further emphasized the hwadu (Ch. huatou, "word head" or "critical phrase") practice. He collected 1,125 gongans in his ''Sŏnmun yŏmsongjip'' ("The Collection of Verses and Cases", 1226). Hyesim encouraged female practitioners to practice hwadu, where-as women’s Buddhist practice was limited to chanting and sūtra-readings.{{sfn|Keown|Prebish|2007}}

====Jogye Order====
{{Main|Jogye Order}}

It was during the time of Jinul that the [[Jogye Order]], a Seon sect, became the predominant form of Korean Buddhism, a status it still holds.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} [[Taego Bou]] (1301–1382) studied the [[Linji school]] in China and returned to unite the Nine Mountain Schools.

There would be a series of important Seon teachers during the next several centuries, such as [[Hyegeun]] ({{korean|hanja=慧勤|hangul=혜근}}, 1320-76), [[Taego Bou]] (1301–82), [[Gihwa]] (1376–1433) and [[Hyujeong]] (1520-1604), who continued to develop the basic mold of Korean meditational Buddhism established by Jinul.

===Joseon (1392-1897)===
{{See also|Joseon}}

====Suppression====
At the end of Goryeo and during Joseon the Jogye Order was combined with the scholarly schools. It lost influence under the ruling class, which embraced neo-Confucianism.&lt;ref group=web name="RoutledgeChoson"&gt;[http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/G201SECT11 Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ''"11 Chosôn period (1392–1910)"''] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6HGo6xpor?url=http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/G201SECT11 |date=2013-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism was gradually suppressed for the next 500 years. The number of temples was reduced, restrictions on membership in the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] were installed, and Buddhist monks and nuns were literally chased into the mountains, forbidden to mix with society. Joseon Buddhism was first condensed to Seon and Gyo. Eventually, these were further reduced to the single school of Seon.

Giwha wrote an important treatise in defense of Buddhism, the ''Hyeonjeong non''. In the tradition of earlier philosophers, he applied [[Essence-Function]] and ''Hwaeom'' (''sa-sa mu-ae'', [[Five Ranks#The interplay of Absolute &amp; Relative|"mutual interpenetration of phenomena"]]).&lt;ref group=web name="RoutledgeChoson" /&gt;

During Joseon, the number of Buddhist monasteries dropped from several hundred to a mere thirty-six. Limits were placed on the number of clergy, land area, and ages for entering the sangha. When the final restrictions were in place, monks and nuns were prohibited from entering the cities. Buddhist funerals, and even begging, were outlawed. A few rulers temporarily lifted the more suppressive regulations. The most noteworthy of these was the [[Queen Munjeong]]. The queen had deep respect for the brilliant monk ''Bou'' (보우, 普雨; 1515&amp;ndash;1565), and installed him as the head of the Seon school.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

====Seosan====
{{Main|Hyujeong}}

Buddhist monks helped in repelling the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)]]. Monks were organized into guerrilla units, which enjoyed some instrumental successes. The "righteous monk" (義士; ''uisa'') movement was led by [[Hyujeong]] (1520&amp;ndash;1604), a Seon master and the author of a number of important religious texts. The presence of the monks' army was a critical factor in the eventual expulsion of the Japanese invaders.

Seosan made efforts toward the unification of Buddhist doctrinal study and practice. He was strongly influenced by Wonhyo, Jinul, and Giwha. He is considered the central figure in the revival of Joseon Buddhism, and most major streams of modern Korean Seon trace their lineages back to him through one of his four main disciples: [[Yujeong]] (1544&amp;ndash;1610); Eongi (1581&amp;ndash;1644), Taeneung (1562&amp;ndash;1649) and Ilseon (1533&amp;ndash;1608), all four of whom were lieutenants to Seosan during the war with Japan.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}
[[File:Guard statue in a Korean temple.jpg|thumb|Statue of one of the [[Four Heavenly Kings]]]]

====Late Joseon Kingdom====
Buddhism during the three centuries, from the time of Seosan down to the next Japanese incursion into Korea in the late nineteenth century, did not change very much. The Buddhism of the late Joseon Kingdom saw a revival of [[Hwaeom]] studies. There was also a revival of [[Pure Land Buddhism]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Korean Empire (1897-1910) and Japanese annexation (1910-1945)===
With the [[Korean Empire]] started the [[Gwangmu Reform]], a modernisation of Korea. The Korean Empire ended in 1910, when Korea was [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910|annexated by Japan]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Korean monks travelled to Japan for the scholarly study of Buddhism, where they were influenced by Japanese scholars who introduced western ideas into their studies. Via those Korean monks western ideas were also introduced in Korean Buddhism, and a bifurcation developed between monks and scholars.&lt;ref group=web name="RoutledgeConclusion"&gt;[http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/G201SECT12 Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ''"Conclusion"''] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6HGo7t051?url=http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/G201SECT12 |date=2013-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Division of Korea (1945-present)===
After the Second World War the [[United Nations]] developed plans for a trusteeship administration, the [[Soviet Union]] administering the peninsula north of the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] and the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea]] administering the south. The politics of the [[Cold War]] resulted in the 1948 establishment of two separate governments, [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]].

====Contemporary Seon====
{{See also|Religion in Korea|Religion in South Korea|Religion in North Korea}}

Since the middle of the 20th century [[Christianity]] has competed with Buddhism in South Korea,&lt;ref group=web name="RoutledgeConclusion" /&gt; while religious practice has been suppressed in North Korea.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/kn.html#People CIA, ''North Korea'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Seon continues to be practiced in Korea today at a number of major monastic centers, as well as being taught at [[Dongguk University]], which has a major of studies in this religion. The largest Buddhist denomination is the [[Jogye Order]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In the 1980s a debate arose about [[Subitism|"sudden" versus "gradual" enlightenment"]].&lt;ref group=web name="RoutledgeConclusion" /&gt; Since [[Jinul]] Korean Seon was based on the integration of practice and scholarly study in the slogan "sudden enlightenment, gradual cultivation". The modern Korean Seon master [[Seongcheol]] revived the slogan "sudden enlightenment, sudden cultivation", ascribed to [[Huineng]].&lt;ref group=web name="eLibSeongcheol"&gt;[http://www.buddhism.org/board/read.cgi?board=Dharma_Talks&amp;y_number=54 Buddhism.org Buddhist eLibrary, ''"Toeong Seongcheol"'']&lt;/ref&gt; The last three Supreme Patriarchs of the Jogye Order have a stance in this debate that is in accordance with [[Seongcheol]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Spread in the United States==
Korean Seon has been spread in the US by [[Seungsahn]]. He was a temple abbot in [[Seoul]] and after living in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Japan]], he moved to the US in 1972, not speaking any English. On the flight to Los Angeles, a Korean American passenger offered him a job at a laundry in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], which became headquarters of Seung Sahn's [[Kwan Um School of Zen]]. Shortly after arriving in Providence, he attracted students and founded the [[Providence Zen Center]]. The Kwan Um School has more than 100 Zen centers on six continents.

[[File:200511241132853328-1-.jpg|thumb|right|upright=.5|[[Kyong Ho]]]]
Another Korean Zen teacher, [[Samu (sunim)|Samu Sunim]], founded [[Toronto]]'s Zen Buddhist Temple in 1971. He is head of the [[Buddhist Society for Compassionate Wisdom]], which has temples in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], [[Chicago]], [[Mexico City]], and [[New York City]].

In the early 20th century, Master [[Kyongho]] (1849–1912), re-energized Korean Seon. At the end of World War II, his disciple, Master Mann Gong (1871–1946), proclaimed that lineage Dharma should be transmitted worldwide to encourage peace through enlightenment. Consequently, his Dharma successor, Hye Am &lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web |title= Hye-Am |url= http://www.buddhism.org/dharma/Hye-Am/Prolegomena.html |accessdate= 2010-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1884–1985) brought lineage Dharma to the United States. Hye Am's Dharma successor, Myo Vong{{sfn|Vong|2008}} founded the Western Son Academy (1976), and his Korean disciple, [[Pohwa]] Sunim, founded World Zen Fellowship (1994) which includes various Zen centers in the United States, such as the Potomac Zen Sangha, the Patriarchal Zen Society and the Baltimore Zen Center.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web |title= World Zen Fellowship |url= http://www.worldzen.org |accessdate= 2010-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[law]] of [[Europe]]''' is diverse and changing fast today. Europe saw the birth of both the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[British Empire]], which form the basis of the two dominant forms of legal system of private law, [[civil law (legal system)|civil]] and [[common law]].

==History==
[[Image:Code Civil 1804.png|thumb|right|150px|First page of the 1804 edition of the [[Napoleonic Code]].]]
The law of Europe has a diverse history. [[Roman law]] underwent major codification in the [[Corpus Juris Civilis]] of Emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]], as later developed through the [[Middle Ages]] by medieval legal scholars. In [[Medieval]] [[England]], judges retained greater power than their continental counterparts and began to develop a body of precedent. Originally civil law was one common legal system in much of [[Europe]], but with the rise of [[nationalism]] in the 17th century [[Nordic countries]] and around the time of the [[French Revolution]], it became fractured into separate national systems. This change was brought about by the development of separate national codes, of which the French [[Napoleonic Code]] and the [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German]] and [[Swiss Civil Code|Swiss codes]] were the most influential. Around this time civil law incorporated many ideas associated with the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. The [[European Union]]'s Law is based on a codified set of laws, laid down in the [[European Union Law|Treaties]]. Law in the EU is however mixed with precedent in case law of the [[European Court of Justice]]. In accordance with its history, the interpretation of European law relies less on policy considerations than U.S. law.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kristoffel Grechenig]] &amp; Martin Gelter, The Transatlantic Divergence in Legal Thought: American Law and Economics vs. German Doctrinalism, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1161168 ''Hastings International and Comparative Law Review 2008, vol. 31, p. 295-360'']; Martin Gelter &amp; [[Kristoffel Grechenig]], [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2421224 ''History of Law and Economics''], forthcoming in Encyclopedia on Law &amp; Economics.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marcel Paquet''' (21 February 1947 &amp;ndash; 22 November 2014) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[philosopher]].
The most important influences on his thought were [[Spinoza]], [[Kant]], [[Hegel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pharefm.be/agenda-id-1453.html|title=Agenda - Conférence  : Spinoza, Philosophe hollandais|website=www.pharefm.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nietzsche]],&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Alvoet, ''Nietzsche et l'Europe: "Nous autres, bons Européens"'', ed. L'Harmattan, 2006, {{p.|100}}, {{ISBN|2296019285}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bellefroid et al, ''Joaquim Vital - esquisses pour un portrait'', éditions de la Différence, 2011, {{p.|96}}, {{ISBN|978-2729119256}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heidegger]] and [[Michel Foucault]].&lt;ref&gt;''Politique de théâtre, morale sartrienne et gracieuse dialectique'', ''Nous autres Européens'', ''op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Paquet rejected all forms of [[Idealism]] in favor of the sensory world. Insofar as he considered human beings to be no more than fragments of [[nature]], thought was considered by him to be the result of cerebral processes which operate largely beneath the level of consciousness. He insisted on the pre-eminence of the body and the fact that, for this reasons, consciousness observes the results of thought, but does not bring them into being.

Inspired by Nietzsche's notion of [[Eternal return#Friedrich Nietzsche|Eternal Recurrence]] - which Paquet treated not as a doctrine but an operational principle, that is as a means of disentangling ourselves from secondary aspects of our identity (determined by cultural, religious and moral factors) in order to recover our primary nature - he considered a return to the body as the sole ethical value.&lt;ref&gt;''Platon, l’éternel retour de la liberté'', ''op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

He developed this [[Spinoza]]n theme in a number of different directions: [[ontology]] (''L'enjeu de la philosophie'', ''Platon: l’éternel retour de la liberté''), [[political philosophy]] (''Nous autres Européens'', ''Le Fascisme Blanc'') and [[esthetics]], the latter in particular in relation to [[painting]] which he defined as the art of rendering the sensory visible.&lt;ref&gt;''Rouge Absolu'', op.cit.&lt;/ref&gt; He is the author of a large number of essays consecrated to visual artists whom he knew personally: [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Alexander Calder]], [[André Masson]], René [[Magritte]], [[Paul Delvaux]], [[Fernando Botero]], Sophia Vari, [[Guillaume Cornelis van Beverloo|Corneille]] (one of the six founders of the [[Cobra (avant-garde movement)|Cobra movement]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_ons003198901_01/_ons003198901_01_0129.php|title=Ons Erfdeel. Jaargang 32 · dbnl|first=|last=DBNL|website=DBNL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bram Bogart, Anna Wilczynska-Wilska, Amann...

He is also the author of several philosophical novels, namely : ''Renaissance sécondaire'', ''Merde à Jésus'', ''L’affaire Socrate'', ''Marie et les Jean''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ladifference.fr/+-paquet-+.html?index=1&amp;titre=P |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201230400/http://www.ladifference.fr/+-paquet-+.html?index=1&amp;titre=P |archivedate=2014-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Poznań]], [[Poland]] on 22 November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wspomnijbliskich.pl/39672362-nekrologi-marcel-paquet{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ladifference.fr/LETTRE-DECEMBRE-2014-IN-MEMORIAM.html#lettre3467 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213092848/http://www.ladifference.fr/LETTRE-DECEMBRE-2014-IN-MEMORIAM.html |date=2014-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Paquet was born in Jumet, near [[Charleroi]].   According to his own account, he had an unhappy childhood. He sought refuge in books, and in particular in Spinoza's [[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]] and in Nietzsche's [[The Antichrist (book)|Antichrist]]. A school trip to [[London]] allowed him to discover the works of [[J. M. W. Turner|William Turner]]; later a visit to [[Amsterdam]] gave rise to his passion for the works of [[Rembrandt]] and [[Van Gogh]] as well as allowing him to meet the [[Situationist International|situationist]] painter and architect [[Constant Nieuwenhuys|Constant]], whose work ''Het Opstand van de Homo ludens'' ("''The uprising of'' [[Homo Ludens (book)|Homo Ludens]]") he translated into French.

He matriculated at the [[Université libre de Bruxelles|Free University of Brussels]] in 1964 and in 1967 became assistant to Professor Pierre Verstraeten. His graduation dissertation dealt with the problem of unity in [[Kant]]'s thought in the [[Critique of Judgment]] (''L’unité problématique du kantisme dans la Critique de la force de juger'').

In 1971, he became a junior associate ("''aspirant''") at the Belgian [[Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique|National Fund for Scientific Research]].

He did research into [[fanaticism]] and published a number of articles including "Essai sur l’absolu" (''Essay on the concept of the Absolute'') which brought him to the attention of French philosopher Gérard Lebrun&lt;ref&gt;G. Lebrun, ''L'envers de la dialectique - Hegel à la lumière de Nietzsche'', éd. du Seuil, Paris, 2004, {{p.|64}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led to a professorship in the history of German Philosophy at the University of Tunis.

It was during his period in Tunis, which lasted from 1972 to 1974, that he wrote his first published work ''L’enjeu de la philosophie'' ("The Question of Philosophy") and he began work on his doctoral dissertation on "The difference between the thought of Kant and Hegel on the question of the essence of art" (''La différence des pensées de Kant et de Hegel dans la question de l’essence de l’art''.&lt;ref&gt;''Botero, Essai d’analyse philosophique'', ''op.cit.'', {{p.|129}} ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, he was one of the founders of the publishing house ''Les Éditions de la Différence''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ladifference.fr/IMG/pdf/catalogue_mars2011.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201230320/http://www.ladifference.fr/IMG/pdf/catalogue_mars2011.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, he obtained his doctorate and continued to work on issues related to painting (René [[Magritte]],&lt;ref&gt;Clara Elizabeth Orban, ed., ''The Culture of Fragments: Word and Images in Futurism and Surrealism'', Ed. Rodopi, Amsterdam, 1997, {{p.|125}}, {{ISBN|90-420-0111-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Delvaux]], [[Fernando Botero]]).

In 1981, he took part, together with [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] in the colloquium "1881: The great year of Zarathustra" organised at the [[Brock University]] of [[St. Catharines|Saint-Catharines]] in [[Canada]]:&lt;ref&gt;M. Paquet, "Nietzsche et l’art moderne", in ''The great year of Zarathoustra (1881-1981)'' ; edited by David Goicoechea, University press of America, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; he made a presentation of his concept of "''dansité''", a play on words which suggests both "innerness" and dance, which was later incorporated into his book ''Magritte ou l’éclipse de l’être''.&lt;ref&gt;''op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

He subsequently took up residence in [[Canada]], where he lived in [[Ontario]] and for a time in [[Quebec]].

In 1988, he taught [[French literature]] at the University of [[Udine]] in [[Italy]].

Upon his return to [[Belgium]], he made the acquaintance of Bram Bogart&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bram-bogart.com/FR/home.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202164238/http://bram-bogart.com/FR/home.htm |archivedate=2014-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitfordfineart.com/artist/biography/3461/bram_bogart |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071411/http://www.whitfordfineart.com/artist/biography/3461/bram_bogart |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in relation to whom he wrote a number of articles.

In Paris in 1990 he met a number of artists of the "[[New New Painters|New New Painting]]" group and developed a theoretical account of their artistic approach, set out in a work published by the publishing house ''Nouvelles éditions françaises''.&lt;ref&gt;''New New Painting'', Nouvelles éditions françaises, Paris, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, he created the "''École européenne de philosophie de Charleroi''". This school organized amongst other things courses on the concept of "ethical conciliation" and on a draft political constitution for [[Wallonia]] which Paquet drew up.&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.lesoir.be/charleroi-richard-miller-ouvre-le-cycle-de-l-ulb-une-no_t-20010530-Z0KHX5.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.lesoir.be/l-ulb-parraine-l-ecole-de-philosophie-de-marcel-paquet-_t-19940527-Z083HN.html|title=L'ULB PARRAINE L'ECOLE DE PHILOSOPHIE DE MARCEL PAQUET, COGITATIONS AU CHATEAU DE MONCEAU - Le Soir|website=lesoir.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, he took up residence in [[Biarritz]]&lt;ref&gt;''Botero, Essai d’analyse philosophique'', ''op.cit'', {{p.|142-154}}&lt;/ref&gt; where in 1997 he married the painter Anna Wilczynska-Wilska.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudouest.fr/2012/05/17/l-artiste-peintre-anna-wilska-exposera-en-chine-717418-727.php|title=L’artiste peintre Anna Wilska exposera en Chine|website=SudOuest.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; He organized a retrospective dedicated to Bram Bogart&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberation.fr/culture/1999/05/08/arts-biarritz-consacre-une-retrospective-a-l-artiste-hollandais-porte-sur-l-analite-biarrot-bogart-r_272366|title=Biarritz consacre une rétrospective à l'artiste hollandais porté sur l'analité.

At the beginning of the 20th century [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists including the pre-cubist [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] revolutionized the Paris art world with "wild", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. Henri Matisse's second version of ''[[The Dance (painting)|The Dance]]'' signifies a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting.&lt;ref&gt;Russell T. Clement.

'''Modernism''' is a philosophical movement that, along with cultural trends and changes, arose from wide-scale and far-reaching transformations in [[Western world|Western society]] during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Among the factors that shaped modernism were the development of modern [[Industrial society|industrial societies]] and the rapid growth of cities, followed then by reactions of horror to [[World War I]]. Modernism also rejected the certainty of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinking, and many modernists rejected religious belief.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pericles Lewis]], ''Modernism, Nationalism, and the Novel'' ([[Cambridge University Press]], 2000). pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[[James Joyce|[James] Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' is a comedy not divine, ending, like Dante's, in the vision of a God whose will is our peace, but human all-too-human...."
Peter Faulkner, ''Modernism'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1990). p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modernism, in general, includes the activities and creations of those who felt the traditional forms of art, architecture, literature, religious faith, philosophy, social organization, activities of daily life, and sciences, were becoming ill-fitted to their tasks and outdated in the new economic, social, and political environment of an emerging fully industrialized world. The poet [[Ezra Pound]]'s 1934 injunction to "Make it new!" was the touchstone of the movement's approach towards what it saw as the now obsolete culture of the past. In this spirit, its innovations, like the [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] novel, [[atonal]] (or pantonal) and [[twelve-tone]] music, [[divisionist]] painting and [[abstract art]], all had precursors in the 19th century.

A notable characteristic of modernism is self-consciousness and irony concerning literary and social traditions, which often led to experiments with form, along with the use of techniques that drew attention to the processes and materials used in creating a painting, poem, building, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Helen, Horst de la Croix, Richard G. Tansey, and Diane Kirkpatrick. ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages'' (San Diego: [[Harcourt Brace Jovanovich]], 1991). {{ISBN|0155037706}}. p. 953.&lt;/ref&gt; Modernism explicitly rejected the ideology of [[Realism (arts)|realism]]&lt;ref name="Barth79Replenishment"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Graff73"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Graff75"/&gt; and makes use of the works of the past by the employment of [[reprise]], [[incorporation (linguistics)|incorporation]], rewriting, [[recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]], revision and [[parody]].&lt;ref name="Eco90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steiner98p489"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Childs2000p17"/&gt;

Some commentators define modernism as a mode of thinking—one or more philosophically defined characteristics, like self-consciousness or self-reference, that run across all the novelties in the arts and the disciplines.&lt;ref name="Everdell"&gt;Everdell, William, ''[[The First Moderns|The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth Century Thought]]'', University of Chicago Press, 1997, {{ISBN|0226224805}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More common, especially in the West, are those who see it as a socially progressive trend of thought that affirms the power of human beings to create, improve and reshape their environment with the aid of practical experimentation, scientific knowledge, or technology.&lt;ref&gt;"In the twentieth century, the social processes that bring this maelstrom into being, and keep it in a state of perpetual becoming, have come to be called 'modernization'. These world-historical processes have nourished an amazing variety of visions and ideas that aim to make men and women the subjects as well as the objects of modernization, to give them the power to change the world that is changing them, to make their way through the maelstrom and make it their own. Over the past century, these visions and values have come to be loosely grouped together under the name of 'modernism'." (Berman 1988, 16)&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, modernism encouraged the re-examination of every aspect of existence, from commerce to philosophy, with the goal of finding that which was 'holding back' [[progress (history)|progress]], and replacing it with new ways of reaching the same end. Others focus on modernism as an aesthetic introspection. This facilitates consideration of specific reactions to the use of technology in the First World War, and anti-technological and nihilistic aspects of the works of diverse thinkers and artists spanning the period from [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900) to [[Samuel Beckett]] (1906–1989).&lt;ref&gt;[[Lee Oser]], ''The Ethics of Modernism: Moral Ideas in Yeats, Eliot, Joyce, Woolf and Beckett'' ([[Cambridge University Press]], 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F.J.

While some scholars see modernism continuing into the twenty first century, others see it evolving into [[late modernism]] or [[high modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;Morris Dickstein, "An Outsider to His Own Life", Books, ''The New York Times'', August 3, 1997; Anthony Mellors, ''Late modernist poetics: From Pound to Prynne''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Postmodernism]] is a departure from modernism and refutes its basic assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/postmodernism|title=postmodernism: definition of postmodernism in Oxford dictionary (American English) (US)|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Reichl, Cook's November 1989; [https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=postmodernism American Heritage Dictionary's definition of "postmodern"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mura |first=Andrea |year=2012 |title=The Symbolic Function of Transmodernity |journal=Language and Psychoanalysis |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=68–87 |url=https://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/Mura%202012.pdf |doi=10.7565/landp.2012.0005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008211951/http://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/Mura%202012.pdf |archivedate=8 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===

According to one critic, modernism developed out of [[Romanticism]]'s revolt against the effects of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and [[bourgeois]] values: "The ground motive of modernism, [[Gerald Graff|Graff]] asserts, was criticism of the nineteenth-century bourgeois social order and its world view [...] the modernists, carrying the torch of romanticism."&lt;ref name="Barth79Replenishment"&gt;Barth (1979) quotation: {{quotation|The ground motive of modernism, Graff asserts, was criticism of the nineteenth-century bourgeois social order and its world view. Its artistic strategy was the self-conscious overturning of the conventions of bourgeois realism [...] the antirationalist, antirealist, antibourgeois program of modernism [...] the modernists, carrying the torch of romanticism, taught us that linearity, rationality, consciousness, cause and effect, naïve illusionism, transparent language, innocent anecdote, and middle-class moral conventions are not the whole story.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graff73"&gt;Graff (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graff75"&gt;Graff (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; While [[J. M. W. Turner]] (1775–1851), one of the greatest landscape painters of the 19th century, was a member of the [[Romantic movement]], as "a pioneer in the study of light, colour, and atmosphere", he "anticipated the [[French Impressionists]]" and therefore modernism "in breaking down conventional formulas of representation; [though] unlike them, he believed that his works should always express significant historical, mythological, literary, or other narrative themes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/610274/J-M-W-Turner| title=J.M.W.

The dominant trends of industrial [[Victorian England]] were opposed, from about 1850, by the English poets and painters that constituted the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]], because of their "opposition to technical skill without inspiration."&lt;ref name=Bloomsbury&gt;''The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature'', ed. Marion Wynne-Davies. New York: Prentice Hall, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|815}} They were influenced by the writings of the art critic [[John Ruskin]] (1819–1900), who had strong feelings about the role of art in helping to improve the lives of the urban working classes, in the rapidly expanding industrial cities of Britain.&lt;ref name=Bloomsbury/&gt;{{rp|816}} Art critic [[Clement Greenberg]] describes the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood as proto-Modernists: "There the proto-Modernists were, of all people, the pre-Raphaelites (and even before them, as proto-proto-Modernists, the German [[Nazarene movement|Nazarenes]]). The Pre-Raphaelites actually foreshadowed [[Manet]] (1832–83), with whom Modernist painting most definitely begins. They acted on a dissatisfaction with painting as practiced in their time, holding that its realism wasn't truthful enough."&lt;ref name=Greenberg&gt;Clement Greenberg, [http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/postmodernism.html "Modern and Postmodern"], William Dobell Memorial Lecture, Sydney, Australia, Oct 31, 1979, Arts 54, No.6 (February 1980)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rationalism]] has also had opponents in the philosophers [[Søren Kierkegaard]] (1813–55)&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{Cite book| chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kierkegaard/| title=Søren Kierkegaard (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)| publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University| chapter=Søren Kierkegaard| year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900), both of whom had significant influence on [[existentialism]].&lt;ref name=Collinson&gt;Diané Collinson, ''Fifty Major Philosophers: A Reference Guide''. London: Routledge, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|120}}

However, the Industrial Revolution continued. Influential innovations included steam-powered industrialization, and especially the development of railways, starting in Britain in the 1830s,&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Hylton (2007). ''The Grand Experiment: The Birth of the Railway Age'' 1820–1845. Ian Allan Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; and the subsequent advancements in physics, engineering, and architecture associated with this. A major 19th-century engineering achievement was [[The Crystal Palace]], the huge cast-iron and plate glass exhibition hall built for [[The Great Exhibition]] of 1851 in London. Glass and iron were used in a similar monumental style in the construction of major railway terminals in [[London]], such as [[Paddington Station]] (1854)&lt;ref&gt;R.V.J. Butt (1995). ''The Directory of Railway Stations''. Yeovil: Patrick Stephens. p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]] (1852).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lner.info/co/GNR/kingscross.shtml| title=LNER Encyclopedia: The Great Northern Railway: Kings Cross Station| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These technological advances led to the building of later structures like the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] (1883) and the [[Eiffel Tower]] (1889). The latter broke all previous limitations on how tall man-made objects could be. These engineering marvels radically altered the 19th-century urban environment and the daily lives of people. The human experience of time itself was altered, with the development of the electric [[telegraph]] from 1837,&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Hubbard (1965), ''Cooke and Wheatstone and the Invention of the Electric Telegraph'', Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, London p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; and the adoption of [[standard time]] by British railway companies from 1845, and in the rest of the world over the next fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;Ian R. Bartky (January 1989). "The adoption of standard time". ''Technology and Culture'' 30 (1): 25–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

But despite continuing technological advances the idea that history and civilization were inherently progressive, and that progress was always good, came under increasing attack in the nineteenth century. Arguments arose that the values of the artist and those of society were not merely different, but that Society was antithetical to Progress, and could not move forward in its present form.  Early in the century, the philosopher [[Schopenhauer]] (1788–1860) (''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', 1819) had called into question the previous optimism, and his ideas had an important influence on later thinkers, including Nietzsche.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt; Two of the most significant thinkers of the mid nineteenth century were biologist [[Charles Darwin]] (1809–1882), author of ''[[On the Origin of Species|On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection]]'' (1859), and political scientist [[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883), author of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' (1867). Darwin's theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] undermined religious certainty and the idea of human uniqueness. In particular, the notion that human beings were driven by the same impulses as "lower animals" proved to be difficult to reconcile with the idea of an ennobling spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'', vol. 2 (7th edition). New York: Norton, 2000, pp. 1051–1052.&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Marx argued that there were fundamental contradictions within the [[capitalist]] system, and that the workers were anything but free.&lt;ref&gt;Craig J. Calhoun (2002). ''Classical Sociological Theory''. Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, pp. 20–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The beginnings in the late nineteenth century===
Historians, and writers in different disciplines, have suggested various dates as starting points for modernism. Historian [[William Everdell]], for example, has argued that modernism began in the 1870s, when metaphorical (or [[ontological]]) continuity began to yield to the discrete with mathematician [[Richard Dedekind]]'s (1831–1916) [[Dedekind cut]], and [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]'s (1844–1906) [[statistical thermodynamics]].&lt;ref name="Everdell" /&gt; Everdell also thinks modernism in painting began in 1885–1886 with [[Seurat]]'s [[Divisionism]], the "dots" used to paint ''[[A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte]]''. On the other hand, visual art critic [[Clement Greenberg]] called [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) "the first real Modernist",&lt;ref&gt;Frascina and Harrison 1982, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; though he also wrote, "What can be safely called Modernism emerged in the middle of the last century—and rather locally, in France, with [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]] in literature and [[Édouard Manet|Manet]] in painting, and perhaps with [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]], too, in prose fiction. (It was a while later, and not so locally, that Modernism appeared in [[Modernism (music)|music]] and [[Modern architecture|architecture]])."&lt;ref name=Greenberg/&gt; The poet Baudelaire's ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]'' (''The Flowers of Evil''), and Flaubert's novel ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' were both published in 1857.

In the arts and letters, two important approaches developed separately in France, beginning in the 1860s. The first was [[Impressionism]], a school of painting that initially focused on work done, not in studios, but outdoors (''[[en plein air]]''). Impressionist paintings demonstrated that human beings do not see objects, but instead see light itself. The school gathered adherents despite internal divisions among its leading practitioners, and became increasingly influential. Initially rejected from the most important commercial show of the time, the government-sponsored [[Paris Salon]], the Impressionists organized yearly group exhibitions in commercial venues during the 1870s and 1880s, timing them to coincide with the official Salon. A significant event of 1863 was the [[Salon des Refusés]], created by [[Napoleon III|Emperor Napoleon&amp;nbsp;III]] to display all of the paintings rejected by the Paris Salon. While most were in standard styles, but by inferior artists, the work of Manet attracted tremendous attention, and opened commercial doors to the movement. The second French school was [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], which literary historians see beginning with Charles Baudelaire (1821–1867), and including the later poets, [[Arthur Rimbaud]] (1854–1891) ''Une Saison en Enfer'' (''A Season in Hell'', 1873), [[Paul Verlaine]] (1844–1896), [[Stéphane Mallarmé]] (1842–1898), and [[Paul Valéry]] (1871–1945). The symbolists "stressed the priority of suggestion and evocation over direct description and explicit analogy," and were especially interested in "the musical properties of language."&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', ed. [[Margaret Drabble]], Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996, p. 966.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Cabaret]], which gave birth to so many of the arts of modernism, including the immediate precursors of film, may be said to have begun in France in 1881 with the opening of the [[Le Chat Noir|Black Cat]] in [[Montmartre]], the beginning of the ironic monologue, and the founding of the Society of Incoherent Arts.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Dennis Cate and Mary Shaw, eds., ''The Spirit of Montmartre: Cabarets, Humor, and the Avant-Garde, 1875–1905''. New Brunswick, NJ: [[Rutgers University]], 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of his friends and colleagues, even fellow painters Henri Matisse and [[Georges Braque]], were upset when they saw this painting.]]
Influential in the early days of modernism were the theories of [[Sigmund Freud]] (1856–1939). Freud's first major work was ''[[Studies on Hysteria]]'' (with [[Josef Breuer]], 1895). Central to Freud's thinking is the idea "of the primacy of the unconscious mind in mental life," so that all subjective reality was based on the play of basic drives and instincts, through which the outside world was perceived. Freud's description of subjective states involved an unconscious mind full of primal impulses, and counterbalancing self-imposed restrictions derived from social values.&lt;ref name=Bloomsbury/&gt;{{rp|538}}

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900) was another major precursor of modernism,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gooding-Williams, "Nietzsche's Pursuit of Modernism",
''New German Critique'', No. 41, Special Issue on the Critiques of the Enlightenment. (Spring–Summer, 1987), pp. 95–108.&lt;/ref&gt; with a philosophy in which psychological drives, specifically the "[[will to power]]" (''Wille zur Macht''), was of central importance: "Nietzsche often identified life itself with 'will to power', that is, with an instinct for growth and durability."&lt;ref&gt;Bernd Magnus, "Friedrich Nietzsche". ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Online Academic Edition. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2013. Web. 19 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/414670/Friedrich-Nietzsche| title=Friedrich Nietzsche| work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri Bergson]] (1859–1941), on the other hand, emphasized the difference between scientific, clock time and the direct, subjective, human experience of time.&lt;ref name=Collinson/&gt;{{rp|131}} His work on time and consciousness "had a great influence on twentieth-century novelists," especially those Modernists who used the [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] technique, such as [[Dorothy Richardson]], [[James Joyce]], and [[Virginia Woolf]] (1882–1941).&lt;ref&gt;''The Bloomsbury Guides to English Literature: The Twentieth Century'', ed. Linda R. Williams. London: Bloomsbury, 1992, pp. 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt; Also important in Bergson's philosophy was the idea of ''élan vital'', the life force, which "brings about the creative evolution of everything."&lt;ref name=Collinson/&gt;{{rp|132}} His philosophy also placed a high value on [[intuition]], though without rejecting the importance of the intellect.&lt;ref name=Collinson/&gt;{{rp|132}}

Important literary precursors of modernism were [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] (1821–1881), who wrote the novels ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' (1866) and ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' (1880);&lt;ref&gt;David Denby, ''New Yorker'', 11 June 2012, "Can Dostoevsky Still Kick You in the Gut?"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walt Whitman]] (1819–1892), who published the poetry collection ''[[Leaves of Grass]]'' (1855–1891); and [[August Strindberg]] (1849–1912), especially his later plays, including the trilogy ''To Damascus'' 1898–1901, ''A Dream Play'' (1902) and ''The Ghost Sonata'' (1907). [[Henry James]] has also been suggested as a significant precursor, in a work as early as ''[[The Portrait of a Lady]]'' (1881).&lt;ref&gt;[[M. H. Abrams]], ''A Glossary of Literary Terms''. New York: Harcourt Brace, 1999), p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of the collision of ideals derived from Romanticism, and an attempt to find a way for knowledge to explain that which was as yet unknown, came the first wave of works in the first decade of the 20th century, which, while their authors considered them extensions of existing trends in art, broke the implicit contract with the general public that artists were the interpreters and representatives of bourgeois culture and ideas. These "Modernist" landmarks include the [[atonality|atonal]] ending of [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s [[String quartets (Schoenberg)|Second String Quartet]] in 1908, the [[Expressionism|expressionist]] paintings of [[Wassily Kandinsky]] starting in 1903, and culminating with his first abstract painting and the founding of the [[Der Blaue Reiter|Blue Rider]] group in [[Munich]] in 1911, and the rise of [[fauvism]] and the inventions of [[cubism]] from the studios of [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Georges Braque]], and others, in the years between 1900 and 1910.

An important aspect of modernism is how it relates to tradition through its adoption of techniques like reprise, incorporation, rewriting, recapitulation, revision and parody in new forms.&lt;ref name="Eco90"&gt;Eco (1990) p. 95 quote:{{quotation|Each of the types of repetition that we have examined is not limited to the mass media but belongs by right to the entire history of artistic creativity; [[plagiarism]], quotation, parody, the ironic retake are typical of the entire artistic-literary tradition.&lt;br&gt;Much art has been and is repetitive. The concept of absolute originality is a contemporary one, born with Romanticism; classical art was in vast measure serial, and the "modern" avant-garde (at the beginning of this century) challenged the Romantic idea of "creation from nothingness," with its techniques of [[collage]], mustachios on the [[Mona Lisa]], art about art, and so on.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steiner98p489"&gt;Steiner (1998) pp. 489–490 quote:{{quotation|(pp. 489–490) The Modernist movement which dominated art, music, letters during the first half of the century was, at critical points, a strategy of conservation, of custodianship. Stravinsky's genius developed through phases of recapitulation. He took from [[Guillaume de Machaut|Machaut]], [[Carlo Gesualdo|Gesualdo]], [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]]. He mimed [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] and [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]], the [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] piano sonatas, the symphonies of [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], the operas of [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi|Pergolesi]] and [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]]. He incorporated [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] and [[Anton Webern|Webern]] into his own idiom. In each instance the listener was meant to recognize the source, to grasp the intent of a transformation which left salient aspects of the original intact. The history of Picasso is marked by retrospection. The explicit variations on classical pastoral themes, the citations from and ''pastiches'' of [[Rembrandt]], [[Francisco Goya|Goya]], [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], Manet, are external products of a constant revision, a 'seeing again' in the light of technical and cultural shifts. Had we only Picasso's sculptures, graphics, and paintings, we could reconstruct a fair portion of the development of the arts from the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] to [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]]. In 20th-century literature, the elements of reprise have been obsessive, and they have organized precisely those texts which at first seemed most revolutionary. ''[[The Waste Land]]'', ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', Pound's ''[[The Cantos|Cantos]]'' are deliberate assemblages, in-gatherings of a cultural past felt to be in danger of dissolution. The long sequence of imitations, translations, masked quotations, and explicit historical paintings in [[Robert Lowell]]'s ''History'' has carried the same technique into the 1970s. [...] In Modernism ''collage'' has been the representative device. The new, even at its most scandalous, has been set against an informing background and framework of tradition. Stravinsky, Picasso, Braque, [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[James Joyce|Joyce]], [[Ezra Pound|Pound]]—the 'makers of the new'—have been neo-classics, often as observant of [[Western canon|canonic]] precedent as their 17th-century forebears.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[T. S. Eliot]] made significant comments on the relation of the artist to tradition, including: "[W]e shall often find that not only the best, but the most individual parts of [a poet's] work, may be those in which the dead poets, his ancestors, assert their immortality most vigorously."&lt;ref name="Eliot19"&gt;[[T. S. Eliot]] "Tradition and the individual talent" (1919), in ''Selected Essays''. Paperback edition. (Faber &amp; Faber, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the relationship of Modernism with tradition was complex, as literary scholar Peter Childs indicates: "There were paradoxical if not opposed trends towards revolutionary and reactionary positions, fear of the new and delight at the disappearance of the old, nihilism and fanatical enthusiasm, creativity and despair."&lt;ref name="Childs2000p17"&gt;Childs, Peter [https://books.google.com/books?id=x_WXXDeXqm4C&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq ''Modernism''] (Routledge, 2000). {{ISBN|0415196477}}. p. 17. Accessed on 8 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of how Modernist art can be both revolutionary and yet be related to past tradition, is the music of the composer [[Arnold Schoenberg]]. On the one hand Schoenberg rejected traditional [[tonality|tonal harmony]], the hierarchical system of organizing works of music that had guided music making for at least a century and a half. He believed he had discovered a wholly new way of organizing sound, based in the use of [[Twelve-tone technique|twelve-note rows]]. Yet while this was indeed wholly new, its origins can be traced back in the work of earlier composers, such as [[Franz Liszt]],&lt;ref&gt;Searle, ''New Grove'', 11:28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Wagner]], [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Richard Strauss]] and [[Max Reger]].&lt;ref&gt;*Anon. 2000.

In the world of art, in the first decade of the 20th century, young painters such as [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Henri Matisse]] were causing a shock with their rejection of traditional [[perspective (visual)|perspective]] as the means of structuring paintings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.henri-matisse.net/biography.html| title=Biography of Henri Matisse| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/themes/cubism| title=MoMA| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the impressionist [[Monet]] had already been innovative in his use of perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cmon/hd_cmon.htm| title=Claude Monet (1840–1926)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, as Picasso was painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', [[Oskar Kokoschka]] was writing ''Mörder, Hoffnung der Frauen'' (''Murderer, Hope of Women''), the first Expressionist play (produced with scandal in 1909), and Arnold Schoenberg was composing his String Quartet No.2 in F sharp minor (1908), his first composition without a tonal centre.

A primary influence that led to [[Cubism]] was the representation of three-dimensional form in the late works of [[Paul Cézanne]], which were displayed in a retrospective at the 1907 [[Salon d'Automne]].&lt;ref name="Christopher Green"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1#skipToContent| title=The Collection| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Cubist artwork, objects are analyzed, broken up and reassembled in an abstracted form; instead of depicting objects from one viewpoint, the artist depicts the subject from a multitude of viewpoints to represent the subject in a greater context.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Metzinger]], ''Note sur la peinture'', Pan (Paris), October–November 1910&lt;/ref&gt; Cubism was brought to the attention of the general public for the first time in 1911 at the [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Salon des Indépendants]] in Paris (held 21 April&amp;nbsp;– 13 June). [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Fernand Léger]] and [[Roger de La Fresnaye]] were shown together in Room 41, provoking a 'scandal' out of which Cubism emerged and spread throughout Paris and beyond. Also in 1911, [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]] painted ''Bild mit Kreis'' (''Picture with a Circle''), which he later called the first abstract painting.&lt;ref name=Sheppard&gt;Richard Sheppard, ''Modernism–Dada–Postmodernism''. Northwestern Univ. Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|167}} In 1912, Metzinger and Gleizes wrote the first (and only) major Cubist manifesto, ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'', published in time for the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]], the largest Cubist exhibition to date. In 1912 Metzinger painted and exhibited his enchanting ''[[La Femme au Cheval]] (Woman with a Horse)'' and ''Danseuse au Café ([[Dancer in a Café]])''. Albert Gleizes painted and exhibited his ''[[Les Baigneuses (Gleizes)|Les Baigneuses (The Bathers)]]'' and his monumental ''Le Dépiquage des Moissons ([[Harvest Threshing]])''. This work, along with ''La Ville de Paris'' (''City of Paris'') by [[Robert Delaunay]], was the largest and most ambitious Cubist painting undertaken during the pre-War Cubist period.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Daniel, ''Albert Gleizes 1881–1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'' (exh. cat.). The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, 1964, pp. 12–25&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, a group of four German artists, led by [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], formed [[Die Brücke]] (the Bridge) in the city of [[Dresden]]. This was arguably the founding organization for the [[German Expressionist]] movement, though they did not use the word itself. A few years later, in 1911, a like-minded group of young artists formed [[Der Blaue Reiter]] (The Blue Rider) in Munich. The name came from [[Wassily Kandinsky]]'s ''Der Blaue Reiter'' painting of 1903. Among their members were Kandinsky, [[Franz Marc]], [[Paul Klee]], and [[August Macke]]. However, the term "Expressionism" did not firmly establish itself until 1913.&lt;ref name=Sheppard/&gt;{{rp|274}} Though initially mainly a German artistic movement,&lt;ref&gt;Note the parallel French movement Fauvism and the English [[Vorticism]]: "The Fauvist movement has been compared to German Expressionism, both projecting brilliant colors and spontaneous brushwork, and indebted to the same late nineteenth-century sources, especially [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]]." Sabine Rewald, "Fauvism". In ''Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History''. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000 [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/fauv/hd_fauv.htm (October 2004); and "Vorticism can be thought of as English Expressionism"]. Sherrill E. Grace, ''Regression and Apocalypse: Studies in North American Literary Expressionism''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1989, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; most predominant in painting, poetry and the theatre between 1910 and 1930, most precursors of the movement were not German. Furthermore, there have been expressionist writers of prose fiction, as well as non-German speaking expressionist writers, and, while the movement had declined in Germany with the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]] in the 1930s, there were subsequent expressionist works.
[[File:Egon Schiele 061.jpg|thumb|left|''Portrait of Eduard Kosmack'' (1910) by [[Egon Schiele]]]]
Expressionism is notoriously difficult to define, in part because it "overlapped with other major 'isms' of the modernist period: with [[Futurism]], [[Vorticism]], [[Cubism]], [[Surrealism]] and [[Dada]]."&lt;ref&gt;Sherrill E. Grace, ''Regression and Apocalypse: Studies in North American Literary Expressionism''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1989, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Murphy also comments: "the search for an all-inclusive definition is problematic to the extent that the most challenging expressionists" such as the novelist [[Franz Kafka]], poet [[Gottfried Benn]], and novelist [[Alfred Döblin]] were simultaneously the most vociferous anti-expressionists.&lt;ref name=Murphy&gt;Richard Murphy, ''Theorizing the Avant-Garde: Modernism, Expressionism, and the Problem of Postmodernity''. Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|43}} What, however, can be said, is that it was a movement that developed in the early 20th century mainly in Germany in reaction to the dehumanizing effect of industrialization and the growth of cities, and that "one of the central means by which expressionism identifies itself as an [[avant-garde]] movement, and by which it marks its distance to traditions and the cultural institution as a whole is through its relationship to [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and the dominant conventions of representation."&lt;ref name=Murphy/&gt;{{rp|43}} More explicitly: that the expressionists rejected the ideology of realism.&lt;ref name=Murphy/&gt;{{rp|43–48}} &lt;ref&gt;Walter H. Sokel, ''The Writer in Extremis''. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 1959, especially Chapter One.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a concentrated Expressionist movement in early 20th century German theatre, of which [[Georg Kaiser]] and [[Ernst Toller]] were the most famous playwrights. Other notable Expressionist dramatists included [[Reinhard Sorge]], [[Walter Hasenclever]], [[Hans Henny Jahnn]], and [[Arnolt Bronnen]]. They looked back to Swedish playwright [[August Strindberg]] and German actor and dramatist [[Frank Wedekind]] as precursors of their [[dramaturgy|dramaturgical]] experiments. [[Oskar Kokoschka]]'s ''[[Murderer, the Hope of Women]]'' was the first fully Expressionist work for the theatre, which opened on 4 July 1909 in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;Berghaus (2005, 55–57).&lt;/ref&gt; The extreme simplification of characters to mythic [[archetype|types]], choral effects, declamatory dialogue and heightened intensity would become characteristic of later Expressionist plays. The first full-length Expressionist play was ''[[The Son (play)|The Son]]'' by Walter Hasenclever, which was published in 1914 and first performed in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Rorrison (1998, 475) and Schürer (1997b, ix, xiv).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Futurism]] is yet another modernist movement. In 1909, the Parisian newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' published [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti|F. T. Marinetti]]'s first manifesto. Soon afterwards a group of painters ([[Giacomo Balla]], [[Umberto Boccioni]], [[Carlo Carrà]], [[Luigi Russolo]], and [[Gino Severini]]) co-signed the [[Futurist Manifesto]]. Modeled on [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]]' famous "[[Communist Manifesto]]" (1848), such manifestoes put forward ideas that were meant to provoke and to gather followers. However, arguments in favor of geometric or purely abstract painting were, at this time, largely confined to "little magazines" which had only tiny circulations. Modernist primitivism and pessimism were controversial, and the mainstream in the first decade of the 20th century was still inclined towards a faith in progress and liberal optimism.

[[Abstract art|Abstract]] artists, taking as their examples the [[impressionists]], as well as [[Paul Cézanne]] (1839–1906) and [[Edvard Munch]] (1863–1944), began with the assumption that color and [[shape]], not the depiction of the natural world, formed the essential characteristics of art.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolph Arnheim, ''Visual Thinking''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Western art]] had been, from the [[Renaissance]] up to the middle of the 19th century, underpinned by the logic of [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] and an attempt to reproduce an illusion of visible reality. The arts of cultures other than the European had become accessible and showed alternative ways of describing visual experience to the artist. By the end of the 19th century many artists felt a need to create a new kind of art which would encompass the fundamental changes taking place in technology, science and philosophy. The sources from which individual artists drew their theoretical arguments were diverse, and reflected the social and intellectual preoccupations in all areas of Western culture at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Mel Gooding, ''Abstract Art'', [[Tate Publishing Ltd|Tate Publishing]], London, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Piet Mondrian]], and [[Kazimir Malevich]] all believed in redefining art as the arrangement of pure color. The use of [[photography]], which had rendered much of the representational function of visual art obsolete, strongly affected this aspect of modernism.&lt;ref name="impressionism758"&gt;Sontag, Susan (1977) On Photography, Penguin, London&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Modern architecture|Modernist architects]] and designers, such as [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Le Corbusier]], believed that new technology rendered old styles of building obsolete. Le Corbusier thought that buildings should function as "machines for living in", analogous to cars, which he saw as machines for traveling in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/137221/Le-Corbusier| title=Le Corbusier| work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as cars had replaced the horse, so modernist design should reject the old styles and structures inherited from [[Ancient Greece]] or from the [[Middle Ages]]. Following this machine aesthetic, modernist designers typically rejected decorative motifs in design, preferring to emphasize the materials used and pure geometrical forms.&lt;ref name="GEMbook"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsa.gov/graphics/pbs/GEMbook.pdf|title=Growth, Efficiency, and Modernism|last=|first=|year=2006|website=|publisher=U.S. General Services Administration|pages=14–15|accessdate=18 February 2017|origyear=2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110331105542/http://www.gsa.gov/graphics/pbs/GEMbook.pdf|archivedate=31 March 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[skyscraper]] is the archetypal modernist building, and the Wainwright Building, a 10-story office building built 1890–91, in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], United States, is among the [[early skyscrapers|first skyscrapers]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;"Skyscraper."

[[File:Pedestal Table in the Studio.jpg|thumb|[[André Masson]], ''Pedestal Table in the Studio'' 1922, early example of [[Surrealism]]]]

In 1913—which was the year of philosopher [[Edmund Husserl]]'s ''Ideas'', physicist [[Niels Bohr]]'s quantized atom, [[Ezra Pound]]'s founding of [[imagism]], the [[Armory Show]] in New York, and in [[Saint Petersburg]] the "first futurist opera", [[Mikhail Matyushin]]'s ''[[Victory over the Sun]]''—another Russian composer, [[Igor Stravinsky]], composed ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', a ballet that depicts [[human sacrifice]], and has a musical score full of dissonance and primitive rhythm. This caused uproar on its first performance in Paris. At this time though modernism was still "progressive", increasingly it saw traditional forms and traditional social arrangements as hindering progress, and was recasting the artist as a revolutionary, engaged in overthrowing rather than enlightening society. Also in 1913 a less violent event occurred in France with the publication of the first volume of [[Marcel Proust]]'s important novel sequence ''[[À la recherche du temps perdu]]'' (1913–1927) (''In Search of Lost Time''). This is often presented as an early example of a writer using the [[stream-of-consciousness technique]], but Robert Humphrey comments that Proust "is concerned only with the reminiscent aspect of consciousness" and that he "was deliberately recapturing the past for the purpose of communicating; hence he did not write a stream-of-consciousness novel."&lt;ref&gt;''Stream of Consciousness in the Modern Novel'' (Berkeley &amp; Los Angeles: University of California, 1954), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stream of consciousness was an important modernist literary innovation, and it has been suggested that [[Arthur Schnitzler]] (1862–1931) was the first to make full use of it in his short story "Leutnant Gustl" ("None but the Brave") (1900).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/133295/stream-of-consciousness Encyclopædia Britannica Online, ''Stream of Consciousness'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dorothy Richardson]] was the first English writer to use it, in the early volumes of her [[novel sequence]] ''[[Pilgrimage (novel sequence)|Pilgrimage]]'' (1915–67).&lt;ref&gt;In a review of these novels, in ''The Egoist'', April 1918, [[May Sinclair]] first applied the term "stream of consciousness" in a literary context, in her discussion of Richardson's stylistic innovations.&lt;/ref&gt; The other modernist novelists that are associated with the use of this narrative technique include [[James Joyce]] in ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922) and [[Italo Svevo]] in ''[[Zeno's Conscience|La coscienza di Zeno]]'' (1923).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weiss|first=Beno|date=1990|title=Review of Italo Svevo: A Double Life|journal=Italica|volume=67|issue=3|pages=395–400|doi=10.2307/478649|jstor=478649|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, with the coming of the [[World War I|Great War]] of 1914–18 and the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, the world was drastically changed and doubt cast on the beliefs and institutions of the past. The failure of the previous status quo seemed self-evident to a generation that had seen millions die fighting over scraps of earth: prior to 1914 it had been argued that no one would fight such a war, since the cost was too high. The birth of a machine age which had made major changes in the conditions of daily life in the 19th century now had radically changed the nature of warfare. The traumatic nature of recent experience altered basic assumptions, and realistic depiction of life in the arts seemed inadequate when faced with the fantastically surreal nature of [[trench warfare]]. The view that mankind was making steady moral progress now seemed ridiculous in the face of the senseless slaughter, described in works such as [[Erich Maria Remarque]]'s novel ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front]]'' (1929). Therefore, modernism's view of reality, which had been a minority taste before the war, became more generally accepted in the 1920s.

In literature and visual art some Modernists sought to defy expectations mainly in order to make their art more vivid, or to force the audience to take the trouble to question their own preconceptions. This aspect of modernism has often seemed a reaction to [[consumerism|consumer culture]], which developed in Europe and North America in the late 19th century. Whereas most manufacturers try to make products that will be marketable by appealing to preferences and prejudices, [[high modernism|high modernists]] rejected such consumerist attitudes in order to undermine conventional thinking. The art critic [[Clement Greenberg]] expounded this theory of modernism in his essay ''[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Clement Greenberg]], ''Art and Culture,'' Beacon Press, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg labeled the products of consumer culture "[[kitsch]]", because their design aimed simply to have maximum appeal, with any difficult features removed. For Greenberg, modernism thus formed a reaction against the development of such examples of modern consumer culture as commercial [[popular music]], [[Film|Hollywood]], and advertising. Greenberg associated this with the revolutionary rejection of capitalism.

Some Modernists saw themselves as part of a revolutionary culture that included political revolution. In [[Russia]] after the 1917 [[Russian Revolution|Revolution]] there was indeed initially a burgeoning of avant-garde cultural activity, which included [[Russian Futurism]]. However others rejected conventional politics as well as artistic conventions, believing that a revolution of [[political consciousness]] had greater importance than a change in political structures. But many modernists saw themselves as apolitical. Others, such as [[T. S. Eliot]], rejected mass [[popular culture]] from a conservative position. Some even argue that modernism in literature and art functioned to sustain an [[elitism|elite]] culture which excluded the majority of the population.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Surrealism]], which originated in the early 1920s, came to be regarded by the public as the most extreme form of modernism, or "the avant-garde of Modernism".&lt;ref name="DebordSurrealismModernism"&gt;[[Guy Debord]], 18 November 1958, as quoted in [http://www.notbored.org/surrealism.html ''Supreme Height of the Defenders of Surrealism in Paris and the Revelation of their Real Value''], Situationist International #2&lt;/ref&gt; The word "surrealist" was coined by [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] and first appeared in the preface to his play ''[[The Breasts of Tiresias|Les Mamelles de Tirésias]]'', which was written in 1903 and first performed in 1917. Major surrealists include [[Paul Éluard]], [[Robert Desnos]],&lt;ref name="Diary of a Genius"&gt;[[Salvador Dalí|Dalí, Salvador]], ''[http://www.bartleby.com/66/82/15682.html Diary of a Genius]'' quoted in ''The Columbia World of Quotations'' (1996) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406060625/http://www.bartleby.com/66/82/15682.html |date=6 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Ernst]], [[Hans Arp]], [[Antonin Artaud]], [[Raymond Queneau]], [[Joan Miró]], and [[Marcel Duchamp]].&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Dawn Ades, with Matthew Gale: "Surrealism", ''The Oxford Companion to Western Art''.

By 1930, Modernism had won a place in the establishment, including the political and artistic establishment, although by this time Modernism itself had changed.

===Modernism continues: 1930–1945===
Modernism continued to evolve during the 1930s. Between 1930 and 1932 composer [[Arnold Schoenberg]] worked on ''[[Moses und Aron]]'', one of the first operas to make use of the [[twelve-tone technique]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Schoenberg, Arnold (1874 - 1951), composer : Grove Music Online - oi|volume=1|language=en|doi=10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.25024|year=2001|last1=Neighbour|first1=O.W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pablo Picasso painted in 1937 ''[[Guernica (Picasso)|Guernica]]'', his cubist condemnation of [[fascism]], while in 1939 [[James Joyce]] pushed the boundaries of the modern novel further with ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''. Also by 1930 Modernism began to influence mainstream culture, so that, for example,  ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine began publishing work, influenced by Modernism, by young writers and humorists like [[Dorothy Parker]],&lt;ref&gt;Caren Irr, "A Gendered Collision: Sentimentalism and Modernism in Dorothy Parker's Poetry and Fiction" (review). ''American Literature'', Volume 73, Number 4, December 2001 pp. 880–881.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Benchley]], [[E. B. White]], [[S. J. Perelman]], and [[James Thurber]], amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Keyser, "Robert Benchley and Dorothy Parker 'In Broadway Playhouses': Middlebrow Theatricality and Sophisticated Humour". ''Modernist Cultures'', Volume 6, pp. 121–154.&lt;/ref&gt; Perelman is highly regarded for his humorous short stories that he published in magazines in the 1930s and 1940s, most often in ''The New Yorker'', which are considered to be the first examples of [[surrealist humor]] in America.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Barthelme]], 1982 interview in ''[[Partisan Review]]'', Volume 49, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern ideas in art also began to appear more frequently in commercials and logos, an early example of which, from 1916, is the famous [[London Underground]] logo designed by [[Edward Johnston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.20thcenturylondon.org.uk/server.php?show=conObject.2902 |work=Exploring 20th Century London |publisher=Renaissance London/[[Museums, Libraries and Archives Council|MLA]] |title=A full alphabet of Johnston wood letter types |accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most visible changes of this period was the adoption of new technologies into daily life of ordinary people in Western Europe and North America. Electricity, the telephone, the radio, the automobile—and the need to work with them, repair them and live with them—created social change. The kind of disruptive moment that only a few knew in the 1880s became a common occurrence. For example, the speed of communication reserved for the stock brokers of 1890 became part of family life, at least in middle class North America. Associated with urbanization and changing social mores also came smaller families and changed relationships between parents and their children.

[[File:Underground.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|thumb|[[London Underground]] logo designed by [[Edward Johnston]]. This is modern version (with minor modifications) of one that was first used in 1916.]]
Another strong influence at this time was [[Marxism]]. After the generally primitivistic/irrationalist aspect of pre-World War I Modernism, which for many Modernists precluded any attachment to merely political solutions, and the [[neoclassicism]] of the 1920s, as represented most famously by [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]]—which rejected popular solutions to modern problems—the rise of [[Fascism]], the [[Great Depression]], and the march to war helped to radicalise a generation. [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[W. H. Auden]], [[André Breton]], [[Louis Aragon]] and the philosophers [[Antonio Gramsci]] and [[Walter Benjamin]] are perhaps the most famous exemplars of this Modernist form of Marxism. There were, however, also Modernists explicitly of 'the right', including [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Wyndham Lewis]], T. S. Eliot, [[Ezra Pound]], the Dutch author [[Menno ter Braak]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Pericles Lewis, "Modernist Writing and Reactionary Politics" (review). ''Modernism/modernity'', Volume 8, Number 4, November 2001, pp. 696–698.&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant Modernist literary works continued to be created in the 1920s and 1930s, including further novels by [[Marcel Proust]], [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Robert Musil]], and [[Dorothy Richardson]]. The American Modernist dramatist [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s career began in 1914, but his major works appeared in the 1920s, 1930s and early 1940s. Two other significant Modernist dramatists writing in the 1920s and 1930s were [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Federico García Lorca]]. [[D. H. Lawrence]]'s ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' was privately published in 1928, while another important landmark for the history of the modern novel came with the publication of [[William Faulkner]]'s ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]'' in 1929. In the 1930s, in addition to further major works by Faulkner, [[Samuel Beckett]] published his first major work, the novel ''[[Murphy (novel)|Murphy]]'' (1938). Then in 1939 James Joyce's ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' appeared. This is written in a largely [[idioglossia|idiosyncratic language]], consisting of a mixture of standard English [[lexical item]]s and [[Neologism|neologistic]] [[multilingual]] [[pun]]s and [[portmanteau]] words, which attempts to recreate the experience of sleep and dreams.&lt;ref&gt;James Mercanton (1967). ''Les heures de James Joyce''. Diffusion PUF.&lt;/ref&gt; In poetry T. S. Eliot, [[E. E. Cummings]], and [[Wallace Stevens]] were writing from the 1920s until the 1950s. While Modernist poetry in English is often viewed as an American phenomenon, with leading exponents including Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, [[Marianne Moore]], [[William Carlos Williams]], [[H.D.]], and [[Louis Zukofsky]], there were important British Modernist poets, including [[David Jones (artist-poet)|David Jones]], [[Hugh MacDiarmid]], [[Basil Bunting]], and [[W. H. Auden]]. European Modernist poets include [[Federico García Lorca]], [[Anna Akhmatova]], [[Constantine Cavafy]], and [[Paul Valéry]].

The Modernist movement continued during this period in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]]. In 1930 composer [[Dimitri Shostakovich]]'s (1906–1975) opera ''[[The Nose (opera)|The Nose]]'' was premiered, in which he uses a [[Musical montage|montage]] of different styles, including [[folk music]], [[popular song]] and [[atonality]]. Amongst his influences was [[Alban Berg]]'s (1985–1935) opera ''[[Wozzeck]]'' (1925), which "had made a tremendous impression on Shostakovich when it was staged in Leningrad."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boosey.com/pages/opera/moreDetails.asp?musicID=896 Note by Gerard McBurney on ''The Nose'']&lt;/ref&gt; However, from 1932 [[Socialist realism]] began to oust Modernism in the Soviet Union,&lt;ref&gt;Sergei V.

Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995, pp. 541–545.&lt;/ref&gt; Alban Berg wrote another significant, though incomplete, Modernist opera, ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'', which premiered in 1937. Berg's [[Violin Concerto (Berg)|Violin Concerto]] was first performed in 1935. Like Shostakovich, other composers faced difficulties in this period. In Germany [[Arnold Schoenberg]] (1874–1951) was forced to flee to the U.S. when Hitler came to power in 1933, because of his Modernist [[atonal]] style as well as his Jewish ancestry.&lt;ref name="Oxford Music Online"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com|title=Home Page in Oxford Music Online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His major works from this period are a [[Violin Concerto (Schoenberg)|Violin Concerto]], Op. 36 (1934/36), and [[Piano Concerto (Schoenberg)|Piano Concerto]], Op. 42 (1942). Schoenberg also wrote tonal music in this period with the Suite for Strings in G major (1935) and the [[Chamber Symphony No. 2 (Schoenberg)|Chamber Symphony No. 2]] in E{{music|flat}} minor, Op. 38 (begun in 1906, completed in 1939).&lt;ref name="Oxford Music Online" /&gt; During this time Hungarian Modernist [[Béla Bartók]] (1881–1945) produced a number of major works, including ''[[Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta]]'' (1936) and the ''[[Divertimento for String Orchestra (Bartók)|Divertimento for String Orchestra]]'' (1939), [[String Quartet No. 5 (Bartók)|String Quartet No. 5]] (1934), and [[String Quartet No. 6 (Bartók)|No. 6]] (his last, 1939). But he too left for the US in 1940, because of the rise of [[fascism]] in Hungary.&lt;ref name="Oxford Music Online" /&gt; [[Igor Stravinsky]] (1882–1971) continued writing in his [[neoclassical style]] during the 1930s and 1940s, writing works like the ''[[Symphony of Psalms]]'' (1930), [[Symphony in C (Stravinsky)|Symphony in C]] (1940) and ''[[Symphony in Three Movements (Stravinsky)|Symphony in Three Movements]]'' (1945). He also emigrated to the US because of World War II. [[Olivier Messiaen]] (1908–1992), however, served in the French army during the war and was imprisoned at [[Stalag VIII-A]] by the Germans, where he composed his famous ''[[Quatuor pour la fin du temps]]'' ("Quartet for the End of Time"). The quartet was first performed in January 1941 to an audience of prisoners and prison guards.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Rischin. ''For the End of Time: The Story of the Messiaen Quartet''. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 2003, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In painting, during the 1920s and the 1930s and the [[Great Depression]], modernism is defined by [[Surrealism]], late [[Cubism]], [[Bauhaus]], [[De Stijl]], [[Dada]], German [[Expressionism]], and Modernist and masterful color painters like [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pierre Bonnard]] as well as the abstractions of artists like [[Piet Mondrian]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]] which characterized the European art scene. In Germany, [[Max Beckmann]], [[Otto Dix]], [[George Grosz]] and others politicized their paintings, foreshadowing the coming of World War II, while in America, modernism is seen in the form of [[American Scene painting]] and the [[social realism]] and [[regionalism (art)|regionalism]] movements that contained both political and social commentary dominated the art world. Artists like [[Ben Shahn]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], [[Grant Wood]], [[George Tooker]], [[John Steuart Curry]], [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], and others became prominent. Modernism is defined in [[Latin America]] by painters [[Joaquín Torres García]] from Uruguay and [[Rufino Tamayo]] from Mexico, while the [[Mexican muralism|muralist movement]] with [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Siqueiros]], [[José Clemente Orozco]], [[Pedro Nel Gómez]] and [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]], and [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] paintings by [[Frida Kahlo]], began a renaissance of the arts for the region, characterized by a freer use of color and an emphasis on political messages.

Diego Rivera is perhaps best known by the public world for his 1933 mural, ''[[Man at the Crossroads]]'', in the lobby of the RCA Building at [[Rockefeller Center]]. When his patron [[Nelson Rockefeller]] discovered that the mural included a portrait of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and other communist imagery, he fired Rivera, and the unfinished work was eventually destroyed by Rockefeller's staff. Frida Kahlo's (Rivera's wife's) works are often characterized by their stark portrayals of pain. Kahlo was deeply influenced by indigenous Mexican culture, which is apparent in her paintings' bright colors and dramatic symbolism. Christian and Jewish themes are often depicted in her work as well; she combined elements of the classic religious Mexican tradition, which were often bloody and violent. Frida Kahlo's Symbolist works relate strongly to Surrealism and to the [[Magic Realism]] movement in literature.

Political activism was an important piece of David Siqueiros' life, and frequently inspired him to set aside his artistic career. His art was deeply rooted in the [[Mexican Revolution]]. The period from the 1920s to the 1950s is known as the Mexican Renaissance, and Siqueiros was active in the attempt to create an art that was at once Mexican and universal. The young [[Jackson Pollock]] attended the workshop and helped build [[float (parade)|floats]] for the parade.

During the 1930s radical leftist politics characterized many of the artists connected to Surrealism, including [[Pablo Picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Helena. ''Dada Turns Red''. 1990. University of Edinburgh Press. A history of the uneasy relations between Surrealists and Communists from the 1920s through the 1950s.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 April 1937, during the [[Spanish Civil War]], the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] town of [[Gernika]] was [[Bombing of Guernica|bombed]] by Nazi Germany's Luftwaffe. The Germans were attacking to support the efforts of [[Francisco Franco]] to overthrow the Basque government and the Spanish Republican government. Pablo Picasso painted his mural-sized ''[[Guernica (Picasso)|Guernica]]'' to commemorate the horrors of the bombing.
[[File:PicassoGuernica.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.6|[[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''[[Guernica (Picasso)|Guernica]]'', 1937, protest against Fascism]]

During the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s and through the years of World War II, American art was characterized by [[Social Realism]] and [[American Scene Painting]], in the work of [[Grant Wood]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Ben Shahn]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], and several others. ''[[Nighthawks]]'' (1942) is a painting by Edward Hopper that portrays people sitting in a downtown diner late at night. It is not only Hopper's most famous painting, but one of the most recognizable in American art. The scene was inspired by a diner in [[Greenwich Village]]. Hopper began painting it immediately after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. After this event there was a large feeling of gloominess over the country, a feeling that is portrayed in the painting. The urban street is empty outside the diner, and inside none of the three patrons is apparently looking or talking to the others but instead is lost in their own thoughts. This portrayal of modern urban life as empty or lonely is a common theme throughout Hopper's work.

''[[American Gothic]]'' is a painting by [[Grant Wood]] from 1930. Portraying a [[pitchfork]]-holding farmer and a younger woman in front of a house of [[Carpenter Gothic]] style, it is one of the most familiar images in 20th-century [[Visual art of the United States|American art]]. Art critics had favorable opinions about the painting; like [[Gertrude Stein]] and [[Christopher Morley]], they assumed the painting was meant to be a satire of rural small-town life. It was thus seen as part of the trend towards increasingly critical depictions of rural America, along the lines of [[Sherwood Anderson]]'s 1919 ''[[Winesburg, Ohio]]'', [[Sinclair Lewis]]'s 1920 ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'', and [[Carl Van Vechten]]'s ''The Tattooed Countess'' in literature.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;Fineman, Mia, [http://www.slate.com/id/2120494/ The Most Famous Farm Couple in the World: Why American Gothic still fascinates.], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', 8 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the onset of the Great Depression, the painting came to be seen as a depiction of steadfast American pioneer spirit.

The situation for artists in Europe during the 1930s deteriorated rapidly as the Nazis' power in Germany and across Eastern Europe increased. ''[[Degenerate art]]'' was a term adopted by the [[Nazi]] regime in Germany for virtually all [[modern art]]. Such art was banned on the grounds that it was un-German or [[Jewish Bolshevism|Jewish Bolshevist]] in nature, and those identified as degenerate artists were subjected to sanctions. These included being dismissed from teaching positions, being forbidden to exhibit or to sell their art, and in some cases being forbidden to produce art entirely. [[Degenerate Art Exhibition|Degenerate Art]] was also the title of an exhibition, mounted by the Nazis in [[Munich]] in 1937. The climate became so hostile for artists and art associated with modernism and [[Abstract art|abstraction]] that many left for the Americas. German artist [[Max Beckmann]] and scores of others fled Europe for New York. In New York City a new generation of young and exciting Modernist painters led by [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Willem de Kooning]], and others were just beginning to come of age.

Arshile Gorky's portrait of someone who might be Willem de Kooning is an example of the evolution of [[abstract expressionism]] from the context of figure painting, cubism and surrealism. Along with his friends de Kooning and [[John D. Graham]], Gorky created biomorphically shaped and abstracted figurative compositions that by the 1940s evolved into totally abstract paintings. Gorky's work seems to be a careful analysis of memory, emotion and shape, using line and color to express feeling and nature.

===Introduction===
While ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature'' states that modernism ended by c. 1939&lt;ref name="British Literature' 2006"&gt;J. H. Dettmar, "Modernism", in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature'', ed. David Scott Kastan. Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; with regard to British and American literature, "When (if) Modernism petered out and postmodernism began has been contested almost as hotly as when the transition from Victorianism to Modernism occurred."&lt;ref&gt;"Modernism", in ''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', ed. Dinah Birch. Oxford University Press Inc. Oxford Reference Online.&lt;/ref&gt;  Clement Greenberg sees modernism ending in the 1930s, with the exception of the visual and performing arts,&lt;ref name=Greenberg/&gt; but with regard to music, [[Paul Griffiths (writer)|Paul Griffiths]] notes that, while Modernism "seemed to be a spent force" by the late 1920s, after World War II, "a new generation of composers—[[Pierre Boulez|Boulez]], [[Jean Barraqué|Barraqué]], [[Milton Babbitt|Babbitt]], [[Luigi Nono|Nono]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen|Stockhausen]], [[Iannis Xenakis|Xenakis]]" revived modernism".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Griffiths, "Modernism", ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', ed. Alison Latham. Oxford University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact many literary Modernists lived into the 1950s and 1960s, though generally they were no longer producing major works. The term "[[late modernism]]" is also sometimes applied to Modernist works published after 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Cheryl Hindrichs, "Late Modernism, 1928–1945: Criticism and Theory", ''Literature Compass'', Volume 8, Issue 11, pp. 840–855, November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Dettmar, "Modernism", ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature'', ed. David Scott Kastan. Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Among Modernists (or late Modernists) still publishing after 1945 were [[Wallace Stevens]], [[Gottfried Benn]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Anna Akhmatova]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Dorothy Richardson]], [[John Cowper Powys]], and [[Ezra Pound]]. [[Basil Bunting]], born in 1901, published his most important Modernist poem ''[[Briggflatts]]'' in 1965. In addition, [[Hermann Broch]]'s ''[[The Death of Virgil]]'' was published in 1945 and [[Thomas Mann]]'s ''[[Doctor Faustus (novel)|Doctor Faustus]]'' in 1947. [[Samuel Beckett]], who died in 1989, has been described as a "later Modernist".&lt;ref&gt;Morris Dickstein, "An Outsider to His Own Life", Books, ''The New York Times'', 3 August 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Beckett is a writer with roots in the [[expressionist]] tradition of Modernism, who produced works from the 1930s until the 1980s, including ''[[Molloy (novel)|Molloy]]'' (1951), ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' (1953), ''[[Happy Days (play)|Happy Days]]'' (1961), and ''[[Rockaby]]'' (1981). The terms "[[minimalist]]" and "[[post-Modernist]]" have also been applied to his later works.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Companion to Irish Literature'', ed. John Wilson Foster. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The poets [[Charles Olson]] (1910–1970) and [[J. H. Prynne]] (born 1936) are among the writers in the second half of the 20th century who have been described as late Modernists.&lt;ref&gt;''Late Modernist Poetics: From Pound to Prynne'' by Anthony Mellors; see also Prynne's publisher, Bloodaxe Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently the term "late modernism" has been redefined by at least one critic and used to refer to works written after 1945, rather than 1930. With this usage goes the idea that the ideology of modernism was significantly re-shaped by the events of [[World War II]], especially [[the Holocaust]] and the dropping of the atom bomb.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Mellors, ''Late Modernist Poetics: From Pound to Prynne''&lt;/ref&gt;

The postwar period left the capitals of Europe in upheaval with an urgency to economically and physically rebuild and to politically regroup. In [[Paris]] (the former center of European culture and the former capital of the art world) the climate for art was a disaster. Important collectors, dealers, and Modernist artists, writers, and poets had fled Europe for New York and America. The [[surrealists]] and modern artists from every cultural center of Europe had fled the onslaught of the Nazis for safe haven in the United States. Many of those who didn't flee perished. A few artists, notably [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], and [[Pierre Bonnard]], remained in France and survived.

The 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American [[abstract expressionism]], a Modernist movement that combined lessons learned from Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, surrealism, [[Joan Miró]], cubism, [[Fauvism]], and early modernism via great teachers in America like [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[John D. Graham]]. American artists benefited from the presence of [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Max Ernst]] and the [[André Breton]] group, [[Pierre Matisse]]'s gallery, and [[Peggy Guggenheim]]'s gallery ''[[The Art of This Century]]'', as well as other factors.

Paris, moreover, recaptured much of its luster in the 1950s and 60s as the center of a machine art florescence, with both of the leading machine art sculptors [[Jean Tinguely]] and [[Nicolas Schöffer]] having moved there to launch their careers—and which florescence, in light of the technocentric character of modern life, may well have a particularly long lasting influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.mdpi.com/2076-0752/7/1/4|author=Juliette Bessette|date=23 January 2018|title=The Machine as Art (in the 20th Century): An Introduction|journal=Arts|volume=7|page=4|doi=10.3390/arts7010004|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre of the Absurd===
[[File:En attendant Godot, Festival d'Avignon, 1978.jpeg|left|thumb|Samuel Beckett's ''[[En attendant Godot]]'', (''Waiting for Godot'') Festival d'Avignon, 1978]]
The term "[[Theatre of the Absurd]]" is applied to plays, written primarily by Europeans, that express the belief that human existence has no meaning or purpose and therefore all communication breaks down. Logical construction and argument gives way to irrational and illogical speech and to its ultimate conclusion, silence.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hutchinson Encyclopedia'', Millennium Edition, Helicon 1999&lt;/ref&gt; While there are significant precursors, including [[Alfred Jarry]] (1873–1907), the Theatre of the Absurd is generally seen as beginning in the 1950s with the plays of [[Samuel Beckett]].

Critic [[Martin Esslin]] coined the term in his 1960 essay "Theatre of the Absurd". He related these plays based on a broad theme of the Absurd, similar to the way [[Albert Camus]] uses the term in his 1942 essay, ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/Slavonic/Absurd.htm University of Glasgow, School of Modern Languages and Cultures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823075755/http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/Slavonic/Absurd.htm |date=23 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Absurd in these plays takes the form of man's reaction to a world apparently without meaning, and/or man as a puppet controlled or menaced by invisible outside forces. Though the term is applied to a wide range of plays, some characteristics coincide in many of the plays: broad comedy, often similar to [[vaudeville]], mixed with horrific or tragic images; characters caught in hopeless situations forced to do repetitive or meaningless actions; dialogue full of clichés, wordplay, and nonsense; plots that are cyclical or absurdly expansive; either a parody or dismissal of realism and the concept of the "[[well-made play]]".

Playwrights commonly associated with the Theatre of the Absurd include [[Samuel Beckett]] (1906–1989), [[Eugène Ionesco]] (1909–1994), [[Jean Genet]] (1910–1986), [[Harold Pinter]] (1930–2008), [[Tom Stoppard]] (born 1937), [[Alexander Vvedensky (poet)|Alexander Vvedensky]] (1904–1941), [[Daniil Kharms]] (1905–1942), [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]] (1921–1990), [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]] (born 1929), [[Fernando Arrabal]] (born 1932), [[Václav Havel]] (1936–2011) and [[Edward Albee]] (1928–2016).

===Pollock and abstract influences===
During the late 1940s [[Jackson Pollock]]'s radical approach to painting revolutionized the potential for all [[contemporary art]] that followed him. To some extent Pollock realized that the journey toward making a work of art was as important as the work of art itself. Like [[Pablo Picasso]]'s innovative reinventions of painting and sculpture in the early 20th century via [[Cubism]] and constructed [[sculpture]], Pollock redefined the way art is made. His move away from easel painting and conventionality was a liberating signal to the artists of his era and to all who came after. Artists realized that Jackson Pollock's process—placing unstretched raw [[canvas]] on the floor where it could be attacked from all four sides using artistic and industrial materials; dripping and throwing linear skeins of paint; drawing, staining, and brushing; using imagery and nonimagery—essentially blasted artmaking beyond any prior boundary. Abstract expressionism generally expanded and developed the definitions and possibilities available to artists for the creation of new works of art.
The other [[abstract expressionists]] followed Pollock's breakthrough with new breakthroughs of their own. In a sense the innovations of Jackson Pollock, [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Peter Voulkos]] and others opened the floodgates to the diversity and scope of all the art that followed them. Rereadings into abstract art by art historians such as [[Linda Nochlin]],&lt;ref&gt;Nochlin, Linda, Ch.1 in: ''Women Artists at the Millennium'' (edited by C. Armstrong and C. de Zegher) MIT Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Griselda Pollock]]&lt;ref&gt;Pollock, Griselda, ''Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum: Time, Space and the Archive''. Routledge, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Catherine de Zegher]]&lt;ref&gt;De Zegher, Catherine, and Teicher, Hendel (eds.), ''3 X Abstraction''. New Haven: Yale University Press. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; critically show, however, that pioneering women artists who produced major innovations in modern art had been ignored by official accounts of its history.

===International figures from British art===
[[Henry Moore]] (1898–1986) emerged after [[World War II]] as Britain's leading [[Sculpture|sculptor]]. He was best known for his semi-[[abstract art|abstract]] monumental bronze sculptures which are located around the world as public works of art. His forms are usually abstractions of the human figure, typically depicting mother-and-child or reclining figures, usually suggestive of the female body, apart from a phase in the 1950s when he sculpted family groups. His forms are generally pierced or contain hollow spaces.
[[File:Moore_Große_liegende_Frauenfigur_1957_Zürich.jpg|thumb|right|[[Henry Moore]], ''Reclining Figure'' (1957). In front of the [[Kunsthaus Zürich]], Switzerland.]]

In the 1950s, Moore began to receive increasingly significant commissions, including a reclining figure for the [[UNESCO]] building in Paris in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.unesco.org/artcollection/DetailAction.do?&amp;idOeuvre=1547&amp;nouvelleLangue=en Moore, Henry]". [[UNESCO]]. Retrieved on 16 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; With many more public works of art, the scale of Moore's sculptures grew significantly. The last three decades of Moore's life continued in a similar vein, with several major retrospectives taking place around the world, notably a prominent exhibition in the summer of 1972 in the grounds of the [[Belvedere (fort)|Forte di Belvedere]] overlooking [[Florence]]. By the end of the 1970s, there were some 40 exhibitions a year featuring his work. On the campus of the [[University of Chicago]] in December 1967, 25 years to the minute after the team of physicists led by [[Enrico Fermi]] achieved the first controlled, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction, Moore's ''[[Nuclear Energy (sculpture)|Nuclear Energy]]'' was unveiled.&lt;ref&gt;2 December 1967.

''Henry Moore: Space, Sculpture, Politics''. Burlington, Vermont: Ashgate, 2003. p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in Chicago, Moore commemorated science with a large bronze sundial, locally named ''[[Man Enters the Cosmos]]'' (1980), which was commissioned to recognise the [[space exploration]] program.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:20070701 Man Enters The Cosmos Explanatory Plaques.JPG|Enscripted on the plaque at the base of the sculpture]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The "London School" of figurative painters, including [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] (1909–1992), [[Lucian Freud]] (1922–2011), [[Frank Auerbach]] (born 1931), [[Leon Kossoff]] (born 1926), and [[Michael Andrews (artist)|Michael Andrews]] (1928–1995), have received widespread international recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, 219–225&lt;/ref&gt;

Francis Bacon was an Irish-born British figurative painter known for his bold, graphic and emotionally raw imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Harrison, ''In Camera: Francis Bacon: Photography, Film and the Practice of Painting'', London: Thames and Hudson, 2006, 7&lt;/ref&gt; His painterly but abstracted figures typically appear isolated in glass or steel geometrical cages set against flat, nondescript backgrounds. Bacon began painting during his early 20s but worked only sporadically until his mid-30s. His breakthrough came with the 1944 [[triptych]] ''[[Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion]]'' which sealed his reputation as a uniquely bleak chronicler of the human condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/francis_bacon/index.html?inline=nyt-per| title=Francis Bacon| author=Ken Johnson| date=3 December 2015| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His output can be crudely described as consisting of sequences or variations on a single motif; beginning with the 1940s male heads isolated in rooms, the early 1950s screaming popes, and mid to late 1950s animals and lone figures suspended in geometric structures. These were followed by his early 1960s modern variations of the crucifixion in the triptych format. From the mid-1960s to early 1970s, Bacon mainly produced strikingly compassionate portraits of friends. Following the suicide of his lover George Dyer in 1971, his art became more personal, inward-looking, and preoccupied with themes and motifs of death. During his lifetime, Bacon was equally reviled and acclaimed.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', "Obituary", 29 April 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lucian Freud]] was a German-born British painter, known chiefly for his thickly [[impasto]]ed portrait and figure paintings, who was widely considered the pre-eminent British artist of his time.&lt;ref name=Grimes&gt;William Grimes.

Ordinary people—many of them his friends—stared wide-eyed from the canvas, vulnerable to the artist's ruthless inspection."&lt;ref name=Grimes/&gt;

===In the 1960s after abstract expressionism===
{{Main|Post-painterly abstraction|Color Field|Lyrical abstraction|Arte Povera|Process art|Western painting}}
In [[abstract art|abstract painting]] during the 1950s and 1960s several new directions like [[hard-edge painting]] and other forms of [[geometric abstraction]] began to appear in artist studios and in radical [[avant-garde]] circles as a reaction against the subjectivism of abstract expressionism. [[Clement Greenberg]] became the voice of [[post-painterly abstraction]] when he curated an influential exhibition of new painting that toured important art museums throughout the United States in 1964. [[Color Field]] painting, hard-edge painting and [[lyrical abstraction]]&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, Larry. "Young Lyrical Painters", ''Art in America'', v. 57, n. 6, November–December 1969, pp. 104–113.&lt;/ref&gt; emerged as radical new directions.

By the late 1960s however, [[postminimalism]], [[process art]] and [[Arte Povera]]&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007"&gt;Sarah Douglas, ''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", ''[[Art+Auction]]'', March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt; also emerged as revolutionary concepts and movements that encompassed both painting and sculpture, via lyrical abstraction and the postminimalist movement, and in early [[conceptual art]].&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007"/&gt; Process art as inspired by Pollock enabled artists to experiment with and make use of a diverse encyclopedia of style, content, material, placement, sense of time, and plastic and real space. [[Nancy Graves]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Howard Hodgkin]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Jannis Kounellis]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Colin McCahon]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], [[Alan Saret]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Lynda Benglis]], [[Dan Christensen]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Eva Hesse]], [[Keith Sonnier]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Sam Gilliam]], [[Mario Merz]] and [[Peter Reginato]] were some of the younger artists who emerged during the era of [[late modernism]] that spawned the heyday of the art of the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Ann Ray, and Howard Junker.

===Pop art===
[[File:I was a Rich Man's Plaything 1947.jpg|thumb|[[Eduardo Paolozzi]]. ''I was a Rich Man's Plaything'' (1947) is considered the initial standard bearer of "pop art" and first to display the word "pop".]]
{{Main|Pop art|Western painting}}
In 1962 the [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery mounted ''The New Realists'', the first major [[pop art]] group exhibition in an uptown art gallery in New York City. Janis mounted the exhibition in a 57th Street storefront near his gallery. The show sent shockwaves through the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] and reverberated worldwide. Earlier in England in 1958 the term "Pop Art" was used by [[Lawrence Alloway]] to describe paintings that celebrated the [[consumerism]] of the post World War II era. This movement rejected abstract expressionism and its focus on the [[hermeneutic]] and psychological interior in favor of art that depicted and often celebrated material consumer culture, advertising, and iconography of the mass production age. The early works of [[David Hockney]] and the works of [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]] and [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] (who created the groundbreaking ''I was a Rich Man's Plaything'', 1947) are considered seminal examples in the movement. Meanwhile, in the downtown scene in New York's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] 10th Street galleries, artists were formulating an American version of pop art. [[Claes Oldenburg]] had his storefront, and the [[Green Gallery]] on 57th Street began to show the works of [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[James Rosenquist]]. Later [[Leo Castelli]] exhibited the works of other American artists, including those of [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] for most of their careers. There is a connection between the radical works of [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Man Ray]], the rebellious [[Dada]]ists with a sense of humor, and pop artists like Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, and Roy Lichtenstein, whose paintings reproduce the look of [[Ben-Day dots]], a technique used in commercial reproduction.

===Minimalism===
{{Main|Minimalism|Minimal music|Literary minimalism|Postminimalism|20th-century Western painting}}
[[Minimalism]] describes movements in various forms of art and design, especially [[Visual arts|visual art]] and [[Minimal music|music]], wherein artists intend to expose the essence or identity of a subject through eliminating all nonessential forms, features, or concepts. Minimalism is any design or style wherein the simplest and fewest elements are used to create the maximum effect.

As a specific movement in the arts it is identified with developments in post–World War II Western art, most strongly with American visual arts in the 1960s and early 1970s. Prominent artists associated with this movement include [[Donald Judd]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Ronald Bladen]], [[Anne Truitt]], and [[Frank Stella]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Want, "Minimalism" in ''Grove Art Online''. Oxford University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It derives from the reductive aspects of modernism and is often interpreted as a reaction against [[Abstract expressionism]] and a bridge to [[Postminimalism|Postminimal]] art practices. By the early 1960s minimalism emerged as an abstract movement in art (with roots in the [[geometric abstraction]] of [[Kazimir Malevich]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism| title=Minimalism| work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Bauhaus]] and [[Piet Mondrian]]) that rejected the idea of relational and subjective painting, the complexity of [[abstract expressionist]] surfaces, and the emotional [[zeitgeist]] and polemics present in the arena of [[action painting]]. Minimalism argued that extreme simplicity could capture all of the sublime representation needed in art. Minimalism is variously construed either as a precursor to [[postmodernism]], or as a postmodern movement itself. In the latter perspective, early minimalism yielded advanced Modernist works, but the movement partially abandoned this direction when some artists like [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]] changed direction in favor of the [[anti-form movement]].

Hal Foster, in his essay ''The Crux of Minimalism'',&lt;ref name="Hal Foster 1996, pp44-53"&gt;Hal Foster, ''The Return of the Real: The Avant-garde at the End of the Century'', MIT Press, 1996, pp. 44–53. {{ISBN|0262561077}}&lt;/ref&gt; examines the extent to which Donald Judd and Robert Morris both acknowledge and exceed Greenbergian Modernism in their published definitions of minimalism.&lt;ref name="Hal Foster 1996, pp44-53"/&gt; He argues that minimalism is not a "dead end" of Modernism, but a "paradigm shift toward postmodern practices that continue to be elaborated today."&lt;ref name="Hal Foster 1996, pp44-53"/&gt;

The terms have expanded to encompass a movement in music that features such repetition and iteration as those of the compositions of [[La Monte Young]], [[Terry Riley]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Philip Glass]], and [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]]. Minimalist compositions are sometimes known as [[systems music]]. The term "minimalist" often colloquially refers to anything that is spare or stripped to its essentials. It has also been used to describe the [[Play (theatre)|plays]] and [[novel]]s of [[Samuel Beckett]], the films of [[Robert Bresson]], the stories of [[Raymond Carver]], and the automobile designs of [[Colin Chapman]].

====Postminimalism====
[[File:Spiral-jetty-from-rozel-point.png|thumb|left|Smithson's ''[[Spiral Jetty]]'' from atop Rozel Point, Utah, US, in mid-April 2005. Created in 1970, it still exists although it has often been submerged by the fluctuating lake level. It consists of some 6500 [[ton]]s of [[basalt]], earth and salt.]]
In the late 1960s [[Robert Pincus-Witten]]&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007"/&gt; coined the term "[[postminimalism]]" to describe minimalist-derived art which had content and contextual overtones that minimalism rejected. The term was applied by Pincus-Whitten to the work of [[Eva Hesse]], [[Keith Sonnier]], [[Richard Serra]] and new work by former minimalists [[Robert Smithson]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Barry Le Va]], and others. Other minimalists including [[Donald Judd]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]] and others continued to produce late Modernist paintings and sculpture for the remainders of their careers.

Since then, many artists have embraced minimal or postminimal styles, and the label "Postmodern" has been attached to them.

====Collage, assemblage, installations====
{{Main|Collage|Assemblage (art)|Installation art}}
Related to [[abstract expressionism]] was the emergence of combining manufactured items with artist materials, moving away from previous conventions of painting and sculpture. The work of [[Robert Rauschenberg]] exemplifies this trend. His "combines" of the 1950s were forerunners of [[pop art]] and [[installation art]], and used assemblages of large physical objects, including stuffed animals, birds and commercial photographs. Rauschenberg, [[Jasper Johns]], [[Larry Rivers]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Jim Dine]], and [[Edward Kienholz]] were among important pioneers of both abstraction and pop art. Creating new conventions of art-making, they made acceptable in serious contemporary art circles the radical inclusion in their works of unlikely materials. Another pioneer of collage was [[Joseph Cornell]], whose more intimately scaled works were seen as radical because of both his personal iconography and his use of [[found object]]s.

====Neo-Dada====
{{Main|Neo-Dada}}

In the early 20th century [[Marcel Duchamp]] submitted for exhibition a [[urinal]] as a sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/duchamp-fountain-t07573/text-summary| title='Fountain', Marcel Duchamp: Summary -  - Tate| work=Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt; He professed his intent that people look at the urinal as if it were a work of art because he said it was a work of art. He referred to his work as "[[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymades]]". ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' was a urinal signed with the pseudonym "R. Mutt", the exhibition of which shocked the art world in 1917. This and Duchamp's other works are generally labelled as Dada. Duchamp can be seen as a precursor to conceptual art, other famous examples being [[John Cage]]'s ''[[4'33"]]'', which is four minutes and thirty three seconds of silence, and Rauschenberg's ''[[Erased de Kooning Drawing]]''. Many conceptual works take the position that art is the result of the viewer viewing an object or act as art, not of the intrinsic qualities of the work itself. In choosing "an ordinary article of life" and creating "a new thought for that object" Duchamp invited onlookers to view ''Fountain'' as a sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu/dada/blindman/2/05.htm| title=Blindman No. 2| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcel Duchamp famously gave up "art" in favor of [[chess]]. Avant-garde composer [[David Tudor]] created a piece, ''Reunion'' (1968), written jointly with Lowell Cross, that features a chess game in which each move triggers a lighting effect or projection. Duchamp and Cage played the game at the work's premier.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Owens, ''Beyond Recognition: Representation, Power, and Culture'', London and Berkeley: University of California Press (1992), pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven Best]] and [[Douglas Kellner]] identify Rauschenberg and [[Jasper Johns]] as part of the transitional phase, influenced by Duchamp, between Modernism and Postmodernism. Both used images of ordinary objects, or the objects themselves, in their work, while retaining the abstraction and painterly gestures of high Modernism.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Best, Douglas Kellner, ''The Postmodern Turn'', Guilford Press, 1997, p. 174. {{ISBN|1572302216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Performance and happenings====
{{Main|Performance art|Happening|Fluxus}}
[[File:Schneemann-Interior Scroll.gif|thumb|left|[[Carolee Schneemann]], performing her piece ''Interior Scroll, 1975.'' |upright=0.75|[[Yves Klein]] in [[France]], and [[Carolee Schneemann]] (pictured), [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Charlotte Moorman]], and [[Yoko Ono]] in [[New York City]] were pioneers of performance based works of art, that often entailed nudity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.caroleeschneemann.com/interiorscroll.html| title=Carolee Schneemann, Biography: Selected Works, Recent and Forthcoming Events| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the late 1950s and 1960s artists with a wide range of interests began to push the boundaries of contemporary art. [[Yves Klein]] in France, [[Carolee Schneemann]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Charlotte Moorman]] and [[Yoko Ono]] in New York City, and [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Wolf Vostell]] and [[Nam June Paik]] in Germany were pioneers of performance-based works of art. Groups like [[The Living Theatre]] with [[Julian Beck]] and [[Judith Malina]] collaborated with sculptors and painters creating environments, radically changing the relationship between audience and performer, especially in their piece ''Paradise Now''. The [[Judson Dance Theater]], located at the [[Judson Memorial Church]], New York; and the Judson dancers, notably [[Yvonne Rainer]], [[Trisha Brown]], [[Elaine Summers]], Sally Gross, Simonne Forti, [[Deborah Hay]], [[Lucinda Childs]], [[Steve Paxton]] and others; collaborated with artists [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Robert Whitman]], [[John Cage]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], and engineers like [[Billy Klüver]]. [[Park Place Gallery]] was a center for musical performances by electronic composers [[Steve Reich]], [[Philip Glass]], and other notable performance artists including [[Joan Jonas]].

These performances were intended as works of a new art form combining sculpture, dance, and music or sound, often with audience participation. They were characterized by the reductive philosophies of minimalism and the spontaneous improvisation and expressivity of abstract expressionism. Images of Schneeman's performances of pieces meant to shock are occasionally used to illustrate these kinds of art, and she is often seen photographed while performing her piece ''Interior Scroll''. However, the images of her performing this piece are illustrating precisely what performance art is not. In performance art, the performance itself is the medium. Other media cannot illustrate performance art. Performance art is performed, not captured. By its nature performance is momentary and evanescent, which is part of the point of the medium as art. Representations of performance art in other media, whether by image, video, narrative or otherwise, select certain points of view in space or time or otherwise involve the inherent limitations of each medium, and which therefore cannot truly illustrate the medium of performance as art.

During the same period, various avant-garde artists created [[Happening]]s, mysterious and often spontaneous and unscripted gatherings of artists and their friends and relatives in various specified locations, often incorporating exercises in absurdity, physicality, costuming, spontaneous [[nudity]], and various random or seemingly disconnected acts. Notable creators of happenings included [[Allan Kaprow]]—who first used the term in 1958,&lt;ref name="Allan Kaprow|Chronology"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://members.chello.nl/j.seegers1/flux_files/kaprow_chronology.html| title=Fluxus &amp;amp; Happening&amp;nbsp;– Allan Kaprow&amp;nbsp;– Chronology| accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Red Grooms]], and [[Robert Whitman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/13/arts/design/13fink.html| work=The New York Times| title=Happenings Are Happening Again| first=Jori| last=Finkel| date=13 April 2008| accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intermedia, multi-media====
{{main|Intermedia}}

Another trend in art which has been associated with the term postmodern is the use of a number of different media together. [[Intermedia]] is a term coined by [[Dick Higgins]] and meant to convey new art forms along the lines of [[Fluxus]], [[concrete poetry]], [[found objects]], [[performance art]], and [[computer art]]. Higgins was the publisher of the [[Something Else Press]], a concrete poet married to artist [[Alison Knowles]] and an admirer of [[Marcel Duchamp]]. [[Ihab Hassan]] includes "Intermedia, the fusion of forms, the confusion of realms," in his list of the characteristics of [[postmodern art]].&lt;ref&gt;Ihab Hassan in Lawrence E. Cahoone, ''From Modernism to Postmodernism: An Anthology'', Blackwell Publishing, 2003. p. 13. {{ISBN|0631232133}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most common forms of "multi-media art" is the use of video-tape and CRT monitors, termed [[video art]]. While the theory of combining multiple arts into one art is quite old, and has been revived periodically, the postmodern manifestation is often in combination with performance art, where the dramatic subtext is removed, and what is left is the specific statements of the artist in question or the conceptual statement of their action.

====Fluxus====
{{Main|Fluxus}}

Fluxus was named and loosely organized in 1962 by [[George Maciunas]] (1931–1978), a Lithuanian-born American artist. Fluxus traces its beginnings to [[John Cage]]'s 1957 to 1959 Experimental Composition classes at the [[New School for Social Research]] in New York City. Many of his students were artists working in other media with little or no background in music. Cage's students included Fluxus founding members [[Jackson Mac Low]], [[Al Hansen]], [[George Brecht]] and [[Dick Higgins]].

Fluxus encouraged a do-it-yourself aesthetic and valued simplicity over complexity. Like [[Dada]] before it, Fluxus included a strong current of anti-commercialism and an [[anti-art]] sensibility, disparaging the conventional market-driven art world in favor of an artist-centered creative practice. Fluxus artists preferred to work with whatever materials were at hand, and either created their own work or collaborated in the creation process with their colleagues.

[[Andreas Huyssen]] criticises attempts to claim Fluxus for Postmodernism as "either the master-code of postmodernism or the ultimately unrepresentable art movement—as it were, postmodernism's sublime."&lt;ref name="Huyssen"&gt;Andreas Huyssen, ''Twilight Memories: Marking Time in a Culture of Amnesia'', Routledge, 1995. p. 192. {{ISBN|0415909341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he sees Fluxus as a major [[Neo-Dada]]ist phenomena within the avant-garde tradition. It did not represent a major advance in the development of artistic strategies, though it did express a rebellion against "the administered culture of the 1950s, in which a moderate, domesticated modernism served as ideological prop to the [[Cold War]]."&lt;ref name="Huyssen" /&gt;

===Late period===
{{Main|Late modernism}}
[[File:Brice Marden Vine.jpg|thumb|[[Brice Marden]], ''Vine'', 1992–93, oil on linen, {{convert|8|by|8+1/2|ft|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}}, Museum of Modern Art, New York]]
The continuation of [[abstract expressionism]], [[color field painting]], [[lyrical abstraction]], [[geometric abstraction]], [[minimalism]], [[abstract illusionism]], [[process art]], [[pop art]], [[postminimalism]], and other late 20th-century Modernist movements in both painting and sculpture continued through the first decade of the 21st century and constitute radical new directions in those mediums.&lt;ref&gt;Ratcliff, Carter. "The New Informalists", ''Art News'', v. 68, n. 8, December 1969, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Rose]]. ''American Painting. Part Two: The Twentieth Century''. Published by Skira–Rizzoli, New York, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Darby Bannard]]. "Notes on American Painting of the Sixties." ''Artforum'', January 1970, vol. 8, no. 5, pp. 40–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the 21st century, well-established artists such as [[Sir Anthony Caro]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Al Held]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Jim Dine]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[Alex Katz]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], and younger artists including [[Brice Marden]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Sam Gilliam]], [[Isaac Witkin]], [[Sean Scully]], [[Mahirwan Mamtani]], [[Joseph Nechvatal]], [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Dan Christensen]], [[Joel Shapiro]], [[Tom Otterness]], [[Joan Snyder]], [[Ross Bleckner]], [[Archie Rand]], [[Susan Crile]], and others continued to produce vital and influential paintings and sculpture.

==Modernism in Africa and Asia==
See also  [[Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism]] and [[Hanshinkan Modernism]]

Peter Kalliney suggests that,"Modernist concepts, especially aesthetic autonomy, were fundamental to the literature of [[decolonization]] in anglophone Africa."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kalliney, "Modernism, African Literature, and the Cold War". ''Modern Language Quarterly'' (2015) 76 (3): 333–368.&lt;/ref&gt; In his opinion, [[Rajat Neogy]], [[Christopher Okigbo]], and [[Wole Soyinka]], were among the writer who "repurposed modernist versions of aesthetic autonomy to declare their freedom from colonial bondage, from systems of racial discrimination, and even from the new postcolonial state".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kalliney, "Modernism, African Literature, and the Cold War".&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms "modernism" and "modernist", according to scholar William J. Tyler, "have only recently become part of the standard discourse in English on modern Japanese literature and doubts concerning their authenticity vis-a-vis Western European modernism remain". Tyler finds this odd, given "the decidedly modern prose" of such "well-known Japanese writers as [[Kawabata Yasunari]], [[Nagai Kafu]], and [[Jun'ichirō Tanizaki]]". However, "scholars in the visual and fine arts, architecture, and poetry readily embraced "[[modanizumu]]" as a key concept for describing and analyzing Japanese culture in the 1920s and 1930s".&lt;ref&gt;''Modanizumu: Modernist Fiction from Japan'', 1913–1938. Edited by William J. Tyler. University of Hawai'i Press, 2008, [http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/p-5343-9780824832421.aspx].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, various young Japanese writers, including Kawabata Yasunari, [[Riichi Yokomitsu]] started a  literary journal ''Bungei Jidai'' ("The Artistic Age"). This journal was "part of an '[[art for art's sake]]' movement, influenced by European Cubism, Expressionism, Dada, and other modernist styles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.is/4K875|title=Draft confirmed as Kawabata novel|date=2012-07-15|publisher=The Japan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese  modernist [[architect]] [[Kenzō Tange]] (1913–2005) was one of the most significant architects of the 20th century, combining traditional Japanese styles with [[Modern Architecture|modernism]], and designed major buildings on five continents. Tange was also an influential patron of the [[Metabolism (architecture)|Metabolist movement]]. He said: "It was, I believe, around 1959 or at the beginning of the sixties that I began to think about what I was later to call [[Structuralism (architecture)|structuralism]]",&lt;ref&gt;(cited in ''Plan'' 2/1982, Amsterdam)&lt;/ref&gt; He was influenced from an early age by the Swiss modernist, [[Le Corbusier]], Tange gained international recognition in 1949 when he won the competition for the design of [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park]].

In China the "[[New Sensationists]]" (新感觉派, Xīn Gǎnjué Pài) were a group of writers based in Shanghai who in the 1930s and 1940s were influenced, to varying degrees, by Western and Japanese modernism. They wrote fiction that was more concerned with the unconscious and with aesthetics than with politics or social problems. Among these writers were [[Mu Shiying]], [[Liu Na'ou]], and [[Shi Zhecun]].

In India, the [[Progressive Artists' Group]] was a group of [[modern art]]ists, mainly based in [[Mumbai]], [[India]] formed in 1947. Though it lacked any particular style, it synthesised [[Indian art]] with European and North America influences from the first half of the 20th Century, including Post-Impressionism, Cubism and Expressionism.

==Differences between modernism and postmodernism==
By the early 1980s the [[Postmodern]] movement in art and architecture began to establish its position through various [[wikt:conceptual|conceptual]] and [[intermedia]] formats. Postmodernism in music and literature began to take hold earlier. In music, postmodernism is described in one reference work, as a "term introduced in the 1970s",&lt;ref&gt;"Postmodernism", ''The Penguin Companion to Classical Music'', ed. Paul Griffiths. London: Penguin, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; while in British literature, ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature'' sees modernism "ceding its predominance to postmodernism" as early as 1939.&lt;ref name="British Literature' 2006"/&gt; However, dates are highly debatable, especially as according to [[Andreas Huyssen]]: "one critic's postmodernism is another critic's modernism."&lt;ref name="Macmillan"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bokkilden.no/SamboWeb/produkt.do?produktId=952726| title=Postmodern Debates| author=Bokkilden| work=Bokkilden}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes those who are critical of the division between the two and see them as two aspects of the same movement, and believe that late Modernism continues.&lt;ref name="Macmillan"/&gt;

Modernism is an encompassing label for a wide variety of cultural movements. [[Postmodernism]] is essentially a centralized movement that named itself, based on sociopolitical theory, although the term is now used in a wider sense to refer to activities from the 20th century onwards which exhibit awareness of and reinterpret the modern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/postmodernism?view=uk| title=Oxford Dictionaries - Dictionary, Thesaurus, &amp; Grammar| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/postmodernism| title=Postmodern - Definition of postmodern by Merriam-Webster| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Reichl, Cook's November 1989; [http://www.bartleby.com/61/26/P0472600.html American Heritage Dictionary's definition of the postmodern] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209075319/http://www.bartleby.com/61/26/P0472600.html |date=9 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Postmodern theory asserts that the attempt to canonise Modernism "after the fact" is doomed to undisambiguable contradictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/pomo.html| title=The Po-Mo Page: Postmodern to Post-postmodern| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a narrower sense, what was Modernist was not necessarily also postmodern. Those elements of Modernism which accentuated the benefits of rationality and socio-technological progress were only Modernist.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, ''British, Irish and American Literature'', Trier 2002, pp. 210–12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and hostility to modernism==
{{anchor|Criticisms of modernism}}
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2013}}
[[File:Franz Marc-The fate of the animals-1913.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Franz Marc]], ''The fate of the animals'', 1913, oil on canvas. The work was displayed at the exhibition of [[Degenerate art|"Entartete Kunst"]] ("degenerate art") in [[Munich]], [[Nazi Germany]], 1937.]]
Modernism's stress on [[freedom of expression]], experimentation, [[Radicalism (historical)|radicalism]], and [[primitivism]] disregards conventional expectations. In many art forms this often meant startling and alienating audiences with bizarre and unpredictable effects, as in the strange and disturbing combinations of motifs in [[Surrealism]] or the use of extreme [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] and [[atonality]] in Modernist music. In literature this often involved the rejection of intelligible plots or characterization in novels, or the creation of poetry that defied clear interpretation.

From 1932 [[Socialist realism]] began to oust Modernism in the Soviet Union;&lt;ref&gt;Sergei V. Ivanov, ''Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School'', pp. 28–29. {{ISBN|978-5901724217}}&lt;/ref&gt; it had previously endorsed [[Russian Futurism|Futurism]] and [[constructivism (art)|Constructivism]]. The [[Nazism|Nazi]] government of Germany deemed modernism [[narcissism|narcissistic]] and nonsensical, as well as "Jewish" (see [[Antisemitism]]) and "Negro".&lt;ref&gt;Kühnel, Anita. [https://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10077 "Entartete Kunst", from ''Grove Art Online''], MoMA website.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis exhibited Modernist paintings alongside works by the [[mental illness|mentally ill]] in an exhibition entitled "[[Degenerate Art]]". Accusations of "formalism" could lead to the end of a career, or worse. For this reason many Modernists of the postwar generation felt that they were the most important bulwark against totalitarianism, the "[[sentinel species|canary in the coal mine]]", whose repression by a government or other group with supposed authority represented a warning that individual liberties were being threatened. Louis A. Sass compared madness, specifically [[schizophrenia]], and modernism in a less fascist manner by noting their shared disjunctive narratives, surreal images, and incoherence.&lt;ref&gt;Sass, Louis A. (1992). ''Madness and Modernism: Insanity in the Light of Modern Art, Literature, and Thought''. New York: Basic Books. Cited in Bauer, Amy (2004), "Cognition, Constraints, and Conceptual Blends in Modernist Music", in ''The Pleasure of Modernist Music''. {{ISBN|1580461433}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, modernism flourished mainly in consumer/capitalist societies, despite the fact that its proponents often rejected consumerism itself. However, [[high modernism]] began to merge with consumer culture after World War II, especially during the 1960s. In Britain, a youth [[subculture]] emerged calling itself "Modernist" (usually shortened to [[Mod (subculture)|Mod]]), following such representative music groups as [[the Who]] and [[the Kinks]]. The likes of [[Bob Dylan]], [[Serge Gainsbourg]] and [[the Rolling Stones]] combined popular musical traditions with Modernist verse, adopting literary devices derived from [[James Joyce]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[James Thurber]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], and others. [[The Beatles]] developed along similar lines, creating various Modernist musical effects on several albums, while musicians such as [[Frank Zappa]], [[Syd Barrett]] and [[Captain Beefheart]] proved even more experimental. Modernist devices also started to appear in popular cinema, and later on in music videos. Modernist design also began to enter the mainstream of popular culture, as simplified and stylized forms became popular, often associated with dreams of a [[space age]] high-tech future.

This merging of consumer and high versions of Modernist culture led to a radical transformation of the meaning of "Modernism". First, it implied that a movement based on the rejection of tradition had become a tradition of its own. Second, it demonstrated that the distinction between elite Modernist and mass consumerist culture had lost its precision. Some writers{{Who|date=September 2009}} declared that modernism had become so institutionalized that it was now "post avant-garde", indicating that it had lost its power as a revolutionary movement. Many have interpreted this transformation as the beginning of the phase that became known as [[postmodernism]]. For others, such as art critic [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]], postmodernism represents an extension of modernism.

"Anti-modern" or "counter-modern" movements seek to emphasize [[holism]], connection and [[spirituality]] as remedies or antidotes to modernism. Such movements see modernism as [[reductionist]], and therefore subject to an inability to see systemic and [[emergence|emergent]] effects. Many Modernists came to this viewpoint, for example [[Paul Hindemith]] in his late turn towards mysticism. Writers such as Paul H. Ray and Sherry Ruth Anderson, in ''[[The Cultural Creatives: How 50 Million People Are Changing the World]]'' (2000), Fredrick Turner in ''A Culture of Hope'' and [[Lester Brown]] in ''Plan B'', have articulated a critique of the basic idea of modernism itself—that individual creative expression should conform to the realities of technology. Instead, they argue, individual creativity should make everyday life more emotionally acceptable.

Some traditionalist artists like [[Alexander Stoddart]] reject modernism generally as the product of "an epoch of false money allied with false culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jack |first=Ian |title=Set in Stone |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=6 June 2009 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/jun/06/alexander-stoddart-interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some fields, the effects of modernism have remained stronger and more persistent than in others. Visual art has made the most complete break with its past. Most major capital cities have museums devoted to modern art as distinct from post-[[Renaissance]] art (c. 1400 to c. 1900). Examples include the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, the [[Tate Modern]] in London, and the [[Centre Pompidou]] in Paris. These galleries make no distinction between modernist and Postmodernist phases, seeing both as developments within Modern Art.

[[File:Naive realism.jpg|400px|thumb|right|Naïve realism argues we perceive the world directly]]

In [[philosophy of mind]], '''naïve realism''', also known as '''direct realism''', '''common sense realism''' or '''perceptual realism''', is the idea that the [[senses]] provide us with direct [[awareness]] of [[Object (philosophy)|object]]s as they ''really'' are. Objects obey the laws of [[physics]] and retain all their properties whether or not there is anyone to observe them.&lt;ref name="tok"&gt;[http://www.theoryofknowledge.info/naiverealism.html Naïve Realism], ''Theory of Knowledge.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; They are composed of [[matter]], occupy [[space]] and have properties, such as size, shape, texture, smell, taste and colour, that are usually [[Perception|perceived]] correctly.

In contrast, some forms of [[idealism]] claim that no world exists apart from mind-dependent ideas, and some forms of [[skepticism]] say we cannot trust our senses. Naïve realism is known as [[Direct and indirect realism|''direct'' as against ''indirect'' or ''representational'']] realism when its arguments are developed to counter the latter position,  also known as [[epistemological dualism]];&lt;ref&gt;Lehar, Steve. [http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/Representationalism.html Representationalism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905185905/http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/Representationalism.html |date=2012-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that our conscious experience is not of the real world but of an internal representation of the world.

==History==
For a history of direct realist theories, see ''[[Direct and indirect realism#History|Direct and indirect realism § History]]''.

==Overview==

The naïve realist theory may be characterized as the acceptance of the following five [[belief]]s:

* There exists a world of [[Materialism|material]] objects
* Some statements about these objects can be known to be true through [[Empirical evidence|sense-experience]]
* These objects exist not only when they are being perceived but also when they are not perceived. The objects of perception are largely [[Objectivity (philosophy)|perception-independent]].
* These objects are also able to retain properties of the types we perceive them as having, even when they are not being perceived. Their properties are perception-independent.
* By means of our senses, we perceive the world directly, and pretty much as it is. In the main, our claims to have [[Epistemology|knowledge]] of it are justified."&lt;ref name=uor&gt;[http://www.rdg.ac.uk/AcaDepts/ld/Philos/jmp/Theory%20of%20Knowledge/NaiveRealism.htm Naïve Realism], [[University of Reading]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area of [[visual perception]] in [[psychology]], the leading direct realist theorist was [[J. J. Gibson]]. Other psychologists were heavily influenced by this approach, including William Mace, Claire Michaels,&lt;ref&gt;http://ione.psy.uconn.edu:16080/~corr/Pages/MichaelsProfile.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Reed,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.us.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Psychology/Cognitive/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195073010&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Shaw, and Michael Turvey. More recently, [[Carol Fowler]] has promoted a direct realist approach to [[speech perception]].

Among [[Contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] [[analytic philosopher]]s who defended direct realism one might refer to, for example, [[Hilary Putnam]],&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Hilary. Sep. 1994. "The Dewey Lectures 1994: Sense, Nonsense, and the Senses: An Inquiry into the Powers of the Human Mind." ''The Journal of Philosophy'' '''91'''(9):445–518.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John McDowell]],&lt;ref&gt;John McDowell, ''Mind and World''. Harvard University Press, &lt;!--November--&gt;1994, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger F. Gibson, "McDowell's Direct Realism and Platonic Naturalism", ''Philosophical Issues'' Vol. 7, ''Perception'' (1996), pp. 275–281.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galen Strawson]],&lt;ref&gt;Galen Strawson, [https://vimeo.com/91346935 "Real Direct Realism"], a lecture recorded 2014 at Marc Sanders Foundation, Vimeo.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John R. Searle]].&lt;ref&gt;John R. Searle, ''Seeing Things as They Are: A Theory of Perception'', Oxford University Press, 2015, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Searle, for instance, addresses the popular but perhaps mistaken assumption that ''we can only directly perceive our own subjective experiences, but never objects and states of affairs in the world themselves''. According to Searle, it has influenced many thinkers to reject direct realism. But Searle contends that the rejection of direct realism is based on a bad argument: the [[Argument from illusion]], which in turn relies on vague assumptions on the nature or existence of "[[sense data]]". Various sense data theories were deconstructed in 1962 by the British philosopher [[J. L. Austin]] in a book titled ''Sense and Sensibilia''.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, J. L. ''Sense and Sensibilia'', Oxford: Clarendon. 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

Talk of sense data has been replaced by talk of representational perception in a broader sense, and scientific realists typically assume representational perception. But the assumption is philosophical, and arguably little prevents scientific realists from assuming direct perception, as in direct or "naïve" realism. In a blog-post on ''"Naive realism and color realism"'' Putnam&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Putnam's blog 'Sardonic comment' at http://putnamphil.blogspot.se/2015/05/naive-realism-and-color-realism-in-1976.html. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; sums up with the following words:  &lt;br /&gt;
''"... Being an apple is not a natural kind in physics, but it is in biology, recall. Being complex and of no interest to fundamental physics isn't a failure to be "real".  I think green is as real as applehood.".''

[[Simon Blackburn]] has argued that whatever positions they may take in books, articles or lectures, naive realism is the view of "philosophers when they are off-duty."&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, Simon (2008). Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy (Second edition, revised), Oxford University Press {{ISBN|9780199541430}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naïve and scientific realism or direct and indirect realism==
It is not uncommon to think of naïve realism as distinct from [[scientific realism]], which states that the [[universe]] contains just those properties that feature in a [[scientific]] description of it, not properties like colour ''per se'' but merely objects that reflect certain wavelengths owing to their microscopic surface texture. This lack of [[supervenience]] of experience on the physical world has influenced many thinkers to reject naïve realism as a physical theory.&lt;ref&gt;Michaels, Claire &amp; Carello, Claudia. (1981). ''[http://ione.psy.uconn.edu/~psy254/MC.pdf Direct Perception]''. Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

One should add, however, that naïve realism does not claim that reality is only what we see, hear, etc. Likewise, scientific realism does not claim that reality is only what can be described by fundamental physics. It follows that the relevant distinction to make is not between naïve and scientific realism but between ''[[direct and indirect realism]]''.

The direct realist claims that the experience of a sunset, for instance, is the real sunset that we directly experience. The indirect realist claims that our relation to reality is indirect, so the experience of a sunset is a subjective copy of what really is radiation as described by physics. But the direct realist does not deny that the sunset is radiation; the experience has a hierarchical structure,&lt;ref&gt;John R. Searle, 'Seeing Things as They Are; A Theory of Perception', Oxford University Press. 2015. p.111-114&lt;/ref&gt; and the radiation is part of what amounts to the direct experience.

An example of a scientific realist is [[John Locke]], who held the world only contains the [[Primary/secondary quality distinction|primary qualities]] that feature in a corpuscularian scientific account of the world (see [[corpuscular theory]]), and that other properties were entirely [[Subjectivity|subjective]], depending for their [[existence]] upon some perceiver who can observe the objects."&lt;ref name=tok/&gt;

The modern philosopher of science Howard Sankey argues for a form of scientific realism which has commonsense realism as one of its foundations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Realism and quantum physics===

{{Main|Principle of locality}}

Realism in physics refers to the fact that physical systems must have definite properties when measured or observed. [[Physics]] until the 19th century was implicitly and sometimes explicitly based on philosophical realism.

Scientific realism in classical physics has remained compatible with the naïve realism of everyday thinking on the whole, but there is no consistent way to visualize the world underlying quantum theory in terms of ideas of the everyday world. "The general conclusion is that in [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] naïve realism, although necessary at the level of observations, fails at the microscopic level."&lt;ref&gt;Gomatam, Ravi. (2004). [https://arxiv.org/abs/0708.1536 Physics and Commonsense - Reassessing the connection in the light of the quantum theory], ''arXiv.org''.&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments such as the [[Stern–Gerlach experiment]] and quantum phenomena such as [[Complementarity (physics)|complementarity]] lead quantum physicists to conclude that "[w]e have no satisfactory reason for ascribing objective existence to physical quantities as distinguished from the numbers obtained when we make the measurements which we correlate with them. There is no real reason for supposing that a particle has at every moment a definite, but unknown, position which may be revealed by a measurement of the right kind .... On the contrary, we get into a maze of contradiction as soon as we inject into quantum mechanics such concepts as carried over from the language and philosophy of our ancestors .... It would be more exact if we spoke of 'making measurements' of this, that, or the other type instead of saying that we measure this, that, or the other 'physical quantity'."&lt;ref&gt;Kemble E. C. in Peres Asher, (1993). [https://books.google.com/books?id=-yLkUyCsb7cC Quantum Theory: Concepts and Methods], Springer 1993 p. 17 {{ISBN|978-0-7923-2549-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is no longer possible to adhere to both the [[principle of locality]] (that distant objects cannot affect local objects), and counterfactual definiteness, a form of ontological realism implicit in classical physics. Some interpretations of quantum mechanics hold that a system lacks an actualized property until it is measured, which implies that quantum systems exhibit a non-local behavior. [[Bell's theorem]] proved that every [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] must either violate [[Principle of locality|locality]] or [[counterfactual definiteness]]. This claim has given rise to a contentious debate of the [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]]. Although locality and 'realism,' in the sense of counterfactual definiteness, are jointly false, it is possible to retain one of them. The majority of working physicists discard counterfactual definiteness in favor of locality, since non-locality is held to be contrary to relativity. The implications of this stance are rarely discussed outside of the microscopic domain but the [[thought experiment]] of [[Schrödinger's cat]] illustrates the difficulties presented. As quantum mechanics is applied to larger and larger objects, even a one-ton bar, proposed to detect gravity waves, must be analysed quantum mechanically, while in [[cosmology]] a wave function for the whole universe is written to study the [[Big Bang]]. It is difficult to accept the quantum world as somehow not physically real, so "Quantum mechanics forces us to abandon naïve realism",&lt;ref&gt;Rosenblum, Bruce &amp; Kuttner, Fred. (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=hKrvv35-gcMC Quantum Enigma: Physics Encounters Consciousness], Oxford University Press US. p. 112. {{ISBN|978-0-19-517559-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; though it can also be argued that the counterfactual definiteness 'realism' of physics is a much more specific notion than general [[philosophical realism]].&lt;ref&gt;"We examine the prevalent use of the phrase “local realism” in the context of Bell’s Theorem and associated experiments, with a focus on the
question: what exactly is the ‘realism’ in ‘local realism’ supposed to
mean?". [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0607057 Norsen, T.''Against 'Realism' '']&lt;/ref&gt;

"'[W]e have to give up the idea of realism to a far greater extent than most physicists believe today.' ([[Anton Zeilinger]]) .... By realism, he means the idea that objects have specific features and properties — that a ball is red, that a book contains the works of Shakespeare, or that an electron has a particular spin ... for objects governed by the laws of quantum mechanics, like photons and electrons, it may make no sense to think of them as having well-defined characteristics. Instead, what we see may depend on how we look."&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Philip. (2007). [http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070416/full/070416-9.html Physicists bid farewell to reality? Quantum mechanics just got even stranger], ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', April 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Virtual reality and realism==
"Virtual realism"&lt;ref&gt;Heim, Michael. (2000). [https://books.google.com/books?id=4nyKP2-KlXAC Virtual Realism], Oxford University Press US. {{ISBN|978-0-19-513874-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is closely related to the above theories.

In the research paper ''The reality of virtual reality'' it is proposed that, "virtuality is itself a bona fide mode of reality, and that 'virtual reality' must be understood as 'things, agents and events that exist in cyberspace'. These proposals resolve the incoherences found in the ordinary uses of these terms... '[[virtual reality]]', though based on recent information technology, does not refer to mere technological equipment or purely mental entities, or to some fake environment as opposed to the real world, but that it is an [[Ontology|ontological]] mode of existence which leads to an expansion of our ordinary world."&lt;ref&gt;(Requires login) Yoh, Myeung-Sook. (2001). [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel5/7657/20918/00969726.pdf?arnumber=969726 The reality of virtual reality], Virtual Systems and Multimedia. pp. 666-674.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The emergence of teleoperation and virtual environments has greatly increased interest in "synthetic experience", a mode of experience made possible by both these newer technologies and earlier ones, such as telecommunication and sensory prosthetics... understanding synthetic experience must begin by recognizing the fallacy of naïve realism and with the recognition that the phenomenology of synthetic experience is continuous with that of ordinary experience."&lt;ref&gt;Loomis, Jack. (1993). [http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/~loomis/Loomis%20presence%20IEEE%2093.pdf Understanding Synthetic Experience Must Begin with the Analysis of Ordinary Perceptual Experience], ''IEEE 1993 Symposium on Research Frontiers in Virtual Reality'', 54-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

The alleged necessity to recognize a "fallacy of naïve realism" seems, however, unwarranted. One should not be misled by the word "naïve", for a naïve realist normally understands what a picture is: that the depicted face on a photograph, for instance, is not the real face, and that the things seen on a computer-screen are symbols or electronic depictions, and so on. A majority of the population arguably subscribes to naïve common sense notions of reality, without a recognizable loss in capacity to interact in cyberspace.

In 1999, Hoodbhoy with [[Ishfaq Ahmad]] and Riazuddin, played a major and influential role in the establishment of [[National Center for Physics]] (NCP), becoming one of the earliest academic scientists who joined the NCP at its inception.

Hoodbhoy has roundly criticized the development on [[nuclear weapons]], especially its [[Nuclear race|extension]] to South Asia, mainly by [[India and Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="Dr. Prof. Pervez Amerali Hoodbhoy and [[The Herald (Pakistan)|''The Herald'']]"&gt;{{Cite web

=== Activism ===
Hoodbhoy is a prominent sponsor of the ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]'', representing the Pakistan's delegation.&lt;ref&gt;CGPACS (2006) [http://www.socsci.uci.edu/events/060512_hoodbhoy/hoodbhoy6.htm 15th Annual Margolis Lecture with Dr. Pervez Hoodbhoy].

[[File:Solidarity message to ex-Muslims - Pervez Hoodbhoy.webm|thumb|Pervez Hoodbhoy criticises Pakistani attitudes on "[[blasphemy]]".]]
Hoodbhoy widely writes about the role and modernisation of [[Pakistan Armed Forces|Pakistan military]], particularly the defence budget spending by the [[Government of Pakistan|Pakistan government]] on the [[Pakistan Armed Forces|military]]. In an interview on [[secularism]], he mentioned that obsession with scientific-religious [[apophenia]] may have caused lack of scientific advancement among [[Muslim world|Muslims]] in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meforum.org/2593/pervez-amirali-hoodbhoy-islam-science Pervez Amirali Hoodbhoy: "Islam and Science Have Parted Ways"]; Interview in ''Middle East Quarterly''; Winter 2010, pp. 69–74, Retrieved 2 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 he was one the signers of the [[Humanism and Its Aspirations|Humanist Manifesto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_III/Notable_Signers |title=Notable Signers |publisher=American Humanist Association |work=Humanism and Its Aspirations |accessdate=6 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005105825/http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_III/Notable_Signers |archivedate=5 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoodbhoy has criticized the Pakistan [[Higher Education Commission (Pakistan)|Higher Education Commission]] (HEC) for pursuing "a drive to achieve numbers rather than quality".&lt;ref name="Shehzad"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shehzad|first1=Rizwan|title=Hoodbhoy feels restructuring better than saving old HEC|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/483217/hoodbhoy-feels-restructuring-better-than-saving-old-hec/|accessdate=1 July 2015|agency=Tribune.com.pk|date=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that because of "policies that reward authors of research articles and PhD supervisors with cash and promotions", universities in Pakistan have "turned into factories producing junk papers and PhDs."&lt;ref name="HOODBHOY-29-11-14"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hoodbhoy|first1=Pervez|title=Misjudging universities|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1147559|accessdate=1 July 2015|agency=Dawn|date=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He has been a harsh critic on the performance of [[Higher Education Commission (Pakistan)|HEC]] since 2003 when it was led by Dr. [[Atta ur Rahman (scientist)|Atta-ur-Rahman]], and the issue has led to heated debates in Pakistan's [[News channels in Pakistan|news media]].&lt;ref name="Pakistaniaat" /&gt;

In 2009 Hoodbhoy came into conflict with [[Atta ur Rahman (scientist)|Atta-ur-Rahman]], an [[Organic Chemistry|organic chemist]], over the [[Higher Education Commission (Pakistan)|Higher Education Commission]] (HEC). In the United States, the journal [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] published an article on the successes and failures of the [[Higher Education Commission (Pakistan)|HEC]].&lt;ref name="Pakistaniat, 2009"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Najam|first1=Adil|title=Pakistan in Higher Education|url=http://pakistaniat.com/2009/09/03/nature-pakistan-higher-education/|publisher=Pakistaniat, 2009|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoodbhoy wrote to complain about, among other things, the article's failure to mention (what Hoodbhoy called) "the billions wasted on mindless prestige mega-projects".&lt;ref name="Pakistaniaat" /&gt;
In the debate on [[Higher Education Commission (Pakistan)|HEC]] [[Adil Najam]], [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]], and [[Atta ur Rahman (scientist)|Atta-ur-Rehman]] defended the HEC while agreeing with some of Hoodbhoy's criticism.&lt;ref name="Pakistaniaat"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Najam |first1=Adil |title=Dr. Pervez Hoodbhoy Responds to Nature Article on Pakistan's Higher Education Reform |url=http://pakistaniat.com/2009/09/05/hoodbhoy-nature-pakistan-education-reform/ |accessdate=13 February 2015 |agency=Pakistaniaat |publisher=Pakistaniaat |date=9 September 2009 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626160300/http://pakistaniat.com/2009/09/05/hoodbhoy-nature-pakistan-education-reform/ |archivedate=26 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Administrative competency of [[Higher Education Commission (Pakistan)|HEC]] was called into question by Hoodbhoy who describe the [[Higher Education Commission (Pakistan)|HEC]]'s achievement "dismal".&lt;ref name="Dawn newspapers, 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hassan|first1=Shazia|title=HEC lost track by focusing on quantity rather than quality'|url=http://dawn.com/news/773021/hec-lost-track-by-focusing-on-quantity-rather-than-quality|accessdate=13 February 2015|agency=Dawn newspapers, 2012|publisher=Dawn newspapers, 2012|date=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoodbhoy supported his arguments against [[Higher Education Commission (Pakistan)|HEC]]'s productivity, that in the case of [[Lille University of Science and Technology|UESTP-France]] convention in [[Karachi]], out of an expected faculty strength of between 450 and 600, no French faculty or administrative staff actually arrived.&lt;ref name="Dawn newspapers, 2012" /&gt; At the television debate, Hoodbhoy questioned the statistics used to support the positive appraisal of HEC's activities in a series of communications between Hoodbhoy and HEC chairman Atta-Ur-Rehman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HEC's performance by Atta ur Rehman|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYiNGvfbM-A|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hoodbhoy|title=The HEC {{sic|nolink=y|Controvery}}- Separating Fact and fiction|url=https://vimeo.com/61231182|website=Vimeo}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was claimed by the latter that in mathematics, Pakistani authors received 20% more citations than the worldwide average. Hoodbhoy questioned this on several grounds including the number of self-citations these publications received and said that this was a crucial aspect that the HEC left out of its interpretation. Criticism was leveled by Hoodbhoy at the practice of hiring those foreign academics in local universities who were said to have difficulty in communicating and teaching, although they contributed to boosting the number of research publications originating from Pakistani universities.

=== Research ===
Hoodbhoy has made important contributions in physics, particularly in particle physics. Many of Hoodbhoy's recorded lectures on physics are available online.&lt;ref&gt;http://urduphysicslectures.blogspot.com/&lt;/ref&gt; At [[National Center for Physics]], Hoodbhoy conducted research on different aspects of particle physics, and pioneered studies in modern physics and its extension to mathematical and nuclear physics. In 2006, Hoodbhoy published a brief mathematical description of [[Generalized Parton Distributions]]. In 2007, Hoodbhoy re-published the work of Jens Lyng Peterson the [[AdS/CFT correspondence|Maldacena conjecture]] (a conjectured equivalence between a string theory and gravity defined on one space, and a quantum field theory without gravity defined by one or less dimension) where he contributed mathematically to the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference | first =Jens Lyng | last =Peterson | authorlink = |author2=Dr. Prof. Pervez Hoodbhoy | title=Introduction to Maldacena conjecture | pages=41| publisher =Dr. Pervez Hoodbhoy of National Center for Physics; Second National Winter Meeting on Particles and Fields and Jens Lyng Peterson | date = 28–31 December 2009 | location =Islamabad, Islamabad Capital Territory | url=http://www.ncp.edu.pk/docs/snwm/Pervez_hoodbhoy_003_Intro_to_Maldacena_Conjecture.pdf | doi = | accessdate =January 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he re-published the work of [[Edward Witten]] on [[Anti-de Sitter space]] and its extension to the field of [[Holography]]. While the paper was published experimentally in 1998 by Witten, Hoodbhoy provided the brief mathematical proofs and description to understand, logically, the subject of Sitter space— a [[scalar curvature]] in general theory of relativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference | first=Dr. Prof. Edward | last=Witten | authorlink =Edward Witten |author2=Dr. Prof. Pervez Hoodbhoy | title =Anti de Sitter Space and Holography|pages =41| publisher=Dr. Pervez Hoodbhoy of National Center for Physics; Second National Winter Meeting on Particles and Fields and Edward Witten (1998)| date = 28–31 December 2009 | location =Islamabad, Islamabad Capital Territory |url=http://www.ncp.edu.pk/docs/snwm/Pervez_hoodbhoy_004_Holography_Witten.pdf | doi = | accessdate=January 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 April 2001, it was announced that Dr. Hoodbhoy would be receiving [[Sitara-e-Imtiaz|''Sitara-i-Imtiaz'']] from the former [[President of Pakistan|President]], General (retired) [[Pervez Musharraf]] which he refused to accept. His refusal prompted the [[The Friday Times|''Friday Times'']] to interview him.

{{quote|text=I am reasonably [satisfied] with my (scientific) work... I do not think it is earth-shaking or... that it deserves any kind of [award]. On the other hand, receiving an [award] – even if it is a high national award – would give me absolutely no sense of achievement or satisfaction... because it carries no credibility or prestige in professional circles. Such things do not indicate that you have done good work in your field. Therefore I decided to refuse the award.|sign=Pervez Hoodbhoy, &lt;small&gt;issued the statement on ''The Friday Times'', 2001&lt;/small&gt;|source=&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chowk.com/articles/5034 Chowk]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Filmography ===
He produced a 13-part documentary series in [[Urdu]] for [[Pakistan Television]] on critical issues in education, and two series aimed at popularising science. In 2004, he made a documentary film '[[Crossing the Lines]]: Kashmir, Pakistan, India' along with Dr. [[Zia Mian]].&lt;ref&gt;CGPACS (2006) [http://www.socsci.uci.edu/files/socsci/announcements/060512_hoodbhoy/crossingthelines.htm Crossing the Lines: Kashmir, Pakistan, India]&lt;/ref&gt; These documentaries carry heavy emphasis on the issues of education, public health and scientific revolution in Pakistan.

In his documentaries, Dr. Hoodbhoy has heavily criticised Pakistan and India's nuclear weapons program. He also pointed out the seriousness of the Talibanization in Pakistan and its immediate effects on South Asia. His documentaries also point out that American and [[NATO]] forces in Afghanistan didn't help the Afghan people's life and there was no reform in Afghanistan's social and public sector and, instead, the insurgency and corruption grew, which also destabilised Pakistan's western front.&lt;ref name="Fulbright Program"/&gt;

The '''Philosophy Now Festival''' is a large philosophy festival held every two years in central London.

The Festival is hosted and organised by the newsstand magazine [[Philosophy Now]], which aims to take philosophy to the widest possible audience. The Festival is open to the general public, at little or no cost.

The first Philosophy Now Festival was held in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://now-here-this.timeout.com/2011/12/17/philosophy-now-festival/|title=I Think, Therefore I Am Attending the Philosophy Now Festival|work=Time Out|date=17 December 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was held partly to mark the 20th anniversary of the launch of [[Philosophy Now]] magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/89/The_Philosophy_Now_Festival|title=The Philosophy Now Festival|work=Philosophy Now|date=March 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the Philosophy Now Festival has become a regular biannual event. The second ''Philosophy Now'' Festival was held in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Philosophy Now Festival 2013 {{!}} Philosophy Now|url=https://philosophynow.org/festival/2013|website=philosophynow.org|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the third in 2015 and the fourth in January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Philosophy Now Festival 2018 {{!}} Philosophy Now|url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/125/The_Philosophy_Now_Festival_2018|website=philosophynow.org|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each festival was a one-day event involving contributions from more than a dozen philosophy organisations including [[Philosophy For All]] and the [[Royal Institute of Philosophy]].

== Venue ==
The Festival is held at [[Conway Hall]], a large art deco building in [[Bloomsbury]] in central London.&lt;ref&gt;"Philosophy Now Festival" [http://philevents.org/event/show/1016 PhilEvents] Retrieved 15 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The Festival uses the entire building, and there are usually three or four events running at any one time.

== Against Stupidity Award ==
A regular feature of the Philosophy Now Festival is the presentation of the ''Philosophy Now'' Award for Contributions in the Fight Against Stupidity.&lt;ref name="PNaward"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://philosophynow.org/award|title=Philosophy Now Award for Contributions in the Fight Against Stupidity|access-date=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/8958079/The-worlds-biggest-problem-is-stupidity.html |title=The World's Biggest Problem is Stupidity |work=Daily Telegraph |date=15 December 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This always includes an acceptance speech, sometimes made via a video link.

Before the 2015 Philosophy Now Festival it was announced that the Award would for the first time be given to a children's author, [[Cressida Cowell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/22/cressida-cowell-how-to-train-your-dragon-philosophy-now-award-fight-against-stupidity|title=Children's author Cressida Cowell scoops philosophers' award for fight against stupidity|work=The Guardian|date=22 October 2015 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/authors/cressida-cowell-wins-award-for-combating-stupidity/|title=Cressida Cowell wins award for 'combating stupidity'|work=Daily Telegraph|date=22 October 2015|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reference''' is a relation between objects in which one object designates, or acts as a means by which to connect to or link to, another object. The first object in this relation is said to ''refer to'' the second object. It is called a ''[[name]]'' for the second object. The second object, the one to which the first object refers, is called the ''[[referent]]'' of the first object. A name is usually a [[phrase]] or expression, or some other [[Symbol|symbolic representation]]. Its referent may be anything – a material object, a person, an event, an activity, or an abstract concept.

References can take on many forms, including: a thought, a sensory perception that is [[Hearing (sense)|audible]] ([[onomatopoeia]]), [[visual perception|visual]] (text), [[olfaction|olfactory]], or tactile, [[emotions|emotional state]], relationship with other,&lt;ref&gt;Treanor, Brian, ''Aspects of alterity: Levinas, Marcel, and the contemporary debate'', Fordham University Press, 2006, p.41&lt;/ref&gt; [[spacetime]] coordinate, [[symbolic system|symbolic]] or [[alpha-numeric grid|alpha-numeric]], a physical object or an energy projection. In some cases, methods are used that intentionally hide the reference from some observers, as in [[cryptography]].

References feature in many spheres of human activity and knowledge, and the term adopts shades of meaning particular to the contexts in which it is used. Some of them are described in the sections below.

==Etymology and meanings==
The word ''reference'' is derived from [[Middle English]] ''referren'', from [[Middle French]] ''référer'', from [[Latin]] ''referre'', "to carry back", formed from the [[prefix]] ''re''- and ''ferre'', "to bear".&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Ernest, ''A comprehensive etymological dictionary of the English language'', Vol II, Elsevier publishing company, Amsterdam, 1969, p.1317&lt;/ref&gt; A number of words derive from the same root, including ''refer'', ''[[referee]]'', ''referential'', ''[[referent]]'', ''[[referendum]]''.

The verb ''refer (to)'' and its derivatives may carry the sense of "link to" or "connect to", as in the meanings of ''reference'' described in this article. Another sense is "consult"; this is reflected in such expressions as [[reference work]], [[reference desk]], [[job reference]], etc.

== Semantics ==
{{further|Sense and reference|Theory of reference}}
[[File:Ogden semiotic triangle.png|thumb|right|220px|The [[triangle of reference]], from the influential book ''[[The Meaning of Meaning]]'' (1923) by [[C. K. Ogden]] and [[I. A. Richards]].]]
In [[semantics]], reference is generally construed as the relationships between [[noun]]s or [[pronoun]]s and objects that are named by them. Hence, the [[word]] "John" refers to the person John. The word "it" refers to some previously specified object. The object referred to is called the ''[[referent]]'' of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Semantics|first = John | last = Saeed|page = 12|publisher = Blackwell |isbn = 0-631-22693-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the word-object relation is called "[[denotation]]"; the word denotes the object. The converse relation, the relation from object to word, is called "[[exemplification]]"; the object exemplifies what the word denotes. In syntactic analysis, if a word refers to a previous word, the previous word is called the "[[Antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]]".

===Meaning===
[[Gottlob Frege]] argued that reference cannot be treated as identical with [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]: "[[Hesperus]]" (an ancient Greek name for the evening star) and "[[Phosphorus]]" (an ancient Greek name for the morning star) both refer to [[Venus]], but the astronomical fact that '"Hesperus" is "Phosphorus"' can still be informative, even if the "meanings" of "Hesperus" and "Phosphorus" are already known. This problem led Frege to distinguish between the [[sense and reference]] of a word. Some cases seem to be too complicated to be classified within this framework; the acceptance of the notion of [[secondary reference]] may be necessary to fill the gap. See also [[Opaque context]].

===Linguistic sign===
The very concept of the [[linguistic sign]] is the combination of content and expression, the former of which may refer entities in the world or refer more abstract concepts, e.g. thought.
Certain parts of speech exist only to express reference, namely [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphora]] such as [[pronoun]]s. The subset of reflexives expresses co-reference of two participants in a sentence.  These could be the [[Agent (grammar)|agent]] (actor) and patient (acted on), as in "The man washed himself", the theme and recipient, as in "I showed Mary to herself", or various other possible combinations.

==Computer science==
{{Main|Reference (computer science)}}
In [[computer science]], [[Reference (computer science)|reference]]s are [[data type]]s that refer to an object elsewhere in memory and are used to construct a wide variety of [[data structure]]s, such as [[linked list]]s. Generally, a reference is a value that enables a program to directly access the particular data item. Most [[programming language]]s support some form of reference. For the specific type of reference used in the [[C++]] language, see [[reference (C++)]].

The notion of reference is also important in relational [[database theory]]; see [[referential integrity]].

==Library and information sciences==
{{see also|Reference work|Reference desk}}

References to many types of printed matter may come in an electronic or machine-readable form. For books, there exists the [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]] and for journal articles, the [[Digital object identifier|Digital object identifier (DOI)]] is gaining relevance. Information on the [[Internet]] may be referred to by a [[Uniform Resource Identifier|Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)]].

==Psychology==
In terms of mental processing, a [[self-reference]] is used in psychology to establish identification with a mental state during self-analysis. This seeks to allow the individual to develop own frames of reference in a greater state of immediate awareness. However, it can also lead to circular reasoning, preventing evolution of thought.&lt;ref&gt;Engle, Eric, ''Lex Naturalis, Ius Naturalis: Law as Positive Reasoning &amp; Natural Rationality'', The Rlias Clark Group, Melbourne, 2010, p.75&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Perceptual Control Theory (PCT), a reference condition is the state toward which a control system's output tends to alter a controlled quantity. The main proposition is that "All behavior is oriented all of the time around the control of certain quantities with respect to specific reference conditions."&lt;ref&gt;Powers, William, ''Behavior: The Control of Perception'', 2nd ed., Benchmark Publications, New Canaan, Connecticut, 2005, pp.47 &amp; 299&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==
In academics and scholarship, an author-title-date information in [[Bibliography|bibliographies]] and [[footnote]]s, specifying complete works of other people. Copying of material by another author without proper citation or without required permissions is [[plagiarism]].

Keeping a [[diary]] allows an individual to use references for personal organization, whether or not anyone else understands the systems of reference used. However, scholars have studied methods of reference because of their key role in communication and co-operation between ''different'' people, and also because of misunderstandings that can arise. Modern academic study of reference has been developing since the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;
Reimer, Marga (2009). "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reference Reference]". ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In scholarship, a reference may be a [[citation]] of a text that has been used in the creation of a piece of work such as an essay, report, or oration. Its primary purpose is to allow people who read such work to examine the author's sources, either for [[Validity (logic)|validity]] or to learn more about the subject. Such items are often listed at the end of an article or book in a section marked "[[Bibliography]]" or "References". A bibliographical section often contains works not cited by the author, but used as background reading or listed as potentially useful to the reader. A reference section contains only those works cited by the author(s) in the main text.

==Law==
In [[patent]] law, a reference is a document that can be used to show the state of knowledge at a given time and that therefore may make a [[claim (patent)|claim]]ed [[invention]] [[Inventive step and non-obviousness|obvious]] or [[Novelty (patent)#United States|anticipated]]. Examples of references are patents of any country, magazine articles, [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] theses that are indexed and thus accessible to those interested in finding information about the subject matter, and to some extent Internet material that is similarly accessible.

==Arts==
In [[art]], a reference is an item from which a work is based. This may include:
* an existing artwork,
* a reproduction (i.e., photo),
* directly observed object (i.e., person), or
* the artist's memory.
Another example of reference is [[Sampling (music)|samples]] of various musical works being incorporated into a new one.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7214">{{Rosary}}
The '''Rosary of the Seven Sorrows''', also known as the ''Chaplet of Seven Sorrows'' or the '''Servite Rosary''', is a [[Rosary based prayer]] that originated with  the [[Servite Order]].&lt;ref&gt;Ann Ball, 2003 ''Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices'' {{ISBN|0-87973-910-X}} page 487&lt;/ref&gt; It is often said in connection with the [[Seven Sorrows of Mary]].

It is a [[rosary-based prayers|rosary]] consisting of a ring of seven groups of seven beads separated by a small medal depicting one of the sorrows of Mary, or a single bead. A further series of three beads and a medal are also attached to the chain (before the first "sorrow") and these are dedicated to prayer in honour of Mary's Tears, as well as to indicate the beginning of the chaplet. Conventionally the beads are of black wood or some other black material indicating sorrow. It has also been called the Seven Swords Rosary referring to the prophecy of Simeon: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Behold this child is set for the fall, and for the resurrection of many in Israel, and for a sign which shall be contradicted; and thy own soul a sword shall pierce, that, out of many hearts, thoughts may be revealed."'' - (Lk.2:34-35)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It received approval through the grant of [[indulgence]]s by [[Pope Benedict XII]], [[Pope Clement XII]], and [[Pope Clement XIII]].

==History==
{{Main article|Servite Order}}

This devotion to the Our Sorrowful Mother was originated in the thirteenth century, when seven professional men from Florence, which was an important commercial center of Europe,  were influenced by the penitential spirit common to the Brothers of Penance with whom they were in close contact.  In 1240 they withdrew from the world to pray and serve the Lord, leading a life of penance, prayer and service to Mary. Because of so many visitors, they retreated again to [[Monte Senario]], where the [[Servite Order|Servites (Servants of Mary)]] was formed. By 1244, under the direction of [[St. Peter of Verona]], they began to wear a religious habit similar to the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and began to live under the [[rule of Saint Augustine]]. The Servites devoted their prayer to the rosary of the Seven Sorrows. The choice of the number was derived from the symbolic value of the number seven, suggesting fullness, completeness, and abundance. Consequently, only the principal sorrows are listed.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;

The chaplet recalls the Sorrows the Virgin Mother of God endured in compassion for the suffering and death of her Divine Son. The Seven Dolors are taken from Scripture events and the devotion has a long history, and developed gradually. Before [[Pope Pius VII]]'s formal approval, the Servite Order had permission in 1668 to celebrate the Feast of the Seven Dolors because the Order was instrumental in popularizing the Seven Sorrows Devotion. Members of the Servite Order actively promoted the Chaplet of the Seven Sorrows during the time of the Black Death (1347-1351).&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Up_vo0S_S1wC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;dq=rosary+of+the+seven+sorrows&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jC9FVcLKPM-NyASSlIGwCg&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=rosary%20of%20the%20seven%20sorrows&amp;f=false Miller, John D., ''Beads and Prayers: The Rosary in History and Devotion'', A&amp;C Black, 2002] {{ISBN|9780860123200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each sorrow is announced, (and in some versions of the recitation, a meditatory prayer is said, or a segment from the Hymn ''[[Stabat Mater Dolorosa]]''). Then on the separate bead an [[Lord's Prayer|Our Father]] is said, followed by a [[Hail Mary]] for each of the seven beads. Some then close the septet of Hail Marys with a brief invocation to Our Lady of Sorrows (Commonly: ''"Sorrowful and Immaculate Heart of Mary pray for us"''), or a [[Glory Be]]. The next sorrow is then announced, and carried out in the same manner until all seven have been meditated upon. The three Hail Marys dedicated to her tears are said and then a closing prayer is said, the most commonly known or traditional closing prayer in the English speaking world is the following:

R. That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Let us pray.''

Grant us this favor, O Saviour of the world, Who liveth and reigneth with the Father and the Holy Ghost, forever and ever. Amen.&lt;ref&gt;St. John, A. (1857).

On July 2, 2001, the [[Holy See]] released a declaration of Bishop [[Augustin Misago]] of Gikongoro, on [[Marian apparitions|apparitions]] that took place in 1982-83 in [[Kibeho|Kibeho, Rwanda]] indicating that they were worthy of belief. Visionaries reported appearances by Mary who identified herself as ''Our Lady of the Word''. Mary instructed one of the visionaries ([[Marie-Claire Mukangango]]) to spread devotion of the Seven Sorrows Rosary. According to the visionary she is quoted as saying:&lt;ref name="To avoid a horrible war"&gt;[http://www.michaeljournal.org/kibeho.htm To avoid a horrible war]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;“One must meditate on the Passion of Jesus, and on the deep sorrows of His Mother. One must recite the Rosary every day, and also the Rosary of the Seven Sorrows of Mary, to obtain the favour of repentance.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8992">The '''science of value''', or '''value science''', is a creation of philosopher [[Robert S. Hartman]], which attempts to formally elucidate [[value theory]] using both [[formal logic|formal]] and [[Symbolic logic#Symbolic logic|symbolic logic]].

==Fundamentals==
The fundamental principle, which functions as an [[axiom]], and can be stated in symbolic logic, is that ''a thing is good insofar as it exemplifies its concept''. To put it another way, "a thing is good if it has all its descriptive properties." This means, according to Hartman, that the good thing has a name, that the name has a meaning defined by a set of properties, and that the thing possesses all of the properties in the set. A thing is bad if it does not fulfill its description.  If it doesn't fulfill its definition it is terrible (awful, miserable). A car, by definition, has brakes. A car which accelerates when the brakes are applied is an awful car, since a car by definition must have brakes. A horse, if we called it a car, would be an even worse car, with fewer of the properties of a car.  The name we put on things is very important: it sets the norm for how we judge them.

He introduces three basic dimensions of value, ''[[:wikt:systemic|systemic]]'', ''[[extrinsic]]'' and ''[[intrinsic]]'' for sets of properties—''perfection'' is to ''systemic value'' what ''goodness'' is to ''extrinsic value'' and what ''uniqueness'' is to ''intrinsic value''—each with their own [[cardinality]]: finite, &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;. In practice, the terms "good" and "bad" apply to finite sets of [[properties]], since this is the only case where there is a ratio between the total number of desired properties and the number of such properties possessed by some object being valued.  (In the case where the number of properties is [[countably infinite]], the ''extrinsic'' dimension of value, the ''[[:wikt:exposition|exposition]]'' as well as the mere definition of a specific concept is taken into consideration.)

Hartman quantifies this notion by the principle that ''each property of the thing is worth as much as each other property, depending on the level of abstraction''. &lt;ref&gt; ''The Structure of Value'', page 204 &lt;/ref&gt; Hence, if a thing has ''n'' properties, each of them—if on the same level of abstraction—is proportionally worth ''n''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. . In other words, a car having brakes or having a gas cap are weighted equally so far as their value goes, so long as both are a part of one's definition of a "car." Since a gas cap is not normally a part of a car's definition, it would be given no weight.  Headlights could be weighed twice, once or not at all depending on how headlights appear in the description of a car. Given a finite set of ''n'' properties, a thing is ''good'' if it is perceived to have all of the properties, ''fair'' if it has more than &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of them, ''average'' if &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of them, and ''bad'' if it has fewer than &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Infinite sets of properties==
Hartman goes on to consider infinite sets of properties. Hartman claims that ''according to a theorem of transfinite mathematics, any collection of material objects is at most denumerably infinite''. &lt;ref&gt; ''The Structure of Value'', page 117 &lt;/ref&gt; This is not, in fact, a theorem of mathematics. But, according to Hartman, people are capable of a [[denumerably infinite]] set of predicates, intended in as many ways, which he gives as &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;. As this yields a notional [[cardinality of the continuum]], Hartman advises that when setting out to describe a person, a continuum of properties would be most fitting and appropriate to bear in mind. This is the cardinality of ''intrinsic value'' in Hartman's system.

Although they play no role in ordinary mathematics, Hartman deploys the notion of [[aleph number]] reciprocals, as a sort of infinitesimal proportion. This, he contends goes to zero in the limit as the uncountable cardinals become larger. In Hartman's calculus, for example, the assurance in a [[Dear John letter]], that "we will always be friends" has axiological value &lt;math&gt;\frac{_1}{\aleph_2}&lt;/math&gt;, whereas taking a metaphor literally would be slightly preferable, the [[Reification (fallacy)|reification]] having a value of &lt;math&gt;\frac{_1}{\aleph_1}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Evaluation of Hartman's work==
Hartman invented the Hartman Value Profile, which is however not a description of what ''is'' valuable, but a test to determine what people regard as valuable.  It measures concept-formation and decision-making capacity.  A Hartman festschrift (''Values and Valuation'') appeared a few years after his death.  Some critics would claim that most of the articles in it are not by Hartman supporters. Hartman, some critics claim, is out of the mainstream of value philosophy, but he was asked by UNESCO to summarize the state of Value Theory at Mid-Century. Many would dispute the idea that the number of properties of a thing can in any meaningful way be enumerated, but this is something Hartman never said was necessary.  A standard argument against enumeration is that new properties can be defined in terms of old ones.  Adding more features, a critic could object, even if each seems to be a good one, can sometimes lead to the overall value going down. In this way we get over-engineered software or a remote control which has too many buttons on it.  Hartman holds that "the name (that one puts on a concept) sets the norm" so he would rejoin that a "Remote with ''too many'' buttons" is a disvalue.

From a mathematician's point of view, much of Hartman's work in ''The Structure of Value'' is rather novel and does not use conventional mathematical methodology, nor axiomatic reasoning. However he later employed the mathematics of topological compact, connected [[Hausdorff spaces]], interpreting them as a model for the value-structure of [[metaphor]], in a paper on [[aesthetics]].

Hartman, following [[Georg Cantor]], uses [[Infinite (cardinality)|infinite cardinalities]]. As a stipulated definition, he posits the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]] of [[transfinite cardinal]] numbers. These, together with the algebraic [[laws of exponents]], enables him to construct what is today known as The Calculus of Values. In his paper "The Measurement of Value," Hartman explain how he calculates the value of such items as Christmas shopping in terms of this calculus.  While inverses of infinite quantities (''[[infinitesimal]]s'') exist in certain systems of numbers, such as [[hyperreal numbers]] and [[surreal numbers]], these are not reciprocals of cardinal numbers.

Hartman supporters maintain that it is not necessary for properties to be actually enumerated, only that they exist and can correspond [[bijective]]ly (one-to-one) to the property-names comprising the meaning of the concept. The attributes in the meaning of a concept only "consist" as stipulations; they don't ''exist''.  Questions regarding the existence of a concept belong to [[ontology]].

Intensional attributes can resemble, but are not identical to, the properties perceived by the five senses. Attributes are names of properties. When, even partially, the properties of a thing match the attributes of that thing in the mind of the one making the judgment, the thing will be said to have "value".  When they completely correspond, the thing will be called "good".  These are basic ideas in value science.

'''Silhak''' was a [[Korean Confucianism|Korean Confucian]] social reform movement in late [[Joseon Dynasty]]. ''Sil'' means "actual" or "practical," and ''hak'' means "studies" or "learning." It developed in response to the increasingly metaphysical nature of [[Neo-Confucianism]] (성리학) that seemed disconnected from the rapid agricultural, industrial, and political changes occurring in [[Korea]] between the late 17th and early 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/693609/Korea/35015/Silhak-and-popular-culture Korea (historical nation, Asia) :: Silhak and popular culture - Britannica Online Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Silhak was designed to counter the "uncritical" following of Confucian teachings and the strict adherence to "formalism" and "ritual" by neo-Confucians.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0877790442&amp;id=ZP_f9icf2roC&amp;pg=PA864&amp;lpg=PA864&amp;dq=silhak&amp;sig=qu-XlnIyExDnT1yg1jzQdW8zvMk Merriam-Webster's encyclopedia of world religions - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Silhak scholars were from factions excluded from power and other disaffected scholars calling for reform.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0765614286&amp;id=hkRbZQogLA4C&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;printsec=8&amp;dq=silhak&amp;sig=DXept7ZHm0jE8lmggzLSV3TTGac Transforming Korean politics: democracy, reform, and culture - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They advocated an empirical Confucianism deeply concerned with human society at the practical level.&lt;ref name="ekoreajournal.net"&gt;[http://www.ekoreajournal.net/archive/detail.jsp?BACKFLAG=Y&amp;VOLUMENO=46&amp;BOOKNUM=4&amp;PAPERNUM=8&amp;SEASON=Winter&amp;YEAR=2006 ::: Welcome to KOREA JOURNAL :::&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026230432/http://www.ekoreajournal.net/archive/detail.jsp?BACKFLAG=Y&amp;VOLUMENO=46&amp;BOOKNUM=4&amp;PAPERNUM=8&amp;SEASON=Winter&amp;YEAR=2006 |date=2007-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its proponents generally argued for reforming the rigid Confucian social structure, land reforms to relieve the plight of peasant farmers, promoting Korea's own national identity and culture, encouraging the study of science, and advocating technology exchange with foreign countries.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN3110147971&amp;id=VZ8zdt5d3ugC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;printsec=8&amp;dq=silhak&amp;sig=-29rAgv0BKSQ8CWRqPYzNfRF4t4 Religion and social formation in Korea: minjung and millenarianism - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Silhak scholars wanted to use realistic and experimental approaches to social problems with the consideration of the welfare of the people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1840649712&amp;id=Ik4nJ8oTn9YC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;q=silhak&amp;vq=silhak&amp;dq=silhak&amp;sig=JQxY3qcDv-h7HMyFA44Jsov4XeE Elites and political power in South Korea - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Silhak scholars encouraged human equality and moved toward a more Korean-centric view of Korean history.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The Silhak school is credited with helping to create a modern Korea.

'''''Sokushin zebutsu''''' ({{CJKV|j=即心是佛}}), rendered in English as '''''Mind is Itself Buddha''''', is a book of the [[Shōbōgenzō]] by the 13th century [[Sōtō]] [[Zen]] monk [[Eihei Dōgen]]. It was written in the spring of 1239 at Dōgen's monastery [[Kōshōhōrin-ji]] in [[Kyoto]].&lt;ref name=Gudo&gt;{{Citation| last1 =Nishijima|first1=Gudo|last2=Cross|first2=Chodo|authorlink1=Gudo Nishijima|year = 1994| title = Master Dogen's Shōbōgenzō| volume=1|pages=65–73|publisher = Dogen Sangha| isbn=1-4196-3820-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book appears as the fifth book in both the 75 and 60 fascicle versions of the [[Shōbōgenzō]], and it is ordered sixth in the later chronological 95 fascicle ''Honzan'' editions.&lt;ref name=textual&gt;{{citation|last=Heine|first=Steven|title=Dōgen: Textual and Historical Studies|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|page=39|isbn=978-0-19-975447-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title ''Sokushin zebutsu'' is an utterance attributed to the 8th century [[Song Dynasty]] Zen monk [[Mazu Daoyi]] in a well known [[kōan]] that appears most notably as Case 30 in [[The Gateless Gate|The Gateless Barrier]], although Dōgen would have known it from the earlier [[Transmission of the Lamp]]. In addition to this book of the Shōbōgenzō, Dōgen also discusses the phrase ''Sokushin zebutsu'' in several of his formal Dharma Hall Discourses, namely numbers 8, 75, 319, and 370, all of which are recorded in the [[Eihei Kōroku]].&lt;ref name=koroku&gt;{{citation|last1=Leighton|first1=Taigen Dan|last2=Okumura|first2=Shohaku|title=Dōgen's Extensive Record: A Translation of the Eihei Kōroku|publisher=Wisdom Publications|year=2010|page=588|isbn=978-086171-670-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dōgen's book ''Sokushin zebutsu'' lays out his understanding of this phrase, rendered in English as ''mind is itself Buddha''. He quickly notes that he views as incorrect the interpretation that the "ordinary thoughts and awareness of sentient beings" are already Buddha. He states that instead, "''Sokushin zebutsu'' is buddhas of aspiration, practice, awakening, and nirvana. Those who have not actualized aspiration, practice, awakening, and nirvana are not ''sokushin zebutsu''.” While aspiration, practice, awakening, and nirvana are a version of the [[four stages of enlightenment]] and are normally thought of a series of steps one must go through to achieve a final goal, Dōgen writes in the Shōbōgenzō book [[Gyōji (Shōbōgenzō)|Gyōji]], "Where aspiration is present, there is already practice. Practice is itself awakening. This practice-awakening is nirvana. Thus “aspiration, practice, awakening, and nirvana” are not sequential stages. All are one." Thus, for Dōgen, ''sokushin zebutsu'' is identical to practice, or [[zazen]]. Further, at the conclusion of the essay, Dōgen writes, “The buddhas spoken of  here  are  none  other  than [[Gautama Buddha|Shakayamuni Buddha]].  Shakyamuni  Buddha  is ''sokushin  zebutsu''. When  all  buddhas  in  the  past,  present,  and  future  are  buddhas,  they  unfailingly  become Shakyamuni Buddha". Dōgen thus equates mind, Buddhas, Shakyamuni  Buddha, [[Bodhicitta]], practice or zazen, awakening, and enlightenment, offering a characteristic teaching in [[nondualism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Tsunoda|first1=Tairyu|last2=Fujita|first2=Issho|title=Sokushin Zebutsu: The Mind Itself is Buddha|url=http://global.sotozen-net.or.jp/eng/library/key_terms/pdf/key_terms04.pdf|publisher=Sōto School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''spiritual gift''' or '''charism''' (plural: '''charisms''' or '''charismata'''; in [[Greek language|Greek]] singular: [[wikt:χάρισμα|χάρισμα]]
&lt;small&gt;''charism''&lt;/small&gt;, plural: χαρίσματα &lt;small&gt;''charismata''&lt;/small&gt;) is an endowment or extraordinary power given by the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]] &lt;ref name=DotBSpiritGifts&gt;"Spiritual gifts". ''A Dictionary of the Bible'' by W. R. F. Browning. Oxford University Press Inc. ''Oxford Reference Online''. Oxford University Press. Accessed 22 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{AHDict|charisma}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the supernatural [[Grace (Christianity)|graces]] which individual Christians need (and were needed in the days of the [[Apostles]]) to fulfill the mission of the [[Christian Church|Church]].&lt;ref name=ODCCcharismata&gt;"Charismata". ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. Ed F. L. Cross and E. A. Livingstone. Oxford University Press Inc. ''Oxford Reference Online''. Oxford University Press. Accessed 22 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Grudem&gt;Wayne Grudem, ''Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Biblical Doctrine'' (Zondervan, 1994): 1016–17.&lt;/ref&gt; In the narrowest sense, it is a [[theology|theological]] term for the extraordinary graces given to individual Christians for the good of others and is distinguished from the graces given for personal [[sanctification]], such as the [[Seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit]] and the [[fruit of the Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref name="cathen"/&gt;

These extraordinary spiritual gifts, often termed "charismatic gifts", are the [[word of wisdom]], the [[word of knowledge]], increased [[Faith in Christianity|faith]], the [[gifts of healing]], the [[gift of miracles]], [[prophecy]], the [[discernment of spirits]], diverse [[Speaking in tongues|kinds of tongues]], [[interpretation of tongues]]. To these are added the gifts of [[Apostle (Christian)|apostles]], [[prophet]]s, teachers, helps (connected to service of the poor and sick), and governments (or leadership ability) which are connected with certain offices in the Church. These gifts are given by the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] to individuals, but their purpose is to build up the entire Church.&lt;ref name="cathen"/&gt; They are described in the [[New Testament]], primarily in 1 Corinthians 12,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians%2012-12&amp;version=NIV 1 Corinthians 12 ]&lt;/ref&gt; Romans 12,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%2012-12&amp;version=NIV Romans 12]&lt;/ref&gt; and Ephesians 4.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians%204-4&amp;version=NIV Ephesians 4]&lt;/ref&gt; 1 Peter 4&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+peter%204-4&amp;version=NIV 1 Peter 4]&lt;/ref&gt; also touches on the spiritual gifts.&lt;ref name=DotBSpiritGifts/&gt;

The gifts are related to both seemingly "natural" abilities and seemingly more "miraculous" abilities, empowered by the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref name=Grudem/&gt; The two major opposing theological positions on their nature is that they [[cessationism|ceased long ago]] or that they [[continuationism|continue]] ([[Cessationism versus Continuationism]]).

==Biblical and theological overview==
The New Testament contains several lists of spiritual gifts, most authored by [[St. Paul]]. While each list is unique, there is overlap.

Christians believe that the ''charismata'' were foretold by the [[Book of Joel|Prophet Joel]] (2:28) and promised by [[Christ]] ([[Gospel of Mark]] 16:17–18). This promise was fulfilled on the [[Day of Pentecost]] and elsewhere as the church spread. In order to correct abuses concerning the spiritual gifts at [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], Paul devoted much attention to spiritual gifts in his [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] (chapters 12–14).&lt;ref name="cathen"/&gt;

In 1 Corinthians 12, two Greek terms are translated as "spiritual gifts". In verse 1, the word ''pneumatika'' ("spirituals" or "things of the Spirit") is used. In verse 4, ''[[charisma]]'' is used. This word is derived from the word ''charis'', which means "[[Grace in Christianity|grace]]". In verses 5 and 6, the words ''diakonia'' (translated "administrations", "ministries", or "service") and ''energemata'' ("operations" or "inworkings") are used in describing the nature of the spiritual gifts. In verse 7, the term "manifestation (''phanerosis'') of the Spirit" is used.&lt;ref name=foundations332-333&gt;Guy P. Duffield and Nathaniel M. Van Cleave, ''Foundations of Pentecostal Theology'', 1983, (Los Angeles: Foursquare Media, 2008), pp. 332–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

From these scriptural passages, Christians understand the spiritual gifts to be enablements or capacities that are divinely bestowed upon individuals. Because they are freely given by God, these cannot be earned or merited. Though worked through individuals, these are operations or manifestations of the Holy Spirit—not of the gifted person. They are to be used for the benefit of others, and in a sense they are granted to the church as a whole more than they are given to individuals. There is diversity in their distribution—an individual will not possess all of the gifts.&lt;ref name=foundations332-333/&gt; The purpose of the spiritual gifts is to edify (build up), exhort (encourage), and comfort the church.&lt;ref name=foundations334&gt;Duffield and Van Cleave, ''Foundations of Pentecostal Theology'', p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is generally acknowledged that Paul did not list all of the gifts of the Spirit,&lt;ref name="cathen"/&gt; and many believe that there are as many gifts as there are needs in the [[body of Christ]].&lt;ref name=foundations335&gt;Duffield and Van Cleave, ''Foundations of Pentecostal Theology'', p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; The gifts have at times been organized into distinct categories based on their similarities and differences to other gifts. Some divide them into three categories using [[Old Testament]] offices. "Prophetic" gifts include any gift involving teaching, encouraging, or rebuking others. "Priestly" gifts include showing mercy and care for the needy or involve intercession before God. "Kingly" gifts are those involving church administration or government.&lt;ref name=Grudem1021&gt;Grudem, ''Systematic Theology'', p. 1021.&lt;/ref&gt; Others categorize them into "gifts of knowledge" (word of wisdom, word of knowledge, distinguishing between spirits), "gifts of speech" (tongues, interpretation, prophecy), and "gifts of power" (faith, healing, miracles).&lt;ref&gt;Sumrall, Lester "The Gifts of the Holy Spirit" p. 25 Aug 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The gifts have also been categorized as those that promote the inner growth of the church (apostle, prophecy, distinguishing between spirits, teaching, word of wisdom/knowledge, helps, and administration) and those that promote the church's outer development (faith, miracles, healing, tongues, interpretation of tongues).&lt;ref name="cathen"/&gt;

Proponents of cessationism distinguish between the "extraordinary", "miraculous", or "sign" gifts (such as prophecy, tongues, and healing) and the other gifts.&lt;ref name=Easton&gt;Easton, Matthew George. [http://www.ccel.org/e/easton/ebd/ebd/T0001400.html#T0001484 "Gifts, spiritual"]. ''[[Easton's Bible Dictionary]]''. 1897. Accessed June 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Cessationism is held by some Protestants, especially from the [[Calvinist]] tradition, who believe that miraculous gifts and their operations were limited to [[early Christianity]] and "ceased" afterward.&lt;ref name=Ruthven3,7&gt;Ruthven, Jon. [http://www.jon-ruthven.org/cessation.pdf ''On the Cessation of the Charismata: The Protestant Polemic on Post-Biblical Miracles''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319122559/http://www.jon-ruthven.org/Cessation.pdf |date=2009-03-19 }}. Deo Press, 1993, rev. 2008. pp. 3, 7.

In addition, [[Roman Catholicism]]&lt;ref name=RCCCatechism799-800&gt;[http://old.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1sect2chpt3art9p2.shtml Catechism of the Catholic Church 799–800] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019145746/http://old.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1sect2chpt3art9p2.shtml |date=2011-10-19 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] also continue to believe in and make use of all of the spiritual gifts.

==Descriptions==
'''[[Apostle (Christian)|Apostle]]''': The title apostle comes from the Greek word ''apostolos'' which means "a messenger, one sent forth with orders".&lt;ref name=foundations351&gt;Duffield and Van Cleave, ''Foundations of Pentecostal Theology'', p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to one who has been delegated authority by another in a foreign land.&lt;ref name="cathenApostles"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Coppieters | first = Honoré |title = Apostles | encyclopedia = The Catholic Encyclopedia | volume = 1 | publisher = Robert Appleton Company | year = 1907 | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm | accessdate = 22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apostles were the first leaders of the Church; they were commissioned by Jesus to initiate and direct the preaching of the gospel. While many Christians agree that the title of apostle is reserved for those among the first generation of Christians, many Christian denominations continue in one way or another to recognize a continuing apostolic ministry. Many churches, such as the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Churches]], believe in the doctrine of [[apostolic succession]], which holds that properly ordained [[bishop]]s are the successors to the apostles. Other Christian groups, such as classical Pentecostals, consider the role of a [[missionary]] to be fulfilling an apostolic ministry.&lt;ref name=foundations353&gt;Duffield and Van Cleave, ''Foundations of Pentecostal Theology'', p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt; There are some Christians, however, who advocate restoring the [[Fivefold ministry]], including the formal recognition of the office of apostle. Others would say that the office no longer exists.&lt;ref name=Grudem1031&gt;Grudem, ''Systematic Theology'', p. 1031 note 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Prophet]]''': In the New Testament, the office of prophet is to equip the saints for the work of service through exhortation, edification, and consolation  (1 Corinthians 12:28; 1 Corinthians 14:3 Ephesians 4:11).&lt;ref name=foundations353-354&gt;Duffield and Van Cleave, ''Foundations of Pentecostal Theology'', pp. 353–54.&lt;/ref&gt; The prophet's corresponding gift is [[prophecy]]. Prophecy is "reporting something that God spontaneously brings to your mind".&lt;ref name=Grudem1024&gt;Grudem, ''Systematic Theology'', p. 1024.&lt;/ref&gt; Many, particularly Pentecostals and charismatics, distinguish between the "office of prophet" and the "gift of prophecy", believing that a Christian can possess the gift of prophecy without holding the prophetic office.&lt;ref name=foundations339-340,353-355&gt;Duffield and Van Cleave, ''Foundations of Pentecostal Theology'', pp. 339–40, 353–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Evangelism|Evangelist]]''': An evangelist is one who devotes himself to preaching the gospel. In the New Testament, evangelists preached from city to city, church to church.&lt;ref name=foundations356-357&gt;Duffield and Van Cleave, ''Foundations of Pentecostal Theology'', pp. 356–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Pastor]]:''' This term derives from a Greek word for "shepherd". In theory pastors are gifted to lead, guide, and set an example for other Christians. The grammatical structure of Ephesians 4:11 leads many to conclude that teacher and pastor should be considered one term (pastor-teacher). Even so, the two terms are not interchangeable; while all pastors are teachers, not all teachers are pastors. Pastoral Gifts include integrity and compassion. &lt;ref name=foundations357-358&gt;Duffield and Van Cleave, ''Foundations of Pentecostal Theology'', pp. 357–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Teacher:''' Someone who devotes his or her life to preaching and teaching the Christian faith. When teaching is provided for the Church by God, two gifts are actually given—to the Church is given a teacher and along with the teacher comes a divine capacity to teach.&lt;ref name=foundations347-348&gt;Duffield and Van Cleave, ''Foundations of Pentecostal Theology'', pp. 347–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Service''': The word translated as "ministry" is ''diakonia'', which can also be translated "service".&lt;ref name=foundations347-348/&gt; Since there are many types of ministries and service to the Church, this then describes a broad array of gifts rather than a single gift.

'''Exhortation''': The ability to motivate Christians "to patient endurance, brotherly love, and good works".&lt;ref name=foundations348-349&gt;Duffield and Van Cleave, ''Foundations of Pentecostal Theology'', pp. 348–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Giving''': Those with this gift share their own possessions with others with extraordinary generosity. While all Christians should be givers, those possessing this gift will go beyond this normal giving.&lt;ref name=foundations348-349/&gt;

'''Leading''': This gift speaks to the various leadership roles found in the Church. While many think of roles such as administration, management of funds, strategy planning, etc. as functions outside of the supernatural realm, in reality individuals in these positions are just as in need of supernatural empowerment as are ministers of the gospel.&lt;ref name=foundations349-350&gt;Duffield and Van Cleave, ''Foundations of Pentecostal Theology'', pp. 349–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers consider the gifts of governments and leading to be the same gift, but others consider them closely related yet different.

'''[[Mercy]]''': Possibly identical to the gift of helps, the mercy-shower possesses a ministry of visitation, prayer, and compassion to the poor and sick.&lt;ref name=foundations349-350/&gt;

'''[[Word of wisdom]]''': An utterance or message of wisdom supernaturally granted to an individual. For Paul, wisdom refers to "the knowledge of the great Christian mysteries: the Incarnation, Passion, and Resurrection of Christ, and the indwelling in the believer of the Spirit of God (1 Corinthians 2; Ephesians 1:17)".&lt;ref name="cathen"/&gt;

'''[[Word of knowledge]]''': The knowledge referred to is often said to relate to understanding Christian doctrine or scriptural truth.&lt;ref name="cathen"/&gt; It is sometimes said to be connected with the ministry of teachers.

'''[[Faith in Christianity|Faith]]''': This refers to that strong or special faith "which removes mountains, casts out devils ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 17:19–20), and faces the most cruel martyrdom without flinching".&lt;ref name="cathen"/&gt; It is distinguished from the "saving" and "normal" Christian faith.&lt;ref name=foundations336-337&gt;Duffield and Van Cleave, ''Foundations of Pentecostal Theology'', pp. 336–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Gifts of healing]]s''': The ability to supernaturally minister healing to others. The plural indicates the variety of sickness healed and the many forms the gift takes, such as healing by anointing with oil, by the [[laying on of hands]], by saying the name of [[Jesus]] or by the [[sign of the cross]].&lt;ref name="cathen"/&gt;

'''[[Gift of miracles|Working of miracles]]''': The performance of deeds beyond ordinary human ability by the power of the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref name="cathen"/&gt;

'''Visions'''.  An outpouring of this gift is prophesied in Joel 2:28 and Acts 2:17 shows that early Christians believed this prophecy was fulfilled on the day of Pentecost.   Visions tend to be more private experiences than the other gifts. Some researchers expand the definition of visions to include a strongly felt presence.&lt;ref name="Kavan"&gt;{{cite journal

 | issue = 2

 | year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Discerning of spirits]]''': The capacity to discern, distinguish, or to discriminate the source of a spiritual manifestation—whether it emanates from a good or evil spirit. It seemed to have been particularly associated with prophecy as it would be necessary to know whether a prophetic utterance was truly inspired by God.&lt;ref name="cathen"/&gt;&lt;ref name=foundations339-340&gt;Duffield and Van Cleave, ''Foundations of Pentecostal Theology'', pp. 340–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Speaking in tongues|Tongues]]''': The supernatural ability of speaking an unlearned language.&lt;ref name="cathen"/&gt; Paul seems to have distinguished between the public use of the gift (which must always be interpreted) and the private use which was for the spiritual strengthening of oneself.&lt;ref name=foundations345&gt;Duffield and Van Cleave, ''Foundations of Pentecostal Theology'', p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently among Christians there is a dispute as to whether tongues were/are always [[xenoglossy]] (speaking an unlearned human language) or whether it also included/includes [[glossolalia]] (speaking an unlearned and allegedly non-human language of heavenly or angelic origin).

'''[[Interpretation of tongues]]''': This gift always follows the public exercise of the gift of tongues.&lt;ref name="cathen"/&gt; In 1 Corinthians 14, the Apostle Paul required that all speech in Christian worship should be intelligible. This required that speech given in an unknown tongue be interpreted in the common language of the gathered Christians.

'''Helps''': This gift has to do with service to the sick and the poor.&lt;ref name="cathen"/&gt; Possessor of this gift has a "spiritual burden and a God-given love for the needy and afflicted".&lt;ref name=foundations343&gt;Duffield and Van Cleave, ''Foundations of Pentecostal Theology'', p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Administration''': Also called the gift of governing,&lt;ref name="cathen"/&gt; the Greek word translated "governments" is ''kubernesis'', the verb form of which means "to steer" or "to be a helmsman". This gift then refers to the God-given capacity to lead or guide the Church through storms and difficult seas.&lt;ref name=foundations343/&gt;

==Other spiritual gifts==
While not specifically defined as spiritual gifts in the Bible, other abilities and capacities have been considered as spiritual gifts by some Christians. Some are found in the New Testament such as:
* [[celibacy]] (I Corinthians 7:7)&lt;ref&gt;See for example [http://www.midbible.ac.uk/images/stories/Celibacy.pdf "Stephen Vantassel, "Celibacy: The Forgotten Gift of the Spirit," ''Journal of Biblical Counseling''. 12, no. 3 (1994): 20–23"]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 10 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* hospitality (1 Peter 4:9–10)&lt;ref name=foundations358-59&gt;Duffield and Van Cleave, ''Foundations of Pentecostal Theology'', pp. 358–59.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[intercession]] (Rom. 8:26–27)&lt;ref name=foundations358-59/&gt;
* [[marriage]] (I Corinthians 7:7)&lt;ref name=Grudem1020&gt;Grudem, ''Systematic Theology'', p. 1020.&lt;/ref&gt;
* (effective) witnessing (Acts 1:8, 5:32, 26:22, 1 John 5:6)&lt;ref name=foundations358-59/&gt;

Others are found in the Old Testament such as:
* craftsmanship (such as the special abilities given to artisans who constructed the [[Tabernacle]] in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 35:30–33)&lt;ref name=foundations358-59/&gt;
* interpretation of dreams (e.g. Joseph and Daniel) genesis ch43-50, daniel ch3

The word is also used in secular circumstances within [[social psychology]]. In that context, charism is defined as personal influence on other people individually or as a [[Group (sociology)|group]].

[[Religious order]]s (including [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]], [[Catholic church|Catholic]], [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] and [[Methodism|Methodist]]) use the word "charism" to describe their spiritual orientation and any special characteristics of their mission or values that might be exhibited as a result of the vows that they have taken and the orientation of the order to which they belong.  An example might be the works of a [[teaching order]] compared to that of a [[missionary order]] or one devoted to the care of the poor or the sick and those in need of help.

{{Thomism| expanded=works}}
The '''''Summa contra Gentiles''''' (also known as ''{{lang|la|Liber de veritate catholicae fidei contra errores infidelium}}'', "Book on the truth of the Catholic faith against the errors of the unbelievers")&lt;ref&gt;
''Summa contra Gentiles'' is the most commonly used title, found in some of the earliest manuscripts.
The title is sometimes given in the variant ''Summa contra Gentes''.
The longer title is also given as ''Tractatus de fide catholica, contra Gentiles'' [or: ''contra errores infidelium''] ("Tractate on the [[Catholic (term)|universal (catholic)]] faith, against the pagans (or, against the errors of the unbelievers)", 
shortened to ''De fide catholica'' (a shorthand title [[De Fide Catolica|shared with other works]]). 
See: Brian Davies, Eleonore Stump, ''The Oxford Handbook of Aquinas'' (2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=L8hF_adDL5EC&amp;pg=PA533#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 533].
&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the best-known books by [[Saint|St]] [[Thomas Aquinas]], written during c. 1259&amp;ndash;1265.

It was probably written to aid missionaries in explaining the [[Christian religion]] to and [[apologetics|defending it against]] dissenting points of doctrine in [[Islamic theology|Islam]] and [[Jewish theology|Judaism]].
To this end, Aquinas may rely on a substantial body of shared doctrine, especially tenets of [[monotheism]], in the case of Judaism the shared acceptance of the [[Old Testament]] as scripture and in the case of Islam the ([[Aristotelianism#Islamic_world|at the time]]) shared tradition of   [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]].&lt;ref name="GilsonC"/&gt; 
Whereas the ''[[Summa Theologiæ]]'' was written to explain the Christian faith to theology students, the ''Summa contra Gentiles'' is more [[apologetics|apologetic]] in tone, as it was written to explain and defend the Christian doctrine against unbelievers, with arguments adapted to fit the intended circumstances of its use, each article refuting a certain [[heresy|heretical]] belief or proposition. 
Instead of a mere elucidation of the length and breadth of Christian doctrine, Aquinas explains specific core articles of Christian belief.&lt;ref name="GilsonC"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilson|first=Etienne|title=The Christian Philosophy of Saint Thomas Aquinas|year=1994|publisher=University of Notre Dame Press|location=Notre Dame, IN|isbn=978-0-268-00801-7|pages=502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Date and composition==
The work was written over a period of several years, between 1259 and 1265.

In the spring of 1256 Thomas was appointed regent master in theology at Paris and one of his first works upon assuming this office was ''Contra impugnantes Dei cultum et religionem'', defending the [[mendicant order]]s, which had come under attack by [[William of Saint-Amour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = On Evil | author=Aquinas, Thomas |author2=Richard J. Regan |author3=Brian Davies  | publisher=Oxford University Press US | year = 2003 | page = 5 | isbn = 0-19-509183-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
During his tenure from 1256 to 1259, Thomas wrote numerous works, and he was working on  ''Summa contra Gentiles'' by the time he left Paris.&lt;ref name="davies4"&gt;Davies, ''Aquinas: An Introduction'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
From Aquinas' autograph, Torrell (1996) identified the first 53 chapters of Book I as having been written in Paris  based on studies of the parchment and the ink used.&lt;ref name="Torrell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Torrell|first=Jean-Pierre|title=St. Thomas Aquinas: The Person and His Work, vol. 1|year=1996|publisher=Catholic University of America Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0-268-00801-7|pages=407502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a tradition that can be traced to shortly after Thomas' death,  the ''Summa contra Gentiles''  was written in response to a request, made in 1259, for a book that would help the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] missionaries in Spain to convert the Muslims and Jews there.
The request was made by  [[Raymond of Peñafort]], a  Dominican friar and advisor to [[James I of Aragon]].&lt;ref&gt;John Y.B. Hood, ''Aquinas and the Jews'' (1995), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bXbE38tcNHAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=aquinas+and+the+jews&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJxte51t7NAhXDDMAKHeGYBHAQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 37].&lt;/ref&gt; Raymond had been active in the  Christian defense against the [[Moors]] (Muslims) and [[Jews in Spain|Jews]] in the [[kingdom of Aragon]] since the 1240s. To this end, Raymond  instituted the teaching of Arabic and Hebrew in several houses of the friars, and he also founded priories in [[Murcia]] (then still under Muslim rule) and in [[Tunis]]. Additionally he went to help establish the Church in the recently conquered island of [[Mallorca]].  Raymond's request to Thomas was transmitted  by fellow Dominican [[Ramón Martí]], one of eight friars appointed to make a study of oriental languages with the purpose of carrying on a mission to Jews and Moors.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Bonner, ''Doctor illuminatus'', Princeton University Press (1993),  [https://books.google.com/books?id=Oy5rp848WZkC&amp;pg=PA76#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 78]&lt;/ref&gt;
The historicity of this account has been questioned in modern scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Davies, ''Thomas Aquinas's Summa Contra Gentiles: A Guide and Commentary'',  Oxford University Press, (2016),  [https://books.google.com/books?id=B009DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8 8&amp;nsah;10].&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments adduced include the lack of an explicit dedication to Raymond, the evidence that substantial portions of book 1 were complete by mid-1259 (suggesting that Thomas started work on the book as early as 1257), and the suggestion that the work makes no effort to address tenets of Islam specifically.&lt;ref&gt;"Aquinas only mentions Islam nine times in the entire work, and only a brief paragraph (1.6) says anything remotely substantive about the religion."  T. E. Burman in: ''Nicholas of Cusa and Islam: Polemic and Dialogue in the Late Middle Ages
Studies in Medieval and Reformation Traditions'' (Ian Christopher Levy, Rita George-Tvrtković, Donald Duclow eds.), BRILL (2014), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nk73AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR15  p. xv].&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1259, Thomas left Paris and returned to Naples, where he was appointed as general preacher by the provincial chapter of 29 September 1260. In September 1261 he was called to [[Orvieto]] as conventual lector responsible for the pastoral formation of the friars unable to attend a ''[[studium generale]]''.
It was in Orvieto that Thomas completed ''Summa contra Gentiles'', which was followed by the  ''Catena aurea'',&lt;ref name="healy4"&gt;Healy, ''Theologian'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and minor works produced for [[Pope Urban IV]] such as the liturgy for the newly created [[feast of Corpus Christi]] and the ''[[Contra Errores Graecorum|Contra errores graecorum]]''.&lt;ref name="davies4"/&gt;

Parts of the text have survived in Aquinas'  [[autograph]], kept in the [[Vatican Library]] as  Lat. 9850. The manuscript includes fragments of books one and two, and large portions of book three.

==Contents==
The ''Summa contra Gentiles'' consists of four books.
The structure of Thomas' work is  designed to proceed from general philosophical arguments for [[monotheism]], to which Muslims and Jews are likely to consent even within their own respective religious traditions, before progressing to the discussion of specifically Christian doctrine.

Books I–III cover truths that naturally are accessible to the human intellect while book IV   covers  [[Revelation|revealed]]  
truths for which natural reason is inadequate.

The conventional title is taken from chapter I.2, where Thomas states his intention as the work's author:
"I have set myself the task of making known, as far as my limited powers will allow, the truth that the Catholic faith professes, and of setting aside the errors that are opposed to it. To use the words of [[Hilary of Poitiers|Hilary]]: 'I am aware that I owe this to God as the chief duty of my life, that my every word and sense may speak of Him' [''De Trinitate'' I, 37]."&lt;ref&gt;trans. Pegis (1955)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book begins with general questions of [[truth]] and [[natural reason]], and from chapter 10 investigates the  concept of [[God|monotheistic God]], chapters 10 to 13 concerned with the [[existence of God]], followed by a detailed investigation of God's properties (chapters 14 to 102).

The second book is dedicated to the Creation (viz. the [[Universe|physical universe]], everything which exists).

The third book discusses [[Divine providence|providence]] and the [[human condition]], i.e. [[good and evil]] acts, human [[fate]] and [[intellect]] and the relation of created beings to the creator.

The fourth book is dedicated to discussing points of Christian doctrine which separate [[Nicaean Christianity]] from the other monotheistic religions, i.e. the doctrines of the [[Trinity]], the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]], the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Sacraments]] and the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]].

In the mid-1650s Ciantes wrote a "monumental bilingual edition of the first three Parts of Thomas Aquinas’ ''Summa contra Gentiles'', which includes the original Latin text and a Hebrew translation prepared by Ciantes, assisted by Jewish converts, the ''Summa divi Thomae Aquinatis ordinis praedicatorum Contra Gentiles quam Hebraicè eloquitur…''.

The [[Genealogy (philosophy)|genealogy]], according to netism, has three steps: 1. the [[Being]] tendential of itself, which is the [[universe]], 2. the being tendential of himself that is the human being in his first step of [[existence]], and 3. the being detendential of himself that is the human being in his second step of existence, who reduces continuously the tendencies of repetition in his life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archipel.uqam.ca/8673/1/M14280.pdf Taraneh Javanbakht's work on the website of the library of the Université du Québec à Montréal, p. 91-92, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her theory in [[cognitive science]], the demarcator theory, is in opposition with the [[prototype theory]] and [[exemplar theory]]. The demarcator theory was published by the [[Université du Québec à Montréal]] in 2016. This theory, in difference with these two mentioned theories, explains why, when and how human beings distinguish or confound the categories of [[concept]]s. She formalized this theory by the combination of [[non-classical logic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archipel.uqam.ca/8673/1/M14280.pdf Taraneh Javanbakht's work on the website of the library of the Université du Québec à Montréal, p. 34-40, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

She introduced and developed the tendential logic, a new [[logic]] with applications in sciences, philosophy, literature, arts and [[social movement]]s. The tendential logic and its applications were published by the Université du Québec à Montréal in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archipel.uqam.ca/8673/1/M14280.pdf Website of the library of the Université du Québec à Montréal, p. 117-123, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; Her works on different models showed that the combination of the tendential logic with the other [[non-classical logic]]s, such as [[fuzzy logic]] and [[modal logic]], is appropriate to model the human [[cognitive disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archipel.uqam.ca/8673/1/M14280.pdf Website of the library of the Université du Québec à Montréal, p. 112-122, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outlooks ==
Some of the outlooks of Taraneh Javanbakht are as follows:
*The persons who are interested in the life of ancient polymaths, devote their life to learn and innovate in sciences, arts, and the transfer of their knowledge to the Iranians and the other nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.gooya.com/politics/archives/2010/03/102134.php Gooyanews website, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Polymathy]] is a necessity. Women's polymathy can change the men's mentality and prevent the [[masculism]] in the societies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.gooya.com/society/archives/050816.php Gooyanews website, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The human rights activity is not the ordinary but the canonical duty of thinkers and artists and they should take it into their consideration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.gooya.com/politics/archives/2014/08/184645.php Gooyanews website, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Science, philosophy, literature and art do not have any value if the ones who are active in these fields keep silence about the executions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.gooya.com/politics/archives/2016/03/209463.php Gooyanews website, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Being involved in sciences or various arts is not a reason for neglecting the causes of social problems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120731110539/http://www.chrr.biz/spip.php?article14941 Committee of human rights reporters, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Every [[knowledge]] in which the reason is involved is not a [[rationality|rational knowledge]]. It means that any knowledge because the reason is involved in it cannot be considered as a rational knowledge. In a rational knowledge, it is necessary that in addition to the existence of reason, the judgment of reason about the thing that is to be known should be consistent with the reason and be rational. It is also necessary that the result of this knowledge be rational so that we consider that knowledge a rational knowledge (the necessary and sufficient conditions for rational knowledge).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cgie.org.ir/fa/news/154958 Netism, Taraneh Javanbakht's article on the Center for the Great Islamic Encyclopedia website, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Roots of Reference''''' is a 1974 book by [[philosopher]] [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], in which the author expands on his earlier concepts about the [[inscrutability of reference]] and examines problems with traditional [[empiricism]], arguing for a [[naturalized epistemology]] based on [[holism]].&lt;ref name="craig"&gt;Craig, Edward (Ed.) )1998). ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Vol. 10.'' Taylor &amp; Francis US {{ISBN|978-0-415-18715-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Quine's draft was initially developed in 1970 as an expansion of ideas presented in ''[[Word and Object]]'' (1960) about [[language acquisition]].&lt;ref name="quine1973"&gt;Quine, W.V. (1973). ''The Roots of Reference.'' The Paul Carus Lectures. Open Court, {{ISBN|0-87548-123-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
The book is divided into three sections, one for each of the three [[Paul Carus Lectures]] he originally gave in 1971 at the [[American Philosophical Association]] conference. These three lectures were then revised and expanded for the book, with an introduction by [[Nelson Goodman]]. 

The first section is "Perceiving and learning," and it summarizes the [[psychology]] of [[perception]] and [[learning]]. The second is "Breaking into language," and it concerns [[Concretization|reification]], which moves from rudimentary to full-fledged through the use of the [[relative clause]] with its [[relative pronoun]] and [[subsidiary pronouns]]. These [[pronouns]] then recur as the bound variables of quantifications. The third section, "Referring to objects," examines [[properties]], [[Class (mathematics)|classes]] and [[number]]s. He concludes that it is a [[genetic fallacy]] to claim that [[truth]] cannot emerge from [[fallacious]] [[Formal proof|proofs]].

Quine is interested in explaining the "[[psychogenesis]] of reference," constructing how [[sensory perception]] moves from the ability to describe [[Physical body|concrete objects]] to [[abstract objects]] through a series of increasingly complex ways of referring to things. Following sensory reception of input from the physical world, someone acquiring language must learn to form "[[observation sentence]]s, talk of bodies, [[compound sentences]], [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifiers]], [[number]]s until the imagined person has a scheme not much less sophisticated than our own."&lt;ref name="peacocke"&gt;Peacocke, Christopher (2000). With References to the Roots. In Føllesdal, Dagfinn (Ed.) ''Philosophy of Quine: General, reviews, and analytic'' Taylor &amp; Francis, {{ISBN|978-0-8153-3737-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to author Gary Kemp, Quine "refines the claims and tasks of [[epistemology]] so as to make good on the basic claim that all knowledge derives from experience."&lt;ref name="kemp"&gt;Kemp, Gary (2006). ''Quine: a guide for the perplexed .''Continuum International Publishing Group, {{ISBN|978-0-8264-8486-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because it was created for the [[Carus Lectures]], Quine states his [[ontological]] position in a "delightfully relaxed, good-humored style."&lt;ref name="lee1974"&gt;Lee, Harold N. (1974). The Roots of Reference by W. V. Quine (review) ''The Southern Journal of Philosophy.'' Volume 12, Issue 3, pages 391–396, Fall 1974 {{doi|10.1111/j.2041-6962.1974.tb01187.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Secret''''' is a 2006 film&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrohdKlFfkE |title="The Secret Banned Edition" Creative Commons License |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2013-08-13 |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  consisting of a series of interviews designed to demonstrate the [[New Thought]] claim that everything one wants or needs can be satisfied by believing in an outcome, repeatedly thinking about it, and maintaining positive emotional states to "attract" the desired outcome.

The film and the subsequent publication of the [[The Secret (book)|book of the same name]] attracted interest from media figures such as [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Ellen DeGeneres]], and [[Larry King]]. It has also received a great deal of controversy and criticism for its claims, and has been parodied in TV shows.

As described in the film, the "Law of Attraction" hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;American Heritage Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; posits that feelings and thoughts can attract events, feelings, and experiences, from the workings of the cosmos to interactions among individuals in their physical, emotional, and professional affairs. The film also suggests that there has been a strong tendency by those in positions of power to keep this central principle hidden from the public.

== Teachers of the law of attraction ==
The film includes interviews with individuals who describe themselves as professionals and authors in the fields of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum physics]], [[psychology]], [[metaphysics]], coaching, [[theology]], [[philosophy]], [[finance]], [[feng shui]], [[medicine]], and [[personal development]], who are called "secret teachers". Some of them, on their Web sites, promote the film and their connection to it. A few of the persons' brief appearances do not speak of the "law of attraction" in their interviews, so their support of the concepts is assumed by viewers.

People who focus on the law of attraction who are interviewed in the film and have later been featured on prominent American TV shows are John Assaraf,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thelawofattraction.com/people/john-assaraf/|title=John Assaraf Neurogym Review &amp; Brain-A-Thon Host|work=The Law Of Attraction|access-date=2017-09-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Beckwith]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thelawofattraction.com/people/michael-bernard-beckwith/|title=Michael Beckwith - The Law Of Attraction|work=The Law Of Attraction|access-date=2017-09-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Demartini,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thelawofattraction.com/people/dr-john-demartini/|title=Dr. John DeMartini - The Law Of Attraction|work=The Law Of Attraction|access-date=2017-09-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bob Proctor,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thelawofattraction.com/people/bob-proctor/|title=Bob Proctor - The Law Of Attraction|work=The Law Of Attraction|access-date=2017-09-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Canfield]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thelawofattraction.com/people/jack-canfield/|title=Jack Canfield: Success Principles Review|work=The Law Of Attraction|access-date=2017-09-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Arthur Ray]], [[Joseph Vitale (author)|Joseph Vitale]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thelawofattraction.com/people/joe-vitale/|title=Joe Vitale - Law Of Attraction Practitioner Certification Review|work=The Law Of Attraction|access-date=2017-09-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lisa Nichols, Marie Diamond, and [[John Gray (U.S. author)|John Gray]].

== Historical foundations in New Thought ideas ==
The authors of ''The Secret'' cite the [[New Thought]] movement which began in the late 18th century as the historical basis for their ideas.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news

The New Thought book ''[[The Science of Getting Rich]]'' by [[Wallace Wattles]], the source Rhonda Byrne cites as inspiration for the film, was preceded by numerous other New Thought books, including the 1906 book ''Thought Vibration or the law of attraction in the Thought World'' by [[William Walker Atkinson]],&lt;ref name="thought_vibration"&gt;{{cite book| last = Atkinson| first = William Walker| title = Thought Vibration or the Law of Attraction in the Thought World| year = 1906| publisher = Cornerstone| isbn = 978-1-56459-660-4}} (Out of copyright, [http://website.lineone.net/~cornerstone2/tvib.htm published on the Internet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070605113713/http://website.lineone.net/~cornerstone2/tvib.htm#6 |date=2007-06-05 }})&lt;/ref&gt; editor of ''New Thought magazine''. Other New Thought books Byrne is purported to have read include self-help authors like Prentice Mulford's 19th-century'' Thoughts Are Things;'' and Robert Collier's ''Secret of the Ages'' from 1926.&lt;ref name="new_york_times" /&gt;

=== Portrayal of ideas preceding the New Thought movement ===
''The Secret'' website cites the [[Emerald Tablet]], said to be written by [[Hermes Trismegistus]] (purportedly a "secret teacher"), as... one of the most important historical documents known to mankind".&lt;ref name="past_teachers"&gt;{{cite web| title = The secret teachers| publisher = TS Production LLC| year = 2006| url = http://www.thesecret.tv/pastteachers.html| accessdate = 2007-06-06| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070616091747/http://thesecret.tv/pastteachers.html| archivedate = 2007-06-16| df = }} — page at official website of ''The Secret'' film.&lt;/ref&gt; Byrne posits that the earliest trace of "the secret" occurred in the Emerald Tablet,&lt;ref name="QPIX_news"&gt;{{cite news

Carolyn Sackariason of the ''[[Aspen Times]]'', when commenting about Byrne's intention to share ''The Secret'' with the world, identifies the Rosicrucians as keepers of ''The Secret''.&lt;ref name="aspen_times"&gt;{{cite news| last = Sackariason| first = Carolyn| title = ''The big 'Secret' is finally out''| date = 2007-02-06| url = http://www.aspentimes.com/article/20070206/COLUMN/102060041&amp;SearchID=73282611489273| accessdate = 2007-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the words "Emerald Tablet" nor "Rosicrucian" are spoken in the film, however, at key transition points the screen image rapidly zooms in on the word "Rosicrucian".&lt;ref name="Illuminati" /&gt;

Betsy Chasse, one of the producers, directors, and screenwriters for ''[[What the Bleep Do We Know!?]]'' interviewed Paul Harrington, the co-producer of ''The Secret.'' In the interview, Harrington gave this description of Byrne's production methods: "We used the law of attraction during the making of the program. We went very unconventional, in terms of scheduling and budgeting. We allowed things to come to us... We just had faith that things would come to us."&lt;ref name="bleeping_herald" /&gt;

Channel Nine, after viewing the completed film, chose to not broadcast it. A new contract was negotiated with all DVD sales going to Byrne's companies (Prime Time and The Secret LLC). In hindsight, Len Downs of Channel Nine commented, "we looked at it and we didn't deem it as having broad, mass appeal". The film was eventually broadcast by Channel Nine at 10:30 pm on Saturday, 3 February 2007.&lt;ref name="the_age" /&gt; Downs reported that "it didn't do all that well".&lt;ref name="newsweek" /&gt; The film was sold on DVD and also broadcast online through [[streaming media]].

Choosing to package the film's theme as a "secret" has been called an important component of the film's popularity. Donavin Bennes, a buyer who specializes in [[metaphysics]] for [[Borders Group|Borders Books]], stated "We all want to be in on a secret. But to present it as ''the'' secret, that was brilliant." ''&lt;ref name="newsweek" /&gt;''

=== Marketing campaign ===
The movie was advertised on the Internet using "tease" advertising and [[viral marketing]]; techniques in which the specific details of ''The Secret'' were not revealed. Additionally, Prime Time Productions granted written permission to individuals or companies, via application at the official site, to provide free screenings of the film to public audiences. Optionally, the DVD may be sold at these screenings.

Julie Mason, of the ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', wrote that word of mouth about the film spread through [[Pilates]] classes, "get-rich-quick websites" and personal-motivation blogs.&lt;ref name="ottawa_citizen"&gt;{{cite news| last = Mason| first = Julie| title = ''The secrets of the secret''| newspaper = Ottawa Citizen| date = 2007-02-04| url = http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/citizensweekly/story.html?id=59f86670-db12-4731-a656-1fc0d43a950d| accessdate = 2007-05-10| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011202922/http://canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/citizensweekly/story.html?id=59f86670-db12-4731-a656-1fc0d43a950d| archivedate = 2007-10-11| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jane Lampman, of the ''[[The Christian Science Monitor|Christian Science Monitor]]'', described ''The Secret'' as a brand promoting ''Secret''-related teachers, seminars  and retreats.&lt;ref name="monitor" /&gt; According to Jill Culora, of the ''[[New York Post]]'', fans of ''The Secret'' have posted on a wide range of blogs and Web forums accounts of how shifting from negative to positive thoughts made big improvements in their lives.&lt;ref name="new_york_post"&gt;{{cite news|last=Culora |first=Jill |title=''A 'secret' Oprah Craze Hits New Yorkers'' |newspaper=New York Post |date=2007-03-04 |url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/03042007/news/regionalnews/a_secret_oprah_craze_hits_new_yorkers_regionalnews_jill_culora.htm?page=0 |accessdate=2007-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929170308/http://www.nypost.com/seven/03042007/news/regionalnews/a_secret_oprah_craze_hits_new_yorkers_regionalnews_jill_culora.htm?page=0 |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerry Adler of Newsweek called it "breathless pizzazz" for a tired self-help genre;&lt;ref name="newsweek" /&gt; "emphatically cinematic" and "driven by images and emotions rather than logic";&lt;ref name="reason_mag"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/119132.html|title=''The Secret of'' The Secret|last=Beato|first=Greg|date=2007-04-01|accessdate=2007-05-01|publisher=Reason Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; a blend of [[Tony Robbins]] and ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'';&lt;ref name="la_times" /&gt; and "the ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'' of [[infomercial]]s".&lt;ref name="reason_mag" /&gt;

In 2007, ''The Secret'' was reportedly being discussed in "e-mails, in chat rooms, around office cubicles, [and] on blind dates".&lt;ref name="new_york_post" /&gt; It is recognized as having a broad and varied impact on culture.&lt;ref name="new_york_post" /&gt;

American TV host [[Oprah Winfrey]] is a proponent of the film and later the book. On [[The Larry King Show]] she said that the message of ''The Secret'' is the message she's been trying to share with the world on her show for the past 21 years.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zm3-exDWIg&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Rhonda Byrne]] was later invited to her show along people who vow by ''The Secret''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oprah.com/spirit/_75&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics were bothered by the film's focus on questionable wealth enhancement, including promises that the universe will give you material goods "like having the universe as your catalog."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1573136,00.html|title=The Secret of Success|date=28 December 2006|author=Jeffrey Ressner|work=[[TIME (magazine)|TIME]]|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a March 2007 issue of ''Skeptical Inquirer'', the central idea of the film "has [no] basis in scientific reality", despite invoking scientific concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/secrets_and_lies/|title=Secrets and Lies|work=csicop.org|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within businesses using the DVD for employee-training and morale-building, author [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] called it "a gimmick" and "disturbing", like "being indoctrinated into a cult".&lt;ref name=HuffEhren&gt;{{cite web | author=Ehrenreich, Barbara | authorlink=Barbara Ehrenreich | title=The Secret of Mass Delusion | work=[[The Huffington Post]] | date=27 February 2007 | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/barbara-ehrenreich/the-secret-of-mass-delusi_b_42212.html | accessdate=29 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] former champion [[Conor McGregor]] claims ''The Secret'' played a role in his rise to fame. McGregor has said his first reaction on watching the DVD version was: “This is bullshit — but then something clicked for me.” He and girlfriend Dee Devlin, who manages his finances, started focusing on small things they wanted, such as a parking space closest to the doors of a local shopping centre. He said: “We would be driving to the shop and  visualising the exact car park space. And then we’d be able to get it every time.” 
They  then began  visualizing wealth, fame and championships.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/mma/4080251/conor-mcgregors-amazing-journey-from-plumbers-apprentice-to-78m-fight-against-legend-floyd-mayweather/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://nypost.com/2017/07/26/conor-mcgregors-rise-from-failed-plumber-to-shocking-superstar/&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, ''[[The Australian]]'' reported that Drew Heriot (director) and Dan Hollings (Internet consultant for ''The Secret'') were in a legal dispute with Rhonda Byrne over pay from the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/the-secret-of-rhondas-success/story-e6frg8h6-1111117271174 |title=The secret of Rhonda's success |newspaper=The Australian |date=2012-09-28 |accessdate=2012-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Releases ==
Paul Harrington, the producer for the film, reported that broadcast TV—instead of the Internet—was initially planned as the medium for the first release:

{{quote|...we had as our vision to go out to the whole world in 24 hours on television. It was a grand vision, which we weren't able to pull off for various reasons. We were trying to force, to control the "how" of the universe, when what we were supposed to do was just focus on the vision...&lt;ref name="bleeping_herald" /&gt;}}

=== Release dates ===
''The Secret'' premiere was broadcast through the Internet on March 23, 2006 using [[Vividas]] technology. It is still available either on a pay-per-view basis via [[streaming media]] (or on DVD at the official site for the film).  A new extended edition of ''The Secret'' was released to the public on October 1, 2006. The Australian television premiere was on [[Nine Network]] on Saturday, February 3, 2007.&lt;ref name="the_age" /&gt;

'''Waldorf education''', also known as '''Steiner education''', is based on the [[educational philosophy]] of [[Rudolf Steiner]], the founder of [[Anthroposophy]]. Its [[pedagogy]] strives to develop pupils' intellectual, artistic, and practical skills in an integrated and [[Holistic education|holistic]] manner. The cultivation of pupils' imagination and creativity is a central focus. 

Individual teachers and schools have a great deal of autonomy in determining curriculum content, teaching methodology, and governance. [[Formative assessments|Qualitative assessments]] of student work are integrated into the daily life of the classroom, with [[summative assessments|quantitative testing]] playing a minimal role and [[standardized testing]] usually limited to what is required to enter [[higher education|post-secondary education]]. 

The first Waldorf school opened in 1919 in [[Stuttgart]], Germany. A century later, it has become the largest independent school movement in the world,&lt;ref name="Zdrazil2018"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zdrazil |first1=Tomas |title=Lehrerbildung in der Waldorfschule|chapter=Theorie-Praxis Verhältnis in der Waldorfpädagogik |editor1-last=Kern |editor1-first=Holger|editor2-last=Zdrazil |editor2-first=Tomas |editor3-last= Götte|editor3-first=Wenzel Michael|date=2018 |publisher=Juventa |location=Weinheim, DE |isbn=9783779938293 |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; with about 1,150 independent Waldorf schools,&lt;ref name=schulliste/&gt; about 1,800 kindergartens&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt; and 646 centers for [[special education]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freunde-waldorf.de/en/waldorf-worldwide/waldorf-education/waldorf-world-list.html|title=Website der Freunde der Erziehungskunst Rudolf Steiners e.V.|website=www.freunde-waldorf.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; located in 75 countries.

The first school based upon Steiner's ideas was opened in 1919 in response to a request by [[Emil Molt]], the owner and managing director of the [[Waldorf-Astoria-Zigarettenfabrik|Waldorf-Astoria Cigarette Company]] in [[Stuttgart]], Germany, to serve the children of employees of the factory.&lt;ref name=Uhr/&gt;{{rp|381}} This is the source of the name ''Waldorf,'' which is now trademarked in some countries in association with the method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://waldorfeducation.org/awsna/registered_trademarks|title=Waldorf Education Trademarks - Association of Waldorf Schools of North America|website=waldorfeducation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;The co-educational school soon forayed beyond the company, admitting children from a diverse social spectrum and growing rapidly to became the first [[comprehensive school]] in Germany&lt;ref name="Hemleben"&gt;Johannes Hemleben, ''Rudolf Steiner: A documentary biography'', Henry Goulden Ltd, {{ISBN|0-904822-02-8}}, pp. 121–126 (German edition Rowohlt Taschenbuch Verlag {{ISBN|3-499-50079-5}}).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Basiswissen Pädagogik.

Waldorf education became more widely known in Britain in 1922 through lectures Steiner gave on education at a conference at [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;Paull, John (2011) [http://orgprints.org/18835/1/Paull2011OxfordEJES.pdf Rudolf Steiner and the Oxford Conference: The Birth of Waldorf Education in Britain]. European Journal of Educational Studies, 3(1): 53–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, on his final trip to Britain at [[Torquay]] in 1924, Steiner delivered a Waldorf teacher training course.&lt;ref name=Torquay&gt;Paull, John (2018) [https://www.academia.edu/36404489/Torquay_In_the_Footsteps_of_Rudolf_Steiner Torquay: In the Footsteps of Rudolf Steiner], Journal of Biodynamics Tasmania. 125 (Mar): 26–31.&lt;/ref&gt; The first school in England, now [[Michael Hall (school)|Michael Hall school]], was founded in 1925; the first in the USA, the Rudolf Steiner School in New York City, in 1928. By the 1930s, numerous schools inspired by the original school and/or Steiner's pedagogical principles had opened in Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Norway, Austria, Hungary, the USA, and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Friends of Waldorf education, [http://www.freunde-waldorf.de/en/the-friends/publications/waldorf-education-worldwide/teil-1/waldorf-education-expansion-in-the-twentieth-century.html Waldorf schools' Expansion]&lt;/ref&gt;

Political interference from the [[Nazi]] regime limited and ultimately closed most Waldorf schools in Europe, with the exception of the British, Swiss, and some Dutch schools. The affected schools were reopened after the [[Second World War]],&lt;ref name="Uncommon"&gt;{{cite journal|first=P. Bruce|last=Uhrmacher|year=1995|title=Uncommon Schooling: A Historical Look at Rudolf Steiner, Anthroposophy, and Waldorf Education|journal=Curriculum Inquiry|volume=25|issue=4|pages=381|jstor=1180016|doi=10.2307/1180016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A few schools elsewhere in Europe, e.g. in Norway, survived by going underground. [http://www.freunde-waldorf.de/en/the-friends/publications/waldorf-education-worldwide/teil-2/norway.html History of the Norwegian schools]&lt;/ref&gt; though those in Soviet-dominated areas were closed again a few years later by [[Communism|Communist]] regimes.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Waldorf schools in East Germany were closed by the DDR educational authorities, who justified this as follows: the pedagogy was based on the needs of children, rather than on the needs of society, was too pacifistic, and had failed to structure itself according to pure Marxist-Leninist principles.[http://www.waldorfschule-dresden.de.srv1.bk-provider.de/Historie.14.0.html "Die Geschichte der Dresdner Waldorfschule"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In North America, the number of Waldorf schools increased from nine in the US&lt;ref&gt;The schools founded by 1967 were: [[Detroit Waldorf School]], Green Meadow Waldorf School, High Mowing School, Highland Hall Waldorf School, Honolulu Waldorf School, Kimberton Waldorf School, Rudolf Steiner School of New York City, Sacramento Waldorf School, Waldorf School of Garden City.[http://www.whywaldorfworks.org/05_FindASchool/ AWSNA list of schools with dates of founding] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130321223002/http://www.whywaldorfworks.org/05_FindASchool/ |date=21 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and one in Canada&lt;ref&gt;Founded in 1968, Toronto Waldorf School was the first Waldorf school in Canada.[http://www.torontowaldorfschool.com/about_TWS/TWS_history/index.php History of the Toronto Waldorf School] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015055121/http://www.torontowaldorfschool.com/about_TWS/TWS_history/index.php# |date=15 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1967 to around 200 in the US&lt;ref name=schulliste/&gt;&lt;ref name=charters/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; and over 20 in Canada&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waldorf.ca/index.cfm?PAGEPATH=&amp;ID=19487 Waldorf Schools in Canada | Waldorf ca] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104054423/http://www.waldorf.ca/index.cfm?PAGEPATH=&amp;ID=19487 |date=4 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; today.

After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Waldorf schools began to proliferate in [[Central and Eastern Europe]]. Most recently, many schools have opened in Asia, especially in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Connor|first=Neil|title=China Starts to Question Strict Schooling Methods|url=https://ph.news.yahoo.com/china-starts-strict-schooling-methods-044028999.html|accessdate=1 May 2013|newspaper=Agence France Press – AFP|date=12 March 2012|quote=In recent years, China has seen a major expansion of alternative teaching establishments such as those that operate under the educational principles of Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lin Qi and Guo Shuhan|title=Educating the Whole Child|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2011-06/23/content_12756319.htm|accessdate=1 May 2013|newspaper=China Daily|date=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently over 1,000 independent Waldorf schools worldwide.&lt;ref name=schulliste/&gt;

==Developmental approach==
The structure of Waldorf education follows Steiner's theory of [[child development]], which divides childhood into three developmental stages&lt;ref name=Uhr&gt;{{cite journal|last=Uhrmacher|first=P. Bruce|title=Uncommon Schooling: A Historical Look at Rudolf Steiner, Anthroposophy, and Waldorf Education|journal=Curriculum Inquiry|date=Winter 1995|volume=25|issue=4|pages=381–406|doi=10.2307/1180016|jstor=1180016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and describes learning strategies appropriate to each stage.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/education-28646118|title=Why are Steiner schools so controversial?|first=Chris|last=Cook|date=4 August 2014|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ph.D.2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Armstrong, PhD|title=The Best Schools: How Human Development Research Should Inform Educational Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bmsbReA56NIC&amp;pg=PA53|accessdate=29 November 2012|date=1 December 2006|publisher=ASCD|isbn=978-1-4166-0457-0|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stages, each of which lasts approximately seven years, are broadly similar to those later observed and described by [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]].&lt;ref name=Uhr/&gt;{{rp|402}}&lt;ref name="IHG"&gt;Iona H. Ginsburg, "Jean Piaget and Rudolf Steiner: Stages of Child Development and Implications for Pedagogy", ''Teachers College Record'' Volume 84 Number 2, 1982, pp. 327–337.&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner's educational ideas closely follow modern "common sense" educational theory, as this has developed since [[Comenius]] and [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi|Pestalozzi]].&lt;ref name="Ullrich"/&gt;

The stated purpose of this approach is to awaken the "physical, behavioral, emotional, cognitive, social, and spiritual" aspects of each individual,&lt;ref name=Woods&gt;{{cite book|last=Woods|first=Philip|title=Steiner Schools in England|year=2005|publisher=UK Department for Education and Skills|isbn=1 84478 495 9|author2=Martin Ashley |author3=Glenys Woods |url=http://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/RR645.pdf|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130401151715/http://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/RR645.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; fostering creative as well as analytic thinking.&lt;ref name=Woods/&gt;{{rp|28}} A 2005 review found that Waldorf schools successfully develop "creative, social and other capabilities important in the holistic growth of the person".&lt;ref name=Woods/&gt;{{rp|39}}

===Pre-school and kindergarten: to age 6/7===
Waldorf pedagogical theory considers that during the first years of life children learn best by being immersed in an environment they can learn from through un-selfconscious imitation of practical activities. The early childhood curriculum therefore centers on [[experiential education]], allowing children to learn by example, and opportunities for imaginative play.&lt;ref name="PBU"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ginsburg and Opper, ''Piaget's Theory of Intellectual Development'', {{ISBN|0-13-675140-7}}, pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TheAtlantic"&gt;Todd Oppenheimer, [https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/99sep/9909waldorf.htm ''Schooling the Imagination''], ''Atlantic Monthly'', September 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ParkerRees&gt;{{cite book|title=Meeting the Child in Steiner Kindergartens: An Exploration of the beliefs, values and practices|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-60392-8|page=57|author=Sue Waite|author2=Sarah Rees |editor=Rod Parker-Rees|quote=The first epoch (0–7 years), when the child is intensely sensitive to people and surroundings, is seen by Steiner educators as the empathic stage - where empathy means embracing the unconscious of another with one's own unconscious, to live into the experience of another. The kindergarten teacher purposefully employs her own empathic ability as she strives to be a role model worthy of imitation by the children, but she also creates a space and ethos conducive to imaginative play that actively develops children's capacity for empathy.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall goal of the curriculum is to "imbue the child with a sense that the world is good".&lt;ref name=UllrichRS&gt;{{cite book|last=Ullrich|first=Heiner|title=Rudolf Steiner|year=2008|publisher=Continuum International Pub. Group|location=London|isbn=9780826484192|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waldorf [[preschool]]s employ a regular daily routine that includes free play, artistic work (e.g. drawing, painting or modeling), [[circle time]] (songs, games, and stories), and practical tasks (e.g. cooking, cleaning, and gardening), with rhythmic variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taplin|first=Jill Tina|title=Theories and Approaches to Learning in the Early Years|year=2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|page=92|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eM4SQbEh7oMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=Steiner Waldorf Early Childhood Education: Offering a Curriculum for the 21st Century|editor=Linda Miller, Linda Pound|accessdate=29 April 2013|isbn=9781849205788}}&lt;/ref&gt; Periods of outdoor recess are also usually included.&lt;ref name=UllrichRS/&gt;{{rp|125}} The classroom is intended to resemble a home, with tools and toys usually sourced from simple, natural materials that lend themselves to imaginative play.&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edwards|first1=Carolyn Pope|title=Three Approaches from Europe: Waldorf, Montessori, and Reggio Emilia|journal=Early Childhood Research &amp; Practice|date=Spring 2002|volume=4|issue=1|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=famconfacpub}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of natural materials has been widely praised as fulfilling children's aesthetic needs, encouraging their imagination, and reinforcing their identification with nature,&lt;ref name="Edwards"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hutchison|first1=David C.|title=A Natural History of Place in Education|date=2004|publisher=Teachers College Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=0807744700|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nicol|first1=Janni|last2=Taplin| first2=Jill|title=Understanding the Steiner Waldorf Approach: Early Years Education in Practice|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415597166|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ann Gordon and Kathryn Browne, ''Beginnings &amp; Beyond: Foundations in Early Childhood Education''.&lt;/ref&gt; though one pair of reviewers questioned whether the preference for natural, non-manufactured materials is "a reaction against the dehumanizing aspects of nineteenth-century industrialization" rather than a "reasoned assessment of twenty-first century children's needs".&lt;ref name="Siraj-BlatchfordWhitebread2003"/&gt;

Pre-school and kindergarten programs generally include seasonal festivals drawn from a variety of traditions, with attention placed on the traditions brought forth from the community.&lt;ref&gt;Henk van Oort (2011), "Religious education", ''Anthroposophy A-Z: A Glossary of Terms Relating to Rudolf Steiner's spiritual philosophy'' {{ISBN|9781855842649}}. p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Waldorf schools in the [[Western Hemisphere]] have traditionally celebrated Christian festivals,&lt;ref name="IO"&gt;Ida Oberman, [http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/detail?accno=ED409108 "Waldorf History: Case Study of Institutional Memory"], Paper presented to Annual Meeting of the American Education Research Association, 24–28 March 1997, published US Department of Education – Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC).&lt;/ref&gt; though many North American schools also include Jewish festivals.&lt;ref&gt;Willis, Peter and Neville, Bernie, Eds. (1996) ''Qualitative Research Practice in Adult Education''. University of South Australia, Centre for Research in Education Equity and Work {{ISBN|1-86355-056-9}}. p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Waldorf kindergarten and lower grades generally discourage pupils' use of electronic media such as television and computers.&lt;ref name=TheAtlantic/&gt; There are a variety of reasons for this: Waldorf educators believe that use of these conflicts with young children's developmental needs,&lt;ref name=woods_forum&gt;{{cite journal|last=Woods|first=Philip A.|author2=Glenys J.

Waldorf pedagogues consider that [[Learning to read#Age to introduce literacy learning|readiness for formal learning]] depends upon increased independence of character, temperament, habits, and memory, one of the markers of which is the loss of the baby teeth.&lt;ref name=Uhr/&gt;{{rp|389}}&lt;ref name="Ullrich"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gesell|first1=Arnold|last2=Ilg|first2=Frances|last3=Ames|first3=Louise|last4=Bullis|first4=Glenna|title=The child from five to ten|date=1946|publisher=Harper &amp; Bros|location=NY|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formal instruction in reading, writing, and other academic disciplines are therefore not introduced until students enter the elementary school, when pupils are around seven years of age.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/26/nyregion/different-teaching-method-attracts-parents.html "Different teaching method attracts parents"], ''The New York Times'', 26 March 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner believed that engaging young children in abstract intellectual activity too early would adversely affect their growth and development.&lt;ref name="Uhr"/&gt;{{rp|389}}

Waldorf elementary schools (ages 7–14) emphasize cultivating children's emotional life and imagination. In order that students can connect more deeply with the subject matter, academic instruction is presented through artistic work that includes story-telling, [[visual arts]], drama, movement, vocal and instrumental music, and crafts.&lt;ref name="Nielsen2004"&gt;Thomas William Nielsen, "Rudolf Steiner's Pedagogy of Imagination: A Phenomenological Case Study", Peter Lang Publisher 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CPE&gt;Carolyn P.

Elementary school educators' stated task is to present a role model children will naturally want to follow, gaining authority through fostering rapport and "nurturing curiosity, imagination, and creativity".&lt;ref&gt;Vivienne Walkup, ''Exploring Education Studies''.

Anthroposophic Press:1998. {{ISBN|9780863153969}}. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The declared goal of this second stage is to "imbue children with a sense that the world is beautiful".&lt;ref name=UllrichRS/&gt; There is little reliance on standardized textbooks.&lt;ref name="Ullrich"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ullrich | first1 = Heiner| title = Rudolf Steiner | doi = 10.1007/BF02195288 | journal = Prospects: the quarterly review of comparative education| volume = 24 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 555–572 | year = 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waldorf elementary education allows for individual variations in the pace of learning, based upon the expectation that a child will grasp a concept or achieve a skill when he or she is ready.&lt;ref name="Uncommon"/&gt; Cooperation takes priority over competition.&lt;ref name="McDermott_etal"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McDermott | first1 = R. | last2 = Henry | first2 = M. E. | last3 = Dillard | first3 = C. | last4 = Byers | first4 = P. | last5 = Easton | first5 = F. | last6 = Oberman | first6 = I. | last7 = Uhrmacher | first7 = B. | doi = 10.1007/BF02354381 | title = Waldorf education in an inner-city public school | journal = The Urban Review | volume = 28 | issue = 2 |page=119 | year = 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach also extends to physical education; competitive team sports are introduced in upper grades.&lt;ref name="TheAtlantic"/&gt;

Each class normally remains together as a [[cohort (educational group)|cohort]] throughout their years, developing as a quasi-familial social group whose members know each other quite deeply.&lt;ref name=Ashley/&gt; In the elementary years, a core teacher teaches the primary academic subjects. A central role of this class teacher is to provide supportive [[role model]]s both through personal example and through stories drawn from a variety of cultures,&lt;ref name=UllrichRS/&gt; educating by exercising creative, loving authority. Class teachers are normally expected to teach a group of children for several years,&lt;ref name=Frink&gt;Helen H. Frink, "Germany", in ''World Educational Encyclopedia'', Rebecca Marlow-Ferguson (ed.), v. 1. Gale 2002 {{ISBN|0-7876-5578-3}}. pp. 488–489.&lt;/ref&gt; a practice known as [[Looping (education)|looping]]. The traditional goal was for the teacher to remain with a class for the eight years of the "lower school" cycle, but in recent years the duration of these cycles has been increasingly treated flexibly. Already in first grade, specialized teachers teach many of the subjects, including music, crafts, movement, and two foreign languages from complementary language families&lt;ref name=Uhr/&gt; (in English-speaking countries often German and either Spanish or French); these subjects remain central to the curriculum throughout the elementary school years.

While class teachers serve a valuable role as personal mentors, establishing "lasting relationships with pupils",&lt;ref name=Frink/&gt; especially in the early years, Ullrich documented problems when the same class teacher continues into the [[middle school]] years. Noting that there is a danger of any [[authority figure]] limiting students enthusiasm for [[inquiry]] and assertion of [[autonomy]], he emphasized the need for teachers to encourage independent thought and explanatory discussion in these years, and cited approvingly a number of schools where the class teacher accompanies the class for six years, after which specialist teachers play a significantly greater role.&lt;ref name=UllrichRS/&gt;{{rp|222}}

====Four temperaments====

Steiner considered children's cognitive, emotional and behavioral development to be interlinked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ginsberg|first=Iona H.|title=Jean Piaget and Rudolf Steiner:stages of child development and implications for pedagogy|journal=Teachers College Record|year=1982|volume=84|issue=2|pages=327–337}}&lt;/ref&gt; When students in a Waldorf school are grouped, it is generally not by a singular focus on their academic abilities.&lt;ref name=Woods/&gt;{{rp|89}} Instead Steiner adapted the idea of the [[Ancient Greek medicine|classic]] [[four temperaments]] – melancholic, sanguine, phlegmatic and choleric – for pedagogical use in the elementary years.&lt;ref name="grant1999"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner indicated that teaching should be differentiated to accommodate the different needs that these psychophysical types&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite book|last=Ullrich|first=Heiner|title=Rudolf Steiner|year=2008|publisher=Continuum|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; represent. For example, "cholerics are risk takers, phlegmatics take things calmly, melancholics are sensitive or introverted, and sanguines take things lightly".&lt;ref name=Woods/&gt;{{rp|18}} Today Waldorf teachers may work with the notion of temperaments to differentiate their instruction. Seating arrangements and class activities may be planned taking into account the temperaments of the students&lt;ref name="Whedon2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sarah W. Whedon|title=Hands, Hearts, and Heads: Childhood and Esotericism in American Waldorf Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zC8rtOJjRp8C&amp;pg=PP1|accessdate=6 December 2012|year=2007|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-26917-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is often not readily apparent to observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woods|first=Philip A.|title=Steiner Schools in England|year=2005|publisher=UK Department for Education and Skills (DfES)|author2=Martin Ashley |author3=Glenys Woods |pages=89–90|quote=For example, melancholic children like sitting together because they are unlikely to be annoyed or disturbed by their neighbors. Livelier temperaments such as sanguine or choleric are said to be likely to rub their liveliness off on each other and calm down of their own accord. Little evidence of this aspect of practice was immediately apparent to outside observers, and teachers did not readily volunteer to talk about it.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner also believed that teachers must consider their own temperament and be prepared to work with it positively in the classroom,&lt;ref name=Stehlik /&gt; that temperament is emergent in children,&lt;ref name=Uncommon /&gt; and that most people express a combination of temperaments rather than a pure single type.&lt;ref name="grant1999"/&gt;

===Secondary education: ages 14 and up===
In most Waldorf schools, pupils enter secondary education when they are about fourteen years old. Secondary education is provided by specialist teachers for each subject. The education focuses much more strongly on academic subjects, though students normally continue to take courses in art, music, and crafts.&lt;ref name=UllrichRS/&gt; The curriculum is structured to foster pupils' intellectual understanding, independent judgment, and ethical ideals such as social responsibility, aiming to meet the developing capacity for abstract thought and conceptual judgment.&lt;ref name="PBU"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Uhrmacher|first1=P. Bruce|title=Making Contact: An Exploration of Focused Attention between Teacher and Students|journal=Curriculum Inquiry|date=Winter 1993|volume=23|issue=4|pages=433–444|doi=10.2307/1180068|jstor=1180068}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Edwards"/&gt;

In the third developmental stage (14 years old and up), children in Waldorf programs are supposed to learn through their own thinking and judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oberski|first=Iddo|title=Learning to Think in Steiner-Waldorf Schools|journal=Journal of Cognitive Education and Psychology|year=2006|volume=5|issue=3|url=http://www.ecswe.org/wren/documents/JCEP_Oberski_Steiner.pdf|accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students are asked to understand abstract material and expected to have sufficient foundation and maturity to form conclusions using their own judgment.&lt;ref name=Uhr/&gt;{{rp|391}}  The intention of the third stage is to "imbue children with a sense that the world is true".&lt;ref name=UllrichRS/&gt;

The overarching goals are to provide young people the basis on which to develop into [[Freedom (philosophy)|free]], [[morality|morally responsible]],&lt;ref name=Woods/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*"The overarching goal is to help children build a moral impulse within so they can choose in freedom what it means to live morally."—Armon, Joan, [http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/contentdelivery/servlet/ERICServlet?accno=ED420605 "The Waldorf Curriculum as a Framework for Moral Education: One Dimension of a Fourfold System"], ([http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED420605&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&amp;accno=ED420605 Abstract]), Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Educational Research Association (Chicago, IL, 24–28 March 1997), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and integrated individuals,&lt;ref name="Nielsen2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schneider"&gt;Peter Schneider, ''Einführung in die Waldorfpädogogik'', Klett-Cotta 1987, {{ISBN|3-608-93006-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald V.

==Educational theory and practice==

The philosophical foundation of the Waldorf approach, [[anthroposophy]], underpins its primary pedagogical goals: to provide an education that enables children to become free human beings, and to help children to incarnate their "unfolding spiritual identity", carried from the preceding spiritual existence, as beings of body, soul, and spirit in this lifetime.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Ron|title=Freedom in a holistic context|journal=Holistic Education Review|year=1995|volume=8|issue=3|pages=4–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educational researcher Martin Ashley suggests that the latter role would be problematic for secular teachers and parents in state schools,&lt;ref name=Ashley/&gt; and the commitment to a spiritual background both of the child and the education has been problematic for some committed to a secular perspective.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/26/nyregion/different-teaching-method-attracts-parents.html "Different teaching method attracts parents"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ashley/&gt;&lt;ref name=SF&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/education/article/Religion-or-Philosophy-Critics-say-Waldorf-3302817.php "Religion or philosophy"] SFGate 30 October 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

While anthroposophy underpins the curriculum design, pedagogical approach, and organizational structure, it is explicitly not taught within the school curriculum and studies have shown that Waldorf pupils have little awareness of it.&lt;ref name=Woods/&gt;{{rp|6}}&lt;!-- removed citations preserved here in case of reopening of debate over this&lt;ref name="PhillipsB"&gt;D.

Phillips, "Waldorf education: Rudolf Steiner", in ''Encyclopedia of Educational Theory and Philosophy'', SAGE 2014, p. 847-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Woods/&gt;{{rp|6}}&lt;ref name=Year6/&gt;&lt;ref name=oberski&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oberski|first=Iddo|title=Rudolf Steiner's philosophy of freedom as a basis for spiritual education?|journal=International Journal of Children's Spirituality|date=February 2011|volume=16|issue=1|page=14|doi=10.1080/1364436x.2010.540751}}&lt;/ref&gt;  --&gt; Tensions may arise within the Waldorf community between the commitment to Steiner's original intentions, which has sometimes acted as a valuable anchor against following educational fads, and openness to new directions in education, such as the incorporation of new technologies or modern methods of accountability and assessment.&lt;ref name=Ashley/&gt;

Waldorf schools frequently have striking architecture, employing walls meeting at varied angles (not only perpendicularly) to achieve a more fluid, less boxed-in feeling to the space. The walls are often painted in subtle colors, often with a lazure technique, and include textured surfaces.&lt;ref name=Krogh&gt;Suzanne L. Krogh, "Models of Early Childhood Education". In ''Encyclopedia of Education and Human Development'', Farenga and Ness (eds.). M. E. Sharpe 2005. {{ISBN|9780765621085}} p. 484.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessment===
The schools primarily assess students through reports on individual academic progress and personal development. The emphasis is on characterization through qualitative description. Pupils' progress is primarily evaluated through portfolio work in academic blocks and discussion of pupils in teacher conferences. Standardized tests are rare, with the exception of examinations necessary for college entry taken during the secondary school years.&lt;ref name=UllrichRS/&gt;{{rp|150,186}} [[Grade (education)|Letter grades]] are generally not given until students enter high school at 14–15 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=OECD|title=Formative Assessment Improving Learning in Secondary Classrooms: Improving Assessment in Secondary Classrooms|year=2005|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the educational emphasis is on children's holistic development, not solely their academic progress.&lt;ref name=UllrichRS/&gt; Pupils are not normally asked to repeat years of elementary or secondary education.

===Curriculum===
{{Details|Curriculum of the Waldorf schools}}
Though Waldorf schools are autonomous institutions not required to follow a prescribed curriculum (beyond those required by local governments) there are widely agreed upon guidelines for the Waldorf curriculum, supported by the schools' common principles.&lt;ref name=woods_forum/&gt; The schools offer a wide curriculum "governed by close observation and recording of what content motivates children at different ages" and including within it, for example, the English, Welsh and Northern Irish [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]].&lt;ref name=Year6&gt;Martin Ashley, [http://www.ecswe.org/wren/documents/Can_One_Teacher_Know.pdf "Can one teacher know enough to teach Year Six everything? Lessons from Steiner-Waldorf Pedagogy"], ''British Educational Research Association, Annual Conference, University of Glamorgan, 14th – 17th September''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main academic subjects are introduced through up to two-hour morning lesson blocks that last for several weeks.&lt;ref name=Woods/&gt;{{rp|18}}  These lesson blocks are horizontally integrated at each grade level in that the topic of the block will be infused into many of the activities of the classroom and vertically integrated in that each subject will be revisited over the course of the education with increasing complexity as students develop their skills, reasoning capacities and individual sense of self. This has been described as a spiral curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nicholson|first=David W.|title=Layers of experience: Forms of representation in a Waldorf school classroom|journal=Journal of Curriculum Studies|year=2000|volume=32|issue=4|pages=575–587|doi=10.1080/00220270050033637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many subjects and skills not considered core parts of mainstream schools, such as art, music, gardening, and mythology, are central to Waldorf education.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.waldorfanswers.org/WaldorfFAQ.htm#3 Waldorf Answers]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Students learn a variety of fine and practical arts. Elementary students paint, draw, sculpt, knit, weave, and crochet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Little|first=William|title=Steiner schools: learning – it is a wonder|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/4436941/Steiner-schools-learning-it-is-a-wonder.html|accessdate=20 May 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=3 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older students build on these experiences and learn new skills such as pattern-making and sewing, wood and stone carving, metal work, book-binding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ogeltree|first=Earl J.|title=Introduction to Waldorf Education: Curriculum and Methods|year=1979|publisher=University Press of America}}&lt;/ref&gt; and doll or puppet making. Fine art instruction includes form drawing, sketching, sculpting, perspective drawing and other techniques.

Music instruction begins with singing in early childhood and choral instruction remains an important component through the end of high school. Pupils usually learn to play [[Pentatonic scale|pentatonic]] flutes, [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorders]] and/or [[lyre]]s in the early elementary grades. Around age 9, [[diatonic]] recorders and orchestral instruments are introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Leone|first=Stacie|title=Ithaca Waldorf School: An education based in music, movement and neuroscience|url=http://www.ithaca.com/family_and_health/article_9b32bfb4-aea8-11e2-bfa0-001a4bcf887a.html|accessdate=29 April 2013|newspaper=The Ithaca Times|date=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain subjects are largely unique to the Waldorf schools. Foremost among these is [[eurythmy]], a movement art usually accompanying spoken texts or music which includes elements of drama and dance and is designed to provide individuals and classes with a "sense of integration and harmony".&lt;ref name="McDermott_etal"/&gt; Although found in other educational contexts, cooking,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Irving B.|title=Handbook of Psychology Vol. 7 Educational Psychology|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=241|author2=William Reynolds |author3=Gloria Miller }}&lt;/ref&gt; farming,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sumner|first=Jennifer|author2=Heather Mair |author3=Erin Nelson |title=Putting the culture back into agriculture: civic engagement and the celebration of local food|journal=International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability|year=2010|volume=1–2|issue=8|pages=54–61|doi=10.3763/ijas.2009.0454}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[environmental education|environmental]] and [[outdoor education]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Leyden|first=Liz|title=For Forest Kindergarteners, Class is Back to Nature, Rain or Shine|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/30/nyregion/30forest.html|accessdate=30 April 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=29 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; have long been incorporated into the Waldorf curriculum. Other differences include: non-competitive games and free play in the younger years as opposed to athletics instruction; instruction in two foreign languages from the beginning of elementary school; and an experiential-phenomenological approach to science&lt;ref name=SSE&gt;{{cite journal|last=Østergaard|first=Edvin|author2=Dahlin, Bo |author3=Hugo, Aksel |title=Doing phenomenology in science education: a research review|journal=Studies in Science Education|date=1 September 2008|volume=44|issue=2|pages=93–121|url=http://www.umb.no/statisk/larerutdanning/doing_phenomenology_in_science_education_a_research_review.pdf|doi=10.1080/03057260802264081}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereby students observe and depict scientific concepts in their own words and drawings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zubrowski|first=Bernard|title=Exploration and Meaning Making in the Learning of Science|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-481-2496-1|page=231|edition=Vol. 18|quote=[Pictoral representation] is also a way of focusing attention and closely observing what is happening. However, there are problems when it comes to having students draw. Some are inhibited because they feel they have to have very realistic representations.

In Waldorf education, there is an ongoing practice of having students draw. Others would do well to find ways of adapting this approach in public school practice so that drawing is second nature to the students and they are not inhibited in attempting it.}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than encountering the ideas first through a textbook.

The Waldorf curriculum has always incorporated [[multiple intelligences]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Armstrong, cited in Eric Oddleifson, [http://education.jhu.edu/PD/newhorizons/strategies/topics/Arts%20in%20Education/The%20Center%20for%20Arts%20in%20the%20Basic%20Curriculum/oddleifson3.htm Boston Public Schools As Arts-Integrated Learning Organizations: Developing a High Standard of Culture for All], :"Waldorf education embodies in a truly organic sense all of Howard Gardner's seven intelligences. Rudolph Steiner's vision is a whole one, not simply an amalgam of the seven intelligences. Many schools are currently attempting to construct curricula based on Gardner's model simply through an additive process (what can we add to what we have already got?). Steiner's approach, however, was to begin with a deep inner vision of the child and the child's needs and build a curriculum around that vision."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Science====

[[File:Geometric growth of Nautilus Shell.jpg|upright|thumb|Geometric growth of the nautilus shell – student work|right]]
The scientific methodology of modern Waldorf schools utilizes a so-called "phenomenological approach" to science education employing an exemplary methodology of [[inquiry-based learning]] aiming to "strengthen the interest and ability to observe" in pupils.&lt;ref name=PhenomScience/&gt;{{rp|111}} The main aim is to cultivate a sense of "wholeness" in regards to the human's place in nature.&lt;ref name=PhenomScience/&gt;{{rp|113}} Several empirical studies have noted how this method appears effective and even exemplary when evaluated against age-matched peers using the internationally recognized [[PISA]] test of 15-year-old students in mathematics and science.&lt;ref name=Woods/&gt;&lt;ref name=Welt2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=PISA2006&gt;{{cite book |authors=Claudia Schreiner and Ursula Schwantner |title=PISA 2006: Austrian Report with a Focus on the Sciences |year=2009 |chapter=Section 9.6 Comparison of Skills and Individual Characteristics of Waldorf Students |url=https://www.bifie.at/buch/815/9/6 |accessdate=9 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LuyNS9bX?url=https://www.bifie.at/buch/815/9/6 |archivedate=16 December 2013  }} {{link language|de}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other experts have called into question the quality of this phenomenological approach if it fails to educate Waldorf students on basic tenets of scientific fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scott |first1=Eugenie C. |title=Waldorf Schools Teach Odd Science, Odd Evolution |journal=National Center for Science Education Reports |date=Winter 1994 |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=20 |url=http://www.waldorfcritics.org/articles/Eugenie_Scott_94.html |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study conducted by [[California State University, Sacramento|California State University at Sacramento]] researches outlined numerous theories and ideas prevalent throughout Waldorf curricula that were patently [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] and steeped in [[magical thinking]]. These included the idea that animals evolved from humans, that human spirits are physically incarnated into "soul qualities that manifested themselves into various animal forms," that the current geological formations on Earth have evolved through so-called "Lemurian" and "Atlantiean" epochs, and that the four kingdoms of nature are "mineral, plant, animal, and man." All of these are directly contradicted by mainstream scientific knowledge and have no basis in any form of conventional scientific study. Contradictory notions found in Waldorf textbooks are distinct from factual inaccuracies occasionally found in modern public school textbooks, as the inaccuracies in the latter are of a specific and minute nature that results from the progress of science. The latter (those inaccuracies present in Waldorf textbooks), however, are the result of a mode of thinking that has no valid basis in reason or logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jelinek |first1=David |last2=Sun |first2=Li-Ling |title=Does Waldorf Offer a Viable Form of Science Education?

One study of the science curriculum compared a group of American Waldorf school students to American public school students on three different test variables.&lt;ref name=PhenomScience&gt;{{cite journal|last=Østergaard|first=Edvin|author2=Dahlin, Bo |author3=Hugo, Aksel |title=Doing phenomenology in science education: a research review|journal=Studies in Science Education|date=1 September 2008|volume=44|issue=2|pages=93–121|doi=10.1080/03057260802264081}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two tests measured verbal and non-verbal logical reasoning and the third was an international [[Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study|TIMSS]] test. The TIMSS test covered scientific understanding of [[magnetism]]. The researchers found that Waldorf school students scored higher than both the public school students and the national average on the TIMSS test while scoring the same as the public school students on the logical reasoning tests.&lt;ref name=PhenomScience/&gt; However, when the logical reasoning tests measured students' understanding of part-to-whole relations, the Waldorf students also outperformed the public school students.&lt;ref name=PhenomScience/&gt; The authors of the study noted the Waldorf students' enthusiasm for science, but viewed the science curriculum as "somewhat old-fashioned and out of date, as well as including some doubtful scientific material".&lt;ref name=PhenomScience/&gt; Educational researchers Phillip and Glenys Woods, who reviewed this study, criticized the authors' implication of an "unresolved conflict": that it is possible for supposedly inaccurate science to lead to demonstrably better scientific understanding.&lt;ref name=alt_woods&gt;{{cite book|last=Woods|first=Philip A.|title=Alternative Education for the 21st Century Philosophies, Approaches, Visions|year=2008|publisher=Palgrave|isbn=978-0-230-60276-2|author2=Glenys J.

In 2008, [[Stockholm University]] terminated its Waldorf teacher training courses. In a statement the university said "the courses did not encompass sufficient subject theory and a large part of the subject theory that is included is not founded on any scientific base". The dean, Stefan Nordlund, stated "the syllabus contains literature which conveys scientific inaccuracies that are worse than woolly; they are downright dangerous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thelocal.se/20080826/13944 | title=Stockholm University ends Steiner teacher training | newspaper=The Local | author=Peter Vinthagen Simpson |date = 29 August 2008 | quote = Stockholm University has decided to wind up its Steiner-Waldorf teacher training.

====Information technology====
Because they view human interaction as the essential basis for younger children's learning and growth,&lt;ref name=Ashley/&gt;{{rp|212}} Waldorf schools view [[computer science|computer technology]] as being first useful to children in the early teen years, after they have mastered "fundamental, time-honoured ways of discovering information and learning, such as practical experiments and books".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldscotland.com/reading-is-a-habit-that-we-can-t-afford-to-lose-1.830927 "Reading is a habit that we can't afford to lose"], The Herald, 2 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, Waldorf schools are granted an exemption by the [[Department for Education]] (DfE) from the requirement to teach [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] as part of [[Foundation Stage]] education (ages 3–5). Education researchers John Siraj-Blatchford and David Whitebread praised the [DfE] for making this exemption, highlighting Waldorf education's emphasis on simplicity of resources and the way the education cultivates the imagination.&lt;ref name="Siraj-BlatchfordWhitebread2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Siraj-Blatchford|author2=David Whitebread|title=Supporting ICT in the Early Years|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=usSnwA-nGgQC&amp;pg=PA16|accessdate=28 November 2012|date=1 October 2003|publisher=McGraw-Hill International|isbn=978-0-335-20942-2|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waldorf schools have been very popular with parents working in the technology sector, including those from some of the most advanced technology firms. In one Silicon Valley school, "three-quarters of the students have parents with a strong high-tech connection".&lt;ref name=Richtel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gardner/&gt; A number of technologically oriented parents from the school expressed their conviction that younger students do not need the exposure to computers and technology, but benefit from creative aspects of the education; one Google executive was quoted as saying "I fundamentally reject the notion you need technology aids in grammar school."&lt;ref name=Richtel&gt;Matt Richtel, [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/23/technology/at-waldorf-school-in-silicon-valley-technology-can-wait.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 "A Silicon Valley School That Doesn’t Compute"], ''The New York Times'', 22 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gardner&gt;David Gardner, [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2052977/The-Silicon-Valley-school-tech-honchos-send-kids-DONT-use-computers.html "The private school in Silicon Valley where tech honchos send their kids so they DON'T use computers"], ''Daily Mail'' 24 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spirituality===
Waldorf education aims to educate children about a wide range of religious traditions without favoring any one of these.&lt;ref name="McDermott_etal"/&gt; One of Steiner's primary aims was to establish a spiritual yet nondenominational setting for children from all backgrounds&lt;ref name="Nielsen2004"/&gt;{{rp|79}}&lt;ref name=Krogh/&gt;&lt;ref name=oberski&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oberski|first=Iddo|title=Rudolf Steiner's philosophy of freedom as a basis for spiritual education?|journal=International Journal of Children's Spirituality|date=February 2011|volume=16|issue=1|page=14|doi=10.1080/1364436x.2010.540751}}&lt;/ref&gt; that recognized the value of role models drawn from a wide range of literary and historical traditions in developing children's fantasy and moral imaginations.&lt;ref name=Ullrich/&gt;{{rp|78}} Indeed, for Steiner, education was an activity which fosters the human being's connection to the divine and is thus inherently religious.&lt;ref name=zander2007&gt;{{cite book|last=Zander|first=Helmut|title=Anthroposophie in Deutschland|year=2007|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1422,1430}}

Waldorf schools were historically "Christian based and [[Theism|theistically]] oriented",&lt;ref name="FE"/&gt; as they expand into different cultural settings they are adapting to "a truly pluralistic spirituality".&lt;ref name=Woods/&gt;&lt;!-- Citing Easton --&gt;{{rp|146}} Waldorf theories and practices are often modified from their European and Christian roots to meet the historical and cultural traditions of the local community.&lt;ref name=WholeChild&gt;{{cite journal|last=Easton|first=Freda|title=Educating the whole child, "head, heart, and hands": Learning from the Waldorf experience|journal=Theory into Practice|date=1 March 1997|volume=36|issue=2|pages=87–94|doi=10.1080/00405849709543751}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such adaptation include the Waldorf schools in [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and Japan, which celebrate festivals drawn from these cultures, and classes in the Milwaukee Urban Waldorf school, which have adopted African American and Native American traditions.&lt;ref name="McDermott_etal"/&gt; Such festivals, as well as assemblies generally, which play an important role in Waldorf schools, generally center on classes presenting their work.

Religion classes, universally absent from American Waldorf schools,&lt;ref&gt;Mark Riccio, ''Rudolf Steiner's Impulse in Education'', dissertation, Columbia University Teachers College, 2000, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; are a mandatory offering in some German federal states, whereby in Waldorf schools each religious denomination provides its own teachers for the classes, and a non-denominational religion class is also offered. In the United Kingdom, public Waldorf schools are not categorized as "[[Faith schools]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/1467-8527.00201|title=Policy on School Diversity: Taking an Existential Turn in the Pursuit of Valued Learning?|year=2002|last1=Woods|first1=Philip A.|last2=Woods|first2=Glenys J.|journal=British Journal of Educational Studies|volume=50|issue=2|pages=254–278|jstor=3122313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Stehlik places Waldorf education in a [[humanistic education|humanistic]] tradition, and contrasts its philosophically grounded approach to "value-neutral" [[Secularism|secular]] state schooling systems.&lt;ref name="Stehlik"&gt;{{cite book|first=Tom|last=Stehlik|title=Thinking, Feeling, and Willing: How Waldorf Schools Provide a Creative Pedagogy That Nurtures and Develops Imagination.

===Teacher education===
[[File:Institut fuer Waldorf-Paedagogik.gif|thumb|right|alt3=Waldorf teacher training center in [[Witten]], Germany|Waldorf teacher training centre in [[Witten]], Germany]]
Waldorf teacher education programs offer courses in [[child development]], the methodology of Waldorf teaching, academic subjects appropriate to the future teachers' chosen specialty, and the study of pedagogical texts and other works by Steiner.&lt;ref name="Zdrazil2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scott"/&gt;&lt;ref name=oberski2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oberski|first=Iddo |author2=Alistair Pugh |author3=Astrid MacLean |author4=Peter Cope|title=Validating a Steiner-Waldorf teacher education programme|journal=Teaching in Higher Education|date=February 2007|volume=12|issue=1|pages=135–139|doi=10.1080/13562510601102388}}&lt;/ref&gt; For early childhood and elementary school teachers, the training includes considerable artistic work in storytelling, movement, painting, music, and handwork.&lt;ref name=Gidseg&gt;Eric Gidseg, "Waldorf education".

==Governance==

===Independent schools===
One of Waldorf education's central premises is that all educational and cultural institutions should be [[Self-governance|self-governing]] and should grant teachers a high degree of creative autonomy within the school;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ullrich|first=Heiner|title=Rudolf Steiner|year=2008|publisher=Continuum International Pub. Group|location=London|isbn=9780826484192|pages=152–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|143}}&lt;ref name="FE"/&gt; this is based upon the conviction that a holistic approach to education aiming at the development of free individuals can only be successful when based on a school form that expresses these same principles.&lt;ref name=Willmann&gt;Carlo Willmann, ''Waldorfpädogogik'', ''Kölner Veröffentlichungen zur Religionsgeschichte'', v. 27. Böhlau Verlag, {{ISBN|3-412-16700-2}}. See "Ganzheitliche Erziehung", 2.3.3"&lt;/ref&gt; Most Waldorf schools are not directed by a [[Principal (school)|principal]] or head teacher, but rather by a number of groups, including:
* The ''college of teachers'', who decide on pedagogical issues, normally on the basis of consensus. This group is usually open to full-time teachers who have been with the school for a prescribed period of time. Each school is accordingly unique in its approach, as it may act solely on the basis of the decisions of the college of teachers to set policy or other actions pertaining to the school and its students.&lt;ref name="IO"/&gt;
* The ''board of trustees'', who decide on governance issues, especially those relating to school finances and legal issues, including formulating strategic plans and central policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whywaldorfworks.org/11_EffPractices/gov_1.asp|title=ASWSNA effective practices|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parents are encouraged to take an active part in non-curricular aspects of school life.&lt;ref name="McDermott_etal"/&gt; Waldorf schools have been found to create effective adult learning communities.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Stehlik "Parenting as a Vocation", ''International Journal of Lifelong Education'' 22 (4) pp. 367–79, 2003, cited in DFES report&lt;/ref&gt;

There are coordinating bodies for Waldorf education at both the national (e.g. the ''Association of Waldorf Schools of North America'' and the ''Steiner Waldorf Schools Fellowship'' in the UK and Ireland) and international level (e.g. International Association for Waldorf Education and The European Council for Steiner Waldorf Education (ECSWE)). These organizations certify the use of the registered names "Waldorf" and "Steiner school" and offer accreditations, often in conjunction with regional independent school associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acswasc.org/vc_member.htm#wasc_awsna|title=WASC Accrediting commission for schools|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State-funded schools===

====United States====

The first US Waldorf-inspired public school, the Yuba River Charter School in California, opened in 1994. The Waldorf public school movement is currently expanding rapidly; while in 2010, there were twelve Waldorf-inspired public schools in the United States,&lt;ref name=Pap&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pappano|first=Laura|title=Waldorf Education in Public Schools: Educators adopt – and adapt – this developmental, arts-rich approach|journal=Harvard Education Letter|date=November–December 2011|volume=27|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; by 2018 there were 53 such schools.&lt;ref name=charters&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allianceforpublicwaldorfeducation.org/find-a-school/|title=Find a School - Alliance for Public Waldorf Education|website=www.allianceforpublicwaldorfeducation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Waldorf-inspired schools in the United States are elementary schools established as either [[magnet school|magnet]] or [[charter schools]]. The first Waldorf-inspired high school was launched in 2008 with assistance from the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]].&lt;ref name=Pap/&gt; While these schools follow a similar developmental approach as the independent schools, Waldorf-inspired schools must demonstrate achievement on [[standardized tests]] in order to continue receiving public funding. Studies of standardized test scores suggest that students at Waldorf-inspired schools tend to score below their peers in the earliest grades and catch up&lt;ref name=Pap/&gt; or surpass&lt;ref name="scott"&gt;{{cite news

One study found that students at Waldorf-inspired schools watch less television and spend more time engaging in creative activities or spending time with friends.&lt;ref name=Pap/&gt; Public Waldorf schools' need to demonstrate achievement through standardized test scores has encouraged increased use of textbooks and expanded instructional time for academic subjects.&lt;ref name=Pap/&gt;

A legal challenge alleging that California school districts' Waldorf-inspired schools violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] Amendments of the [[United States Constitution]] and Article IX of the [[California Constitution]] was dismissed [[Merit (legal)|on its merits]] in 2005&lt;ref&gt;The original trial ended in 30 minutes with the case being dismissed after the plaintiff failed to present an [[proffer|offer of proof (proffer)]] of evidence.

====United Kingdom&lt;!-- this section is linked-to from Steiner Academy Hereford--&gt;====
The first state-funded Steiner-Waldorf school in the United Kingdom, the [[Steiner Academy Hereford]], opened in 2008. Since then, Steiner [[Academy (English school)|academies]] have opened in [[Frome]], [[Exeter]] and [[Bristol]] as part of the government-funded [[free school (England)|free schools]] programme.

In November 2012, [[BBC News]] broadcast an item about accusations that the establishment of a state-funded Waldorf School in [[Frome]] was a misguided use of public money. The broadcast reported that concerns were being raised about Rudolf Steiner's beliefs, stating he "believed in reincarnation and said it was related to race, with black (''schwarz'') people being the least spiritually developed, and white (''weiß'') people the most."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the European Council for Steiner Waldorf Education (ECSWE) issued a statement, "Waldorf schools against discrimination", which said in part, "Waldorf schools do not select, stratify or discriminate amongst their pupils, but consider all human beings to be free and equal in dignity and rights, independent of ethnicity, national or social origin, gender, language, religion, and political or other convictions. Anthroposophy, upon which Waldorf education is founded, stands firmly against all forms of racism and nationalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Waldorf schools against discrimination |url=http://www.steinerwaldorfeurope.org/downloads/statements/ecswe_discriminationstatement.pdf |author=European Council for Steiner Waldorf Education |date=October 2007 |accessdate=29 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British Humanist Association]] critiqued a reference book used to train teachers in Steiner academies for suggesting that the heart is sensitive to emotions and promoting homeopathy, while critiquing Darwinism for purportedly reductionist thinking and Victorian ethics. [[Edzard Ernst]], emeritus professor of complementary medicine, suggested that Waldorf schools "have an anti-science agenda". A United Kingdom [[Department for Education]] spokeswoman responded that "no state school is allowed to teach homeopathy as scientific fact" and that free schools "must demonstrate that they will provide a broad and balanced curriculum".&lt;ref name="tes-pseudo"&gt;{{cite web

====Australia, New Zealand, and Canada====
Australia has "Steiner streams" incorporated into a small number of existing government schools in some states; in addition, independent Steiner-Waldorf schools receive partial government funding. The majority of Steiner-Waldorf schools in New Zealand receive a small amount of state funding. In the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Quebec and Alberta, all private schools receive partial state funding.&lt;ref&gt;Friends of Waldorf Education, [https://www.freunde-waldorf.de/en/the-friends/publications/waldorf-education-worldwide/teil-2/canada.html Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Russia====
The first Steiner school in Russia was established in 1992 in Moscow.&lt;ref name=Moscow&gt;Paull, John (2017) [https://www.academia.edu/35563554/The_First_Waldorf_School_in_Russia_A_Postcard_from_Moscow The First Waldorf School in Russia: A Postcard from Moscow], Journal of Biodynamics Tasmania. 124 (Dec): 14–17.&lt;/ref&gt; That school is now an award-winning government-funded school with over 650 students offering classes for [[kindergarten]] and years 1 to 11 (the Russian education system is an eleven year system). There are 18 Waldorf schools in Russia and 30 kindergartens. Some are government funded (with no fees) and some are privately funded (with fees for students). As well as five Waldorf schools in Moscow, there are also Waldorf schools in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Irkutsk]], [[Jaroslawl]], [[Kaluga]], [[Samara]], Schukowskij, [[Smolensk]], [[Tomsk]], [[Ufa]], [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], [[Voronezh]], and [[Zelenograd]]. The Association of Russian Waldorf Schools was founded in 1995 and now has 21 members.&lt;ref name=Moscow/&gt;

===Homeschooling===
Waldorf-inspired [[homeschooling|home schools]] typically obtain their program information through informal parent groups, online, or by purchasing a curriculum. Waldorf homeschooling groups are not affiliated with the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America (AWSNA), which represents independent schools and it is unknown how many home schools use a Waldorf-inspired curriculum.

Educationalist Sandra Chistolini suggests that parents offer their children Waldorf-inspired homeschooling because "the frustration and boredom some children feel in school are eliminated and replaced with constant attention to the needs of childhood [and] connections between content and the real world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chistolini|first=Sandra|title=Apart from the Steiner School and Montessori Method, Homeschooling is the answer for families to the social crisis of schools|journal=New Jersey Journal of Supervision and Curriculum Development|year=2009|volume=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social engagement==
Steiner's belief that all people are imbued with a spiritual core has fueled Waldorf schools' social mission.&lt;ref name=Hayes&gt;"Steiner Waldorf" in ''Encyclopedia of Primary Education'', Denis Hayes (ed.) {{ISBN|9780203864609}}. pp. 403–404&lt;/ref&gt; The schools have always been coeducational and open to children of all social classes. They were designed from the beginning to be [[comprehensive schools|comprehensive]], 12-year schools under the direction of their own teachers, rather than the state or other external authorities,&lt;ref name=EAE&gt;"Waldorf schools", ''Encyclopedia of American Education'', Harlow G.

Waldorf schools build close learning communities, founded on the shared values of its members,&lt;ref name=Woods/&gt;{{rp|17}} in ways that can lead to transformative learning experiences that allow all participants, including parents, to become more aware of their own individual path,&lt;ref name=Woods/&gt;{{rp|5,17,32,40}}&lt;ref name=Stehlik/&gt;{{rp|238}} but which at times also risk becoming exclusive.&lt;ref name=Ullrich/&gt;{{rp|167, 207}} Reports from small-scale studies suggest that there are lower levels of harassment and bullying in Waldorf schools&lt;ref name=Woods/&gt;{{rp|29}} and that European Waldorf students have extremely lower rates of [[xenophobia]] and [[gender stereotypes]] than students in any other type of schools.&lt;ref name=LW&gt;[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/karriere/schulstudie-liebe-waldorfschueler-1.551358 "Liebe Waldorfschüler"], Süddeutsche Zeitung, 17 May 2010; see [http://www.ecswe.org/wren/documents/RacismStudy.pdf "Study of racist attitudes among Waldorf school pupils"] for a summary of the study's results in English&lt;/ref&gt; Betty Reardon, a professor and peace researcher, gives Waldorf schools as an example of schools that follow a philosophy based on peace and tolerance.&lt;ref name=Tolerance/&gt;

Many private Waldorf schools experience a tension between these social goals and the way tuition fees act as a barrier to access to the education by less well-off families. Schools have attempted to improve access for a wider range of income groups by charging lower fees than comparable independent schools, by offering a sliding scale of fees, and/or by seeking state support.&lt;ref name=Ashley/&gt;

===Intercultural links in socially polarized communities===

Waldorf schools have linked polarized communities in a variety of settings.
* Under the [[apartheid]] regime in South Africa, the Waldorf school was one of the few schools in which children of all racial classifications attended the same classes, despite the ensuing loss of state aid.

===Evaluations of students' progress===
{{Details|Studies of Waldorf education}}

Although studies about Waldorf education tend to be small-scale and vary in national context, a recent independent comprehensive review of the literature concluded there is evidence that Waldorf education encourages academic achievement as well as "creative, social and other capabilities important to the holistic growth of a person."&lt;ref name=Woods/&gt;{{rp|39}}&lt;ref name=Ashley/&gt;

In comparison to state school pupils, European Waldorf students are significantly more enthusiastic about learning, report having more fun and being less bored in school, view their school environments as pleasant and supportive places where they are able to discover their personal academic strengths,&lt;ref name=Welt2012/&gt; and have more positive views of the future.&lt;ref name=JGidley&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.futures.2004.07.005|title=The evolution of futures in school education|year=2005|last1=Gidley|first1=Jennifer M.|last2=Hampson|first2=Gary P.|journal=Futures|volume=37|issue=4|page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twice as many Waldorf students as state school pupils report having good relationships with teachers; they also report significantly fewer ailments such as headaches, stomach aches, and disrupted sleep.&lt;ref name=Welt2012&gt;Fanny Jiminez, [https://www.welt.de/wissenschaft/article109484661/Namen-tanzen-fit-in-Mathe-Waldorf-im-Vorteil.html "Namen tanzen, fit in Mathe – Waldorf im Vorteil"]. ''Die Welt'' 26 September 2012, citing Barz, et. al, ''Bildungserfahrungen an Waldorfschulen: Empirische Studie zu Schulqualität und Lernerfahrungen'', 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 German study found that an above-average number of Waldorf students become teachers, doctors, engineers, scholars of the humanities, and scientists.&lt;ref name=Jimenez/&gt; Studies of Waldorf students' artistic capacities found that they averaged higher scores on the [[Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking|Torrance Test of Creative Thinking Ability]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED400948&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&amp;accno=ED400948 Earl J. Ogletree, ''The Comparative Status of the Creative Thinking Ability of Waldorf Education Students''], also reported in Woods, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; drew more accurate, detailed, and imaginative drawings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1348/000709900158263|title=The effect of three different educational approaches on children's drawing ability: Steiner, Montessori and traditional|year=2000|last1=Cox|first1=Maureen V.|last2=Rowlands|first2=Anna|journal=British Journal of Educational Psychology|volume=70|issue=4|page=485}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were able to develop richer images than comparison groups.&lt;ref name=JGidley/&gt;

Some observers have noted that Waldorf educators tend to be more concerned to address the needs of weaker students who need support than they are to meet the needs of talented students who could benefit from advanced work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rocha|first1=Doralice Lange DeSouza|title=Schools Where Children Matter: Exploring Educational Alternatives|date=2003|publisher=Foundation for Educational Renewal|location=Brandon, VT|isbn=1885580142|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educational scholars===

Professor of Educational Psychology Clifford Mayes considered that "Waldorf students learn in sequences and paces that are developmentally appropriate, aesthetically stimulating, emotionally supportive, and ecologically sensitive."&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Mayes, ''Seven Curricular Landscapes: An Approach to the Holistic Curriculum'', University Press of America. {{ISBN|076182720X}}. p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Profs. of Education Timothy Leonard and Peter Willis stated that Waldorf education "cultivates the imagination of the young to provide them a firm emotional foundation upon which to build a sound intellectual life".&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Leonard and Peter Willis, ''Pedagogies of the Imagination: Mythopoetic Curriculum in Educational Practice'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor of Education Bruce Uhrmacher considers Steiner's view on education worthy of investigation for those seeking to improve public schooling, saying the approach serves as a reminder that "holistic education is rooted in a cosmology that posits a fundamental unity to the universe and as such ought to take into account interconnections among the purpose of schooling, the nature of the growing child, and the relationships between the human being and the universe at large", and that a curriculum need not be [[Technocracy|technocratic]], but may equally well be arts-based.&lt;ref name=Uhr/&gt;{{rp|382, 401}}

[[David Elkind]] names Rudolf Steiner as one of the "giants of early-childhood development" and describes activities for young children in a Waldorf school as "social", "holistic", and "collaborative", as well as reflecting the principle that "early education must start with the child, not with the subject matter to be taught".&lt;ref name="Elkind"&gt;{{cite journal|first=David |last=Elkind |title=Much Too Early| journal= Education Next|year= 2001 |url=http://educationnext.org/much-too-early/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Nielsen, Assistant Professor at the [[University of Canberra]]'s Education Department, considers the imaginative teaching approaches used in Waldorf education (drama, exploration, storytelling, routine, arts, discussion and empathy) to be effective stimulators of spiritual-aesthetic, intellectual and physical development, expanding "the concept of holistic and imaginative education" and recommends these to mainstream educators.&lt;ref name="Nielsen2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas W. Nielsen, "Rudolf Steiner's Pedagogy of Imagination: A Phenomenological Case Study". A paper to complement a presentation given at the first ''International Conference on Imagination in Education'', 16–19 July, Vancouver, Canada, BC. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andreas Schleicher]], international coordinator of the [[PISA]] studies, commented on the "high degree of congruence between what the world demands of people, and what Waldorf schools develop in their pupils", placing a high value on creatively and productively applying knowledge to new realms. This enables "deep learning" that goes beyond studying for the next test.&lt;ref name=Jimenez&gt;Fanny Jiménez, "Wissenschaftler loben Waldorfschulen", ''Die Welt'', 27 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deborah Meier]], principal of [[Mission Hill School]] and MacArthur grant recipient, whilst having some "quibbles" about the Waldorf schools, stated: "The adults I know who have come out of Waldorf schools are extraordinary people. That education leaves a strong mark of thoroughness, carefulness, and thoughtfulness."&lt;ref&gt;Edgar Allen Beem, [http://www.hearttohand.org/PDF/Boston_Globe_Waldorf_Way.pdf The Waldorf Way], ''Boston Globe'', 16 April 2001 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726144412/http://www.hearttohand.org/PDF/Boston_Globe_Waldorf_Way.pdf |date=26 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Peterkin, Director of the Urban Superintendents Program at Harvard's Graduate School of Education and former Superintendent of [[Milwaukee]] Public Schools during a period when Milwaukee funded a public Waldorf school, considers Waldorf education a "healing education" whose underlying principles are appropriate for educating all children.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Peterkin, Director of Urban Superintendents Program, Harvard Graduate School of Education and former Superintendent of Milwaukee Public Schools, in [http://education.jhu.edu/newhorizons/strategies/topics/Arts%20in%20Education/The%20Center%20for%20Arts%20in%20the%20Basic%20Curriculum/oddleifson3.htm Boston Public Schools As Arts-Integrated Learning Organizations: Developing a High Standard of Culture for All]: "Waldorf is healing education. ... It is with a sense of adventure that the staff of Milwaukee Public Schools embraces the Waldorf concept in an urban multicultural setting. It is clear that Waldorf principles are in concert with our goals for educating all children."&lt;/ref&gt;

Waldorf education has also been studied as an example of [[educational neuroscience]] ideas in practice.&lt;ref name=larrison_diss&gt;{{cite book|last=Larrison|first=Abigail|title=Mind, Brain, and Education as a Framework for Curricular Reform|year=2013|publisher=Dissertation.

====Germany====
In 2000, educational scholar Heiner Ullrich wrote that intensive study of Steiner's pedagogy had been in progress in educational circles in Germany since about 1990 and that positions were "highly controversial: they range from enthusiastic support to destructive criticism".&lt;ref name=Ullrich/&gt; In 2008, the same scholar wrote that Waldorf schools have "not stirred comparable discussion or controversy....those interested in the Waldorf School today ... generally tend to view this school form first and foremost as a representative of internationally recognized models of applied classic reform pedagogy"&lt;ref name=UllrichRS/&gt;{{rp|140–141}} and that critics tend to focus on what they see as Steiner's "occult neo-mythology of education" and to fear the risks of indoctrination in a worldview school, but lose an "unprejudiced view of the varied practice of the Steiner schools".&lt;ref name="Ullrich"/&gt; Ullrich himself considers that the schools successfully foster dedication, openness, and a love for other human beings, for nature, and for the inanimate world.&lt;ref name=UllrichRS/&gt;{{rp|179}}

Professor of Comparative Education [[:de:Hermann Röhrs|Hermann Röhrs]] describes Waldorf education as embodying original pedagogical ideas and presenting exemplary organizational capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Röhrs|first=Hermann|title=Reformpädagogik und innere Billdungsreform|year=1998|publisher=Beltz|location=Weinheim|isbn=3892718253|pages=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with mainstream education===
{{Details|Studies of Waldorf education}}

A UK [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Skills]] report suggested that Waldorf and state schools could learn from each other's strengths: in particular, that state schools could benefit from Waldorf education's early introduction and approach to modern foreign languages; combination of block (class) and subject teaching for younger children; development of speaking and listening through an emphasis on oral work; good pacing of lessons through an emphasis on rhythm; emphasis on child development guiding the curriculum and examinations; approach to art and creativity; attention given to teachers’ reflective activity and heightened awareness (in collective child study for example); and collegial structure of leadership and management, including collegial study. Aspects of mainstream practice which could inform good practice in Waldorf schools included: management skills and ways of improving organizational and administrative efficiency; classroom management; work with secondary-school age children; and assessment and record keeping.&lt;ref name=Woods/&gt;

The way the lessons integrate traditional subject matter is, to my knowledge, unparalleled. Those in the public school reform movement have some important things to learn from what Waldorf educators have been doing for many years. It is an enormously impressive effort toward quality education."&lt;/ref&gt; Waldorf schools have been described as establishing "genuine community" and contrasted to mainstream schools, which have been described as "residential areas partitioned by bureaucratic authorities for educational purposes".&lt;ref name="Holmes2000"&gt;{{Cite journal

Many elements of Waldorf pedagogy have been used in all Finnish schools for many years.&lt;ref name=Jimenez/&gt;

Ashley described seven principal ways Waldorf education differed from mainstream approaches: its method of working from the whole to the parts, its attentiveness to child development, its goal of freedom, the deep relationships of teachers to students, the emphasis on experiencing oral traditions, the role of ritual and routine (e.g. welcoming students with a handshake, the use of opening and closing verses, and yearly festivals), the role arts and creativity play, and the [[Goethean science|Goetheanistic]] approach to science.&lt;ref name=Ashley/&gt;

=== Race ===
Racist attitudes and behaviour have been reported in particular Waldorf schools, including teachers reportedly expressing a view that individuals reincarnate through various races. Newspaper articles have reported claims that Steiner believed in a hierarchy of races, with the [[white people|white race]] at the top, and associated intelligence with having blonde hair and blue eyes.&lt;ref name = "Cook"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/education-28646118 | title=Why are Steiner schools so controversial? | author=Chris Cook | work=BBC Newsnight | date=4 August 2014 | accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Williams"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/steiner-schools-have-some-questionable-lessons-for-todays-children-a7402911.html | title=Steiner schools have some questionable lessons for today's children | author=Lee Williams | work=The Independent | date=8 November 2016| accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waldorf associations has rejected adhering to or tolerating racism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.clws.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/AWSNA-Statement-of-Equality.pdf AWSNA Statement of Equality], "racist or discriminatory tendencies are not tolerated in Waldorf schools or Waldorf teacher training institutes.

Racist views do not accord with Steiner’s longer term vision of a society in which such distinctions would be entirely irrelevant &amp; modern Steiner Waldorf schools deplore all forms of intolerance, aiming to educate in a spirit of respect &amp; to encourage open-hearted regard for others among the children they educate."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SE&gt;[https://www.waldorfschule.de/fileadmin/downloads/Erklaerungen/StuttgarterErklarung.pdf Stuttgarter Erklärung]&lt;/ref&gt;
