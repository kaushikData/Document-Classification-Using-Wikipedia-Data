      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4170">An '''accumulator''' is an [[energy storage]] device: a device which accepts [[energy]], stores energy, and releases energy as needed. Some accumulators accept energy at a low rate (low power) over a long time interval and deliver the energy at a high rate (high power) over a short time interval. Some accumulators accept energy at a high rate over a short time interval and deliver the energy at a low rate over longer time interval. Some accumulators typically accept and release energy at comparable rates. Various devices can store [[thermal energy storage|thermal energy]], [[mechanical energy]], and [[electrical energy]]. Energy is usually accepted and delivered in the same form. Some devices store a different form of energy than what they receive and deliver performing [[energy transformation|energy conversion]] on the way in and on the way out.

Examples of accumulators include [[steam accumulator]]s, [[mainspring]]s, [[flywheel energy storage]], [[hydraulic accumulator]]s, [[rechargeable battery|rechargeable batteries]], [[capacitor]]s, [[compensated pulsed alternator]]s (compulsators), and [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-storage hydroelectric]] plants.

In general usage in an electrical context, the word ''accumulator'' normally refers to a [[lead–acid battery]].

The London [[Tower Bridge]] is operated via an accumulator. The original raising mechanism was powered by pressurised water stored in several hydraulic accumulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.towerbridge.org.uk/bridge-history/ |title=Bridge History |publisher=Towerbridge.org.uk |accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, the original operating mechanism was largely replaced by a new [[electro-hydraulic servo valve|electro-hydraulic drive system]].

'''Aquantia Corporation''' is a manufacturer of high-speed transceivers. In 2004, Aquantia was founded to revolutionize Ethernet and accelerate connectivity. Aquantia first delivered products for Data Center connectivity, and in 2012 developed the world's first integrated 10GBASE-T MAC/PHY for servers. In 2014, Aquantia introduced a new Multi-Gig Ethernet technology into the Enterprise Infrastructure market and was joined by [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]] and others in co-founding the [[2.5GBASE-T and 5GBASE-T|NBASE-T Alliance]]. Their Multi-Gig technology served as the baseline for the [[802.3ba|802.3bz]] standard that was ratified by the [[IEEE]] in September 2016. This standard is now the basis for all new Multi-Gig implementations on [[Category 5 cable|Cat 5e]] and [[Category 6 cable|Cat 6]] cabling in the Enterprise, SMB and SoHo environments.

In 2016 Aquantia introduced the first 100G technology, QuantumStream. In 2017, the company introduced a class of Multi-Gig products combining their Multi-Gig PHY technologies with an Enterprise-class controller to address the next generation of Client Connectivity in PCs by collaborating with numerous PC OEMs.

Every year, more than a billion ports of Ethernet ship into a variety of platforms. These platforms have started to convert from outdated Gigabit Ethernet to Multi-Gigabit Ethernet as the demand for bandwidth and data continues to grow. The Company currently addresses the Multi-Gig upgrade cycles across their existing (Data Center, Enterprise Infrastructure and Access applications) and new markets.

It was a privately held company which had raised $178.9 million over eight rounds of funding as of mid-2015.&lt;ref name="crunchbase"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/aquantia |title=Aquantia |access-date=2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It won Company of the Year at the 2014 annual Creativity in Electronics awards,&lt;ref name="cotyaward"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/aquantia-wins-company-of-the-year-ee-times-and-edn-2014-ace-award-2014-04-02 |title=Aquantia wins Company of the Year EETimes and EDN 2014 ACE award |date=2014-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was ranked by [[Deloitte Fast 500]] as the fastest-growing semiconductor company in North America in 2014,&lt;ref name="fastest"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20141113006234/en/Aquantia-Ranks-Fastest-Growing-Semiconductor-Company-North |title=Aquantia Ranks as Fastest Growing Semiconductor Company in North America on Deloitte’s 2014 Technology Fast 500}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2015, and 2016. In 2016, Aquantia was named a finalist in UBM Tech’s [[EE Times]] and EDN Annual Creativity in Electronics (ACE) Awards for “Company of the Year".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1330812|title=2016 ACE Awards Finalists Announced |publisher= EE Times|access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company is now public, as of November 2017, and trades on the NYSE under the ticker symbol AQ.

A '''bored cylindrical lock''' is a [[lockset]] which is installed by boring two circular holes in the [[door]]. [[Door handle]]s may also use the same installation.
[[File:Mis fotos de celular 019.jpg|thumb|right|250px|]]

==Installation==
[[File:Bored cylindrical lockset door preparation.svg|thumb|right|250px|Typical preparation required for installation of a bored cylindrical lockset.]]
Two holes are bored, perpendicular to one another, into the [[door]]. The "face bore" is the larger hole which is bored into the door face and a smaller "edge bore" hole is bored into the door edge. The edge may require additional preparation to receive the latch assembly, typically by [[router (woodworking)|routing]] or [[chisel]]ing a shallow mortise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thisoldhouse.com/how-to/how-to-install-lockset |title=How to Install a Lockset |author1=Gibson, Scott |author2=Abram, Norm |author-link2=Norm Abram |publisher=This Old House |accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commercially-sold doors may come prepared to receive one or more bored cylindrical locks, such as entry doors, which typically require both a door knob and [[dead bolt]].

In the United States, typically, the face bore is sized from {{convert|1.5|to|2.125|in|cm}} in diameter and is centered at {{convert|2.375|or|2.75|in|cm}} from the leading edge of the door. This distance is referred to as the "backset."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.directdoorhardware.com/door_latch_backset.htm |title=What is Backset |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Direct Door Hardware |accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other, less popular, backsets are at {{convert|3.75|and|5|in|cm}}. Residential doors are normally prepared with a {{convert|2.375|in|cm|adj=on}} backset and commercial doors have a {{convert|2.75|in|cm|adj=on}} backset. The edge bore is typically centered on the edge.

The previous norm, the [[mortise lock]], is a more complex device, and its higher manufacturing cost as well as its more labor-intensive installation make the bored cylindrical lock an ideal substitute, both in price and functionality. Because the mortise lock has a larger lock case, a larger and more complex volume must be removed from the door before it can be installed, but the mortise lock may offer additional functions compared to a cylindrical lock; for instance, the mortise lock may include a deadbolt in a single unit, while the cylindrical lock would require separate face bores for a deadbolt and doorknob.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sargentlock.com/file_broker.php?document_id=6641 |title=Basic Technical Fundamentals of Builders Hardware: Mortise, Bored and Auxiliary Locks |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |publisher=Sargent, an Assa Abloy Company |accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1923 patent evolved from an earlier Schlage patent filed in 1920&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=1456041 |status=granted |title=Door Lock |gdate=22 May 1923 |fdate=12 April 1920 |inventor=Schlage, Walter R. |assign1=Schlage Manufacturing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a lock whose installation required a face bore and surface [[rabbet]], which simplified door preparation compared to a mortise lock.

A '''butter churn''' is a device used to convert [[cream]] into [[butter]].  This is done through a mechanical process, frequently via a pole inserted through the lid of the churn, or via a crank used to turn a rotating device inside the churn.

==Etymology==
The word “butter” is believed to be derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word bou-tyron, the approximate meaning of which is “cow cheese”. However, some believe the word came from the [[Scythians|Scythian]] culture, as the [[ancient Greeks]] tended to herd [[sheep]] and [[goats]], whose milk is not as good for butter making as that of cows, which the Scythians primarily herded.&lt;ref&gt;Douma, Michael. Butter through the Ages. 2008. Institute for Dynamic Educational Development.  http://www.webexhibits.org/butter&lt;/ref&gt;  The word "churn" is from the [[Old English]] ''ċyrin,'' to churn.  This is probably derived from the Old English ''cyrnel,'' "kernel," due to the appearance of butter grains after milk has been churned.&lt;ref&gt;"churn, n." The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. OED Online. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The butter churn gave its name to the [[milk churn]], early examples of which were based on butter churns. The milk churn is not, however, used for the act of churning, but rather to transport milk.

==History==
Evidence for the use of butter dates back as early as 2000 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th Edition.  2009 pg:1 -1.  “Butter.”&lt;/ref&gt; and there is mention of it in [[biblical]] works.  The butter churn itself may have existed as early as the 6th century AD, as can be seen by what appears to be a churn lid dating from that era.&lt;ref&gt;National Museums of Scotland, “Churn Lid.”  http://nms.scran.ac.uk/database/record.php?usi=000-100-103-159-C&lt;/ref&gt;
In the European tradition, the butter churn was primarily a device used by women, and the churning of butter was an essential responsibility along with other household chores.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Joan M.  What's in a Butter Churn? Objects and Women's Oral History.  1983. https://www.jstor.org/stable/3345974&lt;/ref&gt;   In earlier traditions of butter making, [[nomadic]] cultures placed milk in skin bags and produced butter either by shaking the bag manually, or possibly by attaching the bag to a pack animal, and producing butter simply through the movement of the animal.  Some theorists believe this is how the butter creation process was discovered.  Some cultures still use a process similar to this, whereby a bag is filled with milk, tied to a stick, and vigorously shaken.

==Types of butter churns==
[[Image:Խնոցի.JPG|thumb|An old vertical butter churn in [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic|Artsakh Republic]].]]
The most historically prominent types of butter churns are the plunge churn, which is a container, usually made out of [[wood]], where the butter-making action is created by moving in a vertical motion a staff that is inserted into the top.  This type of churn is also known as an ‘up and down’ churn, churning tub, plunger churn, plumping churn, knocker churn, plump-kirn, or plowt-kirn (where “kirn" is a Scots/Northern English word for churn).  The staff used in the churn is known as the dash, dasher-staff, churn-staff, churning-stick, plunger, plumper, or kirn-staff.&lt;ref&gt;“Old and Interesting” http://www.oldandinteresting.com/history-butter-churns.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Another prominent type of churn was the paddle churn, which was a container that contained a paddle, which was operated by a handle.  The paddle churned the butter inside the container when the handle was turned.
[[File:Paddle type hand-cranked butter churn.jpg|thumb|Paddle type hand-cranked butter churn]]

The barrel churn was also used extensively.  This type of churn was a barrel turned onto its side with a crank attached.  The crank either turned a paddle device inside the churn, as in the paddle churn, or turned the whole barrel, whose action converted the milk to butter.  The barrel churn was one of the agricultural innovations of 18th century [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soilandhealth.org/03sov/0302hsted/030205ellis/030205butter.cheese.html Ellis: Butter and Cheese, Soil And Health Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

One particularly novel invention of note was the [[rocking chair]] butter churn.  This device, invented by Alfred Clark, consisted of a barrel attached to a rocking chair. While the rocking chair moved, the barrel moved and churned the milk within into butter.&lt;ref&gt;Sabin, L.  “What a Wild Idea.”  Boys’ Life, Sep 1990.  80.1, p 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BytesForAll''' (also known as '''B4A''' or '''BfA''') is a [[South Asia]]n initiative to focus on how [[information technology]] and the [[internet]] can help in taking up social development issues. It is one of the oldest [[ICT4D]] (information and communication technologies for development) networks in South Asia. It was launched at a time when ICT4D was yet to become a buzz-word on the development circuit, and was still largely unnoticed for its potential.

==FLOSS-inspired==
[[Image:Bytesforallfounders.jpg|right|thumb|340px|Co-founders of BytesForAll, Frederick FN Noronha (left) and Partha Pratim Sarkar.]] BytesForAll was founded in July 1999 by [[Frederick Noronha]] of [[Goa]], [[India]] and [[Partha Pratim Sarkar]] of [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;Association for Progressive Communications - "BytesForAll launches draft report on the use of technology for development in Bangladesh" - Press release By FN for APCNews = 29 January 2007 - [http://www.apc.org/en/news/governance/world/bytesforall-launches-draft-report-use-technology-d]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CBS News - "Is Bill Gates' Halo Tarnished?" - Dan Collins - Nov. 14, 2002 - [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/11/14/tech/main529355.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt; Photo alongside shows Noronha (left) and Sarkar at an April 2006 APC-organized meet in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It is inspired by the [[FLOSS|Free/Libre and Open Source Software]] ([[FLOSS]]) model, and says it prefers to be an unfunded, volunteer-driven project.

In 2005, BytesForAll became the lone member of the [[Association for Progressive Communications]] or APC in South Asia.

==Mailing list==
BytesForAll_Readers had some 1,548 subscribers as of October 2006, and describes itself saying it "is particularly designed for BytesForAll readers and supporters who want to take part and want to be updated about ICT and development-related issues in South Asia."

The BytesForAll mailings and discussions via its mailing list are summarised and published each month in the i4d magazine published from near [[New Delhi]] each month. BytesForAll has also shared contents and columns with the Spider internet magazine of [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]] ([[Dawn]] group), and earlier with the Express Computer magazine of the [[Indian Express]] group of [[Mumbai]], [[India]].

==Among oldest==
BytesForAll also describes itself as "being one of the oldest network on ICT4D issues in South Asia". Its mailing list, which is watched by a number of [[Information and Communications Technology|ICT]] enthusiasts and academics across the globe sees itself as a forum that "encourages a free flow of information and a lively debate and discussion on people-oriented IT practices."

The first issue of BytesForAll e-zine (July 1999) is archived online by the Inti.be website.

==Volunteers, team==
Run by a volunteer administration team.

One of the goals of the BytesForAll project is to build people-to-people links across the diverse yet similar countries of South Asia, a region which is home to a huge population, but also faces a lot of political trouble at times.

BytesForAll is a [[virtual organisation]] which does not have a physical office or entity. Its members and volunteers interact via cyberspace, through email and occasional group [[online chat|chat]] sessions.

==News, criticism of South Asian ICT issues==
{{unsourced section|date=May 2016}}
BytesForAll has emerged as one of the credible sources of news and criticism of the [[ICT4D]] networks in South Asia. It is read by campaigners, activists at the grassroots, people involved with actual projects, funders, key players in the development debate and also academics in both South and North.

One of the early, tone-setting essays is titled '''When a Modem Costs More than a Cow''' and is by noted [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]]-based photographer [[Shahidul Alam]] who has founded Drik based in the locality of [[Dhanmondi]]. In it, Alam argues strongly a case for [[Information and Communications Technology|ICT]] and technology to reach the poor. He says, "Where information is power, denying information to marginalized communities, actively prevents the rural poor from overcoming the unequal power structures that they are trapped within. While it is in the interest of the powerful in society to restrict such access, it is also in the interest of the powerful nations to deny access and maintain domination. The unrestricted flow of general information is an essential pre-requisite for an egalitarian society."

==Covering the field==
Over the years, BytesForAll has been intensively covering the field, mainly through its volunteer network of journalists and writers. BytesForAll has highlighted and tracked the growth of certain projects from South Asia, including the Hole In The Wall project, the [[Simputer]], and [[free software]] ([[alternative terms for free software|or FLOSS]]). BytesForAll has actively debated the growth of Free Software and Open Source in South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foss4us.org/node/196 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 8, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060711163520/http://foss4us.org/node/196 |archivedate=July 11, 2006 |first=Frederick|last=Noronha|type=blog post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2006, BytesForAll set up its BytesForAll_FLOSS network to build links among supporters of [[FLOSS]] and techies dabbling in it, in South Asia.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

Over the years, BytesForAll has been able to build links and bridges among techies and development activists (specially those with a tech focus) in the South Asian region.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s Andrew W. Mellon Professor of Human Development in the Program in Science, Technology, and Society and Director of the MIT India Program Prof. Kenneth Kenniston has called BytesForAll "the single most valuable source of information on 'IT for the people' projects anywhere in South Asia."{{cn|date=May 2016}}

=="Beyond the ... digital divide"==
BytesForAll has argued that it goes "beyond the popular concept of [[digital divide]]. We not only recognize that there is a widespread disparity between information have and have-nots (in terms of access and distribution) but also raise and analyze the issues that put them trapped into it and bring about solutions wherever they exist."{{cn|date=May 2016}} It adds that this network "want(s) to see how IT are being used for the benefit of the dis-empowered, one who has no purchasing power to tempt the market to build solutions for him or her."{{cn|date=May 2016}}

BytesForAll has taken online issues relating to IT and public health, disaster mitigation, non-English computing, mass education and the like. It described its activities thus; "Each month an offline E-zine goes out to its interested readers. In doing so, it has managed to highlight a surprising number of often-unnoticed success stories from a region where access to computers is still a class privilege."{{cn|date=May 2016}}

It has focused repeatedly on issues such as efforts to promote computing in regional languages through GNU/Linux; the Learn Foundation's experience in laying a knowledge pipeline in rural Bangladesh; PraDeshta's idea of deploying a broadband communication network in Bangladesh; SDNP Pakistan's success in developing a knowledge network within the country; [[Kothmale]]'s implementation of innovative "community radio" services in rural Sri Lanka, among others.

Themes it has also focused on include IT-for-public health, Free/Libre and Open Source Software ([[FLOSS]]), ICT and human rights, emerging ICT technologies, community radio concerns, ICT for poverty alleviation, ICT for mass education, the knowledge society, local language computing initiatives, the "digital divide" generally, ongoing conferences and seminars in the region, and e-governance issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centerdigitalgov.com/international/story.php?docid=36557 Partha Pratim Sarker] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713183004/http://www.centerdigitalgov.com/international/story.php?docid=36557 |date=2007-07-13 }} Government Technology International | December 2002 (Retrieved 2007-04-26)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1,3,5,7-Cyclooctatetraene''' ('''COT''') is an [[saturation (chemistry)|unsaturated]] [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivative]] of [[cyclooctane]], with the formula C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is also known as [8][[annulene]].  This polyunsaturated [[hydrocarbon]] is a colorless to light yellow flammable liquid at room temperature.  Because of its stoichiometric relationship to [[benzene]], COT has been the subject of much research and some controversy.

Unlike benzene, C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, cyclooctatetraene, C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, is not [[aromaticity|aromatic]], although its [[dianion]], {{chem|C|8|H|8|2-}} ([[Cyclooctatetraenide anion|cyclooctatetraenide]]), is. Its reactivity is characteristic of an ordinary [[polyene]], i.e. it undergoes [[addition reaction]]s.  Benzene, by contrast, characteristically undergoes [[substitution reaction]]s, not additions.

==History==
1,3,5,7-Cyclooctatetraene was initially synthesized by [[Richard Willstätter]] in Munich in 1905:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mason|first= S. |title=The Science and Humanism of Linus Pauling (1901−1994) |journal=[[Chem. Soc. Rev.]] |volume=26 |pages=29–39 |date=February 1997|doi=10.1039/CS9972600029}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[File:Willstaetter Synthesis COT.svg|450px|Willstätter's synthesis of cyclooctatetraene (1905).]]

Willstätter noted that the compound did not exhibit the expected aromaticity.  Between 1939 and 1943, chemists throughout the US unsuccessfully attempted to synthesize COT.  They rationalized their lack of success with the conclusion that Willstätter had not actually synthesized the compound but instead its isomer, [[styrene]]. Willstätter responded to these reviews in his autobiography, where he noted that the American chemists were 'untroubled' by the reduction of his cyclooctatetraene to cyclooctane (a reaction impossible for styrene).  During World War 2, [[Walter Reppe]] at [[BASF]] Ludwigshafen developed a simple, one-step synthesis of cyclooctatetraene from acetylene, providing material identical to that prepared by Willstätter.&lt;ref name=reppe&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; Any remaining doubts on the accuracy of Willstätter's original synthesis were resolved when Arthur C. Cope and co-workers at [[MIT]] reported, in 1947, a complete repetition of the Willstätter synthesis, step by step, using the originally reported techniques. They obtained the same cyclooctatetraene,&lt;ref name=house1&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; and they subsequently reported modern spectral characterization of many of the intermediate products, again confirming the accuracy of Willstätter's original work.&lt;ref name=house2&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and bonding==
[[File:All-Z-Cyclooctatetraene 3D skeletal formula.svg|left|180px|thumb|Cyclooctatetraene in its native "tub-shaped" conformation.]]
Early studies demonstrated that COT did not display the chemistry of an aromatic compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson |first=A. W. |journal=Sci. Progr. |page=506 |date=1947 |volume=35|title=Organic Chemistry|jstor=43413011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Then, early electron diffraction experiments concluded that the C-C bond distances were identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Bastiensen|first1= O.|last2= Hassel|first2= O.|last3= Langseth|first3= A. |title= The ‘Octa-Benzene’, Cyclo-octatetraene (C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) |journal= [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=160 |issue= 4056 |year= 1947 |pages= 128|url= http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v160/n4056/pdf/160128a0.pdf |doi= 10.1038/160128a0 |bibcode = 1947Natur.160..128B }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
However, X-ray diffraction data from H.&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;Kaufman demonstrated cyclooctatetraene to adopt several [[Cyclohexane conformation|conformations]] and to contain two distinct C–C bond distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kaufman|first1= H. S.|last2= Fankuchen|first2= I.|first3= Mark|last3= H. |title= Structure of Cyclo-octatetraene |journal= [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume= 161 |issue= 4083 |year= 1948 |pages= 165|url= http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v161/n4083/pdf/161165a0.pdf |doi= 10.1038/161165a0 |bibcode = 1948Natur.161..165K }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
This result indicated that COT is an [[annulene]] with fixed alternating single and double C-C bonds.

In its normal state, cyclooctatetraene is non-planar and adopts a tub conformation with angles C=C−C&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;126.1° and C=C−H&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;117.6°.&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;{{cite journal

In its planar transition state, D&lt;sub&gt;4h&lt;/sub&gt; transitional state is more stable than D&lt;sub&gt;8h&lt;/sub&gt; transitional state due to [[Jahn–Teller effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nishinaga|first1=Tohru|last2=Ohmae|first2=Takeshi|last3=Iyoda|first3=Masahiko|title=Recent Studies on the Aromaticity and Antiaromaticity of Planar Cyclooctatetraene|journal=Aromaticity and Molecular Symmetry|date=5 February 2010|volume=2|issue=1|pages=76–97|doi=10.3390/sym2010076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthesis==
Richard Willstätter's original synthesis (4 consecutive [[elimination reaction]]s on a cyclooctane framework) gives relatively low yields.  Reppe's synthesis of cyclooctatetraene, which involves treating [[acetylene]] at high pressure with a warm mixture of [[nickel cyanide]] and [[calcium carbide]], was much better, with [[chemical yield]]s near 90%:&lt;ref name=reppe/&gt;

:[[File:Reppe Synthesis COT.svg|frameless|upright=1.5|Reppe's synthesis of cyclooctatetraene]]

COT can also be prepared by [[photolysis]] of [[barrelene]], one of its [[structural isomer]]s, the reaction proceeding via another isolable isomer, [[Bullvalene#Semibullvalene|semibullvalene]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |doi= 10.1021/ja00953a045 |last1= Zimmerman|first1= H. E.|last2= Grunewald|first2= G. L.|year= 1966|title= The Chemistry of Barrelene. III.

In the sequence illustrated below, octaethylcyclooctatetraene (C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;[[Ethyl group|Et]]&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) is formed by [[isomerisation|thermal isomerisation]] of octaethylsemibullvalene, itself formed by [[copper(I) bromide]] mediated [[Dimer (chemistry)|cyclodimerisation]] of 1,2,3,4-tetraethyl-1,4-dilithio-1,3-butadiene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Wang|first1= C.|last2= Yuan|first2= J.|last3= Li|first3= G.|last4= Wang|first4= Z.|last5= Zhang|first5= S.|last6= Xi|first6= Z.|year= 2006|title= Metal-Mediated Efficient Synthesis, Structural Characterization, and Skeletal Rearrangement of Octasubstituted Semibullvalenes|journal= [[J.

:[[File:NewSemibullvaleneSynthesis.png|frameless|600px|Synthesis of octaethylsemibullvalene from 1,2,3,4-tetraethyl-1,4-diiodo-1,3-butadiene and its thermal isomerisation to octaethylcyclooctatetraene]]

Because COT is unstable and easily forms explosive [[organic peroxide]]s, a small amount of [[hydroquinone]] is usually added to commercially available material. Testing for peroxides is advised when using a previously opened bottle; white crystals around the neck of the bottle may be composed of the peroxide, which may explode when mechanically disturbed.

==Natural occurrence==
Cyclooctatetraene has been isolated from certain fungi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stinson | first1 = M. | last2 = Ezra | first2 = D. | last3 = Hess | first3 = W.

==Reactions==
The π bonds in COT react as usual for olefins, rather than as aromatic ring systems. Mono- and poly[[epoxide]]s can be generated by reaction of COT with [[peroxy acid]]s or with [[dimethyldioxirane]]. Various other addition reactions are also known.  Furthermore, [[polyacetylene]] can be synthesized via the [[ring-opening polymerization]] of cyclooctatetraene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Two Undergraduate Experiments in Organic Polymers: The Preparation of Polyacetylene and Telechelic Polyacetylene via Ring-Opening Metathesis Polymerization |first1=Eric J. |last1=Moorhead |first2=Anna G. |last2=Wenzel |journal=[[Journal of Chemical Education|J.

Cyclooctatetraene also undergoes [[rearrangement reaction]]s to form [[aromatic ring]] systems. For instance, [[Organic redox reaction|oxidation]] with [[aqueous]] [[mercury(II) sulfate]] forms [[phenylacetaldehyde]]&lt;ref name=reppe /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kunichika|first1=Sango|title=Cyclopolyolefins Derived from Acetylene|journal=Bulletin of the Institute for Chemical Research, Kyoto University|date=1953|volume=31|issue=5|pages=323–335|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2433/75368}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Photochemistry#Organic_photochemistry|photochemical]] rearrangement of its mono-[[epoxide]] forms [[benzofuran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holovka|first1=J.

[[Image:Cyclooctatetraenide-3D-ball.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Ball-and-stick model]] of COT&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;]]
COT readily reacts with [[potassium]] metal to form the salt K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;COT, which contains the dianion {{chem|C|8|H|8|2−}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The cyclooctatetraenyl dianion |first=Thomas J. |last=Katz |journal=[[J.

Cyclooctatetraene forms [[Organometallic chemistry#Organometallic compounds|organometallic complexes]] with some metals, including [[yttrium]] and [[lanthanide]]s.

'''Drug delivery''' refers to approaches, formulations, technologies, and systems for transporting a [[pharmaceutical]] compound in the body as needed to safely achieve its desired [[therapeutic effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reference.md/files/D016/mD016503.html|title=Drug Delivery Systems (definition)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may involve scientific site-targeting within the body, or it might involve facilitating systemic [[pharmacokinetics]]; in any case, it is typically concerned with both quantity and duration of drug presence. Drug delivery is often approached via a drug's chemical formulation, but it may also involve medical devices or drug-device combination products. Drug delivery is a concept heavily integrated with [[dosage form]] and [[route of administration]], the latter sometimes even being considered part of the definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/drug+delivery|title=Drug delivery - definition of drug delivery by Medical dictionary|work=TheFreeDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drug delivery technologies modify drug release profile, absorption, distribution and elimination for the benefit of improving product efficacy and safety, as well as patient convenience and compliance. Drug release is from: diffusion, degradation, swelling, and affinity-based mechanisms.&lt;ref name="affinity based dds"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=NX.|author2=von Recum, HA|title=Affinity-Based Drug Delivery|journal=Macromol Biosci|year=2011|volume=11|pages=321–332|doi=10.1002/mabi.201000206}} &lt;/ref&gt; Some of the common routes of administration include the enteral (gastrointestinal tract), parenteral (via injections), inhalation, transdermal, topical and oral routes. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.lanecc.edu/users/driscolln/RT114/Medication_Administration/Intro_Pharmacology/Intro_Pharmacology8.html?|title=COMMON ROUTES OF DRUG ADMINISTRATION |accessdate=2018-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nursingtimes.net/clinical-archive/medicine-management/the-administration-of-medicines/288560.article|title= The administration of medicines|accessdate=2018-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; . Many medications such as [[peptide]] and [[protein]], [[antibody]], [[vaccine]] and [[gene]] based drugs, in general may not be delivered using these routes because they might be susceptible to enzymatic degradation or can not be absorbed into the systemic circulation efficiently due to molecular size and charge issues to be therapeutically effective. For this reason many [[protein]] and [[peptide]] drugs have to be delivered by [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] or a [[nanoneedle]] array. 
For example, many [[immunization]]s are based on the delivery of protein drugs and are often done by injection.

Current efforts in the area of drug delivery include the development of [[targeted drug delivery|targeted delivery]] in which the drug is only active in the target area of the body (for example, in [[cancer]]ous tissues), [[sustained release dosage forms|sustained release formulations]] in which the drug is released over a period of time in a controlled manner from a formulation, and methods to increase survival of peroral agents which must pass through the stomach's acidic environment. In order to achieve efficient targeted delivery, the designed system must avoid the host's defense mechanisms and circulate to its intended site of action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bertrand N, Leroux JC. |title=The journey of a drug carrier in the body: an anatomo-physiological perspective |journal= Journal of Controlled Release |year=2011 |doi=10.1016/j.jconrel.2011.09.098 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168365911009527 |pmid=22001607 |volume=161 |issue=2 |pages=152–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Types of sustained release formulations include [[liposome]]s, drug loaded biodegradable [[microsphere]]s and drug polymer conjugates.  Survival of agents as they pass through the stomach typically is an issue for agents which cannot be encased in a solid tablet; one research area has been around the utilization of lipid isolates from the acid-resistant [[archaea]] ''[[Sulfolobus]] islandicus'', which confers on the order of 10% survival of liposome-encapsulated agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Acid-friendly Microbe Finds Application in Drug Delivery|last = Staff|date = 2015|work = American Laboratory|type = paper|page = 7|volume = 47|issue = 9|issn = 0044-7749}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Eco''RI''' (pronounced "eco R one") is a restriction [[endonuclease]] enzyme isolated from species ''[[E. coli]].'' The ''Eco'' part of the enzyme's name originates from the species from which it was isolated, while the R represents the particular strain, in this case RY13. The last part of its name, the I, denotes that it was the first enzyme isolated from this strain. ''Eco''RI is a restriction enzyme that cleaves DNA double helices into fragments at specific sites. It is also a part of the [[restriction modification system]].

In [[molecular biology]] it is used as a [[restriction enzyme]]. ''Eco''RI creates 4 nucleotide [[DNA end|sticky ends]] with [[5' end]] overhangs of AATT. The nucleic acid recognition sequence where the enzyme cuts is G/AATTC, which has a [[Palindrome|palindromic]], complementary sequence of CTTAA/G. The / in the sequence indicates which phosphodiester bond the enzyme will break in the DNA molecule. Other restriction enzymes, depending on their cut sites, can also leave 3' overhangs or blunt ends with no overhangs.

== Structure ==

=== Primary structure ===
''Eco''RI contains the PD..D/EXK motif within its active site like many [[Restriction enzyme|restriction endonucleases]].

=== Tertiary and quaternary structure ===

== Uses ==

Restriction enzymes, such as ''Eco''RI, are used in a wide variety of molecular genetics techniques including [[Clone (genetics)|cloning]], DNA screening and deleting sections of DNA ''in vitro''. Restriction enzymes, like ''Eco''RI, that generate [[Sticky and blunt ends|sticky ends]] of DNA are often used to cut DNA prior to [[DNA ligase|ligation]], as the sticky ends make the [[DNA ligase|ligation reaction]] more efficient. ''Eco''RI can exhibit non-site-specific cutting, known as [[star activity]], depending on the conditions present in the reaction. Conditions that can induce star activity when using ''Eco''RI include low salt concentration, high glycerol concentration, excessive amounts of enzyme present in the reaction, high pH and contamination with certain organic solvents. The cut made by the Eco RI enzyme produces sticky ends on the vector mainly plasmids or viral DNA's. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/faqproductR0101.asp#1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
The [[Idaho Springs, Colorado]]-born Eaves earned her [[civil engineering]] degree at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] in 1920. Eaves began her engineering experience before she received her university degree. She was a draftsman for the United States Bureau of Public Roads in Denver, Colorado, and then the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad|Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Layne|first1=Margaret E., Editor|title=Women In Engineering: Pioneers and Trailblazers|date=2009|publisher=American Society of Civil Engineers|location=Reston, Virginia|isbn=9780784409800|page=173|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/698843163}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926 she started working for [[McGraw-Hill]] in [[New York City]] for the [[Engineering News-Record]] Department.Also Eaves was publication and sales manager of the McGraw-Hill Construction Daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Layne|first1=Margaret E., Editor|title=Women In Engineering: Pioneers and Trailblazers|date=2009|publisher=American Society of Civil Engineers|location=Reston, Virginia|isbn=9780784409800|page=175|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/698843163}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1927, she was the first woman admitted to full membership to the American Society of Civil Engineers.  In 1945, she became the manager of ''Business News''. She was the first woman to be admitted to the American Association of Cost Engineers in 1957. She retired in 1963, but continued practicing as an adviser to the [[National Commission on Urban Affairs]] on the subject of housing costs. She advised the International Executive Service Corps about construction costs in [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Elsie Eaves profile|work=Distinguished Women of Past and Present|url=http://www.distinguishedwomen.com/biographies/eaves.html|accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6591">'''Endohedral hydrogen fullerene''' ([[Hydrogen|H]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@[[Carbon|C]]&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;) is an [[endohedral fullerenes|endohedral fullerene]] containing molecular [[hydrogen]]. This [[chemical compound]] has a potential application in [[molecular electronics]] and was synthesized in 2005 at [[Kyoto University]] by the group of Koichi Komatsu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/chem.200390184|year=2003|author1=Murata, Y |author2=Murata, M |author3=Komatsu, K |title=Synthesis, structure, and properties of novel open-cage fullerenes having heteroatom(s) on the rim of the orifice|volume=9|issue=7|pages=1600–9|pmid=12658659|journal=Chemistry: A European Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1106185|year=2005|author1=Komatsu, K |author2=Murata, M |author3=Murata, Y |title=Encapsulation of molecular hydrogen in fullerene C60 by organic synthesis|volume=307|issue=5707|pages=238–40|pmid=15653499|journal=Science|bibcode=2005Sci...307..238K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ordinarily the payload of endohedral fullerenes are inserted at the time of the synthesis of the fullerene itself or is introduced to the fullerene at very low yields at high temperatures and high pressure. This particular fullerene was synthesised in an unusual way in three steps starting from pristine C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; fullerene: cracking open the carbon framework, insert hydrogen gas and zipping up by [[organic synthesis]] methods.

==Organic synthesis==
''Scheme 1'' presents an overview of the first step, the creation of a 13 membered ring orifice on the fullerene surface. A [[triazine|1,2,4-triazine]] '''2''' is fitted with two [[phenyl]] groups and a [[pyridine]] group for reasons of [[solubility]] and reacted in [[1,2-Dichlorobenzene|1,2-dichlorobenzene]] with pristine C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; fullerene '''2''' in a [[Diels-Alder]] reaction at high temperature and for an extended reaction time. In this reaction nitrogen is expulsed and an 8-membered ring is formed ('''3'''). This orifice is further extended by reaction with [[singlet oxygen]]  in [[carbon tetrachloride]] which causes one of the ring [[alkene]] groups to oxidize to a [[ketone]]. The 12-ring is extended to a 13-ring by reaction with elemental [[sulfur]] in presence of [[tetrakis(dimethylamino)ethylene]].

[[Image:Fullerene opening overview.png|center|600px|Scheme 1. Endohedral hydrogen fullerene overview]]

The proposed [[reaction mechanism]] is depicted in a plat surface rendition in ''scheme 2''. In the first step the triazine reacts with the fullerene in a [[Diels-Alder]] reaction. In the second step nitrogen is expulsed from the DA adduct '''2''' resulting in the formation of a fused aza-cyclohexadiene ring followed by a [4+4][[cycloaddition]] to an intermediate '''4''' with two [[cyclopropane]] rings. This intermediate quickly rearranges in a retro [2+2+2]cycloaddition to the 8 membered ring product '''5'''. [[In silico]] calculations show that the electrons in the [[HOMO]] reside primarily in the double bonds of the [[butadiene]] part of the ring and indeed [[singlet oxygen]] reacts at these positions through the [[oxetane|dioxetane]] intermediate '''6''' with alkene cleavage to diketone '''7''' (only one isomer shown).  Elemental [[sulfur]] S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; is inserted into the single bond of the diene group leading to the extension of the ring to 13 atoms (structures '''8''' and '''9''' are identical). Tetrakis(dimethylamino)ethylene activates this bond for electrophilic sulfur addition either by [[one-electron reduction]] or by complexation.

[[Image:Fullerene opening flat perspective.png|center|500px|Scheme 2. Endohedral hydrogen fullerene mechanism]]

From [[X-ray crystallography]] it is determined that the shape of the orifice in the sulfur compound is roughly a circle. Inserting hydrogen in this compound is an easy step taking place with 100% efficiency. Zipping up the orifice is a reversal of the steps required to open the cage. Care must be taken to keep the reaction conditions below 160&amp;nbsp;°C on order to prevent hydrogen from escaping. [[m-CPBA]] oxidizes the sulfur group to a [[sulfoxide]] group which can then be extracted from the ring by a [[photochemical]] reaction under visible light in toluene. The two ketone groups are re-coupled in a [[McMurry reaction]] with [[titanium tetrachloride]] and elemental [[zinc]]. The reverse cycloadditions take place at 340&amp;nbsp;°C in a vacuum splitting of 2-cyanopyridine and diphenylacetylene resulting in the formation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; at a 40% [[chemical yield]] starting from pristine fullerene.

==Properties==
H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; is found to be a stable molecule. it survives 10 minutes at 500&amp;nbsp;°C and shows the same chemical reactivity as empty C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;. The electronic properties are also largely unaffected.

The process of hydrogen introduction and release can be facilitated by increasing the size of the orifice. This can be done by replacing sulfur by [[selenium]] ([[sodium thiolate]], Se&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) exploiting larger C-Se [[bond length]]. Filling cracked-open fullerene now takes 8 hours at 190&amp;nbsp;°C at 760 [[atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]] (77 [[megapascal|MPa]]) of hydrogen and release between 150&amp;nbsp;°C and 180&amp;nbsp;°C is three times as fast compared to the sulfur analogue. The [[activation energy]] for release is lowered by 0.7 kcal/mol to 28.2 [[Calorie|kcal]]/[[mole (unit)|mol]] (2.9 to 118 [[kilojoule|kJ]]/mol).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/b616478a|year=2007|author1=Chuang, Sc |author2=Murata, Y |author3=Murata, M |author4=Mori, S |author5=Maeda, S |author6=Tanabe, F |author7=Komatsu, K |title=Fine tuning of the orifice size of an open-cage fullerene by placing selenium in the rim: insertion/release of molecular hydrogen|issue=12|pages=1278–80|pmid=17356782|journal=Chemical Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that hydrogen in the fullerene cage is not completely shielded from the outside world as one study found that H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; is more efficient at [[Quenching (fluorescence)|quenching]] [[singlet oxygen]] than empty C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja076104s|year=2007|author1=López-Gejo, J |author2=Martí, Aa |author3=Ruzzi, M |author4=Jockusch, S |author5=Komatsu, K |author6=Tanabe, F |author7=Murata, Y |author8=Turro, Nj |title=Can H2 inside C60 communicate with the outside world?|volume=129|issue=47|pages=14554–5|pmid=17985904|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:EPS Merchants.png|right|The EPS logo]]

The '''Express Payment System''', more commonly known as the '''EPS''', was the [[EFTPOS]] system originally of the [[automatic teller machine|ATM]] cards of [[Bank of the Philippine Islands]] and its subsidiaries, BPI Family Savings Bank and [[BPI Direct Savings Bank]].  Today, it is the EFTPOS system of the [[Expressnet]] [[interbank network]] in the [[Philippines]].  The system is the most popular EFTPOS system for ATM cardholders in the Philippines and is accepted nationwide.  Rivals of the network include [[MegaLink]]'s PayLink and the similarly named [[BancNet Payment System]] (BPS).

Although the Philippines is largely still a [[cash]]-based [[society]], the EPS is slowly getting widespread prominence.  Since its launch, it has expanded to be found in many stores nationwide and has since expanded from its roots with [[Bank of the Philippine Islands|BPI]], which also pioneered Expressnet.  In fact, the EPS is no longer limited to shopping: the EPS can also be used for things such as paying doctor's fees or paying for a haircut with the swipe of one's ATM card.  Currently, there are more than 13,000 EPS merchants throughout the Philippines.

In 2005, the EPS expanded to include the ATM cards of [[Banco de Oro]] and [[Land Bank of the Philippines]], both Expressnet members.  However, many EPS merchants claim that their EPS terminal works only with BPI ATM cards or do not know how to use Banco de Oro or Landbank cards with the EPS terminal; this is because virtually all EPS terminals are BPI terminals (Banco de Oro and Landbank EPS terminals debuted just recently).  Also, Banco de Oro and Landbank ATM cards, unlike BPI ATM cards, cannot be directly swiped on an EPS terminal.  In order to use these cards, an EPS merchant must enter the number 7 on the main screen then swipe the card to use these ATM cards.  As of 2005, [[HSBC]] and its subsidiary, HSBC Savings Bank, although both members of Expressnet, do not participate in the EPS system, meaning that HSBC and HSBC Savings Bank ATM cards cannot be used on an EPS terminal.

In addition to functioning as an ATM EFTPOS terminal, EPS terminals also accept BPI [[credit card|credit]], [[debit card|debit]] and [[stored-value card|prepaid]] cards.  However, these transactions are considered as BPI Express Credit transactions and not as EPS transactions.

Banco de Oro has its own terminal independent of the EPS either branded under the [[SM Prime Holdings|SM]] name or under its own name.  Terminals under either name accept all Banco de Oro cards (Smarteller ATM card and derivatives, BDO Gift Card, BDO Cash Card and BDO credit cards) and have the functions of an EPS terminal.  Terminals under the SM name, however, have extended capabilities such as having the capabilities of an EPS, PayLink and BPS terminal (and even the ATM cards of non-affiliated banks) all in one as well as the acceptance of other banks' credit, debit and prepaid cards.

The terminal can be found depending on the name.  Terminals under the SM name can be found in all SM stores, such as their supermarkets, department stores and stores such as Surplus Shop and [[Toy Kingdom]].  Terminals under the Banco de Oro name can be found in businesses that accept Banco de Oro cards before Banco de Oro joined the EPS.  Some merchants though still use the Banco de Oro terminal.

FIRST also operates FIRST Place, a research facility at FIRST headquarters in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]], where it holds educational programs and day camps for students and teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/firstplace|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925072912/http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/firstplace|archivedate=2011-09-25|title=''FIRST'' Place|publisher=Usfirst.org|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
FIRST operates as a non-profit public charity corporation. It licenses qualified teams, usually affiliated with schools or other youth organizations, to participate in its competitions. The teams in turn pay a fee to FIRST; these fees, the majority of which are redistributed to pay for teams' kit of parts and other services, consist of the majority of FIRST's revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usfirst.org/uploadedFiles/Who/Leadership/BOD/FIRST_Strategic_Plan.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150314132953/http://www.usfirst.org/uploadedFiles/Who/Leadership/BOD/FIRST_Strategic_Plan.pdf|archivedate=2015-03-14|format=PDF|title=FIRST ® Five-Year Strategic Plan|publisher=Usfirst.org|access-date=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The supreme body of FIRST is its [[board of directors]], which includes corporate executives and former government officials. FIRST also has an executive advisory board and several senior advisors; these advisors include engineers, involved volunteers, and other senior organizers. Day-to-day operations are run by a [[senior management]] team, consisting of a president and five vice presidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.firstinspires.org/about/leadership|accessdate=23 October 2018|title=Leadership}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== FIRST Robotics Competition ===
{{main article|FIRST Robotics Competition}}
[[Image:Cheesy Poofs' Barrage.jpg|200px|thumb|left|"Barrage", Team 254's 2014 World Champion FRC robot]]
The first and highest-scale program developed through FIRST is the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC), which is designed to inspire [[high school]] students to become engineers by giving them real world experience working with engineers to develop a robot. The inaugural FIRST Robotics Competition was held in 1992 in the [[Manchester Memorial High School]] [[gym]]nasium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstinspires.org/about/history|title=''FIRST'' History|publisher=Usfirst.org|accessdate=14 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151203222628/http://www.firstinspires.org/about/history|archivedate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2009}}, over 3,000 high school teams totaling over 46,000 students from [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Turkey]], [[Israel]], [[Mexico]], the [[Netherlands]], the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]],&lt;ref name="ataglance"/&gt; and more compete in the annual competition.

The competition challenge changes each year, and the teams can only reuse certain components from previous years. The robots weigh at most {{convert|120|lb|1}}, without batteries and bumpers. The kit issued to each team contains a base set of parts. Registration and the kit of parts together cost about [[United States dollar|US$]]6,000. In addition to that, teams are allowed to spend another $3,500 on their robot. The purpose of this rule is to lessen the influence of money on teams' competitiveness. Details of the game have been released on the first Saturday in January (except when that Saturday falls on January 1 or 2), and the teams have been given six weeks to construct a robot that can accomplish the game's tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc/2008-competition-manual-and-related-documents|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905204004/http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc/2008-competition-manual-and-related-documents|archivedate=2015-09-05|title=2008 Competition Manual and Related Documents|publisher=Usfirst.org|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, teams participated in 48 regional and district competitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FRC Regional Event List - 2010 |url=http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc/regionalevents.aspx?id=430 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003113303/http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc/regionalevents.aspx?id=430 |dead-url=yes |archive-date= 3 October 2009 |publisher=FIRST |accessdate=31 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FRC Michigan District Events - 2010 |url=http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc/content.aspx?id=9508 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207040708/http://usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc/content.aspx?id=9508 |dead-url=yes |archive-date= 7 December 2009 |accessdate=31 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; throughout March in an effort to qualify for the [[FIRST Championship]] in St. Louis in April. Previous years' Championships have been held in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], [[Houston, Texas]] and at [[Walt Disney World Resort|Walt Disney World]]'s [[Epcot]].&lt;ref name="FIRST"&gt;{{cite web|title=FIRST Robotics Competition |work=FIRST |url=http://www.usfirst.org/robotics/ |accessdate=2006-06-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427005142/http://www.usfirst.org/robotics/ |archivedate=2006-04-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 7, 2009, FIRST announced that the Championship Event will be held in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] for 2011 through 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''FIRST'' Selects the City of St. Louis as Site of Annual Robotics Championship from 2011 Through 2013|url=http://www.usfirst.org/aboutus/content.aspx?id=15777|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606152402/http://www.usfirst.org/aboutus/content.aspx?id=15777|archivedate=2011-06-06|date=2009-10-07|accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Each year the FIRST Robotics Competition has scholarships for the participants in the program. In 2011, there were over $14 million worth of scholarships from more than 128 colleges and universities, associations, and corporations.

The district competition system was introduced in Michigan and as of 2017 has expanded to include districts in the Pacific Northwest, the Mid-Atlantic, the Washington DC area, New England, Georgia, North Carolina, Ontario, and Israel. When they were created in 2017, the Ontario and Israel districts became the first districts outside of the United States. The district competition system changed the traditional "regional" events by allowing teams to compete in multiple smaller events and using an associated ranking algorithm to determine which teams would advance to the next level of the competition. In general, there have been pushes to move more regions to the districts system; California, Texas, and New York have especially been pushed to move to the district system.

=== FIRST Tech Challenge ===
{{main article|FIRST Tech Challenge}}
[[Image:100 9640.JPG|thumb|right|150px|A 2007 FTC robot]]The FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC), formerly FIRST Vex Challenge (FVC), is a mid-level robotics competition announced by FIRST on March 22, 2005. According to FIRST, this competition was designed to be a more accessible and affordable option for schools. FIRST has also said that the FTC program was created for those of an intermediate skill level. FIRST Tech Challenge robots are approximately one-third the scale of their FRC counterparts. The FTC competition is meant to provide a transition for students from the [[FIRST LEGO League|FLL]] competition to the FRC competition. FTC was developed for the [[Vex Robotics Design System]], which is available commercially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is FVC?|url=http://www.usfirst.org/what/fvc/default.aspx?id=380|website=usfirst.org|publisher=US FIRST|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112060222/http://www.usfirst.org/what/fvc/default.aspx?id=380 |archive-date= January 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2005 FVC pilot season featured a demonstration of the FIRST Vex Challenge using a 1/3 linear scale mock-up of the 2004 FRC Competition, [[FIRST Frenzy: Raising the Bar]]. For their 2005-2006 Pilot Season, FVC teams played the [[Half-Pipe Hustle]] game using racquet balls and ramps.

For the 2006-2007 FTC Season, the FIRST Tech Challenge teams competed in the [[Hangin'-A-Round]] challenge using softballs, rotating platforms, a hanging bar, and a larger 'Atlas' ball which is significantly larger than most Vex robots and harder to manipulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to the 2006 ''FIRST'' Vex Challenge season! |url=http://www.usfirst.org/community/fvc/default.aspx? |website=usfirst.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061218155349/http://www.usfirst.org/community/fvc/default.aspx |archive-date=December 18, 2006 |publisher=FIRST |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hangin'-A-Round|url=http://www.usfirst.org/uploadedFiles/Community/FVC/FVC_Documents_and_Updates/2006_FVC_Manual_Sections_1_-_8.pdf|website=usfirst.org|publisher=FIRST|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408093053/http://www.usfirst.org/uploadedFiles/Community/FVC/FVC_Documents_and_Updates/2006_FVC_Manual_Sections_1_-_8.pdf|archive-date=April 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Competitions were held around the United States, Canada, and Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usfirst.org/community/fvc/events.aspx?id=720&amp;menu_id=84] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129101112/http://www.usfirst.org/community/fvc/events.aspx?id=720&amp;menu_id=84 |date=January 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2008-2009 FTC season, a new kit was introduced, as FIRST moved away from the VEX platform and worked with several different vendors to create a custom kit and control system for FTC known as [[Tetrix Robotics Kit|Tetrix]]. Based around the LEGO Mindstorms NXT "brain" and including secondary specialized controllers to overcome the limitations of the NXT, teams use a Bluetooth link between the NXT and a laptop running FTC driver station software. A team's drivers then use either one or two USB gamepads to control their robots.

For the 2015-2016 FTC season, in a partnership with Qualcomm, the LEGO Mindstorms NXT was replaced as the "brain" of the robot by an android device which communicates to a separate "driver station" android device via Wifi Direct. In addition, students were allowed to use either MIT App Inventor or Android Studio (Java language) to program their robots.

=== FIRST LEGO League ===
[[File:FIRST Lego League Robot.jpg|thumb|220px|'Power Puzzle' (2007) field and robot.]]
{{main article|FIRST Lego League}}
In 1998, the FIRST [[LEGO]] League (FLL), a program similar to the FIRST Robotics Competition, was formed. It is aimed at 9 to 14-year-old students and utilizes [[LEGO Mindstorms]] sets (EV3, NXT, RCX) to build palm-sized LEGO robots, which are then programmed using either the ROBOLAB software (RCX-based systems) or Mindstorms NXT or EV3 software (for NXT or EV3-based systems respectively) to autonomously compete against other teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://firstlegoleague.org/challenge/history|website=firstlegoleague.org|publisher=FIRST|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717083348/http://firstlegoleague.org/challenge/history|archive-date=July 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ROBOLAB software is based on [[National Instruments]]' [[LabVIEW]] industrial control engineering software. The combination of interchangeable LEGO parts, computer 'bricks', sensors, and the aforementioned software, provide preteens and teenagers with the capability to build simple models of real-life robotic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstlegoleague.org/mission/support|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208172730/http://www.firstlegoleague.org/mission/support|archivedate=2015-12-08|title=Support Our Mission|website=Firstlegoleague.org|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This competition also utilizes a research element that is themed with each year's game, and deals with a real-world situation for students to learn about through the season.

The simplistic nature of its games, its relatively low team startup costs, and its association with the [[Lego Group]] mean that it is the most extensive of all FIRST competitions, despite a lower profile and fewer sponsors than FIRST Tech Challenge or FIRST Robotics Competition. In 2009, 14,725 teams from 56 countries participated in local, regional, national, and international competitions, compared with around 1,600 teams in roughly 10 countries for FRC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Contracts|url=http://www.firstlegoleague.org/where-is-fll/globalcontacts.aspx|website=firstlegoleague.org|publisher=FIRST|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116031354/http://www.firstlegoleague.org/where-is-fll/globalcontacts.aspx |archive-date=January 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Past FLL Challenges|url=http://www.usfirst.org/firstlegoleague/community/fll/challenges.html|website=usfirst.org|publisher=FIRST|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322162201/http://www.usfirst.org/firstlegoleague/community/fll/challenges.html|archive-date=March 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FIRST LEGO League Jr.===
{{main article|FIRST Lego League Jr.}}
FIRST LEGO League Jr. is a variation of the FIRST LEGO League, aimed towards elementary school children, in which kids ages 5 to 8 build LEGO models dealing with that year's FLL challenge. At least one part of a model has a moving component.  The teams participate in exhibitions around the country, where they demonstrate and explain their models and research for award opportunities.

===FIRST Championship===
{{main article|FIRST Championship}}
The FIRST Championship is the annual event which celebrates the finale of all of their programs by bringing them all together for their final rounds in the same event. The FIRST Championship was split into two locations: St. Louis, Missouri and Houston, Texas in 2017 due to the rise in teams. From 2018 through 2020, the FIRST Championships will be held in Detroit, Michigan and Houston, Texas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.firstchampionship.org/welcome#block-block-151|title= Save the dates|website=firstchampionship.org|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2014 Championship, FIRST announced changes to the 2015 structure that will bring a more "[[Olympic Village]]" feeling, and involves a rearrangement of the programs around the city.

==Support==
{{expand section|date=March 2013
}}
FIRST itself is a self-supporting organization; however, individual teams typically rely on outside funding sources. It also takes significant outside funds to run regional events and the FIRST Championship. In 2010, FIRST was a recipient of a [[Google]] Project 10^100 grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/09/10-million-for-project-10100-winners.html|title=$10 million for Project 10^100 winner|publisher=Google|accessdate=11 April 2011|date=24 September 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926020623/http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/09/10-million-for-project-10100-winners.html|archivedate=26 September 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intra-team===
Teams may request that team members, whether mentors or students, contribute to the costs of running a team. For example, members may pay a fee or donate tools and facilities.

===Inter-team===
Teams frequently give other teams support. This may mean providing funds, tools, or facilities. [[Gracious professionalism]] and [[Coopertition]] are core tenets of the FIRST philosophy.

====Gracious Professionalism====
Gracious Professionalism is a major belief in the FIRST community. At every regional and national competition, the judges look for teams to be graciously professional. What gracious professionalism is all about is "competing on an even playing field". That means that each team wants their competition at the best. The way the team system is set up is that every team is matched up with two other teams per match at random. Therefore, a team's ally in one match may become an opponent in the next match. Traditionally, outside of FIRST, when one shares resources in a competition, one only does so with their allies.

However, with the element of gracious professionalism, one would share resources with their opponent as well. For example, if a team needs a part or tool to fix their robot, it is expected that any team, even an opposing team would give that team a hand in order to compete. 
This helps student learn that success is in learning and helping others no matter the circumstances. With this in mind, the judges give a Gracious Professionalism award at every FIRST Robotics Competition tournament, to a team that shows outstanding gracious professionalism.

The term "Gracious Professionalism" was created by Dr. [[Woodie Flowers]], FIRST National Advisor and Pappalardo Professor Emeritus of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usfirst.org/aboutus/gracious-professionalism|title=Gracious Professionalism|publisher=usfirst.org|accessdate=14 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027085854/http://www.usfirst.org/aboutus/gracious-professionalism|archivedate=27 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community===
The most common method of monetary and resource sponsorship teams comes through the community surrounding the team. Since the majority of teams are based around a school or a school district, schools often provide the infrastructure needed to run a team. Local governments and individual citizens may provide funds and other support to teams. Local universities and colleges often give significant funds to teams.

===Corporate===
Corporate donations and grants usually provide the majority of a mature team's funds. Major donors include [[BAE Systems]], [[Google]], [[Raytheon]], and [[National Instruments]].

===Government===
Each year during his speech at the kickoff event, founder Dean Kamen gives the student participants a homework assignment.  It often involves spreading the word about FIRST in various ways, such as increasing attendance at regionals (2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robotics.nasa.gov/first/2005/caption.htm|title=Robotics Education Project - ''FIRST'' Nationals|publisher=Robotics.nasa.gov|accessdate=14 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304084758/http://robotics.nasa.gov/first/2005/caption.htm|archivedate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; mentoring rookie teams,  making sure that FIRST-specific scholarships are applied for (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robotics.nasa.gov/first/2004/translog.htm|title=Untitled Document|publisher=Robotics.nasa.gov|accessdate=14 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124124740/http://robotics.nasa.gov/first/2004/translog.htm|archivedate=24 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and researching the capabilities of motors and disseminating that information to other teams (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robotics.nasa.gov/events/first/transcript.htm|title=Untitled Document|publisher=Robotics.nasa.gov|accessdate=14 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023953/http://robotics.nasa.gov/events/first/transcript.htm|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, Dean's homework was for each team to contact their government officials (e.g. [[mayor]]s, [[legislator]]s, [[governor]]s, federal officials) and invite them to a FIRST regional or the championship to expose them to the competition and increase the level of political awareness of FIRST. In 2008, it was to inform the media more about FIRST. In 2009, the homework was for each team to have all students, mentors, and other persons involved with their team (past or present) register with FIRST.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to our Online Community!|url=http://firstcommunity.usfirst.org/|website=usfirst.org|publisher=FIRST|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310133304/http://firstcommunity.usfirst.org/|archive-date=March 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; One goal of this registration process was to provide FIRST with data to demonstrate that many people had benefited from their experiences in FIRST robotics and to encourage more funding of robotics-related events.

At the World Championship in Atlanta, speakers have included former [[President of the United States]] [[George Herbert Walker Bush]] in 2008, and [[United States Secretary of Education]] [[Arne Duncan]] in 2010.  In 2010, former U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce and Director of the [[U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] [[Jon Dudas]] was selected to be the President of FIRST.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Havenstein|first1=Walt|last2=Kamen|first2=Dean|title=Appointment of Jon Dudas as ''FIRST'' President|url=http://usfirst.org/aboutus/content.aspx?id=17341|website=usfirst.org|publisher=FIRST|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612202826/http://usfirst.org/aboutus/content.aspx?id=17341|archive-date=June 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Championship in St. Louis, [[President of the United States]] [[Barack Obama]] has spoken via a pre-recorded message every year from 2011-2014.

FIRST has received the attention of politicians in [[Canada]] as well.

[[NASA]], through its Robotics Alliance Project, is a major supporter of FIRST.

==Philosophy==
FIRST seeks to promote a philosophy of [[teamwork]] and [[collaboration]] among engineers and encourages competing teams to remain friendly, helping each other out when necessary. Terms frequently applied to this ethos are ''Gracious Professionalism'' and ''[[Coopertition]]''; terms coined by [[Woodie Flowers]] and Kamen that support respect towards one's competitors and integrity in one's actions.&lt;ref name="GP"&gt;{{cite web | title = Gracious Professionalism | work = FIRST | url = http://www.usfirst.org/aboutus/gracious-professionalism | accessdate = 2008-01-12 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110917033055/http://www.usfirst.org/aboutus/gracious-professionalism | archivedate = 2011-09-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of Gracious Professionalism grew from a robotics class that Flowers taught at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chandler|first=David L.|title=Woodie Flowers, a pioneer of hands-on engineering education|url=http://news.mit.edu/2012/emeritus-flowers-wallace-robots-0507|accessdate=May 9, 2012|newspaper=MITnews|date=May 7, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922013132/http://news.mit.edu/2012/emeritus-flowers-wallace-robots-0507|archivedate=September 22, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coopertition is patented under US Patent 7,507,169 by Dean Kamen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/7507169.pdf|title=US Patent 7507169|format=PDF|accessdate=2010-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8337">'''''H''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;''' (i.e. "'''''H''-infinity'''") '''methods''' are used in [[control theory]] to synthesize controllers to achieve stabilization with guaranteed performance.  To use ''H''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; methods, a control designer expresses the control problem as a [[mathematical optimization]] problem and then finds the controller that solves this optimization.  ''H''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; techniques have the advantage over classical control techniques in that they are readily applicable to problems involving multivariate systems with cross-coupling between channels; disadvantages of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; techniques include the level of mathematical understanding needed to apply them successfully and the need for a reasonably good model of the system to be controlled.  It is important to keep in mind that the resulting controller is only optimal with respect to the prescribed cost function and does not necessarily represent the best controller in terms of the usual performance measures used to evaluate controllers such as settling time, energy expended, etc. Also, non-linear constraints such as saturation are generally not well-handled. These methods were introduced into control theory in the late 1970s-early 1980s
by [[George Zames]] (sensitivity minimization),&lt;ref name="Zames" /&gt; J. William Helton (broadband matching),&lt;ref name="Helton"/&gt;
and [[Allen Tannenbaum]] (gain margin optimization).&lt;ref name="Tannenbaum"/&gt;

The phrase ''H''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; ''control'' comes from the name of the mathematical space over which the optimization takes place: ''H''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''[[Hardy space]]'' of [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]-valued functions that are [[analytic function|analytic]] and bounded in the open right-half of the [[complex plane]] defined by Re(''s'')&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0; the ''H''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; norm is the maximum singular value of the function over that space.  (This can be interpreted as a maximum gain in any direction and at any frequency; for [[Single-Input and Single-Output|SISO]] systems, this is effectively the maximum magnitude of the frequency response.)  ''H''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; techniques can be used to minimize the closed loop impact of a perturbation: depending on the problem formulation, the impact will either be measured in terms of stabilization or performance.

Simultaneously optimizing robust performance and robust stabilization is difficult.  One method that comes close to achieving this is [[H-infinity loop-shaping|''H''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; loop-shaping]], which allows the control designer to apply classical loop-shaping concepts to the multivariable frequency response to get good robust performance, and then optimizes the response near the system bandwidth to achieve good robust stabilization.

Commercial software is available to support ''H''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; controller synthesis.

== Problem formulation ==

First, the process has to be represented according to the following standard configuration:

[[Image:H-infty plant representation.png]]

The plant ''P'' has two inputs, the exogenous input ''w'', that includes reference signal and disturbances, and the manipulated variables ''u''. There are two outputs, the error signals ''z'' that we want to minimize, and the measured variables ''v'', that we use to control the system. ''v'' is used in ''K'' to calculate the manipulated variables ''u''. Notice that all these are generally [[vector (geometry)|vectors]], whereas '''P''' and '''K''' are [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]].

In formulae, the system is:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} z\\ v \end{bmatrix} = \mathbf{P}(s)\, \begin{bmatrix} w\\ u\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}P_{11}(s) &amp; P_{12}(s)\\P_{21}(s) &amp; P_{22}(s)\end{bmatrix} \, \begin{bmatrix} w\\ u\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;u = \mathbf{K}(s) \, v&lt;/math&gt;

It is therefore possible to express the dependency of ''z'' on ''w'' as:

:&lt;math&gt;z=F_\ell(\mathbf{P},\mathbf{K})\,w&lt;/math&gt;

Called the ''lower linear fractional transformation'',  &lt;math&gt;F_\ell&lt;/math&gt; is defined (the subscript comes from ''lower''):

:&lt;math&gt;F_\ell(\mathbf{P},\mathbf{K}) = P_{11} + P_{12}\,\mathbf{K}\,(I-P_{22}\,\mathbf{K})^{-1}\,P_{21}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the objective of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_\infty&lt;/math&gt; control design is to find a controller &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;F_\ell(\mathbf{P},\mathbf{K})&lt;/math&gt; is minimised according to the &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_\infty&lt;/math&gt; norm. The same definition applies to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_2&lt;/math&gt; control design. The infinity norm of the [[transfer function matrix]] &lt;math&gt;F_\ell(\mathbf{P},\mathbf{K})&lt;/math&gt; is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;||F_\ell(\mathbf{P},\mathbf{K})||_\infty = \sup_\omega \bar{\sigma}(F_\ell(\mathbf{P},\mathbf{K})(j\omega))&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\bar{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum [[singular value]] of the matrix &lt;math&gt;F_\ell(\mathbf{P},\mathbf{K})(j\omega)&lt;/math&gt;.

The achievable ''H''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; norm of the closed loop system is mainly given through the matrix ''D''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; (when the system ''P'' is given in the form (''A'', ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''D''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;, ''D''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, ''D''&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;, ''D''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;)). There are several ways to come to an ''H''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; controller:
* A [[Youla-Kucera parametrization]] of the closed loop often leads to very high-order controller.
* [[Riccati equation|Riccati]]-based approaches solve 2 [[Riccati equation]]s to find the controller, but require several simplifying assumptions.
* An optimization-based reformulation of the Riccati equation uses [[Linear matrix inequality|linear matrix inequalities]] and requires fewer assumptions.

[[File:Heat and Moisture Exchanger.jpg|thumb|Heat and moisture exchanger (HME)]]

'''Heat and Moisture Exchangers''' (HME) are devices used in [[mechanical ventilation|mechanically ventilated]] patients intended to help prevent complications due to "drying of the respiratory mucosa, such as mucus plugging and endotracheal tube (ETT) occlusion."&lt;ref name=Solomita&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Solomita M, Palmer LB, Daroowalla F, etal |title=Humidification and secretion volume in mechanically ventilated patients |journal=Respir Care |volume=54 |issue=10 |pages=1329–35 |date=October 2009 |pmid=19796412 |url= http://www.rcjournal.com/contents/10.09/10.09.1329.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  HMEs are one type of commercial humidification system, which also include [[non-heated-wire humidifiers]] and [[heated-wire humidifiers]].&lt;ref name=Solomita/&gt;

HMEs have been in clinical use for over 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zuur JK, Muller SH, de Jongh FH, van Zandwijk N, Hilgers FJ |title=The physiological rationale of heat and moisture exchangers in post-laryngectomy pulmonary rehabilitation: a review |journal=Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol |volume=263 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16001247 |doi=10.1007/s00405-005-0969-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An HME cassette plays a central part of lung rehabilitation after a total [[laryngectomy]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

== In mechanically ventilated patients ==
Humidification and suctioning are necessary to manage secretions in patients on [[mechanical ventilation]].  According to Branson (2007), the optimal humidification level "has been not well defined, but it is clear that in a patient with thick and copious secretions a heated humidifier is preferred to an HME".&lt;ref name=Branson&gt;{{cite journal |author=Branson RD |title=Secretion management in the mechanically ventilated patient |journal=Respir Care |volume=52 |issue=10 |pages=1328–42; discussion 1342–7 |date=October 2007 |pmid=17894902 |url= http://www.rcjournal.com/contents/10.07/10.07.1328.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In patients with [[acute lung injury]] and [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] conventional humidifiers are preferred to HMEs for improved elimination of [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name=Rouby &gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rouby JJ, Lu Q |title=Bench-to-bedside review: adjuncts to mechanical ventilation in patients with acute lung injury |journal=Crit Care |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=465–71 |date=October 2005 |pmid=16277735 |pmc=1297606 |doi=10.1186/cc3763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In laryngectomy ==
{{main|Heat and moisture exchanger after laryngectomy}}
An HME has three purposes in [[laryngectomy]]:
# heat and moisture exchanging capacity,
# resistance, and
# filtering particles.
In the lungs a temperature of 37&amp;nbsp;°C and 100% relative humidity (RH) is the ideal condition for the [[cilium|ciliary]] activity. If the conditions are too warm or cold, the cilia beat slower and at some point not at all. During normal nasal inspiration, air of 22&amp;nbsp;°C and 40% RH is conditioned into air of 32&amp;nbsp;°C and 99% RH at the level of the trachea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ingelstedt S |title=Studies on the conditioning of air in the respiratory tract |journal=Acta Otolaryngol Suppl |volume=131 |issue= |pages=1–80 |year=1956 |pmid=13381446 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of the increased resistance (compared to [[stoma]] breathing without HME) in laryngectomy patients is poorly understood, but HMEs add a variable resistance to the airflow resistance, depending on the flow rate, though the outcomes of studies are not consistent.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

HME cassettes with an electrostatic filter are designed to enhance the protection against airborne microbes to help to reduce the transfer of viruses and bacteria. Wearing an HME cassette does not compensate for the loss of upper airway filtration of smaller particles such as bacteria and viruses; the pores of the HME filter are larger than the diameter of the infectious particles. Only larger particles are filtered by the HME.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Properties==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}
The basic components of heat and moisture exchangers are foam, paper, or a substance which acts as a condensation and absorption surface. The material is often impregnated with [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic]] salts such as calcium chloride, to enhance the water-retaining capacity. HMEs used for laryngectomees are mostly hygroscopic. HMEs can vary in size but they are designed to fit all adhesives or other attachment devices within a certain product line. HME cassettes for [[tracheotomy]] patients vary in size and are usually a bit larger than for laryngectomy patients.  Air openings are at the side or at the front of the HME.  Some designs use crossbars to prevent clothing from blocking.  Usually a rim on the lid helps to find the correct finger position for occlusion.

===Hands-free===
A hands-free HME enables laryngectomees to speak without requiring finger occlusion. The device consists of a combination of HME and an automatic speaking valve, which closes automatically, when exhaling air for speaking, enabling the pulmonary air to be diverted through the voice prosthesis into the esophagus. It reopens automatically, when exhalation decreases. Beside that the hands-free HME enables easy removal in case of coughing, or even an adjustable cough relief valve, to release the air that is built up during coughing. In some devices, speech membranes in different strengths can accommodate different speaking pressures.

==Special devices==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}
HME devices with a lower airflow resistance make them suitable for physical exercise or when adapting to the breathing resistance for patients that have not used any stoma protection before and start using an HME or have not used an HME for a longer time.

As antimicrobial filters, an HME is not considered to be an efficient barrier for microorganisms due to a relatively poor bacterial filtration capacity. Some HMEs provide an electrostatic filter for some protection from small particles and airborne microorganisms.

Attached is a power cord (right) and foot on/off switch (left). Held in the hand to show scale is a "hand-piece" detachable sharp-pointed unipolar application electrode.]] A '''hyfrecator''' is a low-powered medical apparatus used in [[electrosurgery]] on conscious patients, usually in an office setting. It is used to destroy [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] directly, and to stop [[bleeding]] during minor surgery. It works by emitting low-[[electric power|power]] high-[[frequency]] high-[[voltage]] [[alternating current|AC]] [[electricity|electrical]] pulses, via an [[electrode]] mounted on a handpiece, directly to the affected area of the body. A continuous [[electrical spark]] discharge may be drawn between probe and tissue, especially at the highest settings of power, although this is not necessary for the device to function. The amount of output power is adjustable, and the device is equipped with different tips, electrodes and [[forceps]], depending on the electrosurgical requirement. Unlike other types of electrosurgery, the hyfrecator does not employ a dispersive electrode pad that is attached to the patient in an area not being treated, and that leads back to the apparatus (sometimes loosely but not quite correctly called a "ground pad"). It is designed to work with non-grounded (insulated) patients.

The word ''hyfrecator'' is a [[portmanteau]] derived from “'''hi'''gh-'''fre'''quency eradi'''cator.'''”  It was introduced as a [[brand name]] for a device introduced in 1940 by the [[Birtcher Corporation]] of Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mcgovernhrc.wordpress.com/2010/06/ A 1950 Hyfrecator from Birtcher]&lt;/ref&gt; Birtcher also [[registered trademark|trademark registered]] the name Hyfrecator in 1939, and rights to the registered trademark were acquired by [[ConMed Corporation]] when it acquired Birtcher in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trademarks411.com/marks/71414911-hyfrecator] The trademark registration record&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1995-01-19/business/fi-21874_1_layoff-announcement] Acquisition of Bircher by ConMed.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, machines with the name ''Hyfrecator'' are sold only by ConMed Corporation. However, the word "hyfrecator" is sometimes used as a [[genericized trademark]] to refer to any dedicated non-ground-return electrosurgical apparatus, and a number of manufacturers now produce such machines, although not by this name.

== Differentiation from other types of electrosurgical equipment ==

The hyfrecator differs from other electrosurgical devices primarily in being low-powered that is not intended for cutting tissue, or for use in other than conscious patients. The reason is that the hyfrecator does not use a dispersive return pad or "patient plate" (also sometimes loosely referred to in electrosurgery as "ground pad.") It thus either passes a very low-powered current between forceps tips (bipolar output), or else passes an A.C. current between a single pointed metal electrode probe and the patient, with only the patient's self-[[capacitance]] providing a current sink (this is equivalent to considering [[displacement current]] to be the return current).

In the latter mode, the patient must sit or lie on an insulated table, much as in the case with objects to be charged electrostatically with high-voltage D.C. (as from a [[Van de Graaff generator]], for example). Stray ground paths between the patient and foreign conductors (such as a metal table leading somewhere to earth-ground) can offer another capacitative reservoir besides the patient, and burns out of the area of treatment may thus result, from current passing between patient and the earth-ground. For this reason, hyfrecation and all non-ground-pad electrosurgery is performed only on conscious patients, who would be aware of the burn and discomfort from an unwanted earth-ground path. (In types of electrosurgery which ''do'' employ a ground-pad, the ground-pad path serves as such a low resistance ground to the machine, that extraneous other ground paths become unimportant, and thus with proper precautions these methods can, and often are, used on anesthetized patients).

Because hyfrecation is always a relatively low-power modality, it can be used in some situations (such as very small [[nevus]] removal or skin tag removal) without local anaesthesia. In many other uses to destroy larger lesions, a local anesthetic injection or regional nerve block is used. The pain from hyfrecation is due to the burning of tissue, and the pain of electric current is absent, due to the high (radio) frequency which does not directly cause discharge of nerves.

Although the hyfrecator is not used primarily to cut tissue, it may be used in a secondary capacity to control bleeding, after tissue is cut by a standard surgical scalpel, or else it may be used to partly destroy superficial tissue, that is then removed by the scraping action of a curette. These are done under local anesthesia. An example of such a combination procedure is the standard method of [[electrodesiccation and curettage]] used by dermatologists to destroy skin cancers.

==Modes of use==

Hyfrecators are used in two principal modes:

*[[Desiccation]], in which electrical energy kills tissue near the probe tip by heating it past the temperature at which cells can survive. The method is called desiccation because it removes water from tissue as steam, leaving the tissue white and dead, without obviously being burned. This mode is usually employed with the probe in physical contact with the skin or lesion to be destroyed. This method is notable for causing relatively little actual destruction at the point of skin contact, but a large zone of destruction beneath the skin, as the current from the probe fans out into the tissue below the point of contact. Such effects may be deliberately employed in destruction of subcutaneous nodules, where minimal damage to the intact and normal skin surface is desired, at the same time as destruction and degeneration of a larger mass immediately beneath the skin, such as a subcutaneous wart or sebaceous gland.
*[[Fulguration]], in which a deliberate spark is generated by touching or nearly touching the sharp probe to the lesion or skin. This results in far higher temperatures at the point of contact of the spark to skin, causing very high temperatures and carbonization (eschar) of the tissue immediately at the spark-contact point, and just below it. Thus, it results in the highest effect at the point of spark contact. This is most useful for completely destroying very superficial structures, such as nevi and skin tags, which protrude above the skin surface.

==Targets of use==

*The hyfrecator has a large number of uses, such as removal of [[wart]]s (especially [http://www.jfmpc.com/text.asp?2013/2/2/141/117403 recalcitrant warts]&lt;ref&gt;Leung L. Hyfrecation for recalcitrant nongenitalwarts. ''J Fam Med Primary Care'' 2013;2:141-4.&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Hirsuties papillaris genitalis|pearly penile papules]], [[desiccation]] of [[sebaceous gland]] disorders, [[electrocautery]] of bleeding, [[epilation]], destruction of small cosmetically unwanted superficial veins, in certain types of [[plastic surgery]], and many other [[dermatology|dermatological]] tasks. It may also be instrumental in the destruction of skin [[cancer]]s such as [[basal cell carcinoma]]. For larger amounts of tissue destruction, the hyfrecator may be used in multiple sessions in the same area or point, as for example to gradually reduce the size of a large subcutaneous structure, such as a plantar wart.
*The hyfrecator is useful to control bleeding in dermatological office surgery in conscious patients, after tissue-cutting, tissue removal, or biopsy is first done mechanically, with a [[scalpel]]. See [[electrodesiccation and curettage]].
*The hyfrecator can be used in almost all fields of medicine, e.g. [[podiatry]], [[dentistry]], [[ophthalmology]], [[gynecology]], and [[veterinary medicine]].
*More recently, the hyfrecator is being used by those performing body modification services as a more precise way to brand the skin for aesthetic purposes. It allows more intricate and elaborate designs to be burned into the skin.

'''International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Safeguards''' are a system of inspection and verification of the peaceful uses of nuclear materials as part of the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT), supervised by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]].

== Department of Safeguards ==
Safeguards activities are undertaken by the Department of Safeguards, a separate department within the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]]. The Department is headed by Deputy Director General and Head of the Department of Safeguards [[Massimo Aparo]]. The mission statement of the Department of Safeguards is: "The primary role of the {Safeguard} Department is to administer and implement IAEA safeguards. It also contributes to nuclear arms control and disarmament, by responding to requests for verification and technical assistance associated with related agreements and arrangements."&lt;ref name = "DOS" /&gt; The Department is organized into operations divisions, which include the inspectors that conduct safeguards inspections in the IAEA's member states to confirm that they are living up to their NPT commitments, and support divisions, that provide the tools and services for the safeguards inspectors to complete their mission.  Safeguards inspections compare a state's nuclear program, as declared to the IAEA, to observed nuclear activities in the country. The Divisions of Operations&lt;ref name = "DOS"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iaea.org/about/organizational-structure/department-of-safeguards|title=Department of Safeguards|date=2016-07-26| work = Internationals Atomic Energy Agency | access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; are organized as follows:

• Operations A: conducting safeguards inspections in East Asia and Australasia&lt;br&gt;
• Operations B: conducting safeguards inspections in the Middle East (Southwest Asia), South Asia, Africa and the Americas; this geographic region also includes non-EU European states&lt;br&gt;
• Operations C: conducting safeguards inspection in the European Union states, Russia and Central Asia&lt;br&gt;
• Operations for verification in Iran (as stated in the 2015 [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]], known commonly as the Iranian Nuclear Deal)

== History ==
The history of the IAEA safeguards begins at the foreground of the nuclear regime to which debate over the disposal of leftover fissile material was the primary concern. Dwight Eisenhower’s [[Atoms for Peace]] speech in 1953 was the first step towards establishing regulation of nuclear activity to ensure only peaceful purposes were driving scientific development. It proposed that states with leftover fissile material contribute to an international fuel bank. The IAEA was proposed in 1954 with the mission to control the distribution and disposal of used nuclear material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iaea.org/about/overview/history|title=History|date=2016-06-08|website=www.iaea.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations of safeguards were controversial due to the idea that they would inhibit the promotion of nuclear energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roehrlich E | title = Negotiating Verification: International Diplomacy and the Evolution of Nuclear Safeguards, 1945-1972 | journal = Diplomacy and Statecraft | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–50 | date = 2018-01-17 | pmid = 30034301 | pmc = 6036423 | doi = 10.1080/09592296.2017.1420520 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, safeguards help solidify the line between using nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and creating weapons-grade material that could serve militant purposes. Though safeguards are only one part of the nuclear non-proliferation regime, they underpin inspection and verification, and provide assurance that proliferation is not occurring in states declared to be nuclear weaponized, as well as non-nuclear weapons states.&lt;ref name = "Safeguards"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iaea.org/topics/basics-of-iaea-safeguards|title=Basics of IAEA Safeguards|date=2016-06-08| work = International Atomic Energy Agency |access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treaties and agreements ==

=== Legal framework ===

Information Circular 66 (INFCIRC 66) is an agreement between the IAEA and member states that provides for the conduct of limited safeguards within the member state.  The member states identifies facilities that are made available for inspection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iaea.org/topics/safeguards-legal-framework|title=Safeguards legal framework |date=2016-06-08|website=www.iaea.org |access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons]] (NPT) opened for signature in 1968 and entered into force in 1970.  The NPT defines nuclear weapons states as the United States of America, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the People’s Republic of China, the Russian Federation, and France. The treaty requires signatories to become members of the IAEA.  Nuclear weapons states are responsible for working toward disarmament and non-nuclear weapons states must submit to IAEA safeguards. The treaty requires that non-nuclear weapons states conclude comprehensive safeguards agreements under INFCIRC 153. The NPT is the centerpiece of global efforts to prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name = "Safeguards" /&gt;

== Safeguards in Practice ==

=== Job of a Safeguards Inspector ===
Safeguards inspectors are first appointed by the IAEA’s Director General, then approved by the Board of Governors, designated by the State, and granted privileges and immunities by the member states in which they designated to perform inspections. Inspectors are responsible for conducting three verification activities which are; Design Information Verification (DIV), Inspection, and Complementary Access (CA).

Design Information Verification (DIV) entails confirmation of design features of a facility and verification of the design features to be accurate and valid. This activity is performed under the comprehensive safeguards agreement, by which all signatories adhere to the provision and regulation of safeguards.

The second activity required by comprehensive safeguards agreements is the inspection of facilities. The objective of an inspection is to verify that nuclear material is not diverted and facilities are not misused to make undeclared nuclear material.

Finally, Complementary Access (CA) is performed under the allowance of the Additional Protocol. The objective for complementary access is to confirm the absence of undeclared nuclear activities/material, answer questions, resolve inconsistencies, and confirm decommissioned status.

=== Implementation ===
[[File:IAEAinspectors.jpg|thumb|236x236px|Safeguards Inspection of a Nuclear Power Plant]]
Safeguards are implemented on an annual cycle and include four fundamental processes:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iaea.org/topics/safeguards-implementation|title=Safeguards implementation|date=2016-06-08|website=www.iaea.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# collection and evaluation of all safeguards-relevant information, 
# development of a State-specific safeguards approach, 
# planning, conduct, and evaluation of safeguards activities, and 
# drawing of safeguards conclusions.

The IAEA prepares a Safeguards Evaluation Report (SER) for each country and draws safeguards conclusions based on the information collected during inspections and through remote monitoring and information collection. Safeguards conclusions provide the international community assurance that States are complying with their agreements by following the safeguards obligations.  In some cases, the conclusion is that safeguards were not conclusive. Safeguards conclusions are documented in the annual Safeguards Implementation Report which is presented to the Board of Governors at its June meeting.

=== Assistance for states ===
The IAEA offers several useful services to member states including aide for officiating required documentation and assistance with safeguards measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iaea.org/topics/assistance-for-states|title=Assistance for States|date=2016-06-08|website=www.iaea.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7153">The '''ISO/TS 80004''' series of standards, from the [[International Organization for Standardization]], describe vocabulary for [[nanotechnology]] and its applications. These were largely motivated by health, safety and environment concerns, many of them originally elaborated by [[Eric Drexler]] in his 1985 [[Engines of Creation]] and echoed in more recent research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/health/nanotechnology/docs/ev_20110329_co04_en.pdf ISO consensus definitions relevant to nanomaterials and nanotechnologies] European Commission, 29th and 30th March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The ISO standards simply describe vocabulary or terminology by which a number of critical discussions between members of various stakeholder communities, including the public and political leaders, can begin. Drexler, in Chapter 15 of his 1985 work, explained how such consultation and the evolution of new [[social media]] and mechanisms to make objective scientific determinations regardless of political and industrial and public pressures, would be important to the evolution of the field. Nonetheless, it took a quarter-century for the ISO to agree and eventually standardize on this terminology.

Reviews of the field&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120813180046/http://www.aiche.org/uploadedFiles/Publications/CEPMagazine/051128_public.pdf Nantotechnology: A Guide to Nano-Objects] American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE), May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; often need to distinct various definitions of [[nanomaterial]]s vs. mesomaterials, nanoscale objects from [[nanostructured]] materials (including [[nanoporous]] materials), and other confused terms. The intent of the ISO standards is to remove most potential for terminology clash especially when dealing with international regulatory synchronization. The standard currently consists of 11 published parts, while more parts are under preparation which addresses [[graphene]] and quantum phenomena.

ISO/TR 18401 provides plain language explanations of selected terms from the ISO 80004 series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:tr:18401:ed-1:v1:en|title=ISO/TR 18401: Nanotechnologies — Plain language explanation of selected terms from the ISO/IEC 80004 series|last=|first=|date=2017|website=International Organization for Standardization|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only biographical information known about him is contained in his famed ''Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices''.&lt;ref name=dfmms&gt;{{cite book|title=Distinguished Figures in Mechanism and Machine Science - Part 2|editor=Marco Ceccarelli|publisher=Springer|doi=10.1007/978-90-481-2346-9|isbn=978-90-481-2345-2|date=2010|pages=1-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like his father before him, he served as chief engineer at the [[Artuklu Palace]], the residence of the [[Mardin]] branch of the [[Artuqids]] which ruled across eastern [[Anatolia]] as [[vassal state|vassals]] of the [[Zengid dynasty]] of [[Mosul]] and later of [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] general [[Saladin]].&lt;ref name=Hill2&gt;[[Donald Hill]], "Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East", ''[[Scientific American]]'', May 1991, pp. 64-9 ([[cf.]] [[Donald Hill]], [http://home.swipnet.se/islam/articles/HistoryofSciences.htm Mechanical Engineering] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225091836/http://home.swipnet.se/islam/articles/HistoryofSciences.htm |date=25 December 2007 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Jazari was part of a tradition of [[artisan]]s and was thus more a practical engineer than an inventor&lt;ref&gt;Donald R. Hill, in ''Dictionary of scientific biography'', 15, suppl. I, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; who appears to have been "more interested in the craftsmanship necessary to construct the devices than in the technology which lay behind them" and his machines were usually "assembled by [[trial and error]] rather than by theoretical calculation."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=G. R.|last=Tibbetts|title=Review: Donald R. Hill, ''The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices (Kitab fi ma'rifat al-hiyal alhandasiyya), by Ibn al-Razzaz al-Jazari''|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies|publisher=University of London|volume=38|issue=1|year=1975|pages=151–153 [152]|doi=10.1017/S0041977X00047182}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices'' appears to have been quite popular as it appears in a large number of manuscript copies, and as he explains repeatedly, he only describes devices he has built himself. According to Mayr, the book's style resembles that of a modern "do-it-yourself" book.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 32–33, ''The Origins of Feedback Control'', [[Otto Mayr]], MIT Press, 1970, {{ISBN|0-262-13067-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of his devices were inspired by earlier devices, such as one of his monumental water clocks, which was based on that of a [[Pseudo-Archimedes]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ahmad Y. al-Hassan]], [http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%206.htm al-Jazari And the History of the Water Clock] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226105147/http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%206.htm |date=26 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also cites the influence of the [[Banū Mūsā]] brothers for his fountains, [[al-Saghani]] for the design of a candle clock, and Hibatullah ibn al-Husayn (d. 1139) for musical automata. Al-Jazari goes on to describe the improvements he made to the work of his predecessors, and describes a number of devices, techniques and components that are original innovations which do not appear in the works by his precessors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The book of ingenious devices (Kitāb al-ḥiyal)|author=[[Banū Mūsā]], [[Donald Hill]]|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|year=1979|isbn=90-277-0833-9|pages=21–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms and methods==
The most significant aspect of al-Jazari's machines are the [[Mechanism (technology)|mechanisms]], components, ideas, methods, and design features which they employ.&lt;ref name=Hill2/&gt;

===Camshaft===
A [[camshaft]], a shaft to which [[cam]]s are attached, was introduced in 1206 by al-Jazari, who employed them in his [[automaton|automata]],&lt;ref name="Ifrah"&gt;Georges Ifrah (2001). ''The Universal History of Computing: From the Abacus to the Quatum Computer'', p. 171, Trans. E.F. Harding, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. (See [http://www.banffcentre.ca/bnmi/programs/archives/2005/refresh/docs/conferences/Gunalan_Nadarajan.pdf])&lt;/ref&gt; [[water clock]]s (such as the [[candle clock]])&lt;ref name="Ancient Discoveries"/&gt; and water-raising machines.&lt;ref name=Ifrah/&gt; The cam and camshaft also appeared in European mechanisms from the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lehr (1981), ''De Geschiedenis van het Astronomisch Kunstuurwerk'', p. 227, Den Haag. (See [http://odur.let.rug.nl/~koster/musicbox/musicbox2.htm odur.let.rug.nl])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crankshaft and crank-slider mechanism===
The eccentrically mounted handle of the rotary [[quern-stone]] in fifth century BCE [[Spain]] that spread across the [[Roman Empire]] constitutes a [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]].&lt;ref name="Ritti et al. 2007, 159"&gt;Tullia Ritti, Klaus Grewe, Paul Kessener: "A Relief of a Water-powered Stone Saw Mill on a Sarcophagus at Hierapolis and its Implications“, Journal of Roman Archaeology, Vol. 20 (2007), pp. 138–163 (159)&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest evidence of a crank and [[connecting rod]] mechanism dates to the 3rd century AD [[Hierapolis sawmill]] in the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="Ritti et al. 2007, 159"/&gt; The crank also appears in the mid-9th century in several of the hydraulic devices described by the [[Banū Mūsā]] brothers in their ''[[Book of Ingenious Devices]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Cambridge History of Arabic Literature|last=A. F. L. Beeston, M. J. L. Young|first=J. D. Latham, Robert Bertram Serjeant|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1990|isbn=0-521-32763-6|page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1206, al-Jazari invented an early [[crankshaft]],&lt;ref name=Ganchy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vallely/&gt; which he incorporated with a crank-connecting rod mechanism in his twin-cylinder [[pump]].&lt;ref name=Crank/&gt; Like the modern crankshaft, al-Jazari's mechanism consisted of a wheel setting several [[crankpin]]s into motion, with the wheel's motion being circular and the pins moving back-and-forth in a straight line.&lt;ref name=Ganchy&gt;{{citation|title=Islam and Science, Medicine, and Technology|last=Sally Ganchy|first=Sarah Gancher|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|year=2009|isbn=1-4358-5066-1|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crankshaft described by al-Jazari&lt;ref name="Ganchy"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vallely/&gt; transforms continuous [[Rotary engine|rotary motion]] into a linear [[Reciprocating engine|reciprocating motion]],&lt;ref name=Crank/&gt; and is central to modern machinery such as the [[steam engine]], [[internal combustion engine]] and [[automatic control]]s.&lt;ref name=Vallely&gt;Paul Vallely, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20060311/ai_n16147544 How Islamic Inventors Changed the World], ''[[The Independent]]'', 11 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hill|1998|p=231–232}}

He used the crankshaft with a connecting rod in two of his water-raising machines: the [[#Saqiya chain pumps|crank-driven saqiya chain pump]] and the [[#Double-action suction pump with valves and reciprocating piston motion|double-action reciprocating piston suction pump]].&lt;ref name=Crank&gt;[[Ahmad Y. al-Hassan]], [http://www.history-science-technology.com/Notes/Notes%203.htm The Crank-Connecting Rod System in a Continuously Rotating Machine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312021929/http://www.history-science-technology.com/Notes/Notes%203.htm |date=12 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Cambridge History of Arabic Literature|last=A.

Latham, Robert Bertram Serjeant|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1990|isbn=0-521-32763-6|pages=270–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His water pump also employed the first known [[Four-bar linkage|crank-slider]] mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=al-Jazari (1136–1206)|author=Lotfi Romdhane &amp; Saïd Zeghloul|journal=History of Mechanism and Machine Science|volume=7|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|issn=1875-3442|doi=10.1007/978-90-481-2346-9|year=2010|isbn=978-90-481-2346-9|pages=1–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design and construction methods===
English technology historian [[Donald Hill]] writes:

{{quote|text=We see for the first time in al-Jazari's work several concepts important for both design and construction: the [[lamination]] of timber to minimize warping, the [[Mechanical equilibrium|static balancing]] of wheels, the use of wooden [[stencil|templates]] (a kind of pattern), the use of [[paper model]]s to establish designs, the [[Calibrated orifice|calibration of orifices]], the grinding of the seats and plugs of valves together with [[Emery (rock)|emery]] powder to obtain a watertight fit, and the [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]] of metals in closed [[Sand casting|mold boxes]] with [[Molding sand|sand]].&lt;ref name=Hill2/&gt;}}

===Escapement mechanism in a rotating wheel===
Al-Jazari invented a method for controlling the speed of [[rotation]] of a wheel using an [[escapement]] mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Hill]], "Engineering", in Roshdi Rashed, ed., ''[[Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science]]'', Vol. 2, pp. 751–795 [792]. [[Routledge]], London and New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanical controls===
According to [[Donald Hill]], al-Jazari described several early [[Control system|mechanical controls]], including "a large metal door, a [[combination lock]] and a lock with four [[Bolted joint|bolts]]."&lt;ref name=Hill2/&gt;

===Segmental gear===
A segmental gear is "a piece for receiving or communicating [[reciprocating motion]] from or to a cogwheel, consisting of a sector of a circular [[gear]], or ring, having cogs on the periphery, or face."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Segment+gear Segment gear], [[TheFreeDictionary.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Lynn Townsend White, Jr.]] wrote:
{{quote|text=Segmental gears first clearly appear in al-Jazari, in the West they emerge in [[Giovanni Dondi dell'Orologio|Giovanni de Dondi]]'s [[astronomical clock]] finished in 1364, and only with the great [[Siena|Sienese]] engineer [[Francesco di Giorgio Martini|Francesco di Giorgio]] (1501) did they enter the general vocabulary of European machine design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finns-books.com/auto.htm The Automata of Al-Jazari]. The [[Topkapı Palace]] Museum, [[Istanbul]]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030421055019/http://www.finns-books.com/auto.htm |date=21 April 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Water-raising machines==
[[File:Al-Jazari Automata 1205.jpg|thumb|al-Jazari's [[hydropower]]ed [[#Saqiya chain pumps|saqiya chain pump]] device.]]
Al-Jazari invented five machines for raising water,&lt;ref name="Jazari"/&gt; as well as [[watermill]]s and [[water wheel]]s with [[cam]]s on their [[axle]] used to operate [[automata]],&lt;ref name=Hill/&gt; in the 12th and 13th centuries, and described them in 1206. It was in these water-raising machines that he introduced his most important ideas and components.

===Saqiya chain pumps===
The first known use of a [[crankshaft]] in a [[chain pump]] was in one of al-Jazari's [[Sakia|saqiya]] machines. The concept of minimizing [[Intermittency|intermittent working]] is also first implied in one of al-Jazari's ''[[Sakia|saqiya]]'' chain pumps, which was for the purpose of maximising the efficiency of the saqiya chain pump. Al-Jazari also constructed a water-raising saqiya chain pump which was run by [[hydropower]] rather than [[manual labour]], though the Chinese were also using hydropower for chain pumps prior to him. Saqiya machines like the ones he described have been supplying water in [[Damascus]] since the 13th century up until modern times,&lt;ref name=Hassan&gt;[[Ahmad Y. al-Hassan]], [http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%206.htm al-Jazari and the History of the Water Clock] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226105147/http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%206.htm |date=26 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and were in everyday use throughout the medieval Islamic world.&lt;ref name=Hill-776&gt;[[Donald Hill]], "Engineering", in Roshdi Rashed, ed., ''[[Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science]]'', Vol. 2, pp. 751–795 [776]. [[Routledge]], London and New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Double-action suction pump with valves and reciprocating piston motion===
Citing the Byzantine [[siphon]] used for discharging [[Greek fire]] as an inspiration,{{sfn|Hill|2013|p=150}} al-Jazari went on to describe the first [[suction]] pipes, suction [[pump]], [[Single- and double-acting cylinders#Double-acting|double-action]] pump, and made early uses of valves and a [[crankshaft]]-[[connecting rod]] mechanism, when he invented a [[Straight-twin engine|twin-cylinder]] [[Reciprocating engine|reciprocating]] [[piston]] suction pump. This pump is driven by a water wheel, which drives, through a system of gears, an oscillating slot-rod to which the rods of two pistons are attached. The pistons work in horizontally opposed cylinders, each provided with valve-operated suction and delivery pipes. The delivery pipes are joined above the centre of the machine to form a single outlet into the irrigation system. This water-raising machine had a direct significance for the development of modern engineering. This pump is remarkable for three reasons:&lt;ref name=Hill2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=[[Ahmad Y. al-Hassan]] |title=The Origin of the Suction Pump: al-Jazari 1206 A.D. |url=http://www.history-science-technology.com/Notes/Notes%202.htm |accessdate=16 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226102543/http://www.history-science-technology.com/Notes/Notes%202.htm |archivedate=26 February 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hill|2013|pp=143}}{{sfn|Hill|2013|p=150-2}}
*The first known use of a true suction pipe (which sucks fluids into a partial [[vacuum]]) in a pump.
*The first application of the double-acting principle.
*The conversion of [[rotary engine|rotary]] to [[reciprocating motion]] via the crank-connecting rod mechanism.

Al-Jazari's suction piston pump could lift 13.6 metres of water,{{Citation needed|reason=Water can only be sucked 10 meters at atmospheric pressure, equal to 760 mm Hg.|date=November 2010}} with the help of delivery pipes. This was more advanced than the suction pumps that appeared in 15th-century Europe, which lacked delivery pipes. It was not, however, any more efficient than the [[noria]] commonly used by the Muslim world at the time.{{sfn|Hill|2013}}

===Water supply system===
al-Jazari developed the earliest [[Water supply network|water supply system]] to be driven by [[gear]]s and [[hydropower]], which was built in 13th century [[Damascus]] to supply water to its mosques and [[Bimaristan]] hospitals. The system had water from a lake turn a [[Scoop wheel|scoop-wheel]] and a system of gears which transported jars of water up to a [[Canal|water channel]] that led to mosques and hospitals in the city.&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;Howard R. Turner (1997), ''Science in Medieval Islam: An Illustrated Introduction'', p. 81, [[University of Texas Press]], {{ISBN|0-292-78149-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Automata==
Al-Jazari built automated moving peacocks driven by hydropower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-301961/al-Jazari al-Jazari (Islamic artist)], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He also invented the earliest known automatic gates, which were driven by hydropower,&lt;ref name=Turner/&gt; created automatic doors as part of one of his elaborate [[water clock]]s,&lt;ref name=Hill2/&gt; and invented [[water wheel]]s with [[cam]]s on their [[axle]] used to operate automata.&lt;ref name=Hill/&gt; According to ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', the [[Italian Renaissance]] inventor [[Leonardo da Vinci]] may have been influenced by the classic automata of al-Jazari.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=al-Jazari|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|year= 2009|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/301961/al-Jazari|accessdate=4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark E. Rosheim summarizes the advances in [[robotics]] made by Muslim engineers, especially al-Jazari, as follows:

{{quote|text=Unlike the Greek designs, these Arab examples reveal an interest, not only in dramatic illusion, but in manipulating the environment for human comfort. Thus, the greatest contribution the Arabs made, besides preserving, disseminating and building on the work of the Greeks, was the concept of practical application. This was the key element that was missing in Greek robotic science.&lt;ref name=Rosheim/&gt;}}

{{quote|text=The Arabs, on the other hand, displayed an interest in creating human-like machines for practical purposes but lacked, like other preindustrial societies, any real impetus to pursue their robotic science.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Robot Evolution: The Development of Anthrobotics|first=Mark E.|last=Rosheim|year=1994|publisher=Wiley-IEEE|isbn=0-471-02622-0|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Drink-serving waitress===
One of al-Jazari's [[Humanoid robot|humanoid automata]] was a waitress that could serve water, tea or drinks. The drink was stored in a tank with a reservoir from where the drink drips into a bucket and, after seven minutes, into a cup, after which the waitress appears out of an automatic door serving the drink.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Ancient Discoveries, Episode 12: Machines of the East|publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2HcjanNWFM|accessdate=6 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hand-washing automaton with flush mechanism===
Al-Jazari invented a hand washing [[automaton]] incorporating a flush mechanism now used in modern [[flush toilet]]s. It features a female [[humanoid robot|humanoid automaton]] standing by a basin filled with water. When the user pulls the lever, the water drains and the female automaton refills the basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Robot Evolution: The Development of Anthrobotics|first=Mark E.|last=Rosheim|year=1994|publisher=Wiley-IEEE|isbn=0-471-02622-0|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peacock fountain with automated servants===
Al-Jazari's "peacock fountain" was a more sophisticated hand washing device featuring humanoid automata as servants which offer soap and [[towel]]s. Mark E. Rosheim describes it as follows:&lt;ref name=Rosheim&gt;{{citation|title=Robot Evolution: The Development of Anthrobotics|first=Mark E.|last=Rosheim|year=1994|publisher=Wiley-IEEE|isbn=0-471-02622-0|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=Pulling a plug on the peacock's tail releases water out of the beak; as the dirty water from the basin fills the hollow base a float rises and actuates a [[Linkage (mechanical)|linkage]] which makes a servant figure appear from behind a door under the peacock and offer soap. When more water is used, a second float at a higher level trips and causes the appearance of a second servant figure – with a towel!}}

===Musical robot band===
[[File:Al-jazari robots.jpg|thumb|right|Al-Jazari's musical [[robot]] band.]]

Al-Jazari's work described fountains and musical automata, in which the flow of water alternated from one large tank to another at hourly or half-hourly intervals. This operation was achieved through his innovative use of [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] switching.&lt;ref name=Hill2/&gt;

Al-Jazari created a musical automaton, which was a boat with four automatic musicians that floated on a lake to entertain guests at royal drinking parties. Professor [[Noel Sharkey]] has argued that it is quite likely that it was an early [[Program (machine)|programmable]] automata and has produced a possible reconstruction of the mechanism; it has a programmable drum machine with [[Wiktionary:peg|pegs]] ([[cam]]s) that bump into little [[lever]]s that operated the percussion. The drummer could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns if the pegs were moved around.&lt;ref name=Sharkey&gt;Professor Noel Sharkey, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070629182810/http://www.shef.ac.uk/marcoms/eview/articles58/robot.html A 13th Century Programmable Robot (Archive)], [[University of Sheffield]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clocks==
Al-Jazari constructed a variety of [[water clock]]s and [[candle clock]]s. These included a portable water-powered [[scribe]] [[clock]], which was a meter high and half a meter wide, reconstructed successfully at the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] in 1976&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;[[Donald Hill]] (1996), ''A History of Engineering in Classical and Medieval Times'', [[Routledge]], p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Razzaz Al-Jazari 1974"&gt;Ibn al-Razzaz Al-Jazari (ed. 1974) ''The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices'', Translated and annotated by [[Donald Hill]], Dordrecht / D. Reidel, part II.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Jazari also invented monumental water-powered [[astronomical clock]]s which displayed moving models of the Sun, Moon, and stars.

===Candle clocks===
[[File:Al-Jazari - A Candle Clock.jpg|thumb|One of al-Jazari's [[#Candle clocks|candle clocks]].]]
According to [[Donald Hill]], al-Jazari described the most sophisticated [[candle clock]]s known to date. Hill described one of al-Jazari's candle clocks as follows:&lt;ref name=Hill2/&gt;

{{quote|text=The candle, whose rate of burning was known, bore against the underside of the cap, and its wick passed through the hole. Wax collected in the indentation and could be removed periodically so that it did not interfere with steady burning. The bottom of the candle rested in a shallow dish that had a ring on its side connected through pulleys to a counterweight. As the candle burned away, the weight pushed it upward at a constant speed. The automata were operated from the dish at the bottom of the candle. No other candle clocks of this sophistication are known.}}

Al-Jazari's candle clock also included a [[Dial (measurement)|dial]] to display the time and, for the first time, employed a [[Bayonet mount|bayonet fitting]], a [[Fastener|fastening mechanism]] still used in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Ancient Discoveries, Episode 12: Machines of the East|publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwGfw1YW9Js|accessdate=7 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elephant clock===
{{Main|Elephant clock}}

The [[elephant clock]] described by al-Jazari in 1206 is notable for several innovations. It was the first clock in which an [[automaton]] reacted after certain intervals of time (in this case, a humanoid robot striking the [[cymbal]] and a mechanical robotic bird chirping) and the first [[water clock]] to accurately record the passage of the temporal hours to match the uneven length of days throughout the year.{{sfn|Hill|1992|pp=57–59}}

[[File:Clock of al Jazari before 1206.jpg|thumb|Automatic [[castle clock]] of al-Jazari, 14th century copy.]]

===Castle clock===
{{See|Clock tower}}

Al-Jazari's largest astronomical clock was the "castle clock", which was a complex device that was about {{convert|11|ft|m}} high, and had multiple functions besides timekeeping. It included a display of the [[zodiac]] and the [[heliocentric orbit|solar]] and [[lunar orbit]]s, and an innovative feature of the device was a pointer in the shape of the [[Lunar phase|crescent moon]] which travelled across the top of a gateway, moved by a hidden cart, and caused automatic doors to open, each revealing a [[mannequin]], every hour.&lt;ref name=Hill2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard R. Turner (1997), ''Science in Medieval Islam: An Illustrated Introduction'', p. 184. [[University of Texas Press]], {{ISBN|0-292-78149-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another innovative feature was the ability to reprogram the length of [[day]] and night in order to account for their changes throughout the year.

Another feature of the device was five [[automaton|automata]] musicians who automatically play music when moved by [[lever]]s operated by a hidden [[camshaft]] attached to a [[water wheel]].&lt;ref name="Ancient Discoveries"&gt;{{citation|title=Ancient Discoveries, Episode 11: Ancient Robots|publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pGXL5OKGqs|accessdate=6 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other components of the castle clock included a main reservoir with a float, a [[float chamber]] and [[Regulator (automatic control)|flow regulator]], plate and [[valve]] trough, two [[pulley]]s, crescent disc displaying the zodiac, and two falcon automata dropping balls into [[vase]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=[[Salim Al-Hassani]]|title=How it Works: Mechanism of the Castle Clock|url=http://muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=901|publisher=FSTC|date=13 March 2008|accessdate=6 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Jazari's castle clock is considered to be the earliest [[Computer programming|programmable]] [[analog computer]].&lt;ref name="Ancient Discoveries"/&gt;

===Weight-driven water clocks===
Al-Jazari invented [[water clock]]s that were driven by both water and [[maintaining power|weights]]. These included [[gear]]ed clocks and a portable water-powered [[scribe]] clock, which was a meter high and half a meter wide. The scribe with his [[pen]] was synonymous to the [[clock face|hour hand]] of a modern clock.&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Razzaz Al-Jazari 1974" /&gt; Al-Jazari's famous water-powered scribe clock was reconstructed successfully at the [[Science Museum, London]] in 1976.

==Miniature paintings==
Alongside his accomplishments as an inventor and engineer, al-Jazari was also an accomplished artist. In ''The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices'', he gave instructions of his inventions and illustrated them using [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]] paintings, a medieval style of [[Islamic art]].

'''LTE Advanced''' is a mobile communication standard and a major enhancement of the [[LTE (telecommunication)|Long Term Evolution]] (LTE) standard. It was formally submitted as a candidate [[4G]] to [[ITU-T]] in late 2009 as meeting the requirements of the [[IMT-Advanced]] standard, and was standardized by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project ([[3GPP]]) in March 2011 as 3GPP Release 10.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Parkvall, Erik Dahlman, Anders Furuskär et al.; Ericsson, Robert Syputa, Maravedis; [http://www.itu.int/ITU-R/information/promotion/e-flash/2/article4.html ITU global standard for international mobile telecommunications ´IMT-Advanced´][http://www.ericsson.com/res/thecompany/docs/journal_conference_papers/wireless_access/VTC08F_jading.pdf ''LTE Advanced - Evolving LTE towards IMT-Advanced'']; Vehicular Technology Conference, 2008. VTC 2008-Fall. IEEE 68th 21-24 Sept. 2008 Page(s):1 - 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] format was first proposed by [[NTT DoCoMo]] of [[Japan]] and has been adopted as the international standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asahi.com/english/TKY201101030115.html Faster cell phone services planned]&lt;/ref&gt; LTE standardization has matured to a state where changes in the specification are limited to corrections and [[bug fix]]es. The first commercial services were launched in [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] in December 2009&lt;ref name=TeliaSonera&gt;{{cite web|title=TeliaSonera launches world's first 4G mobile network|url=http://swedishwire.com/business/2050-telia-launch-worlds-first-4g-mobile-network|publisher=swedishwire|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the United States and Japan in 2010. More LTE networks were deployed globally during 2010 as a natural evolution of several 2G and 3G systems, including [[Global system for mobile communications]] (GSM) and [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System]] (UMTS) in the [[3GPP]] family as well as [[CDMA2000]] in the [[3GPP2]] family.

The work by [[3GPP]] to define a [[4G]] candidate radio interface technology started in Release 9 with the study phase for LTE-Advanced. Being described as a [[3.9G]] (beyond 3G but pre-4G), the first release of LTE did not meet the requirements for [[4G]] (also called [[IMT Advanced]] as defined by the [[International Telecommunication Union]]) such as peak data rates up to 1&amp;nbsp;[[Gbit/s|Gb/s]]. The ITU has invited the submission of candidate Radio Interface Technologies (RITs) following their requirements in a circular letter, 3GPP Technical Report (TR) 36.913, "Requirements for Further Advancements for [[E-UTRA]] (LTE-Advanced)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/36913.htm "Requirements for further advancements for Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) (LTE-Advanced)"]&lt;/ref&gt; These are based on ITU's requirements for [[4G]] and on operators’ own requirements for advanced LTE.
Major technical considerations include the following:
*Continual improvement to the LTE radio technology and architecture
*Scenarios and performance requirements for working with legacy radio technologies
*Backward compatibility of LTE-Advanced with LTE. An LTE terminal should be able to work in an LTE-Advanced network and vice versa. Any exceptions will be considered by [[3GPP]].
*Consideration of recent [[World Radiocommunication Conference]] (WRC-07) decisions regarding frequency bands to ensure that LTE-Advanced accommodates the geographically available spectrum for channels above 20&amp;nbsp;MHz. Also, specifications must recognize those parts of the world in which wideband channels are not available.

Likewise, 'WiMAX 2', 802.16m, has been approved by ITU as the [[IMT Advanced]] family. WiMAX 2 is designed to be backward compatible with WiMAX 1 devices. Most vendors now support conversion of 'pre-4G', pre-advanced versions and some support software upgrades of base station equipment from 3G.

The mobile communication industry and standards organizations have therefore started work on 4G access technologies, such as LTE Advanced.{{when|date=December 2016}} At a workshop in April 2008 in China, 3GPP agreed the plans for work on Long Term Evolution (LTE).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.3gpp.org/news/2008_04_LTE_A.htm |title=Beyond 3G: “LTE Advanced” Workshop, Shenzhen, China&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2008-09-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913121342/http://www.3gpp.org/news/2008_04_LTE_A.htm |archive-date=2008-09-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A first set of specifications were approved in June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/36913.htm 3GPP specification: Requirements for further advancements for E-UTRA (LTE Advanced)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the peak data rate 1&amp;nbsp;[[Gbit/s|Gb/s]] as defined by the ITU-R, it also targets faster switching between power states and improved performance at the cell edge. Detailed proposals are being studied within the [[working group]]s.{{when|date=December 2016}}

== Proposals ==
The target of 3GPP LTE Advanced is to reach and surpass the [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] requirements. LTE Advanced should be compatible with first release LTE equipment, and should share frequency bands with first release LTE. In the feasibility study for LTE Advanced, [[3GPP]] determined that LTE Advanced would meet the [[ITU-R]] requirements for [[4G]]. The results of the study are published in [[3GPP]] Technical Report (TR) 36.912.&lt;ref&gt;Agilent {{cite web |url=http://cp.literature.agilent.com/litweb/pdf/5990-6706EN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303201709/http://cp.literature.agilent.com/litweb/pdf/5990-6706EN.pdf |archivedate=2011-03-03 |df= }}, ''Introducing LTE-Advanced'', pg. 6 , March 8, 2011, accessed July 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the important LTE Advanced benefits is the ability to take advantage of advanced topology networks; optimized heterogeneous networks with a mix of macrocells with low power nodes such as [[picocell]]s, [[femtocell]]s and new relay nodes. The next significant performance leap in wireless networks will come from making the most of topology, and brings the network closer to the user by adding many of these low power nodes&amp;nbsp;— LTE Advanced further improves the capacity and coverage, and ensures user fairness. LTE Advanced also introduces multicarrier to be able to use ultra wide bandwidth, up to 100&amp;nbsp;MHz of spectrum supporting very high data rates.

In the research phase many proposals have been studied as candidates for LTE Advanced (LTE-A) technologies. The proposals could roughly be categorized into:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nomor.de/home/technology/white-papers/progress-on-lte-advanced---the-future-4g-standard Nomor Research: White Paper on LTE Advanced]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Support for relay node base stations
* Coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission and reception
* UE Dual TX antenna solutions for [[SU-MIMO]] and diversity [[MIMO]], commonly referred to as 2x2 MIMO
* Scalable system [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] exceeding 20&amp;nbsp;MHz, up to 100&amp;nbsp;MHz
* Carrier aggregation of contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum allocations
* Local area optimization of [[air interface]]
* Nomadic / Local Area network and mobility solutions
* Flexible [[Spectrum efficiency|spectrum usage]]
* [[Cognitive radio]]
* Automatic and autonomous network configuration and operation
* Support of autonomous network and device test, measurement tied to network management and optimization
* Enhanced [[precoding]] and [[forward error correction]]
* Interference management and suppression
* Asymmetric bandwidth assignment for [[Frequency-division duplex#Frequency-division duplexing|FDD]]
* Hybrid [[OFDMA]] and [[SC-FDMA]] in uplink
* UL/DL inter [[Node B|eNB]] coordinated MIMO
* [[Self-organizing network|SONs]], Self Organizing Networks methodologies

Within the range of system development, LTE-Advanced and WiMAX 2 can use up to 8x8 [[MIMO]] and 128-[[QAM]] in downlink direction. Example performance: 100&amp;nbsp;MHz aggregated bandwidth, LTE-Advanced provides almost 3.3&amp;nbsp;Gbit peak download rates per sector of the base station under ideal conditions. Advanced network architectures combined with distributed and collaborative smart antenna technologies provide several years road map of commercial enhancements.

The [[3GPP]] standards Release 12 added support for 256-QAM.

A summary of a study carried out in 3GPP can be found in TR36.912.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/36912.htm 3GPP Technical Report: Feasibility study for Further Advancements for [[E-UTRA]] (LTE Advanced)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Timeframe and introduction of additional features ==
Original standardization work for LTE-Advanced was done as part of 3GPP Release 10, which was frozen in April 2011. Trials were based on pre-release equipment. Major vendors support software upgrades to later versions and ongoing improvements.

In order to improve the quality of service for users in hotspots and on cell edges, heterogenous networks (HetNet) are formed of a mixture of macro-, pico- and femto base stations serving corresponding-size areas. Frozen in December 2012, 3GPP Release 11&lt;ref&gt;[http://rohde-schwarz.com/appnote/1MA232.html Introduction to LTE-Advanced Rel.11]&lt;/ref&gt; concentrates on better support of HetNet. Coordinated Multi-Point operation (CoMP) is a key feature of Release 11 in order to support such network structures. Whereas users located at a cell edge in homogenous networks suffer from decreasing signal strength compounded by neighbor cell interference, CoMP is designed to enable use of a neighboring cell to also transmit the same signal as the serving cell, enhancing quality of service on the perimeter of a serving cell. In-device Co-existence (IDC) is another topic addressed in Release 11. IDC features are designed to ameliorate disturbances within the user equipment caused between LTE/LTE-A and the various other radio subsystems such as WiFi, Bluetooth, and the GPS receiver. Further enhancements for MIMO such as 4x4 configuration for the uplink were standardized.

The higher number of cells in HetNet results in user equipment changing the serving cell more frequently when in motion.
The ongoing work on LTE-Advanced&lt;ref&gt;[http://3gpp.org/news-events.html 3GPP News &amp; Events, Dec.12th, 2012 and Apr.8th, 2013 entries]&lt;/ref&gt; in Release 12, amongst other areas, concentrates on addressing issues that come about when users move through HetNet, such as frequent hand-overs between cells. It also included use of 256-QAM.

== First technology demonstrations and field trials ==
This list covers technology demonstrations and field trials up to the year 2014, paving the way for a wider commercial deployment of the VoLTE technology worldwide. From 2014 onwards various further operators trialled and demonstrated the technology for future deployment on their respective networks. These are not covered here.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4498">'''Membrane roofing''' is a type of [[roof|roofing system]] for buildings and tanks. It is used to move water off the roof. Membrane roofs are most commonly made from [[synthetic rubber]], [[thermoplastic]] (PVC or similar material), or modified [[bitumen]]. Membrane roofs are most commonly used in commercial application, though they are becoming increasingly common in residential application.&lt;ref name="flatroof"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.askthebuilder.com/B200_Membrane_Roofing_for_Flat_Roofs_.shtml |title=Membrane Roofing For Flat Roofs |accessdate=2007-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
'''Synthetic Rubber (Thermoset''') – This type of membrane roof is made of large, flat pieces of synthetic rubber or similar materials. These pieces are bonded together at the seams to form one continuous membrane. The finished roof’s thickness is usually between 30 and 60 mils(thousandths of an inch) (0.75 mm to 1.50 mm). The most commonly used thermoset membrane is [[EPDM rubber|EDPM]]. Other types of related materials are CSPE, CR, and ECR.&lt;ref name="rooftype"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.askthebuilder.com/B200_Membrane_Roofing_Types.shtml |title=Membrane Roofing Types |accessdate=2007-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thermosets are widely used roofing materials due to their ability to withstand damaging effects of sun-rays and chemicals found on roofs. 

'''Thermoplastic Membrane''' – This is similar to synthetic rubber, but the seams are typically heat-fused (welded) to form a continuous membrane. The 'lap' seams can also be fused with solvents instead of heat, and can be as strong as the rest of the membrane. Other related materials are CPA, CPE, EIP, NBP, PIB, and TPO.&lt;ref name="rooftype" /&gt; Thermoplastic membranes include a reinforcement layer that provides more strength and stability. The most common thermoplastic membranes are PVC (polyvinyl chloride) and TPO (thermoplastic polyolefin).

'''Modified Bitumen''' – This type of roofing is an evolution of asphalt roofing. It is made from asphalt and a variety of rubber modifiers and [[solvent]]s. There are several ways of connecting pieces of this material. In a heat application process the seams are heated to melt the asphalt together and create a seal. There is also hot-mopped application, similar to how conventional built-up roofs are installed. Cold-applied adhesives and self-adhesive membranes are two of the more recent options. This material is also referred to as APP, SBS, and SEBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roofcoatings.org/pdf/tn04.pdf |title= Roof Coatings |accessdate=2007-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages Over Asphalt Flat Roofing Systems==
	These three application types of membrane roofing show distinct advantages over the previously more common flat roofing method of asphalt and gravel. In asphalt and gravel application, it can be very difficult to create a proper seal at all seams and connection points. This can cause a roof to leak early in its lifespan, and require much more maintenance. When installed correctly, newer materials are either seamless, or have seams as strong as the body. This eliminates most of the leakage concerns associated with flat roofing systems. 

	Repairs for asphalt and gravel roofs can be problematic, largely because it is difficult to locate the exact point of a leak. Newer systems can be patched relatively easily because breaks and leaks are easier to locate. 

	Originally asphalt roofing required a layer of gravel above it for two reasons. First, asphalt with direct exposure to sunlight degrades much faster, mainly due to the expansion and contraction throughout a day, and also the damage created by [[Ultraviolet|UV]] rays. Secondly, asphalt needs weight above to hold it down, because it sits on the top of a building, instead of being attached to it. Each of the three newer types of membrane roofing systems contain materials that resist expansion and contraction, as well as reflect much of the UV rays. Also, because these membranes either lack seams or have strong seams, what expansion and contraction does occur does not create leaks and breaks at these seams. These newer roofing systems are also attached directly to the top of a building, which eliminates the need for excess weight above.&lt;ref name="flatroof" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rooftype" /&gt;

'''Methyl nitrate'''  is the methyl [[ester]] of [[nitric acid]] and has the [[chemical formula]] CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is a colourless volatile liquid that is explosive.

==Synthesis==
It can be produced by the [[Condensation reaction|condensation]] of [[nitric acid]] and [[methanol]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{ OrgSynth | author = Black, A. P.; Babers, F. H. | year = 1939 | title = Methyl nitrate | volume = 19| pages = 64 | collvol = 2 | collvolpages = 412 | prep = CV2P0412 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH + HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; →  CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Methyl nitrate can be produced on a laboratory or industrial scale either through the [[distillation]] of a mixture of methanol and nitric acid, or by the [[nitration]] of methanol by a mixture of [[Sulfuric acid|sulfuric]] and nitric acids.  The first procedure is not preferred due to the great explosion danger presented by the methyl nitrate [[vapour]].  The second procedure is essentially identical to that of making [[nitroglycerin]].  However, the process is usually run at a slightly higher temperature and the mixture is stirred mechanically on an industrial scale instead of with compressed air.

==Explosive properties==
Methyl nitrate is a sensitive [[explosive]]. When ignited it burns extremely fiercely with a gray-blue flame. Methyl nitrate is a very strong explosive, like Nitroglycerin, Ethylene glycol dinitrate, including other nitrate esters. The sensitivity of methyl nitrate to initiation by [[detonation]] is among the greatest known, with even a number one [[blasting cap]], the lowest power available, producing a near full detonation of the explosive.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Despite the superior explosive properties of methyl nitrate, it has not received application as an explosive due mostly to its high [[volatility (chemistry)|volatility]], which prevents it from being stored or handled safely.  It was used as a rocket fuel by Germany in [[World War II]], in a mixture containing 25% methanol, which was named "myrol".  This mixture would [[Evaporation|evaporate]] at a constant rate and so its composition would  not change over time. It presents a slight explosive danger (it is somewhat difficult to detonate) and does not detonate easily via shock.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Safety==
As well as being an explosive, methyl nitrate is [[toxic]] and causes headaches when inhaled.

==Raw image format==
The following Coolpix cameras support [[raw image format|raw]] image files: 
* 5000 (discontinued) - NEF format
* 8700 (discontinued) - NEF format (with firmware upgrade)
* P6000 (discontinued) – NRW format
* P7000 (discontinued), P7100 – NRW format

Some Coolpix cameras which are not advertised as supporting a raw file format can produce usable raw files if switched to a maintenance mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e2500.narod.ru/raw_format_e.htm |title=Nikon Coolpix 2500. Camera research. RAW format |publisher=E2500.narod.ru |date= |accessdate=2010-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Note that switching to this mode can invalidate a camera's guarantee. Nikon models with this capability: E700, E800, E880, E900, E950, E990, E995, E2100, E2500, E3700, E4300, E4500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nikonimaging.com/global/products/digitalcamera/coolpix/ | publisher = Nikon Imaging | title = Digital Compact Cameras (Coolpix Series) | work = Product Line-up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38855">'''One Touch Make Ready''' (also known as '''One Touch''', and often abbreviated as '''OTMR''') is the various [[statutes]] and [[local ordinances]] passed by various [[Local government in the United States|local governments]] and utilities in the [[United States]], which require the owners of [[utility pole]]s to allow a single construction crew to make changes to multiple utility wires.&lt;ref name="OneTouch1"&gt;{{cite web | URL = https://medium.com/fiber-on-fire/in-depth-on-pole-attachments-one-touch-make-ready-and-what-s-going-on-in-louisville-3f13da86a50d | title = In Depth on Pole attachments, "One Touch Make Ready" and what's going on in Louisville | publisher = Fiber Broadband Association | date = March 16, 2016 | access-date = August 17, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect==
[[File:Utility pole 1637574.jpg|thumb|Standard utility pole in the United States.|140px]]
===Background===
Across the United States, utility poles in a given area may be owned by the local government, a [[Municipal utility district|municipal electric company]], a private entity, or any combination of the three. In most cases, the poles are owned by a private entity, like a local incumbent phone company or electric company.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet"&gt;{{cite web | URL = http://nextcenturycities.org/2017/02/01/one-touch-make-ready-fact-sheet/ | title = OTMR Fact Sheet | publisher = Next Century Cities | date = February 1, 2017 | access-date = August 17, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
====Make Ready Work====
Before an Internet Service Provider (or any company) can add a new attachment or line to a [[utility pole]], the existing attachments may need to be moved around so that the pole can be made ready to handle a new attachment or line.  This is known as 'Make Ready work.'  The reason Make Ready work is necessary is that, under Federal Law, to prevent the risk of outages or other issues, lines on utility poles must be spaced a certain distance apart from each other based on how many lines are on the pole.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet"/&gt;  

Under federal guidelines, Make Ready Work must occur sequentially, meaning that attachments can only be moved in the order with which they were originally placed on the line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | URL = https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/47/1.1420 | title = 47 CFR 1.1420 - Timeline for access to utility poles. | publisher = [[Cornell Law School]] | work = Legal Information Institute | author = Federal Communications Commission | access-date = August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This process can create massive delays, as well as other large disruptions in high traffic areas, such as alongside major roadways.  In addition, the make ready work can take months, or even years, to complete as every company involved must send out their own approved contractor to move only their respective attachment.  Each contractor must also schedule their work to not conflict with other contractors performing Make Ready Work, as well as taking into account other local factors, such as weather, traffic, and maintenance work (such as road paving).  These factors must be considered as the United States primarily uses [[aerial work platforms]] to perform Make Ready Work.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet"/&gt;

===One Touch Make Ready===
To rectify these issues, several local governments have passed One Touch Make Ready legislation.  While specific portions of the statutes vary, all carry a unifying theme that under these laws, certified construction crews chosen either by the pole owners or local governments are allowed to make all the necessary changes to a utility pole to make it ready for a new attachment.&lt;ref name="OneTouch1"/&gt;

In a location which has adopted one touch make-ready, companies that own utility poles must agree on one or more common contractors that have permission to move existing attachments on a pole, allowing a single crew to move all attachments on a pole on a single visit, rather than sending in a unique crew to move each attachment sequentially.&lt;ref name="OneTouch2"&gt;{{Cite web | URL = http://nextcenturycities.org/2016/01/06/one-touch-make-ready-policies-the-dig-once-of-pole-attachments/ | title = “One Touch” Make-Ready Policies: The “Dig Once” of Pole Attachments | publisher = Next Century Cities | date = January 6, 2016 | access-date = August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differences between localities===

====Nashville====
[[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville's]] OTMR ordinance is unique in that it includes a clause which requires a company wishing to install a new line (henceforth referred to as Company A), after having reached an agreement with the pole's owner, to give every company already on the pole 30 days notice to move their equipment. If those companies do not comply after 30 days, then Company A can perform the complex make-ready work. If there are any errors or problems from Company A's make-ready work, then the companies already on the pole can recoup expenses from Company A.&lt;ref name="ISR1"/&gt;

==Implementation in various areas==
As of August 2017, only three cities in the United States have One Touch Make Ready statutes: [[Louisville, Kentucky]]; [[Nashville, Tennessee]]; and [[San Antonio, Texas]].  Numerous other cities are in various stages along the process of implementing the One Touch Make Ready system.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet"/&gt;

===Louisville, Kentucky===
On February 11, 2016, the [[Louisville Metro Council|City Council]] of [[Louisville, Kentucky]] voted 23-0 to adopt a One Touch Make-Ready Statute, making it the first city in the country to adopt such legislation.  According to city councilman Bill Hollander, who sponsored the legislation "This will help businesses locate here and grow here.  It will create jobs, and will retain and attract our young people and make Louisville broadband ready."  These sentiments were echoed by Louisville Mayor [[Greg Fischer]], who stated that it would help lay the groundwork for entities like [[Google Fiber]], and said "Tonight's vote puts Louisville one step closer toward becoming a Google Fiber city."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | URL = http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/metro-government/2016/02/11/google-fiber-measure-passed-over-objections/80227296/ | title = Google Fiber Measure passed over objections | publisher = The Courier Journal | first = Phillip | last = Bailey| date = February 11, 2016 | access-date = August 17, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The legislation states that an applicant for attachment must first receive approval from the existing pole owners, at which point it may contract a pre-approved construction crew to perform all make ready work at its own expense. Pole owners and pre-existing providers whose wires were moved may choose to do post-make ready work inspections and call for remedial work if needed, at the new provider’s expense.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet"/&gt;

===San Antonio, Texas===
On May 6, 2016, [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]]'s [[Municipal utility district|municipal utility]], [[CPS Energy]], adopted broad new guidelines which included many of the fundamental principles of One Touch Make Ready legislation.&lt;ref name="CPS"&gt;{{ Cite web | URL = https://www.cpsenergy.com/content/dam/corporate/en/Documents/PoleAttachments/Pole%20Attachment%20Standards.pdf | title = CPS Energy Pole Attachment Standards | date = May 6, 2016 | publisher = [[CPS Energy]] | access-date = August 19, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The standards include specific requirements for OTMR, and include what needs to happen before, during and after the process.  The 128-page standards are far more detailed than the legislation passed by [[Louisville, Kentucky]] a few months prior.  This is mainly due to CPS being an electric company.&lt;ref name="3cities"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://muninetworks.org/content/one-touch-make-ready-three-cities-and-counting | title = One Touch Make Ready: In three cities and counting | publisher = The Institute for Local Self-Reliance | date = June 28, 2017 | access-date = August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Introduction of the standards states: 

{{quote|From a holistic perspective, the[se] Standards seek to balance the competing needs and interests of multiple communications providers to access and utilize CPS Energy Poles, while at the same time recognizing that the core purpose and function of these Poles is for CPS Energy's safe and reliable distribution and delivery of electric services to CPS Energy customers. Hence, any use of CPS Energy's Poles must at all times ensure the continued operational integrity, safety, and reliability of CPS Energy's Facilities, electric services, personnel and the general public.&lt;ref name="CPS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="3cities"/&gt;}}

The standards go on to lay out technical provisions, administrative procedures, as well as various specific provisions for both wired and wireless utility pole attachments.  They incorporate recommendations from the FCC on how best to expand broadband while also addressing safety concerns by working into the guidelines various safety standards recommended by the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA).&lt;ref name="3cities"/&gt;

===Nashville, Tennessee===
On August 2, 2016, the [[Metropolitan Council of Nashville and Davidson County]] began to debate its own One Touch Make Ready Ordinance.&lt;ref name="City Ord"/&gt;  The measure, sponsored by Councilman Anthony Davis, was nearly identical to the measure passed by the city of Louisville several months prior.  On September 6, 2016, the Nashville City Council Approved the Measure 32-7 on a roll-call vote, as the Council's computer systems were down.&lt;ref name="ISR1"&gt;{{cite web | URL = https://muninetworks.org/content/nashville-one-touch-make-ready-moves-forward | title = Nashville One Touch Make Ready Moves Foreward | publisher = The Institute for Local Self-Reliance | date = September 9, 2016 | access-date = August 19, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | URL = http://www.nashville.gov/mc/pdfs/roll_call_votes/bl2016_343.pdf | title= Roll Call Vote for Bill NO.

This resolution was defeated 26-12.  A few hours later, the City Council passed the OTMR bill via voice vote.  After the vote, Nashville Mayor [[Megan Barry]], stated she would sign the bill.&lt;ref name="Nashville1"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2016/09/20/nashville-gives-final-approval-google-fiber-one-touch-plan/90739526/ | title = Nashville gives final approval of Google Fiber One Touch Plan | publisher = The Tennessean | first1 = Joey | last1 = Garrison | first2 = Jamie | last2 = McGee | date = September 20, 2016 | access-date = August 19, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 2016, the Mayor of [[Nashville, Tennessee]], Megan Barry, signed into law the city's OTMR ordinance.&lt;ref name="signed"&gt;{{cite web | URL = http://www.multichannel.com/news/policy/nashville-approves-one-touch-make-ready-plan/407884 | title = Nashville Approves One Touch Make Ready Plan | first1 = Jeff | last1 = Baumgartner | date = September 21, 2016 | access-date = August 19, 2017 | publisher = Multichannel News }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ordinance exists under Nashville Law as Ordinance BL2016-343&lt;ref name="City Ord"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nashville.gov/mc/ordinances/term_2015_2019/bl2016_343.htm | title = Ordinance BL2016-343 | publisher = Nashville Local Government | work = Nashville City Council | date = September 21, 2016 | access-date = August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, throughout the entire process of the debate amongst council lawmakers on the specifics of the bill, Barry remained neutral on the bill's contents, refusing to comment on the bill's status, and only encouraging lawmakers and providers to seek a compromise.&lt;ref name="Nashville1"/&gt;

==Arguments==

===In favor===
====Reduced cost, time, and disruption====
[[Image:Replacing an advertising poster in London using an articulated platform 02.JPG|thumb|right|An aerial work platform.]]
Supporters, such as the Fiber to the Home Council (FTTHC) and the [[NCTA (association)|National Cable and Telecommunications Association (NCTA)]], argue that OTMR policies drastically reduce the cost of adding additional lines, noting that allowing a single crew to work on a line over the course of a single workday, as opposed to multiple crews working on multiple, often non-sequential days, reduces the financial cost of adding additional lines, by decreasing the number of workers needed to install a new line, thereby decreasing the total number of man-hours worked.  Further, the FTTHC argues that OTMR policies reduce the traffic disruption caused by the large [[Aerial work platform|Aerial work platforms]] used by the overwhelming majority of utility pole maintenance companies in the United States.&lt;ref name="OneTouch2"/&gt;

====Increased Competition====
Supporters, such as [[Google Fiber]] and several lawmakers, have argued that OTMR policies create and encourage competition, as they can theoretically allow any outside [[Internet service provider]] to lay networks of [[Fiber optic cables]], thus leading to a breakup of the various local internet [[Monopoly#Utilities|monopolies]] which exist across the United States.&lt;ref name="Nashville1"/&gt; 

===Opposed===
Numerous groups have criticized OTMR since its implementation in several cities. The [[American Legislative Exchange Council]] (ALEC), along with several lobbying groups, have critiqued the proposal.&lt;ref name="ALEC"&gt;{{cite web | URL = https://www.alec.org/article/how-municipalities-are-placing-taxpayer-money-at-risk-with-one-touch-make-ready-ordinances/ | title = How municipalities are placing taxpayer money at risk with one touch Make Ready Ordinances | first = Jonathan | last = Hauenschild | publisher = [[American Legislative Exchange Council]] | date = August 10, 2016 | access-date = August 17, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the measure has received extremely vocal opposition from cable and telephone providers, mainly AT&amp;T and Comcast, who together have thus far filed lawsuits against every city which has successfully passed OTMR ordinances.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

====Federal oversight====
Opponents, including AT&amp;T, Comcast, and the [[Nashville Electric Service]] (NES), have argued that the regulation of telecommunications poles falls under the purview of the [[Federal Communications Commission]].  To back this up, they cite federal pole attachment rules, which mandate the Federal Communications Commission, not local municipalities, regulate telecommunications poles.  However, on October 30, 2016, in response to the case ''AT&amp;T v. Louisville Metro'', the Federal Communications Commission stated that states which have opted out of the FCC guidelines (including [[Kentucky]]) are not subject to the Federal Pole Attachment rules.&lt;ref name="FCC"&gt;{{cite news | URL = http://www.tennessean.com/story/money/tech/2016/10/31/fcc-louisvilles-one-touch-policy-doesnt-violate-federal-law/93066984/| title = FCC: Louisville's one touch policy doesn't violate federal law | publisher = The Tennessean | date = October 31, 2016 | access-date = August 17, 2017 | first = Jamie | last = McGee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Involvement of Google Fiber====
Opponents, including the [[American Legislative Exchange Council]], have criticized the policy as a blatant attempt by local officials to "bend over backward" to ensure the continued support of [[Google Fiber]]'s expansion within their respective cities. ALEC further contends that cities are willing to spend millions of taxpayer dollars to defend legislation in court that they see as only a way to appease [[Google]]. They cite Google's willingness to join as defendants in every OTMR lawsuit filed as of August 2017.&lt;ref name="ALEC"/&gt;

====Rights of corporations====
Opponents such as the [[American Legislative Exchange Council]] have argued that OTMR ordinances violate the property rights of corporations to control what happens on their respective lines.  They further claim that OTMR ordinances violate federal property law by allegedly allowing any third party to relocate equipment on a pole, without notifying the equipment's owners, unless the third party believes there will be a service outage.&lt;ref name="ALEC"/&gt; However, so far, all cities which have successfully passed OTMR ordinances have included provisions which mandate that only contractors approved by the pole's owners may work on the lines.&lt;ref name="OneTouch1"/&gt;

====Union concerns====
Opponents, such as the [[Communications Workers of America]] (the largest communications labor union in the United States), have argued against One Touch Make Ready proposals on the grounds that the new proposals have the potential to create unsafe working conditions, as well as violate existing labor contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | URL = http://www.fiercetelecom.com/telecom/cwa-fcc-should-reject-one-touch-make-ready-pole-attachment-proposals-obstruct-safe | title = CWA: FCC should reject One Touch Make Ready | publisher = Fierce Telecom | date = June 19, 2017 | first1 = Sean | last1 = Buckley | access-date = August 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In their filing with the Federal Communications Commission on the matter, the union argues that since new attachers would not be required to submit formal applications, this could lead to a situation where existing infrastructure could be damaged by workers who are unfamiliar with the lines.  The union further emphasizes that pole owners should be able to conduct a thorough review of the lines before any work can be done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | URL = https://www.cwa-union.org/sites/default/files/cwa_wireline_broadband_comments_final_with_appendices.pdf | title = Comments of the Communications Workers of America to the Federal Communications Commission | publisher = [[Communications Workers of America]] | date = June 15, 2017 | first1 = Debbie | last1 = Goldman | first2 = Brian | last2 = Thorn | access-date = August 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
[[File:States_where_One_Touch_Make_Ready_is_legal.png|thumb|right|200px|States where One Touch Make Ready can legally be implemented, according to the Federal Communications Commission]]

Under the guidelines of the Federal Communications Commission, states are presented with two options for the regulation of their utility poles.  They can either pass legislation regognizing the right of the FCC to regulate their utility poles, or states can form their own regulatory agencies and maintain their right to self-regulate their utility poles.  As of 2016, thirty states have turned over regulatory power to the FCC, while the remaining twenty states have maintained their right to self-regulate.  All [[Territories of the United States]] and [[Insular area|Insular areas]] must adopt the federal guidelines.&lt;ref name="FCC2"/&gt;

According to the Federal Communications Commission in 2016, under current regulatory statutes, localities that reside in states which have forfeited their right to self-regulate their utility poles to the federal government are unable to implement One Touch Make Ready legislation in its current form.&lt;Ref name ="FCC2"/&gt;  The twenty states which maintained their right to self-regulate, and thus can pass OTMR legislation are:

==Legal Challenges==
===AT&amp;T vs. Louisville Metro Government===
On February 25, 2016, [[AT&amp;T]] (which owns an estimated 25-40% of [[Louisville, Kentucky]]'s utility poles) filed a lawsuit in federal court against the [[Government of Louisville, Kentucky|Lousiville Metro Government]].  In the lawsuit, officially titled ''BellSouth Telecommunications LLC vs. Louisville/Jefferson County Metro Government'',  AT&amp;T argued that the city's One Touch Make Ready ordinance violated state and federal law.  In the 11-page filing, AT&amp;T asked a federal judge to clarify that the power to regulate pole attachments lies solely with the [[Kentucky Public Service Commission]], as well as with the [[Federal Communications Commission]].&lt;ref name="AT&amp;T"&gt;{{cite news | URL = http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/metro-government/2016/02/25/t-sues-city-over-google-fiber-proposal/80881870/ | title = AT&amp;T sues Louisville Metro over One Touch Fiber proposal | date = February 26, 2016 | first = Phillip | last = Bailey | access-date = August 20, 2017 | publisher = [[The Courier-Journal]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to the lawsuit, Louisville Mayor [[Greg Fischer]] stated: "We will vigorously defend the lawsuit filed today by AT&amp;T, as Gigabit fiber is too important to our city's future." AT&amp;T responded by stating that the ordinance allowed third parties to seize its property temporarily.  In a statement, an AT&amp;T spokesman said: "Unless the court declares the ordinance invalid and permanently enjoins Louisville Metro from enforcing it, AT&amp;T will suffer irreparable harm that cannot be addressed by recovery of damages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | URL = http://www.wdrb.com/story/31319058/att-sues-louisville-over-utility-pole-law-adopted-for-google-fiber | title = AT&amp;T sues Louisville over utility pole law adopted for Google Fiber | first = Chris | last = Ottis | date = February 26, 2016 | publisher = WDRB | access-date = August 20, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 26, 2016, in an official blog post titled "Standing With Louisville," Chris Levendos, [[Google Fiber]]'s Director of National Deployment and Operations stood by the city, stating: "Google Fiber stands with the city of Louisville and the other cities across the country that are taking steps to bring faster, better broadband to their residents."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | URL = https://fiber.googleblog.com/2016/02/standing-with-louisville.html | title = Standing with Louisville | first = Chris | last = Levendos | publisher = GoogleBlog | work = [[Google Fiber]] | date = February 26, 2016 | access-date = August 20, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | URL = https://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/news/2016/03/01/google-fiber-is-standing-with-louisville-in-at-t.html | title = Google Fiber is standing with Louisville | date = March 1, 2016 | first = David | last = Serchuck | publisher = Louisville Business First | access-date = August 20, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

On June 29, 2016, Attorneys for [[Frontier Communications]] filed a briefing in federal court asking to join AT&amp;T as plaintiffs in the case.  In their briefing, Frontier argued that, even though they do not serve the state of Kentucky, the ordinance's "unprecedented scope" could set a precedent that could harm Frontier's business in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/news/2016/06/29/why-this-company-is-throwing-its-weight-behind-at.html | title = Why this company is throwing its weight behind AT&amp;T's lawsuit | publisher = Louisville Busisness first | first = Baylee | last = Pullman | date = June 29, 2016 | access-date = August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Frontier also noted that they were not paid by AT&amp;T to assist in the suit, nor were they asked about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/07/frontier-teams-with-att-to-block-google-fiber-access-to-utility-poles/ | title = Frontier teams with AT&amp;T to block Google Fiber Access to Utility poles | date = July 1, 2016 | access-date = August 20, 2016 | first = Jon | last = Brodkin | publisher = ArsTechnica }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 6, 2016, Attorneys for  Google Fiber filed a court briefing that, if approved, would allow the company to assist in defending against the suit.  In their filing, they claim the ordinance is: “a valid exercise of Louisville Metro’s unquestioned authority to manage construction activities in public rights-of-way.”  Further, the attorneys argued that the ordinance would “enhance public safety while reducing disturbance and congestion.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://wfpl.org/google-fiber-comes-to-city-defense-in-att-suit/ | work = WFPL | publisher = NPR | first = Jacob | last = Ryan | access-date = August 20, 2017 | date = October 11, 2016 | title = Fiber comes to city's defense in AT&amp;T suit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 31, 2016, in response to the lawsuit, the Federal Communications Commission released a statement, which guaranteed that the city's OTMR ordinance does not conflict with federal law.&lt;ref name ="FCC2"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2016/db1101/DOC-342018A1.pdf | title = Statement of Interest of the United States | work = [[Federal Communications Commission]] | first1 = Benjamin | last1 = Miser | first2= John | last2 = Griffiths | date = October 31, 2016 | access-date = August 20, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the filing, the FCC stated that “[AT&amp;T] maintains in its motion for summary judgment that the Louisville Ordinance conflicts with, and is therefore preempted by, the federal pole-attachment rules promulgated by the Commission under Section 224.  That argument is wrong as a matter of law.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://wirelessestimator.com/articles/2016/atts-utility-pole-claims-are-rebutted-by-the-fcc/ | title = AT&amp;T's Utility pole claims are rebutted by the FCC | publisher = Wireless Estimator | date = November 2, 2016 | access-date = August 20, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 16, 2017, US District Court Judge David Hayes rejected AT&amp;T's arguments and threw out the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | URL = http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/metro-government/2017/08/16/judge-throws-out-at-t-suit-against-citys-google-fiber-proposal/573863001/ | title = Judge throws out AT&amp;T suit against city's Google Fiber Proposal | date = August 16, 2017 | access-date = August 20, 2017 | first1 = Phillip | last1 = Bailey | publisher = The Courier Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "A one-touch make-ready approach inherently regulates public rights-of-way because it reduces the number of encumbrances or burdens placed on public rights-of-way," Hale wrote. "The one-touch make-ready ordinance requires that all necessary make-ready work be performed by a single crew, lessening the impact of make-ready work on public rights-of-way."  Hale also ruled that FCC guidelines do not apply in Kentucky, as the state exempted itself from those laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | URL = https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/305913/judge-rejects-atts-challenge-to-louisville-law-t.html?edition=104762 | title = Judge rejects AT&amp;Ts challenge to Louisville's law | publisher = Mediapost.com | date = August 17, 2017 | access-date = August 20, 2017 | first = Wendy | last = Davis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AT&amp;T/Comcast vs. Nashville Metro Government===
On September 22, 2016, AT&amp;T filed a lawsuit in federal court against the Metro Government of [[Nashville, Tennessee]], less than 24 hours after the city had passed its One Touch Make Ready Ordinance.  At the time, AT&amp;T owned approximately 20% of the utility poles within the Nashville Metro area.  In the lawsuit, titled ''BellSouth Telecommunications, LLC, D/B/A AT&amp;T, Tennessee versus The Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County, Tennessee; In her official capacity as Mayor; and Mark Sturtevant, in his official capacity as transitional interim Director of the Department of Public Works'', AT&amp;T argued that the sole authority to regulate utility poles lies with the Federal Communications Commission.  The lawsuit sought from the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee a permanent injunction against the city, preventing the ordinance from ever going into effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | URL = https://www.scribd.com/document/324972837/AT-T-complaint#from_embed | title = BellSouth Telecommunications, LLC, D/B/A, AT&amp;T, Tennessee versus The Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County, Tennessee; In her official capacity as Mayor; and Mark Sturtevant, in his official capacity as transitional interim Director of the Department of Public Works | author = AT&amp;T | publisher = The US District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee | date = September 22, 2016 | access-date = August 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Notably, the lawsuit differed from the one filed against the city of Louisville in that it did not claim that the state had the power to regulate utility poles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | URL = http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2016/09/22/att-sues-nashville-over-google-fiber-one-touch-law/90852632/ | title = AT&amp;T sues Nashville over Google Fiber One Touch | publisher = The Tennessean | date = September 22, 2016 | access-date = August 21, 2017 | first1 = Joey | last1 = Garrison}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 26, 2016, Comcast filed a lawsuit in federal court against the Metro Government of Nashville over the city's One Touch ordinance.  Comcast, like AT&amp;T, sought a permanent injunction to prevent the ordinance from going into effect.  In response to the filing, Nashville Mayor Megan Barry said: “One Touch Make Ready has been litigated in the court of public opinion, and the public overwhelmingly supports this measure designed to speed up the deployment of high-speed fiber in Nashville.  Now, we hope that this federal litigation is quickly resolved so that we can get on with the business of expanding access to gigabit Internet throughout Davidson County.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | URL = https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/10/comcast-sues-nashville-to-halt-rules-that-help-google-fiber/ | title = Comcast sues Nashville to halt rules that help Google Fiber | publisher = ArsTechnica | date = October 26, 2016 | access-date = August 22, 2017 | first1 = Jon | last1 = Brodkin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 31, 2016, Nashville Metro filed a request with a federal judge to consolidate the two lawsuits.  In the filing, attorneys representing the city argued for why the cases should be consolidated:
 ''"Defendants propose that consolidation is proper because: (1) both cases arrive from substantially similar operative facts and claims and involve similar defenses relating to the Metropolitan Government’s enactment of Ordinance BL2016-343; (2) Plaintiff’s civil cover sheet in Comcast references this case as a related case (Comcast, Doc. No. 1-3); (3) allowing the cases to proceed separately risks inconsistent adjudication; (4) adjudicating parallel cases in the same Court would inevitably require duplicative tasks and duplicative rulings; and (5) both cases are already in the same Court, so consolidation would not require a case to be transferred to a different Court. For these reasons, Defendants propose that consolidation of these cases is in the best interest of the parties and promotes judicial economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | URL = https://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/news/2016/10/31/fiber-wars-metro-moves-to-consolidate-at-t-comcast.html | title = Fiber Wars: Metro moves to consolidate AT&amp;T Comcast Lawsuits | publisher = Nashville Business Journal | first1 = Eleanor | last1 = Kennedy | date = October 31, 2016 | access-date = August 22, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;''

On November 10, 2016, Ken Sharp, the federal judge overseeing the case, approved the request to merge the lawsuits.  He also granted an extension to the city's deadline to file a response to the initial filing of the lawsuit, extending their deadline to November 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | URL = https://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/news/2016/11/10/judge-merges-at-t-comcast-lawsuits-against-metro.html | title = Judge merges AT&amp;T Comcast Lawsuits against Metro | publisher = Nashville Busisness Journals | first1 = Eric | last1 = Snyder | date = November 10, 2016 | access-date = August 22, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On November 14, 2016, the city of Nashville filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, citing that AT&amp;T did not provide information regarding exactly where the local ordinance conflicted with federal law.  "The Metropolitan Government determined on a municipal level what approach to rights-of-way management would best serve local needs, and enacted an ordinance that aligns with and supports federal policy," Nashville's filing supporting the motion said.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | URL = http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/2016/11/14/metro-files-motion-dismiss-t-lawsuit/93819716/ | title = Metro Files Motion to Dismiss lawsuit | publisher = The Tennessean | date = November 14, 2016 | access-date = August 21, 2017 | first1 = Jamie | last1 = McGee }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charter Communications vs. Louisville Metro Government===
On October 5, 2016, [[Charter Communications]], a utility company that owns [[Time Warner Cable]] and does business in Louisville, filed a lawsuit against the city's Metro Government.  In the lawsuit, Charter alleges that the city's OTMR ordinance violates Charter's [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|fifth amendment]] rights, specifically over what is referred to as the "Taking's Clause."&lt;ref name="ARS1"&gt;{{Cite news | URL = https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/10/charter-like-att-sues-louisville-to-stall-google-fiber/ | title = Charter like AT&amp;T sues Louisville to stall Google Fiber | publisher = ArsTechnica | date = October 5, 2016 | access-date = August 23, 2017 | first1 = Jon | last1 = Brodkin}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The takings clause states that ''"...private property [shall not] be taken for public use, without just compensation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | URL = http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/amendments/5/essays/151/takings-clause | title = Takings clause | publisher = The Heritage Foundation | last1 = Kmiec | first1 = Douglas | access-date = August 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;''  Charter's lawsuit also hinges on the argument that their right to "speak" as a corporation is being violated, however, Charter's lawyers did not specifically reference any infringement by the local government.&lt;ref name="ARS1"/&gt;

On June 29, 2017, it was revealed through court filings that the case, officially titled ''"Insight Kentucky Partners versus Louisville/Jefferson County Metro Government"'' would be going to trial.  The trial is set to be overseen by U.S District Senior Judge [[Charles Ralph Simpson III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | URL = https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/charter-refer-to-magistrate-judge.pdf | title = Court Filing #36 on Case  3:16-cv-00625-CRS-CHL | publisher = ArsTechnica | date = June 29, 2017 | access-date = August 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a federal judge threw out AT&amp;T's lawsuit against the city of Louisville, it was revealed that Charter's lawsuit would be unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | URL = https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/08/att-loses-lawsuit-in-which-it-tried-to-thwart-google-fiber-construction/ | title = AT&amp;T loses lawsuit in which it tried to thwart Google fiber Construction | date = August 17, 2017 | first1 = Jon | last1 = Brodkin | access-date = August 23, 2017 | publisher = Ars Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nashville Electric Service vs. Nashville Metro Government===
On October 21, 2016, the [[Nashville Electric Service]] (abbreviated NES), which is one of the twelve largest public electric utilities in the United States, filed a lawsuit against the Metro Government of [[Nashville, Tennessee]].  At the time, NES owned 80 percent of the utility poles in Nashville.  After filing the lawsuit, a spokesman for the company said the OTMR ordinance forces the company to choose between complying with the new law or its existing contracts with [[AT&amp;T]], [[Comcast]], as well as other internet providers. According to the court filing, the declaratory judgment is meant to clarify NES's rights and obligations.  The company also stated that it had received a letter from AT&amp;T, threatening to sue them if they complied with the law.  In response to the lawsuit being filed, Nashville Mayor [[Megan Barry]] stated: “We believe in One Touch Make Ready and look forward to defending its legality.  Our focus is simply on providing services to our citizens, who have expressed their desire for those services through their elected representatives."&lt;ref name="TN1"&gt;{{cite news | URL = http://www.tennessean.com/story/money/tech/2016/10/31/nes-takes-legal-action-controversial-one-touch-make-ready-ordinance-backed-google-fiber/93062794/ | title = NES Takes legal action over controversial one touch make ready ordinance backed by Google Fiber | publisher = The Tennessean | first = Jamie | last = McGee | date = October 21, 2016 | access-date = August 17, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

On February 3, 2017, NES announced that it had reached an out-of-court settlement with Google Fiber, as well as the city of Nashville, over the OTMR policy.  In the agreement, "Google Fiber [has] promised NES it would pay any potential damages that result from NES abiding by the ordinance in relation to the deployment of Google Fiber,” NES President and CEO Decosta Jenkins said in a statement issued Friday.  She further clarified “This is a win for NES, Google Fiber, Nashville and residents who are looking forward to having access to Google Fiber.”  As part of this settlement, NES dropped its pending lawsuits against Google and the city of Nashville.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | URL = http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/davidson%20/2017/02/03/nes-strikes-deal-google-fiber-dismisses-lawsuit/97466420/ | title = NES strikes deal with Google Fiber, dismisses lawsuit | publisher = The Tennessean | first = Joey | last = Garrison | date = February 3, 2017 | access-date = August 17, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4671">'''Open College''' was a [[radio]]-based [[university]]-credit [[distance education]] provider based in Toronto, Canada; it primarily served listeners in [[Ontario]]. 

Founded in 1971, the courses were accredited by [[Ryerson University|Ryerson Polytechnic Institute]] and [[York University]]'s Atkinson College and broadcast throughout Toronto and much of southern Ontario on what was then Ryerson owned radio station [[CJRT-FM|CJRT]] which produced and administered the courses. 

The service was conceived of by the Dean of Arts of Ryerson Polytechnic Institute who was inspired by the creation of [[Open University]] in the United Kingdom, which used radio and television to broadcast some of its credit courses. In 1969, [[CJRT-FM|CJRT]] began broadcasting a non-credit education series which led to the development of credit courses two years later. Ryerson sociology professor Margaret Norquay volunteered for the project and produced its first course, Introduction to Sociology, which commenced in January 1971. Norquay went on to become Open College's first director in 1972.&lt;ref name=norq&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Norquay|first1=Margaret|title=Personal Reflections on the Early Years of Ryerson Open College|journal=International Journal of E-learning and Distance Education|date=1993|volume=8|issue=1|pages=71-83|url=http://www.ijede.ca/index.php/jde/article/view/214/640|accessdate=March 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1974, Ryerson divested itself of [[CJRT]] and the radio station became an independent government funded corporation with Open College as one of its departments.&lt;ref name=ccf&gt;{{cite web|title=CJRT|url=http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/index3.html?url=http%3A//www.broadcasting-history.ca/listings_and_histories/radio/histories.php%3Fid%3D418%26historyID%3D199|website=Radio Station History|publisher=Canadian Communications Foundation|accessdate=March 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service used the name "Open College" due to its [[open admissions]] policy.

At its peak, Open College offered 28 credit courses, produced at the radio station and accredited by Ryerson and Atkinson College. An estimated 15,000 students took courses using the service during its existence with student enrollment peaking in 1995.&lt;ref name=ccf/&gt; By the 1980s Open College broadcasts were heard throughout Ontario as CJRT was added to the FM services offered by cable systems throughout the province. Alberta's public radio broadcaster, [[CKUA_Radio_Network|CKUA]], purchased and broadcast several Open College courses which were broadcast in conjunction with credit courses at [[Athabasca University]];&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=0mI8GmHEk_wC&amp;pg=PA300&amp;lpg=PA300&amp;dq=ckua+%22open+college%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MqTg-5dr_P&amp;sig=LUiiToatRqrYx-G8N2v0wZgveo8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ukduVbKbCpOxyQTm4oKACQ&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ckua%20%22open%20college%22&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; CKUA has continued to develop educational broadcasts in conjunction with Athabasca.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ckua.com/about/history-2/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://history.athabascau.ca/faculty/dgregory/&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1999, the administration of Open College was transferred to Ryerson University. In 2003, as a result in the development of the internet as a mode of transmission for distance education and the resulting decline of interest in taking radio courses, as well as [[CJRT-FM|CJRT's]] transformation into an all-jazz radio station, radio broadcasts ended and the service was transferred to Ryerson's [[G. Raymond Chang School of Continuing Education]] which now offers [[distance education]] through the internet instead of by radio. In its last years, Open College broadcasts were aired Sunday mornings from 6am to 8am.&lt;ref name=ccf/&gt;

[[Image:Oxford University Computing Services, Banbury Road, Oxford - geograph.org.uk - 82198.jpg|thumb|Oxford University Computing Services building on [[Banbury Road]].]]

'''Oxford University Computing Services''' ('''OUCS''') until 2012 provided the central [[Information Technology]] services for the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dariah.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=42&amp;Itemid=154 OUCS — Oxford University Computing Services], [http://www.dariah.eu/ Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities] (DARIAH).&lt;/ref&gt; The service was based at 7-19 [[Banbury Road]] in central north [[Oxford]], [[England]], near the junction with [[Keble Road]]. OUCS became part of IT Services, when the new department was created at the University of Oxford on 1 August 2012 through a merger of the three previous central IT departments: Oxford University Computing Services (OUCS), Business Services and Projects (BSP) and ICT Support Team (ICTST).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/uassections/itservices/ UAS IT Services Home]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time when Oxford University Computing Services ceased to operate as an independent department, it offered facilities, training and advice to members of the University in all aspects of academic computing. OUCS was responsible for the core networks reaching all departments and colleges of Oxford University. OUCS was made up of 5 technical and one administration group. Each group had responsibility for different aspects of OUCS services supplied to the University. At the time of the merger, the 5 technical groups were: [[Learning technologies|Learning Technologies]], Information and Support, Network Systems Management Services, Infrastructure Systems and Services Group, and Network and Telecommunications.

== History ==

A lease on a house was obtained in 1957 and operation started in 1958, initially as the [[Oxford University Computing Laboratory|Computing Laboratory]] at 9 [[South Parks Road]], a [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] building, now demolished to make way for the Experimental Psychology and [[Department of Zoology, University of Oxford|Zoology]] departments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/internal/history/ History], Oxford University Computing Services, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, due to space problems, the staff and computers moved to 19 [[Parks Road]], the old Engineering Building. In 1970, the Computing Service occupied 17 and 19 Banbury Road, having split from the Computing Laboratory, which became the university's [[Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford|Department of Computer Science]]. By 1975, the Computing Service had taken over all of 7 to 19 Banbury Road, as IT Services still does today. An outpost at 59 [[George Street, Oxford|George Street]] in central Oxford closed in the mid 1990s.

'''Park and ride''' (or '''incentive parking''') facilities are [[parking lots]] with [[public transport]] connections that allow [[commuting|commuters]] and other people heading to [[city centre]]s to leave their vehicles and transfer to a [[bus]], [[Rail transport|rail]] system ([[rapid transit]], [[light rail]], or [[commuter rail]]), or [[carpool]] for the remainder of the journey. The vehicle is left in the car park during the day and retrieved when the owner returns. Park and rides are generally located in the [[suburb]]s of [[metropolitan area]]s or on the outer edges of large cities. A park and ride that only offers parking for meeting a carpool and not connections to public transport may be called a '''park and pool'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DART First State Park &amp; Ride/Park &amp; Pool Lots |publisher=DART First State |url=http://dartfirststate.com/information/getting_there/parkride/pnr_current.pdf?050515 |accessdate=December 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Park and ride is abbreviated as "P+R" on [[road sign]]s in the UK, and is often styled as "Park &amp; Ride" in marketing.

In [[Sweden]], a tax has been introduced on the benefit of free or cheap parking paid by an employer, if workers would otherwise have to pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skatteverket.se/rattsinformation/skrivelser/aldrear/2005/skrivelser2005.5.2132aba31199fa6713e800017870.html |language=Swedish |title=Skatteverkets skrivelse, Information om beskattning av parkeringsförmån |publisher=Skatteverket |date= |accessdate=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tax has reduced the number of workers driving into the inner city, and increased the usage of park and ride areas, especially in [[Stockholm]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The introduction of a [[Stockholm congestion tax|congestion tax]] in Stockholm has further increased the usage of park and ride.

In [[Prague]], park and ride car parks are established near some metro and railway stations (about 17 parks near 12 metro stations and 3 train stations, in 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dpp.cz/parkoviste/ |title=Aktuální obsazenost P+R &amp;#124; Dopravní podnik hlavního města Prahy |publisher=dpp.cz |language=cs |date= |accessdate=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; These car parks offer low prices and all-day and return (2× 75 min) tickets including the public transport fare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tsk-praha.cz/wps/portal/doprava/parkoviste |title=TSK Praha - P+R |language=cs |publisher=Tsk-praha.cz |date= |accessdate=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Petr Kvapil, Lira IS s.r.o., www.lirais.cz |url=http://www.ropid.cz/cestujeme/p+r,-b+r,-k+r__s191x370.html |title=ROPID-Cestujeme…-P+R, B+R, K+R (od 1.7.2011) |publisher=Ropid.cz |date= |accessdate=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Park and ride facilities allow commuters to avoid a [[stress (medicine)|stressful]] drive along congested roads and a search for scarce, expensive city-centre parking. They may well reduce congestion by assisting the use of public transport in congested urban areas.

There is not much research on the pros and cons of park and ride schemes. It has been suggested that there is "a lack of clear-cut evidence
for park and ride's widely assumed impact in reducing congestion".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcpa.org.uk/resources.php?action=resource&amp;id=808 |title=Park and ride - politics, policy and planning |publisher=Town and Country Planning Association |date=March 2010 |accessdate=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Park and ride facilities help commuters who live beyond practical walking distance from the railway station or bus stop. They may also suit commuters with [[alternative fuel vehicle]]s, which often have reduced range, when the facility is closer to home than the ultimate destination. They also are useful as a fixed meeting place for those [[carsharing]] or [[carpooling]] or using "kiss and ride" (see below). Also, some transit operators use park and ride facilities to encourage more efficient driving practices by reserving parking spaces for [[United States emission standards|low emission designs]], [[High-occupancy vehicle lane|high-occupancy vehicles]], or carsharing.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Many park and rides have passenger waiting areas and/or toilets. [[Public transport timetable|Travel information]], such as leaflets and posters, may be provided. At larger facilities, extra services such as a travel office, food shop, [[car wash]], or [[cafeteria]] may be provided. These are often encouraged by municipal operators to encourage use of park and ride.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Bus park and rides== 
[[Image:Pr2busexeter.jpg|thumb|A park and ride bus in [[Exeter]], England.]]
Park and ride facilities, with dedicated car parks and bus services, began in the 1960s in the UK. [[Oxford]] operated the first such scheme, initially with an experimental service operating part-time from a motel on the [[A34 road (England)|A34]] in the 1960s and then on a full-time basis from 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/10859209.How_Oxford_led_the_way_to_create_Park_and_Rides/|title=How Oxford led the way to create Park and Rides|website=Oxford Mail|language=en|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Better Choice Parking]] first offered an airport park and ride service at [[London Gatwick Airport]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airport-parking-shop.co.uk/main/bcp-parking.html |title=BCP Company Information &amp; Car Parks Offered |publisher=Airport Parking Shop |date= |accessdate=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxford now operates park and ride from 5 dedicated car parks around the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordbus.co.uk/content/doc/cms/companyhistory.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318011104/http://www.oxfordbus.co.uk/content/doc/cms/companyhistory.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, Oxford has the biggest urban park &amp; ride network in the UK with a combined capacity of 5,031 car parking spaces.&lt;ref&gt;http://voyager.oxfordshire.gov.uk/Carpark.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the largest park and rides in [[Saudi Arabia]] is located at Kudai in [[Mecca]]. It helps people go the [[Masjid al-Haram]]. There is a Shuttle Service operated by [[SAPTCO]] that takes people during [[Ramadan]] from the Kudai Parking to the Masjid al-Haram.

Some [[railway station]]s are promoted as a park and ride facility for a town some distance away, for instance {{Stnlnk|Liskeard}} for [[Looe]] and {{Stnlnk|Lelant Saltings}} for [[St Ives, Cornwall|St &amp;nbsp;Ives]], both in [[Cornwall]], England. Names of stations in the UK with large car parks outside the main urban area are often suffixed with "Parkway", such as {{Stnlnk|Bristol Parkway}}, {{Stnlnk|Tiverton Parkway}}, and {{Stnlnk|Oxford Parkway}}. At {{Stnlnk|Luton Airport Parkway}} and {{Stnlnk|Southampton Airport Parkway}}, the stations are there to serve air as well as road passengers.

In the [[United States]], it is common for outlying rail stations to include automobile parking, often with hundreds of spaces. [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], for example, has built several large parking facilities at its commuter rail and [[metro station]]s near major highways and large [[Arterial road|arterial surface roads]] around the periphery of the city: [[Alewife (MBTA station)|Alewife]], [[Braintree (MBTA station)|Braintree]], [[Forest Hills (MBTA station)|Forest Hills]], [[Hyde Park (MBTA station)|Hyde Park]], [[Quincy Adams (MBTA station)|Quincy Adams]], [[Riverside (MBTA station)|Riverside]], [[Route 128 (MBTA station)|Route&amp;nbsp;128]], [[Wellington (MBTA station)|Wellington]], [[Anderson Regional Transportation Center|Woburn]]. The local transit operator, the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]], offers 46,000&amp;nbsp;park and ride spaces.

Many railway stations and airports feature a "kiss-and-ride" or "kiss-and-fly" area in which cars can stop briefly to discharge or, less commonly, pick up passengers. The term first appeared in a 20 January 1956 report in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{cite news |title=Transit Plan Agreement Smoked Out |work=Los Angeles Times |agency=Associated Press |date=20 January 1956 |page=4 |url=http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/citations/kiss_and_ride_2/ |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the nominal scenario whereby a passenger is driven to the station by spouse or [[Significant other|partner]]; they kiss each other goodbye before the passenger catches the train.&lt;ref name="LATimes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language |author=[[David Crystal]] |year=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0 521 53033 4 |page=285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Car-share park and rides==
Park and ride schemes do not necessarily involve public transport. They can be provided to reduce the number of cars on the road by promoting [[carpool]]ing, [[vanpooling]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Park and Ride {{!}} Commuter Park'n'ride Options|url=http://www.vride.com/park-and-ride-commuter-park-n-ride-options|publisher=Vride|accessdate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[carsharing]]. Partly because of the concentration of riders, and thus a reduced number of vehicles, these park and ride terminals often have express transit services into the urban area, such as a [[high-occupancy vehicle lane]]. The service may take passengers in only one direction in the morning (typically towards a [[central business district]]) and in the opposite direction in the evening, with no or a limited number of trips available in the middle of the day. It is often not allowed to park at these locations overnight. These attributes vary from region to region.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Path Analysis Graphic.png|400px|thumb|A path analysis graph]] --&gt;
'''Path analysis''', is the analysis of a path, which is a portrayal of a chain of consecutive events that a given user or cohort performs during a set period of time while using a website, online game, or eCommerce platform. As a subset of [[behavioral analytics]], path analysis is a way to understand user behavior in order to gain actionable insights into the data. Path analysis provides a visual portrayal of every event a user or cohort performs as part of a path during a set period of time.

While it is possible to track a user’s path through the site, and even show that path as a visual representation, the real question is how to gain these actionable insights. If path analysis simply outputs a "pretty"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thayer|first=Shelby|title=Why Do We Care About Path Analysis?|url=http://www.trendingupward.net/2008/09/ditch-path-analysis/|work=Trending Upward}}&lt;/ref&gt;  graph, while it may look nice, it does not provide anything concrete to act upon.

==Examples==
In order to get the most out of path analysis the first step would be to determine what needs to be analyzed and what are the goals of the analysis. A company might be trying to figure out why their site is running slow, are certain types of users interested in certain pages or products, or if their user interface is set up in a logical way.

Now that the goal has been set there are a few ways of performing the analysis. If a large percentage of a certain cohort, people between the ages of 18-25, logs into an online game, creates a profile and then spends the next 10 minutes wandering around the menu page, then it may be that the user interface is not logical. By seeing this group of users following the path that they did a developer will be able to analyze the data and realize that after creating a profile, the “play game” button does not appear. Thus, path analysis was able to provide actionable data for the company to act on and fix an error.

In eCommerce, path analysis can help customize a shopping experience to each user. By looking at what products other customers in a certain cohort looked at before buying one, a company can suggest “items you may also like” to the next customer and increase the chances of them making a purchase. Also, path analysis can help solve performance issues on a platform. For example, a company looks at a path and realizes that their site freezes up after a certain combinations of events. By analyzing the path and the progression of events that led to the error, the company can pinpoint the error and fix it.

==Evolution==

Historically path analysis fell under the broad category of [[website analytics]], and related only to the analysis of paths through websites. Path analysis in [[website analytics]] is a process of determining a sequence of pages visited in a visitor session prior to some desired event, such as the visitor purchasing an item or requesting a newsletter.  The precise order of pages visited may or may not be important and may or may not be specified.  In practice, this analysis is done in aggregate, ranking the paths (sequences of pages) visited prior to the desired event, by descending frequency of use.  The idea is to determine what features of the website encourage the desired result.  "Fallout analysis," a subset of path analysis, looks at "black holes" on the site, or paths that lead to a dead end most frequently, paths or features that confuse or lose potential customers.

With the advent of big data along with web-based applications, online games, and eCommerce platforms, path analysis has come to include much more than just web path analysis. Understanding how users move through an app, game, or other web platform are all part of modern-day path analysis.

== Understanding visitors ==
In the real world when you visit a shop the shelves and products are not placed in a random order. The shop owner carefully analyzes the visitors and path they walk through the shop, especially when they are selecting or buying products. Next the shop owner will reorder the shelves and products to optimize sales by putting everything in the most logical order for the visitors. In a supermarket this will typically result in the wine shelf next to a variety of cookies, chips, nuts, etc. Simply because people drink wine and eat nuts with it.

In most web sites there is a same logic that can be applied. Visitors who have questions about a product will go to the product information or support section of a web site. From there they make a logical step to the frequently asked questions page if they have a specific question. A web site owner also wants to analyze visitor behavior. For example, if a web site offers products for sale, the owner wants to convert as many visitors to a completed purchase. If there is a sign-up form with multiple pages, web site owners want to guide visitors to the final sign-up page.

Path analysis answers typical questions like: &lt;br /&gt;
''Where do most visitors go after they enter my home page?''&lt;br /&gt;
''Is there a strong visitor relation between product A and product B on my web site?''. &lt;br /&gt;
Questions that can't be answered by page hits and unique visitors statistics.

== Funnels and goals ==

Google Analytics provides a path function with funnels and goals. A predetermined path of web site pages is specified and every visitor walking the path is a goal. This approach is very helpful when analyzing how many visitors reach a certain destination page, called an end point analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Analysis Tools|url=https://www.google.com/analytics/features/analysis-tools.html|publisher=Google Analytics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Using maps ==

The paths visitors walk in a web site can lead to an endless number of unique paths. As a result, there is no point in analyzing each path, but to look for the strongest paths. These strongest paths are typically shown in a graphical map or in text like: Page A --&gt; Page B --&gt; Page D --&gt; Exit.

[[File:Photonic Curing.ogv|right|thumb|Photonic curing of a printed nanosilver trace on [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]].]]
'''Photonic curing''' is the high-temperature thermal processing of a [[thin film]] using pulsed light from a [[flashlamp]].&lt;ref name="Schroder 2011"&gt;K. A. Schroder, Technical Proceedings of the 2011 NSTI Nanotechnology Conference and Trade Show, 2, 220-223, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  When this transient processing is done on a low-temperature substrate such as plastic or paper, it is possible to attain a significantly higher temperature than the substrate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.novacentrix.com/sites/default/files/pdf/Schroder-NSTI-2011.pdf|title=Mechanisms of Photonic Curing™: Processing High Temperature Films on Low Temperature Substrates|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; can ordinarily withstand under an equilibrium heating source such as an [[oven]].&lt;ref name="Schroder 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schroder 2006" /&gt;  Since the rate of most thermal curing processes (drying, [[sintering]], reacting, annealing, etc.) generally increase exponentially with temperature (i.e. they obey the [[Arrhenius equation]]), this process allows materials to be cured much more rapidly than with an oven.&lt;ref name="Schroder 2006"&gt;K. A. Schroder, S. C. McCool, W. R. Furlan, Technical Proceedings of the 2006 NSTI Nanotechnology Conference and Trade Show, 3, 198-201, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="R&amp;DMag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rdmag.com/RD100-Awards-Flexible-Electronics-Process/|title=In flexible electronics, it’s all about protecting the paper|work=Research &amp; Development|accessdate=24 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725022503/http://www.rdmag.com/RD100-Awards-Flexible-Electronics-Process/|archivedate=25 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has become a transformative process used in the manufacture of printed electronics as it allows inexpensive and flexible substrates to be substituted for traditional glass or ceramic substrates. Additionally, the higher temperature processing afforded by photonic curing reduces the processing time exponentially, often from minutes down to milliseconds, which increases throughput all while maintaining a small machine footprint.

==Uses==
Photonic curing is used as a thermal processing technique in the manufacturing of [[printed electronics]] as it allows the substitution of glass or ceramic substrate materials with inexpensive and flexible substrate materials such as polymers or paper. The effect can be demonstrated with an ordinary camera flash.&lt;ref name="Patent"&gt;US Pat. #7,820,097.&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial photonic curing systems are typically water cooled and have controls and features similar to industrial [[lasers]]. The pulse rate can be fast enough to allow curing on the fly at speeds beyond 100&amp;nbsp;m/min making it suitable as a curing process for [[roll-to-roll processing]]. Material processing rates can exceed 1&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s.&lt;ref name="Schroder 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ORNL poster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ms.ornl.gov/mpg/pdf/researchthrusts/AP_PTPposterv2.pdf|title=NovaCentrix R&amp;D 100 Award Winner, 2009|accessdate=July 18, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001171054/http://www.ms.ornl.gov/mpg/pdf/researchthrusts/AP_PTPposterv2.pdf|archivedate=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The maturing complexity of modern printed electronics for customer applications demands high throughput manufacturing and improved device function. The functionality of the printed electronics is critically important as customers demand more out of each device. Multiple layers are designed into each device, requiring ever more versatile processing techniques. Photonic curing is uniquely suited to complement the processing needs in the manufacture of modern printed electronics by providing a fast, reliable and transformative processing step. Photonic curing enables a lower thermal processing budget with current materials, and it can provide a path to incorporate more advanced materials and functionality into future printed electronics.

==Development==
Photonic curing is similar to Pulse Thermal Processing, developed at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], in which a plasma arc lamp is used.  In the case of photonic curing, the radiant power is higher and the pulse length is shorter.   The total radiant exposure per pulse is less with photonic curing, but the pulse rate is much faster.&lt;ref name="ORNL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ms.ornl.gov/mpg/AP_ptp.shtml|title=Materials Process Group, OakRidge|accessdate=July 19, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001171107/http://www.ms.ornl.gov/mpg/AP_ptp.shtml|archivedate=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quadraphonic open reel tape''' or '''Q4''' was the first medium for [[quadraphonic]] sound recording and playback, introduced to the American market by the [[Vanguard Records|Vanguard Recording Society]] in June 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Curator |first=Museum |url=http://www.obsoletemedia.org/quadraphonic-open-reel-tape/ |title=Quadraphonic open reel tape (Q4) (1969 – mid 1970s) &amp;#124; Museum Of Obsolete Media |publisher=Obsoletemedia.org |date=2013-08-11 |accessdate=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It was based on [[reel-to-reel tape]], and was first used in European electronic-music studios by 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, Lowell, "Electronic Music, 1948–1953", ''Perspectives of New Music'' 7, no. 1 (Autumn–Winter, 1968): 32–65. Citation on 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other quadraphonic formats it was unsuccessful and disappeared by the late 1970s.

==Operation==
All available four tracks were used in one direction on the ¼-inch tape, playing at a speed of 7½ inches per second (twice the speed of the regular 4-Track reel to reel tapes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theartofsound.net/forum/showthread.php?1929-The-Official-Factory-Made-Reel-to-Reel-Tape-Thread&amp;s=277907ddc0421c90b538c564d5d4f18f |title=The Official 'Factory-Made' Reel to Reel Tape Thread |publisher=Theartofsound.net |date= |accessdate=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thevintageknob.org/sony-TC-788-4.html |title=Sony TC-788-4 on |publisher=Thevintageknob.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four fully discrete tracks had full-bandwidth (unlike [[Quad 8|Q8]] cartridges which had limited dynamic range).

'''Real-time locating systems''' ('''RTLS''') are used to automatically [[Automatic identification and data capture|identify]] and [[tracking system|track]] the location of objects or people in [[Real-time computing|real time]], usually within a building or other contained area.  Wireless RTLS tags are attached to objects or worn by people, and in most RTLS, fixed reference points receive wireless signals from tags to determine their location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org |title=International Organization for Standardization |publisher=ISO |date= |accessdate=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of real-time locating systems include tracking automobiles through an assembly line, locating pallets of merchandise in a warehouse, or finding medical equipment in a hospital.

The physical layer of RTLS technology is usually some form of [[radio frequency]] (RF) communication, but some systems use optical (usually [[infrared]]) or acoustic (usually [[ultrasound]]) technology instead of or in addition to RF.  Tags and fixed reference points can be transmitters, receivers, or both, resulting in numerous possible technology combinations.

RTLS are a form of local positioning system, and do not usually refer to GPS or to [[mobile phone tracking]].  Location information usually does not include speed, direction, or spatial orientation.

==Origin==
The term RTLS was created (circa 1998) at the  [[ID EXPO]] trade show by Tim Harrington (WhereNet), Jay Werb, (PinPoint), and Bert Moore, (Automatic Identification Manufacturers, Inc.(AIM)). It was created to describe and differentiate an [[emerging technology]] that not only provided the automatic identification capabilities of active [[RFID]] tags, but also added the ability to view the location on a computer screen. It was at this show that the first examples of a commercial radio based RTLS system were shown by PinPoint and WhereNet. Although this capability had been utilized previously by military and government agencies, the technology had been too expensive for commercial purposes. In the early 1990s, the first commercial RTLS were installed at three healthcare facilities in the United States, and were based on the transmission and decoding of [[infrared light]] signals from actively transmitting tags.  Since then, new technology has emerged that also enables RTLS to be applied to passive tag applications.

==Locating concepts==
RTLS are generally used in indoor and/or confined areas, such as buildings, and do not provide global coverage like [[global positioning system|GPS]]. RTLS tags are affixed to mobile items to be tracked or managed. RTLS reference points, which can be either transmitters or receivers, are spaced throughout a building (or similar area of interest) to provide the desired tag coverage. In most cases, the more RTLS reference points that are installed, the better the location accuracy, until the technology limitations are reached.

A number of disparate system designs are all referred to as "real-time locating systems", but there are two primary system design elements:

===Locating at choke points===
The simplest form of [[choke point]] locating is where short range ID signals from a moving tag are received by a single fixed reader in a sensory network, thus indicating the location coincidence of reader and tag.  Alternately, a choke point identifier can be received by the moving tag, and then relayed, usually via a second wireless channel, to a location processor.  Accuracy is usually defined by the sphere spanned with the reach of the choke point transmitter or receiver.  The use of directional antennas, or technologies such as infrared or [[ultrasound]] that are blocked by room partitions, can support choke points of various geometries.

===Locating in relative coordinates===
ID signals from a tag is received by a multiplicity of readers in a [[sensory network]], and a position is estimated using one or more locating algorithms, such as [[trilateration]], [[multilateration]], or [[triangulation]].  Equivalently, ID signals from several RTLS reference points can be received by a tag, and relayed back to a location processor.  Localization with multiple reference points requires that distances between reference points in the sensory network be known in order to precisely locate a tag, and the determination of distances is called [[ranging]].

Another way to calculate relative location is if [[Mobile tagging|mobile tags]] communicate directly with each other, then relay this information to a location processor.

===Location accuracy===
RF [[trilateration]] uses estimated ranges from multiple receivers to estimate the location of a tag. RF [[triangulation]] uses the angles at which the RF signals arrive at multiple receivers to estimate the location of a tag. Many obstructions, such as walls or furniture, can distort the estimated range and angle readings leading to varied qualities of location estimate. Estimation-based locating is often measured in accuracy for a given distance, such as 90% accurate for 10 meter range.

Systems that use locating technologies that do not go through walls, such as infrared or ultrasound, tend to be more accurate in an indoor environment because only tags and receivers that have line of sight (or near line of sight) can communicate.

==Applications==
RTLS can be used numerous logistical or operational areas such as:
* locate and manage assets within a facility, such as finding a misplaced tool cart in a warehouse or medical equipment
* notification of new locations, such as an alert if a tool cart improperly has left the facility
* to combine identity of multiple items placed in a single location, such as on a pallet
* to locate customers, for example in a restaurant, for delivery of food or service
* to maintain proper staffing levels of operational areas, such as ensuring guards are in the proper locations in a correctional facility
* to quickly and automatically account for all staff after or during an emergency evacuation
* to automatically track and time stamp the progress of people or assets through a process, such as following a patient's emergency room wait time, time spent in the operating room, and total time until discharge.  Such a system can be used for process improvement
* clinical-grade locating to support acute care capacity management

==Privacy concerns==
RTLS may be seen as a threat to [[privacy]] when used to determine the location of people.  The newly declared human right of [[informational self-determination]] gives the right to prevent one's identity and [[personal data]] from being disclosed to others, and also covers disclosure of locality, though this does not generally apply to the [[workplace privacy|workplace]].

Several prominent labor unions have come out against the use of RTLS systems to track workers calling them "the beginning of [[Authoritarian personality|Big Brother]]" and "an [[invasion of privacy]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coren |first=Michael J. |url=http://www.nextgov.com/health/2011/12/vas-real-time-location-system-a-way-to-improve-patient-safety-or-big-brother/50231/ |title=VA's Real-Time Location System: A way to improve patient safety, or Big Brother? |website=Nextgov.com |date=2011-12-05 |accessdate=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A common strategy to overcome opposition to these systems is often similar to the following. However, this loss of privacy may be outweighed by other benefits to staff. For example, Toronto General Hospital is looking at RTLS to reduce quarantine times after an infectious disease outbreak.&lt;ref name="toronto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/article/articleview/9266/1/1/ |title=Toronto General Hospital Uses RTLS to Reduce Infection Transmission |publisher=RFID Journal |date= |accessdate=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a recent SARS outbreak, 1% of all staff were quarantined, and more accurate data regarding who had been exposed to the virus could have reduced the need for quarantines.&lt;ref name="toronto"/&gt;

==Ranging and angulating==
Depending on the physical technology used, at least one and often some combination of ranging and/or angulating methods are used to determine location:
* [[Angle of arrival]] (AoA)
* [[Line-of-sight propagation|Line-of-sight]] (LoS)
* [[Time of arrival]] (ToA)
* [[Multilateration]] (Time difference of arrival) (TDoA)
* [[Time-of-flight]] (ToF)
* [[Symmetrical Double Sided – Two Way Ranging|Two-way ranging]] (TWR) according to Nanotron’s patents
* [[Symmetrical Double Sided – Two Way Ranging]] (SDS-TWR)
* [[Near-field electromagnetic ranging]] (NFER)

==Errors and accuracy==
{{unsourced section|date=May 2017}}
Real-time locating is affected by a variety of errors. Many of the major reasons relate to the physics of the locating system, and may not be reduced by improving the technical equipment.

;None or no direct response

Many RTLS systems require direct and clear line of sight visibility. For those systems, where there is no visibility from mobile tags to fixed nodes there will be no result or a non valid result from [[locating engine]]. This applies to satellite locating as well as other RTLS systems such as angle of arrival and time of arrival. Fingerprinting is a way to overcome the visibility issue: If the locations in the tracking area contain distinct measurement fingerprints, line of sight is not necessarily needed. For example, if each location contains a unique combination of signal strength readings from transmitters, the location system will function properly. This is true, for example, with some Wi-Fi based RTLS solutions. However, having distinct signal strength fingerprints in each location typically requires a fairly high saturation of transmitters.

;False location

The measured location may appear entirely faulty. This is a generally result of simple operational models to compensate for the plurality of error sources. It proves impossible to serve proper location after ignoring the errors.

;Locating backlog

''Real time'' is no registered branding and has no inherent quality. A variety of offers sails under this term. As motion causes location changes, inevitably the latency time to compute a new location may be dominant with regard to motion. Either an RTLS system that requires waiting for new results is not worth the money or the operational concept that asks for faster location updates does not comply with the chosen systems approach.

;Temporary location error

Location will never be reported ''exactly'', as the term ''real-time'' and the term ''precision'' directly contradict in aspects of measurement theory as well as the term ''precision'' and the term ''cost'' contradict in aspects of economy. That is no exclusion of precision, but the limitations with higher speed are inevitable.

;Steady location error

Recognizing a reported location steadily apart from physical presence generally indicates the problem of insufficient over-determination and missing of visibility along at least one link from resident anchors to mobile transponders. Such effect is caused also by insufficient concepts to compensate for calibration needs.

;Location jitter

Noise from various sources has an erratic influence on stability of results. The aim to provide a steady appearance increases the latency contradicting to real time requirements.

;Location jump

As objects containing mass have limitations to jump, such effects are mostly beyond physical reality. Jumps of reported location not visible with the object itself generally indicate improper modeling with the location engine. Such effect is caused by changing dominance of various secondary responses.

;Location creep

Location of residing objects gets reported moving, as soon as the measures taken are biased by secondary path reflections with increasing weight over time.  Such effect is caused by simple averaging and the effect indicates insufficient discrimination of first echoes.

==Standards==

===ISO/IEC===
The basic issues of RTLS are standardized by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] and the International Electrotechnical Commission, under the ISO/IEC 24730 series. In this series of standards, the basic standard ISO/IEC 24730-1 identifies the terms describing a form of RTLS used by a set of vendors, but does not encompass the full scope of RTLS technology.

Currently several standards are published:
* ISO/IEC 19762-5:2008 Information technology &amp;mdash; Automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) techniques &amp;mdash; Harmonized vocabulary—Part 5: Locating systems
* ISO/IEC 24730-1:2014 Information technology &amp;mdash; [[Real-time locating]] systems (RTLS) &amp;mdash; Part 1: Application programming interface (API)

==Limitations and further discussion==
In RTLS application in the Healthcare industry, various studies were issued discussing the limitations of the currently adopted RTLS. Currently used technologies RFID, Wi-fi, UWB, all RFID based are hazardous in the sense of interference with sensitive equipment. A study carried out by Dr Erik Jan van Lieshout of the Academic Medical Centre of the University of Amsterdam published in ''JAMA'' (''Journal of the American Medical Equipment'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=182113 |title=JAMA Network &amp;#124; JAMA &amp;#124; Electromagnetic Interference From Radio Frequency Identification Inducing Potentially Hazardous Incidents in Critical Care Medical Equipment |website=Jama.jamanetwork.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed "RFID and UWB could shut down equipment patients rely on" as "RFID caused interference in 34 of the 123 tests they performed". The first Bluetooth RTLS provider in the medical industry is supporting this in their article: "The fact that RFID cannot be used near sensitive equipment should in itself be a red flag to the medical industry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.locatible.com/blog/rfid-and-uwb-dead-medical-industry/ |title=RFID Dead in the Medical Industry? &amp;#124; |website=Locatible.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RFID Journal responded to this study not negating it rather explaining real-case solution: "The Purdue study showed no effect when ultrahigh-frequency (UHF) systems were kept at a reasonable distance from medical equipment. So placing readers in utility rooms, near elevators and above doors between hospital wings or departments to track assets is not a problem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/articles/view?4198 |title=Good and Bad News About RFID in Hospitals |publisher=RFID Journal |date= |accessdate=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the case of ”keeping at a reasonable distance” might be still an open question for the RTLS technology adopters and providers in medical facilities.

In many applications it is very difficult and at the same time important to make a proper choice among various communication technologies (e.g., RFID, WiFi, etc.) which RTLS may include. Wrong design decision made at early stages can lead to catastrophic results for the system and a significant loss of money for fixing and redesign. To solve this problem a special methodology for RTLS design space exploration was developed. It consists of such steps as modelling, requirements specification and verification into a single efficient process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ntv.ifmo.ru/en/article/13659/metodika_izucheniya_prostranstva_proektnyh_resheniydlya_sistem_pozicionirovaniya_obektov_v_realnom_vremeni.htm|title=A methodology for design space exploration of real-time location systems.|author1=Kirov D.A. |author2=Passerone R. |author3=Ozhiganov A.A. |journal=Scientific and Technical Journal of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics|volume=15|issue=4|pages=551–567 |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Software development process}}

'''Scrumban''' is an [[Agile software development|Agile]] management methodology describing hybrids of [[Scrum (software development)|Scrum]] and [[Kanban (development)|Kanban]] and was originally designed as a way to transition from [[Scrum (software development)|Scrum]] to [[Kanban (development)|Kanban]]. Today, Scrumban is a management framework that emerges when teams employ Scrum as their chosen way of working and use the Kanban Method as a lens through which to view, understand and continuously improve how they work.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ladas|first1=Corey|title=Scrum-ban|website=Lean Software Engineering|url=http://leansoftwareengineering.com/ksse/scrum-ban/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reddy|first1=Ajay|title=Scrumban [R]Evolution- Get the most out of Agile, Scrum and Lean Kanban |website=Pearson|url=http://www.informit.com/store/scrumban-revolution-getting-the-most-out-of-agile-scrum-9780134086217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
As the [[Kanban (development)|Kanban]] method was becoming more popular {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}, Scrumban was developed  &lt;ref&gt; Ladas, Corey (January 2009). Scrumban: Essays on Kanban Systems for Lean Software Development. Modus Cooperandi Press. {{ISBN|978-0578002149}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an attempt to make it easier for existing [[Scrum (software development)|Scrum]] teams to begin exploring [[Lean software development|Lean]] and [[Kanban (development)|Kanban]] concepts {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}.

The first article on Scrumban, which uses the spelling "Scrum-ban", describes several levels to transition from [[Scrum (software development)|Scrum]] to [[Kanban (development)|Kanban]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Fundamentally, Scrumban is a management framework that emerges when teams employ Scrum as their chosen way of working and use the Kanban Method as a lens through which to view, understand and continuously improve how they work.

Scrumban is distinct from Scrum in the way it emphasizes certain principles and practices that are substantially different from Scrum's traditional foundation. Among these are:

* recognizing the important role of organizational management (self-organization remains an objective but within the context of specific boundaries)
* allowing for specialized teams and functions
* applying explicit policies around ways of working
* applying the laws of flow and queuing theory
* deliberate economic prioritization&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
Scrumban is distinct from the Kanban Method in that it:

* prescribes an underlying software development process framework (Scrum) as its core
* is organized around teams
* recognizes the value of time-boxed iterations when appropriate
* formalizes continuous improvement techniques within specific ceremonies&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
Perhaps most importantly, the principles and practices embedded within Scrumban are not unique to the software development process. They can be easily applied in many different contexts, providing a common language and shared experience across interrelated business functions. This, in turn, enhances the kind of organizational alignment that is an essential characteristic of success.

==A Framework for [R]Evolution==
{{Copypaste|section|url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2431512&amp;WT.mc_id=Author_Reddy_Scrumban|date=October 2017}}
When Corey Ladas introduced the world to Scrumban in his seminal book of that name,&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite book
  | title =Scrumban: Essays on Kanban Systems for Lean Software Development
  | last =Ladas
  | first =Corey 
  | publisher = Modus Cooperandi Press
  |date=January 2009 
  |isbn = 978-0578002149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he defined it as a transition method for moving software development teams from Scrum to a “more evolved” software development framework. In actual practice, however, Scrumban has itself evolved to become a family of principles and practices that create complementary capabilities unique from both Scrum and the Kanban Method. These capabilities have led to three distinct manifestations:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

* As a framework that helps teams and organizations effectively adopt Scrum as a development methodology.
* As a framework that helps teams and organizations overcome a variety of common challenges scaling Scrum across the Enterprise.
* As a framework that helps teams and organizations develop their own set of Scrum-based processes and practices that work best for them—not to accommodate inadequacies and dysfunctions Scrum exposed, but to resolve them in a manner that was most effective for their unique environment.

==The Method==
In Scrumban, the teamwork is organized in small iterations and monitored with the help of a visual board, similar to Scrum and [[kanban board]]s. To illustrate each stage of work, teams working in the same space often use post-it notes or a large whiteboard. In the case of decentralized teams, visual management software such as [[Assembla]], [[Targetprocess]], [[Eylean Board]], [[Jira (software)|JIRA]], [[Mingle]] or [[Agilo for Trac]] are often used.[http://www.infoq.com/articles/book-review-scrumban-revolution]  Planning meetings are held to determine what user stories to complete in the next iteration. The user stories are then added to the board and the team completes them, the team working on a few user stories at a time as practical (the work-in-progress, or WIP, limit). To keep iterations short, WIP limits are thus used, and a planning trigger is set in place for the team to know when to plan next - when WIP falls below a predetermined level. There are no predefined roles in Scrumban; the team keeps the roles they already have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vasiliauskas|first1=Vidas|title=Scrumban - mixing agile and lean|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaNHFsFz7Yw|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iterations===
Work iterations in Scrumban are kept short. This ensures that a team can easily adapt and change their course of action to a quickly changing environment. The length of the iteration is measured in weeks. The ideal length of an iteration depends on the work process of each team, and it is recommended not to have iterations exceeding two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Don|first1=Wells|title=Iterative Planning|url=http://www.agile-process.org/iterative.html|website=Agile Process|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Velocity (a measure of productivity) is often used by the team to assess issues and trends in its throughput, in order to support continuous improvement.

===On-demand planning===
The planning in Scrumban is based on demand and occurs only when the planning trigger goes off. The planning trigger is associated with the number of tasks left in the "To Do" section of the board - when it goes down to a certain number, the planning event is held. The number of tasks that should trigger a planning event is not predefined. It depends on a team's velocity (how quickly it can finish the remaining tasks) and on the time required to plan the next iteration. The tasks planned for the next iteration are added to the "To Do" section of the board.

===Prioritization===
It is recommended to prioritize tasks during the planning event. This means the tasks are added to the board with marked priorities. It helps the team members to know which tasks should be completed first and which can be completed later. The prioritization can be done by adding numbers to the tasks or by adding an additional priority column, where the most important tasks are put at the top and the less important tasks below.

===Bucket size planning===
[[File:Bucket size planning.jpg|framed|right]]
Bucket size planning brings the possibility of long-term planning to Scrumban. It is based on the system of three buckets that the work items need to go through before making it on the Scrumban board. The three buckets represent three different stages of the plan and are usually called 1-year, 6-month and 3-month buckets. The 1-year bucket is dedicated for long-term goals that the company has, like penetrating a new market, releasing new product, etc. When the company decides to move forward with a plan, it is moved to the 6-month bucket, where the main requirements of this plan are crystallized. When a company is ready to start implementing the plan, the requirements are moved into the 3-month bucket and divided into clear tasks to be completed by the project team. It is from this bucket that the team draws tasks during their on-demand planning meeting and starts working on the tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miseviciute|first1=D.|title=Scrumban: on demand vs. long-term planning|url=http://www.eylean.com/blog/2014/11/scrumban-on-demand-vs-long-term-planning/|website=Eylean Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The board===
[[File:Simple-kanban-board-.jpg|thumb|400px|right|A simple kanban board]]The basic Scrumban board is composed out of three columns: To Do, Doing and Done. After the planning meeting, the tasks are added to the To Do column, when a team member is ready to work on a task, he/she moves it to the Doing column and when he/she completes it, he/she moves it to the Done column. The Scrumban board visually represents the progress of the team. The task board columns are adapted and expanded based on the team's work progress. The most common add-ons include priority columns in the To Do section and columns like Design, Manufacturing, Testing in the Doing section.

'''WIP limits -- '''
To ensure that the team is working effectively, Scrumban methodology states that a team member should be working on no more than one task at a time. To make sure this rule is followed Scrumban uses WIP (work in progress) limit. This limit is visualized on top of the Doing section of the board (also could be on each column of that section) and means that only that number of tasks can be in the corresponding column at one time. A WIP limit usually is equal to the number of people in the team but could be expanded based on the specifics of the team's work.

'''To Do limits --'''
In order to have more productive planning meetings, the number of tasks in the To Do section can be limited as well. The same as with WIP limits, it is written at the top of the To Do section or on top of the corresponding columns and limits the number of tasks in the To Do section or specific columns.

===The team===
Scrumban does not require any specific number of team members or team roles. The roles a team has prior to adopting Scrumban are kept when implementing Scrumban. They are reinforced by team members having to choose the tasks to complete themselves. The team roles in Scrumban are more specialized and less cross-functional than what is expected in scrum teams.

===Pull principle===
In Scrumban tasks are not assigned to the team members by the team leader or project manager. Each team member chooses which task from the To Do section they are going to complete next. This guarantees a smooth process flow, where all the team members are equally busy at all times.

===Feature freeze===
Feature freeze is used in Scrumban when the project deadline is approaching. It means that only the features that the team already has for development can still be worked on and no additional features can be added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feature Freeze|url=https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/FeatureFreeze|website=OpenStack|publisher=OpenStack|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Triage===
Triage usually happens right after feature freeze. With an approaching project deadline, the project manager decides which of the in-development features will be completed and which will stay unfinished. This guarantees that the team can focus on finishing important features before the project deadline and forget the less important ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Software Triage|url=http://www.stickyminds.com/article/software-triage|website=Sticky Minds|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terms==
* '''Bucket size planning''' long-term planning approach in Scrumban, which is based on moving the plans through a few steps.
* '''Lead and cycle time''' the time that is taken from task creation or beginning work on a task to its completion.
* '''On demand planning''' planning technique that is executed only when there is a need for new tasks on the board.

==Tooling==
Like other methods, Scrumban can be implemented with a help of various tools. The most basic Scrumban implementation is a physical whiteboard with sticky notes. [[Project management software|Electronic solutions]], similar to scrum and kanban electronic boards are available as well. They offer a full automation of the board, where it only has to be updated by the team members. Electronic boards often also provide automatic reports, the possibility of attachments and discussions on tasks, time tracking, as well as integrations with other commonly used project management software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scrumban|url=http://www.eylean.com/scrum#Scrum-ban|website=Eylean Board|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3339">The '''Spotswood sewer tunnel''' is a [[sanitary sewer]] [[tunnel]] in [[Melbourne, Victoria]]. It was constructed in 1895 to take sewerage under the [[Yarra River]] to the [[Spotswood Pumping Station]], where it was pumped to the [[Werribee Sewage Farm]].&lt;ref name=VicHer&gt;[http://vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au/vhd/heritagevic/?timeout=yes#detail_places;11868 Werribee Sewage Farm Victorian Heritage Database, Heritage Victoria]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works]] (MMBW) was created in 1892 and appointed eminent British engineer [[James Mansergh]] to advise on a suitable system. However, local engineer [[William Thwaites (engineer)|William Thwaites]] was responsible for the design and construction. The system included sewer mains from the Melbourne CBD and southeastern suburbs extending across [[Fishermans Bend]] to a point opposite the pumping station. A tunneling shield was imported from Britain, to the design of British engineer James Henry Greathead. This was a 3.4 metres diameter cylindrical shield made of cast iron and steel plate. It was driven into the soft clays by hydraulic rams and maintained at two to three times atmospheric pressure to inhibit groundwater inflow with an airlock to allow miners to enter and exit. Cast-iron ring segments were bolted behind the shield as it advanced and then the tunnel was lined with 30 centimeters of concrete.&lt;ref name=VicHer/&gt;

On the night 12 April 1895 (Good Friday), the shield failed and the river flooded into the tunnel drowning a young engineer and five workers. Three other men were waiting to enter through the air lock, and saw the incident through a small thick glass window, but were unable to do anything. Thousands of tons of clay were dumped in the riverbed to seal the hole and the tunnel pumped out. the bodies were recovered and work resumed under a new contractor. The river tunnel was finally completed 12 months later.&lt;ref&gt;[https://museumvictoria.com.au/scienceworks/discoverycentre/pumpingstation/the-buildings/tunnelling-triumph/ 'Tunnelling Triumph' Spotswood Pumping Station, Museum Victoria]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''technology demonstration''' or '''demonstrator model''', informally known as a '''tech demo''', is a [[prototype]], rough example or an otherwise incomplete version of a conceivable product or future system, put together as [[proof of concept]] with the primary purpose of showcasing the possible applications, feasibility, performance and method of an idea for a new technology. They can be used as demonstrations to the [[investor]]s, partners, journalists or even to potential customers in order to convince them of the viability of the chosen approach, or to test them on ordinary users.

==Computers and gaming==
Technology demonstrations are often used in the [[computer]] industry, emerging as an important tool in response to short development cycles, in both software and hardware development.

* [[Computer game]] developers use tech demos to rouse and maintain interest to titles still in development (because [[game engine]]s are usually ready before the art is finished) and to ensure functionality by early testing. Short segments using finished game engines may be presented as [[game demo]]s.
* [[Graphics card]]s manufacturers use tech demos to showcase the performance of their cards even before there are any games that can deliver that performance or before the product is ready to be used outside of the development labs. In November 2002, [[Nvidia]] started the practice of featuring realistic female characters in graphics card technology demos, by releasing [http://www.nvidia.com/coolstuff/demos#!/geforce-fx/dawn Dawn] for its [[GeForce FX]] card. The demo featured a scantily-clad forest [[fairy]] with semi-realistic short hair and beautiful wings. Later Nvidia followed with similar, new demos and [[ATI Technologies]] joined the race.
* Being by nature much less complex than complete games (that have to include dynamic physics modelling, audio engines, etc.), technology demos for graphics can deliver substantially better image quality, making the general look of games lag several years behind video card technology demos. For example, the [[PlayStation 2]] demos ''Namco Girl'' (a lifelike female character from ''[[Ridge Racer]]'' winking flirtatiously at viewers) and ''old man'' used all the processing power to produce a high-quality single character model, in a static environment. [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] trailers also showed Raven, a buff woman and her robot, showing off [[martial art]] moves.

Computer technology demos should not be confused with [[demoscene]]-based [[demo (computer programming)|demos]], which, although often demonstrating new software techniques, are regarded as a stand-alone form of computer art.

===Google Tech Demo===
'''Demo Slam''', a website from [[Google Inc]]., as launched with the slogan "Bring your creativity. Bring your tech. Just bring it in general, fool! Demo Slam is here!", is a large collection of technology demonstrations uploaded by users, and some of the Google executives as well, which will go to the 'Contender'.

===Sales engineering technology demonstration===
[[Sales Engineer]]ing staff, often bearing the title [[Sales Engineer]] or Presales Consultant, will prepare technology demonstrations for business meetings or seminars to show capabilities of business products. This can include both software and hardware products, and can show multiple products integrating together.  Usually a demonstration is less than a [[Proof of concept]], but can come some of the way to showing how a business project may be justified. Large companies with tens or hundreds of [[Sales Engineer]]s will often have a team who specialize in the production of demonstration systems and plans.

'''''The Misadventures of Merlin Jones''''' is a 1964 [[Walt Disney]] production starring [[Tommy Kirk]] and [[Annette Funicello]].  Kirk plays a college student who experiments with mind-reading and hypnotism, leading to run-ins with a local judge.  Funicello plays his girlfriend (and sings the film's title song, accompanied by Disneyland's very own harmony quartet, The Yachtsmen, written by brothers [[Robert and Richard Sherman]]).

This film led to a 1965 sequel called ''[[The Monkey's Uncle]]''.

==Plot==
[[Midvale Colege|Midvale College]] student Merlin Jones ([[Tommy Kirk]]), who is always involved with mind experiments, designs a helmet that connects to an [[electroencephalographic]] tape that records mental activity. He is brought before Judge Holmsby ([[Leon Ames]]) for wearing the helmet while driving and his license is suspended. Merlin returns to the lab and discovers accidentally that his new invention enables him to read minds.

Judge Holmsby visits the diner where Merlin works part-time, and Merlin, through his newly found powers, learns that the judge is planning a crime. After informing the police, he is disregarded as a crackpot. Merlin and Jennifer ([[Annette Funicello]]), his girlfriend, break into Judge Holmsby's house looking for something to prove Holmsby's criminal intent but are arrested by the police. Holmsby then confesses that he is the crime book author, "Lex Fortis," and asks that this identity be kept confidential. 

Merlin's next experiment uses [[hypnotism]]. After hypnotizing Stanley, Midvale's lab chimp, into standing up for himself against Norman ([[Norm Grabowski]]) - the bully student in charge of caring for Stanley, Merlin gets into a fight with Norman, and is brought before Judge Holmsby again. Intrigued by Merlin's experiments, the judge asks for Merlin's help in constructing a mystery plot for his next book. 

Working on the premise that no honest person can be made to do anything they wouldn’t do otherwise – especially commit a crime – Merlin hypnotizes Holmsby and instructs him to kidnap Stanley. Shocked when the judge actually commits the crime, Merlin and Jennifer return the chimp, but are charged for the theft themselves. The judge sentences Merlin to jail, completely unaware of his own role in the crime. Livid at the injustice, Jennifer persuades Holmsby of his own guilt, and the good judge admits that there might be a little dishonesty in everybody.

==Production notes==
The screen credit for writing reads, "Screenplay by Tom and Helen August", which were the pseudonyms for [[Alfred Lewis Levitt]] and [[Helen Slote Levitt|Helen Levitt]], two writers who were [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/vstory/VR1117434876.html?categoryid=38&amp;cs=1 ''Variety'', April 3, 1997]&lt;/ref&gt;

To date Disney has not officially stated whether or not this film was actually two episodes of a planned television series, but this has long been suspected to be the case,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scifilm.org/musing2741.html SciFilm.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201185709/http://scifilm.org/musing2741.html |date=2010-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with at least one critic, Eugene Archer, of ''The New York Times'', writing upon its release: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"Movies made for television are commonplace these days, but the idea of screening television shows in movie theaters is still farfetched. Who is expected to spend the $2? Strange as it sounds, this seems to be the explanation behind Walt Disney's latest hit, "The Misadventures of Merlin Jones." It is a pastiche of two separate stories with the same set of characters, each running less than an hour (leaving time for commercials), stitched together in the middle and released yesterday in neighborhood theaters." &lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9906E2D71230E033A25755C2A9659C946591D6CF ''The New York Times'', March 26, 1964]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8050">A '''travel plan''' is a package of actions designed by a workplace, school or other organisation to encourage [[safety|safe]], [[public health|healthy]] and [[sustainability|sustainable]] travel options.  By reducing [[car travel]], travel plans can improve health and wellbeing, free up car parking space, and make a positive contribution to the community and the environment. Every travel plan is different, but most successful plans have followed a structured process&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ltsa.govt.nz/sustainable-transport/travel-behaviour-change/workplace-travel-plans/docs/overview-travel-plan-process.pdf Travel Plan process overview (Land Transport NZ, NZ)]&lt;/ref&gt; in their development:

The term has now largely replaced '''green transport plan''' as the accepted UK term for a concept, which first emerged in the US in the 1970s (as '''site-based transportation demand management''') and subsequently transferred to the Netherlands in 1989, where the terms '''company or commuter mobility management''' were applied.

==Features==

From the above and other definitions, these common features underpin the concept:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashgate.com/default.aspx?page=637&amp;calcTitle=1&amp;title_id=9277&amp;edition_id=9562 Sustainable Transport, Mobility Management and Travel Plans, Ashgate, Farnham, 2012, Enoch M P]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Travel plans are not really an instrument themselves but a delivery mechanism or strategy for other mostly transport-focused measures.
*Travel plans are delivered by an additional 'agent' that is not a part of the 'traditional' transport policy institutional structure.
*Travel plans are initiated in two ways by the organisation or by the government.
*Travel plans seek to deliver transport and related benefits to the community as well as some more direct organisational benefits to the participating 'delivery agents'.
*Travel plans are, to some extent, site-specific and so tailored to the specific contextual circumstances.
*Travel plans deliver, to some extent, a package or a strategy of a wide variety of transport instruments.

They can work well the 'package approach' allows complementary tools to be implemented in one go, which means effective but unpopular tools (such as parking restrictions) can be introduced alongside popular but expensive tools (like bus subsidies) to deliver the required benefits whilst cancelling out the negative impacts. Next, the use of the additional 'agent' such as a workplace, school or even a [[football club]] which means that travel plans replace the largely negative relationship between local authorities and citizens{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} with a more positive relationship (such as between employer and employee or between school and parent/pupil). Finally, the site l-specific nature of travel plans means they are developed at the neighbourhood level and so focus directly on the transport needs of the users in that local area.
 
The concept works by developing balanced packages of user-focused transport tools in a partnership that seeks to provide meaningful benefits to each of the stakeholders involved: improved travel choices to the individuals; cost savings, happier and healthier staff and better company image to the implementing organisations; additional business opportunities to service providers and congestion reduction and improved air quality to the government.

==Workplace==
The UK [[Department for Transport]] defines workplace travel plans as a package of measures produced by employers to encourage staff to use alternatives to single-occupancy car use. The first travel Ppans in the UK were adopted in [[Nottingham]] by [[Nottinghamshire]] County Council in 1995.  Travel plans are now common in the UK, and are starting to become more common in many places throughout Europe as well as in Australia and New Zealand.

A workplace can choose to develop a travel plan at any time be required to develop a travel plan as a condition of planning consent for an expansion or new development. Typical actions in a workplace travel plan include improving facilities for pedestrians and cyclists (showers, lockers and cycle parking), promotion and subsidy of public transport, and encouraging carpooling, working from home and teleconferencing.

==School==
Making it safer and easier for children to walk, cycle or catch public transport to school has long-term health benefits, reduces air pollution and traffic congestion, and helps children arrive at school awake, refreshed and ready to learn. 

Because of the many benefits, local councils in the UK, Australia and New Zealand are actively involved in helping schools to develop and implement travel plans. In Canada, a national pilot project running from 2010 to 2012 is designed to bring stakeholders together to build school travel plans collaboratively. Typical actions in a school travel plan include promoting the health benefits of walking, providing more or better pedestrian crossings, tighter enforcement of parking and traffic rules around the school, providing cycle training, and setting up a [[walking school bus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walkingschoolbus.org Walking School Bus website]&lt;/ref&gt; School travel planning groups like Green Communities Canada also work on a policy level to encourage multi-tiered governmental policies that support active travel.

===Framework===
A framework travel plan may be used for [[speculative development]] such as a business park where the occupiers of buildings are not known&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.hants.gov.uk/workplacetravel/information_for_developers/frameworktravelplans.htm&lt;/ref&gt; or where there will be multiple occupiers (such as a shared office block).

==Other organisations==

There are many examples of successful travel plans for tertiary campuses.  Successful tertiary travel plans are usually prepared with the assistance of the local public transport agency. As well as the initiatives listed for school or workplace travel plans, tertiary travel plans can include a [[Universal Transit Pass|U-pass]] system for student travel on public transport.  

The development of travel plans for hospitals is a relatively new and interesting field of travel planning.

===Planning consent===

A real-estate developer may be required to provide a travel plan as a condition to gaining planning consent. A typical travel plan for a new development will provide for the promotion of sustainable transport through marketing initiatives and for contributions to public transport and to walking and [[cycling infrastructure]]. In the UK, a travel plan can form part of a [[Section 106 agreement]], under the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1990]].

[[File:38999 connector nickel-teflon.jpg|thumb|400px|MIL-DTL-38999 [[circular connector]] (receptacle and plug) plated with a nickel-teflon composite.]]

[[Electrical connector|Connectors]] used by [[U.S. Department of Defense]] were originally developed in the 1930s for severe aeronautical and tactical service applications, and the Type "AN" [[Joint Electronics Type Designation System|(Army-Navy)]] series set the standard for modern military [[circular connectors]]. These connectors, and their evolutionary derivatives, are often called [[United States Military Standard|'''Military Standard''']], "'''MIL-STD'''", or (informally) "'''MIL-SPEC'''" or sometimes "'''MS'''" connectors. They are now used in aerospace, industrial, marine, and even automotive commercial applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ittcannon.com/uploadedFiles/Product_PDFs/History.pdf |title=''History Brochure: Cannon, VEAM, BIW — A Historical Achievement of Technology Leadership'' |publisher=ITT Interconnect Solutions |date=October 2008 |accessdate=2012-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309015738/http://www.ittcannon.com/uploadedFiles/Product_PDFs/History.pdf |archivedate=9 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==

Connectors usually consist of (i) a mating pair (plug and receptacle) each equipped with male (''pin'') or female (''socket'') contacts; note that at least one of the connector halves, or its contacts, should be floating to minimize [[stress (mechanics)|mechanical stresses]].&lt;ref&gt;Terms denoted in italics are names in general usage and are not always appropriate nomenclature for some connector designs, e.g. flat male and flat female contacts are called "blade" contacts, not "pins and sockets".&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Electrical connector]] contacts are typically [[Beryllium copper]] (BeCu) or [[Phosphor bronze]] which is then plated with [[gold]] or some other non-corrosive, highly-conductive metal. The contacts are contained by a [[dielectric]] insulator (typically a layered construct of various polymers or glass depending upon connector series and manufacturer,  and often known as the insert) and are housed in an enclosure (i.e., shell), that is often [[Die casting|die-cast]] aluminum and [[plating|plated]] or [[anodized]] for [[corrosion]] protection. The contacts may be captive or removable using a special tool. The electrical connection into the system at the contact terminal is either a [[Soldering|soldered]] or [[Crimp (joining)|crimped]] connection. The seal between the shell and insert may be moisture resistant or a [[hermetic seal]]. The inserts in each connector half must be oriented for correct mating, and the shell or insert usually contains a keying feature to prevent mis-mating that could damage the connector or result in an electrical problem. Cable clamps and other mounting hardware may be provided, and the mated halves are usually secured by a locking mechanism to prevent disengagements.
*[[Optical fiber connector|Fiber optic connectors]] are typically plugs or so-called male connectors with a protruding ferrule that holds the fibers and aligns two fibers for mating. They use a mating adapter to mate the two connectors that fits the securing mechanism of the connectors (bayonet, screw-on or snap-in.) A primary specification issue for fiber optic connectors is [[insertion loss]], i.e., the amount of light lost in the connection expressed in dB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefoa.org/tech/connID.htm |title=''Fiber Optic Splicing and Termination - Connectors'' |publisher=[[The Fiber Optic Association (FOA)|The Fiber Optic Association, Inc]].  |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The connector meets demanding applications and harsh environments and it is mechanically robust and durable, with low contact resistance, high current capability and high dielectric strength, and it has an excellent resistance to shock and vibration, while offering a high pin density, small size and lightweight body. Often referred to as a ''Micro-D connector system'', the connector is  suited to a multitude of systems where weight, miniaturization or signal transmission integrity are paramount, such as missiles and their guidance systems, aerospace [[avionics]], [[radar]]s, shoulder-launched weapon systems, advanced soldier technology systems, military [[Global Positioning System]]s, satellites, medical devices and [[Down-the-hole drill|down-hole drilling]] tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microd-connectors.com/pdf/04_brochures/D-LINE_P003_028_General.pdf |title=''Brochure, AXON' D-Line Connectors — General Information — MIL-DTL-83513 connectors''|publisher=Axon |date=6 June 2010 |accessdate=2012-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The insert arrangements are provided in the associated specification sheets. The Micro-D formfactor has become so popular among engineers and systems designers that many manufacturers have begun to offer high speed (up to 10Gbps) and modular versions of the connector.

A '''wheat lamp''' is a type of [[incandescent light]] designed for use in [[underground mining]], named for inventor [[Grant Wheat]] and manufactured by [[Koehler Lighting Products]] in [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]], [[United States]], a region known for extensive mining activity.&lt;ref name="Marlborough"/&gt;

A [[safety lamp]] designed for use in potentially hazardous atmospheres such as [[firedamp]] and [[coal dust]], the lamp is mounted on the front of the [[miner's helmet]] and powered by a [[wet cell battery]] worn on the miner's belt. The average wheat lamp uses a 3-5 [[watt]] bulb which will typically operate for 5 to 16 hours depending on the [[amp-hour]] capacity of the battery and the [[electric current|current draw]] of the bulb being used.

A '''grain of wheat lamp''' is an unrelated, very small [[light bulb|incandescent lamp]] used in medical and optical instruments, as well as for illuminating [[miniature railroad]] and similar models.

'''xvYCC''' or Extended-[[gamut]] [[YCbCr|YCC]] (also '''x.v.Color''') is a [[color space]] that can be used in the [[video]] electronics of television sets to support a [[gamut]] 1.8 times as large as that of the [[sRGB color space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year=2006 | url=http://www.hdmi.org/pdf/HDMI_Insert_FINAL_8-30-06.pdf | title=HDMI 1.3 Update | work=[[HDMI Licensing]] | accessdate=2006-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; xvYCC was proposed by [[Sony]],&lt;ref name=SonyGlobal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/technology/technology/theme/xvycc_01.html |title=xvYCC |publisher=Sony Global |accessdate=2009-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829145618/http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/technology/technology/theme/xvycc_01.html |archivedate=August 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; specified by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] in October 2005 and published in January 2006 as [[list of IEC standards|IEC 61966-2-4]].

xvYCC was motivated by the fact that modern display and capture technologies often have underlying [[RGB]] primaries with significantly higher saturation than the traditional [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] displays, allowing them to handle a wider color gamut. But these devices have been unable to do this without upsetting basic calibration, as all existing video storage and transmission systems are based on CRT primaries, and are hence limited to the CRT gamut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | url=http://data.memberclicks.com/site/hopa/2007_xvYCC_forHPA_FINAL.pdf | title="New" Extended-gamut Color Space for Video Applications; xvYCC (IEC61966-2-4) | author=Naoya Katoh | conference=Hollywood Post Alliance | year=2007 | accessdate=2009-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

xvYCC-encoded video retains the same color primaries and white point as [[Rec. 709|BT.709]], and uses either a [[BT.601]] or BT.709 RGB-to-YCC conversion matrix and encoding.&lt;ref name=SonyGlobal/&gt; This allows it to travel through existing digital YCC data paths, and any colors within the normal gamut will be compatible.&lt;ref name=SonyGlobal/&gt;

The xvYCC color space permits YCC values that, while within the encoding range of YCC, have chroma values outside the range 16–240, or that correspond to negative RGB values, and hence would not have previously been valid.&lt;ref name=SonyGlobal/&gt; These are used to encode more saturated colors.&lt;ref name=SonyGlobal/&gt; For example, a cyan that lies outside the basic gamut of the primaries can be encoded as "green plus blue minus red".&lt;ref name=SonyGlobal/&gt;

These extra-gamut colors can then be displayed by a device whose underlying technology is not limited by the standard primaries.&lt;ref name=SonyGlobal/&gt;

In a paper published by [[Society for Information Display]] in 2006, the authors mapped the 769 colors in the [[Munsell color system|Munsell Color Cascade]] to the BT.709 space and to the xvYCC space.  55% of the Munsell colors could be mapped to the sRGB [[gamut]], but 100% of those colors could map to the xvYCC gamut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|doi=10.1889/1.2433175

|publisher=Society for Information Display}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Deeper hues can be created – for example a deeper red by giving the opposing color (cyan) a negative coefficient.

A mechanism for signaling xvYCC support and transmitting the gamut boundary definition for xvYCC has been defined in the [[HDMI]] 1.3 Specification. No new mechanism is required for transmitting the xvYCC data itself, as it is compatible with HDMI's existing [[YCbCr]] formats, but the display needs to signal its readiness to accept the extra-gamut xvYCC values, and the source needs to signal the actual gamut in use to help the display to intelligently adapt extreme colors to its own gamut limitations.

This should not be confused with HDMI 1.3's other new color feature, [[deep color]]. This is a separate feature that increases the precision of brightness and color information, and is independent of xvYCC.

xvYCC is not supported by [[DVD-Video]] but is supported by the high-definition recording format [[AVCHD]] and [[PlayStation 3]].

On January 7, 2013, Sony announced that it would release "Mastered in 4K" [[Blu-ray Disc]] titles which are sourced at 4K and encoded at [[1080p]].&lt;ref name=SonyMastered4K2013JanuaryEngadget&gt;{{cite news |title=Sony to launch 4K digital distribution network this summer, 'mastered in 4K' Blu-ray discs |author=Richard Lawler |publisher=[[Engadget]] |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/01/07/sony-4k-distribution-service/ |date=2013-01-07 |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Mastered in 4K" Blu-ray Disc titles can be played on existing Blu-ray Disc players and will support a larger color space using xvYCC.&lt;ref name=SonyMastered4K2013JanuaryEngadget/&gt;&lt;ref name=SonyMastered4K2013MayCNET&gt;{{cite news |title=Sony 'mastered in 4K' Blu-rays a mixed blessing |author=Seamus Byrne |publisher=[[CNET]] |url=http://www.cnet.com.au/sony-mastered-in-4k-blu-rays-a-mixed-blessing-339344100.htm |date=2013-05-01 |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{hatnote|Not to be confused with the [[yardland]] or [[yard of land]].}}
[[File:Typical suburban backyard.jpg|thumb|A subdivision ''backyard'' (American English)]]

A '''yard''' is an  area of land immediately adjacent to a [[building]] or a group of buildings. It may be either enclosed or open.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/yard?s=t "Yard"], [[Random House Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; The word comes from the same linguistic root as the word ''[[garden]]'' and has many of the same meanings. 

A number of derived words exist, usually tied to a particular usage or building type. Some may be archaic or in lesser use now. Examples of such words are: [[courtyard]], [[barnyard]], [[hops|hopyard]], [[graveyard]], [[churchyard]], [[brickyard]], [[Prison#common facilities|prison yard]], [[railyard]], [[wrecking yard|junkyard]] and [[stableyard]].

==Word origin==
The word "yard" came from the [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''geard'', compare "garden" (German ''Garten''), [[Old Norse]] ''garðr'', Russian ''gorod'' = "town" (originally as an "''enclosed'' fortified area"), Latin ''hortus'' = "garden" (hence horticulture and orchard), from Greek χορτος (chortos) = "farm-yard", "feeding-place", "fodder", (from which "[[hay]]" originally as grown in an enclosed field). "Girdle," and "court" are other related words from the same root.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/231200 |title=yard, n.1|work= [[OED Online]]|year=December 2011|publisher= Oxford University Press|accessdate= February 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Portable yards.JPG|thumb|Portable cattle yards]]In areas where farming is an important part of life, a yard is also a piece of enclosed land for farm animals or other agricultural purpose, often referred to as a cattleyard, sheepyard, stockyard, etc. In Australia portable or mobile yards are sets of transportable steel panels used to build temporary stockyards.&lt;ref&gt;Livestock Handling Made Easy, Arrow Farmquip, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application of the term ==
{{main|front yard|back yard}}
In [[North America]] and [[Australasia]] today, a yard can be any part of a property surrounding or associated with a house or other residential structure, usually (although not necessarily) separate from a [[garden]] (where plant maintenance is more formalized). A yard will typically consist mostly of [[lawn]] or play area. The yard in front of a house is referred to as a front yard, the area at the rear is known as a backyard. Backyards are generally more private and are thus a more common location for recreation. Yard size varies with population density. In urban centres, many houses have very small or even no yards at all. In the suburbs, yards are generally much larger and have room for such amenities as a [[patio]], a [[playplace]] for children, or a [[swimming pool]]. 

In [[British English]], these areas would usually be described as a ''[[garden]]'', similarly subdivided into a ''[[front garden]]'' and a ''[[back garden]]'', although paved areas may be called a yard, but more usually a [[patio]]. In modern [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the term yard is often used for depots and land adjacent to or among workplace buildings, as well as uncultivated land adjoining a building.

In North America, the term "garden" refers only to the area that contains plots of vegetables, herbs, flowers, and/or ornamental plants; and the term "yard" does not refer to the "garden", although the flower garden or vegetable garden may be within the yard.

'''Zinc telluride''' is a binary [[chemical compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] ZnTe.  This solid is a [[semiconductor material]] with a direct [[band gap]] of 2.26 [[electronvolt|eV]].&lt;ref name=CRC2/&gt; It is usually a [[p-type semiconductor]]. Its [[crystal structure]] is [[cubic crystal system|cubic]], like that for [[sphalerite]] and [[diamond]].&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;

==Properties==
[[File:ZnTe-STM2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Scanning tunneling microscopy|STM]] images of the ZnTe(110) surface, taken at different resolutions and sample rotation, together with its atomic model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/1468-6996/16/1/015002| title = Dynamic probe of ZnTe(110) surface by scanning tunneling microscopy| journal = Science and Technology of Advanced Materials| volume = 16| pages = 015002| year = 2015| last1 = Kanazawa | first1 = K. | last2 = Yoshida | first2 = S. | last3 = Shigekawa | first3 = H. | last4 = Kuroda | first4 = S. | type= free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
ZnTe has the appearance of grey or brownish-red powder, or ruby-red crystals when refined by sublimation. Zinc telluride typically had a cubic (sphalerite, or "[[zincblende]]") crystal structure, but can be also prepared as rocksalt crystals or in [[hexagonal (crystal system)|hexagonal]] crystals ([[wurtzite]] structure). Irradiated by a strong optical beam burns in presence of oxygen.  Its [[lattice constant]] is 0.6101&amp;nbsp;nm, allowing it to be grown with or on [[aluminium antimonide]], [[gallium antimonide]], [[indium arsenide]], and [[lead selenide]].  With some lattice mismatch, it can also be grown on other substrates such as [[GaAs]],&lt;ref&gt;O'Dell, Dakota (2010). [http://physics.nd.edu/assets/29003/o_dell_reu.pdf MBE Growth and Characterization of ZnTe and Nitrogen-doped ZnTe on GaAs(100) Substrates], Department of Physics, University of Notre Dame.&lt;/ref&gt; and it can be grown in thin-film [[polycrystalline]] (or nanocrystalline) form on substrates such as glass, for example, in the manufacture of [[thin-film solar cells]].  In the wurtzite (hexagonal) crystal structure, it has lattice parameters a = 0.427 and c = 0.699&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;Kittel, C. (1976) ''Introduction to Solid State Physics,'' 5th edition, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
===Optoelectronics===
Zinc telluride can be easily [[doping (semiconductor)|doped]], and for this reason it is one of the more common [[semiconducting]] materials used in [[optoelectronics]].  ZnTe is important for development of various [[semiconductor device]]s, including blue [[light-emitting diode|LEDs]], [[laser diode]]s, [[solar cell]]s, and components of [[microwave]] generators.   It can be used for [[solar cell]]s, for example, as a back-surface field layer and p-type semiconductor material for a [[Cadmium Telluride|CdTe]]/ZnTe structure&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.solmat.2007.04.006| title = Numerical modeling of CdS/Cd ''Te'' and CdS/Cd ''Te''/Zn ''Te'' solar cells as a function of Cd ''Te'' thickness| journal = Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells| volume = 91| issue = 13| pages = 1202| year = 2007| last1 = Amin | first1 = N. | last2 = Sopian | first2 = K. | last3 = Konagai | first3 = M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; or in [[PIN diode]] structures.

The material can also be used as a component of ternary semiconductor compounds, such as Cd&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;(1-x)&lt;/sub&gt;Te (conceptually a mixture composed from the end-members ZnTe and CdTe), which can be made with a varying composition x to allow the optical bandgap to be tuned as desired.

===Nonlinear optics===
Zinc telluride together with [[lithium niobate]] is often used for generation of pulsed [[terahertz radiation]] in [[TDTS|time-domain terahertz spectroscopy]] and [[terahertz imaging]]. When a crystal of such material is subjected to a high-intensity light pulse of subpicosecond duration, it emits a pulse of terahertz frequency through a [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear optical]] process called [[optical rectification]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101201021212/http://www.chem.yale.edu/~cas/ZnTe.html THz Generation and Detection in ZnTe]. chem.yale.edu&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, subjecting a zinc telluride crystal to terahertz radiation causes it to show optical [[birefringence]] and change the polarization of a transmitting light, making it an electro-optic detector.

[[Vanadium]]-doped zinc telluride, "ZnTe:V", is a non-linear optical [[photorefractive]] material of possible use in the protection of sensors at [[visible light|visible]] wavelengths. ZnTe:V optical limiters are light and compact, without complicated optics of conventional limiters. ZnTe:V can block a high-intensity jamming beam from a [[laser dazzler]], while still passing the lower-intensity image of the observed scene. It can also be used in [[holography|holographic]] [[interferometry]], in reconfigurable optical [[interconnection]]s, and in laser [[Nonlinear optics|optical phase conjugation]] devices. It offers superior photorefractive performance at wavelengths between 600–1300&amp;nbsp;nm, in comparison with other III-V and II-VI [[compound semiconductor]]s. By adding [[manganese]] as an additional dopant (ZnTe:V:Mn), its photorefractive yield can be significantly increased.
