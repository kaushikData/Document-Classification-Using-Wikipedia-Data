      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3967">'''Abstinence''' or the '''rule of abstinence''' is the principle of [[Psychoanalysis|analytic]] reticence and/or frustration within a clinical situation.  It is a central feature of [[psychoanalytic theory]] – relating especially to the handling of the [[transference]] in analysis.

As [[Freud]] wrote in 1914,&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in P. Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p. 302-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The cure must be carried through in abstinence.  I mean by that not physical self-denial alone, nor the denial of every desire....But I want to state the principle that one must permit neediness and yearning to remain as forces favoring work and change.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Later formulations==

The validity of the abstinence principle has been rediscovered and re-affirmed in a variety of subsequent analytic traditions.  
* [[Jacques Lacan]] re-formulated the principle via the concept of 'analytic [[Contract bridge|bridge]]' – the analyst necessarily playing the part of the unresponding dummy to bring the patient's unconscious motivations out into the open.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits'' (1997) p.  229-30&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Eric Berne]] saw analytic frustration as a means of avoiding playing a part in the patient's [[Script analysis|life script]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''What Do You Say After You Say Hello?'' (1974) p. 352&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[R. D. Laing]], in the context of the [[false self]] saw analytic abstinence operating in opposition to false self collusion: "It is in terms of basic frustration of the self's search for a collusive complement for false identity that Freud's dictum that analysis should be conducted under conditions of maximal frustration takes on its most cogent meaning".&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Laing, ''Self and Others'' (1969) p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[D. W. Winnicott]] in the context of his notion of 'holding' the patient emphasised that understanding through verbal interpretation gave a deeper sense of holding than the physical act, use of which by the therapist could blur the symbolic nature of the analytic space.&lt;ref&gt;P. Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1990) p. 96-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debates==
The rule of abstinence has come under increasing challenge by [[Interpersonal psychoanalysis|Interpersonal]] and [[Intersubjective psychoanalysis]],&lt;ref&gt;A. Fayek, ''The Crisis in Psychoanalysis'' (2009) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; concerned about the inflexibility of the rule, and the way its relentless application may provoke unnecessary hostility, even an [[iatrogenesis|iatrogenic]] [[transference neurosis]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Stolorow et al eds., ''The Intersubjective Perspective'' (1994) p. xi and p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

Defenders of the rule, against the practice of the warm supportive analyst, argue against the easy seductiveness of being overly 'helpful' in a self-defeating way already sketched out by Freud himself.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (1988) p. 124 and p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of optimal responsiveness – balancing frustration and gratification from moment to moment – offers some mediation in the dispute.&lt;ref&gt;S. Akhtar, ''Comprehensive Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'' (2009) A and O&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Burn Advocates Network''' (BAN) is a [[Non-profit organisation|non-profit organization]] that supports [[burn]] survivors as they face the challenges of recovery, rehabilitation, and reintegration. The organization operates 3 pediatric burn camps and a burn care network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://burnadvocates.org/our-mission/ Our Mission], Burn Advocates Network&lt;/ref&gt; BAN was founded in 2008 and expanded its international activity following the [[Haiti earthquake 2010|Haiti earthquake]], which left an estimated 1,000 burn survivors without proper care.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259697519_Disasters_the_2010_Haitian_earthquake_and_the_evacuation_of_burn_victims_to_US_burn_centers Disasters; the 2010 Haitian earthquake and the evacuation of burn victims to US burn centers.] Randy D.

==Operations==

Based in [[Teaneck, New Jersey|Teaneck New Jersey]], Burn Advocates Network operates 3 pediatric burn camps:

* '''Camp Sababa''' - Israel’s first burn camp, was founded in 2009 and operates in cooperation with Schneider Hospital for Children. Camp takes place in [[Kfar Galim]], a youth village outside of [[Haifa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/science/1.588236 At an Israeli Children's Camp, Burn Survivors Find Relief.] Haaretz, Alona Ferber, May 01, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMwcji7ZMDU Heal the Scars of the Heart.] Channel 10 News, Miki Haimovich, broadcast date: May 3, 2011. YouTube title: Camp Sababa - Israel's Channel 10 News Story (with subtitles)&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Camp Karma''' - India's first burn camp, was founded in 2013 and operates in cooperation [[KEM Hospital]]. Camp takes place in Rivergate Resort, outside of [[Mumbai]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2013/10/23/indias-first-burns-camp-for-kids/ India’s First Burns Camp for Kids.] The Wall Street Journal, Shreya Shah, Oct 23, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today there are approximately 60 burn camps worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20644489 Summer camps for children with burn injuries: a literature review]. Maslow GR,  Lobato D. Journal of Burn Care &amp; Research: September/October 2010 - Volume 31 - Issue 5 - pp 740-749&lt;/ref&gt; 31 of them based in the USA and registered at the International Association of Burn Camps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaburncamps.org/our-story/ Our Story], The International Association of Burn Camps (IABC)&lt;/ref&gt; Burn camps typically include accommodation, offer various activities such as arts and crafts, cooking sessions and drumming circles, and are tuition-free for campers. The age of participants varies from 6-18 and the number of participants from 15-100.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012-08-23/burn-survivors-summer-camp/57317326/1 Burn-survivor summer camps let kids shake off the stares].

J Burn Care Res. 2007 Mar-Apr;28(2):334-41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21752547 Impact of pediatric burn camps on participants' self esteem and body image: an empirical study.] Bakker A, Van der Heijden PG, Van Son MJ, Van de Schoot R, Van Loey NE. Burns. 2011 Dec;37(8):1317-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22210080 Burn-injured adolescents report gaining multiple developmental benefits and improved life skills as a result of burn camp attendance.] Rimmer RB, Pressman MS, Takach OP, Bay RC, Croteau R, Hansen LD, Foster KN, Caruso DM. J Burn Care Res. 2012 Jul-Aug;33(4):552-60.&lt;/ref&gt; have demonstrated that burn survivors who participated in burn camps experienced decreased isolation, improved self-esteem and improved social skills.

BAN also initiated the '''DR &amp; Haiti Burn Care Network''', which seeks to improve burn care and treatment in the region. Since 2010, BAN has treated over 200 burn survivors through 6 medical missions, distributed over 50,000 tons of medical supplies and equipment, and sponsored several surgeons on medical exchange programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northjersey.com/news/badly-needed-burn-center-in-works-1.874998?page=all Teaneck lawyer in quest to prevent burns in Haiti.] NorthJersey.com, Deena Yellin, September 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/local-lawyer-expands-burn-network-to-haiti/ Local lawyer expands burn network to Haiti.] Jewish Standard, Abigail Klein Leichman, June 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to improve communication between aid workers and local victims, BAN launched the [[iOS app]] "French Creole for Aid Workers" in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.devex.com/news/iphone-app-helps-boost-haitian-recovery-efforts-72198 IPhone App Helps Boost Haitian Recovery Efforts.] Devex, Ma. Rizza Leonzon, January 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:BAN18.jpg|thumb|Medical mission, Haiti 2011]]Founder Samuel Davis, trial lawyer and lecturer, has worked with burn survivors with serious injuries for over 30 years. After witnessing the positive effects of burn camps on his clients, he began sponsoring individual burn survivors from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bergen.com/health-and-beauty/health/helping-hands-tenafly-s-sam-davis-advocates-for-burn-victims-1.796676 Helping Hands: Tenafly's Sam Davis advocates for burn victims.] Bergen.com, February 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The local operation quickly expanded into an international organization, following the Haiti earthquake. In 2012, Samuel Davis received the [[Clarence Darrow]] Award for his ongoing philanthropic work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://teaneck.dailyvoice.com/neighbors/teaneck-rotary-honors-attorney-with-humanitarian-award/607317/ Teaneck Rotary Honors Attorney With Humanitarian Award]. Teaneck Daily Voice, Melissa Heule, December 02, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==

The organization is funded through private donations and fundraising events. By relying on volunteers and interns, BAN is able to keep its camps free for all participants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://burnadvocates.org/financials/ Financials], Burn Advocates Network&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:BAN20.JPG|thumb|Camp Karma, India 2013]]

In [[Estonia]] the last execution took place on 11 September 1991 when Rein Oruste was shot with a bullet to the back of the head for the [[crime]] of [[murder]]. The death penalty was completely abolished in Estonia on 18 March 1998 when Protocol No. 6 to the [[ECHR]] was signed.

From 1 February 1920 to the incorporation into the Soviet Union in 1940, inmates condemned by civilian courts were given the right to choose how they died: either suicide by drinking poison or hanged in the following terms (as stated in the Criminal Procedure Code which entered in force on 1 February 1935): ''"One hour before the scheduled time of the execution, the condemned shall be taken to a death cell, where the state prosecutor will read the death sentence and ask the prisoner whether he is willing to commit suicide. If the answer is in the affirmative, the prosecutor will hand the condemned a glass of poison—the kind of poison to be determined by the National Health Board. If the doomed man fails to take the poison within five minutes he will be hanged'"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ESTONIA: Authorized Suicides |author= |newspaper=Time |date=Nov 5, 1934 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,882558,00.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Military executions were carried out by an eight men firing squad.

== History ==
Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago was founded in 1860 as the Chicago Nursery and Half-Orphan Asylum. In addition to housing orphans and other dependent children, the Asylum provided day care services for working mothers.

In 1931, the Chicago Nursery and Half-Orphan Asylum moved into a building at 2800 West Foster Avenue. After the move, the organization became known by the name of that building, Chapin Hall Center for Children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chsmedia.org/media/fa/fa/M-C/ChapinHall-inv.htm|title=Chicago Nursery and Half-Orphan Asylum. Chapin Hall for Children records, 1867–1984|last=Whalen|first=Jack|date=2013|website=Chicago History Museum|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1960s and 70s, Chapin Hall Center for Children was financially dependent on state money. During the 70s and 80s, national public policy shifted to fund institutional care for only "severely disturbed children." As a result of dwindling support, in 1984, Chapin Hall Center for Children decided to close its residential care program.

The following year, Chapin Hall Center for Children was re-opened as a policy research center affiliated with the University of Chicago. The goal of the newly formed organization was to conduct research about child welfare and well-being, in alignment with its history as a residential care facility. [[Harold Richman|Harold A. Richman]] was the first executive director of the research center and held that role through 2008.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Home of Another Kind: One Chicago Orphanage and the Tangle of Child Welfare|last=Cmiel|first=Kenneth|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1995|isbn=0-226-11084-2|location=Chicago|pages=1–3, 184–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and policy initiatives ==
Chapin Hall's three major areas of focus are child welfare, community capacity building, and [[youth homelessness]]. [9] Chapin Hall houses a number of ongoing initiatives related to child, youth, and family well-being.

=== Center for State Child Welfare Data ===
The Center for State Child Welfare Data is a platform that enables [[public sector]] agencies to store and analyze administrative data related to children placed in [[out-of-home care]]. {{As of|2017}}, 22 states used the platform, covering about 70% of children in the U.S. in the child welfare system.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

One component of Center is the Foster Care Data Archive. The archive provides access to information about children in the foster care system over time.

In addition to providing a platform for the data, Chapin Hall staff help members [[analyze data]] for both policymaking and in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Substance Abuse Treatment. Introduction to Cross-System Data Sources in Child Welfare, Alcohol and Other Drug Services, and Courts. HHS Publication No. (SMA) 11-4630. Rockville, MD: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2011. pp 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fcda.chapinhall.org/|title=Center for State Child Welfare Data {{!}} Continuous Quality Improvement|website=The Center for State Child Welfare Data|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/data-labs/the-center-for-state-child-welfare-data-fbe64f1b743|title=The Center for State Child Welfare Data|last=GovLab|first=The|date=2017-12-12|website=Data Labs|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Doris Duke Fellowship for the Promotion of Child Well-Being ===
Chapin Hall receives financial support from the [[Doris Duke Charitable Foundation]] to run a fellowship program for current and recent graduate students interested in child well-being and maltreatment prevention.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dorisdukefellowships.org/about/|title=About|website=Doris Duke Fellowships|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers in the program are from multiple disciplines including social work, child development, public health, medicine, public policy, education, economics, psychology, and epidemiology. Fellows receive thirty thousand dollars to complete their dissertation and related research.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Transformational Collaborative Outcomes Management ===
Transformational Collaborative Outcomes Management (TCOM) is a framework for decision-making in complex systems.  TCOM provides tools and guidance on an individual, program, and system level to help support decisions, monitor outcomes, and improve quality in child welfare systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://praedfoundation.org/tools/transformational-collaborative-outcomes-management-tcom/|title=Transformational Collaborative Outcomes Management (TCOM) {{!}} Praed Foundation|website=praedfoundation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TCOM is the foundation of Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths (CANS), an assessment strategy for monitoring the well-being of children and youth. CANS is broadly used in child welfare. As of 2018, the CANS was being used by nearly 5,000 agencies across 10 countries, including all 50 U.S. states. The assessment is used in the fields of child welfare, mental health, juvenile justice, autism and developmental health, and early intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyons|first=John|date=March 23, 2014|title=Use of the Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths (CANS) in Child Welfare in the United States|url=http://www.ohiochildrensalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/CANS-in-child-welfare-report.pdf|journal=Ohio Association of Child Caring Agencies, Inc|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://praedfoundation.org/tools/the-child-and-adolescent-needs-and-strengths-cans/|title=The Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths (CANS) {{!}} Praed Foundation|website=praedfoundation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CANS-MH is a variant of the CANS for children and adolescents with mental health challenges. The tool has been shown to be a "reliable measure of psychosocial needs and strengths".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Rachel L.|date=2003|title=Reliability of the Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths-Mental Health (CANS-MH) Scale|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1023935726541|journal=Journal of Child and Family Studies|language=en|volume=12|issue=3|pages=279–289|doi=10.1023/a:1023935726541|issn=1062-1024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oak Park Collaboration for Early Childhood ===
The Collaboration for Early Childhood is a nonprofit organization in [[Oak Park, Illinois]] that works to connect parents of young children to local resources. Their website also houses resource directories for health care professionals, educators, and service providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://collab4kids.org/|title=Collaboration for Early Childhood: Strong Start, Bright Future|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2013, the Collaboration for Early Childhood entered a five-year contract with Chapin Hall to build a comprehensive early childhood database. The database will unify administrative data sources, providing users with a view of school enrollment and poverty at a local level in Oak Park. Information on subsidized child care and [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|SNAP]] benefits will be available at a state level. Once the database is live, providers will be able to access and analyze these data to help inform program and practice decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://collab4kids.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Collaboration_IGA_Exec_Summ_May2015.pdf|title=Executive Summary|last=|first=|date=May 2015|website=Collaboration for Early Childhood|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oakpark.com/News/Articles/5-12-2015/Oak-Park-area-could-be-state-model--for-early-childhood-data/|title=Oak Park area could be state model  for early childhood data|website=www.oakpark.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Voices of Youth Count Initiative ===
Voices of Youth Count is a research initiative on youth experiences of [[unaccompanied homelessness]] in the U.S. Chapin Hall partnered with twenty-two counties across the U.S. to conduct "youth-led counts and surveys of young people and providers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/fss/provdrs/emerg/news/2016/march/chicago-joins-twenty-two-communities-across-the-country-join-voi.html|title=City of Chicago :: Chicago Joins Twenty-two Communities Across the Country Join Voices of Youth Count|website=www.cityofchicago.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research also included qualitative interviews in five of those twenty-two counties, a national phone survey, a survey of service providers, a review of policy related to youth homelessness, and a systematic review of published evidence on the effectiveness of programs targeting youth homelessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://voicesofyouthcount.org/approach/|title=Approach – Voices of Youth Count|website=voicesofyouthcount.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on these data sources, Voices of Youth Count has produced a series of policy briefs. The first provided an estimate of the scale and character of youth homelessness in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://voicesofyouthcount.org/brief/national-estimates-of-youth-homelessness/|title=Missed Opportunities: Youth Homelessness in America|last=Morton|first=Matthew|date=November 2017|website=Voices of Youth Count|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second report focused on lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, and queer youth,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://voicesofyouthcount.org/brief/lgbtq-youth-homelessness|title=Missed Opportunities: LGBTQ Youth Homelessness in America|last=Morton|first=Matthew|date=April 2018|website=Voices of Youth Count|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the third looked at youth homelessness among pregnant or parenting young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://voicesofyouthcount.org/brief/pregnant-and-parenting-youth-experiencing-homelessness/|title=Missed Opportunities: Pregnant and Parenting Youth Experiencing Homelessness in America|last=Dworsky|first=Amy|date=April 2018|website=Voices of Youth Count|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports on youth counts, youth homelessness in the rural U.S., youth trajectories into and through homelessness, child welfare, and education are forthcoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://voicesofyouthcount.org/more-research-to-impact-briefs-to-come/|title=More Research to Impact Briefs to Come|last=|first=|date=|website=Voices of Youth Count|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
Chapin Hall employs research and policy staff with experience in child welfare, epidemiology, psychology, social work, statistics, and youth development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chapinhall.org/experts/|title=Experts|last=|first=|date=|website=Chapin Hall|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization began with 15 employees in 1986,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and has had more than one hundred employees as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://990s.foundationcenter.org/990_pdf_archive/362/362167012/362167012_201406_990.pdf|title=Form 990 – Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax|last=|first=|date=2013|website=Foundation Center|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annual revenue in 1986 was about five hundred thousand.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2016, that number stood at over five million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.govwiki.info/pdfs/Non-Profit/IL%20Chapin%20Hall%20Center%20For%20Children%202016.pdf|title=Chapin Hall Center for Children: Financial Statements and Independent Auditor's Reports Required by Government Auditing Standards and Uniform Guidance|last=|first=|date=February 2017|website=GovWiki|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryan Samuels is the current Executive Director of Chapin Hall. He joined the organization in 2013 after serving as the commissioner of the Administration on Children, Youth and Families in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://chronicleofsocialchange.org/featured/bryan-samuels-leaving-hhs-to-lead-chapin-hall|title=Bryan Samuels Leaving HHS to Lead Chapin Hall|last=|first=|date=2013-08-06|work=The Chronicle of Social Change|access-date=2018-07-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Samuels was the recipient of the Bernice Weissbourd Award for Family Support, awarded by Family Focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.family-focus.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Family-Focus-2018-Anniversary-Gala-Bryan-Samuels-Award-Comments.pdf|title=Bryan Samuels Comments: Recipient of the 2018 Bernice Weissbourd Award for Family Support|last=|first=|date=May 15, 2018|website=Family Focus|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Commotio cordis''' ([[Latin]], "agitation of the heart") is an often lethal disruption of [[heart rhythm]] that occurs as a result of a blow to the area directly over the heart (the [[precordium|precordial region]]), at a critical time during the cycle of a heart beat causing [[cardiac arrest]]. It is a form of [[ventricular fibrillation]] (V-Fib), not mechanical damage to the heart muscle or surrounding organs, and not the result of heart disease. The fatality rate is about 65% even with prompt [[CPR]] and [[defibrillation]], and more than 80% without.&lt;ref name="Maron BJ, Estes NA 3rd 2010 917–27"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maron BJ, Estes NA | title = Commotio cordis | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 362 | issue = 10 | pages = 917–27 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20220186 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra0910111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lacrosse"/&gt;

Commotio cordis occurs mostly in boys and young men (average age 15), usually during [[sport]]s, most frequently baseball, often despite a chest protector. It is usually caused by a projectile, but can also be caused by the blow of an elbow or other body part. Being less developed, the thorax of an adolescent is likely more prone to this injury given the circumstances.

The phenomenon was confirmed experimentally in the 1930s, with research in anaesthetized [[rabbit]]s, [[cat]]s and [[dog]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schlomka G |title=Commotio cordis und ihre Folgen. Die Einwirkung stumpfer Brustwandtraumen auf das Herz |journal=Ergebnisse der inneren Medizin und Kinderheilkunde |date=1934 |volume=47 |pages=1–91 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-90672-5_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

=== Sport ===
Commotio cordis is a very rare event, but nonetheless is often considered when an athlete presents with [[Sudden cardiac death of athletes|sudden cardiac death]]. Some of the sports which have a risk for this cause of trauma are [[baseball]], [[American football]], [[association football]], [[ice hockey]], [[polo]], [[rugby football]], [[cricket]], [[softball]], [[Basque pelota|pelota]], [[fencing]], [[lacrosse]], [[boxing]], [[karate]], [[kung fu]], and other [[martial arts]]. [[Child]]ren are especially vulnerable, possibly{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} due to the mechanical properties of their [[thorax|thoracic skeleton]].  From 1996 to spring 2007, the [[United States|USA]] National Commotio Cordis Registry had 188 cases recorded, with about half occurring during [[organized sport]]s.&lt;ref name="lacrosse"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uslacrosse.org/safety/sudden-cardiac-arrest-aeds-commotio-cordis/position-statement-on-commotio-cordis |title=Position Statement on Commotio Cordis |publisher=[[US Lacrosse]] |date=January 2008 |accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Almost all (96%) of the victims were male, the mean age of the victims during that period was 14.7 years, and fewer than one in five survived the incident.&lt;ref name="lacrosse" /&gt;

===Other situations===
Commotio cordis may also occur in other situations, such as in children who are punished with blows over the precordium, cases of [[torture]], and frontal collisions of [[motor vehicle]]s (the impact of the steering wheel against the thorax, although this has decreased substantially with the use of [[safety belt]]s and [[air bag]]s). In one fatality, the impact to the chest was the result of an exploding [[Whipped cream|whipped cream]] canister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.self.com/story/rebecca-burger-whipped-cream-dispenser-death|title=Fitness Blogger Rebecca Burger Died After a Whipped Cream Dispenser Exploded|last=Barnes|first=Zahra|work=SELF|access-date=2017-07-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the [[precordial thump]] (hard blows given over the precordium with a closed fist  to revert [[cardiac arrest]]) is a sanctioned procedure for emergency resuscitation by trained health professionals witnessing a monitored arrest when no equipment is at hand, endorsed by the latest guidelines of the [[International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation]]. It has been discussed controversially, as—in particular in severe hypoxia—it may cause the opposite effect (i.e., a worsening of rhythm—commotio cordis). In a normal adult, the energy range involved in the precordial thump is five to 10 times below that associated with commotio cordis.&lt;ref name="Kohl2005"&gt;Kohl P, Sachs F &amp; Franz M (eds): ''Cardiac Mechano-Electric Feedback and Arrhythmias: from Pipette to Patient''. Elsevier (Saunders), Philadelphia 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism ==
[[Image:Commotio Cordis Risk Zone.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Diagram showing the portion of normal sinus rhythm during which commotio cordis is a risk]]

These factors influence the chance of commotio cordis:

* Direction of impact over the precordium (precise area, angle of impact)
* Total applied energy (area of impact versus energy, i.e., the [[kinetic energy]] of the projectile &lt;math&gt;E_\text{k} =\tfrac{1}{2} mv^2 &lt;/math&gt;)
* Impact occurring within a specific 10– to 30-millisecond portion of the cardiac cycle. This period occurs in the ascending phase of the T wave, when the ventricular myocardium is repolarizing, moving from [[Systole (medicine)|systole]] to [[diastole]] (relaxation).

The small window of vulnerability explains why it is a rare event. Considering that the total cardiac cycle has a duration of 1 second (for a base cardiac frequency of 60 beats per minute), the probability of a mechanical trauma within the window of vulnerability is 1 to 3% only. That also explains why the heart becomes more vulnerable when it is physically strained by sports activities:
# The increase in heart rate (exercise [[tachycardia]]) may double the probability above (e.g., with 120 beats per minute the cardiac cycle shortens to 500 milliseconds without fundamentally altering the window-of-vulnerability's size)
# Relative exercise-induced [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] and acceleration of the excitoconductive system of the heart make it more susceptible to stretch-induced ventricular fibrillation.

The [[cell (biology)|cellular]] mechanisms of commotio cordis are still poorly understood, but probably related to the activation of mechanosensitive proteins, [[ion channels]]. These trigger extra electrical excitation waves which, if occurring right at the trailing edge of a previous electrical cycle, can give rise to ventricular fibrillation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quinn|first=T. Alexander|last2=Jin|first2=Honghua|last3=Lee|first3=Peter|last4=Kohl|first4=Peter|date=2017-08-01|title=Mechanically Induced Ectopy via Stretch-Activated Cation-Nonselective Channels Is Caused by Local Tissue Deformation and Results in Ventricular Fibrillation if Triggered on the Repolarization Wave Edge (Commotio Cordis)|url=http://circep.ahajournals.org/content/10/8/e004777|journal=Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology|language=en|volume=10|issue=8|pages=e004777|doi=10.1161/CIRCEP.116.004777|issn=1941-3149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the trailing edge of the preceding electrical cycle travels over the ventricular surface, the critical window for mechanical induction of ventricular fibrillation varies locally - i.e. the commotio cordis risk window exists in time and in space.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This helps to explain why precordial impacts tend to have benign consequences.

Impact energies of at least 50 [[joule]]s are estimated to be required to cause cardiac arrest, when applied in the right time and spot of the precordium of an adult.&lt;ref name="Kohl2005" /&gt; Impacts  up to 130 joules have already been measured with [[hockey puck]]s and lacrosse balls, 450 joules in karate punches, and 1028 joules in boxer [[Rocky Marciano]]'s punch.&lt;ref name="titlescience.ca View question #821"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.science.ca/askascientist/viewquestion.php?qID=821 |title=science.ca View question #821 |accessdate=2008-02-23 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 50-joule threshold, however, can be considerably lowered when the victim's heart is under [[ischemia|ischemic]] conditions, such as in [[coronary artery]] insufficiency.&lt;ref name="Kohl2005" /&gt;

Also an upper limit of impact energy is applied to the heart; too much energy will create structural damage to the heart muscle, as well as causing electrical upset.  This condition is referred to as [[contuiso cordis|contusio cordis]] (from Latin for bruising of the heart). On isolated [[guinea pig]] hearts, as little as 5 [[millijoule|mJ]] were needed to induce release of [[creatine kinase]], a marker for [[muscle cell]] damage.&lt;ref name="pmid16125216"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cooper PJ, Epstein A, Macleod IA, Schaaf ST, Sheldon J, Boulin C, Kohl P | title = Soft tissue impact characterisation kit (STICK) for ex situ investigation of heart rhythm responses to acute mechanical stimulation | journal = Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology | volume = 90 | issue = 1-3 | pages = 444–68 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16125216 | doi = 10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2005.07.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Obviously, this figure does not include the dissipation of energy through the chest wall, and is not scaled up for humans, but it is indicative that relatively small amounts of energy are required to reach the heart before physical damage is done.

==Prevention==

The risk would probably be reduced by improved coaching techniques, such as teaching young batters to turn away from the ball to avoid errant pitches, according to doctors. Defensive players in lacrosse and hockey are now taught to avoid using their chest to block the ball or puck. Starting in 2017, high school lacrosse players are penalized, and play stopped immediately, if they enter their own goal crease with the apparent intent of blocking shots or acting as goalkeeper.&lt;ref name="NFHS lacrosse rule 4.18.4"&gt;Rule 4.18.4, {{cite book |title=2018 Boys' Lacrosse Rule Book |date=2018 |publisher=[[National Federation of State High School Associations]] |location=[[Indianapolis, Indiana]] |page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chest protectors and vests are designed to reduce trauma from blunt bodily injury, but this does not offer protection from commotio cordis and may offer a false sense of security. Almost 20% of the victims in competitive football, baseball, lacrosse and hockey were wearing protectors. This ineffectiveness has been confirmed by animal studies. Development of adequate chest protectors may prove difficult.&lt;ref name="Maron BJ, Estes NA 3rd 2010 917–27"/&gt;

==Treatment==
[[File:Medtronic aed training kit.jpg|thumb|right|Defibrillator training kit]]

Most cases are fatal. [[Automated external defibrillator]]s have helped increase the survival rate to 35%.&lt;ref name="Maron BJ, Estes NA 3rd 2010 917–27"/&gt; Defibrillation must be started as soon as possible (within 3 minutes) for maximal benefit. Commotio cordis is the leading cause of fatalities in youth baseball in the US, with two to three deaths per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Abrunzo TJ | title = Commotio cordis. The single, most common cause of traumatic death in youth baseball | journal = American Journal of Diseases of Children | volume = 145 | issue = 11 | pages = 1279–82 | date = November 1991 | pmid = 1951221 | doi = 10.1001/archpedi.1991.02160110071023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been recommended that "communities and [[school district]]s reexamine the need for accessible automatic defibrillators and cardiopulmonary resuscitation-trained [[coach (sports)|coach]]es at organized sporting events for children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Salib EA, Cyran SE, Cilley RE, Maron BJ, Thomas NJ | title = Efficacy of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation and out-of-hospital automated external defibrillation as life-saving therapy in commotio cordis | journal = The Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 147 | issue = 6 | pages = 863–6 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16356450 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpeds.2005.07.041 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==

Several people have been convicted of involuntary [[manslaughter]] in cases involving insufficient and slow medical help to athletes who experienced commotio cordis during sports events,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maron BJ, Mitten MJ, Greene Burnett C | title = Criminal consequences of commotio cordis | journal = The American Journal of Cardiology | volume = 89 | issue = 2 | pages = 210–3 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11792344 | doi = 10.1016/S0002-9149(01)02202-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in cases of intentional delivery of contusive blows. In 1992, Italian hockey player Miran Schrott died after a blow to his chest from the stick of Canadian-Italian player Jimmy Boni. Boni was charged with [[culpable homicide]], and eventually pleaded guilty to manslaughter, paying a $1,300 fine and $175,000 restitution to Schrott's family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maki|first1=Allan|title=Darcy Robinson's death brings shock|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/darcy-robinsons-death-brings-shock/article1083411/|accessdate=29 February 2016|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Beyazit kulliyesi.JPG|thumb|The inner courtyard of the darüşşifa]]
The '''Complex of Sultan Bayezid II Health Museum''' ({{lang-tr|Sultan II Bayezid Külliyesi Sağlık Müzesi}}) is a hospital museum of [[Trakya University]] within the Complex of Sultan Bayezid II located in [[Edirne]], Turkey.

A ''[[külliye]]'' is an [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman architectural]] term for a complex of buildings centered on a [[mosque]]. Complex of Bayezid II Külliye was built in 1488 by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sultan [[Bayezid II]] (reigned 1481–1512).

The complex contains a [[Dar al-Shifa]] (Turkish ''darüşşifa'', "hospital, medical center"), and it remained in operation for four centuries from 1488 until the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)]]. The hospital was especially notable for its treatment methods for [[mental disorder]]s, which included the use of music, water sound and scents.

The historic darüşşifa was incorporated into the structure of Edirne-based [[Trakya University]] in 1993, and converted into a "Health Museum" ({{lang-tr|Sağlık Müzesi}}) in 1997, a museum dedicated to the [[history of medicine]] and health matters in general. It has been developing constantly ever since. It remains Turkey's only museum in its field and provides varied and valuable information to visitors on the development of [[medicine]] and of medical services throughout history, especially Ottoman history. The museum is the second most visited historical site in Edirne after the [[Selimiye Mosque]]. The museum was awarded the [[European Council]]'s "[[European Council]] Museum Award" in 2004 and in 2016 the complex was inscribed in the [[List_of_World_Heritage_Sites_in_Turkey_(Tentative_list)|Tentative list of World Heritage Sites in Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kızılırmak Delta Wetland and Bird Sanctuary |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/6117/ | website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre | accessdate=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical school==
[[File:ComplexSultanBayezidIIEdirne (2).JPG|thumb|Courtyard of the historic Medical school.]]
[[File:HealthMuseumEdirne (2).JPG|thumb|left|150px|Information plaque about the Medical school]]

The health institution was a [[medical school]] ({{lang-ota|Medrese-i Etibba}}). It ranked among the best 60 schools ([[madrasa]]) in the [[Ottoman Empire]] due to its high-paid scholar.

The medical school consisted of 18 student rooms and a classroom surrounding three sides of a courtyard with a [[shadirvan]] (fountain) in the middle. Famous Ottoman travel writer [[Evliya Çelebi]] (1611–after 1682) mentions in his book that the students of the medical school were mature physicians, who studied and discussed works of [[Ancient Greek]] philosophers, scientists and physicians such as [[Plato]] (428/427 or 424/423–348/347 BC), [[Socrates]] (470/469–399 BC), [[Philip of Opus]], [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC), [[Galen]]  (AD 129– c. 200/c. 216) and [[Pythagoras]] (c. 570 – c. 495 BC). The physicians, each being a specialist in a different field, tried to find out the best treatment by studying valuable scientific literature on medicine. The books of the medical school are archived in the hand-written books library of Selimiye Mosque today.

According to Evliya Çelebi, following daily wages were paid to the staff and students:
* Scholar (1): 60 [[akçe]] (silver coin) including holidays,
* Assistant (1): 7 akçe
* Library clerk (1): 2 akçe
* Servants (2): 2 akçe
* Students (18): 2 akçe. in addition to meeting of all their needs.

'''East Gordon Street Sewerage Works''' is a heritage-listed [[pumping station]] at Sewerage Works Buildings, 38 East Gordon Street, [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]], [[Mackay Region]], [[Queensland]], Australia. It was designed by [[A E Harding Frew]] and built in 1936. It is also known as Pump Stations. It was added to the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 10 July 2009.&lt;ref name=qhr&gt;{{cite QHR|29134|East Gordon Street Sewerage Works|602727|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The sewerage works in East Gordon Street, one of the first in Queensland, was opened by George Moody, [[City of Mackay|Mayor of Mackay]], on 25 January 1936. The consulting engineer was AE Harding Frew.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Mackay began as a settlement on the south bank of the [[Pioneer River]] serving pastoral holdings. By 1863 it had been surveyed and the first lots of land sold. It was gazetted as a [[port of entry]] and a [[Mackay Customs House|customs house]] was opened. [[Sugarcane|Sugar cane]] was introduced in 1865 and by the mid-1880s this was the major industry in the area. Mackay prospered as a port and as a commercial and administrative centre.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

From the end of the nineteenth century until well after [[World War II]], basic services in regional Queensland were progressively upgraded. Reticulated water supplies, sewerage systems and electricity were introduced into regional towns beginning with the major centres. Planning for [[Brisbane]]'s sewerage system was underway by 1909. A sewerage scheme was introduced at [[Toowoomba]] in 1925, and development of a sewerage scheme at [[Rockhampton]] commenced in 1936. Most other regional centres did not have sewerage systems provided until after World War Two, with some local government areas waiting until the 1960s-1980s. Mackay's sewerage system, opened in January 1936, was among the first in regional Queensland.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The system was introduced at a time when Mackay was undergoing a major public works program to improve the infrastructure of the town and upgrade the harbour. A number of factors prompted this program. Through the 1920s and 1930s, Mackay enjoyed a period of substantial growth, even during the period of financial hardship and unemployment caused by the [[Great Depression in Australia|Depression]]. It was the fastest-growing town in Queensland, with its population almost doubling between 1923 and 1940. This was largely due to the linking of Mackay by the [[North Coast railway line, Queensland|North Coast railway line]] to Rockhampton in 1921 and to [[Townsville]] in 1923. This improved access to markets and reduced transport costs, boosting not only the sugar industry, but also the developing dairy and tourist industries.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Another contributing factor was that the local [[Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly|Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly]], [[William Forgan Smith]], was [[Premier of Queensland]] between 1932 and 1940 and he supported the growth of the region. It was hoped that the public works program, including the Outer Harbour scheme, would make Mackay one of Queensland's most frequented beauty spots and that, as an attractive modern city, it would become a base for those visiting [[Eungella]] and the islands.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The city council commissioned a town plan from Ronald McInnes in 1934. It was based on Britain's Town Planning Act of 1932 and was the first town plan designed for an existing city in Queensland, serving as a model for other cities for many years. The [[City of Mackay|Mackay City Council]] undertook an ambitious plan for the beautification and modernisation of the city. The scheme included the provision of new parks, kerbing and channelling, new water mains, a new powerhouse and the establishment of the sewerage system.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

At the opening of the East Gordon Street Sewerage Works on 25 January 1936 the chairman of the Mackay Harbour Board, Charles Frederick Bagley, paid tribute to the city council for its initiative in carrying out the scheme and to the consulting engineer AE Harding Frew who designed it.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Alison Eavis Harding Frew (1883-1952) was a prominent Queensland civil engineer. Harding Frew's designed about 80 bridges throughout Queensland during his career. He was a consulting engineer in [[Melbourne]] during the 1920s and on the [[Pyrmont Power House]] at [[Sydney]] in the early 1940s. He was a consultant on the 1926 Brisbane Cross River Commission and was the designing engineer for the [[William Jolly Bridge]] in Brisbane, from November 1926 to 1932. From 1932 to 1935 he was the engineer for bridge construction on the [[Hornibrook Bridge|Hornibrook Highway]] project, the bridge linking [[Sandgate, Queensland|Sandgate]] and [[Redcliffe, Queensland|Redcliffe]]. Frew's design for the fully automated pump houses at Mackay, featuring castellated parapets, encompasses one of the basic principles of civil engineering, which is to design creative solutions that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

At the opening of the works Bagley reiterated the view of the day that, with the completion of the sewerage works and the Outer Harbour Scheme, Mackay would become even more important, and the Government Medical Officer, Dr Ernest Wesley Chenoweth, emphasised the public health advantages of the new sewerage scheme.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Sewage was pumped to the site via concrete or glazed pipes, where it was held in a well and treated with [[chlorine]] before being pumped out to sea at high tide. The main elements of sewage treatment included the separation of solids from fluids by screening and allowing the solids to settle in a tank. The solids were drawn off and disposed of, and the fluids were often treated before being discharged into a waterway or the ocean. Chlorine was used as a disinfectant.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

By December 1933 a total of {{convert|68123|ft}} of sewer main, including a main crossing at Sandfly Creek near the East Gordon Street site, had been pegged out. Tenders had also been let for the construction of the pump well and pump house, the supply and installation of pump machinery, and the construction of the chlorinator.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The smaller building (the chlorinator) toward the front of the site is now used for storage. The larger building is still in use as a pump station with a submersible pump external to the structure and a switchboard inside the building. A modern [[deodoriser]] has been installed next to this building. Sewage is pumped from the station at East Gordon Street to a pump station in Sydney Street.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The East Gordon Street works forms part of a major network of 135 pump stations throughout Mackay and they are associated with a sewer main of more than {{convert|630|km|mi}}, which ultimately connects to one of three waste water treatment plants in the city. Mackay Water, a business unit of [[Mackay City Council]] (now of the Mackay Regional Council), is responsible for the management of Mackay's sewerage scheme.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

== Description ==
The 1936 Sewerage Works is located on a level allotment in East Gordon Street, Mackay. The two principal early structures on the site are the pump house and chlorinator building. These are small, white, concrete buildings with castellated parapets. The larger is to the rear and the smaller to the front of the block.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The buildings are constructed from off-form concrete with a horizontal, wide-board pattern showing. Vent stacks are built as miniature towers at some corners of the structures; other corners have matching engaged [[buttress]]es. They sit on concrete tanks, their floors about {{convert|1.5|m}} above the ground.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The smaller building (chlorinator) is rectangular in plan with the longer elevations facing south-west and north-east. Two square, metal-framed windows, covered with metal shutters open into both of these elevations. A square window into the north-west elevation is also covered with sheeting. The entrance to the building, in the south-east elevation, is via a concrete stair which ascends parallel to the wall finishing at a concrete landing. A wooden door opens from the landing. This is secured with a knob and a more recent lock. The top of the tank under the smaller building forms a raised semicircular concrete [[plinth]] which extends to the south-west. The tank contains a chamber with a tapered floor.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Internally, the building comprises a single room with unpainted concrete walls. It contains two large items of early machinery. One of these has a small brass name plate bearing the words "Filtration and water softening system".&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The larger building (pump house) is also rectangular in plan with the long elevations facing south-west and north-east. Access to the building is via a concrete stair to the narrow, south-east elevation. The stair ascends at right angles to the wall finishing at a long landing. At the top of the landing, a double metal door opens into the interior. It has a curved handle and is secured by a barrel bolt. A plaque above the door commemorates the commissioning of the works on 25 January 1936. The opposite elevation has a single small, metal- framed glass window with nine panes.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The south-west elevation has three square, steel-framed windows. These pivot around a horizontal axis at mid-height. The top of the tank attached to the side of the building projects to form a rectangular plinth. A steel stairway ascends at right angles to the south-eastern side of the tank finishing close to the wall of the building. Four metal shafts project from the top of the tank. Three of these have metal wheels fitted to the top; threaded lengths of rod extend above these wheels. Hinged, steel panels provide access into the tanks.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The opposite (north-east) elevation has two square windows and a narrow hatchway around {{convert|1.5|m}} in height. The windows are covered with sheeting which is boxed out from the wall a short distance. Two metal plates are bolted over the hatchway; a large square plate above a smaller rectangular one. Both plates have curved handles at each end.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The top of the tank forms a rectangular plinth extending from this elevation. There are small rectangular and arched openings into the base of the north-eastern end of the plinth.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Internally, the larger building is painted light grey on the lower part of the wall and pale green above, separated by a black band. The floor comprises a series of steel plates with a metal ladder descending to a sub-floor area that is now disused. The building contains a grey cabinet housing electrical equipment. This is not considered to be of cultural heritage significance.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The building also contains a manually operated overhead crane. Transverse movement of the crane is achieved by means of a simple chain and wheel mechanism. A similar chain and wheel raises and lowers a hook. This mechanism comprises a pulley and two back-to-back hooks. One of the hooks secures the mechanism to the overhead cross beam of the crane; the other dangles downwards for holding the load.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

== Heritage listing ==
East Gordon Street Sewerage Works was listed on the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 10 July 2009 having satisfied the following criteria.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.'''

The East Gordon Street Sewerage Works in Mackay, opened in 1936, was one of the first in regional Queensland. As such, it is important in demonstrating the progressive upgrading of basic infrastructure in regional Queensland, in particular the provision of sewerage schemes, which took place in regional towns and cities from the interwar period. Most other regional centres did not develop such schemes until after World War II, with some local government areas not constructing sewerage infrastructure until after 1960.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

As one of the first sewerage works in regional Queensland, it is tangible evidence of the importance of Mackay as a regional centre in the 1930s and the influence the city enjoyed through their local Member of Parliament, William Forgan Smith, who was Premier at the time. During the 1920s and 1930s, Mackay was the fastest growing town in Queensland.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.'''

The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a sewage treatment works of the interwar period. Characteristics include pump house, chlorination plant building, and the deliberate attempt to visually disguise the true purpose of these structures through the stylistic treatment of the exterior walls with their castellated parapets, which is unusual for such utilitarian structures.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The place also is important in demonstrating the work of prominent civil engineer AE Harding Frew, who designed the scheme. Frew made a substantial contribution to civil engineering infrastructure in Queensland including designing the William Jolly Bridge in Brisbane.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The '''European Organisation for Rare Diseases''' ('''EURORDIS''') is a non-governmental patient-driven alliance of patient organizations and individuals active in the field of rare diseases, that promotes research on [[rare disease]]s and commercial development of [[orphan drug]]s. EURORDIS is a dedicated to improving the quality of life of all people living with rare diseases in Europe. It was founded in 1997; it is supported by its members and by the French Muscular Dystrophy Association (AFM), the European Commission, corporate foundations and the health industry.&lt;ref name="eurordis.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurordis.org/content/brief-0|title=EURORDIS in brief|website=www.eurordis.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are an estimated 20–30 million people living with rare diseases in Europe alone,&lt;ref name="pmid15553406"/&gt; and an estimated 6,000 rare diseases.
EURORDIS represents more than 700 rare disease organizations in 63 different countries (of which 26 are EU Member States), covering more than 2,000 rare diseases.&lt;ref name="eurordis.org"/&gt;

EURORDIS is a development of the patient self-advocacy movement, itself widely attributed to [[AIDS activism]].&lt;ref name="pmid15069992"&gt;{{cite journal

'''Galactorrhea''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#ae and oe|also spelled]] '''galactorrhoea''') ([[wikt:galacto-|galacto-]] + [[wikt:-rrhea|-rrhea]]) or '''lactorrhea''' ([[wikt:lacto-|lacto-]] + [[wikt:-rrhea|-rrhea]]) is the spontaneous flow of [[milk]] from the [[breast]], unassociated with [[childbirth]] or nursing.

Galactorrhea is reported to occur in 5–32% of women. Much of the difference in reported incidence can be attributed to different definitions of galactorrhea.&lt;ref name=Sakiyama_1983&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sakiyama | first1 = R. | last2 = Quan | first2 = M. | title = Galactorrhea and hyperprolactinemia | journal = Obstetrical &amp; Gynecological Survey | volume = 38 | issue = 12 | pages = 689–700 | year = 1983 | pmid = 6361641 | doi=10.1097/00006254-198312000-00001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although frequently benign, it may be caused by serious underlying conditions and should be properly investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Whitman-Elia | first1 = G.

==Causes==
Galactorrhea can take place as a result of dysregulation of certain [[hormone]]s. Hormonal causes most frequently associated with galactorrhea are [[hyperprolactinemia]] and [[thyroid]] conditions with elevated levels{{efn|which may also suggest [[Pituitary disease]]}} of [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH) or [[thyrotropin-releasing hormone]] (TRH). No obvious cause is found in about 50% of cases.&lt;ref name=Sakiyama_1983/&gt;

[[Lactation]] requires the presence of [[prolactin]], and the evaluation of galactorrhea includes eliciting a history for various medications or foods ([[methyldopa]], [[opioid]]s,  [[antipsychotic]]s, [[serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s, as well as [[licorice]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 23456048| pmc = 3683415| year = 2013| author1 = Karimi| first1 = H| title = Burns, hypertrophic scar and galactorrhea| journal = Journal of Injury &amp; Violence Research| volume = 5| issue = 2| pages = 117–9| last2 = Nourizad| first2 = S| last3 = Momeni| first3 = M| last4 = Rahbar| first4 = H| last5 = Momeni| first5 = M| last6 = Farhadi| first6 = K| doi = 10.5249/jivr.v5i2.314}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and for behavioral causes (stress, and breast and chest wall stimulation), as well as evaluation for pregnancy, [[pituitary adenoma]]s (with overproduction of [[prolactin]] or compression of the [[pituitary]] stalk), and [[hypothyroidism]]. Adenomas of the anterior pituitary are most often prolactinomas. Overproduction of prolactin leads to cessation of menstrual periods and [[infertility]], which may be a diagnostic clue. Galactorrhea may also be caused by hormonal imbalances owing to birth control pills.

Galactorrhea is also a side effect associated with the use of the second-generation [[H2 receptor antagonist|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonist]] [[cimetidine]] (Tagamet). Galactorrhea can also be caused by antipsychotics that cause hyperprolactinemia by blocking dopamine receptors responsible for control of prolactin release. Of these, [[risperidone]] is the most notorious for causing this complication.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} Case reports suggest [[proton-pump inhibitor]]s have been shown to cause galactorrhea.

==Neonatal milk==
{{main article|Witch's milk}}
'''Neonatal milk''' or '''witch's milk''' is [[milk]] secreted from the [[breast]]s of approximately 5% of [[newborn infant]]s. It is considered a normal variation and no treatment or testing is necessary. In folklore, witch's milk was believed to be a source of nourishment for witches' [[familiar spirit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Malcolm  | last= Potts | authorlink= Malcolm Potts | year=1999 | title=Ever Since Adam and Eve: The Evolution of Human Sexuality | isbn=0-521-64404-6 | page= 145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hamlin's Wizard Oil''' was an American [[patent medicine]] sold as a [[cure-all]] under the slogan "There is no Sore it will Not Heal, No Pain it will not Subdue."

==History==
First produced in 1861 in Chicago&lt;ref name=elgin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elginhistory.com/dgb/ch07.htm|title=Chapter 7: Good Old Days|last=Alft|first=E. C.|work=Elgin: Days Gone By|publisher=Elgin History|accessdate=2009-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; by former magician John Austen Hamlin and his brother Lysander Butler Hamlin, it was primarily sold and used as a [[liniment]] for [[Rheumatism|rheumatic pain]] and sore muscles, but was advertised as a treatment for pneumonia, cancer, diphtheria, earache, toothache, headache and [[rabies|hydrophobia]].&lt;ref name=elgin/&gt;&lt;ref name=herb/&gt; It was made of 50%-70% alcohol containing [[camphor]], [[ammonia]], [[chloroform]], [[sassafras]], [[cloves]], and [[turpentine]], and was said to be usable both internally and topically.&lt;ref name=herb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herbcompanion.com/Health/PATENT-medicines.aspx?page=3|title=Patent Medicines|last=Long|first=Jim|date=February–March 1993|work=Herb Companion|accessdate=2009-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traveling performance troupes advertised the product in [[medicine show]]s across the Midwest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Ann|title=Snake oil, hustlers and hambones: the American medicine show|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|year=2000|pages=190|isbn=0-7864-0800-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McNamara|first=Brooks|title=Step right up  |publisher=University Press of Mississippi|year=1995|pages=249|isbn=0-87805-831-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; with runs as long as six weeks in a town. They used horse-drawn wagons and dressed in silk top hats, [[frock coat]]s, pinstriped trousers, and patent leather shoes—with [[Spats (footwear)|spats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.com/13Hx/TM/12.html|title=Chapter 12: Medicine Show|last=Young|first=James Harvey|year=1961|work=The Toadstool Millionaires: A Social History of Patent Medicines in America before Federal Regulation|publisher=Princeton University Press|accessdate=2009-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; They distributed song books at the shows and in [[druggist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strasser|first=Susan|title=Public culture: diversity, democracy, and community in the United States|editor=Marguerite S.

At these gatherings John Austen Hamlin delivered lectures replete with humor borrowed from the writings of [[Robert Jones Burdette]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Grinnell College]] research points out that the Hamlins claimed efficacy for Wizard Oil on not only human beings but also horses and cattle, one poster displaying an elephant drinking the stuff by lifting the bottle with the trunk. Bottles came in 35¢ and 75¢ sizes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.grinnell.edu/courses/sst/f01/sst395-01/PublicPages/PerfectDrugs/Kendra/USMedicineShows/HamlinWizardOil/index.html Grinnell College site "Perfect Drugs" on "Hamlin's Wizard Oil Company"] ("Before the FDA: 
Quack Cures to Medicine Shows"). ''Cf''. the [http://www.csufresno.edu/folklore/ballads/San052.html CSU Fresno site] by Robert B. Waltz.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Sandburg]] inserted two versions of lyrics titled "Wizard Oil" together with a tune into his ''American Songbag'' (1927).&lt;ref&gt;Carl Sandburg, ''The American Songbag'' (San Diego: Harcourt Brace, 1927), pp. 52-54. Sandburg indicated that his selections were arranged by Henry Francis Parks on the basis of recollections by Harry E. Randall as communicated to Neeta Marquis. The likelihood is that Sandburg added some of his own influence.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, Lysander's son Lawrence B. Hamlin of [[Elgin, Illinois|Elgin]], by then manager of the firm, was fined $200 under the 1906 [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] for advertising that Hamlin's Wizard Oil could "check the growth and permanently kill cancer."&lt;ref name=elgin/&gt;

Liberia is one of the poorest countries in the world. Civil wars have killed around 250,000 people and displaced many more. The wars ended in 2003 but destroyed most of the country's healthcare facilities. Recovery proceeds but the majority of the population still live below the international poverty line. Life expectancy in Liberia is much lower than the world average. Communicable diseases are widespread, including tuberculosis, diarrhea, malaria, HIV, and Dengue. Female genital mutilation is widely practiced. Nearly a quarter of children under the age of five are malnourished and few people have access to adequate sanitation facilities. In 2009, government expenditure on health care per-capita was US$22, accounting for 10.6% of total GDP. In 2008, Liberia had only one doctor and 27 nurses per 100,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liberia|url=http://www.who.int/countries/lbr/en/|website=WHO|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was ill-equipped to handle the outbreak of Ebola in 2014 and 2015.
 
== Health infrastructure ==
{{See also|List of hospitals in Liberia}}

Liberia has 5,000 full-time or part-time [[health worker]]s and 51 Liberian [[Physician|doctors]] to cater to a population of 3.8 million, according to the 2006 health survey.  That is equivalent to about 76,000 civilians being attended to by 1 doctor.  Most of the hospitals, clinics and equipment were destroyed due to its 14 years of civil conflict from 1989 all the way until 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Conflict in Liberia|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/6618.htm|publisher=The U.S. State Department|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The strengthening of the health sector faced financial problems. The government used only 16.8% of the total health expenditure in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liberia|url=http://www.healthsystems2020.org/section/where_we_work/liberia|publisher=the U.S. Agency for International Development|accessdate=15 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410044234/http://www.healthsystems2020.org/section/where_we_work/liberia|archivedate=10 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberia has heavily relied on the international community for health infrastructure and aid. International relief organizations assisted the government to rebuild health facilities and provide essential health care for its citizens. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) donated equipment and helped provide and assist in vaccinating the population to prevent the spreading of many communicable disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liberia|url=http://www.who.int/countries/lbr/en/|publisher=WHO|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) funded 160 million US dollars to improve the health care system and increase the quality of immunization services in Liberia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liberia|url=http://www.gavialliance.org/country/liberia/|publisher=GAVI|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] (MSF), an international medical humanitarian organization, helped Liberia by operating free hospitals right after the civil war (2003) and treated more than 20,000 women and children per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liberia: MSF Hands Over Hospitals to Ministry of Health.|url=http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/press/release.cfm?id=4551|publisher=Doctors Without Borders|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ebola ===
[[File:2014 West Africa Ebola virus outbreak situation map.jpg|thumb|300px|The presence of Ebola in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone as of 17 December 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/resources/distribution-map-guinea-outbreak.html |title=2014 Ebola Outbreak in West Africa - Outbreak Distribution Map |publisher=Cdc.gov |date=6 September 2014 |accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main|2014 West Africa Ebola virus outbreak|Ebola virus epidemic in Liberia}}

Ebola virus is an extremely contagious and severely fatal illness among humans. The disease is transmitted from animals to humans and then spread throughout populations due to human interaction.

As part of a wider regional Ebola outbreak in 2014,  Ebola was first reported in Liberia in [[Lofa County|Lofa]] and [[Nimba County|Nimba]] counties in late March.&lt;ref name="liberianobserver.com"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.liberianobserver.com/security-health/2-5-test-positive-ebola-liberia | title = 2 of 5 Test Positive for Ebola in Liberia | newspaper = [[Liberian Observer]] | date = 31 March 2014 | accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not even a month later there were already six recorded deaths related to Ebola. Liberia had suffered 1,779 deaths from Ebola as of September 22, 2014.&lt;ref name="Ebola_Outbreak_total_lr_22_Sept"&gt;[http://www.mohsw.gov.lr/documents/Liberia%20Ebola%20SitRep%20130%20Sept%2022,%202014.pptx%20New.pdf Liberia: Liberia Ebola SitRep no. 130, 22 September 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; The Ebola crisis in Liberia continued in 2015 only this time the disease had been narrowed down to only two of its counties [[Grand Cape Mount County]] and [[Montserrado County]]. The ELWA-3 treatment centre for Ebola in Liberia opened in August was so swamped with patients affected by the disease that some were even having to be turned away. There were several deaths and positive tests in Liberia until in September the WHO declared Liberia free of the virus. However, in April 2016 it was reported that there was a fatality that tested positively to the Ebola virus and by 4 April, 84 people were under observation after two confirmed cases in their region (Monrovia).

===Mental health===
A considerable amount of the population suffers from [[mental illness]]es or were mentally or physically traumatized, due to 14 years of intense civil conflict. A study by the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) in 2008 had showed that a staggering 40% of adults had shown symptoms of [[major depressive disorders]]. 44% of adults also had symptoms of PTSD, or [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Association of combatant status and sexual violence with health and mental health outcomes in postconflict Liberia|journal=JAMA|pmid=18698066 | doi=10.1001/jama.300.6.676|volume=300|issue=6|vauthors=Johnson K, Asher J, Rosborough S, Raja A, Panjabi R, Beadling C, Lawry L |pages=676–90|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was only one psychiatrist in the country at the time. It is impossible for 1 psychiatrist to be able to tend to over 1 million victims. In addition, [[E. S. Grant Mental Health Hospital]] was the only hospital for patients with mental illness. The hospital only had 80 beds, which left almost all those with traumatization unattended for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ford|first=Tamasin|title=Liberia Slowly Coming to Terms with Civil War's Impact on Mental Health|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/oct/10/liberia-civil-war-mental-health|accessdate=15 May 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 Oct 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIV/AIDS===
[[HIV/AIDS]] is one of the biggest diseases that has affected and is affecting Liberia to date. At any given time 33,000 people are living with HIV in Liberia of whom nearly 60% are female. Due to Liberia's incapability to treat this disease only about 1.2% of those affected survives the disease. The youth in Liberia is one of the biggest contributors to the extensive post-conflict HIV/AIDS problem. This is due to risky unprotected sex among adolescents without any form of contraception. A new social marketing condom program is being introduced to adolescents in vulnerable areas of the country in order to stop the spread of the disease and to  minimize many preventable deaths throughout the country.  In a 2012 study conducted by the African Health Sciences organisation over 20,400 condoms were provided to males and 316 to females in over 87 sites throughout Liberia. Communities were informed how to provide awareness of the dangers of HIV AIDS and how easily it can be prevented through the method of safe sex. Through the help of [[Population Services International]] in 2012 alone, the provision of contraception is estimated to have prevented 4.7 million unintended pregnancies and 13,600 maternal deaths, and to have provided 19 million couples with protection.

===Malnutrition and starvation===
Liberia is one of the most poverty-stricken countries in the world. The national human development organisation has stated that 75% of Liberia's people live of less than a dollar a day. Malnutrition is widespread: 40% of children have unnatural stunted growth and 7% of Liberia's population have highly acute malnutrition. This high level of starvation and malnutrition is linked to a major lack of food and the high level of early teenager mothers who have little knowledge of how to look after or treat their babies. The teenage mothers are usually single, sometimes due to rape. These unprivileged teenage mothers are too embarrassed to even breastfeed their babies to supply the nutrients they need to survive. They feel completely robbed of their freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/har08/files/har08_Liberia_featurestory.pdf|title=Addressing severe malnutrition in Liberia|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most major contributors to a dire lack of food in Liberia is Ebola. Ebola is heavily attacking Liberia's food supply leaving 4.1 million people to try and survive the epidemic on their own accord, with many families or even kids on their own having to travel long distances to try access clean water or bags of wheat or flour for their families in order to even try survive. 85% of families in Liberia have been forced to eat fewer meals, even as low as just one meal a day.

UNICEF and non-governmental organizations, or NGOs, are working with the [[Ministry of Health, Liberia|Ministry of Health]] to increase the awareness malnutrition, and make it a top priority of the country. Providing nutrition services is a major priority for the government, and it forms an important part of the National Health Policy.  In 2008, the health ministry developed a nutrition policy, which became a good start from the service’s promise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Humanitarian News and Analysis|url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report/87294/LIBERIA-Making-malnutrition-a-health-issue|accessdate=15 May 2013|newspaper=IRINnews}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this new policy, the health ministry aims to reduce the 39% chronic malnutrition rate by one-third by 2011, and fix one of the greatest issues of Liberia.

===Water and sanitation===
After the thirteen year long civil war, populations in the slums of Liberia skyrocketed. At this point around 60% of the population, or 2.5 million people, do not meet the poverty line. The people were left with little choice of where to obtain water or sanitation. To date Liberia still lives with bad sanitation conditions, with up to 10 people sharing the same toilet without disinfectant and an extreme lack of clean consumable water. For every four people living in Liberia, there is one living without access to any clean drinking water or substantial sanitation. Every five deaths that occur in Liberia is due to people drinking contaminated drinking water. Due to extreme public defecation, the World Health Organisation discovered that 58% of Liberia's water was contaminated with [[E coli]]. The E coli present in the water cause many illnesses such as diarrhea and vomiting throughout the population. The water crisis in Liberia has reached catastrophic levels. Action has been taken by many non-profit organizations, one of which is called Waves for Water who are providing water filters for clean drinking water to over 60,000 Liberian people.

===Dengue fever===
Africa accounts for 16% of all [[dengue fever]] infections in the world. Dengue fever has very limited attention in Liberia. There is a lack of laboratory research and the disease frequently goes undiagnosed, which is critical as without early detection dengue fever can be fatal. It is the ''[[Aedes]]'' type of mosquito that transmits four different types of fatal dengue fevers in Liberia.

===Female genital mutilation===
It is estimated that around half of all girls in Liberia have been subject to [[female genital mutilation]], which is culturally ingrained in their society. It is seen as an important precursor to marriage, to ensure a girl’s purity. It causes numerous health problems and can sometimes be fatal. Reuters reported on July 28, 2016, that Liberia’s parliament removed a ban on female genital mutilation from a new domestic violence law. The law listed it as a criminal offense, when it was first submitted to lawmakers in September 2015. Opposition from several politicians in April led to the FGM provision being removed from the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lack of FGM ban in domestic violence law fails Liberia's girls, activists say|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-liberia-fgm/lack-of-fgm-ban-in-domestic-violence-law-fails-liberias-girls-activists-say-idUSKCN10728F?il=0|website=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Health information management''' ('''HIM''') is [[information management]] applied to [[health]] and [[health care]]. It is the practice of acquiring, analyzing and protecting digital and traditional medical information vital to providing [[health care quality|quality patient care]]. With the widespread computerization of health records, traditional (paper-based) records are being replaced with [[electronic health record]]s (EHRs). The tools of [[health informatics]] and [[health information technology]] are continually improving to bring greater [[efficiency]] to information management in the [[health care system|health care sector]]. Both [[hospital information system]]s and [[HRHIS|Human Resource for Health Information System (HRHIS)]] are common implementations of HIM.

'''Health information management professionals''' plan [[information system]]s, develop [[health policy]], and identify current and future information needs. In addition, they may apply the science of [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]] to the collection, storage, analysis, use, and transmission of information to meet legal, professional, ethical and administrative records-keeping requirements of [[health care]] delivery.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. (2010). ''Classifying health workers''. Geneva: WHO.&lt;/ref&gt;  They work with clinical, epidemiological, demographic, financial, reference, and coded healthcare data. [[Registered Health Information Administrator|Health information administrators]] have been described to "play a critical role in the delivery of healthcare in the [[United States]] through their focus on the collection, maintenance and use of quality data to support the information-intensive and information-reliant healthcare system".&lt;ref&gt;(LaTour, Kathleen M., &amp; Maki, Shirley Eichenwald. (2010). Health information management concepts, principles, and practice. Chicago, Illinois: American Health Information Management Association.)(LaTour, &amp; Maki, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization (WHO)]] stated that the proper collection, management and use of information within healthcare systems "will determine the system's effectiveness in detecting health problems, defining priorities, identifying innovative solutions and allocating resources to improve health outcomes".&lt;ref&gt;Stansfield S. (2005). "Structuring information and incentives to improve health". ''Bulletin of the World Health Organization'', 83(8):562.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and development of HIM standards in the United States==

===HIM standards began with establishment of AHIMA===
Health information management's standards history is dated back to the introduction of the [[American Health Information Management Association]], founded in 1928 "when the [[American College of Surgeons]] established the Association of Record Librarians of North America (ARLNA) to 'elevate the standards of clinical records in hospitals and other medical institutions.'"&lt;ref&gt;AHIMA (2010). "[http://www.ahima.org/about/history.asp AHIMA History]". AHIMA. Retrieved 2010-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, AHIMA was known as American Association of Medical Record Librarians (AAMRL) and its members were known as medical record experts or [[librarian]]s who studied medical record science. The goal was to raise the standards of records keeping in hospitals and other healthcare facilities. The individuals involved in this profession were promoters for the successful management of clinical records to guarantee accuracy and precision. Over time, the organization's name changed to reflect the evolving field of health information management practices, eventually becoming the American Health Information Management Association. The association's current name is meant to cover the wide variety of areas which health professionals work in today.

AHIMA members affect the quality of patient information and patient care at every touch point in the healthcare delivery cycle. They often serve in bridge roles, connecting clinical, operational, and administrative functions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahima.org/popups/partner.asp Partner in the Delivery of Quality Healthcare]. (n.d.). Retrieved November 28, 2009, from American Health Information Management Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIMSS establishment in 1961 increased industry knowledge===
The [[Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society]] (HIMSS) was organized in 1961 as the Hospital Management Systems Society (HMSS), an independent, [[Unincorporated entity|unincorporated]], [[Non-profit organization|nonprofit]], voluntary association of individuals. It was preceded by increasing amounts of [[Management engineering (healthcare)|management engineering]] activity in healthcare during the 1950s, when teachings of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] and [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Sr.]] began to attract the attention of health leaders.&lt;ref&gt;HIMSS (2008). "[http://www.himss.org/content/files/HIMSS_HISTORY.pdf AHIMA History]". HIMSS Legacy Workgroup. Retrieved 2010-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

The HIMSS grew to include chapters, membership categories, publications, conventions, and continues to grow in different parts of the world via its [[Europe]], [[Asia Pacific]], and [[Middle East]]ern branches.&lt;ref&gt;HIMSS. [http://www.himss.org HIMSS.org]. Retrieved 1/8/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accredited HIM educational program development===
The [[Commission on Accreditation for Health Informatics and Information Management Education]] (CAHIIM) defines standards which [[higher education]] health information management and technology programs must meet to qualify for [[accreditation]]. Students who graduate from an accredited [[Associate's degree|associate's]], [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] or [[Academic certificate|certificate]] program are qualified to sit for their respective exams for certification as a [[Registered Health Information Technician]] (RHIT) – via graduation from an accredited associate or certification program or [[Registered Health Information Administrator]] (RHIA), which requires education through an accredited bachelor or certification program. Competency requirements are maintained by CAHIIM in their associate degree Entry-Level Competencies and Baccalaureate Degree Entry-Level Competencies definitions.&lt;ref&gt;AHIMA. 6/3/2004 [http://library.ahima.org/xpedio/groups/public/documents/internalproject_bok/bok1_036792.pdf HIM Associate Degree Entry-Level Competencies]. AHIMA Education Strategy Committee. Accessed 1/8/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AHIMA. 4/20/2004 [http://library.ahima.org/xpedio/groups/public/documents/internalproject_bok/bok1_036793.pdf HIM Baccalaureate Degree Entry-Level Competencies].

==Modern development==

===Electronic health records===
{{Main|Electronic health record}}
&lt;!--Full information on electronic health records can be found at its own article.--&gt;
The electronic health record has been continually expressed as an evolvement of health record-keeping. Because it is electronic, this means of record keeping has been both supported and debated in the health professional community and within the public realm.

In the United States, 89% of those who responded to a recent [[Wall Street Journal]] poll described themselves as "Very/Somewhat Confident" in their health care provider who used electronic health records compared to 71% of respondents who responded positively about their providers who didn't or don't use electronic health records.&lt;ref&gt;Wall Street Journal. [https://www.wsj.com/public/article/SB119565244262500549.html?mod=blog "Benefits of Electronic Health Records Seen as Outweighing Privacy Risks"]. Retrieved 1/8/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008, more than fifty-percent of [[Chief Information Officer]]s polled listed that they wanted ambulatory electronic health records in order to have the health information record available to move across each stage of health care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.himss.org/content/files/IntegrationConnectivitySurvey.pdf Healthcare Integration and Connectivity: Results of a Survey by the Enterprise Information Systems Steering Committee] page 4. HIMSS. Retrieved 1/8/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Health information managers are charged with the protection of patient privacy and are responsible for training their employees in the proper handling and usage of the confidential information entrusted to them. With the rise of technology's importance in healthcare, health information managers must remain competent with the use of information databases that generate crucial reports for administrators and physicians.

=== Educational programs ===
{{main|List of CAHIIM-accredited HIM Programs in the United States}}

The requisites and accreditation processes for health information management education and professional activity vary across jurisdictions.

In the United States, the CAHIIM requires continued accreditation for accredited programs in health information management. The current standard is that accreditation may be maintained with periodic site visits, submission of an annual report, informing CAHIIM of adverse changes within the program and paying CAHIIM administrative fees.&lt;ref&gt;CAHIIM. [http://library.ahima.org/xpedio/groups/public/documents/accreditation/bok1_044387.pdf 2005 Interpretation of Standards: Associate Degree] section VI.F. Retrieved 1/8/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CAHIIM. [http://library.ahima.org/xpedio/groups/public/documents/accreditation/bok1_044386.pdf Interpretation of Standards: Baccalaureate Degree] section VI.F. Retrieved 1/8/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  HIM students may opt to participate in a full-time [[Bridge program (higher education)|bridge program]] called the Joint Bachelor of Science/Masters Program. With this program, students can achieve both the Bachelor of Science in Health Information Management and the Master of Health Services Administration Program (BSHIM/MHSA). The full-time bridge program allows students to achieve both degrees in five years. Students pursuing the BSHIM/MHSA will be prepared to assume management and executive positions in health-related organizations such as: hospitals, managed care organizations, health information system developers and vendors, and [[pharmacy|pharmaceutical]] companies, and bring their knowledge in HIM to these positions.

In Canada, graduates of Canadian Health Information Management Association (CHIMA) programs are eligible to write a national certification examination to pursue a profession in HIM.&lt;ref&gt;Alberta Occupational Profiles, 2011. ''Health Information Management Professional'' http://alis.alberta.ca/occinfo/Content/RequestAction.asp?aspAction=GetHTMLProfile&amp;format=html&amp;OCCPRO_ID=71002536&lt;/ref&gt;

====Online program availability====
There are many programs that are also available online. Online students collaborate with in-class students using internet technology. With online learning, students are allowed to go through the programs at their own pace. Online students are included in class through group lectures that are recorded and put online, discussion boards and are members of group projects with in-class students. Some online students are even allowed to attend some classes on campus and take some classes online.

The CAHIIM lists accredited online programs on its website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cahiim.org/accredpgms.asp CAHIIM.org] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120721005333/http://www.cahiim.org/accredpgms.asp |date=2012-07-21 }}. Retrieved 1/8/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Further education for health information professionals====
Education is an important aspect in being successful in the world of health information management. Aside from initial credentials, health information professionals may wish to pursue a Masters of Health Information Management, [[Masters of Business Administration]], [[Masters of Health Administration]], or other Masters programs in health data management, information technology and systems, and organization and management. Gaining further education advances the health professional's career and qualifies the individual for upper-management positions.

==Canada (CHIMA)==
In Canada, current HIM employees are mostly called the "Health Information Management Professionals", with the designation of "Certified Health Information Manager" (CHIM).

==Elements==
Healthcare quality and safety require that the right information be available at the right time to support patient care and health system management decisions. Gaining consensus on essential data content and documentation standards is a necessary prerequisite for high-quality data in the interconnected healthcare system of the future. Continuous quality management of data standards and content is key to ensuring that information is usable and actionable.&lt;ref&gt;Mervat Abdelhak et al.: “Health Information: Management of a Strategic Resource”, Second Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

===Records===
*The '''patient health record''' is the primary legal record documenting the health care services provided to a person in any aspect of the health care system. The term includes routine clinical or office records, records of care in any health related setting, preventive care, lifestyle evaluation, research protocols and various clinical databases. This repository of information about a single patient is generated by health care professionals as a direct result of interaction with a patient or with individuals who have personal knowledge of the patient.
*The '''primary patient record''' is the record that is used by health care professionals while providing patient care services to review patient data or document their own observations, actions, or instructions.
*The '''secondary patient record''' is a record that is derived from the primary record and contains selected data elements to aid non clinical persons in supporting, evaluating and advancing patient care.  Patient care support refers to administration, regulation, and payment functions.

===Practices===

====Methods to ensure Data Quality====
The accuracy of data depends on the manual or computer information system design for collecting, recording, storing, processing, accessing and displaying data as well as the ability and follow- through of the people involved in each phase of these activities. Everyone involved with documenting or using health information is responsible for its quality. According to AHIMA’s Data Quality Management Model, there are four key processes for data:

#'''Application''': the purpose for which the data are collected.
#'''Collection''': the processes by which data elements are accumulated.
#'''Warehousing''': the processes and systems used to store and maintain data and data journals.
#'''Analysis''': the process of translating data into information utilized for an application.

Each aspect is analyzed with 10 different data characteristics:

#'''Accuracy''': Data are the correct values and are valid.
#'''Accessibility''': Data items should be easily obtainable and legal to collect.
#'''Comprehensiveness''': All required data items are included. Ensure that the entire scope of the data is collected and document intentional limitations.
#'''Consistency''': The value of the data should be reliable and the same across applications.
#'''Currency''': The data should be up to date. A datum value is up to date if it is current for a specific point in time. It is outdate if it was current at some preceding time yet incorrect at a later time.
#'''Definition''': Clear definitions should be provided so that current and future data users will know what the data mean. Each data element should have clear meaning and acceptable values.
#'''Granularity''': The attributes and values of data should be defined at the correct level of detail.
#'''Precision''': Data values should be just large enough to support the application or process.
#'''Relevancy''': The data are meaningful to the performance of the process or application for which they are collected.
#'''Timeliness''': Timeliness is determined by how the data are being used and their context.

==Health information professionals==
HIM is a very broad and successful field for [[health care provider|health care professionals]]. There are several career opportunities in Health Information Management and many different traditional and non-traditional settings for an HIM professional to work within.

*Traditional settings include: Managing an HIM medical records department, [[cancer registry]], [[Medical classification|coding]], trauma registry, [[Medical transcription|transcription]], [[Quality management|quality improvement]], [[Release of information department|release of information]], patient admissions, compliance auditor, physician accreditation, utilization review, physician offices and [[risk management]].
*Non-traditional settings include: consulting firms, government agencies, law firms, insurance companies, correctional facilities, extended care facilities, pharmaceutical research, information technology and [[medical software]] companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocoS103.htm Medical Records and Health Information Technicians]. Retrieved 1/8/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health information managers===
Professional health information managers manage and construct health information programs to guarantee they accommodate medical, legal, and ethical standards. They play a crucial role in the maintenance, collection, and analyzing of data that is received by doctors, nurses, and other healthcare players. In return these healthcare data contributors rely on the information to deliver quality healthcare. Managers must work with a group of information technicians to guarantee that the patient's medical records are accurate and are available when needed.

In the United States, health information managers are typically certified as a [[Registered Health Information Administrator]] (RHIA) after achieving a bachelor's degree in health informatics or health information management from a school accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Health Informatics and Information Management Education (CAHIIM) and after passing their respective certification exam.&lt;ref&gt;AHIMA. [http://www.ahima.org/certification/rhia/requirements.aspx Eligibility Requirements: Registered Health Information Administrator]. Retrieved 1/8/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Certified Health Informatics Systems Professional (CHISP) certification offered by American Society of Health Informatics Managers (ASHIM)&lt;ref&gt;CHISP Healthcare IT certification. [http://ashim.org/certification/ CHISP Certification Requirement ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307012558/http://ashim.org/certification/ |date=2010-03-07 }}. Retrieved 3/2/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; is to credit a working level IT or clinical professional who is able to support physician adoption of Health IT.  A CHISP professional needs to process knowledge of the health care environment, Health IT, IT, and soft skills including communication skills.

RHIAs usually assume a managerial position that interacts with all levels of an organization that use patient data in decision making and everyday operations.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago State University [http://www.csu.edu/healthsciences/healthinformationadministration/documents/profession.pdf Profession]. Retrieved 1/8/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; They may work in a broad range of settings that span the continuum of healthcare including office based physician practices, nursing homes, home health agencies, mental health facilities, and public health agencies.

Health information managers may specialize in registry management, data management, and data quality among other areas.

===Medical records and Health information technicians===
{{See also|Clinical coder}}
Medical records (MR) and Health information technicians (HIT) are described as having the following duties according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Occupational Outlook Handbook:&lt;ref&gt;Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010-11 Edition. [http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocoS103.htm Medical Records and Health Information Technicians]. Retrieved 1/8/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;assemble patients' health information including medical history, symptoms, examination results, diagnostic tests, treatment methods, and all other healthcare provider services. Technicians organize and manage health information data by ensuring its quality, accuracy, accessibility, and security. They regularly communicate with physicians and other healthcare professionals to clarify diagnoses or to obtain additional information.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The International Labour Organization's [[International Standard Classification of Occupations]] further notes: "Occupations included in this category require knowledge of medical terminology, legal aspects of health information, health data standards, and computer- or paper-based data management as obtained through formal education and/or prolonged on-the-job training.&lt;ref&gt;International Standard Classification of Occupations, 2008 revision: Unit Group 3252: Medical records and health information technicians. http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

MRHITs usually work in hospitals. However they also work in a variety of other healthcare settings, including office based physician practices, [[nursing home]]s, [[home care|home health agencies]], [[Psychiatric hospital|mental health facilities]], and public health agencies. Technicians who specialize in coding are called [[medical coder]]s or coding specialists.

In the United States, health information technicians are certified as a [[Registered Health Information Technician]] (RHIT) after completing an associate degree in [[health information technology]] from a school accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Health Informatics and Information Management Education (CAHIIM) before they may take their certification exam.&lt;ref&gt;AHIMA (2008).

'''Herman Wedel Major''' (23 February 1814 &amp;ndash; 26 September 1854) was a Norwegian psychiatrist. He is regarded as the father of the first Norwegian psychiatric hospital, [[Gaustad Hospital]] (''Gaustad sykehus'') and of the Norwegian Mental Health Act of 1848 regarding [[mental illness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://tidsskriftet.no/article/226458

Major was born at the [[Kristiansand]] borough of [[Oddernes]] in [[Vest-Agder]], Norway.  He was one of nine children born to Irish immigrant Robert Gonsalvo Major (1766–1839) and Benedicte Sophie Weidemann (1783–1859). His father had left [[Ireland]] in the aftermath of the  [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/irish_reb_01.shtml|title=  The 1798 Irish Rebellion|publisher= BBC |accessdate= August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major became a medical student in 1832 and was licensed as a physician in November 1842.
He received a grant from the [[Norwegian Parliament]] and traveled to institutions in [[Schleswig]], [[Great Britain]], [[France]] and [[Belgium]] to study the conditions for the mentally ill (1843-1845). Major was for several years a doctor at the Oslo Hospital and was authorized as manager there from 1851.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://lokalhistoriewiki.no/index.php/Oslo_Hospital|title=  Oslo Hospital	|publisher=   lokalhistoriewiki.no|accessdate= August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1845, the Norwegian Parliament allocated funds to purchase land for an intended state asylum. In 1847, [[Gaustad]] outside [[Oslo|Christiania]] (now Oslo) submitted a plan and in 1850 it was formally decided that the institution should be built there. Gaustad Hospital was not completed until 1855, after the death of Herman Wedel Major.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Herman Wedel Major |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |url=http://www.snl.no/Herman_Wedel_Major |language=Norwegian | accessdate=19 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1850, Major married Ida Cathrine Grüning (1821-1854). They had two daughters. He and his family all died in the ship collision between the American [[Paddle steamer]] ''[[SS Arctic]]'' and the French steamship ''[[SS Vesta]]'' on 26 September 1854 off the coast of [[Newfoundland]].&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Herman Wedel Major |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Nils |last=Retterstøl |authorlink=Nils Retterstøl |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]] |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Herman_Wedel_Major/utdypning |language=Norwegian|accessdate=19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Human Tissue Authority logo.svg|thumb|Human Tissue Authority logo]]
The '''Human Tissue Authority''' ('''HTA''') is an executive [[non-departmental public body]] of the [[Department of Health (UK)|Department of Health]] of the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arm's length bodies|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/arms-length-bodies/our-arms-length-bodies|website=GOV.UK|accessdate=19 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It regulates the removal, storage, use and disposal of human bodies, organs and tissue for a number of scheduled purposes such as research, transplantation, and education and training.

It was created by the [[Human Tissue Act 2004]] and came into being on 1 April 2005 and its statutory functions began on 1 April 2006. The authority was originally chaired by [[Baroness Hayman]] followed, in 2006, by Shirley Harrison, from January 2010-2018 by Baroness [[Diana Warwick]] and since March 2018 by [[Nicola Blackwood]].&lt;ref name="Biographies"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.hta.gov.uk/about-us/our-people | title=Biographies: Nicola Blackwood | publisher=Human Tissue Authority | accessdate=August 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its objectives are to:

:''...be the regulating authority for matters relating to activities such as anatomical and post-mortem examinations, transplantations and the storage of human material for education, training and research.''

It also acts as the UK competent authority under the [[European Union|EU]] Tissue and Cells [[EU Tissue Directive|Directives]].

==The Human Tissue Act==
{{main|Human Tissue Act 2004}}
The Human Tissue Act 2004 repeals and replaces the Human Tissue Act 1961, the Anatomy Act 1984 and the Human Organ Transplants Act 1989 as they relate to England and Wales, and the corresponding Orders in Northern Ireland. The [[ULTRA (UK agency)]] and the post of HM Inspector of Anatomy were abolished and their functions transferred to the Authority.

The Act makes ''consent'' the fundamental principle underpinning the lawful storage and use of body parts, organs and tissue from the living or the deceased for specified health-related purposes and public display. It also covers the removal of such material from the deceased. It lists the purposes for which consent is required (the ''scheduled purposes'').

The Act notably prohibited private individuals from covertly collecting biological samples, such as hair and fingernails, for [[DNA profiling|DNA analysis]], but excluded medical and criminal investigations from the offence.&lt;ref name="HTA"&gt;{{Cite legislation UK 
  | type = act
  | year = 2004
  | chapter = 30
  | act = Human Tissue Act
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Code of Conduct, and Jurisdiction==
According to the Human Tissue Act, the HTA and its authority are governed by a code of conduct for the handling of human tissue, and the bodies of the deceased,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Codes of Practice and Standards|url=https://www.hta.gov.uk/hta-codes-practice-and-standards-0|website=Human Tissue Authority|accessdate=19 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but does not give the HTA authority over exhumed remains from archaeological sites.&lt;ref name="HTA" /&gt;

The Act governs England, Wales and Northern Ireland. There is separate legislation in Scotland, the [[Human Tissue (Scotland) Act 2006]] and the Authority performs certain tasks on behalf of the [[Scottish Government]] (approval of living donation and licensing of establishments storing tissue for human application).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Tissue (Scotland) Act 2006: A Guide to Its Implications tor NHS Scotland|url=https://www.hta.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Information_about_HT_(Scotland)_Act.pdf|website=Human Tissue Authority|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Authority consists of a Chair and eleven Members&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hta.gov.uk/about-us/our-people|title=Biographies {{!}} Human Tissue Authority|website=www.hta.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Nine members have been appointed by the [[Secretary of State for Health]], one appointed by the [[Welsh Government]], and one member is appointed by the [[Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety]] in Northern Ireland.

The professional members of the board come from medical and scientific backgrounds, and the lay members bring a wide range of business, commercial and public sector experience.

The members of the authority are as follows:
*[[Nicola Blackwood]] (Chair)
*Amanda Gibbon
*Bill Horne
*Dr Lorna Williamson OBE
*Dr Stuart Dollow
*Glenn Houston
*Hossam Abdalla
*Professor Andy Hall
*Professor Anthony Warrens

Notably, in people who do not have the genetic disorder hypobetalipoproteinemia, a low cholesterol level may be a marker for poor nutrition, wasting disease, cancer, hyperthyroidism, and liver disease.

==Causes==
One form is thought to be caused by mutated [[apolipoprotein B]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Young SG |title=Familial hypobetalipoproteinemia associated with a mutant species of apolipoprotein B (B-46) |journal=[[N.

Another form is associated with [[microsomal triglyceride transfer protein]] which causes [[abetalipoproteinemia]].

A third form, [[chylomicron retention disease]] (CRD), is associated with [[SARA2]].&lt;ref name="pmid17570373"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tarugi P |title=Molecular diagnosis of hypobetalipoproteinemia: an ENID review |journal=Atherosclerosis |volume=195 |issue=2 |pages=e19–27 |date=December 2007 |pmid=17570373 |doi=10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2007.05.003 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0021-9150(07)00328-0 |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Averna M |author3=Di Leo E |display-authors=3 |last4=Cefalu |first4=A |last5=Noto |first5=D |last6=Magnolo |first6=L |last7=Cattin |first7=L |last8=Bertolini |first8=S |last9=Calandra |first9=S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Typically in hypobetalipoproteinemia, plasma cholesterol levels will be around 80–120&amp;nbsp;mg/dL, LDL cholesterol will be around 50–80&amp;nbsp;mg/dL.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

The '''Louis Bonduelle Foundation''', set up in 2004, is the Bonduelle group's corporate foundation. It acts internationally with the aim of changing eating habits in a sustainable manner, by providing everyone with the means of bringing vegetables into their daily life.

It undertakes to inform, raise awareness, support research and act on the ground.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
The Louis Bonduelle Foundation was set up in 2004 for two reasons. Public health problems linked to poor diet, especially obesity, continue to grow worryingly whereas products guaranteeing good nutritional balance are available throughout the year at affordable prices. It was in this context of misinformation and lack of motivation in terms of vegetable consumption that Bonduelle decided to set up its corporate foundation.

=== The Founders ===
Two Bonduelle group subsidiaries are the founders of the corporate foundation: Bonduelle SAS and Bonduelle Conserve International.

=== Origin of the Foundation's name===
The Foundation bears the name of Louis Bonduelle, who started the first Bonduelle company. In 1853, Louis Bonduelle-Dalle and his friend Louis Lesaffre-Roussel decided to form a partnership to start a grain and juniper distillery under the name of "Lesaffre et Bonduelle, Alcools de l’Abbaye"

=== Significant dates ===
* In 2005, the Louis Bonduelle Foundation was set up in Italy and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110722025329/http://www.lejourdulegume.fr/ "Day of the Vegetable"] was launched in France. Kits were distributed to participating restaurateurs to make Tuesdays the day of the vegetable (promotion of vegetables in dishes offered, activities based around their benefits, etc.)
* In 2006, the first [http://www.fondation-louisbonduelle.org/france/en/health-professionals/search-support/louis-bonduelle-research-award.html Louis Bonduelle Research Award] for €10,000 was set up to reward research in the field of nutrition or eating habits, in any subject area: medicine, physiology, sociology, agronomy, etc.
* In 2007, the Louis Bonduelle Foundation was set up in Benelux (Belgium and the Netherlands) and the first call for projects was launched in France: the Foundation now supports local initiatives launched by associations, schools, etc. to help individuals improve their eating habits.
* In 2008, the Foundation decided to set up an annual day conference for those involved in changes in eating habits: the Louis Bonduelle Foundation Conference. Each year, experts talk on a specific nutrition-related theme.
* In 2010, the Louis Bonduelle Foundation was set up in Canada.

== How the Foundation operates ==

The Louis Bonduelle Foundation is managed by a Board of Directors with seven members appointed and reappointed by the founder; their positions are unpaid. There are three independent members chosen by the founder for their experience in the corporate foundation's area of work and four members are representatives of the Bonduelle group.

== The Foundation's Mission ==

=== Supporting research ===
The Louis Bonduelle Foundation encourages scientific research (medical, nutritional, sociological and agronomic) to better understand the interactions between eating habits, vegetables and health. Two Research Awards are granted: the Louis Bonduelle Prize for young researchers and the [http://www.fondation-louisbonduelle.org/france/en/health-professionals/search-support/a-partnership-to-fight-childhood-obesity.html ECOG/Louis Bonduelle Foundation Prize] for the fight against child obesity. The Louis Bonduelle Foundation is also joint-founder of the Fondation Coeur et Artères ([http://www.fondation-louisbonduelle.org/france/en/health-professionals/search-support/partnership-with-the-heart-and-arteries-foundation.html Heart and Arteries Foundation]) which is involved in the fight against cardiovascular diseases.

=== Louis Bonduelle Foundation Conference ===
Each year, the Louis Bonduelle Foundation organises a day conference based on a scientific subject related to vegetables and nutrition. This event, known as the Louis Bonduelle Foundation Conference, involves those concerned with changes in eating habits such as experts, research directors and project developers.

== Act in the field ==
Many actions are launched by schools and associations to facilitate people's access to fruit and vegetables. The Louis Bonduelle Foundation has supported these initiatives since 2008 with two [[Call for proposal|calls for proposals]] per year.
In addition, the Foundation also carries out its own projects aimed at improving eating habits. Eleven initiatives have been launched in [[Europe]] since 2005 for different categories of people such as children, the elderly or people lacking job security.

== Inform the public and health professionals ==
Through its website, and its exhibitions and conferences, the Louis Bonduelle Foundation provides information to the general public, health professionals, teachers, etc. 
This relates to recent news on nutrition, the benefits of vegetables, and simple acts to improve consumption of fruit and vegetables. The Foundation also gives information on the different projects it supports and its various calls for proposals.

'''MedAccred''' is an accreditation program for critical process manufacturing operations in the production of [[medical devices]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MedAccred to track medical industry standards {{!}} Plastics News|url=http://www.plasticsnews.com/article/20160708/NEWS/160709865/medaccred-to-track-medical-industry-standards|website=www.plasticsnews.com|accessdate=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; MedAccred is an industry managed program with the medical device industry having responsibility for all decisions regarding program operations, development, and the decision to award accreditations. The MedAccred program is administered on behalf of the medical device industry by the Performance Review Institute (PRI), a not-for-profit affiliate of [[SAE International]]. Participants in the MedAccred program consist of medical device [[OEMs]], [[contract manufacturer]]s and suppliers who work together to develop industry-wide audit criteria and provide accreditation of critical manufacturing process suppliers to improve product quality.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

== History ==

MedAccred was created following a medical device industry roundtable in held in [[Chicago]], IL in December 2012.  Companies present at the roundtable included [[Abbot Laboratories]], [[Baxter International]], [[Beckman Coulter]], [[Boston Scientific]], Brunk Industries, [[DePuy|DePuy Synthes]], [[GE Healthcare]], [[Medtronic]], Paragon Medical, [[Philips]], [[Stryker]], Symmetry Medical, [[Terumo|Terumo Cardiovascular Systems]] and [[Zimmer Biomet]].  Proof of concept audits based on the [[Nadcap]] program audit criteria were conducted in 2013.  Briefings on the MedAccred program were held with the [[FDA]] [[Center for Devices and Radiological Health|Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH)]] Office of Compliance and the FDA’s Office of Global Operations within the Office of the Commissioner.The initial subscribing companies were [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]], [[Philips]] and [[Stryker]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} By 2018, the list of subscribing companies had grown to include [[Baxter International|Baxter]], [[Boston Scientific]] and [[Medtronic]], in addition to the initial subscribing companies. 

In 2014, the initial technical Task Groups were created in the critical process areas of Electronics – [[PCB Assembly|PCBAs]], Electronics – Cable and Wire Harness, [[Heat treating|Heat Treating]], [[Sterilization (microbiology)|Sterilization]] and [[Welding]].  The Plastics Task Group and [[Process Validation]] sub-team were created in 2015.  By 2018, the list of critical process areas had grown to include [[Plastics extrusion|Plastics - Extrusion]], Plastics - [[Injection moulding|Injection Molding]], Plastics - Mechanical Assembly, Electronics - Printed Boards (Bare Boards), and Sterile Device Packaging as well. 

The first MedAccred accreditation was issued to Solar Atmospheres of Souderton, PA (USA) for [[Heat treating|Heat Treating]] in 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.todaysmedicaldevelopments.com/article/medaccred-solar-atmospheres-medical-device-manufacturing-accreditation-51915/|title=Solar Atmospheres receives 1st MedAccred accreditation|last=|first=|date=19 May 2015|website=Today's Medical Developments|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The US [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] subsequently recognized the Aerospace Heat Treating Standard AMS 2750, which is published by [[SAE International]] and used by MedAccred&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medtech.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/MT105137/Aerospace-Heat-Treating-Standard-Recognized-By-US-FDA-Giving-Nudge-To-MedAccred-SupplierControl-Prog|title=Aerospace Heat Treating Standard Recognized By US FDA, Giving Nudge To MedAccred Supplier-Control Program|last=Schmitt|first=Shawn|date=11 July 2017|website=MedTech Insight|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Accreditations have since been granted to companies in Mexico, Costa Rica, China, United Kingdom, France, Romania, Austria and Malaysia as well.

MedAccred was added to the [[AdvaMed]] Resource Center, Case for Quality Library in August 2015&lt;ref&gt;http://advamed.org/res&lt;/ref&gt; and has since been noted in a number of industry publications as being a significant activity for the [[Medical device|medical devices]] industry&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.powertransmission.com/issues/0318/medaccred.pdf|title=MedAccred Rising to Ubiquity|last=Cannella|first=Alex|date=March 2018|website=Power Transmission magazine|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.devicemed.fr/dossiers/reglementation/medaccred-un-train-a-prendre-en-marche-pour-les-europeens/15724?utm_content=article&amp;utm_medium=mail&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter-20180502&amp;utm_source=newsletter|title=MedAccred: A Train to be Taken for Europeans|last=Renard|first=Patrick|date=30 April 2018|website=Device Med|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cdn.p-r-i.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/22142930/MedAccred-feature-article-Medtech-Insight_v2.pdf|title=A Stronger Supply Chain: Stryker Tying Process Vendors to MedAccred; Others May Follow Suit as FDA Takes Notice|last=Schmitt|first=Shawn|date=August 2017|website=MedTech Insight|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Melafix''' (a proprietary name) is an all-natural [[aquarium]] [[antibiotic]] consisting of an [[essential oil]] of the [[Melaleuca]] genus. Contrary to popular opinion it is not made from the common [[Melaleuca|Tea tree]], ''Melaleuca alternifolia'', but from ''[[Melaleuca leucadendra]]'', also known as the '''[[Cajeput Tree]]'''. This is confirmed by the manufacturer's Safety Data Sheet.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://cms.marsfishcare.com/files/msds/melafix_111909.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912230727/http://cms.marsfishcare.com/files/msds/melafix_111909.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a wide-range antibiotic product, and thus is effective for a wide variety of mild gram positive bacterial infections, such as [[fin rot]]. However, it is generally ineffective against aquatic [[parasitism|parasites]] and is typically used for treating the wounds caused by them in order to prevent secondary infection by other microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ponddoc.com/WhatsUpDoc/ProductProfiles/Melafix.htm Melafix - Helpful Tonic for Bacterial Problems such as Fin Rot on Koi and Goldfish]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy &amp; Dangers==

Some consider there to be real dangers with the use of Melafix in fish aquariums. Being that Melafix is an oil based product, it is said that the oil can make it difficult for fish that breathe air. There are theories for why this happens, but what has been shown is if proper water parameters are maintained, there's generally not an issue. 

Melafix needs to be used as directed. Many issues that come from the use of Melafix is the fact that it is being used incorrectly. The medication is a mild antibiotic. It can be used to treat mild infections, but used in other ways than intended, could result in the real problem not being treated correctly and Melafix appearing to be the cause of the issue. Knowing the infection and properly treating is a must.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Melafix Dangers; Fish as Pets|url=http://www.fish-as-pets.com/2008/12/melafix-dangers-labyrinth-fish.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various '''models of deafness''' are rooted in either the social or biological sciences. These are the ''medical'' (or ''infirmity'') ''model'', the ''social model'', and the ''cultural model''. The model used can affect how deaf persons are treated and their identity.  In the medical model, deafness is viewed as an undesirable condition, to be so treated.  Within the social model, the design of the deaf person's environment is viewed as the major disabling factor.  In the cultural model, [[Deaf culture|the Deaf]] belong to a culture in which they are neither infirm nor disabled.

[[Physicians]] and [[scientists]] are often labeled as adherents of the medical model by Deaf individuals, who contrast it with their own cultural model. However, many of those who are so labeled dispute its validity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The social model seeks to illuminate the difficulties that deaf individuals face in their social environment.

== Medical model ==
{{See|Medical model of disability}}
The medical model of deafness is viewed by advocates for the deaf{{Who|date=June 2011}} as originating from medical, social welfare and majority cultural notions of the absence of the ability to hear as being an illness or a physical [[disability]]. It stems from a more comprehensive and far-reaching [[medical model of disability]]. People who experience hearing loss after acquiring a mastery of spoken language usually identify with this model. Also, people who describe themselves as "hard-of-hearing" or "[[hearing impairment|hearing impaired]]" are likely to identify with it.

The medical model encompasses the idea that an individual affected by hearing impairment may be admired for their accommodation of the "infirmity" (i.e., [[illness]]), or their courage in struggling with a condition seen as undesirable. Deafness is therefore conceptualized from a "personal tragedy" stance, with implicit questions naturally arising such as:  "By what criteria and by whom is the impairment construed as an infirmity; how did the infirmity arise; what are the risks and benefits of the available treatment, if any; what can be done to minimize the disabling effects of the infirmity?"

Medical ethics and law dictate that it is up to the patient (or the patient's legal representative) to decide the treatments he or she wishes. For this very reason, the question as to whether deafness is physical impairment or personal tragedy to be overcome is secondary to medical doctors and health professions. Similarly, doctors and scientists who engage in research are doing so simply because there is demand for information and for techniques which can restore hearing.

The view that deafness is a "[[disability]]" has economic consequences in political environments concerned with [[social welfare]]. It is the basis on which the governments in many developed countries provide financial support for the cost of [[cochlear implant]]s and other therapies. It is also the basis on which governments provide deaf people with financial support and educational services which are not available for members of other cultural minority groups.

== Social model ==
{{Unclear section|hints that society has an obligation to make the environment better for the sake of the "disabled"|date=June 2011}}
{{See|Social model of disability}}

The social model of deafness is a part of a more comprehensive and far-reaching [[social model of disability]] whose advocates seek to distinguish and distance from the medical model.  The concept of social disability arose in large part from deaf and disabled people themselves, their families, friends, and associated social and political networks.  Invoked here are professionals in the human services fields and the social sciences instead of physicians and the physical sciences. In defining disability, proponents of this model{{Who|date=November 2013}} make two assertions concerning the view of disability as oppression:

# first, that "the concept of disability is in part a historical product of social forces, not merely a biological necessity"; and
# secondly, that "the disabled mode of living has value in its own right, even as the conditions that gave rise to the disability are condemned."{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Disabled people affirm that the design of the environment often disables them.  In better-designed environments, they are disabled less, or not at all. This affirmation arises in part from the understanding that while medical intervention can improve the health issues inherent in certain forms of disability, it does not address societal issues that prevail regardless of the extent or success of medical intervention.  In conjunction with this view of changing the environment from a disabling to an enabling atmosphere, advocates of the social model persevere in the de-institutionalization of disabled persons by encouraging maximum integration with non-disabled peers, especially, but not exclusively, in the school environment.

== Cultural model ==
{{See|Deaf culture|Deafhood}}
The cultural model of deafness arises from, but is not limited to, deaf people themselves, especially congenitally deaf people whose primary language is the [[sign language]] of their nation or community, as well as their children, families, friends and other members of their social networks. Invoked also are people within the social science professions which seek to identify, define and conceptualize the very essence of what constitutes a culture or cultural model of human experience. Also included are professionals in mediating roles between cultures, notably persons engaged in activities of [[interpreting|simultaneous interpretation]], and schools.  This cultural model of deafness represents the natural evolution of the social networks of a minority language group.  In this view the conceptualization of deafness is seen from a "community asset" stance. From the conceptual framework of the cultural model come implicit questions, such as: How is deafness influenced by the physical and social environment in which it is embedded; What are the interdependent values, [[mores]], art forms, traditions, organizations, and language that characterize this culture?

Both the medical model and the social model are seen, at the least, to be in conflict with, and at the most, inapplicable to deafness when viewed from the cultural model of deafness.

=== Cultural deafness and the medical model ===


In contrast to the medical model of Deafness, the deaf community, rather than embrace the view that deafness is a "personal tragedy", sees all aspects of the deaf experience as positive. The birth of a deaf child is seen as a cause for celebration.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Deaf people point to the perspective on child rearing they share with hearing people. Both hearing and deaf parents understand that it is easier for a hearing parent to raise a hearing child because of their intimate understanding of the hearing state of being. It follows that a deaf parent will have an easier experiences raising a deaf child since deaf parents have an intimate understanding of the deaf state of being. Evidence of deaf parental success is revealed in scholastic achievement. Deaf children who have deaf parents that communicate in sign language perform better than all other deaf children in academic achievement and acquisition of the majority language regardless of the manner in which the children adapted to deafness.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} This includes children who adapted using speech and [[lipreading]], prosthetic devices such as the [[cochlear implant]], artificial language systems such as Signing Exact English and Cued Speech, and [[hearing aid]] technology{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}.

According to research in the [[social sciences]], membership in the deaf community is a matter of [[culturally determined]] behaviors and not of medical diagnosis. Thus membership is not seen as the act of admittance by an insider group or even by anyone at all, but by examining individual behavior to determine how closely it resembles the known culturally determined behaviors found in the community of deaf people. Since sign language stands as the single most valued aspect of deaf culture, it reveals whether an individual belongs to this [[minority language|language minority]] in the same manner as embracing the Spanish language reveals identity with [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic-American culture]], another example of a language minority.  Groups disadvantaged by majority culture and practices, such as the deaf community, have commonalities with other groups.  For example, people with disabilities, gay people, and women are not linguistic minorities, as are members of the deaf community, since their culturally determined behaviors do not center on a unifying language as in the communities of Hispanic-Americans and Native-Americans.  Gay culture and American deaf culture, both of which experience the disadvantages of being minority cultures, bear resemblance to one another in that most members of these two minority groups do not share their minority identity with their parents and cannot develop it at home. However, gay culture does not rally around a unifying language as is seen with a minority language group like the community of deaf people.

=== Cultural deafness and the social model ===
{{Unref sect|date=March 2016}}
Members of the deaf communities most certainly do find a parallel with peoples with disabilities. However, a line is drawn in deaf culture in the case of disabilities when "respecting that unique organization of life while regretting the conditions that create it"{{cn|date=March 2016}} represents a conception of the highest quality of life. It is a conception that is considered inappropriate in deaf culture.

The residential schools for deaf children provide an example for illustration.  The residential schools serve as a vital link in the transmission of deaf culture and language and typically provide a rich quality of life. Deaf cultural values find abhorrent occasional proposals to dismantle the residential schools since they are considered the best possible environment, the highest quality of life, in which to acquire and enrich sign language fluency and pass on Deaf cultural values that serve as tools and solutions to challenges in a predominantly hearing world.{{Cn|date=March 2016}}  This view sharply contrasts with the Social Model of Disability, which finds abhorrent segregated schooling of disabled children in special residential schools and prefers the "all-inclusive" environment of neighborhood schools.

The deaf cultural model points out that these acts also demonstrate an example of respecting and embracing the totality of the deaf experience rather than regretting it.  The conflict or inappropriateness of the Social Model rests on this and many other examples in which efforts to promote inclusion at every level produces negative impact on deaf people.  Proponents of the social model, understandably, are generally aware of this dilemma and have a great respect for deaf cultural views.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

=== Summary on cultural deafness ===

As there is a deaf community with its own language and culture, so there is a cultural frame in which to be deaf is not to be infirm or disabled.  To the contrary, it is an asset of and for the deaf community to be deaf in behavior, values, knowledge and fluency in sign language.  It is within this community bonded by shared culture and language that lives defined by diagnosis, disadvantages imposed by majority beliefs and practices, and disabilities tied to inappropriate models of language and social enrichment, that, according to the cultural model of deafness, deaf people find themselves both enabled and socially advantaged.  The experience of a language minority such as the deaf thus seen, amounts to a social disadvantage no more or less troubling than it would be for any language minority.  In terms of its effect on mental health, deaf cultural attitudes conclude that a minority language group's disadvantages are preferred to a lifetime of viewing one's self or one's group as infirm or disabled.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6953">The '''National Survey of Health &amp; Development''' is a [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] (MRC) longitudinal survey of people born in Britain in March 1946. It is "the longest continually running major birth cohort study in the world and is one of the longest-running studies of human development. "&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pearson|2016|p=345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The 1946  birth cohort study (which became known later as National Survey of Health &amp; Development) was set up by [[J. W. B. Douglas]] less than a year after the end of the second world war. The original promoters of this survey had been the [[Population Investigation Committee]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pearson|2016|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; with help from the [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists|Royal College of Obstetricians]] and some funding from the [[Nuffield Foundation]] and the National Birthday Trust Fund.&lt;ref name = IJE/&gt;  The survey began with interviews of 13 687 mothers who had given birth in the England, Wales and Scotland during the week of 3–9 March 1946 (91% of births that week).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Watts|first = Geoff|date = 2011-02-15|title = In for the long haul|url = http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.d942|journal = BMJ|language = en|volume = 342|pages = d942|doi = 10.1136/bmj.d942|issn = 0959-8138|pmid = 21324993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally this survey was intended as a one-off project and was designed to answer questions such as;why had the national fertility rate in Britain been consistently dropping?; were the costs of giving birth a deterrent to having children?; and how well were the existing midwifery and obstetric medical services in Britain working?&lt;ref name = IJE&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wadsworth|first=Michael|last2=Kuh|first2=Diana|last3=Richards|first3=Marcus|last4=Hardy|first4=Rebecca|date=2006-02-01|title=Cohort Profile: The 1946 National Birth Cohort (MRC National Survey of Health and Development)|url=http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/1/49|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology|language=en|volume=35|issue=1|pages=49–54|doi=10.1093/ije/dyi201|issn=0300-5771|pmid=16204333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unknown to the project initiators, this project coincided with the start of the [[post-World War II baby boom]] so the question of low fertility rates was not explored. The initial results showed enormous differences in birth outcomes between different classes in Britain - for example, the babies from mothers in the lowest social class were 70% more likely to be born dead than in the highest social class.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pearson|2016|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results from this survey influenced the decisions made when setting up the [[British National Health Service]] in 1948. The survey continued with a sample (which excluded illegitimate children and twins) of 5 362 of the children using regular follow-ups&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pearson|2016|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; to explore the impact of a National Health Service on health and to explore differences in child development by factors like social class, health and education. As of 2016 it has continued and has itself developed into a study of ageing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuh|first=Diana|last2=Pierce|first2=Mary|last3=Adams|first3=Judith|last4=Deanfield|first4=John|last5=Ekelund|first5=Ulf|last6=Friberg|first6=Peter|last7=Ghosh|first7=Arjun K.|last8=Harwood|first8=Nikki|last9=Hughes|first9=Alun|date=2011-02-01|title=Cohort Profile: Updating the cohort profile for the MRC National Survey of Health and Development: a new clinic-based data collection for ageing research|url=http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/40/1/e1|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology|language=en|volume=40|issue=1|pages=e1–e9|doi=10.1093/ije/dyq231|issn=0300-5771|pmc=3043283|pmid=21345808}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/happy-children-make-happy-adults|title=Happy children make happy adults|last=|first=|date=2011-03-14|website=Research|publisher=University of Cambridge|access-date=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regularly updated information about this cohort also enables comparison with data from [[British birth cohort studies|other longitudinal studies in Britain]] and elsewhere.

The mission of the Unit is to realise the scientific potential of the NSHD as a world class, interdisciplinary life course study by:
* Scientific discovery of life course influences on normal and healthy ageing
* Transfer of knowledge to policymakers, health practitioners, and other research users
* Promotion of healthy ageing

The NSHD was formerly based at the [[London School of Economics]] (under the direction of Dr. [[James W. B. Douglas|James Douglas]] and at the University of Bristol), and then the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at [[University College London]] (under the direction of [[Professor Michael Wadsworth]]). In 2016, the survey was operating under the  MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing (which was established in 2008) and based in [[Bloomsbury]], [[London]], [[England]], directed by Professor Diana Kuh.

'''Outdoor fitness''' consists of [[exercise]] undertaken outside a building for the purpose of improving [[physical fitness]]. It contrasts with exercise undertaken inside a [[gym]] or [[health club]] for the same purpose. The activity may be undertaken in a [[park]], in the [[wilderness]], or other outdoor location. The popularity of outdoor fitness grew rapidly in the second-half of the twentieth century and grew as a commercial consumer market in the twenty-first century

==History==
In nineteenth-century Germany, ''Turnplatz'', an outdoor space for gymnastics, were promoted by German educator [[Friedrich Jahn]] and the [[Turners]], a political and gymnastic movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-turnplatz-open-air-gymnasium-in-the-hasenheide-1811-48390278.html|title=Stock Photo - Turnplatz (open-air gymnasium) in the Hasenheide, 1811|last=Limited|first=Alamy|date=|website=Alamy|language=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Second World War, as people did less exercise in their daily and work lives, individualistic, health-oriented physical and recreational activities such as [[jogging]] began to prevail.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://www.palgrave.com/gb/book/9780230507494 Fit Bodies.

[[File:Collage of various helminth eggs.png|thumb|[[Egg]]s of different species of parasitic worm.]]

'''Parasitic worms''', also known as '''helminths''',&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite web |title=CDC - Parasites - About Parasites |url=https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/about.html |website=www.cdc.gov |language=en-us |date=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; are large [[Parasitism#Basic concepts|macroparasites]], which as adults can generally be seen with the naked eye. Many are '''intestinal worms''' that are [[soil-transmitted helminth|soil-transmitted]] and [[intestinal parasite infection|infect]] the [[gastrointestinal tract]]. Other parasitic worms such as  [[schistosomes]] reside in blood vessels. 

There is no [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy ]] of parasitic worms since it is an umbrella term that includes many species of [[worm]] from different [[genus|genera]], having [[parasitism]] as a commonality. These include two classes of the [[flatworm]] (Platyhelminthes) phylum, namely [[cestodes]] (tapeworms) and [[trematodes]] (flukes and [[schistosoma|blood flukes]]), many species of [[nematode]]s (roundworms),&lt;ref name="Castro"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Castro |first1=GA |last2=Baron |first2=S |title=Helminths: Structure, Classification, Growth, and Development |date=1996 |pmid=21413320}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[acanthocephala|acanthocephalins]] known as thorny-headed worms.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; Some other parasitic worm species from the [[annelid]]s (ringed worms), including the [[leeches]] are [[ectoparasites]] and so are not classified as helminths which are [[Parasitism#Basic concepts|endoparasites]].

Parasitic worms live in and feed in living [[host (biology)|hosts]]. They receive [[nourishment]] and protection while disrupting their hosts' [[nutrient]] absorption. This can cause weakness and [[disease]] of the host. In their adult form, parasitic worms cannot multiply in humans.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/about.html|title=CDC Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about parasites |date=|website=|publisher=CDC |accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helminths are able to survive in their mammalian hosts for many years due to their ability to manipulate the [[immune response]] by secreting immunomodulatory products.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Jirillo, E., Magrone, T.,  Miragliotta, G. (2014). [http://www.eurekaselect.com/125669/volume/2 Immunomodulation by Parasitic Helminths and its Therapeutic Exploitation]. In: Pineda, M.A., Harnett, W. (Eds), Immune Response to Parasitic Infections  (Vol 2, pp 175-212), Bentham eBooks, {{doi|10.2174/97816080598501140201}}, {{ISBN|978-1-60805-985-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; All parasitic worms produce [[egg]]s for reproduction. These eggs have a strong shell that protects them against a range of environmental conditions. The eggs can therefore survive outside their hosts, in the environment for many months or years.

Many, of the worms referred to as helminths belong to the group of intestinal parasites. An infection by a helminth is known as [[helminthiasis]], helminth infection or intestinal worm infection. There is a naming convention which applies to all helminths: the ending "-asis" (or in veterinary science: "-osis") is added at the end of the name of the worm to denote the infection with that particular worm.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} For example, ''[[Ascaris]]'' is the name of a type of helminth, and [[ascariasis]] is the name of the infection caused by that helminth.

== Taxonomy ==

[[File:Ascaris lumbricoides life cycle.tif|thumb|Image showing life cycle inside and outside of the human body of one fairly typical and well described helminth: [[Ascaris]] lumbricoides]]

There is no real consensus on the taxonomy (or groupings) of the helminths, particularly with the [[nematodes]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.path.cam.ac.uk/~schisto/helminth_taxonomy/index.html |title=Schistosomiasis Research Group, University of Cambridge, UK |date= |accessdate=19 December 2014 |website= |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013012251/http://www.path.cam.ac.uk/~schisto/helminth_taxonomy/index.html |archivedate=13 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "helminth" contains a number of [[Phylum|phyla]], many of which are completely unrelated. However, for practical considerations the term is still used nowadays to describe four groups with superficial similarities, the phyla [[Annelida]], [[Platyhelminths]], [[Nematoda]] and [[Acanthocephala]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There is in fact no helminth classification; it is an "artificial" term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/help/navphylogeny.html|title = Navigating the Phylogeny Wing, University of Berkeley, USA|date = |accessdate = 19 December 2014|website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.tolweb.org/tree/phylogeny.html|title = Tree of Life web project|date = |accessdate = 19 December 2014|website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important helminths in the [[sanitation]] field are the human parasites, which is why most people relate the term helminth to them, where they are classified as nemathelminthes (nematodes) and platyhelminthes, depending on whether they possess a round or flat-shaped body respectively. The latter are further divided into cestodes and trematodes depending on whether or not they have a segmented body.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Maya C., Torner-Morales F.J., Lucario E.S., Hernández E., Jiménez B. | year = 2012 | title = Viability of six species of larval and non-larval helminth eggs for different conditions of temperature, pH and dryness | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135412004101 | journal = Water Research | volume = 46 | issue = 15| pages = 4770–4782 | doi = 10.1016/j.watres.2012.06.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ringworm]] (dermatophytosis) is actually caused by various [[fungus|fungi]] and not by a parasitic worm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mayo Clinic Staff |title=Ringworm (body) - Symptoms and causes |url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ringworm-body/symptoms-causes/syc-20353780 |website=Mayo Clinic |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ringworm |url=https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/contagious-skin-diseases/ringworm |website=American Academy of Dermatology |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common characteristics==
Helminths are a group of organisms which share a similar form but are not necessarily related as part of [[evolution]]. Helminths include members of the following [[taxa]]: [[monogeneans]], [[cestodes]] (tapeworms), [[nematodes]] (roundworms), [[trematodes]] (flukes), and [[acanthocephala|acanthocephalins]] (thorny-headed worms).

The number of different helminth species is vast: it is estimated to be around one million species.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The nematodes are the most diverse of all the helminths with the highest number of species.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} There may be as many as 300,000 species of parasites affecting vertebrates,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=|title=Homage to Linnaeus:How many parasites? How many hosts?|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/105/Supplement_1/11482.full.pdf|journal=PNAS|volume=|pages=|via=|doi=10.1073/pnas.0803232105|pmc=2556407}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as many as 300 affecting humans alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=|title=History of Human Parasitology|url=http://cmr.asm.org/content/15/4/595.full|journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Characteristics that are common for all helminths include:

Lifetime:
* The [[life expectancy|lifetime]] of adult worms varies tremendously from one species to another but is generally in the range of 1 to 8 years (see following table). This lifetime of several years is a result of their ability to manipulate the immune response of their hosts by secreting immunomodulatory products.&lt;ref name = ":4"/&gt;
* Helminths can be either [[hermaphrodites]] (i.e. can have both [[sexes]]), like tapeworms and the flukes (except the blood fluke which is not a hermaphrodite), or have their [[sexual differentiation|sexes differentiated]], like the roundworms. 
Eggs:
* All helminths produce eggs (also called ova) for reproduction. 
* Helminth eggs have a strong shell that protects them against a range of environmental conditions. This shell consists of three layers: a lipoidal inner layer, a chitinous middle layer and outer proteinic layer.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jimenez B | year = 2007 | title = Helminth ova removal from wastewater for agriculture and aquaculture reuse | url = http://www.iwaponline.com/wst/05501/wst055010485.htm | journal = Water Science &amp; Technology | volume = 55 | issue = 1–2| pages = 485–493 | doi = 10.2166/wst.2007.046 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Generally thousands or even hundreds of thousands of eggs are produced each time the female worm deposits its eggs - a process called ovoposition. The following table shows a large variation in the number of eggs produced by the different worms in one event; it varies in the range of 3,000 to 700,000. 
* The frequency of egg deposition from an adult helminth is generally daily, or up to six times per day for some ''Taenia'' species.  
* Adult trematodes lay smaller numbers of eggs compared to cestodes or nematodes. However, the egg develops into a [[miracidia]] from which thousands of ''[[cercariae]]'', swimming larvae, develop. This means that one egg may produce thousands of adult worms.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/fasciola/biology.html|title = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Parasites - Fascioliasis (Fasciola Infection)|date = |accessdate =13 January 2015 |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Helminth eggs remain viable for 1–2 months in crops and for many months in soil, fresh water and [[sewage]], or even for several years in [[Human feces|feces]], [[fecal sludge]] (historically called [[night soil]]) and [[sewage sludge]]; a period that is much longer compared to other kinds of microorganisms.&lt;ref name="World Health Organization"&gt;{{cite book|last1=WHO|title=Guidelines for the Safe Use of Wastewater, Excreta and Greywater, Volume 4 Excreta and Greywater Use in Agriculture.|date=2006|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=9241546859|edition=third|url=http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Feachem, R., Bradley, D., Garelick, H., Mara, D.

Larvae:
* Larvae hatch from these eggs, either inside or outside the host, depending on the type of helminth. Life cycles of the helminths differ in this and other specific aspects. Eggs that are no longer viable do not produce any larvae. 
* The larvae maturing in the host take from about two weeks up to four months depending on the helminth species.

Draft genomes for all categories of helminth have been sequenced in recent years and are available through the ParaSite sub-portal of [[WormBase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parasite.wormbase.org|title=WormBase ParaSite|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in medicine==
{{Main article|Helminthic therapy}}

Parasitic worms have been used as a medical treatment for various diseases, particularly those involving an overactive [[Immune system|immune response]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web
  |title=Eat worms - feel better
  |publisher=[[BBC News]]
  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3287733.stm
  |date=3 December 2003
  |accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[human]]s have evolved with parasitic worms, proponents argue they are needed for a healthy immune system.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; Scientists are looking for a connection between the prevention and control of parasitic worms and the increase in [[Allergy|allergies]] such as hay-fever in developed countries.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; Parasitic worms may be able to damp down the immune system of their host, making it easier for them to live in the intestine without coming under attack.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; This may be one mechanism for their proposed medicinal effect.

One study suggests a link between the rising rates of [[metabolic syndrome]] in the developed worlds and the largely successful efforts of Westerners to eliminate intestinal parasites.  The work suggests eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) in fat tissue play an important role in preventing insulin resistance by secreting interleukin 4, which in turn switches macrophages into "alternative activation".  Alternatively-activated macrophages are important to maintaining glucose homeostasis (i.e., blood sugar regulation).  Helminth infection causes an increase in eosinophils.  In the study, the authors fed rodents a high-fat diet to induce metabolic syndrome, and then injected them with helminths.  Helminth infestation improved the rodents' metabolism.&lt;ref name="science"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wu |first=Davina |title=Eosinophils Sustain Adipose Alternatively Activated Macrophages Associated with Glucose Homeostasis |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=8 April 2011 |volume=332 |pages=243–247 |url=http://sabre.ucsf.edu/docs/Science-2011-Wu-243-7.pdf |accessdate=18 April 2011 |issue=6026 |doi=10.1126/science.1201475 |pmid=21436399 |pmc=3144160|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although sparse in blood of persons in developed countries, eosinophils are often elevated in individuals in rural developing countries where intestinal parasitism is prevalent and metabolic syndrome rare.  We speculate that eosinophils may have evolved to optimize metabolic homeostasis during chronic infections by ubiquitous intestinal parasites….&lt;ref name="science" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Eggs ==

=== In the environment ===
[[Egg]]s can reach the soil when polluted [[wastewater]], [[sewage sludge]] or [[human waste]] are used as [[fertilizer]]. Such soil is often characterized by moist and warm conditions. Therefore, the risk of using contaminated wastewater and sludge in agricultural fields is a real problem, especially in poor countries, where this practice is prevalent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keraita B., Jiménez B., Drechsel P. (2008). [http://www.cabi.org/cabreviews/search/?q=+Extent+and+Implications+of+Agricultural+Reuse+of+Untreated%2c+partly+Treated+and+Diluted+Wastewater+in+Developing+Countries Extent and Implications of Agricultural Reuse of Untreated, partly Treated and Diluted Wastewater in Developing Countries]. CAB Reviews: Perspectives in Agriculture, Veterinary Science, Nutrition and Natural Resources, Vol 3, No 58, pp 15-27&lt;/ref&gt; Helminth eggs are regarded as the main biological health risk when applying sewage sludge, fecal sludge or fecal matter on agricultural soils.&lt;ref name="World Health Organization" /&gt; The eggs are the infective stage of the helminths’ life cycle for causing the disease [[helminthiasis]].

Helminth eggs are resistant to various environmental conditions due to the composition of the egg shell. Each helminth egg species has 3 to 4 layers with different physical and chemical characteristics: a) the 1 to 2 outer layers are formed of [[mucopolysaccharide]]s and [[protein]]s, b) the middle layers consist of [[chitin]]ous material and serve to give structure and mechanical resistance to the eggs, and c) the inner layer is composed of [[lipid]]s and proteins and is useful to protect eggs from desiccation, strong acid and bases, oxidants and reductive agents as well as detergent and proteolytic compounds.&lt;ref name = ":3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fairweather I., Threadgold L.T. | year = 1981 | title = Hymenolepis nana: the fine structure of the embryonic envelopes | url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=4200324&amp;fileId=S0031182000066968 | journal = Parasitology | volume = 82 | issue = | pages = 429–443 | doi=10.1017/s0031182000066968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lýsek H., Malínský J., Janisch R. | year = 1985 | title =  | url = | journal = Folia Parasitologica | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 381–384 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Quilès F., Balandier J.Y., Capizzi-Banas S. | year = 2006 | title = In situ characterisation of a microorganism surface by Raman microspectroscopy: the shell of Ascaris eggs | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-006-0638-4 | journal = Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry | volume = 386 | issue = | pages = 249–255 | doi=10.1007/s00216-006-0638-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to this strong shell, helminth eggs or ova remain viable in soil, fresh water and sewage for many months. In feces, fecal sludge and sewage sludge they can even remain viable for several years.&lt;ref name="World Health Organization"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Helminth eggs of concern in [[wastewater]] used for [[irrigation]] have a size between 20 and 90&amp;nbsp;μm and a relative density of 1.06–1.23.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  It is very difficult to inactivate helminth eggs, unless temperature is increased above 40&amp;nbsp;°C or moisture is reduced to less than 5%.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Levels of infectiousness ===
Helminth eggs contained in wastewater, sewage sludge or human excreta are not always [[Infection|infectious]], i.e. able to cause the disease helminthiasis. Fertilized eggs and unfertilized eggs can exist side by side. Unfertilized eggs are identifiable under the microscope by their elongated shape. No larvae can hatch from these kinds of eggs. Therefore, unfertilized eggs do not pose a danger to human health.

In the case of ''[[Ascaris lumbricoides]]'' (giant roundworm), which has been considered the most resistant and common helminth type, fertilized eggs deposited in soil are resistant to desiccation but are, at this stage of development, very sensitive to environmental temperatures: The reproduction of a fertilized egg within the eggshell develops at an environmental soil temperature about 25&amp;nbsp;°C which is lower than the body temperature of the host (i.e., 37&amp;nbsp;°C for humans).&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Human Parasitology|last = Bogitsh|first = Burton J.|publisher = Academic Press|year = 2012|isbn = 978-0-12-415915-0|location = UK|pages = 269–345|last2 = Carter|first2 = Clint E.|last3 = Oeltmann|first3 = Thomas N.|chapter = General Characteristics of the Nematoda (Chapter 15), Intestinal Nematodes (Chapter 16)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, development of the larvae in the egg stops at temperatures below 15.5&amp;nbsp;°C, and eggs cannot survive temperatures much above 38&amp;nbsp;°C. If the temperature is around 25&amp;nbsp;°C, the infectiousness occurs after nearly 10 days of incubation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Alouini Z., Jemli M. | year = 2001 | title = Destruction of helminth eggs by photosensitized porphyrin | url = http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2001/em/b103471p | journal = Journal of Environmental Monitoring | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 548–551 | doi=10.1039/b103471p| citeseerx = 10.1.1.691.4034 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Capizzi-Banas S., Deloge M., Remy M., Schwartzbrod J. | year = 2004 | title = Liming as an advanced treatment for sludge sanitisation: helminth eggs elimination - Ascaris eggs as model | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135404002180 | journal = Water Research | volume = 38 | issue = 14–15| pages = 3251–3258 | doi=10.1016/j.watres.2004.04.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, after 2 to 4 weeks in moist soil at optimal temperature and oxygen levels, the embryo develops into an infective larva, named "second-stage larva". This larva has the ability to get out of the egg, hatch in the small intestine and migrate to different organs. These infective larvae (or "infective eggs") may remain viable in soil for two years or longer.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Removal versus inactivation in wastewater and sludge treatment ===
In order to physically remove (but not inactivate) helminth eggs from wastewater, processes that remove particles, such as sedimentation, filtration or [[Flocculation|coagulation-flocculation]] are employed.&lt;ref&gt;Jimenez B., Chavez-Mejia A. (1997). [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09593331808616590 Treatment of Mexico City Wastewater for Irrigation Purposes]. Environmental Technology, Vol 18, pp 721-730&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jiménez B., Maya C., Salgado G. (2001). [http://www.iwaponline.com/wst/04312/wst043120179.htm The Elimination of Helminth Ova, Fecal Coliforms, Salmonella and Protozoan Cysts by Various Physicochemical Processes in Wastewater and Sludge]. Water Science and Technology, Vol 43, No 12, pp 179-182&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, [[stabilization pond|waste stabilization ponds]] (lagoons), storage bassins, [[constructed wetlands]], rapid filtration or [[upflow anaerobic sludge blanket]] (UASB) reactors can be used. These conventional wastewater treatment processes do not inactivate the helminth ova but only removes them from the wastewater and moves them to the sewage sludge.

Helminth ova cannot be inactivated with chlorine, UV light or ozone (in the latter case at least not with economical doses because &gt;36&amp;nbsp;mg/L ozone are needed with 1 hour contact time).

Inactivation of helminth ova can be achieved in [[sewage sludge treatment]] where the temperature is increased over 40&amp;nbsp;°C or moisture is reduced to less than 5%.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Best results can be obtained when both of these conditions are combined for an extended period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, G.D., Roberts, L.S. (1981). Foundations of Parasitology, second ed. C.V. Mosby Company, 795 pp&lt;/ref&gt; Details about the contact time under these conditions and other related environmental factors are generally not well-defined for every type of helminth egg species.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Helminth eggs are considered highly resistant biological structures.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Indicator organism ===

Helminth eggs (or ova) are a good [[indicator organism]] to assess the safety of sanitation and reuse systems because they are the most environmentally resistant pathogens of all [[pathogens]] ([[viruses]], [[bacteria]], [[protozoa]] and helminths) and can in extreme cases survive for several years in soil.&lt;ref name="World Health Organization" /&gt; Therefore, the presence or absence of viable helminth eggs ("viable helminth egg" means that a larva would be able to hatch from the egg) in a sample of dried fecal matter, [[compost]] or [[faecal sludge|fecal sludge]] is often used as an indicator to assess the efficiency of diverse wastewater and sludge treatment processes in terms of pathogen removal. In particular, the number of viable [[Ascaris]] eggs is often taken as an indicator organism for all helminth eggs in treatment processes as they are very common in many parts of the world and relatively easy to identify under the microscope. However, the exact inactivation characteristics may vary for different types of helminth eggs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Measurement techniques ===

==== Environmental samples ====
For the purpose of setting treatment standards and reuse legislation, it is important to be able to determine the amount of helminth eggs in an environmental sample with some accuracy. The detection of viable helminth eggs in samples of wastewater, sludge or fresh feces (as a diagnostic tool for the infection [[helminthiasis]]) is not straight forward. In fact, many laboratories in developing countries lack the right equipment or skilled staff required to do so. An important step in the analytical methods is usually the concentration of the eggs in the sample, especially in the case of wastewater samples. A concentration step may not be required in samples of dried feces, e.g. samples collected from [[urine-diverting dry toilet]]s.

==== Human stool samples ====
For medical purposes, the exact number of helminth eggs is less important and therefore most [[diagnosis|diagnoses]] are made simply by identifying the appearance of the [[worm]] or eggs in [[feces]]. Due to the large quantity of eggs laid, [[physicians]] can [[diagnose]] using only one or two [[fecal smear]]s.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The [[Kato technique]] (also called the Kato-Katz technique) is a laboratory method for preparing human stool samples prior to searching for parasite eggs. [[Eggs per gram]] is a laboratory test that determines the number of eggs per gram of feces in patients suspected of having a parasitological infection, such as schistosomiasis.

==Diagnosis==
PANS is an exclusively clinical diagnosis based on the exclusion of other disorders (''exclusion diagnostics'') and is characterized by symptoms typical of [[basal ganglia]] dysfunction and the results of altered functions of the inert part of the immune system.{{medcn|date=May 2018}} [[Pediatric acuteonset neuropsychiatric syndrome|PANDAS]] (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections) is basically PANS caused by [[streptococcal]] infection and has symptoms similar (but not equal) to PANS. However, the pathological mechanisms of PANDAS are still under research.&lt;ref name=Thienemann2017&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thienemann M, Murphy T, Leckman J, et al |title=Clinical Management of Pediatric Acute-Onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome: Part I-Psychiatric and Behavioral Interventions |journal=J Child Adolesc Psychopharmacol |volume=27 |issue=7 |pages=566–573 |date=September 2017 |pmid=28722481 |pmc=5610394 |doi=10.1089/cap.2016.0145 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Possible laboratory markers for PANDAS have been discussed and tested, with no promising results. PANS and PANDAS are, despite their similarity, not interchangeable concepts and terms.{{medcn|date=May 2018}}

==PANS/PANDAS Research Consortium==
A consortium of academic clinicians and scientists was convened in 2013 to develop more defined diagnostic guidelines for this disorder in anticipation of furthering research, clinical trials, and clinical care for this patient subgroup.&lt;ref name=Chang2015/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3998">The '''Pension Belhomme''' was a prison and private clinic during the [[French Revolution]].

Around 1765, the [[joiner]] [[Jacques Belhomme]] took on the construction of a building for the son of a neighbour, an aristocrat who had been mad since birth. Seeing that running an asylum was more lucrative than joinery, he opened an asylum for lunatics, old people and whoever else rich families wanted to entrust to him. A famous precursor of psychiatry, [[Philippe Pinel]], carried out his first treatments of the insane here.

Once the [[French Revolution]] had begun, Jacques Belhomme thought that his fortune was assured. Remote from the violent centre of Paris, he had noticeable advantages.  In September 1793 the députés encouraged the [[sans-culotte]]s to imprison all suspect individuals: nobles, their wives and children, foreigners, priests, lawyers, the actors of the [[Comédie Française]], rich people in general, in short, all those who had not made clear their allegiance to the Republic. With the prisons of Paris already overflowing, the state requisitioned Belhomme's asylum and then all other private clinics. Belhomme entreated the 12 police chiefs in charge of Paris to send him rich prisoners who would pay high fees to live in his asylum as comfortably as possible.  From then on marquises, bankers, journalists, famous actors, old nobles and army officers, along with other disgraced persons who bribed the doctors and police chiefs to be transferred on the pretext of illness, lived cheek by jowl with the mad.

Belhomme rented the neighbouring building, the hôtel de Chabanais, to which he linked his own building by a charming garden after the young marquis de Chabanais, a descendant of [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]], had emigrated with his mother and had his possessions confiscated by the state. Belhomme ended up buying the house to invest the money he had made.  It was in this setting that there occurred the romance between [[Jacques-Marie Rouzet]], a deputy to the [[National Convention]], and [[Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon]], widow of the [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Duc d’Orléans]] and mother of the future King [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]]. They married in secret after leaving prison.

The scandal of the Pension Belhomme finally erupted in January 1794. Belhomme was arrested for supplying wine to the inmates and was imprisoned in another ''pension'', at [[Coignard]], where the [[Marquis de Sade]] was also held.  He was found guilty twice and, like the majority of the former inmates of his "clinic", escaped the guillotine only because the [[Reign of Terror|Terror]] ended on [[9 Thermidor]].  Some of the former inmates did not escape, however, proving too well-known to pass unnoticed. They included [[Béatrice de Choiseul-Stainville]], duchesse de Gramont, sister of [[Louis XV]]'s famous minister; the duchess of Le Châtelet, daughter-in-law of a famous mistress of [[Voltaire]],&lt;ref&gt;Both to be seen in the film by [[Éric Rohmer|Rohmer]], ''[[l'Anglaise et le Duc]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[fermier général]] [[Jean-Baptiste Magon de La Balue|Magon de La Balue]], guillotined with his children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, brothers and cousins; and the lawyer [[Simon-Nicholas Henri Linguet]], despite his denunciation of the monarchy, for which he had spent a year in the [[Bastille]] under the ancien regime.

The hôtel de Chabanais was razed in 1953, as was the maison Belhomme in 1973.

However, plans to market the CMX-1152 version of Protandim fell through and in April 2004 Lifeline Therapeutics announced that it would instead be marketing a different (non-peptide) [[dietary supplement]] under the name “Protandim CF” (to distinguish it from the peptide version initially developed by Cermedix). The new version of Protandim, a combination of 5 common [[herbal]] ingredients including [[turmeric]] and [[green tea]] was invented following “months of extensive research and development” by Lifeline employees Paul Myhill and William Driscoll (a former oil company executive), who together hold the patent on the product,&lt;ref name=Patent1&gt;{{Cite patent | inventor1-last=Myhill | inventor1-first=Paul R. | inventor2-last=Driscoll | inventor2-first=William J. | issue-date=10 July 2007 | patent-number=7241461 | title=Composition for alleviating inflammation and oxidative stress in a mammal. | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; | country-code=US }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was  launched in February 2005.

Like CMX-1152, the herbal mixture known as Protandim that supplanted it was marketed by Lifeline as an "anti-aging" supplement that increases the body’s antioxidant defenses by upregulating superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. According to the company, the product was initially sold through retail channels such as [[GNC (store)|GNC]];&lt;ref name=GNC&gt;{{cite news|title=Protandim to be Available at General Nutrition Center (GNC) Stores|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/849146/000102189005000106/lifeline720058kex99.htm|accessdate=2012-08-19|newspaper=Lifeline Therapeutics press release|date=July 20, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, in 2009, after several consecutive years of multimillion-dollar losses, the company,  which by then was doing business under the name LifeVantage, stopped marketing it through retailers and switched to multi-level marketing, selling it instead through a network of commissioned independent distributors. According to LifeVantage, the move from retail to multi-level marketing was prompted by the January 2008 hiring of David W. Brown, (formerly CEO and president of [[Metabolife]]) as the company's CEO and president.&lt;ref name=ReutersBrown&gt;{{cite news|title=LifeVantage Corporation Appoints Industry Veteran David Brown as President &amp; CEO (LFVN press release)|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/01/14/idUS120817+14-Jan-2008+PRN20080114|accessdate=2012-08-24|newspaper=[[Reuters]]|date=January 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LFVNstory&gt;{{cite web|title=The LifeVantage Story|url=http://www.lifevantage.com/company/our-story/|publisher=LifeVantage, Inc|accessdate=2012-08-24|quote=David Brown, President of LifeVantage Network, recognized Protandim's potential.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112065451/http://www.lifevantage.com/company/our-story/|archivedate=2011-11-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Product invention ===
As recently as July 21, 2011, LifeVantage credited McCord as the creator of Protandim on its website.&lt;ref name=InventControversy2&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lifevantage.com/products-breakthrough.aspx |title= Scientific Breakthrough.

== Composition ==
Protandim consists mainly of a blend of 5 herbal ingredients (amounts per caplet listed in parentheses):&lt;ref name=study2&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Velmurugan |first1=Kalpana |last2=Alam |first2=Jawed |last3=McCord |first3=Joe M. |last4=Pugazhenthi |first4=Subbiah |title=Synergistic induction of heme oxygenase-1 by the components of the antioxidant supplement Protandim |journal=Free Radical Biology and Medicine |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=430–40 |year=2009 |pmid=19056485 |doi=10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2008.10.050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Turmeric]] (''Curcuma longa'') extract (75&amp;nbsp;mg)

== Effectiveness ==
Marketing claims that Protadim can prevent or treat [[cancer]] are unproven and have been deemed [[fraudulent]] by the FDA.&lt;ref name=fda2017&gt;{{cite web |publisher=FDA |title=Illegal Cancer Treatments: FDA Warning - Fraudulent Claims of Diagnosis, Treatment, Prevention or Cure |date=25 April 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424192807/https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm554777.htm |archivedate=24 April 2018 |url=https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm554777.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research into use as a treatment for [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] is of poor quality, casting doubt on its usefulness for drawing any conclusions about efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=ALSUntangled Group| title=ALSUntangled No. 31: Protandim. | journal=Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener | year= 2015 | volume= 17 | issue= 1-2 | pages= 154-6 | pmid=26414415 | doi=10.3109/21678421.2015.1088707 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=26414415 |type=Review}} &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Harriet A. Hall]] wrote for ''[[Science-Based Medicine (website)|Science-Based Medicine]]'' that, "We simply don’t know enough at this point to recommend Protandim for treatment or prevention of any disease, for anti-aging, for making people feel healthier or more energetic, or for anything else."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Harriet|title=Pursued by Protandim Proselytizers|url=http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/pursued-by-protandim-proselytizers/|publisher=[[Science-Based Medicine (website)|Science-Based Medicine]]|accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Side effects ==
According to the manufacturer, Protandim can cause allergic responses, gastrointestinal disturbances (stomach ache, diarrhea, vomiting), headache, and rash of the hands and feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.protandim.com/faqs |title=FAQ |publisher=protandim.com}}{{third-party-inline|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SBM_120517"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hall |first1=Harriet |title=I Was Wrong about Protandim |url=https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/i-was-wrong-about-protandim/ |website=[[Science Based Medicine]] |accessdate=June 26, 2018 |date=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Microcephaly
* Normal intelligence
* Conjunctival [[telangiectasia]]
* Recurrent sinus infections
* Decreased serum IgA
* Late onset of [[pulmonary fibrosis]]
* Increased alpha-fetoprotein
* Increased radiosensitivity

==Genetics==

This condition is due to mutations in the [[RNF168]] gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion.

The gene encodes a [[ubiquitin]] [[ligase]] and is located on the long arm of [[chromosome 3]] (3q29) on the Crick (minus strand).

[[File:Ragdoll Kitten.jpg|alt=Ragdoll Kitten|thumb|Ragdoll Kitten]]
The '''Ragdoll''' is a cat breed with blue eyes and varying colours and patterns. It is a large and muscular semi-longhair cat with a soft and silky coat. Developed by [[United States|American]] breeder Ann Baker in the 1960s, it is best known for its docile and placid temperament and affectionate nature. The name "Ragdoll"   is derived from the tendency of individuals from the original breeding stock to go limp and relaxed when picked up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HYt3zSa9N1EC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=ragdoll+cat+flop&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5WQNUaX_GfLU0gG16YDoDA&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=ragdoll%20cat%20flop&amp;f=false |title=Why Do Cats Always Land on Their Feet?: 101 of the Most Perplexing Questions ... – Marty Becker, Gina Spadafori – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2006-09-16 |accessdate=2014-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly popular in both the United Kingdom and the breed's native United States, ragdoll cats often are known as "[[Puppy cat|dog-like cats]]" or "puppy-like cats" due to behaviors such as their tendency to follow people around, their ease at being physically handled, and their relative lack of aggression toward other pets.&lt;ref name=ideal&gt;{{cite book|title=Your Ideal Cat: Insights Into Breed and Gender Differences in Cat Behavior|author1=Benjamin L.

==History==
In the 1960s, a regular, non-pedigreed, light-grey, domestic longhaired cat named Josephine produced several litters of typical cats. Josephine was of a [[Persian cat|Persian]]/[[Turkish Angora|Angora]] type and had litters sired by several unknown male [[Birman]] or [[Burmese cat|Burmese]]-like cats, one of which had the [[Siamese cat|Siamese]] point coloration. Josephine later produced kittens with a docile, placid temperament, affectionate nature, and a tendency to go limp and relaxed when picked up. When a subsequent litter produced more of the same, Ann Baker purchased several kittens from the owner who lived behind her and, believing that she had something special, set out to create what is now known as the ragdoll. The breed was selectively bred over many years for desirable traits, such as large size, gentle demeanor, pointed coloration, and a tendency to go limp when picked up.&lt;ref name="Helgren2006"/&gt;

Out of those early litters came Blackie, an all black Burmese-like male, and Daddy Warbucks, a seal point with white feet. Daddy Warbucks sired the founding bi-color female Fugianna, and Blackie sired Buckwheat, a dark brown/black Burmese-like female. Both Fugianna and Buckwheat were daughters of Josephine. All Ragdolls are descended from Baker's cats through matings of Daddy Warbucks to Fugianna and Buckwheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ragdollhistoricalsociety.com/ragdoll-history.php |title=Ragdoll History-The Beginning |publisher=Ragdoll Historical Society |accessdate=2014-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218211300/http://ragdollhistoricalsociety.com/ragdoll-history.php |archive-date=2015-02-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baker, in an unusual move, spurned traditional cat-breeding associations. She trademarked the name ''Ragdoll'', set up her own registry (the International Ragdoll Cat Association (IRCA)) ca. 1971, and enforced stringent standards on anyone who wanted to breed or sell cats under that name.&lt;ref name="Helgren2006"&gt;{{cite web |last=Helgren |first=J. Anne |date=2006 |title=Ragdoll |publisher=Telemark Productions |url=http://www.iams.com/pet-health/cat-breeds/ragdoll |website=[[Iams]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ragdolls were also not allowed to be registered in other breed associations.&lt;ref name="Iams"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://us.iams.com/iams/en_US/jsp/IAMS_Page.jsp?pageID=CBD&amp;breedPage=ragdoll.html |title=Ragdoll |website=[[Iams]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928110337/http://us.iams.com/iams/en_US/jsp/IAMS_Page.jsp?pageID=CBD&amp;breedPage=ragdoll.html |archive-date=2007-09-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Domestic Cats"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robbins|first1=Nancy|title=Domestic Cats: Their History, Breeds and Other Facts|date=2012-02-14|publisher=CreateSpace|isbn=9781470075385|page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IRCA is still in existence today but is quite small, particularly since Baker's death in 1997. IRCA cats are not recognized in any major cat breed organization or cat show.

In 1975, a group led by a husband-and-wife team, Denny and Laura Dayton, broke ranks with the IRCA with the aim of gaining mainstream recognition for the Ragdoll. Beginning with a breeding pair of IRCA cats, this group eventually developed the Ragdoll standard currently accepted by major cat registries such as the [[Cat Fanciers' Association|CFA]] and the [[FIFe]].&lt;ref name=raistrickragdolls&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raistrickragdolls.co.uk/ragdoll-cats.php|title=Raistrick Ragdolls|website=Raistrickragdfolls.co.uk|accessdate=15 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129045115/http://www.raistrickragdolls.co.uk/ragdoll-cats.php|archivedate=29 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the spread of the Ragdoll breed in America during the early 1960s, a breeding pair of Ragdolls was exported to the UK. This pair was followed by eight more cats to fully establish the breed in the UK, where it is recognised by the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gccfcats.org/breeds.html|title=Welcome to the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy|accessdate=2010-12-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121208085015/http://www.gccfcats.org/breeds.html|archivedate=2012-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, a second group decided to leave the IRCA and form its own group owing to increasingly strict breeding restrictions. This group later established the [[Ragamuffin (cat)|Ragamuffin]] breed. Because Baker owned the rights to the name "Ragdoll", no offshoot groups were legally able to call their cats Ragdolls until 2005, when the trademark on "Ragdoll" was not renewed.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. trademark number 1,026,916.&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest international Ragdoll breed club is the Ragdoll Fanciers' Club International (RFCI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfci.org/ |title=Ragdoll Fanciers Club International- Ragdoll Cat Breeders Club – Welcome |publisher=Rfci.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breed description==

===Temperament===
[[File:Flame point Ragdoll.jpg|thumb|A Flame point Ragdoll.]]
The Ragdoll is marketed by breeders as having a docile, calm and floppy nature with claims that these characteristics have been passed down from the Persian and Birman breeds. Opinions vary as to whether this trait might be the result of genetic mutation.&lt;ref name="Tabor"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7-PDwgJHVS8C&amp;pg=PA33#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Understanding Cat Behavior: The Complete Feline Problem Solver] Roger Tabor (2003). P 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HYt3zSa9N1EC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=ragdoll+limp+mutation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WQjxe8R0x9&amp;sig=3pT7VXhoH0Yf13s16jzJdum5aLg&amp;hl=pl&amp;ei=VNXSSrD4HpvsmgPy5KiGAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ragdoll%20limp%20mutation&amp;f=false Do cats always land on their feet] Gina Spadafori, Marty Becker&lt;/ref&gt; The extreme docility of some individuals has led to the myth that Ragdolls are pain resistant. Some breeders in Britain have tried to breed away from the limpness owing to concerns that extreme docility "might not be in the best interests of the cat".&lt;ref name="Tabor"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mdg0R6nDWgoC&amp;pg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The Cat: Its Behavior, Nutrition &amp; Health] Linda P. Case, Kerry Helms, Bruce Macallister (2003). P 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Breed standard]] marketing and publicity material describe the Ragdoll as affectionate, intelligent, relaxed in temperament, gentle, and an easy-to-handle lap cat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfci.org/standards/gccf_std.php Ragdoll Breed standard] Governing Council of Cat Fancy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfa.org/Breeds/BreedsKthruR/Ragdoll.aspx Ragdoll Breed standard] Cat Fanciers' Association&lt;/ref&gt; The animals are often known as "[[puppy cat]]s", "dog-like cats", "cat-dogs", etc., because of their placid nature and affectionate behavior, with the cats often following owners from room to room as well as seeking physical affection akin to certain dog breeds. Ragdolls can be trained to retrieve toys and enjoy doing so.&lt;ref name=ideal/&gt;

===Physical characteristics===
The Ragdoll is one of the largest domesticated cat breeds, with a sturdy body, large frame, and proportionate legs. A fully-grown female weighs from {{convert|8|to|15|lb|kg}}. Males are substantially larger, ranging from {{convert|12|to|20|lb|kg}} or more.&lt;ref name="Helgren2006"/&gt; The genes for point coloration are responsible for the  distinctive blue eyes of the Ragdoll. More intense shades of blue are favored in cat shows. Although the breed has a plush coat, it consists mainly of long guard hairs, while the lack of a dense undercoat results, according to the Cat Fanciers' Association, in "reduced shedding and matting".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfa.org/breeds/profiles/ragdoll.html Breed Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714202130/http://www.cfa.org/breeds/profiles/ragdoll.html |date=2009-07-14 }} Cat Fanciers' Association&lt;/ref&gt;

Ragdolls come in six different colors: red, seal, chocolate and the corresponding "dilutes", including blue, lilac, and cream. This also includes the lynx and tortoiseshell variations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tica.org/cat-breeds/item/254|title=Ragdoll Introduction|website=Tica.org|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in all colors and the three patterns. Ragdoll kittens are born white; they have good color at 8–10 weeks and full color and coat at 3–4 years. The three different patterns are:
*Colorpoint – One color darkening at the extremities (nose, ears, tail, and paws).
*Mitted – Same as pointed, but with white paws and abdomen. With or without a blaze (a white line or spot on the face), but must have a "belly stripe" (white stripe that runs from the chin to the genitals) and a white chin. Mitted Ragdolls, which weren't allowed titling in CFA until the 2008–2009 show season, are often confused with Birmans. The easiest way to tell the difference is by size (the Ragdoll being obviously larger) and chin color (Mitted Ragdolls have white chins,&lt;ref name="mittedragdoll"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ragdoll Cat|publisher=capstone press|page=19|last1=Mattern|first1=Joanne}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Birmans have colored chins), although breeders recognize the two by head shape and boning.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}
*[[Bicolor cat|Bicolor]] – White legs, white inverted ''V'' on the face, white abdomen and sometimes white patches on the back. (Excessive amounts of white, or "high white", on a bicolor is known as the Van pattern, although this doesn't occur nearly as often as the other patterns.)
Variations:
*Lynx – A variant of the above type having [[Tabby cat|tabby markings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ragdollinternational.org/patscolors.shtml|title=Ragdoll International Patterns and Colors|website=Ragdollinternational.org|accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Tortoiseshell or "tortie"- A variant noted for mottled or parti-colored&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfa.org/Portals/0/documents/breeds/standards/ragdoll.pdf|format=PDF|title=Ragdoll : POINT SCORE|website=Cfa.org|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; markings in the above patterns.

==Health==
One study utilizing Swedish insurance data showed that of the common cat breeds, the Ragdoll and Siamese have the lowest survival rate. They live 15 to 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Egenvall | first1 = A. | last2 = Nødtvedt | first2 = A. | last3 = Häggström | first3 = J. | last4 = Ström Holst | first4 = B. | last5 = Möller | first5 = L. | last6 = Bonnett | first6 = B.

Whether this is an issue outside Finland, Sweden, or Denmark is unclear.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Ragdoll cats require regular grooming to ensure that their fur does not mat, as with most long-haired cat breeds; some breeders recommend bathing once a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ragdollcats.co.za/grooming-your-ragdoll/|title=Grooming your Ragdoll  {{!}}  Ragtime Cattery|website=ragdollcats.co.za|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inbreeding===
Background inbreeding is severe, around 40%, owing to the very limited number of foundation cats.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy===
[[Feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy|Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]] (HCM) is a common heart disease in all cats and is most commonly genetic in cause. The disease causes thickening of the heart wall, which makes the heart pump less efficiently. It can, in some instances, lead to sudden death. In Ragdolls [[homozygous]] positive for the disease (having two copies of the HCM gene), the condition can present early (as young as six months) and tends to be severe, with most cats dying by age 3. Heterozygous (one copy of HCM gene) cats tend to have later onset and slower progression of the disease with less severe impact. A DNA test was developed in 2007 to identify the gene that causes HCM in Ragdolls. Breeding only from Ragdolls that are free from this gene (homozygous negative) will ensure that they will not develop the form of HCM associated with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzcf.com/downloads/EC%20Meeting%20Sept%202011.doc|title=Minutes of Executive Council Meeting No: 28 (doc)|date=24–25 September 2011|publisher=New Zealand Cat Fancy|accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvm.ncsu.edu/vhc/csds/vcgl/ragdoll-faq.html|title=Frequently Asked Questions about the HCM Genetic Mutation Predominantly Found in Ragdoll Cats|publisher=NC State College of Veterinary Medicine|accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The allelic frequencies of the Ragdoll HCM mutation R820W were 0.17 in cats from Italy and 0.23 in cats from the USA in 2013.&lt;ref name="vetogene.it"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vetogene.it/GATTI/upload/jvim12031.pdf|title=Myosin-Binding Protein C DNA Variants in Domestic Cats (A31P, A74T, R820W) and their Association with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy|website=Vetogene.it|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This reference states that the R820W prevalence is 30% in UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fabcats.org/hcm/|title=Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in cats|website=Fabcats.org|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The HCM prevalence was found to be 2.9% (95% CI 2.7 -8.6% ) in this study.&lt;ref name="vetogene.it"/&gt;

'''Renee Williams''' (June 4, 1977 – March 4, 2007) was an American woman believed to be the largest woman in the world at the time of her death in 2007 from complications following her surgery for morbid [[obesity]]. Williams was also one of [[List of the heaviest people|the heaviest people to ever live]].

By the age of 12, Williams was already in the category of super-morbid obesity, which refers to a [[body mass index]] over 50. After a car crash in 2003 she became unable to walk, and added another 420&amp;nbsp;lb to her then 460&amp;nbsp;lb frame inside 4 years. She was bedridden and ate large amounts of food. Williams' daughter attests that both before and after her accident, it was a common occurrence for Williams to keep eating until her stomach hurt, with reports of her eating up to eight [[Hamburger|burgers]] at a time. Williams had a gastric bypass at age 29, when her weight was 880&amp;nbsp;lb, after a reported twelve-year wait because she did not meet the demands of any surgeon to lose a percentage of her body fat by dieting before they would consider her for surgery. Instead, she continued to gain at least 80&amp;nbsp;lb each year. She was eventually given the surgery after doctors determined she had less than a year to live at her weight; her operation was performed on a specially widened operating table.  However, she died 12 days later.

Williams was featured in the American television program ''Amazing Medical Stories'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://channelnine.ninemsn.com.au/section.aspx?sectionid=5347&amp;sectionname=amazingmedicalstories |title=Amazing Medical Stories |publisher=Channel 9 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213190107/http://channelnine.ninemsn.com.au/section.aspx?sectionid=5347&amp;sectionname=amazingmedicalstories |archivedate=February 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;At 406kg, 29-year-old Renee Williams is the world's biggest woman. Confined to her bed, Renee begged doctors to perform an operation when she became so large that she couldn't hug her own children. She's waited 12 years for the gastric bypass surgery to help her get back on her feet... but it may just be too late.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She was also the subject of a [[United Kingdom|British]] television program called "Half Ton Mum" broadcast on [[Channel 4]] after her death as part of the ''[[BodyShock]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/bodyshock/video/series-12/episode-1|title=Half Ton Mum|publisher=Channel 4 video clip}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jan/03/television.tvandradioarts |title=TV: Half Ton Mum |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=January 3, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107182527/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/jan/03/television.tvandradioarts |archivedate=January 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program stated that she also held the [[world record]] for being the heaviest person ever to have [[gastric bypass surgery]] on her stomach at 63 stone, or around 880&amp;nbsp;lb. When Williams went to the hospital for her gastric bypass, her Body Mass Index was calculated by the doctors to be 113&amp;nbsp;kg/m², where a BMI of 50+ is considered "super-morbidly obese". She was treated by the same medical team as [[Kenneth Brumley]], subject of the counterpart documentary ''Half Ton Dad''.

She was buried at Santa Maria Cemetery in Travis County Texas, US.

==Early life==

Almost everything known about Sai Baba's early life stems from the [[hagiography]] that grew around him, narratives that hold special meaning to his devotees and are considered by them to be evidence of his divine nature.&lt;ref name="BabbLawrence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UrbanHugh74" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Palmer99&gt;Palmer, Norris W.

Sai Baba's siblings included elder brother Ratnakaram Seshama Raju (1911–1985), sisters Venkamma (1918–1993) and Parvathamma (1920–1998), and younger brother Janakiramaiah (1931–2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Times of India |title=&amp;#145;Vaastu dosham&amp;#146; at hospital he built, say Sai kin |date=25 April 2011 |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-04-22/india/29463028_1_sathya-sai-baba-satyajit-trust-affairsnephew }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, he was described as "unusually intelligent" and charitable, though not necessarily academically inclined, as his interests were of a more spiritual nature.&lt;ref name="BabbLawrence"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Palmer99 /&gt; He was uncommonly talented in devotional music, dance and drama.&lt;ref name=Palmer99 /&gt;&lt;ref name="kent"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kent | first = Alexandra | authorlink = |title =Divinity and Diversity: A Hindu Revitalization Movement in Malaysia |publisher = Nordic Institute of Asian Studies | year = 2005  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=26sVhUo_aM4C&amp;pg=PA37 |pages = 37–39| isbn = 87-91114-40-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a young age, he was alleged to have been capable of materialising objects such as food and sweets out of thin air.&lt;ref name="AlexandraKent"&gt;Alexandra Kent – Creating Divine Unity: Chinese Recruitment in the Sathya Sai Baba Movement of Malaysia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson"&gt;Larson's Book of World Religions and Alternative Spirituality&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proclamation==

[[File:Baba-1940's.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Sai Baba at the age of 14, soon after proclaiming he was the reincarnation of Shirdi Sai Baba]]
On 8 March 1940, while living with his elder brother Seshama Raju in [[Uravakonda]], a small town near Puttaparthi, 14 year old Sathya was apparently stung by a scorpion.&lt;ref name="AlexandraKent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson"/&gt; He lost consciousness for several hours&lt;ref name="kent"/&gt; and in the next few days underwent a noticeable change in behaviour.&lt;ref name="Larson"/&gt; There were "symptoms of laughing and weeping, eloquence and silence."&lt;ref name="Larson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="serpent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vahini.org/sss/i/serpent.html |title=Sathyam Sivam Sundaram Part I: 5. The Serpent Hill |publisher=Vahini.org |date=8 March 1940 |accessdate=6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed that then "he began to sing [[Sanskrit]] verses, a language of which it is alleged he had no prior knowledge."&lt;ref name="RichardWeiss"/&gt; Doctors concluded his behaviour to be [[hysteria]].&lt;ref name="RichardWeiss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson"/&gt; Concerned, his parents brought Sathya back home to Puttaparthi&lt;ref name="sss3620"&gt;{{cite web| last = Staff| first =| title = Sathya Sai Speaks Volume 36 (2003): 20.

One of the exorcists at [[Kadiri]], a town near Puttaparthi, went to the extent of torturing him with the aim of curing him;{{elucidate|date=March 2013}} Sathya seemingly kept calm throughout the torture.&lt;ref name="Larson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="serpent"/&gt;

On 23 May 1940, Sathya called household members and reportedly materialised sugar candy (''[[prasad]])'' and flowers for them.&lt;ref name="Kheirabadi2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Masoud Kheirabadi|title=Sri Satya Sai Baba|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n06499wG5VcC&amp;pg=PA28|accessdate=24 April 2011|date=March 2005|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-7910-8104-4|pages=28–}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father became furious at seeing this, thinking his son was [[Spirit possession|bewitched]]. He took a stick and threatened to beat him if Sathya did not reveal who he really was, the young Sathya responded calmly and firmly "I am Sai Baba", a reference to [[Sai Baba of Shirdi]].&lt;ref name="RichardWeiss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kent"/&gt; This was the first time he proclaimed himself to be the reincarnation of Sai Baba of Shirdi—a saint who became famous in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in [[Maharashtra]] and had died eight years before Sathya was born.&lt;ref name="RichardWeiss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sss3620"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schulman, Arnold 1971 pp. 122"&gt;Schulman, Arnold (1971).

==First mandir and development of Puttaparthi==

In 1944, a [[mandir]] for Sai Baba's devotees was built near the village of [[Puttaparthi]]. It is now referred to as the "old mandir".&lt;ref name="murphetman"&gt;Murphet, Howard (1977), ''Man of Miracles'', Weiser, {{ISBN|0-87728-335-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bowen"&gt;Bowen, David (1988).

Leeds: University Press. {{ISBN|1-871363-02-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of [[Prashanthi Nilayam]], the current ashram, began in 1948 and was completed in 1950.&lt;ref name="BabbLawrence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bowen"/&gt; In 1954, Sai Baba established a small free general hospital in the village of Puttaparthi.&lt;ref name="TheHinduNewspaper"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/features/saibaba/stories/2005112300270300.htm |title=Sri Sathya Sai 80th year of Advent |publisher=The Hindu |date=23 November 2005|accessdate=10 January 2010|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won fame for mystical powers and the ability to heal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/24/sri-sathya-sai-baba-dies|title=Sai Baba, spiritual guru to millions, dies at 85|author=Jason Burke|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957 Sai Baba went on a North Indian temple tour.&lt;ref name="Eade"/&gt;

==Stroke, paralysis and prediction of reincarnation==

In 1963, it was asserted that Sai Baba suffered a stroke and four severe heart attacks, which left him paralysed on one side.&lt;ref name="murphetmiracle"&gt;Murphet, Howard (1977). ''Man of Miracles''. Weiser. {{ISBN|0-87728-335-4}} portions available online https://books.google.com/books?id=BPsVFqhclS0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; These events culminated in an event where he apparently healed himself in front of the thousands of people gathered in Prashanthi Nilayam who were then praying for his recovery.&lt;ref name="BabbLawrence"/&gt;

On recovering, Sai Baba announced that he would one day next be reborn as an incarnation named ''Prema Sai Baba'' in the neighbouring state of [[Karnataka]].&lt;ref name="BabbLawrence"/&gt; He stated, "I am Shiva-Sakthi, born in the [[gotra]] (lineage) of [[Bharadwaja]], according to a boon won by that sage from [[Shiva|Siva]] and [[Shakti|Sakthi]]. Siva was born in the gotra of that sage as Sai Baba of Shirdi; Shiva and Sakthi have incarnated as Myself in his gotra now; Sakthi alone will incarnate as the third Sai (Prema Sai Baba) in the same gotra in [[Mandya]] district of Karnataka State."&lt;ref name="BabbLawrence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SSDiscourse1963"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sathyasai.org/discour/1963/d630706.htm |title=Shiva Shakthi |publisher=Sathyasai.org |date=6 July 1963 |accessdate=6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated he would be born again eight years after his death at the age of 96,&lt;ref name="saiprema"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sathyasai.org/intro/premasai.htm|title=About Prema Sai Baba|work=sathyasai.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; but died at the age of 84.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13180011 | work=BBC News | title=Satya Sai Baba, Indian guru, dies at 84 | date=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africa==

On 29 June 1968, Sai Baba made his only overseas trip, to [[Kenya]] and [[Uganda]].&lt;ref name="murphetmiracle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kasturi3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vahini.org/sss/iii/awakening.html |title=Sathyam Sivam Sundaram Part III: 3. The Awakening Continent |publisher=Vahini.org |date=7 December 1968 |accessdate=6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Nairobi]], he spoke of his personal mission: {{quote|"I have come to light the lamp of Love in your hearts, to see that it shines day by day with added lustre. I have not come on behalf of any exclusive religion. I have not come on a mission of publicity for a sect or creed or cause, nor have I come to collect followers for a doctrine. I have no plan to attract disciples or devotees into my fold or any fold. I have come to tell you of this unitary faith, this spiritual principle, this path of Love, this virtue of Love, this duty of Love, this obligation of Love."&lt;ref name="sss0822"&gt;{{cite web| last = Staff|first =| title = Sathya Sai Speaks Volume 8 (1968): 22.

==Later years==

In 1968, he established Dharmakshetra or the Sathyam Mandir in [[Mumbai]].&lt;ref name="Official"/&gt; In 1973, he established the Shivam Mandir in [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]].&lt;ref name="Official"/&gt; On 19 January 1981, in [[Chennai]], he inaugurated the Sundaram Mandir.&lt;ref name="Official"/&gt;

In a [[1993 Murders in Prashanthi Nilayam|1993 incident]], four intruders armed with knives entered his bedroom, either as an assassination attempt or as part of a power struggle between his followers. Sai Baba was unharmed. During the scuffle and the police response, the intruders and two of Sai Baba's attendants were killed. The official investigation left questions unanswered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/who-is-sri-sathya-sai-baba-101102|title=Who is Sri Sathya Sai Baba?|agency=Press Trust of India|date=24 April 2011|publisher=[[NDTV]]|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/religion-obituaries/8471342/Sathya-Sai-Baba.html |title=Religion Obituaries; Satya Sai Baba |publisher=The Telegraph |date=24 April 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_sathya-sai-baba-escaped-murder-attempt_1535839 |title=Sathya Sai Baba escaped murder attempt|date=25 April 2011|last=Madhusoodan|first=M K |work=[[Daily News and Analysis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1995, Sai Baba started a project to provide drinking water to 1.2 million people in the drought-prone Rayalaseema region in the [[Anantapur district]] of [[Andhra Pradesh]].&lt;ref name = "cmpraise"/&gt; In April 1999 he inaugurated the Ananda Nilayam Mandir in [[Madurai]], Tamil Nadu.

In 2001 he established another free super-speciality hospital in [[Bangalore]] to benefit the poor.&lt;ref name="TheHinduNewspaper"/&gt; The ''[[Vancouver Sun]]'' in 2001 reported that Sai Baba told his adherents not to browse the Internet&lt;ref name= VS&gt;The Vancouver Sun, 27 February 2001, ''Holy man? Sex abuser? Both?''&lt;/ref&gt; after Sai Baba said, "These teachings (the Vedas) are highly sacred. Today people are ready to believe all that they see on television and internet but do not repose their faith in the Vedic declarations. Internet is like a waste paper basket. Follow the 'innernet,' not the internet."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sssbpt.info/ssspeaks/volume33/sss33-17.pdf 17. The Source And Centre Of Values]. sssbpt.info&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old age and illness==

In 2003, Sai Baba suffered a fractured hip when a student standing on an iron stool slipped and the boy and stool both fell on him. After that he gave [[darshana]] from a car or his porte chair.&lt;ref name="RadioSai20060407"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiosai.org/Pages/PB_20060407.htm |title=Sai Global Harmony – Prasanthi Bulletin |publisher=Radiosai.org |date=7 April 2006 |accessdate=6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ibnlive.in.com82-2"&gt;{{cite web

On 28 March 2011, Sai Baba was admitted to the [[Sri Sathya Sai Super Speciality Hospital]] at Prashantigram at Puttaparthi, following respiration-related problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Sai Baba in stable condition: Hospital| newspaper = [[Hindustan Times]]| date = 5 April 2011| url = http://www.hindustantimes.com/Sai-Baba-in-stable-condition-Hospital/Article1-681433.aspx| accessdate = 24 April 2011| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110509014742/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Sai-Baba-in-stable-condition-Hospital/Article1-681433.aspx| archivedate = 9 May 2011| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Baba's health condition 'stable' | newspaper = [[The Times of India]] | date = 6 April 2011 | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-04-06/hyderabad/29388337_1_vital-parameters-condition-crrt | accessdate = 24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After nearly a month of hospitalisation, during which his condition progressively deteriorated, Sai Baba died on Sunday, 24 April at 7:40 IST, aged 84.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Spiritual leader Sathya Sai Baba passes away | newspaper = [[The Times of India]] | date = 24 April 2011 | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-04-24/india/29468573_1_sai-baba-sathya-sai-central-trust-puttaparthi   | accessdate = 24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sai Baba had predicted that he would die at age 96 and would remain healthy until then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Redemptive Encounters: Three Modern Styles in the Hindu Tradition|last=Babb|first=Lawrence A.|publisher=University of California Press|year=1991|isbn=0-520-07636-2|location=|page=166|quote=His present incarnation, he says, ... He will die at the age of ninety-six, but his body will stay young until then.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After he died, some devotees suggested that he was referring to that many [[lunar calendar|lunar years]], as counted by Telugu-speaking Hindus, rather than [[tropical year|solar years]],&lt;ref&gt;Mohammed Shafeeq. However it was soon  clearly shown that the lunar reckoning does not work.  Post. Durban: 27 April 2011. pg. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and using the [[hindu calendar|Indian way]] of [[Ageing#Cultural variations|accounting for age]], which counts the year to come as part of the person's life.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Philip M. Prasad, Malayalam Daily. Kerala, India: 25 April 2011. "What Baba has foretold was indeed correct. According to the Roman calendar he has completed 85 years. But one can note that generally in all of Baba's discourses Baba had been referring to the star (lunar) basis in calculations. In Indian astrology there are 27 stars in a month starting with Aswathy and ending with Revathy. Accordingly a year of 12 months is composed of 324 days. Sai Baba was born on 23 November 1925. From that day till his death day 24 April 2011 there were a total of 33,899 days. If this is divided with 324, we get 95 years and 54 days. Accordingly, under the star basis of calculation he was in his 96th year having completed 54 days when he left his physical body."&lt;/ref&gt; Other devotees have spoken of his anticipated [[resurrection]], [[reincarnation]] or [[wakefulness|awakening]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Hindustan Times'', New Delhi: 25 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Narayan |first1=Sreejith |title=Sai, Thy Kingdom Come | year = 2012| isbn = 978-1-62314-842-3 | url =http://www.saikingdom.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opening of residence==

On 17 June 2011, officials from the Sri Sathya Sai Central Trust (founded as a charitable Trust in India, and legally separate from religious activities),&lt;ref&gt;Radio Sai's E-Journal. Sri Sathya Sai Central Trust Press Meet, 28 June 2011, http://media.radiosai.org/Journals/Vol_09/01JUN11/11-press_meet_Part02.htm&lt;/ref&gt; opened his private residence in the presence of government, bank and tax department officials, including retired Supreme Court Judge A P Mishra and retired judge of Karnataka High Court Vaidyanatha, an assessor approved by the Income Tax Department, and former Chief Justice of India P N Bhagavati.&lt;ref&gt;Deccan Herald, Tuesday 17 June. 2011, "Huge amount of gold, silver, cash found in Sai Baba's Chamber" http://www.deccanherald.com/content/169535/huge-amount-gold-silver-cash.html.&lt;/ref&gt; In the private residence, which had been sealed since his death, they inventoried 98&amp;nbsp;kg of gold ornaments, approximate value Rs 21 [[crores]] (US$4.7m), 307&amp;nbsp;kg of silver ornaments, approximate value Rs 16&amp;nbsp;million (US$0.36m), and Rs 116&amp;nbsp;million (US$2.6m) in cash. The cash was deposited into the Sai Trust's account at the State Bank of India with payment of government taxes (thus transferring them from religious gifts to Trust assets.) The gold and other items were inventoried, assessed, and placed in secure storage. In July, district authorities inventoried an additional Rs 7.7&amp;nbsp;million (US$0.17m) in valuables in another 4 rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-07-03/india/29733031_1_satya-sai-baba-precious-metals-diamond-ring |title=Assets worth Rs 77L seized at Sai ashram | newspaper=Times of India | date=3 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total value of these items is believed to exceed 7.8 million US dollars.&lt;ref name="hindustan times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Treasure island: Sai Baba's gold trove|publisher=[[Press Trust of India]]|date=17 June 2011|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Treasure-island-Sai-Baba-s-gold-trove/Article1-710596.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also inventoried at Yajurmandir were many articles stored and routinely given away as gifts in various ceremonies to devotees and those who performed [[selfless service]], including thousands of pure silk sarees, dhotis, shirts, 500 pairs of shoes, dozens of bottles of perfume and hairspray, watches, a large number of silver and gold "mangala sutrams", and precious stones such as diamonds. There were also 750 saffron and white robes of the type Sai Baba wore.&lt;ref name="500 pairs"&gt;{{cite news |title=Open sesame!

==Release of will==

On 2 September 2012, Satyajit Salian, a close aide of Sri Sathya Sai Baba, released to the media a declaration made by Sai Baba, and registered on 23 March 1967, in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] saying his relatives had no authority over the Sathya Sai Trust assets. The exact text of the declaration was:

{{quote|I, Sri Sathya Sai of Parshanthi Nilayam P.O. Indian Inhabitant hereby declare as follows:-

Satyajit Sailan also attached the attestation of Indulal Sha, who is the sole surviving witness to the original document. Satyajit Sailan said he has been in possession of the document since 1998, per the directions of Sai Baba. Officials from the Sri Sathya Sai Central Trust stated to the media that they would respect this will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstrackindia.com/newsdetails/2012/09/03/296--Trust-says-it-respects-Sai-Baba-s-will-.html|title=Trust says it respects Sai Baba's will|work=newstrackindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/declaration-made-by-satya-sai-in-1967-released/287928-60-121.html|title=Declaration made by Satya Sai in 1967 released|work=IBNLive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Sathya Sai Organisation}}
The Sathya Sai Organisation (or Sri Sathya Sai [[Selfless service|Seva]] Organization) was founded in the 1960s by Sai Baba.&lt;ref name="srisaiorg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srisathyasai.org.in/Pages/Sai_Organisations/Sai_Organisations.htm|title=SSSCT- Sri Sathya Sai Seva Organisation|work=srisathyasai.org.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Sai Centres were started in India under the name of the "Sri Sathya Sai Seva Samithi".&lt;ref name="saiindia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saibabaofindia.com/sai_baba_centers.htm|title=Sai Baba Of India-Sri Sathya Sai Baba Centers- Sai Baba organisation worldwide|work=saibabaofindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Sathya Sai Organisation originated "to enable its members to undertake service activities as a means to spiritual advancement."&lt;ref name="srisaiorg"/&gt; The official mission of the Sathya Sai Organization is "to help its members realize the innate divinity within".

The Sathya Sai Organisation publishes an official monthly magazine named ''[[Sanathana Sarathi (magazine)|Sanathana Sarathi]]'', published by the Sri Sathya Sai Books and Publications Trust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sanathana-Sarathi-(magazine) Sanathana Sarathi magazine: Latest News, Videos and Photos of Sanathana Sarathi magazine]. Times of India.&lt;/ref&gt; The English translation of the word Sanathana Sarathi means 'Eternal Charioteer'.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Sai Baba stated that the main objective of the Sathya Sai Organisation "is to help man recognize the divinity that is inherent in him. So, your duty is to emphasize the One, to experience the One in all you do or speak. Do not give any importance to differences of religion or sect or status or colour. Have the feeling of one-ness permeate every act of yours. Only those who do so have a place in this Organization; the rest can withdraw."&lt;ref&gt;Sathya Sai Baba Sathya Sai Speaks IX, 35, 187–188 (old edition)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sathyasai-se.org/|title=Sathya Sai Baba Avatar Sweden Sverige|work=sathyasai-se.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Telugu-Ganga Project'''

The Telugu-Ganga project is a water supply scheme implemented by [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[India]] to provide drinking water to [[Chennai]] city in [[Tamil Nadu]]. The source of water is the river Krishna in Andhra Pradesh and the Poondi reservoir near Chennai is the destination with water planned to be routed through a series of interlinked canals.

The water initially supplied by the canal was disappointing, delivering less than 500 million cubic feet (14×10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). In 2002, Sri Sathya Sai Baba announced a scheme of restoration and lining of the canal; as his own undertaking. With an extensive rebuilding of the canal and several reservoirs, the project was completed in 2004, when Poondi reservoir received Krishna water for the first time.&lt;sup&gt;[[Telugu Ganga project#cite note-2|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt; The supply of water to Chennai city in 2006 was 3.7 billion cubic feet (100×10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;sup&gt;[[Telugu Ganga project#cite note-3|[3]]]&lt;/sup&gt; After the re-lining and reconstruction, the Kandaleru-Poondi part of the canal was renamed Sai Ganga.&lt;sup&gt;[[Telugu Ganga project#cite note-4|[4]]][[Telugu Ganga project#cite note-5|[5]]][[Telugu Ganga project#cite note-6|[6]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Followers believed in seeking the spiritual benefit of Sai Baba's ''[[darsana|darshan]]'', scheduled for morning and afternoon each day. Sai Baba would interact with people, accept letters, materialise and distribute [[vibhuti]] (sacred ash) or call groups or individuals for interviews. Devotees considered it a great privilege to have an interview and sometimes a single person, group or family was invited for a private interview for answers to spiritual questions and general guidance.&lt;ref name="kent"/&gt;

== Controversies ==
=== Criticism ===
Accusations&lt;!-- Please do not change this wording, this has been agreed on the talk page. If you don't agree on it read the discussion there. --&gt; against Sai Baba by his critics over the years have included sleight of hand, sexual abuse, money laundering, fraud in the performance of service projects, and murder.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Palmer116/&gt;

In 1972 [[Abraham Kovoor]] made the first public criticism of Sai Baba&lt;ref name="srisathyasaibabaandthepress"&gt;Ruhela S.P., ''Sri Sathya Sai Baba and the Press'', pp. 1–5, 1997 {{ISBN|81-7533-041-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he looked into a claim publicly narrated by one devotee&lt;ref name="srisathyasaibabaandthepress" /&gt; that Sai Baba had created a new model of a [[Seiko]] watch, and found the claim to be untrue.&lt;ref name="sathyasaibabasgrace"&gt;Ruhela S.P., ''How to Receive Sri Sathya Sai Baba's Grace'', pp. 277, 2006 {{ISBN|81-7182-089-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OutlookSingh&gt;{{cite web|title=The Spell Breaker|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?262445|publisher=Outlook|accessdate=16 October 2013|author=Rahul Singh|date=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1976, [[Hosur Narasimhaiah|Hossur Narasimhaiah]], a physicist, rationalist and then vice-chancellor of [[Bangalore University]], founded and chaired a committee "to rationally and scientifically investigate miracles and other verifiable superstitions". Narasimhaiah wrote Sai Baba three widely publicised letters challenging him to perform his miracles under controlled conditions. The letters were ignored.&lt;ref name="haraldsson204"&gt;Haraldson, ''op. cit'', pp&amp;nbsp;204–205&lt;/ref&gt; Sai Baba said that he ignored Narasimhaiah's challenge because he felt his approach was improper, adding that "Science must confine its inquiry only to things belonging to the human senses, while spiritualism transcends the senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Satya Sai Baba and His Miracles|publisher=The Chakra|url=http://www.chakranews.com/satya-sai-baba-and-his-miracles/3543}}&lt;/ref&gt; If you want to understand the nature of spiritual power you can do so only through the path of spirituality and not science.

Karanjia]] of ''Blitz'' news magazine in September 1976 [http://www.saibaba.ws/articles/interviewwithjournalistsept1976.htm Available online]&lt;/ref&gt; Narasimhaiah's committee was dissolved in August 1977. According to [[Erlendur Haraldsson]], the committee's formal challenge came to a dead end because of its negative attitude and perhaps because of the fanfare surrounding it. Narasimhaiah held the fact that  Sai Baba ignored his letters to be one of several indications that his miracles were fraudulent.&lt;ref&gt;Haraldsson, pp 209&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this episode, a public debate raged for several months in Indian newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Haraldsson, ''op. cit.'', pp. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian rationalist [[Basava Premanand]], who began campaigning against Sai Baba in 1976, unsuccessfully attempted to sue him in 1986 for violations of the [[Gold Control Act]], citing Sai Baba's purported materialisations of gold objects. When the case was dismissed, Premanand unsuccessfully appealed on the grounds that claimed spiritual power is not a defence recognised in law.&lt;ref name=bbca1&gt;{{cite news|author=Tanya Datta|title=Sai Baba: Goan or con man?|date=17 June 2004|work=[[BBC News]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/3813469.stm | accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1995 TV documentary ''Guru Busters'', produced by filmmaker [[Robert Eagle (writer and director)|Robert Eagle]] for the UK's [[Channel 4]], accused Sai Baba of faking his materialisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eagletv.co.uk/home/guru.htm |title=Eagle &amp; Eagle |publisher=Eagletv.co.uk |date= |accessdate=7 January 2010}} [http://www.eagletv.co.uk/home/videos/Saimagic.mov Clip]&lt;/ref&gt; The clip from the film was mentioned in the ''[[Deccan Chronicle]]'', on 23 November 1992, in a front-page headline "DD Tape Unveils Baba Magic".&lt;ref&gt;Haraldsson, ''op. cit.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;295–301&lt;/ref&gt; But Haraldsson stated that, on investigating the DD video, researchers did not find evidence of fake materialisation. According to Haraldsson, the video was taken to a company that investigates corporate fraud, which found that it did not provide firm evidence of sleight of hand.&lt;ref&gt;Haraldsson, ''op. cit.'', pp 300, 295–301&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, British journalist Mick Brown stated in his book ''The Spiritual Tourist'' that in his opinion claims of Sai Baba resurrecting American devotee Walter Cowan in 1971 were probably untrue.&lt;ref name="spiritualtourist"&gt;Mick Brown, ''The Spiritual Tourist'', 1998, Bloomsbury Publishing, {{ISBN|1-58234-034-X}} "In the House of God", pp.&amp;nbsp;73–74&lt;/ref&gt; His opinion was based on letters from the attending doctors presented in the magazine ''[[Indian Skeptic]]'', published by Basava Premanand.&lt;ref name="spiritualtourist"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hislop, John S. ''My Baba and I'' 1985 published by Birth Day Publishing Company, San Diego, California {{ISBN|0-9600958-8-8}}, "The Resurrection of Walter Cowan", pages&amp;nbsp;28–31&lt;/ref&gt; Brown also related, in the same book, his experiences with manifestations of ''vibuthi'' from Sai Baba's pictures in houses in London, which he felt were not fraudulent or the result of trickery.&lt;ref name="touristmiracle"&gt;Brown Mick, ''The Spiritual Tourist'', "The Miracle in North London", pp.&amp;nbsp;29–30, 1998 {{ISBN|158234034X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown wrote with regards to Sai Baba's claims of omniscience, that "sceptics have produced documentation clearly showing discrepancies between Baba's reading of historical events and biblical prophecies, and the established accounts."&lt;ref name="spiritualtourist"/&gt;

===Claims of sexual abuse===
In January 2002, a documentary produced by Denmark's national television and radio broadcast company, [[Danish radio|Danmarks Radio]] (DR), named ''Seduced By Sai Baba'', analysed videos of public manifestations of Sai Baba, and suggested that they could be explained as [[sleight of hand]].&lt;ref name="seduced"&gt;{{cite video|people=Øyvind Kyrø, Steen Jensen |title=Seduced by Sai Baba |medium=Documentary |publisher=[[DR (broadcaster)|DR]] |date=2002 |time= |url=http://dr.dk/Salg/DRsales/Programmes/Documentary/Society_and_Social/20070629133445_3_1_3_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204010039/http://www.dr.dk/Salg/DRsales/Programmes/Documentary/Society_and_Social/20070629133445_3_1_3_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1.htm |archivedate=4 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary also presented interviews with Alaya Rahm, former devotee of the cult, where he alleged sexual abuse by Sai Baba.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; As a result, in 2002 the Parliament of the United Kingdom discussed the possible danger to male children of British families intending to visit the ashram of Sathya Sai Baba in case of individual audiences with the guru.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2001-02/886] UK Parliament official web site&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the [[BBC]] produced a documentary titled ''The Secret Swami'', as part of its series "The World Uncovered".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/3791921.stm |title=Programmes &amp;#124; This World &amp;#124; Secret Swami |publisher=BBC News |date=11 June 2004 |accessdate=7 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One central theme of the BBC documentary was again Alaya Rahm's sexual abuse allegations against Sai Baba.&lt;ref name=bbcd&gt;{{cite video|people=Eamon Hardy, Tanya Datta|title=Secret Swami|medium=Documentary|publisher=BBC News|date=2004 |time= |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/3791921.stm | accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This documentary interviewed him together with Mark Roche, who had spent 25 years of his life since 1969 in the movement and alleged abuse by Sai Baba.&lt;ref name=bbcd/&gt; The show also featured allegations from Sai Baba critic Basava Premanand. Premanand stated in the documentary that, in his opinion, Sai Baba faked his materialisations. Here, he claimed that Sai Baba was "not just a fraud, but a dangerous sexual abuser". According to his interview, he had stories which spanned 30 years, and he stated that his stories were similar, a common practice being the rubbing of genitals with oil by the spiritual leader. Among his claims were that one ex-devotee claimed Sai Baba "put the oil on his hands, told me to drop my pants and rubbed my genitals with the oil". Premanand theorised that many Indian boys were abused but were never heard from because they were too afraid to speak out, alleging Sai Baba was well-connected with the elite and powerful of India.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

===Responses===
Sai Baba and his followers reject any allegations of misconduct.&lt;ref name=funeral/&gt; Devotee [[Bill Aitken (traveller)|Bill Aitken]] was quoted by ''[[The Week]]'' as saying that Sai Baba's reputation had not been harmed by the negative stories published about him. He said that the more detractors railed against Sai Baba, the more new devotees went to see him.&lt;ref&gt;Aitken, Bill (27 November 2005),{{cite web|url=http://www.the-week.com/25nov27/currentevents_article10.htm |title=Miracle of Welfare |accessdate=9 September 2006 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909111636/http://www.the-week.com/25nov27/currentevents_article10.htm |archivedate=9 September 2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the article ''Divine Downfall'', published in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', Anil Kumar, the ex-principal of the Sathya Sai Educational Institute, said that he believed that the controversy was part of Baba's divine plan and that all great religious teachers had to face criticism during their lives. Anil Kumar also said that allegations had been levelled at Sai Baba since childhood, but with every criticism he had become more and more triumphant.&lt;ref name="divine"&gt;Brown, Mick (28 October 2000). "Divine Downfall". Daily Telegraph.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Redemptive Encounters: Three Modern Styles in the Hindu Tradition'', Lawrence A. Babb wrote of Sai Baba, "Whoever he is, he is certainly more than the mere parlour magician many of his critics claim that he is."&lt;ref name="BabbLawrence"/&gt;

Sai Baba publicly responded to the allegations on 25 December 2000:
{{quote|Some people out of their mean-mindedness are trying to tarnish the image of Sai Baba. I am not after name and fame. So, I do not lose anything by their false allegations. My glory will go on increasing day by day. It will never diminish even a bit if they were to publicise their false allegations in the whole world in bold letters. Some devotees seem to be perturbed over these false statements. They are not true devotees at all. Having known the mighty power of Sai, why should they be afraid of the 'cawing of crows'? One should not get carried away by all that is written on walls, said in political meetings or the vulgar tales carried by the print media.&lt;ref&gt;Sathya Sai Speaks Vol.33, pg.389&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''[[The Times of India]]'' on 26 December 2000 quoted Sai Baba as saying: {{quote|[[Jesus Christ]] underwent many hardships, and was put to the cross because of jealousy. Many around him could not bear the good work he did and the large number of followers he gathered. One of his disciples, [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]], betrayed him. In those days there was one Judas, but today there are thousands. Just as that Judas was tempted to betray Jesus, the Judases of today, too, are bought out to lie. Jealousy was the motive behind the allegations levelled at him.&lt;ref&gt;Rao, Manu (26 December 2000), Sai Baba lashes out at detractors http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bangalore/sai-baba-lashes-out-at-detractors/articleshow/534425761.cms&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In an official letter made public in December 2001, [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] (then [[Prime Minister of India]] and a devotee of Sai Baba),&lt;ref name=Palmer97-98 /&gt; [[P. N. Bhagwati|P.N.

==Genetic basis==
The disorder is linked a mutation in the ''[[WNT4|Wnt4]]'' gene. There is an intraexonic homozygous C to T transition at cDNA position 341. This leads to an alanine to valine residue substitution at amino acid position 114, a location highly conserved in all organisms, including zebrafish and Drosophila. A subsequent influence on mRNA stability leads to protein loss of function. [[WNT4]] usually represses male sex development.&lt;ref name="SEVEN" /&gt;

==Phenotypic abnormalities==
The effect of the disorder is female to male sex reversal. Patients also exhibit renal, adrenal, and lung [[Dysgenesis (embryology)|dysgenesis]]. One indicator is low levels of unconjugated [[estriol]] in maternal serum, because this denotes adrenal [[hypoplasia]].&lt;ref name="SEVEN" /&gt;

==Sleep latency studies==
Pioneering Stanford University sleep researcher [[William C. Dement]] reports early development of the concept, and of the first test for it, the [[Multiple Sleep Latency Test]] (MSLT), in his book ''The Promise of Sleep''.&lt;ref&gt;Dement, William C.; Christopher Vaughan (1999). The Promise of Sleep: A Pioneer in Sleep Medicine Explores the Vital Connection Between Health, Happiness, and a Good Night's Sleep. Dell Trade Paperbacks. {{ISBN|0-440-50901-7}}. pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Dement and colleagues including [[Mary Carskadon]] had been seeking an objective measure of daytime sleepiness to help assess the effects of sleep disorders. In the course of evaluating experimental results, they realized that the amount of time it took to fall asleep in bed was closely linked to the subjects' own self-evaluated level of sleepiness. "This may not seem like an earthshaking epiphany, but conceiving and developing an objective measure of sleepiness was perhaps one of the most important advances in sleep science," Dement and coauthor Christopher Vaughn write of the discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Dement, William C.; Christopher Vaughan (1999). The Promise of Sleep: A Pioneer in Sleep Medicine Explores the Vital Connection Between Health, Happiness, and a Good Night's Sleep. Dell Trade Paperbacks. {{ISBN|0-440-50901-7}}. p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

When they initially developed the MSLT, Dement and others put subjects in a quiet, dark room with a bed and asked them to lie down, close their eyes and relax. They noted the number of minutes, ranging from 0 to 20, that it took a subject to fall asleep. If a volunteer was still awake after 20 minutes, the experiment was ended and the subject given a maximal alertness/minimal sleepiness rating. When scientists deprived subjects of sleep, they found sleep latency levels could drop below 1, i.e., subjects could fall asleep in less than a minute. The amount of sleep loss was directly linked to changes in sleep latency scores.&lt;ref&gt;Dement, William C.; Christopher Vaughan (1999). The Promise of Sleep: A Pioneer in Sleep Medicine Explores the Vital Connection Between Health, Happiness, and a Good Night's Sleep. Dell Trade Paperbacks. {{ISBN|0-440-50901-7}}. p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The studies eventually led Dement and Carskadon to conclude that "the brain keeps an exact accounting of how much sleep it is owed".&lt;ref&gt;Dement, William C.; Christopher Vaughan (1999). The Promise of Sleep: A Pioneer in Sleep Medicine Explores the Vital Connection Between Health, Happiness, and a Good Night's Sleep. Dell Trade Paperbacks. {{ISBN|0-440-50901-7}}. p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Not getting enough sleep during any given period of time leads to a phenomenon called [[sleep debt]], which lowers sleep latency scores and makes sleep-deprived individuals fall asleep more quickly.

==Home testing of sleep latency==
For home-testing for an unusually low sleep latency and potential sleep deprivation, the authors point to a technique developed by [[Nathaniel Kleitman]], the "father of sleep research." The subject reclines in a quiet, darkened room and drapes a hand holding a spoon over the edge of the bed or chair, placing a plate on the floor beneath the spoon. After checking the time, the subject tries to relax and fall asleep. When sleep is attained, the spoon will fall and strike the plate, awakening the subject, who then checks to see how much time has passed. The number of minutes passed is the sleep onset latency at that particular hour on that particular day.&lt;ref&gt;Dement, William C.; Christopher Vaughan (1999). The Promise of Sleep: A Pioneer in Sleep Medicine Explores the Vital Connection Between Health, Happiness, and a Good Night's Sleep. Dell Trade Paperbacks. {{ISBN|0-440-50901-7}}. p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dement advises against doing these evaluations at night when sleep onset latency can naturally be lower, particularly in older people. Instead, he suggests testing sleep onset latency during the day, ideally at 10:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., 12:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. and 3:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. A sleep onset latency of 0 to 5 minutes indicates severe sleep deprivation, 5 to 10 minutes is "troublesome," 10 to 15 minutes indicates a mild but "manageable" degree of sleep debt, and 15 to 20 minutes is indicative of "little or no" sleep debt.&lt;ref&gt;Dement, William C.; Christopher Vaughan (1999). The Promise of Sleep: A Pioneer in Sleep Medicine Explores the Vital Connection Between Health, Happiness, and a Good Night's Sleep. Dell Trade Paperbacks. {{ISBN|0-440-50901-7}}. pp. 341–342.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biomarkers of sleepiness==
Contemporary sleep researchers, including Paul Shaw of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, have been pursuing development of biological indicators, or biomarkers, of sleepiness. In December 2006, Shaw reported online in ''The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'' that his lab had shown that levels of [[amylase]] increased in fruit fly saliva when the flies were sleep-deprived. He then showed that human amylase also increased as human subjects were deprived of sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Seugnet L, Boero J, Gottschalk L, Duntley SP, Shaw PJ |title=Identification of a biomarker for sleep drive in flies and humans |journal=Proc.

'''''Ten Days in a Mad-House''''' is a book by American journalist [[Nellie Bly]]. It was initially published as a series of articles for the ''[[New York World]]''; Bly later compiled the articles into a book, being published by Ian L. Munro in [[New York City]] in 1887.&lt;ref name=ten&gt;{{Cite web|author = Bill DeMain |title= Ten Days in a Madhouse: The Woman Who Got Herself Committed |publisher= mental floss|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/29734/ten-days-madhouse-woman-who-got-herself-committed|accessdate=2013-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{Cite news|author = TIME Staff |title= Top 10 Literary Stunts |publisher= Time|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1890856_1890855_1890771,00.html
|accessdate=2013-04-23|date=2009-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was based on articles written while Bly was on an [[undercover journalism|undercover assignment]] for the ''New York World'', feigning insanity at a women's boarding house, so as to be involuntarily committed to an insane asylum. She then investigated the reports of brutality and neglect at the [[The Octagon (Roosevelt Island, New York)|Women's Lunatic Asylum]] on [[Blackwell's Island]].&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;

The book received acclaim from critics at the time. Accumulation of her reportage and the release of her content brought her fame and led to a grand jury investigation and financial increase in the Department of Public Charities and Corrections.

==Research==
{{refimprove|section|date=January 2017}}
Bly left the ''[[Pittsburgh Dispatch]]'' in 1887 for New York City. Penniless after four months, she talked her way into the offices of [[Joseph Pulitzer]]'s newspaper the ''[[New York World]]'', and took an [[Undercover journalism|undercover assignment]] for which she agreed to feign insanity to investigate reports of brutality and neglect at the Women's Lunatic Asylum on [[Blackwell's Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/nellie-blys-lessons-in-writing-what-you-want-to|title=Nellie Bly’s Lessons in Writing What You Want To|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a night spent practicing expressions in front of a mirror, she checked into a [[boardinghouse]]. She refused to go to bed, telling the boarders that she was afraid of them and that they looked "crazy." They soon decided that ''she'' was "crazy," and the next morning summoned the police. Taken to a courtroom, she claimed to have [[amnesia]]. The judge concluded she had been drugged.

Several doctors then examined her; all declared her insane. "Positively demented," said one, "I consider it a hopeless case. She needs to be put where someone will take care of her."&lt;ref name=Bly1887&gt;Bly 1887.&lt;/ref&gt; The head of the insane pavilion at [[Bellevue Hospital]] pronounced her "undoubtedly insane". The case of the "pretty crazy girl" attracted media attention: "Who Is This Insane Girl?" asked the ''[[New York Sun (historical)|New York Sun]]''. ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote of the "mysterious waif" with the "wild, haunted look in her eyes" and her desperate cry: "I can't remember I can't remember."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kroeger |first=Brooke |year=1994 |title=Nellie Bly: Daredevil, Reporter, Feminist |location= |publisher= |isbn= | pages=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1887/09/26/archives/in-and-about-the-city-a-mysterious-waif-bellevue-shelters-a-girl-of.html "IN AND ABOUT THE CITY; A MYSTERIOUS WAIF. BELLEVUE SHELTERS A GIRL OF WHOM NOTHING IS KNOWN."]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. September 26, 1887.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dlib.nyu.edu/undercover/and-about-city-mysterious-waif-unsigned-new-york-times "In and About the City: A Mysterious Waif"]. Undercover Reporting. [[New York University]]. Retrieved January 9, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Committed to the asylum, Bly experienced the deplorable conditions firsthand. The food consisted of gruel broth, spoiled beef, bread that was little more than dried dough, and dirty undrinkable water. The dangerous patients were tied together with ropes. The patients were made to sit for much of each day on hard benches with scant protection from the cold. Waste was all around the eating places. Rats crawled all around the hospital. The bathwater was frigid and buckets of it were poured over their heads. The nurses behaved obnoxiously and abusively, telling the patients to shut up, and beating them if they did not. Speaking with her fellow patients, Bly was convinced that some were as "sane" as she was. On the effect of her experiences, she wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What, excepting torture, would produce insanity quicker than this treatment? Here is a class of women sent to be cured. I would like the expert physicians who are condemning me for my action, which has proven their ability, to take a perfectly sane and healthy woman, shut her up and make her sit from 6 a.m. until 8 p.m. on straight-back benches, do not allow her to talk or move during these hours, give her no reading and let her know nothing of the world or its doings, give her bad food and harsh treatment, and see how long it will take to make her insane. Two months would make her a mental and physical wreck.&lt;ref name=Bly1887/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


A particularly memorable experience for Nellie were the baths that the patients received. The patients were washed and roughly scrubbed with the same bath water as many of the other women. The bath water was rarely changed, and even when it was filthy and eventually changed, the asylum staff did not scrub or clean out the bath. The water was merely replaced and the next patient thrown in. The patients also shared bath towels, some healthy patients even drying off with a towel just used by another patient with a skin inflammation or boils and cuts. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/bly/madhouse/madhouse.html|title=Ten Days in a Mad-House|website=digital.library.upenn.edu|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;Nellie recalled the bathing ritual with trepidation, stating: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"My teeth chattered and my limbs were goose-fleshed and blue with cold. Suddenly I got, one after the other, three buckets of water over my head—ice-cold water, too—into my eyes, my ears, my nose and my mouth."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After ten days, the asylum released Bly at ''The World''{{'}}s behest. Her report, published in ''The World'' and later released as a book, caused a sensation and brought her lasting fame.

==Reception==
The question in hand was how Nellie managed to convince professionals of her insanity in the first place. As revealed in her first hand account, "Ten Days in a Madhouse", Nellie spoke on how the main physician that performed her examination was more focused on the attractive nurse that was assisting the examination than with Nellie herself. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/bly/madhouse/madhouse.html|title=Ten Days in a Mad-House|website=digital.library.upenn.edu|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;While physicians and staff worked to explain how she had deceived so many professionals, Bly's report prompted a [[grand jury]] to launch its [http://dlib.nyu.edu/undercover/sites/dlib.nyu.edu.undercover/files/documents/uploads/editors/Nellie-Bly-Led-the-Way.pdf own investigation] with Bly assisting. The jury's report resulted in an $850,000 increase in the budget of the Department of Public Charities and Corrections. The grand jury also ensured that future examinations were more thorough such that only the seriously ill were committed to the asylum.

==Film adaptation==
An independent film version of ''[[10 Days in a Madhouse]]'', written and directed by [[Timothy Hines]], starring [[Caroline Barry]], [[Christopher Lambert]], [[Kelly Le Brock]] and Julia Chantrey, was released in [[2015 in film|2015]] from Pendragon Pictures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3453052/ ''10 Days in a Mad House''], IMDb page.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.10daysinamadhouse.com/ ''10 Days in a Mad House''] official website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://filmfiles.tv/studies-women-still-struggle-in-male-dominated-film-industry/'' STUDIES: Women still struggle in male-dominated film industry''], Tom Henderson, Filmfiles.tv. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402131257/http://filmfiles.tv/studies-women-still-struggle-in-male-dominated-film-industry/ |date=2015-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stage adaptation==
In March, 2018 a stage version of Ten Days in a Madhouse, written and directed by Tony Vezner was produced at Concordia University in Irvine, California.

'''The Doctor''', an '''Emergency Medical Hologram Mark I''' (or '''EMH''' for short), is a fictional character from the television series ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', played by actor [[Robert Picardo]]. The character also appeared in ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'', as well as the now-closed [[Star Trek: The Experience]] amusement exhibition at the [[Las Vegas Hilton]]. He is the "Chief Medical Officer".

==Fictional character biography==
The Doctor began his service on the [[USS Voyager (NCC-74656)|USS ''Voyager'']] as the standard Emergency Medical [[Hologram]] built into almost every newer [[Starfleet]] ship's [[sickbay]]. The EMH is for use should the ship's doctor be incapacitated. In the series' first episode, ''Voyager''{{'}}s chief medical officer, along with his nurse, was killed, necessitating extended use of the EMH. The EMH eventually developed his own personality, although he generally maintained his acerbic wit, and irritating "version one" bedside manner. As he was originally intended as a temporary medical backup system, not as a [[digital life form]], ''Voyager''{{'}}s journey strains his programming to some limits. His cohorts were [[Kes (Star Trek)|Kes]] and [[Tom Paris]], both of whom functioned as nurses.

Attempting to develop a realistic personality, The Doctor not only manufactured a holographic family,&lt;ref name="Real Life"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Real Life|episodelink=Real Life (Star Trek: Voyager)|series=Star Trek: Voyager |serieslink=Star Trek: Voyager|season=3|number=22|network=[[UPN]]|airdate=April 23, 1997|credits=Writers: [[Harry Kloor|Harry 'Doc' Kloor]] and [[Jeri Taylor]]; Director: [[Anson Williams]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; he had an increasing number of other "human" experiences. This resulted in The Doctor's program evolving to become more lifelike, with emotions and ambitions. He developed meaningful and complex [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] with many members of the ship's crew. The Doctor also developed talents as a [[playwright]], artist, and photographer, and even became a [[connoisseur]] of [[opera]]. He has had multiple other experiences with "family", including having had a son with a "roommate" while trapped on a planet for 3 years. During the episode, "Blink Of An Eye", he asked an associate to inquire further on his progeny.&lt;ref name="Blink Of An Eye"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Blink Of An Eye|episodelink=Blink Of An Eye (Star Trek: Voyager)|series=Star Trek: Voyager |serieslink=Star Trek: Voyager|season=6|number=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recurring theme was the ethical aspects of an artificial, yet apparently sentient, being. In "[[Latent Image (Star Trek: Voyager)|Latent Image]]" treating two patients with an equal chance of survival, with only enough time to treat one, The Doctor chose Harry Kim, a friend. The other patient, Ensign Jetal, died. The Doctor was overwhelmed with guilt, believing that his friendship influenced his choice. When the stress nearly led to his program breaking down, Captain Janeway had his memories of these events deleted. When The Doctor later discovered clues as to what had happened, Captain Janeway was convinced by him and others that he had a right to learn to come to grips with the guilt in the manner of any other sentient being rather than be treated merely as a defective piece of equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Latent Image|episodelink=Latent Image (Star Trek: Voyager)|series=Star Trek: Voyager|serieslink=Star Trek: Voyager|season=5|number=11|airdate=January 20, 1999|network=[[UPN]]|credits=Writers: [[Eileen Connors]] and [[Joe Menosky]]; Director: [[Mike Vejar]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Doctor submitted a holonovel titled ''Photons Be Free'' to a publisher on Earth, detailing the manner in which holograms were sometimes treated by Starfleet. His characters were closely based on ''Voyager''{{'}}s crew, but exaggerated to appear more intense and vicious, creating fears among the crew their reputations would be ruined. [[Tom Paris]] convinced The Doctor to make adjustments without sacrificing his theme. The Doctor lacked legal rights as [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] law did not classify him as a "sentient being". Thus he was forbidden to make any subsequent changes to the holonovel. [[Kathryn Janeway|Captain Janeway]]'s efforts resulted in The Doctor being accorded the status of "artist", (though not a "person"). This permitted him to rewrite the novel. Four months later, it was known throughout the [[Alpha Quadrant]] as a very thought-provoking piece of work. Several other EMHs, now relegated to mining duty, experienced the novel.

[[File:Please State the Nature of the Medical Emergency.ogg|thumb|Robert Picardo: "Please state the nature of the medical emergency."]]
The Doctor's standard greeting was "Please state the nature of the medical emergency" when activated, though later modified to say whatever he chose. He was later given the ability to activate and deactivate himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Jetrel|episodelink=Jetrel|series=Star Trek: Voyager|serieslink=Star Trek: Voyager|season=1|number=15|network=[[UPN]]|airdate=May 15, 1995|credits=Writers: [[Jack Klein (writer)|Jack Klein]], [[Karen Klein (writer)|Karen Klein]], and [[Kenneth Biller]]; Director: [[Kim Friedman]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Doctor later acquired a mobile holographic emitter from the 29th century.&lt;ref name="Future's End"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Future's End, Part I|episodelink=Future's End|series=Star Trek: Voyager|serieslink=Star Trek: Voyager|season=3|number=8|date=November 6, 1996|network=[[UPN]]|credits=Writers: [[Brannon Braga]] and [[Joe Menosky]], Director: [[David Livingston]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although he had previously been confined to [[Sickbay]] or the [[Holodeck]], the mobile emitter allowed The Doctor to move about freely, making him ideal for missions where the environment would be harmful or otherwise fatal to the crew. In one notable incident, when an away team was trapped on a radioactive planet, The Doctor was able to infiltrate the people and almost single-handedly rescue the team because, as he pointed out, being a hologram renders him immune to the radiation, stating that "being a hologram does have its advantages."

The Doctor's programming evolved from his first romance, Dr. Denara Pel, to the point where he fell in love with [[Seven of Nine]], though she did not reciprocate. In an alternate future episode, "[[Endgame (Star Trek: Voyager)|Endgame]]", The Doctor finally adopts a name (see below) and marries a human female named Lana.

In the final episode of ''Star Trek: Voyager'', a future version of Janeway also informs him of his later invention of a device known as a 'synaptic transceiver', something that fascinates The Doctor; he's cut off by the 'present' Janeway, who is abiding by the Temporal Prime Directive, before he can learn more.

=== Emergency Command Hologram ===
The "Emergency Command Hologram", aka "ECH", is first coined by The Doctor in the episode "[[Tinker, Tenor, Doctor, Spy]]", in which he creates a program which allows him to [[daydream]].

In these grandiose daydreams, The Doctor adds routines which allow him to take command of ''Voyager'' in the event of the command crew being disabled.

A dramatic morph transformation occurs changing his uniform from medical blue to command red, his rank pips subsequently appearing. The daydreams are picked up by a [[Hierarchy (Star Trek)|Hierarchy]] vessel in a nearby [[nebula]] and believed to be real events.

Once the crew discover that The Doctor is daydreaming they use the holodeck to view his dreams, including the one expressing his desire to be an Emergency Command Hologram. [[Kathryn Janeway|Captain Janeway]] promises to consider his proposal.

The Doctor soon gets the opportunity to live out his daydreams as, with the assistance of the crew, he pretends to be in charge to neutralize a war fleet.

The ECH made its debut the following season in "[[Workforce (Star Trek: Voyager)|Workforce]]", in which after an incident with a subspace mine that releases a great amount of [[tetryon]] radiation, the crew is forced to abandon ship. To keep the ship moving The Doctor takes over the command functions.

In the episode "[[Renaissance Man (Star Trek: Voyager)|Renaissance Man]]", against the wishes of the crew, The Doctor uses his ECH program to eject the [[warp core]].

===Backup copies===
The Doctor's program required a custom-built photonic processor, and Starfleet outfitted ''Voyager'' with only two. This hardware itself also could not be replicated, hence the Doctor could not be easily backed up, restored, or copied.

''Voyager'''s computers could not help run his photonic program, and could not contain a usable backup of its image. The Doctor's entire program used 50 million gigaquads - episodes "[[Lifesigns (Star Trek: Voyager)|Lifesigns]]" and "[[The Swarm (Star Trek: Voyager)|The Swarm]]" mention these limitations. The episode "[[Living Witness]]" depicts a future Delta Quadrant civilization building a museum around ''Voyager'' artifacts, including its redundant EMH photonic processor.

===Name===
A recurring theme in the Doctor's life was his lack of a proper name. Starfleet did not assign a name to him, and initially the Doctor claimed that he did not want one until the episode “Eye of the Needle,” when he asks Kes to be given a name. He later adopted such names as 'Schweitzer'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Heroes and Demons|episodelink=Heroes and Demons|series=Star Trek: Voyager|serieslink=Star Trek: Voyager|season=1|number=12|airdate=April 12, 1995|network=[[UPN]]|credits=Writers: [[Naren Shankar]]; Director: [[Les Landau]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (after [[Albert Schweitzer]]), ‘Shmullus’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Lifesigns|episodelink=Lifesigns (Star Trek: Voyager)|series=Star Trek: Voyager|serieslink=Star Trek: Voyager|season=2|number=19|airdate=February 6, 1996|network=[[UPN]]|credits=Writers: [[Kenneth Biller]]; Director: [[Cliff Bole]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (by [[Vidiian]] patient Dr. Denara Pel), ‘Van Gogh,’ ‘Kenneth,‘&lt;ref name="Real Life"/&gt; ‘Jones’ and several others. His friends suggest the famous historical Earth doctors "[[Galen]]" and "[[Benjamin Spock|Spock]]". The captioned dialog of early episodes, and early promotional material for the series premiere, referred to him as ‘Dr. Zimmerman,’ after his creator [[Lewis Zimmerman]]. The Doctor is ultimately referred to as simply "The Doctor" and addressed as "Doctor", which he answers to without concern, and the issue of the Doctor's name virtually disappears over the course of the series. However, in the [[Endgame (Star Trek: Voyager)|series finale]], in an alternate future timeline,  the Doctor has finally chosen the name "Joe", after his new wife's grandfather (Tom Paris remarks that "it took you ''33 years'' to come up with "''Joe''"?").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Endgame, Part I|episodelink=Endgame (Star Trek: Voyager)|series=Star Trek: Voyager|serieslink=Star Trek: Voyager|season=7|number=25|airdate=May 23, 2001|network=[[UPN]]|credits=Writers: [[Kenneth Biller]], [[Robert Doherty (writer)|Robert Doherty]], [[Rick Berman]], [[Brannon Braga]]; Director: [[Allan Kroeker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Before the arrival of the mobile emitter, The Doctor's holo-program was confined to Sickbay, holodecks, and other areas equipped with holographic systems.&lt;ref name="Future's End"/&gt;

Depending on the availability of suitable holographic patterns and the capacity of his pattern buffers, The Doctor can alter his appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Renaissance Man|episodelink=Renaissance Man (Star Trek: Voyager)|series=Star Trek: Voyager|serieslink=Star Trek: Voyager|season=7|number=24|airdate=May 16, 2001|network=[[UPN]]|credits=Writers: [[Mike Sussman (TV series writer/producer)|Mike Sussman]] and [[Phyllis Strong]]; Director: [[Mike Vejar]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Doctor is also able to download his program and personality subroutines into a humanoid with Borg implants, indirectly 'possessing' that individual and gaining control over its 'host' body. Such is the case when he was forced to hide within the body of [[Seven of Nine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Body and Soul|episodelink=Body and Soul (Star Trek: Voyager)|series=Star Trek: Voyager|serieslink=Star Trek: Voyager|season=7|number=7|airdate=November 11, 2000|network=[[UPN]]|credits=Writers: [[Eric A. Morris|Eric Morris]], [[Mike Sussman (TV series writer/producer)|Mike Sussman]], [[Michael Taylor (screenwriter)|Michael Taylor]] and [[Phyllis Strong]]; Director: [[Robert Duncan McNeill]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergency Medical Hologram==
The EMH is a holographic computer program designed to treat patients during emergency situations, or when the regular medical staff is unavailable or incapacitated. EMHs are a standard feature onboard all [[Starfleet]] ships, but they are there only to supplement the living medical crew, not replace it. Programmed with all current Starfleet medical knowledge, The Doctor and all Mark I programs are equipped with the knowledge and mannerisms of historic Federation doctors, as well as the physical appearance of their programmer Dr. Lewis Zimmerman. Zimmerman, along with the EMH, appeared in the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episode "[[Doctor Bashir, I Presume?]]", in which the former was in the process of trying to upgrade Starfleet's EMH programs to LMH, i.e. Long-term Medical Hologram, status.

There has been only one update to the Mark I seen on screen, the Mark II played by [[Andy Dick]] in the episode "[[Message in a Bottle (Star Trek: Voyager)|Message in a Bottle]]", which supposedly had a "better" bedside manner than the Mark I, as well as possibly some updated medical information.  However, later episodes mention that further versions of the EMH exist.

===''Enterprise''-E EMH===
Picardo had a minor role in the movie ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'', where he played the emergency medical hologram of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E)|USS ''Enterprise''-E]].  Doctor [[Beverly Crusher]] activates him, albeit reluctantly, as a means of distracting the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] while she and other crew members escape from the besieged sickbay. He replies, "I'm a doctor, not a doorstop", an homage to [[Leonard McCoy|Doctor McCoy]]'s catchphrase line "[[Leonard McCoy#I'm a doctor|I'm a doctor, not a ...]]" (The Doctor also made this reference several other times, on ''Voyager''.) Nevertheless, when the Borg do break in, he does attempt to distract them by noting that Borg implants can cause skin irritation and offering to prescribe an [[analgesic]] cream. Although the Borg would be unable to harm or assimilate him, he still appears intimidated as they advance upon him. Another EMH appeared in the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episode "[[Doctor Bashir I Presume]]".

His reference to an analgesic cream in this scene was reprised in the PC video game ''[[Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force]]''.

==Casting==
Picardo initially auditioned for [[Neelix]]. Despite [[Ethan Phillips]] getting the part, Picardo was asked by the producers to come back and audition for The Doctor — something that shocked him, because usually actors would be passed over completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/community/chat/archive/transcript/1245.html |work=[http://www.startrek.com/ Star Trek Official Site] |publisher=StarTrek.com |title=Robert Picardo ("The Doctor" - VOY) |date=May 6, 2002 |quote=When I didn't get the part, the producers shocked me by asking me to reconsider The Doctor. Usually in TV, when you have tested for one role, they simply throw you into the ash can and move on to another actor. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709203940/http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/community/chat/archive/transcript/1245.html |archivedate=July 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his audition for the role of The Doctor, Picardo was asked only to say, "Somebody forgot to terminate my program." However, he then [[wikt:ad lib#Verb|ad lib]]bed, "I'm a doctor, not a nightlight!" (Picardo was initially afraid that he may have ruined his chances—ad libbing, he explained, was something that one just "did not do" in an audition.)

The '''New York NRT Distribution Program''' is a program that provides smokers with a way to help them quit their smoking habits. This article focuses on the aid of helping smokers fight their battle. [[Nicotine patch]] and [[Nicotine gum]] are distributed for free in the streets of NYC or on the internet. The program offers a "'quit coach'" as a person to converse with to help increase chances of quitting. [[Nicotine replacement therapy|NRT]] works as a program of an array of [[Smoking cessation]]s and support material helping to beat the addiction. The slogan used is "'Don't be a heart attack waiting to happen'".

== Nicotine addiction ==
Nicotine patches or gum may double the chances of quitting. It works by helping take away the nicotine withdrawal sensations. This program offers these [[Smoking cessation]]s at no price to encourage people to quit smoking. To see if a person is eligible for a free starters kit, he/she must submit an application to kick off starting the end of smoking. "'The New York State Smokers' Quitline'" offers its program for everyone as a confidential counseling service along with counseling and cessation-related services to patients who use tobacco products. Once applied, the patient will receive a follow-up call. Patients will receive a Stop-Smoking or Stop-Smokeless-Tobacco packet in the mail with information fit for the specific person and a list of local [https://www.nysmokefree.com/PageView.aspx?P=85&amp;P1=8520 programs]. A form of information will be sent back to the health care provider or the patients tobacco-use status. The patient can be referred to the New York State Smokers' Quitline as often as they need to be referred. There is a 24/7 online quit coach chat room called "'Breathe'" for those who need aid at that very moment.

== History ==
The quitline features employer champions who provide employee cessation benefits and support to others. The featured champion is [http://nysmokefree.com/PageView.aspx?P=70&amp;l=E%20 Dr. James L. Schuppert] of Corning. According to the [[Public Health Service]], the "'Clinical Practice Guideline'" ([[Clinical practice guideline|CPG]]) is required for this program. 1.

== Benefits ==
This program offers a good support system to the people in this world that can't just say they have a smoking addiction. People understand the harms of a [[nicotine addiction]] but are not willing to take the steps to getting better on their own. They live in denial that an addiction lives within them and this program allows people the mental and tangible support to make the addiction a reality. It offers a hotline to talk about how the smoking has become out of hand and an assessment test to see how far the addiction has come. It helps review what did and did not work on previous attempts of quitting. It helps people get ready and do anything BUT smoke. Negative thinking can get in a persons way and block their sense of reality so they enforce you to stay positive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nysmokefree.com/PageView.aspx?P=85&amp;l=E NYsmokefree] page view.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the phone call session is over and the [[nicotine patch]] or [[nicotine gum]] was sent, the program send an assessment to the persons primary physician to continue helping the patient overcome the battle. The program is a reliable way to help people get out of their addiction and slowly move on. The provide tools to help you quit because it is never too late.

== Criticism ==
When people with a history of depression stop smoking, there are depressive symptoms or actual depression that may result from this. This can end up being harmful for the patient. The patient may have been better or by slowly coming off the addiction and may not have been seen in the assessment. Another concern relates to the fact that people may become addicted to the NRT product and turn back to tobacco products to save money. The NRT program is a luxury. It has become a luxury to quit. And although this program allows a free starters kit, the whole point of quitting is the long term struggle and being able to face it. Typically, the cost of NRT lasting seven days is up to expensive over the counter, whether gum or patch, as against cigarettes.

[[Nicotine]] itself has not been shown to be cancerous, but it has been suggested that it may cause more harmful conditions for cancer to grow. There is also always a chance that when using NRT products it is easy to become addicted to those products in the place of the tobacco. Generally it is said and argued that NRT products are safer than smoking tobacco but, there are also a lot of important concerns for the safety of the children and infants when the mother uses any sort of NRT.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4276">The '''Tobacco Products Control Act''' was introduced in [[South Africa]] in 1993, where [[smoking]] has been rated the second highest health concern, after HIV/AIDS. 

This act has been amended several time during the past decade and today South Africa has some of the strictest tobacco control measures ever adopted by the government of a developing country. It is estimated that cigarette consumption has fallen dramatically since the early 1990s while the percentage of adult smokers in the country has dropped from 32 to 26.5 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-5463-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html South Africa's Winning Tobacco Control Strategy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Tobacco Products Control Act of 1993 ==
The [[South African Government]] passed the first Tobacco Products Control Act in 1993 and started implementing the act in 1995. The act regulated smoking in public areas and prohibited tobacco sales to people under the age of 16. Some aspects of [[tobacco advertising]] were also regulated for example labelling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acts.co.za/tobacco-products-control-act-1993/index.html Tobacco Products Control Act 1993&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Tobacco Products Control Amendment Act - 1999 ==
The 1993 act was not considered to be comprehensive enough and the Tobacco Products Control Amendment Act was passed in 1999. This act bans all advertising and promotion of [[tobacco]] products, including [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]] and free distribution of tobacco products. The act also restricts smoking in public places which includes the workplace, restaurants and bars and public transport. The act also stipulates penalties for transgressors of the law, and specifies the maximum permissible levels of [[tar]] and [[nicotine]]. The regulations were implemented in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multinationalmonitor.org/mm2001/01jan-feb/corp8.html multinationalmonitor.org]; The Great South African Smokeout, Anna White, 2001&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Tobacco Products Control Amendment Act - 2007 ==
The government proposed further amendments to the bill in 2007 which will seek to deal with new practices designed to circumvent the provisions of the Act. These amendments will also aim to bring the current law into [[Compliance (regulation)|compliance]] with the [[World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]] (FCTC). This framework has been [[ratified]] by the South African government.

The former minister Madlala-Routledge was quoted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Bill further proposes a number of amendments to the Act, which are designed to promote health and prevent diseases. The main provisions of the Bill are to:
* amend the current Act so as to strengthen the sections which prohibit advertising, promotion and sponsorship
* remove misleading package descriptors like "light" and "mild"
* control the ingredients in and emissions from tobacco products
* increase penalties for breaking the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polity.org.za/article.php?a_id=106646 polity.org.za]; Madlala-Routledge: Tobacco Products Control Amendment Bill (29/03/2007)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== The Tobacco Products Control Amendment Act, 2008 ==
The act was amended by Act 36 of 2008 with these changes:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/31790_23.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* Changes the definitions of advertising
* specifically includes regulation of importers

Training inputs have been provided to all village health workers of TF.

TF has also been enlisted to provide training to members of Village Health and Sanitation Committees of Village Gram Panchayats of all the villages of Umreth, Anklav and Anand talukas of Anand District and Balasinor and Virpur talukas of Kheda District during the financial year 08-09. The Gujarat state government has provided grants for this project of around Rs.1100,000 (eleven lakhs or one million one hundred thousand rupees).

Apart from community health, TF also has programs for children, (Balwadi program) and for livelihood enhancement of women (handicrafts). TF also has organised anti tobacco campaigns in its program villages.

The Chairperson of the National Dairy Development Board, Dr.(Ms) Amrita Patel assessed the organisation thus  in an international workshop " Tribhuvandas Foundation, which is Asia’s largest NGO, works in over 600 villages in the State in the field of maternal and infant care. What is unique about the programme of the Foundation is that it rides on the back of milk. It is the village milk co-operative that appoints a village health worker and pays an honorarium to the village health worker to undertake the work. So it is milk paying for health." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilri.org/InfoServ/Webpub/fulldocs/South_South/Ch03.htm#TopOfPage&lt;/ref&gt;
