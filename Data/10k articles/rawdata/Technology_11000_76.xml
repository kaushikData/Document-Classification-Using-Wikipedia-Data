'''APC by Schneider Electric''', formerly known as '''American Power Conversion Corporation''', is a manufacturer of uninterruptible power supplies, electronics peripherals and data center products.

In 2007, [[Schneider Electric]] acquired APC and combined it with MGE UPS Systems to form Schneider Electric's Critical Power &amp; Cooling Services Business Unit, which recorded 2007 revenue of $3.5 billion (EUR 2.4 billion) and employed 12,000 people worldwide. Until February 2007, when it was acquired, it had been a member of the [[S&amp;P 500]] list of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States. Schneider Electric, with 113,900 employees and operations in 102 countries, had 2008 annual sales of $26 billion (EUR 18.3 billion).

In 2011 APC by Schneider Electric became a product brand only, while the company was rebranded as the IT Business Unit of Schneider Electric.

== History ==
APC was founded in 1981 by three [[MIT]] [[Lincoln Lab]] electronic power engineers. Originally, the engineers focused on [[solar power]] research and development. When government funding for their research dried up, APC shifted its focus to power protection by introducing its first [[Uninterruptible power supply|UPS]] in 1984.

In July 1988, APC became a publicly held company, traded on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker symbol APCC.  In February 2007, American Power Conversion was delisted from the NASDAQ exchange, and replaced in the [[S&amp;P 500]] Index by [[Hudson City Bancorp]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

=== Acquisition by Schneider ===
[[Schneider Electric]] announced its acquisition of APC on October 30, 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://wib-pub.schneider-electric.com/publicprogram/corp/corp_elibrary.nsf/0/27687DF0E6EA02AE8525721700223925/$file/apc_presentation.pdf Acquisition presentation document]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705065643/http://wib-pub.schneider-electric.com/publicprogram/corp/corp_elibrary.nsf/0/27687DF0E6EA02AE8525721700223925/%24file/apc_presentation.pdf|date=July 5, 2007}}, [http://www.schneider-electric.com/wps/portal/corp/kcxml/04_Sj9SPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Y_QjzKL94w39PcFSZnFW8ZbuupHogu5IIR8PfJzU_WDUvP0vfUD9AtyQyPKHR0VAU8a-sg!/delta/base64xml/L3dJdyEvd0ZNQUFzQUMvNElVRS82X0lfMjJV?toservice=WIBNW_5008_CORP&amp;Language=en&amp;fromservice=AUTON_5014_CORP&amp;&amp;idContent=8f1ca176ec24e64e8525721700214ce1&amp;docType=corp_release_presse&amp;wibCountryDB=CORP]

&lt;/ref&gt; Late in 2007 [[Eaton Corporation|Eaton Powerware]] bought the MGE Office Protection Systems division of Schneider.

== Product lines ==
Today,{{When |date=June 2013}} the company focuses its efforts on four application areas: 
* Home/home office
* Business networks
* Access provider networks
* Data centers and facilities

===Symmetra===
APC Symmetra LX is a line of [[uninterruptible power supply]] products, aimed at [[Computer network|network]] and [[Server (computing)|server]] applications. Symmetras come in power configurations ranging from 4&amp;nbsp;kVA to 16&amp;nbsp;kVA. Symmetras are built for use in a [[data center]], (in a [[19-inch rack]] for example). They include features such as integrated manageability, hot-swappability, user replaceable power, battery and intelligence modules. Typical applications include web and other application servers, IP based and traditional PBX voice solutions, and enterprise type network switches.

APC Symmetra PX1 (THOR 20-80 KVA) is a line of Uninterruptible Power Supply Products aimed at the small, medium market of data servers rooms. With user changeable Power Modules, Battery Modules, and 24/7 Hotline Support which typically can diagnose a problem via telephone call and/or direct connection access of its SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) Card, have become "THE LEGENDARY RELIABILITY" Leader in the UPS Marketplace with a demonstrative
99.4% Online Uptime. This platform has become the most stable, modular redundancy (no hard failure faults to turn off unit in event of a module failure), and placed itself firmly in the hearts of all IT Business Executives at all levels.

APC's signature product is InfraStruXure.{{Citation needed |date= June 2013}}

=== Smart-UPS ===
{{Main|APC Smart-UPS}}

APC Smart-UPS is a line of smaller units intended for home and office use, available as floor-standing and rackmount versions.  With the exception of the Smart-UPS Online series (SURT and SRT models), Smart-UPS units are [[Uninterruptible power supply#Line-interactive|line-interactive]] UPS systems, running their outputs off the inverters only when the grid power is unavailable.

===PowerChute===
PowerChute is a [[computer program]] by APC used to control the uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) the company produces. It provides unattended shutdown of [[Server (computing)|servers]] and [[workstation]]s in the event of an extended [[power outage]]. It also monitors and logs the UPS status. Some versions with reduced functionality are shipped together with the UPS units sold by APC, while other versions have to be bought separately.

PowerChute Business Edition requires servers to be connected via [[serial port]] or [[USB]] to the monitored Smart-UPS equipment.  It provides UPS management and safe server shutdown for up to 25 servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apc.com/products/family/index.cfm?id=125|title=PowerChute Business Edition ‚Äì UPS Energy Management Software - APC|publisher=|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  UPS Network Management Cards made by APC are enabling UPS management, by directly connecting the UPS to the network with its own IP address, avoiding dependence or the need for a server, which is particularly useful in wiring closets where frequently no servers are present. PowerChute Network Shutdown, together with the UPS Network Management Card, enables safe server shutdown by communicating over a network to any network-enabled APC Smart-UPS (those that contain an UPS network management card).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apc.com/products/family/index.cfm?id=127|title=PowerChute Network Shutdown ‚Äì Network Power Management Software - APC|publisher=|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Air showers''' are specialized enclosed [[antechamber]]s which are incorporated as entryways of [[cleanroom]]s and other controlled environments to reduce particle [[contamination control|contamination]].&lt;ref name=cosgrove2003&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alnmag.com/article/2002/12/how-do-air-showers-fit-contamination-reduction-plan|last=Cosgrove|first=Chris K.|date=2003-01-01|title=How Do Air Showers Fit Into A Contamination Reduction Plan?|publisher=Advantage Business Media|accessdate=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Air showers utilize high-pressure, [[HEPA]]- or [[Ultra-low particulate air|ULPA]]-[[air filter|filter]]ed air to remove dust, fibrous [[Lint (material)|lint]] and other contaminants from personnel or object surfaces. The forceful "cleansing" of surfaces prior to entering clean environments reduces the number of airborne particulates introduced.&lt;ref name=cosgrove2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=welker2006&gt;{{cite book|last1= Welker|first1=Roger W.|last2=Nagarajan|first2=R.|last3=Newberg|first3=Carl E.|publicationdate=2005-10-04|title=Contamination and ESD Control in High Technology Manufacturing|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|place=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-471-41452-0|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Contamination_and_ESD_Control_in_High_Te.html?id=CP4hdPlAmzYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When properly incorporated into cleanroom design, air showers provide an [[international organization for standardization|ISO]]-classified transition [[vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]] to ensure the cleanliness of the classified cleanroom . Air showers are typically placed between a gowning area and cleanroom; after workers don appropriate garb and [[personal protective equipment]], they enter the shower so that the pressurized air nozzles remove any residual particles from [[coveralls]]. Once the program cycle is complete, users exit out through a second door, into the cleanroom. Air showers (or air tunnels) may also be placed between cleanrooms of different ISO ratings.&lt;ref name=welker2006 /&gt;

==Design and functionality==
Air showers are generally constructed from cleanroom-compatible [[stainless steel|steel]] or [[plastic]] materials and feature electronically-powered [[centrifugal fan|blower]]s, filters and high-pressure [[jet nozzle]]s, the latter being incorporated into the walls and ceiling of the chamber. &lt;ref name=loughran2015&gt;{{cite book|last1= Loughran|first1= Timothy M.|last2=Shea|first2= Michael J.|year=2015-02-16|title=The Effectiveness of Air Showers in the Contamination Control Process|publisher= Solid State Technology |date= |website=Solid State Technology|accessdate=2016-11-15|url=http://electroiq.com/blog/1996/04/the-effectiveness-of-air-showers-in-the-contamination-control-process/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Air, at velocities of 3,000 to 7,000 feet-per-minute (FPM), continuously streams from the jet nozzles for 30-45 seconds, effectively removing loose [[particulate matter]].&lt;ref name=ottney1996&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ottney|first1=Thomas C|date=1996-09-01|journal=Metal Finishing|title=Air Showers Reduce Lint Defects|publisher=Science Direct|volume=97|issue=5|pages=402-406|accessdate=2016-11-13|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0026057600804407|doi=10.1016/S0026-0576(00)80440-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personnel inside the enclosure will lift their arms and turn their bodies for uniform exposure to the air streams, a procedure usually specified in [[protocol (science)|protocol]]. Air currents from the jets create [[shear_stress#Shear_stress_in_fluids|shear]]ing and [[Fluid dynamics|flapping]] forces, which lift and remove contaminants from both flat surfaces and the creases of garments.&lt;ref name=ottney1996 /&gt; [[air filter#Filter_classes|HEPA filtration]] within the air shower is capable of removing 99.97% of particles greater than 0.3[[micrometer|¬µm]] diameter.&lt;ref name=asme2003&gt;{{cite book|publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers|title=ASME AG-1a-2004: addenda to ASME AG-1-2003, Code on Nuclear Air and Gas Treatment|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Air is channeled within the air shower using a closed-loop system, where it is continuously re-circulated. Air is forced through a motorized filter/blower module into a large [[plenum chamber|plenum]], then into the shower through jet nozzles. Particle-laden, contaminated air is routed out of the shower compartment through floor [[duct (flow)|vent]]s and returned to the filtration unit. This process ensures that only decontaminated air is used to remove particulates from personnel and other equipment, such as supply carts.  

Often, air showers are equipped with [[air ionizer]]s to reduce [[static electricity]], as large volumes of high-velocity air create [[electric charges]]. Since laboratory equipment, electronic [[measuring instrument]]s and many hi-tech manufactured goods can often be damaged by [[electrostatic discharge]], ionizers are essential in rendering material surfaces electrically neutral prior to entering the cleanroom.&lt;ref name=welker2006 /&gt;

==Safety==
[[interlock (engineering)|Interlocking mechanism]]s are a common air shower feature to prevent both exits from being opened simultaneously, which would allow outside air to enter a tightly controlled environment. This requires occupants to stay inside until the decontamination cycle has completed. For this reason, safety features such as [[kill switch|emergency stop]]s are required by most safety administrations. Alternatively, the air shower may consist of a long [[tunnel]] not equipped with doors; personnel slowly walk through to reach the controlled area.&lt;ref name=welker2006 /&gt;  Air handling equipment creates an isolated atmosphere using [[pressure measurement|pressure differentials]] to create fluid boundaries between the inner and outer environments.

'''The Australian Institute of Building'''(AIB) is a [[professional society]] founded in 1951, incorporated in 1955 and granted a [[Royal Charter]] in 1969. The Institute is an association of building professionals, associate professionals and technicians engaged in building practice, teaching, or research throughout Australia and overseas.  It has chapter offices in Hong Kong and Singapore and had a chapter office in New Zealand until the formation of the New Zealand Institute of Building in 1984.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.aib.org.au/about/AIB-History.htm AIB History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122094659/http://www.aib.org.au/about/AIB-History.htm |date=November 22, 2008 }}, www.aib.org.au&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission and History==

Serving building professionals, the AIB has helped create standards for professional competency and regulation of education standards for the various educational programs related to its mission.  It has played the lead role in the establishment of all building and construction management undergraduate programs offered by Australian universities.

The mission of AIB is to be a leading body of focus for the building industry, valued for its services to its members, reflecting its ideals for education, standards and ethics and the source of authoritative and visionary comment on behalf of professionals in the industry. Its objectives are: to promote excellence in the construction of buildings and just and honourable practices in the conduct of business; to advance the study of Building and all kindred matters, arts and sciences; to encourage the friendly exchange between members of knowledge in practical, technical and ethical subjects; and to uphold the dignity of the profession of Building and the status of the Institute.

Following World War II the building industry was confronted with a huge programme of civil and commercial building. This called for improved productivity, more intelligent use of resources available and the development of new techniques and new material. Leaders of the industry appreciated that building was developing from empirical craft processes to a technological discipline spanning physical sciences and involving construction techniques which were unknown in the early part of the 20th century. Development in the science of environment and building services had also added a new dimension to building technology.

As building involved investment of public and private capital to a greater extent than any other commodity, rational, economic and efficient working was essential. Skill in the management of building work is as important as the technology itself. A trend to higher educational standards and a more positive approach to training executive and technical staff of Building organisations was clearly required.

The effect of this impact on the building industry was to highlight the need for a professional body to promote efficiency and establish a high standard of technological education for those engaged on the construction side of the industry.

A 'Committee of Investigation' was set up in 1947 by a convention called by the then Master Builders' Federation of Australia (MBFA) which, although firmly established since 1890, was not acceptable as a professional body because it was an employers' organisation. There was agreement that an Institute should be constituted on professional lines to represent the construction side of the building industry, and both the [[Royal Australian Institute of Architects]] (RAIA) and the Institution of Engineers Australia (IEAust) agreed to assist in selecting the foundation membership.

The Australian Institute of Builders was established in 1951 with a foundation membership determined by a selection committee in each state, comprising two representatives of the RAIA, one representative of the IEAust and two representatives of the MBFA. The Foundation Members also included members of the Building Diplomats Association of NSW, associated with the Sydney Technical College.

On 23 November 1951 the Foundation Dinner was held in Sydney and the then Mr [[Robert Menzies]], Prime Minister of [[Australia]], was presented with a Certificate of Honorary Membership.  The Institute was incorporated on 15 November 1955, granted Armorial Bearings on 20 August 1960 and incorporated by [[Royal Charter]] on 7 October 1969, despite the protests of the CIOB(UK). It had, on 26 May 1967, changed its name to The Australian Institute of Building (AIB).

Having established itself and received recognition accorded by a [[Royal Charter]], the Institute began to redefine its educational requirements at Licentiate and Corporate grade.
It then set about ensuring that the then degree and certificate courses in building which were available met the standards which the Institute required. From this has developed a course assessment/qualification accreditation system which has proven to be of great value to academic institutions and the industry.

While graduates in building were recognised immediately by the private sector, recognition in the public sector was harder to achieve. The breakthrough came in 1977 with the recognition by the Public Service Board of Degrees in Building for the positions of Project Manager Class 1-3, Area Manager Class 1-3 and Construction Manager. Recognition of the AIB as a professional institute was accorded in the Commonwealth Gazette in March 1983. This approval, under the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act, recognises Corporate members of the Institute as professionally qualified.

Since its establishment in 1968 the Australian Institute of Building Research and Education Foundation has funded developments in education and specific research projects. One of these projects determined the duties and responsibilities of, and the levels of competence required by, professionals and technicians in the Building industry. In 1990 the AIB became an Associate of the International Council for Building Research (CIB). The AIB Papers, a journal of refereed academic papers, has been published by the Institute since 1986.

The By-laws and Regulations were amended to allow for changes to grades of member in 1981, 1992 and 1997.

With the Foundation of a New Zealand Institute of Building (NZIOB) in 1984, the [[New Zealand]] Chapter of the AIB was closed down. The AIB continues to have a close relationship with NZIOB.

In 1997 the AIB became a foundation member of the International Association for the Professional Management of Construction (IAPMC).

So as to streamline management decisions, in 1996 the Council delegated most of its authority to an Executive Board of Management.

Pending development of industry wide competency based standards, the Institute produced standards for its own membership purposes. These standards are also used for assessing applicants for the National Building Professionals Register (NBPR) which the AIB launched in 1997.

A [[Hong Kong]] Chapter was established in 1998, and AIB's overseas operations expanded considerably ten years later.

AIB is also the convenor of the Australian Building and Construction Higher Education Round Table, the peak body to bring together the construction industry and Australian universities.

'''Bioconcentration''' is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water.&lt;ref name="Tox. II Book"&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Environmental Toxicology: Molecular Structures to Ecological Landscapes|year=2011|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=978-1-4398-0410-0|pages=117‚Äì162|vauthors=Landis WG, Sofield RM, Yu MH |edition=Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of [[aquatic toxicology]].&lt;ref name="Tox. II Book" /&gt; Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.&lt;ref name="Gobas and Morrison Book"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Property Estimation Methods for Chemicals: Environmental and Health Sciences|year=2000|publisher=Lewis|location=Boca Raton, FL, USA|author=Gobas FAPC|authorlink=Bioconcentration and bioaccumulation in the aquatic environment|author2=Morrison HA|editor=Boethling RS |editor2=Mackay D |pages=189‚Äì231|chapter=Biococentration and biomagnification in the aquatic environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several ways in which to measure and assess [[bioaccumulation]] and bioconcentration.  These include: octanol-water [[partition coefficient]]s (K&lt;sub&gt;OW&lt;/sub&gt;), bioconcentration factors (BCF), bioaccumulation factors (BAF) and biota-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF).  Each of these can be calculated using either [[empirical data]] or measurements as well as from [[mathematical models]].&lt;ref name="Arnot and Gobas (2004)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arnot|first=Jon A.|author2=Frank A.P.C. Gobas|title=A Food Web Bioaccumulation Model for Organic Chemicals in Aquatic Ecosystems|journal=Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry|year=2004|volume=23|issue=10|pages=2343‚Äì2355|doi=10.1897/03-438}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these mathematical models is a [[fugacity]]-based BCF model developed by [[Donald Mackay (scientist)|Don Mackay]].&lt;ref name="Mackay (1982)-Fugacity"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mackay|first=Don|title=Correlation of bioconcentration factors|journal=Environmental Science and Technology|year=1982|volume=16|pages=274‚Äì278|doi=10.1021/es00099a008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bioconcentration factor can also be expressed as the ratio of the concentration of a [[chemical]] in an [[organism]] to the [[concentration]] of the chemical in the surrounding [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. The BCF is a measure of the extent of chemical sharing between an organism and the surrounding environment.&lt;ref name="Ecology PBT Definitions"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 173‚Äì333 WAC Persistent Bioaccumulative Toxins|url=http://www.ecy.wa.gov/laws-rules/wac173333/p0407_cont_a.pdf|work=Department of Ecology|accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In surface water, the BCF is the ratio of a chemical's concentration in an organism to the chemical's aqueous concentration.  BCF is often expressed in units of liter per kilogram (ratio of mg of chemical per kg of organism to mg of chemical per liter of water).&lt;ref name="Fate and Transport Book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hemond|first=Harold|title=Chemical Fate and Transport in the Environment|year=2000|publisher=Elsevier|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=978-0-12-340275-2|pages=156‚Äì157}}&lt;/ref&gt; BCF can simply be an observed ratio, or it can be the prediction of a partitioning model.&lt;ref name="Fate and Transport Book" /&gt; A partitioning model is based on assumptions that chemicals partition between water and aquatic organisms as well as the idea that chemical equilibrium exists between the organisms and the aquatic environment in which it is found&lt;ref name="Fate and Transport Book" /&gt;

== Calculation ==

Bioconcentration can be described by a bioconcentration factor (BCF), which is the ratio of the chemical concentration in an organism or biota to the concentration in water:&lt;ref name="Gobas and Morrison Book" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;BCF=\frac{Concentration_{Biota}}{Concentration_{Water}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Gobas and Morrison Book" /&gt;

Bioconcentration factors can also be related to the octanol-water partition coefficient, K&lt;sub&gt;ow&lt;/sub&gt;. The octanol-water [[partition coefficient]] (K&lt;sub&gt;ow&lt;/sub&gt;) is correlated with the potential for a chemical to [[bioaccumulate]] in organisms; the BCF can be predicted from log K&lt;sub&gt;ow&lt;/sub&gt;, via computer programs based on [[structure activity relationship]] (SAR)&lt;ref name="USEPA PBT Info."&gt;{{cite web|title=Category for Persistent, Bioaccumulative, and Toxic New Chemical Substances|url=http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA-TOX/1999/November/Day-04/t28888.htm|work=Federal Register Environmental Documents|publisher=USEPA|accessdate=3 June 2012|author=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; or through the [[linear equation]]:

&lt;math&gt;log BCF=m log K_{OW}+b&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Mussel Study"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bergen|first=Barbara J.|author2=William G. Nelson|author3=Richard J. Pruell|title=Bioaccumulation of PCB Congeners by Blue Mussels (''Mytilus edulis'') deployed in New Bedford Harbor, Massachusetts|journal=Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry|year=1993|volume=12|pages=1671‚Äì1681|doi=10.1002/etc.5620120916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where:

&lt;math&gt;K_{OW}=\frac{Concentration_{octanol}}{Concentration_{water}}=\frac{C_O}{C_W}&lt;/math&gt; at equilibrium

=== Fugacity capacity ===
Fugacity and BCF relate to each other in the following equation:

&lt;math&gt;Z_{Fish}=\frac{P_{Fish}\times{BCF}}{H}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="Fate and Transport Book" /&gt;

where Z&lt;sub&gt;Fish&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to the [[Fugacity capacity]] of a chemical in the fish, P&lt;sub&gt;Fish&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to the density of the fish (mass/length&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), BCF is the partition coefficient between the fish and the water (length&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/mass) and H is equal to the Henry's law constant (Length&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/Time&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;ref name="Fate and Transport Book" /&gt;

== Uses ==

=== Regulatory uses ===
Through the use of the [[Persistent bioaccumulative toxic chemical|PBT]] Profiler and using criteria set forth by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] under the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] (TSCA), a substance is considered to be not bioaccumulative if it has a BCF less than 1000, bioaccumulative if it has a BCF from 1000‚Äì5000&lt;ref name="BCF Range"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bioaccumulation Criteria|url=http://www.pbtprofiler.net/criteria.asp|accessdate=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and very bioaccumulative if it has a BCF greater than 5,000.&lt;ref name="BCF Range" /&gt;

The thresholds under [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH]] are a BCF of &gt; 2000 l/kg bzw. for the B and 5000 l/kg for vB criteria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/13632/information_requirements_r11_en.pdf Guidance on information requirements and chemical safety assessment: Chapter R.11: PBT Assessment (Version 1.1)], 2012, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
A bioconcentration factor greater than 1 is indicative of a [[hydrophobic]] or [[lipophilic]] chemical.  It is an indicator of how probable a chemical is to [[bioaccumulate]].&lt;ref name="Tox. II Book" /&gt; These chemicals have high lipid affinities and will concentrate in tissues with high lipid content instead of in an aqueous environment like the [[cytosol]].   Models are used to predict chemical partitioning in the environment which in turn allows the prediction of the biological fate of lipophilic chemicals.&lt;ref name="Tox. II Book" /&gt;

=== Equilibrium partitioning models ===
Based on an assumed steady state scenario, the fate of a chemical in a system is modeled giving predicted endpoint phases and concentrations.&lt;ref name=Rand&gt;{{cite book|last=Rand|first=Gary|title=Fundamentals of Aquatic Toxicology|year=1995|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton|isbn=1-56032-091-5|pages=494‚Äì495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It needs to be considered that reaching steady state may need a substantial amount of time as estimated using the following equation (in hours).&lt;ref&gt;OECD GUIDELINES FOR TESTING OF CHEMICALS: Test No. 305: Bioaccumulation in Fish: Aqueous and Dietary Exposure, S. 56, [[doi: 10.1787/9789264185296-en]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hawker D.W. and Connell D.W. (1988), Influence of partition coefficient of lipophilic compounds on bioconcentration kinetics with fish. Wat. Res. 22: 701‚Äì707, [[doi: 10.1016/0043-1354(88)90181-9]].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;t_{eSS}=0.00654 \cdot K_{OW} + 55.31&lt;/math&gt;

For a substance with a log(K&lt;sub&gt;OW&lt;/sub&gt;) of 4, it thus takes approximately five days to reach effective steady state. For a log(K&lt;sub&gt;OW&lt;/sub&gt;) of 6, the equilibrium time increases to nine months.

=== Fugacity models ===
Fugacity is another predictive criterion for equilibrium among phases that has units of pressure.  It is equivalent to partial pressure for most environmental purposes. It is the absconding propensity of a material.&lt;ref name="Tox. II Book" /&gt; BCF can be determined from output parameters of a fugacity model and thus used to predict the fraction of chemical immediately interacting with and possibly having an effect on an organism.

=== Food web models ===
If organism-specific [[fugacity]] values are available, it is possible to create a food web model which takes [[Food web|trophic webs]] into consideration.&lt;ref name="Tox. II Book" /&gt; This is especially pertinent for [[conservative chemicals]] that are not easily metabolized into degradation products. [[Biomagnification]] of conservative chemicals such as toxic metals can be harmful to [[apex predators]] like [[killer whales|orca whales]], [[osprey]], and [[bald eagles]].

== Applications to toxicology ==

=== Predictions ===
Bioconcentration factors facilitate predicting contamination levels in an organism based on chemical concentration in surrounding water.&lt;ref name=Rand /&gt; BCF in this setting only applies to aquatic organisms. Air breathing organisms do not take up chemicals in the same manner as other aquatic organisms.  Fish, for example uptake chemicals via [[ingestion]] and osmotic gradients in [[gill lamellae]].&lt;ref name="Fate and Transport Book" /&gt;

When working with [[benthic macroinvertebrates]], both water and [[benthic]] sediments may contain chemical that affects the organism. Biota-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF) and [[biomagnification factor]] (BMF) also influence toxicity in aquatic environments.

BCF does not explicitly take metabolism into consideration so it needs to be added to models at other points through uptake, elimination or degradation equations for a selected organism.

=== Body burden ===
Chemicals with high BCF values are more lipophilic, and at equilibrium organisms will have greater concentrations of chemical than other phases in the system. Body burden is the total amount of chemical in the body of an organism,&lt;ref name=Rand /&gt; and body burdens will be greater when dealing with a lipophilic chemical.

== Biological factors ==
In determining the degree at which bioconcentration occurs biological factors have to be kept in mind.The rate at which an organism is exposed through respiratory surfaces and contact with dermal surfaces of the organism, competes against the rate of excretion from an organism. The rate of excretion is a loss of chemical from the respiratory surface, growth dilution, fecal excretion, and [[metabolic biotransformation]].&lt;ref name="Review article of BCF and BAF" /&gt; Growth dilution is not an actual process of excretion but due to the mass of the organism increasing while the contaminant concentration remains constant dilution occurs.

The interaction between inputs and outputs is shown here:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{dC_{B}}{dt}=(k_{1}C_{WD})-(k_{2}+k_{E}+k_{M}+k_{G})C_{B}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Review article of BCF and BAF" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The variables are defined as:&lt;br /&gt;

=== Temperature ===
Temperature may affect metabolic transformation, and bioenergetics.

=== Water quality ===
The natural particle content as well as organic carbon content in water can affect the bioavailability. The contaminant can bind to the particles in the water, making uptake more difficult, as well as become ingested by the organism. This ingestion could consist of contaminated particles which would cause the source of contamination to be from more than just water.&lt;ref name="Review article of BCF and BAF"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arnot|first=Jon|author2=Frank A.P.C.

The '''Bruce Report''' (or the '''Bruce Plan''') is the name commonly given to the ''First Planning Report to the Highways and Planning Committee of the Corporation of the City of Glasgow''&lt;ref name="Bruce"&gt;Robert Bruce (1945), ''First Planning report to the Highways and Planning Committee of the Corporation of the City of Glasgow'', Corporation of the City of Glasgow, Glasgow&lt;/ref&gt;  published in March 1945.  It  influenced an intensive programme of regeneration and rebuilding efforts which took place in the city and surroundings from the mid-1950s and lasted until the late 1970s. The author was  [[Robert Bruce (engineer)|Robert Bruce]], Glasgow Corporation Engineer at the time.

A few years later in 1949 the Scottish Office in Edinburgh issued its rival ''Clyde Valley Regional Plan 1946'' ('CVP'). This was authored by a team led by [[Sir Patrick Abercrombie]] and Robert H Matthew&lt;ref name="CVP"&gt;Sir Patrick Abercrombie &amp; Robert H Matthew (1949), ''Clyde Valley Regional Plan 1946'', His Majesty's Stationery Office, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; and disagreed with the Bruce Report in a number of important areas. In particular the CVP recommended an overspill policy for Glasgow and the rehousing of much of the population in new towns outside the city. The Bruce Report preferred rebuilding and rehousing within the city boundary. The friction and debate between the supporters and spheres of influence for these two reports led to a series of initiatives designed to transform the city over the following fifty years.&lt;ref name="SmithWannop"&gt;Roger Smith &amp; Urlan Wannop (eds) (1985), ''Strategic Planning in Action: The Impact of the Clyde Valley Regional Plan 1946-1982'', Gower Publishing Company, Aldershot&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="checkland"&gt;Sydney Checkland (1976), ''The Upas Tree - Glasgow 1875-1975'', Chapter 5, University of Glasgow Press, Glasgow&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the Bruce Report initiatives were put into practice; others were not. The report and its implementation significantly shaped modern day Glasgow. A good example of the scope of its impact is the [[M8 motorway (Scotland)|M8 motorway]] which was built following proposals in the report. Also the mid-20th century policy or resettling much of the city's population to peripheral housing schemes arose from recommendations in the Bruce Report, reflecting [[Glasgow Corporation]]'s resistance to overspill and new towns until it co-operated in the designation of [[Cumbernauld]] new town in 1956. The civic, economic, political, architectural, geographic and demographic landscape of modern Glasgow would have been radically different without the influence of these two reports. Had the Bruce Report itself been implemented unaltered in its entirety, the city today would probably have been unrecognisable.

==City Centre==

[[File:Concrete architecture on George Street - geograph.org.uk - 1740848.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Commercial developments built in the early 1960s such as this one on George Street were typical of those influenced by the Bruce Report's findings. This complex - now occupied by [[Strathclyde University]] - replaced a block of slum tenements.]]

Central to the Bruce Report's recommendations were a set of radical proposals which amounted to wholesale demolition of a large section of the city centre. These would have involved knocking down many historic and architecturally important Victorian and Georgian buildings. The report advocated rebuilding most of the city centre to a single design with the aim of creating a coherently planned city. Part of this plan involved removing residential dwellings from the central area and replacing them with commercial developments that would house new service industries, whilst the city's Victorian grid plan of streets would almost be completely re-arranged into a structured series of "zones" containing distinct spaces for city functions such as housing, commerce, and education.

Among the buildings earmarked for demolition by Bruce were many which are now regarded as Glasgow's most significant architectural assets. These included [[Glasgow Central Station]], The [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]], [[Glasgow School of Art]], designed by the renowned architect [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] and the [[Glasgow City Chambers]]  and the [[Glasgow Royal Infirmary]]. Bruce's justification for these radical proposals was the creation of a new "healthy and beautiful city" based on formal 1950s architecture. Ultimately less draconian measures were sought for the regeneration of the city centre.

Although the proposals for the city centre were rejected, the later concept of the Comprehensive Development Area (CDA) can trace its roots directly to the Bruce Report. In the 1950s, Glasgow Corporation designated CDAs as districts suffering from severe overcrowding and insanitary housing, where the only solution would be complete demolition and rebuilding.  Of the 20 CDAs which the Corporation identified, two of them - [[Anderston]] and [[Townhead]] - lay partially within the city centre and saw nearly total destruction to make way for roads, high-rise housing and concrete office buildings.  For example, the southern reaches of Townhead were re-zoned for educational use in preparation for the former [[Royal College of Science and Technology]]'s growth into a [[university]]. The resulting [[John Anderson Campus]] of what became the [[University of Strathclyde]] now occupies a huge proportion of Townhead.  In Anderston, entire communities were wiped off the map to make way for the controversial ring road (see below) as well as commercial developments on the western edge of the city centre - new buildings such as [[Elmbank Gardens]] and the [[Anderston Centre]] being prime examples.

==Rehousing Glasgow's slum population==

[[File:Red Road flats at Balornock - geograph.org.uk - 119968.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The housing proposals of the Bruce Report were among the most controversial aspects. It inspired the mass construction of high rise estates around the city such as the infamous [[Red Road (flats)|Red Road]] development pictured above.]]

One proposal in the report was implemented almost in its entirety: the demolition of Glasgow's slum [[Housing in Glasgow|housing]]. Bruce suggested that many of Glasgow's residential areas be torn down, as a great many of these unplanned developments had become slums. He proposed that their inhabitants be rehoused in new developments on the periphery of the city. The key goals of this proposal was the creation of a less densely populated city and a greater quality of life for its inhabitants. Beginning in the 1950s Glasgow's clearance programme relocated some 300,000{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} of the city's population. [[New towns]], such as [[East Kilbride]] and [[Cumbernauld]] were created in the areas surrounding the city as part of this redevelopment. The programme also involved the creation of new outer suburbs on the fringes of the city boundaries such as [[Castlemilk]], [[Pollok]], [[Milton, Glasgow|Milton]], [[Drumchapel]] and [[Easterhouse]], all of which are on the edges of the city.  Although the Bruce Report in itself did not precisely specify the ''manner'' in which its housing proposals should be implemented, the city fathers would ultimately look to the ideas of the French architect [[Le Corbusier]] for their inspiration in how those goals should be achieved.  The end result was the mass construction of numerous high-rise [[tower block]] estates on green belt sites within the city boundaries.

As with most other aspects of the city's redevelopment, the housing clearances were not carried out exactly to Bruce's proposed plan. Bruce wanted all of Glasgow's citizens to be rehoused within the city boundaries.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} In building the new towns, a significant portion of the city's population were moved outwith the jurisdiction of the Glasgow Corporation. This resulted in a dramatic reduction in the city's reported population between the start of the 20th and 21st centuries. The area's actual population increased during this period and the urban spread of Glasgow now covers a much larger area than it did at the start of the 20th century. Bruce's underlying aim of a less densely populated city was ultimately achieved. At its peak in the 1930s Glasgow's inner city population was 1.1 million, today it is roughly 600,000.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Glasgow remains Scotland's largest city however, with the population of Greater Glasgow close to 1.8 million{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} and the entire Greater Glasgow conurbation is now 2.3 million.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} 44% of Scotland's entire population.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  The 'social engineering' which underpinned the new housing schemes, has been largely concluded as being a failure by contemporary historians; since many of the planned suburbs quickly developed social problems and deteriorated into slums themselves by the 1980s.  Some of the estates, most notably those in Pollok, Red Road and Easterhouse, have either been demolished completely or are earmarked for eventual clearance.

==Transport==
The scope of Bruce's proposals was not limited to housing reform, Glasgow's transport infrastructure was also a target for change. Bruce proposed that quality, high speed transport links were vital if the city was going to transition to a service based economy against the background of a declining industrial base.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Roads===
[[File:Glasgow, the M8 emerges from under Charing Cross - geograph.org.uk - 1539310.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The M8 Motorway is the most visible legacy of the Bruce Report in the centre of Glasgow. It forms two sides of an incomplete inner ring road around the city centre]]

Bruce proposed the creation of a system of arterial motorways into the city converging to form a [[Glasgow Inner Ring Road]] - a motorway "box" which would have encircled the city centre. The proposed network included a Renfrew motorway, a Monklands motorway, a Maryhill motorway, a Stirling motorway and a south eastern motorway connecting Glasgow with the wider motorway network. These proposals were not acted on until the 1960s when the initiative began as a sweeping programme of clearing and construction. The Monklands and Renfrew motorways were completed forming what is now known as the [[M8 motorway (Scotland)|M8]]. These two motorways form the northern and western flanks of the planned ring road. However carving a motorway through long standing communities - much of Charing Cross and Anderston were completely destroyed in its construction - caused such protest that the rest of the Inner Ring Road initiative was shelved. The Stirling motorway became the present day [[M80 motorway|M80]] and its initial Glasgow section was openened in 1992 as the [[Stepps]] bypass, and the complete route through [[Cumbernauld]] was fully opened in 2011.

An extension to the [[M74 motorway|M74]] into the city centre to meet the M8 motorway was completed in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=M74 Completion|url=http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/projects/m74-completion|accessdate=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will see the completion of the southern section of Bruce's planned ring road, albeit on a marginally different route than originally proposed.

Bruce's report recommended that the Eastern flank of the Inner Ring Road be constructed along the route of Glasgow's High Street. Again this would have necessitated the demolition of many properties, including some of historic and/or architectural value. It was shelved in the face of strong local opposition.

Although not directly part of the Bruce Report, the wider plans for the Monkland Motorway contained proposals to create a South Link Motorway which would have continued south from the Stirling Motorway terminus at [[Provan Gas Works]] and bisected the East End to link with the M74. This proposal has eventually evolved into the [[Glasgow East End Regeneration Route]]. This plan proposes a road (not a [[motorway]]) which would link the M74 to the M8 through the East End of Glasgow. If successfully implemented this plan together with the M74 extension would effectively see Bruce's planned inner ring completed.

There are no signs that the Bruce Plan's proposed Maryhill motorway will ever be implemented in any way. Bruce's proposals for a ring road with four arterial routes running off it seems unlikely to ever be fully realised.

===Public Transport===
As well as recommending changes to Glasgow's road network, Bruce also suggested radical changes to Glasgow's railways. At the time of the Bruce Report, the city had four major railway stations. [[Glasgow Central railway station|Central]] and [[St Enoch railway station|St Enoch]] both served primarily southbound destinations. [[Glasgow Queen Street railway station|Queen Street]] and [[Buchanan Street railway station|Buchanan Street]] mainly served northbound destinations.

In order to rationalise the city's mainline services, Bruce suggested that all four Victorian railway stations be demolished and replaced with two new purpose built stations. A new ''Glasgow North'' station was proposed roughly on the site of Buchanan Street station (occupying a larger area) to replace Buchanan Street and Queen Street stations. A ''Glasgow South'' station was proposed on the approximate site of Glasgow Central station to replace Central and St Enoch stations. Bruce's plan then called for a new bus station on the Queen Street site, with the "low level" railway station there remaining to provide suburban services and to connect the new bus station to the rail network.

These plans were never implemented, and all four stations remained until the 1960s when the [[Beeching Axe]] reforms changed the shape of rail services across Scotland, England, and Wales. Beeching's reforms spelt the end for both Buchanan Street and St Enoch stations which closed, effectively rationalising rail services in the city along similar lines to Bruce's two station plan, but without requiring the demolition of four stations and construction of two new ones. Beeching's reforms also removed low level services from Glasgow Central station, but these were reintroduced in the late 1970s. [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central]] has recently undergone extensive, careful and sympathetic renovation and remains one of the city's architectural assets to this day.

Two new bus stations would ultimately result from the Bruce Report, positioned at either corner of the city's central area to make full use of the Ring Road, a new terminus at [[Anderston Centre|Anderston]] to the south (eventually opening in 1972 as part of the Anderston Centre), thus replacing the older terminus at Waterloo Street whilst Dundas Street bus station was replaced by [[Buchanan bus station|Buchanan Street Bus Station]] in 1976.  Anderston eventually closed in 1993, with all services consolidated at the Buchanan terminal.

A '''burn recovery bed''' or '''burn bed''' is a special type of [[bed]] designed for [[hospital]] patients who have suffered severe [[second degree burn|skin burns]] across large portions of their body.

Generally, concentrated pressure on any one spot of the damaged skin can be extremely painful to the patient, so the primary function of a burn bed is to distribute the weight of the patient so evenly that no single bed contact point is pressed harder than any other.

== Air-chamber burn bed ==

One type of weight-distributing burn bed uses a series of interlinked inflatable air chambers which have the surface appearance of an upside-down [[egg carton]]. Although inflatable, the air chambers are maintained in a partially deflated state so that the air pressure can freely distribute itself. Heavier parts of the patient's body can sink deeper into the grid of chambers and the air moves to chambers with less weight.

Air volume in the chambers may be regulated so as to make the bed firmer when the patient is first being placed on the bed, and then air is released to allow for a more conformal shape once lying flat across the bed surface.

== Deep-floatation water burn bed ==

This type of burn bed is similar in construction to a typical water bed, except the surface covering of the water pool has a large amount of slack and extra folds of material around the perimeter of the pool.

To limit the depth of immersion into the burn bed water pool, the water's density may be increased by adding several hundred pounds of salt to the water, as is done with a relaxation [[float tank]].

As the patient is placed onto the bed, they displace the water and can freely sink down into the pool, unlike a typical consumer water bed. As they sink down, the slack around the edges is played out so that the patient is now sunk into the water, in a form-fitting, very gentle, and dry depression in the pool.

Generally the pool is not deep enough to permit a patient to lie on their side in the pool, but even so, lying sideways is a safe condition since the patient is at no risk of breathing in water and drowning due to the water-isolation covering.

The '''Camfil Group''' is a producer and developer of [[air filter]]s and clean air products.
Camfil is also a global air filtration specialist with 24 production units and R&amp;D centres in four countries in the Americas, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. The Group, headquartered in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], has approximately 3,000 employees and sales in the range of SEK 4.3 billion. International markets account for more than 90 percent of sales. The company‚Äôs business is to provide customers with air filtration products and services within four main segments: Comfort Air, Clean Processes, Power Systems and Safety &amp; Protection.

== History ==
The global Camfil Group&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camfil.us/ Camfil USA Air Filters]&lt;/ref&gt; started out as a family business in the town of [[Trosa]], Sweden, located about {{convert|70|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Stockholm. Camfil was founded in Trosa in 1963 by the Larson family, still one of the company‚Äôs principal owners, as a joint venture with Cambridge Filtration Corporation in the United States. In 1983, the family bought Cambridge‚Äôs shares. Camfil was wholly owned by the family until 2000, when [[Ratos AB]], a Swedish private equity company, received 29.7 percent of the shares in connection with the acquisition of Farr in the United States, which was then listed on [[NASDAQ]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2000_May_2/ai_61848499/ Ratos Closes Successful Tender Offer for Farr Company], Business Wire 2000-05-02&lt;/ref&gt; Ratos sold its shares in 2010 to the other owners, families Larson and Markman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unquote.com/nordics/official-record/1896044/ratos-s-camfil-sale-nets-sek-610m Ratos‚Äôs Camfil sale nets SEK 610m] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130205043644/http://www.unquote.com/nordics/official-record/1896044/ratos-s-camfil-sale-nets-sek-610m |date=2013-02-05 }}, unquote.com 2010-11-15&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21026">[[File:ILFORD HP5 PLUS SAFETY FILM.JPG|thumb|Ilford HP5 Plus Safety Film]]

'''Cellulose acetate film''', or '''safety film''', is used in [[photography]] as a base material for [[photographic emulsion]]s. It was introduced in the early 20th century by film manufacturers as a safe [[film base]] replacement for unstable and highly [[flammable]] [[Nitrocellulose#Nitrate film|nitrate film]].

[[Cellulose diacetate]] film was first created by the German chemists [[Arthur Eichengr√ºn]] and Theodore Becker, who patented it under the name '''Cellit''', from a process they devised in 1901 for the direct acetylation of cellulose at a low temperature to prevent its degradation, which permitted the degree of acetylation to be controlled, thereby avoiding total conversion to its triacetate. Cellit was a stable, non-brittle cellulose acetate polymer that could be dissolved in acetone for further processing. A cellulose diacetate film more readily dissolved in [[acetone]] was developed by the American chemist George Miles in 1904. Miles's process (partially hydrolysing the polymer) was employed commercially for [[photographic film]] in 1909 by [[Eastman Kodak]] and the [[Path√©]] Fr√©res. Starting with cellulose diacetate, this innovation continued with [[cellulose acetate propionate]] and [[cellulose acetate butyrate]] in the 1930s, and finally in the late 1940s, [[cellulose triacetate]] was introduced, alongside [[polyester]] bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= National Film Preservation Foundation |year= 2004 |title= The Film Preservation Guide: The Basics for Archives, Libraries, and Museums |url= http://www.filmpreservation.org/preservation-basics/the-film-preservation-guide |location= San Francisco |publisher= National Film Preservation Foundation |page= 9 |isbn= 9780974709901 |accessdate= January 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These less flammable substitutes for nitrate film were called safety film.

The motion picture industry continued to use [[cellulose nitrate]] supports until the introduction of cellulose triacetate in 1948, which met the rigorous safety and performance standards set by the cinematographic industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Ram |first= A. Tulsi |title= Archival Preservation of Photographic Film-A Perspective |journal= Polymer Degradation and Stability |volume= 29 |issue= 1 |year=1990 |page= 4 |doi= 10.1016/0141-3910(90)90019-4 |issn= 0141-3910}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[chemical instability]] of cellulose acetate material, unrecognized at the time of its introduction, has since become a major threat for film collections.

== Decay and the "vinegar syndrome" ==

The first instance of cellulose triacetate degradation was reported to the [[Eastman Kodak]] Company within a decade of its introduction in 1948. The first report came from the Government of India, whose film was stored in hot, humid conditions. It was followed by further reports of degradation from collections stored in similar conditions. These observations resulted in continuing studies in the [[Kodak]] laboratories during the 1960s.

Beginning in the 1980s, there was a great deal of focus upon film stability following frequent reports of cellulose triacetate degradation. This material releases [[acetic acid]], the key ingredient in [[vinegar]] and responsible for its acidic smell. The problem became known as the "vinegar syndrome."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Adelstein |first1= P.Z. |first2= J.M. |last2=Reilly |first3= D.W. |last3= Nishimura |first4= C.J. |last4= Erbland |title= Stability of Cellulose Ester Base Photographic Film: Part I-Laboratory Testing Procedures |journal= SMPTE Motion Imaging Journal |volume= 101 |issue= 5 |date=May 1992 |page= 336 | lastauthoramp= y |doi= 10.5594/J02284 |issn= 1545-0279 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The progression of degradation ===
In acetate film, [[acetyl]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO) groups are attached to long molecular chains of [[cellulose]]. With exposure to moisture, heat, or acids, these acetyl groups break from their molecular bonds and acetic acid is released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= James M. |last= Reilly |title= Basic Strategy for Acetate Film Preservation |journal= Microform and Imaging Review |volume= 31 |issue= 4 |date=November 2007 |page=117 |doi= 10.1515/MFIR.2002.117 |issn= 0949-5770}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the acid is initially released inside the plastic, it gradually diffuses to the surface, causing a characteristic vinegary smell.

The decay process follows this pattern:

* Acetic acid is released during the initial acetate base deterioration, leading to the characteristic vinegar odor. This signal marks the progression of deterioration.&lt;ref name="Reilly1993-p11"&gt;{{cite book |last= Reilly |first= James M. |title= IPI Storage Guide for Acetate Film: Instructions for Using the Wheel, Graphs, and Table: Basic Strategy for Film Preservation |url=https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/webfm_send/299|location= Rochester |publisher= Image Permanence Institute |year= 1993 |page= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The plastic [[film base]] becomes brittle. This occurs in the advanced stages of deterioration, weakening the film and causing it to shatter with the slightest tension. These physical changes happen because cellulose acetate consists of long chains of repeating units, or [[polymer]]s. When the acetic acid is released as these groups break off, the acidic environment helps to break the links between units, shortening the [[polymer]] chains and leading to brittleness.&lt;ref name="Reilly1993-p11"/&gt;
*Shrinkage also occurs during this process. With the cellulose acetate polymer chains breaking into smaller pieces, and with their side groups splitting off, the plastic film begins to shrink. In advanced stages of deterioration, shrinkage can be as much as 10%. There have been some reports of film 35mm wide shrinking to almost 17mm.&lt;ref name="Reilly1993-p11"/&gt;
*As the acetate base shrinks, the [[gelatin]] [[emulsion]] of the film does not shrink, because it is not undergoing deterioration. The emulsion and film base separate, causing [[buckling]], referred to by archivists as 'channelling.'&lt;ref name="Reilly1993-p11"/&gt; [[Sheet film]]s are often severely channelled in the later stages of degradation.
*Crystalline deposits or liquid-filled bubbles appear on the emulsion. These are evidence of [[plasticizers]], additives to the plastic base, becoming incompatible with the film base and oozing out on the surface. This discharge of plasticizers is a sign of advanced degradation.&lt;ref name="Reilly1993-p12"&gt;Reilly (1993), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In some cases, pink or blue colors appear in some sheet films. This is caused by [[antihalation]] dyes, which are normally colorless and incorporated into the gelatin layer. When acetic acid is formed during deterioration, the acidic environment causes the dyes to return to their original pink or blue color.&lt;ref name="Reilly1993-p12"/&gt;

=== Testing for degradation ===
A testing product developed by the [[Image Permanence Institute]], A-D, or "acid-detection" indicator strips change color from blue through shades of green to yellow with increasing exposure to acid. According to the test User's Guide, they were "...created to aid in the preservation of collections of photographic film, including sheet and [[roll film]]s, cinema film, and microfilm. They provide a nondestructive method of determining the extent of vinegar syndrome in film collections."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Image Permanence Institute |title= User's Guide for A-D Strips: Film Base Deterioration Monitor |location= Rochester, NY |publisher= Image Permanence Institute |year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tools can be used to determine the extent of damage to a film collection and which steps should be taken to prolong their usability.

== Preservation and storage ==
Currently there is no practical way of halting or reversing the course of degradation. Many film collectors use [[camphor]] tablets but it is not known what the long term effects on the film would be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Allen |first1= N.S. |first2= M. |last2= Edge |first3= C.V. |last3= Horie |first4= T.S. |last4= Jewitt |first5= J.H. |last5= Appleyard |title= Degradation of Historic Cellulose Triacetate Cinematograph Film: Influence of Various Film Parameters and Prediction of Archival Life |journal= The Journal of Photographic Science |volume= 36 |issue= 6 |year= 1998 |page=194 |issn= 0022-3638 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While there has been significant research regarding various methods of slowing degradation, such as storage in [[molecular sieve]]s, temperature and moisture are the two key factors affecting the rate of deterioration. According to the [[Image Permanence Institute]], fresh acetate film stored at a temperature of 70&amp;nbsp;¬∞F (21&amp;nbsp;¬∞C) and 40% relative humidity will last approximately 50 years before the onset of vinegar syndrome. Reducing the temperature by 15¬∞ while maintaining the same level of humidity brings a dramatic improvement: at a temperature of 55&amp;nbsp;¬∞F (13&amp;nbsp;¬∞C) and 40% relative humidity, the estimated time until onset of vinegar syndrome is 150 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Reilly |first= James M. |title= IPI Storage Guide for Acetate Film: Instructions for Using the Wheel, Graphs, and Table: Basic Strategy for Film Preservation |url=https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/webfm_send/299|location= Rochester |publisher= Image Permanence Institute |year= 1993 |pages= 5‚Äì6 |oclc= 28283222}}&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of low temperature and low relative humidity represents the optimum storage condition for cellulose acetate base films,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Adelstein |first1= P.Z. |first2= J.M. |last2= Reilly |first3= D.W. |last3= Nishimura |first4= C.J. |last4= Erbland |title= Stability of Cellulose Ester Base Photographic Film: Part II-Practical Storage Considerations |journal= SMPTE Motion Imaging Journal |volume= 101 |issue= 5 |date=May 1992 |page=353 |doi= 10.5594/J02285 |issn= 1545-0279 |lastauthoramp= y}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the caveat that relative humidity should not be lowered below 20%, or the film will dry out too much and become brittle.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly (1993), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cold storage options for the preservation of acetate film range from insulated cold storage rooms, or vaults, with relative humidity control (typical settings in the range of 35-40&amp;nbsp;¬∞F temperature, and 30-35% relative humidity), which might be used by archival institutions for large and medium-sized collections, to free-standing freezer units, which can be cost-effective for small collections, but necessitate vapor-proof packaging of the films to protect against relative humidity extremes and condensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= National Film Preservation Foundation |year= 2004 |title= The Film Preservation Guide: The Basics for Archives, Libraries, and Museums |url= http://www.filmpreservation.org/preservation-basics/the-film-preservation-guide |location= San Francisco |publisher= National Film Preservation Foundation |page= 62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Sarah S. (2007). "[http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/topics/v12/pmgt12-032.pdf Cold Storage Options: Costs and Implementation Issues]." ''Topics in Photographic Preservation, Volume 12''. Washington, DC: American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works. p. 224-238; here: p. 227-229.&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial storage facilities may offer varying environmental conditions at different rates.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (2007), p. 226; ''The Film Preservation Guide'' (2007), p. 63-64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bonded.com/storage.php |title= Film and Media Storage |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100914130421/http://www.bonded.com/storage.php |archivedate= September 14, 2010 |publisher= Bonded Services Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microenvironments‚Äîthe conditions inside an enclosure‚Äîcan also affect the condition of cellulose acetate film.  Enclosures that are breathable or that contain an acid absorbent are instrumental in reducing the rate of decay due to vinegar syndrome.  Sealed metal containers can trap the decay products released by the film, promoting the spread of vinegar syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first1= Jean-Louis |last1= Bigourdan |first2= J. |last2= Reilly |title= Effectiveness of Storage Conditions in Controlling the Vinegar Syndrome: Preservation Strategies for Acetate Base Motion-Picture Film Collections |url= https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/webfm_send/307 |format= PDF |booktitle= Archiver et communiquer l'image et le son: les enjeux du 3√®me millenaire |conference= Joint Technical Symposium Paris 2000 |editor1-first= Michelle |editor1-last=Aubert |editor2-first= Richard |editor2-last= Billeaud |location= Paris |publisher= CNC |date=May 2000 |pages= 14‚Äì34 |isbn=9782910202033 |lastauthoramp= y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rescuing damaged film ==
During early stages of decay, the film content can be rescued by transferring it to new [[film stock]]. Once the film becomes brittle it cannot be copied in its original quality in sight and sound. Because the gelatin emulsion usually stays intact during the degradation process, it is possible to save the image on sheet film using solvents to dissolve the base off the emulsion. Once the emulsion has been freed from the shrunken support, it can be photographed or transferred to a new support. Because of the solvents used, this is a delicate and potentially hazardous procedure and is an expensive process for a large collection. Degraded motion picture film cannot be restored in this way, but sheet films often can.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Reilly |first= James M |title= Basic Strategy for Acetate Film Preservation |journal= Microform and Imaging Review |volume= 31 |issue= 4 |date=November 2007 |page= 118 |doi= 10.1515/MFIR.2002.117 |issn= 0949-5770}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While digitization would be an ideal way to preserve the contents of cellulose acetate film, current standards do not allow for scanning at sufficient resolutions to produce a copy of the same picture and sound quality as the original.{{citation needed|reason=Technology is advancing DAILY! Really now this might have been true at one point but sounds like a dated statement which may well no longer be true|date=November 2015}}  Currently, the U.S. [[National Film Preservation Foundation]] advocates film-to-film transfer as the best method for film preservation, with the copies stored in proper environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= National Film Preservation Foundation |year= 2004 |title= The Film Preservation Guide: The Basics for Archives, Libraries, and Museums |url= http://www.filmpreservation.org/preservation-basics/the-film-preservation-guide |location= San Francisco |publisher= National Film Preservation Foundation |page= 44 |isbn= 9780974709901 |accessdate= January 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other uses ==
Cellulose acetate film is also used to make replicates of materials and biological samples for [[Microscope|microscopy]]. The techniques were developed for metallographic needs to examine the grain structure of polished metals. [[Replication (metallography)|Replication]] can be used to understand the distribution, for example, of different types of iron in carbon steel samples, or the fine distribution of damage to a sample subject to mechanical wear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= G.F. |last1= Vander Voort |first2= A. |last2= Ro√≥sz |date=February 1984 |title= Measurement of the Interlamellar Spacing of Pearlite |journal= Metallography |volume= 17 |issue= 1 |pages= 1‚Äì17 |doi= 10.1016/0026-0800(84)90002-8 |issn= 0026-0800 |lastauthoramp= y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= P.A. |last1=Higham |first2= F.H. |last2= Stott |first3= B. |last3= Bethune |title= Mechanisms of Wear of the Metal Surface During Fretting Corrosion of Steel on Polymers |journal= Corrosion Science |volume= 18 |issue= 1 |year= 1978 |pages= 3‚Äì13 |issn= 0010-938X |doi= 10.1016/S0010-938X(78)80071-7 |lastauthoramp= y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2592">'''Clay panel''' (also known as '''clay board''', '''clay wallboard''', '''clay building board''', '''clay building panel''') is a panel made of [[clay]] with some additives. The clay is mixed with [[sand]], [[water]], and [[fiber]], typically [[wood fiber]], and sometimes other additives like starch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natureplus.org/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/cert-criterias/GL1006.pdf Criterias for clay board certification, 2015] (natureplus.org)&lt;/ref&gt; Most often this means employing the use of high-[[cellulose]] waste fibres. To improve the breaking resistance clay boards are often embedded in a [[Hessian fabric|hessian skin]] on the backside or similar embeddings.

Clay board is an alternative to gypsum plasterboard. It is suitable for [[drywall]] applications for interior walls and ceilings. It can be applied to either timber or metal studwork. Usually the application of clay boards is completed with clay finishing plaster.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/home/sustainability-in-practice-unfired-clay-products/8600396.article Sandy Patience: ''Sustainability in Practice: Unfired Clay Products''] The Architect's Journal, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Constructional properties ==

The boards have fire retardant properties and medium levels of acoustic insulation. Due to the clay component they have the ability to absorb large amounts of [[humidity]] through the plaster and helping to protect vulnerable buildings from excess moisture generated by modern living.&lt;ref name=cw&gt;[https://clay-works.com/backing-board-options-clayworks-plasters/  Board Options for Clayworks Plasters] (clay-works.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Processing ==

The cutting of clay boards can be done with a cutter knife, [[jigsaw (tool)|jigsaw]] or [[circular saw]]. The clay board is mounted in vertical or horizontal form. It is fastened with screws with plate head or holding plate, alternatively also with wide back clamps.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lemix.eu/verarbeitung/ Verarbeitung von Lehmbauplatten] (lemix.eu)&lt;/ref&gt;

A clay plaster skim can be directly applied to the boards following joint filling and reinforcement.&lt;ref name=cw/&gt;

== Applications ==
* Interior wall and ceiling board
* Area separation wall board
* Backer board and underlayment
* Substrates for coatings and insulated systems

In broadcasting, '''digital subchannels''' are a method of transmitting more than one independent program stream simultaneously from the same [[digital radio]] or [[digital terrestrial television|television]] [[Television station|station]] on the same [[radio frequency]] channel. This is done by using [[data compression]] techniques to reduce the size of each individual program stream, and [[multiplex (TV)|multiplexing]] to combine them into a single signal. The practice is sometimes called "[[Multicast#Multicast_over_wireless_networks_and_cable-TV|multicasting]]".

==ATSC television==

===United States===
The [[ATSC]] digital television standard used in the [[United States]] supports multiple program streams over-the-air, allowing [[television station]]s to transmit one or more subchannels over a single digital signal. A [[virtual channel]] numbering scheme distinguishes broadcast subchannels by appending the [[television channel]] number with a period digit (".xx"). Simultaneously, the suffix indicates that a television station offers additional programming streams. By convention, the suffix position ".1" is normally used to refer to the station's main digital channel and the ".0" position is reserved for [[Analogue television|analog channels]]. For example, most of the [[owned-and-operated station]]s/[[network affiliate|affiliates]] of [[Ion Television]] transmit six streams in the following format:
{| class="wikitable"

The most of any large broadcaster in the United States, [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]] stations transmit five channels (in [[standard-definition television|standard definition]]) and its subchannel services [[Hillsong Channel]], [[JUCE TV]]/[[Smile (TV network)|Smile]] (two networks that technically operate as separate 24-hour services, but since June 2015, air portions of their respective schedules on a single subchannel over-the-air), [[TBN Enlace USA]] and [[TBN Salsa]]. More programming streams can be fit into a single channel space at the cost of broadcast quality. Among smaller stations, [[KAXT-CD]] in [[San Francisco]] is believed to have the most feeds of any individual over-the-air broadcaster, offering twelve video and several audio feeds (all transmitted in standard definition). [[WANN-CD]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], with ten video and six audio feeds, comes at a close second. Several cable-to-air broadcasters, such as those in [[Willmar, Minnesota]] and [[Cortez, Colorado]], have multiplexed more than five separate [[cable television]] channels into subchannels of one signal.

Operating in a sector traditionally lacking subchannels, [[digital cable|digital cable television]] provider [[Music Choice]] packages its nearly 50 music channels (including [[Music Choice Play]]) as digital subchannels of one channel. This is possible as the only information sent over each channel are audio feeds and a still slide which rotates every 20 seconds, displaying an advertisement and information about the current playing song on the individual channel. The audio feed and rotating stills occupy significantly less bandwidth than video feeds, leaving space for more multiplexed content.

A broadcaster saves significant costs in power and bandwidth through multiplexing in comparison to the cost of operating additional analog television stations to accommodate the extra programming. In practice, operating extra stations is impossible due to the required channel and distance separations combined with the available number of channels.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Most [[ATSC tuner]]s will automatically add a new digital subchannel to their internal [[channel map]], once it is tuned to the station carrying the new channel. However, some of these will not delete the channel if the station removes it.

[[Mobile DTV]] is also carried on ATSC stations, but as a separate service, according to the [[ATSC-M/H]] standard.

The [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) considers all subchannels carried by a single station to have the same [[call letter]]s for legal [[station identification|identification]] purposes. However, within the broadcast sales industry, to differentiate subchannels, the initial letter of a call sign changes per subchannel. As per [[Nielsen Holdings|Nielsen]], digital stations identified with a "W" call letter will generally have their subchannels identified with an "E" (.2), "G" (.3), "H" (.4), "I" (.5) or "J" (.6). Digital stations identified with a "K" call-letter will generally have their subchannels identified with an "N" (.2), "O" (.3), "Q" (.4), "R" (.5) or "S" (.6). For example, if the call letters are WFRC and the station broadcasts on channel 10, then the 10.2 subchannel is identified as EFRC, 10.3 is GFRC, 10.4 is HFRC, 10.5 is IFRC and 10.6 is JFRC. If the call letters are KFRC and the station broadcasts on channel 10, then 10.2 is identified as NFRC, 10.3 is OFRC, 10.4 is QFRC, 10.5 is RFRC and 10.6 is SFRC.

===Canada===
Although digital television services in Canada use the same ATSC technology as the United States, none of the [[Digital television in Canada#Deployment|stations currently broadcasting a digital signal]] transmit any subchannel other than a possible HD service or a standard definition simulcast of the main channel. Unlike the FCC in the United States, the body that governs Canadian broadcasting licenses, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC), requires stations to file license amendments in order to be considered for permission to carry digital subchannels (this differs from the Commission's rules for premium cable television services, which allow the addition of multiplex channels consistent with the service's license requirements without the need to amend the license). On August 17, 2012, the CRTC gave approval to [[Leamington, Ontario]] community station [[CFTV-DT|CFTV-TV]] to broadcast four local subchannels on its digital signal, making it the first station in Canada to launch original content on its multiplex channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decision CRTC 12-446|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2012/2012-446.htm|publisher=[[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
Some Mexican TV stations use digital subchannels as they are used in the United States. The [[Sistema P√∫blico de Radiodifusi√≥n del Estado Mexicano]], a public broadcaster, operates 26 multiplexed transmitters throughout Mexico carrying five to six public television services, while [[XHTRES-TDT]] carries Imagen Radio audio on a subchannel.

One notable experiment involving digital subchannels in Mexico was undertaken by [[TV Azteca]], which used its three muxes in the Mexico City area to broadcast a service called Hi-TV, featuring several channels encoded in [[H.264]] MPEG-4 encoding, which while available in the ATSC standard is not common on TV sets. This use of subchannels as pseudo-restricted signals within non-restricted channels was placed under investigation and litigation with authorities at [[COFETEL]] (the Federal Teleommunications Commission), involving a fine of 4,453,150 [[Mexican peso]]s. HiTV subchannels began broadcasting on an intermittent basis in 2013 and were almost completely deactivated in late 2014.

[[Televisa]] and TV Azteca use subchannels in rural areas in order to ensure national network service. As a result, since 2016, many areas that formerly had only one Azteca or Televisa network now have both from the same transmitter. Additionally, TV Azteca has two national services that are broadcast as subchannels in most areas, [[a+ (television channel)|a+]] and [[XHTVM-TDT|adn40]].

In October 2016, the [[Federal Telecommunications Institute|IFT]] put into effect new guidelines for the numbering of virtual channels. As a result, national networks use consistent numbers nationwide; SPR transmitters now use four or five major channel numbers (11, 14, 20, 22, and 45 in some areas). Prior to this, digital television stations usually used virtual channels corresponding to their former analog positions, still the case for certain local stations.

The IFT enforces minimum bitrates for digital television channels, and as such it is not possible for a station to broadcast two HD feeds in MPEG-2 encoding. Most HD feeds are provided in 1080i with all subchannels in 480i standard definition.

==DVB television==

===Australia===
Australian digital subchannels are currently divided between high definition (HD), standard definition (SD) and radio subchannels (the latter type is only carried by the stations of [[non-commercial]] networks [[SBS Television]] and [[ABC Television]]). Due to technical reasons, each network is currently only permitted one HD sub channel. All networks use their HD subchannel to provide a simulcast of their primary channel.

Inclusive of their primary standard definition channels (ignoring HD):
* SBS Television offers three unique SD subchannels ([[SBS Viceland]], [[Food Network (Australia)|Food Network]] and [[National Indigenous Television|NITV]]) and a HD simulcast of its primary channel ([[SBS HD]]); as well as a HD simulcast of its Viceland channel.
* ABC Television offers four unique SD subchannels ([[ABC2]], [[ABC Me]], [[ABC Kids (Australia)|ABC Kids]] and [[ABC News (TV channel)|ABC News]] and a HD simulcast of its primary channel ([[ABC HD (Australian TV channel)|ABC HD]]).
* The Seven Network offers three unique SD subchannels ([[7TWO]], [[7mate]] and [[7flix]]), a [[datacasting]] channel ([[Racing.com]]) and a HD simulcast of its primary channel ([[7HD]])
* The Nine Network offers three unique SD subchannels ([[9Go!]], [[9Gem]] and [[9Life]]), a datacasting channel ([[Extra (Australian TV channel)|Extra]]) and a HD simulcast of its primary channel ([[9HD]]);
* Network Ten offers two unique SD subchannels ([[One (Australian TV channel)|One]] and [[Eleven (Australian TV channel)|Eleven]]), two datacasting channels ([[TVSN]] and [[Spree TV]]) and a HD simulcast of its primary channel ([[Ten HD]]).

Community television stations in [[Melbourne]] ([[C31 Melbourne|C31]]) and [[Adelaide]] ([[44 Adelaide]]) also broadcast digital signals, however they typically only broadcast a single SD subchannel which simulcasts that station's primary channel.

There have been a number of issues surrounding the introduction of digital subchannels in Australia. The first subchannels launched by the ABC ‚Äì [[ABC Kids channel|ABC Kids]] and [[Fly TV]] ‚Äì closed after less than two years in operation in 2003 as a reaction to budget cuts by the [[Liberal Party of Australia|conservative]] [[Howard Government]] under [[Minister for Communications (Australia)|Communications Minister]] [[Richard Alston (politician)|Alston]] and low viewership (partly due to the limited distribution of set-top boxes); and commercial broadcasters could not legally air a digital subchannel other than a single high-definition service until 2009.

===Europe===
As most digital services in [[Europe]] rely on more complex methods of multiplexing, where a large number of digital channels by many different broadcasters can be broadcast on one single frequency, the concept of a subchannel is instead applied to the variety of channels that are produced by a single company. This can vary widely depending on the country: for example, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] currently has four of its digital channels ([[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]], [[ITV2]], [[ITV3]] and [[ITV4]]) broadcasting on one multiplexed service, while two others ([[ITV2|ITV2 +1]] and [[CITV]]) are each broadcast on another, separate multiplex.

==ISDB television==
{{Expand section|date=April 2018}}
In [[Japan]] and [[Brazil]], [[ISDB]] (similar to the DVB format) is used, and was specifically designed with physical [[Radio frequency|RF]] segments that could be split to use for different subchannels.

==Tradeoffs==
As the amount of data which can be carried on one digital television channel at one time is limited, the addition of multiple channels of programming as digital subchannels comes at the expense of having less available bandwidth for other purposes, such as the ability to transmit [[high-definition television|high definition]] content. A station carrying multiple subchannels will normally limit itself to one high-definition channel (or in some cases, two HD channels), with any additional channels being carried in standard definition.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Because of the tradeoffs, stations owned by [[CBS Corporation]] through its [[CBS Television Stations]] subsidiary (which include [[owned-and-operated station]]s of [[CBS]] and [[The CW]], and some [[Independent station (North America)|independent stations]]) generally opted not to carry digital subchannels and transmitted only a 1080i high definition main feed; this changed in 2013 with the addition of dedicated local news channels on CBS O&amp;Os in [[WCBS-TV|New York City]] and [[KYW-TV|Philadelphia]] (the company later announced the creation of [[Decades (TV network)|Decades]], a multicast network part-owned by CBS which now airs on all CBS-owned stations).&lt;ref name=bc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/local-tv/cbs-stations-weigel-partner-oldies-digi-net-decades/134996|title=CBS Stations, Weigel Partner on Oldies Digi-Net Decades|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=October 21, 2014|accessdate=November 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible for stations to carry more than two subchannel feeds in HD, at least nominally. Actual picture quality may be comparable to DVD video. Some examples of stations broadcasting in this format are:

|-
|| [[WGXA]] || [[Macon, Georgia]] || WGXA began carrying ABC programming on its second digital subchannel on January 1, 2010, after [[WPGA-TV]] disaffiliated from the network in a compensation and program content dispute; WGXA transmits its Fox-affiliated main channel and its ABC subchannel in [[720p]] (the native HD resolution format for both networks). The station's main channel is branded as "Fox 24" and maps via PSIP as 24.1, while the ABC subchannel brands as "ABC 16," in reference to the station's physical digital channel 16 (but maps its PSIP virtual channel as 24.2). A standard definition feed of [[Comet (TV network)|Comet]] was launched on its third subchannel in October 2015.

|| [[WKBN-TV]] || [[Youngstown, Ohio]] || WKBN carries a simulcast of Fox-affiliated sister station [[WYFX-LD]] on its second digital subchannel in order to make its programming available to the entire market (WYFX is licensed as a [[low-power broadcasting|low-power]] station), in addition to transmitting CBS programming on its main channel. Both subchannels transmit in [[720p]] HD (in the case of the main channel, this differs from CBS's preferred [[1080i]] HD format). Comparatively, its sister station, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WYTV]] transmits both its MyNetworkTV-affiliated [[WYTV-DT2|second subchannel]] and its [[Bounce TV]]-affiliated third subchannel in standard definition (since ABC and MyNetworkTV both transmit in 720p, the 33.2 subchannel could be reconfigured to high definition in a manner that creates limited issues in regards to bandwidth for the 33.3 subchannel). In 2017, WKBN sold its spectrum for $34 million as part of the FCC's [[spectrum reallocation]] program and will move its broadcasting to WYTV's frequency, limiting more bandwidth to both stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/tv-radio/2017/04/20/FCC-auction-results-pittsburgh-kdka-wqed-frequency/stories/201704200026|title=Big money from FCC auction means end of some TV stations|author=|date=|website=post-gazette.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the United States&amp;nbsp;‚Äì especially in Europe&amp;nbsp;‚Äì high-definition feeds are rarer, and most countries only provide a single high-definition service for each broadcaster.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} For example, in [[T√©l√©vision Num√©rique Terrestre|France]], there are only five HD services: one each for [[TF1]], [[France 2]], [[Canal+]], [[M6 (television channel)|M6]] and [[Arte]]; in the [[Freeview (UK)|United Kingdom]], four HD services are currently transmitted over terrestrial frequencies: [[BBC One HD]], [[BBC Two HD]], [[ITV HD]] and [[Channel 4 HD]] ([[S4C Clirlun]] is broadcast in Wales instead of Channel 4 HD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freeview HD|url=http://www.freeview.co.uk/what-we-offer/freeview-hd|work=[[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]]|accessdate=January 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television applications==
{{Globalize/US|section|date=February 2015}}

===Commercial networks===
In the United States, digital subchannels have been used to provide programming from multiple major networks on a single television station. This has become prevalent since the late 2000s in smaller [[media market|markets]] that have as few as one or two commercial stations, which during the era of analog television, would not have been able to carry the complete programming lineups of all four major commercial networks (CBS, NBC, ABC and Fox) because of the station's own [[local programming|local]] and [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programming commitments, and overlapping network programs that would be tough to schedule outside of regular timeslots. A prime example is the [[Wheeling, West Virginia]]/[[Steubenville, Ohio]] market, which for decades was home to only two stations (CBS affiliate [[WTRF-TV]] and NBC affiliate [[WTOV-TV]]; the cable-only [[The CW Plus|WBWO]] also served the market as a [[The WB|WB]] and now as a CW affiliate) and had to mostly rely on stations in [[Pittsburgh]] (and to a lesser extent [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] and [[Youngstown, Ohio]]) to view programming from other networks. However, the advent of digital television allowed WTRF to launch two digital channels ([[WTRF-DT2|one as a primary Fox/secondary MyNetworkTV affiliate]], [[WTRF-DT3|the other affiliated with ABC]]) while still carrying CBS programming in full on its main signal (WTOV later took the Fox affiliation for its second subchannel in September 2014).&lt;ref name="WTOVFox"/&gt;

Upon their launches in September 2006, The CW and [[MyNetworkTV]] were among the first conventional networks to actively utilize subchannel-only affiliations in markets where a standalone station is not available to affiliate with; this is particularly true of The CW's small-market feed, [[The CW Plus]], which originally consisted mostly of cable-only affiliations (by way of inheriting the model and much of the affiliate body of predecessor [[The WB 100+ Station Group]]). Since its launch, affiliates of other major networks have taken over the operations of cable-only CW Plus affiliates (or even outright replacing WB 100+ cable channels at the launch of The CW) and began transmitting the service over subchannels to reach viewers who do not subscribe to a pay television service. Some Spanish language networks (such as [[MundoFox]], [[Estrella TV]] and [[Mexicanal]]) have also been carried on digital subchannels, either as subchannel-exclusive services or to provide programming to markets where a main channel affiliation may not be available. Other stations have launched subchannels with an independent station format on their DT2 signals (such as [[WTTV]] in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]] ‚Äì a market with enough commercial stations able to support affiliations with all six networks and a standalone independent, although the seventh (WTTK) instead acts as a WTTV [[Broadcast relay station#Satellite stations|satellite]] ‚Äì which converted its 4.2 subchannel as an independent station in January 2015 as a result of owner [[Tribune Media]] selling the local rights to the CW affiliation that was to move from its main feed on 4.1 to [[WISH-TV]], whose CBS affiliation was assumed by WTTV).&lt;ref name=b&amp;c-wishcw8&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malone|first1=Michael|title=Tribune Sells Indianapolis CW Affiliation to Media General|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/local-tv/tribune-sells-indianapolis-cw-affiliation-media-general/136613|accessdate=December 23, 2014|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=December 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WTTV letterman"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lindquist|first1=David|title=With new CW deal, WISH-8 won't be independent in 2015|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/entertainment/arts/2014/12/22/wish-cw-wttv-cbs-indianapolis-affiliation-moonves-wxin-fox/20789337/|accessdate=December 31, 2014|work=[[Indianapolis Star]]|date=December 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital subchannels are also used to relay stations beyond their traditional signal coverage areas to reach an entire market. In the [[Upper Peninsula]] of [[Michigan]] and northern [[Minnesota]], many of these stations are on duplicate frequencies to cover a large market area. This is used to duplicate network service for stations that are part of [[Duopoly (broadcasting)|duopolies]], where transmitters scattered through a large geographical area allow multiple networks and channels to be carried. The most prominent example is the [[Granite Broadcasting Corporation]]'s [[Northland's NewsCenter|virtual quadropoly]] in [[Duluth, Minnesota]], which consists of two separate full-power stations, NBC affiliate [[KBJR-TV]] and CBS affiliate [[KDLH]], which combined carry three subchannels (two affiliated with major networks ‚Äì CW Plus affiliate "[[KDLH-DT2|Northland CW 2]]" on KDLH and MyNetworkTV affiliate "[[KBJR-DT2|My9]]" on KBJR ‚Äì and the third, a local weather subchannel on KBJR). While KDLH carries the CW subchannel on their DT2 feed and KBJR carries the MyNetworkTV subchannel on its DT2 feed on their primary signals, all five channels are carried on [[broadcast relay station#satellite station|satellite station]] [[KRII]] in [[Chisholm, Minnesota|Chisholm]], providing the [[Iron Range]] region (located north of Duluth) programming from networks that were previously unavailable over-the-air. In the [[Traverse City, Michigan|Traverse City]]-[[Cheboygan, Michigan|Cheboygan]] market in Upper Michigan, NBC affiliate [[WPBN-TV|WPBN/WTOM]] also simulcasts sister station [[WGTU|WGTU/WGTQ]], providing that station's ABC programming to the entire market; CBS affiliate [[WWTV|WWTV/WWUP]] carries its Fox-affiliated sister [[WFQX-TV|WFQX/WFUP]] on their DT2 subchannel to expand their coverage area further north into the eastern portion of the Upper Peninsula.

In many cases, these "new" channels are existing secondary channels that were carried by a low-power or [[Class A television service|Class A station]] or by a [[cable television]] channel. Often, the owner of a full-power television station acquires or already owns a low-power secondary station in the same market to carry another network. The use of a digital subchannel on a full-power television station as a replacement for low-power station greatly increases the available coverage area for its programming.

Because of interference issues that stations transmitting on the low [[Very high frequency|VHF]] band (channels 2 to 6) often experience, some stations broadcasting on these frequencies are relayed on the subchannels of stations that are less prone to interference. An example of this is CBS affiliate [[WRGB]] in [[Albany, New York]]. While WRGB broadcasts its main digital on VHF channel 6 in high definition, CW-affiliated [[sister station]] [[WCWN]] relays a standard-definition subchannel feed of WRGB over its digital channel 45.

===Sports programming===
Networks dedicated to sports programming have been launched specifically for use on digital subchannels. Until 2010, CBS affiliates often subdivided four temporary subchannels in order to show all of the early round games of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament]] in addition to those broadcast on the main digital channel (this was superseded as a result of [[NCAA March Madness (CBS/Turner)|a new television agreement]] with the [[National Collegiate Athletics Association|NCAA]] that took effect in 2011, which gave cable networks [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]], [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] and [[TruTV]] partial rights to the tournament). Most of the [[major professional sports league]]s, however, have strict prohibitions against using subchannels for carrying multiple game broadcasts and only allow one game to be aired in a market at one time (outside of Los Angeles, where if the [[Los Angeles Rams|Rams]] and [[Los Angeles Chargers|Chargers]] play at the same time, Fox is allowed to broadcast the second game on MyNetworkTV affiliate [[KCOP-TV]], or CBS on independent [[KCAL-TV]], depending on the game's carrier that specific week); all four of the major sports leagues (the [[National Football League|NFL]], the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], [[Major League Baseball]] and the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]) have [[out-of-market sports package]]s that require a pay television subscription and generate significant revenue for the leagues.

Most sports programming on digital subchannel broadcasters has been relegated to low-budget content such as amateur athletics, extreme sports, and hunting and fishing programming geared toward outdoorsmen, though [[minor league baseball]], [[American Hockey League]] hockey and other minor league sports may also be seen. Prominent team sports programming on digital subchannels is rare; the general trend for sports programming tends to eschew the free-to-air model that digital subchannels use, and the cost of rights fees for most sports requires that they air on channels that air on cable and satellite television services and thus can recuperate costs through [[retransmission consent]]. Channels such as [[Sportsman Channel]] (and the now-defunct [[Universal Sports]]) that began as digital subchannel networks now operate as cable and satellite-exclusive services. There are nonetheless a few multicast channels that have broadcast familiar sports programs: [[Bounce TV]], for instance, carried [[college football]] from [[historically black colleges and universities]] until 2013.

In January 2016, [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]] launched a 24-hour feed of its [[American Sports Network]] sports syndication service on subchannels of ten stations owned and/or operated by the group; the ASN multicast network was subsequently replaced by [[Stadium (sports network)|Stadium]] in August 2017, following the formation of a multi-platform network venture with the [[Chicago White Sox#Silver Chalice subsidiary|Chicago White Sox's Silver Chalice unit]] and [[120 Sports]].

===Local and informational channels===
Although not to the same level as in the late 2000s due to the population of entertainment-based multicast services, many local stations have used or currently use subchannels to carry continuous news or local weather content; in particular, there have been at least four networks that have been created to serve this audience: [[NBC Weather Plus]] (a service exclusive to NBC stations that operated from 2004 to 2008), [[The AccuWeather Channel]], [[WeatherNation TV]] (which also maintains limited exclusive distribution on pay television services) and [[TouchVision]]. Locally programmed news subchannels (such as [[News 9 Now / News on 6 Now]] on [[KWTV-DT|KWTV]] in [[Oklahoma City]] and [[KOTV-DT|KOTV]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] or NewsChannel 5+ on [[WTVF]] in [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]]) often carry rebroadcasts and simulcasts of local news programs seen on the station's main feed, in some cases displaying a [[news ticker|ticker]] with news headlines and weather forecasts to provide updated information.

Subchannels also allow stations to air news programs without fully pre-empting normally scheduled programing on the station's main feed. During significant [[breaking news]] or severe weather events, for instance, a station may choose to air extended news coverage on either its main channel or a subchannel and air network programming on the other. Thus, the station can accommodate viewers wanting to watch either regular programming or news coverage. Some sports leagues, most notably the NFL, have strict rules against their game broadcasts airing on a subchannel.

===Specialty programming===
Since the late 2000s, entertainment-based specialty networks (also known as "diginets") have been created specifically for subchannels, most commonly those dedicated to airing [[rerun]]s of classic television series (such as [[Me-TV]], the [[Retro Television Network]], [[Cozi TV]] and [[Antenna TV]]) and movies (such as [[This TV]], [[GetTV]] and [[Movies!]]). Some networks (such as the African-American focused [[Bounce TV]], the female-targeted [[Escape (TV network)|Escape]] and the male-targeted [[Grit (TV network)|Grit]]) feature programming aimed at specific demographics. With few exceptions (such as Bounce TV and the now-defunct [[Live Well Network]]), diginets typically do not offer first-run original programming, relying on acquired content from programming distributors (most popularly, television series from the 1980s and earlier) to fill their schedules.&lt;ref name="TVNCDiginet2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Classic TV Diginets Make The Old New Again|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/77095/classic-tv-diginets-make-the-old-new-again/page/2|first=Elizabeth|last=Guider|publisher=TVNewsCheck|date=June 18, 2014|accessdate=July 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some stations (such as [[K38IZ-D]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]) carry locally programmed channels offering classic television shows and [[music video]]s on their digital subchannels. With [[MTV]]'s shift away from music videos since the 1990s, subchannel networks focusing entirely on music videos have also been attempted (such as [[ZUUS Country]], [[Heartland (TV network)|Heartland]], [[Tr3s]] and [[TheCoolTV]]), however many have either been unable to gain national coverage or have lost significant market share due to various issues (for example, [[LIN Media]], the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]] and the [[Journal Communications|Journal Broadcast Group]] terminated or opted against renewing deals with TheCoolTV between 2011 and 2013; Journal, in particular, cited TheCoolTV parent Cool Music Network, LLC's failure to pay licensing fees behind its removal of the network in a lawsuit filed against the company in 2011).

Although the revenue potential is limited, many broadcasters have found subchannel-only networks to be a means of generating extra advertising revenue, as they are easily marketable to a given demographic (although they do not enjoy the same [[retransmission consent]] revenue stream from cable providers as other networks do).&lt;ref name="TVNCDiginet1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Diginets Building Themselves A Market|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/77153/payforplay-is-growing-diginet-strategy|author=Elizabeth Guider|publisher=TVNewsCheck|date=June 17, 2014|accessdate=January 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been a few notable holdouts as late as 2014 such as the [[Meredith Corporation]] (only a few of its stations have subchannels, and some of these primarily carry only local news or weather services, or in the case of [[WGGB-TV]]/[[Springfield, Massachusetts]], allows a Fox subchannel affiliate to operate in a market with limited full-power signals traditionally beholden in the past to the [[Hartford, Connecticut]] market to the south for CBS, Fox, WB and UPN affiliates besides WGGB's ABC programming and [[WWLP]]'s NBC affiliation) and the [[Nexstar Media Group|Nexstar Broadcasting Group]] (which previously used subchannels for the sole purposes of simulcasting co-owned/managed sister stations to reach an entire market or to carry programming from major networks in smaller markets, and often eliminated subchannels affiliated with multicast services following station acquisitions). Nexstar has since added multicast services such as Bounce TV and WeatherNation TV on some of its stations. Unlike the major broadcast networks, diginets carried by local stations not associated with the five major networks or MyNetworkTV are often carried on higher cable channel placements (usually within the [[digital cable]] tiers) not readily found by most subscribers.&lt;ref name="TVNCDiginet1"/&gt; Satellite and [[IPTV]] providers generally do not carry multicast networks unless the local station also secondarily carries a major network on that subchannel.

Most diginets reach affiliation agreements with a limited number of station owners prior to launch, before expanding their national coverage through additional deals made after their debut (by comparison, Fox, The CW, MyNetworkTV and to a lesser extent, The WB and [[UPN]], had initial station coverage reaching 60%+ of all U.S. television households through affiliation deals that were largely made before their launches, in order to have wide distribution in at least the top 100 markets). Since the majority of multicast networks are carried on major network affiliates, some full-power stations are recitant about further compressing bitrate space to fit more than one subchannel at the expense of the picture quality of their high-definition main feed. As well, in markets with fewer than six stations, available subchannel space is tighter and some multicast networks may not be able to gain affiliations especially if one of the stations uses a subchannel for the primary purpose of carrying programming from a major network (which are also often transmitted in HD, limiting bitrate space). Some networks remedy this in certain markets by affiliating with low-power stations that do not carry a major network. As of 2014, only 12 primarily subchannel-only networks reach at least 50% of all U.S. markets (with MeTV, which is available in 91% of the country ‚Äî a national reach comparable to the six major commercial networks and PBS ‚Äî being the largest).&lt;ref name="TVNCDiginet1"/&gt;

Diginets with wider national coverage and decent viewership are more likely to attract major advertisers, although most rely on smaller-scale advertisers such as national [[law firm]]s, mortgage providers and [[direct response]] advertisers. Multicast networks often make barter deals to secure affiliations in which advertising inventory is split between the network and the station,&lt;ref name="TVNCDiginet1"/&gt; however some networks enter into subchannel leasing deals (often if they are unable to secure sufficient cable distribution), in which the network handles the sale of advertising inventory and pays its affiliates a monthly licensing fee to carry its programming.&lt;ref name="TVNCDiginet2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TVNCDiginet3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pay-For-Play Is Growing Diginet Strategy|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/77153/payforplay-is-growing-diginet-strategy|first=Kevin|last=Downey|publisher=TVNewsCheck|date=June 19, 2014|accessdate=July 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educational programming===
Many [[PBS]] member stations around the United States broadcast their main channel in high definition and up to three standard definition subchannels; however, a few reconfigure their digital channels depending on daypart, carrying four standard definition channels during the daytime, reducing them to one HD and one SD channel at night due to technical limitations at the station's level that may prevent it from carrying PBS programming in HD full-time and maintain multiple full-time subchannels like other member stations. PBS stations often carry additional national channels such as PBS HD ([[PBS Satellite Service]]), [[PBS Kids]], [[World (TV network)|World]], and [[Create (TV network)|Create]]. In the [[Washington, D.C.]] area, [[MHz Networks]] is available as ten subchannels transmitted by two stations, with their [[virtual channel]]s mapped uniformally, making them appear as if they are transmitted by one station.

In some U.S. states, statewide educational, cultural or [[Public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]] services are carried on a digital subchannel of a PBS member station or network (such as the [[Minnesota Channel]], [[Wisconsin Public Television#Wisconsin Channel|Wisconsin Channel]] or [[New York State]] broadcaster [[ThinkBright TV]]). The use of subchannels has also allowed [[educational television]] broadcasters to sell off former secondary PBS analogue stations to [[commercial broadcasting|commercial broadcasters]] (such as WNEQ in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], which its sister station [[WNED-TV]] sold in 1999 to [[LIN Media|LIN TV]] (now owned by [[Media General]]) to become [[WNLO]], now a CW affiliate), as the additional educational content these separate stations once provided can now be carried by multiple subchannels of a single parent station. Subchannels also allow some educational stations to devote an entire channel to [[distance education|telecourses]], which are recorded by instructors and students for later use, allowing the station's main channel to air a generalized [[broadcast programming|schedule]] in the morning and [[Graveyard slot|overnight hours]].

===Temporary installations===
A digital subchannel can be used to restore service from a station that has been knocked off the air due to an [[antenna tower]] collapse; the affected signal would be made available in standard-definition, or even in compressed high definition, on a subchannel of another local station, most often a competitor. ABC affiliate [[KATV]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] was forced to follow this path in 2008, moving its digital signal to a subchannel of [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate KWBF (now [[KARZ-TV]]) after a [[KATV tower|tower collapse]] knocked its main signal offline. The [[virtual channel]] numbering scheme allows an existing licensed broadcaster to keep its displayed channel number unchanged (in the case of KATV, PSIP channel 7) even if the signal is carried physically as a subchannel of another local station.

During the [[Station Fire (2009)|Station Fire]] in 2009, NBC owned-and-operated station [[KNBC]] in [[Los Angeles]] temporarily replaced programming from [[NBC Weather Plus|NBC Plus]] and [[Universal Sports]] on its subchannels with standard-definition feeds of its two Spanish language sister stations ‚Äì independent station [[KWHY-TV]] (now a MundoFox affiliate, since sold to the Mueriello Group) and Telemundo owned-and-operated station [[KVEA]] ‚Äì as an emergency measure in the event that the transmitters of those stations were destroyed or disabled as the fire reached [[Mount Wilson (California)|Mount Wilson]], where the transmitter facilities of most Los Angeles area stations are based.
&lt;!--===Alternative schedule===
As utilised by [[NHK]] in Japan--&gt;

===Data, radio and non-public signals===
In rare cases, digital television broadcasters have included a service known as [[DTV radio]], in which the audio of a [[duopoly (broadcasting)|commonly owned]] broadcast [[radio station]] is simulcast over a subchannel (for instance, [[KPJK]] in [[San Mateo, California]] broadcasts former FM sister [[KCSM (FM)|KCSM]] on its DT3 signal). [[WANN-CD]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] offers six radio stations owned by [[iHeartMedia]], in addition to ten television channels.

Non-broadcast content, [[pay television|subscription television]] channels or [[datacasting]] operations unrelated to the main television programming are also permitted by the digital television standards but are less-commonly used. [[USDTV]] was an over-the-air [[multichannel video programming distributor|pay television]] service that used [[H.264]] compression instead of standard [[MPEG-2]]. Mobile DTV now uses [[MPEG-4]] compression, which like H.264 yields a much lower [[bitrate]] for the same [[video quality]]. For example, the Sezmi TV/DVR service uses broadcast digital subchannels (not in the clear) in selected cities to stream a limited number of "cable" channels to its subscribers for an additional fee to supplement its otherwise free [[digital video recorder]] (DVR) service allowing recordings of local broadcast channels and free and subscription internet content.

==Technical considerations==
Digital television supports multiple digital subchannels if the 19.39 Mbit/s (megabits per second) [[bitstream]] is divided. Therefore, station managers and [[broadcast engineer]]s could run any of the following scenarios using one 6&amp;nbsp;MHz channel (note that the actual bitrate moves up and down, due to usage of [[variable bitrate]] encoding):

|}

With improvements in MPEG encoding, and tighter [[Variable bitrate|VBR]] encoding, more subchannels can be combined. 1√ó720p + 4√ó480i is becoming more common.

For a [[frame rate]] of 30[[progressive scan|p]] or 60[[interlaced scan|i]], uncompressed DTV channels have the following [[Bit rate|data rate]]s in [[megapixel]]s per second:
{|
|-
! 60&amp;nbsp;Hz !! 50&amp;nbsp;Hz
|-

*640√ó480i60/p30 (NTSC SDTV): 9.216

|}

For [[ATSC]], these must be compressed into 19.4Mbit/s total per physical 6&amp;nbsp;MHz [[Radio frequency|RF]] channel over the air, and 38.8Mbit/s for cable.

==== Segment displays ====
[[Image:Digital clock changing numbers.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Digital clocks display changing numbers.]]
Some displays can show only [[numerical digit|digits]] or [[alphanumeric]] characters. They are called '''segment displays''', because they are composed of several segments that switch on and off to give appearance of desired [[glyph]]. The segments are usually single [[LED]]s or [[LCD|liquid crystals]]. They are mostly used in [[digital watch]]es and [[pocket calculator]]s. There are several types:
[[File:Common segment displays.svg|right|thumb|The common segment displays shown side by side: [[Seven-segment display|7-segment]], [[Nine-segment display|9-segment]], [[Fourteen-segment display|14-segment]] and [[Sixteen-segment display|16-segment]] displays.]]

*[[Seven-segment display]] (most common, digits only)
*[[Fourteen-segment display]]
*[[Sixteen-segment display]]
*[[Hitachi HD44780 LCD controller|HD44780 LCD controller]] a widely accepted protocol for LCDs.

*[[Vacuum fluorescent display]]
*[[Cold cathode]] gas discharge
*[[Light-emitting diode]] (LED)
*[[Liquid-crystal display|Liquid crystal display]] (LCD)
* Physical vane with electromagnetic activation

==== Full-area 2-dimensional displays ====
[[2-dimensional]] displays that cover a full area (usually a [[rectangle]]) are also called '''video displays''', since it is the main modality of presenting [[video]].

===== Applications of full-area 2-dimensional displays =====
Full-area 2-dimensional displays are used in, for example:

*[[Television set]]
*[[Computer monitor]]s
*[[Head-mounted display]]
*[[Broadcast reference monitor]]
*[[Medical monitor]]s

===== Underlying technologies of full-area 2-dimensional displays =====
Underlying technologies for full-area 2-dimensional displays include:

*[[Cathode ray tube]] display (CRT)
*[[Light-emitting diode display]] (LED)
*[[Electroluminescent display]] (ELD)
*[[Electronic paper]], [[E Ink]]
*[[Plasma display]] panel (PDP)
*[[Liquid-crystal display|Liquid crystal display]] (LCD)
**[[High-Performance Addressing]] display (HPA)
**[[Thin-film transistor]] display (TFT)
*[[Organic light-emitting diode]] display (OLED)
*[[Digital Light Processing]] display (DLP)
*[[Surface-conduction electron-emitter display]] (SED) (experimental)

'''EnCor Biotechnology''' is a [[United States]] company that manufactures [[antibodies]] to [[neural]] and [[yeast]] [[proteins]]. Founded in 1999 as a spin-off from the [[University of Florida]] by Gerry Shaw, a British scientist and professor at the University of Florida, the company is based in [[Gainesville, Florida]] and markets antibody [[reagents]] originally made for research purposes, but which also have commercial value.

==History==
EnCor Biotechnology was formed in at the end of 1999 to market antibody [[reagents]] originally made for research purposes, but which also had some commercial potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gainesville.com/article/20030124/BUSINESS/201240331 |title=Biotech venture &amp;#124; Gainesville.com |work=gainesville.com |year=2012 |accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later EnCor moved into rented lab space at the [[Sid Martin Biotechnology Incubator]], a facility dedicated to commercialization of intellectual property generated in the University of Florida. The company quickly become profitable and, in 2006, relocated to new premises in Gainesville.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gainesville.com/article/20070203/LOCAL/702020340?p=2&amp;tc=pg |title=UF professor's biotech firm graduates &amp;#124; Gainesville.com |work=gainesville.com |year=2012 |accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Farm Forward''' is a 501(c)(3) [[nonprofit organization]] that seeks to promote conscientious eating, reduce suffering for farmed animals, and advance sustainable agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guidestar.org/profile/26-1643614|title=Farm Forward, Inc. - GuideStar Profile|website=www.guidestar.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 2007 by its current CEO, Aaron Gross, Ph. D., whose main work has been in animal advocacy, as well as in the emerging scholarly field of animals and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sandiego.edu/cas/theology/faculty-and-staff/biography.php?profile_id=330|title=Biography - Aaron Gross -  College of Arts and Sciences - University of San Diego|website=www.sandiego.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farm Forward is an animal advocacy group that is dedicated to the welfare of farmed animals, working to ensure that farmed animals are treated in a way that is humane and sustainable. In addition to working with farmers and other animal advocacy groups, Farm Forward works with farmers, animal advocacy groups, and various institutions in order to encourage consumers to seek out animal products that promote animal welfare and sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/farm-forward/2014-dec/|title=Farm Forward Review {{!}} Animal Charity Evaluators|work=Animal Charity Evaluators|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campaigns ==

=== Buying Poultry ===
Buying Poultry is a website that was launched by Farm Forward in 2015 with the goal of empowering consumers to purchase poultry products that align with their values. Buying Poultry is a national database that rates poultry products based on how humanely the chickens were treated on their farms. It describes the different labels that are associated with these products, and explains what these labels entail in the industry, so that consumers may be better informed about the products they buy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/grade-a-chicken-heres-a-new-way-to-size-up-poultry-2015-11-18|title=Grade A chicken? Here‚Äôs a new way to size up poultry|last=Shaw|first=Jessica Marmor|work=MarketWatch|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the website, a number of poultry products are assessed in accordance with their welfare certifications‚Äï[[About:blank|Animal Welfare Approved (AWA)]],[[About:blank|Certified Humane]], and [[About:blank|Global Animal Partnership (GAP)]]‚Äïand the various labels that are associated with the products.

Ultimately, the primary aim of the Buying Poultry website is to increase the demand for humane and sustainable poultry products through consumers. Accordingly, it is meant to bring about an increase in the supply for such products, while simultaneously decreasing both supply and demand for standard industry poultry products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://foodtechconnect.com/2015/12/23/buyingpoultry-helps-eaters-make-informed-choices/|title=BuyingPoultry Helps Eaters Make Informed Choices {{!}} Food+Tech Connect|date=2015-12-23|work=Food+Tech Connect|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Buying Mayo ===
Buying Mayo was a campaign launched in 2014 by Farm Forward against Best Food and Hellman's mayonnaise, both of which are owned by Unilever. At the time, Best Foods and Hellmann‚Äôs were participating in the practice of maceration, the process of sending male birds of the egg laying genetic strain to their deaths shortly after they hatch due to their inability to lay eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halteman|first=M.|date=2011|title=Varieties of Harm to Animals in Industrial Farming|url=|journal=Journal of Animal Ethics|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the Buying Mayo campaign was to convince Best Foods and Hellmann‚Äôs to end this practice.
The Buying Mayo campaign succeeded in convincing Best Foods and Hellmann‚Äôs to end its use of maceration. It did this in two ways. First, it started a petition that demanded the companies to find other ways to deal with these male chicks than maceration. Second, it posted two videos with essentially the same message as the petition. These resulted in a promise by Unilever (Best Foods and Hellmann‚Äôs parent company) to seek alternatives to maceration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://buyingmayo.com/|title=Dear Hellmann's and Best Foods: We want to trust our food|website=Buying Mayo|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ag-gag Legislation ===
Ag-gag state legislation is aimed at punishing participants of undercover farm investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/26/who-protects-the-animals/|title=Who Protects the Animals?|last=Bittman|first=Mark|work=Opinionator|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Farm Forward launched a campaign to prevent ag-gag laws from being made. It established a website, ag-gag.org, to gather public opposition to ag-gag. Between 2012 and March 2016, 16 states introduced ag-gag bills which failed to be implemented. Still, other states have succeeded in passing ag-gag bills, some of which are currently in effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aspca.org/animal-protection/public-policy/what-ag-gag-legislation|title=What Is Ag-Gag Legislation?|work=ASPCA|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Idaho successfully passed an ag-gag bill. As a response to this, Farm Forward joined a coalition of animal protection organizations, civil rights groups, and media outlets to file a lawsuit against Idaho in federal court. The result of this lawsuit was that Idaho‚Äôs ag-gag laws were ruled unconstitutional due to infringement of the first amendment. According to University of Denver Law professor Justin Marceau, ‚Äú[the ruling] means that these laws all over the country are in real danger.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/08/04/429345939/idaho-strikes-down-ag-gag-law-raising-questions-for-other-states|title=Judge Strikes Down Idaho 'Ag-Gag' Law, Raising Questions For Other States|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farm Forward, along with the coalition it joined, continues to fight ag-gag across the United States.

=== Religious outreach ===
Farm Forward is working alongside the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) on the Faith in Food initiative. This initiative is meant to reach out to various religious institutions in order to motivate them to create ethical food policies that address animal welfare in accordance with their specific faiths and values.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/about/departments/faith/animals_and_religion.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/|title=Animals and Religion : The Humane Society of the United States|website=www.humanesociety.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through its religious outreach, Farm Forward helped to arrange a partnership between the HSUS and Hazon. Through their partnerships, the two groups hope to promote compassionate food choices, especially in the Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/animals-wildlife/2015/11/2/holy-cow-how-this-funder-found-religion-in-farm-animals.html|title=Holy Cow: How This Funder Found Religion in Farm Animals|work=Inside Philanthropy|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to reaching out to religious institutions, Farm Forward also supports publications that encourage scholarly discussions of the role of animals in religion. CEO Aaron Gross‚Äô ''The Question of the Animal and Religion'', David Clough‚Äôs ''On Animals Volume 1'', and Jonathan Safran Foer‚Äôs ''Eating Animals'' are some of the books supported by Farm Forward for their promotions of animals as religious subjects.

One particular part of Farm Forward's religious outreach is the Jewish Initiative for Animals (JIFA). JIFA is a Farm Forward initiative that aims at educating the Jewish community on the ethics of factory farming and encouraging Jewish institutions to promote eating policies that elevate animal welfare as a significant Jewish value. JIFA urges these institutions to act in any way they can to promote animal welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/2016/01/17/life-religion/the-countrys-tastiest-chicken-will-soon-be-kosher|title=The country‚Äôs tastiest chicken will soon be kosher {{!}} Jewish Telegraphic Agency|website=www.jta.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; JIFA focuses particularly on Jewish institutions that serve animal products in order to assist them in lowering meat consumption and finding higher welfare sources. It also helps these institutions establish new supply chains so that their animal products will support more humane farming methods.

=== Eating Animals ===
Eating Animals is a non-fiction novel written in collaboration with Farm Forward by one of its current board members, Jonathan Safran Foer. Eating Animals provides a discussion of the many consequences that have followed the proliferation of factory farms. Moreover, it attempts to explain why and how humans can be so loving to some animals while simultaneously being indifferent to others,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/11/09/flesh-of-your-flesh|title=Flesh of Your Flesh|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and explores what this inconsistency tells us about ourselves. The book offers a significant emphasis on ‚Äústorytelling,‚Äù which is the title of both the first and the last chapters of the book. This is Foer‚Äôs way of recognizing and dealing with the complexity of the subject that is eating animals, and suggests that, ultimately, ‚Äústories about food are stories about us‚Äïour history and our values.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Eating Animals|last=Foer|first=Jonathan Safran|publisher=|year=|isbn=978-0-316-08664-6|location=|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Farm Forward, Eating Animals is a way to bring people into a discussion about the current state of animal agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/aaron-gross/jonathan-safran-foers-con_b_333698.html|title=Jonathan Safran Foer's Controversial New Book, Eating Animals|last=Gross|first=Aaron|date=2010-03-18|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farm Forward encourages the use of Eating Animals as an educational tool for classrooms around the world, reaching out to colleges and high schools to suggest an inclusion of the book into the classroom. Farm Forward organizes annual ‚Äúvirtual classroom visits‚Äù with Jonathan Safran Foer, during which classrooms all over the world discuss the prevailing themes of animal and food ethics found in Eating Animals.

The book was adapted and extended into a 2018 documentary film with the same name, directed by [[Christopher Dillon Quinn]] and co-narrated by Foer and [[Natalie Portman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/movies/eating-animals-review.html|title=Review: ‚ÄòEating Animals‚Äô Skewers Factory Farming|last=Kenigsberg|first=Ben|date=2018-06-14|work=New York Times|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the book, the documentary is meant to explore contemporary animal agriculture alongside the complexities of food ethics. Farm Forward hopes to see this documentary expand the reach of Eating Animals‚Äô message so that more people think of eating animals in new ways.

'''Flexible glass''' is a legendary [[lost invention]] from the time of the reign of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Tiberius Caesar]] (between 14‚Äì37 AD). As recounted by [[Isidore of Seville]], the craftsman who invented the technique brought a drinking bowl made of flexible glass before Caesar who tried to break it, whereupon the material [[Indentation hardness|dented]], rather than [[wikt:shatter|shattering]]. The inventor then repaired the bowl easily with a small [[hammer]]. After the inventor swore to the Emperor that he alone knew the technique of manufacture, Tiberius had the man [[behead]]ed, fearing such material could undermine the value of [[gold]] and [[silver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The story of the sad fate of the inventor of [[unbreakable glass]] (vitrum flexile) at the hands of [[Tiberius]] (42 BC‚Äì37 AD) was first related by two more-or-less contemporary compilers, namely [[Petronius]] (c. 27‚Äì66 AD, ''[[Satyricon]]'' 51) and [[Pliny the Elder]] (23‚Äì79 AD, Naturalis Historia XXXVI.lxvi.195). Pliny apparently did not believe in vitrum flexile, remarking that the story is, "more frequently told than it is reliable". [[Cassius Dio]] (c. AD 150‚Äì235, Historia Romana 57.21.7) also told a similar story, writing that ‚Äòan architect whose name no one knows‚Äô whom Tiberius had exiled out of jealousy for his skill, ‚Äòapproached him to crave pardon, and while doing so purposely let fall a crystal goblet; and though it was bruised in some way or shattered, yet by passing his hands over it he promptly exhibited it whole once more. For this he hoped to obtain pardon, but instead the emperor put him to death.‚Äô The story was picked up and retold by [[Isidore of Seville]] (c. 560‚Äì636, Etymologiae XVI.16.6, ‚ÄòDe vitro‚Äô). Subsequently the 13th century collection of technical recipes by the pseudo-Heraclius included this story, in the section treating glass recipes, using Isidore‚Äôs own words (De coloribus et artibus Romanorum III.vi [256]). This is thus an example of ‚Äòtechnical knowledge‚Äô wending its way from historical gossip (Petronius), to a technical encyclopaedia (Pliny, with reservations), and then via a philological text (Isidore) to a collection of practical craft recipes (pseudo-Heraclius).

[[Image:IdealMixer.svg|thumb|350px|Frequency mixer symbol]]

In [[electronics]], a '''mixer''', or '''frequency mixer''', is a [[nonlinear]] electrical circuit that creates new frequencies from two signals applied to it. In its most common application, two signals are applied to a mixer, and it produces new signals at the sum and difference of the original frequencies.  Other frequency components may also be produced in a practical frequency mixer.

Mixers are widely used to shift signals from one frequency range to another, a process known as [[heterodyning]], for convenience in transmission or further signal processing. For example, a key component of a [[superheterodyne receiver]] is a mixer used to move received signals to a common [[intermediate frequency]]. Frequency mixers are also used to [[modulation|modulate]] a [[carrier signal]] in [[Transmitter|radio transmitters]].

==Types==
The essential characteristic of a mixer is that it produces a component in its output which is the product of the two input signals.  A device that has a non-linear (e.g. [[exponential function|exponential]]) characteristic can act as a mixer. Passive mixers use one or more diodes and rely on their non-linear relation between voltage and current to provide the multiplying element. In a passive mixer, the desired output signal is always of lower power than the input signals.

Active mixers use an amplifying device (such as a transistor or vacuum tube) to increase the strength of the product signal. Active mixers improve isolation between the ports, but may have higher noise and more power consumption. An active mixer can be less tolerant of overload.

Mixers may be built of discrete components, may be part of integrated circuits, or can be delivered as hybrid modules.

[[File:Diode DBM.png|thumb|right|Schematic diagram of a double-balanced passive diode mixer (also known as a [[ring modulator]]). There is no output unless both f1 and f2 inputs are present, though f2 (but not f1) can be DC.]]
Mixers may also be classified by their topology:  
*An ''unbalanced mixer,'' in addition to producing a product signal, allows both input signals to pass through and appear as components in the output. 
*A ''single balanced mixer'' is arranged with one of its inputs applied to a balanced ([[differential amplifier|differential]]) circuit so that either the local oscillator (LO) or signal input (RF) is suppressed at the output, but not both. 
*A ''double balanced mixer'' has both its inputs applied to differential circuits, so that neither of the input signals and only the product signal appears at the output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Poole|first=Ian|title=Double balanced mixer tutorial|url=http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/rf-technology-design/mixers/double-balanced-mixer-tutorial.php|publisher=Adrio Communications|accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Double balanced mixers are more complex and require higher drive levels than unbalanced and single balanced designs. 
Selection of a mixer type is a trade off for a particular application.

Mixer circuits are characterized by their properties such as conversion [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] (or loss), and [[noise figure]].&lt;ref&gt;D.S. Evans, G. R. Jessop, ''VHF-UHF Manual Third Edition'', [[Radio Society of Great Britain]], 1976, page 4-12&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonlinear electronic components that are used as mixers include [[diode]]s, [[transistor]]s biased near cutoff, and at lower frequencies, [[analog multiplier]]s.   [[Inductor|Ferromagnetic-core inductors]] driven into [[saturation (magnetic)|saturation]] have also been used.  In [[nonlinear optics]], crystals with nonlinear characteristics are used to mix two frequencies of laser light to create [[Optical heterodyne detection|optical heterodynes]].

===Diode===
A [[diode]] can be used to create a simple unbalanced mixer. This type of mixer produces the original frequencies as well as their sum and their difference.  The significant property of the diode here is its non-linearity (or non-[[Ohm's law|Ohmic]] behavior), which means its response (current) is not proportional to its input (voltage).  The diode does not reproduce the frequencies of its driving voltage in the current through it, which allows the desired frequency manipulation. 
The current ''I'' through an ideal diode as a function of the voltage ''V'' across it is given by
:&lt;math&gt;I=I_\mathrm{S} \left( e^{qV_\mathrm{D} \over nkT}-1 \right)&lt;/math&gt;
where what is important is that ''V'' appears in ''e'''s exponent.  The exponential can be [[Taylor series|expanded]] as
:&lt;math&gt;e^x = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!}&lt;/math&gt;
and can be approximated for small ''x'' (that is, small voltages) by the first few terms of that series:
:&lt;math&gt;e^x-1\approx x + \frac{x^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose that the sum of the two input signals &lt;math&gt;v_1+v_2&lt;/math&gt; is applied to a diode, and that an output voltage is generated that is proportional to the current through the diode (perhaps by providing the voltage that is present across a [[resistor]] in series with the diode).  Then, disregarding the constants in the diode equation, the output voltage will have the form
:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{o} = (v_1+v_2)+\frac12 (v_1+v_2)^2 + \dots&lt;/math&gt;
The first term on the right is the original two signals, as expected, followed by the square of the sum, which can be rewritten as &lt;math&gt;(v_1+v_2)^2 = v_1^2 + 2 v_1 v_2 + v_2^2&lt;/math&gt;, where the multiplied signal is obvious.  The ellipsis represents all the higher powers of the sum which we assume to be negligible for small signals.

Suppose that two input sinusoids of different frequencies are fed into the diode, such that &lt;math&gt;v_1=\sin at&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_2=\sin bt&lt;/math&gt;. The signal &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt; becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{o} = (\sin at +\sin bt)+\frac12 (\sin at +\sin bt)^2 + \dots&lt;/math&gt;
Expanding the square term yields: 
:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{o} = (\sin at +\sin bt)+\frac12 (\sin^2 at + 2 \sin at \sin bt + \sin^2 bt) + \dots&lt;/math&gt;
Ignoring all terms except for the &lt;math&gt;\sin at \sin bt&lt;/math&gt; term and utilizing the [[prosthaphaeresis]] (product to sum) identity, 
:&lt;math&gt;\sin a \sin b = \frac{\cos(a - b) - \cos(a + b)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
yields, 
:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{o} = \cos((a-b)t)-\cos((a+b)t) + \dots&lt;/math&gt;
demonstrating how new frequencies are created from the mixer.

===Switching===
Another form of mixer operates by switching, with the smaller input signal being passed inverted or non inverted according to the phase of the local oscillator (LO). This would be typical of the normal operating mode of a packaged double balanced mixer, with the local oscillator drive considerably higher than the signal amplitude.

The aim of a switching mixer is to achieve linear operation over the signal level by means of hard switching driven by the local oscillator. Mathematically the switching mixer is not much different from a multiplying mixer, just because instead of the LO sine wave term we would use the signum function. In the frequency domain the switching mixer operation leads to the usual sum and difference frequencies, but also to further terms e.g. ¬±3''f''&lt;sub&gt;LO&lt;/sub&gt;, ¬±5''f''&lt;sub&gt;LO&lt;/sub&gt;, etc.
The advantage of a switching mixer is that it can achieve (with the same effort) a lower noise figure (NF) and larger conversion gain. This is because the switching diodes or transistors act either like a small resistor (switch closed) or large resistor (switch open), and in both cases only a minimal noise is added. From the circuit perspective, many multiplying mixers can be used as switching mixers, just by increasing the LO amplitude. So RF engineers simply talk about mixers and mean switching mixers.

The mixer circuit can be used not only to shift the frequency of an input signal as in a receiver, but also as a [[product detector]], [[modulator]], [[phase detector]] or frequency multiplier.&lt;ref name=Horowitz89&gt;Paul Horowitz, Winfred Hill ''[[The Art of Electronics]] Second Edition'', Cambridge University Press 1989, pp. 885‚Äì887.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a [[communications receiver]] might contain two mixer stages for conversion of the input signal to an intermediate frequency and another mixer employed as a detector for demodulation of the signal.

'''George A. Cowan''' ({{IPAc-en|k|a ä|…ô|n}}; February 15, 1920&amp;nbsp;‚Äì April 20, 2012) was an [[United States|American]] [[Physical chemistry|physical chemist]], a businessman and philanthropist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/science-obituaries/9312506/George-Cowan.html |title=George Cowan |newspaper=Telegraph |date=5 Jun 2012 |accessdate=2012-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
He conducted early research in the [[Manhattan Project]]. George served 39 years at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] as director of chemistry, associate director of research and senior laboratory fellow. He participated in founding the Santa Fe Opera in 1953. He founded the Los Alamos National Bank in 1963 to provide a means to obtain housing for Los Alamos employees and served for 30 years as its chair. He was also the driving influence in founding the [[Santa Fe Institute]] together with Nobel Prize winner [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and others in 1984, based upon his recognition of the need for a place where scientists could be offered a broader curriculum for the development of "a kind of twenty-first century Renaissance man" and associated research. A graduate of [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] (bachelor of science in Chemistry) and [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] (doctorate of science), [[Princeton University]], and the [[University of Chicago]], he worked on the top secret [[Manhattan Project]] at Los Alamos during [[World War II]]. He received the [[Enrico Fermi Award]] for "a lifetime of exceptional achievement in the development and use of energy," the New Mexico Academy of Science Distinguished Scientist Award, the Robert H. Goddard Award, the E.O. Lawrence Award, and the Los Alamos National Laboratory Medal, which is the highest honor the Laboratory bestows upon an individual or small group.

== Biography ==
Cowan was born in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]].  In 1941, at the age of twenty one, after graduating from [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] in chemistry, he worked on the [[cyclotron]] project at [[Princeton University]] with the intention of taking graduate courses in physics.  He worked there with future Nobel Prize Laureate [[Eugene Wigner]], who would design the first uranium chain reactor. In 1941, George participated in taking measurements essential to determining whether the chain reaction in [[uranium]] could be achieved. His knowledge of chemistry and nuclear physics experience provided expertise on a number of things necessary to the Manhattan Project. In 1942, Wigner, Cowan, and several others transferred to the Metallurgy Lab at the University of Chicago where the first [[atomic pile]] was being developed under [[Enrico Fermi]]. Starting as a junior member, Cowan became a jack-of-all-trades, capable of such skills as machining graphite blocks used for control of the pile's reaction rate and in casting uranium metal. In 1942, the Chicago Pile 1 (CP-1) generated the first controlled nuclear reaction. This controlled release of energy from the nucleus of the atom enabled development of a method to obtain nuclear fuel for the first atomic weapons.  His experience made him one of the experts on the chemistry of radioactive elements in the field of applied nuclear fission. Since he was single and in possession of high expertise, project managers transferred him around the nation to help resolve bottlenecks. He was one of the select group with knowledge of the separate components of the project, kept separate for security reasons. He received a draft deferment from the president of the United States for possessing skills uniquely useful to the war effort.

==Career==
Following the end of the war and obtaining his PhD in physical chemistry from Carnegie Tech, Cowan returned to work for Los Alamos in 1950. Only weeks after his arrival, he directed the detection of radioactive fallout from samples collected near the Russian border indicating the Soviets were in possession of a nuclear bomb. He also participated for some years in the Bethe Panel, whose first chairman was [[Hans Bethe]]. One of his early participatory functions on the panel was to convince U.S. government officials that the radiochemistry of the samples proved that it was not the result of a peaceful nuclear reactor problem, but a Soviet bomb, which was dubbed "Joe-1" after [[Joseph Stalin]].

In 1953, Cowan was a member of the group which founded the Santa Fe Opera. Another member of this group was Arthur Spiegel, of the [[Spiegel Catalog]] fortune.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;!-- That Arthur Spiegel died in 1916! Perhaps he had a son by the same name? -DadaNeem--&gt; Art was later to help Cowan in his initial fund raising efforts to finance the Santa Fe Institute.

In 1982, Cowan accepted a seat on the White House Service Council. While serving in this capacity and facing problems involving interlinked aspects of science, policy, economics, environment and more, he realized that this demanded a broad range expertise above the current reductionist approach and fragmentation of the sciences. He believed that our educational culture was enforcing intellectual fragmentation through conservative university programs that depended on specialized grants and funded work. It seemed that cross-disciplinary team efforts were discouraged by membership in traditional, isolated science and social science disciplines. He knew that beginning in the 1980s numerical experiments through computer simulations were capable of providing the tools to think about very complex problems in a more holistic fashion. He began to imagine a new and independent type of institute that would combine the charter of a university while sharing some of Los Alamos' personnel and computer power. This could be a place where senior researchers would have a place to work on very speculative ideas. Where one could educate a man starting in science, but that could deal with the real messy world, which is not elegant, which science doesn't really deal with. In 1983, Cowan assembled a group of senior scientists interested in researching complex, adaptive systems. One year later, this assembly became the [[Santa Fe Institute]]. Initial funding came from the [[National Science Foundation]], the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], [[Citicorp]] and others. George was enthusiastic about [[complex system]]s, which he declared to be the next major thrust in science. The Santa Fe Institute fosters interdisciplinary research between physicists, mathematicians, economists, computer scientists, and others. Although most of his duties as president did not allow time for research, as Distinguished Fellow of the Institute, Cowan applied neuroscience principles to investigate relationships between children's brain physiological changes and behavioral development.

==Later life==
In 1988, Cowan became a senior fellow emeritus at Los Alamos, a member of a group of six longtime Los Alamos employees rewarded with research positions free from administrative chores that would also advise the laboratory director on policy issues.  Cowan served as president of the Santa Fe Institute until his retirement in 1991.

==Death==
{{expand section|date=April 2012}}
Cowan died on April 20, 2012 from complications of pneumonia in his Los Alamos home.

A '''grapple''' is a hook or [[wikt:claw|claw]] used to catch or hold something.  A ship's [[anchor]] is a type of grapple, especially the  [[anchor#Grapnel|"grapnel" anchor]].

[[File:MS812-3.gif|thumb|A soldier loading a hook.]]
A '''throwing grapple''' (or "[[grappling hook]]") is a multi-pronged hook that is tied to a rope and thrown to catch a grip, as on a parapet or branch of a tree.  It may also be used in a boat to "drag" the bottom of a waterway to hook debris or to find missing objects.

[[File:Grapple truck.png|thumb|Grapple truck]]
In [[logging]] and other [[engineering vehicle]]s, a grapple is a [[hydraulic machinery|hydraulically]] powered claw with two or more opposing [[lever]]s that [[pinch (action)|pinch]] a [[Wooden log|log]] or other materials, usually to [[forwarder|lift]] or drag them.

The logging grapple used in swing yarding is not moved by hydraulics but by cables. To open and close the tongs of the grapple, two cables are used. One is tensioned and the other is slacked off to move the tongs.  A third cable goes back to the tail hold then to the yarder. This third cable is used to pull the grapple out into the setting and to create tension for lifting the grapple in the air.  

A grapple can be mounted to a [[tractor]] or [[excavator]] with a movable arm that may lift, extend/retract, and move side-to-side (pivot or rotate). Some machines also have a separate control for rotating the grapple.  

Simpler grapple machines consist of a hydraulically liftable fork, rake ("grapple rake"), or bucket and a movable, opposing "thumb" (one or more hooks or levers) that enclose and grip materials for lifting or dragging. A "demolition bucket" or "multi-purpose bucket" on a loader may also operate as a grapple whereby the bottom and rear side of the bucket are hinged and can be forced apart or together with [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] cylinders.

A '''lifting grapple''' is a type of [[Household hardware|hardware]] that can be attached to most large, heavy, or bulky objects to provide a feature on the item to which material handling equipment can attach.  Lifting grapples sometimes double as tie downs, allowing heavy items to be held firmly in place by providing a point to which ropes or chains can be attached to the item to hold it in place.

The term ''grapple'' is also used in the [[surfboard]] industry to refer to a leash connector.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="866">'''IC programming'''&lt;ref name="techno"&gt;Depending on the context, just programming or the type of IC may also be used&lt;/ref&gt; is the process of transferring a [[computer program]] into an integrated computer circuit.  Older types of IC including [[Programmable read-only memory|PROMs]] and [[EPROM]]s and some early [[programmable logic]] was typically programmed through parallel busses that used many of the device's pins and basically required inserting the device in a separate programmer.

Modern ICs are typically programmed in circuit though a [[Serial communications|serial]] protocol (sometimes [[JTAG]] sometimes something manufacturer specific).  Some (particularly [[FPGA]]s) even load the data serially from a separate flash or prom chip on every startup.

'''ISOFOTON''' was a global company, present in over 60 countries. ISOFOTON was involved in designing, manufacturing, and supplying [[Solar Energy]] products. Its activities were centered in three technology categories: [[Photovoltaic]], [[Solar thermal energy|Thermal]], and High Concentration Photovoltaic.

==History==
ISOFOTON was founded in [[M√°laga]] ([[Spain]]) in 1981 as a [[University spin-off|spin-off]] of a university project driven by Professor D. [[Antonio Luque L√≥pez|Antonio Luque]] of the [[Polytechnic University of Madrid]], its first Chairman of the Board.

In 1985 ISOFOTON consolidated its activities in the [[solar energy]] field, incorporating the production technology of [[Solar thermal collector|thermal collectors]].

In 1997 the Berg√© Group became the owner of ISOFOTON.
In July 2007 the Alba Corporation bought 26% of the company with the intention of joining the [[stock market]].

From 2000 to 2005 ISOFOTON ranked among the [https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2014/01/top-ten-pv-manufacturers-from-2000-to-present-a-pictorial-retrospective.html world's top 10 photovoltaic manufacturers]

In February 2008, company [[CEO]] Jos√© Luis Manzano was relieved from duty. Carlos Torres, former managing director of [[Endesa (Spain)|Endesa]], took his place.

In July of the same year, the Berg√© Group bought back 26% of ISOFOTON, property of Alba Corporation.

In July 2010 ISOFOTON was acquired by AFFIRMA Business Group (80% ownership)and TOPTEC (20% ownership), a [[South Korea]]n company that specializes in [[industrial automation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.enf.cn/en/news/news_15462.html |title=Consortium AFFIRMA-TOPTEC acquired ISOFOTON |first= |last= |author=ISOFOTON |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |month= |year= |work= |publisher=ENF Solar |location= |page= |pages= |at= |trans-title=|doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the company was investigated for inappropriate use of public funds and approached bankruptcy, finally closed down its facilities in January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Total Eclipse of the sun |url=http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/06/17/inenglish/1371471362_164500.html |accessdate=August 1, 2014|publisher= El Pais}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Isofoton's Malaga factory faces closure |url=http://www.pv-tech.org/news/isofotons_malaga_factory_faces_closure |accessdate=August 1, 2014|publisher= PV Tech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factory==
The factory in [[M√°laga]] had more than 28000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of facilities and is located in the [[Andalusia Technology Park]]. 
Production did include:
* Conventional [[photovoltaic modules]] and trackers
* High concentration modules (HCPV)

==Research and Development==
ISOFOTON worked in collaboration with universities and research centers in [[Spain]] and around the world. Among its principal strategic alliances, they have agreements with companies such as INDRA for the development of [[Solar tracker|trackers]] designed for HCPV modules, or the ISFOC for research in this field.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Many research projects held by ISOFOTON had an international dimension. ISOFOTON was involved in several projects in the [[Seventh Framework Programme|FP7]] (Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development). One of them is related to high concentration photovoltaic technology and three are dedicated to [[silicon]] technology.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Bankruptcy==
2015, the company went bankrupt and its remaining assets, which were valued at 57 millions, were auctioned to cover a debt of 160 millions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.diariosur.es/economia/empresas-malaguenas/201502/16/como-venderse-isofoton-20150216133325.html|title=¬øC√≥mo va a venderse Isofot√≥n?|date=2015-02-17|work=Diario Sur|access-date=2018-07-20|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Juris George Mikelsons''' (Latvian: '''Georgs Juris Miƒ∑elsons''') is a former airline executive and airline pilot in the [[United States]] and the founder of [[ATA Airlines]]. He was born in [[Riga]], [[Latvia]], in 1938 on the eve of [[World War II]]. His family fled to [[Germany]] during the mid-1940s to escape the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] occupation of his native land.

==Early years==
As a child, Mikelsons would peer out of bomb shelters to catch any glimpse he could of the planes being flown in the skies. This was the birth of his passion in life, which was to fly planes. His family moved to [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], during the 1950s where his father was offered a job as a [[violin]]ist for the [[Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra]].

Mikelsons finally began pursuing his passion when he saw a sign offering flights for under $10. It was then that he flew for the first time. This flight sparked his desire to enter the [[aviation]] industry. He immediately began flying lessons and became chief [[aviator|pilot]] and [[executive director|director]] of the ''Voyager 1000 travel club''.

==Founding of ATA Airlines==
In 1973, Mikelsons started his own travel club, ''Ambassadair'', taking a loan and mortgaging his home to purchase a [[Boeing 720]], which he titled "Miss Indy". Ambassadair was a [[charter airline|charter]]-based airline which provided cheap vacation fares. Mikelsons and an employee piloted the plane, loaded the luggage, cleaned the cabin, and served as the tour guide. His hard work and determination allowed him to purchase additional planes for his charter-based airline service. In 1984, after the deregulation of the Airline industry, Mikelsons formed Amtran, Inc., the former parent company of American Trans Air, which later became [[ATA Airlines]], headquartered near [[Indianapolis International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About ATA |publisher=[[ATA Airlines]] |url=http://www.ata.com/about_ata/company_information/facts.html |accessdate=2008-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105105047/http://ata.com/about_ata/company_information/facts.html |archivedate=January 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also formed ATA Leisure Corp., Amber Travel, ATA Training Corp., ATA Cargo, and ExecuJet.

In 1993, ATA made its initial public offering, trading on the [[NASDAQ]] National Market System under the symbol '''"AMTR"'''. Mikelsons, a noted conservative always notorious for putting his money where his mouth is, purchased a 75% stake in the company. In 1998, Mikelsons retired, giving the reigns of the company to John Tague. Tague began a massive expansion with new aircraft and the establishment of a hub at Chicago's Midway airport. After the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]] in 2001, the slump in airline travel and rising fuel costs severely impacted ATA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505123_162-43640973/a-look-at-john-tague-new-president-of-united-airlines/ A Look at John Tague, New President of United Airlines - CBS News]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mikelsons came out of retirement to save his troubled airline despite his archaic managerial style.  Many of ATA's finest leaders left because of this.  ATA emerged from bankruptcy on February 28, 2006 &lt;ref name=ATAhist&gt;{{cite web |title=ATA History |publisher=[[ATA Airlines]] |url=http://www.ata.com/about_ata/company_information/history.html |accessdate=2008-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after Mikelson had secured a major [[code-share]] agreement with [[Southwest Airlines]]. Upon emergence from bankruptcy, Mikelson retired from ATA and its airline holdings, turning the reins of the company to a [[MatlinPatterson]] lead [[board of directors]] and former Southwest executive [[John G. Denison]]. ATA Airlines filed for bankruptcy protection again on April 2, 2008, and announced the discontinuation of all operations "following the loss of a key contract for our military charter business", ATA said on its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ATA discontinues all operations |publisher=ATA Airlines |date=2008-04-03 |url=http://www.ata.com |accessdate=2008-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal information==
Mikelsons and his wife Muriel live near Indianapolis and have two children (Jay and David Mikelsons). He is the 1996 recipient of the ''[[Tony Jannus Award]]'' for outstanding leadership in the commercial aviation industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tony Jannus Award past recipients |publisher=Tony Jannus Society |url=http://www.tonyjannusaward.com/legacy.html |accessdate=2008-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713183727/http://tonyjannusaward.com/legacy.html |archivedate=July 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mikelsons owns and flies a [[Bell 206|Bell Jet Ranger III]] helicopter.

'''Mega Food Park''' is an inclusive concept and a scheme of the [[Ministry of Food Processing Industries|Ministry of Food Processing]] of the [[Government of India]], aimed at establishing a "direct linkage from farm to processing and then to consumer markets" through a network of collection centres and primary processing centres.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Its purpose was to increase processing of perishables from 6% to 20% and to increase India's Share in global food trade by at least 3% up to year 2015.

According to an estimate,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fnbnews.com/Top-News/Punjab---Potential-location-for-setting-up-of-food-parks|title=Potential location for setting up of food parks|website=Fnbnews.com|access-date=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Indian food industry was to grow from $200 million [[United States dollar|USD]] to $310 million [[United States dollar|USD]] in 2015 by this scheme.

==Highlights of scheme&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;==
* Government provides grants up to Rs 50 crores for each food park to a consortium of companies.
* 30-35 food processing units are expected to be established.
* Collective investment of companies is expected to be at least 250 crores.
* A turnover of 400-500 crore and employment generation of at least 30000 from each mega food park is expected.
A total of 42 Mega Food Parks have been sanctioned so far by MoFPI in six phases
These MFPs are to ensure backward linkages to the farmers, SHGs, JLVs etc. &amp; enhance farmer income. Each MFP is supposed to connect with 25000 farmers
Government has envisaged building quality labs at each of the food parks as well

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1402">'''Minimum safe altitude warning''' ('''MSAW''') is an automated warning system for [[air traffic controller]]s (ATCO). It is a ground-based safety net intended to warn the controller about increased risk of [[controlled flight into terrain]] accidents by generating, in a timely manner, an alert of aircraft proximity to terrain or obstacles.&lt;ref name=spin&gt;{{Cite web |title=EUROCONTROL Specification for Minimum Safe Altitude Warning |url=http://www.eurocontrol.int/sites/default/files/publication/files/20090519-msaw-guid-v1.0.pdf |date=19 May 2009|version=0.9 | publisher=Eurocontrol|accessdate=2010-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

ICAO Doc 4444 requires that radar systems should provide for the display of safety-related alerts including the presentation of minimum safe altitude warning.&lt;ref name=doc4444&gt;{{cite book |title=Rules of the Air and Air Traffic Services |publisher=ICAO|id=Doc 4444-RAC/501}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is worth mentioning that ICAO Doc 4444 does not provide a definition of the term MSAW. Instead the term MSAW is ambiguously used in [[Air traffic control|ATC]] community to identify such warnings as well as for data processing systems providing the alert function.

The '''Ministry of Energy'''‚Äôs responsibility is ensuring that Ontario‚Äôs electricity system functions with reliability and productivity, and promoting innovation in the energy sector. In April 2002, it was renamed the Ministry of Energy, with the newly created [[Ministry of Enterprise, Opportunity and Innovation]] taking over responsibility for its science and technology portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;"Eves' picks raise fears of deficits, Tories say". ''National Post'', 16 April 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; It was integrated as the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure between 2007 and 2010, before it was split back into the Ministry of Energy on August 18, 2010.

The Minister of Energy is the Honourable [[Greg Rickford]].

==Responsibilities==

Several agencies and crown corporations are under the Ministry:

* [[Hydro One]] 1999‚Äìpresent; created from the breakup of Ontario Hydro
* [[Independent Electricity System Operator]] (IESO) 1998‚Äìpresent; created from the breakup of Ontario Hydro
** [[Ontario Power Authority]] 2004-2015; now merged with IESO; created from the breakup of Ontario Hydro
* [[Ontario Energy Board]] 1999‚Äìpresent; created from the breakup of Ontario Hydro
* [[Ontario Power Generation]] (OPG) 1999‚Äìpresent; created from the breakup of Ontario Hydro

From 1974 to 1999 [[Ontario Hydro]] reported to the Minister, but the public utility was broken up into various agencies and crown corporations. Prior to 1974 Ontario Hydro reported to Commissioners appointed by the Premier and a few were Ministers without Portfolio.

The Commission was headed by a Chairman:

* Sir [[Adam Beck]] 1906-1925 -referred to as Minister of Power

[[Image:Neon Message Board.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Neon message board]]
A '''neon (or glass) message board''' or '''glassboard''' is an erasable luminescent [[whiteboard]]-like writing pad that enables users to leave [[message]]s for others. They have been a common way of displaying daily [[Discounts and allowances|specials]] at [[restaurant]]s.  Colored [[fluorescent]] [[non-permanent marker|non-permanent]] [[wet wipe marker]]s are used to write notes, messages or [[menu]]s on the board, which is [[lighting|illuminated]] from the edge by a [[fluorescent light]], usually a [[blacklight]] tube.

The message board is cleaned by wiping a wet [[facial tissue|tissue]] or [[cloth]] across the surface to dissolve the markings. A dry tissue or soft cloth is then used to remove the [[wiktionary:residue|residue]]. Board surfaces are typically black in color, and neon message boards often come with bright colored markers that are [[green]], [[yellow]], [[Orange (colour)|orange]] or [[pink]].

}}'''Over-the-Air programming''' (OTA) refers to various methods of distributing new [[software]], configuration settings, and even [[Over the Air Rekeying|updating encryption keys]] to devices like [[cellphone]]s, [[set-top box]]es or [[Secure voice|secure voice communication]] equipment (encrypted 2-way radios). One important feature of OTA is that one central location can send an update to all the users, who are unable to refuse, defeat, or alter that update, and that the update applies immediately to everyone on the channel. A user could "refuse" OTA but the "channel manager" could also "kick them off" the channel automatically.

In the context of the [[mobile content]] world these include '''over-the-air service provisioning''' (OTASP), '''over-the-air provisioning''' (OTAP) or '''over-the-air parameter administration''' (OTAPA),  or provisioning handsets with the necessary settings with which to access services such as [[Wireless access point|WAP]] or [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]].

As mobile phones accumulate new applications and become more advanced, OTA configuration has become increasingly important as new updates and services come on stream. OTA via [[Short Message Service|SMS]] optimizes the configuration data updates in [[Subscriber identity module|SIM]] cards and handsets and enables the distribution of new software updates to mobile phones or provisioning handsets with the necessary settings with which to access services such as WAP or MMS. OTA messaging provides remote control of mobile phones for service and subscription activation, personalization and programming of a new service for mobile operators and telco third parties.&lt;ref name="MME2001req"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010811201929/http://www.microsoft.com/mobile/phones/mme/default.asp|archivedate=11 August 2001|url=http://www.microsoft.com/mobile/phones/mme/default.asp|accessdate=19 April 2011|title=Mobile Phones&amp;nbsp;‚Äî Mobile Explorer|publisher=Microsoft|year=2001|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various standardization bodies were established to help develop, oversee, and manage OTA.  One of them is the [[Open Mobile Alliance]] (OMA).

More recently, with the new concepts of [[Wireless Sensor Networks]] and the [[Internet of Things]], where the networks consist of hundreds or thousands of nodes, OTA is taken to a new direction: for the first time OTA is applied using unlicensed frequency bands (868&amp;nbsp;MHz, 900&amp;nbsp;MHz, 2400&amp;nbsp;MHz) and with low consumption and low data rate transmission using protocols such as [[802.15.4]] and [[ZigBee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gasc√≥n|first=David|title=Over the Air Programming with 802.15.4 and ZigBee - OTA|url=http://www.libelium.com/over_the_air_programming_OTA_802.15.4_ZigBee/|work=Libelium|publisher=Libelium|accessdate=28 May 2012|author2=Alberto Bielsa |author3=F√©lix Genicio |author4=Marcos Yarza |date=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[sensor node|Motes]] are often located in places that are either remote or difficult to access. As an example, [[Libelium]] has implemented a smart and easy-to-use OTA programming system for [[ZigBee]] WSN devices. This system enables firmware upgrades without the need of physical access, saving time and money if the nodes must be re-programmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Libelium.com 50 Sensor applications for a Smarter World. Get Inspired!|url=http://www.libelium.com/50_sensor_applications|work=Libelium.com|publisher=Libelium.com|accessdate=28 May 2012|date=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smartphones==
On modern [[mobile device]]s such as [[smartphone]]s, an '''over-the-air update''' may refer simply to a software update that is distributed over [[Wi-Fi]] or [[mobile broadband]] using a function built into the operating system, with the "over-the-air" aspect referring to its use of wireless internet instead of requiring the user to connect the device to a computer via [[USB]] to perform the update.

[[Patch (computing)|Firmware updates]] are available for download from the &lt;ref&gt;http://www.prestigio.com/news/firmware_updates/New_firmware_MultiPhone_4055_DUO&lt;/ref&gt; OTA service.

== Mechanism ==

The OTA mechanism requires the existing software and hardware of the target device to support the feature, namely the receipt and installation of new software received via the [[wireless telephony|wireless]] network from the provider.

New software is transferred to the phone, installed, and put into use. It is often necessary to turn the phone off and back on for the new programming to take effect, though many phones will automatically perform this action.

== Methods ==

Depending on implementation, OTA software delivery can be initiated upon action, such as a call to the provider's customer support system or other dialable service, or can be performed automatically. Typically it is done via the former method to avoid service disruption at an inconvenient time, but this requires subscribers to manually call the provider. Often, a carrier will send a broadcast [[Short message service|SMS]] text message to all subscribers (or those using a particular model of phone) asking them to dial a service number to receive a software update.

[[Verizon Wireless]] in the [[United States|U.S.]] provides a number of OTA functions to its subscribers via the *228 service code. Option 1 updates phone configuration, option 2 updates the [[Preferred roaming list|PRL]]. Similarly Voitel Wireless and StraightTalk, which both use Verizon network, use *22890 service code to program Verizon based wireless phones. [[Interop Technologies]] provides a number of nationwide wireless operators in the US with an SS7 Based Over-the-Air device management solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmcnet.com/wifirevolution/articles/24338-alaska-digitel-buys-ota-programming-solution-from-interop.htm |title=Alaska DigiTel Buys OTA Pgramming Solution from Interop Technologies |publisher=Tmcnet.com |date=2008-04-01 |accessdate=2012-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This solution allows operators to manage wireless device functionality including renumbering handsets, updating phone settings, applications and subscriber data and adjusting [[Preferred roaming list|PRL]] to manage cost structures.

To provision parameters in a mobile device OTA, the device needs to have a provisioning client capable of receiving, processing and setting the parameters.  For example, a Device Management client in a device may be capable of receiving and provisioning applications, or connectivity parameters.

In general, the term OTA implies the use of wireless mechanisms to send provisioning data or update packages for firmware or software updates to a mobile device&amp;nbsp;‚Äî this is so that the user does not have to go to a store or a service center to have applications provisioned, parameters changed or firmware or software updated. Non-OTA options for a user are a) to go to a store and seek help b) use a PC and a cable to connect to the device and change settings on a device, add software to device, etc.

== OTA standards ==

There are a number of standards that describe OTA functions. One of the first was the [[GSM 03.48]] series.
The ZigBee suite of standards includes the ZigBee Over-the-Air Upgrading Cluster which is part of the ZigBee Smart Energy Profile and provides an interoperable (vendor-independent) way of updating device firmware.

== Similarities ==

OTA is similar to firmware distribution methods used by other mass-produced [[consumer electronics]], such as [[cable modem]]s, which use [[TFTP]] as a way to remotely receive new programming, thus reducing the amount of time spent by both the owner and the user of the device on maintenance.

Over-the-air provisioning (OTAP) is also available in wireless environments (though it is disabled by default for security reasons). It allows an access point (AP) to discover the IP address of its controller. When enabled, the controller tells the other APs to include additional information in the Radio Resource Management Packets (RRM) that would assist a new access point in learning of the controller. It is sent in plain text however, which would make it vulnerable to sniffing. That's why it is disabled by default.

[[File:KPI boards Scanfil Sieradz.jpg|thumb|KPI information boards.]]
A '''performance indicator''' or '''key performance indicator''' ('''KPI''') is a type of [[performance measurement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uxK0MUHeiI4C |title=Performance indicators |author=Carol Taylor Fitz-Gibbon | year=1990 |issue=2 |isbn=978-1-85359-092-4 |journal= BERA Dialogues}}&lt;/ref&gt; KPIs evaluate the success of an organization or of a particular activity (such as projects, programs, products and other initiatives) in which it engages. 

Often success is simply the repeated, periodic achievement of some levels of operational goal (e.g. zero defects, 10/10 customer satisfaction, etc.), and sometimes success is defined in terms of making progress toward strategic goals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://management.about.com/cs/generalmanagement/a/keyperfindic.htm Key Performance Indicators ‚Äì What Are Key Performance Indicators or KPI&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, choosing the right KPIs relies upon a good understanding of what is important to the organization.{{cn|date=September 2016}} What is deemed important often depends on the department measuring the performance ‚Äì e.g. the KPIs useful to finance will differ from the KPIs assigned to sales. 

Since there is a need to understand well what is important, various techniques to assess the present state of the business, and its key activities, are associated with the selection of performance indicators. These assessments often lead to the identification of potential improvements, so performance indicators are routinely associated with 'performance improvement' initiatives. A very common way to choose KPIs is to apply a management framework such as the [[balanced scorecard]].

==Categorization of indicators==
Key performance indicators define a set of values against which to measure. These raw sets of values, which can be fed to systems that aggregate the data, are called ''indicators''. There are two categories of measurements for KPIs. 
* ''[[Level_of_measurement|Quantitative]]'' facts without distortion from personal feelings, prejudices, or interpretations presented with a specific value - objective- preferably numeric measured against a standard.
* ''[[Qualitative_property|Qualitative]]'' values based on or influenced by personal feelings, tastes, or opinions and presented as any numeric or textual value that represents an interpretation of these elements. 

An 'indicator' can only measure what 'has' happened, in the past tense, so the only type of measurement is descriptive or lagging.  Any KPI that attempts to measure something in a future state as predictive, diagnostic or prescriptive is no longer an 'indicator' it is a 'prognosticator' - at this point its analytics (possibly based on a KPI).

==Points of measurement==
''Performance'' focuses on measuring a particular ''element'' of an ''activity''. An activity can have four elements: input, output, control, and mechanism. At a minimum, an activity is required to have at least an input and an output. Something goes into the activity as an ''input''; the activity transforms the input by making a change to its ''state''; and the activity produces an ''output''. An activity can also have enabling ''mechanisms'' that are typically separated into ''human'' and ''system'' mechanisms. It can also be constrained in some way by a ''control''. Lastly, its actions can have a temporal construct of ''time''.

* ''Input'' indicates the inputs required of an activity to produce an output.
* ''Output'' captures the outcome or results of an activity or group of activities.
* ''Activity'' indicates the transformation produced by an activity (i.e., some form of work).
* ''Mechanism'' is something that enables an activity to work (a performer), either human or system.
* ''Control'' is an object that controls the activity's production through compliance.
* ''Time'' indicates a temporal element of the activity.

==Identifying indicators of organization==
Performance indicators differ from business drivers and aims (or goals). A school might consider the failure rate of its students as a key performance indicator which might help the school understand its position in the educational community, whereas a business might consider the percentage of income from returning customers as a potential KPI.

The key stages in identifying KPIs are:
* Having a pre-defined business process (BP).
* Having requirements for the BPs.
* Having a quantitative/qualitative measurement of the results and comparison with set goals.
* Investigating variances and tweaking processes or resources to achieve short-term goals.

Key performance indicators (KPIs) are ways to periodically assess the performances of organizations, business units, and their division, departments and employees. Accordingly, KPIs are most commonly defined in a way that is understandable, meaningful, and measurable. They are rarely defined in such a way such that their fulfillment would be hampered by factors seen as non-controllable by the organizations or individuals responsible. Such KPIs are usually ignored by organizations.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

KPIs should follow the [[SMART criteria]]. This means the measure has a '''S'''pecific purpose for the business, it is '''M'''easurable to really get a value of the KPI, the defined norms have to be '''A'''chievable, the improvement of a KPI has to be '''R'''elevant to the success of the organization, and finally it must be '''T'''ime phased, which means the value or outcomes are shown for a predefined and relevant period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ca.com/content/dam/ca/us/files/white-paper/key-performance-indicators.pdf Key Performance Indicators: Establishing the Metrics that Guide Success], accessed 23 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to be evaluated, KPIs are linked to target values, so that the value of the measure can be assessed as meeting expectations or not.

==Examples==

Key performance indicators are the non-financial measures of a company's performance - they do not have a monetary value but they do contribute to the company's profitability. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Palffy |first1=Georgina |title=How Business Works |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-46542-979-7 |page=146 |edition=1st }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accounts===
Some examples are:
# Percentage of overdue invoices
# Percentage of purchase orders raised in advance
# Number of retrospectively raised purchase orders
# Finance report error rate (measures the quality of report)
# Average cycle time of workflow
# Number of duplicate payments

===Marketing and sales===
# New [[customer]] acquisition
# Demographic analysis of individuals (potential customers) applying to become customers, and the levels of approval, rejections, and pending numbers
# Status of existing customers
# [[Customer attrition]]
# [[Revenue|Turnover]] (i.e., revenue) generated by segments of the customer population
# Outstanding balances held by segments of customers and terms of payment
# Collection of bad debts within customer relationships
# Profitability of customers by demographic segments and segmentation of customers by profitability

Many of these customer KPIs are developed and managed with [[customer relationship management]] software.

Faster availability of data is a competitive issue for most organizations. For example, businesses which have higher operational/credit risk (involving for example credit cards or wealth management) may want weekly or even daily availability of KPI analysis, facilitated by appropriate IT systems and tools.

===Manufacturing===
[[Overall equipment effectiveness]] is a set of broadly accepted non-financial metrics which reflect manufacturing success.
* '''OEE''' = availability x performance x quality
* '''Availability''' = run time / total time, by definition this is the percentage of the actual amount of production time the machine is running to the production time the machine is available.
* '''Performance''' = total count / target counter, by definition this is the percentage of total parts produced on the machine to the production rate of machine.
* '''Quality''' = good count / total count, by definition, this is the percentage of good parts out of the total parts produced on the machine. 
* '''Cycle time ratio''' (CTR) = standard cycle time / real cycle time
* [[Utilization]]
* [[Rejection rate]]

===Professional Services===
Most [[professional services]] firms (for example: management consultancies, systems integration firms, or digital marketing agencies) use three key performance indicators to track the health of their businesses. They typically use [[professional services automation]] (PSA) software to keep track of and manage these metrics.
* '''[[Utilization rate]]''' = the percentage of time employees spend generating revenue 
* '''Project profitability''' = the difference between revenue generated by a project and the cost of delivering the work 
* '''Project success rate''' = the percentage of projects delivered on time and under budget

===System operations===
* [[Availability]] / [[uptime]]
* [[Mean time between failure]]
* [[Mean time to repair]]
* Unplanned availability
* Average time to repair

===Project execution===
* [[Earned value management|Earned value]]
* Estimate to complete
* Manpower spent / month
* Money spent / month
* Planned spend / month
* Planned manpower / month
* Average time to delivery
* Tasks / staff
* Project overhead / ROI
* Planned delivery date vs actual delivery date

===Supply chain management===
Businesses can utilize KPIs to establish and monitor progress toward a variety of goals, including lean manufacturing objectives, [[minority business enterprise]] and diversity spending, environmental "green" initiatives, cost avoidance programs and [[low-cost country sourcing]] targets.

Any business, regardless of size, can better manage supplier performance with the help of KPIs robust capabilities, which include:
* Automated entry and approval functions
* On-demand, real-time scorecard measures
* Rework on procured inventory
* Single data repository to eliminate inefficiencies and maintain consistency
* Advanced workflow approval process to ensure consistent procedures
* Flexible data-input modes and real-time graphical performance displays
* Customized cost savings documentation
* Simplified setup procedures to eliminate dependence upon IT resources

Main SCM KPIs will detail the following processes:
* Sales forecasts
* Inventory
* Procurement and suppliers
* Warehousing
* Transportation
* [[Reverse logistics]]

Suppliers can implement KPIs to gain an advantage over the competition. Suppliers have instant access to a user-friendly portal for submitting standardized cost savings templates. Suppliers and their customers exchange vital supply chain performance data while gaining visibility to the exact status of cost improvement projects and cost savings documentation.

===Government===
The provincial government of [[Ontario, Canada]] has been using KPIs since 1998 to measure the performance of higher education institutions in the province. All post secondary schools collect and report performance data in five areas ‚Äì graduate satisfaction, student satisfaction, employer satisfaction, employment rate, and graduation rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegesontario.org/outcomes/key-performance-indicators/2011_kpi_results.pdf |title=Key Performance Indicators |publisher=Colleges Ontario |date= |accessdate=2013-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further performance indicators===
* Duration of a [[stockout]] situation

: &lt;math&gt;\text{ROC} = \frac{\text{Close}-\text{Close (Past)}}{\text{Close (Past)}}\times100&lt;/math&gt;

* Customer order waiting time

'''Human Resource Management'''

* Employee turnover
* Employee performance indicators
* Cross functional team analysis

==Problems ==
In practice, overseeing key performance indicators can prove expensive or difficult for organizations. Some indicators such as staff morale may be impossible to quantify. As such, dubious KPIs can be adopted that can be used as a rough guide rather than a precise benchmark.&lt;ref name=Daddis&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daddis|first1=Gregory|title=No Sure Victory: Measuring U.S. Army Effectiveness and Progress in the Vietnam War|date=June 1, 2011|isbn=978-0-19974-687-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Key performance indicators can also lead to [[perverse incentive]]s and [[unintended consequences]] as a result of employees working to the specific measurements at the expense of the actual quality or value of their work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Measuring-Managing-Performance-Organizations-Robert/dp/0932633366 Robert D Austin, "Measuring and Managing Performance in Organizations"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Martin Fowler |url=http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CannotMeasureProductivity.html |title=CannotMeasureProductivity |publisher=Martinfowler.com |date=2003-08-29 |accessdate=2013-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sometimes the collecting of statistics can become a substitute for a better understanding of the problems so the use of dubious KPIs can result in progress in aims and measured effectiveness becoming different. For example, US soldiers during the Vietnam War were shown to be effective in kill ratios and high body counts, but this was misleading when used to measure aims as it did not show the lack of progress towards the US goal of increasing South Vietnamese government control of its territory.&lt;ref name=Daddis/&gt; Another example would be to measure the productivity of a software development team in terms of lines of source code written.  This approach can easily result in large amounts of dubious code being added, thereby inflating the line count but adding little of value in terms of systemic improvement.  A similar problem arises when a footballer kicks a ball uselessly in a match in order to build up his statistics.

A '''priest''' (poacher's, game warden's or angler's "priest"), is a tool for killing game or fish.

The name "[[priest]]" comes from the notion of administering the "[[Last Rites|last rites]]" to the fish or game. [[Angling|Anglers]] often use priests to quickly kill fish.

==Description==
Priests usually come in the form of a heavy metal head attached to a metal or wooden stick. The small baton is a [[blunt instrument]] used for quickly killing fish or game. Early versions are made of ''[[lignum vitae]]'' (Latin for "wood of life"), the densest hardwood. One example is described as "Lead filled head. Brass ring to handle. With large Head for dispatching Game. Size overall 14 inches long".

==In culture==
Identified as a "poacher's priest" the tool is a featured murder weapon in Series 12 of the BBC's ''[[Dalziel and Pascoe (BBC TV series)|Dalziel and Pascoe]]'', Episodes 2 and 3, "Under Dark Stars", which left a round bruised mark on impact.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9129">An '''RF Switch''' or '''Microwave Switch''' is a device to route [[high frequency]] signals through transmission paths. RF ([[radio frequency]]) and [[microwave]] switches are used extensively in microwave test systems for signal routing between instruments and [[Device under test|devices under test]] (DUT). Incorporating a switch into a switch matrix system enables you to route signals from multiple instruments to single or multiple DUTs. This allows multiple tests to be performed with the same setup, eliminating the need for frequent connects and disconnects. The entire testing process can be automated, increasing the throughput in high-volume production environments.

Like other [[electrical switch]]es, RF and microwave switches provide different configurations for many different applications. Below is a list of typical switch configurations and usage:

* [[Single pole, double throw]] (SPDT or 1:2) switches route signals from one input to two output paths.
[[File:Agilent N181x Switches.jpg|thumb|Single pole double throw (SPDT) switch from [[Agilent Technologies]]]]
* Multiport switches or [[single pole, multiple throw]] (SPnT) switches allow a single input to multiple (three or more) output paths.
* [[Transfer switch]]es or [[double pole, double throw]] (DPDT) switches can serve various purposes.
* Bypass switches insert or remove a test component from a signal path.
[[File:Bypass Switch Application.png|thumb|Typical application of a 4-port bypass switch]]

==RF &amp; Microwave Switch Technologies==

The two main kinds of RF and microwave switches have different capabilities:

* [[Electromechanical]] switches are based on the simple theory of [[electromagnetic induction]].  They rely on mechanical contacts as their switching mechanism.
[[File:Agilent EM Switch Family.jpg|thumb|Some of the electromechanical switches from Agilent Technologies]]

* A [[solid state relay|solid state]] switch is an electronic switching device based on semiconductor technology (e.g. [[MOSFET]], [[PIN diode]]).  It functions similarly to an electromechanical switch except that it has no moving parts. [[File:Agilent SS Switch Family.jpg|thumb|Some of the solid state switches from Agilent Technologies]]

==Critical parameters for RF and microwave switches==

===Frequency range===
RF and microwave applications range in frequency from 100&amp;nbsp;MHz for semiconductor to 60&amp;nbsp;GHz for satellite communications. Broadband accessories increase test system flexibility by extending frequency coverage. However, frequency is always application dependent and a broad operating frequency may be sacrificed to meet other critical parameters. For example, a network analyzer may perform a 1 ms sweep for an insertion loss measurement, so for this application settling time or switching speed becomes the critical parameter for ensuring measurement accuracy.

===Insertion loss===
In addition to proper frequency selection, [[insertion loss]] is critical to testing. Losses greater than 1 or 2&amp;nbsp;dB will attenuate peak signal levels and increase rising and falling edge times. A low insertion loss system can be achieved by minimizing the number of connectors and through-paths, or by selecting low insertion loss devices for system configuration. As power is expensive at higher frequencies, electromechanical switches provide the lowest possible loss along the transmission path.

===Return loss===
Return loss is caused by impedance mismatch between circuits. At microwave frequencies, the material properties as well as the dimensions of a network element play a significant role in determining the impedance match or mismatch caused by the distributed effect. Switches with excellent return loss performance ensure optimum power transfer through the switch and the entire network.

===Repeatability===
Low insertion loss repeatability reduces sources of random errors in the measurement path, which improves measurement accuracy. The repeatability and reliability of a switch guarantees measurement accuracy and can cut the cost of ownership by reducing calibration cycles and increasing test system uptime.

===Isolation===
Isolation is the degree of attenuation from an unwanted signal detected at the port of interest. Isolation becomes more important at higher frequencies. High isolation reduces the influence of signals from other channels, sustains the integrity of the measured signal, and reduces system measurement uncertainties. For instance, a switch matrix may need to route a signal to a spectrum analyzer for measurement at ‚Äì70 dBm and to simultaneously route another signal at +20 dBm. In this case, switches with high isolation, 90&amp;nbsp;dB or more, will keep the measurement integrity of the low-power signal.

===Switching speed===
Switching speed is defined as the time needed to change the state of a switch port (arm) from ‚ÄúON‚Äô to ‚ÄúOFF‚Äù or from ‚ÄúOFF‚Äù to ‚ÄúON‚Äù.

===Settling time===
As switching time only specifies an end value of 90% of the settled/final value of the RF signal, settling time is often highlighted in solid state switch performance where the need for accuracy and precision is more critical. Settling time is measured to a level closer to the final value. The widely used margin-to-final value of settling time is 0.01&amp;nbsp;dB (99.77% of the final value) and 0.05&amp;nbsp;dB (98.86% of the final value). This specification is commonly used for [[GaAs]] [[FET]] switches because they have a gate lag effect caused by electrons becoming trapped on the surface of the GaAs.

===Power handling===
Power handling defines the ability of a switch to handle power and is very dependent on the design and materials used. There are different power handling ratings for switches such as hot switching, cold switching, average power and peak power. Hot switching occurs when RF/microwave power is present at the ports of the switching at the time of the switching. Cold switching occurs when the signal power is removed before switching. Cold switching results in lower contact stress and longer life.

===Termination===
A 50-ohm load termination is critical in many applications, since each open unused transmission line has the possibility to resonate. This is important when designing a system that works up to 26&amp;nbsp;GHz or higher frequencies where switch isolation drops considerably. When the switch is connected to an active device, the reflected power of an unterminated path could possibly damage the source.

:'''Electromechanical switches''' are categorized as terminated or unterminated. Terminated switches: when a selected path is closed, all other paths are terminated with 50 ohm loads, and the current to all the solenoids is cut off. Unterminated switches reflect power.

:'''Solid state switches''' are categorized as absorptive or reflective. Absorptive switches incorporate a 50 ohm termination in each of the output ports to present a low [[VSWR]] in both the OFF and ON states. Reflective switches conduct RF power when the diode is reverse biased and reflect RF power when forward biased.

===Video leakage===
Video leakage refers to the spurious signals present at the RF ports of the switch when it is switched without an RF signal present. These signals arise from the waveforms generated by the switch driver and, in particular, from the leading edge voltage spike required for high-speed switching of PIN diodes. The amplitude of the video leakage depends on the design of the switch and the switch driver.

===Operating life===
A long operating life reduces cost per cycle and budgetary constraints allowing manufacturers to be more competitive.

{{about|the optoelectronic component|the optical component|Optical switch}}

The '''slotted optical switch''', sometimes known as '''opto switch''' or '''optical switch''' but not to be confused with the optical component, is a device comprising a photoemitter (e.g. [[LED]]) and a photodetector (e.g. [[photodiode]]) mounted in a single package so that the photoemitter normally illuminates the photodetector, but an opaque object can be inserted in a slot between them so as to break the beam. Associated [[Electronic_circuit|circuit]]ry is provided which changes state when the beam is interrupted. For example, the carriage of a [[computer printer]] may be fitted with a projection which interrupts the beam of a slotted switch when it reaches the end of its travel, causing circuitry to react appropriately. Another application of the slotted switch is in the type of [[Mechanical mouse|computer mouse]] with a rotating ball. The ball measures distances moved by rotating orthogonal shafts which drive [[optical chopper]] wheels turning in the slots of slotted switches.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Qq0CVfcAktUC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=mouse+opto+switch&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=V9uZTM-DB42OjAeLo1w&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=mouse%20opto%20switch&amp;f=false 123 robotics experiments for the evil genius By Michael Predko, Myke Predko: description of wheeled mouse operation]&lt;/ref&gt;

This device uses the same basic components as an [[opto-coupler]], but is operated by manipulating the light path instead of the photoemitter input.

Illustrations and data on slotted optical switches are to be found in catalogues and manufacturers' data sheets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.optekinc.com/datasheets/opb610.pdf Datasheet of typical optical switch]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''spatial power combiner''' generally refers to a [[microwave]] system in which the output power of several [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]] circuits are combined in free space as opposed to in a lossy substrate. Many spatial power combiners use concepts from free-space [[optics]] in which [[dielectric]] lenses are used to focus a microwave beam into and out of a solid-state circuit array. For this reason, this field of research is also known as [[quasioptics]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4236">'''Spread-spectrum time-domain reflectometry''' ('''SSTDR''') is a measurement technique to identify faults, usually in electrical wires, by observing reflected spread spectrum signals. This type of [[time-domain reflectometry]] can be used in various high-noise and live environments. Additionally, SSTDR systems have the additional benefit of being able to precisely locate the position of the fault. Specifically, SSTDR is accurate to within a few centimeters for wires carrying 400 Hz aircraft signals as well as [[MIL-STD-1553]] data bus signals.&lt;ref&gt;Smith,Paul, Furse, Cynthia and Gunther, Jacob. "Analysis of [http://livewiretest.com/analysis-of-spread-spectrum-time-domain-reflectometry-for-wire-fault-location/ Spread Spectrum Time Domain Reflectometry] for Wire Fault Location." IEEE Sensors Journal. December, 2005. {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wQrUbdfD?url=http://livewiretest.com/analysis-of-spread-spectrum-time-domain-reflectometry-for-wire-fault-location/ |date=February 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; AN SSTDR system can be run on a live wire because the spread spectrum signals can be isolated from the system noise and activity.

At the most basic level, the system works by sending spread spectrum signals down a wireline and waiting for those signals to be reflected back to the SSTDR system.  The reflected signal is then correlated with a copy of the sent signal.  Mathematical algorithms are applied to both the shape and timing of the signals to locate either the short or the end of an open circuit.

==Detecting intermittent faults in live wires==
Spread-spectrum time domain reflectometry is used in detecting intermittent faults in live wires. From buildings and homes to aircraft and naval ships, this technology can discover irregular shorts on live wire running [[Utility_frequency#400_Hz|400&amp;thinsp;Hz]], 115&amp;thinsp;V. For accurate location of a wiring system's fault the SSTDR associates the [[PN code]] with the signal on the line then stores the exact location of the correlation before the arc dissipates.  Present SSTDR can collect a complete data set in under 5&amp;thinsp;ms. &lt;ref&gt;Smith,Paul, Furse, Cynthia, Safavi, Mehdi, and Lo, Chet.

SSTDR technology allows for analysis of a network of wires. One SSTDR sensor can measure up to 4 junctions in a branched wire system.&lt;ref&gt;Smith,Paul, Furse, Cynthia, Chung Chung, You, Pendayala, Praveeen, Nagoti, Kedarnath and Lo, Chet.

The German software company '''Star Division''' (also spelled '''Star-Division''') was founded in 1985 by the 16-year-old [[Marco B√∂rries]] in [[L√ºneburg]] as a garage company.&lt;ref name="Schaefer_1997"/&gt; After a neighbour denunciated the operation of a business in a residential area to the [[Ordnungsamt]], the company moved to [[Hamburg]].&lt;ref name="Schaefer_1997"/&gt;

As its first product the company distributed [[StarWriter (word processor)|StarWriter]], a [[word processor]] application developed by friends.&lt;ref name="Vermes_1999"/&gt;

Positioned as a cheaper alternative to [[Microsoft]]'s [[office suite]], StarWriter later became [[StarOffice]], for which the company became famous.&lt;ref name="Schaefer_1997"/&gt; The software was sold over 25 million times worldwide, and at its peak it had a market share among other office suites of about 25% in Germany.&lt;ref name="Schaefer_1997"/&gt;

&lt;!-- In 1996 or early 1997, --&gt;[[Caldera, Inc.]] supported the Linux-port of [[StarOffice 3.1]] with ca. 800.000&amp;nbsp;DM in order to offer the product with their forthcoming [[OpenLinux]] distribution in 1997.&lt;ref name="Brors_1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CW_1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Strobl_2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bantle_2017"/&gt;

In 1998 B√∂rries released StarOffice free of charge for private use.&lt;ref name="Dworschak_1998"/&gt;

Star Division was acquired by the software and hardware vendor [[Sun Microsystems]] on 5 August 1999 for a higher double-digit million amount in US dollars.&lt;ref name="Kerbusk_1999"/&gt;&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_amount"/&gt; Sun reintroduced the software as [[StarOffice 5.1a]], and for the first time also free of charge for commercial use.

The StarOffice suite has since been further developed by Sun Microsystems and the [[OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice]] and [[LibreOffice]] communities. 

Sun Microsystems became a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Oracle Corporation]] on 27 January 2010.

'''2017'''

The Ministry‚Äôs of Higher Education "''Bulletin Officiel de l'Enseignement Sup√©rieur et de la Recherche"'' lists the school as one of the few design schools in France to deliver a diploma recognized by the Minister in charge of higher education.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.strate.design/galerie/actualites/diplome-designer-strate-aujourdhui-vise-etat|title=Le dipl√¥me de Designer de Strate maintenant vis√© par l'√âtat !|last=MasterAdminStrate|date=2017-07-04|work=Strate, √©cole de design|access-date=2017-09-06|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teaching ==
Some programs last five years (bac+5), others three (MBA). The two main subjects in the curriculum are design and modeling.

=== Design course ===
The first two years of the Design course are about teaching the fundamentals of drawing, perspective, modeling and design methodology.

In the third year the students specialize in one major: product, transportation, packaging &amp; retail, or interaction. A first six-month internship takes place in the third year.

In year four, the students are requested to spend the first semester abroad either at a partner design school of the CUMULUS association,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cumulusassociation.org/member/|title=Cumulus|website=www.cumulusassociation.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by doing an internship. The students then come back to school for a period of projects with partner companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.autoplus.fr/Renault/Partenariat-Ecole-Design-Renault-Strate-College-1478103.html|title=Renault s'offre un vivier de designers|work=Autoplus.fr|access-date=2017-09-06|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth year is dedicated to the preparation of the diploma. Students are requested to write a memoir and formalize their project, which they present to a jury of professionals (independent designers, designers in agencies, office managers, marketing managers). After this presentation students are requested to do a final internship in France or abroad.

=== 3D Modeling course ===
The 3D modeling course is a 3-year undergraduate diploma which teaches traditional and digital modeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.strate.design/formation/modelage-3d|title=Formation Modelage 3d en 3 ans|last=MasterAdminStrate|date=2016-07-20|work=Strate, √©cole de design|access-date=2017-09-04|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[electrical wiring]], a '''T-splice''' is a splice that is used for connecting the end of one [[wire]] to the middle of another wire, thus forming a shape like that of the letter "T." This splice can be used with solid or [[stranded wire]]s. The existing wire is called the main wire. The new wire that connects to the main wire is called the branch wire or tap wire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharp|first=John MacLaren|title=Practical Electric Wiring|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i41RAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA16|year=1916|publisher=D.

A '''thermal mass refrigerator''' is a [[refrigerator]] that is foreseen with [[thermal mass]] as well as [[thermal insulation|insulation]] to decrease the energy use of the refrigerator. A particularly popular thermal mass refrigerator was conceived by Michael Reynolds and detailed in the book "Earthship Volume 3". This refrigerator was a [[DIY]] refrigerator designed around a (Sun-Frost) DC refrigeration unit run on P.V. panels.&lt;ref&gt;Earthship Volume 3 by Michael Reynolds&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design details==
The thermal mass used in Michael Reynolds' design is a combination of a liquid (i.e. water or beer) together with concrete mass. Concrete's temperature can be decreased quickly, while a liquid's (such as beer or water) with its higher thermal mass requires more energy to change temperature, holding the cold for longer. In Michael Reynolds' design, the liquid is added in the form of beer cans, placed in the back of the refrigerator.

Besides the use of a large quantity of thermal mass, he also made sure that the inside of the box could be in direct contact with the outside air, so as to allow the unit to be cooled without electricity/compressor-assistance during winter. This is done by having the top of the unit openable by placing a skylight on top. A pipe connects the bottom to the outside as well, so as to allow natural circulation of air. The inflow of outside air from the top could be closed off by closing the skylight as well as by closing the removable insulated damper.

==[[Colonial history of the United States|Colonial Period]] (1500s‚Äì1775)==
;1717 [[Swim fins]]
* Swim fins, also known as fins, or flippers, are blade-shaped extensions worn on feet or hands for use in water. They aid movement in aquatic sports such as swimming, surfing, and underwater diving. Swim fins are typically made of rubber or plastic. [[Benjamin Franklin]] invented wooden swim fins in 1717.&lt;ref name="Minnesota Historical Society"&gt;{{cite web|title=Benjamin Franklin: In Search of a Better World|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society|url=http://benfranklinexhibit.org/resume}}&lt;/ref&gt; His original design consisted of {{convert|10|in|mm|adj=mid|-long}} and {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} palettes. Contrary to today's version of rubberized swim fins worn on the feet, Franklin's swim fins were originally intended for use on a person's hands. Shaped like lily pads or an artist's paint palette, they helped attain greater speed with each stroke.&lt;ref name="Inquiring Mind"&gt;{{cite web|title=Benjamin Franklin: Inquiring Mind|publisher=PBS|url=https://www.pbs.org/benfranklin/l3_inquiring_little.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin has since been posthumously honored by being inducted into the [[International Swimming Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Some of Ben Franklin's Quirkiest Ideas|publisher=TechMediaNetwork.com|url=http://www.livescience.com/history/060117_ben_franklin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;1730 [[Octant (instrument)|Octant]]
[[File:Hadley's octant.png|180px|left|thumb|Hadley's octant design]]
*An octant, also called "reflecting [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]]", is a measuring instrument used primarily in navigation. It is a type of [[reflecting instrument]] that uses mirrors to reflect the path of light to the observer and, in doing so, doubles the angle measured. This allows the instrument to use a one-eighth circle arc to measure a quarter circle or quadrant. The octant was invented in 1730 by [[Thomas Godfrey (inventor)|Thomas Godfrey]], a glazier in Philadelphia, and independently at the same time in England by the mathematician [[John Hadley]], who began work on a similar version of the octant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Muckelroy| first = Keith| title = Maritime Archaeology| url = https://books.google.com/?id=rvRKwa78s48C&amp;pg=PA124| year = 1978| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-29348-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both men have an equal and legitimate claim to the invention of the octant. Originally this instrument was referred to as "Hadley's quadrant", after the English inventor. These days it is now known as an octant, the name given to it by its American inventor, Thomas Godfrey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Octant|publisher=Institute of Navigation Museum|url=http://www.ion.org/museum/item_view.cfm?cid=2&amp;scid=14&amp;iid=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;1742 [[Franklin stove]]
*The Franklin Stove, also known as the circulating stove, is a metal-lined fireplace with baffles in the rear to improve the airflow, providing more heat and less smoke than an ordinary open fireplace. The stove became very popular throughout the Thirteen Colonies and gradually replaced open fireplaces. The Franklin stove was invented by [[Benjamin Franklin]] in 1742.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fascinating facts about the invention of the Franklin Stove by Benjamin Franklin in 1742|publisher=The Great Idea Finder|url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/frankstove.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;1744 [[Mail order]]
* A mail-order catalog is a publication containing a list of general merchandise from a company. Those who publish and operate mail-order catalogs are referred to as catalogers within the industry, who also buy or manufacture goods and then market those goods to prospective customers. Mail ordering uses the postal system for soliciting and delivering goods. According to The National Mail Order Association, [[Benjamin Franklin]] invented and conceptualized mail order cataloging in 1744.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mail Order Catalog Vs. Online Shopping|publisher=Retail Interaction|url=http://www.retailinteraction.com/content/mail-order-catalogs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1749 [[Lightning rod]]'''
* A lightning rod is one component in a lightning protection system. In addition to rods placed at regular intervals on the highest portions of a structure, a lightning protection system typically includes a rooftop network of conductors, multiple conductive paths from the roof to the ground, bonding connections to metallic objects within the structure and a grounding network. Individual lightning rods are sometimes called finials, air terminals or strike termination devices. In 1749&lt;ref name="Electrical Kite and Lightning Rod"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Benjamin Franklin's "Electrical Kite" and Lightning Rod|publisher=The New England Quarterly|jstor=359764 | volume=1|pages=180‚Äì196}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 1750,&lt;ref name="Inquiring Mind"/&gt; the pointed lightning rod conductor, also called a "lightning attractor" or "Franklin rod", is generally thought to have been conceived when [[Benjamin Franklin]] came to the conclusion that electricity and lightning were identical and of the same.&lt;ref name="Electrical Kite and Lightning Rod"/&gt; By building lightning rods originally intended to be adorned atop church steeples, Franklin set about trying to prove their usefulness of shielding people and buildings from lightning. By 1752, Dr. Franklin tied the string of his "electrical kite" to an insulating silk ribbon for the knuckles of his hand. The kite in turn was attached to a metal key. During a storm, witnessed by his son [[William Franklin]], Dr. Franklin had finally proven that lightning was a form of electricity when the metal key received an electrical charge from a bolt of lightning. Thus, the practical use of lightning rods, attributed to the inventor Benjamin Franklin, was confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fascinating facts about the invention of the Lightning Rod by Benjamin Franklin in 1752|publisher=The Great Idea Finder|url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/lightningrod.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1752 [[Urinary catheterization|Flexible urinary catheter]]'''
* In medicine, a catheter is a tube that can be inserted into a body cavity, duct, or vessel. Catheters thereby allow drainage, injection of fluids, or access by surgical instruments. Prior to the mid 18th-century, catheters were made of wood or stiffened animal skins which were not conducive to navigating the anatomical curvature of the human urethra. Extending his inventiveness to his family's medical problems, [[Benjamin Franklin]] invented the flexible catheter in 1752 when his brother John suffered from bladder stones. Dr. Franklin's flexible catheter was made of metal with segments hinged together in order for a wire enclosed inside to increase rigidity during insertion.&lt;ref name="Minnesota Historical Society"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Franklin's legacy to medicine|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4293380.stm | date=October 29, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Franklin Trivia|publisher=Franklin &amp; Marshall College|url=http://www.benfranklin300.org/etc_trivia.htm#i}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Franklin| first = Benjamin| title = The complete works of Benjamin Franklin| url = https://books.google.com/?id=OF4-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA264| year = 1888| publisher = G. P. Putnam's sons }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1761 [[Glass harmonica#Franklin's armonica|Armonica]]'''
* Also known as the glass harmonica or glass armonica, [[Benjamin Franklin]] invented a musical instrument in 1761, an arrangement of glasses after seeing water-filled wine glasses played by Edmund Delaval in Cambridge, England. Dr. Franklin, who called his invention the "armonica" after the Italian word for harmony, worked with London glassblower Charles James to build one, and it had its world premi√®re in early 1762, played by [[Marianne Davies]]. In this version, 37 bowls were mounted horizontally nested on an iron spindle. The whole spindle turned by means of a foot-operated treadle. The sound was produced by touching the rims of the bowls with moistened fingers. Rims were painted different colors according to the pitch of the note.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Glass Armonica: Benjamin Franklin's Magical Musical Instrument|publisher=William Zeitler|url=http://www.glassarmonica.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[American Revolution|Independence]] and the [[Federalist Era]] (1776‚Äì1801)==
'''1776 [[Swivel chair]]'''
* A swivel or revolving chair is a chair with a single central leg that allows the seat to spin around. Swivel chairs can have wheels on the base allowing the user to glide the chair around their work area without getting up. This type of chair is common in modern offices and is often also referred to as an office chair. Using an English-style [[Windsor chair]] which was possibly made and purchased from [[Francis Trumble]] or Philadelphia cabinet-maker Benjamin Randolph, [[Thomas Jefferson]] invented the swivel chair in 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Fahlman| first = Bradley D.| title = Materials Chemistry| url = https://books.google.com/?id=zKcd0IJDWTsC| year = 2011| publisher = Springer| isbn = 9789400706934 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson heavily modified the Windsor chair and incorporated top and bottom parts connected by a central iron spindle, enabling the top half known as the [[Chair|seat]], to swivel on casters of the type used in rope-hung windows. When the [[Second Continental Congress]] convened in Philadelphia, Jefferson's swivel chair is purported to be where he drafted the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. Jefferson later had the swivel chair sent to his Virginia plantation, [[Monticello]], where he later built a "writing paddle" onto its side in 1791. Since 1836, the chair has been in the possession of the [[American Philosophical Society]] located in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Windsor Writing Chairs|publisher=Gregory Le Fever|url=http://www.gregorylefever.com/pdfs/Writing%20Chair%202.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1782 [[Flatboat]]'''
* A flatboat is a rectangular [[boat]] with a flat bottom and square ends generally used for freight and passengers on inland waterways. After serving in the [[Pennsylvania Line]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]], [[Jacob Yoder]] invented and built a large boat at the [[Redstone Old Fort]] on the [[Monongahela River]], which he freighted with flour and carried to [[New Orleans]] in May 1782. This was the first attempt to navigate the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi rivers]] for commercial purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flatboat History|publisher=Jane's Saddlebag|url=http://www.janessaddlebag.org/about-us/big-bone-lick-area-history/flatboat-history.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091119000210/http://www.janessaddlebag.org/about-us/big-bone-lick-area-history/flatboat-history.html|archivedate=2009-11-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Materials Chemistry"/&gt;

'''1784 [[Bifocals]]'''

[[Benjamin Franklin]] is credited with the invention of the first pair of bifocals in the early 1760s, though according to the [[Library Company of Philadelphia]], the first indication of Dr. Franklin wearing his double spectacles comes from a political cartoon printed in 1764. Many publications from that period onward refer to Dr. Franklin's double spectacles, including his first reference to them in a letter written in Paris, France on August 21, 1784, that was addressed to his personal friend, English philanthropist [[George Whatley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 'Inventor' of Bifocals?|publisher=The College of Optometrists|url=http://www.college-optometrists.org/en/knowledge-centre/museyeum/online_exhibitions/artgallery/bifocals.cfm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613044912/http://www.college-optometrists.org/en/knowledge-centre/museyeum/online_exhibitions/artgallery/bifocals.cfm|archivedate=2011-06-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benjamin Franklin-Father of the Bifocal|publisher=Antique Spectacles|url=http://www.antiquespectacles.com/topics/franklin/franklin.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1785 [[Diffraction grating|Artificial diffraction grating]]'''

*In optics, a diffraction grating is an optical component with a regular pattern, which diffracts light into several beams.

'''1787 [[Flour mill|Automatic flour mill]]'''

*Classical mill designs were generally powered by water or air. In water-powered mills, a sluice gate opens a channel, starts the water flowing, and a water wheel turning. In 1787, American inventor [[Oliver Evans]] revolutionized this labor-intensive process by building the first fully automatic mill using bucket elevators, screw conveyors, and the hopper boy to spread, cool, and dry the meal between grinding and bolting. This was the first time that anyone had conceived and executed a system of continuous, fully automatic production.&lt;ref name="Materials Chemistry"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alba Boardman Johnson Collection of Oliver Evans Manuscripts, 1786‚Äì1808|publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of American History|url=http://invention.smithsonian.org/resources/MIND_Repository_Details.aspx?rep_id=525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1792 [[Cracker (food)|Cracker]]'''
* A cracker is a type of biscuit that developed from military hardtack and nautical ship biscuits. Crackers are now usually eaten with soup, or topped with cheese, caviar, or other delicacies. The holes in crackers are called "docking" holes as a means to stop air pockets from forming in the cracker while baking. Crackers trace their origin to the year 1792 when John Pearson of [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]] invented a cracker-like bread product from just flour and water that he called "[[pilot bread]]". An immediate success with sailors because of its shelf life, it also became distinctly known as a hardtack or sea biscuit for long voyages away from home while at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Saddleback| first = Under licence| title = Read, Reflect, Respond - Book 2| url = https://books.google.com/?id=WQu5Al02Y1IC&amp;pg=PA20| publisher = R.I.C.

'''1793 [[Cotton gin]]'''
* The cotton gin is a machine that separates cotton fibers from seedpods and sometimes sticky seeds, a job previously done by hand. These seeds are either used again to grow more cotton or, if badly damaged, disposed of. The cotton gin uses a combination of a wire screen and small wire hooks to pull the cotton through the screen, while brushes continuously remove the loose cotton lint to prevent jams. In 1793, [[Eli Whitney]] invented the cotton gin and later received a patent on March 14, 1794.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fascinating facts about Eli Whitney inventor of Cotton Gin in 1793|publisher=The Great Idea Finder|url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventors/whitney.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitney's cotton gin could have possibly ignited a revolution in the cotton industry and the rise of "[[King Cotton]]" as the main cash crop in [[Southern United States|the South]]. However, it never made him rich. Instead of buying his machine, farmers built inferior versions of their own which led to the increasing need for African-American slave labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eli Whitney The Invention of the Cotton Gin|publisher=Julian Rubin|url=http://www.juliantrubin.com/bigten/whitneycottongin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The Jefferson disk, or wheel cypher, is a [[cipher system]] for encrypting messages and used as a deterrent for [[codebreaking]]. Using 26 wheels, each with the letters of the alphabet arranged randomly around them, [[Thomas Jefferson]] invented the wheel cypher in 1795. Falling in and out of use and obscurity, the wheel cypher was "re-invented" twice: first by a French government official around 1890, and then just prior to [[World War I]] by an officer in the [[United States Army]]. Designated as [[M-94]], the latter version was used by the United States Army and other military services from 1922 to the beginning of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas Jefferson's Wheel Cipher|publisher=Ann M.

'''1796 [[Rumford fireplace]]'''

*The Rumford fireplace created a sensation in 1796 when [[Benjamin Thompson Rumford]] introduced the idea of restricting the chimney opening to increase the updraught. Rumford fireplaces were common from 1796, when Benjamin Rumford first wrote about them, until about 1850. [[Thomas Jefferson]] had them built at Monticello, and [[Henry David Thoreau]] listed them among the [[modern conveniences]] that everyone took for granted. Rumford and his workers changed fireplaces by inserting bricks into the hearth to make the side walls angled and added a choke to the chimney to increase the speed of air going up the flue. It produced a streamlined air flow, reducing turbulence so the smoke would go up into the chimney rather than choking the residents. Rumford fireplaces are appreciated for their tall classic elegance and heating efficiency. This simple alteration in the design of fireplaces were copied everywhere in an age when fires were the principal source of heat. The Rumford fireplace is still used in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Rumford Fireplace, Anyway?|publisher=Jim Buckley|url=http://www.rumford.com/articleWhat.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1796 [[Cupcake]]'''
[[File:WikiXDC Cupcakes A.jpg|180px|left|thumb|Two cupcakes iced with the Wikipedia logo on their tops]]
*A cupcake, fairy cake, patty cake or cup cake is a small cake designed to serve one person, frequently baked in a small, thin paper or aluminum cup. As with larger cakes, frosting and other cake decorations, such as sprinkles, are common on cupcakes. The earliest reference of cupcakes can be traced as far back as 1796, when a recipe notation of "a cake to be baked in small cups" was written in ''American Cookery'' by Amelia Simms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Food Timeline|publisher=Lynne Olver|url=http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodcakes.html#cupcakes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first use of the term "cupcake" was in ''Seventy-five Receipts for Pastry, Cakes, and Sweetmeats'' in 1828 in Eliza Leslie's ''Receipts'' cookbook where it referred to the use of a cup for measuring the ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cupcake History|publisher=Krystina Castella|url=http://www.crazyaboutcupcakes.com/learning.htm#history}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1801 [[Suspension bridge]]'''

*A suspension bridge is a type of bridge in which the deck, the load-bearing portion, is hung below suspension cables on vertical suspenders that carry the weight of the deck below, upon which traffic crosses. Primitive in their earliest form, the ancestor to what is now considered a suspension bridge, the [[simple suspension bridge]], was developed sometime around 2000 BC in [[China]] and [[India]], relying upon ropes thrown across a narrow gorge or river, from which people could hang as they crawled across. With the extreme dangers of swinging back and forth, these simple suspension bridges were deemed impractical as horses as well as carriages later found it difficult to maneuver across their wooden planks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronology of Bridges|publisher=Bridgeman|url=http://www.nireland.com/bridgeman/Chronology.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world's first suspension bridge in a modern sense, the ''Jacob's Creek Bridge'' at approximately 70 feet in length, was invented by [[James Finley (engineer)|James Finley]] of [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania]] in 1801,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iron Wire of the Wheeling Suspension Bridge|publisher=Smithsonian Museum Conservation Institute|url=http://www.si.edu/mci/english/research/past_projects/iron_wire_bridge.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; who designed vertical towers to elevate the curved iron cables and to stiffen trusses in order to make the deck of bridges architecturally sound for passing travelers. Nowadays, suspension bridges use steel cables. However, the suspension bridge and its basic, fundamental design of which Finley is duly accredited to inventing, is still evident today in suspension bridges found throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Making of the Modern World|publisher=The Science Museum|url=http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk/learning_modules/maths/02.TU.03/?section=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1801 [[Fire hydrant]]'''
* A fire hydrant is an active fire protection measure, and a source of water provided in most urban, suburban and rural areas with municipal water service to enable firefighters to tap into the municipal water supply to assist in extinguishing a fire. Before the existence of fire hydrants, a primitive fire suppression system known as "fire plugs" consisted of burying a wooden water pipe (often no more than a hollowed out log) along the streets for teams of bucket brigades to form and fight fires. Wooden pegs would then need to be hammered over fire plugs in order to stop the flow of water.&lt;ref name="Fire Service History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fire Service History|publisher=Brookside Fire Company Inc.|url=http://www.brooksidefire.org/fire%20service%20history.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of a post or pillar type fire hydrant is generally credited to Frederick Graff Sr., Chief Engineer of the Philadelphia Water Works around the year 1801.&lt;ref name="Materials Chemistry"/&gt; It had a combination hose/faucet outlet and was of "wet barrel" design with the valve in the top. It is said that Graff held the first patent for a fire hydrant, but this cannot be verified due to the fact that the patent office in [[Washington D.C.]] was burned to the ground in 1836 where all patent records from that time period were destroyed in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Bried History of the Hydrant|publisher=Fire Hydrant.org|url=http://www.firehydrant.org/pictures/hydrant_history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, [[Birdsill Holly]] invented the modern version of the fire hydrant. While Holly was only one of many involved in the development of the fire hydrant, innovations he introduced are largely responsible for the fire hydrant taken for granted today. In 1869, Holly was issued U.S. patent #94749, for an "improved fire hydrant".&lt;ref name="Fire Service History"/&gt;

'''1802 [[Banjo clock]]'''
[[File:Banjo clock 001.JPG|180px|left|thumb|An example of a banjo clock]]
*A banjo clock is a wall clock with an inverted banjo-shaped case. The banjo clock normally lacks a [[Striking clock|striking mechanism]] and indicates time only by its hands and dial, for which reason some [[Horology|horologists]] may insist upon calling it a timepiece rather than a true clock. The clock is usually adorned with a [[finial]] on the top. Known as his "patent timepiece", the banjo clock was invented by renowned American clockmaker [[Simon Willard]] of [[Roxbury, Massachusetts]], and patented on February 8, 1802.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Simon Willard|publisher=Encyclop√¶dia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/643933/Simon-Willard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Banjo clock|publisher=Encyclop√¶dia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/51881/banjo-clock}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Jobe| first1 = Brock| last2 = O'Brien| first2 = Jack| last3 = Sullivan| first3 = Gary R.| title = Harbor &amp; home furniture of southeastern Massachusetts, 1710-1850| url = https://books.google.com/?id=f73DOPoRibIC&amp;pg=PA301| year = 2009| publisher = UPNE| isbn = 978-0-912724-68-3| page = 101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1804 [[Burr Truss]]'''

*The Burr Arch Truss, Burr Truss, or the Burr Arch, is a combination of an arch and a multiple kingpost truss design typically implemented in the construction of covered bridges. The design principle behind the Burr arch truss was that the arch should be capable of holding the entire load on the bridge while the truss was used to keep the bridge rigid. In 1804, American architect [[Theodore Burr]], a cousin of then Vice President of the United States, [[Aaron Burr]], designed and built the first Burr Truss on a bridge over the Hudson River in Watertown, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Burr Truss|publisher=Naturally Fuzzy|url=http://www.naturallyfuzzy.com/Bridges/burr.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1805 [[Amphibious vehicle]]'''

*An amphibious vehicle is one which can be used on land or water. The self-propelled variant was invented by [[Oliver Evans]] who named it the "Orukter Amphibolos". Its steam-powered engine drove either wooden wheels or a paddle wheel used as a means of transport, on land and in water. Evans demonstrated his machine in Philadelphia's Center Square in 1805, built on commission from the Philadelphia Board of Health. Evans' steam engine differed fundamentally from later models, operating at a high pressure, 25 or 30 pounds. Many years later, Evans' invention would be sold off for parts. On July 16, 2005, Philadelphia celebrated the 200th anniversary of Oliver Evans's Orukter Amphibolos. Many historians describe Oliver Evans' invention as the United States' first land and water transporter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Was This America's First Steamboat, Locomotive, and Car?|publisher=Invention &amp; Technology Magazine|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2006/4/2006_4_16_print.shtml|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622133304/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2006/4/2006_4_16_print.shtml|archivedate=2009-06-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1805 [[Vapor-compression refrigeration]]'''
[[File:Gorrie Ice Machine.png|180px|left|thumb|Schematic of Gorrie's 1841 ice machine]]
*Refrigeration is the process of removing heat from an enclosed space, or from a substance, and moving it to a place where it is unobjectionable. The primary purpose of refrigeration is lowering the temperature of the enclosed space or substance and then maintaining that lower temperature. The American inventor [[Oliver Evans]], acclaimed as the "father of refrigeration", invented the [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] machine in 1805. Heat would be removed from the environment by recycling vaporized refrigerant, where it would move through a [[Gas compressor|compressor]] and [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]], where it would eventually revert to a liquid form in order to repeat the refrigeration process over again.

*Most modern sewing machines use the lockstitch technique of sewing invented by Walter Hunt, which consists of two threads, an upper and a lower. The upper thread runs from a spool kept on a spindle on top of or next to the machine, through a tension mechanism, a take-up arm, and finally through the hole in the needle. The lower thread is wound onto a bobbin, which is inserted into a case in the lower section of the machine. [[Walter Hunt (inventor)|Walter Hunt]] invented the first lock-stitch sewing machine in 1833.

[[Isaac Singer]] infringed on Howe's patent to make his own machine, making him wealthy. Elias Howe filed a lawsuit, alleging patent infringement. On July 1, 1854, a federal commission ruled in favor of Howe, ordering Isaac Singer as well as all sewing machine makers to pay Elias Howe royalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patent Office Rules in Favor of Elias Howe|publisher=Massachusetts Foundation for the Humanities|url=http://massmoments.org/moment.cfm?mid=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1834 [[Combine harvester]]'''
[[File:Combine-harvesting-corn.jpg|180px|left|thumb|A John Deere combine harvesting corn]]
*The combine harvester, or combine, or thresher, is a machine that combines the tasks of harvesting, threshing, and cleaning grain crops.

[[File:William Burt Solar Compass.jpg|180px|left|thumb|William Austin Burt's solar compass]]
*A solar compass is a railroad compass with a solar attachment that allows surveyors to determine the north direction by reference to the sun rather than by reference to the magnetic needle. It consists of three arcs: one for setting the latitude of the land to be surveyed; one for setting the declination of the sun; and one for setting the hour of the day. In 1835, the solar compass was invented by [[William Austin Burt]], a U.S. Deputy Surveyor who began surveying government lands in the [[Michigan Territory]] earlier in 1833. While experiencing great difficulty in using his standard vernier compass in order to detect deposits of iron ore in the [[Northwest Territory]] (present-day [[Wisconsin]]), Burt devised the solar compass so that garbled readings of the Earth's magnetic field and north-south survey lines would be easier to find.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Compass|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/surveying/type.cfm?typeid=17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514032105/http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/surveying/type.cfm?typeid=17|archivedate=2011-05-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Burt's Solar Compass|publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/museum/artifacts/archives/002627.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; A patent was issued to Burt on February 25, 1836.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1836 Solar Compass Patent|publisher=Virtual Museum of Surveying|url=http://www.surveyhistory.org/1836_solar_compass_patent1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1836 [[Morse code]]'''
[[File:J38TelegraphKey.jpg|180px|left|thumb|A typical "straight key" model used for transmitting and transcribing Morse code]]
*Morse code is a type of character encoding that transmits telegraphic information using rhythm. Morse code uses a standardized sequence of short and long elements to represent the letters, numerals, punctuation, and special characters of a given message. After many years of development, an electrical telegraph came to exclusively refer to a signaling telegram, as an operator makes and breaks an electrical contact with a telegraph key, resulting in an audible signal at the other end produced by a telegraph sounder which is interpreted and transcribed by an operator. The short and long elements are formed by sounds, marks, or pulses, in on off keying and are commonly known as "dots" and "dashes" or "dits" and "dahs". In 1832, [[Alfred Vail]] in collaboration with [[Samuel Morse]], began the process of co-inventing the Morse code signalling alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Morse Telegraphy|publisher=Amateur Radio Courses|url=http://www.ukradioamateur.co.uk/extra/morse/html/c19a.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a few minor changes, including the development of [[International Morse code]] which is distinct from the original encoding system, [[American Morse code]], Morse code was standardized in 1865 by the International Telegraphy Congress in Paris, France and later made the norm by the International Telecommunication Union. After 160 years of continuous use, international regulations beginning on January 31, 1999, no longer required ships at sea to call for help in an emergency using Morse code or the famous SOS signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Morse: the end of an era?|publisher=UNESCO|url=http://www.unesco.org/courier/1999_08/uk/connex/txt1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A gridiron is a metal grate with parallel bars typically used for grilling meat, fish, vegetables, or combinations of such foods. It may also be two such grids, hinged to fold together, to securely hold food while grilling over an open flame. Gridironing is often performed outdoors, using charcoal (real wood or preformed briquettes), wood, or propane gas. The earliest gridiron was a combination hinged gridiron and spider co-invented in 1836 by Amasa and George Sizer of Meriden, Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Journal of the American Institute| url = https://books.google.com/?id=ahBKAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA161| year = 1837| publisher = T.B.

*A circuit breaker is an automatically operated electrical switch designed to protect an electrical circuit from damage caused by overload or short circuit. Its basic function is to detect a fault condition and, by interrupting continuity, to immediately discontinue electrical flow. Unlike a fuse, which operates once and then has to be replaced, a circuit breaker can be reset (either manually or automatically) to resume normal operation. Circuit breakers are made in varying sizes, from small devices that protect an individual household appliance up to large switchgear designed to protect high voltage circuits feeding an entire city. Inspired by the works of American scientist [[Joseph Henry]] and English scientist [[Michael Faraday]], the circuit breaker was invented by an American, [[Charles Grafton Page]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Handy| first1 = William Matthews| last2 = Higgins| first2 = Charles| title = The Making of America| url = https://books.google.com/?id=Z3JN-3bdkrkC&amp;pg=PA1| year = 1906| publisher = BiblioBazaar, LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1837 [[Plough|Self-polishing cast steel plow]]'''

*The plow is a tool used in farming for initial cultivation of soil in preparation for sowing seed or planting. It has been a basic instrument for most of recorded history, and represents one of the major advances in agriculture. In modern use, a plowed field is typically left to dry out, and is harrowed before planting. An American agricultural pioneer named [[John Deere (inventor)|John Deere]] modernized the plow by shaping steel from an old sawmill blade and joining it to a wrought iron moldboard. Deere polished both parts smooth so the damp soil would no longer stick. After patenting the device in 1837, it became an instant success and a necessity on American farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Self-Polishing Cast Steel Plow|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/deere.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1839 [[Maize|Corn sheller]]'''

*A corn sheller or maize sheller, is a machine used to shell or shuck ears of sweet corn of their silk. By feeding ears of sweet corn into a concentric cylindrical rest, they are parallel to the axis of the shelling cylinder in a hopper fixed on one side of the machine. As the cylindrical rest revolves, an ear falls into each space between staves, and is kept in contact with the shelling cylinder by the pressure of the segment concave. The grain shelled falls beneath the machine and the ear of sweet corn is delivered at the side opposite to the hopper, after having been in contact with the cylinder during approximately four or five revolutions. The corn sheller was invented by Lester E. Denison of Sayville, Connecticut who received a patent on August 12, 1839.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report on Mr. L.E.

'''1839 [[Sleeping car]]'''
* The sleeping car or sleeper is a railroad passenger car that can accommodate passengers in beds, primarily to make nighttime travel more restful. The first such cars saw sporadic use on American railroads in the 1830s and could be configured for coach seating during the day. The pioneer of this new mode of traveling transcontinental was the [[Cumberland Valley Railroad]] which introduced service of the first sleeping car in the spring of 1939. The sleeping car did not become commercially practical until 1857 when [[George Pullman]] invented the Pullman sleeping car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Pullman|publisher=The New York Times Company|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/pstartinventors/a/George_Pullman.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1839 [[Vulcanized rubber]]'''
* [[Sulfur vulcanization|Vulcanization]] refers to a specific curing process of rubber involving heat and the addition of sulfur or other equivalent curatives. It is a chemical process in which polymer molecules are linked to other polymer molecules by atomic bridges composed of sulfur atoms or carbon-to-carbon bonds. A vast array of products are made with vulcanized rubber including ice hockey pucks, tires, shoe soles, hoses and many more. When "rubber fever" struck Boston in the 1830s, there was a large consumer demand for products made of rubber- aprons, life preservers, hats, carriage tops, and, by 1836, waterproof shoes. But in the heat of summer, rubber goods turned into a gooey, foul-smelling mess; in the winter, they froze stiff. In 1839, [[Charles Goodyear]] had a breakthrough when he mixed liquid latex with sulfur and heating it in the sun or over a stove top. The leather-like form of the stretchable substance resulted in the first vulcanized rubber. Goodyear received a patent on June 15, 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Goodyear Receives patent for Vulcanized Rubber|publisher=Massachusetts Foundation for the Humanities|url=http://massmoments.org/moment.cfm?mid=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Babbitt, also called Babbitt metal or bearing metal, is any of several alloys characterized by its resistance to galling. Babbitt is most commonly used as a thin surface layer in a complex, multi-metal structure, but its original use was as a cast-in-place bulk bearing material. Babbitt metal was invented in 1839 for use in [[steam engines]] by American goldsmith [[Isaac Babbitt]] in [[Taunton, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Babbitt Metal|publisher=Encyclop√¶dia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/47392/babbitt-metal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1843 [[Ice cream maker|Ice cream maker (hand-cranked)]]'''
[[File:WhiteMountainFreezer.jpg|left|180px|thumb|An early example of a hand-cranked ice cream maker]]
*An ice cream maker is a machine used to make small quantities of ice cream at home. The machine may stir the mixture by hand-cranking or with an electric motor, and may chill the ice cream by using a freezing mixture, by pre-cooling the machine in a freezer, or by the machine itself refrigerating the mixture. An ice cream maker must freeze the mixture, and must simultaneously stir or churn it to prevent the formation of ice crystals and aerate it to produce smooth and creamy ice cream. In 1843, New England housewife Nancy Johnson invented the hand-cranked ice cream churn. She patented her invention but lacked the resources to make and market it herself. Johnson sold the patent for $200 to a Philadelphia kitchen wholesaler who, by 1847, made enough ice cream makers to satisfy the high demand. From 1847 to 1877, more than 70 improvements to ice cream makers were patented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Ice Cream|publisher=MakeIceCream.com|url=http://www.makeicecream.com/hisoficecrea.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704131533/http://www.makeicecream.com/hisoficecrea.html|archivedate=2008-07-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1843 [[Rotary printing press]]'''

*A rotary printing press is a printing press in which the images to be printed are curved around a cylinder. In 1843, [[Richard Hoe]] invented a revolution in printing by rolling a cylinder over stationary plates of inked type and using the cylinder to make an impression on paper. This eliminated the need for making impressions directly from the type plates themselves, which were heavy and difficult to maneuver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hall of Fame: Inventor Profile of Richard Hoe|publisher=Invent Now|url=http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/274.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baseball1866.JPG|180px|left|thumb|A sketch of an early baseball game played at Elysian Fields, Hoboken, New Jersey]]
*As the United States' ''de facto'' [[national sport]] and pastime, baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players each. Many historians attribute baseball's origins to the English sports of [[stoolball]] and [[rounders]] as well as to the 18th and 19th century North American sports of [[Old Cat]] and [[Town ball]], all early precursors to baseball. However, the bat-and-ball sports played in the United States, Europe, or elsewhere in the world prior to 1845 did not resemble the standard of modern-day rules as to which baseball has continuously used ever since the mid-19th century. In 1845, [[Alexander Cartwright]] wrote the official and codified set of regulated rules of baseball formally known as the [[Knickerbocker Rules]]. Cartwright's original 14 rules were somewhat similar to but not identical to rounders. Three exceptions devised by Cartwright included the stipulations that the playing field had to be laid out in a diamond shape rather than a square used in rounders, foul territories were to be introduced for the first time, and the practice of retiring a runner by hitting him with a thrown ball was forbidden. On June 19, 1846, the Knickerbocker Rules were instituted for the first time when Cartwright's [[New York Knickerbockers]] competed against the New York Nine, in what is considered by the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]] in Cooperstown, New York as "the first modern base ball game".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexander Cartwright: First Modern Game of Baseball 1845|publisher=Baseball Historian|url=http://www.baseballhistorian.com/html/american_heroes.cfm?page=52|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000712030954/http://baseballhistorian.com/html/american_heroes.cfm?page=52|archivedate=2000-07-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Doubleday myth|myth]] of [[Abner Doubleday]] inventing baseball debunked and 46 years after his death, Cartwright in 1938, was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in the executive category.&lt;ref name="Ty Cobb"&gt;{{cite book| last = Rhodes| first = Don| title = Ty Cobb Safe at Home| url = https://books.google.com/?id=t7InOgXkqlAC| year = 2008| publisher = Globe Pequot| isbn = 978-0-7627-4480-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexander Cartwright|publisher=Alexander Cartwright|url=http://www.cmgww.com/baseball/cartwright/about/awards.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ED6LKBp4?url=http://www.cmgww.com/baseball/cartwright/about/awards.html|archivedate=2013-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 3, 1953, the [[83rd United States Congress]] unanimously credited Cartwright with inventing the modern sport of baseball.&lt;ref name="Ty Cobb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Year In Review : 1953 National League|publisher=Baseball Almanac|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/yearly/yr1953n.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*A jackhammer, also known as a pneumatic hammer, is a portable percussive drill powered by compressed air. It is used to drill rock and break up concrete pavement, among other applications. It jabs with its bit, not rotating it. A jackhammer operates by driving an internal hammer up and down. The hammer is first driven down to strike the back of the bit and then back up to return the hammer to the original position to repeat the cycle. The bit usually recovers from the stroke by means of a spring. The earliest form of a jackhammer, a "percussion drill" was invented in 1848 and patented in 1849 by Jonathan J.

'''1850 [[Feed dogs]]'''
* Feed dogs are the critical component of a "drop feed" sewing machine. A set of feed dogs typically resembles two or three short, thin metal bars, crosscut with diagonal teeth, which move back and forth in slots in a sewing machine's needle plate. Their purpose is to pull ("feed") the fabric through the machine, in discrete steps, in-between stitches. [[Allen B. Wilson]] invented it during the time period 1850 to 1854.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sewing Machines|publisher=1902 Encyclopedia|url=http://www.1902encyclopedia.com/S/SEW/sewing-machines.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. patent #12116 was issued on December 18, 1854.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Improvement in Sewing-Machines|publisher=Google Patents Search|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=3qpOAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=drawing&amp;zoom=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*A vibrating shuttle is a bobbin driver design used in home lockstitch sewing machines during the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. It supplanted the earlier [[Bobbin drivers|transverse shuttle]] design invented by [[Elias Howe]] in 1846, but was itself supplanted by the [[rotary hook]] later on. American cabinetmaker [[Allen B. Wilson]] of Willet, New York invented the vibrating shuttle design in 1850. The owners of the 1848 Bradshaw patent claimed infringement by Wilson. However, it was without justication. In order to avoid a lawsuit, Wilson relinquished his interest in U.S. Patent #7,776 that was issued to him on November 12, 1850. A.P.

'''1851 [[Fire alarm box]]'''
* A fire alarm box is an outdoor device used for notifying a fire department of a fire. Early boxes used the telegraph system and were the main method of calling the fire department to a neighborhood in the days before people had telephones. When the box is triggered, a spring-loaded wheel spins and taps out a signal onto the fire alarm telegraph wire, indicating the box number. The receiver at a fire station then can match the number to the neighborhood. The municipal fire alarm system got its start in Massachusetts. It was invented by [[Moses G. Farmer]], an engineer, and Dr. William Channing, a Harvard-educated Bostonian. Their revolutionary creation was installed in 1851 and consisted of 40 miles of wire and 45 boxes in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No Cause for Alarm|publisher=Boston Globe|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/01/27/no_cause_for_alarm/ | first=Emily|last=Sweeney|date=January 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1853 [[Potato chips]]'''
* Potato chips, also known as crisps in British English, are thin slices of potato that are deep fried or baked until crispy. Potato chips serve as an appetizer, side dish, or snack. The basic chips are cooked and salted, and additional varieties are manufactured using various flavorings and ingredients including seasonings, herbs, spices, cheeses, and artificial additives. The original potato chip recipe was invented by chef [[George Crum]] at Moon's Lake House near Saratoga Springs, New York, on August 24, 1853.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fascinating facts about the invention of the Potato Chips by George Crum in 1853|publisher=The Great Idea Finder|url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/potatochips.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fed up with a customer who continued to send his fried potatoes back complaining that they were too thick and soggy, Crum decided to slice the potatoes so thin that they could not be eaten with a fork. As they could not be fried normally in a pan, he decided to stir-fry the potato slices. Against Crum's expectation, the guest was ecstatic about the new chips and they soon became a regular item on the lodge's menu, and were known as "Saratoga chips".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bradley| first = Hugh| title = Such Was Saratoga| url = https://books.google.com/?id=UKXTpUj5F1oC&amp;pg=PA121| year = 1975| publisher = Ayer Publishing| isbn = 978-0-405-06901-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1857 [[Toilet paper|Toilet paper (mass-produced and rolled)]]'''
* Toilet paper is a soft paper product (tissue paper) used to maintain personal hygiene after human defecation or urination. However, it can also be used for other purposes such as absorbing spillages or craft projects. Toilet paper in different forms has been used for centuries, namely in China. The ancient Greeks used clay and stone; the Romans, sponges and salt water. But according to a CNN article, the idea of a commercial product designed solely to wipe a person's buttocks was by New York City entrepreneur [[Joseph Gayetty]], who in 1857, invented aloe-infused sheets of manila hemp dispensed from Kleenex-like boxes. However, Gayetty's toilet paper was a failure for several reasons. Americans soon grew accustomed to wiping with the Sears Roebuck catalog, they saw no need to spend money on toilet paper when catalogs for their use came in the mail for free, and because during the 19th century, it was a social taboo to openly discuss bathroom hygiene with others. Toilet paper took its next leap forward in 1890, when two brothers named Clarence and E. Irvin Scott of the [[Scott Paper Company]] co-invented rolled toilet paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why Toilet Paper Belongs to America|publisher=CNN|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/wayoflife/07/07/mf.toilet.paper.history/index.html | date=July 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In home canning, food is packed into a jar, and the steel lid is placed on top of the jar with the integral rubber seal resting on the rim of the jar. The band is screwed loosely over the lid, which will allow air and steam to escape. By far, though, the most popular form of seal was the screw-on zinc cap, the precursor to today's screw-on lids. The earliest glass jars were called wax sealers, because they used sealing wax, which was poured into a channel around the lip that held on a tin lid. The earliest successful application of this was discovered by [[John Landis Mason]] and patented on November 30, 1858, a date embossed on millions of jars for food preservation and pickling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mason Jar ‚Äì History|publisher=Highland Brands, LLC.|url=http://www.canningpantry.com/mason-jar-history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:100 1373.JPG|180px|left|thumb|A handful of jelly beans]]
*Jelly beans are a small bean-shaped type of confectionery with a hard candy shell and a gummy interior which come in a wide variety of flavors. The confection is primarily made of sugar. The [[Turkish Delight]], a Middle Eastern candy made of soft jelly, covered in confectioner's powder, with roots dating to biblical days, was an early precursor to the jelly bean that inspired its gummy interior. However, it is generally thought that jelly beans first surfaced in 1861 when Boston confectioner and inventor William Schrafft urged people to send his jelly beans to soldiers during the [[American Civil War]]. It wasn't until July 5, 1905, that the mentioning of jelly beans was published in the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]''. The advertisement publicized bulk jelly beans sold by volume for nine cents per pound, according to the book, "The Century in Food: America's Fads and Favorites". Today, most historians contend that in the United States, they were first linked with [[Easter]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Jelly Beans: A Colorful History and Association with Easter|publisher=AT&amp;T|url=http://www.att.net/s/editorial.dll?eetype=Article&amp;eeid=7733036&amp;render=y&amp;Table=&amp;ch=fh&amp;cat=hgarti&amp;dcatid=2036&amp;topcat=Article}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today it is worn by many people, and is particularly associated with ranch workers in the western and southern United States, western Canada and northern Mexico, with country-western singers, and for participants in the North American rodeo circuit. It is recognized around the world as part of Old West cowboy lore. The shape of a cowboy hat's crown and brim are often modified by the wearer for fashion and to protect against weather. The cowboy hat was invented in 1865 by [[John Batterson Stetson]] during a hunting trip, showing his companions how he could make fabric out of fur without weaving. Using the fur collected during the trip, his bare hands, and boiling water, Stetson made a piece of felt and then shaped it into a hat with a large brim which could protect him and his hunting party from weather elements such as rain, wind, and snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cowboy Hat History|publisher=CowboyHats.us.|url=http://www.cowboyhats.us/history.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A refrigerator car or "reefer" is a refrigerated boxcar, designed to carry perishable freight at specific temperatures. Refrigerator cars differ from simple insulated boxcars and ventilated boxcars, neither of which are fitted with cooling apparatus. They can be ice-cooled, or use one of a variety of mechanical refrigeration systems, or utilize carbon dioxide as a cooling agent. In the 1860s, slaughtered cattle from the [[Great Plains]] were preserved in barrels of salt. Regular box cars were loaded with ice in another effort to preserve fresh meat that had limited success. Generally, it was found more economical in the early days of refrigeration to cool the cars with ice or frozen brine which was periodically replenished at icing stations along rail routes. In 1857, the first shipment of refrigerated beef was made from the Chicago stockyards to the East Coast in an ordinary box car packed with ice. Finally in 1867, the first patent (U.S. Patent #71,423) for a specialized refrigerator car was issued to its inventor, J.B.

*American football, known in the United States simply as football, is a spectator sport known for combining strategy with competitive physical play. The objective of the game is to score points by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone. The ball can be advanced by carrying it (a running play) or by throwing it to a teammate (a passing play). Points can be scored in a variety of ways, including carrying the ball over the opponent's goal line, catching a pass thrown over that goal line, kicking the ball through the goal posts at the opponent's end zone, or tackling an opposing ball carrier within his end zone. The winner is the team with the most points when the time expires.

'''1870 [[Feather duster]]'''
* A feather duster is an implement used for cleaning. It consists typically of a wooden-dowel handle and feathers that are wound onto the handle by a wrapped wire. In 1870, the original idea for the feather duster was conceived in a broom factory in [[Jones County, Iowa]]. A farmer brought a bundle of turkey feathers into the factory asking if they could be used to assemble a brush. E.E. Hoag used these feathers to invent the first feather duster. Using a short [[broom stick]] and splitting the feathers with a [[pocket knife]], the duster was found to be too stiff for use. In 1874, the Hoag Duster Company was founded, which became a pioneer of feather dusters in the U.S. state of [[Iowa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Corbit| first = Robert McClain| title = History of Jones County, Iowa past and present, Volume 1| url = https://books.google.com/?id=b5gUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA477| year = 1910| publisher = S.

'''1873 [[Jeans]]'''

Jeans are trousers generally made from denim. Jeans became popular among teenagers starting in the 1950s which remains as a distinct icon of American fashion. In 1873, [[Levi Strauss]] and [[Jacob Davis (inventor)|Jacob Davis]] co-invented and co-patented the idea of using copper rivets at the stress points of sturdy work pants. After one of Davis' customers kept purchasing cloth to reinforce torn pants, he had an idea to use copper rivets to reinforce the points of strain, such as on the pocket corners and at the top of the button fly. Davis did not have the required money to purchase a patent, so he wrote to Strauss suggesting that they both go into business together. Early Levis, called "waist overalls", came in a brown canvas duck fabric and a heavy blue denim fabric. His business became extremely successful, revolutionizing the apparel industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fascinating facts about the invention of Blue Jeans by Jacob Davis and Levi Strauss in 1873|publisher=The Great Idea Finder|url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/bluejeans.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1878 [[Carbon microphone]]'''
* The carbon microphone is a sound-to-electrical signal transducer consisting of two metal plates separated by granules of carbon. When sound waves strike this plate, the pressure on the granules changes, which in turn changes the electrical resistance between the plates. A direct current is passed from one plate to the other, and the changing resistance results in a changing current, which can be passed through a telephone system, or used in other ways in electronics systems to change the sound into an electrical signal. After a lengthy court battle over patent rights filed in 1877, a United States federal court as well as a British court in 1878 ruled in favor of [[Thomas Alva Edison]] over a claim held by [[Emile Berliner]] since Edison indisputably preceded Berliner in inventing the transmission of speech as well as the use of carbon in a transmitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edison's Transmitter|publisher=Heritage Community Foundation|url=http://www.abheritage.ca/telephone/era/edisons_transmitter.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1878 [[Pelton wheel|Free jet water turbine]]'''
* A free jet water turbine or impulse water turbine, also commonly known as a Pelton's wheel, is a wheel that uses cups, or buckets, that are split down the middle by a metal divider, so that in effect two cups are mounted side-by-side at each "spoke" in the wheel. A high-pressure water jet aimed at the center of each bucket is split by the divider to hit each of cup, one on the left, the other on the right. The design of this water turbine takes advantage of a mechanics principle known as impulse, a force defined as the product of the force and the time during which it acts. In 1878, [[Lester Pelton]] invented his prototype known as the Pelton's wheel, first demonstrating it to miners in the Sierra Nevada. In 1880, Lester Pelton received a patent for his invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free Jet Water Turbine|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/pelton.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1883 [[Salt water taffy]]'''
* Salt water taffy is a variety of soft [[taffy (candy)|taffy]]. Despite the name, it does not contain sea water. The legend of how salt water taffy got its name is disputed. The most popular story, although unconfirmed, concerns a candy-store owner, David Bradley, whose shop was flooded during a major storm in 1883. His entire stock of taffy was soaked with salty Atlantic Ocean water. When a young girl came into his shop and asked if he had any taffy for sale, he is said to have offered some "salt water taffy". At the time it was a joke, because all his taffy had been soaked with salt water, but the girl was delighted, she bought the candy and proudly walked down to the beach to show her friends. Bradley's mother was in the back and heard the exchange. She loved the name and so Salt Water Taffy was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Salt water taffy history |publisher=HungryMonster.com |url=http://www.hungrymonster.com/FoodFacts/Food_Facts.cfm?Phrase_vch=Candy&amp;fid=6706 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524081109/http://www.hungrymonster.com/FoodFacts/Food_Facts.cfm?Phrase_vch=Candy&amp;fid=6706 |archivedate=May 24, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nellis AFB Solar panels.jpg|180px|left|thumb|Solar panels at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada generating and absorbing the sun's natural light]]
A solar cell is any device that directly converts the energy in light into electrical energy through the process of photovoltaics. Although French physicist [[Antoine-C√©sar Becquerel]] discovered the [[photovoltaic effect]] much earlier in 1839, the first solar cell, according to Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, was invented by [[Charles Fritts]] in 1883, who used junctions formed by coating selenium with an extremely thin layer of gold. In 1941, the silicon solar cell was invented by another American named [[Russell Ohl]]. Drawing upon Ohl's work, three American researchers named Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller, and Daryl Chapin essentially introduced the first practical use of [[solar panel]]s through their improvement of the silicone solar cell in 1954, which by placing them in direct sunlight, free electrons are turned into electric current enabling a six percent energy conversion efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of a Solar Cell ‚Äì History of Solar Cells|publisher=The New York Times Company|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/sstartinventions/a/solar_cell.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1883 [[Thermostat]]'''

A thermostat is a device for regulating the temperature of a system so that the system's temperature is maintained near a desired setpoint temperature. The thermostat does this by switching heating or cooling devices on or off, or regulating the flow of a heat transfer fluid as needed, to maintain the correct temperature. The thermostat was invented in 1883 by Warren S. Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thermostat Maker Deploys Climate Control Against Climate Change|publisher=America.Gov|url=http://www.america.gov/st/business-english/2008/July/20080710104405saikceinawz0.5803339.html#|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807114308/http://www.america.gov/st/business-english/2008/July/20080710104405saikceinawz0.5803339.html|archivedate=2009-08-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Photographic film is a sheet of material coated with a photosensitive emulsion. When the emulsion is sufficiently exposed to light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation such as X-rays and is developed it forms an image. [[George Eastman]] and his company, [[Eastman Kodak]], invented the first flexible photographic film as well as the invention of [[roll film]] in 1885. This original "film" used a paper carrier. The first transparent plastic film was produced in 1889. Before this, glass photographic plates were used, which were far more expensive and cumbersome, although of better quality due to their size. Early film was made from flammable nitrocellulose with camphor as a plasticizer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Eastman ‚Äì History of Kodak and Rolled Photographic Film|publisher=The New York Times Company|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/estartinventors/ss/George_Eastman.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1887 [[Gramophone record]]'''
[[File:LittleWonderAlbumDisplay.jpg|180px|left|thumb|A selection of gramophone records and an album]]

A gramophone record, commonly known as a record, or a vinyl record, is an analog sound storage medium consisting of a flat disc with an inscribed, modulated spiral groove. The groove usually starts near the periphery and ends near the center of the disc. Ever since Thomas Edison invented the phonograph in 1877, it produced distorted sound because of gravity's pressure on the playing stylus. In response, [[Emile Berliner]] invented a new medium for recording and listening to sound in 1887 in the form of a horizontal disc, originally known as the "platter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The disk gramophone|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/berliner.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A slot machine is a casino gambling machine. Due to the vast number of possible wins with the original poker card based game, it proved practically impossible to come up with a way to make a machine capable of making an automatic pay-out for all possible winning combinations. The first "one-armed bandit" was invented in 1887 by [[Charles Fey]] of San Francisco, California who devised a simple automatic mechanism with three spinning reels containing a total of five symbols&amp;nbsp;‚Äì horseshoes, diamonds, spades, hearts and a Liberty Bell, which also gave the machine its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Fey- Slot Machine Inventor|publisher=The New York Times Company|url=http://casinogambling.about.com/od/slots/a/charlesfey.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1887 [[Softball]]'''

As a bat-and-ball team sport, softball is a variant of [[baseball]]. The difference between the two sports is that softball uses larger balls and requires a smaller playing field.

* A comptometer is a mechanical or electro-mechanical adding machine. The comptometer was the first adding device to be driven solely by the action of pressing keys, which are arranged in an array of vertical and horizontal columns. Although the comptometer was designed primarily for adding, it could also do division, multiplication, and subtraction. Special comptometers with varying key arrays were produced for a variety of purposes, including calculating currencies, time and Imperial measures of weight. The original design was invented and patented in 1887 by [[Dorr Felt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Felt &amp; Tarrant Comptometer |publisher=System Source|url=http://www.syssrc.com/html/museum/html/felt.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1888 [[Induction motor]]'''
[[File:Motors01CJC.jpg|180px|left|thumb|Examples of modern induction motors]]
An [[induction motor]] is an AC electric motor in which the electric current in the rotor needed to produce torque is induced by electromagnetic induction from the magnetic field of the stator winding instead of using mechanical commutation (brushes) that caused sparking in earlier electric motors. They are also self-starting. The Serbian-American inventor [[Nikola Tesla]] explored the idea of using a rotating magnetic induction field principle, using it in his invention of a poly-phase induction motor using [[alternating current]] which he received a patent for on May 1, 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The electro-magnetic motor|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/tesla.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;October 12, 1887, Tesla filed U.S. patent #381,968 for an electro-magnetic motor which in the application, claimed to have invented the AC motor as well as a new power distribution system. {{cite web|title=Tesla's Electro-magnetic motor|publisher=IEEE|url= http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Tesla's_Electro-magnetic_motor}} The patent was granted on May 1, 1888 {{cite web|title=Electro-magnetic motor|publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office|url= http://www.google.com/patents/US381968?printsec=abstract#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rights to Tesla's invention were licensed by [[George Westinghouse]] for the AC power system his company was developing.

The induction motor Tesla patented in the U.S. is considered to have been an independent invention since the Europe Italian physicist [[Galileo Ferraris]] published a paper on a rotating magnetic field based induction motor on 11 March 1888, almost two months before Tesla was granted his patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Galileo Ferraris Physicist, Pioneer of Alternating Current Systems (1847-1897) Inventor of the Induction Motor "Father of three-phase current" - Electrotechnical Congress, Frankfurt 1891|url=http://edisontechcenter.org/GalileoFerraris.html|publisher=Edison Tech Center|accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smil2005"&gt;{{cite book| last = Smil| first = Vaclav| title = Creating the Twentieth CenturyTechnical Innovations of 1867-1914 and Their Lasting Impact| url = https://books.google.com/?id=YnA2YXVFhIYC&amp;pg=PA76| date = 14 July 2005| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-988341-7| page = 76 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Drury| first = Bill| title = Control Techniques Drives and Controls Handbook| url = https://books.google.com/?id=vDQHzeEmSfUC| year = 2001| publisher = IET| isbn = 978-0-85296-793-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Boldea| first1 = Ion| last2 = Nasar| first2 = Syed A.| title = The Induction Machine Handbook| url = https://books.google.com/?id=thOPkFjrj5MC&amp;pg=PA2| year = 2001| publisher = CRC Press| isbn = 978-1-4200-4265-8| page = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A working model of the Ferraris inductionmotor may have been demonstrated at the University of Turin as early as 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Suss Langsdorf, Theory of alternating-current machinery - 1955, page 245&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Actes - Volume 1; Volume 10, 1964, page 427&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia Americana'' - Volume 19, 1977, page 518&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kinetoscope was an early motion picture exhibition device. It was designed for films to be viewed individually through the window of a cabinet housing its components. The Kinetoscope introduced the basic approach that would become the standard for all cinematic projection before the advent of video, creating the illusion of movement by conveying a strip of perforated film bearing sequential images over a light source with a high-speed shutter. First described in conceptual terms by [[Thomas Alva Edison]] in 1888, his invention was largely developed by one of his assistants, William Kennedy Laurie Dickson, between 1889 and 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edison Motion Pictures|publisher=Library of Congress, Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/edhtml/edmvhm.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1888 [[Trolley pole]]'''

A trolley pole is a tapered cylindrical pole of wood or metal placed in contact with an overhead wire to provide electricity to the trolley car. The trolley pole sits atop a sprung base on the roof of the trolley vehicle, the springs maintaining the tension to keep the trolley wheel or shoe in contact with the wire. Occasionally, a Canadian named John Joseph Wright is credited with inventing the trolley pole when an experimental tramway in Toronto, Ontario, was built in 1883. While Wright may have assisted in the installation of railways at the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE), and may even have used a pole system, there is no hard evidence to prove it. Likewise, Wright never filed or was issued a patent.&lt;ref name="Library and Archives Canada"&gt;{{cite web|title=Patents of Invention and the Story of Canadian Innovation|publisher=Library and Archives Canada|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/innovations/023020-2720-e.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official credit for the invention of the electric trolley pole has gone to an American, [[Frank J.

The drinking straw is a tube used for transferring a liquid to the mouth, usually a drink from one location to another. The first crude forms of drinking straws were made of dry, hollow, rye grass. [[Marvin Stone]] is the inventor of the drinking straw. Stone, who worked in a factory that made paper cigarette holders, did not like this design because it made beverages taste like grass. As an alternative, on January 3, 1888, Stone got a piece of paper from his factory and wrapped it around a pencil. By coating it with wax, his drinking straw became leak-proof so that it would not get waterlogged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Straight Truth About the Flexible Drinking Straw|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|url=http://invention.smithsonian.org/resources/online_articles_detail.aspx?id=301|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013061838/http://invention.smithsonian.org/Resources/online_articles_detail.aspx?id=301|archivedate=2009-10-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1888 [[Stepping switch]]'''
[[File:Uniselector Stepper detail.jpg|180px|left|thumb|An example of a Strowger-type selector assembly]]
In electrical controls, a stepping switch, also known as a stepping relay, is an electromechanical device which allows an input connection to be connected to one of a number of possible output connections, under the control of a series of electrical pulses. The major use for these devices was in early automatic [[telephone exchanges]] to route telephone calls. It can step on one axis (called a uniselector), or on two axes (a [[Strowger switch]]). As the first automated telephone switch using electromagnets and hat pins, stepping switches were invented by [[Almon Brown Strowger]] in 1888. Strowger filed his patent application on March 12, 1889, and it was issued on March 10, 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strowger - Invention of the Telephone Switch|publisher=Strowger|url=http://www.strowger.com/about-us/strowger-invention-of-telephone-switch.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822185417/http://www.strowger.com/about-us/strowger-invention-of-telephone-switch.html|archivedate=2010-08-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1888 [[Revolving door]]'''

A revolving door has three or four doors that hang on a center shaft and rotate around a vertical axis within a round enclosure. In high-rise buildings, regular doors are hard to open because of air pressure differentials.

A flexible flyer or steel runner sled is a steerable wooden [[sled]] with thin metal runners whereby a rider may sit upright on the sled or lie on their stomach, allowing the possibility to descend a snowy slope feet-first or head-first. To steer the sled, the rider may either push on the wooden cross piece with their hands or feet, or pull on the rope attached to the wooden cross-piece. The flexible flyer was invented in 1889 by Philadelphia resident [[Samuel Leeds Allen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sledding at Westtown|publisher=Westtown School|url=http://www.westtown.edu/about-westtown/history/more-history/sledding-at-westtown/index.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720112950/http://www.westtown.edu/about-westtown/history/more-history/sledding-at-westtown/index.aspx|archivedate=2011-07-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. patent #408,681 was issued to Allen on August 13, 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sled|publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=moJfAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1889 [[Payphone]]'''

A payphone or pay phone is a public telephone, usually located in a stand-alone upright container such as a phone booth, with payment done by inserting money (usually coins), a credit or debit card, or a telephone card before the call is made. Pay telephone stations preceded the invention of the pay phone and existed as early as 1878. These stations were supervised by telephone company attendants or agents who collected the money due after people made their calls. In 1889, the first coin-operated telephone was installed by inventor William Gray at a bank in Hartford, Connecticut. However, it was a "postpay" machine that only accepted coins deposited after the call was placed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Payphones|publisher=Worldpayphones.com|url=http://www.worldpayphones.com/northamerica/country-usa.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Declining numbers spell likely end to pay phones|publisher=USA Today|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/techinnovations/2003-07-30-pay-phones-passing_x.htm | date=July 30, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Waltham Aircraft Clock Corporation''' is a company specializing in the manufacturing and maintenance of mechanical aircraft clocks, established in 1994 in [[Ozark, Alabama]].

==History==
The Waltham Aircraft Clock Corporation's history originates 1854 on the banks of the [[Charles River]], in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]], with the [[Waltham Watch Company]].

In 1957, at the demise of the watch manufacturing division, the clock division was separated, firstly under the name  '''Waltham Clock Company''', and at a later date, '''Waltham Precision Instruments Company'''.

The manufacturing of aircraft clocks continued in the original Waltham Building until February 1994, when '''Prime Time Clocks Co.''', purchased the remaining manufacturing line and incorporated it in the state of Alabama under its current name.

==Prime Time Clocks Co==
Prime Time Clocks had already been the [[Logistics center|depot]] level repair facility for all mechanical aircraft clocks for the U.S. [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] since 1982.

'''Whistled languages''' use [[whistling]] to emulate speech and facilitate communication. A whistled language is a system of whistled communication which allows fluent whistlers to transmit and comprehend a potentially unlimited number of messages over long distances. Whistled languages are different in this respect from the restricted codes sometimes used by herders or animal trainers to transmit simple messages or instructions.  Generally, whistled languages emulate the [[tonal languages|tones]] or vowel [[formant]]s of a natural spoken language, as well as aspects of its [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] and [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], so that trained listeners who speak that language can understand the encoded message.

Whistled language is rare compared to spoken language, but it is found in cultures around the world. It is especially common in [[tone languages]] where the whistled tones transmit the tones of the syllables (tone melodies of the words). This might be because in tone languages the tone melody carries more of the [[functional load]] of communication while non-tonal phonology carries proportionally less. The genesis of a whistled language has never been recorded in either case and has not yet received much productive study.

== Techniques ==

Whistled languages differ according to whether the spoken language is [[Tonal language|tonal]] or not, with the whistling being either tone or [[Manner of articulation|articulation]] based (or both).

Tonal languages are often stripped of articulation, leaving only [[suprasegmental feature]]s such as duration and tone, and when whistled retain the spoken melodic line. Thus whistled tonal languages convey [[phoneme|phonemic]] information solely through [[pitch (music)|tone]], length, and, to a lesser extent, [[vocal stress|stress]], and most [[segment (linguistics)|segmental]] phonemic distinctions of the spoken language are lost.

In non-tonal languages, more of the articulatory features of speech are retained, and the normally [[timbral]] variations imparted by the movements of the [[tongue]] and [[soft palate]] are transformed into [[pitch (music)|pitch]] variations.&lt;ref name=Busnel1976&gt;Busnel, R.-G. and Classe, A. (1976) ''Whistled Languages''. New York: Springer-Verlag. {{ISBN|0-387-07713-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain consonants can be pronounced while whistling, so as to modify the whistled sound, much as consonants in spoken language modify the vowel sounds adjacent to them.

"All whistled languages share one basic characteristic: they function by varying the [[frequency]] of a simple [[waveform|wave-form]] as a function of time, generally with minimal dynamic variations, which is readily understandable since in most cases their only purpose is long-distance communication."&lt;ref name=Busnel1976/&gt;

Different whistling styles may be used in a single language. [[Sochiapam Chinantec]] has three different words for whistle-speech: '''sie&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''' for whistling with the tongue against the alveolar ridge, '''juiÃµ&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;''' for bilabial whistling, and '''juo&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''' for finger-in-the-mouth whistling. These are used for communication over varying distances. There is also a kind of loud falsetto ('''h√≥h&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;''') which functions in some ways like whistled speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=A whistled conversation in Sochiapam Chinantec | publisher=Summer Institute of Linguistics in Mexico | url=http://www-01.sil.org/mexico/chinanteca/sochiapam/13i-Conversacion-cso.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a few different techniques of how to produce whistle speech, the choice of which is dependent on practical concerns. Bilabial and labiodental techniques are common for short and medium distance discussions (in a market, in the noise of a room, or for hunting); whereas the tongue retroflexed, one or two fingers introduced in the mouth, a blow concentrated at the junction between two fingers or the lower lip pulled while breathing in air are techniques used to reach high levels of power for long distance speaking.&lt;ref name="Asher, R. E. 1994"&gt;Asher, R. E., and J. M. Y. Simpson. "Whistled Speech and Whistled Language."The Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics. Oxford: Pergamon, 1994. 573-76. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Each place has its favorite trend that depends on the most common use of the village and on the personal preferences of each whistler. Whistling with a leaf or a flute is often related to courtship or poetic expression (reported in the Kickapoo language in Mexico&lt;ref&gt;Ritzenhaler R E &amp; Peterson F A (1954). 'Courtship whistling of the Mexican Kickapoo Indians.' American
Anthropologist 56(6), 1088‚Äì1089.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Hmong&lt;ref&gt;Busnel R-G, Alguri G, Gautheron B &amp; Rialland A (1989). 'Sur quelques aspects physiques de la langue √† ton siffl√©e du peuple H'mong.' Cahiers de l'Asie du Sud-Est 26, 39‚Äì52. Busnel R-G&lt;/ref&gt; and Akha&lt;ref&gt;Meyer J &amp; Dentel L (2003). 'The world whistles: scientific expedition and international network of cultural collaborations on the theme of whistled languages and talking musical instruments.' http://www.lemondesiffle.free.fr.&lt;/ref&gt; cultures in Asia).

Whistling techniques do not require the vibration of the vocal cords: they produce a shock effect of the compressed air stream inside the cavity of the mouth and/or of the hands. When the jaws are fixed by a finger, the size of the hole is stable. The air stream expelled makes vibrations at the edge of the mouth. The faster the air stream is expelled, the higher is the noise inside the cavities. If the hole (mouth) and the cavity (intra-oral volume) are well matched, the resonance is tuned, and the whistle is projected more loudly. The frequency of this bioacoustical phenomenon is modulated by the morphing of the resonating cavity that can be, to a certain extent,
related to the articulation of the equivalent spoken form.&lt;ref name="Asher, R. E. 1994"/&gt;

The expressivity of whistled speech is likely to be somewhat limited compared to spoken speech (although not inherently so), but such a conclusion should not be taken as absolute, as it depends heavily on various factors including the [[phonology]] of the language{{Weasel inline|date=July 2013}}. For example, in some tonal languages with few tones, whistled messages typically consist of stereotyped or otherwise standardized expressions, are elaborately descriptive, and often have to be repeated. However, in languages which are heavily tonal, and therefore convey much of their information through pitch even when spoken, such as [[Mazatecan languages|Mazatec]] and [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], extensive conversations may be whistled.  In any case, even for non-tonal languages, measurements indicate that high intelligibility can be achieved with whistled speech (90%) of intelligibility of non-standardized sentences for Greek&lt;ref name=Meyer2005/&gt; and the equivalent for Turkish.&lt;ref name=Busnel1970&gt;Busnel, R.-G. (1970) "Recherches exp√©rimentales sur la langue siffl√©e de Ku≈ük√∂y", ''Revue de phon√©tique appliqu√©e'' 14/15: 41&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;

This lack of understanding can be seen with a confusion matrix. It was tested using two speakers of Silbo (Jampolsky 1999). The study revealed that generally, the vowels were relatively easy to understand, and the consonants a bit more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Rialland, Annie. (2005). Phonological and phonetic aspects of whistled languages. Phonology, 22, pp 237-271 doi:10.1017/S0952675705000552&lt;/ref&gt;

In continental Africa, speech may be conveyed by a whistle or other musical instrument, most famously the "[[talking drum]]s". However, while drums may be used by [[griot]]s singing praise songs or for inter-village communication, and other instruments may be used on the [[radio]] for [[station identification]] [[jingle]]s, for regular conversation at a distance whistled speech is used. As two people approach each other, one may even switch from whistled to spoken speech in mid-sentence.

== Examples ==

[[Silbo Gomero language|Silbo]] on the island of [[La Gomera]] in the [[Canary Islands]], based on Spanish, is one of the best-studied whistled languages.  The number of distinctive sounds or phonemes in this language is a matter of disagreement, varying according to the researcher from two to five vowels and four to nine consonants.  This variation may reflect differences in speakers' abilities as well as in the methods used to elicit contrasts. The work of Meyer &lt;ref name=Meyer2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Meyer2008/&gt; clarifies this debate by providing the first statistical analyses of production for various whistlers as well as psycholinguistic tests of vowel identification.

Other whistled languages exist or existed in such parts of the world as Turkey ([[Ku≈ük√∂y]], "Village of the Birds"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Remote Village Where People 'Talk' in Intricate, Ear-Splitting Bird Whistles|author=Christie-Miller, Alexander|work=The Atlantic|date=July 16, 2012|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/07/the-remote-village-where-people-talk-in-intricate-ear-splitting-bird-whistles/259900/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Whistled Language of Northern Turkey|author=Nijhuis, Michelle|work=The New Yorker|date=August 17, 2015|url=http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-whistled-language-of-northern-turkey}}&lt;/ref&gt; France (the village of [[Aas, Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques|Aas]] in the [[Pyrenees]]), Mexico (the [[Mazatecan languages|Mazatecs]] and [[Chinantec]]s of [[Oaxaca]]), [[South America]] ([[M√∫ra-Pirah√£ language|Pirah√£]]), India (Kongthong village of [[Meghalaya]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amazingindiablog.in/kongthong-a-village-in-meghalaya-where-people-whistle-to-communicate/|title=Kongthong ‚Äì A Village in Meghalaya where People Whistle to Communicate|website=amazingindiablog.in|accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;(the [[Chepang language|Chepang]] of Nepal), and [[New Guinea]]. They are especially common and robust today in parts of [[West Africa]], used widely in such populous languages as [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] and [[Ewe language|Ewe]]. Even [[French language|French]] is whistled in some areas of western Africa.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

=== In Africa ===

As well as the Canary Islands, whistled speech occurs in some parts of [[Southern Africa]] and [[Eastern Africa]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Most whistle languages, of which there are several hundred, are based on tonal languages.

Only the tone of the speech is saved in the whistle, while aspects as articulation and phonation are eliminated. These are replaced by other features such as stress and rhythmical variations. However, some languages, like that of the [[Zezuru]] who speak a [[Shona language|Shona]]-derived dialect, include articulation so that consonants interrupt the flow of the whistle. A similar language is the [[Tsonga language|Tsonga]] whistle language used in the highlands in the Southern parts of [[Mozambique]]. This should not be confused with the [[whistled sibilant]]s of Shona.

== Usage and cultural status ==

In early China, the technique of [[transcendental whistling]] was a kind of nonverbal language with affinities to the spiritual aspects of [[Daoist meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor Mair|Mair]], Victor H. (1996), ''The Columbia Anthology of Traditional Chinese Literature'', Columbia University Press, p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Greek village of Antia, few whistlers remain now&lt;ref name=Meyer2005&gt;Meyer J. (2005) ''Typology and intelligibility of whistled languages: approach in linguistics and bioacoustics.'' Pd D dissertation. Cyberthese publication. Lyon 2 University.&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1982 the entire population knew ''sfyria'',&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20170731-greeces-disappearing-whistled-language|title=Greece's disappearing whistled language|last1=Stein|first1=Eliot|date=1 August 2017|work=BBC Travel|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801161637/http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20170731-greeces-disappearing-whistled-language|archivedate=1 August 2017|publisher=BBC.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the local whistled speech.

Whistled speech may be very central and highly valued in a culture. Shouting is very rare in  [[Sochiapam Chinantec]]. Men in that culture are subject to being fined if they do not handle whistle-speech well enough to perform certain town jobs. They may whistle for fun in situations where spoken speech could easily be heard.

In Sochiapam, Oaxaca, and other places in Mexico, and reportedly in West Africa as well, whistled speech is men's language: although women may understand it, they do not use it.

Though whistled languages are not secret [[code (cryptography)|codes]] or [[language game|secret languages]] (with the exception of a whistled language used by [[√±a√±igos]] [[Insurgency|insurgencies]] in [[Cuba]] during [[History of Cuba#Conquest of Cuba|Spanish occupation]]),&lt;ref name=Busnel1976/&gt; they may be used for secretive communication among outsiders or others who do not know or understand the whistled language though they may understand its spoken origin. Stories are told of farmers in Aas during [[World War II]], or in La Gomera, who were able to hide evidence of such nefarious activities as milk-watering because they were warned in whistle-speech that the police were approaching.&lt;ref name=Busnel1976/&gt;

== Ecology ==

Whistle languages have naturally developed in response to the necessity for humans to communicate in conditions of relative isolation, with possible causes being distance, noise levels, and night, as well as specific activities, such as social information, shepherding, hunting, fishing, courtship, or shamanism.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, J., and B. Gautheron. "Whistled Speech and Whistled Language." The Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics. 2nd Edition, Elsevier, Oxford, vol.13, 2006, p. 573-576. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this usage, they are mostly related to places with mountains or dense forests. Southern China, Papua New Guinea, the Amazon forest, subsaharan Africa, Mexico, and Europe encompass most of these locations.

They have been more recently found in dense forests like the Amazon where they may replace spoken dialogue in the villages while hunting or fishing to overcome the pressure of the acoustic environment.&lt;ref name=Meyer2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Meyer2008&gt;Meyer J. (2008) "Typology and acoustic strategies of whistled languages: Phonetic comparison and perceptual cues of whistled vowels", ''Journal of the International Phonetic Association'' 38, 1, 69&amp;ndash;94.&lt;/ref&gt; The main advantage of whistling speech is that it allows the speaker to cover much larger distances (typically {{convert|1|-|2|km}} but up to {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} in mountains and less in reverberating forests) than ordinary speech, without the strain (and lesser range) of shouting. More specifically, whistle speech can reach a loudness of 130&amp;nbsp;dB, and the transmission range can reach up to 10&amp;nbsp;km (as verified in La Gomera, Canary Island).&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Julien. 2004. Bioacoustics of human whistled languages: an alternative approach to the cognitive processes of language. Annals of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences 76(2): 405-412.&lt;/ref&gt; The long range of whistling is enhanced by the mountainous [[terrain]] found in areas where whistled languages are used. Many areas with such languages work hard to preserve their ancient traditions, in the face of rapidly advancing telecommunications systems in many areas.

== Physics ==
A whistled tone is essentially a simple oscillation (or [[sine wave]]), and thus timbral variations are impossible. Normal articulation during an ordinary lip-whistle is relatively easy though the lips move little causing a constant of [[labialization]] and making [[labial consonant|labial]] and [[labiodental consonant]]s (p, b, m, f, etc.) problematical.&lt;ref name=Busnel1976/&gt; "Apart from the five vowel-phonemes [of Silbo Gomero]‚Äîand even these do not invariably have a fixed or steady pitch‚Äîall whistled speech-sound realizations are [[semivowel|glides]] which are interpreted in terms of range, contour, and steepness." &lt;ref name=Busnel1976/&gt;

There are two different types of whistle tones - hole tones and [[edge tones]]. A hole (or 'orifice') tone is produced by a fast-moving cylinder (or 'vena contracta') of air that interacts with the slow-moving anulus of air surrounding it.&lt;ref name="linguistics.berkeley.edu"&gt;Shosted, Ryan K. Just Put Your Lips Together and Blow? The Whistled Fricatives of Southern Bantu. Www.linguistics.berkley.edu. N.p., n.d. Web. 1 Apr. 2014 &lt;http://www.linguistics.berkeley.edu/PhonLab/annual_report/documents/2006/whistleISSP.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Instability in the boundary layer leads to perturbations that increase in size until a feedback path is established whereby specific frequencies of the resonance chamber are emphasized.&lt;ref&gt;Shadle, C. H. Experiments on the acoustics of whistling. The Physics Teacher, 21:148‚Äì154, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; An edge tone, on the other hand, is generated by a thin jet of air that strikes an obstacle. Vortices are shed near the point of disturbance in the flow, alternating on each side of the obstacle or 'wedge'.&lt;ref name="linguistics.berkeley.edu"/&gt;

A way in which true whistled languages differ from other types of whistled communication is that they encode auditory features of
spoken languages by transposing key components of speech sounds. There are two types of whistled languages: those based on non-tone languages, which transpose F2 patterns (dealing with [[formants]]), and those based on tone languages, which transpose tone melodies.&lt;ref&gt;Annie Rialland (2005). Phonological and phonetic aspects of whistled languages.
Phonology, 22, pp 237-271 doi:10.1017/S0952675705000552&lt;/ref&gt; However, both types of whistle tones have a phonological structure that is related to the spoken language that they are transposing.

In a non-tonal language, segments may be differentiated as follows:
:Vowels are replaced by a set of relative pitch ranges generally tracking the f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[formant]] of spoken language.
:Stress is expressed by higher pitch or increased length
:Consonants are produced by pitch transitions of different lengths and height, plus the presence or absence of [[Occlusive|occlusion]]. ("Labial [[stop consonant|stops]] are replaced by [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]] or [[glottalization|glottal]] occlusions.")

== List of whistled languages ==

The following list is of languages that exist or existed in a whistled form, or of [[ethnic group]]s that speak such languages. In some cases (e.g. Chinantec) the whistled speech is an important and integral part of the language and culture; in others (e.g. Nahuatl) its role is much lesser.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}
