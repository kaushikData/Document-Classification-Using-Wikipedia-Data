On May 18, 2017, a car was crashed in [[Times Square]], [[New York City]]. One person was killed and 20 were injured. Navy veteran Richard Rojas was charged with two counts of [[Murder (United States law)#Degrees|second degree murder]], 18 [[attempted murder]]s and 38 [[assaults]], to which he pled not guilty.

After being detained, Rojas was found to have ingested [[phencyclidine]] before the crash. When interviewed by the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]], Rojas said he wanted to die in a "[[suicide by cop]]", and that he had been hearing voices. In a jailhouse news interview three days later, he said he did not remember the incident or any statements he made afterward.

A year later, multiple liability lawsuits were filed between Rojas, victims and the city.

== Incident ==

Richard Rojas, the driver of a maroon [[Honda Accord (North America eighth generation)|2009 Honda Accord]], sped into pedestrians in Times Square after having jumped the sidewalk on the west side of [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]] at [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]]. He continued for three blocks before crashing at the northwest corner of 45th Street and Seventh Avenue, at [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]].&lt;ref name="CNN1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sanchez|first1=Ray|title=Times Square car incident: 1 dead, 22 injured; driver in custody|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/18/us/new-york-times-square-car-pedestrians/|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=18 May 2017|date=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Eli|last2=Rashbaum|first2=William K.|title=One Dead and 22 Injured as Car Rams Into Pedestrians in Times Square|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/nyregion/times-square-crash.html|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=18 May 2017|date=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Rojas was trying to leave his car, a [[traffic agent]] tackled him and took him into custody.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; After having exited the car Rojas said: "I wanted to kill them," according to prosecutors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shapiro|first1=Emily|title=Times Square crash suspect told police 'I wanted to kill them': Prosecutors|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/suspect-deadly-times-square-crash-faces-murder-attempted/story?id=47509610|publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=20 May 2017|date=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suspect ==
Richard Rojas (born 1991), a 26-year-old resident of [[the Bronx]] and a military veteran, was arrested and charged after the crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Winter|first1=Tom|last2=Dienst|first2=Jonathan|last3=Ortiz|first3=Erik|title=Car Rams Into Pedestrians in NYC’s Times Square, Killing at Least 1|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/car-rams-pedestrians-nyc-s-times-square-n761556|publisher=[[NBC News]]|accessdate=18 May 2017|date=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He previously served in the [[United States Navy]] and had two prior arrests for [[driving under the influence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bacon|first1=John|last2=Diebel|first2=Matthew|title=Car slams into crowd in New York's Times Square; 1 dead, 22 hurt|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/05/18/car-rams-into-crowd-new-yorks-times-square/101830844/|publisher=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=18 May 2017|date=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These arrests came in 2008 and 2015.&lt;ref name="CNN1"/&gt; He enlisted in the Navy in 2011 and was an [[electrician's mate]] fireman apprentice. In 2012, he served aboard the [[destroyer]] [[USS Carney|USS ''Carney'']]. He was most recently based at [[Naval Air Station Jacksonville]] and was discharged in 2014.&lt;ref name="Time1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Long|first1=Colleen|last2=Hays|first2=Tom|title=Officials: Driver Who Crashed Into Pedestrians in Times Square Thought He Was Hearing Voices|url=http://time.com/4785396/times-square-crash-richard-rojas-hearing-voices/|website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=18 May 2017|date=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rojas was arrested in September 2012 after assaulting a cab driver and yelling at an officer, "My life is over", and threatening to kill police officers after his release. He also spent two months in military prison in 2013. A neighbor said his family was [[People of the Dominican Republic|Dominican]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Brittney|last=Donovan|title=Former Naval Station Mayport sailor arrested in fatal Time Square crash|url=http://www.actionnewsjax.com/news/local/former-naval-station-mayport-sailor-arrested-in-fatal-time-square-crash/524055782|publisher=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=18 May 2017|date=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spicer|first=Jonathan|title=Accused Times Square driver's troubled past included Navy prison|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-new-york-crash-driver-idUKKCN18E340?il=0|publisher=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=18 May 2017|date=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his friends said Rojas had developed a drinking problem after his military service, using it as medication for his "dark thoughts and moods",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gardener|first1=Aiden|first2=Trevor|last2=Kapp|title=Deadly Times Square Crash: Who Is Richard Rojas?|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/05/18/times-square-car-incident-who-is-richard-rojas/|publisher=DNAinfo.com|accessdate=18 May 2017|date=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and posted what the friend described as "demonic" content on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deadly Times Square Crash Driver Pulled Knife on Man 7 Days Earlier: NYPD|url=https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170518/times-square-theater-district/who-is-richard-rojas-driver-times-square-seventh-avenue|publisher=CBS New York|accessdate=18 May 2017|date=18 May 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170610095709/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170518/times-square-theater-district/who-is-richard-rojas-driver-times-square-seventh-avenue|archivedate=June 10, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to authorities and his friends, his mental health issues dated back to his childhood though he never sought psychiatric care, becoming more [[paranoid]] and increasing his intake of marijuana and alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Before Driver’s Times Square Crash, a Descent Into Paranoia and Harassment|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/nyregion/times-square-crash-driver-richard-rojas.html|publisher= New York Times|accessdate=18 May 2017|date=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rojas was obsessed with [[Scientology]] and had accumulated literature on the religion. He recently got back his car after it was repossessed a short time before the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/massive-times-square-car-crash-kills-injures-12-article-1.3176584|title= Times Square car crash kills 1, injures 22; Navy veteran cuffed|first1=Thomas|last1=Tracy|first2=Mary|last2= McDonnell|first3=Rocco|last3=Parascandola|first4=Rich|last4=Shapiro|publisher=New York Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week before the incident, he was arrested and charged with pointing a knife at a [[notary]], whom he accused of stealing his identity.&lt;ref name="Time1"/&gt;

Investigators looked into his psychological history.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt; In an interview for the ''[[New York Post]]'' on May 21, he said he had no recollection of the incident or any statements he made when arrested and sought help in the prior week, including speaking to a mental health counselor at a veteran's affairs center, who promised to call him on Monday (May 22).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2017/05/20/i-was-trying-to-get-help-times-square-driver-says-in-jailhouse-interview/|title=‘I was trying to get help,’ Times Square driver says in jailhouse interview|publisher=New York Post|first=Stephanie|last=Pagones|date=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
[[Bill de Blasio]], the [[Mayor of New York City]], and other officials have said there is no indication the incident was an act of terrorism.&lt;ref name="CNN1"/&gt; Several law enforcement officials said the suspect thought he was hearing voices and expected to die. Rojas tested negative for alcohol, but additional testing was done to determine whether he was taking any drugs.&lt;ref name="Time1"/&gt; The drug test came back as positive while [[blood tests]] were conducted for whether he had taken [[Synthetic cannabinoids|synthetic marijuana]] or [[Phencyclidine|PCP]].&lt;ref name=ABC7NY&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abc7ny.com/news/sources-times-square-driver-was-apparently-high-on-k2/2009161/|title=Sources: Times Square driver was apparently high on synthetic marijuana (K2) at time of pedestrian crash|publisher=ABC News|date=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rojas has since offered alternative explanations to the investigators who said they hadn't come to any conclusions.&lt;ref name="NYT1" /&gt;

According to a criminal complaint, Rojas admitted smoking marijuana laced with PCP before driving the car. Prosectors said he told the police he wanted to die by [[suicide by cop]]. He also rambled that he had been hearing voices and it was the last day on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/05/18/times-square-car-incident-who-is-richard-rojas/|title=‘I Wanted To Kill Them’: Authorities Detail Case Against Times Square Crash Suspect Richard Rojas|publisher=CBS News|date=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to other sources, he said he claimed to hear voices telling him the police were going to kill him.&lt;ref name=DailyManhattan&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/massive-times-square-car-crash-kills-injures-12-article-1.3176584|title=Times Square car crash kills 1, injures 22; Navy veteran cuffed|publisher=New York Daily News|first1=Christopher|last1=Brennan|first2=Molly|last2=Crane-Newman|first3=Rocco|last3=Parascandola|first4=Thomas|last4=Tracy|first5=Rich|last5=Shapiro|date=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, they said he had tested positive for PCP and told police God made him do it.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; His interview was said to be abnormal and rambling.&lt;ref name=DailyManhattan/&gt;

==Legal proceedings==

Rojas was later charged with second-degree [[murder]], 20 counts of attempted murder, and five counts of aggravated vehicular homicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39971309|title=Times Square driver 'heard voices'|date=May 19, 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On July 13, Rojas, through his lawyer, Enrico DeMarco, pleaded not guilty to two counts of second-degree murder, 18 attempted murders and 38 assaults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2017/07/13/driver-pleads-not-guilty-in-deadly-times-square-rampage//|title=Driver pleads not guilty in deadly Times Square rampage|publisher=''New York Post''|first=Rebecca|last=Rosenberg|date=July 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 24, DeMarco declined to reveal whether he would attempt an [[insanity defense]], saying he needed "another month or so" to examine Rojas' possessions, such as notebooks, which the district attorney possesses. Justice Melissa Jackson urged him to hurry before adjourning till December 18.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/driver-struck-21-people-times-square-psych-defense-article-1.3585999 "Driver who mowed down 21 people on Times Square sidewalk may use psychiatric defense", by Shayna Jacobs, ''New York Daily News'']&lt;/ref&gt; On December 17, he filed notice of his intent to pursue an insanity defense. Rojas will be examined by psychiatrists hired by both sides.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nypost.com/2017/12/18/accused-killer-in-times-square-crash-plans-insanity-defense/ "Accused killer in Times Square crash plans insanity defense", by Emily Saul, ''New York Post'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil action===
In July 2018, Eisman's father and sister sued New York City for unspecified damages, alleging it failed to provide adequate protection from civilian attacks. Rojas was also named as a defendant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nypost.com/2018/07/31/family-of-teen-killed-by-crazed-times-square-driver-are-suing-city/ "Family of teen killed by crazed Times Square driver are suing city", by Emily Saul, ''New York Post'']&lt;/ref&gt; The next month, victims Jessica Williams and William Nelson Sr. filed a similar joint suit for $75 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nypost.com/2018/08/14/2-more-victims-of-times-square-drivers-rampage-file-lawsuits/ "2 more victims of Times Square driver’s rampage file lawsuits", by Jessica Marsh, ''New York Post'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Rojas countersued the plaintiffs, blaming their injuries on their own culpable conduct, and holding their respective insurance companies solely responsible for paying their expenses. He agreed with their claim that the city was recklessly negligent, and sued it accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oxygen.com/crime-time/richard-rojas-accused-times-square-car-killer-blames-crash-on-victims-alyssa-elsman "Accused Times Square Car Killer Blames Crash On Victims", by John Silman, Oxygen.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Afar''' ({{lang-aa|Qafár}}), also known as the '''Danakil''', '''Adali''' and '''Odali''', are an ethnic group inhabiting the [[Horn of Africa]]. They primarily live in the [[Afar Region]] of [[Ethiopia]] and in northern [[Djibouti]], although some also inhabit the southern point of [[Eritrea]]. Afars speak the [[Afar language]], which is part of the [[Cushitic language|Cushitic]] branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] family.

==History==
{{History_of Djibouti}}

===Early history===
{{Main article|Adal Sultanate}}
Afar society has traditionally been organized into independent kingdoms, each ruled by its own [[Sultan]]. Among these were the [[Aussa Sultanate|Sultanate of Aussa]], Sultanate of Girrifo, [[Sultanate of Dewe|Sultanate of Dawe]], [[Tadjourah#Sultans|Sultanate of Tadjourah]], Sultanate of Rahaito, and Sultanate of Goobad.&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;Matt Phillips, Jean-Bernard Carillet, ''Lonely Planet Ethiopia and Eritrea'', (Lonely Planet: 2006), p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Adal.PNG|thumb|left|180px|Territory of the [[Adal Sultanate]] and its vassal states (ca. 1500).]]
The earliest surviving written mention of the Afar is from the 13th-century [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] writer [[Ibn Said al-Maghribi|Ibn Sa'id]], who reported that they inhabited the area around the port of [[Suakin]], as far south as [[Bab-el-Mandeb|Mandeb]], near [[Zeila]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Pankhurst (academic)|Richard Pankhurst]], ''The Ethiopian Borderlands'' (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 1997), p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; They are mentioned intermittently in Ethiopian records, first as helping [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Amda Seyon I of Ethiopia|Amda Seyon]] in a campaign beyond the [[Awash River]], then over a century later when they assisted Emperor [[Baeda Maryam of Ethiopia|Baeda Maryam]] when he campaigned against their neighbors the [[Dobe'a]].&lt;ref&gt;Pankhurst, ''Borderlands'', pp. 61-67, 106f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the closely related [[Somali people|Somali]] and other adjacent [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]]-speaking [[Muslim]] peoples, the Afar are also associated with the medieval [[Adal Sultanate]] that controlled large parts of the northern Horn of Africa. During its existence, Adal had relations and engaged in trade with other polities in Northeast Africa, the [[Near East]], [[Europe]] and [[South Asia]]. Many of the historic cities in the Horn region, such as [[Maduna]], [[Abasa, Somalia|Abasa]], [[Berbera]], [[Zeila]] and [[Harar]], flourished with [[courtyard|courtyard houses]], [[mosque]]s, [[shrine]]s, [[defensive wall|walled enclosure]]s and [[cistern]]s during the kingdom's [[Golden Age]].

===Aussa Sultanate===
[[File:Red Red.svg|thumb|right|180px|State flag of the [[Aussa Sultanate]].]]
{{Main article|Aussa Sultanate|Mudaito Dynasty}}
The [[Aussa Sultanate|Afar Sultanate]] (Aussa Sultanate) succeeded the earlier [[Imamate of Aussa]]. The latter polity had come into existence in 1577, when [[Muhammed Jasa]] moved his capital from [[Harar]] to [[Asaita|Aussa]] with the split of the Adal Sultanate into Aussa and the Harari city-state. At some point after 1672, Aussa declined and temporarily came to an end in conjunction with Imam [[Umar Din bin Adam]]'s recorded ascension to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Abir, p. 23 n.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sultanate was subsequently re-established by [[Kedafu]] around the year 1734, and was thereafter ruled by his [[Mudaito Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Abir, pp. 23-26.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary symbol of the Sultan was a silver [[Baton (symbol)|baton]], which was considered to have magical properties.&lt;ref&gt;Trimingham, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Afar Liberation Front===
{{Main article|Afar Liberation Front|Afar Revolutionary Democratic Unity Front}}
[[File:Flag of ARDUF.png|thumb|right|180px|Official flag of the [[Afar Revolutionary Democratic Unity Front]].]] 
Following an unsuccessful rebellion led by the Afar Sultan, [[Alimirah Hanfare]], the [[Afar Liberation Front]] was founded in 1975 to promote the interests of the Afar people. Sultan Hanfadhe was shortly afterwards exiled to [[Saudi Arabia]]. Ethiopia's then-ruling communist [[Derg]] regime later established the [[Autonomous Region of Assab]] (now called [[Aseb]] and located in [[Eritrea]]), although low level insurrection continued until the early 1990s. In Djibouti, a similar movement simmered throughout the 1980s, eventually culminating in the [[Afar Insurgency]] in 1991. After the fall of the Derg that same year, Sultan Hanfadhe returned from exile.

In March 1993, the [[Afar Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (ARDUF) was established. It constituted a coalition of three Afar organizations: the [[Afar Revolutionary Democratic Unity Union]] (ARDUU), founded in 1991 and led by [[Mohamooda Gaas]] (or Gaaz); the ''Afar Ummatah Demokrasiyyoh Focca'' (AUDF); and the [[Afar Revolutionary Forces]] (ARF). A political party, it aims to protect Afar interests. As of 2012, the ARDUF is part of the [[United Ethiopian Democratic Forces]] (UEDF) coalition opposition party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/ak/sellassie/politics/parties.html Ethiopia - Political Parties], Accessed: 1-07-2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==

===Geographical distribution===
[[File:Traditional area inhabited by the Afar ethnic group.png|thumb|Approximate area inhabited by the Afar ethnic group.]]
The Afar principally reside in the [[Danakil Desert]] in the [[Afar (region)|Afar Region]] of [[Ethiopia]], as well as in [[Eritrea]] and [[Djibouti]]. They number 1,276,867 people in Ethiopia (or 1.73% of the total population), of whom 105,551 are urban inhabitants, according to the most recent census (2007).&lt;ref name="Ethcen"&gt;[http://www.csa.gov.et/index.php?option=com_rubberdoc&amp;view=category&amp;id=72&amp;Itemid=521 "Country level"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816080650/http://www.csa.gov.et/index.php?option=com_rubberdoc&amp;view=category&amp;id=72&amp;Itemid=521 |date=16 August 2010 }}, Table 3.1, p.73.&lt;/ref&gt; The Afar make up over a third of the population of Djibouti, and are one of the nine recognized [[Regions of Ethiopia|ethnic divisions]] (''kililoch'') of Ethiopia.&lt;ref name="Lyhdu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/et.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
[[File:ISO 639 Icon aa.svg|thumb|ISO 639 icon for the Afar language]]
Afars speak the [[Afar language]] as a [[mother tongue]]. It is part of the [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language family.

The Afar language is spoken by ethnic Afars in the Afar Region of Ethiopia, as well as in southern Eritrea and northern Djibouti. However, since the Afar are traditionally [[nomad]]ic [[herder]]s, Afar speakers may be found further afield.

Together, with the [[Saho language]], Afar constitutes the [[Saho–Afar languages|Saho–Afar]] dialect cluster.

===Religion===
Afar people are predominantly [[Muslim]]. They have a long association with [[Islam]] through the various local Muslim polities.&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt;

==Culture==
[[File:An Afar nomad.jpg|thumb|upright|Afar man in traditional nomadic attire.]]
The Afar are traditionally pastoralists, raising [[goat]]s, [[sheep]], and [[cattle]] in the desert.&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt;

Socially, they are organized into [[clan]] families and two main classes: the ''asaimara'' ('reds') who are the dominant class politically, and the ''adoimara'' ('whites') who are a working class and are found in the [[Mabla Mountains]].&lt;ref name="Uhlig2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Uhlig|first=Siegbert|title=Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: A-C|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nobesFx6E7oC&amp;pg=PA103|accessdate=30 May 2011|year=2003|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-04746-3|pages=103–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Afar are reputed for their martial prowess. Men traditionally sport the ''[[Qolxad or Jile (dagger)|jile]]'', a famous curved knife. They also have an extensive repertoire of battle songs.&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt;

A '''referendum on restoring the monarchy''' was held in [[Albania]] on 29 June 1997 alongside [[Albanian parliamentary election, 1997|parliamentary elections]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen]] &amp; Philip Stöver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p133 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officially the proposal was rejected by 66.7% of voters,&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p.137&lt;/ref&gt; although Crown Prince [[Leka, Crown Prince of Albania (born 1939)|Leka]] claimed that 65.7% voted in favour.&lt;ref name="Royal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albanianroyalcourt.al/pages/kingleka|title=Prince Leka|publisher=Albanian Royal House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
The [[House of Zogu]] never accepted the official result of the referendum. After the publication of the result by the [[Central Election Commission of Albania]], during the [[1997 rebellion in Albania]], Leka returned again, this time being greeted by 2,000 supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Albania: two thousand attend Tirana protest rally in support of monarchy |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&amp;p_multi=BBAB&amp;d_place=BBAB&amp;p_theme=newslibrary2&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F99F5CCC575771E&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |publisher=ATA |date=1997-07-02 |accessdate=2008-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A referendum was held in Albania concerning a [[monarchy|monarchical]] restoration. After a recount it was announced that the restoration was rejected by approximately two-thirds of those voting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2072440.stm Ex-king's son returns to Albania], ''[[BBC News Online]]'', 28 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The Crown Prince questioned the independence of the election. Police intervened, gunfire broke out, one person was killed, and Leka fled.

On 30 November 2011, after the death of Leka the [[Prime Minister of Albania]], [[Sali Berisha]] admitted that there was vote manipulation in the referendum, and that the monarchy should have been restored. Berisha blamed the manipulation on the "flames of communist rebellion".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keshilliministrave.al/?fq=brenda&amp;m=news&amp;lid=15635&amp;gj=gj2 Kryeministri PM Berisha offers condolences at Leka Zogu I passing away], Keshilli i Ministrave 2011-11-30{{dead link|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=June 2008}}

'''Applied aesthetics''' is the application of the branch of philosophy of aesthetics to cultural constructs.
{{TOC right}}

==Architecture and interior design==

Although structural integrity, cost, the nature of building materials, and the functional utility of the building contribute heavily to the design process, architects can still apply aesthetic considerations to buildings and related [[architecture|architectural]] structures. Common aesthetic design principles include ornamentation, edge delineation, texture, flow, solemnity, symmetry, color, granularity, the interaction of sunlight and shadows, transcendence, and harmony.

[[Interior design]]ers, being less constrained by structural concerns, have a wider variety of applications to appeal to aesthetics. They may employ color, color harmony, wallpaper, ornamentation, furnishings, fabrics, textures, lighting, various floor treatments, as well as adhere to aesthetic concepts such as [[feng shui]].

==Digital art==

A new art form struggling for acceptance is [[digital art]], a by-product of computer programming that raises new questions about what truly constitutes art.  Although paralleling many of the aesthetics in traditional media, digital art can additionally draw upon the aesthetic qualities of cross-media tactile relationships; interactivity; autonomous generativity; complexity and interdependence of relationships; suspense; and playfulness.

Artists working in this type of art are often forced to justify their use of a computer rather than a traditional medium, leading to, like the debate over Warhol's "Brillo Pad Boxes", a question of what constitutes art.

The criticisms of digital art are many. For example, graphics programs allow perfect shading to be achieved with little to no effort. In other types of programs, there is a sense that because of the variety of tools, filters, distortions, etc., that an artist has a veritable image factory at their disposal. The various criticisms ultimately come down to the issue of "what effort is the artist putting into their work?"

The 3d art community frequently references that while the programs they utilize render and shade the objects, their efforts are more akin to the sculptor or architect, presenting an aesthetically arranged, lighted, and textured scene. The users of the other programs such as Photoshop or Gimp point out that while they may have many tools at their disposal, the art itself must be that much more detailed and imaginative to stand out. In both cases there is the challenge of overcoming the barriers of limited technology and the lack of direct contact with one's medium.

==Education and social sciences==

Educators are also interested in how aesthetic designs influence the ways that students think and learn. Some historical figures like [[John Dewey]] have approached education through aesthetics. More recently, Elliot Eisner and jan jagodzinski have reopened the debate. Other researchers with [[postmodern]] or [[poststructural]] influences have done the same, these include Cleo H. Cherryholmes and [[Michel Foucault]]. Aesthetics in education has been linked to [[pragmatism]] as well as other areas of curriculum development and implementation.

See ''Understanding Curriculum," Chapter 11, Understanding Curriculum as Aesthetic Text, by William F. Pinar, William M. Reynolds, Patrick Slattery and Peter Taubman (1995) for more information.

==Fashion design==

[[Fashion design]]ers use a variety of techniques to allow people to express the truth about their unconscious minds by way of their clothing. To create wearable personality designers use fabric, cut, colour, scale, references to the past, texture, color harmony, distressing, transparency, insignia, accessories, beading and embroidery.
It is also used to find the average size of things, to make a product suitable for a high number of customers.

==Film, television, and video==

[[Film]] combines many diverse disciplines, each of which may have their own rules of aesthetics. The aesthetics of [[cinematography]] are closely related to still [[photography]], but the movement of the subject(s), or the camera and the intensities, colors, and placement of the [[lighting]] are highly important. [[Sound recording]], editing, and mixing are other, highly important areas of film, often closely related with the [[Film score|musical score]]. As in [[Theatre]], [[art direction]], in the design of the sets and shooting locations also applies, as well as [[costume design]] and [[makeup]]. All of these disciplines are closely inter-twined and must be brought together by the aesthetic sensibilities of the [[Film director|director]].

[[Montage sequence|Montage]], or editing is probably the one discipline unique to film, video, and television. The timing, rhythm and progression of shots form the ultimate composition of the film. This procedure is one of the most critical element of [[post production]], and incorporates sound editing and mixing, as well as the design and execution of digital [[special effects]].

In the case of a [[video installation]], the method of presentation becomes critical. The work may be screened on a simple [[video monitor|monitor]], projected on a wall or other surface, or incorporated into a larger sculptural installation. A video installation may also involve sound, with similar considerations to be made based on speaker design and placement, volume, and tone.

==Gastronomy==

{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2007}}
{{Original research|section|date=December 2007}}
Although [[culinary|food]] is a basic and frequently experienced commodity, careful attention to the aesthetic possibilities of foodstuffs can turn eating into [[gastronomy]]. Chefs inspire our aesthetic enjoyment through the visual sense using colour and arrangement; they inspire our senses of taste and smell using [[spices]], diversity/contrast, anticipation, seduction, and decoration/garnishes. In regard to [[drinking water]], there are formal criteria for aesthetic value including [[odour]], [[colour]], [[total dissolved solids]] and clarity. There are numerical standards in the [[United States|U.S.]] for aesthetic acceptability of these parameters.

Note, however, a use of a word translated to "culinary" in Adorno's aesthetics. Adorno distinguishes between technically accurate and "beautiful" musical interpretation, and an interpretation higher which brings out the "truth" in the musical text: interpretations more rehearsed, with more time for rehearsal, but which might sound strange to audiences pandered-to by popular conductors (perhaps in the way Glenn Gould enstranges the music of Beethoven).

Unfortunately for the ordinary reader of Adorno, this isn't something technical such as "original instruments". It is instead the work of art that doesn't pander to what the audience "wants"...its whims.

This is linked to a Marxist interpretation which instead of treating the audience as an all-powerful "customer" adopts a teacherly or even priestly stance "above" the mere audience, something only the most "snobbish" of French chefs would dare, proposing to teach it to like Higher Things.

There are rarefied forms of *haute* cuisine; but note that common sense usually has a horselaugh about precious Yuppies eating designer food which it withholds about concert-goers listening to Berg; your man in the street merely thinks the latter crowd to be odd jobs, and doesn't resent them, meaning that ethical judgements play a role in aesthetic judgements that specialists in ethics, and specialists in aesthetics, systematically disregard...but which artists such as Tolstoy regarded as central.

Based on Adorno's theory of the (merely) culinary as not being "art", this would seem to mean that it is a joke, for an Adornoite (if such a person exists meaningfully), to treat cooking as an art form or eating as art appreciation.

Monty Python would often reverberate with this sort of arcana in a strange way: in the Mr. Creosote passage of The Meaning of Life, an enormously fat man is persuaded by the fawning waiter to have one more sweet whereupon Mr. Creosote throws up all over the dining room. Note that the scene has more claims to be art, despite being nauseating, than designer food.

This MAY be an unconscious comment on any theory of art that blindly equates "fine dining" and a visit to the picture galleries, a sort of tourist equation in which picture galleries are overrun in fact by post-prandial Mr. Creosotes. Even the ordinary man in the street would say that the starving artist visiting the gallery has a "better" apprehension of the higher, more inner, more elusive aura of the art work than Mr. Creosote, which means that for some authors, including Adorno, there is a nexus between ethics (which nearly tracks aesthetics polyphonically, where we use "good" and "bad" in ethics to characterise people and their deeds, and in aesthetics to judge what to buy).

The possibility of a rejection of the culinary in art starts with Kant's theory of the sublime but does not end there; post Holocaust (with its Nazis playing Bach: with Adorno's questions about poetry after Auschwitz) the culinary, and whether the German officer enjoying a "fine" meal has much of anything to do with art, become important aesthetic questions.

A Marxist theory of art would probably conclude that the chef cannot be an artist, lacking autonomy and beholden to the customer, Mr. Creosote, in all regards.

==Humor==

{{Further|Humor|Jokes|Mathematical humor}}
There is a developed theory of the aesthetics of jokes and humor, including a mathematical and logical analysis.

==Industrial design==

[[Industrial Design]]: Designers need many aesthetic qualities to improve the marketability of manufactured products: smoothness, shininess/reflectivity, texture, pattern, curviness, color, simplicity, usability, velocity, symmetry, naturalness, and modernism.
The staff of the Design Aesthetics section focuses on design, appearance and the way people perceive products. Design aesthetics is interested in the appearance of products; the explanation and meaning of this appearance is studied mainly in terms of social and cultural factors. The distinctive focus of the section is research and education in the field of sensory modalities in relation to product design. These fields of attention generate design baggage that enables engineers to design products, systems, and services, and match them to the correct field of use.

==Information technology==

Aesthetics in [[information technology]] has focused upon the study of [[human-computer interaction]] and creating [[user-friendly]] devices and [[software applications]]. [[Software]] itself has aesthetic dimensions ("[[software aesthetics]]"), as do information-technology-mediated processes and experiences such as computer [[video games]] and [[virtual reality]] simulations. [[Digital culture]] is a distinct aesthetic to judge the appeal of digital environments such as [[Web browser]]s, [[website]]s, and icons, as well as visual and aural art produced exclusively with digital technologies. The notion of [[cyberspace]] has sometimes been linked to the concept of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]].

Aesthetics in information technology do also apply to the act of designing [[software]] itself. Numerous [[programmers]] profess to experiencing a dimension of [[elegance]] in the functionality and structuring of software at the [[source code]] level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/front/node3.html Preface to the First Edition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a short, powerful expression that clearly expresses the intent of the code can be considered "beautiful" to the poor programmer charged with maintaining said code. This contrasts with code that is (as code all too often is) short, cryptic, unclear, and unnecessarily "clever". In-line documentation, while not strictly code, can be considered something a programmer would need to be good at in order to write beautiful code. Correctly done, documentation can accentuate the effect of beautiful code, when it is clear, concise, explains the intent of the programmer, and expands the understanding that one can gain by simply looking at the code. Comments that are redundant (only explain what the code already explains), cryptic, and overly long or short can detract from beautiful code. Aesthetics in programming can also have a practical level: Under the right conditions, elegant code can run faster and more efficiently, and (most importantly) be less prone to errors.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Knuth,  "Literate Programming", http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of this would say that the need to justify "good design" by reference to "cost savings" means that "good design" isn't "art" insofar as art is autonomous, and many aestheticians would have to say that art emerges in applications only in excess of cost savings. In information technology, theorists of "user friendliness" have to justify their "user friendly" applications and often disregard basic statistics when most users like a system, but a significant minority hate it.

That is, they may discard the standard deviation of their data in order to sell a good design for the best price, and this has nothing to do with art insofar as art is a useful signifier (if you cost-justify everything you are a businessman and not an artist).

A folk phenomenon among real programmers is in fact their frequent hatred of practice described in books as best practice and good design. A Marxist theory of industrial "art" would ascribe this to alienation, in which subaltern programmers never produce code they own in any meaningful sense, with the problem that the same sort of alienation, soldiering, and bloody-mindedness appeared, it seems, in Soviet computing shops.

The most sophisticated writings on the topic of aesthetics are to be found in the late [[Edsger Dijkstra|Edsger Wybe Dijkstra's]] corpus of papers and notes on computing: in Dijkstra, the art is real, but Ying with respect to the Yang of applications; Dijkstra seemed to have refused any analysis of programming as other than applied mathematics and, strange to say, never pursued what Adorno (the midcentury theoretician of whom Dijkstra was apparently unaware) called a purely culinary elegance...despite the protests of others that his work was "hard to digest", in Adorno's words not very culinary.

Dijkstra's beauty refused the notion of accessibility as do many "artistic" works ancient and modern: it was hard as is the Grosse Fuge, Beethoven's syncopated and neo-primitive late movement. In fact, no aesthetician makes "user friendliness" canonical and necessary in a work of art, strange to say in an era when supposedly the masses rule through the market; for most art theorists, it is nice if the canaille can enjoy some pretty rondo of Mozart and whistle it on the street, but would deny that this property must be shared by the Masonic prelude and fugue or the Requiem mass.

This makes strange any claim that a programmer making his work "user friendly" to all comers is some sort of artist by virtue of that. For Dijsktra, truth was primary, and beauty the automatic result.

==Landscape design==

[[Landscape architecture|Landscape designers]] draw upon design elements such as axis, line, landform, horizontal and vertical planes, texture, and scale to create aesthetic variation within the landscape. They may additionally make use of aesthetic elements such as pools or fountains of water, plants, seasonal variance, stonework, fragrance, exterior lighting, statues, and lawns.

==Literature==

{{main|Literary merit}}
In [[poetry]], [[short story|short stories]], [[novel]]s and [[non-fiction]], authors use a variety of techniques to appeal to our aesthetic values. Depending on the type of writing an author may employ rhythm, illustrations, structure, time shifting, juxtaposition, dualism, imagery, fantasy, suspense, analysis, humor/cynicism, and thinking aloud.

==Maps==

Aesthetics in [[cartography]] relates to the visual experience of map reading and can take two forms: responses to the map itself as an aesthetic object (e.g., through detail, colour, and form) and also the subject of the map symbolised, often the landscape (e.g., a particular expression of terrain which forms an imagined visual experience of the aesthetic).

Cartographers make aesthetic judgments when designing maps to ensure that the content forms a clear expression of the theme(s). Antique maps are perhaps especially revered due to their aesthetic value, which may seem to be derived from their styles of ornamentation. As such, aesthetics are often wrongly considered to be a by-product of design. If it is taken that aesthetic judgments are produced within a certain social context, they are fundamental to the cartographer's symbolisation and as such are integral to the function of maps.

==Marketing==

As opposed to Industrial Design, which focuses on the aesthetic qualities of consumer products (see below), the use of aesthetics in marketing concerns itself with the "trade dress" of a product, such as its branding, its commercial representation, or the reputation of its producer. Marketing professionals may tickle the consumer's aesthetic appreciation of sassyness, [[sophistication]], color-harmony, stylishness, catchy jingles, slogans, craftsmanship, soothingness, attentiveness, authenticity, or the related perceived experiences associated with product consumption.

Marketing consists of intriguing the human mind to think in a direction where it would not have done so previously - or not without outside input. Human curiosity, self gain or mental adjustment is what drives marketing development itself.

==Mathematics==

{{Main|Mathematical beauty}}
{{Further|mathematical humor}}
The aesthetics of [[mathematics]] are often compared with music and poetry. Hungarian mathematician [[Paul Erdős]] expressed his views on the indescribable beauty of mathematics when he said "Why are numbers beautiful? It's like asking why is [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]] beautiful." Math appeals to the "senses" of logic, order, novelty, elegance, and discovery. Some concepts in math with specific aesthetic application include sacred ratios in [[geometry]], the intuitiveness of axioms, the complexity and intrigue of fractals, the solidness and regularity of [[polyhedra]], and the [[serendipity]] of relating theorems across disciplines.  There is a developed aesthetic and theory of humor in [[mathematical humor]].

Some of the aesthetic elements expressed in [[music]] include lyricism, [[harmony]], hypnotism, emotiveness, temporal dynamics, volume dynamics, resonance, playfulness, color, subtlety, elatedness, depth, and mood (see [[musical development]]). Aesthetics in music are often believed to be highly sensitive to their context: what sounds good in modern [[rock music]] might sound terrible in the context of the early [[baroque music|baroque]] age.

==Neuroesthetics==

[[Cognitive science]] has also considered aesthetics, with the advent of [[neuroesthetics]], pioneered by [[Semir Zeki]], which seeks to explain the prominence of great art as an embodiment of biological principles of the brain, namely that great works of art capture the essence of things just as vision and the brain capture the essentials of the world from the ever-changing stream of sensory input. ''See also'' [[Vogelkop bowerbird]].

==Performing arts==

[[Theater|Performing arts]] appeal to our aesthetics of storytelling, grace, balance, class, timing, strength, shock, humor, costume, irony, beauty, drama, suspense, and sensuality. Whereas live stage performance is usually constrained by the physical reality at hand, film performance can further add the aesthetic elements of large-scale action, fantasy, and a complex interwoven musical [[film score|score]]. [[Performance art]] often consciously mixes the aesthetics of several forms. [[Role-playing games]] are sometimes seen as a performing art with an aesthetic structure of their own, called [[role-playing game theory|RPG theory]].

==Two-dimensional and plastic arts==

Aesthetic considerations within the [[visual arts]] are usually associated with the sense of [[visual perception|vision]]. A painting or sculpture, however, is also perceived spatially by recognized associations and context, and even to some extent by the senses of smell, hearing, and touch. The form of the work can be subject to an aesthetic as much as the content.

In painting, the aesthetic convention that we see a three-dimensional representation rather than a two-dimensional canvas is so well understood that most people do not realize that they are making an aesthetic interpretation. This notion is the basis of [[abstract impressionism]].

In the United States during the postwar period, the "push-pull" theories of [[Hans Hofmann]], positing a relation between color and perceived depth, strongly influenced a generation of prominent abstract painters, many of whom studied under Hofmann and were generally associated with [[abstract expressionism]]. Hofmann's general attitude toward abstraction as virtually a moral imperative for the serious painter was also extremely influential.

Some aesthetic effects available in visual arts include variation, juxtaposition, repetition, field effects, symmetry/asymmetry, perceived mass, subliminal structure, linear dynamics, tension and repose, pattern, contrast, perspective, 3 dimensionality, movement, rhythm, unity/Gestalt, matrixiality and proportion.

==Urban life==

[[Image:Clifton suspension bridge from hotwells 600.jpg|thumb|300px|Towns and cities have been planned with aesthetics in mind; here in [[Bristol]] (England), 19th century private sector development was designed to appear attractive.]]
Over half of mankind lives in cities; although it represents a lofty goal, [[urban planning|planning]] and achieving urban aesthetics ([[beautification]]) involves a good deal of historical luck, happenstance, and indirect gestalt. Nevertheless, aesthetically pleasing cities share certain traits: ethnic and cultural variety, numerous microclimates that promote a diversity of vegetation, sufficient public transportation, Public art and freedom of expression in the community in the forms of sculpture, [[graffiti]] and [[street art]], a range of build-out (or zoning) that creates both densely and sparsely populated areas, scenic neighboring geography (oceans or mountains), public spaces and events such as [[park]]s and [[parade]]s, musical variety through local radio or street musicians, and enforcement of laws that abate noise, crime, and pollution.

==Website Design==

Recent research suggests that the visual aesthetics of computer interface is a strong determinant of users’ satisfaction and pleasure. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses found that users’ perceptions consist of different main dimensions. Lavie and Tractinsky found two main dimension which they termed  “classical aesthetics”  and “expressive aesthetics”.&lt;ref&gt;Lavie, T., &amp; Tractinsky, N. (2004). Assessing Dimensions of Perceived Visual Aesthetics of Websites. International Journal of Human Computer Studies , 269-298.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*''Classical Aesthetics'' - pertains to aesthetic notions that presided from antiquity until the 18th century. These notions emphasize orderly and clear design and are closely related to many of the 	design rules advocated by usability experts.
*''Expressive Aesthetics'' - created by the designers’ creativity and originality and by the ability to break design conventions.
While both dimensions of perceived aesthetic are drawn from a pool of aesthetic judgments, they are clearly distinguishable from each other. &lt;br /&gt;
In a recent study Moshagen and Thielsch found four core dimensions of website aesthetics:&lt;ref&gt;Moshagen, M. &amp; Thielsch, M. T. (2010). Facets of visual aesthetics. In: ''International Journal of Human-Computer Studies'', 68 (10), 689-709.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Simplicity
* Diversity
* Colors
* Craftsmanship

Simplicity and diversity have repeatedly been treated as formal parameters of aesthetic objects throughout the history of empirical aesthetics. Colors are a very critical property of aesthetic objects. Craftsmanship addresses the skillful and coherent integration of the relevant design dimensions. While simplicity is highly correlated to classical aesthetics as mentioned by Lavie and Tractinsky, the other three factors could be treated as deeper differentiation of expressive aesthetics.

&lt;br /&gt;
'''Best practices for aesthetic Website Design'''&lt;br /&gt;
•	Create visual clues based on groupings; related items or links are grouped together while unrelated items are separated.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Use headings and subheadings to allow visual scanning of content.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Use headings, subheadings, font sizes, bold fonts and italic fonts in proportion to the importance of the item.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Align elements on a page so that they are all visually connected; size all elements on the page to create balance and unity; nothing should look out of place unless you have a specific reason for the effect.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Choose a font style that supports the site atmosphere and stick to it; limit styles to 2 at the most.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Use images and photos for visual appeal and to communicate ideas.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Use one set of design elements across your website.

'''Website Design Aesthetics and Credibility''' &lt;br /&gt;
Website design influences user’s perception of site credibility. One of the factors that influences whether users stay or go on a web page is the page aesthetics. Another reason may involve a user's judgment about the site's credibility. Findings indicate that when the same content is presented using different levels of aesthetic treatment, the content with a higher aesthetic treatment was judged as having higher credibility. We call this the amelioration effect of visual design and aesthetics on content credibility. Holmes suggests that this effect is operational within the first few seconds in which a user views a web page. Given the same content, a higher aesthetic treatment will increase perceived credibility.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, J., &amp; Robins, D. (2008). Aesthetics and Credibility in Web Site Design. Information Processing and Management: an International Journal , 386-399.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bezhta''' (or '''Bezheta''') language (Bezhta: '''бежкьалас миц''', ''bežƛʼalas mic'', {{IPA-cau|ˈbeʒt͡ɬʼɑlɑs mit͡s|pron}}), also known as '''Kapucha''' (from the name of [[Kapucha (village)|a large village]]&lt;ref&gt;Shirin Akiner, ''Islamic Peoples of the Soviet Union'', 2nd ed. (KPI, Distributed by Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1986: {{ISBN|0-7103-0188-X}}), p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;), belongs to the [[Tsezic languages|Tsezic]] group of the [[North Caucasian languages|North Caucasian language family]]. It is spoken by about 6,200 people in southern [[Dagestan]], [[Russia]]&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=kap Ethnologue entry for Bezhta]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bezhta can be divided into three dialects – [[Bezhta Proper dialect|Bezhta Proper]], [[Tlyadal]] and [[Khocharkhotin]]&lt;ref name="Ethnologue" /&gt; – which are spoken in various villages in the region. Its closest linguistic relatives are [[Hunzib language|Hunzib]] and [[Khwarshi language|Khwarshi]].&lt;ref name="Schulze09"/&gt; Bezhta is unwritten, but various attempts have been made to develop an official orthography for the language. The [[Bezhta people]] use [[Avar language|Avar]] as the literary language. The first book ever printed in Bezhta was the [[Gospel of Luke]].&lt;ref name=IBT200012/&gt;

==Phonology==
{{expand section|date=January 2010}}
Bezhta has a rich consonantal and – unlike its relatives [[Tsez language|Tsez]] and [[Avar language|Avar]] – a relatively large vowel inventory (18 distinct vowel phonemes),{{citation needed|date=January 2010}} compared to other languages of the same family.

==Morphology==
{{expand section|date=January 2010}}
Bezhta is mostly [[agglutination|agglutinative]] and the vast amount of [[locative case]]s makes its case system particularly rich. The verb morphology is relatively simple, though. It is an [[ergative language]].{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Numerals==
Unlike [[Tsez language|Tsez]], Bezhta has a decimal system with the word for twenty being an exception.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}

* Multiples of 10 higher than 20 are formed by adding the suffix '''-yig''' ('''-йиг''') to the multiplier. Hence, the word for 30 is '''łanayig''' ('''лъанайиг''').
* Compound numbers are formed by [[wiktionary:juxtaposition|juxtaposition]], the smaller numbers following the greater ones. The number 47 is thus expressed as '''ṏqʼönäyig aƛna''' ('''оь&lt;sup&gt;н&lt;/sup&gt;къоьнаьйиг алIна''').

==Sample of the Bezhta language==
This is a passage taken from the [[Gospel of Luke]]&lt;ref name="Gospel" /&gt; written in a Cyrillic orthography based on [[Avar language|Avar]] and [[Chechen language|Chechen]], a Latinized transcription and one in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]].

== Synopsis ==
[[Image:Mariza - Jon And.jpg|thumb|Poster for a 1941 Stockholm production.]]
:Place: Hungary: the manor and estate of the Countess Maritza
:Time: Around 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Sources for the synopsis: "[http://www.guidetomusicaltheatre.com/shows_c/countess_maritza.htm Countess Maritza]" in 'Guide to Musical Theatre' website, accessed 18 October 2014: "[http://www.josef-weinberger.com/musicals/musical/countess-maritza-douglas.html Countess Maritza]" in Josef Weinberger Ltd. website, accessed 18 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manja the [[Romani people|gypsy]] girl flirts with the newly appointed bailiff, Béla Törek. Unknown to anyone, Törek is in fact the impoverished Count Tassilo, who is seeking to earn a living and set aside some cash for the dowry of his sister Lisa. The Countess Maritza, a young widow, unexpectedly arrives at the estate to celebrate her engagement. This 'engagement' is however quite fictitious, an invention intended to put off her numerous followers.  The name she has chosen for her suitor, based on her recollection of [[Johann Strauss II|Strauss']] operetta, ''[[The Gypsy Baron]]'', is Baron Koloman Zsupán. However, amongst Maritza's guests, to Tassilo's horror, is Lisa, who he instructs to keep their relationship and his identity strictly secret. Maritza is also embarrassed when a genuine Koloman Zsupán materialises, having seen an announcement of his 'engagement' in the press.
 
Tassilo is heard by the guests singing an air "Komm, Zigány" ("Come, gypsies!"), which he ends with a [[czardas]]. Maritza orders him to repeat it; he refuses, and the angry countess announces that he is fired. Manja predicts that The Countess will be very happy in love. "One moon will pass over this Earth and Maritza will find her happiness", she sings. Maritza therefore decides to remain on her estate. She stops Tassilo from leaving and apologises.

Zsupan has meanwhile decided that he prefers Lisa to Maritza, whilst Maritza is increasingly attracted to Tassilo. However, the ageing Lothario Populescu reveals to Maritza Tassilo's identity, and moreover alleges that Lisa is his girlfriend. Maritza in a high temper insults Tassilo, who declares that he will leave. However, before he goes, the repentant Maritza writes him a 'reference' which is in fact a proposal of marriage. The operetta ends with Maritza and Tassilo, and Zsupan and Lisa, engaged.

'''David Strecker''' (born August 12, 1950) also known by the alias '''Cuba Dave''', is a retired American laborer who received a 5-year prison sentence in [[Costa Rica]] for the promotion of [[Sex Tourism|sex tourism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ticotimes.net/2016/11/16/cuba-dave-verdict |title=Cuba Dave found guilty of promoting sex tourism, faces five more years in prison|accessdate= 9 January 2017|work=Tico Times|date= 16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his arrest and conviction, Strecker was held in preventative detention in San Sebastián prison in [[San José, Costa Rica]]. He is the first individual to be targeted for prosecution under Costa Rica's controversial new law, passed in 2012, that makes it illegal for a third party to profit on [[prostitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nearshoreamericas.com/cuba-dave-facing-year-sentence-promoting-sex-tourism-costa-rica/ |title=Florida Man Convicted Under New Sex Tourism Law in Costa Rica|accessdate=9 January 2017 |work=Nearshore America|date= 21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
__NOTOC__
==Early life==

David Strecker is a former [[softball]] pitcher who grew up in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], where he is a member of the Minnesota Softball Hall of Fame. After retiring from his work as a construction contractor, Strecker relocated to [[Key West]], [[Florida]], where he began to make extended trips to various Latin American countries. Strecker later documented these trips in various written articles and photos on his CubaDave web site and Facebook and MySpace pages, where he provided information to readers about his experiences with prostitutes across [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.co.cr/famous-sex-tourist-david-strecker-face-trial-november/51066/|title=Famous sex tourist David Strecker to face trial in November|accessdate= 9 January 2017|work=The Costa Rica Star|date=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2013 interview with the [[Miami New Times]], Strecker admitted to being a sex addict, having slept with more than 2,500 women and taking part in [[prostitution in Cuba]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Colombia]] and the [[Dominican Republic]], among other locations. A wall in his residence contained photos of women with which he had sexual relations more than 10 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/cubadaves-sex-tourism-empire-in-jeopardy-6394213 |title=Cuba Dave's Sex Tourism Empire in Jeopardy|accessdate= 9 January 2017|work=Miami New Times|date=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and trial==

Authorities in [[Costa Rica]] arrested Strecker on September 4, 2015 at [[Juan Santamaría International Airport]] while he was attempting to return to the [[United States]]. Strecker was charged with promoting [[Sex Tourism|sex tourism]] in [[Costa Rica]], a charged based upon a new 2012 law making it illegal to promote [[Sex Tourism|sex tourism]]. His arrest was precipitated by a complaint to [[Costa Rica]]'s Organismo de Investigación Judicial (OIJ) in August 2015 by the Fundación Rehab, an [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] that combats [[human trafficking]] in [[Costa Rica]].
While the government was preparing its case against Strecker, he was held in preventive detention for 14 months, as he was deemed to be a flight risk. He was unaware a trial date had been set until the eve of the trial, from his public defender. Strecker maintained his innocence during the detention and through his trial, proclaiming himself to be a political prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ticotimes.net/2016/03/22/jailed-costa-rica-sex-tourist-cuba-dave-im-a-political-prisoner|title=Jailed Costa Rica sex tourist Cuba Dave: 'I'm a political prisoner'|accessdate=9 January 2017|work=Tico Times|date=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he does not deny publishing images and articles about [[prostitution]] in [[Costa Rica]], he claims that these articles did not actively promote [[Sex Tourism|sex tourism]]. He told the Florida Keys News that, “In their mind, by me posting things or telling others how to safely do this, I’m promoting prostitution. There are lots of other things to do in Costa Rica. That part of it is only part of the trip, but they’re trying to make this look like that’s all my focus is.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://keysnews.com/node/69647|title='Cuba Dave' arrested in Costa Rica|accessdate=9 January 2017|work=Florida Keys News|date=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strecker was unable to fund his own legal defense and, with the help of Dennis Eatmon, created a legal defense fund. According to his website CubaDave.com,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cubadave.com/trial-begins-for-dave-strecker/|website=Free Cuba Dave|title=Trial Begins for David Strecker|accessdate=9 January 2017|date=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strecker was able to raise a total of $1500.00, and needed to raise an additional $1500.00 used to pay his legal expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.co.cr/famous-sex-tourist-david-strecker-face-trial-november/51066/|title=Famous sex tourist David Strecker to face trial in November|accessdate= 9 January 2017|work=The Costa Rica Star|date=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conviction==

In a trial that lasted only a week, on November 16, 2016 David Strecker became the first person convicted under [[Costa Rica]]’s new [[Sex Tourism]] Law. He was convicted by three judges in [[San José, Costa Rica]] by unanimous decision. Judge Vivian Obando berated Strecker during the sentencing hearing, telling him that his articles have done “societal harm” to the country's external image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ticotimes.net/2016/11/16/cuba-dave-verdict|title=Cuba Dave found guilty of promoting sex tourism, faces five more years in prison|accessdate=9 January 2017|work=Tico Times|date=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence presented in the trial was principally derived from Strecker's own articles, photos, and various YouTube videos in which he described his sexual exploits.

Strecker was sentenced to a five-year prison term for violating the 2012 law prohibiting the promotion of [[Costa Rica]] as a [[Sex Tourism|sexual tourism]] destination. Strecker was released on August 18, 2017 after having his conviction dismissed by an appellate court.

On May 25th, 2017, an appellate court vacated the decision against David Strecker, citing fundamental flaws in Costa Rica's Law 9095 and serious flaws in the evidence presented in the case. The prosecution contested the decision. Mr. Strecker remained held in prison while awaiting the outcome of the prosecution's appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qcostarica.com/david-strecker-aka-cuba-dave-wins-appeal-says-website-bearing-his-name/|title=David Strecker Aka “Cuba Dave” Wins Appeal, Says Website Bearing His Name|accessdate=9 January 2017|work=Q Costa Rica|date=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A.M. Costa Rica reported on August 18, 2017 that David Strecker has been acquitted and released.

'''Disability in Yemen''' has been increasing over time, especially because of increased conflict in the area. [[Disability|Disabled people]] in [[Yemen]] face many challenges due to [[poverty]], lack of accessible infrastructure, [[Sex segregation|gender segregation]] and more. The government of Yemen has passed laws to help protect the rights of the disabled in their country, but not all laws are equally enforced.

== Demographics ==
A 2004 estimate indicated that there were around 380,000 disabled people in Yemen.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/middle-east/yemens-disabled-face-segregation#full|title=Yemen's disabled face segregation|last=Al Qadhi|first=Mohammed|date=8 November 2008|work=The National|access-date=2017-06-01|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A paper produced by the [[United Nations]] (UN) in 2009 estimated the number at between 3 and 5% of the population.{{Sfn|ESCWA|2009|p=4}} The Yemen government recorded around 150,000 Yemeni people with disabilities,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yementimes.com/en/1698/health/2699/Resources-few-for-autistic-children-Yemeni-law-fails-to-guarantee-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.htm|title=Resources few for autistic children Yemeni law fails to guarantee rights of persons with disabilities|last=Hassan|first=Najila'a|date=29 July 2013|work=Yemen Times|access-date=2017-06-01|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in 2014, the [[Yemeni Handicapped Forum]] revealed that there were more than two million people living with some type of disability in Yemen.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yementimes.com/en/1839/news/4648/Local-NGO-Number-of-disabled-citizens-in-Yemen-exceeds-two-million.htm|title=Local NGO: Number of disabled citizens in Yemen exceeds two million|last=Al-Moshki|first=Ali Ibrahim|date=4 December 2014|work=Yemen Times|access-date=2017-06-01|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ongoing conflict in Yemen has added to the number of people who are disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/tr/contents/articles/originals/2016/11/yemen-war-recovery-social-economy-problems.html|title=Is Yemen falling into an abyss?|last=Nasser|first=Amal|date=2016-11-28|work=Al-Monitor|access-date=2017-06-01|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been around 28,500 people injured in Yemen since March of 2015.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.handicap-international.us/yemen_helping_war_survivors_recover_physically_and_mentally|title=Yemen: Helping War Survivors Recover Physically and Mentally|work=Handicap International|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of people in Yemen diagnosed with [[autism]] has increased over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yementimes.com/en/1581/report/995/Summer-camp-aims-to-support-autistic-children.htm|title=Summer camp aims to support autistic children|last=Al-Muraqab|first=Ashraf|date=14 June 2012|work=Yemen Times|access-date=2017-06-03|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Disabled individuals make up less than 1% of the workforce in the country.{{Sfn|ESCWA|2009|p=7}} More individuals with disability live in [[Rural area|rural areas]] of Yemen.{{Sfn|MoSAL|2010|p=13}} In addition, those in the lowest [[Income bracket|income brackets]] are twice as likely to be disabled as people in the highest brackets as reported in 2005.{{Sfn|MoSAL|2010|p=13}}

== Causes ==
In many cases disability in Yemen could be prevented.{{Sfn|ESCWA|2009|p=4}} People in Yemen have disabilities related to [[Spinal cord injury|spinal cord injuries]] which could be corrected with surgery.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Incidents of [[Poliomyelitis|polio]] still occur in Yemen,{{Sfn|Grut|Ingstad|2006|p=18}} with 485 cases occurring in 2005 and 2006.{{Sfn|Ingstad|Baider|Grut|2011|p=147}} Approximately 30% of disabilities in Yemen may result from [[Congenital disorder|congenital]] conditions or from complications during [[Birth|delivery]] as reported in 2003.{{Sfn|MoSAL|2010|p=14}}

A study released by [[Ibrahim Omran]] ties most cases of disability to war and conflict in Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nationalyemen.com/2012/06/16/perseverance-and-pain-for-yemens-disabled/|title=Perseverance and pain for Yemen’s disabled|last=Al-Arashi|first=Fakhri|date=2012|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of armed conflict in the region, thousands of Yemeni people have lost limbs since 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icrc.org/en/document/scars-war-yemens-disabled|title=The scars of war: Yemen's disabled|date=2016-05-23|work=International Committee of the Red Cross|access-date=2017-05-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traffic accidents, conflicts between tribes, [[Land mine|land mines]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icrc.org/en/document/yemen-disability-not-obstacle|title=Yemen: Disability is not an obstacle|date=2016-12-02|work=International Committee of the Red Cross|access-date=2017-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; spinal fever, [[Genetic disorder|genetic diseases]] and [[malnutrition]] are also leading causes of disability in Yemen.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Marriages between close [[Cousin|cousins]] also increases changes of genetic causes of disability.{{Sfn|Grut|Ingstad|2006|p=27}}

== Cultural attitudes towards disability ==
The major religion of Yemen, [[Islam]], emphasizes caring for the disabled and enduring hardship. This attitude affects the way that many Yemeni people face the challenges of disability.{{Sfn|Ingstad|Baider|Grut|2011|p=144}}

Families of disabled people and those who are disabled can, however, face [[social stigma]].{{Sfn|ESCWA|2009|p=5}} Some people in Yemen believe that mothers can pass a disability to their children.{{Sfn|ESCWA|2009|p=5}} Families have kept disabled people under virtual [[house arrest]] in some situations because of the shame associated with disability.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Disabled women have difficulty seeing themselves getting married, although disabled men in Yemen imagined they would be able to marry almost anyone.{{Sfn|Grut|Ingstad|2006|p=24}}

Individuals with disability in Yemen can be denied access to education, employment, access to healthcare and have difficulties with public spaces and transportation that are not designed to accommodate disabled people.{{Sfn|ESCWA|2009|p=5}}&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Sport===
Yemen has participated in the Paralympic Games only once, the [[Yemen at the 1992 Summer Paralympics|1992 Summer Games in Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IPC medals | npc = YEM }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|June 2017}} the Yemen Paralympic Committee is suspended from the [[International Paralympic Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.paralympic.org/yemen-suspended&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy ==
The government organization responsible for helping disabled individuals is the [[Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour (Yemen)|Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour]] (MoSAL).{{Sfn|ESCWA|2009|p=9}} MoSAL also has a Disability Fund (DF).{{Sfn|Grut|Ingstad|2006|p=16}} Yemen is one of the countries who has ratified the UN [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/12/03/people-disabilities-added-risk-war-displacement|title=People with Disabilities at Added Risk in War, Displacement|date=2015-12-03|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2017-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Social Fund for Development (Yemen)|Social Fund for Development]] (SFD) is a social safety net created in 1997 which targets at-risk people in Yemen, including people with disabilities.{{Sfn|Grut|Ingstad|2006|p=16}} In 2008, the SFD supported programs for 1,083 children with disabilities.{{Sfn|MoSAL|2010|p=16}} The government of Yemen, in 2007, created a National Disability Strategy which "outlines the vision, objectives and principles of a 'rights-based' approach to disability for Yemen."{{Sfn|MoSAL|2010|p=8}}

The [[Ministry of Education (Yemen)|Ministry of Education]] in Yemen has not always had enough funding to support disabled students.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There are only a few schools for disabled children and these are only in Yemen's cities.{{Sfn|Grut|Ingstad|2006|p=21}} Most people with disabilities in Yemen lack education and only 23.6% of those with disabilities have finished [[secondary school]], according to a 2005 study.{{Sfn|MoSAL|2010|p=16}}

=== Non-governmental organizations ===
Various [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) operate in Yemen to help people with disabilities, however, many are underfunded.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Organizations like [[Handicap International]] have helped by donating [[Mobility aid|mobility aids]] and offer [[Psychology|psychological]] support for people in Yemen.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The [[Yemen Center for Autism]] (YCA) in [[Sana'a]] helps individuals with [[autism]] and their families.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, YCA has had trouble meeting the needs of their clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yementimes.com/en/1625/report/1609/Yemen-Center-for-Autism-struggling-%E2%80%98alone%E2%80%99-to-serve-a-growing-population-nationwide.htm|title=Yemen Center for Autism: struggling ‘alone’ to serve a growing population nationwide|last=Al-Wesabi|first=Sadeq|date=14 November 2012|work=Yemen Times|access-date=2017-06-03|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Altahadi Foundation, also in Sana'a, helps disabled women and girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.islamic-relief.org/wheelchairs-and-walkers-distributed/|title=Wheelchairs and Walkers Distributed|last=|first=|date=|website=Islamic Relief|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legislation ===
The Law for the Welfare of Disabled (Law Number 2, 2002) is considered by the [[United Nations|UN]] to be the principal document pertaining to people with disability.{{Sfn|ESCWA|2009|p=7}} Other laws covering disability include articles 115 - 123 of the Child Law (Number 45, 2002) and Public Law Number 61, 1999.{{Sfn|ESCWA|2009|p=7}} Public Law (61/1999) guarantees that disabled people have the same rights as non-disabled people under the [[Constitution of Yemen]].{{Sfn|Grut|Ingstad|2006|p=15}} It also "allocates the responsibility for disability to the Disability Fund.{{Sfn|MoSAL|2010|p=16}} Civil Service Law Number 19 in 1991 and Labor Law Number 5 in 1995 both address quotas to be met for the employment of people with disabilities.{{Sfn|MoSAL|2010|p=16}} Building Code 19 of 2002 is intended to create [[Accessibility|accessible]] [[infrastructure]].{{Sfn|MoSAL|2010|p=16}}

Disabled people, however, have claimed that while the laws Yemen has created are good, they are rarely [[Coming into force|enforced]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yementimes.com/en/1780/variety/3842/People-with-disabilities--freedom-of-expression.htm|title=People with disabilities &amp; freedom of expression|last=|first=|date=13 May 2014|work=Yemen Times|access-date=2017-06-01|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wording of the laws is also often vague, making it difficult to enforce these laws on behalf of disabled people.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Unique challenges ==
Because of ongoing conflict in Yemen, people with disabilities face problems such as lack of services and inability to access buildings. [[Rubble]] in the streets can make it difficult for those with physical disabilities to access services.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/05/11/dispatches-disabilities-yemen-left-rubble|title=Dispatches: With Disabilities in Yemen, Left in the Rubble|date=2015-05-11|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2017-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Areas that have received heavy bombing have had to discontinue services to people with disabilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In late 2015, [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]]-led coalitions bombed the Al Noor Center for Care and Rehabilitation of the Blind in Sana'a.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.vice.com/article/saudi-arabia-bombed-a-rehabilitation-center-for-blind-people-in-yemen|title=The Saudi Coalition Bombed A Rehabilitation Center for Blind People in Yemen|last=Oakford|first=Samuel|date=5 January 2016|work=VICE News|access-date=2017-06-03|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) states that people with disabilities are at increased risk during times of crisis and conflict.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; People with disabilities and their families have had difficulty leaving conflict zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=50769|title=Yemen conflict death toll nears 650, with UN rights office spotlighting plight of 3 million disabled|last=|first=|date=2015-05-05|website=UN News Service Section|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 3, 2016, disabled Yemenis rallied on the [[United Nations' International Day of Persons with Disabilities|International Day of Persons with Disabilities]], asking that the conflict in Yemen end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/photo/2016-12/04/c_135878684.htm|title=Disabled people rally to call for early end to crisis in Yemen|last=|first=|date=4 December 2016|website=Xinhua|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because most Yemeni people live in rural areas outside of cities, it is difficult to access services for people with disability.{{Sfn|Grut|Ingstad|2006|p=27}} Due to the poverty of many disabled Yemeni people, [[Assistive technology|assistive devices]] are too expensive to purchase.{{Sfn|Grut|Ingstad|2006|p=35}} Government services meant to help disabled people in poverty must be requested in person in Sana'a and require that the applicant be [[Literacy|literate]].{{Sfn|Ingstad|Baider|Grut|2011|p=148}}

=== Gender and disability ===
Disabled women in Yemen face unique challenges because of the conservative attitude towards women in the country.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Disabled women in 2004 had [[Literacy|illiteracy]] rates as high as 87 to 90 percent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  In some cases, however, education for disabled girls was actively encouraged as an alternative opportunity.{{Sfn|Ingstad|Baider|Grut|2011|p=147}}

Women in Yemen who become disabled as adults and are unable to perform their usual roles can lose their sense of self-worth.{{Sfn|Ingstad|Baider|Grut|2011|p=142}}

Non-disabled women are often prevented from getting an education or marrying out of the family unit if there are disabled members of her family; she is expected to help care for the family members with disabilities.{{Sfn|Ingstad|Baider|Grut|2011|p=143}}

Female teachers have rejected teaching disabled men because of the stratification of Yemeni society where men and women do not normally interact with one another.{{Sfn|Ingstad|Baider|Grut|2011|p=147}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6176">Marriage legislation has a long tradition in the Netherlands. The minimum age at marriage was set in the 1811 Civil Code, amended in 1838. Same sex marriage was allowed in 2001. The first Family Allowance Act was introduced in 1941, and provided benefits only to working families with more than two children. In 1947, the income dependency was abolished and wage earners were also entitled to an allowance for their first and second children under 18 years old. In 1963, family allowances were extended to self-employed people. Currently, all families living in the Netherlands are entitled to a family allowance if their child (biological, adopted, step or foster) is younger than 18 years old. In 1956, the Netherlands passed the Nursery Education Act that funded preschool; however, in 1981, preschool was added to the standard education system. The Childcare Act of 2005 gave childcare an official framework which provided funding and supervision for many programs.

==Marriage==

Marriage in the Netherlands has very few rules that have changed throughout history. The first rule was set in the 1811 Civil Code which stated that the groom must be at least 18 years of age and the bride must be at least 15 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;Van de Brekel, J.C., van de Kaa, D.J. (1994). The Netherlands: aspects of family policy in the setting of the Second Demographic Trainsition. In W. Dumon (ed.) Changing Family Policies In the Member States of the European Union. Brussels.pp. 225-54.&lt;/ref&gt; This was changed in 1838 when brides were made to be at least 16 years of age and grooms still 18. Recent additions to the Civil Code have changed the brides' age to 18, along with the grooms' age of 18.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"Dutch Civil Codes."&amp;nbsp;''Dutch Civil Law''. N.p., n.d. Web. 20 Nov. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

These Civil Codes also added to the laws that in order to be married in the Netherlands, one partner must be Dutch or currently living in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Along with this law was the provision of relatives marrying; however, it only applies to brother-sister, parent-child, and grandparent-grandchild.

Pre-2001, the Civil Code did not explicitly address [[same-sex marriage]]. In 2001, a law was created that allowed same-sex marriage in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Waaldijk, K. (2005). Major legal consequences of marriage, cohabitation, and registered partnership for different-sex and same-sex partners in the Netherlands. In: K. Waaldijk (eds.), more or less together: levels of legal consequences of marriage, cohabitation and registered countries. Paris: Institut National d’Etudes Démographiques, pp. 137-154.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family provisions==

In 1941, the Family Allowance Act was created in order to support families in hard times; however, this act only applied to working families with three or more children.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Thévenon, O. (2011). Family Policies in OECD Countries: A Comparative Analysis. Population and Development Review (March). 37, 1: 57—87.&lt;/ref&gt; This was because it was assumed that an average salary was enough to support a family with two children. In addition to this, the children had to be dependent on the parent and once the child turned 15, the benefits no longer applied.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1947, working families were allowed benefits from all children if they were under the age of 18 years old; in 1963, benefits were extended to self-employed families as well.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Hantrais, L., Letablier, M-T. (1996). Families and family policies in Europe. Addison Wesley.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Family allowance is broken down based on the age of the child in euros per month (EpM): 0-6=191.65 EpM, 6-12=232.71 EpM, 12-18=273.78 EpM.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics Netherlands (2014). Ouderschapsverlof; gebruik en duur. Den Haag/Heerlen: 31-07-2014. Retrieved from: &amp;nbsp;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/publication/?DM=SLNL&amp;PA=72022ned&amp;D1=0-3&amp;D&lt;/nowiki&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;

If a child is earning more than 1,266 euros per quarter or is receiving study benefits, the family can not receive benefits for them. Additionally, a family is only allowed benefits for 16 and 17-year-olds if they are actively participating in an education program to receive a VMBO, HAVO, or VWO.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

These rules change slightly given different situations such as [[disability]], [[single-parent]] families, and other special circumstances.

==Childcare==

In 1956, the Netherlands passed the Nursery Education Act that funded preschool; however, in 1981, preschool was added to the standard education system.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;OECD (2011). Doing Better for Families. Paris, OECD.&lt;/ref&gt; Four-year-olds were allowed to be enrolled in school but it was not mandatory; school became mandatory once the child reached five years old. If a child has the possibility of a language disadvantage, mainly for immigrant children, they can be enrolled as young as two years old in order to catch them up before [[primary school]] started.&lt;ref&gt;Selton, Wieke, and Anne H. Gauthier. "Family Policies: Netherlands."&amp;nbsp;''Perfar''. European Commission, 2014. Web. 20 Nov. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daycare]] and after-school care have policies dating back to the 1970s in the Netherlands. The recent increase in women in the workforce has called for an increase in the amount of daycare and after-school care needed.&lt;ref&gt;Stier, H., Lewin-Epstein, N., Braun, M. (2001). Welfare regimes, family-suportive policies, and women's employment alogn the life-course. American Journal of Sociology. 106, 6: 1731—60.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the system is mixed of formal, informal, public, and private care. The Childcare Act of 2005 gave childcare an official framework and provided funding and supervision for many programs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 2010, the act was amended and renamed to the "Childcare and Quality Standards for Playgroups Act".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This new version of the act provided better supervision and funding while also regulating the quality of these daycare facilities and providing education for the children in these facilities.

The '''Haymarket affair''' (also known as the '''Haymarket massacre''', '''Haymarket riot''', or '''Haymarket Square riot''') was the aftermath of a bombing that took place at a labor [[demonstration (protest)|demonstration]] on Tuesday, May 4, 1886, at Haymarket Square in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofchicago.org/Landmarks/S/SiteHaymarket.html |title=Originally at the corner of Des Plaines and Randolph |publisher=Cityofchicago.org |accessdate=March 18, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506053947/http://www.cityofchicago.org/Landmarks/S/SiteHaymarket.html |archivedate=May 6, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It began as a peaceful rally in support of workers [[Strike action|striking]] for an [[eight-hour day]] and in reaction to the killing of several workers the previous day by the police. An unknown person threw a dynamite bomb at the police as they acted to disperse the public meeting. The bomb blast and ensuing gunfire resulted in the deaths of seven police officers and at least four civilians; dozens of others were wounded.

In the internationally publicized legal proceedings that followed, eight [[anarchism|anarchists]] were convicted of [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]]. The evidence was that one of the defendants may have built the bomb, but none of those on trial had thrown it.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Messer-Kruse, ''The Haymarket Conspiracy: Transatlantic Anarchist Networks'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Carl|title=Act III: Toils of the Law|url=http://www.chicagohistoryresources.org/dramas//act3/act3.htm|work=The Dramas of Haymarket|publisher=Chicago Historical Society and Northwestern University|accessdate=December 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See generally, {{cite web |url=http://www.chicagohistoryresources.org/hadc/transcript/volumek/401-450/K405-497.htm |title=Testimony of Harry L.

The death sentences of two of the defendants were [[commutation of sentence|commuted]] by Illinois governor [[Richard J. Oglesby]] to terms of life in prison, and another committed suicide in jail rather than face the gallows. The other four were hanged on November 11, 1887. In 1893, Illinois's new governor, [[John Peter Altgeld]], pardoned the remaining defendants and criticized the trial.

The Haymarket Affair is generally considered significant as the origin of [[International Workers' Day]], held on May 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Trachtenberg |first=Alexander |title=The History of May Day |origyear=1932 |url=http://www.marxists.org/subject/mayday/articles/tracht.html |accessdate=January 19, 2008 |date=March 2002 |publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive|Marxists.org]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foner, "The First May Day and the Haymarket Affair", ''May Day'', pp. 27–39.&lt;/ref&gt; According to labor studies professor William J. Adelman:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No single event has influenced the history of labor in Illinois, the United States, and even the world, more than the Chicago Haymarket Affair. It began with a rally on May 4, 1886, but the consequences are still being felt today. Although the rally is included in American history textbooks, very few present the event accurately or point out its significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.illinoislaborhistory.org/the-haymarket-affair/|title=The Haymarket Affair|publisher=illinoislaborhistory.org|accessdate=October 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The site of the incident was designated a [[Chicago Landmark]] in 1992,&lt;ref name=Chicago-Landmark&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/S/SiteHaymarket.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714210245/http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/S/SiteHaymarket.html |archivedate=July 14, 2006 |title=Site of the Haymarket Tragedy |accessdate=January 19, 2008 |publisher=City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development, Landmarks Division |year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a public sculpture was dedicated there in 2004. In addition, the ''[[Haymarket Martyrs' Monument]]'' at the defendants' burial site in nearby Forest Park was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1997.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/nhl/designations/listsofNHLs.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709054740/http://www.nps.gov/nhl/designations/listsofNHLs.htm |archivedate=2008-07-09 |title=Lists of National Historic Landmarks |accessdate=January 19, 2008 |date=March 2004 |work=[[National Historic Landmark|National Historic Landmarks Program]] |publisher=[[National Park Service]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Following the Civil War, particularly following the [[Long Depression]], there was a rapid expansion of industrial production in the United States. Chicago was a major industrial center and tens of thousands of German and [[Bohemian]] immigrants were employed at about $1.50 a day. American workers worked on average slightly over 60 hours, during a six-day work week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Working Hours of the World Unite? New International Evidence of Worktime, 1870–1913 | author=Huberman, Michael | journal=The Journal of Economic History |date=Dec 2004 | volume=64 | issue=4 | page=971 | doi=10.1017/s0022050704043050|jstor = 3874986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city became a center for many attempts to organize labor's demands for better working conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barrett|first=James R.|title=Unionization|url=http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1284.html|work=Encyclopedia of Chicago|publisher=Chicago History Museum, Newberry Library, Northwestern University|accessdate=April 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Employers responded with anti-union measures, such as firing and blacklisting union members, locking out workers, recruiting strikebreakers; employing spies, thugs, and private security forces and exacerbating ethnic tensions in order to divide the workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moberg|first=David|title=Antiunionism|url=http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/55.html|work=Encyclopedia of Chicago|publisher=Chicago History Museum, Newberry Library, Northwestern University|accessdate=April 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream newspapers supported business interests, and were opposed by the labor and immigrant press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reiff|first=Janice L.|title=The Press and Labor in the 1880s|url=http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/11407.html|work=Encyclopedia of Chicago|publisher=Chicago History Museum, Newberry Library, Northwestern University|accessdate=April 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the economic slowdown between 1882 and 1886, socialist and anarchist organizations were active. Membership of the [[Knights of Labor]], which rejected socialism and radicalism, but supported the 8-hour work day, grew from 70,000 in 1884 to over 700,000 by 1886.&lt;ref&gt;Kemmerer, Donald L.; Edward D. Wickersham (January 1950). "Reasons for the Growth of the Knights of Labor in 1885–1886". Industrial and Labor Relations Review 3 (2): 213–220.&lt;/ref&gt; In Chicago, the anarchist movement of several thousand, mostly immigrant, workers centered about the German-language newspaper [[Arbeiter-Zeitung (Chicago)|''Arbeiter-Zeitung'']] ("Workers' Times"), edited by [[August Spies]]. Other anarchists operated a militant revolutionary force with an armed section that was equipped with guns and explosives. Its revolutionary strategy centered around the belief that successful operations against the police and the seizure of major industrial centers would result in massive public support by workers, start a revolution, destroy capitalism, and establish a socialist economy.&lt;ref name = "DavidBackground" &gt;Henry David, ''The History of the Haymarket Affair'' (1936), introductory chapters, pages 21 to 138&lt;/ref&gt;

===May Day parade and strikes===
In October 1884, a convention held by the [[Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions]] unanimously set May 1, 1886, as the date by which the [[Eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]] would become standard.&lt;ref name='How May Day Became a Workers Holiday-resolution'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A627662 |title=How May Day Became a Workers' Holiday |accessdate=January 19, 2008 |date=October 4, 2001 |work=The Guide to Life, The Universe and Everything |publisher=BBC |quote=(It is) Resolved ... that eight hours shall constitute a legal day's labor from and after May 1, 1886, and that we recommend to labor organizations throughout this district that they so direct their laws so as to conform to this resolution by the time named. }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the chosen date approached, U.S. labor unions prepared for a [[general strike]] in support of the eight-hour day.&lt;ref name='How May Day Became a Workers Holiday-strike'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A627662 |title=How May Day Became a Workers' Holiday |accessdate=January 19, 2008 |date=October 4, 2001 |work=The Guide to Life, The Universe and Everything |publisher=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Saturday, May 1, thousands of workers went on strike and rallies were held throughout the United States, with the cry, "Eight-hour day with no cut in pay." Estimates of the number of striking workers across the U.S. range from 300,000&lt;ref name=Avrich186/&gt; to half a million.&lt;ref name=Foner27/&gt; In New York City, the number of demonstrators was estimated at 10,000&lt;ref&gt;Foner, ''May Day'', pp. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Detroit at 11,000.&lt;ref name=Foner28&gt;Foner, ''May Day'', p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], some 10,000 workers turned out.&lt;ref name=Foner28/&gt; In Chicago, the movement's center, an estimated 30,000-to-40,000 workers had gone on strike&lt;ref name=Avrich186&gt;Avrich, ''The Haymarket Tragedy'', p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; and there were perhaps twice as many people out on the streets participating in various demonstrations and marches,&lt;ref&gt;According to Henry David there were strikes by "no less than 30,000 men", and "perhaps twice that number (i.e., 80,000) were out on the streets participating in or witnessing the various demonstrations..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=David&gt;David, ''The History of the Haymarket Affair'', pp. 177, 188.&lt;/ref&gt; as, for example, a march by 10,000 men employed in the Chicago lumber yards.&lt;ref name=Foner27&gt;Foner, ''May Day'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Though participants in these events added up to 80,000, it is disputed whether there was a march of that number down [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]] led by [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[Albert Parsons]], founder of the [[International Working People's Association]] [IWPA], his wife [[Lucy Parsons]] and their children.&lt;ref name=Avrich186/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The existence of an 80,000 person march down Michigan Avenue, described by Avrich (1984), Foner (1986), and others, has been questioned by historian [http://blogs.bgsu.edu/haymarket/myth-4-the-great-march-of-the-80000/ Timothy Messer-Kruse], who claims to have found no specific reference to it in contemporary sources and notes that David (1936) doesn't mention it.&lt;/ref&gt;

''(right)''{{Clear}}The words "Workingmen Arm Yourselves and Appear in Full Force!" were removed from the revised flier.}}
On May 3, striking workers in Chicago met near the [[McCormick Harvesting Machine Company]] plant. Union molders at the plant had been [[Lockout (industry)|locked out]] since early February and the predominantly Irish-American workers at McCormick had come under attack from [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton]] guards during an earlier strike action in 1885. This event, along with the eight-hour militancy of McCormick workers, had gained the strikers some respect and notoriety around the city. By the time of the 1886 general strike, [[strikebreaker]]s entering the McCormick plant were under protection from a garrison of 400 police officers. Although half of the replacement workers defected to the general strike on May 1, McCormick workers continued to harass [[strikebreaker]]s as they crossed the picket lines.

Speaking to a rally outside the plant on May 3, [[August Spies]] advised the striking workers to "hold together, to stand by their union, or they would not succeed".&lt;ref name=greenMcCormick/&gt; Well-planned and coordinated, the general strike to this point had remained largely [[nonviolent]]. When the end-of-the-workday bell sounded, however, a group of workers surged to the gates to confront the strikebreakers. Despite calls for calm by Spies, the police fired on the crowd. Two McCormick workers were killed (although some newspaper accounts said there were six fatalities).&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, ''The Haymarket Tragedy'', p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; Spies would later testify, "I was very indignant. I knew from experience of the past that this butchering of people was done for the express purpose of defeating the eight-hour movement."&lt;ref name=greenMcCormick&gt;Green, ''Death in the Haymarket'', pp. 162–173.&lt;/ref&gt;

Outraged by this act of [[police violence]], local anarchists quickly printed and distributed fliers calling for a rally the following day at Haymarket Square (also called the Haymarket), which was then a bustling commercial center near the corner of Randolph Street and Desplaines Street. Printed in German and English, the fliers claimed that the police had murdered the strikers on behalf of business interests and urged workers to seek justice. The first batch of fliers contain the words ''Workingmen Arm Yourselves and Appear in Full Force!'' When Spies saw the line, he said he would not speak at the rally unless the words were removed from the flier. All but a few hundred of the fliers were destroyed, and new fliers were printed without the offending words.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, ''The Haymarket Tragedy'', p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 20,000 copies of the revised flier were distributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Illinois vs. August Spies et al. trial transcript no. 1, 1886 Nov. 26 |url=http://www.chicagohistoryresources.org/hadc/transcript/volumem/201-250/M250-263.htm |accessdate=December 30, 2017 |volume=M |page=255 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rally at Haymarket Square===
[[File:Revenge flyer.jpg|thumb|The revenge flyer]]
The rally began peacefully under a light rain on the evening of May 4. [[August Spies]], [[Albert Parsons]], and [[Samuel Fielden]] spoke to a crowd estimated variously between 600 and 3,000&lt;ref name=Nelson189&gt;{{cite book |first=Bruce C. |last=Nelson |title=Beyond the Martyrs: A Social History of Chicago's Anarchists, 1870–1900 |location=New Brunswick, N.J. |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1988 |isbn=0-8135-1345-6 |page=189 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while standing in an open wagon adjacent to the square on Des Plaines Street.&lt;ref name=Chicago-Landmark/&gt; A large number of on-duty police officers watched from nearby.&lt;ref name=Chicago-Landmark/&gt;

[[Paul Avrich]], a historian specializing in the study of anarchism, quotes Spies as saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There seems to prevail the opinion in some quarters that this meeting has been called for the purpose of inaugurating a riot, hence these warlike preparations on the part of so-called 'law and order.' However, let me tell you at the beginning that this meeting has not been called for any such purpose. The object of this meeting is to explain the general situation of the eight-hour movement and to throw light upon various incidents in connection with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In the Supreme Court of Illinois, Northern Grand Division. March Term, 1887. August Spies, et al. v. The People of the State of Illinois. Abstract of Record |publisher=Barnard &amp; Gunthorpe |location=Chicago |oclc=36384114 |nopp=true |page=vol. II, p. 129 }}, quoted in Avrich, ''The Haymarket Tragedy'', pp. 199–200.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following Spies' speech, the crowd was addressed by Parsons, the Alabama-born editor of the radical English-language weekly ''[[The Alarm (newspaper)|The Alarm]].''&lt;ref name=Nelson188&gt;Nelson, ''Beyond the Martyrs'', p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; The crowd was so calm that Mayor [[Carter Harrison Sr.]], who had stopped by to watch, walked home early. Parsons spoke for almost an hour before standing down in favor of the last speaker of the evening, the British socialist Samuel Fielden, who delivered a brief ten-minute address. Many of the crowd had already left as the weather was deteriorating.&lt;ref name=Nelson188 /&gt;

A ''New York Times'' article, with the dateline May 4, and headlined "Rioting and Bloodshed in the Streets of Chicago ... Twelve Policemen Dead or Dying", reported that  Fielden spoke for 20 minutes, alleging that his words grew "wilder and more violent as he proceeded".&lt;ref name=NYTMay5 /&gt; Another ''New York Times'' article, headlined "Anarchy's Red Hand" and dated May 6, opens with: "The villainous teachings of the Anarchists bore bloody fruit in Chicago tonight and before daylight at least a dozen stalwart men will have laid down their lives as a tribute to the doctrine of Herr [[Johann Most]]." It referred to the strikers as a "mob" and used quotation marks around the term "workingmen".&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' article datelined May 4, headlined "Anarchy's Red Hand" and dated May 6, reproduced on the [http://famous-trials.com/haymarket/1191-redhand5-6 University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law website].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bombing and gunfire====
[[File:Haymarket Affair map Chicago Tribune may 5, 1886.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A map of the bombing published by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' on May 5, 1886]]
At about 10:30&amp;nbsp;pm, just as Fielden was finishing his speech, police arrived en masse, marching in formation towards the speakers' wagon, and ordered the rally to disperse.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich (1984), pp. 205–206.&lt;/ref&gt; Fielden insisted that the meeting was peaceful. Police Inspector John Bonfield proclaimed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I command you [addressing the speaker] in the name of the law to desist and you [addressing the crowd] to disperse.&lt;ref name=NYTMay5 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inspector John Bonfield report to Frederick Ebersold, General Superintendent of Police, 1886 May 30.|url=http://www.chicagohistoryresources.org/hadc/manuscripts/m03/M03.htm|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|accessdate=December 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Witnesses maintained that immediately after the bomb blast there was an exchange of gunshots between police and demonstrators.&lt;ref name = "Riot" &gt;Schaack, ''Anarchy and Anarchists'', pp. 146–148.&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts vary widely as to who fired first and whether any of the crowd fired at the police. Historian Paul Avrich maintains that the police fired on the fleeing demonstrators, reloaded and then fired again, killing four and wounding as many as 70 people. What is not disputed is that in less than five minutes the square was empty except for the casualties. According to the May 4 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]],'' demonstrators began firing at the police, who then returned fire.&lt;ref name=NYTMay5 /&gt; In his report on the incident, Inspector Bonfield wrote that he "gave the order to cease firing, fearing that some of our men, in the darkness might fire into each other".&lt;ref name="John Bonfield report"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagohistoryresources.org/hadc/manuscripts/m03/M03.htm#M03P020 |title=Inspector John Bonfield report to Frederick Ebersold, General Superintendent of Police |accessdate=December 30, 2017 |last=Bonfield |first=John |date=May 30, 1886 |work=Haymarket Affair Digital Collection |publisher=Chicago Historical Society }}&lt;/ref&gt; An anonymous police official told the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', "A very large number of the police were wounded by each other's revolvers. ... It was every man for himself, and while some got two or three squares away, the rest emptied their revolvers, mainly into each other."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', June 27, 1886, quoted in Avrich, ''The Haymarket Tragedy'', p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

In all, seven policemen and at least four workers were killed. Another policeman died two years after the incident from complications related to injuries received on that day.&lt;ref name="the bomb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagohistoryresources.org/dramas/act2/act2.htm |title=Act II: Let Your Tragedy Be Enacted Here |accessdate=December 30, 2017 |year=2000 |work=The Dramas of Haymarket |publisher=Chicago Historical Society }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 60 policemen were wounded in the incident. They were carried, along with some other wounded people, into a nearby police station. Police captain Michael Schaack later wrote that the number of wounded workers was "largely in excess of that on the side of the police".&lt;ref name="Schaack"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schaack |first=Michael J. |title=Anarchy and Anarchists.

===Aftermath and red scare===
A harsh anti-union clampdown followed the Haymarket incident. There was a massive outpouring of community and business support for the police and many thousands of dollars were donated to funds for their medical care and to assist their efforts. The entire labor and immigrant community, particularly Germans and Bohemians, came under suspicion. Police raids were carried out on homes and offices of suspected anarchists. Dozens of suspects, many only remotely related to the Haymarket affair, were arrested. Casting legal requirements such as search warrants aside, Chicago police squads subjected the labor activists of Chicago to an eight-week shakedown, ransacking their meeting halls and places of business. The emphasis was on the speakers at the Haymarket rally and the newspaper ''Arbeiter-Zeitung''. A small group of anarchists were discovered to have been engaged in making bombs on the same day as the incident, including round ones like the one used in Haymarket Square.&lt;ref name=Manhunt&gt;Avrich (1984), pp. 221–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspaper reports declared that anarchist agitators were to blame for the "riot", a view adopted by an alarmed public. As time passed, press reports and illustrations of the incident became more elaborate. Coverage was national, then international. Among property owners, the press, and other elements of society, a consensus developed that suppression of anarchist agitation was necessary while for their part, union organizations such as The Knights of Labor and craft unions were quick to disassociate themselves from the anarchist movement and to repudiate violent tactics as self-defeating.&lt;ref name = "Repercussions" &gt;David, ''The History of the Haymarket Affair'' (1936), pages 178–189&lt;/ref&gt; Many workers, on the other hand, believed that men of the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton agency]] were responsible because of the agency's tactic of secretly infiltrating labor groups and its sometimes violent methods of strike breaking.&lt;ref name=Pinkerton&gt;{{cite book |last=Morn |first=Frank |title=The Eye That Never Sleeps: A History of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency |year=1982 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington, Ind. |isbn=0-253-32086-0 |page=99 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal proceedings==

===Investigation===
[[File:HaymarketMartyrs.jpg|thumb|Engraving of the seven anarchists sentenced to die for Degan's murder. An eighth defendant, Oscar Neebe, not shown here, was sentenced to 15 years in prison.]]
The police assumed that an anarchist had thrown the bomb as part of a planned conspiracy; their problem was how to prove it. On the morning of May 5, they raided the offices of the ''Arbeiter-Zeitung'', arresting its editor August Spies, and his brother (who was not charged). Also arrested were editorial assistant Michael Schwab and Adolph Fischer, a typesetter. A search of the premises resulted in the discovery of the "Revenge Poster" and other evidence considered incriminating by the prosecution.&lt;ref name = "Core" &gt;Schaack, [http://homicide.northwestern.edu/docs_fk/homicide/AAA/Anarchy.10.pdf "Core of the Conspiracy"], ''Anarchy and Anarchists'', pp. 156–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 7, police searched the premises of [[Louis Lingg]] where they found a number of bombs and bomb-making materials.&lt;ref name = "Connection" &gt;Schaack, [http://homicide.northwestern.edu/docs_fk/homicide/AAA/Anarchy.11.pdf "My Connection with the Anarchist Cases"], ''Anarchy and Anarchists'', pp, 183–205.&lt;/ref&gt; Lingg's landlord William Seliger was also arrested but cooperated with police and identified Lingg as a bomb maker and was not charged.&lt;ref name = "Nest" &gt;Messer-Kruse, Timothy (2011) , page 21&lt;/ref&gt;  An associate of Spies, Balthazar Rau, suspected as the bomber, was traced to Omaha and brought back to Chicago. After interrogation, Rau offered to cooperate with police. He alleged that the defendants had experimented with dynamite bombs and accused them of having published what he said was a code word, "Ruhe"  ("peace"), in the ''Arbeiter-Zeitung'' as a call to arms at Haymarket Square.&lt;ref name = "Core" /&gt;

===Defendants===
Rudolf Schnaubelt, the police's lead suspect as the bomb thrower, was arrested twice early on and released. By May 14, when it became apparent he had played a significant role in the event, he had fled the country.&lt;ref name = "Core" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Messer-Kruse 2011, pp. 18–21"&gt;Messer-Kruse (2011), pp. 18–21.&lt;/ref&gt; William Seliger, who had turned state's evidence and testified for the prosecution, was not charged. On June 4, 1886, seven other suspects, however, were indicted by the grand jury and stood trial for being accessories to the murder of Degan.&lt;ref&gt;The Grand Jury returned an indictment against August Spies, Michael Schwab, Samuel Fielden, Albert R. Parsons, Adolph Fischer, George Engel, Louis Lingg, William Seliger, Rudolph Schnaubelt and Oscar Neebe for murder. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Charged with making an unlawful, willful, felonious and with malice aforethought assault on the body of Mathias J. Degan causing him mortal wounds, bruises, lacerations and contusions upon his body.&lt;/blockquote&gt;See [http://www.chicagohistoryresources.org/hadc/transcript/volume1/000-050/1003B-022.htm Grand jury indictments for murder, 1886 June 4.| Chicago Historical Society, Haymarket Affair Digital Collection.]&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, only two had been present when the bomb exploded. Newspaper editor [[August Spies]] and [[Samuel Fielden]] had spoken at the peaceful rally and were stepping down from the speaker's wagon in compliance with police orders to disperse just before the bomb went off. Two others had been present at the beginning of the rally but had left and were at Zepf's Hall, an anarchist rendezvous, at the time of the explosion. They were: ''Arbeiter-Zeitung'' typesetter [[Adolph Fischer]] and the well-known activist [[Albert Parsons]], who had spoken for an hour at the Haymarket rally before going to Zepf's. Parsons, who believed that the evidence against them all was weak, subsequently voluntarily turned himself in, in solidarity with the accused.&lt;ref name = "Core" /&gt; A third man, Spies's assistant editor [[Michael Schwab]] (who was the brother-in-law of Schnaubelt) was arrested since he was speaking at another rally at the time of the bombing (he was also later pardoned). Not directly tied to the Haymarket rally, but arrested because they were notorious for their militant radicalism were [[George Engel]] (who was at home playing cards on that day), and [[Louis Lingg]], the hot-headed bomb maker denounced by his associate, Seliger. Another defendant who had not been present that day was [[Oscar Neebe]], an American-born citizen of German descent who was associated with the ''Arbeiter-Zeitung'' and had attempted to revive it in the aftermath of the Haymarket riot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://famous-trials.com/haymarket/1175-defendants |title=Meet the Haymarket Defendants |publisher=University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law |accessdate=December 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the eight defendants, five – Spies, Fischer, Engel, Lingg and Schwab – were [[Germans|German]]-born immigrants; a sixth, Neebe, was a U.S.-born citizen of German descent. Only the remaining two, Parsons and Fielden, born in the U.S. and England, respectively, were of British heritage.&lt;ref name="Messer-Kruse 2011, pp. 18–21" /&gt;

===Trial===
[[File:The trial of the anarchists in Chicago.jpg|thumb|An artist's sketch of the trial, ''Illinois vs. August Spies et al.'' (1886)]]
The trial, ''Illinois vs. August Spies et al.'', began on June 21, 1886, and went on until August 11. The trial was conducted in an atmosphere of extreme prejudice by both public and media toward the defendants.&lt;ref name = "Prejudice" &gt;Avrich, ''The Haymarket Tragedy'' (1984) pages 260 to 262&lt;/ref&gt; It was presided over by Judge [[Joseph Gary]]. Judge Gary displayed open hostility to the defendants, consistently ruled for the prosecution, and failed to maintain decorum. A motion to try the defendants separately was denied.&lt;ref name = "Rulings" &gt;Avrich, ''The Haymarket Tragedy'' (1984) pages 262 to 267&lt;/ref&gt; The defense counsel included [[Sigmund Zeisler]], [[William P. Black|William Perkins Black]], William Foster, and [[Moses Salomon]]. Selection of the jury was extraordinarily difficult, lasting three weeks, and nearly one thousand people called. All union members and anyone who expressed sympathy toward socialism were dismissed. In the end a jury of 12 was seated, most of whom confessed prejudice towards the defendants. Despite their professions of prejudice Judge Gary seated those who declared that despite their prejudices they would acquit if the evidence supported it, refusing to dismiss for prejudice. Eventually the peremptory challenges of the defense were exhausted. Frustrated by the hundreds of jurors who were being dismissed, a bailiff was appointed who selected jurors rather than calling them at random. The bailiff proved prejudiced himself and selected jurors who seemed likely to convict based on their social position and attitudes toward the defendants.&lt;ref name = "Rulings" /&gt; The prosecution, led by Julius Grinnell, argued that since the defendants had not actively discouraged the person who had thrown the bomb, they were therefore equally responsible as conspirators.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, ''The Haymarket Tragedy'', pp. 271–272.&lt;/ref&gt; The jury heard the testimony of 118 people, including 54 members of the Chicago Police Department and the defendants Fielden, Schwab, Spies and Parsons. Albert Parsons' brother claimed there was evidence linking the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkertons]] to the bomb. This reflected a widespread belief among the strikers.&lt;ref name=Pinkerton/&gt;

[[File:Lingg bomb.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A unexploded dynamite bomb with fuse.|Exhibit 129a from the Haymarket trial: Chemists testified that the bombs found in Lingg's apartment, including this one, resembled the chemical signature of shrapnel from the Haymarket bomb.]]
Police investigators under Captain Michael Schaack had a lead fragment removed from a policeman's wounds chemically analyzed. They reported that the lead used in the casing matched the casings of bombs found in Lingg's home.&lt;ref name=LaborBomb /&gt; A metal nut and fragments of the casing taken from the wound also roughly matched bombs made by Lingg.&lt;ref name = "Core" /&gt; Schaack concluded, on the basis of interviews, that the anarchists had been experimenting for years with dynamite and other explosives, refining the design of their bombs before coming up with the effective one used at the Haymarket.&lt;ref name = "Core" /&gt;

At the last minute, when it was discovered that instructions for manslaughter had not been included in the submitted instructions, the jury was called back, and the instructions were given.&lt;ref&gt;Messer-Kruse (2011). pp. 123–128&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verdict and contemporary reactions===
The jury returned guilty verdicts for all eight defendants. Before being sentenced, Neebe told the court that Schaack's officers were among the city's worst gangs, ransacking houses and stealing money and watches. Schaack laughed and Neebe retorted, "You need not laugh about it, Captain Schaack. You are one of them. You are an anarchist, as you understand it. You are all anarchists, in this sense of the word, I must say."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Loerzel, ''Alchemy of Bones: Chicago's Luetgert Murder Case of 1897'' (University of Illinois Press; 2003), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Gary sentenced seven of the defendants to death by hanging and Neebe to 15 years in prison. The sentencing provoked outrage from labor and workers' movements and their supporters, resulting in protests around the world, and elevating the defendants to the status of martyrs, especially abroad. Portrayals of the anarchists as bloodthirsty foreign fanatics in the press along with the 1889 publication of Captain Schaack's sensational account, ''Anarchy and Anarchism,'' on the other hand, inspired widespread public fear and revulsion against the strikers and general anti-immigrant feeling, polarizing public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagohistoryresources.org/dramas/act3/courtOfPublicOpinion/courtOfPublicOpinion_f.htm |title=Act III: Toils of the Law, Court of Public Opinion |accessdate=December 30, 2017 |year=2000 |work=The Dramas of Haymarket |publisher=Chicago Historical Society |quote=From the time of the arrests following the riot to the hangings, the men held responsible for the bombing found the celebrity that they had been so eagerly seeking, if hardly on the terms they desired. ... In almost all instances, the accused achieved notoriety rather than fame, though reporters frequently remarked on their bravery in the face of the awesome fate awaiting them, and on their devotion to their families. Even these stories, however, emphasized their fanaticism and wrong-headed dedication to a dangerous and selfish cause that only hurt the ones they supposedly loved.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article datelined May 4, entitled "Anarchy's Red Hand", ''[[The New York Times]]'' had described the incident as the "bloody fruit" of "the villainous teachings of the Anarchists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Anarchy's Red Hand: Rioting and Bloodshed in the Streets of Chicago |url=http://famous-trials.com/haymarket/1191-redhand5-6 |work=The New York Times |date=May 6, 1886 |accessdate=December 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'',  May [4] 6, 1886, quoted in Avrich, ''The Haymarket Tragedy'', p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Chicago Times'' described the defendants as "arch counselors of riot, pillage, incendiarism and murder"; other reporters described them as "bloody brutes", "red ruffians", "dynamarchists", "bloody monsters", "cowards", "cutthroats", "thieves", "assassins", and "fiends".&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, ''The Haymarket Tragedy'', p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; The journalist George Frederic Parsons wrote a piece for ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' in which he identified the fears of middle-class Americans concerning labor radicalism, and asserted that the workers had only themselves to blame for their troubles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parsons |first=George Frederic |date=July 1886 |title=The Labor Question |journal=[[The Atlantic Monthly]] |volume=58 |pages=97–113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Aveling]] remarked, "If these men are ultimately hanged, it will be the ''Chicago Tribune'' that has done it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagohistoryresources.org/dramas/act3/act3.htm |title=Act III: Toils of the Law |accessdate=December 30, 2017 |year=2000 |work=The Dramas of Haymarket |publisher=Chicago Historical Society }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schaack, who had led the investigation, was dismissed from the police force for allegedly having fabricated evidence in the case but was reinstated in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Loertzel, ''Alchemy of Bones'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appeals===
The case was appealed in 1887 to the [[Supreme Court of Illinois]],&lt;ref&gt;122 Ill. 1 (1887).&lt;/ref&gt; then to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] where the defendants were represented by [[John Randolph Tucker (1823-1897)|John Randolph Tucker]], [[Roger Atkinson Pryor]], General [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin F. Butler]] and [[William P. Black]]. The petition for ''[[certiorari]]'' was denied.&lt;ref&gt;123 U.S. 131 (1887).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commutations and suicide===
After the appeals had been exhausted, Illinois Governor [[Richard James Oglesby]] commuted Fielden's and Schwab's sentences to life in prison on November 10, 1887. On the eve of his scheduled execution, Lingg committed suicide in his cell with a smuggled [[blasting cap]] which he reportedly held in his mouth like a cigar (the blast blew off half his face and he survived in agony for six hours).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lingg's Fearful Death |work=Chicago Tribune |page=1 |date=November 11, 1887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Executions===
[[File:Chicagi 1887.jpg|thumb|right|Execution of defendants—Engel, Fischer, Parsons, and Spies]]
The next day (November 11, 1887) four defendants—Engel, Fischer, Parsons, and Spies—were taken to the gallows in white robes and hoods. They sang the ''[[La Marseillaise|Marseillaise]]'', then the anthem of the international revolutionary movement. Family members including [[Lucy Parsons]], who attempted to see them for the last time, were arrested and searched for bombs (none were found). According to witnesses, in the moments before the men were [[hanged]], Spies shouted, "The time will come when our silence will be more powerful than the voices you strangle today."&lt;ref name=Avrich393&gt;Avrich, ''The Haymarket Tragedy'', p. 393.&lt;/ref&gt; In their last words, Engel and Fischer called out, "Hurrah for anarchism!" Parsons then requested to speak, but he was cut off when the signal was given to open the trap door. Witnesses reported that the condemned men did not die immediately when they dropped, but strangled to death slowly, a sight which left the spectators visibly shaken.&lt;ref name=Avrich393/&gt;

===Identity of the bomber===
Notwithstanding the convictions for conspiracy, no actual bomber was ever brought to trial, "and no lawyerly explanation could ever make a conspiracy trial without the main perpetrator in the conspiracy seem completely legitimate."&lt;ref&gt;Messer-Kruse (2011). p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians such as [[James Joll]] and [[Timothy Messer-Kruse]] say the evidence points to Rudolph Schnaubelt, brother-in-law of Schwab, as the likely perpetrator.&lt;ref&gt;John J.

==Pardon and historical characterization==
[[File:Altgeld.JPG|thumb|Altgeld Monument (by [[Gutzon Borglum|Borglum]]) erected by the Illinois Legislature in [[Lincoln Park]], Chicago (1915)]]
Among supporters of the labor movement in the United States and abroad and others, the trial was widely believed to have been unfair, and even a serious [[miscarriage of justice]]. Prominent people such as novelist [[William Dean Howells]]; celebrated attorney [[Clarence Darrow]];&lt;ref&gt;John A. Farrell, ''Clarence Darrow: Attorney for the Damned'' (New York: Doubleday, 2011), p. 5 and passim.&lt;/ref&gt; poet and playwright [[Oscar Wilde]]; playwright [[George Bernard Shaw]]; and poet [[William Morris]], strongly condemned it. On June 26, 1893, Illinois Governor [[John Peter Altgeld]], the progressive governor of Illinois, himself a German immigrant, signed pardons for Fielden, Neebe, and Schwab,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= |first= |date=June 27, 1893 |title=Anarchists Pardoned |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19766055/3_men_pardoned_for_haymarket_bombing/ |newspaper=Port Huron Daily Times |location=Port Huron, Michigan |page=1 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate=May 4, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627173145/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19766055/3_men_pardoned_for_haymarket_bombing/ |archivedate=June 27, 2018 |deadurl=no }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; calling them victims of "hysteria, packed juries, and a biased judge" and noting that the state "has never discovered who it was that threw the bomb which killed the policeman, and the evidence does not show any connection whatsoever between the defendants and the man who threw it".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Stanley Turkel, ''Heroes of the American Reconstruction: Profiles of Sixteen Educators'' (McFarland, 2009) p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Altgeld also faulted the city of Chicago for failing to hold Pinkerton guards responsible for repeated use of lethal violence against striking workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morn |title=The Eye That Never Sleeps |page=99 |isbn=0-253-32086-0 }} On April 9, 1885, Pinkertons shot and killed an elderly man at the McCormick Harvester Company Works in Chicago. On October 19, 1886, they shot and killed a man in Chicago's packinghouse district. [[Labor spies#A historical overview|More info]].&lt;/ref&gt; Altgeld's actions concerning labor were used to defeat his reelection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagohistoryresources.org/dramas/act5/absolutePardon/theFriendOfMadDogs_f.htm ''ACT V Raising the dead: Absolute Pardon,''] Chicago Historical Society (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.org/cms/home/governors/past-governors-bios/page_illinois/col2-content/main-content-list/title_altgeld_john.html ''Illinois Governor John Peter Altgeld''] National Governors Association (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/tu_debs_bio_altgeld.html ''The Debs Case: Labor, Capital, and the Federal Courts of the 1890s, Biographies, John Peter Altgeld'']  Federal Judicial Center.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the trial, anarchist [[Dyer Lum]] wrote a history of the trial critical of the prosecution.  In 1888, George McLean, and in 1889, police captain Michael Shack, wrote accounts from the opposite perspective.&lt;ref name="Teaford"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Good Read, Old Story –  Death in the Haymarket: A Story of Chicago, the First Labor Movement and the Bombing that Divided Gilded Age America by James Green | author=Teaford, Jon C. | journal=Reviews in American History | year=2006 | volume=34 | pages=350–354 | jstor=30031536}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Awaiting sentencing, each of the defendants wrote their own autobiographies (edited and published by [[Philip Foner]] in 1969), and later activist [[Lucy Parsons]] published a biography of her condemned husband [[Albert Parsons]].  Fifty years after the event, Henry Davis wrote a history, which preceded another scholarly treatment by [[Paul Avrich]] in 1984, and a "social history" of the era by Bruce C. Nelson in 1988. In 2006, labor historian [[James Green (educator)|James Green]] wrote a popular history.&lt;ref name="Teaford" /&gt;

Christopher Thale writes in the ''[[Encyclopedia of Chicago]]'' that lacking credible evidence regarding the bombing, "...the prosecution focused on the writings and speeches of the defendants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thale|first=Christopher|title=Haymarket and May Day|url=http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/571.html|work=Encyclopedia of Chicago|publisher=Chicago History Museum, Newberry Library and Northwestern University|accessdate=April 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He further notes that the conspiracy charge was legally unprecedented, the Judge was "partisan," and all the jurors admitted prejudice against the defendants. Historian Carl Smith writes, "The visceral feelings of fear and anger surrounding the trial ruled out anything but the pretense of justice right from the outset."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Carl|title=Act III: Toils of the Law|url=http://www.chicagohistoryresources.org/dramas/act3/act3.htm|work=The Dramas of Haymarket|publisher=Chicago Historical Society and Northwestern University|accessdate=December 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith notes that scholars have long considered the trial a "notorious" "miscarriage of justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Carl|title=Introduction|url=http://www.chicagohistoryresources.org/dramas/overview/main.htm|work=The Dramas of Haymarket|publisher=Chicago Historical Society and Northwestern University|accessdate=December 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a review somewhat more critical of the defendants, historian Jon Teaford concludes that "[t]he tragedy of Haymarket is the American justice system did not protect the damn fools who most needed that protection... It is the damn fools who talk too much and too wildly who are most in need of protection from the state."&lt;ref name="Teaford" /&gt; Historian [[Timothy Messer-Kruse]] revisited the digitized trial transcript and argued that the proceedings were fair for their time, a challenge to the historical consensus that the trial was a travesty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Mann |first1=Leslie |title=Reworking infamous Haymarket trial |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=2011-09-14 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-09-14/entertainment/ct-ent-0915-museum-general-haymarket-20110915_1_separate-trials-haymarket-square-haymarket-incident |accessdate=2017-11-01 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 20th century, scholars doing research into the Haymarket affair were surprised to learn that much of the primary source documentation relating to the incident (beside materials concerning the trial) was not in Chicago, but had been transferred to then-communist [[East Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Foner, ''The Autobiographies of the Haymarket Martyrs'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on the labor movement and May Day==
Historian Nathan Fine points out that trade-union activities continued to show signs of growth and vitality, culminating later in 1886 with the establishment of the Labor Party of Chicago.&lt;ref name=Fine53&gt;Nathan Fine, ''Labor and Farmer Parties in the United States, 1828–1928.'' New York: Rand School of Social Science, 1928; pg. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fine observes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[T]he fact is that despite police repression, newspaper incitement to hysteria, and organization of the possessing classes, which followed the throwing of the bomb on May 4, the Chicago wage earners only united their forces and stiffened their resistance. The conservative and radical central bodies – there were two each of the trade unions and two also of the Knights of Labor — the socialists and the anarchists, the [[single tax]]ers and the reformers, the native born...and the foreign born Germans, Bohemians, and Scandinavians, all got together for the first time on the political field in the summer following the Haymarket affair.... [T]he Knights of Labor doubled its membership, reaching 40,000 in the fall of 1886. On Labor Day the number of Chicago workers in parade led the country.&lt;ref name=Fine53 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the first anniversary of the event, May 4, 1887, the ''[[New-York Tribune]]'' published an interview with Senator [[Leland Stanford]], in which he addressed the consensus that "the conflict between capital and labor is intensifying" and articulated the vision advocated by the [[Knights of Labor]] for an industrial system of [[Worker cooperative|worker-owned co-operatives]], another among the strategies pursued to advance the conditions of laborers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1887-05-04/ed-1/seq-3/ |title=Co-operation of Labor.

Reasons why the Laboring Man Should Be His Own Employer—Delusive Theories About the Distribution of Wealth |work=[[New-York Tribune]] |date=May 4, 1887 |accessdate=May 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The interview was republished as a pamphlet to include the [[Bill (law)|bill]] Stanford introduced in the Senate to foster co-operatives.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford, Leland, 1887. Co-operation of Labor. Special Collection 33a, Box 7, Folder 74, [[Stanford University]] Archives. [http://dynamics.org/Altenberg/PAPERS/BCLSFV/REFS/Stanford_Cooperation_of_labor.1887.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular pressure continued for the establishment of the 8-hour day. At the convention of the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL) in 1888, the union decided to campaign for the shorter workday again. May 1, 1890, was agreed upon as the date on which workers would strike for an eight-hour work day.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, ''May Day'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ChicagoAnarchists.jpg|thumb|left|This sympathetic engraving by English [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts]] illustrator [[Walter Crane]] of "The Anarchists of Chicago" was widely circulated among anarchists, socialists, and labor activists.]]
In 1889, AFL president [[Samuel Gompers]] wrote to the first congress of the [[Second International]], which was meeting in Paris. He informed the world's socialists of the AFL's plans and proposed an international fight for a universal eight-hour work day.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, ''May Day'', p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Gompers's letter, the Second International adopted a resolution calling for "a great international demonstration" on a single date so workers everywhere could demand the eight-hour work day. In light of the Americans' plan, the International adopted May 1, 1890, as the date for this demonstration.&lt;ref name=Foner42&gt;Foner, ''May Day'', p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

A secondary purpose behind the adoption of the resolution by the Second International was to honor the memory of the Haymarket martyrs and other workers who had been killed in association with the strikes on May 1, 1886. Historian [[Philip Foner]] writes "[t]here is little doubt that everyone associated with the resolution passed by the Paris Congress knew of the May 1 demonstrations and strikes for the eight-hour day in 1886 in the United States ... and the events associated with the Haymarket tragedy."&lt;ref name=Foner42/&gt;

The first [[International Workers Day]] was a spectacular success. The front page of the ''[[New York World]]'' on May 2, 1890, was devoted to coverage of the event. Two of its headlines were "Parade of Jubilant Workingmen in All the Trade Centers of the Civilized World" and "Everywhere the Workmen Join in Demands for a Normal Day".&lt;ref&gt;Foner, ''May Day'', p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' of London listed two dozen European cities in which demonstrations had taken place, noting there had been rallies in Cuba, Peru and Chile.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, ''May Day'', pp. 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Commemoration of May Day became an annual event the following year.

The association of May Day with the Haymarket martyrs has remained strong in [[Mexico]]. [[Mary Harris Jones|Mary Harris "Mother" Jones]] was in Mexico on May 1, 1921, and wrote of the "day of 'fiestas'" that marked "the killing of the workers in Chicago for demanding the eight-hour day".&lt;ref&gt;Roediger, Dave, "Mother Jones &amp; Haymarket", in Roediger and Rosemont, eds., ''Haymarket Scrapbook'', p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, ''[[The New York Times]]'' referred to the May Day parade in [[Mexico City]] as "the annual demonstration glorifying the memory of those who were killed in Chicago in 1887".&lt;ref&gt;Foner, ''May Day'', p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' described the 1936 demonstration as a commemoration of "the death of the martyrs in Chicago".&lt;ref&gt;Foner, ''May Day'', p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, Oscar Neebe's grandson attended the May Day parade in Mexico City and was shown, as his host told him, "how the world shows respect to your grandfather".&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, ''The Haymarket Tragedy'', p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the Haymarket affair was not limited to the celebration of May Day. [[Emma Goldman]], the activist and political theorist, was attracted to anarchism after reading about the incident and the executions, which she later described as "the events that had inspired my spiritual birth and growth". She considered the Haymarket martyrs to be "the most decisive influence in my existence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldman |first=Emma |authorlink=Emma Goldman |title=[[Living My Life]] |origyear=1931 |year=1970 |publisher=Dover Publications |location=New York |isbn=0-486-22543-7 |pages=7–10, 508 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her associate, [[Alexander Berkman]] also described the Haymarket anarchists as "a potent and vital inspiration".&lt;ref name=Avrich434&gt;Avrich, ''The Haymarket Tragedy'', p. 434.&lt;/ref&gt; Others whose commitment to anarchism, or revolutionary socialism, crystallized as a result of the Haymarket affair included [[Voltairine de Cleyre]] and [[Bill Haywood|"Big Bill" Haywood]], a founding member of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]].&lt;ref name=Avrich434/&gt; Goldman wrote to historian [[Max Nettlau]] that the Haymarket affair had awakened the social consciousness of "hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people".&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, ''The Haymarket Tragedy'', pp. 433–434.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suspected bombers==

While admitting that none of the defendants were involved in the bombing, the prosecution made the argument that Lingg had built the bomb, and two prosecution witnesses (Harry Gilmer and Malvern Thompson) tried to imply that the bomb thrower was helped by Spies, Fischer and Schwab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagohistoryresources.org/hadc/transcript/volumek/401-450/K405-497.htm |title=Testimony of Harry L. Gilmer, Illinois vs. August Spies et al. |accessdate=December 30, 2017 |last=Gilmer |first=Harry L. |date=July 28, 1886 |work=Haymarket Affair Digital Collection |publisher=Chicago Historical Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagohistoryresources.org/hadc/transcript/volumek/301-350/K312-361.htm |title=Testimony of Malvern M. Thompson, Illinois vs. August Spies et al. |accessdate=December 30, 2017 |last=Thompson |first=Malvern M.  |date=July 27, 1886 |work=Haymarket Affair Digital Collection |publisher=Chicago Historical Society }}&lt;/ref&gt; The defendants claimed they had no knowledge of the bomber at all.

Several activists, including [[Dyer Lum]] (a close associate of the defendants who wrote an account of the case in 1891), Voltairine de Cleyre and Robert Reitzel, later hinted they knew who the bomber was.&lt;ref&gt;After the hangings, Reitzel reportedly told Dr. Urban Hartung, another anarchist, "The bomb-thrower is known, but let us forget about it; even if he had confessed, the lives of our comrades could not have been saved." Letter from Carl Nold to [[Agnes Inglis]], January 12, 1933, quoted in Avrich, ''The Haymarket Tragedy'', p. 442.&lt;/ref&gt; Writers and other commentators have speculated about many possible suspects:

[[File:Schnaubelt.jpg|thumb|upright|Rudolph Schnaubelt was indicted but fled the country. From this photograph, a prosecution witness identified Schnaubelt as the bomber.]]
* '''Rudolph Schnaubelt''' (1863–1901) was an activist and the brother-in law of Michael Schwab. He was at the Haymarket when the bomb exploded. Schnaubelt was indicted with the other defendants but fled the city and later the country before he could be brought to trial. He was the detectives' lead suspect, and state witness Gilmer testified he saw Schnaubelt throw the bomb, identifying him from a photograph in court.&lt;ref&gt;Messer-Kruse, ''The Trial of the Haymarket Anarchists'', p. 74. Avrich also suggests the bomber might have been a shoemaker named George Schwab (no relation to hanged defendant Michael Schwab). Anarchist George Meng, has recently also been mentioned [http://www.chicagohistoryresources.org/dramas/epilogue/aCenturyAndCounting/whoThrewTheBomb_f.htm "Who Threw the Bomb", ''The Dramas of the Haymarket'', Chicago Historical Society and Northwestern University website].&lt;/ref&gt; Schnaubelt later sent two letters from London disclaiming all responsibility, writing, "If I had really thrown this bomb, surely I would have nothing to be ashamed of, but in  truth I never once thought of it."&lt;ref&gt;Messer-Kruse, ''The Trial of the Haymarket Anarchists'', p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; He is the most generally accepted and widely known suspect and figured as the bomb thrower in ''The Bomb'', [[Frank Harris]]'s 1908 fictionalization of the tragedy. Written from Schnaubelt's point of view, the story opens with him confessing on his deathbed. However, Harris's description was fictional and those who knew Schnaubelt vehemently criticized the book.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucy Parsons]] stated that Harris's book "was a lie from cover to cover". Letter from Lucy Parsons to Carl Nold, January 17, 1933, quoted in David, ''The History of the Haymarket Affair'', p. 435.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''George Schwab''' was a German shoemaker who died in 1924. German anarchist Carl Nold claimed he learned Schwab was the bomber through correspondence with other activists but no proof ever emerged. Historian [[Paul Avrich]] also suspected him but noted that while Schwab was in Chicago, he had only arrived days before. This contradicted statements by others that the bomber was a well-known figure in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;David, ''The History of the Haymarket Affair'', p. 428.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, ''The Haymarket Tragedy'', pp. 444–45.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''George Meng''' (b. around 1840) was a German anarchist and teamster who owned a small farm outside of Chicago where he had settled in 1883 after emigrating from [[Bavaria]]. Like Parsons and Spies, he was a delegate at the Pittsburgh Congress and a member of the IWPA. Meng's granddaughter, Adah Maurer, wrote Paul Avrich a letter in which she said that her mother, who was 15 at the time of the bombing, told her that her father was the bomber. Meng died sometime before 1907 in a saloon fire. Based on his correspondence with Maurer, Avrich concluded that there was a "strong possibility" that the little-known Meng may have been the bomber.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul, "The Bomb-Thrower: A New Candidate", in Roediger and Rosemont, eds., ''Haymarket Scrapbook'', pp. 71–73.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''An [[agent provocateur]]''' was suggested by some members of the anarchist movement. Albert Parsons believed the bomber was a member of the police or the Pinkertons trying to undermine the labor movement. However, this contradicts the statements of several activists who said the bomber was one of their own. Lucy Parsons and [[Johann Most]] rejected this notion. Dyer Lum said it was "puerile" to ascribe "the Haymarket bomb to a Pinkerton".&lt;ref&gt;[[Dyer Lum]], quoted in David, ''The History of the Haymarket Affair'', pp. 426–427.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''A disgruntled worker''' was widely suspected. When Adolph Fischer was asked if he knew who threw the bomb, he answered, "I suppose it was some excited workingman." Oscar Neebe said it was a "crank".&lt;ref&gt;David, ''The History of the Haymarket Affair'', pp. 430–431.&lt;/ref&gt; Governor Altgeld speculated the bomb thrower might have been a disgruntled worker who was not associated with the defendants or the anarchist movement but had a personal grudge against the police. In his pardoning statement, Altgeld said the record of police brutality towards the workers had invited revenge adding, "Capt. Bonfield is the man who is really responsible for the deaths of the police officers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagohistoryresources.org/hadc/books/b06/B06.htm |title=Reasons for Pardoning Fielden, Neebe and Schwab |accessdate=December 30, 2017 |last=Altgeld |first=John P. |authorlink=John Peter Altgeld |date=June 26, 1893 |work=Haymarket Affair Digital Collection |publisher=Chicago Historical Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Klemana Schuetz''' was identified as the bomber by Franz Mayhoff, a New York anarchist and fraudster, who claimed in an affidavit that Schuetz had once admitted throwing the Haymarket bomb. August Wagener, Mayhoff's attorney, sent a telegram from New York to defense attorney Captain William Black the day before the executions claiming knowledge of the bomber's identity. Black tried to delay the execution with this telegram but Governor Oglesby refused. It was later learned that Schuetz was the primary witness against Mayhoff at his trial for insurance fraud, so Mayhoff's affidavit has never been regarded as credible by historians.&lt;ref&gt;David, ''The History of the Haymarket Affair'', pp. 428–429.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Thomas Owen''' was a carpenter from [[Pennsylvania]]. Severely injured in an accident a week before the executions, Owen reportedly confessed to the bombing on his deathbed by saying, "I was at the Haymarket riot and am an anarchist and say that I threw a bomb in that riot." He was an anarchist and apparently had been in Chicago at the time but other accounts note that long before his accident he had said he was at the Haymarket and saw the bomb thrower. Owen may have been trying to save the condemned men.&lt;ref&gt;David, ''The History of the Haymarket Affair'', p. 430.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Reinold "Big" Krueger''' was killed by police either in the melee after the bombing or in a separate disturbance the next day and has been named as a suspect but there is no supporting evidence.&lt;ref&gt;David, ''The History of the Haymarket Affair'', p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, ''The Haymarket Tragedy'', pp. 444.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''A mysterious outsider''' was reported by John Philip Deluse, a saloon keeper in [[Indianapolis]] who claimed he encountered a stranger in his saloon the day before the bombing. The man was carrying a satchel and on his way from New York to Chicago. According to Deluse, the stranger was interested in the labor situation in Chicago, repeatedly pointed to his satchel and said, "You will hear of some trouble there very soon."&lt;ref&gt;David, ''The History of the Haymarket Affair'', pp. 429–430.&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons used Deluse's testimony to suggest the bomb thrower was sent by eastern capitalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Parsons |first=Albert R. |authorlink=Albert Parsons |title=The Accused, The Accusers: The Famous Speeches of the Eight Chicago Anarchists in Court |year=1886  |url=http://www.chicagohistoryresources.org/hadc/books/b01/B01.htm |accessdate=December 30, 2017 |edition= |publisher=Chicago Historical Society |chapter=Address of Albert R.

{{main|Haymarket Martyrs' Monument}}
Lingg, Spies, Fischer, Engel, and Parsons were buried at the [[German Waldheim Cemetery]] (later merged with Forest Home Cemetery) in [[Forest Park, Illinois]], a suburb of Chicago. Schwab and Neebe were also buried at Waldheim when they died, reuniting the "Martyrs". In 1893, the ''[[Haymarket Martyrs' Monument]]'' by sculptor [[Albert Weinert]] was raised at Waldheim. Over a century later, it was designated a [[National Register of Historic Places|National Historic Landmark]] by the [[United States Department of the Interior]].

Throughout the 20th century, activists such as [[Emma Goldman]] chose to be buried near the ''Haymarket Martyrs' Monument'' graves.

In October 2016, a time capsule with materials relating to the Haymarket Affair was dug up in Waldheim Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forestparkreview.com/News/Articles/10-4-2016/Haymarket-time-capsule-uncovered,-still-unopened/|title=Haymarket time capsule uncovered, still unopened|website=www.forestparkreview.com|accessdate=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1889, a commemorative nine-foot (2.7 meter) bronze statue of a Chicago policeman by sculptor [[Johannes Gelert]] was erected in the middle of Haymarket Square with private funds raised by the [[Union League Club of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, ''Haymarket Revisited'', pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; The statue was unveiled on May 30, 1889, by Frank Degan, the son of Officer Mathias Degan.&lt;ref name="CPDweblog"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpdweblog.typepad.com/chicago_police_department/2007/05/haymarket_statu.html |title=Haymarket Statue Rededication Ceremony at Police Headquarters |accessdate=January 23, 2008 |date=May 31, 2007 |work=Chicago Police Department weblog |publisher=Chicago Police Department |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071218051754/http://cpdweblog.typepad.com/chicago_police_department/2007/05/haymarket_statu.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = December 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 4, 1927, the 41st anniversary of the Haymarket affair, a [[Tram|streetcar]] jumped its tracks and crashed into the monument.&lt;ref name=AdelmanTrueStory&gt;Adelman, William J., "The True Story Behind the Haymarket Police Statue", in Roediger and Rosemont, eds., ''Haymarket Scrapbook'', pp. 167–168.&lt;/ref&gt;  The motorman said he was "sick of seeing that policeman with his arm raised".&lt;ref name=AdelmanTrueStory/&gt; The city restored the statue in 1928 and moved it to Union Park.&lt;ref name=Adelman39&gt;Adelman, ''Haymarket Revisited'', p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950s, construction of the [[Kennedy Expressway]] erased about half of the old, run-down market square, and in 1956, the statue was moved to a special platform built for it overlooking the freeway, near its original location.&lt;ref name=Adelman39/&gt;

[[File:MichaelKin-Chicago1986.jpg|thumb|The statue-less pedestal of the police monument on the 100th anniversary of the Haymarket affair in May 1986; the pedestal has since been removed.]]
The Haymarket statue was vandalized with black paint on May 4, 1968, the 82nd anniversary of the Haymarket affair, following a confrontation between police and demonstrators at a protest against the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=Adelman40&gt;Adelman, ''Haymarket Revisited'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 6, 1969, shortly before the "[[Days of Rage]]" protests, the statue was destroyed when a bomb was placed between its legs.

"Struggles at Haymarket: An Embattled History of Static Monuments and Public Interventions," 261&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, it was moved to the lobby of the Central Police Headquarters, and in 1976 to the enclosed courtyard of the Chicago police academy.&lt;ref name=Adelman40/&gt; For another three decades the statue's empty, graffiti-marked [[pedestal]] stood on its platform in the run-down remains of Haymarket Square where it was known as an [[anarchist]] landmark.&lt;ref name=Adelman40/&gt; On June 1, 2007, the statue was rededicated at Chicago Police Headquarters with a new pedestal, unveiled by Geraldine Doceka, Officer Mathias Degan's great-granddaughter.&lt;ref name="CPDweblog"/&gt;

In 1992, the site of the speakers' wagon was marked by a bronze plaque set into the sidewalk, reading:

{{quote|
A decade of strife between labor and industry culminated here in a confrontation that resulted in the tragic death of both workers and policemen. On May 4, 1886, spectators at a labor rally had gathered around the mouth of Crane's Alley. A contingent of police approaching on Des Plaines Street were met by a bomb thrown from just south of the alley. The resultant trial of eight activists gained worldwide attention for the labor movement, and initiated the tradition of "May Day" labor rallies in many cities.

Designated on March 25, 1992

On September 14, 2004, Daley and union leaders—including the president of Chicago's police union—unveiled a monument by Chicago artist Mary Brogger, a fifteen-foot (4.5 m) speakers' wagon sculpture echoing the wagon on which the labor leaders stood in Haymarket Square to champion the eight-hour day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kinzer |first=Stephen |title=In Chicago, an Ambiguous Memorial to the Haymarket Attack |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/15/national/15memorial.html |work=New York Times |date=September 15, 2004 |accessdate=January 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bronze sculpture, intended to be the centerpiece of a proposed "Labor Park", is meant to symbolize both the rally at Haymarket and [[free speech]]. The planned site was to include an international commemoration wall, sidewalk plaques, a cultural pylon, a seating area, and banners, but construction has not yet begun.

Many '''highway revolts''' (also '''freeway revolts''', '''expressway revolts''', or '''road protests''') took place in [[Developed country|developed countries]] during the 1960s and 1970s, in response to plans for the construction of new freeways, a significant number of which were abandoned or significantly scaled back due to widespread public opposition, especially of those whose neighborhoods would be disrupted or displaced by the proposed freeways, and due to [[Freeway#Environmental effects|various other negative effects]] that freeways are considered to have.

==Australia==
While anti-freeway activism in Australia has not been as vocal as in North America, small-scale revolts against freeway construction have occurred in Sydney and Melbourne, with many protesting toll collection.

===Melbourne===
[[Melbourne]] saw protests against the [[1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan]], mostly by those in the impacted inner-city areas.

In 1974, 150 residents protesting plans for the F-19 freeway through [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]]&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1300&amp;dat=19740429&amp;id=oxAQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wpADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7021,6757387&lt;/ref&gt; put themselves in front of construction equipment in an attempt to halt construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.picturevictoria.vic.gov.au/site/yarra_melbourne/Collingwood/9146.html|title=Collingwood:1970s. Anti-freeway protest|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1978, protesters rallied to defend [[Gardiners Creek]] in [[Kooyong, Victoria|Kooyong]], which was in the path of the [[Monash Freeway#South Eastern Freeway|South Eastern Freeway]].  In 1984, over 100 protesters rallied against the widening of Punt Road to become the [[Hoddle Highway]].

Many of the unbuilt freeways were eventually cancelled by change of government, but some projects were later resurrected.  An umbrella organisation known as the Coalition Against Freeway Expansion (CAFE) was formed in 1994, and in the following year, 14 of its activists were arrested whilst protesting an [[Eastern Freeway, Melbourne|Eastern Freeway]] extension and the partial demolition of Alexandra Parade.  The aggressive police response was criticised, and led to the eventual disbandment of the group. One of the largest protests occurred in 2008 in [[Kensington, Victoria|Kensington]], one of the areas most impacted by the proposed  [[East-West road connection]]; it drew wider support due to opposition to the [[Eddington Transport Report, Victoria|Eddington Transport Report]].

===Sydney===
[[Sydney]] freeway protests have included large-scale [[green ban]]s in the 1970s, which prevented freeway proposals that would have required the demolition of [[The Rocks, New South Wales|The Rocks]] historic precinct and The Domain gardens for freeway developments.

In 1989, 200 protesters rallied against a proposed north-west tollway. In 1991, 150 anti-freeway protesters rallied outside Parliament House. In 1995, over 400 people protested the [[M2 Hills Motorway]].

===Hobart===
[[Tasmanian Aborigines|Tasmanian Aboriginals]] have conducted protests against the construction of the [[Brighton Bypass]]. They have stated that construction of the bypass will suffer the loss of their heritage.

==Canada==

===Halifax===
In [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] the construction of an elevated waterfront freeway, Harbour Drive, was halted in the 1970s after local opposition to the proposed destruction of many historic buildings. All that remains of the project today is the [[Cogswell Interchange]], a massive concrete structure widely considered a barrier between sections of the city.&lt;ref name=globe2013&gt;{{cite news|last1=Patten|first1=Melanie|title=Demise of Halifax’s ‘Road to Nowhere’ could lead to core renewal|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/demise-of-halifaxs-road-to-nowhere-could-lead-to-core-renewal/article11727975/|accessdate=10 October 2014|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its demolition is currently planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Omand|first1=Geordon|title=Halifax inches closer to demolition of Cogswell Interchange|url=http://www.metronews.ca/news/halifax/2014/02/12/halifax-inches-closer-to-demolition-of-cogswell-interchange.html|work=Metro Halifax|date=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Montreal===
Several areas were destroyed to make room for highways in the 1960s and 1970s. At that time, a historical preservation movement involving figures such as [[Sandy van Ginkel]] and [[Phyllis Lambert]] prevented a project to run the [[Quebec Autoroute 720|Ville-Marie Expressway]] along the waterfront of the [[Old Port]], which would have demolished much of the then-unloved [[Old Montreal]] and cut the city off from the river.&lt;ref name="G&amp;M"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/sandy-van-ginkel-rescued-old-montreal-from-freeway-developers/article1229337/|title=Sandy van Ginkel rescued Old Montreal from freeway developers|last=Martin|first=Sandra|date=July 23, 2009|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many historic homes were demolished to make way for the western section of the autoroute, but the eastern section was reconceived as a tunnel skirting the southern edge of the downtown core and a sunken expressway along the inland edge of the old city. Since then, Old Montreal has undergone significant rehabilitation and is now a desirable residential and commercial district and the city's leading tourist area. Part of the sunken expressway has been covered over (see [[Quartier international de Montréal]]) and the section immediately north of [[Montreal City Hall]] is also slated to be covered.&lt;ref name="montrealroads"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montrealroads.com/roads/A-720/|title=Ville Marie Autoroute (A-720)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another cancelled project would have seen Rue Berri converted into a north-south expressway, demolishing much of the [[Plateau Mont-Royal]] district. Only the portion south of Rue Cherrier was built.

In recent years, protests took place regarding a proposal to extend the Ville-Marie in the axis of Rue Notre-Dame Est, as an 8-lane entrenched highway that would separate the residential neighborhood of [[Hochelaga-Maisonneuve]] from the St. Lawrence River. The current plan is to widen the current 4-lane road into a six-lane "urban boulevard" rather than converting it into a full-scale expressway.&lt;ref name="montrealroads" /&gt;

Some large road projects from the heyday of the automobile have since been removed at public demand. One of the most prominent was a large interchange at the corner of Avenue du Parc and Avenue des Pins, which had long impeded pedestrian access along a major entryway into [[Mount Royal Park]]. The elevated structure was demolished in the early 2000s and replaced with a simpler, at-grade intersection. Another current project aims to replace the [[Bonaventure Expressway]] with another "urban boulevard" along a long stretch of cut-off waterfront.

===Toronto===
During the 1950s, Toronto experienced the same sort of [[urban sprawl]] that was sweeping through the United States. Suburbs grew along existing highway corridors, stretching the city east and west, and then northward along the various provincial [[superhighway]]s. These highways ended at the city limits, however, and there was little route capacity within the city itself. This caused enormous traffic problems within the city,&lt;ref&gt;Sewell, pg. 65&lt;/ref&gt; and a network of new highways to address the problem became part of the Official Plan in 1959.&lt;ref name="s682"&gt;Sewell, pg. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

As construction of the network started, the mood of the citizens changed. By the mid-1960s, there was a growing awareness that [[Suburbanization|the growth of the suburbs]] led to a [[flight of capital]] from the city cores, resulting in the [[urban decay]] being seen throughout the US. Additionally, several of the chosen routes ran through densely settled neighbourhoods, including some of the more upscale areas of Toronto, like [[Forest Hill, Toronto|Forest Hill]] and the [[University of Toronto]]. While the opposition was growing, [[Jane Jacobs]] moved to Toronto after having successfully rallied groups to cancel the construction of the [[Lower Manhattan Expressway]] in [[New York City]]. Applying the same formula in Toronto, Jacobs rallied local groups to oppose development of the [[Spadina Expressway]] project, while twice being arrested in the process.&lt;ref&gt;Max Allen (1997), "Ideas that Matter: The Worlds of Jane Jacobs", pg. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 3, 1971, Premier [[Bill Davis]] rose in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario|Provincial Legislature]] and stated, "Cities were built for people and not cars. If we are building a transportation system to serve the automobile, the Spadina Expressway would be a good place to start. But if we are building a transportation system to serve people, the Spadina Expressway is a good place to stop."&lt;ref name="s682" /&gt; The expressway plan was dead; construction of the Spadina Expressway ended. The successful outcome of inspired protests of varying degrees to other [[cancelled expressways in Toronto|expressway projects in Toronto]] including the Scarborough, Richview, Crosstown and East Metro Expressway Projects. This led to none of the other planned expressways ever being built.

Instead of expressways, Davis and his new Minister of Transport, [[Charles MacNaughton]], outlined the "[[GO-Urban]]" plan, an [[Intermediate Capacity Transit System]] that will serve the [[Greater Toronto Area]] in place of expressways. This led to the development of [[Bombardier Innovia Metro]]. By the time the prototype was ready for service in the early 1980s, changes in the provincial government ended support for the entire GO-Urban project. Only a single short demonstration line was built in Toronto, the [[Scarborough RT]].&lt;ref name="filey"&gt;[[Mike Filey]], "Toronto Sketches 5: The Way We Were", Dundurn Press, 1997, {{ISBN|1-55002-292-X}}, pg. 38-40&lt;/ref&gt;

===Windsor===
[[Windsor, Ontario]] is an interesting case of freeway revolt that was later partially reversed. By 1965, the [[Ministry of Transportation (Ontario)|MTO]] had completed construction of [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]] from the south end of Windsor to the [[Thousand Islands Parkway]] and onward to the [[Quebec]] border.&lt;!-- 1000 Islands Parkway wasn't bypassed until 1968 --&gt; Plans were announced to extend the freeway along [[Huron Church Road]] to the [[Ambassador Bridge]], but residents and business owners along the route [[NIMBY|protested]] and killed the plan, leaving the freeway's terminus at [[Highway 3 (Ontario)|Highway 3]]. In recent years, traffic had increased. A new bridge and freeway was needed; [[expropriation]] of nearby properties began in the late 2000s for Highway 401's extension to a new proposed border crossing. The [[Rt. Hon. Herb Gray Parkway]]'s construction, much of it below-grade, began in late 2011 and is expected to be completed by 2015. {{asof|2014}}, the proposed [[Gordie Howe International Bridge]] which will continue Ontario 401 through the Delray neighborhood of Detroit, Michigan to [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|I-75]] is expected to be completed by 2023.

===Edmonton===
Original plans called for [[Alberta Highway 2]] to continue into [[Edmonton]], akin to the Deerfoot in Calgary, using 91st Street then descending into the [[Mill Creek Ravine]]. However residents along Mill Creek as well as many others who did not wish to have portions of the river valley destroyed at the expense of a freeway opposed the plans and as such they were never completed. The only portions to be completed were 91st Street and the [[James MacDonald Bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://albertaroads.homestead.com/edmonton/plans/index.html|title=Alberta Roads|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vancouver===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2013}}
In [[Vancouver]], a freeway project that began with the construction of the [[Georgia Viaduct|Georgia and Dunsmuir Viaducts]] in the [[Strathcona, Vancouver|Strathcona]] neighborhood was stopped by activists and residents; the plan was intended to link an eight-lane freeway from the [[British Columbia Highway 1|Trans-Canada Highway]] through the East End, destroying much of [[Chinatown, Vancouver|Chinatown]]. Before it was stopped, Vancouver's [[Hogan's Alley (Vancouver)|Hogan's Alley]] neighbourhood was largely demolished.  The complete proposal in reports prepared by Swan-Wooster included a six lane tunnel to North Vancouver.  An elevated freeway would have run along the Burrard Inlet waterfront, right through property where two Fairmont hotels and many other buildings have since been built.  Another elevated freeway would have run through what is now the new portion of Yaletown, where the roundhouse is.  It would likely have been adjacent to or above the current Pacific Avenue, between Old and New Yaletown.

The Dunsmuir tunnel, a former freight railroad line of the CPR would also have been part of the freeway. This tunnel is now used by the SkyTrain [[Expo Line (SkyTrain)|Expo Line]], a rapid transit line using the [[Bombardier Innovia Metro]] technology developed for Toronto.

An attempt was made in 1995 to revive part of the project, adding three lanes of traffic to the north shore; it was also killed by public protest.

Successive city councils in the 1970s and 1980s prohibited the construction of freeways as part of a long-term plan.
This was taken as far as refusing to have a cloverleaf where the provincially authorized and funded [[Oak Street Bridge]] entered the city.  It was allowed to enter directly onto Oak Street, but no other approaches were allowed for decades.  As a result, the only freeway within city limits is the Trans-Canada Highway, which passes through the north-eastern corner of the city.  Very few major roads have been built in decades although the population would likely have doubled.

The conflicting opinions of the City of Vancouver's residents, as represented by their successive councils, and the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation continue in 2013. Many of the suburbs also want more automobile access to Vancouver. The city resists additional cars entering from the suburbs. The province continues to build bridges and freeways throughout the region, but they end at the city's boundaries.

==Netherlands==

===Amsterdam===
In [[Amsterdam]] in the 1970s, plans existed for a highway between the end of the [[A2 motorway (Netherlands)|A2]] at the President Kennedylaan to the [[IJtunnel]], along with the plans of the [[Amsterdam Metro]] around [[Nieuwmarkt]]. It would have demolished thousands of houses and monuments on its path, and therefore it led to the Nieuwmarkt riots in 1975. The metro was built, but the highway plans were removed.

===Utrecht===
In [[Utrecht]], plans to build the [[A27 motorway (Netherlands)|A27]] led to years of protests and juridical procedures, for example in October 1978, there was a big demonstration. Eventually in 1982, the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|Dutch Parliament]] had to decide whether to build or not. A narrow majority of 71 was in favour, 69 opposed. Parts of Amelisweerd were occupied by activists after the decision. The encampment, established by the activists, was evacuated by police and 465 trees were cut down and bulldozed. At the same time a procedure opposing the tree felling was started, however, a municipality lawyer reported that the last tree had already been cut down. Thus the short-term procedure failed to achieve its aim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novatv.nl/page/detail/uitzendingen/5462#|title=NOVA - detail - Uitzendingen|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rtl.nl/(/actueel/rtlnieuws/)/components/actueel/rtlnieuws/2009/01_januari/26/verrijkingsonderdelen/0126_1630_amelisweerd_geschiedenis.xml&lt;/ref&gt; After the motorway was completed in 1986, more congestion arose on the motorway. In 2009, new plans were made to extend the road from 2x4 lanes to 2x6 or even 2x7. The start of the construction in 2011 led again to protests, with clearly visible banners along the motorway.

{{See also|List of unused highways in the United States}}
In the United States the "revolts" occurred mainly in cities and suburbs.  Many cities have [[unused highway]]s, abruptly terminating freeway alignments, and short stretches of freeway in the middle of nowhere, all evidence of larger projects which were never completed.  In some instances, freeway revolts have led to the eventual [[freeway removal|removal or relocation of freeways]] that had been built.

{{Freemasonry}}
&lt;!-- By consensus stating that Freemasonry originated in the UK and is therefore a Commonwealth-related topic, this article uses Commonwealth (or British) English spelling. Please do not change it to American usage. See MOS:RETAIN. Note also MOS:TIES regarding Oxford English (noting that -ize spelling is acceptable in as it predates the more recent spelling usage of -ise in British English), q.v.--&gt;
The '''history of Freemasonry''' encompasses the origins, evolution and defining events of the [[fraternal organis&lt;!-- NOTE: THIS ARTICLE USES UK SPELLING ... which spells this word with an "s" and not a "z". --&gt;ation]] known as [[Freemasonry]].  It covers three phases. Firstly, the emergence of organised lodges of operative masons during the Middle Ages, then the admission of lay members as "accepted" or speculative masons, and finally the evolution of purely speculative lodges, and the emergence of Grand Lodges to govern them. The watershed in this process is generally taken to be the formation of the first Grand Lodge in London in 1717. The two difficulties facing historians are the paucity of written material, even down to the 19th century, and the misinformation generated by masons and non-masons alike from the earliest years.

A complete history of Freemasonry is beyond the scope of a single article. This article traces the early development of Freemasonry from organised bodies of operative stonemasons to the modern system of speculative lodges organised around regional or national "Grand Lodges". Notable events and developments of the modern period are also briefly described. The history of specific subjects, rites and jurisdictions within the general heading of Freemasonry is dealt with in detail elsewhere, in [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Freemasonry/Articles|their own articles]].

==Origin myths and theories==

===Early Masonic sources===

The earliest masonic texts each contain some sort of a history of the craft, or ''mystery'', of masonry. The oldest known work of this type, [[Masonic manuscripts#Halliwell Manuscript, or Regius Poem|The Halliwell Manuscript, or Regius Poem]], dates from between 1390 and 1425. This document has a brief history in its introduction, stating that the "craft of masonry" began with [[Euclid]] in Egypt, and came to England in the reign of King [[Athelstan of England|Athelstan]] (born about 894, died 27 October 939).&lt;ref name="BCRegius"&gt;[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/regius.html Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon] The Halliwell Manuscript, retrieved 22 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, the [[Matthew Cooke Manuscript|Cooke Manuscript]] traces masonry to [[Jabal (Bible)|Jabal]] son of [[Lamech (descendant of Cain)|Lamech]] (Genesis 4: 20–22), and tells how this knowledge came to Euclid, from him to the [[Children of Israel]] ([[Egyptian bondage|while they were in Egypt]]), and so on through an elaborate path to Athelstan.&lt;ref name="Cooke"&gt;[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/cooke.html Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon] The Matthew Cooke Manuscript with Translation, retrieved 22 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This myth formed the basis for subsequent manuscript constitutions, all tracing masonry back to biblical times, and fixing its institutional establishment in England during the reign of Athelstan (927–939).&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Speth, Quatuor Coronatorum Antigrapha, Vol I, 1888, part III, vi–vii&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the formation of the [[Premier Grand Lodge of England]], [[James Anderson (Freemason)|James Anderson]] was commissioned to digest these "Gothic Constitutions" in a palatable, modern form. The resulting constitutions are prefaced by a history more extensive than any before, again tracing the history of what was now freemasonry back to biblical roots, again forging Euclid into the chain. True to his material, Anderson fixes the first grand assembly of English Masons at York, under Athelstan's son, Edwin, who is otherwise unknown to history.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/libraryscience/25/ Anderson's Constitutions] Franklin's reprint, retrieved 22 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Expanded, revised, and republished, Anderson's 1738 constitutions listed the Grand Masters since [[Augustine of Canterbury]], listed as ''Austin the Monk''.&lt;ref&gt;J. Anderson, The New Book of Constitutions, p140, Quatuor Coronatorum Antigrapha, Vol VII, 1900&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Preston (Freemason)|William Preston's]] ''[[William Preston (Freemason)#Legacy|Illustrations of Freemasonry]]'' enlarged and expanded on this masonic creation myth.&lt;ref name="Preston"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7FxJAAAAIAAJ Preston's Illustrations of Freemasonry] on Google Books retrieved 22 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the 1737 lecture of [[Andrew Michael Ramsay|Chevalier Ramsay]] added the [[crusaders]] to the lineage. He maintained that ''Crusader Masons'' had revived the craft with secrets recovered in the [[Outremer|Holy Land]], under the patronage of the [[Knights Hospitaller]]. At this point, the "history" of the craft in [[Continental Freemasonry]] diverged from that in England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/ramsay_biography_oration.html Pietre-Stones Biography of Ramsay] retrieved 22 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speculative histories===

Anderson's histories of 1723 and 1738, Ramsay's romanticisation, together with the internal allegory of masonic ritual, centred on [[Solomon's Temple|King Solomon’s Temple]] and its architect, [[Hiram Abiff]], have provided ample material for further speculation.

The earliest known ritual places the first masonic lodge in the porchway of King Solomon’s Temple.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Registry House MS, see Robert L.D. Cooper, Cracking the Freemason's Code, Rider 2006, p215&lt;/ref&gt; Following Anderson, it has also been possible to trace Freemasonry to [[Euclid]], [[Pythagoras]], [[Moses]], the [[Essene]]s, and the [[Culdee]]s.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;Coil, Henry W. (1967). ''Freemasonry Through Six Centuries.'' 2 vols., Vol. I, pg. 6. Richmond, Va: Macoy Publ. Co.&lt;/ref&gt; Preston started his history with the [[Druids]], while Anderson's description of masons as "[[Noachides]]", extrapolated by [[Albert Mackey]], put [[Noah]] into the equation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/anti-masonry08.html Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon] Anti-masonry Frequently Asked Questions, VIII Religion, retrieved 4 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Ramsay's introduction of Crusader masons, the [[Knights Templar]] became involved in the myth, starting with [[Karl Gotthelf von Hund]]'s [[Rite of Strict Observance]], which also linked in the exiled [[House of Stuart]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/hund_k/hund_k.html Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon] Karl Gotthelf Hund, retrieved 4 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The murder of [[Hiram Abiff]] was taken as an allegory for the death of [[Charles I of England]]. [[Oliver Cromwell]] emerges as the founder of Freemasonry in an anonymous anti-masonic work of 1745, commonly attributed to [[Abbé Larudan]]. Mackey states that "The propositions of Larudan are distinguished for their absolute independence of all historical authority and for the bold assumptions which are presented to the reader in the place of facts."&lt;ref&gt;A. G. Mackey, The History of Freemasonry, Chapters XXX–XXXII&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-masonic writings of [[Christoph Friedrich Nicolai]] implicated [[Francis Bacon]] and the [[Rosicrucians]],&lt;ref name="AM3"&gt;[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/anti-masonry03.html Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon] Anti-masonry Frequently Asked Questions, III People, retrieved 5 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Christopher Wren]]'s connection with the craft was omitted from Anderson's first book of constitutions, but appeared in the second when Wren was dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/christopher_wren_freemasonry.html Pietre Stones] Martin I. MacGregor, The Life and Times of Sir Christopher Wren, 2005, retrieved 5 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Similarly, attempts to root Freemasonry in the French [[Compagnons du Tour de France|Compagnonnage]] have produced no concrete links.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masonicworld.com/EDUCATION/files/jan04/continental_freemasonry_before_a.htm Masonic World] Oliver D. Street, Continental Freemasonry before A. D. 1723, The American Freemason, Feb. 1914, retrieved 5 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Connections to the [[Collegium (ancient Rome)|Roman Collegia]] and [[Comacine masters]] are similarly tenuous, although some Freemasons see them as exemplars rather than ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;''Freemasonry and the Roman Collegia'' by H.L. Haywood, ''The Builder'', 1923 [http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/collegia.html – Freemasonry and the Roman Collegia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Freemasonry and the Comacine masters'' by H.L. Haywood, ''The Builder'', 1923 [http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/comacine.html – Freemasonry and the Comacine Masters]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Paine]] traced Freemasonry to [[Ancient Egypt]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/history/paine_t.html Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon] Thomas Paine, The Origins of Freemasonry, New York, 1818&lt;/ref&gt; as did [[Cagliostro]], who went so far as to supply the ritual.&lt;ref name="AM3" /&gt;

More recently, several authors have attempted to link the Templars to the timeline of Freemasonry through the imagery of the carvings in [[Rosslyn Chapel]] in Scotland, where the Templars are rumoured to have sought refuge after the dissolution of the order.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, ''The Temple and the Lodge'', Arrow Books, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Hiram Key]]'', [[Robert Lomas]] and [[Christopher Knight (author)|Christopher Knight]] describe a timeline starting in ancient Egypt, and taking in [[Jesus]], the Templars, and Rosslyn before arriving at modern Freemasonry.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Knight (author)|Christopher Knight]] and [[Robert Lomas]]. ''[[The Hiram Key]]''. London, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  These claims are challenged by Robert Cooper, the curator of the [[Grand Lodge of Scotland]]'s library and museum, in his book [[The Rosslyn Hoax]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. D. Cooper, ''The Rosslyn Hoax'', Lewis Masonic, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emergence of modern masonic studies===

The first rational study of masonic history was published in Germany, but [[Georg Kloss]]'s 1847 work, ''Geschichte der Freimaurerei in England, Irland und Schottland'' was never translated.&lt;ref&gt;{{de-ADB|16|227|228|Kloß, Georg Franz Burkhard|Wilhelm Stricker|ADB:Kloß, Georg}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Findel's ''History of Freemasonry'' was translated from German to English in 1866, [[A. F. A. Woodford|Woodford]] in England and Murray-Lyon in Scotland were already active writers on the subject. Woodford was Findel's guide when he visited York to inspect manuscripts, and would shortly collaborate with [[s:Author:William James Hughan|Hughan]] in collecting, dating and classifying the old manuscript constitutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 last=Hughan |first=William James |wstitle=Freemasonry |volume=11 |page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Mackey]] was no less active in America. The list of his published works start in 1844 with "A Lexicon of Freemasonry", and extend to his monumental ''Encyclopedia of Freemasonry'' in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Appletons' Cyclopædia of American Biography/Mackey, John|Wikisource]] Appletons' Cyclopædia of American Biography/Mackey, John, 1900&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing interest, and participation, in masonic studies led, in 1886, to the formation in London of [[Quatuor Coronati Lodge]], the first lodge dedicated to masonic research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quatuorcoronati.com/founders.html Quatuor Coronati website] Article on foundation of Quatuor Coronati, partially taken from Ars Quatuor Coronatorum, vol 1, pp1–3, 1888&lt;/ref&gt;

== From origin to Grand Lodge Freemasonry ==

===Origin of the term "Freemason"===
The earliest official English documents to refer to masons are written in Latin or [[Norman language|Norman French]]. Thus we have "sculptores lapidum liberorum" (London 1212), "magister lathomus liberarum petrarum" (Oxford 1391), and "mestre mason de franche peer" ([[Statute of Labourers 1351]]). These all signify a worker in freestone, a grainless sandstone or limestone suitable for ornamental masonry. In the 17th century building accounts of [[Wadham College]] the terms freemason and freestone mason are used interchangeably. Freemason also contrasts with "Rough Mason" or "Layer", as a more skilled worker who worked or laid dressed stone.&lt;ref name="Knoop"&gt;Douglas Knoop, "The Genesis of Freemasonry", Manchester University Press, 1947&lt;/ref&gt;

The adjective "free" in this context may also be taken to infer that the mason is not [[slavery|enslaved]], [[Indentured servant|indentured]] or [[feudalism|feudally]] bound. While this is difficult to reconcile with medieval English masons, it apparently became important to Scottish operative lodges.&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;Robert L.D. Cooper, Cracking the Freemason's Code, Rider 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Master Masons in medieval England===

A medieval Master Mason would be required to undergo what passed for a liberal education in those days. In England, he would leave home at nine or ten years of age already literate in English and French, educated at home or at the petty (junior) school. From then until the age of fourteen, he would attend monastery or [[grammar school]] to learn Latin, or as a page in a knightly household would learn deportment in addition to his studies. Between the ages of fourteen and seventeen he would learn the basic skills of choosing, shaping, and combining stone and then between the ages of 17 and 21, be required to learn by rote a large number of formal problems in geometry. Three years as a journeyman would often finish with the submission of a masterwork dealing with a set problem in construction or design. At this point, he was considered qualified, but still had a career ladder to climb before attaining the status of Master Mason on a large project.&lt;ref name="Cryer"&gt;Revd Neville Barker Cryer, ''York Mysteries Revealed'', Ian Allan Publishing, 2006, pp 71–74&lt;/ref&gt;

In his function as architect, the Master Mason probably made his plans for each successive stage of a build in [[silverpoint]] on a prepared parchment or board. These would be realised on the ground by using a larger compass than the one used for drafting. Medieval architects are depicted with much larger compasses and squares where they are shown on a building site. Fine detail was transferred from the drawing board by means of wooden templates supplied to the masons.&lt;ref name="Cryer" /&gt;

The Master Masons who appear in record as presiding over major works, such as York Minster, became wealthy and respected. Visiting Master Masons and Master Carpenters sat at high table of monasteries, dining with the abbott.&lt;ref name="Cryer" /&gt;

===From the Middle Ages to the Reformation===
The historical record shows two levels of organisation in medieval masonry, the lodge and the "guild". The original use of the word lodge indicates a workshop erected on the site of a major work, the first mention being [[Vale Royal Abbey]] in 1278. Later, it gained the secondary meaning of the community of masons in a particular place. The earliest surviving records of these are the laws and ordinances of the lodge at [[York Minster]] in 1352. It should be noted that these regulations were imposed by the [[Dean and chapter|Dean and Chapter of the Minster]].&lt;ref name="Knoop" /&gt;

Nineteenth-century historians imposed the term "[[Guild]]" on the "fellowships" of medieval tradesmen as an analogy with the [[merchant guild]]s. The masons were late in forming such bodies. The major employer of masons in medieval England was the [[Monarchy of England|crown]], and the crown frequently employed masons by [[impressment]]. In other words, they were forcibly recruited when the need arose. 

[[Masonic manuscripts#Halliwell Manuscript, or Regius Poem|The Halliwell Manuscript, or Regius Poem]] is the oldest known document of masonic origin. It was published in 1840 by Shakespearean scholar and collector [[James Halliwell-Phillipps|James Halliwell]] who dated it to 1390. [[A. F. A. Woodford]], the pioneering Masonic scholar and a founder of [[Quatuor Coronati Lodge]], agreed with this dating.&lt;ref name="Regius"&gt;[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/regius.html Pietre-Stones] The Regius Poem, retrieved 22 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, historian [[Andrew Prescott]] has dated the text to the second quarter of the fifteenth century.&lt;ref name ="Prescott"&gt;[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/prescott07.html Pietre-Stones Masonic Papers] The Old Charges Revisited, Andrew Prescott, from Transactions of the Lodge of Research No. 2429 (Leicester), 2006, retrieved 22 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 

The poem may be seen as a response to a stream of legislation dating back to the [[Black Death]],  and the [[Statute of Labourers 1351|Statute of Labourers of 1351]], in which [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] attempted to fix wages at pre-plague levels.&lt;ref name="Laborer"&gt;[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/history/statutes/ordinance.html Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon] List of Ordinances of Laborers, retrieved 14 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier date follows the [[List of Acts of the Parliament of England to 1483#1389|1389 ordinance]] of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] requiring the guilds and fellowships to lay before him their Charters and Letters Patent,&lt;ref name="Laborer" /&gt; and the second follows the more serious [[List of Acts of the Parliament of England to 1483#1425|legislation of 1425]] banning the annual assemblies of masons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/history/statutes/henry_vi.html Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon] Statutes of Henry VI, retrieved 22 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1356, the preamble to regulations governing the Trade of Masons specifically states that, unlike the other trades, no body existed for the regulation of masonry by masons. Finally, in 1376, four representatives of the "mystery" or trade are elected to the [[Common Council of the City of London|Common Council]] in London. This also seems to be the first use of the word "freemason" in English. It was immediately struck out, and replaced with the word "mason".&lt;ref name="Knoop" /&gt;


The poem claims that these assemblies were ordained by King Athelstan and that he also linked the wages of a mason to the cost of living.&lt;ref name="Regius" /&gt;

The [[Matthew Cooke Manuscript|Cooke]] Manuscript, dating from about 1450, set the pattern for what Anderson called the "Gothic Constitutions", the older histories and regulations of the craft.&lt;ref name="Cooke" /&gt; After a brief blessing, these documents describe the seven [[Liberal Arts]], assigning predominance to Geometry, which is equated with Masonry. They then proceed to a history of masonry/geometry, finishing with King Athelstan, or Edwin, his brother or son depending on source, assembling England's masons to give them their charges. The regulations or charges follow, usually with instructions as to the manner in which a new mason should swear to them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masonicworld.com/education/files/theoldchargesapr01.htm Masonic World] The Old Charges, Wallace Mcleod, retrieved 22 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Also around 1450 the will of a mason from Beverley gives a tantalising glimpse into the emergence of masonic regalia. An inventory of John Cadeby's possessions mentions several ''zona''s, or girdles. Two were silver mounted, and one of these had the letters B and I in the middle, indicating [[Boaz and Jachin]], the twin pillars of Solomon's Temple.&lt;ref&gt;John Yarker, The Arcane Schools, Manchester 1909, pp341–342&lt;/ref&gt; He also owned a writing table and six English books, making him comfortably well-off and literate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=36410 British History Online] K J Allison (Editor), A P Baggs, L M Brown, G C F Forster, I Hall, R E Horrox, G H R Kent, D Neave, A History of the County of York East Riding: Volume 6: The borough and liberties of Beverley, 1989, pp57–62&lt;/ref&gt;

The following century and a half produced few new manuscripts. The [[Masonic Manuscripts#Dowland Manuscript|Dowland manuscript]], whose original is now lost, and [[Masonic Manuscripts#Grand Lodge No 1|Grand Lodge No 1]], for the first time locate Edwin's assembly of Masons at York. The [[Masonic Manuscripts#Lansdowne|Lansdowne]],  originally dated to this period, is now thought to date from the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Prescott" /&gt;

It was during this period that the [[Reformation]] occurred. It was at one time assumed that the church was the major employer of masons, and with the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] the lodges disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;R. F. Gould, On the Antiquity of Masonic Symbolism, Ars Quatuor Coronatorum 3, 1890, p7&lt;/ref&gt; It was also believed that the craft "guilds" were abolished in England in 1547.&lt;ref&gt;For instance: G. W. Speth, Scottish Freemasonry before the Era of the Grand Lodges, Ars Quatuor Coronatorum, vol 1, p139, 1889&lt;/ref&gt; On the death of Henry VIII, [[Archbishop Cranmer]] sought to advance the reformation by the abolition of Guilds and fellowships. In 1548, "The bill of conspiracies of victuallers and craftsmen" was passed, revoking their monopolies. In 1549 it was repealed, presumably because they were too useful to the government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/history/edwardvi/statutes.html Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon] Statutes of Edward VI, retrieved 22 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The government continued to be a major employer of masons, who in London had moved from a fellowship to an incorporation. While this was not chartered until 1666, the state used it in the sixteenth century to procure and indent masons for building projects. In addition, masons were increasingly employed by private individuals.&lt;ref name="Knoop" /&gt; The Saints day parades by the various crafts, enacting plays about their various patron saints, were however suppressed. Robert Cooper, the archivist of the Grand Lodge of Scotland, believes that the lost mystery play of the masons may survive in the ritual of contemporary masonic lodges.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;

==Freemasonry In Scotland==
An early continental history quotes a 16th-century source that by 1535, there were two Scottish masonic lodges recorded in France, one in Paris and the other in Lyon.&lt;ref&gt;Histoire des francs-maçons, J.-P. Dubreuil, H I G Francois, Brussels, 1838, vol 2, p94&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Scotland, the lodges of masons were brought under the control of two crown appointed officials, the Warden General and the Principal Master of Work to the Crown, the latter being in existence from 1539 at the latest. Towards the end of the century, [[William Schaw]] held both these posts.&lt;ref name="Knoop" /&gt; In 1598, in conference with the masters of lodges in south east Scotland, he produced a set of regulations for the governance of masons and their lodges now known as the Schaw Statutes. These state "They shall be true to one another and live charitably together as becometh sworn brethren and companions of the Craft." They mention wardens, deacons, entered prentices and cowans.&lt;ref name="Schaw"&gt;[http://www.themasonictrowel.com/Articles/Manuscripts/manuscripts/shaw_statutes/shaw_statutes.htm The Masonic Trowel] The Schaw Statutes, retrieved 22 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The second Schaw statutes, a year later, included in their negotiations a representative of the Lodge of Kilwinning (now [[Lodge Mother Kilwinning]] No 0) in Ayrshire, which was assigned jurisdiction over the west of Scotland. Edinburgh became the "first and principal" lodge and Kilwinning the "second and head" lodge of Scotland, attempting to appease all parties.&lt;ref name ="Cooper" /&gt; Since neither the King nor the master of Kilwinning was present, the document was not regarded as final or binding. It was assumed that the King's warrant for the regulations would be obtained.&lt;ref&gt;"bot be ressone of the absence of his Maitie out of the toun and yt thair was na mrs bot the ludge of Edr convenit at this tyme, We culd not get ane satlat order (as the privileges of the craft requyris) tane at this tyme, bot heirefter quhan occasioun sal be offerit we sall get his Maities warrand"&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1602, Schaw wrote a Charter granting to Sir William St. Clair of Rosslyn the right to purchase patronage over the masons of Scotland. Kilwinning is noticeably absent from the list of lodges appending their endorsement. The charter seems to have lapsed when St. Clair fled following a scandal,&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; and a second charter was granted to his son, also William St. Clair, in 1628.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rgle.org.uk/RGLE_StClair.htm RGLE website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523130205/http://www.rgle.org.uk/RGLE_StClair.htm |date=23 May 2012 }} Full text of both St. Clair Charters, retrieved 22 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This patronage was surrendered by their descendant, another William St. Clair, on the formation of the [[Grand Lodge of Scotland]] in 1736,&lt;ref&gt;[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/stclair_w/stclair_w.html William Saint Clair of Roslin] bio page on the Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon website&lt;/ref&gt; in spite of the fact that it never won the royal approval that would have made it valid.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;

===Emergence of speculative masonry===

The lasting effect of the Schaw Statutes arose from the 1599 directive that the lodges should employ a reputable notary as secretary, and that he should record all important transactions. The Scottish lodges began to keep minutes, and therefore the appearance of "accepted" or non-operative masons is better recorded than in England, where there are no known internal records of lodge proceedings. 

The first recorded admission of non-masons was on 3 July 1634 at [[Lodge of Edinburgh (Mary's Chapel) No. 1]] , in the persons of Sir Anthony Alexander, his elder brother, Lord Alexander, and Sir Alexander Strachan of Thornton. Sir Anthony was the King's Principal Master of Work, and the man who had effectively blocked the second St. Clair charter, the lodges of Scotland being his own responsibility. The reasons that his brother and their friend were also admitted are unclear.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;

The reasons and mechanisms for the transition of masonic lodges from operative communities to speculative fellowships remain elusive. As the responsibility for design shifted from the Master Mason to the architect in the sixteenth century, it is probable that architects started to join the lodges of the masons they worked with.&lt;ref name="Knoop" /&gt; It is also possible that, along with other professional bodies (including the East India Company&lt;ref&gt;Giles Milton, Nathaniel's Nutmeg, Sceptre, 1999, p200&lt;/ref&gt;), operative masonic lodges began to raise money by charging the gentry for admission to their "mysteries".&lt;ref name ="Cooper" /&gt; Another opinion states that masonic lodges deliberately recruited the rich and powerful in an attempt to improve their pay and working conditions.&lt;ref name="Prescott" /&gt;

==England vs Scotland Membership==

While lodge records show a gradual development of mixed lodges in Scotland, it is evident that the lodge which initiated [[Elias Ashmole]] at Warrington on 16 October 1646 was mainly or entirely composed of speculative or accepted masons.&lt;ref name="Knoop" /&gt; In 1686 [[Robert Plot]]'s "Natural History of Staffordshire" contains a passage about persons of quality being admitted to the society of free-masons, whose history Plot finds invented and ridiculous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/robert_plot_freemasonry.html Pietre-Stones] The Importance of Plot's Natural History of Staffordshire, Yasha Beresiner, retrieved 22 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; At the start of the Grand Lodge period, there appears to have been a predominance of purely speculative lodges in the south of England, with operative and mixed lodges still in the majority in the north and in Scotland.&lt;ref name="Knoop" /&gt;

In 1716, four lodges and "some old Brothers" met at the Apple Tree Tavern in Covent Garden and agreed to meet again the next year to form a "Grand Lodge". These were the Goose and Gridiron, the Crown, the Apple Tree, and the Rummer and Grapes. The "old Brothers" were probably from the Cheshire Cheese and at least one other lodge.&lt;ref name="Knoop" /&gt;

== Early Grand Lodge period ==

===First Grand Lodge===

The early history of [[Premier Grand Lodge of England|Grand Lodge]] is uncertain, since no minutes were taken until 1723. It is known that the four lodges mentioned above held an assembly at the Goose and Gridiron, in St. Paul's Churchyard, on, 24 June 1717 (the [[Feast of St. John the Baptist]]). They agreed to restore their "Quarterly Communications", four meetings a year for the transaction of masonic business, and an annual assembly to elect the next Grand Master. At this meeting, they elected [[Anthony Sayer]], Master of the lodge at the Apple Tree, of whom little else is known, and the Grand Lodge of London and Westminster was born. At this stage, it is unlikely that they saw themselves as anything more than an association of London lodges. This perception was to change very rapidly.&lt;ref name="Knoop" /&gt;

The next year, [[George Payne (Freemason)|George Payne]] became Grand Master. He was a career civil servant with the commissioners of taxes. In 1719, they elected [[John Theophilus Desaguliers]], a clergyman, an eminent scientist, and a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]]. The last commoner to serve as Grand Master was George Payne in his second term of office in 1720/21, when he wrote "The General Regulations of a Free Mason" which were later incorporated in [[James Anderson (Freemason)|Anderson's]] Constitutions. Thereafter, in what appears to be a deliberate attempt to raise the profile of the organisation, all the Grand Masters have been members of the nobility.&lt;ref name="Knoop" /&gt;

Desaguliers is often described as the "father" of modern freemasonry. It was Desaguliers who inscribed the dedication to Anderson's Constitutions,&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt; headed the committee which directed and approved them, and supplied the "Gothic Constitutions" from which they were formed. Although he only served one term as Grand Master, he was twice Deputy Grand Master under figurehead Grand Masters, and at other times behaved as if he was Grand Master, forming irregular lodges to conduct initiations. It seems to have been Desaguliers who insisted that ritual be remembered rather than written down, leading to a dearth of material on the development of English ritual until after the formation of United Grand Lodge.&lt;ref name="Knoop" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masonicdictionary.com/desaguliers.html Masonic Dictionary] Article on Desaguliers sourced from Mackey's Encyclopedia, retrieved 22 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

These considerations cause many masonic historians to see him as the guiding intelligence as the new Grand Lodge embarked on an era of self-publicity, which saw the sudden expansion of speculative masonry, with a corresponding rise in anti-masonic groups and publications. Initiations began to be reported in newspapers. The noble grand masters were often fellows of the Royal Society, but [[Philip Wharton, 1st Duke of Wharton|the Duke of Wharton]] (1722–23) had just had his Hell-fire club shut down by the government, and joined, or possibly formed, an anti-masonic group called the [[Gormagon]]s almost as soon as he left office. From 1721 the installation of the new Grand Master was the occasion for a parade, originally on foot, later in carriages. This became the subject of some ridicule, until starting in 1740 there were also mock processions by anti-masonic groups, leading to the discontinuation of the practice in 1747. The rapid expansion of freemasonry also led to many new lodges failing after only a year or two. In addition to attacks from outside the craft, there were now disillusioned ex-masons willing to make money out of "exposures" of freemasonry.&lt;ref name="Knoop" /&gt;

===Anderson's ''Constitutions''===
''The Constitutions of the Free-Masons'', "For the Use of the Lodges" in London and Westminster, was published in 1723. It was edited by the [[presbyterian]] clergyman, [[James Anderson (minister, author, Mason)|James Anderson]], to the order of [[John Theophilus Desaguliers]], and approved by a Grand Lodge committee under his control. This work was reprinted in Philadelphia in 1734 by [[Benjamin Franklin]], who was that year elected Grand Master of Masons in Pennsylvania. It was also translated into Dutch (1736), German (1741), and French (1745).&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt;

Anderson was minister of the Presbyterian church in [[Swallow Street]], London, which had once been [[Huguenot]] church, and one of its four Deacons was Desaguliers' father.&lt;ref&gt;Ric Berman, ''The Foundations of Modern Freemasonry'', Sussex Academic Press 2012, pp40–41,&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his meeting with Desaguliers, he seems to have passed himself off as a [[Talmudic]] scholar. His reward for his labours was the copyright on the work. In time, and to Anderson's dismay, it was condensed into "pocket" editions over which he had no control and from which he received no income. It was expanded, updated, and re-published in 1738.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;

The historical section, which comprises almost half the book, has already been described. This is followed by the "Charges", or general rules for the conduct of Freemasons, and Payne's Regulations, the specific rules by which Grand Lodge and the lodges under its control were to be governed. The ceremony for dedicating a new lodge was briefly outlined, and the work finished with a section of songs.&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt; For the first time, the old hand-written charges and constitutions was replaced by an accessible, printed condensation of all there was to being a Freemason, omitting only the ritual. Although the historical section was attacked at the time, and ever since, as being a work of obvious fiction, the work remains a milestone in masonic history.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; The "Antient Charges" published in the current ''Book of Constitutions'' of the [[United Grand Lodge of England]] have altered little from those originally published by Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;''United Grand Lodge of England Constitutions'' 2001, p 137&lt;/ref&gt;

===Degrees and rituals of Freemasonry===

In common with other trades or mysteries, medieval masonry recognised three grades of craftsman;— the apprentice, the journeyman, and the master. An apprentice who had learned his craft became a journeyman, qualified to do all manner of masonic work. The master was also qualified as a project manager, often functioning as architect as well. He would sketch the day's work on a tracing board for execution by the journeymen and apprentices.&lt;ref name="Knoop" /&gt; The Schaw Statutes of 1598 show how this had evolved in the lodge system of Scottish masonry. An apprentice, after serving his term of seven years, could elect to pay to join a lodge, becoming an "entered apprentice". (Alternatively, he could elect to freelance on the lower grades of building work as a "Cowan".) The journeymen were referred to as "fellows" or "fellows of the craft", which accords with the Regius poem's injunction (line 51) that masons should "calle other felows by cuthe". The members of the lodge were "Brithers" (brothers), a Scottish legal term for those bound to each other by oath. The Master was simply the mason in charge of the lodge, or one who had held that distinction.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;

While the swearing of some sort of oath goes back to the earliest records of organised masonry, the first recorded ritual is not until 1696, in the Edinburgh Register House manuscript. From this, and from other documents of the same period, such as the Trinity College, Dublin manuscript of 1711, we can form an idea of the ritual of an operative lodge at the end of the 17th century. On taking of the oath of an Entered Apprentice a mason was entrusted with appropriate signs, a "Mason's Word", and a catechism. This was accompanied by much horseplay, which was probably excised as the craft became more gentrified. The fellowcraft was made to take a further oath, and entrusted with two further words and the "five points of fellowship", which in 1696 were foot to foot, knee to knee, heart to heart, hand to hand, and ear to ear. The distinction between a fellowcraft and a master is unclear, and in many documents they appear to be synonymous. As accepted masons became initiated, where the various words and signs could no longer be regarded as professional qualifications, the entered apprentice ritual and the fellowcraft/master were sometimes condensed into one ceremony.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;

In Pritchard's ''Masonry Dissected'', an exposure of masonic ritual written in 1730 by a disillusioned ex-mason, we see for the first time something recognisable as the three degrees of modern Freemasonry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alholman.com/PHLibrary/Masonry_Dissected-Pritchard_1730.pdf Pritchard's Masonry Dissected] pdf retrieved 16 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; On being admitted to a lodge, a new mason naturally progresses through the degrees of Entered Apprentice, Fellowcraft, and Master Mason. There still remains the rank of Installed Master, which comprises the Master in charge of the lodge and its past masters, and involves its own ritual, words and signs, but entails being elected to take charge of the lodge for a year.&lt;ref name="UGLE"&gt;United Grand Lodge of England Constitutions&lt;/ref&gt; These are the regular degrees and ranks of "craft" masonry, common to all constitutions. Other, "higher" degrees are optional and require a mason to join a side-order, except in lodges constituted under the [[Grand Lodge of Scotland]], which are empowered to confer the Mark Master Mason degree on Master Masons, as an extension to the second or Fellowcraft degree. (see main article, [[Freemasonry]])

Anderson's 1723 constitutions seem to recognise only the grades of Entered Apprentice, and the Fellowcraft/Master. Hence the third degree emerged sometime between 1723 and 1730, and took some time to spread within the craft. The fact that it did spread seems to many scholars to indicate that the tri-gradal system was not so much innovation, as the re-organisation of pre-existing material.&lt;ref name="Knoop" /&gt; The Mason word, once given to the Entered Apprentice, was now conferred in the third degree with the five points of fellowship, and the two linked words formerly bestowed on a fellowcraft were split between the first two degrees. The new Master Mason degree was centred on the myth of [[Hiram Abiff]], which itself consists of three parts. The first is the biblical story of the Tyrian artisan with a Northern Israelite mother who became a master craftsman involved in the construction of King Solomon's Temple. The second is the story of his murder by subordinates, which is similar to one of the legends of the French [[Compagnons du Tour de France|Compagnonnage]]. Lastly, the story of the finding of his body, and the derivation therefrom of the five points of fellowship, which appears in the Graham Manuscript of 1725, where the body being sought and exhumed is that of Noah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/MADHAVAN_HiramicLegend.html Pietre Stones] The Hiramic Legend, C. S. Madhavan retrieved 25 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of this re-organisation is unknown. The earliest reference to the conferment of a third degree is from London, from the minutes of "Philo Musicae et Architecturae Societas Apollini", a short-lived musical society composed entirely of Freemasons. These minutes record the initiation and passing to the degree of Fellowcraft of Charles Cotton. Then, on 12 May 1725, the society took it upon itself to "pass" Brother Cotton and Brother Papillion Ball as Master Masons. This would nowadays be regarded as highly irregular. In March 1726 Gabriel Porterfield received the same degree in lodge Dumbarton Kilwinning in Scotland. That he was not the first is attested by the minutes of the lodge's foundation, only two months earlier, where Apprentices, Fellowcrafts, and Master Masons are recorded as attending. In December 1728, Greenock Kilwinning recorded separate fees for initiation, passing and raising.&lt;ref name=Carr&gt;[http://www.freemasoninformation.com/masonic-education/history/600-years-of-craft-ritual/ Freemason Information] 600 Years of Craft Ritual, Harry Carr, originally from Ars Quatuor Coronatorum, vol 81 (1968), pp. 153–180 retrieved 9 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lodge1759.co.uk/pocket_history.htm#chap9 Pocket History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110085318/http://www.lodge1759.co.uk/pocket_history.htm |date=10 January 2009 }} The Pocket History of Freemasonry, Fred L.

===Spread of Grand Lodges (1725–1750)===
[[File:Freimaurer Initiation.jpg|thumb|Initiation Paris 1745 &lt;br&gt; Retinted to resemble Moderns Lodge 1805]]
Even in London, there were many lodges that never affiliated with the new Grand Lodge. These unaffiliated Masons and their Lodges were referred to as "Old Masons," or "St. John Masons", and "St. John Lodges".&lt;ref&gt;Coil, Henry W. (1961). Two articles: "England, Grand Lodge of, According to the Old Institutions," pp. 237–240; and "Saints John," pp. 589–590. Coil's Masonic Encyclopedia. (rev. ed. 1996). Richmond, Va: Macoy Publ. &amp; Masonic Supply Co. Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the influence of the new central body spread quickly, and the 1725 minutes mention lodges in ten provincial towns as far north as [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], with Provincial Grand Lodges in [[South Wales]] and [[Cheshire]].&lt;ref name="Knoop" /&gt;

In the same year, a second Grand Lodge was founded in Ireland, which took several decades to bring all the Irish lodges under its wing. Rival Grand Lodges quickly appeared in Munster and Cork.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/uk_grand_lodges.html Pietre-Stones] Quote from Cementaria Hibernica, W. J. Chetwode-Crawley, retrieved 26 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It was in Ireland that the practice of recognising the regularity of a lodge by the issue of a warrant began, the first known example dating from 1731.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irishmasonicjewels.ie/The%20Story%20of%20Lost%20Archives%20of%20The%20Grand%20Lodge%20of%20Ireland%20By%20W.Bro.%20W.J.%20Chetwode%20Crawley.pdf Irish Masonic Jewels] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714050755/http://irishmasonicjewels.ie/The%20Story%20of%20Lost%20Archives%20of%20The%20Grand%20Lodge%20of%20Ireland%20By%20W.Bro.%20W.J.%20Chetwode%20Crawley.pdf |date=14 July 2010 }} The Story of the Lost Archives of the Grand Lodge of Ireland, W. J. Chetwode-Crawley, retrieved 26 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Lodge of Scotland was not formed until 1736.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;

Also in 1725 "The Ancient and Honourable Society and Fraternity of Freemasons meeting since time immemorial in the City of York" assumed the title, " The [[Grand Lodge of All England]] meeting in the City of York." This should not be interpreted as rivalry, as there was no overlap in the two jurisdictions. Indeed, Anderson's history would have produced the expectation of an older Grand Lodge at York, and the London Lodges were duly furnished with minutes going back some twenty years. Anderson's 1738 ''Constitutions'' recognised the independence of "the Old Lodge of York City. and the Lodges of Scotland, Ireland. France, Italy, etc".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brad.ac.uk/webofhiram/?section=york_rite&amp;page=grandyork.html Web Of Hiram] Historical notes concerning the York Grand Lodge, C. J. Scott, retrieved 26 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 1735, the Master and Wardens of an Irish lodge were refused admission to Grand Lodge because they did not have the written authority of the Grand Master of Ireland. It seems that they hoped to be recognised as a deputation from Lord Kingston, then Grand Master of Ireland, and Past Grand Master of the London Grand Lodge. They were offered, and refused, the English authorisation. This has been interpreted as evidence of a split between the two constitutions.&lt;ref&gt;The Minutes of the Grand Lodge of Freemasons of England, 1723–1739, Quatuor Coronatorum Antigrapha,Vol 10, 1913, p 259&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to the popularity of Pritchard's and other exposures of masonic ritual, Grand Lodge, about this time, made changes to ritual and passwords to make it more difficult for outsiders to pass themselves off as masons. These changes were not universally accepted by affiliated lodges. The Goose and Gridiron (now Lodge of Antiquity No. 2), one of the original and most senior lodges of the constitution, never adopted them. For the unaffiliated, the innovations simply deepened the division. At the time, London was absorbing many economic migrants from Ireland. Those who were already Freemasons felt that they could not work with the new ritual, and the lodges they formed swelled further the numbers of unaffiliated lodges in the capital.&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/aqc/ancients.html Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon] The Formation of the Grand Lodge of the Antients, I.

In the same period, Freemasonry as practiced by the English, Irish and Scottish lodges began to spread to Europe. The establishment of the first Grand Lodge in France is particularly problematic. Freemasonry itself appears to have been established in France by exiled [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]]. The [[Grand Lodge of France]] dates its foundation to 1728, when it claims the Grand Master was the [[Duke of Wharton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fm-fr.org/francais/obediences/les-obediences-regulieres/la-grande-loge-de-france Franc-Maçonnerie Française] La Grande Loge de France, retrieved 8 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Grand Orient de France|Grand Orient]] seals date the first Grand Lodge to 1736 (the split between the Grand Lodge and the Grand Orient occurred in 1773).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fm-fr.org/francais/obediences/les-obediences-liberales/le-grand-orient-de-france Franc-Maçonnerie Française] Le Grand Orient de France, retrieved 8 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; French histories date the first Grand Lodge to 24 June 1738.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Grand Orient de France#Histoire|French Wikipedia entry]] retrieved 8 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The situation seems confused, as other histories state that the first legitimate Grand Lodge was formed on 11 December 1743 as "The English Grand Lodge of France" with the Count of Clermont as grand master.&lt;ref name="Haywood"&gt;[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/europe_grand_lodges.html Pietre-Stones] Various Grand Lodges, H.

===Rival Grand Lodges===
[[File:Freimaurer Erhebung.jpg|thumb|Third degree ceremony, Paris, 1745, retinted in 1812 to resemble a Moderns Lodge in London]]
On 17 July 1751, representatives of six Lodges gathered at the Turk's Head Tavern, in [[Greek Street]], [[Soho]], London. Five were unaffiliated lodges of mainly Irish membership, and the sixth appears to have been formed shortly beforehand for the business of the evening. On that night, they established the "Most Ancient and Honourable Society of Free and Accepted Masons according to the Old Constitutions", now commonly known as the [[Antient Grand Lodge of England|Grand Lodge of the Antients]]. The first Grand Secretary, John Morgan, obtained a position in the Navy, and resigned after seven months. His successor, [[Laurence Dermott]], presided as Grand Secretary for almost twenty years, being deputy Grand Master on three occasions after that, and exercised considerable influence until his death in 1791.&lt;ref name="Clarke" /&gt;

Dermott's immediate impact was in replacing the regulations that Morgan had written with those of his own lodge in Dublin. In 1756 he published the Antient's own book of constitutions, entitled the "[[Ahiman Rezon]]", for which no meaning is known. Modeled on Spratt's Irish Constitutions,&lt;ref&gt;{{dead link|[http://www.antients.co.uk/History%20-%20Ahiman%20Rezon.htm Association of Atholl Lodges]|date=April 2015}} Ahiman Rezon, Ray Sheppard, retrieved 8 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; the regulations are comprehensive and well written, and are followed by an extended section devoted to songs. At the beginning, instead of Anderson's history, is an extended introduction attacking the original Grand Lodge, now calling itself the Grand Lodge of England, but saddled by Dermott with "the Moderns" in contrast to the "Ancient" usages of the new Grand Lodge. This name remains in use to the present day. His main weapon was satire. He started with an account of how he attempted to write a history which would better the others by describing masonry before Adam, but towards the end of the first volume, he fell asleep. He dreamed of a conversation with Ahimon, one of four sojourners from Jerusalem, about the futility of masonic histories, after which an ancient in a shining breastplate perused his first volume and pronounced, "Thou hast div'd deep into the water, and hast brought up a potsherd". He was woken by his neighbour's puppy eating his manuscript. Dermott then proceeded to a reasoned explanation of why a new Mason should not join a "Moderns" lodge, since their amended passwords would not be recognised by any of the other Grand Lodges which at that time existed. There follows a humorous account of their "unconstitutional fopperies", including Dermott's belief that their greatest masonic symbols were the knife and fork.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RnUIAAAAQAAJ Google books] Ahiman Rezon (pdf) retrieved 30 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Dermott's influence, penmanship, and oratory, the new Grand Lodge grew to be a serious challenge to the original. The Antient's lodges were warranted from 1752, a practice not taken up by the Moderns for another two decades. As the unaffiliated lodges increasingly saw the sense of belonging to a larger organisation, they usually found that the Antients practice was closer to their own, although it was known for lodges to change allegiance from the Antients to the Moderns. The fact that the practices eventually adopted by the United Grand Lodge largely reflect those of the Antients is attributable to Dermott's industry.&lt;ref name="Clarke" /&gt;

While the emergence of the Antients simply consolidated a division in English Freemasonry, a schism occurred within the Moderns in 1777/78. While this only involved one lodge, it was the oldest and most prestigious in the constitution, and its Master the Moderns' most respected author and historian. [[William Preston (Freemason)|William Preston]] was already in dispute with the Grand Secretary over the royalties to the new Book of Constitutions he had just written. Some members of his Lodge of Antiquity (formerly the Goose and Gridiron, or the Old Lodge of St. Pauls), having attended church as masons, walked back to the lodge in their regalia. Three brethren saw fit to report this to the Moderns Grand Lodge as an unauthorised masonic parade. Preston, the Master of Antiquity, sided with the accused, arguing that since the lodge was one of the original four, it had only subscribed to the original constitutions, and did not require any other authority to hold a parade. For this, he was promptly expelled. Antiquity responded by expelling the three who had complained. At least half of the lodge seceded to the Grand Lodge of All England at York, quoting Article 39 of Payne's regulations, that the Landmarks of the order must be preserved in any new regulations of Grand Lodge (alluding to their own rights and privileges). Antiquity became, for the period of separation, "the Grand Lodge of All England South of the River Trent", warranting at least two lodges in its own right. The dispute was not resolved until May 1789, when Preston and his brethren were received back into the Moderns with much feasting and fanfare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/uk_grand_lodges.html Pietre Stones] Various Grand Lodges, H.

A similar situation arose in Scotland. Seniority was assigned according to the dating of lodge minutes, and due to a fire, Kilwinning records started at 1642, somewhat later than the Lodge of St. Mary's Chapel in Edinburgh. Offended by being recognised as only the second lodge in the constitution, Lodge Mother Kilwinning withdrew from the Grand Lodge of Scotland in 1743, and did not rejoin until 1807. During this period, Kilwinning functioned as yet another Grand Lodge, chartering about 70 lodges in Scotland and abroad. While the two Grand Lodges ignored each other at an official level, there does not appear to have been any real animosity, with no bar on masons visiting lodges in the competing jurisdiction. One Kilwinning member became Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grandlodgescotland.com/masonic-subjects/lodge-histories/172-lodge-mother-kilwinning-no0 Grand Lodge of Scotland] Lodge Mother Kilwinning no. 0, retrieved 2 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The Lodge at Melrose, claiming an antiquity at least as great as Kilwinning, simply ignored the Grand Lodge of Scotland, again chartering daughter lodges, with the Master being addressed as "Grand Master". They finally joined the national body on 25 February 1891 as The Lodge Of Melrose St. John No 1 bis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://1bis.co.uk/theoriginsofscottishfreemasonryandinparticularthoseofthelodgeofmelrosestjohnno1bis.pdf The Lodge of Melrose No 1 bis] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020190645/http://1bis.co.uk/theoriginsofscottishfreemasonryandinparticularthoseofthelodgeofmelrosestjohnno1bis.pdf |date=20 October 2013 }} P.

In the wake of the French Revolution, the British Government became uneasy about possible revolutionary conspiracies. Amongst other repressive measures, [[William Pitt The Younger|Pitt's]] government proposed to introduce the Unlawful Societies Act in 1799, which declared that any body which administered a secret oath was illegal. Acting quickly, a delegation representing the Ancients, Moderns and the Grand Lodge of Scotland arranged a meeting with the Prime Minister. The delegation included the [[John Murray, 4th Duke of Atholl|Duke of Atholl]], Grand Master of the Ancients, and Past Grand Master Mason of the Grand Lodge of Scotland, and the [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Earl of Moira]], Acting Grand Master of the Moderns (the Grand Master being the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]]). As a result of this meeting, Freemasons were specifically excluded from the act, although lodges were obliged to return a list of members to the local Clerk of the Peace, a practice which continued until 1967. It also demonstrated that the two rival Grand Lodges could act together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/prescott15.html Pietre Stones] The Unlawful Societies Act of 1799, Dr Andrew Prescott, from M.

===Establishment of Freemasonry in North America===
{{main article|History of Masonic Grand Lodges in North America|Prince Hall Freemasonry}}
[[File:Henry Price.jpg|thumb|Henry Price, "Provincial Grand Master of New England and Dominions and Territories thereunto belonging"]]
In 1733, Henry Price, the Provincial Grand Master over all of North America for the [[Premier Grand Lodge of England|Grand Lodge of England]], granted a charter to a group of Boston Freemasons. This lodge was later named [[St. John's Lodge (Boston)|St. John's Lodge]] and was the first duly constituted lodge in America.&lt;ref name="American_Freemasons_Colonial America"&gt;''American Freemasons: Three Centuries of Building Communities'' Mark A. Tabbert, [[New York University Press]], New York: 2005, pp. 33–47.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1733 and 1737 the Grand Lodge in England warranted Provincial Grand Lodges in Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. [[Benjamin Franklin]] re-issued Anderson's 1723 constitutions as Provincial Grand Master of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt; Franklin had written in the Pennsylvania Gazette of 8 December 1730 of the several lodges of freemasons already in the "province", joined St. John's Lodge in Philadelphia the following year, and in 1732 was Junior Grand Warden of the Grand Lodge of Philadelphia. All this before the "first" lodge in North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masonicworld.com/education/files/artoct02/benjamin_franklin.htm Masonic World] BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, FREEMASON, from SHORT TALK BULLETIN, Vol.XI October, 1933 No.10, retrieved 16 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baigent"&gt;The Temple and the Lodge, M.

Correspondence from John Moore, the collector for the port of Philadelphia and himself a Mason, indicate that Masonic Lodges were meeting in Philadelphia in 1715. The present Grand Lodge has the Carmick manuscript, a handwritten copy of the [[Masonic manuscripts#Old Charges|ancient charges]] dating from 1727, and headed "The Constitutions of St. John's Lodge". Colonel Daniel Coxe was made Provincial Grand Master of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania by the Grand Lodge of England in 1730, with effect from 24 June (St. John the Baptist's day) for two years. It is unclear whether he was in America or England at the time, but he was present at Grand Lodge, at the Devil Tavern in London, on 29 January 1731, where he is minuted as ''Provincial Grand Master of North America''. There is no record of his chartering any lodges, but he arranged for St. John's Lodge to double as a Provincial Grand Lodge, and appointed his successor in 1731, a year early. Notwithstanding the acceptance of Coxe as their first Provincial Grand Master, it has been suggested that the formation of the new Grand Lodge by consenting pre-existing lodges makes it a Grand Lodge by "Immemorial right", and a sister lodge to the Grand Lodges of England Scotland and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/pennsylvania_freemasonry.html Pietre-Stones] An Overview of Early Freemasonry in Pennsylvania, Francis Vicente, retrieved 15 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Early Freemasonry in Pennsylvania, Harry S. Borneman, 1933, reprinted 2010, Kessinger Pub.&lt;/ref&gt;

North America would have many independent lodges in the 18th century. Authorisation, which later would become a Warrant, took time and expense, especially in the period when the nearest Grand Lodge was on the other side of the Atlantic. Many lodges became "self starters", and only applied for Grand Lodge authorisation when they were reasonably confident that the lodge would survive for more than a few years. [[George Washington]] was initiated into the Lodge of Fredericksburg in 1752.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/washington_g/washington_g.html Masonic biography of George Washington, from the website of the Grand Lodge of BC&amp;Y]&lt;/ref&gt; The same lodge was chartered by the Grand Lodge of Scotland in 1758.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; The first properly chartered "Scottish" lodge was only two years earlier, being the Lodge of St. Andrews in Boston. Members included [[Paul Revere]] and [[Joseph Warren]], and (according to some) later lodge outings included the [[Boston Tea Party]].&lt;ref name="Baigent" /&gt;

Many lodges were attached British Army regiments. The Moderns may have been wary of warranting lodges without a permanent address, so there was only one Grand Lodge of England warrant in the continental army from 1775–1777. The Antients and the Grand Lodge of Scotland were slightly better represented, but the overwhelming majority of regimental lodges held warrants from the Grand Lodge of Ireland.&lt;ref name="Baigent" /&gt; Thus it was that a group of African Americans, having been rejected by the lodges in Boston, were initiated into Lodge No 441 on the register of the Grand Lodge of Ireland, which was attached to the 38th Foot (later the 1st Staffordshire). These 15 men formed African Lodge No 1, as the British departed, leaving them a permit to do almost everything but admit new masons. Two of the members were seafarers, and obtained entrance to a lodge in London, being recognised as regularly initiated Masons. This enabled their master, Prince Hall, to apply to the Moderns for a charter, which was duly granted on 29 September 1784, now as [[African Lodge No. 459]]. Such was the success of the lodge that it became a Provincial Grand Lodge, and Prince Hall the Provincial Grand Master. After his death, the provincial lodges reconstituted themselves as a grand lodge (African Grand Lodge), becoming Prince Hall Grand Lodge in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princehall.org/History/Ray%20Colemans%20History.pdf Prince Hall History Education Class by Raymond T.

==Royal Arch Freemasonry==
{{main article|Holy Royal Arch}}
The majority of this article deals with craft, or "blue lodge" masonry, the three degrees that are common to all masonic lodges and jurisdictions. Further degrees are usually outside of the jurisdiction of Grand Lodges, involve separate ceremonies, and are regulated by different [[Masonic bodies]]. The number and names of the "chivalric" orders and degrees depend on the local tradition of Freemasonry, and have varied greatly over the years.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; The oldest of these, and the most universal, is the [[Royal Arch Masonry|Royal Arch Chapter]] (the [[Holy Royal Arch]] in England).

Although some masonic writers have attempted to see Royal Arch symbolism in material from the 1720s, the earliest definite reference is to a Royal Arch in a procession in Dublin preceding the master and held aloft by two "Excellent Masons". In 1744 it is mentioned as a degree in Dr. Dassigny's "Serious and Impartial Inquiry".&lt;ref name="Knoop" /&gt;

[[Laurence Dermott]], the guiding force behind the Ancients Grand Lodge, claimed to have been made a Royal Arch Mason in Dublin in 1746. He referred to it as the fourth degree, and campaigned to have it recognised as such. This happened just after he died, and only twenty years before the union of the Ancients and Moderns. The Moderns, on the other hand, had created a separate Grand Chapter in 1765 to deal with the degree, and wished to keep it separate from pure craft masonry. This would be a point of contention as the two jurisdictions moved towards union. The second of the articles of union stated that there were but three degrees in "pure Ancient Masonry", but included the Royal Arch in the third degree. The degree continues to be administered by a separate Grand Chapter, and until a revision in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;On 10 November 2004, after deliberations by a special working party, the Supreme Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons of England at its regular meeting in London formally overturned the compromise position of 1813, and declared the Holy Royal Arch to be a separate degree in its own right, albeit the natural progression from the Third Degree, and the completion of "''pure ancient Masonry''", which consists of the three Craft degrees and the Holy Royal Arch. Words in the ritual which propounded the earlier compromise position and led to misinterpretations were removed by mandatory regulation. There are many public-domain documents verifying these changes (e.g. [http://www.pglel.co.uk/Secretariat/secretaries_scribee/ra_rit_rev.pdf here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024053316/http://www.pglel.co.uk/Secretariat/secretaries_scribee/ra_rit_rev.pdf |date=24 October 2013 }} is merely one example of many which demonstrate the requirement for removal of all references to the former compromise linking the Royal Arch with the Third Degree). The official position of the Supreme Grand Chapter today is that the "''Royal Arch is the continuation of Craft Freemasonry''" [http://www.supremegrandchapter.org.uk/about-royal-arch-masonry/what-is-royal-arch-masonry] in that sense, "''“pure ancient Masonry” can be seen as a journey of self-knowledge and discovery with the Royal Arch completing the practical lessons of the Craft by a contemplation of man’s spiritual nature''." [http://www.pglm.org.uk/web/provincial-grand-chapter/]&lt;/ref&gt; English Master Masons were simply told that the degree of the Holy Royal Arch completes their third degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/beresiner3.html Pietre-Stones] The Fourth Degree in the Craft, Yasha Beringer, retrieved 19 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/england_grand_lodge.html Pietre-Stones] Facsimile of Articles of Union, retrieved 20 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest Irish records of the ritual indicate that Royal Arch Chapters originally administered three degrees. The first was based on the refurbishment of the first [[Temple of Solomon|temple]] by [[Josiah|King Josiah]]. The second was a short bridge to the third, which was based on the rebuilding of the temple after the [[Babylonian captivity|exile]]. Most jurisdictions base the modern Royal Arch ritual on the post-exilic legend. In 1864, the Grand Chapter of Ireland decided to base their ritual on the reign of Josiah, the main practical difference being the names of the officers.&lt;ref name="Knoop" /&gt;

==19th century Freemasonry==

===Union of 1813===
In 1809, the Grand Lodge of England (the Moderns) set up a "Lodge of Promulgation". Its purpose was to "revert to the Ancient Land Marks of the Society" and to promulgate those landmarks amongst the brethren. One of its members was the [[Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex|Duke of Sussex]], the Master of the Lodge of Antiquity, No 2, and sixth son of [[George III of England|George III]].&lt;ref Name ="YB1"&gt;[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/beresiner1.html Pietre-Stones] Lodges of Instruction, Yasha Beresiner, retrieved 17 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The result of their labours was a reply to the Ancients in 1811 that the Grand Lodge had resolved to "return to the Ancient Landmarks...when it should be ascertained what those ancient landmarks and obligations were."  Both Grand Lodges moved visibly towards union, forming committees to negotiate the precise terms. The main sticking point was the inability of the Ancients' committee to decide anything without reporting back to a quarterly meeting of their own Grand Lodge. In October 1812, the Ancients allayed the frustration of the Moderns by granting their commissioners full powers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ugle.org.uk/news-events-page/all-quarterly-communication-speeches/yet-more-of-our-yesterdays/ UGLE Quarterly Communication, 14 December 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815091905/http://www.ugle.org.uk/news-events-page/all-quarterly-communication-speeches/yet-more-of-our-yesterdays/ |date=15 August 2012 }} retrieved 17 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after this, the [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Earl of Moira]] resigned as acting Grand Master of the Moderns, due to his appointment as Governor General of India. His successor was the Duke of Sussex, who became Grand Master the next January on the resignation of his brother, the Prince of Wales. On 1 December 1813, the [[John Murray, 4th Duke of Atholl|Duke of Atholl]] ceded the leadership of the Ancients to the [[Prince Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent and Strathearn|Duke of Kent]], the older brother of Sussex and the father of [[Queen Victoria]]. Kent had already presided over the union of the Ancients and Moderns in Canada, accomplished by the brutally simple expedient of merging the lodges of the Moderns with the nearest lodge of the Ancients. The Moderns in Canada had simply ceased to exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopediaoffreemasonry.com/u/union-of-1813-the/ Encyclopedia of Freemasonry] retrieved 17 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; These two men oversaw the union in 1813 to form the [[United Grand Lodge of England]], with the Duke of Sussex appointed as Grand Master of the new body.

The actual process of unification continued for some years, first with the Lodge of Reconciliation (1813–1816), made up of two lodges, one of each constitution, which ironed out some sort of ritual acceptable to the two parties. The work of this lodge was spread by the Stability Lodge of Instruction (1817) and fleshed out by the Emulation Lodge of Improvement (1823 onwards).&lt;ref name="YB1" /&gt; The new Grand Lodge essentially ended up with the ritual of the Ancients and the infrastructure of the Moderns. While the "Emulation Ritual" became the standard, many variations still exist which, while mutually recognisable, present many flavours of Masonic ritual within the English Constitution.&lt;ref name="Clarke" /&gt;

===Morgan affair and decline in American Freemasonry (1826–c.1850)===
{{main article|William Morgan (anti-Mason)}}

In 1826, [[William Morgan (anti-Mason)|William Morgan]] disappeared from Batavia, New York, after threatening to expose Freemasonry's secrets, causing some to claim that he had been murdered by Masons. What exactly occurred has never been conclusively proven.  However, Morgan's disappearance – and the minimal punishment received by his kidnappers – sparked a series of protests against Freemasons throughout the United States, especially in New York and neighboring states. The protracted backlash led to many masons leaving the craft. The Grand Lodge of New York controlled 227 lodges in 1827, but only 41 in 1835.&lt;ref name="BCMorgan"&gt;[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/morgan_affair.html Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon] The Morgan Affair, Reprinted from The Short Talk Bulletin — Vol. XI, March, 1933 No. 3, retrieved 17 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the leadership of [[Thurlow Weed]], an anti-Masonic and anti-[[Andrew Jackson]] (Jackson was a Mason) movement grew to become the [[Anti-Masonic Party]] and made the ballot for the presidency in 1828 while gaining the support of such notable politicians as [[William H. Seward]]. Its influence was such that other Jackson rivals, including [[John Quincy Adams]], denounced the Masons. In 1847, Adams wrote a widely distributed book titled ''Letters on the Masonic Institution'' that was highly critical of the Masons. In 1832, the party fielded [[William Wirt (Attorney General)|William Wirt]] as its presidential candidate. This was rather ironic because he was, in fact, a Freemason, and even gave a speech at the Anti-Masonic convention defending the organization. The party only received seven electoral votes. Three years later, the party had disbanded in every state save [[Pennsylvania]], as other issues such as [[slavery]] had become the focus of national attention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/MorganAffair.html Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon] The Morgan Affair aftermath, retrieved 17 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Freemasons during the Civil War===
The fortunes of American Freemasonry declined sharply following the Morgan Affair, only to rebound as the force of the Anti-Masonic movement sputtered out in the mid-1830s. By the late 1850s, masonry in America was the subject of renewed popular interest and lodge membership, which had bottomed out during the anti-Masonic period began to rise.  By the time of the American Civil War, U.S. freemasonry tripled its membership from 66,000 to 200,000 members in over 5000 lodges nationwide.  This surge in membership helps explain, at least in part, the many stories of Masonic fraternisation during the American Civil War, which include accounts of Masonic soldiers and sailors rescuing enemy combatants who identified themselves as members of the fraternity.  Masonic incidents are also recorded involving Freemasons burying their own with Masonic formalities during battle, as well as aid and special treatment given to Masonic POWs.&lt;ref name="Halleran"&gt;Michael Halleran. ''The Better Angels of Our Nature: Freemasonry in the American Civil War''  (Univ. of Alabama Press, 2010), 38, 90, 106, 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Civil War, American Freemasonry flourished along with other fraternal organizations during the so-called "[[Golden age of fraternalism|Golden Age of Fraternalism]]" from approximately 1870 to 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McBride|first1=Harriett W|title=The Golden Age of Fraternalism: 1870 to 1910|url=http://phoenixmasonry.org/Golden%20Age%20of%20Fraternalism.pdf|website=Phoenix Masonry|accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In France, the number of Freemasons grew from 10,000 in 1802, when Napoleon gave it semi-official status, to 20,000 in 1889, 32,000 in 1908, 40,000 in 1926, and about 60,000 in 1936.  At an early stage, nearly all the lodges were affiliated with the Radical party.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Zeldin, ''France 1848–1945: volume II Intellect, Taste and Anxiety'' (1977) p 1032&lt;/ref&gt;  Zeldin argues that in 19th century France:
: Freemasonry appealed first of all to people who liked mystic ritual, esoteric symbolism and fancy uniforms, and to those who like to have somewhere to discuss ideas and meet like-minded friends.  Increasingly however it became an organization which politicians used for electoral purposes in which civil servants joined in order to further their chances of promotion, which hotel-keepers found useful as a way of enlarging their clientele and where businessmen could make deals and find jobs for their sons.&lt;ref&gt;Zeldin, ''France 1848–1945'' (1977) 2:1032–33&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumors were rife, especially in conservative circles, that the order secretly ran the government, and was the main source of materialistic and anti-clerical propaganda.  Zeldin concludes that was a "vast exaggeration."  The details are known because the Vichy regime in 1941 seized the archives, and failed to find significant evidence. While the order did support anti-clerical campaigns, it did not initiate them.  Its primary role was to serve as a social club which the members could rise in the world, and get 10% discounts in shops owned by fellow Masons.  The chapters provided some charity and life insurance.  In 1904 [[Affaire Des Fiches|a scandal erupted]] because the [[Grand Orient de France]] lodges were asked by the Radical government to secretly collect information about the religious and political affiliations of army officers, with a view to blocking the promotion of Catholics. When the news leaked out, the government was forced to resign.  The concern with Radical politics gradually declined, and it disappeared after 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Zeldin,  ''France 1848–1945' ' (1977) 2:1033–34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Larkin, ''Church and state after the Dreyfus affair: the separation issue in France'' (1974) pp. 138–41&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ernest Belfort Bax]], Freemasons were responsible for the last serious attempt at conciliation between Versailles and the [[Paris Commune]] on 21 April 1871. They were received coldly by [[Adolphe Thiers]], who assured them that, though Paris was given over to destruction and slaughter, the law should be enforced, and he kept his word. A few days after they decided, in a public meeting, to plant their banner on the ramparts and throw in their lot with the Commune. On the 29th, accordingly, 10,000 of the brethren met (55 lodges being represented), and marched to the Hôtel de Ville, headed by the Grand Masters in full insignia and the banners of the lodges. Amongst them the new banner of Vincennes was conspicuous, bearing the inscription in red letters on a white ground, "Love one another." A balloon was then sent up, which let fall at intervals, outside Paris, a manifesto of the Freemasons. The procession then wended its way through the boulevards and the Champs Elysées to the Arc de Triomphe, where the banners were planted at various points along the ramparts. On seeing the white flag on the Porte Maillot the Versaillese ceased firing, and the commander, himself a Freemason, received a deputation of brethren, and suggested a final appeal to Versailles, which was agreed to.

===Great Schism===
{{See also| Regular Masonic jurisdictions|Continental Freemasonry}}
The schism between French and English Freemasonry is popularly supposed to originate at a general assembly of the Grand Orient de France in September 1877. Accepting a recommendation in a report by a Protestant minister, Frédéric Desmons, the assembly, on a majority vote, amended its constitutions to read "Its principles are absolute liberty of conscience and human solidarity". The words "Its principles are the existence of God, the immortality of the soul and human solidarity" were struck out. The [[United Grand Lodge of England]]'s (UGLE) response was a resolution in March 1878 that "That the Grand Lodge, whilst always anxious to receive in the most fraternal spirit the Brethren of any Foreign Grand Lodge whose proceedings are conducted according to the Ancient Landmarks of the Order, of which a belief in T. G. A. O. T. U. (the Great Architect of the Universe) is the first and most important, cannot recognise as ‘true and genuine’ Brethren any who have been initiated in Lodges which either deny or ignore that belief". Relations between the two governing bodies effectively ceased, purportedly because the French body had removed the requirement for a belief in a supreme being. However, UGLE had just entered into fraternal relations with the [[Grand Orient of Belgium]], which had removed the Great Architect from its constitutions in 1872, a relationship which lasted until 1921. The reasons for the split are obviously deeper and more complex than the official records suggest.&lt;ref name="Bernheim1"&gt;[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/bernheim27.html#_ednref39 Pietre-Stones] Alain Bernheim, My Approach to Masonry, text of lecture delivered on 26 May 2011 in Sheffield before the members of the Manchester Association for Masonic Research. Retrieved 10 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutual distrust between English and French Freemasons was apparent in the 1850s, when French Masonic refugees were appalled at the relationship between UGLE and the Monarchy, aristocracy, and the Anglican church. The English distrusted the mysticism of French Masonry, and its ideals of Fraternity and Universality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/prescott13.html Piette Stones] Andrew Prescott, A Body without a Soul?

Desmons' review had been prompted by the [[Lausanne Congress of Supreme Councils of 1875]]. Eleven countries were represented at an attempt to unify the [[Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite]]. An agreement on colonial lodges would have seen the UGLE as the only recognised masonic grand lodge in British colonies, in spite of the Scottish and Irish lodges already flourishing there. The Scottish delegate, Mackersy, who also represented Greece, withdrew. His letter of withdrawal cited his jurisdiction's disagreement with any shift from the requirement for a member to believe in a personal god. He said that he believed the congress would agree to a non-requirement, or the specification of a vague universal principle. In avoiding ratifying a treaty which would obliterate Scottish lodges in the colonies, Mackersy sparked a debate that led to the removal of a requirement for an open volume of scripture in French lodges. The English interpretation of this as a slide towards atheism was probably partly prompted by the difficult political relationship between Britain and France at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/masonic_foreign_recognitions.html#Appendix%20B Pietre-Stones] Jack Buta, The God Conspiracy, The Politics of Grand Lodge Foreign Relations.retrieved 25 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The gulf between UGLE and GOdF widened due to the French body's active engagement in politics, on a personal and organisational level. All discussion of politics and religion is expressly banned from English lodges.&lt;ref name="Bessel recognition"&gt;see [http://bessel.org/masrec/france.htm Masonic U.S. Recognition of French Grand Lodges in the 20th century] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060410074658/http://bessel.org/masrec/france.htm |date=10 April 2006 }}, Paul M. Bessel. retrieved 10 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legacy of the Schism====
During the [[First World War]], many American lodges relaxed their opposition to the Grand Orient de France to allow servicemen to engage with other masons while in France. Many of these continue to allow their members to associate with continental Freemasons.&lt;ref name="Bessel recognition" /&gt;

In December 1913, UGLE recognised a new Grand Lodge in France. The basis of this recognition was the series of obligations that the ''Independent and Regular National Grand Lodge of France'' (later the [[Grande Loge Nationale Française]]) imposed on its lodges. These were —
*1. While the Lodge is at work the Bible will always be open on the altar.
*2. The ceremonies will be conducted in strict conformity with the Ritual of the "Regime Rectifié" which is followed by these Lodges, a Ritual which was drawn up in 1778 and sanctioned in 1782, and with which the Duke of Kent was initiated in 1792.
*3. The Lodge will always be opened and closed with invocation and in the name of the Great Architect of the Universe. All the summonses of the Order and of the Lodges will be printed with the symbols of the Great Architect of the Universe.
*4. No religious or political discussion will be permitted in the Lodge.
*5. The Lodge as such will never take part officially in any political affair but every individual Brother will preserve complete liberty of opinion and action.
*6. Only those Brethren who are recognised as true Brethren by the Grand Lodge of England will be received in Lodge.
These "basic principles" were accepted by UGLE itself in 1929, and written into its constitutions.&lt;ref name="Bernheim1" /&gt;

===Taxil hoax===
{{main article|Taxil hoax}}
Between the years 1885 and 1897, [[Léo Taxil]] maintained a hoax against both Freemasonry and the Roman Catholic Church, by making increasingly outlandish claims regarding Freemasonry. On 19 April 1897, Taxil called a press conference at which he claimed he would introduce the "author" of his books to the press. He instead announced that his revelations about the Freemasons were fictitious.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/taxil_confession.html Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon Leo Taxil] A Hoax, Reprinted from an article by Edmond Frank in l'Illustration, 1 May. 1897– No. 2827, Paris, France, retrieved 27 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the material is still used on some anti-Masonic websites today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masonicinfo.com/taxil.htm Masonic Info] Leo Taxil, the Tale of the Pope and the Pornographer, retrieved 17 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freemasonry under totalitarian regimes (1900–present)===
{{main article|Suppression of Freemasonry}}
Many twentieth century [[totalitarian]] regimes, both Fascist and Communist, have treated Freemasonry as a potential source of opposition due to its secret nature and international connections (not to mention its promotion of religious and political tolerance through its symbolism). It has been alleged by Masonic scholars that the language used by the totalitarian regimes is similar to that used by some modern critics of Freemasonry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/fascism.html Pietre Stones] The Annihilation of Freemasonry, Sven G.

'''Slang in Hong Kong''' evolves over time, and mainly comprises [[Cantonese]], [[English language|English]], or a combination of the two.

==Introduction==

The word '''slanguage''' consists of two original English words, [[slang]] and [[language]]. ‘Slang’ means informal usage in vocabulary and idioms that is characteristically more metaphorical, while ‘Language’ means a body of words in which people who are of the same culture, community or nation share the system.

Hong Kong slanguage consists of commonly used terms or trendy expressions in Hong Kong which are in Cantonese only. This type of language is used both in written and spoken words. As Hong Kong slanguage mainly consists of trendy expressions that are commonly used in the Internet and other social medias, it broadly represents the culture or social issues which take place in a certain period of time. Therefore, Hong Kong slanguage usually changes with time and some words would be eliminated over time. Due to usage of non-standard words or phrases, Hong Kong slanguage is still relatively less accepted and understood by Cantonese speakers.

==History==

The rise of local slanguage is a social phenomenon in Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, there are approximately 5400000 active Internet users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internetworldstats.com/asia/hk.htm]"Internet Usage and Population Statistics"&lt;/ref&gt; This immense number of Internet users apparently gives an impetus to the evolution of Hong Kong online forums and the birth of Hong Kong slanguage.

The trend started with the development of local online forums. The two dominating online forums in Hong Kong, HK Golden Forum and HK Discuss Forum, were found in 2000 and 2003 respectively. As the number of Hong Kong forum users gradually increased, members of younger generation found typing formal Chinese words and sentences on the Internet to be old-fashioned, developing distinct and innovative online buzzwords.

In the beginning, those words were exclusively used on online forums and amongst younger Internet users. Unexpectedly, some new phrases spread extensively, becoming commonplace, not only amongst Hong Kong teenagers, but also enjoying use widespread use among Hong Kong adults and in the media. Some of these new terms are now widely accepted by the public and are classified as ‘Hong Kong slanguage’.

In 2008 Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination, local slanguage was included in the questions by the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority in Chinese paper five. In 2009, a form-three student was found using slang terms in the Territory-wide System Assessment. Hong Kong slanguage has had a broad impact in the lives of Hongkongese people, far outreaching its Internet origins.&lt;ref&gt;黃家樑 [http://paper.wenweipo.com/2008/05/14/ED0805140014.htm]"通識路路通：「潮語」考學生 是否鼓勵做「潮人」"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

There are several examples of the usage of slanguage.

1.Hea -To describe someone who stroll around without any purpose and heedless of everything.

2.Fong Fei Gei (放飛機) - Literally to fly an aeroplane; to fail to turn up on a date.

3.Sap buk (十卜) -  Sounds like the English word, support. To cheer someone up.

4.Fu Luk (負碌) -  Sounds like the English word, fluke. Meaning something that is unlikely or surprising and only happens because of luck.

5.O jui (O嘴) - Literally to have an O shaped mouth; to feel astonishing and stunning, meaning Oh my Gosh. Thus, the jaw drops and the shape of the mouth resembles the English letter, O.

6.Cyun Zoei(串嘴)  - To behave arrogantly and rudely.

7.Wat Gei(屈機) - Literally to break a machine into two pieces. An adjective describing someone who is tremendous and excellent.

8.Sing Ne (升呢) - To gain a higher level in video game.

9.Baan Haai (扮蟹) - To behave pretentiously

10.Pan Faan (噴飯) - Something makes you burst into laughter.

11.Maai Fei Fat (賣飛佛) - My favorite.

12.Dik Hon (滴汗) - Literally to sweat. To feel speechless and reticent.

13.Taat Zoek (撻著) - Literally to ignite a fire. Two people fall in love and become a couple.

14.Gwai Cuk (龜速) - Literally 'turtle speed'; extremely slow speed.

==Relationship with Cantonese and Culture==

From the aspect of linguistics, the lexicon of Hong Kong slanguage can be classified into three types, including compounds, simple words and accessional words. Over 80% of 237 Hong Kong slang words consist of compound, a word with more than one radical element, which indicates that Cantonese slangs are usually composed by the existing words. Aforementioned examples such as Fong Fei Gei (放飛機), Cyun Zoei(串嘴) and Wat Gei(屈機) are all compounds, while Hea, Sap buk (十卜), Fu Luk(負碌) are simple words, which cannot be broken down into different words and O jui (O嘴) is accessional word.&lt;ref&gt;鄧思穎 [http://www.swtang.net/doc/paper_2009_ciujyu.pdf]"香港「潮語」構詞的初探"&lt;/ref&gt;

Cantonese has an array of unique features and the classification in usage of Cantonese is particular. The components of a Chinese word relate to each other compactly. For instance, radicals in Chinese symbolize various gestures and actions. It paves a way for Cantonese to possess strong expressiveness.&lt;ref&gt;劉達衡 [http://www.orientaldaily.on.cc/cnt/lifestyle/20140220/00322_001.html]"廣東話洗冤"&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, people nurture and create slanguage in Cantonese easily. Some words simply do not exist in other Chinese dialects. For example, there is no formal Chinese character for jiu(𡁻), which is verbal Cantonese for chew in which the word is simply made up by Hong Kong people.&lt;ref&gt;William Fu [http://aslue.blogspot.hk/2009/09/use-of-chiu-yu-in-hong-kong.html]"The use of "chiu yu"(潮語)in Hong Kong"&lt;/ref&gt;

Teenagers, being the most innovative and dynamic language users in a society, create new terms frequently. The younger generation is probably more responsible for spreading slangs directly because they are much more susceptible to the world of television comedies, commercials, comic strips and so on. This explains why a large portion of slang expressions originate and spread out from youth communities. It also states that slanguage is not only for communication, but also for recording the current culture. Thus, through the wide acceptance of Hong Kong slanguage, the culture of Hong Kong teenagers and perhaps even the entire society can be realized.

Antão Azedo took an Indian slave named Heitor to Evora, who along with another slave was from [[Bengal]] were among the 34 Indian slaves in total who were owned by Tristão Homem, a nobleman in 1544 in Evora. Manuel Gomes previously owned a slave who escaped in 1558 at age 18 and he was said to be from the "land of Prester John of the Indias" named Diogo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Câmara Municipal de Évora |year=1997|location=|language=Portuguese|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JrlIAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=escravo+evora+antonio&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=chines |quote= |volume=Volume 2 of Colecção "Novos estudos eborenses" Volume 2 of Novos Estudos e Eborenses|page=21|title=Os escravos em Évora no século XVI|author=Jorge Fonseca|isbn=9729696535|editor=|edition=|accessdate=2014-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Evora, men were owned and used as slaves by female establishments like [[convent]]s for [[nuns]]. A capelão do rei, father João Pinto left an Indian man in [[Porto]] where he was picked up in 1546 by the Evora-based Santa Marta convent's nuns to serve as their slave. However, female slaves did not serve in male establishments, unlike vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Câmara Municipal de Évora |year=1997|location=|language=Portuguese|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JrlIAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=escravo+evora+antonio&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%C3%ADndio |quote= |volume=Volume 2 of Colecção "Novos estudos eborenses" Volume 2 of Novos Estudos e Eborenses|page=45|title=Os escravos em Évora no século XVI|author=Jorge Fonseca|isbn=9729696535|editor=|edition=|accessdate=2014-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40567">'''International broadcasting''' is [[broadcasting]] that is deliberately aimed at a foreign, rather than a domestic, audience. It usually is broadcast by means of [[longwave]], [[mediumwave]], or (more usually) [[shortwave]] radio, but in recent years has also used direct [[satellite]] broadcasting and the [[internet]] as means of reaching audiences.

Although radio and television programs do travel outside national borders, in many cases reception by foreigners is accidental. However, for purposes of [[propaganda]], transmitting religious beliefs, keeping in touch with colonies or expatriates, education, improving trade, increasing national prestige, or promoting tourism and goodwill, broadcasting services have operated '''external services''' since the 1920s.

== History ==
International broadcasting, in a limited extent, began during [[World War I]], when German and British stations broadcast press communiqués using [[Morse code]]. With the severing of Germany's undersea cables, the wireless telegraph station in [[Nauen]] was the country's sole means of long-distance communication.

The US Navy Radio Service radio station in New Brunswick, Canada, transmitted the '[[Fourteen Points]]' by wireless to Nauen in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Wood 2000: 56&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, Nauen station broadcast the news of the abdication of [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] on November 10, 1918.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Government Printing Office. ''International Law Documents: Neutrality, Conduct and Conclusion of Hostilities''. 1919, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origins ===
[[File:Guglielmo Marconi 1901 wireless signal.jpg|thumb|[[Guglielmo Marconi]] carried out the first short wave transmissions over a long distance.]]
[[Guglielmo Marconi]] pioneered the use of [[short wave]] radio for long distance transmissions in the early 1920s. Using a system of parabolic reflector antennae, Marconi's assistant, [[Charles Samuel Franklin]], rigged up a large antenna at [[Poldhu|Poldhu Wireless Station]], [[Cornwall]], running on 25&amp;nbsp;kW of power. In June and July 1923, wireless transmissions were completed during nights on 97 meters from Poldhu to Marconi's yacht ''Elettra'' in the [[Cape Verde|Cape Verde Islands]].&lt;ref name="Bray"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3h7R36Y0yFUC|title=Innovation and the Communications Revolution: From the Victorian Pioneers to Broadband Internet|author=John Bray|year=2002|publisher=IET|pages=73–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; High speed shortwave telegraphy circuits were then installed from London to Australia, India, South Africa and Canada as the main element of the [[Imperial Wireless Chain]] from 1926.&lt;ref name="Bray"/&gt;

The Dutch began conducting experiments in the shortwave frequencies in 1925 from [[Eindhoven]]. The radio station [[PCJJ]] began the first international broadcasting on March 11, 1927 with programmes in Dutch for colonies in the [[Dutch West Indies]] and [[Dutch East Indies]] and in German, Spanish and English for the rest of the world. The popular [[Happy Station]] show was inaugurated in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bureauafrique.nl/autresdepartements/africa/Radionetherlandsturns60/aboutrnw_history ''History of Radio Netherlands''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228214010/http://www.bureauafrique.nl/autresdepartements/africa/Radionetherlandsturns60/aboutrnw_history |date=2009-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, Marconi also turned his attention toward long distance broadcasting on shortwave. His first such broadcasts took place to commemorate [[Armistice Day]] in the same year. He continued running a regular international broadcast that was picked up around the world, with programming from the [[2LO]] station, then run by the [[BBC]]. The success of this operation caught the BBC's attention, and rented out a shortwave transmitting station in [[Chelmsford]], with the callsign G5SW, to Marconi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontheshortwaves.com/Wavescan/wavescan090920.html|title=Daventry Calling - 2: Station G5SW Chelmsford }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BBC Empire Service]] was finally inaugurated on December 19, 1932, with transmissions aimed towards Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;BBC World Service. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/history/timeline.shtml ''World Service timeline''].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expansion ===
Other notable early international broadcasters included [[Vatican Radio]] (February 12, 1931), [[Voice of Russia|Radio Moscow]], the official service of the Soviet Union (this has since been renamed the [[Voice of Russia]], following the collapse of the Soviet Union). Clarence W. Jones started transmitting on Christmas Day, 1931 from Christian missionary radio station [[HCJB]] in [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]]. Broadcasting in South Asia was launched in 1925 in [[Ceylon]] - [[Radio Ceylon]], now the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] is the oldest in the region.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-17049, Joseph Goebbels spricht.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Joseph Goebbels]] headed [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]]. International broadcasting was an important element in [[Nazi propaganda]].]]
Shortwave broadcasting from [[Nauen]] in Germany to the USA, Central and South America, and the Far East began in 1926. A second station, [[Zeesen short-wave transmitter (1931)|Zeesen]], was added in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Wood 2000: 49&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1932, the German [[Reichspost]] assumed control of the Nauen station and added to its shortwave and longwave capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Wood 2000:57&lt;/ref&gt; Once [[Adolf Hitler]] assumed power in 1933, shortwave, under the ''Auslandsrundfunk'' (Foreign Radio Section), was regarded as a vital element of [[Nazi propaganda]].

German shortwave hours were increased from two hours a day to 18 per day, and eventually twelve languages were broadcast on a 24-hour basis, including English. A 100 [[kilowatt]] transmitter and antenna complex was built at [[Zeesen]], near Berlin. Specialty target programming to the United States began in 1933, to South Africa, South America, and East Asia in 1934, and South Asia and Central America in 1938. German propaganda was organized under [[Joseph Goebbels]], and played a key role in the [[German annexation of Austria]] and the [[Munich Crisis]] of 1938.

In 1936, the [[International Telecommunication Union|International Radio Union]] recognized Vatican Radio as a "special case" and authorized its broadcasting without any geographical limits. On December 25, 1937, a Telefunken 25-kW transmitter and two directional antennas were added. Vatican Radio broadcast over 10 frequencies.&lt;ref name="Levillain 2002: 1600"&gt;Levillain 2002: 1600&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Spanish Civil War]], the Nationalist forces received a powerful [[Telefunken]] transmitter as a gift of Nazi Germany to aid their propaganda efforts, and until 1943 [[Radio Nacional de España]] collaborated with the Axis powers to retransmit in Spanish news from the official radio stations of Germany and Italy.

=== World War II ===
During the [[Second World War]], Russian, German, British, and Italian international broadcasting services expanded. In 1942, the United States initiated its international broadcasting service, the [[Voice of America]]. In the Pacific theater, General [[Douglas MacArthur]] used shortwave radio to keep in touch with the citizens of the Japanese-occupied Philippine Islands.

Several announcers who became well known in their countries included [[British Union of Fascists]] member [[William Joyce]], who was one of the two "[[Lord Haw-Haw]]"s; Frenchmen [[Paul Ferdonnet]] and [[André Olbrecht]], called "the traitors of [Radio] Stuttgart"; and Americans [[Frederick William Kaltenbach]], "Lord Hee-Haw", and [[Mildred Gillars]], one of the two announcers called "[[Axis Sally]]". Listeners to German programs often tuned in for curiosity's sake—at one time, German radio had half a million listeners in the U.S.--but most of them soon lost interest. Japan had "Tokyo Rose", who broadcast Japanese propaganda in English, along with American music to help ensure listeners.

During World War II, Vatican Radio's news broadcasts were banned in Germany. During the war, the radio service operated in four languages.&lt;ref name="Levillain 2002: 1600"/&gt;

The British launched [[Radio SEAC]] from Colombo, [[Ceylon]] (Sri Lanka) during World War II. The station broadcast radio programs to the allied armed forces across the region from their headquarters in Ceylon.

Following the war and German partition, each Germany developed its own international broadcasting station: [[Deutsche Welle]], using studios in [[Cologne]], West Germany, and [[Radio Berlin International]] (RBI) in East Germany. RBI's broadcasts ceased shortly before the reunification of Germany on October 3, 1990, and Deutsche Welle took over its transmitters and frequencies.

=== Cold War Era ===
The Cold War led to increased international broadcasting (and [[radio jamming|jamming]]), as Communist and non-Communist states attempted to influence each other's domestic population. Some of the most prominent Western broadcasters were the [[Voice of America]], the [[BBC World Service]], and the (covertly) CIA-backed [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]. The Soviet Union's most prominent service was [[Radio Moscow]] (now the Voice of Russia) and China used [[Radio Peking]] (then [[Radio Beijing]], now [[China Radio International]]). In addition to the U.S.-Soviet cold war, the Chinese-Russian border dispute led to an increase of the numbers of transmitters aimed at the two nations, and the development of new techniques such as playing tapes backwards for reel-to-reel recorders.

West Germany resumed regular shortwave broadcasts using Deutsche Welle on May 3, 1953. Its Julich transmitter site began operation in 1956, with eleven 100-kW Telefunken transmitters. The Wertachtal site was authorized in 1972 and began with four 500-kW transmitters. By 1989, there were 15 transmitters, four of which relayed the Voice of America.&lt;ref&gt;Wood 2000: 51&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in East Germany, the Nauen site began transmitting Radio DDR, later Radio Berlin International, on October 15, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Wood 2000: 58&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these states, international broadcast services grew in Europe and the [[Middle East]]. Under the presidency of [[Gamal Nasser]], [[Egypt]]ian transmitters covered the Arab world; Israel's service, [[Kol Yisrael]], served both to present the Israeli point of view to the world and to serve the [[Jewish diaspora]], particularly behind the [[Iron Curtain]].

[[Radio RSA]], as part of the South African Broadcasting Corporation, was established in 1966 to promote the image of South Africa internationally and reduce criticism of apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;Horwitz 2001: 287&lt;/ref&gt; It continued in 1992, when the post-apartheid government renamed it [[Channel Africa]].

Ironically, the isolationist [[Albania]] under [[Enver Hoxha]], virtually a [[hermit kingdom]], became one of the most prolific international broadcasters during the latter decades of the Cold War, with [[Radio Tirana]] one of the top five broadcasters in terms of hours of programming produced.

=== Today ===
At the end of the [[Cold War]], many international broadcasters cut back on hours and foreign languages broadcast, or reemphasized other language services. For example, in 1984, Radio Canada International broadcast in English, French, German, Spanish, Czech/Slovak, Hungarian, Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian. In 2005, RCI broadcast in English, Chinese, Arabic, Russian, and Spanish. There is a bigger trend towards TV (e.g. BBC World News, NHK World, CCTV-9) and news websites. Some services, such as Swiss Radio International, left shortwave altogether and exist in Internet form. In addition, new standards, such as [[Digital Radio Mondiale]], are being introduced, as well as sending programs over the Web to be played back later, as "[[podcast]]s".

International broadcasting using the traditional audio-only method will not cease any time soon due to its cost efficiencies. However, international broadcasting via television is considered more strategically important at least since the early 2000s.

The [[BBC World Service]] was the first broadcaster to consider setting up a satellite television news and information channel as far back as 1976, but ceded being the first to [[CNN]] (that had primary access to [[Canada]] soon after launch). The defunct BBC World Service [[Antigua]] Relay Station was built in 1976, but its setup costs were not known to have been part of the BBCWS decision processes at the time.

In the early 1990s, many international (as well as domestic) 24-hour news and information channels launched as part of the post-[[Cold War]] prosperity bubble. There was another burst of global news channels launching in the late 2000s as part the developing world trying to catch up with the developed world in this area.

== Reasons for international broadcasting ==
Broadcasters in one country have several reasons to reach out to an audience in other countries. The examples given below are not meant to be exhaustive, but are illustrative.

One clear reason is for ideological, or [[propaganda]] reasons. Many government-owned stations portray their nation in a positive, non-threatening way. This could be to encourage business investment and/or tourism to the nation. Another reason is to combat a negative image produced by other nations or internal dissidents, or insurgents. [[Radio RSA]], the broadcasting arm of the apartheid South African government, is an example of this. A third reason is to promote the ideology of the broadcaster. For example, a program on [[Voice of Russia|Radio Moscow]] from the 1960s to the 1980s was ''What is Communism?''

A second reason is to advance a nation's foreign policy interests and agenda by disseminating its views on international affairs or on the events in particular parts of the world. During the [[Cold War]] the American [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Free Europe]] and [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Liberty]] and Indian Radio [[All India Radio|AIR]] were founded to broadcast news from "behind the Iron Curtain" that was otherwise being censored and promote dissent and occasionally, to disseminate [[disinformation]]. Currently the US operates similar services aimed at [[Cuba]] and the [[People's Republic of China]].

The [[BBC World Service]], the [[Voice of America]], [[All India Radio]] and other western broadcasters have emphasized news broadcasts, particularly to countries that are experiencing repression or civil unrest and whose populations are unable to obtain news from non-government sources. In the case of emergencies, a nation may broadcast special programs overseas to inform listeners what is occurring. During Iraqi missile strikes on Israel during the 1991 Gulf War, [[Kol Israel]] relayed its domestic service on its shortwave service.

Besides ideological reasons, many stations are run by religious broadcasters and are used to provide religious education, religious music, or worship service programs. For example, [[Vatican Radio]], established in 1931, broadcasts such programs. Another station, such as [[HCJB]] or [[Trans World Radio]] will carry brokered programming from evangelists. In the case of the [[Broadcasting Services of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]], both governmental and religious programming is provided.

Stations also broadcast to international audiences for cultural reasons. Often a station has an official mandate to keep expatriates in touch with the home country. Many broadcasters often relay their national domestic service on shortwave for that reason. Other reasons include teaching a foreign language, such as [[Radio Exterior de España]]'s Spanish class, ''Un idioma sin fronteras'', or the Voice of America's broadcasts in [[Special English]]. In the case of major broadcasters such as the [[BBC World Service]] or [[Radio Australia]], there is also an educational outreach.

An additional reason for international broadcasting is to maintain contact with a country's citizens travelling abroad or expatriates who have emigrated and share news from home as well as cultural programming. This role of external shortwave broadcasting has declined as advances in communications have allowed expatriates to read news from home and listen and watch to domestic broadcasts in their own language via the internet and satellite. A number of international services such as the original [[BBC Empire Service]], [[Radio Netherlands]], France's Poste Colonial (now [[Radio France International]]) and others were founded in part with the goal of helping draw overseas empires closer to the [[mother country]] and provide closer cultural and communication connections between the home country and its colonies, a role that became largely obsolete due to [[decolonization]].

== Means to reach an audience ==
Because of this many broadcasters are discovering they can reach a wider audience through other methods (particularly the internet and satellite television) and are cutting back on (or even entirely dropping) shortwave.

An international broadcaster has several options for reaching a foreign audience:
* If the foreign audience is near the broadcaster, high-power longwave and mediumwave stations can provide reliable coverage.
* If the foreign audience is more than 1,000 kilometers away from the broadcaster, shortwave radio is reliable, but subject to interruption by adverse solar/geomagnetic conditions.
* An international broadcaster may use a local mediumwave or FM radio or television relay station in the target country or countries.
* An international broadcaster may use a local shortwave broadcaster as a relay station.
* Neighboring states, such as [[Israel]] and [[Jordan]], may broadcast television programs to each other's viewing public.

An international broadcaster such as the BBC, Radio France International or Germany's Deutsche Welle, may use all the above methods. Several international broadcasters, such as [[Swiss Radio International]], have abandoned shortwave broadcasting altogether, relying on Internet transmissions only. Others, such as the BBC World Service, have abandoned shortwave transmissions to North America, relying on local relays, the Internet, and satellite transmissions

=== Mediumwave and longwave broadcasts ===
Most radio receivers in the world receive the [[mediumwave]] band (530&amp;nbsp;kHz to 1710&amp;nbsp;kHz), which at night is capable of reliable reception from 150 to 2,500&amp;nbsp;km distance from a transmitter. Mediumwave is used heavily all over the world for international broadcasting on a formal and informal basis.

In addition, many receivers used in Europe and Russia can receive the [[longwave]] broadcast band (150 to 280&amp;nbsp;kHz), which provides reliable long-distance communications over continental distances.

=== Shortwave broadcast ===
[[Shortwave receiver]]s are capable of receiving [[shortwave]] transmissions (2,000 to 30,000&amp;nbsp;kHz or 2 to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz). Depending on time of day, season of year, solar weather and Earth's geomagnetic field, a signal might reach around the world.

[[Image:RCI-BC-ANZ431-dbu.png|thumb|300px|This sort of map is used by radio engineers to determine the best frequencies to reach international audiences on shortwave bands. In this case, a transmitter is sited in the Southern [[Vancouver Island]], using a frequency of 12095 kHz and transmitting at the 500 kW power level. The picture shows a good signal over the Southern Pacific. The signal fades out as it approaches the [[Eastern states of Australia|East Coast of Australia]].]]

In previous decades shortwave (and sometimes high-powered mediumwave) transmission was regarded as the main (and often the ''only'') way in which broadcasters could reach an international audience. In recent years the proliferation of technologies such as satellite broadcasting, the Internet, and rebroadcasts of programming on AM and FM within target nations has meant that this is no longer necessarily the case.

Transmitter output power has increased since 1920. Higher transmitter powers do guarantee better reception in the target area. Higher transmitter power in most cases counteracts the lesser effects of [[radio jamming|jamming]].
* 1950s : 100&amp;nbsp;kW
* 1960s : 200&amp;nbsp;kW, early 1960s (2 x 100&amp;nbsp;kW 'twinned')
* 1970s : 300&amp;nbsp;kW, but many 250&amp;nbsp;kW transmitters sold
* 1980s : 500&amp;nbsp;kW sometimes transmitters were "doubled up" to produce 1000&amp;nbsp;kW output
* 1980s-present: 600&amp;nbsp;kW single, 1200&amp;nbsp;kW from twinned transmitters.

International stations generally use special [[HRS type antennas|directional antennas]] to aim the signal toward the intended audience and increase the [[Effective radiated power|effective power]] in that direction. Use of such antennas for international broadcasting began in the mid-1930s and became prominent by the 1950s. By using antennas which focus most of their energy in one direction, a modern station may achieve the equivalent, in that direction, of tens of millions of [[watt]]s of radio power.

=== Digital Audio Broadcasting ===
Some international broadcasters have become available via [[Digital Audio Broadcasting]] (DAB) in Europe in the 1990s, and in a similar limited way in the Americas via in-band FM ([[IBOC]]) DAB systems in the US in the 2000s. This is a popular method to reach listeners in cars that would otherwise not be accessible during that part of the day. However, in terms of the global international broadcasting audience the DAB listener base is very small—one can assume that it is less than 2% of the listener base globally.

=== Television ===
International broadcasting via 24 hour TV news channels has its origins in North America in the early 1980s. CNN technically was the first 24-hour international news channel as it was made available in Canada soon after launch. The BBC World Service considered setting up a global TV news channel as far back as 1975, but abandoned the idea for internal reasons.

Notwithstanding a large number of international 24-hour television news and information broadcasters, the television percentage of viewers is still fairly small when compared to global radio listener numbers.

The rural populations of Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia (as well as East Asia) have radio listener bases that are far larger than the largest international TV broadcaster could hope for, yet they could be considered underserved since the end of the Cold War (when these regions had more radio broadcasts targeted at them).

==== Streaming video sites ====
Many international television broadcasters (as well as domestic television broadcasters) have set up accounts on streaming video sites like [[YouTube]] to allow their news and information broadcasts to be globally distributed. The viewer numbers for these sites may seem huge. Cable, TVRO and terrestrial television broadcasters probably have 100 to 1,000 times larger audiences for their international broadcasting content.

International broadcasters known to maintain their own streaming video sites (not authoritative):

* [[Al Jazeera English]]
* [[BBC World News]]
* [[CNN International]]
* [[DD News]]
* [[Deutsche Welle|DW]]
* [[France 24]]
* [[i24NEWS]]
* [[RT (TV network)|RT]] (formerly known as “Russia Today”)
* [[Sky News]]
* [[WION (TV channel)|WION]] (World is One News)

=== RSS feeds and email ===
Many international broadcasters (television or radio) can reach "unreachable" audiences via email and RSS feeds. This is not at all unusual, as the first commonly agreed international broadcast was a Morse Code telegram transmitted from US President Wilson to the German Kaiser (mid-1918) via a high powered longwave transmitter on the US East Coast (this important event in international broadcasting history was described in depth in the IEEE "The History of International Broadcasting" first volume). As Morse Code is considered to be a data format, with email and RSS merely being refinements of the technology it can be said that international broadcasting has a deep relationship with modern-day datacasting.

The reach of RSS and email for international broadcasters is not really known that well, especially considering that emails get forwarded. The numbers for active RSS and email audiences are probably 5 to 20 times larger than for streaming video. It may take into the 2010s to get meaningful numbers with respect to the size of these audiences for assorted technical reasons related to the RSS and email technologies.

Email and RSS feeds can traverse telecommunications barriers that streaming video cannot, thus the larger expected audience numbers. The global economic downturn of 2008-2009 will probably increase the email and RSS audience sizes as fewer people will be able to afford high speed internet connections in North America, Western Europe and the Asia-Pacific regions.

== Listeners ==
An international broadcaster may have the technical means of reaching a foreign audience, but unless the foreign audience has a reason to listen, the effectiveness of the broadcaster is in question.

One of the most common foreign audiences consists of expatriates, who cannot listen to radio or watch television programs from home. Another common audience is [[Shortwave listening|radio hobbyists]], who attempt to listen to as many countries as possible and obtain verification cards or letters (''QSLs''). These audiences send letters and in response few radio stations write them back. These kind of Listeners often take part in weekly and monthly quizzes and contests started by many radio stations. A third audience consists of journalists, government officials, and key businesspersons, who exert a disproportionate influence on a state's foreign or economic policy.

A fourth, but less publicized audience, consists of intelligence officers and agents who monitor broadcasts for both [[open-source intelligence]] clues to the broadcasting state's policies and for hidden messages to foreign agents operating in the receiving country. The BBC started its monitoring service in Caversham, Reading in 1936 (now [[BBC Monitoring]]). In the United States, the [[United States Director of National Intelligence|DNI]] [[Open Source Center]] (formerly the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s [[Foreign Broadcast Information Service]]) provides the same service. Copies of OSC/FBIS reports can be found in many U.S. libraries that serve as government depositories. In addition, a number of hobbyists listen and report "spook" transmissions.

Without these four audiences, international broadcasters face difficulty in getting funding. In 2001, for example, the BBC World Service stopped transmitting shortwave broadcasts to North America, and other international broadcasters, such as YLE Radio Finland, stopped certain foreign-language programs.

However, international broadcasting has been successful when a country does not provide programming wanted by a wide segment of the population. In the 1960s, when there was no BBC service playing rock and roll, Radio Television Luxembourg ([[RTL Group|RTL]]) broadcast rock and roll, including bands such as [[the Beatles]], into the United Kingdom. Similar programming came from an unlicensed, or "pirate" station, [[Radio Caroline]], which broadcast from a ship in the international waters of the North Sea.

== Restricting reception ==
In many cases, governments do not want their citizens listening to international broadcasters. In Nazi Germany, a major propaganda campaign, backed by law and prison sentences, attempted to discourage Germans from listening to such stations. The practice was made illegal in 1939.&lt;ref name="Hughes and Mann 2002: 93"&gt;Hughes and Mann 2002: 93&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the German government sold a cheap, 76-[[Reichsmark]] [[Volksempfänger|"People's Receiver"]], as well as an even cheaper 35-Reichsmark receiver,&lt;ref name="Hughes and Mann 2002: 93"/&gt; that could not pick up distant signals well.&lt;ref name="Graef 2005: 36"&gt;Graef 2005: 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea was copied by Stalin's Soviet Union, which had a nearly identical copy manufactured in the Tesla factory in Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref name="Graef 2005: 36"/&gt;
In North Korea, all receivers are sold with fixed frequencies, tuned to local stations.

The most common method of preventing reception is [[radio jamming|jamming]], or broadcasting a signal on the same frequencies as the international broadcaster. Germany jammed the BBC European service during the Second World War. Russian and Eastern European jammers were aimed against [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Free Europe]], other Western broadcasters, and against Chinese broadcasters during the nadir of Sino-Soviet relations. In 2002, the Cuban government jammed the [[Voice of America]]'s [[Radio y Televisión Martí|Radio Martí]] program and the Chinese government jammed [[Radio Free Asia]], [[Voice of America]], [[Radio Taiwan International]] as well broadcasts made by adherents of [[Falun Gong]].

North Korea restricts most people to a single fixed frequency mediumwave receiver; those who met political requirements and whose work absolutely required familiarity with events abroad were allowed shortwave receivers.&lt;ref&gt;Martin 2006: 495&lt;/ref&gt; Another method of reaching people with government radio programming, but not foreign programming, is the use of radio broadcasting by direct broadcasting to loudspeakers.&lt;ref&gt;Goetz, Philip W. ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1991 edition, {{ISBN|0-85229-400-X}}, p 315&lt;/ref&gt;
David Jackson, director of the Voice of America, noted "The North Korean government doesn't jam us, but they try to keep people from listening through intimidation or worse. But people figure out ways to listen despite the odds. They're very resourceful."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, David. "The Future of Radio II". ''World Radio TV Handbook'', 2007 edition. 2007, Billboard Books. {{ISBN|0-8230-5997-9}}. p 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet another method of preventing reception involves moving a domestic station to the frequency used by the international broadcaster. During the Batista government of Cuba, and during the Castro years, Cuban medium-wave stations broadcast on the frequencies of popular South Florida stations. In October 2002, Iraq changed frequencies of two stations to block the Voice of America's [[Radio Sawa]] program.

Jamming can be defeated by using very efficient transmitting antennas, carefully choosing the transmitted frequency, changing transmitted frequency often, using [[Single-sideband modulation|single sideband]], and properly aiming the receiving antenna.

[[File:It's OK to be white.jpg|right|thumb|An "It's OK to be white" sticker]]
'''It's okay to be white'''&lt;ref name="adl" /&gt; or '''It's OK to be white''' ('''IOTBW''') is a slogan based on a poster campaign organized on the American [[imageboard]] [[4chan]] in 2017, as a "proof of concept" that a "harmless message" would cause a media backlash.&lt;ref name="McGladrey2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180625104237/http://www.cfweradio.ca/on-air/blogs/dustin-mcgladrey/post/its-okay-to-be-white-was-a-planned-hate-crime-from-4chan-internet-trolls/|title="It's Okay To Be White" Was A Planned Hate Crime From 4chan Internet Trolls|last=McGladrey|first=Dustin|date=November 1, 2017|accessdate=June 25, 2018|work=[[CFWE-FM]]|publisher=[[Aboriginal Multi-Media Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost" /&gt; Posters and stickers containing the sentence "It's okay to be white" have been placed in streets in the United States as well as on campuses in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="adl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/11/03/its-okay-to-be-white-signs-and-stickers-appear-on-campuses-and-streets-across-the-country/|title='It's okay to be white' signs and stickers appear on campuses and streets across the country|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan has been spread by Fox News host Tucker Carlson, and racist groups including [[neo-Nazi]]s and [[white supremacist]]s.&lt;ref name=newsweek /&gt;

==Background==
The suggestion for the use of posters with the saying originated on the message board [[4chan]] with the intent of provoking reactions. The saying was later spread by [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] groups and politically organized racists, including former [[Ku Klux Klan]] Grand Wizard [[David Duke]] and ''[[The Daily Stormer]]''.&lt;ref name=newsweek&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/neo-nazi-david-duke-backed-meme-was-reported-tucker-carlson-without-context-714655|title=The 'It's Okay to Be White' meme was backed by neo-Nazis and David Duke|date=November 19, 2017|website=newsweek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report by the [[Anti-Defamation League|ADL]] states that the phrase itself has a history within the white supremacist movement going back to 2001 when it was used as the title of a song by a [[white power music]] group called Aggressive Force as well as fliers with the phrase being spotted in 2005 and the slogan being used by a member of the [[United Klans of America]].&lt;ref name=adl&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adl.org/blog/from-4chan-another-trolling-campaign-emerges|title=From 4Chan, Another Trolling Campaign Emerges|website=Anti-Defamation League}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academia===
The [[University of Regina]] declared the posters "divisive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torontosun.com/news/national/its-ok-to-be-white-posters-too-divisive-for-regina-university-could-be-considered-vandalism|title='It's OK To Be White' posters too 'divisive' for Regina University, could be considered vandalism|date=November 23, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/university-of-regina-is-removing-its-okay-to-be-white-posters-from-campus|title=University of Regina is removing It's OKAY To Be White posters from campus|date=November 23, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; University President [[Vianne Timmons]] said: "Simply put, these signs have no place at our university."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/it-s-okay-to-be-white-poster-pops-up-at-u-of-r-security-investigating-1.4415514|title='It's okay to be white' posters pop up at U of R; security investigating|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A spokesman for a [[Waterloo Region District School Board]] commented: "Our schools are [[safe space]]s. We want to see them be safe for all of our children, so to see this kind of thing emerge is a worry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kitchener.ctvnews.ca/it-s-okay-to-be-white-signs-posted-outside-schools-1.3666093|title='It's okay to be white' signs posted outside schools|date=November 6, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the signs were found at [[Washington State University]], Phil Weiler, Vice President of University Communications, said that "one could reasonably believe the intention of the signs is to set a sense of fear and intimidation on campus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='It's ok to be white' signs found on WSU campus|url=http://www.king5.com/news/its-ok-to-be-white-signs-found-on-wsu-campus/495719052|accessdate=December 1, 2017|publisher=KREM-TV|date=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Executive director of Washington State University's Office of Equity and Diversity responded to the posters by saying: "In my mind, it's a nonthreatening statement", further stating: "Sure, it's OK to be white. It's OK to be African-American. It's OK to be Latino. It's OK to be gay."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nadauld|first1=Taylor|title='It's okay to be white' posters spark mixed responses|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/nov/30/its-okay-to-be-white-posters-spark-mixed-responses/|accessdate=December 1, 2017|publisher=The Spokesman-Review|date=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Utah]] said: "If, indeed, these tactics are meant to silence our work in diversity and inclusion, please know we shall not be deterred."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.studyinternational.com/news/ok-to-be-white/|title=US: University fights back against 'It's OK To Be White' posters on campus|date=November 7, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Concordia College (Moorhead, Minnesota)|Concordia College]] said that their President was planning a meeting where students could "discuss the matter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/2017/11/04/its-ok-to-be-white-signs-put-up-at-concordia-college-in-moorhead/|title='It's OK to be white' signs put up at Concordia College in Moorhead|date=November 4, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police were contacted regarding the flyers being posted at [[University of California, Berkeley]]. A police department spokesperson said "the signs did not constitute a [[hate crime]] because they did not target a specific race and because no criminal act was committed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Richardson|first1=Bradford|title='It's OK to be white'  campaign rankles higher education|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/nov/10/its-ok-be-white-campaign-rankles-higher-education/|accessdate=November 10, 2017|publisher=The Washington Times|date=November 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Upwelling|first1=Elise|title='It's Okay to be White' posters found at UC Berkeley|url=http://www.dailycal.org/2017/11/07/okay-white-posters-found-uc-berkeley/|accessdate=November 10, 2017|publisher=The Daily Californian|date=November 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, [[Lucian Wintrich]] attempted to give a speech titled "It's OK To Be White" at [[University of Connecticut]] as an invited speaker of the school's [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] club. The speech was protested and came to an end when a protester, employed as the director of career services at [[Quinebaug Valley Community College]],&lt;ref name="BBCcharged"/&gt; grabbed Wintrich's speech papers from the podium and Wintrich grabbed her, resulting in [[breach of peace]] charges against Wintrich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Colli|first1=George|title=Conservative speaker arrested at UConn blames university security, protesters|url=http://wtnh.com/2017/11/29/conservative-speaker-arrested-at-uconn-blames-students/|accessdate=December 5, 2017|publisher=News 8|date=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2017, the charges against Wintrich were dropped and the woman who took the papers was charged with attempted sixth-degree [[larceny]] and [[disorderly conduct]]. She stated through her attorney she took Wintrich's speech as a form of protest, describing Wintrich's "It's OK To Be White" speech as "hateful language".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rondinone|first1=Nicholas|title=Quinebaug College Adviser Charged After Lucian Wintrich's UConn Event|url=http://www.courant.com/breaking-news/hc-br-catherine-gregory-lucian-wintrich-uconn-event-arrest-20171211-story.html|accessdate=December 11, 2017|publisher=Hartfort Courant|date=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCcharged"&gt;{{cite news|title=US woman charged for stealing 'OK to be white' speech|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42313641|accessdate=December 17, 2017|publisher=BBC|date=December 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
While some media sources reacted in the way the original authors on 4chan had expected,&lt;ref name="clevescene"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.clevescene.com/scene-and-heard/archives/2017/11/01/4chan-troll-movement-hits-rocky-river-with-its-ok-to-be-white-signs|author=Eric Sandy|title=4chan Troll Movement Hits Rocky River with 'It's OK To Be White' Signs &amp;#124; Scene and Heard: Scene's News Blog|website=clevescene.com|accessdate=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; others like [[TheBlaze]] described the campaign as [[trolling]], or a prank.&lt;ref name="theblaze"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/11/04/maryland-high-school-investigating-flyers-with-simple-5-word-message-about-white-people/|title=Maryland High School investigating flyers with simple 5-word message about white people|website=TheBlaze|accessdate=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tucker Carlson]] on [[Fox News]] defended the campaign in a segment entitled "High school Fliers Create Shock and Horror". Carlson asked: "What’s the correct position? That it’s not okay to be white?",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mediamatters.org/video/2017/11/03/tucker-carlson-defends-4chans-its-okay-be-white-campaign/218454|title=Tucker Carlson defends 4chan's "it's okay to be white" campaign|date=November 3, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghYmmrKCx_s|title=Tucker Carlson "Is It Okay To Be White"?|first=|last=Very Fake News|date=November 4, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=November 30, 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; but ''[[Newsweek]]'' writer Michael Hayden said Carlson was helping to spread neo-Nazi propaganda by defending the posters, saying the slogan is being promoted by [[neo-Nazis]] and [[white supremacists]].&lt;ref name=newsweek/&gt; Writing for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Janell Ross commented on the poster campaign saying "the white victim construct is one that experts say, not so long ago, only had traction in avowed white supremacists, segregationists and neo-Nazi circles. But today, it animates open and anonymous public discussions of race and shapes the nation’s politics."&lt;ref name=washingtonpost/&gt; ''[[The Root (magazine)|The Root]]'' compared it with the children's book ''[[It's Okay To Be Different]]'' and said, "but white folks have taken that beautiful sentiment and distorted it to suit their infinite need to center themselves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theroot.com/it-s-okay-to-be-white-signs-papered-all-over-the-coun-1820156469|title='It's Okay to Be White' Signs Papered All Over the Country Because Everyone Knows White People Are Oppressed|first=Angela|last=Helm|publisher=|accessdate=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The online magazine ''Jacobite'' argued that the goal of the meme was to trick certain [[political progressives]] into attacking an "anodyne" message and thus elicit a "second-order reaction" from outsiders perplexed by the idea that the concept of being white is somehow unacceptable, instead of ignoring the message. The writer claims that the meme attempts to exploit its progressive opponents psychologically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Duffy |first1=Nathan |title=THE ASYMMETRIC MEME WARFARE OF "IT’S OK TO BE WHITE" |url=https://jacobitemag.com/2017/11/17/the-asymmetric-meme-warfare-of-its-ok-to-be-white/ |website=Jacobite |accessdate=July 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Guardian]] columnist Jason Wilson argued that "It's OK To Be White" was devised by white supremacists in order to stoke overreaction from the left, sow confusion, embed a racist agenda in the mainstream media, and ultimately invite a backlash against anti-racist activism. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/16/its-ok-to-be-white-is-not-a-joke-its-careless-politicians-helping-the-far-right|title=‘It’s OK to be white’ is not a joke, it’s careless politicians helping the far right {{!}} Jason Wilson|last=Wilson|first=Jason|date=2018-10-16|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In other media===
According to ''[[ThinkProgress]]'', T-shirts with the slogan were put on sale at [[Shopify]] by [[Milo Yiannopoulos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thinkprogress.org/milo-shirt-shopify-1cd8ca659046/|title=Shopify is helping monetize the latest white nationalist meme|publisher=|accessdate=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australian parliament motion===
On October 15, 2018, right-wing politician [[Pauline Hanson]] proposed an "It's OK to be white" motion in the [[Australian Senate]] intended to acknowledge the "deplorable rise of anti-white racism and attacks on Western civilization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bourke |first1=Latika |title=Coalition backs Pauline Hanson's 'It's OK to be white' motion |url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/coalition-backs-pauline-hanson-s-it-s-ok-to-be-white-motion-20181015-p509tw.html |accessdate=October 15, 2018 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=October 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was supported by most senators from the governing [[Coalition_(Australia)|Liberal-National Coalition]], but was defeated 31-28 by opponents who called it a racist slogan from the white supremacist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pauline Hanson says 'it's OK to be white' |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/pauline-hanson-says-it-s-ok-to-be-white |accessdate=October 15, 2018 |work=SBS News |agency=AAP |publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Karp |first1=Paul |title='OK to be white': Australian government senators condemn 'anti-white racism' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/15/ok-to-be-white-australian-government-senators-condemn-anti-white-racism |accessdate=October 15, 2018 |work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, the motion was brought up again and rejected unanimously by senators in attendance, with its initial supporters saying they had voted for it due to an administrative error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/16/australian-senators-inadvertently-back-far-right-motion-saying-its-ok-to-be-white|title=Australian senators say error led to backing far-right motion saying 'it's OK to be white'|date=October 16, 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=October 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Japanese Dominicans''' are [[People of the Dominican Republic|Dominican]] citizens of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] origin.&lt;ref name="AssociatedPress" /&gt; [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] estimates the Japanese descended population in the country at roughly 800. {{Asof|2013}}, there were also 873 '''Japanese nationals in the Dominican Republic'''.&lt;ref name="MOFA" /&gt; These consist of both the settlers who have retained their [[Japanese nationality law|Japanese citizenship]], and more recent expatriate residents. The [[Dominican Republic]] has the [[Japanese Caribbean|largest]] Japanese population in the Caribbean and Central American region.

==Migration history==
Migration from Japan to the Dominican Republic did not begin until after [[World War II]]. With the end of the [[occupation of Japan|Allied occupation]], Japan regained control over its migration policy. The Dominican Republic signed a treaty with Japan in 1956 to accept migrants for agricultural labour, one of the earliest in a series of treaties signed by Japan's newly established emigration bureau.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Azuma|2002|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the Japanese government's perspective, the goal of the emigration policy was to improve Japan's international reputation by having Japanese people contribute to the development of foreign countries. Latin America was the only potential outlet for emigration; the [[United States]]' [[Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907]] and [[Immigration Act of 1924]] and [[Australia]]'s [[White Australia policy]] eliminated the option of settlement in those two countries, while [[anti-Japanese sentiment]] in Asia due to Japan's wartime atrocities meant that none of those countries would accept Japanese migrants either.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Azuma|2002|pp=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rafael Trujillo]], dictator of the Dominican Republic since 1930, for his part sought to use European and later Japanese migrants as a demographic buffer against black [[Haiti]]an [[squatters]], by settling them along the country's western border with Haiti.&lt;ref name="Horst"&gt;{{harvnb|Horst|Asagiri|2000|p=336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese migrants came to the Dominican Republic with the intention of permanent settlement in the country.&lt;ref name="Horst" /&gt; They had been promised furnished houses, land ready for planting, and credit until the first harvest.&lt;ref name="Azuma" /&gt; More than 200 families totaling 1,319 people braved the month-long ocean voyage and arrived from 1956 to 1959.&lt;ref name="Riley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AssociatedPress" /&gt; However, the May 1961 assassination of [[Rafael Trujillo]] and a subsequent [[Dominican civil war|civil war]], plunged the country into chaos and political violence, leaving many of the governmental promises of assistance and protection broken.&lt;ref name="AssociatedPress" /&gt; The migrants entirely abandoned five of their eight settlements.&lt;ref name="Horst_a"&gt;{{harvnb|Horst|Asagiri|2000|p=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1961, 70 families fled to other [[Latin America]]n countries which had agreed with the Japanese government to resettle them, including [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], and [[Bolivia]], while 111 other families returned to Japan.&lt;ref name="Azuma" /&gt;

Japanese settlement in the Dominican Republic never grew to a very large scale; protests over the extreme hardships and broken government promises faced by the initial group of migrants set the stage for the end of state-supported labour emigration in Japan.&lt;ref name="Azuma"&gt;{{harvnb|Azuma|2002|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1962, just 276 Japanese remained in the country.&lt;ref name="Horst_a" /&gt; Of the forty-seven families which settled in [[Constanza, Dominican Republic|Constanza]] and the nearby valley, just seven remained. However, they clung tenuously to their land, improving irrigation facilities and introducing the Japanese ''[[Bokashi composting|bokashi]]'' composting technique. By the 1990s, Constanza had become a major area of agricultural production, growing over 90% of the country's vegetables.&lt;ref name="Riley" /&gt;

==Political implications==
The failure of migration to the Dominican Republic marked an important turning point in Japanese emigration policy. Along with rising wages in Japan due to labour shortages, the widespread reporting of the tragedy faced by emigrants to the Dominican Republic dampened popular and official enthusiasm for emigration; the total number of emigrants from Japan fell by nearly two-thirds from 1961 to 1962, and in 1968, Japan's [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] finally abolished its Central-South America Emigration Bureau.&lt;ref name="Azuma" /&gt; Backlash would continue for decades; in 2000, more than 170 of the migrants sued the Japanese government, charging that it lied to them about conditions in the Dominican Republic in order to trick them into leaving Japan. The Japanese government settled the lawsuit in July 2006, paying [[United States dollar|US$]]17,000 to each plaintiff as well as US$10,000 to non-plaintiff migrants; then-[[Prime Minister of Japan]] [[Junichiro Koizumi]] made a formal statement apologising for the "immense suffering due to the government's response at the time".&lt;ref name="AssociatedPress" /&gt;

According to Japanese diplomat Teruyuki Ishikawa, the presence of the remaining Japanese immigrants and their descendants is the major reason why the Dominican Republic is the biggest recipient of official development aid from Japan.&lt;ref name="Riley" /&gt;

==Language and culture==
Some of the initial Japanese migrants to the Dominican Republic still speak little [[Spanish language|Spanish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Riley|1999}}: "But some of Constanza's inhabitants don't speak Spanish. You're more likely to hear Japanese in a suburb called Colonia Japonesa."&lt;/ref&gt; Their spoken Japanese is also full of archaisms, such as the [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese-derived]] {{nihongo|''shashinki''|写真機}} instead of the modern [[Gairaigo|loanword]] {{nihongo|''kamera''|カメラ}} for "camera".&lt;ref name="AssociatedPress" /&gt;

==Education==
The ''Colegio Japones de Santo Domingo'' is a [[Hoshuko|supplementary Japanese education program]] in [[Santo Domingo]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.mext.go.jp/a_menu/shotou/clarinet/002/006/001/002/003.htm 中南米の補習授業校一覧（平成25年4月15日現在）]" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6PSyYHUCO Archive]).

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar}}
'''Jewish Motorcyclists Alliance''' (JMA) is an [[umbrella organization]] for [[Jewish]] [[motorcycle club]]s.  
The JMA's affiliate clubs consist of official, organized [[Motorcycle club|motorcycle riding clubs]] with JMA membership criteria.&lt;ref&gt;specified in the JMA Charter &amp; By-laws, section 5&lt;/ref&gt; A member club designates a delegate to serve on the JMA Council.

The JMA is the home of Jewish motorcyclists from around the world. The JMA is a worldwide association of Jewish motorcycle clubs that upon its formation included organized groups in the United States, Canada, Israel, England and Australia, representing over 2,500 Jewish motorcycle enthusiasts. The common thread is the religion; however membership or admittance to the member clubs is not dictated by faith or brand of motorcycle: riders of any denomination or brand of bike are welcome.

== History ==
A meeting was set up by King Ken of the Semites On Bikes and Scott Wynn of the Chai Riders. The original meeting took place at Mike's Famous Harley Davidson in Delaware on October 3, 2004. Five of those original clubs made the meeting. There was a total of 69 bikes and about 100 people. Although it was planned as just a "Meet and Greet", from that meeting grew the concept of the first Ride to Remember, honoring the anniversary of [[V-E Day|the freedom]] from the [[Extermination camp|death camps]] in Europe. The Ride to Remember took place in Washington, DC, in May 2005 under the auspices of the newly named Jewish Motorcyclists Alliance (JMA). Five of the six original clubs were the founding members of the JMA. The founding members are Chai Riders, Hillel's Angels, King David Bikers, Tribe (Washington D.C.), and Yidden On Wheels.

At that time, JMA had a name and people got together under the label, but there was no formal organization. During the early part of 2006, six new clubs joined the original five, with the addition of Tribe MC (Seattle) The Sabra Riders (Atlanta), The Chai Riders (Detroit), The Chaiway Riders (Chicago), Or Tikva (Chicago), and YOW (Australia). The JMA also became formally organized: a Charter &amp; By-laws were instituted so that conduct of JMA business for current and future members would be guided by rules.  To date, there are 44 registered clubs affiliated with the JMA and several more in the planning stage.

===Ride to Remember===
The Ride to Remember (R2R) has become the de facto defining event for the JMA and will occur annually at a venue to be selected by the JMA’s governing council.

R2R 2006 was held in Whitwell, TN, to honor the staff and students of its middle school for their efforts in the [[Paper Clips Project]]. R2R 2007 was held in New York City in May, 2007.  In May 2008, the Jewish Motorcyclists Alliance rode its motorcycles to Omaha, Nebraska for the "Illuminating the Past to Protect the Future" event in support of the [[Heartland Holocaust Education Fund]] (HHEF). 2009 R2R enjoyed 215 attendees who, through their collective efforts, raised $57,000 for the Holocaust Research and Lending Library in [[Savannah, Georgia| Savannah]] and The Remember Project in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. The 2010 Ride to Remember took place in [[Chicago]]/[[Skokie, Illinois|Skokie]] on June 10–13 and followed the route of the Skokie Nazi March 1977, ending at the [[Illinois Holocaust Museum]]. The 2011 R2R was held in [[Virginia Beach]]; the 2012 R2R in [[Toronto]]; the 2013 R2R in [[Orange_County,_California|Orange County]], [[California]]; and 2014 in [[Oswego,_New_York|Oswego]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. The 2015 Ride to Remember will be held sometime in June in [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]].

== Philosophy ==
"As individuals, we share the fundamental passion to ride motorcycles, but we are drawn to each of our own clubs by our common faith and heritage as members of the Jewish faith.

The common thread is our religion, regardless of the degree and manner in which we choose to observe the Jewish faith. The admission of a prospective club for membership into the JMA is not predicated upon the degree to which the members of a Jewish club observes or practices the Jewish faith, or by the brands of motorcycles that its members may ride."

== Mission ==
The mission of the Jewish Motorcyclists Alliance, and by extension the forum is to create a global internet environment whereby members of the Jewish faith who ride motorcycles can congregate to share and exchange ideas and opinions about matters of concern to the Jewish community at large, as well as issues specifically concerning motorcycles and motorcycle riding.

[[File:John Roberton (1776-1840).jpg|thumb|John Roberton]]
:''For the namesake and contemporaneous Scottish physician and social reformer, see [[John Roberton (1797)|John Roberton]].''
'''John Roberton''' (1776 &amp;ndash; 1840) was a Scottish physician and [[social reform]]er. A [[radicalism (historical)|radical]] and fringe figure in the medical profession, he is best remembered for advocating the founding of a ''medical police'' to promote health and social welfare and for authoring a book that became the centre of a notorious legal case.

==Life==
Roberton was born in [[Hamilton, Lanarkshire]], the eldest of four children to a modest family. By 1799 he was in [[Edinburgh]] attending medical lectures though he seems never to have [[graduation|graduated]]. He was admitted to the [[Royal Medical Society]] which suggests that he enjoyed the support of a [[patron]]. His early published [[scientific paper]]s on [[blister]]s, [[catarrh]] and [[cantharides]] already suggest that he nurtured unconventional views. Though he seems to have practised under the supervision of a senior doctor until 1802, he then established himself independently as a [[general practitioner]]. He specialised in the treatment of [[sexually transmitted diseases]] and was a single-minded advocate of the use of cantharides. In 1809 Roberton published ''A Treatise on Medical Police, and on Diet, Regimen, &amp;c.''. He was fond of controversy and became involved in many undignified disputes, including that between the rival rites of [[freemasonry]]. His conduct was eventually adjudged "disgraceful" by the Royal Medical Society and he was expelled, departing for [[London]] in 1810.&lt;ref name="white1"&gt;White (1983) ''pp''412-416&lt;/ref&gt;

On arrival in London, he started to finalise his work on the [[pathology]] of the [[reproductive system]], ''On Diseases of the Generative System'' and asked [[Matthew Baillie]] to accept the dedication of the book. In the book, Roberton had criticised the methods of Sir [[Everard Home]], a relative of Baillie's, and Baillie balked at accepting the dedication. Further, the book made no pretension of being a scientific work. As Roberton asserted in the introduction, "In this work, no tedious, uninteresting investigation will be entered into; it will be purely practical and suited to readers in general." Another undignified exchange of correspondence followed.&lt;ref name="white1"/&gt; Owing to his reputation and the somewhat sensational nature of the work along with its explicit illustrations, Roberton had some difficulty in finding a publisher. The book was eventually published by [[John Joseph Stockdale]], who himself had something of the reputation of a [[pornography|pornographer]], further enhancing its notoriety. Stockdale guaranteed the salacious reputation of the work when he published further editions, himself interpolating still more sensational illustrations. After a well-thumbed copy of the book was discovered by prison inspectors in [[Newgate Prison]] in 1839, the book became the centre of the important [[defamation]] case of ''[[Stockdale v. Hansard]]''.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberton was again disgraced but seems to have maintained a prosperous household in [[St. James's Park]] on the revenue from ''Generative System'' and some private practice. Practice by unlicensed and unqualified physicians was not proscribed by law until the [[Medical Act 1858]]. In 1821, under the pseudonym '''T. Bell MD''', he published, again through Stockdale, ''Kalogynomia, or the Laws of Female Beauty''.&lt;ref&gt;White (1983) ''pp''417-8&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Khudabadi''' is a script generally used by some [[Sindhis in India|Sindhis]] in [[India]] to write the [[Sindhi language]]. It is also known as ''Vaniki'', ''Hatvaniki'' and ''Hatkai'' script. Khudabadi is one of the three scripts used for writing the [[Sindhi language]], the other being [[Perso-Arabic]] and [[Devanagari]] script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used by [[Sindhi workies|traders and merchants]] to record their information and rose to importance as the script began to be used to record information kept secret from other groups and kingdoms.

Modern Khudabadi has 37 consonants, 10 vowels, 9 vowel signs written as [[diacritic]] marks added to the consonants, 3 miscellaneous signs, one symbol for nasal sounds (''anusvara''), one symbol for conjucts (''virama'') and 10 digits like many other [[Indic scripts]]. The ''nukta'' has been borrowed from [[Devanagari]] for representing additional signs found in [[Arabic]] but not found in Sindhi. It is written from left to right, like [[Sanskrit]]. It follows a natural pattern and style of other [[Landa scripts]].

The Khudabadi script has roots in the [[Brahmi script]], like most Indian, Tibetan, and Southeast Asian languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Danesh Jain|author2=George Cardona| title=The Indo-Aryan Languages |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OtCPAgAAQBAJ| year=2007| publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-79711-9|pages=94–99, 72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears different from other Indic scripts such as [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali]], [[Odia alphabet|Odia]], [[Gurmukhi alphabet|Gurmukhi]] or [[Devanagari]], but a closer examination reveals they are similar except for angles and structure.&lt;ref name=georgec&gt;George Cardona and Danesh Jain (2003), The Indo-Aryan Languages, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415772945}}, pages 72-74&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Khudabadi is an ''[[abugida]]'' in which all consonants have an inherent vowel. ''[[Diacritics|Matras]]'' are used to change the inherent vowel. Vowels that appear at the beginning of a word are written as independent letters. When certain consonants occur together, special [[conjunct|conjunct symbols]] are used which combine the essential parts of each letter.

The Khudabadi script was created by the [[Sindhi people|Sindhi diaspora]] residing in [[Khudabad]] to send written messages to their relatives, who lived in their hometowns. Due to its simplicity, the use of this script spread very quickly and got acceptance in other Sindhi groups for sending written letters and messages. It continued to be in use for very long period of time. Because it was originated from Khudabad, it was called Khudabadi script.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ae/books/download/Incredible_Origin_and_History_of_Khudaba.enw?id=ihcAmwEACAAJ&amp;output=enw The Incredible History and Origin of Khudabad&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sindhi traders started maintaining their accounts and other business books in this new script. The knowledge of Khudabadi script became important for employing people who intend to go to overseas so that their business accounts and books can be kept [[Secrecy|secret from foreign people]] and government officials. Schools started teaching the Sindhi language in Khudabadi script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dhirendra Narain|title=Research in Sociology |url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=Y0yED5k62TsC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=schools+started+teaching+sindhi+in+khudabadi+script&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kP7pRe-gZk&amp;sig=i-5nzWqFGeMdU6waoIsBkyuOX6Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjh5qD9rNvSAhUBfhoKHVyjAcUQ6AEIODAG#v=onepage&amp;q=schools%20started%20teaching%20sindhi%20in%20khudabadi%20script&amp;f=false| year=2007| publisher=Concept Publicstion|pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sindhi language is now generally written in the [[Arabic script]], but it belongs to the [[Indo-Aryan language family]] and over seventy percent of Sindhi words are of Sanskrit origin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indianmirror.com/languages/sindhi-language.html Sindhi language&lt;/ref&gt;  The historian [[Al-Biruni]] found Sindhi written in three scripts – [[Ardhanagari]], [[Mahajani]] and Khudabadi, all of them variations of [[Devanagari]].&lt;ref name="Hindus of Sindh"&gt;https://hindusofsindh.wordpress.com/tag/khudabadi/&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Mir Nasir Khan Talpur]]'s defeat, [[British Raj|British rule]] commenced in [[Sindh]]. When the British arrived they found the [[Pandit]]s writing Sindhi in Devanagari, Hindu women using [[Gurmukhi]], government servants using [[Perso-Arabic script]] and traders keeping their business records in Khudabadi which was completely unknown to the British at the time. The British called it 'Hindu Sindhi' to differentiate it from Sindhi written in the Perso-Arabic script.

The British scholars found the Sindhi language to be closer to Sanskrit and said that the Devanagari script would be suitable for it while the government servants favoured the Arabic script since they did not know Devanagari and had to learn it. A debate began, with Captain [[Richard Francis Burton]] favoring the [[Arabic script]] and Captain Stack favouring Devanagari.&lt;ref name=sindhiscript&gt;{{cite web |url = http://sindhilanguage.com/script.html |title = Sindhi Language: Script |accessdate= 15 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir [[Bartle Frere]], the Commissioner of Sindh, then referred the matter to the Court of Directors of the British East India Company, which directed that:
* The Sindhi Language in Arabic Script to be used for government office use, on the ground that Muslim names could not be written in Devanagari.
* The Education Department should give the instructions to the schools in the script of Sindhi which can meet the circumstance and prejudices of the Mohammadan and Hindu. It is thought necessary to have Arabic Sindhi Schools for Muslims where the Arabic Script will be employed for teaching and to have Hindu Sindhi Schools for Hindus where the Khudabadi Script will be employed for teaching.

In the year 1868, the [[Bombay Presidency]] assigned ''Narayan Jagannath Vaidya'' (Deputy Educational Inspector of Sindh) to replace the Abjad script used for Sindhi with the Khudabadi script. The script was decreed a standard script modified with ten vowels by the Bombay Presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.omniglot.com/writing/sindhi.htm |title = Omniglot: Sindhi alphabets, pronunciation and language |accessdate= 15 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Khudabadi script of Sindhi language did not make further progress. Traders continued to maintain their records in this script till the independence of [[Pakistan]] in 1947.

The present script predominantly used in Sindh as well as in many states in India and else, where migrants Hindu Sindhi have settled, is Arabic in [[Naskh (script)|Naskh]] styles having 52 letters. However, in some circles in India, Khudabadi and Devanagari is used for writing Sindhi. The Government of India recognizes both scripts.&lt;ref name=sindhiscript /&gt;

==Unicode==
{{See also|Khudawadi (Unicode block)}}
Khudabadi script was added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in June 2014 with the release of version 7.0.

Khudabadi is being used as the unified encoding for all of the Sindhi scripts except for [[Khojki]], because each Sindhi script is named after the mercantile village in which it was used, and a vast majority are not well-developed enough to be encoded. Local scripts may be encoded in the future, but at the present, Khudabadi is recommended to represent all of the Landa-based Sindhi scripts that have been in use.

The Unicode block for Khudabadi, called Khudawadi, is U+112B0&amp;ndash;U+112FF:

'''Kidnappings in Colombia''' refers to the practice of [[kidnapping]] in the [[Republic of Colombia]]. This criminal practice was first introduced in modern [[history of Colombia|Colombian history]] during the early 1970s by the guerrilla movements and, later, also by criminal groups. With the release of Colombian presidential candidate [[Ingrid Betancourt]] on July 2, 2008 this practice gained worldwide notoriety.

Guerrilla groups like the [[19th of April Movement|M-19]], the [[FARC]], [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|ELN]] among others widely exploited this practice. To counter these paramilitary groups also adopted this method to intimidate adversaries. Drug cartels like the [[Medellín Cartel]] also used this practice to intimidate politicians who were trying to approve in [[Congress of Colombia|congress]] an extradition treaty with the United States, and also used in drug cartel wars. Regular criminal organizations also kidnap and sell persons of interest to guerrilla groups. 

[[Police of Colombia|Police in Colombia ]] say the number of people kidnapped has fallen 92% since 2000. Common criminals are now the perpetrators of the overwhelming majority of kidnappings.&lt;ref name="Military Personnel2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "92%"/&gt; 

== Extent ==
By July 2005, the FARC alone had an estimated 2500 kidnapped civilians, without including the number of military servicemen or government officials. The paramilitary groups were estimated to have kidnapped 500 people between 1996 and 2004. Guerrilla organizations typically demand a ransom, while Paramilitary groups generally use the practice as a means of terror or coercion. 

Since the 1970s kidnappings in Colombia gradually increased until 2001. In the year 2000 alone the number of kidnapped people in Colombia rose to 3572. This number declined steadily in the following years, reaching 687 kidnappings in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paislibre.org/images/PDF/secuestroestadisticasgenerales%202006%20org.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; By the year 2015, the number of kidnappings in Colombia had declined to 213 and it continues to decline.&lt;ref name="Military Personnel"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mindefensa.gov.co/irj/go/km/docs/Mindefensa/Documentos/descargas/estudios%20sectoriales/info_estadistica/Logros_Sector_Defensa.pdf|title=  Logros de la Política de Defensa y Seguridad Todos por un Nuevo País|language= Spanish|publisher = mindefensa.gov.co}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colombia happily no longer has the highest rate of kidnappings in the world.&lt;ref name = "controlrisks.com"&gt;{{cite book|title= RiskMap Report 2015 - Kidnap and extortion overview|publisher= controlrisks.com|url= https://www.controlrisks.com/webcasts/studio/flipping-book/RiskMap-Report-2015/files/assets/common/downloads/2014-12-02-RiskMap_2015_REPORT-spread.pdf|page = 122}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the year 2016, the number of kidnappings in Colombia had declined to 205 and it continues to decline.

== Other forms of kidnapping ==
Following the guerrilla's example, criminal organizations mostly based in large cities began to practice [[Express kidnapping]]s (''secuestros express''), colloquially named "[[Millionaire tour]]s" (''Paseo Millionario''). Victims are boarded in places with little police presence or where they are most vulnerable. Most commonly these are performed after victims withdraw money from ATMs or while riding in fake, terrorist-operated taxi cabs.

The '''Komi language''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|m|i}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/komi?s=t|title=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; endonym: Коми кыв, &lt;small&gt;[[Transliteration|tr.]]&lt;/small&gt; ''Komi kyv'' {{IPA|/komi kɨv/}}) is a [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] [[macrolanguage]] spoken by the [[Komi peoples]] in the northeastern [[Europe]]an part of [[Russia]]. Komi may be considered a single language with several dialects, or a group of closely related languages,&lt;ref name="encyc"&gt;{{cite book | title=Historical Dictionary of the Russian Federation | publisher=Scarecrow Press | author=Saunders, Robert A. | year=2010 | pages=724 | isbn=9780810854758 | last2=Strukov | first2=Vlad}}&lt;/ref&gt; making up one of the two branches of the [[Permic languages|Permic]] branch of the family. The other Permic language is [[Udmurt language|Udmurt]], to which Komi is closely related.

Of the several Komi dialects or languages, two major varieties are recognized, closely related to one another: [[Komi-Zyrian language|Komi-Zyrian]], the largest group, serves as the literary basis within the [[Komi Republic]]; and [[Komi-Permyak language|Komi-Permyak]] (also called Permyak), spoken in [[Komi-Permyak Okrug]], where it has literary status. A third variety, [[Komi-Yodzyak language|Komi-Yodzyak]] is spoken by a small, isolated group of Komi to the north-west of [[Perm Krai]] and south of the [[Komi Republic]].

==Writing system==
The first [[writing system]], the [[Old Permic script]], was invented in the 14th century by the missionary [[Stephen of Perm|Stepan Khrap]], apparently of a Komi mother in [[Veliky Ustyug]]. The alphabet shows some similarity to medieval [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Cyrillic]]. In the 16th century this alphabet was replaced by the [[Russian alphabet]] with certain modifications for affricates. In the 1920s, the language was written in [[Molodtsov alphabet]], also derived from Cyrillic. In the 1930s it was switched to Latin. Since the 1940s the [[Komi Cyrillic alphabet|Komi alphabet]] was simply changed to the [[Russian alphabet]], albeit with the addition of ''[[І]], і'' and ''[[Ӧ]], ӧ''.

Letters particular to the [[Molodtsov alphabet]] include [[ԁ]], [[Komi Dje|ԃ]], [[Komi Zje|ԅ]], [[Komi Dzje|ԇ]], [[ԉ]], [[ԋ]], [[ԍ]], [[ԏ]], where the hooks represent [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]].

In addition, the letters Ф ф, Х х, and Ц ц might be used for words borrowed from Russian.

The first book published in Komi was a vaccination manual published in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taagepera|first1=Rein|title=The Finno-Ugric Republics and the Russian State|date=1999|publisher=C, Hurst &amp; Co.|page=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Komi has seven vowels: close {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/ɨ/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, mid {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/ɘ/}}, {{IPA|/o/}} and low {{IPA|/a/}}. It has 17 cases, with a rich inventory of local cases. Like other Uralic languages, Komi has no gender. Verbs agree with subjects in person and number (sg/pl). Negation is expressed with an auxiliary verb, which is inflected for person, number and tense.

Komi is an agglutinative language and adheres to a [[subject–object–verb]] order.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qaSdffgD9t4C&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;dq=Komi+word+order&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uH3Jv3XzcU&amp;sig=kBI-1a4U27h0srXd5DxdAfT6jVQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PBsMT-HrOoforQf8xOG0BA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Komi%20word%20order&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dialects ==
There are three literary standard varieties of Komi: 
* Standard Komi-Zyrian (often called simply Komi), based on the dialect of [[Syktyvkar]], the capital of the Komi republic.
* Standard Komi-Permyak, based on the Southern (Kudymkar) /v/ dialect but the usage of /v/~/l/ is invented artificially from /v/~/l/ (Komi-Zyrian) dialects.
* Standard Komi-Yazva, it was long considered to be a dialect of Komi-Permyak, but has many unique features, so in 2003 the independent Komi-Yazva alphabet has been introduced.

According to Lytkin  (1966:44-49; 1976:106–115) and Teplyashina (1976:106–115) the Komi macrolanguage divided into four principal dialect groups or types depending on the development of Proto-Komi *''l''.

# L-type dialects ([[Kosa River|Kosa]]-[[Sysola River|Sysola]]) retain {{IPA|/l/}} in all positions.

#*''Komi-Permyak''
#** Northern (Middle [[Kama River|Kama]]) group of dialects (L-6)
#** [[Afanasyevsky District|Zyuzdino]] (Upper Kama) dialect (L-7)
# VL-type dialects ([[Vychegda River|Vychegda]]) vocalize [[Syllable coda|syllable-final]] *l into {{IPA|/v/}}. This creates [[morphophonology|morphophonological]] alternation between {{IPA|/v/}} and {{IPA|/l/}} in [[Word stem|stem]]-final position.
#* Upper Vychegda (VL-1)
#* Syktyvkar ('''Standard Komi-Zyrian''') (VL-2)
#* Lower Vychegda (VL-3)
#* Udora (VL-4)
# ØL-type dialects ([[Izhma River|Izhma]]) also vocalize syllable-final *l, but with [[compensatory lengthening]], resulting in a [[long vowel]]. This results in similar morphophonological alternations as in the previous group.
#* [[Vym River|Vym]] (ØL-1)
#* Izhma (ØL-2)
# V-type dialects ([[Inva River|Inva]]) vocalize *l into {{IPA|/v/}} in all positions.
#* Southern group ('''Standard Komi-Permyak''') of dialects (V)

This division does not clearly correspond with the division into Zyrian, Permyak and Yazva dialects.
Komi-Permyak itself divided into three dialects: two /l/ types, Northern (Middle Kama) and [[Afanasyevsky District|Zyuzdino]] (Upper Kama) and one /v/ type, Southern near [[Kudymkar]], the capital of the [[Komi-Permyak Okrug]].

The '''Kru''' or '''Kroo''' are a West African ethnic group who originated in eastern [[Liberia]] and migrated and settled along various points of the West African coast, notably Freetown, Sierra Leone, but also the Ivorian and Nigerian coasts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |title=Africa and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History: a multidisciplinary encyclopedia |editor1-last=Juang |editor1-first=Richard M. |editor2-last=Morrissette |editor2-first=Noelle |publisher=ABC-CLIO, Inc. |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-85109-446-2 |location=Santa Barbara, CA |pages=674}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kru were famous for their skills in navigating and sailing the Atlantic. Their maritime expertise evolved along the west coast of Africa as they made livings as fishermen and traders. Knowing the in-shore waters of the western coast of Africa, and having nautical experience, they were employed as sailors, navigators and interpreters aboard slave ships, as well as American and British warships used against the slave trade.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Kru people were more valuable as traders and sailors on slave ships than as slave labor. To ensure their status as “freemen,” they initiated the practice of tattooing their foreheads and the bridge of their nose with indigo dye to distinguish them from slave labor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Their history is one marked by a strong sense of ethnicity and resistance to occupation. In 1856 when part of Liberia was still known as the independent [[Republic of Maryland]], the Kru along with the [[Grebo people|Grebo]] resisted Maryland settlers' efforts to control their trade. They were also infamous amongst early European [[slave trade|slave raiders]] as being especially averse to capture.

The Kru are one of the many ethnic groups in Liberia, comprising 7% of the population. It is also one of the main languages spoken. The Kru are one of the three main indigenous group players in Liberia's socio-political activities along with the [[Krahn]] and [[Mano people]].

Notable ethnic Krus include the 25th President of Liberia [[George Weah]], who is of mixed Kru, Gbee, Mano, and Bassa heritage, as well as his predecessor, former President  [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]] , who is of mixed Kru, [[Gola people|Gola]], and [[Germans|German]] ancestry. Soccer star [[William Jebor]] is exclusively of Kru background, as is Christian Evangelist Samuel Morris who was originally known as Kaboo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4403120.stm |title=BBC News, Profile: George Weah |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-11-11 |accessdate=2012-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kramer |first=Reed |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200512110034.html |title=Reed Kramer, "Liberia: Showered With Enthusiasm, Liberia's President-Elect Receives High-Level Reception in Washington", AllAfrica.com, 11 December 2005 |publisher=Allafrica.com |date=2008-05-14 |accessdate=2012-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1109600/Ellen-Johnson-Sirleaf |title=Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Broh]], the current mayor of [[Monrovia]], is of mixed Kru and [[Bassa people (Liberia)|Bassa]] ancestry.

'''Kunchitiga''' is a community of people from [[Karnataka]], [[India]]. They are concentrated mostly in [[Tumkur]] and the cities of [[Bangalore]] and [[Mysore]]. They are also found in [[Chitradurga]] district.&lt;ref name="BalasubramanyamOperations1965"&gt;{{cite book|author1=K. Balasubramanyam|author2=India. Superintendent of Census Operations, Mysore|author3=India. Office of the Registrar General|title=Mysore: handicraft survey monographs : crafts using wood as the chief raw material|year=1965|series=Census of India, 1961|publisher=Manager of Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and Legends ==
While the exact origins of the community is disputed till date, there seems a consistent legend describing the migration of the community from the north to the south of India.

Legend has it that Kunchitigas were originally from northern parts of [[India]] and were forced to migrate south due to various circumstances prevailing in that region. In most legends concerning this migration a [[Muslim]] ruler is involved, who is said to have coveted the daughter of the community's chief.&lt;ref name="Kunchitigara Samajada Charitre p21"&gt;{{cite book |last=M|first=Puttaiah|title= Kunchitigara Samajada Charitre|origyear=1973|year=1973|page=21|location=Bangalore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their leader/progenitor was one [[Undetharaya]] who whilst fleeing the said Muslim ruler, was unable to cross an overflowing river( Some legends claim the river to be [[Godavari]] and some as [[Ganges]]&lt;ref name="Kunchitigara Samajada Charitre p21" /&gt;) and was helped by a [[Kuruba]] called "[[Jaladhi Bapparaya]]" on the promise that the community would be named after him. He is said to have offered himself as sacrifice to the river goddess at which an easy passage was created for the fleeing people. [[Jaladhi Bapparaya]] was holding a Kuncha(cluster) used to weave woolen blankets in his hands, a symbol of his profession. Janakal Undetharaya is said to have named his community as Kunchitiga in his honour. Undetharaya is also said to have given his daughter in marriage to the corpse of the [[Kuruba Gowda]], who was then revived by divine grace. Their union thus heralded the start of a new community. Currently it is recognized with [[Vokkaliga]] and emerged as huge brotherhood becoming 2nd largest Hindu community of Karnataka. &lt;ref name="Kunchitigara Samajada Charitre p21" /&gt;
 
===The Legend of Jaladhi Bopparaya===
Jaladhi Bopparaya is a Kuruba leader and great divine Shiva worshiper, [[Kuruba]]s being good from heart wanted to help people who wanted to cross Godavari river. [[Kuruba]] is the only single community in India who ruled almost India .Jaladhi Bopparaya was ruling the region around Godavari river and he was very famous. With his great sacrifice and devotion he saved many people and from then new caste was formed called as "Kunchitiga". Kunchitiga still work ship the great Kuruba Jaladhi Bopparaya for his great work and sacrifice.&lt;ref name="Kunchitigara Samajada Charitre p32"&gt;{{cite book |last=M|first=Puttaiah|title= Kunchitigara Samajada Charitre|origyear=1973|year=1973|page=32|location=Bangalore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sub Divisions ==
It is believed that Kunchitigas originally had 101 Gothras.  Currently people of the following 48 gothras are found in the Karnataka region.&lt;ref name="Kunchitigara Samajada Charitre p95"&gt;{{cite book |last=M|first=Puttaiah|title= Kunchitigara Samajada Charitre|origyear=1973|year=1973|page=95|location=Bangalore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Latter Days''''' is a 2003 American [[Romance film|romantic]] [[comedy-drama]] film about a [[homosexuality|gay]] relationship between a [[Coming out#Closeted|closeted]] [[Mormon]] [[Missionary (LDS Church)|missionary]] and his [[Coming out|openly gay]] neighbor. The film was written and directed by [[C. Jay Cox]] and stars [[Steve Sandvoss]] as the missionary, Aaron, and [[Wes Ramsey]] as the neighbor, Christian. [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] appears as Elder Ryder, and [[Rebekah Johnson]] as Julie Taylor. [[Mary Kay Place]], [[Erik Palladino]], [[Amber Benson]], and [[Jacqueline Bisset]] have supporting roles.

''Latter Days'' premiered at the [[Philadelphia International Gay &amp; Lesbian Film Festival]] on July 10, 2003 and was released in various states of USA over the next 12 months. Later the film was released in a few other countries and shown at several gay film festivals. It was the first film to portray openly the [[Homosexuality and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|clash]] between the principles of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] and [[homosexuality]], and its exhibition in some [[U.S. state]]s was controversial. Various religious groups demanded that the film be withdrawn from theaters and video stores under [[boycott]] threats.

The film was met with mixed reactions from film critics, but was popular with most film festival attendees. At the North American box office however, ''Latter Days'' only made $834,685, barely covering the production's costs with an estimated budget of $850,000. In 2004, freelance writer T. Fabris made ''Latter Days'' into a novel, which was published by [[Alyson Publications]].

==Plot==
[[Elder (Latter Day Saints)|Elder]] Aaron Davis, a young [[Mormon]] from [[Pocatello, Idaho]], is sent to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] with three other missionaries to spread the Mormon faith. They move into an apartment next to openly gay party boy Christian Markelli and his roommate Julie, an aspiring singer. Christian and Julie work as waiters at Lila's, a trendy restaurant owned by retired actress Lila Montagne.

Christian makes a bet with his co-workers that he can seduce one of the Mormons, and  soon realizes that Aaron, the most inexperienced missionary, is a [[Coming out#Closeted|closeted]] homosexual. Aaron and Christian become acquainted after several encounters in the apartment complex. When Christian accidentally cuts himself on a metal hose reel and faints, Aaron helps him indoors and cleans his wound. Christian attempts to seduce Aaron, but the hesitant Mormon becomes upset by Christian's remark that sex "doesn't have to mean anything." Aaron accuses him of being shallow and walks out. Worried that Aaron is correct, Christian joins Project Angel Food, delivering meals to people with [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]].

Aaron's fellow missionary, Paul Ryder, has a cycling accident. Returning to his apartment, a distraught Aaron encounters Christian, who tries to comfort him with a hug. Both men are overwhelmed by their feelings and end up kissing, failing to notice the return of Aaron's roommates. Aaron is sent home in disgrace, leading Christian to confront Ryder, who is angry that Christian corrupted Aaron for no reason. Christian admits that he initially just wanted to win a bet, but says "it's not about that" anymore. Recognizing Christian's distress, Ryder tells him that Aaron's flight has a five-hour [[layover]] in [[Salt Lake City]].

Christian finds Aaron standing in the snow outside the airport terminal. Christian confesses his love, and despite his misgivings, Aaron admits his own feelings of love. With all flights canceled due to a snowstorm, Christian and Aaron spend an intimate night in a motel. When Christian awakes, he finds Aaron gone. Aaron's pocket watch, a family heirloom, has been left behind. Christian returns to Los Angeles. In Idaho, Aaron is [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] by the church elders, led by his own father, Farron, who is the [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)#Stake officers|stake president]]. Aaron is rejected by his father and scolded by his mother, who tells him that he needs to pray for forgiveness. When Aaron suggests that he might be gay, his mother slaps him. Overwhelmed by despair, Aaron attempts suicide. He is subsequently sent by his parents to a treatment facility to be [[Ex-gay movement|cured of his homosexuality]].

Christian is desperate to find Aaron and locates his home address and phone number. Aaron's mother informs him that "Thanks to you, my son took a razor to his wrists; thanks to you I have lost my son." Believing that Aaron is dead, Christian spends the next few days thinking continually about Aaron. Julie discovers an entry about Christian's feelings in his cellphone journal and uses it as the basis for her new song. Christian travels to the Davis home in Idaho, where he tearfully returns Aaron's watch to his mother. During an encounter with Julie, she hesitantly shows him her new video, which upsets Christian, realizing that part of the lyrics came from his personal journal without his consent. Julie tells Christian that she hoped something good would come from it.

In the treatment facility, Aaron hears a female voice singing and investigates. He discovers a music video playing on television, the song performed by Julie. The video prompts Aaron to return to Los Angeles in search of Christian. Upon arriving at Christian's apartment, Aaron is heartbroken when a stranger answers the door. Thinking that Christian has returned to his party boy ways and moved on, and having nowhere else to go, Aaron makes his way to Lila's restaurant, having befriended the owner while on missionary work after her life partner died. Christian, who happens to be working there, comes out and is overjoyed to see Aaron alive. They reconcile and later celebrate [[Thanksgiving]] with Christian's co-workers. Lila tells everyone that, no matter what, they will always have "a place at my table, and a place in my heart".

==Cast==
[[File:Steve Sandvoss November 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Steve Sandvoss]] (Elder Aaron Davis in the film)]]
* [[Steve Sandvoss]] as Elder Aaron Davis, a young Latter-day Saint from  Pocatello, Idaho, who falls in love with Christian and must choose between his sexuality and his church.

* [[Wes Ramsey]] as Christian William Markelli, an LA party boy aspiring to be an actor, Christian has his ideas of happiness and the meaning of life challenged when he falls for the simple but kind-hearted Aaron.

I was just so excited and feel very blessed to have the opportunity to tell that story through his eyes."&lt;ref name= "DVD"/&gt;
* [[Rebekah Johnson]] as Julie Taylor, Christian's roommate who tries to break out into the music world and on the way stop Christian from falling apart.
[[File:JacquelineBissetSept08.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jacqueline Bisset]] (Lila Montagne in the film)]]

* [[Amber Benson]] as Traci Levine; Traci has moved from New York to LA to become an actress and works at Lila's to support herself. Traci does not like living in LA, but later admits she did not like New York much either.
* [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] as Elder Paul Ryder, a prickly, judgmental young missionary assigned as Aaron's partner, Ryder is not enthusiastic about being in LA and even less so about living next door to a homosexual. Gordon-Levitt originally auditioned to play Aaron, but his aggressive attitude toward the script but good sense of humor made the producers decide he was a perfect Ryder.&lt;ref name= "DVD"/&gt;
[[File:Rob McElhenney by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rob McElhenney]] portrays Elder Harmon]]
* [[Rob McElhenney]] as Elder Harmon, the oldest of the L.D.S. missionaries and has been assigned as their leader.

* Dave Power as Elder Gilford, Harmon's missionary partner.

Cox said that Palladino's performance was not how he originally envisioned it, but he could not now imagine a different person playing Keith.&lt;ref name= "DVD"/&gt;
* [[Mary Kay Place]] as Sister Gladys Davis, Aaron's deeply religious mother, who, despite showing unconditional love and affection toward Aaron before he leaves for Los Angeles, cannot accept the fact that her son is gay.
* Jim Ortlieb as Elder Farron Davis, Aaron's father, who serves as a Latter-day Saint [[Stake President]] in Pocatello, excommunicates Aaron from the church upon learning that he is gay. Farron is portrayed as a distant, evasive individual.

==Themes==
Cox has stated that the film is primarily about a love story between two characters.&lt;ref name= "Killer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.killermoviereviews.com/main.php?nextlink=display&amp;dId=434&amp;subLinks= |title=Cox, C.

A non-fiction film with similar themes that has been contrasted with ''Latter Days'' is ''[[Trembling Before G-d]]''.&lt;ref name= "Jam"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Braun |first1=Liz |url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Reviews/L/Latter_Days/2004/07/16/753449.html |title=Love thy neighbor: Latter Days questions faith |publisher=Jam Showbiz |date=August 16, 2004 |accessdate=December 16, 2006 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20071022145911/http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Reviews/L/Latter_Days/2004/07/16/753449.html |archivedate=October 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cox has also said that there is a massive irony, both in the film and in real life, that a religion so focused on the family and its importance is ripping families apart through its teaching on homosexuality.&lt;ref name= "Killer"/&gt; In fact, Cox believes one cannot be Mormon and gay.&lt;ref name="Belief"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Phillips |first1=Rebecca |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/Christianity/Latter-Day-Saints/2004/02/A-Topic-Deeply-Buried.aspx |title=A Topic Deeply Buried |publisher=Beliefnet |date=February 12, 2004 |accessdate=October 12, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016052712/http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/Christianity/Latter-Day-Saints/2004/02/A-Topic-Deeply-Buried.aspx |archivedate=October 16, 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, a major theme of ''Latter Days'' is that there is an underlying spirituality in the world that goes beyond the rituals and dogmas of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.killermoviereviews.com/main.php?nextlink=display&amp;dId=427 |title=Latter Days |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103165234/http://killermoviereviews.com/main.php?nextlink=display&amp;dId=427|archivedate=November 3, 2007 |website=Killer Movie Reviews |date=December 12, 2006 |accessdate=December 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
''Latter Days'' was written and directed by C. Jay Cox after the success of his previous screenplay, ''[[Sweet Home Alabama (film)|Sweet Home Alabama]]'', gave him the financial resources and critical credit to write a more personal love story.&lt;ref name="ZapInterview"&gt;Szymanski, Mike.

''Latter Days'' was filmed in several locations in Los Angeles in 24 days on an estimated $850,000 budget.&lt;ref name="budget"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0345551/ ''Latter Days'' (2003) - Box office / business] IMDb.com.

Despite coming from a Mormon background, Cox had to research details of the excommunication tribunal, which is held after Aaron is sent back to Idaho.

Casting for the two main characters did not focus on their sexuality, but their ability "to show vulnerability".&lt;ref name= "ZapInterview"/&gt; In a behind-the-scenes commentary, Steve Sandvoss explains that he did not want to play his character as a gay character, and Wes Ramsey emphasizes that the love story aspect of the film to him was detached from the character's gender.&lt;ref name= "DVD"/&gt; Due to several nude and kissing scenes, ''Latter Days'' was released unrated.&lt;ref name= "ZapInterview"/&gt;

==Soundtrack==
Eric Allaman scored the soundtrack to the film after shooting wrapped, and composed much of the score himself. Several scenes featuring the rapid passing of time, such as Christian's desperate search for Aaron at [[Salt Lake City Airport]], were scored with techno style beats, and scenes with emotional content were given a more "ambient 'tronica feel".&lt;ref name= "DVD"/&gt; A total of three songs were written by C. Jay Cox for [[Rebekah Johnson]] to sing: "More", "Another Beautiful Day", and "Tuesday 3:00 a.m.". Allaman was very impressed with Cox's musical ability, and both men composed more songs as background music.&lt;ref name= "DVD"/&gt;

The official soundtrack album was released on October 26, 2004. Due to contractual reasons, Johnson did not appear on the album, and her character's songs were performed by Nita Whitaker instead.&lt;ref name= "DVD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00061Q9IA/ |title=Latter Days Soundtrack |publisher=Amazon |accessdate=November 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Macho like Me''''' is a documentary film directed and performed by [[Helie Lee]]. She performs a [[social experiment]] where she by cutting her hair and changing her wardrobe to men’s clothes transforming her appearance from an established woman into a “man”, and takes a step into the masculine world. The documentary is a mix of raw documentary footage and a live presentation, and was presented at [[San Diego Asian Film Festival|SDAFF]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/2010/10/san-diego-asian-film-festival-2010-macho-like-me-bodyguards-and-assassins-and-alien-vs-ninja/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[DC Asian Pacific American Film Festival|DC APA]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apafilm.org/macho-like-me/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130223133905/http://www.apafilm.org/macho-like-me/ |archivedate=2013-02-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2010.

==Plot ==
In the documentary she gets help from her friends Anna and Katie and shows the whole process of the transformation into a man named "Harry", a role which then lasts for 6 months. While she initially is excited by what the male life has to offer, she soon faces difficulties having to suppress her emotions and having a constant fear of being regarded as a [[homosexual]]. She then runs into an awkward and near disastrous episode with a few [[Machismo|macho]] guys. During a party at the [[Playboy Mansion]] she starts to see that men have it harder than she had ever imagined, and her views on men privileges and relationships are tested.

== Motivation and experience==
Her motivation for making the documentary was many stranded relationships with men&lt;ref&gt;http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2011/01/theater-review-macho-like-me-at-the-coast-playhouse.html&lt;/ref&gt; together with a stereotypical view that men have it easier in life than women after growing up with her brother being "treated like a crown prince, while she and her sister were judged purely on their marital prospects".&lt;ref&gt;http://init-scenes.blogspot.no/2011/04/seen-macho-like-me-march-26-2011-at.html&lt;/ref&gt; So Lee sets out to see if the grass is greener on the other side having the view to want to prove that men have it better than women with all the strength and freedom she attributes them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.laweekly.com/2011-01-20/calendar/macho-like-me/&lt;/ref&gt; It turns out, though, that she gets a new view that surprises her, as her experience as a man returns her surprising conclusions that makes her question the [[gender role]]s and the true meaning of being a "woman" or "man". What started out as a critique of male-gender advantages turns into an unexpected personal enlightenment in which she deconstructs the male identity and portrays all types of men on the verge of [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdowns]].

{{Anthropology}}

'''Medical anthropology''' studies "human health and disease, health care systems, and biocultural adaptation".&lt;ref name=McElroy1996/&gt; It views humans from multidimensional and [[ecological]] perspectives.&lt;ref name=McElroy&amp;Townsend1989/&gt; It is one of the most highly developed areas of [[anthropology]] and [[applied anthropology]],&lt;ref name=Seymour-Smith1990pp187-188/&gt; and is a subfield of [[social anthropology|social]] and [[cultural anthropology]] that examines the ways in which culture and society are organized around or influenced by issues of [[health]], [[health care]] and related issues.

The term "medical anthropology" has been used since 1963 as a label for [[empirical research]] and theoretical production by anthropologists into the social processes and cultural representations of health, illness and the nursing/care practices associated with these.&lt;ref name=Scotch1963/&gt;

Furthermore, in [[Europe]] the terms "anthropology of medicine", "anthropology of health" and "anthropology of illness" have also been used, and "medical anthropology", was also a translation of the 19th century [[Dutch language|Dutch]] term "medische anthropologie". This term was chosen by some authors during the 1940s to refer to philosophical studies on health and illness.&lt;ref name=Entralgo1968/&gt;

==Historical background==
The relationship between [[anthropology]], ''medicine'' and medical practice is well documented.&lt;ref name=Comelles&amp;Martinez1993/&gt; General anthropology occupied a notable position in the basic [[medical sciences]] (which correspond to those subjects commonly known as pre-clinical). However, medical education started to be restricted to the confines of the hospital as a consequence of the development of the clinical gaze and the confinement of patients in observational infirmaries.&lt;ref name=Foucault1963/&gt;&lt;ref name=vonBueltzingsloewen/&gt; The [[hegemony]] of hospital clinical education and of experimental methodologies suggested by [[Claude Bernard]] relegate the value of the practitioners' everyday experience who was previously seen as a source of knowledge represented by the reports called ''medical geographies'' and ''medical topographies'' both based on ethnographic, demographic, statistical and sometimes epidemiological data. After the development of hospital clinical training the basic source of knowledge in medicine was experimental medicine in the hospital and laboratory, and these factors together meant that over time mostly doctors abandoned ethnography as a tool of knowledge. Most, not all because ethnography remained during a large part of the 20th century as a tool of knowledge in primary health care, rural medicine, and in international public health. The abandonment of [[ethnography]] by medicine happened when social [[anthropology]] adopted ethnography as one of the markers of its professional identity and started to depart from the initial project of general anthropology. The divergence of professional [[anthropology]] from [[medicine]] was never a complete split.&lt;ref name=Comelles2000/&gt; The relationships between the two disciplines remained constant during the 20th century, until the development of modern medical anthropology in the 1960s and 1970s. A large number of contributors to 20th Century medical anthropology had their primary training in medicine, nursing, psychology or psychiatry, including [[W. H. R. Rivers]], [[Abram Kardiner]], [[Robert I. Levy]], Jean Benoist, Gonzalo Aguirre Beltrán and [[Arthur Kleinman]]. Some of them share clinical and anthropological roles. Others came from anthropology or [[social sciences]], like George Foster, William Caudill, [[Byron Good]], Tullio Seppilli, Gilles Bibeau, Lluis Mallart, Andràs Zempleni, Gilbert Lewis, Ronald Frankenberg, and Eduardo Menéndez. A recent book by Saillant &amp; Genest describes a large international [[panorama]] of the development of medical anthropology, and some of the main theoretical and intellectual actual debates.&lt;ref name=Saillant&amp;Genest2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Saillant&amp;Genest2007/&gt;

==Popular medicine and medical systems==
For much of the 20th century, the concept of ''popular medicine'', or ''[[traditional medicine|folk medicine]]'', has been familiar to both doctors and anthropologists. Doctors, anthropologists and medical anthropologists used these terms to describe the resources, other than the help of health professionals, which European or [[Latin American]] [[peasant]]s used to resolve any health problems. The term was also used to describe the health practices of aborigines in different parts of the world, with particular emphasis on their [[ethnobotanical]] knowledge. This knowledge is fundamental for isolating [[alkaloid]]s and active pharmacological principles. Furthermore, studying the rituals surrounding popular therapies served to challenge [[Western world|Western]] psychopathological categories, as well as the relationship in the West between science and religion. Doctors were not trying to turn popular medicine into an anthropological concept, rather they wanted to construct a scientifically based medical concept which they could use to establish the cultural limits of [[biomedicine]].&lt;ref name=Comelles1996/&gt;&lt;ref name=Charuty1997/&gt; Examples of this practice can be found in medical archives and oral history projects.&lt;ref&gt;Monoclonal Antibodies to Migraine: Witnesses to Modern Biomedicine, an A-Z : Ed E M Jones and E M Tansey  Queen Mary University, University of London 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of ''folk medicine'' was taken up by professional anthropologists in the first half of the twentieth century to demarcate between ''magical practices'', ''medicine'' and ''religion'' and to explore the role and the significance of ''popular healers'' and their self-medicating practices. For them, popular medicine was a specific cultural feature of some groups of humans which was distinct from the universal practices of [[biomedicine]]. If every culture had its own specific popular medicine based on its general cultural features, it would be possible to propose the existence of as many medical systems as there were cultures and, therefore, develop the comparative study of these systems. Those medical systems which showed none of the syncretic features of European popular medicine were called primitive or pretechnical medicine according to whether they referred to contemporary aboriginal cultures or to cultures predating [[Classical Greece]]. Those cultures with a documentary corpus, such as the [[Traditional Tibetan medicine|Tibetan]], traditional Chinese or [[Ayurvedic]] cultures, were sometimes called ''systematic medicines''. The comparative study of medical systems is known as [[ethnomedicine]] or, if [[psychopathology]] is the object of study, ethnopsychiatry (Beneduce 2007, 2008), transcultural psychiatry (Bibeau, 1997) and anthropology of mental illness (Lézé, 2014).&lt;ref&gt;* Lézé, Samuel (2014) "[https://www.academia.edu/3581444/Anthropology_of_mental_illness Anthropology of mental illness]", in : Andrew Scull (ed.), ''Cultural Sociology of Mental Illness : an A-to-Z Guide'', Sage, pp. 31-32&lt;/ref&gt;

Under this concept, medical systems would be seen as the specific product of each ethnic group's cultural history. Scientific biomedicine would become another medical system and therefore a cultural form which could be studied as such. This position, which originated in the cultural relativism maintained by cultural anthropology, allowed the debate with medicine and psychiatry to revolve around some fundamental questions:

# The relative influence of genotypical and phenotypical factors in relation to personality and certain forms of pathology, especially psychiatric and psychosomatic pathologies.
# The influence of culture on what a society considers to be normal, pathological or abnormal.
# The verification in different cultures of the universality of the nosological categories of biomedicine and psychiatry.
# The identification and description of diseases belonging to specific cultures which have not been previously described by clinical medicine. These are known as ethnic disorders and, more recently, as culture bound syndromes, and include the evil eye and tarantism among European peasants, being possessed or in a state of trance in many cultures, and nervous anorexia, nerves and premenstrual syndrome in Western societies.

Since the end of the 20th century, medical anthropologists have had a much more sophisticated understanding of the problem of cultural representations and social practices related to health, disease and medical care and attention.&lt;ref&gt;Ialenti, Vincent F., A Review of Humanistic Scholarship on Health Insurance, Policy, and Reform in the United States (April 2011). 2011 Tobin Workshop on Behavioral/Institutional Research and Regulation of the New Health Insurance Market, Cornell Law School, April 28–29, 2011 http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1995046&lt;/ref&gt; These have been understood as being universal with very diverse local forms articulated in transactional processes. The link at the end of this page is included to offer a wide panorama of current positions in medical anthropology.

==Applied medical anthropology==
In the United States, Canada, Mexico and Brazil, collaboration between anthropology and medicine was initially concerned with implementing community health programs among ethnic and cultural minorities and with the qualitative and ethnographic evaluation of health institutions (hospitals and mental hospitals) and primary care services. Regarding the community health programs, the intention was to resolve the problems of establishing these services for a complex mosaic of ethnic groups. The ethnographic evaluation involved analyzing the interclass conflicts within the institutions which had an undesirable effect on their administrative reorganization and their institutional objectives, particularly those conflicts among the doctors, nurses, auxiliary staff and administrative staff. The ethnographic reports show that interclass crises directly affected [[therapeutic]] criteria and care of the ill. They also contributed new methodological criteria for evaluating the new institutions resulting from the reforms as well as experimental care techniques such as therapeutic communities.

The ethnographic evidence supported the criticisms of the institutional custodialism and contributed decisively to policies of deinstitutionalizing psychiatric and social care in general and led to in some countries such as Italy, a rethink of the guidelines on education and promoting health.

The empirical answers to these questions led to the anthropologists being involved in many areas. These include: developing international and community health programs in developing countries; evaluating the influence of social and cultural variables in the [[epidemiology]] of certain forms of psychiatric [[pathology]] (transcultural psychiatry); studying cultural resistance to innovation in therapeutic and care practices; analysing healing practices toward immigrants; and studying traditional healers, folk healers and empirical midwives who may be reinvented as [[health worker]]s (the so-called barefoot doctors).

Also, since the 1960s, biomedicine in developed countries has been faced by a series of problems which demand that we inspect the (unfortunately-named) predisposing social or cultural factors, which have been reduced to mere variables in quantitative protocols and subordinated to causal biological or genetic interpretations. Among these the following are of particular note:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
a) The transition between a dominant system designed for acute infectious pathology to a system designed for chronic degenerative pathology without any specific etiological therapy.

b) The emergence of the need to develop long term treatment mechanisms and strategies, as opposed to incisive therapeutic treatments.

c) The influence of concepts such as quality of life in relation to classic biomedical therapeutic criteria.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Added to these are the problems associated with implementing community health mechanisms. These problems are perceived initially as tools for fighting against unequal access to health services. However, once a comprehensive service is available to the public, new problems emerge from ethnic, cultural or religious differences, or from differences between age groups, genders or social classes.

If implementing community care mechanisms gives rise to one set of problems, then a whole new set of problems also arises when these same mechanisms are dismantled and the responsibilities which they once assumed are placed back on the shoulders of individual members of society.

In all these fields, local and qualitative ethnographic research is indispensable for understanding the way patients and their social networks incorporate knowledge on health and illness when their experience is nuanced by complex cultural influences. These influences result from the nature of social relations in advanced societies and from the influence of social communication media, especially audiovisual media and advertising.

==Agenda==
Currently, research in medical anthropology is one of the main growth areas in the field of anthropology as a whole and important processes of internal specialization are taking place. For this reason, any agenda is always debatable. In general, we may consider the following six basic fields:

* the development of systems of medical knowledge and medical care
* the patient-physician relationship
* the integration of alternative medical systems in culturally diverse environments
* the interaction of social, environmental and biological factors which influence health and illness both in the individual and the community as a whole
*the critical analysis of interaction between psychiatric services and migrant populations ("critical ethnopsychiatry": Beneduce 2004, 2007)
* the impact of biomedicine and biomedical technologies in non-Western settings

Other subjects that have become central to the medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering&lt;ref&gt;Farmer, Paul (1999) ''Infections and Inequalities: The Modern Plagues''. Berkeley, University of California Press. Farmer, Paul (2003) ''Pathologies of Power: Health, Human Rights, and the New War on the Poor''. Berkeley, University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness. On the other hand, there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical production, such as ''cultural psychiatry'' and ''transcultural psychiatry'' or ''ethnopsychiatry''.

==Training==
All medical anthropologists are trained in anthropology as their main discipline. Many come from the health professions such as medicine or nursing, whereas others come from the other backgrounds such as psychology, social work, social education or sociology. Cultural and transcultural psychiatrists are trained as anthropologists and, naturally, psychiatric clinicians. Training in medical anthropology is normally acquired at a master's (M.A. or M.Sc.) and doctoral level. In Latin countries there are specific masters' in medical anthropology, such as in México,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciesas.edu.mx/|title=CIESAS - Centro de Investigaciones y Estudios Superiores en Antropología Social|website=www.ciesas.edu.mx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil,&lt;ref&gt;[[:pt:Antropologia da Saúde]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Spain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urv.cat/masters_oficials/en_antropologia_medica.html|title=University Master's Degree in Medical Anthropology and International Health - Universitat Rovira i Virgili|first=Universitat Rovira i|last=Virgili|website=Universitat Rovira i Virgili}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in the United States universities such as [[Brown University]], [[Washington University in St. Louis]], [[University of South Florida]], [[UC Berkeley]], [[UC San Francisco]], [[University of Connecticut]], [[Johns Hopkins University]], the [[University of Arizona]], the [[University of Alabama]], the [[University of Washington]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://depts.washington.edu/anthweb/programs/medical_grad.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809125332/http://depts.washington.edu/anthweb/programs/medical_grad.php |archivedate=2009-08-09 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;, and [http://www.smu.edu/dedman/academics/departments/anthropology Southern Methodist University] offer PhD programs focused on this subject. In Asia, the University of the Philippines Manila offers both the Master of Science and master's degrees in Medical Anthropology. The [[University of South Florida]], the [[University of Arizona]], the [[University of Connecticut]], the [[University of Washington]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://depts.washington.edu/anthweb/programs/medical_concurrentdegree.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810154851/http://depts.washington.edu/anthweb/programs/medical_concurrentdegree.php |archivedate=2009-08-10 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; and others also offer a dual degree (MA/PhD) in applied anthropology with an MPH. In the UK, MSc and PhD programs are offered at [[University College, London]], the [[University of Oxford]], the [[University of Edinburgh]] and [[Durham University]].  A fairly comprehensive account of different postgraduate training courses in different countries can be found on the website of the ''Society of Medical Anthropology'' of the ''American Anthropological Association''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.medanthro.net/academic/grad/index.html | title=graduate programs in medical anthropology | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030422030416/http://www.medanthro.net/academic/grad/index.html | archivedate=2003-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mud-march-poster.jpg |thumb|Poster advertising the march and meeting, 9 February 1907]]
The '''United Procession of Women''', or '''Mud March''' as it became known, was a peaceful demonstration in London on 9 February 1907 organised by the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]] (NUWSS), in which more than three thousand women marched from [[Hyde Park Corner]] to the [[Strand, London|Strand]] in support of [[Women's suffrage|votes for women]]. Women from all classes participated in what was the largest public demonstration supporting [[women's suffrage]] seen up to that date. It acquired the name "Mud March" from the day's weather, when incessant heavy rain left the marchers drenched and mud-spattered.

The proponents of women's suffrage were divided between those who favoured constitutional methods and those who supported [[direct action]]. In 1903 [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] formed the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU). Known as the [[suffragettes]], the WSPU held demonstrations, heckled politicians, and from 1905 saw several of its members imprisoned, gaining press attention and increased support from women. To maintain that momentum and create support for a new suffrage bill in the [[House of Commons]], the NUWSS and other groups organised the Mud March to coincide with the opening of Parliament. The event attracted much public interest and broadly sympathetic press coverage, but when the bill was presented the following month, it was [[Filibuster#Westminster-style parliaments|"talked out"]] without a vote.

While the march failed to influence the immediate parliamentary process, it had a considerable impact on public awareness and on the movement's future tactics. Large peaceful public demonstrations, never previously attempted, became standard features of the suffrage campaign; on 21 June 1908 up to half a million people attended [[Women's Sunday]], a WSPU rally in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]. The marches showed that the fight for women's suffrage had the support of women in every stratum of society, who despite their social differences were able to unite and work together for a common cause.

In October 1897 [[Millicent Fawcett]] was the driving force behind the formation of the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]] (NUWSS), a new umbrella organisation for all the factions and regional societies, and to liaise with sympathetic [[Member of parliament#United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|MPs]]. Initially, seventeen groups affiliated to the new central body. The organisation became the leading body following a constitutional path to women's suffrage.{{sfn|Hawksley|2017|p=64}}{{sfn|"Founding of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies", UK Parliament}}{{sfn|Holton|2008}} In October 1903 [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] and her daughter [[Christabel Pankhurst]] formed a women-only group in Manchester, the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU). Although the NUWSS sought its objectives through constitutional means, such as petitions to parliament,{{sfn|Purvis|2018|p=2}} the WSPU organised open-air meetings and heckled politicians, choosing jail over fines when prosecuted.{{sfn|Smith|2014|p=39}} From 1906 they began to use the nickname "suffragettes", which differentiate them from the constitutionalist "suffragists".{{sfn|"Suffragists or suffragettes", BBC}}{{efn|In January 1906 the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' coined the term ''suffragettes'' for WSPU members; they adopted the label with pride.{{sfn|"Suffragists or suffragettes", BBC}}{{sfn|Crawford|2003|p=452}}}}

At the time of the Mud March, before the suffragette campaign had progressed to damaging property, relations between the WSPU and NUWSS remained cordial.{{sfn|Cowman|2010|p=65}} When eleven suffragettes were jailed in October 1906 after a protest in the [[House of Commons]] lobby, Fawcett and the NUWSS stood by them; on 27 October 1906, in a letter to ''[[The Times]]'', she wrote:

{{quotation|The real responsibility for these sensational methods lies with the politicians, misnamed statesmen, who will not attend to a demand for justice until it is accompanied by some form of violence. Every kind of insult and abuse is hurled at the women who have adopted these methods, especially by the "reptile" press. But I hope the more old-fashioned suffragists will stand by them; and I take this opportunity of staying that in my opinion, far from having injured the movement, they have done more during the last twelve months to bring it within the region of practical politics than we have been able to accomplish in the same number of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hume|2016|p=30}}, citing {{harvnb|Fawcett|1906|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The militant actions of the WSPU raised the profile of the women's suffrage campaign in Britain and the NUWSS wanted to show that they were as committed as the suffragettes to the cause.{{sfn|Hume|2016|p=32}}{{sfn|Smith|2014|p=23}} In January 1906 the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], led by [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]], had won an overwhelming [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|general election victory]]; although before the election many Liberal MPs had promised that the [[Liberal government, 1905–1915|new administration]] would introduce a women's suffrage bill, once in power, Campbell-Bannerman said that it was "not realistic" to introduce new legislation.{{sfn|Hawksley|2017|p=129}} A month after the election, the WSPU [[1906 WSPU march|held a successful London march]], attended by 300–400 women.{{sfn|Kelly|2004|pp=333–334}} To show there was support for a suffrage bill, the Central Society for Women's Suffrage suggested, in November 1906, holding a mass procession in London to coincide with the opening of Parliament in February.{{sfn|Tickner|1988|p=74}}{{sfn|Hume|2016|p=32}} The NUWSS called on its members to join in.{{sfn|Hume|2016|p=34}}

==March==
===Organisation===
[[File:Philippa Strachey in 1921 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|[[Pippa Strachey]]]]
The task of organising the event, scheduled for Saturday, 9 February 1907, was delegated to [[Pippa Strachey]]{{sfn|Caine|2004}} of the Central Society for Women's Suffrage.{{efn|In 1907 the Central Society for Women's Suffrage, the organiser of the Mud March, became the London Society for Women's Suffrage (LSWS).{{sfn|Crawford|2003|p=104}} Based at 25 Victoria Street, with 62 London branches, it was a middle-class organisation with the aim, according to Sowon S. Park, of "equal suffrage". By 1912 it had 4,000 members and 20,000 "friends". It became the London Society for Women's Service in 1919. [[Pippa Strachey]] was secretary of the LSWS from 1914 to 1919 and secretary of the London Society for Women's Service from 1919 to 1926, when the latter became the London and National Society for Women's Service.{{sfn|Park|2005|p=125}} }} Her mother, Lady [[Jane Maria Strachey|Jane Strachey]], a friend of Fawcett, was a long-standing suffragist, but Pippa Strachey had shown little interest in the issue before a meeting with [[Emily Davies]], who quickly converted her to the cause. She took on the organisation of the London march with no experience of doing anything similar, but carried out the task so effectively that she was given responsibility for the planning of all future large processions of the NUWSS.{{sfn|Caine|2004}} On 29 January the executive committee of the London Society determined the order of the procession and arranged for advertisements to be placed in the ''[[Tribune (Liberal Party newspaper)|Tribune]]'' and ''[[The Morning Post]]''.{{sfn|Tickner|1988|p=74}}

Regional suffrage societies and other organisations were invited to bring delegations to the march. The art historian [[Lisa Tickner]] writes that "all sensibilities and political disagreements had to be soothed" to make sure the various groups would take part. The Women's Cooperative Guild would attend only if certain conditions were met, and the [[British Women's Temperance Association]] and [[Women's Liberal Federation]] (WLF) would not attend if the WSPU was formally invited. The WLF—a "crucial lever on the Liberal government", according to Tickner—objected to the WSPU's criticism of the government.{{sfn|Smith|2014|p=23}}{{sfn|Tickner|1988|p=74}} At the time of the march, ten of the twenty women who sat on the NUWSS executive committee were connected to the Liberal Party.{{sfn|Hume|2016|p=36}}

The march would begin at [[Hyde Park Corner]] and progress via [[Piccadilly]] to [[Exeter Hall]], a large meeting venue on the [[Strand, London|Strand]].{{sfn|Hill|2002|p=154}} A second, open-air meeting was scheduled for [[Trafalgar Square]].{{sfn|''The Observer'', "Titled Demonstrators" ("Mr Hardie's Speech"), 10 February 1907}} Members of the [[Artists' Suffrage League]] produced posters and postcards for the march.{{sfn|Crawford|2003|p=16}} In all, around forty organisations from all over the country chose to participate.{{sfn|Smith|2014|p=23}}

===9 February===
[[File:Band at the Mud March.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The band and lead banner]]
On the morning of 9 February, large numbers of women converged on the march's starting point, the [[Wellington Monument, London|statue of Achilles]] near Hyde Park Corner.{{sfn|Crawford|2003|p=438}} Between three and four thousand women were assembled, from all ages and strata of society, in appalling weather with incessant rain; "mud, mud, mud" was the dominant feature of the day, wrote Fawcett.{{sfn|Fawcett|1925|p=190}} The marchers included [[Frances Balfour|Lady Frances Balfour]], sister-in-law of [[Arthur Balfour]], the former [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] prime minister; [[Rosalind Howard, Countess of Carlisle|Rosalind Howard]], the Countess of Carlisle, of the Women's Liberal Federation; the poet and trade unionist [[Eva Gore-Booth]]; and the veteran campaigner [[Emily Davies]].{{sfn|Crawford|2003|pp=30, 98, 159 and 250}} The march's aristocratic representation was matched by numbers of professional women&amp;nbsp;– doctors, schoolmistresses, artists{{sfn|Tickner|1988|p=75, citing the ''Tribune''}}&amp;nbsp;– and large contingents of working women from northern and other provincial cities, marching under banners that proclaimed their varied trades: bank-and-bobbin winders, cigar makers, clay-pipe finishers, power-loom weavers, shirt makers.{{sfn|''The Observer'', "Titled Demonstrators" ("The Procession"), 10 February 1907}}

Although the WSPU was not officially represented, many of its members attended, including Christabel Pankhurst, [[Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, Baroness Pethick-Lawrence|Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence]], [[Annie Kenney]], [[Anne Cobden-Sanderson]], [[Nellie Martel]], [[Edith How-Martyn]], [[Flora Drummond]], [[Charlotte Despard]] and [[Gertrude Ansell]].{{sfn|Atkinson|2018|p=60}}{{sfn|''The Observer'', "Titled Demonstrators", 10 February 1907}}{{sfn|''The Sphere'', 16 February 1907}} According to the historian [[Diane Atkinson]], "belonging to both organisations, going to each others' events and wearing both badges was quite usual".{{sfn|Atkinson|2018|p=60}}

[[File:Mud March, 9 February 1907, Illustrated London News.jpg||thumb|upright=1.3|left|At the head of the march ''(left to right)'', Lady [[Frances Balfour]] in the light coat, [[Millicent Garrett Fawcett]], and Lady [[Jane Maria Strachey|Jane Strachey]]]]
By around 2.30&amp;nbsp;pm the march had formed a line that stretched far down [[Rotten Row]]. It set off in the drenching rain, with a brass band leading and Lady Frances Balfour, Millicent Fawcett and Lady Jane Strachey at the head of the column.{{sfn|Hume|2016|p=34}} The procession was followed by a phalanx of carriages and motor cars, many of which carried flags bearing the letters "WS", red and white banners and bouquets of red and white flowers.{{sfn|Tickner|1988|p=121}}{{sfn|Tickner|2004|p=347}} Despite the weather, thousands thronged the pavements to enjoy the novel spectacle of "respectable women marching in the streets", according to the historian Harold Smith.{{sfn|Smith|2014|p=23}}

''[[The Observer]]''{{'}}s reporter recorded that "there was hardly any of the derisive laughter which had greeted former female demonstrations",{{sfn|''The Observer'', "Titled Demonstrators" ("The Procession"), 10 February 1907}} although ''[[The Morning Post]]'' reported "scoffs and jeers of enfranchised males who had posted themselves along the line of the route, and appeared to regard the occasion as suitable for the display of crude and vulgar jests".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|2013|p=137}}, citing {{harvnb|''The Morning Post'', 11 February 1907}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Katharine Frye]], who joined the march at [[Piccadilly Circus]], recorded "not much joking at our expense and no roughness".{{sfn|Crawford, Elizabeth. "Kate Frye's Suffrage Diary"}}{{sfn|Crawford|2013|p=29}} The ''[[Daily Mail]]''—which supported women's suffrage—carried an eyewitness account, "How It Felt", by [[Constance Smedley]] of the Lyceum Club. Smedley described a divided reaction from the crowd "that shared by the poorer class of men, namely, bitter resentment at the possibility of women getting any civic privilege they had not got; the other that of amusement at the fact of women wanting any serious thing&amp;nbsp;... badly enough to face the ordeal of a public  demonstration".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelly|2004|p=337}}, citing {{harvnb|Smedley|1907|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rally at Trafalgar Square, part of the Mud March.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The rally at the base of [[Nelson's Column]], [[Trafalgar Square]]]]
Approaching Trafalgar Square the march divided: representatives from the northern industrial towns broke off for an open-air meeting at [[Nelson's Column]], which had been arranged by the Northern Franchise Demonstration Committee.{{sfn|''The Observer'', "Titled Demonstrators" ("Mr Hardie's Speech"), 10 February 1907}}{{sfn|Tickner|1988|p=75}} The main march continued to Exeter Hall, for a meeting chaired by the Liberal politician [[Walter McLaren]], whose wife, [[Eva McLaren]], was one of the scheduled speakers.{{sfn|Crawford, Elizabeth. "Kate Frye's Suffrage Diary"}} [[Keir Hardie]], leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], told the meeting, to hissing from several Liberal women on the platform, that if women won the vote, it would be thanks to the "suffragettes' fighting brigade".{{sfn|Atkinson|2018|p=60}}{{sfn|Pankhurst|1911|p=135}} He spoke strongly in favour of the meeting's resolution, which was carried, that women be given the vote on the same basis as men,{{sfn|Crawford|2003|p=273}} and demanded a bill in the current parliamentary session.{{sfn|''Daily Mail'', 11 February 1907}} At the Trafalgar Square meeting, Eva Gore-Booth referred to the "alienation of the Labour Party through the action of a certain section in the suffrage movement", according to ''The Observer'', and asked the party "not to punish the millions of women workers" because of the actions of a small minority. When Hardie arrived from Exeter Hall, he expressed the hope that "no working man bring discredit on the class to which he belonged by denying to women those political rights which their fathers had won for them".{{sfn|''The Observer'', "Titled Demonstrators" ("Mr Hardie's Speech"), 10 February 1907}}

==Aftermath==
===Press reaction===
[[File:Front page of The Daily Mirror, reporting the Mud March.jpg|thumb|Front page of ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'', 11 February 1907]]
The press coverage gave the movement "more publicity in a week", according to one commentator, "than it had enjoyed in the previous fifty years".{{sfn|Hill|2002|p=154}} Tickner writes that the reporting was "inflected by the sympathy or otherwise of particular newspapers for the suffrage cause".{{sfn|Tickner|1988|p=75}} ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'', neutral on the issue of women's suffrage, offered a large photospread,{{sfn|Kelly|2004|p=337}} and praised the crowd's diversity.{{sfn|''The Daily Mirror'', 11 February 1907}} The ''Tribune'' also commented on the mix of social classes represented in the marchers.{{sfn|Tickner|1988|p=75, citing the ''Tribune''}} ''[[The Times]]'', an opponent of women's suffrage,{{sfn|Kelly|2004|p=337}} thought the event "remarkable as much for its representative character as for its size", describing the scenes and speeches in detail over 20 column inches.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelly|2004|p=338}}, citing {{harvnb|''The Times'', 11 February 1907|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The protesters had had to "run the gauntlet of much inconsiderate comment", according to the ''[[Daily  Chronicle]]'', a publication supportive of women's suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelly|2004|p=337}}, citing the {{harvnb|''Daily Chronicle'', 11 February 1907.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pictorial journal ''[[The Sphere]]'' provided a montage of photographs under the headline "The Attack on Man's Supremacy".{{sfn|''The Sphere'', 16 February 1907}} ''[[The Graphic]]'', a pro-suffrage paper, published a series of illustrations sympathetic to the event, except for one that showed a man holding aloft a pair of scissors "suggesting that demonstrating women should have their tongues cut out", according to Katherine Kelly in a study of how the suffrage movement was portrayed in the British press.{{sfn|Kelly|2004|p=337}} Some newspapers, including ''The Times'' and the ''Daily Mail'' carried pieces written by the marchers.{{sfn|Kelly|2004|p=337}}

In its leading article, ''[[The Observer]]'' warned that "the vital civic duty and natural function of women&amp;nbsp;... is the healthy propagation of race", and that the aim of the movement was "nothing less than complete sex emancipation".{{efn|''[[The Observer]]''{{'}}s leading article on the day following the march also stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;It is not so much who is to mind the baby&amp;nbsp;... but a question concerning the fundamental idea of sex, and the effects physical, mental and economic, that any revolutionary change in the conditions of women's life must have on the vital civic duty and natural function of women—which is the healthy propagation of race.&amp;nbsp;... What is aimed at is nothing less than complete sex emancipation; the right of women not only to vote, but to enter public life on equal conditions with men. It is a physical problem before all things, and an economic problem of great complexity and difficulty.&amp;nbsp;... It is the fact that woman are not educated to take any rational interest in politics, history, economics, science, philosophy or the serious side of life, which they, as the embodiment of the lighter side, are brought up, and have been brought up since the days of Edenic beginnings, to consider as the privilege and property of the stronger sex. The small section of women who desire the vote completely ignore the educational feature of the whole question, as they do the natural laws of physical force and the teachings of history about men and Government.{{sfn|''The Observer'', "Lady Day", 10 February 1907}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; }} It was concerned that women were not ready for the vote. The movement should educate its own sex, it said, rather than "seeking to confound men". The newspaper nevertheless welcomed that there had been "no attempts to bash policemen's helmets, to tear down the railings of the Park, to utter piercing war cries&amp;nbsp;..."{{sfn|''The Observer'', "Lady Day", 10 February 1907}} Likewise, ''[[The Daily News (UK)|The Daily News]]'' compared the event favourably to the actions of suffragettes: "Such a demonstration is far more likely to prove the reality of the demand for a vote than the practice of breaking up meetings held by Liberal Associations."{{sfn|''The Daily News'', 11 February 1907}} ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' agreed: "For those&amp;nbsp;... who, like ourselves, wish to see this movement&amp;nbsp;– a great movement, as will one day be recognised&amp;nbsp;– carried through in such a way as to win respect even where it cannot command agreement Saturday's demonstration was of good omen."{{sfn|''The Manchester Guardian'', 11 February 1907}}

===Dickinson Bill===
[[File:Sir Willoughby Dickinson.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Willoughby Dickinson]] MP, sponsor of the failed 1907 suffrage bill]]
Four days after the march, the NUWSS executive met with the Parliamentary Committee for Women's Suffrage (founded 1893) to discuss a [[Private Members' Bills in the Parliament of the United Kingdom|private member's bill]].{{sfn|Hume|2016|p=34}}{{sfn|Crawford|2003|p=529}} On the same day, the suffragettes held their first "Women's Parliament" at [[Caxton Hall]], after which 400 women marched toward the Commons to protest against the omission from the [[State Opening of Parliament|King's Speech]], the day before, of a women's suffrage bill; over 60 were arrested, and 53 chose prison over a fine.{{sfn|Zangwill|1907}}{{sfn|Purvis|2018|pp=126–127}}

On 26 February 1907 the Liberal MP for [[St Pancras North (UK Parliament constituency)|St Pancras North]], [[Willoughby Dickinson]], published the text of a bill proposing that women should have the vote subject to the same property qualification that applied to men. This would, it was estimated, enfranchise between one and two million women.{{sfn|Morris|1921|p=42}} (On the day the bill was published, the [[Cambridge Union]] passed by a small majority a motion "that this House would view with regret the extension of the franchise to women".){{sfn|''The Manchester Guardian'', 27 February 1907}} Although the bill received strong backing from the suffragist movement, it was viewed more equivocally in the House of Commons, some of whose members regarded it as giving more votes to the propertied classes, but doing nothing for working women.{{sfn|Morris|1921|p=43}} On 8 March Dickinson introduced his Women's Enfranchisement Bill to the House of Commons for its [[second reading]], with a plea that members should not be swayed by their distaste for militant actions;{{sfn|Hume|2016|pp=34–35}} the House of Commons "Ladies Gallery" was kept closed during the debate in case of protests by the WSPU.{{sfn|Raeburn|1974|p=49}} The debate was inconclusive and the bill was [[Filibuster#Westminster-style parliaments|"talked out"]] without a vote.{{sfn|Hume|2016|p=35}}{{sfn|''The Manchester Guardian'', 9 March 1907}} The NUWSS had worked hard for the bill and found the response insulting.{{sfn|Hume|2016|p=35}}

===Legacy===
{{further|Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928}}
The Mud March was the largest-ever public demonstration at that time in support of woman's suffrage.{{sfn|Hume|2016|p=34}} Although it brought little by way of immediate progress on the parliamentary front, its significance in the general suffrage campaign was considerable. By embracing activism, the constitutionalists' tactics become closer to those of the WSPU, at least in relation to the latter's non-violent activities.{{sfn|Pankhurst|1911|p=135}} In her 1988 study of the suffrage campaign, Tickner observes that "modest and uncertain as it was by subsequent standards, [the march] established the precedent of large-scale processions, carefully ordered and publicised, accompanied by banners, bands and the colours of the participant societies."{{sfn|Tickner|1988|p=78}} The feminist politician [[Ray Strachey]] wrote:

{{quote|In that year the vast majority of women still felt that there was something very dreadful in walking in procession through the streets; to do it was to be something of a martyr, and many of the demonstrators felt that they were risking their employments and endangering their reputations, besides facing a dreadful ordeal of ridicule and public shame. They walked, and nothing happened. The small boys in the streets and the gentlemen at the club windows laughed, but that was all. Crowds watched and wondered; and it was not so dreadful after all&amp;nbsp;... the idea of a public demonstration of faith in the Cause took root.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tickner|1988|p=78}}, citing {{harvnb|Strachey|1928|p=36}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The march marked a change in perception of the NUWSS from what ''The Manchester Guardian'' described as "regional debating society" into the sphere of "practical politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|2013|p=137}}, citing {{harvnb|''The Manchester Guardian'', 11 February 1907}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Jane Chapman]], in her study ''Gender, Citizenship and Newspapers'', the Mud March "established a precedent for advance press publicity".{{sfn|Chapman|2013|p=137}}

The failure of Dickinson's bill brought about a change in the NUWSS's strategy; it began to intervene directly in by-elections, on behalf of the candidate of any party who would publicly support women's suffrage. In 1907 the NUWSS supported the Conservatives in [[Hexham (UK Parliament constituency)|Hexham]] and Labour in [[Jarrow (UK Parliament constituency)|Jarrow]]; where no suitable candidate was available they used the by-election to propagandise. This tactic met with sufficient success for the NUWSS to resolve that it would fight in all future by-elections,{{sfn|Hume|2016|p=38}} and between 1907 and 1909 they had been involved in 31 by-elections.{{sfn|Crawford|2003|p=438}}

From 1907 until the start of the First World War, the NUWSS and suffragettes held several peaceful demonstrations. On 13 June 1908 over 10,000 women took part in a London march organised by the NUWSS,{{sfn|Crawford|2003|p=438}} and on 21 June that year the suffragettes organised [[Women's Sunday]] in Hyde Park, attended by up to half a million.{{sfn|Holton|2003|p=46}} During the NUWSS's [[Great Pilgrimage]] of April 1913, women marched from all over the country to London for a mass rally in Hyde Park, which 50,000 attended.{{sfn|Fara|2018|p=67}} &lt;!-- Their struggles were rewarded after the [[First World War]], when women were partly enfranchised by the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]], which granted the vote to women over 30 who owned property with a rateable value above £5, or whose husbands did; women then constituted 39.6 per cent of the electorate. The restriction that only those eligible to vote in the local elections by virtue of their property status meant that approximately 22 per cent of women aged 30 and above were not enfranchised.{{sfn|Smith|2014|p=95}} The Act also extended the franchise for men aged 21 or over.{{sfn|"1918 Representation of the People Act". Houses of Parliament.}} Full enfranchisement of all women over 21 came ten years later, when the  [[Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928| Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act]] of 1928 was passed by a [[Second Baldwin ministry|Conservative government]] under [[Stanley Baldwin]].{{sfn|"1928 Equal Franchise Act". UK Parliament.}} --&gt;

The Mud March is featured in window No. 4 of the stained-glass Dearsley Windows in [[St Stephen's Hall]] in the [[Palace of Westminster]]. The window includes panels depicting, among other things, the formation of the NUWSS, WSPU and [[Women's Freedom League]], the NUWSS's Great Pilgrimage, the force-feeding of suffragettes, the [[Cat and Mouse Act]] and the death in 1913 of [[Emily Davison]]. The window was installed in 2002 as a memorial to the long and ultimately successful campaign for women's suffrage.{{sfn|"Dearsley Window 4, 1897–1997".

:''For nationalist movements in general, see [[Nationalism]].  For other meanings of ''activism,'' see [[Activism]].''

The '''Nationalist activism''' was an [[elitism|elitist]] political movement of the early 20th century in [[Scandinavia]], [[Finland]] and the [[Baltic countries]]. The ''Activists'' advocated in brief a close cooperation with [[Imperial Germany]], and active support of Germany's military aims &amp;mdash; primarily directed against [[Imperial Russia]], [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevist Russia]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. The activism was revived in both Finland and [[Sweden]] in connection with the [[Winter War]].

This ''activism'' was ideologically related, although distantly, to the thoughts that would result in [[Fascism]] in [[Italy]]. Activists were often ardent [[anti-Communism|anti-Socialists]] and deeply suspicious of [[democracy]] and [[parliamentarism]].

In Scandinavia, activist policies were judged unsuccessful when occasionally (half-ways) implemented, as in the years before the dissolution of the [[Sweden-Norway|union between Sweden and Norway]] and in Sweden in the first two years of [[World War I]]; but in Finland the Activism was seen as successful in establishing the [[White Guard (Finland)|White Guard]], the German-trained [[Finnish Jägers|Jägers]], the victory in the [[Finnish Civil War]], and the thereby secured independence.

While in Finland the ''activism'' would continue in movements of the [[interbellum]]: the [[Academic Karelia Society]], the [[Lapua movement]] and the [[Patriotic People's Movement (Finland)|Patriotic People's Movement]]; in the Baltic countries and Sweden it hardly survived outside some narrow circles of military officers, industrialists and aristocrats with political ambitions.

In Latvia Nationalist activism was represent by [[Pērkonkrusts]].

In [[Estonia]] was Nationalistic [[Vaps Movement]].

'''Prisons in Slovakia''' are fully owned and operated by the state. In 2004, [[Slovakia]] had 8 891 prisoners, representing 165 per 100 000 of the national population. By the end of 2010 the prison population has risen to 10 031 prisoners (184 per 100 000 citizens).&lt;ref name=ICPS&gt;{{cite web|title=Country: Slovakia|url=http://www.prisonstudies.org/info/worldbrief/wpb_country.php?country=163|publisher=International Centre for Prison Studies|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, Slovakia had 18 correctional institutions capable of holding 9 500 inmates (other sources claim 10 615). Of these, five are devoted to pre-trial detainees, nine for sentenced prisoners, and four for a combination of sentenced prisoners and pre-trial detainees.

The prison system is administered by the Slovak General Directorate of the Prison and Court Guard Corps (current Director General is Col. Mgr. Róbert Mudronček, since 1 October 2010&lt;ref name=WebNoviny&gt;{{cite news|last=Duba|first=Peter|title=Slovakia has a New Prison Service Chief|url=http://www.webnoviny.sk/english-news/slovakia-has-a-new-prison-service-chief/228281-clanok.html|accessdate=12 April 2012|newspaper=WebNoviny|date=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ) falling under the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic. Current occupancy level of the Slovak prison system is 94.5%. According to newspaper SME, currently there is no place for convicted criminals evading their sentences, if they were to be arrested by the Slovak police, there would simply be no place where to detain them.&lt;ref name=SMEPovazska&gt;{{cite news|last=Trško|first=Michal|title=Prisoner fight in Ilava was caused by love|url=http://povazska.sme.sk/c/6333009/za-bitkou-vaznov-v-ilave-bola-laska.html|accessdate=12 April 2012|newspaper=SME|date=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Slovak Ministry of Justice, the number of convicted prisoners is critical, despite the fact that 9 prisons lowered the minimal space per prisoner to lower values than mandated by law.&lt;ref name=Plusky&gt;{{cite news|title=Vláda prerokuje koncepciu väzenstva na budúce roky (The Government will pass the Conception of the Prison System for the upcoming years)|url=http://www.plusky.sk/slovensko/vlada-prerokuje-koncepciu-vazenstva-na-buduce-roky/|accessdate=26 April 2012|newspaper=Plusky.sk|date=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Czechoslovakia]] inherited a prison system from Austria-Hungary that is considered relatively progressive, with the facilities cited as being among the better prisons in [[Europe]]. As late as during the 1940s the prison system still incorporated the Leopoldov structure, originally built in 1669 to defend against the Turkish invaders. Between 1865 and 1952, Slovakia's [[prison system]] was controlled by the General Directorate of the Corps of Prison and Court Guard, under the Ministry of Justice, an organisational scheme similar to the one still in use today.

The country's oldest prisons date from the 17th century. Two of the largest prisons, [[Leopoldov Prison]] and [[Ilava Prison]] were reconstructed from an army fortress and a monastery respectively, both during [[Austria-Hungary]]. The largest prisons have a capacity of 600 - 900 prisoners.

=== Prison unrest of 1989 ===
At the end of 1989, Czechoslovakia overthrew [[communism]] in its [[velvet revolution]]. Coinciding with the social and political changes outside, prisoners all around the country became rebellious. In Slovakia, the unrest started in December 1989 in Zeliezovce prison. In many prisons the inmates constructed simple banners out of [[bed sheets]] with slogans similar to those worn by protesters in the squares. Also, the prisoners started organizing themselves creating self-governing commissions and choosing spokespersons to represent their demands. Prison unrest became the focus of daily news coverage in Slovakia and situation escalated to the point, where several government ministers and the prime minister personally came to conduct negotiations to [[Leopoldov Prison]].

== Description ==
The most serious offenders are housed at Ilava, Leopoldov, or Ružomberok.

In 2011 the average cost of imprisoning one person in Slovakia was 37.26 [[euro]] per day. Each prisoner and detainee is obliged by law to pay 3.09 euro per day, an obligation that many people manage to evade. The total unpaid sum rose to 11.7 million euro as of June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Nový Čas, 4.7.2011, Page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years 2012-2013 the Prison and Court Guard Corps is planning to re-equip its officers with new pistols and machine guns, yet the new arms are not part of the State Budget.&lt;ref name=SME&gt;{{cite news|last=SITA|title=Väznice majú lepšie oplotenie a kamery (Prisons should get better fences and surveillance cameras)|url=http://www.sme.sk/c/6352547/vaznice-maju-lepsie-oplotenie-a-kamery.html|accessdate=26 April 2012|newspaper=SME|date=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Public Ministry of [[Costa Rica]] was created by [[law]] of the [[Republic]], has not yet enshrined in the [[Constitution]]. The body that exists today, as auxiliary institution of the modern [[Public administration|administration]] of [[justice]], dating back thirty-four years to the date despite its essence as a republican institution is the product of over one hundred and fifty years of history and constitutional independent.

Initially, officials had to know a vast amount of material, all related to [[Sovereign state|State]] interests, among which highlighted three main aspects: the hacendaria the [[asset]]s and [[criminal]]. The Criminal Matters came to prevail over the others, because hacendaria remained in the area of the executive branch and as "criminal hacendario" in the Public Ministry. The matter "criminal hacendaria" was of little significance, since its laws unique to the administrative procedure reserved most of the activities, for its part, the [[art]] [[wiktionary:Heritage|heritage]] was as a task for the Attorney General's Office in a relatively equal terms with private subject.

==Organizational structure==
The Public Ministry is made up of different units and prosecutors' offices, including:

* Prosecutor General's Office.
* Fiscal [[Committee|Council]].
* Prosecution of the Deputy Attorney General.
* Assistant General Procuratorates.
* Office of Technical and [[International Relations]].
* Unit [[Tax]] Inspectorate.
* [[Prosecutor]]s from the Attorney General.
* Training and Monitoring Unit.
* Administrative Unit.
* Unit [[Property]] Crime.
* [[Drug]] Trafficking and [[Juvenile delinquency|Juvenile]].
* Deputy [[Economy|Economic]] Crime, [[Wikt:corruption|Corruption]] and Tax.
* Enforcement of the [[Sanctions (law)|penalty]].
* Unit scams.
* Unit [[vehicle]] thefts.
* [[Domestic Violence]] Unit and [[Sex Crime]]s.
* Deputy Environment.
* [[Civil Defense]] Office of the Victim.
* Office of Information and Guidance for the Victim.

==The Civil Defense Office of the Victim==
It is an office that supplies to victims of a [[crime]] the services of a [[legal]] representative, to help them obtain compensation for the damages they have suffered.

The [[Civil Defense]] Office of the Victim is under the Public Ministry and began its work on January 1, 1998, with the entry into force of the [[Code of Criminal Procedure]].

The [[professional]] service provided by this office is absolutely free and is to assign the victim a [[lawyer]], who performs the procedures necessary to enable the accused or who responds by him, paid the damages caused. This is called "civil action for damages." If the office finds that it did have enough [[resources]] to hire a legal representative who leads the particular case, carry out the formalities to pay for professional services received.

==Office of Information and Guidance for Victim==
Created with the purpose of guiding the victim and reduce their problems during the development of the criminal proceedings. Seeks to provide assistance as quickly as possible, because if the aid is late, worsens the situation of persons injured and that is precisely what we are trying to avoid. This Office is also attached to the Public Ministry and is on the sixth floor of the Courts of the First Judicial Circuit.

'''''Rokker Radio''''' was a radio programme which has been broadcast on [[BBC Three Counties Radio]] since April 2006 for [[Romani people|Romanies]] and the [[Irish Traveller|travelling community]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/threecounties/content/articles/2006/03/29/local_radio_rokker_feature.shtml?focuswin ''BBC - Rokker Radio'']&lt;/ref&gt; The programme was discontinued late in 2008.

It is the only radio programme for Traveller Communities in the UK.

==Background==

Used to go out on Sunday evenings from 19:00 to 21:00. In August 2006, the programme expanded to several [[BBC Local Radio]] Stations across the east of England including [[BBC Radio Essex]], [[BBC Radio Cambridgeshire]] and [[BBC Radio Norfolk]]. One of the secondary purposes of Rokker Radio is to educate the 'settled' community in the ways and lifestyles of People of [[No Fixed Abode]], [[showmen]], [[Romanichal|travellers]] (or those who would be).

The show was first produced by Karen Shrosbery, then Paul Scoins, David Landau and [[Victoria Cook]] and was presented by Romani journalist [[Jake Bowers]]

== Etymology ==
The name Sembadavar is mythologically connected to the principal [[Hindu]] god [[Shiva]]. The name is derived from the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] words ''Sambu,'' a name of Shiva and ''Padavar'' meaning boatmen thus literally meaning "Shiva's boatmen".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.no/books?id=TTQKoe4eXzgC&amp;q=sembadavar&amp;dq=sembadavar&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwintaHHtMLdAhVJWiwKHcJxAjcQ6AEIKDAA|title=Madras District Gazetteers|last=State)|first=Madras (India :|date=1962|publisher=Superintendent, Government Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=154|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name might also be derived from ''Sem'' meaning good and ''Padavar'' thus literally meaning "good boatmen".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.no/books?hl=no&amp;id=jRIwAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=sembadavan+good&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=sembadavan|title=People of India|last=Singh|first=Kumar Suresh|last2=India|first2=Anthropological Survey of|date=2001|publisher=Anthropological Survey of India|year=|isbn=9788185938882|location=|pages=725, 1312|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==

=== Mythological origin ===
According to one legend was Shiva fond of one of their chief deity [[Ankalaparamecuvari|''Ankalamman'']]. Out of the union was ''Parvatha Rajan'' (king of the [[Parvata Kingdom]]) born who disguised himself as a boatman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.no/books?hl=no&amp;id=l2nXAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=ankalamman+sembadavan&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Cempatavar|title=Aṅkāḷaparamēcuvari, a Goddess of Tamilnadu: Her Myths and Cult|last=Masilamani-Meyer|first=Eveline|date=1986|publisher=Steiner Verlag Wiesbaden|year=|isbn=9783515047029|location=|pages=98–101|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; His boat was made of copper, the [[Vedas]] assumed the form of his fishing net and the [[Rakshasa|Rakshasas]] took the form of the pisces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Accidentally was a [[rishi]] caught in his net, who angered called Parvatha Rajan a "Sembu Padavar" meaning "copper boatmen" and cursed his descendants to become fishermen. From this myth do they call themselves as Sembadavar or also ''Parvatha Rajakulam'' (meaning descendant of Parvatha Raja).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.no/books?id=10IwAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=sembadavan&amp;dq=sembadavan&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidhbCMvsLdAhWriKYKHfQLBkM4ChDoAQg6MAM|title=Global encyclopaedia of the South Indian Dalit's ethnography|last=Singh|first=Nagendra Kumar|date=2006|publisher=Global Vision Publishing House|year=|isbn=9788182201675|location=|pages=693|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-independence==
In 1947, the fisheries became a monopoly of the new independent Indian government.

{{as of|2011}}, Parvatharajakulam is classified as a [[Other Backward Class|Most backward caste]] by the Governments of [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Pondicherry]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tn.gov.in/bcmbcmw/bclist.htm|title= List of Backward Classes approved by the Government of Tamil Nadu |accessdate= 1 April 2011|publisher= Government of Tamil Nadu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:South African Sheepdog Association (logo).jpg|thumb|200px|right]]
The '''South African Sheepdog Association (SASDA)''' is an association responsible for organising and controlling [[herding dog|sheepdog]] related activities in [[South Africa]]. This involves overseeing the competitions ([[sheepdog trial]]s) that are held by regional clubs during the year and maintaining the [[Stud (animal)|stud]] book to manage the registration of sheepdogs in South Africa. It also works with the regional clubs in an effort to further the spread of interest in sheepdogs as useful working resources in the life of the stock farmer and to encourage handlers to participate in competition. Competition is seen as a way to maintain the standard of breeding and training of working sheepdogs.

==History==
The South African Sheepdog Association was established in 1961 when a group of farmers in the [[Karoo]] came together to discuss the future of the [[herding dog|sheepdog]] in South Africa. The inaugural meeting, with 13 members present, was held at Union High School in [[Graaff Reinet]] and Mr Bun Kingwill was elected as the first president of the association.
During the South African championship of that year, "Tess" of Mr Billy Kingwill became the first South African champion under the watchful eye of the judge, Mr Henry Hartzenberg of Graaff Reinet.
Since the inauguration of SASDA a South African championship has been held each year.
Over time the course has also changed, to upgrade the standard and difficulty to improve the dog's working ability. In the beginning the course was very much like the ones used in Australia but gradually changed to the English version.
The current course with the double lift, which has been implemented in 2001, has been taken over virtually as is from the one used for the international championship in the United Kingdom and in so doing putting South African dogs and handlers on the same foot as their overseas counterparts.
Through the years the South African Sheepdog Association still strives toward its main objective – to introduce farmers and other interested people to sheepdogs as a labour saving force. This is done through demonstrations and courses, as well as competitions, where breeding success is tested and the best breeding material selected according to working ability.
The previous logo appears on the right.

==Structure==
The association is made up of a number of regional clubs, loosely based on the provinces and regions of South Africa, together with a central office responsible for the maintenance of the registration of dogs and breeders.

==Competition==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Champs.jpeg|thumb|Trial Competitors|400px|right]] --&gt;

===Dog of the Year===
Each club typically holds one [[Sheepdog trial|trial]] a year. They normally run for two to three days and are usually arranged in such a way as to give each dog at least two opportunities to compete. Trials that comply with certain standards, including a minimum entry, will be able to advertise as 'Dog of the Year' (DOY) trials. Competitors taking part in these trials will be able to accumulate points towards the DOY competition.

===Nationals===
Once a year a national trial is held. It is generally referred to as 'The Nationals'. Handlers all compete on the same trial field on an equal footing and after a number of rounds the most successful dog is awarded the title of National Champion. At the same event the dog that has accumulated the most points at 'Dog of the Year' trials since the last Nationals competition is awarded the title of South Africa Dog of the Year.

===Categories===
During club competition dogs compete in three different categories: ''juniors'', ''seniors'' and ''top dogs''. Juniors don't do the more challenging tests of skill like shedding and must win a junior trial to qualify for seniors. To qualify for top dogs a dog must win a senior competition and attain a score of at least 90% of the points on offer on the same run. The course for top dogs is more of a test. It includes narrow drive gates and may include a double lift or some other additional test.

===Beginners===
Most club trials include a further category: ''beginners''. Any dog can compete in a beginner competition. To qualify for beginner the ''handler'' must have never competed in any other trial category. This category was introduced to encourage novices to become part of the family of competitors.

==International Links==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:SAReps.jpeg|thumb|Faansie Basson with ''Lad'' and Wallie Ward with ''Steffi''|200px|right]] --&gt;
SASDA have tried to maintain links with similar organisations in other countries. Over the years several experienced handlers from England, Wales, [[Scotland]] and the USA have been invited to come and judge important trials, most often the Nationals. The 2006 Nationals were judged by Dick Roper from England. Most international judges invited to travel to judge trials are also invited to run workshops to encourage the sharing of ideas.

South African dogs are not allowed to compete in Europe without first completing six months of quarantine but South African dogs have competed in the USA. In 2005 Faansie Basson and Wally Ward represented South Africa in the USA. At the [[Meeker, Colorado|Meeker]] Classic Faansie Basson finished 8th in the final with ''Lad''.

Handlers have brought dogs from Europe to compete in South Africa in the past. To do this, before they travel to South Africa, they need to arrange to sell the dogs they bring to local handlers after the competition so that they can leave them behind when they leave.

Occasionally handlers from neighbouring countries will compete in regional trials although this is more the exception than the rule.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7772">'''Tarof''' or '''Taʿârof''' ({{lang-fa|تعارف}}) is a [[Persian language|Persian]] word which refers to an [[Iran]]ian form of [[civility]] emphasizing both deference and [[Social class|social rank]]. It encompasses a range of social behaviors; one example of taarof could be described as posing false invitations and promising future services or deeds to primarily strangers or distant relatives and expecting them not to take the offer and keep declining it. Taarof more often works in a totally opposite way. For example, an absolutely desired object/person/offer may seemingly be refused while deep inside is demanded and wished. For instance, young Persian ladies may never express their passion to a potential lover based on shyness and social norms; while, they expect the person of interest remain consistent in expressing love and posing. This also applies to objects, specially food, which are offered to individuals as a favor or even a donation, and Taarof dictates individuals to refuse the favors/donations no matter how badly are needed. The refusing individual expects the object (or the favor) to be left for his/her benefit instead of directly receiving it.  However, the closer two people get in a relationship, the less taarof appears in their behavior towards one another.

The prevalence of taarof often gives rise to distinctly Iranian styles of negotiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = In the Persian world of 'ta'arof,' they make offers that will be refused|url = http://www.latimes.com/local/great-reads/la-me-c1-tarof-20150706-story.html|website = LA Times|accessdate = 2015-11-30|date = 2015-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://1stquest.com/blog/5-persian-customs-to-know-before-visiting-iran/|title=5 Persian Customs to Know Before Visiting Iran {{!}} 1stQuest Blog|date=2018-05-16|work=1stQuest Blog|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a worker negotiating a salary might begin with a [[eulogy]] of the employer, followed by a lengthy bargaining session consisting entirely of indirect, polite language – both parties are expected to understand the ''implied'' topic of discussion. Likewise, a shopkeeper may initially refuse to [[Sales quote|quote]] a price for an item, ''suggesting'' that it is worthless ("ghaabel nadaareh"). Taarof obliges the customer to insist on paying, possibly several times (three times), before a shopkeeper finally quotes a price and real negotiation can begin.

Taarof also governs the rules of hospitality: a host is obliged to offer anything a guest might want, and a guest is equally obliged to refuse it. This ritual may repeat itself several times (three times) before the host and guest finally determine whether the host's offer and the guest's refusal are [[Reality|real]] or simply polite. 

Taarof plays a large role in the etiquette of food. If you go to any meal, are invited to any house for food, then you will be expected to eat seconds and thirds. You must eat to please the host but at the same time taarof demands that you can’t just go ahead and dig into the food once you are done with your first round. Good manners dictates that you have to pretend you are full, the food was excellent and that it would be impossible to fit anything else in. Your host will then demand you do not do tarof (“ta’rof nakon”) – you say 'no' 2 or 3 times and then you pretend you have caved into their insistence and pile on the food. If you do it any other way, you can come across as either starving or simply a bit uncouth.&lt;ref&gt; [https://commisceo-global.com/blog/ta-rof-understanding-iranian-culture  Ta'rof - Understanding Iranian Culture ]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to ask someone not to taarof ("taarof nakonid"), but that raises new difficulties, since the request itself might be a devious type of taarof.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Persian art of declining what you really want and offering what you'll never give could play a role in US-Iran nuclear talks|url = http://www.pri.org/stories/2014-11-05/persian-art-declining-what-you-really-want-and-offering-what-youll-never-give|website = Public Radio International (PRI)|accessdate = 2015-11-30|language = en-US|date = 2014-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
At times, taarof can lead to one performing a task that one does not want to perform. For instance, if one friend offers a ride to another friend only because they are being polite, they may become stuck in the situation if the friend agrees to get the ride. Of course if one was going by the rules of taarof, one would refuse the offer many times before accepting.

It is a way of denying one's will to please your counterpart, although sometimes the will is only denied because of the custom and not just to please the counterpart. But there are situations where taarof persist upon a request to make the counterpart genuinely satisfied. Taarof may cause misunderstandings between both parties and can be a source for awkward situations in a social setting.

Some political theorists have argued that during the period of [[serfdom]], taarof regulated [[diplomacy|diplomatic discourse]] at princely courts. It involved a sharp curbing of one's comportment, speech, and action to make people, [[honor|honour]], and prestige calculable as instruments for political advancement.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

According to D. M. Rejali, for the [[feudal]] elite the ornamentation of speech symbolises [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]]. With the advent of [[capitalism]] and its [[scientific]] [[paradigm]], [[communication]] became more precise and the formality of taarof a hindrance in the pursuit for rapid [[capital accumulation]].&lt;ref&gt;D M Rejali, "Torture &amp; Modernity: Self, Society, and the State in Modern Iran". An exception would be the [[Japanese Tea Ceremony]], which seems to have adapted well to modern requirements (see MT issue no 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the West==
The closest one can come to taarof in the [[Western culture]] is the question of "Who's paying the restaurant bill?" This is an awkward situation where everybody in the company is reaching for their wallets and it's usually resolved by social status: the one with the highest income, the most legitimate reason, or most power pays. But still, everyone insists on paying. In Southern Italy a custom similar to taarof exists (''[[wikt:complimento#Noun|fare i complimenti]]''), and is part of table manners.

For an extensive treatment of tarof vocabulary and language strategies see Beeman. William O., ''Language, Status and Power in Iran&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beeman|first1=William O.|title=Language, Status and Power in Iran|date=1986|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, IN|isbn=978-0-253-33139-7|url=http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/product_info.php?products_id=19702}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

A '''teenybopper''' is a young [[teenager]] who follows adolescent [[Fads and trends|trends]] in music, fashion and culture.  The term may have been coined by [[marketing]] professionals and [[Psychology | psychologists]], later becoming a [[subculture]] of its own.{{Sfn | Gelder | 2005 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=USl1G-903EwC&amp;pg=PA84  84]}}{{Sfn | Brake | 1980 | p = 143}}  The term was introduced in the 1950s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/magazine/30FOB-onlanguage-t.html | title=Cool | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=2010-05-28 | accessdate=2011-05-20 | last = Zimmer | first = Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to teenagers who mainly listened to [[pop music]] and/or [[rock and roll]] and not much else. ''Teenybopper'' became widely used again in the late 1960s and early 1970s, following an increase in the marketing of pop music, teen idols and fashions aimed specifically at younger girls, generally 10–15 years old.{{Sfn | Hall | Jefferson | 1993 | p = 220}}{{Sfn | Brake | 1980 | p = 143}}

==Subcultural aspects==
{{Essay-like|section|date=December 2013}}
The subculture is exclusive to young girls.{{Sfn | Brake | 1980 | p = 143}}{{Sfn | Hall | Jefferson | 1993 | pp = 219–21}}  As a subculture, it is a "retreat and preparation", allowing girls to relate to their peers and "practice in the secrecy of girl culture the rituals of courtship away from the eye of male ridicule",{{Sfn | Brake | 1980 | p = 143}}{{Sfn | Hall | Jefferson | 1993 | pp = 219–21}} also having no risks of  standing out or personal humiliation, and serving as a retreat to avoid being labeled sexually.{{Sfn | Hall | Jefferson | 1993 | pp = 219–21}}  It also allows young girls to participate in semi-masturbatory rituals, since they don't have  access to the masturbatory rituals common among boys.{{Sfn | Hall | Jefferson | 1993 | pp = 219–21}}{{Clarify | date = August 2013 | reason = which would be these rituals?}}  While the subculture allows them to have a space of their own, the subculture magazines offer an idealized relation with the teen idols, always implying a subordination of the female to the male, anticipating that the subordination will keep being present in their future relationships, and presenting an idealized form of marriage.{{Sfn | Hall | Jefferson | 1993 | pp = 219–21}}

The [[Fan fiction|narrative fantasies]] elaborated around teenyboppers serve as distractions from boring, unrewarding, or demanding aspects of life, such as school or work, and as a defensive means against the authoritarian structures at school.{{Sfn | Gelder | 2005 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=USl1G-903EwC&amp;pg=PA84  84]}}{{Sfn | Hall | Jefferson | 1993 | pp = 219–21}}  When shared with other teenyboppers, it allows for defensive solidarity.{{Sfn | Hall | Jefferson | 1993 | pp = 219–21}}  It allows its members to define themselves apart from younger and older girls.{{Sfn | Gelder | 2005 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=USl1G-903EwC&amp;pg=PA84  84]}}  Their groups, like all girl groups, will rarely go above four, unlike boys, who prefer bigger numbers.{{Sfn | Hall | Jefferson | 1993 | pp = 219–21}}

It has a commercial origin and is "an almost packaged cultural commodity", emerging from the pop business and relying on commercial magazines and TV.{{Sfn | Gelder | 2005 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=USl1G-903EwC&amp;pg=PA84  84]}}  As a result, it has fewer creative elements than other subcultures.{{Sfn | Gelder | 2005 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=USl1G-903EwC&amp;pg=PA84  84]}}

Membership has very few restrictions, does not require elaborate spending, and requires much less competence and money than certain school activities.{{Sfn | Gelder | 2005 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=USl1G-903EwC&amp;pg=PA84  84]}}{{Sfn | Hall | Jefferson | 1993 | pp = 219–21}}  Because its members don't have as much freedom as their male counterparts, the subculture is suited to being followed at school or home,{{Sfn | Gelder | 2005 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=USl1G-903EwC&amp;pg=PA84  84]}}{{Sfn | Hall | Jefferson | 1993 | pp = 219–21}} and they can hold a party with just a bedroom, a music player and  permission to invite friends.{{Sfn | Hall | Jefferson | 1993 | pp = 219–21}}

==Musical preferences==
In the 1960s, a new type of music appeared, different from the [[Tin Pan Alley]] music school, but moulded by it.{{Sfn | Elicker | 1997 | pp = 28–29}}  It was no longer written by the old established songwriters of Tin Pan Alley, but by young people.{{Sfn | Elicker | 1997 | pp = 28–29}}  They helped to establish the new [[teen idol]]s and wrote the so-called "teeny bopper songs", which "blend [[soft rock]] with [[pop ballad]], is not explicitly physical and only hints at sexual interaction.{{Sfn | Elicker | 1997 | pp = 28–29}}

The difference that the 70s' "Teeny Bopper syndrome" had with prior idol phenomena was that these new teen idols were directed at even younger girls, down to 15 years old, who were too young to have heard [[The Beatles]] and were not attracted to the new [[hard rock]] music of the time that their elder siblings listened to.{{Sfn | Hall | Jefferson | 1993 | p = 220}}  This new market has a quick turnover potential and it boosted the benefits of many broadcasting companies.{{Sfn | Hall | Jefferson | 1993 | p = 220}}

The teenybopper idol image is that of the young boy next door, with its key elements being self-pity, vulnerability and need.{{Sfn | Elicker | 1997 | pp = 28–29}}  Their music is consumed by young girls, who collect posters and [[Pin-up girl |pin up]]s.{{Sfn | Hall | Jefferson | 1993 | p = 220}}{{Sfn | Elicker | 1997 | pp = 28–29}}

'''''The Time Machine''''' is a [[science fiction]] novella by [[H. G. Wells]], published in 1895 and written as a [[Frame story|frame narrative]]. The work is generally credited with the popularization of the concept of [[time travel]] by using a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposely and selectively forwards or backwards in time. The term "time machine", coined by Wells, is now almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pilkington |first1=Ace G. |title=Science Fiction and Futurism: Their Terms and Ideas |date=2017 |publisher=McFarland |page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Time Machine'' has been adapted into three [[feature film]]s of the same name, as well as two [[television]] versions, and a large number of [[comic book]] adaptations. It has also indirectly inspired many more works of [[fiction]] in many media productions.

==History==
Wells had considered the notion of time travel before, in a short story titled "[[The Chronic Argonauts]]" (1888). This work, published in his college newspaper, was the foundation for ''The Time Machine''.

Wells frequently stated that he had thought of using some of this material in a series of articles in the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'' until the publisher asked him if he could instead write a [[serial novel]] on the same theme. Wells readily agreed and was paid [[Pound sterling|£]]100 (equal to about £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|100|1895|r=-3}}}} today) on its publication by [[Heinemann (book publisher)|Heinemann]] in 1895, which first published the story in serial form in the January to May numbers of ''The New Review'' (newly under the nominal editorship of [[W. E. Henley]]).&lt;ref name="jrhamm04"/&gt; [[Henry Holt and Company]] published the first book edition (possibly prepared from a different manuscript)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.ucr.edu/news_item.html?action=page&amp;id=2256 |department=UCR Newsroom |title=Rare edition of "The Time Machine" acquired |publisher=University of California, Riverside |date=2010-02-09 |access-date=2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 7&amp;nbsp;May 1895; Heinemann published an English edition on 29&amp;nbsp;May.&lt;ref name="jrhamm04"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hammond |first1=John R. |title=H. G. Wells's The Time Machine: A Reference Guide |date=2004 |publisher=Praeger |location=Westport, CT |isbn=0313330077}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two editions are different textually and are commonly referred to as the "Holt text" and "Heinemann text", respectively. Nearly all modern reprints reproduce the Heinemann text.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The story reflects Wells's own [[socialist]] political views, his view on life and abundance, and the contemporary angst about [[industrial relations]]. It is also influenced by [[Ray Lankester]]'s theories about social degeneration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mikejay.net/articles/man-of-the-year-million/ |title=Man Of The Year Million |publisher=Mikejay.net |accessdate=2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shares many elements with [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]]'s novel ''[[Vril|Vril, the Power of the Coming Race]]'' (1871).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w3-xlc8edbEC&amp;pg=PR46&amp;lpg=PR46&amp;dq=%22references+to+the+Sphinx,+the+buildings,+the+underground+machines%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_VWqsE0mmR&amp;sig=gR-gJJXjMXDO91yZ-LE2XAkp2fk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=u78fUZiiMofAhAfdjoCIBw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22references%20to%20the%20Sphinx%2C%20the%20buildings%2C%20the%20underground%20machines%22&amp;f=false |title=The Coming Race |authors=Edward Bulwer-Lytton, David Seed |via=Google Books |access-date=2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other science fiction works of the period, including [[Edward Bellamy]]'s novel ''[[Looking Backward|Looking Backward: 2000-1887]]'' (1888) and the later film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927),  dealt with similar themes.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Based on Wells' personal experiences and childhood, the working class literally spent a lot of their time underground. His own family would spend most of their time in a dark basement kitchen when not being occupied in their father's shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/kent/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_9373000/9373313.stm |title=HG Wells' letter goes on display in Sevenoaks |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, his own mother would work as a housekeeper in a house with underground tunnels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/03/movies/film-wells-s-future-is-forever-recurring.html |department=Film |title=Wells's Future is Forever Recurring |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the staff and servants lived in underground quarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.no/books?id=mR3_3vVoI1sC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=%22rigid+hierarchical+structure+of+staff+and+servants,+and+the+sharp+contrast+between+life+above+and+below+stairs%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WOp7X2i9qA&amp;sig=KP7hCx82IO7IPbJAMFDo2CBf9A4&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjbrJS52J_cAhUlAZoKHalnARsQ6AEwAHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22rigid%20hierarchical%20structure%20of%20staff%20and%20servants%2C%20and%20the%20sharp%20contrast%20between%20life%20above%20and%20below%20stairs%22&amp;f=false |title=H.

This work is an early example of the [[Dying Earth (subgenre)|Dying Earth subgenre]]. The portion of the novella that sees the Time Traveller in a distant future where the sun is huge and red also places ''The Time Machine'' within the realm of [[eschatology]], i.e. the study of the end times, the end of the world, and the ultimate destiny of humankind.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

--&gt;
[[File:Two complete science adventure books 1951win n4.jpg|thumb|right|''The Time Machine'' was reprinted in ''[[Two Complete Science-Adventure Books]]'' in 1951]]
The book's [[protagonist]] is a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] English [[scientist]] and gentleman [[inventor]] living in [[Richmond, Surrey|Richmond]], [[Surrey]], and identified by a narrator simply as the ''Time Traveller''. The narrator recounts the Traveller's lecture to his weekly dinner guests that time is simply a fourth [[dimension]] and demonstrates a tabletop model machine for travelling through the fourth dimension. He reveals that he has built a machine capable of carrying a person through time, and returns at dinner the following week to recount a remarkable tale, becoming the new narrator.

In the [[frame story|new narrative]], the Time Traveller tests his device. At first he thinks nothing has happened but soon finds out he went five hours into the future. He continues forward and sees his house disappear and turn into a lush garden. The Time Traveller stops in [[Anno Domini|A.D.]] 802,701, where he meets the [[Eloi]], a society of small, elegant, childlike adults. They live in small communities within large and futuristic yet slowly deteriorating buildings, and having a [[plant-based diet|fruit-based diet]]. His efforts to communicate with them are hampered by their lack of curiosity or discipline.  They appear happy and carefree, but fear the dark and in particular fear moonless nights.  Observing them, he finds that they give no response to mysterious nocturnal disappearances. (Perhaps they had become traumatized and would not discuss it.) He speculates that they are a peaceful society.

Returning to the site where he arrived, the Time Traveller is shocked to find his time machine missing and eventually concludes that it has been dragged by some unknown party into a nearby structure with heavy doors, locked from the inside, which resembles a Sphinx. Luckily, he had removed the machine's levers before leaving it (the time machine being unable to travel through time without them). Later in the dark, he is approached menacingly by the [[Morlock]]s, [[ape]]-like [[caveman|troglodytes]] who live in darkness underground and surface only at night. Exploring one of many "wells" that lead to the Morlocks' dwellings, he discovers the machinery and industry that makes the above-ground paradise of the Eloi possible. He alters his theory, speculating that the human race has evolved into two species: the leisured classes have become the ineffectual Eloi, and the downtrodden [[working class]]es have become the brutal light-fearing Morlocks.

Deducing that the Morlocks have taken his time machine, he explores the Morlock tunnels, learning that due to a lack of any other means of sustenance, they feed on the Eloi.  His revised analysis is that their relationship is not one of lords and servants but of livestock and ranchers. The Time Traveller theorizes that intelligence is the result of and response to danger; with no real challenges facing the Eloi, they have lost the spirit, intelligence, and physical fitness of humanity at its peak.

Meanwhile, he saves an Eloi named [[Weena (The Time Machine)|Weena]] from drowning as none of the other Eloi take any notice of her plight, and they develop an innocently affectionate relationship over the course of several days. He takes Weena with him on an expedition to a distant structure that turns out to be the remains of a museum, where he finds a fresh supply of matches and fashions a crude weapon against Morlocks, whom he must fight to get back his machine. He plans to take Weena back to his own time. Because the long and tiring journey back to Weena's home is too much for them, they stop in the forest for the night. They are then overcome by Morlocks in the night, whereby Weena faints. The Traveller escapes when a small fire he had left behind them to distract the Morlocks catches up to them as a forest fire; Weena and the pursuing Morlocks are lost in the fire and the Time Traveller is devastated over his loss.

The Morlocks open the Sphinx and use the time machine as bait to capture the Traveller, not understanding that he will use it to escape. He reattaches the levers before he travels further ahead to roughly 30&amp;nbsp;million years from his own time. There he sees some of the last living things on a dying Earth: Menacing reddish crab-like creatures slowly wandering the blood-red beaches chasing enormous [[butterflies]], in a world covered in simple lichenous vegetation. He continues to make jumps forward through time, seeing Earth's rotation gradually cease and the sun grow larger, redder, and dimmer, and the world falling silent and freezing as the last degenerate living things die out.

Overwhelmed, he goes back to the machine and returns to his own time, arriving at the laboratory just three hours after he originally left. He arrives late to his own dinner party, whereupon, after eating, the Time Traveller relates his adventures to his disbelieving visitors, producing as evidence two strange white flowers Weena had put in his pocket. 

The original narrator then takes over and relates that he returned to the Time Traveller's house the next day, finding him preparing for another journey and promising to return in a short time. However, the narrator reveals that he has waited three years before writing and stating the Time Traveller has not returned from his journey.

==Deleted text==
A section from the eleventh chapter of the serial published in ''New Review'' (May 1895) was deleted from the book. It was drafted at the suggestion of Wells's editor, [[William Ernest Henley]], who wanted Wells to "oblige your editor" by lengthening the text with, among other things, an illustration of "the ultimate degeneracy" of humanity. "There was a slight struggle," Wells later recalled, "between the writer and W. E. Henley who wanted, he said, to put a little 'writing' into the tale. But the writer was in reaction from that sort of thing, the Henley interpolations were cut out again, and he had his own way with his text."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hammond |first1=John R. |title=H.

The deleted text recounts an incident immediately after the Traveller's escape from the Morlocks.  He finds himself in the distant future of an unrecognisable Earth, populated with furry, hopping herbivores resembling [[kangaroo]]s.  He stuns or kills one with a rock, and upon closer examination realises they are probably the descendants of humans / Eloi / Morlocks. A gigantic, centipede-like [[arthropod]] approaches and the Traveller flees into the next day, finding that the creature has apparently eaten the tiny humanoid.

==Scholarship==
Significant scholarly commentary on ''The Time Machine'' began from the early 1960s, initially contained in various broad studies of Wells's early novels (such as Bernard Bergonzi's ''The Early H.G. Wells: A Study of the Scientific Romances'') and studies of utopias/dystopias in science fiction (such as Mark R. Hillegas's ''The Future as Nightmare: H.G. Wells and the Anti-Utopians''). Much critical and textual work was done in the 1970s, including the tracing of the very complex publication history of the text, its drafts, and unpublished fragments.

===Academic publications===
A further resurgence in scholarship came around the time of the novella's centenary in 1995, and a major outcome of this was the 1995 conference and substantial anthology of academic papers, which was collected in print as ''H.G. Wells’s Perennial Time Machine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |conference=H.G. Wells’s ''Time Machine'' centenary conference, 1995 |title=H.G. Wells’s Perennial Time Machine: Selected Essays from the Centenary Conference, "The Time Machine: Past, Present, and Future" |publisher=University of Georgia Press |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This publication then allowed the development of a guide-book for academic study at Master's and Ph.D. level: ''H.G. Wells's The Time Machine: A Reference Guide''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=H.G. Wells's The Time Machine: A reference guide |publisher=Praeger |year=2004 |last1=Hammond |first1=John R. |location=Westport, CT |isbn=0313330077}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The scholarly journal ''The Wellsian'' has published around twenty articles on ''The Time Machine'', and a U.S. academic journal ''The Undying Fire'', devoted to H.G. Wells studies, has published three articles since its inception in 2002. Richard Wasson explores the use in ''The Time Machine'' of [[myth]] and [[Mythologies (book)#exnomination|ex-nomination of class]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wasson |first=Richard |title=Myth and the ex-nomination of class in ''The Time Machine'' |journal=[[The Minnesota Review]] |volume=15 |pages=112–122 |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |date=Fall 1980 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/427124 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subtext of the names ''Eloi'' and ''Morlock''===
The name ''[[Eloi]]'' is the Hebrew plural for Elohim, or lesser gods, in the [[Old Testament]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Time Machine: An invention – A critical text of the 1895 London first edition |last=Stover |first=Leon |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company |year=1996 |isbn=0786401249 |location=Jefferson, NC |pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wells' source for the name ''morlock'' is less clear. It may refer to the [[Ancient Canaanite religion|Canaanite]] god [[Moloch]] associated with child sacrifice. The name [[Morlock]] may be a play on ''mollocks'' – what miners might call themselves – or a Scots word for rubbish,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; or a reference to the [[Morlacchi]] community in Dalmatia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=u5tUbUyXtToC&amp;dq |article=The rise and fall of 'Morlacchismo': South Slavic identity in the mountains of Dalmatia |last=Wolff |first=Larry |title=Yugoslavia and Its Historians: Understanding the Balkan Wars of the 1990s |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=2003 |editor-last=Naimark |editor-first=Norman |pages=49 |editor-last2=Case |editor-first2=Holly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbols===
''The Time Machine'' can be read as a symbolic novel. The time machine itself can be viewed as a symbol, and there are several symbols in the narrative, including the Sphinx, flowers, and fire.

* The statue of the Sphinx is the place where the Morlocks hide the time machine and references the Sphinx in the story of [[Oedipus]] who gives a riddle that he must first solve before he can pass.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Science Fiction Before 1900: Imagination Discovers Technology |last=Alkon |first=Paul K. |publisher=Twayne Publishers |year=1994 |isbn=0805709525 |location=New York |pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sphinx appeared on the cover of the first London edition as requested by Wells and would have been familiar to his readers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* The white flowers can symbolize Weena's devotion and innocence and contrast with the machinery of the time machine.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They are the only proof that the Time Traveller's story is true.

* Fire symbolizes civilization: the Time Traveller uses it to ward off the Morlocks, but it escapes his control and turns into a forest fire.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Adaptations==
=== Radio and audio ===
====''Escape'' radio broadcasts====
The CBS radio anthology ''[[Escape (radio program)|Escape]]'' adapted ''The Time Machine'' twice, in 1948 starring [[Jeff Corey]], and again in 1950 starring [[Lawrence Dobkin]] as the traveller. In both episodes, a script adapted by Irving Ravetch was used. The Time Traveller was named '''Dudley''' and was accompanied by his skeptical friend Fowler as they traveled to the year 100,080.

====1994 Alien Voices audio drama====
In 1994, an audio drama was released on cassette and CD by Alien Voices, starring [[Leonard Nimoy]] as the Time Traveller (named '''John''' in this adaptation) and [[John de Lancie]] as David Filby. John de Lancie's children, Owen de Lancie and [[Keegan de Lancie]], played the parts of the Eloi. The drama is approximately two hours long and is more faithful to the story than several of the film adaptations. Some changes are made to reflect modern language and knowledge of science.

==== 7th Voyage ====
In 2000, Alan Young read ''The Time Machine'' for 7th&amp;nbsp;Voyage Productions, Inc., in 2016 to celebrate the 120th Anniversary of H.G. Wells' novella.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lucas |first1=Clyde |title=The Time Machine Alan Young |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3630388/ |date=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2009 BBC Radio 3 broadcast====
[[Robert Glenister]] starred as the Time Traveller, with [[William Gaunt]] as [[H. G. Wells]] in a new 100-minute radio dramatisation by Philip Osment, directed by [[Jeremy Mortimer]] as part of a BBC Radio Science Fiction season. This was the first adaptation of the novella for British radio. It was first broadcast on 22&amp;nbsp;February 2009 on [[BBC Radio 3]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00hr4hq |department=BBC Radio 3 – Drama on 3 |title=The Time Machine |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=2009-08-30 |accessdate=2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later published as a 2-CD BBC audio book.

The other cast members were:
*Donnla Hughes as Martha
*Gunnar Cauthery as Young H. G. Wells
*[[Stephen Critchlow]] as Filby, friend of the young Wells
*Chris Pavlo as Bennett, friend of the young Wells
*Manjeet Mann as Mrs. Watchett, the Traveller's housemaid
*Jill Crado as Weena, one of the Eloi and the Traveller's partner
*[[Robert Lonsdale]], Inam Mirza, and [[Dan Starkey (actor)|Dan Starkey]] as other characters

The adaptation retained the nameless status of the Time Traveller and set it as a true story told to the young Wells by the time traveller, which Wells then re-tells as an older man to the American journalist, Martha, whilst firewatching on the roof of [[Broadcasting House]] during [[the Blitz]]. It also retained the deleted ending from the novella as a recorded message sent back to Wells from the future by the traveller using a prototype of his machine, with the traveller escaping the anthropoid creatures to 30&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;AD at the end of the universe before disappearing or dying there.

====Big Finish====
On 5&amp;nbsp;September 2017, [[Big Finish Productions]] released an adaptation of ''The Time Machine''. This adaptation was written by [[Marc Platt (writer)|Marc Platt]], and starred [[Ben Miles]] as the Time Traveller.

Platt explained in an interview that adapting The Time Machine to audio was not much different to writing Doctor Who, and that he can see where some of the roots of early Doctor Who came from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bigfinish.com/news/v/out-now-hg-wells-the-time-machine |title=Out Now: H.G. Wells' ''The Time Machine''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film adaptations ===

==== 1949 BBC teleplay ====
The first visual adaptation of the book was a live teleplay broadcast from [[Alexandra Palace]] on 25 January 1949 by the [[BBC]], which starred [[Russell Napier]] as the Time Traveller and Mary Donn as Weena. No recording of this live broadcast was made; the only record of the production is the script and a few black and white still photographs. A reading of the script, however, suggests that this teleplay remained fairly faithful to the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cornell |first1=Paul |last2=Day |first2=Martin |last3=Topping |first3=Keith |title=The Classic British Telefantasy Guide |page=7 |date=30 July 2015 |publisher=Orion Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-575-13352-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1960 film====
{{main|The Time Machine (1960 film)}}

In 1960, the novella was made into an American [[science fiction film]], also known promotionally as ''H.G. Wells' The Time Machine''. The film starred [[Rod Taylor]], [[Alan Young]], and [[Yvette Mimieux]]. The film was produced and directed by [[George Pal]], who also filmed a 1953 version of Wells' ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|The War of the Worlds]]''.  The film won an Academy Award for [[time-lapse]] photographic effects showing the world changing rapidly.

In 1993, Rod Taylor hosted ''[[Time Machine: The Journey Back]]'' reuniting him with Alan Young and Whit Bissell, featuring the only sequel to Mr. Pal's classic film, written by the original screenwriter, David Duncan. In the special were [[Academy Award]]-winners special effect artists [[Wah Chang]] and [[Gene Warren]].

====1978 television film====
{{main|The Time Machine (1978 film)}}
[[Sunn Classic Pictures]] produced a television film version of ''The Time Machine'' as a part of their "[[Classics Illustrated]]" series in 1978. It was a modernization of the Wells' story, making the Time Traveller a 1970s scientist working for a fictional US [[defence contractor]], "the Mega Corporation". Dr. '''Neil Perry''' ([[John Beck (actor)|John Beck]]), the Time Traveller, is described as one of Mega's most reliable contributors by his senior co-worker Branly (Whit Bissell, an alumnus of the 1960 adaptation).  Perry's skill is demonstrated by his rapid reprogramming of an off-course missile, averting a disaster that could destroy [[Los Angeles]]. His reputation secures a grant of $20 million for his time machine project. Although nearing completion, the corporation wants Perry to put the project on hold so that he can head a military weapon development project.  Perry accelerates work on the time machine, permitting him to test it before being forced to work on the new project.

====2002 film====
&lt;!-- This section about a U.S.-produced film whose setting was moved to the U.S. uses a different English variant. --&gt;
{{main|The Time Machine (2002 film)}}
The 1960 film was [[The Time Machine (2002 film)|remade]] in 2002, starring [[Guy Pearce]] as the Time Traveller, a mechanical engineering professor named Alexander Hartdegen, [[Mark Addy]] as his colleague David Filby, [[Sienna Guillory]] as Alex's ill-fated fiancée Emma, [[Phyllida Law]] as Mrs. Watchit, and [[Jeremy Irons]] as the Uber-Morlock. Playing a quick cameo as a shopkeeper was [[Alan Young]], who featured in the 1960 film. (H.G. Wells himself can also be said to have a "cameo" appearance, in the form of a photograph on the wall of Alex's home, near the front door.)

The film was directed by Wells's great-grandson [[Simon Wells]], with an even more revised plot that incorporated the ideas of [[paradox]]es and changing the past. The place is changed from Richmond, Surrey, to downtown [[New York City]], where the Time Traveller moves forward in time to find answers to his questions on 'Practical Application of Time Travel;' first in 2030 New York, to witness an orbital lunar catastrophe in 2037, before moving on to 802,701 for the main plot. He later briefly finds himself in 635,427,810 with toxic clouds and a world laid waste (presumably by the Morlocks) with devastation and Morlock artifacts stretching out to the horizon.

It was met with generally negative  reviews and earned $56 million before VHS/DVD sales. The Time Machine used a design that was very reminiscent of the one in the Pal film but was much larger and employed polished turned brass construction, along with rotating glass reminiscent of the [[Fresnel lens]]es common to lighthouses. (In Wells's original book, the Time Traveller mentioned his 'scientific papers on optics'). Hartdegen becomes involved with a female Eloi named Mara, played by [[Samantha Mumba]], who essentially takes the place of Weena, from the earlier versions of the story. &lt;!-- Mara may be either the 2002 film counterpart to Weena or a distinct character. We'd like to see reliable sources one way or the other. --&gt; In this film, the Eloi have, as a tradition, preserved a "stone language" that is identical to English. The Morlocks are much more barbaric and agile, and the Time Traveller has a direct impact on the plot.

=== Derivative work ===
====''Time After Time'' (1979 film)====
{{main|Time After Time (1979 film)}}
In ''Time After Time'', H.G. Wells invents a time machine and shows it to some friends in a manner similar to the first part of the novella. He does not know that one of his friends is Jack The Ripper. The Ripper, fleeing police, escapes to the future (1979), but without a key which prevents the machine from remaining in the future. When it does return home, Wells follows him in order to protect the future (which he imagines to be a utopia) from the Ripper. In turn, the film inspired a 2017 [[Time After Time (TV series)|TV series]] of the same name.

===Comics===
''Classics Illustrated'' was the first to adapt ''The Time Machine'' into a [[comic book]] format, issuing an American edition in July 1956.

The Classics Illustrated version was published in French by ''Classiques Illustres'' in Dec 1957, and ''Classics Illustrated'' Strato Publications (Australian) in 1957, and ''Kuvitettuja Klassikkoja'' (a Finnish edition) in November 1957.  There were also ''Classics Illustrated'' Greek editions in 1976, Swedish in 1987, German in 1992 and 2001, and a Canadian reprint of the English edition in 2008.

In 1976, [[Marvel Comics]] published a new version of ''The Time Machine'', as #2 in their ''[[Marvel Classics Comics]]'' series, with art by [[Alex Niño]]. (This adaptation was originally published in 1973 by [[Pendulum Press]] as part of their ''Pendulum Now Age Classics'' series; it was colorized and reprinted by Marvel in 1976.) From April 1990, [[Eternity Comics]] published a three-issue miniseries adaptation of ''The Time Machine'', written by [[Bill Spangler]] and illustrated by [[John Ross (artist)|John Ross]] — this was collected as a trade paperback [[graphic novel]] in 1991.

==Sequels by other authors==
{{uncited section|date=September 2018}}

Wells's novella has become one of the cornerstones of science-fiction literature. As a result, it has spawned many offspring. Works expanding on{{cn|date=September 2018}}&lt;!--currently this reads as original research, we need evidence that critics have stated these are expansions on ''The Time Machine''--&gt; Wells's story include:

* ''La Belle Valence'' by Théo Varlet and André Blandin (1923) in which a squadron of [[World War I]] soldiers find the Time Machine and are transported back to the Spanish town of [[Valencia]] in [[Valencia#Golden Age of Valencia|the 14th century]]. Translated by [[Brian Stableford]] as ''Timeslip Troopers'' (2012).

* ''Die Rückkehr der Zeitmaschine'' (1946) by [[Egon Friedell]] was the first direct sequel. It dwells heavily on the technical details of the machine and the time-paradoxes it might cause when the time machine was used to visit the past. This culminates in Westminster Abbey being used as a butcher shop of human beings by the Morlocks in the 20th century, and a total disruption and collapse of the time stream. There the hero and Merlin must find — and destroy — the Time Machine, to restore the time stream and history.  The 24,000-word German original was translated into English by Eddy C. Bertin in the 1940s and eventually published in paperback as ''The Return of the Time Machine'' (1972, DAW).
*''The Hertford Manuscript'' by [[John Middleton Murry, Jr.|Richard Cowper]], first published in 1976. It features a "manuscript", which reports the Time Traveller's activities after the end of the original story. According to this manuscript, the Time Traveller disappeared, because his Time Machine had been damaged by the Morlocks without him knowing it. He only found out when it stopped operating during his next attempted time travel. He found himself on 27&amp;nbsp;August 1665, in [[London]] during the outbreak of the [[Great Plague of London]]. The rest of the novel is devoted to his efforts to repair the Time Machine and leave this time period before getting infected with the disease. He also has an encounter with [[Robert Hooke]]. He eventually dies of the disease on 20 September 1665. The story gives a list of subsequent owners of the manuscript until 1976. It also gives the name of the Time Traveller as Robert James Pensley, born to James and Martha Pensley in 1850 and disappearing without trace on 18&amp;nbsp;June 1894.

* ''[[The Space Machine]]'' by [[Christopher Priest (novelist)|Christopher Priest]], first published in 1976. Because of the movement of planets, stars, and galaxies, for a time machine to stay in one spot on Earth as it travels through time, it must also follow the Earth's trajectory through space. In Priest's book, a travelling salesman damages a Time Machine similar to the original, and arrives on [[Mars]], just before the start of the invasion described in ''[[The War of the Worlds]]''. H.G. Wells appears as a minor character.

* ''[[Morlock Night]]'' by [[K. W. Jeter]], first published in 1979. A [[steampunk]] fantasy novel in which the Morlocks, having studied the Traveller's machine, duplicate it and invade Victorian London.

* ''Time Machine II'' by [[George Pal]] and Joe Morhaim, published in 1981. The Time Traveller, named George, and the pregnant Weena try to return to his time, but instead land in the London Blitz, dying during a bombing raid. Their newborn son is rescued by an American ambulance driver and grows up in the United States under the name Christopher Jones. Sought out by the lookalike son of James Filby, Jones goes to England to collect his inheritance, leading ultimately to George's journals, and the Time Machine's original plans. He builds his own machine with 1970s upgrades and seeks his parents in the future.  Pal also worked on a detailed synopsis for a third sequel, which was partly filmed for a 1980s U.S. TV special on the making of Pal's film version of ''The Time Machine'', using the original actors. This third sequel, the plot of which does not seem to fit with Pal's second, opens with the Time Traveller enjoying a happy life with Weena, in a future world in which the Morlocks have died out. He and his son return to save Filby in [[World War I]].  This act changes the future, causing the nuclear war not to happen.  He and his son are thus cut off from Weena in the far future. The Time Traveller thus has to solve a dilemma — allow his friend to die, and cause the later death of millions, or give up Weena forever.

* ''The Man Who Loved Morlocks'' (1981) and ''The Truth about Weena'' (1998) are two different sequels, the former a novel and the latter a short story, by [[David Lake (writer)|David J. Lake]]. Each of them concerns the Time Traveller's return to the future. In the former, he discovers that he cannot enter any period in time he has already visited, forcing him to travel into the further future, where he finds love with a woman whose race evolved from Morlock stock. In the latter, he is accompanied by Wells and succeeds in rescuing Weena and bringing her back to the 1890s, where her political ideas cause a peaceful revolution.

* ''[[The Time Ships]]'', by [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]], first published in 1995. This sequel was officially authorised by the Wells estate to mark the centenary of the original's publication. In its wide-ranging narrative, the Traveller's desire to return and rescue Weena is thwarted by the fact that he has changed history (by telling his tale to his friends, one of whom published the account). With a Morlock (in the new history, the Morlocks are intelligent and cultured), he travels through the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|multiverse]] as increasingly complicated timelines unravel around him, eventually meeting mankind's far future descendants, whose ambition is to travel back to the birth of the universe, and modify the way the multiverse will unfold. This sequel includes many nods to the prehistory of Wells's story in the names of characters and chapters.

* ''The Steam Man of the Prairie and the Dark Rider Get Down: A Dime Novel'' by [[Joe R. Lansdale]], first published in ''[[The Long Ones]]'' (1999). In this story, the Time Traveller accidentally damages the space-time continuum and is transformed into the vampire-like Dark Rider.

* The 2003 short story "On the Surface" by [[Robert J. Sawyer]] begins with this quote from the Wells original: "I have suspected since that the Morlocks had even partially taken it [the time machine] to pieces while trying in their dim way to grasp its purpose." In the Sawyer story, the Morlocks develop a fleet of time machines and use them to conquer the same far future Wells depicted at the end of the original, by which time, because the sun has grown red and dim and thus no longer blinds them, they can reclaim the surface of the world.

* The Time Traveller and his machine appear in the story ''[[Allan and the Sundered Veil]]'' by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]], which acts as a prequel to ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume One]]''. The Time Traveller shares an adventure with fellow literary icons [[Allan Quatermain]], [[John Carter of Mars|John Carter]], and [[Randolph Carter]].

* David Haden's novelette ''The Time Machine: A Sequel'' (2010) is a direct sequel, picking up where the original finished. The Time Traveller goes back to rescue Weena but finds the Eloi less simple than he first imagined, and time travel far more complicated.

* Simon Baxter's novel ''The British Empire: Psychic Battalions Against the Morlocks'' (2010) imagines a [[steampunk]]/[[cyberpunk]] future in which the [[British Empire]] has remained the dominant world force until the Morlocks arrive from the future.

* [[Hal Colebatch]]'s ''Time-Machine Troopers'' (2011) (Acashic Publishers) is twice the length of the original. In it, the Time Traveller returns to the future world about 18 years after the time he escaped from the Morlocks, taking with him [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]], the real-world founder of the Boy Scout movement. They set out to teach the Eloi self-reliance and self-defence against the Morlocks, but the Morlocks capture them. H.G. Wells and [[Winston Churchill]] are also featured as characters.

*Paul Schullery's ''The Time Traveller's Tale: Chronicle of a Morlock Captivity'' (2012) continues the story in the voice and manner of the original Wells book. After many years' absence, the Time Traveller returns and describes his further adventures. His attempts to mobilize the Eloi in their own defense against the Morlocks failed when he was captured by the Morlocks. Much of the book is occupied with his deeply unsettling discoveries about the Morlock / Eloi symbiosis, his gradual assimilation into Morlock society, and his ultimately successful attempt to discover the true cause of humanity's catastrophic transformation into two such tragic races.

* The ''[[Great Illustrated Classics]]'' in 1992 published an adaptation of Wells' novella that adds an extra destination to the Time Traveller's adventure: Stopping in 2200&amp;nbsp;AD on his way back home, he becomes caught up in a civil war between factions of a [[technocratic]] society that was established to avert ecological catastrophe.
