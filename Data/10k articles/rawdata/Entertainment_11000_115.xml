[[File:Arthur Willard Pryor with his trombone in 1920.jpg|thumb|Pryor with his trombone in 1920]]

'''Arthur Willard Pryor''' (September 22, 1869 &amp;ndash; June 18, 1942) was a [[trombone]] virtuoso, [[bandleader]], and soloist with the [[John Philip Sousa|Sousa Band]]. He was a prolific composer of band music, his best-known composition being "The Whistler and His Dog".&lt;ref name=emporia/&gt; In later life, he became a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] politician from [[New Jersey]], who served on the [[Monmouth County Board of Chosen Freeholders]] during the 1930s.

==Early life and education==
He was born on September 22, 1869 on the second floor of the Lyceum Theater in [[Saint Joseph, Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;While 1870 has been traditionally noted, Arthur is listed as a few months old in the January, 1870 Federal census taken in St. Joseph, Missouri, so was clearly born in 1869.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of Samuel Pryor, bandmaster and founder of the original Pryor band, and his wife. Arthur first took up music at a very young age under the tutelage of his father and was playing the [[Types of trombone#Valve trombone|valve trombone]] by age 11. The story goes that whenever he hit a sour note while practicing, his father planted a resounding crack on his head with a violin bow. The boy developed until he was so skilled that he won a place in the John Philip Sousa's band. He was hailed as a [[child prodigy|prodigy]] after this.

==Musical career==

Pryor went on to direct the [[Stanley Opera Company]] in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Colorado]] until joining the [[John Philip Sousa]] Band in 1892. He played his first solo with the Sousa Band at age 22 during the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]]. During his 12 years with the Sousa Band, Pryor estimated that he played 10,000 solos. From 1895 to 1903, Pryor was assistant conductor of the Sousa Band. During his association with the "March King", Pryor toured throughout the USA and Europe. While in Europe, he entertained King Edward VII of England and Czar Nicholas II of Russia with his trombone solos. Once while in Germany, all the trombonists of the German Army bands were ordered to hear him play. They were so amazed at his playing that they insisted on taking his trombone apart, refusing to believe that it was natural. Finally one German said: "No one can play so well. It is a Yankee trick."{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In 1902 after the death of his father, Pryor ended his association with Sousa and took over the reorganized Pryor band; he led its debut at the [[Majestic Theatre (Broadway)|Majestic Theatre]] in [[New York City]] on November 15, 1903. For 30 years thereafter, Pryor's band was an American institution. He made his first appearance in [[Asbury Park, New Jersey]] at the Shore in 1904, where he continued to play until 1930. The Pryor Band toured until 1909, when he decided to settle down and make Asbury Park the home of the band. Also at this time, he became a staff conductor and arranger for the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] in [[Camden, New Jersey]]. He organized a second band that played at the entertainment complex of [[Coney Island, New York]], for a number of years.

==Post-Conducting Career, Death==

Pryor retired from full-time conducting in 1933. On November 7 of that year, he and [[Henry W. Herbert (politician)|Henry W. Herbert]] were elected to the Monmouth County Board of Chosen Freeholders, defeating Director [[Bryant B. Newcomb]] and his running mate, Arthur Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;''The Matawan Journal'', Nov. 10, 1933&lt;/ref&gt; Pryor and Herbert would each serve one, three-year term in office. In the 1936 election, they were defeated by Republicans [[J. Russell Woolley]] and [[Edgar O. Murphy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Red Bank Register'', Nov. 5, 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

Pryor was married to Maude Russell Pryor.  Their son Roger Pryor (1901 – 1974) also became a bandleader and a film actor.&lt;ref name=emporia/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0699430/ Roger Pryor at IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt; They also had sons Arthur Jr., who became a bandsman and advertising executive, and Samuel Pryor.

The senior Pryor suffered a stroke on June 17, 1942, and died on June 18 at his home in [[West Long Branch, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=HwwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT3&amp;lpg=PT3&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj47LXalq_KAhUENiYKHeC6C1MQ6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false||''Billboard,'' June 27, 1942.&lt;/ref&gt;  Funeral services were conducted June 21, 1942, at the Trinity Episcopal Church, Asbury Park, followed by burial in Glenwood Cemetery, West Long Branch.

==Legacy==

Pryor composed some 300 works, including marches, novelties, tone poems and three light operas, ''Jinga Boo'', ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' and ''On the Eve of Her Wedding Day''.  Among his best-known numbers were "On Jersey Shore", "Queen Titania" and "The Whistler and His Dog". He set to work on an [[opera]] titled ''Peter and Paul'', with a [[libretto]] by [[L. Frank Baum]]; the libretto has been lost. It was intended to star [[Fred Stone]] and [[David C. Montgomery|David Montgomery]] in several roles in several time periods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hungrytigerpress.com/tigertreats/baumonstage.shtml Tiger Treats - L. Frank Baum and His New Plays], Hungry Tiger Press&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

During his career, Pryor wrote some of today's most well-known trombone literature, including an arrangement of the heralded "[[Bluebells of Scotland]]", as well as band novelty works such as "The Whistler and His Dog", with its [[piccolo]] solo, his best-known composition.&lt;ref name=emporia&gt;"Arthur Pryor, Bandsman, Dies" (June 18, 1942) ''The Emporia Daily Gazette'', [[Emporia, Kansas]]&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this literature has been recorded by [[Ian Bousfield]] on his CD ''Pryor Engagement'' (Doyen DOY CD212).

In 1985, thousands of early Pryor scores were discovered by conductor [[Rick Benjamin (conductor)|Rick Benjamin]]. He has played many of Pryor's compositions with his [[Paragon Ragtime Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;"Old movie, live music to pair," ''The Hawk Eye'' (Burlington, Iowa), Feb 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Covent Garden 1762.gif|thumb|right|240px|A theatrical riot at Covent Garden's Royal Theatre in 1762 over a rumored increase in ticket prices. Although drama declined in the Augustan era, it was still popular entertainment.]]

'''''Augustan drama''''' can refer to the [[drama]]s of [[Ancient Rome]] during the reign of [[Augustus|Caesar Augustus]], but it most commonly refers to the [[English drama|plays of Great Britain]] in the early 18th century, a subset of 18th-century [[Augustan literature]]. King [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] referred to himself as "Augustus," and the poets of the era took this reference as apropos, as the [[Latin literature|literature of Rome]] during Augustus moved from historical and didactic poetry to the poetry of highly finished and sophisticated [[Epic poetry|epic]]s and [[satire]].

In [[poetry]], the early 18th century was an age of [[satire]] and public verse, and in prose, it was an age of the developing [[novel]]. In drama, by contrast, it was an age in transition between the highly witty and sexually playful [[Restoration comedy]], the pathetic [[she-tragedy]] of the turn of the 18th century, and any later plots of middle-class anxiety. The Augustan stage retreated from the Restoration's focus on cuckoldry, marriage for fortune, and a life of leisure. Instead, Augustan drama reflected questions the mercantile class had about itself and what it meant to be [[gentry]]: what it meant to be a good merchant, how to achieve wealth with morality, and the proper role of those who serve.

Augustan drama has a reputation as an era of decline. One reason for this is that there were few dominant figures of the Augustan stage. Instead of a single genius, a number of playwrights worked steadily to find subject matter that would appeal to a new audience. In addition to this, playhouses began to dispense with playwrights altogether or to hire playwrights to match assigned subjects, and this made the producer the master of the script. When the public did tire of anonymously authored, low-content plays and a new generation of [[wit]]s made the stage political and aggressive again, the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] ministry stepped in and began official [[censorship]] that put an end to daring and innovative content. This conspired with the public's taste for [[special effects]] to reduce theatrical output and promote the novel.

==The middle-class tragedy==
{{further|Bourgeois tragedy}}
As for prose and poetry, there is no clear beginning to the "Augustan era" in drama, but the end is clearly marked. Augustan-era drama ended definitively in 1737 with the [[Licensing Act 1737|Licensing Act]]. Prior to 1737, the English stage was changing rapidly from [[Restoration comedy]] and [[Restoration drama]] and their noble subjects to the quickly developing [[melodrama]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:R-Steele.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Richard Steele]], collaborator of [[Joseph Addison]]'s and author of ''The Conscious Lovers'']] --&gt;
[[George Lillo]] and [[Richard Steele]] wrote the trend-setting plays of the early Augustan period. Lillo's plays consciously turned from heroes and kings toward shopkeepers and apprentices. They emphasized drama on a household scale rather than a national scale, and the ''[[hamartia]]'' and ''[[agon]]'' in his tragedies are the common flaws of yielding to temptation and the commission of [[Christianity|Christian]] [[sin]]. The plots are resolved with Christian forgiveness and [[repentance]]. Steele's ''The Conscious Lovers'' (1722) hinges upon his young hero avoiding fighting a [[duel]]. These plays set up a new set of values for the stage. Instead of amusing or inspiring the audience, they sought to instruct the audience and ennoble it. Further, the plays were popular precisely because they seemed to reflect the audience's own lives and concerns.

[[Joseph Addison]] also wrote a play entitled ''Cato'' in 1713, but it did not inspire followers. ''Cato'' concerned the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Cato the Younger|statesman]] who opposed [[Julius Caesar]]. The year of its première is important for understanding why the play is unique, for [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] was seriously ill at the time, and both the [[Tory]] ministry of the day and the Whig opposition (already led by [[Robert Walpole]]) were concerned about the succession. Both groups were in contact with Anne's exiled brother [[James Francis Edward Stuart]]. Londoners sensed this anxiety, for Anne had no surviving children; all of the closest successors in the [[House of Stuart|Stuart family]] were [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]. Therefore, the figure of Cato was a transparent symbol of Roman integrity. The Whigs saw in him a Whig refusal to accept an [[Divine Right of Kings|absolute monarch]] from the House of Stuart, while the Tories saw in him a resistance to rule by a triumphant general ([[John Churchill]], the Duke of Marlborough, whose wife Sarah was rumored to control Anne). Further, Cato's claim that Caesar profited by illegal war echoed the Tory accusations against Marlborough. Both sides cheered the play, even though Addison was himself clearly Whig and had meant the play as something near [[propaganda]]. [[John Home]]'s play ''[[Douglas (play)|Douglas]]'' (1756) would have a similar fate to ''Cato'' in the next generation after the [[Licensing Act]].

==The problem of "Spectacle"==
[[Image:Rich-Covent-Garden.jpg|thumb|left|260px|"Rich's Glory": [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]] takes control of Covent Garden Theatre in 1732. The first play he would stage was ''[[The Way of the World]]''.]]
As during the Restoration, economic reality drove the stage during the Augustan period. Under [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] court patronage meant economic success, and therefore the Restoration stage featured plays that would suit the monarch and/or court. The drama that celebrated kings and told the history of Britain's monarchs was fit fare for the crown and courtiers. Charles II was a philanderer, and so Restoration comedy featured a highly sexualized set of plays.  However, after the reign of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]], the court and crown stopped taking a great interest in the playhouse. Theaters had to get their money from the audience of city dwellers, therefore, and consequently plays that reflected city anxieties and celebrated the lives of citizens were the ones to draw crowds. The aristocratic material from the Restoration continued to be mounted, and adaptations of [[Tudor period|Tudor]] plays were made and ran, but the ''new'' plays that were authored and staged were the domestic- and middle-class dramas. The other dramatic innovation was "[[spectacle]]": plays that had little or no text, but which emphasized novel special effects.

===Pantomime and tableau spectacle===
The public attended when they saw their lives represented on the stage, but also attended when there was a sight that would impress them.  If costumes were lavish, the sets impressive or the actresses alluring, audiences would attend.  The [[Restoration spectacular]] had seen the development of English opera and [[oratorio]] and a war between competing theaters to produce the most expensive and eye-popping plays.  However, these [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] productions could mean financial ruin as much as security, and neither of the two main playhouses could continue the [[brinksmanship]] for long.  After these battles between the playhouses, and these were multiple,&lt;ref&gt;Shesgreen 27&lt;/ref&gt; the theaters calculatingly sought the highest appeal with the lowest cost.  If the cost of ''rehearsal'' time, in particular, could be shortened, the theater's investment would be reduced.  Rehearsal time cost a playhouse its cast, its property masters, and its stages, and a long rehearsal meant fewer plays put on.  Additionally, dramatists received the money from each third night of box office, and this could be dangerous to a house that needed every farthing to defray costs.  Star dramatists could negotiate for more than one benefit night and might have terms for benefits on revival, while new, unknown, or dependent authors could be managed.  The solution for the theatrical producers was to cut the costs of plays and actors while increasing the outright spectacle, and there were quite a few plays that were not literary at all that were staged more often than the literary plays.
[[File:Hogarth-rehearsal (2).png|thumb|right|200px|A print by [[William Hogarth]] entitled ''[[A Just View of the British Stage]]'' from 1724 depicting the managers of [[Drury Lane]] ([[Robert Wilks]], [[Colley Cibber]], and [[Barton Booth]]) rehearsing a play consisting of nothing but special effects, while they used the scripts for ''The Way of the World'', ''inter al.'', for toilet paper.  This battle of effects was a common subject of satire for the literary wits, including [[Alexander Pope|Pope]].]]

[[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]] and [[Colley Cibber]] dueled over special theatrical effects.  They put on plays that were actually just spectacles, where the text of the play was almost an afterthought.  Dragons, whirlwinds, thunder, ocean waves, and even actual elephants were on stage.  Battles, explosions, and horses were put on the boards (Cibber).  Rich specialized in [[pantomime]] and was famous as the character "Lun" in [[harlequin]] presentations.  The playwrights of these works were hired men, not dramatists, and so they did not receive the traditional third-night author's profits.  A pantomime, after all, required very little in the way of a playwright and much more in the way of a director, and with John Rich and Colley Cibber both acting as star players and directors, such on-demand spectacles did not necessitate a poet.  Further, spectacles could be written quickly to answer to the public's whims or the rival theater's triumphs, rarely risked offensive political statements, and did not require paying benefits to a playwright.  In other words, they gave the managers more profit.  The plays put on in this manner are not generally preserved or studied, but their near monopoly on the theaters, particularly in the 1720s, infuriated established literary authors.  Alexander Pope was only one of the poets to attack "spectacle" (in the 1727 ''[[Dunciad|Dunciad A]]'' and, with more vigor, the ''Dunciad B'').  The criticism was so widespread that Colley Cibber himself made excuses for his part in the special-effects war, claiming that he had no choice but to comply with market pressures.

===The "chromatic tortures" and divas of opera===
If vacant, subliterary spectacles were not enough of a threat to dramatists, [[opera]], which had crossed over to England in the [[Restoration drama|Restoration]], experienced an enormous surge in popularity with [[Italian opera|Italian]] [[grand opera]] in England in the 1710s and 1720s.  In ''[[The Spectator]]'', both in number 18 and the 3 April 1711 number, and many places elsewhere, [[Joseph Addison]] fretted that foreign opera would drive English drama from the stage altogether. These early fears followed the sudden rage for the Italian singers and operas that took over London in 1711 with the arrival of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]].  Inasmuch as opera combined singing with acting, it was a mixed genre, and its violation of [[neo-classicism|neoclassical]] strictures had made it a controversial form from the start.  Addison, damning opera's heterogeny, wrote, "Our Countrymen could not forbear laughing when they heard a Lover chanting out a Billet-doux, and even the Superscription of a Letter set to a Tune."&lt;ref&gt;Addison, Joseph ; Steele, Richard. "The Spectator", 1853. 218&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of opera not only took up theatrical rehearsal time and space, it also took away dramatic subject matter.  Straight playwrights were at a loss.  As John Gay lamented (see below), no one could use music in a play unless it was as an opera, and Englishmen were nearly forbidden from that.  To add insult to injury, the casts and celebrated stars were foreigners and, as with [[Farinelli]] and [[Senesino]] (the latter of whom was paid two thousand pounds for a single season in 1721), [[castrati]].  Castrati were symbols, to the English, of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].  The satirists saw in opera the ''non plus ultra'' of invidiousness.  High melodies would cover the singers' expressions of grief or joy, conflating all emotion and sense under a tune that might be entirely unrelated.  [[Alexander Pope]] blasted this shattering of "decorum" and "sense" in ''Dunciad B'' and suggested that its real purpose was to awaken the Roman Catholic Church's power ("Wake the dull Church") while it put a stop to the political and satirical stage and made all Londoners fall into the sleep of un-Enlightenment:

:::Joy to Chaos! let Division reign:
:::Chromatic tortures soon shall drive them [the muses] hence,
:::Break all their nerves, and fritter all their sense:
:::One Trill shall harmonize joy, grief, and rage,
:::Wake the dull Church, and lull the ranting Stage;
:::To the same notes thy sons shall hum, or snore,
:::And all thy yawning daughters cry, ''encore.'' (IV 55–60)

[[Image:Dukes-theater-1671.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An 1875 [[postcard]] from the [[Victoria and Albert Hall]] showing the Duke's Company theatre in [[Dorset Gardens]] (the so-called "machine house") in operation from 1671 to 1709, which began as a playhouse and gradually became a house for [[spectacle]].]]
Furthermore, grand opera had a high degree of spectacle in it.  In the 17th century, when opera first came to England, it prompted enormously complex theatrical stagings to present illusions of [[ghost]]s, mythological figures, and epic battles.  When Handel's arrival in England spurred a new vogue for English opera, it also caused a new vogue for imported opera, no matter the content, so long as it would create an enormous visual impact.  Although some of the "Tory Wits" like Pope and [[John Gay]] wrote opera [[libretto]]s (the two combining for ''[[Acis and Galatea (Handel)|Acis and Galatea]]'' with Handel), opera was a spectacular form of theater that left too little room for dramatic acting for most of the playwrights.  Pope argued in ''The Dunciad'' that Handel's operas were "masculine" in comparison to Italian and French opera.  While this is a musical commentary, it is also a commentary on the amount of decoration and frippery put on the stage, on the way that Handel's operas concentrated on their stories and music rather than their theatrical effects.

It was not merely the fact that such operas drove out original drama, but also that the antics and vogue for the singers took away all else, seemingly, that infuriated English authors.  The singers (particularly the [[soprano]]s) introduced London to the concept of the [[prima donna]], in both senses of the term.  In 1727, two Italian sopranos, [[Francesca Cuzzoni]] and [[Faustina Bordoni]], had such a rivalry and hatred of each other (the latter had been paid more than the former) that the audiences were encouraged to support their favorite singer by hissing her rival, and during a performance of ''Astyanax'' in 1727, the two women actually began to fight on stage (Loughrey 13).  John Gay wrote to [[Jonathan Swift]] on 3 February 1723:
 
::There's nobody allow'd to say I sing but an Eunuch or an Italian Woman. Every body is grown now as great a judge of Musick as they were in your time of Poetry &amp; folks that could not distinguish one tune from another now daily dispute over different Styles of Handel, [[Bononcini]], and [[Aitillio]].  People have now forgot [[Homer]], and [[Virgil]] &amp; [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]].

These operas were spectaculars in every sense.  The personalities of the stars were before the stage, the stars were before the music, and the music before the words.  Additionally, opera brought with it new stage machines and effects.  Even Handel, whom Pope values as restrained and sober, had his heroine brought on stage by "two huge Dragons out of whose mouths issue Fire and Smoke" in ''Rinaldo'' in 1711.

The "problem" of spectacle continued in the 1720s and 1730s.  In 1734, [[Henry Fielding]] has his tragedian, [[Fustian]], describe the horror of a pantomime show:

::intimating that after the audience had been tired with the dull works of Shakespeare, Jonson, [[John Vanbrugh|Vanbrugh]], and others, they are to be entertained with one of these pantomimes, of which the master of the playhouse, two or three painters, and half a score dancing-masters are the compilers.  ...I have often wondered how it was possible for any creature of human understanding, after having been diverted for three hours with the production of a great genius, to sit for three more and see a set of people running about the stage after one another, without speaking one syllable, and playing several juggling tricks, which are done at Fawks's after a much better manner; and for this, sir, the town does not only pay additional prices, but loses several fine parts of its best authors, which are cut out to make room for the said farces.  (''[[Pasquin]]'', V i.)

Fustian complains as well that authors are denied stagings because of these entertainments, and, as well, that playhouse managers would steal plays from their authors.  As Fustian says earlier, a playwright could spend four months trying to get a manager's attention and then "he tells you it won't do, and returns it to you again, reserving the subject, and perhaps the name, which he brings out in his next pantomime" (''Pasquin'' IV i.).

==The reemergence of satirical drama, and the Licensing Act==
Toward the end of the 1720s, the behavior of opera stars, the absurdity of spectacle productions, and an escalation of political warfare between the two parties led to a reclamation of the stage by political dramatists.  During the later years of King [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], who favored Robert Walpole, there was a scramble for the favor of the future King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], his wife, and his mistress, and this combined with a shattering of public confidence in the government after the [[South Sea Bubble]] and revelations of corruption in the trial of [[Jonathan Wild]], [[Charles Hitchen]], the Earl of Macclesfield, and others.

===John Gay and comic inversion===
John Gay parodied the opera with his satirical ''[[The Beggar's Opera|Beggar's Opera]]'' (1728) and with it delivered a [[satire]] of [[Robert Walpole]]'s actions during the [[South Sea Bubble]].  Superficially, the play is about a man named Macheath who runs a gang for a criminal fence named Peachum, whose daughter, Polly Peachum, is in love with him, and who escapes prison over and over again because the daughter of the jailor, Lucy Lockitt, is also in love with him.  Peachum wishes to see Macheath hanged because Polly has married Macheath, unlike Lucy Lockitt, who is merely pregnant by him (and neither woman is concerned with Macheath's sexual activity, but only with whom he marries, for marriage means access to his estate when he is eventually hanged).  Peachum fears that Macheath will turn him in to the law, and he also feels that marriage is a betrayal of good breeding, that prostitution is the genteel thing.  Gay announced his intention to create the "[[ballad opera]]" with the play.  The music for the songs came from tunes already popular, and ten of the tunes were from the satirist [[Tom D'Urfey]], whose ''Pills to Purge Melancholy'' was a collection of coarse, bawdy, and amusing songs on various topics.  The [[ballad]] was associated with [[folk song]]s and folk poetry, and so Gay's choice of using ballads (although ballads written by a well-known author) for his music was itself an attempt to deflate the seeming pomposity and elitism of the opera.

For most of the audience, the central entertainment of the opera was the [[love triangle]] between Macheath, Polly, and Lucy, but satirically, the centre of the opera was the Peachum/Macheath story.  This story was an obvious parallel with the case of [[Jonathan Wild]] (Peachum) and [[Jack Sheppard]] (Macheath).  However, it was also the tale of Robert Walpole (Peachum) and the South Sea directors (Macheath).  Robert Walpole was one of the most divisive ministers in British history, and his control of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] ran for over two decades.  Until [[Margaret Thatcher]], no other [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] (the office would not exist in name until later) had as adversarial a relationship with authors, and he had ruthlessly consolidated power and jealously guarded it against all threats.  During the South Sea Bubble, Walpole was accused of being "the screen," protecting the moneyed directors of the corporation from prosecution and of cashing in his own shares for full value before the collapse of the stock.  Further, during the life and career of the actual Jonathan Wild, Walpole's Whig ministry was suspected of protecting and supporting the master "thief-taker."

Additionally, Gay's opera was a strict [[parody]] and inversion of the opera.  Gay has his thieves and prostitutes speak like upper-class gentlemen and ladies.  Implicitly, he suggests that the nobles are no better than the thieves even as he suggests that thieves have their own mock-monarchies, senates, and religion.  He has his Beggar (the putative author of the opera) explain that the two female leads have equal parts and therefore should not fight (a joke that witnesses of the diva battle would understand).  The supernaturally lofty settings of opera are, in Gay's hands, the warrens of [[St Giles]] parish.  For palace settings, he has prisons.  For throne rooms, he has taverns.  For kings, he has criminal fences.  For [[knight errant|knights errant]]/[[pastoral poetry|shepherd lovers]], he has a highwayman.  For goddesses drawn about on gilded chariots, he has a ruined maid, a chorus of prostitutes, and Polly (who is perversely chaste).  The [[aria]]s also use the same metaphors that were common in opera, and Gay's songs are themselves parodies of the predictable lyrics in opera.  In each case, high and low trade places and Gay's suggestion of an essential likeness of the ministry with its most famous thief extended also to a suggestion that high opera is essentially like tavern songs and rounds.  The play was a hit, running for an unheard-of eighty performances.  Subsequently, the songs, as well as the play, were printed up and sold.

Robert Walpole, who had some personal animosity to John Gay, attended the play and enjoyed it.  However, upon learning from a friend that he was one of the targets of the satire, he tried to have the play stopped.  When Gay wrote a follow-up called ''Polly,'' Walpole had the play suppressed before performance.  The suppression was without precedent, although it was soon to be used ''as'' a precedent, for there had been no actual attack on the ministry.  The anti-ministerial (Tory) sentiment was entirely derived from interpretation.

Playwrights were therefore in straits.  On the one hand, when the playhouses were not running operas imported wholesale from the continent, they were dispensing with dramatists by turning out hack-written pantomimes.  On the other hand, when a satirical play appeared from a literary source, the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] ministry suppressed it even though it came from the most popular dramatist of the day (i.e., John Gay).  Furthermore, the grounds of the suppression were all implicit comparisons, and nothing explicit.  Gay had not ''said'' that Walpole was a crook as bad as Wild, although he had suggested it.

===The new Tory wits, escalating satire, and the creation of the Licensing Act===
[[File:Tragedy of Tragedies, or the Magnificent History of Tom Thumb the Great (frontispiece).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Frontispiece to Fielding's ''Tom Thumb'', a play satirizing plays (and [[Robert Walpole]])]]
Robert Walpole's personal involvement in censoring entertainments critical of him only fanned the flames of the antagonism between himself and the stage.  [[Henry Fielding]], among others, was not afraid to provoke the ministry, and anti-Walpolean plays spiked after the suppression of ''Polly''.  Fielding's ''[[Tom Thumb]]'' (1730) was a satire on all of the tragedies written before him, with quotations from all the worst plays patched together for absurdity, and the plot concerned the eponymous tiny man attempting to run the kingdom and insinuate himself into the royal ranks.  It was, in other words, an attack on Robert Walpole and the way that he was referred to as "the Great Man" and his supposed control over [[Caroline of Ansbach]].  As with Gay's ''Beggar's Opera,'' the miniature general speaks constantly in elevated tones, making himself a great hero, and all of the normal-sized ladies fight each other to be his lover.  The contrast between reality, delusion, and self-delusion was a form of [[bathos]] that made the audience think of other grand-speaking and grandly spoken of people.  If a ridiculously tiny figure could be acclaimed a hero because of his own braggadocio, might other great leaders be similarly small?  Were they titans, or dwarves like Tom Thumb?  Fielding announced, essentially, that the emperor had no clothes, the [[prime minister]] no greatness.  Walpole responded by suppressing the performance of the play.  Fielding was a [[justice of the peace]] by profession, and so he knew that the ministry could only control the stage and not book publication.  Therefore, he tapped into the market for printed plays, and his revision of the play was solely in book form.  It was written by "Scribblerus Secundus," its title page announced (a reference to the [[Scriblerus Club]] of [[Jonathan Swift]], Gay, Pope, [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], [[Thomas Parnell]], [[John Arbuthnot]], and [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Henry St. John]]), and it was the ''Tragedy of Tragedies,'' which did for drama what Pope's ''Peri Bathos: or The Art of Sinking in Poetry'' had done for verse.  Fielding placed a critical apparatus on the play, showing the sources of all the [[parody|parodies]], and thereby made it seem as if his target had all along been bad tragedy and not the prime minister.  (Fielding's later novel, ''[[Jonathan Wild]]'', makes it clear that such was not the case, for it used exactly the same satirical device, "the Great Man," to lambaste the same target, Robert Walpole.)

Henry Fielding was not done with ministry satire.  His ''Covent-Garden Tragedy'' of 1732 was set in a [[brothel]] amongst the prostitutes.  Although the play was only acted once, it, like ''Tom Thumb,'' sold when printed.  Its attacks on ''[[poetic license]]'' and the antirealism of domestic tragedians and morally sententious authors was an attack on the values central to the Whig version of personal worth.  Two years later, Fielding was joined by [[Henry Carey (writer)|Henry Carey]] in anti-Walpolean satire.  His ''[[Chrononhotonthologos]]'' takes its cue from ''Tom Thumb'' by outwardly satirizing the emptiness of bombast.  However, it also encoded a very specific and dangerous satire of King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] and his statutory wife.  The king and queen never meet in the play, and the subject is the former's wars with personal discomfort and the latter's desire for adultery.  In particular, the Queen herself is implicitly attacked.  However, the play also appears to be a superficial work of fancy and nonsense verse, and it delighted audiences with tongue twisters and parody.  However, Carey worked ''[[The Dragon of Wantley]]'' into a play in 1734.  Fielding and Carey, among others, picked up the cudgels where the Tory Wits had set them down and began to satirize Walpole and [[Parliament]] with increasing ferocity (and scatology).  Although a particular play of unknown authorship entitled ''A Vision of the Golden Rump'' was cited when Parliament passed the Licensing Act of 1737 (the "rump" being [[Parliament]], a rump roast, and human buttocks simultaneously), Carey's ''Dragon of Wantley'' was an unmistakable attack on tax policy and the ever-increasing power of the London government over the countryside.  Notably, Fielding's and Carey's plays made allowances for spectacle.  Indeed, their plays relied upon a [[burlesque]] of spectacle and by spectacle, for the effects of TopsyTurvy armies in ''Chrononhotonthologos'' (stacked atop each other instead of in ranks) and the titular dragon of Wantley, as well as the miniaturizing of Tom Thumb and the lurid scenery of the Covent Garden brothel, were part of the draw and part of the humor for these plays.

The Licensing Act required all plays to go to a censor before staging, and only those plays passed by the censor were allowed to be performed.  Therefore, plays were judged by ''potential'' criticism of the ministry and not just by reaction or performance.  The first play to be banned by the new Act was ''Gustavus Vasa'' by [[Henry Brooke (writer)|Henry Brooke]].  The play invoked the [[Swedes|Swedish]] [[Protestant]] king [[Gustav Vasa]] to castigate the purportedly corrupt Parliament of Walpole's administration, although Brooke would claim that he meant only to write a history play.  [[Samuel Johnson]] wrote a Swiftian parodic satire of the licensers, entitled ''A Complete Vindication of the Licensers of the Stage'' (1739).  The satire was, of course, not a vindication at all but rather a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' of the position for censorship.  Had the licensers not exercised their authority in a partisan manner, the Act might not have chilled the stage so dramatically, but the public was well aware of the bannings and [[censorship]], and consequently any play that ''did'' pass the licensers was regarded with suspicion by the public.  Therefore, the playhouses had little choice but to present old plays and pantomime and plays that had no conceivable political content.  One consequence was that [[William Shakespeare]]'s reputation grew enormously as his plays saw a quadrupling of performances, and sentimental comedy and melodrama were the only "safe" choices for new drama.  Dramatists themselves had to turn to prose or to less obvious forms of criticism, such as [[puppet]] shows that [[Charlotte Charke]] would invest in.

==Effects of the Licensing Act==
[[Image:Othello-tragedy-18th.gif|thumb|right|200px|Othello "strikes" Desdemona in ''[[Othello]]'' from the 1744 Thomas Hanmer deluxe edition of [[William Shakespeare]].  Hanmer's was one of the "improved" editions that was roundly hissed by textual critics.]]
In comedy, one effect of the Licensing Act was that playwrights began to develop a comedy of sentiment.  This comedy was critically labeled as "high" comedy, in that it was intended to be entertaining rather than actually be funny, and brought about its entertainment by elevating the sentiments of the viewer.  The plots also relied upon characters being in or out of sympathy with each other.  Very late in the 17th century [[Oliver Goldsmith]] attempted to resist the tide of sentimental comedy with ''[[She Stoops to Conquer]]'' (1773), and [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]] would mount several satirical plays after Walpole's death. Both of these playwrights were taking advantage of a loosening of the censorship and popular weariness with "refined" comedy. Goldsmith's play reintroduces the country bumpkin character who outwits the sophisticated would-be rakes who are engaged in a plot to marry well. Sheridan, on the other hand, very consciously turned back to the [[Restoration comedy]]  for his models but carefully toned down the dangers of the sexual plots.

As mentioned above, another effect of the Licensing Act was to send the playhouses to old plays. Since any play written before 1737 could be staged without permission, theaters had a great deal to choose from.  However, they sought out Shakespeare, in particular, as the one author whose name alone could generate an audience as large as those formerly provided by leading poets.  Shakespeare's stature had been rising throughout the 18th century, and [[textual criticism]], particularly of Shakespeare, had resulted in reliable texts (''see [[Shakespeare's reputation]] for details''). Further, many of the expurgated and "improved" versions of Shakespeare were falling from favor.  Actors such as [[David Garrick]] made their entire reputations by playing Shakespeare.  The Licensing Act may be the single greatest factor in the rise of "[[Bardolatry]]."  However, other, less sparkling, plays were also revived, including multiple versions of ''Lady Jane Grey'' and ''The Earl of Essex'' (including one by [[Henry Brooke (writer)|Henry Brooke]] that had been written before the Act).  Each of these could be used as a tacit commentary on the politics of the contemporary court and as a political gesture. Therefore, when playhouses wished to answer the public's political sentiment, they could quickly mount a performance of ''Cato'' or one of the Lady Jane Greys or, if the mood was otherwise, one of [[Aphra Behn]]'s royalist plays, and some of the Restoration plays such as [[William Wycherly]]'s ''[[The Plain Dealer (play)|The Plain Dealer]]'' and [[William Congreve (playwright)|William Congreve]]'s ''[[The Way of the World]]'' were always promising comedy.  However, when they needed to fill the house reliably, regardless of political season, and show off their actors, they staged Shakespeare.

[[File:William Hogarth - David Garrick as Richard III - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|400px|[[David Garrick]], a celebrity actor, starring as King [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] in [[Colley Cibber]]'s revision of Shakespeare's play six years after the Licensing Act]]
Finally, authors with strong political or philosophical points to make would no longer turn to the stage as their first hope of making a living. Prior to 1737, plays were ''de rigueur'' for authors who were not journalists. This had to do with the economics of booksellers. A bookseller would purchase a book from an author, whether that book was ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' or ''Collected Sermons,'' and would calculate his chances of making money off of sales. He would pay the author according to the money he expected to make.  (For example, Goldsmith's ''[[The Vicar of Wakefield]]'' was famously sold to pay a single rent installment, whereas John Gay had been paid 1,000 pounds for his ''Poems on Various Occasions'', which was more than seven years of salary for his government job). That would be the only money an author would see from the book, and therefore he or she would need to produce a new version, new book, or a serial publication of the next work to have hopes of more income. Prior to 1737, novelists had come from the ranks of satirists (Jonathan Swift) and journalists ([[Daniel Defoe]]), but these novels had in common wide changes of scenery, long plots, and often impossible things (such as talking horses)—all features that made the works unsuitable for the stage. The exception was [[Aphra Behn]], who was a dramatist first and a novelist second. Her ''[[Oroonoko]]'' seems to have been written as a novel simply because there was no time for staging, as it was a political commentary on ongoing events, and she could not have another play on the boards at the time. Her ''[[Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister]]'', like ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and ''[[Moll Flanders]]'', was inappropriate for the stage.  However, after 1737, novels began to have dramatic structures involving only normal human beings, as the stage was closed off for serious authors.

Additionally, prior to 1737 the economic motivations for dramatists were vast. A playwright received the house take of the third night of a play. This could be a very large amount of money, and it would be renewed with each season (depending upon arrangements). Thus, [[John Gay]] grew wealthy with ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]''. In 1726, [[Leonard Welsted]]'s indifferent success, ''The Dissembled Woman'', was acted at [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]]. It netted him £138 for the author's benefit but only £30 for the printing rights.  After the Licensing Act closed off hopes for serious authors on the stage, the novel was the next logical path. In particular, [[Samuel Richardson|Samuel Richardson's]] ''[[Clarissa]]'' was published in serial form and made the author a substantial amount of money from subscriptions. The novel became a potentially lucrative form of publishing, and booksellers began to pay more for novels as novels began to sell more.  From being a form of exigency, the novel became a form of choice after the stage was shut down by the Licensing Act.  Therefore, the Licensing Act had the unintended effect of increasing rather than decreasing the power of dissenting authors, as it put a stop to anti-Walpolean sentiments and anti-ministry arguments on the stage (which could only reach audience members in London) and sent these messages instead to the novel form, where they would remain in print, pass from hand to hand, and spread throughout the kingdom.

'''''Best of the Best: Championship Karate''''' (also known as ''Super Kick Boxing'' and ''The Kick Boxing'') is a [[kick boxing]] game that features [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] kick boxing masters.  The object is to win the kick boxing championship by defeating an array of kick boxing masters in a series of fighting matches. The [[Sega Genesis]] version is one of the few games to offer support for the [[Sega Activator]] [[motion controller]].

The game was originally released in 1990 in Europe as ''André Panza Kick Boxing'' for various computers as well as the ''[[TurboGrafx-16]]''.

Martial artist/actor [[Ron Yuan]] stated in a 1994 interview that "I know a lot of pure gamers will disagree, but the best SNES fighting game from a purely technical martial arts point of view is ''Best of the Best''. It didn't get much notoriety, but my friends and I know martial arts, and they go nuts whenever we play."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=Supreme Warrior Prepares to Fight|work=[[GamePro]]|issue=64|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=November 1994|pages=60–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
In ''Brawl Stars'', players are ranked by their level and total trophies. Players collect brawlers and select one to use each game. Brawlers come in six rarity types: League Rewards, Rare, Super Rare, Epic, Mythic and Legendary. There are currently 21 brawlers in the game, including eight League Reward Brawlers, three Rare Brawlers, three Super Rare Brawlers, three Epic Brawlers, two Mythic Brawlers and two Legendary Brawlers. Players get brawlers from Brawl Boxes, (with the exception of League Reward Brawlers, which are acquired via gaining trophies), which can be acquired from keys or gems. Big Boxes can be acquired using gems or 10 Star Keys (earned by winning the first match in a map). Players can join bands to play alongside other players. ''Brawl Stars'' has eight unique game modes: Bounty, Brawl Ball, Gem Grab, Heist, Showdown, Duo Showdown, Robo Rumble and Boss Fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Torres|first1=Ida|title=Brawl Stars is an upcoming game from the makers of Clash Royale|url=https://androidcommunity.com/brawl-stars-is-an-upcoming-game-from-the-makers-of-clash-royale-20170617/|website=androidcommunity.com|publisher=Android Community|accessdate=18 June 2017|date=17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The player assumes the role of [[George Stobbart (Broken Sword)|George Stobbart]], a young American who is an eyewitness to the kidnapping of his girlfriend Nicole Collard.

The game was conceived in 1997 by [[Revolution Software|Revolution]].

It was the fourth and last game built with the [[Virtual Theatre]] engine, which was used to render the locations of the game's events.

== Plot ==
Six months after the events of ''[[Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars|The Shadow of the Templars]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=''Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror|developer=Revolution Software|date=October 1997|platform=PC|quote='''George Stobbart''': I'd been away from Paris, and hadn't seen Nico for nearly six months.}}&lt;/ref&gt; protagonist George Stobbart and his girlfriend, Nicole Collard, visit an archaeologist named Professor Oubier to learn about a mysterious [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] stone Nicole uncovered while researching a newspaper story. At Oubier's home, they are ambushed by two Central Americans, who kidnap Nicole, tie George to a chair and set the building ablaze.&lt;ref name=mrbillsadventureland/&gt; George unties himself and puts out the fire. He contacts Andre Lobineau, who reveals that Nicole had suspected that something would go wrong and had left the stone with him. Lobineau tells him of a gallery owner who can tell him more about Mayan art. George discovers that Oubier supplies the gallery with Mayan artifacts, which he imports through a company named Condor Transglobal. Following this lead, George finds the two Central Americans who kidnapped Nico. One of them, whose name is later revealed to be Pablo, is shown threatening and berating the other (later revealed to be called Titipoco). George knocks Pablo unconscious and discovers that Condor Transglobal has links with Quaramonte City in Central America. He also frees Titipoco, who had been manacled by Pablo. George finds Nico, who reveals that, while trying to expose a drug ring run by a man named Karzac, she was sent the stone instead, prompting her to arrange the appointment with Oubier.

The two escape the warehouse and retrieve the Mayan stone from Lobineau. Afterwards, they go to Quaramonte City in hopes of finding Condor Transglobal. They find the city under dictatorial rule by 'Madame La Presidente' Grasiento, and learn that the town contains no Condor Transglobal offices. The two meet Professor Oubier, who is talking to the chief of police, Raoul 'The General' Grasiento, about a mysterious chart. George confronts Oubier about his girlfriend's abduction, but the professor claims he knows nothing, and that he has not been in Paris recently. George decides to help a CIA agent, Duane, free a local agitator, Miguel, from jail by distracting General Grasiento. Afterwards, he prepares to detonate the jail wall but is arrested in the process. George gets Duane to tie a rope to the bars and pull the wall down with his truck, alerting General Grasiento. Miguel escapes, and Nicole and George flee down river on a boat. However, the boat sinks after being attacked by a helicopter.&lt;ref name=bs4 /&gt;

George wakes up the next morning on the river bank, and finds a treehouse belonging to a Christian missionary named Father Hubert. Hubert has been nursing Nicole back to health, but she has suffered a snakebite and requires special medicine. He takes George to the local Mayan village, as he believes the village Shaman will be able to help. George shows his Mayan stone to the shaman, who explains that, hundreds of years ago, Mayan shamans had trapped the god [[Tezcatlipoca]] inside a mirror. However, he was so powerful that he would inevitably escape, so they created three stones that contained the power to keep him imprisoned. Before they could be put in place, they were stolen by explorers: one by a Spanish pirate named Captain Ketch, who hid it in the Caribbean; one by an English ship, which took it to England; and one by Spanish explorers, who took it back to Spain. The third of these stones was in Nico's and George's possession. George returns to the treehouse and cures Nicole with medicine from the shaman. Shortly thereafter, the two separate to find the two remaining stones.&lt;ref name=bs5&gt;{{cite video game|title=Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror |developer=Revolution Software |scene=The search of the stones |date=September 1997 |platform=PC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicole tracks a stone down to a museum in London, England, where she encounters but does not recognize Professor Oubier. After he leaves, the stone is discovered to be missing and the museum is locked down. Nicole escapes via an abandoned subway station and finds Oubier on a boat in the Thames with Karzac. Nicole witnesses Karzac killing Oubier, and then sneaks in, takes the stone and escapes. Meanwhile, George tracks the remaining stone to a small museum in the Caribbean. Following subtle clues left by Captain Ketch, George learns that the stone was left on the nearby "Zombie Island". George explores Zombie Island and finds that a butchered remake of [[Treasure Island]] is being filmed there. He poses as a stuntman to gain access to the place where the stone is being kept, but gets captured by Pablo and his men to be used as a sacrifice to [[Tezcatlipoca]]. Nicole travels back to Quaramonte and saves George; together with Titipoco they enter Tezcatlipoca's pyramid. As they reach the central room, Karzac frees the ancient god there. However, Tezcatlipoca promptly kills Karzac. President Grasiento appears and attacks Titipoco, and their struggle sends them over a cliff. Raoul, realizing that he is expendable to his mother, chooses to save Titipoco. The protagonists place the stones into their respective slots, which causes Tezcatlipoca to be pushed back into the mirror. George and Nicole briefly celebrate and the final cut-scene fades into the credits.&lt;ref name=bs4&gt;{{cite video game|title=Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror |developer=Revolution Software |scene=Ending |date=September 1997 |platform=PC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
''Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror'' was conceived in 1997, by [[Charles Cecil]] and [[Revolution Software|Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph_int"&gt;Hoggins, Tom (4 January 2011) "[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/8238685/Broken-Sword-II-The-Smoking-Mirror-interview.html Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828152613/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/8238685/Broken-Sword-II-The-Smoking-Mirror-interview.html |date=28 August 2012 }}". [[The Daily Telegraph]]. Retrieved 12 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Cecil was the director and writer of the game;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror|developer=Revolution Software|date=October 1997|platform=PC|scene=Credits|quote=Writer and Director: Charles Cecil.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tony Warriner]], [[David Sykes (programmer)|David Sykes]], Jonathan Howard, Paul Porter, James Long, Patrick Skelton, Chris Rea and Pete Ellacot worked on the software side of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror|developer=Revolution Software|date=October 1997|platform=PC|scene=Credits|quote=Programmers: Tony WarrinerDavid Sykes, Jonathan Howard, Paul Porter, James Long, Patrick Skelton, Chris Rea, Pete Ellacot.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Noirin Carmody]] was the executive producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror|developer=Revolution Software|date=October 1997|platform=PC|scene=Credits|quote=Executive Producer: Noirin Carmody.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game uses the [[Virtual Theatre]] engine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror|developer=Revolution Software|date=October 1997|platform=PC|scene=Credits|quote=Tools: Virtual Theatre.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was previously used for ''[[Lure of the Temptress]]'', ''[[Beneath a Steel Sky]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=29 January 2007 |url=http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/index.php/site/reviews/228/ |title=''Adventure Classic Gaming'' Beneath a Steel Sky review |publisher=''Adventure Classic Gaming'' |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224071359/http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/index.php/site/reviews/228/ |archivedate=24 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars|developer=Revolution Software|date=September 1996|platform=PC|scene=Credits|quote=Tools: Virtual Theatre.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Charles cecil.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Charles Cecil; The game was conceived by him and Revolution.]] The artwork for ''Broken Sword II'' was developed through a number of stages. Initially pencil drawings were made of characters which were then digitally coloured in, before being cleaned up. The background layouts were produced in a similar way, starting out as pencil designs,&lt;ref name=PSPRO&gt;{{cite journal | publisher=IDGMedia | journal=PlayStation Pro | title=Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror review | first=Paul | last=McNally | date=January 1998 | page=34 | issue=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were all drawn by Eoghan Cahill and Neil Breen, who previously worked on the first ''Broken Sword'', working together with Amy Berenz and Lee Taylor. The game's graphics are animated in a style which resembles classic [[animated film]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=22 May 2007 |url=http://whatculture.com/film/broken-sword-the-movie.php |title=Broken Sword: The Movie |publisher=Whatculture! |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215546/http://whatculture.com/film/broken-sword-the-movie.php |archivedate=3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The music in the game was composed by [[Barrington Pheloung]], who also composed the music in ''Shadow of the Templars'', with [[Bob Sekar]] adding the closing score. Audio features of the game include recorded [[sound effects]], [[orchestra]]l music and [[voice acting]] directed by Edward Hall. While [[Rolf Saxon]] returned to voice [[George Stobbart (Broken Sword)|George Stobbart]], a new actress, [[Jenny Caron Hall]], was cast as [[Nicole Collard]]. The rest of the credited voice actors in the game are [[Dennis Chinnery]], Stephanie Clive, Jeff Fletcher, [[Corey Johnson (actor)|Corey Johnson]], Chris Miles, Gary Parker, Flaminia Cinque and Leo Wringer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror|developer=Revolution Software|date=October 1997|platform=PC|scene=Credits|quote=Voice Actors: Rolf Saxon, Jenny Caron Hall, Flaminia Cinque, Dennis Chinnery, Stephanie Clive, Jeff Fletcher, Corey Johnson, Chris Miles, Gary Parker, Leo Wringer.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remastered edition===
[[File:DaveGibbons2009.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Dave Gibbons worked on the game's visual references and digital comic.]]
When considering the project, [[Charles Cecil]] played the game again and noticed many issues, including pixilated backgrounds, FMV and audio were of poor quality, and he also felt some dialogue was out of place. He thought all these elements could be addressed and improved in a [[remaster]]ed edition, in which they could add a diary, hint system, and new artwork from [[Dave Gibbons]], which they could offer as an interactive digital comic.&lt;ref name="Telegraph_int"/&gt;

On 9 December 2010, [[Revolution Software]] announced the release of '''''Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror - Remastered''''' on [[iOS]] devices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=9 December 2010 |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2010-12-09-broken-sword-2-remastered-announced |title=:''Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror - Remastered'' announced |publisher=''[[Eurogamer]]'' |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711051958/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2010-12-09-broken-sword-2-remastered-announced |archivedate=11 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was released on 16 December 2010.&lt;ref name=metaios/&gt; The new features include an exclusive interactive digital comic from [[Dave Gibbons]], fully animated facial expressions, enhanced graphics, high quality music, a context-sensitive hint system, diary, and a [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]] integration which facilitates a unique cross-platform save-game feature, enabling players to enjoy the same adventure simultaneously on multiple devices. It also featured full [[Game Center]] integration – including in-game achievements.&lt;ref name=metaios/&gt; The [[Macintosh|Mac]] and [[Personal Computer|PC]] versions followed in early 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

''Broken Sword II'' was a commercial success. By August 2000, it had achieved sales of 750,000 copies, of which 510,000 were sold at full price.&lt;ref name=revsales&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000818063517/http://www.revolution.co.uk/noflash/corporate.htm | url=http://www.revolution.co.uk/noflash/corporate.htm | title=Revolution Software - Company Profile | date=August 2000 | publisher=[[Revolution Software]] | archivedate=August 18, 2000 | deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game and its predecessor together sold roughly 2 million units by March 2001.&lt;ref name=2m&gt;{{cite press release | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021218094643/http://www.revolution.co.uk:80/press1.htm | url=http://www.revolution.co.uk:80/press1.htm | title=Revolution Confirms Next-Generation ''Broken Sword'' Title | date=March 20, 2001 | publisher=[[Revolution Software]] | archivedate=December 18, 2002 | deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Smoking Mirror'' received mixed to positive reviews from critics. ''Gaming Age'' gave the game a B+, saying: "The sound is another area in which The Smoking Mirror excels. Although there isn't a constant soundtrack playing, haunting music often accompanies certain actions, much like the original [[Tomb Raider]]."&lt;ref name=allmeta/&gt; ''[[PC Gamer]]'' gave it a score of 82%, saying it's "more of the same solid adventure fare found in Circle of Blood."&lt;ref name=allmeta/&gt; [[GameSpot]] gave the game a 7.9 out of 10 and praised it for its additions that "help to streamline the adventure", but criticised the "insufficient information about Tezcatlipoca and Maya civilization altogether" when it came to the storyline.&lt;ref name=gamespot/&gt; Jen of ''Four Fat Chicks'' gave it a "thumbs up" and stated that he would recommend this game for the good storyline and the beautiful graphics, but if players want a game that has more adventuring, they should look elsewhere.&lt;ref name=fourfatchicks/&gt; "Mr. Bill and Lela" of Mr. Bill's Adventureland praised its controls and humour, and called it an excellent sequel, that they wouldn't want to have missed out on playing.&lt;ref name=mrbillsadventureland/&gt;

{{Filipino film list}}
The '''cinema of the Philippines''' ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''Pelikulang Pilipino'' or ''Sine Pilipino'') began with the introduction of the first [[film|moving picture]]s to the country on January 1, 1897 at the ''Salón de Pertierra'' in [[Manila]]. The following year, local scenes were shot on film for the first time by a Spaniard, Antonio Ramos, using the [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumiere]] [[Cinematograph]]. While most early [[film director|filmmakers]] and [[film producers|producers]] in the country were mostly wealthy enterprising foreigners and [[expatriate]]s, on September 12, 1919, ''Dalagang Bukid (Country Maiden)'', a movie based on a popular musical play, was the first movie made and shown by Filipino filmmaker [[José Nepomuceno]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://su.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:200615 "The Role of José Nepomuceno in the Philippine Society: What language did his silent film speaks?"]. Stockholm University Publications. Retrieved on 2011-01-06.&lt;/ref&gt; Dubbed as the "Father of Philippine Cinema", his work marked the start of cinema as an art form in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;Armes, Roy.

Even with the problems currently facing motion pictures around the world, movies are still considered as one of the popular forms of entertainment among the [[Filipino people]], directly employing some 260,000 Filipinos and generating around [[Philippine peso|₱]]2 billion revenues annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/intl/philippines/yearly/|title=2014 Philippines Yearly Box Office Results|publisher=|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Film Academy of the Philippines]] established its own national film archive in October 2011.&lt;ref name="inquirer.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.inquirer.net/18699/finally-a-national-film-archive |title=Finally, a national film archive |accessdate=2011-11-02 |work=inquirer.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, their annually held [[Luna Awards]] honor the outstanding Filipino films as voted by their own peers. Meanwhile, the Manunuri ng Pelikulang Pilipino hands out the [[Gawad Urian Awards]], which is well known due to its credible choices of winners. Currently, [[Box Office Mojo]] compiles box office performance for local and foreign films in the country.

== Overview ==
The formative years of Philippine cinema, starting from the 1930s, were a time of discovering the [[film genre]] as a new medium of [[art]]. [[Screenplay|Scripts]] and [[characterisation]]s in [[film]]s came from popular [[theatre]] and familiar [[Philippine literature|local literature]]. Nationalistic films were also quite popular, although they were labeled as being too [[subversion|subversive]].

The 1940s and the war brought to the Philippine cinema the consciousness of [[reality]]. Movie [[Theme (literature)|themes]] consisting primarily of war and heroism had proven to be a huge hit among local audiences.

The 1950s saw the first golden age of Philippine cinema,&lt;ref name="curtain"&gt;[http://www.philnews.com/2005/wa.html "Is the Curtain Finally Falling on the Philippine Movie Industry?"]. ''PhilNews.com.'' Retrieved 25 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="film"/&gt; with the emergence of more artistic and mature films, and significant improvement in [[cinematic techniques]] among filmmakers. The [[studio system]] produced frenetic activity in the local film industry, as many films were made annually and several local talents started to earn recognition abroad. Award-giving bodies were first instituted during this period. When the decade was drawing to a close, the studio system [[monopoly]] came under [[siege]] as a result of labor-management conflicts, and by the 1960s, the artistry established in the previous years was already on the decline. This era can be characterized by rampant [[commercialism]], fan movies, [[soft porn]] films, [[action film|action flicks]], and [[Western (genre)|western]] [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s.

The 1970s and 1980s were turbulent years for the industry, bringing both positive and negative changes. The films in this period now dealt with more serious topics following the Martial Law era. In addition, action and sex films developed further, introducing more explicit subject matter. These years also brought the arrival of alternative or [[independent film]] in the Philippines.

The 1990s saw the emerging popularity of slasher movies, teen-oriented romantic comedies, as well as sexually explicit adult films, although slapstick comedies still draw a large audience. Genres of previous decades had been recycled with almost the same stories, and love teams, which had been popular in the past, have reemerged.&lt;ref name="film"&gt;Anonymous. [http://www.aenet.org/family/filmhistory.htm "History of Philippine Cinema"]. ''Philippine Journeys.'' Retrieved January 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippines, which as one of Asia's oldest film industries, remains undisputed in terms of the highest level of theater admission in [[Southeast Asia]]. Over the years, however, the film industry has registered a steady decline in movie viewership from 131 million in 1996 to 63 million in 2004.&lt;ref name="acclaim"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bleak"/&gt; From a high of 200 films a year during the 1980s, the country's film industry was down to making a total of 56 new films in 2006 and around 30 in 2007.&lt;ref name="acclaim"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bleak"/&gt; Although the industry has undergone turbulent times, the 21st century saw the rebirth of independent filmmaking through the use of digital technology, and a number of films have once again earned international recognition and prestige.

==History==

=== Origins and Early Development ===
{{Life in the Philippines}}
On 1 January 1897, the first four movies, namely, ''[[Un Homme Au Chapeau]] (Man with a Hat)'', ''[[Une scène de danse japonnaise]] (Scene from a Japanese Dance)'', ''[[Les Boxers]] (The Boxers)'', and ''[[La Place de L' Opéra]] (The Place L' Opéra)'', were shown via 60&amp;nbsp;mm [[Gaumont Chrono]]-photograph projector at the ''Salon de Pertierra'' at No.12 Escolta in Manila. The venue was formerly known as the Phonograph Parlor on the ground floor of the Casino Español at Pérez Street, off Escolta Street. Other countries, such as France, England, and Germany had their claims to the introduction of publicly projected motion picture in the Philippines, although Petierra is given this credit by most historians and critics.&lt;ref name="ncaa"&gt;Bautista, Arsenio 'Boots'. [http://ncca.gov.ph/subcommissions/subcommission-on-the-arts-sca/cinema/history-of-philippine-cinema/ "History of Philippine Cinema"]. ''National Commission for Culture and the Arts''. Retrieved January 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlo Naquera, a Spanish soldier from Aragón, was able to import a [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumiere]] [[Cinematograph]] from Paris, including 30 film titles, out of his savings and the financial banking of two Swiss entrepreneurs, Liebman and Peritz.

By August 1897, Liebman and Peritz presented the first movies on the Lumiere Cinematograph in Manila. The cinema was set up at Escolta Street at the corner of San Jacinto Street. A test preview was presented to a limited number of guests on 28 August and the inaugural show was presented to the general public the next day, August 29, 1897.&lt;ref name="ncaa"/&gt; Documentary films showing recent events as well as natural calamities in Europe were shown.&lt;ref name="film"/&gt;

During the first three weeks, Ramos had a selection of ten different films to show, but by the fourth week, he was forced to shuffle the 30 films in various combinations to produce new programs. These were four viewing sessions, every hour on the hour, from 6:00 P.M. to 10:00 P.M. After three months, attendance began to slacken for failure to show any new features. They transferred the viewing hall to a warehouse in Plaza Goiti and reduced the admission fees. By the end of November, the movie hall closed down.&lt;ref name="ncaa"/&gt;

The next year, to attract patronage, using the Lumiere as a camera, Ramos locally filmed ''Panorama de Manila (Manila landscape)'', ''Fiesta de Quiapo (Quiapo Fiesta)'', ''Puente de España (Bridge of Spain)'', and ''Escenas Callejeras (Street scenes)'', making him the first movie producer in the Philippines. Aside from Ramos, there were other foreigners who left documentary evidences of their visits to the Philippines. [[Burton Holmes]], father of the [[Travelogue (films)|travelogue]], who made the first of several visits in 1899, made the ''Battle of Baliwag''; [[Kimwood Peters]] shot the ''Banawe Rice Terraces''; and, [[Raymond Ackerman]] of ''[[American Biography]]'' and ''[[Mutoscope]]'' filmed ''Filipino Cockfight'' and the ''Battle of Mt. Arayat''.&lt;ref name="ncaa"/&gt;

=== American period ===
Film showing in the Philippines resumed in 1900 when a British entrepreneur named [[Walgrah]] opened the Cine Walgrah at No.60 Calle Santa Rosa in Intramuros. The second movie house was opened in 1902 by a Spanish entrepreneur, Samuel Rebarber, who called his building, ''Gran Cinematógrafo Parisino'', located at No. 80 Calle Crespo in Quiapo. In 1903, José Jiménez, a stage backdrop painter, set up the first Filipino-owned movie theater, the ''Cinematograpo Rizal'' in Azcarraga Street (now C.M. Recto Ave.), in front of the [[Tutuban Railway Station]].&lt;ref name="ncaa"/&gt; In the same year, a movie market was formally created in the country along with the arrival of silent movies and American colonialism.&lt;ref name="film"/&gt; The silent films were always accompanied by [[Phonograph|gramophone]], a [[piano]], or a [[quartet]], or when ''Caviria'' was shown at the Manila Grand Opera House, a 200-man [[choir]].&lt;ref name="ncaa"/&gt;

In 1905, [[Herbert Wyndham]], shot scenes at the ''Manila Fire Department''; [[Albert Yearsly]] shot'' the Rizal Day Celebration'' in Luneta 1909; in 1910, the ''Manila Carnival''; in 1911, the ''Eruption of Mayon Volcano''; the first ''Airplane Flight Over Manila'' by [[Bud Mars]] and the ''Fires of Tondo, Pandacan and Paco''; and, in 1912, the ''Departure of the Igorots to Barcelona'' and the ''Typhoon in Cebu''.&lt;ref name="ncaa"/&gt; These novelty films, however, did not capture the hearts of the audience because they were about the foreigners.&lt;ref name="film"/&gt;

The [[Philippine Commission]] recognized early the potential of cinema as a tool of communication and information, so that in 1909, the Bureau of Science bought a complete film-making unit and laboratory from [[Pathé]], and sent its chief photographer, the American, Charles Martin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haverford.edu/calendar/details/216341 |title=Lecture by Mark Rice: American Visions of the Philippines: Dean Worcester, Charles Martin, and the Creation of an Imperial Archive |date=October 29, 2012 |publisher=[[Haverford College]] |accessdate=October 3, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006093709/http://www.haverford.edu/calendar/details/216341 |archivedate=October 6, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to France to train for a year. When Martin completed his training, he resolved to document, in motion pictures, the varied aspects of the Philippines.

In 1910, the first picture with sound reached Manila, using the [[Chronophone]]. A British film crew also visited the Philippines, and filmed, among other scenes, the ''Pagsanjan Falls (Oriental)'' in 1911 in [[kinemacolor]].&lt;ref name="ncaa"/&gt; In 1912, New York and Hollywood film companies started to establish their own agencies in Manila to distribute films.&lt;ref name="ncaa"/&gt; In the same year, two American entrepreneurs made a film about the execution of [[Jose Rizal]], and aroused a strong curiosity among Filipino moviegoers. This led to the making of the first Filipino film, ''[[La vida de Jose Rizal]]''.&lt;ref name="film"/&gt;

By 1914, the US colonial government was already using films as a vehicle for information, education, propaganda and entertainment. The Bureau of Science tackled subjects designed to present an accurate picture of the Philippines before the American public, particularly the US Congress. By 1915, the best European and American films were shown in Philippine theaters. When [[World War I]] (1914–1918) choked off the production of European studios, Manila theater managers turned to US for new film products. With the variety they offered, American films quickly dominated the Philippine film market.&lt;ref name="ncaa"/&gt;

The first film produced by a Filipino is [[José Nepomuceno]]'s ''[[Dalagang Bukid]] (Country Maiden)'' in 1919 based on a highly acclaimed musical play by Hermogenes Ilagan and León Ignacio.&lt;ref name="film"/&gt; Early filmmakers, even with meager capital, followed some of the genres provided by Hollywood movies. The main sources of movie themes during this period were theater pieces from popular [[drama]]s or [[zarzuela]]s. Another source of movie themes at that time was [[Philippine literature]].

During the 1920s when the Germans and Russians dominated the artistic development of the film and its techniques (Examples are ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' – 1919, ''[[Nosferatu]]'' – 1922, and ''[[Battleship Potemkin]]'' – 1925), Filipino-Visayan filmmakers such as Max Borromeo, Florentino Borromeo and Celestino Rodriguez collaborated in making ''El Hijo Disobediente'' (The Disobedient Son) in 1922. This black and white silent picture could have been one of the earliest noted films from the Southern Philippines. The year 1929 marked the advent of talking pictures, but only in 1938 did the Visayan Film Industry have its first "talkie" entitle ''Bertoldo Ug Balodoy'' (Bertoldo and Balodoy) written by Piux Kabahar, which was followed by ''Mini'' (Fake; 1940), and ''Gugmang Talagsaon'' (Rare Love; 1940) by Virgilio Gonzales. In Cebu, the first movie houses were built by the Avila Clan: Ideal Theater (1911), Cine Auditorium (1922) and Cine Oriente (The old Teatro Junquera).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://benjieordonez.blogspot.com/2005/01/visayan-film-industry-retrospective.html|date=5 January 2005 |accessdate=2013-09-07 |format=Fee required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films have already been showing outside of Manila as early as 1897 through the feats of Señor Pertierra, a Spanish expatriate and a certain Englishman going only with the surname of 'Bischoff'. Mr. Bischoff was the first to show films in Iloilo in 1903. These were short features produced by the film company Cinematographo Pastor and were screened nightly from 6:30 to 9:30 in Bischoff's bodega or camarin in Calle Real. Later on, other film companies have also begun to rise such as Cinematografo Insular (which arrived from Manila to Iloilo in 1905), Cinematografo Teatro Colón and Cinematografo Parsien. To coincide with the rising of such film companies, there came the establishment of movie houses in Iloilo. In 1919, one highlighted event that stood out from that decade was the showing of the first full-length Tagalog feature film in Iloilo: Jose Nepomuceno's Dalagang Bukid (literal translation from Tagalog: 'mountain girl'). Thousands of Ilonggo film buffs went to see the movie and were highly moved by it. In Iloilo, Teatro Malhabour touted as the first cinema or movie house in Iloilo was opened to the public on July 3, 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Nereo Cajilig Lujan. {{cite web|title=HISTORY 101: Teatro Malhabour|url=https://www.facebook.com/nclujan/posts/1471644442868054?hc_location=ufi |work=Old Iloilo Facebook Group|publisher=Facebook}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other early cinema or movies houses in Iloilo City include the Rex Theater, Roxy Theater, Republic Theater and Cine Commonwealth built around 1910s–1920s. The two prominent or popular cinema houses in Iloilo include the oldest still existing and operating movie theater in Iloilo, Cine Palace and the now defunct Cine Eagle both built in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Glory Moralidad. {{cite web|title=A Brief History of 'Sine': Iloilo Cinema &amp; Movie Houses from the Late 19th Century and Beyond|url=http://projectiloilo.com/a-brief-history-of-sine-iloilo-cinema-movie-houses-from-the-late-19th-century-and-beyond/ |work=Bata Ako PH|publisher=Project Iloilo}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard TS Bautista. {{cite web|title=Regent Theatre J.M.

In 1929, the ''[[Syncopation]]'', the first American sound film, was shown in Radio theater in Plaza Santa Cruz in Manila inciting a competition on who could make the first [[talkie]] among local producers. On December 8, 1932, a film in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] entitled ''[[Ang Aswang]] (The [[Aswang]])'', a [[monster movie]] inspired by [[Philippine folklore]], was promoted as the first sound film. Moviegoers who remembered the film attested that it was not a completely sound film.&lt;ref name="ncaa"/&gt; José Nepomuceno's ''[[Punyal na Guinto]] (Golden Dagger)'', which premiered on March 9, 1933, at the Lyric theater, was credited as the first completely sound, all-talking picture in the country.&lt;ref name="ncaa"/&gt;

In the 1930s, a few film artists and producers deviated from the norms and presented sociopolitical movies. Ironically, the people who helped the film industry develop and flourish were also the same people who suppressed its artistic expression by inhibiting movie themes that would establish radical political views among the Filipinos. Instead, love and reconciliation between members of different classes of people were encouraged as themes.&lt;ref name="film"/&gt;[[Julian Manansala]]’s film ''[[Patria Amor]] (Beloved Country)'' was almost suppressed because of its anti-Spanish sentiments.

[[Carmen Concha]], the first female director in the country, also ventured into filmmaking, and she directed ''[[Magkaisang Landas]]'' and ''[[Yaman ng Mahirap]]'' in 1939 under Parlatone, and ''[[Pangarap]]'' in 1940 under LVN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pioneering women film directors cited. |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-26612673_ITM |work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=2 November 2002 |accessdate=2008-09-28 |format=Fee required }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite fierce competition with Hollywood movies, the Filipino film industry survived and flourished. When the 1930s drew to a close, the Filipino film industry was well established, and local movie stars acquired huge followers.

=== World War II and Japanese occupation ===

During the [[History of the Philippines#The Japanese Occupation and World War II (1941–1945)|Japanese Occupation]], [[filmmaking]] was suddenly put to a halt. As was the case in Japan's other colonial and occupied film markets, Japanese film companies took over the local exhibition venues replacing films from the Hollywood and the region with Japanese films for propaganda. Japanese films had been imported into the Philippines since the late 1930s but without great success. Japanese-sponsored film production in the Philippines continued until 1945 but was limited mostly to newsreels and educational films.

Although the Philippines never became a center for feature film production under the Japanese, it was a strategically important market for Japan. First, unlike Manchuria, where the Japanese literally had to construct a film industry, the Philippines already had many large, well-equipped motion picture theaters that were well-stocked with significant Hollywood product. Many confiscated films were exported back to Japan to train its filmmakers. Production facilities were better in the Philippines than any other market in the Japanese empire with the exception of Shanghai. This was another reason why such Japanese film companies as the Nanyo Film Association (南洋映画協会) and Film Distributors (映画配給者) each established branch offices in Manila in 1942. Further, due to the long period of American influence, the local film community boasted a significant number of people who had worked in Hollywood during the silent era and had considerable experience.&lt;ref name=Baskett&gt;{{cite book | last = Baskett | first = Michael | year = 2008 | title = The Attractive Empire: Transnational Film Culture in Imperial Japan | publisher = [[University of Hawai'i Press]] | location = Honolulu | isbn = 978-0-8248-3223-0 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lx4QfrTyvWEC}}, pp. 108, 110&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, Toho Studios sent director [[Abe Yutaka]] to Manila to produce the first of what would be the only two feature films to be entirely shot on location by the Japanese. ''[[Ano hata o ute]]'' (あの旗を撃て) aka ''Dawn of Freedom'' told the story of the Japanese victory at the Battle of Corregidor and the U.S. military's hasty retreat from the islands. The film presented the Japanese as Asian liberators who came to free the Filipinos from decades of colonial oppression that began with the Spanish and continued with the Americans. The film was shot in Japanese, Tagalog, and English and was written for the screen by Tsutomo Sawamura, co-directed by [[Gerardo de Leon]] (uncredited), and co-starred Fernando Po and Leopold Celecdo. The other Japanese-produced feature film shot in the Philippines was ''Tatlong Maria'' (1944).&lt;ref&gt;[[Baskett]] ''The Attractive Empire'', pp. 100–102&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the [[comedy duo]] [[Pugo and Togo]], popular for [[satire|satirizing]] Japanese occupation in the Philippines,&lt;ref&gt;[http://video48.blogspot.com/2009/10/pugo-and-togo-filmdoms-original-comic.html "Pugo and Togo: Filmdoms Original Comic Tandem"]. Video 48. Retrieved on 2011-01-11.&lt;/ref&gt; was renamed to ''Tuguing and Puguing'' because of Togo name's closeness to [[Hideki Tōjō|Tojo]], the name of the [[Prime Minister of Japan]] during the early 1940s. However, perhaps out of deference to the substantial local Japanese population, film censors were sensitive to Japanese complaints about negative representations of Japanese in U.S. films screened in the Philippines and aggressively cut scenes depicting Japanese soldiers committing atrocities in ''Thunder in the Orient'' (1939) and ''Fight For Peace'' (1939) years before Japanese military occupation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Baskett]] ''The Attractive Empire'', pp. 119-120&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], almost all actors depended only on stage shows on most major Manila movie theaters as livelihood. As a consequence, live theater began to thrive again as movie stars, directors and technicians returned to the stage.

=== Postwar 1940s and the 1950s: The First Golden Age ===
==== Post-war Cebuano and Ilonggo Cinema and its resurgence ====
After the second world war, a resurgence of Visayan films came about through Lapu-Lapu Pictures, which produced ''Timbu Mata'' (1948), starring Eva de Villa and Lino Ramas, and ''Damgo ni Adan'' (Adan's Dream), produced by Rudy Robles. Then came Mactan Films which produced ''Tahas'' (Mission; 1950), starring Luz Celeste and Dakay; Mat Ranillo was in this film. Then ''Balud'' (Wave; 1950) which starred Luz Celeste and Mat Ranillo. Another independent picture, ''Sa Kabukiran'' (In the Mountains; 1948), was also produced during this time.

By 1951, Azucena Productions was established by the Arong Family (owners of Rene and Liberty Theaters). They produced ''Princesa Tirana'' (Princess Tirana), 1951 with Mat Ranillo and Gloria Sevilla (her first feature title role after she was discovered through a declamation contest at the University of the Visayas) as lead players. Their first feature together made such a box office success in the Visayas and Mindanao that other features immediately followed: ''Leonora'' (1951), ''Pailub Lang'' (Be Forebearing; 1951), ''Utlanan'' (Border; 1952), ''Handumanan'' (Memoir; 1953), ''Inahan'' (Mother; 1952), starring Mat Ranillo and Caridad Sanchez; ''Antigan'' (1952) with Virgie Postigo and Arise Roa; ''Carmen 1 and 2'' (from the famous radio drama in Cebu; 1953), ''Paabuta Lang Ako'' (Wait for Me; 1953), ''Gloria Kong Anak'' (Gloria My Child; 1953), and ''Gihigugma Kong Ikaw'' (I Love You; 1954). Mat and Gloria then became synonymous to Visayan pictures, and since then were called as the King and Queen of Visayan Movies.

In 1953 a film entitled ''Sangang Nangabali'' (Broken Branches), produced by Cebu Stars Production broke box-office records in the mid-1950s. Cebu Stars Productions (owned by the Tojong Family) had earlier produced ''Dimakaling'' (1952) and ''Mga Anak Intawon'' (Oh, Poor Children; 1953). Other independent Visayan films produced at this time were: ''Mapait Ang Balaod'' (by Arturo Blanco; 1953), Bugas Mais (Corn Rice; by Arturo Blanco; 1953), ''Kapintas Sa Kinabuhi'' (Hard Life; 1953), (Cebu Stars Productions with Esterlina and Rebecca Torres), ''Pit Senor'' (Hail Senor) and ''San Tilmo'' (1953), (Barba Productions), ''Ang Siloy'' (1953) (with Nora Hermosa and Rebecca Torres), ''Huni sa Gugma'' (Where Is Love; 1953), ''Dadansoy'' (1953) and ''Inahan'' (Mother; 1954).

Mutya and VM Productions (formed by Natalio Bacalso – former Cebu assemblyman) entered ''Salingsing sa Kasakit'' (Partner in Pain), directed by Bacalso, in the 1955 FAMAS derby and won the "Best Child Actor Award" for Undo Juezan. These movie outfits also produced some memorable features such as ''Ungo Sa Parian'' (Witch In The Parian); Remember Erlinda;Rosita; ''Politika'' (Politics); and ''Mutya sa Saging Tindok'' (Muse of Saging Tindok). ''Garbosa'' (Proud; 1957) and ''Matam-is Ang Pagpaubos'' (Too Sweet to Suffer; 1957) were also released during this time.

Mat ang Gloria finally got married off-screen (in real life) and formed S-R Productions in 1954. The company's initial projects were ''Paradista'' (1955) and ''May Luhang Nahabilin sa Baybayon'' (A Tear Fell on the Shore; 1955) and even as they moved on to make Tagalog movies in Manila, they still continued producing Visayan movies like (It is the Palm That Commands) with Flash Elorde and Edita Clomera; ''Palad Ta Ang Nagbuot Lungsod Sa Buenavista'' (Town of Buenavista; 1969), and ''Hain Ang Langit'' (Where is Heavean?; 1969), with Gloria Sevilla and Mat Ranillo and Von Serna – this is Mat's last movie. ''Badlis sa Kinabuhi'' (The Line of Life; 1969) was entered in the [[18th FAMAS Awards]] and got 12 nominations out of 14 categories. Gloria Sevilla won [[FAMAS Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], Frankie Navaja, Jr. won Best Child Performer, and the late Mat Ranillo got a posthumous award (Mat Ranillo had earlier died in a plane crash in 1969). The film (''Badlis'') was the Philippine entry to the ASEAN Film Festival in Indonesia, and was showcased under the informative division of the Berlin Film Festival (the film was dubbed in English in Hong Kong and retitled "Destined"). In 1970, ''Badlis Sa Kinabuhi'' and ''Palad Ta Ang Nagbuot'' were released in their original Visayan versions in Metro Manila and made good at the box office. ''Ang Bayan'' (The Country), 1970 was also produced at this time.

The 1970s saw the emergence of more Visayan talents in the Tagalog film industry. Actresses such as Chanda Romero, Caridad Sanches, Alma Moreno, Tessie Sevilla, Rebecca Torres, Aurora Villa, Eva de Villa, Rosita Fernandez, Virgie Postigo, Virgie Solis, Olivia Solis, Cora Real, Diana Arong, Luz Celeste, Annabelle Rama, Suzette Ranillo, Lady Ramos, Pilar Pilapil, and others stepped into the limelight. Male leads (to name a few) were Bert Nombrado, Ber Lopez, Tony Delgado, Riel Ylaya, Lino Ramas, Arturo Blanco, Arturo de Castille, Frankie Navaja Jr, Tony Cruz, Undo Juezan, Felix de Catalina, Arsie Roa, Warfi Engracia, Kadyo Roma and Romy Kintanar (who is now a sports commentator). Directors Leroy Salvador, Fernando Alfon, Talyo Bacalso, Sat Villarino, Gene Labella, Leox Juesan, Cesar B. Cesar and Emmanuel H. Borlaza also originated from the south. Borlaza directed Alma Bonita (with Chanda Romero and Ernie Garcia) and Paypay Placid (Fan of Placid), Diadem Films, (with Pepito Rodriguez, Lilian Lain, Alice Mendez, and Justo C. Justo). Other films that were produced at this time were Medalyon Nga Bulawan (Medalyon Na Ginto), produced by Annabelle Rama, starring Bert Leroy, Gina Pareno, Jerry Pons, Charlie Davao, Johnny Delgado, Raul Aragon, Alice Mendez, and Yoyoy Villame; (with Nobo Bono, Jr. and Tessie Sevilla); Mayor AndalBatul of Mactan (Battle of Mactan), JRJ Productions, starring Chanda Romero, Eddie Peregrina and Alice Mendez; Anino sa Villa Lagrimas (Shadow of Villa Lagrimas), starring Chanda Romero and Ernie Garcia; Bulawan Sa Lapok (Gold in the Mud), starring Alicia Alonzon, Bert Leroy Jr., Tommy Abuel and Dindo Fernando; Antonio Solitaryo and Mga Milagaro sa Santo Niño (Miracles of Sto. Niño), Magnolia Films both directed by Sol Gaudite; Aliyana, 1974; and Ikaduhang Bathala (Second God), 1974.

Gloria Sevilla remarried in 1971, and together with her husband Amado Cortez (of the Padilla clan) went on to produce another Visayan film entitled Gimingaw Ako (I Long For You), 1974 (which was shot entirely in Cebu City and directed by Amado Cortez starring Gloria Sevilla, Suzette Ranillo, Bert Nombrado and Inday Nita Cortez). This film won the FAMAS "Best Actress Award" for Gloria Sevilla and "Best Supporting Actress Award" for Suzette Ranillo. Naghila Ako Sa Kahilum (Crying Silently) also came about within the year. Other independent productions were: Diego Salvador, 1973; Ang Pagbabalik ni Diego Salvador (The Return of Diego Salvador), 1974 with Von Serna; and Sabrin, 1975 with Chanda Romero and Rebecca Torres.

Visayan film producers continued trying to revive the Visayan movies in the mid-seventies by filming in the 16mm format and transferring the material to 35mm for theatrical release. Films such as ''Ang Manok ni San Pedro'' (St. Peter's Rooster), 1975 and ''Itlog Manoy Orange'' (The Orange Egg Vendor), 1976 were originally shot in 16mm. This less costly process, however, did not prevent the Visayan film industry from finally going into a dormant stage. The Tagalog film industry was just at an upswing at this time, prompting Visayan producers to venture into television production instead.

It was not until 1991 that another Visayan film project was brought to the big screen. ''Eh Kasi Babae'' (Because She Is a Woman) starring Pilita Corales, Yoyoy Villame and Manilyn Reynes was produced, then followed by ''Matud Nila'' (They Say; 1991) (Bisaya Films, Inc. produced by James R. Cuenco, Jr.). This starred Gloria Sevilla, Mat Ranillo III, Suzette Ranillo, Dandin Ranillo, Juni Ranillo, Pilar Pilapil, Jennifer Sevilla, Mark Gil and Pinky Marquez. Matud Nila also marked the last film directed by Leroy Salvador.

==== The Golden Age and Contemporary Era of Tagalog Cinema ====

After World War II, the Philippine version of a [[war film]] emerged as a genre. The audience were hungry for films with patriotic themes. Films such as ''[[Garrison 13]]'' (1946), ''[[Dugo ng Bayan]] (The Country’s Blood)'' (1946), ''[[Walang Kamatayan]] (Deathless)'' (1946), and ''[[Guerilyera]]'' (1946), narrated the horrors of the war and the [[heroism]] of the [[soldier]]s and [[guerrilla]]s.

The 1950s was labeled as the first golden age of Philippine cinema. Four big production studios ([[LVN Pictures]], [[Sampaguita Pictures]], [[Premiere Productions]] and [[Lebran International]]) were at their peak in filmmaking, employing premier directors like [[Gerardo de León]], [[Eddie Romero]] and [[César Gallardo]] while contracting the biggest stars of that period. The Filipino film industry was one of the busiest and bustling film communities in Asia, releasing an average of 350 films a year making Philippines second to [[Cinema of Japan|Japan]] in terms of film productions a year.

The premier directors of the era were (but not limited to):
* [[Lamberto Avellana]] (1915–1991)

The four biggest [[production company|production studios]] produced most of the notable films of Philippine cinema during this era. In 1951, the movie ''[[Roberta]]'' of Sampaguita Pictures which featured leading child stars was the hit. LVN Pictures, under the leadership of the [[Narcisa de Leon|Doña Sisang de León]], not only specialized in super productions, rural comedies and musicals, but also produced socially-relevant films such as Avellana's ''[[Anak Dalita]]'' (1956), [[Tony Santos]]'s ''[[Badjao]]'' (1957) and [[Manuel Silos]]'s ''[[Biyaya ng Lupa]]'' (1959). Sampaguita Pictures mainly produced high-gloss, glamorous pictures such as ''[[Maalaala Mo Kaya]]'' (1954). On the other hand, Premiere Productions released most of the [[action film]]s of the decade, such as ''[[Sawa sa Lumang Simboryo]]'' (1952), ''[[Salabusab]]'' (1954) and ''[[Huwag Mo Akong Limutin]]'' (1960).

High production values on the motion pictures during this era produced movies that gained international acclaim. In 1952, [[Manuel Conde]]'s ''[[Genghis Khan (1950 film)|Genghis Khan]]'' became the first Asian film to be shown at the [[Venice Film Festival|Venice]] and [[Cannes Film Festival]], a feat that would not be repeated until the 1970s. Inspired by Conde's picture, Hollywood remade ''Genghis Khan'' in 1956 as ''[[The Conqueror (1956 film)|The Conqueror]]'' with [[John Wayne]] as the lead star "The Conqueror", from RKO Radio Pictures. And also of Columbia Pictures' film "Genghis Khan" in which [[Omar Sharif]] portrayed in the title role in 1965.

In 1956, ''Anak Dalita'' won the Golden Harvest Award (Best Picture) of the prestigious [[Asia-Pacific Film Festival]]. Actress [[Lilia Dizon]], was presented with the Best Actress Award by the prince of [[Cambodia]], [[Norodom Sihanouk]], for the film ''Kandelerong Pilak'' in the 1954 Asia-Pacific Film Festival. [[Leroy Salvador]] was also recognized in his performance as Best Supporting Actor for the film ''[[Huk sa Bagong Pamumuhay]]'' (1953) in the same film festival.

During this era, the first award-giving body was also established in 1950. The ''[[Maria Clara Awards]]'' of the [[Manila Times|Manila Times Publishing Corp.]], was composed of film publicists and writers who voted for the exemplary achievements of Filipino motion pictures in a calendar year. In 1953, the María Clara folded up to give way to the establishment of the [[Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences]] (FAMAS), the Philippines' equivalent to the United States' [[Academy Awards]] in prestige.

During this period, Filipinos saw Hollywood's first full length picture in living [[Technicolor]]. Soon after, Filipino local producers started presenting full-length pictures in color despite some technical deficiency, one of which was ''[[Prinsipe Amante]]'' (Prince Amante).

=== 1960s ===
This era is characterized by rampant [[commercialism]] with [[James Bond]] and [[Western (genre)|Western]] knock offs, and in the latter 60's, the so-called ''bomba'' ([[soft porn]]) pictures. It was also the era of [[musical film]]s produced mostly by Sampaguita Pictures and their discovered talents.

The [[studio system]]s came under siege from the growing [[labor movement]], which resulted in labor-management conflicts. The first studio to close was Lebran followed by Premiere Productions then LVN. Those production studios were replaced by new and independent producers like [[Regal Films]], which was established by [[Lily Monteverde]] in 1962.

The decade also saw the emergence of the [[youth subculture]] best represented by [[the Beatles]] and [[rock and roll]]. As a result, certain movie genres were made to cater to this trend. Fan movies and teen love team-ups emerged, showing [[Nora Aunor]] and [[Vilma Santos]], along with [[Tirso Cruz III]] and [[Edgar Mortiz]] as their respective screen sweethearts. In addition, movie genres showing disaffection to the [[status quo]] during the era were also popular. Action movies with [[Pinoy]] [[cowboy]]s and [[secret agent]]s as the movers of the plots depicted a "society ravaged by criminality and corruption".&lt;ref name="film"/&gt; Another kind of youth revolt, implying rejection of adult corruption, came in the form of movies featuring child stars. Near the end of this decade, another [[movie genre]] that embodied a different form of revolt took center stage. [[Soft porn]] movies, more popularly known as ''bomba'' films, increasingly became popular, and these films were described as a direct challenge to the conventions, norms and conduct of the society.

Even in the period of decline, several Philippine films that stood out. These include the following films by Gerardo de Leon:
* ''[[Noli Me Tangere (novel)|Noli Me Tangere]]'' (Touch me Not) in 1961;
* ''[[El Filibusterismo]]'' (Subversion) in 1962;
* ''[[Huwag mo Akong Limutin]]'' (Never Forget Me) in 1960

During this period, Filipino filmmakers were more successful in presenting some full-length pictures in living [[Eastmancolor]], one of which was ''[[Ito ang Pilipino]]'' by J.E. Production. This movie was produced and starred by [[Joseph Estrada]].&lt;ref name="ncaa"/&gt;

=== 1970s to early 1980s: Second Golden Age ===
Touted as the second golden age of Philippine cinema, this was the period of the [[avant-garde]] filmmakers. At the turn of the 70s, local producers and filmmakers ceased to produce pictures in black and white.&lt;ref name="film"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ncaa"/&gt;

In 1972, the Philippines was placed under the [[martial law]], and films were used as [[propaganda]] vehicles. President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] and his [[technocrat]]s sought to regulate filmmaking through the creation of the ''Board of Censors for Motion Pictures'' (BCMP). Prior to the start of filming, a finished script was required to be submitted to the Board and incorporate the "ideology" of the [[New Society Movement]] such as, a new sense of discipline, uprightness and love of country. Annual festivals were revived, and the ''Bomba'' films as well as political movies critical of the Marcos administration were banned.&lt;ref name="film"/&gt;

''Maharlika'' was a 1971 film banned by then-first lady [[Imelda Marcos]] because it starred actress [[Dovie Beams]], who was allegedly Ferdinand Marcos' mistress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/02/19/Movie-stars-purported-Marcos-mistress/9743095020095/|title=Movie stars purported Marcos mistress|last=Deane|first=Daniela|date=February 19, 1987|work=United Press International|access-date=July 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709072143/http://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/02/19/Movie-stars-purported-Marcos-mistress/9743095020095|archive-date=July 9, 2017|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The producer of the film was Luis Nepomuceno, son of Filipino filmmaker [[Jose Nepomuceno]]. The company that produced the film went bankrupt, as the banned screening prevented them from recouping production costs. In pity, Imelda Marcos offered loans to the company through government banks. However, the bank would then go on to foreclose the film company.

The film portrayed the story of Ferdinand Marcos' life in the Philippine Military. There have been allegations that the film was propaganda intended to portray Marcos as a war hero who fought against the Japanese in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/07/03/1088488200812.html|title=Philandering dictator added Hollywood star to conquests|last=Walker|first=Frank|date=July 4, 2004|work=Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=July 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304094947/http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/07/03/1088488200812.html|archive-date=March 4, 2016|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the film was banned, it was allowed to make its cinematic debut in 1987, after the [[EDSA Revolution]].

In spite of the censorship, the exploitation of sex and violence onscreen continued to assert itself. Under martial law, action films usually append an epilogue like claims that social realities depicted had been wiped out with the establishment of the New Society. The notorious genre of sex or ''bomba'' films still existed but in a milder, less overt way like female stars swimming in their underwear or taking a bath in their [[chemise]], labeled as the "wet look". An example of the trend was the 1974 hit movie ''[[Ang Pinakamagandang Hayop sa Balat ng Lupa]]'' (The Most Beautiful Animal on the Face of the Earth) which featured former [[Miss Universe]] [[Gloria Díaz]] and filmed in the famed [[Sicogon Island]] in [[Carles, Iloilo|Carles]], [[Iloilo]].&lt;ref name="film"/&gt;

In spite of the presence of censorship, this period paved way to the ascendancy of a new breed of directors. Some of the notable films made by these new crop of filmmakers were:

*[[Ishmael Bernal]] (1938–1996)
**''Nunal sa Tubig'' (1975)
**''Salawahan'' (1979)
**''Manila by Night/City After Dark'' (1980)

*[[Peque Gallaga]] (b. 1943)

*[[Mario O'Hara]] (1946–2012)
**''[[Tatlong Taong Walang Diyos]]'' (1976)
**''[[Woman of Breakwater|Babae sa Breakwater]]'' (2003)

In 1977, an unknown Filipino filmmaker going by his [[pseudonym]] [[Kidlat Tahimik]], made a film entitled ''Mababangong Bangungot ([[Perfumed nightmare|Perfumed Nightmare]])'', which won the International Critic's Prize in the [[Berlin Film Festival]] that same year. Out of short film festivals sponsored by the [[University of the Philippines|University of the Philippines Film Center]] and by the [[Experimental Cinema of the Philippines]], young filmmakers joined Kidlat Tahimik by distancing themselves from the traditions of [[Mainstream (media)|mainstream]] cinema. [[Nick Deocampo]]’s ''[[Oliver (1983 film)|Oliver]]'' (1983) and [[Raymond Red]]'s ''[[Ang Magpakailanman]]'' (''The Eternal'', 1983) have received attention in festivals abroad.

In 1981, as mandated by Executive Order No. 640-A, the [[Film Academy of the Philippines]] was enacted, serving as the [[umbrella organization]] that oversees the welfare of various guilds of the movie industry and gave recognition to the artistic and technical excellence of the performances of its workers and artists.&lt;ref name="filmacad"&gt;[http://filmacademyphil.org/academy.html Film Academy of the Philippines Official Website]. Retrieved January 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, [[Viva Films]] was established and began its rise as a production company.

During the closing years of martial rule, a number of films defiant of the Marcos [[dictatorship]] were made. Films such as [[Marilou Diaz-Abaya]]’s ''[[Karnal]]'' implicitly depicted this defiance in the film's plot, wherein [[patricide]] ended a tyrannical father's domination. In the same year, Mike de Leon's ''[[Sister Stella L.]]'', a movie about [[oppression]] and [[tyranny]] was shown on the big screen. In 1985, Lino Brocka's ''[[Bayan Ko: Kapit sa Patalim]] (My Country: GTip the Knife's Edge)'' depicted images of [[torture]], [[incarceration]], struggles and oppression.&lt;ref name="film"/&gt; During this period, the Philippines ranked among the top 10 film-producing countries in the world, with an annual output of more than 300 movies.&lt;ref name="reborn"&gt;[https://www.straight.com/node/161057 Filipino film industry reborn] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321175222/http://www.straight.com/node/161057 |date=2012-03-21 }}.

The Philippines' most political filmmaker was [[Lino Brocka]] (1939-1991). His works such as ''[[Manila in the Claws of Light|Maynila: Sa mga Kuko ng Liwanag]]'' (1975) and ''[[Fight for Us|Orapronobis]]'' (1989) were considered as the opening and the end of the golden age of film in the country.  Brocka's works were committed to an anti-Marcos, anti-authoritarian type of politics and highly valued the freedom of artistic expression. He contributed in the building of a post-Marcos Philippines and was able to help topple the Marcos dictatorship through his active participation in cultural and social activities. His films told the story of the underclass' struggle, the dark side of a sprawling metropolis and featured poverty-stricken locations which were able to make a statement with regards to the Marcos' autocratic rule and human rights violations. He was also notably part of the group of filmmakers, artists and cultural workers that formed the ''Free Artist Movement'' which eventually became the ''Concerned Artists of the Philippines''. This group challenged the censorship practice that the Marcoses imposed on all artistic media.

=== Late 1980s to 1990s ===
Around this period, most Filipino films were mass-produced with quality sacrificed for commercial success. Story lines were unimaginative and predictable, comedy was [[slapstick]], and the acting was either mediocre or overly dramatic. Producers were antipathetic to new ideas, or risk-taking. Instead, they resorted to formulas that worked well in the past that cater to the standards and tastes of the masses.&lt;ref name="curtain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reborn"/&gt; Teen-oriented films, massacre movies, and soft pornographic pictures composed the majority of the genre produced.&lt;ref name="film"/&gt;

The film industry prospered and produced more than 200 films a year. Majority of them were ''pito-pito'' films, shot in seven to ten days and aimed at quickly recouping their minimal costs. Attendance in theaters rose and several productions became huge successes. New laws were also introduced that gave more rights to women, causing several female directors to launch careers.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Kristin and Bordwell David. (2010) "Film History: An Introduction". New York: McGraw-Hill. p. 646&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from competition with Hollywood films,&lt;ref name="bleak"/&gt; the [[Asian Financial Crisis]], escalating cost of film production, exorbitant taxes, arbitrary and too much film censorship, high-tech film piracy,&lt;ref name="piracy"&gt;[http://www.businessmirror.com.ph/06182008/nation05.html It’s total war on pirates as movie industry reels] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124003059/http://businessmirror.com.ph/06182008/nation05.html |date=2009-01-24 }}. Mocon, Claudeth. ''Business Mirror''.

In 1993, a television station ventured into movie production. [[ABS-CBN]]'s [[Star Cinema]] produced ''[[Ronquillo: Tubong Cavite, Laking Tondo]]'' in cooperation with [[Regal Films]]. Five years later, another television station, [[GMA Network]], started producing movies. [[GMA Films]] released the critically acclaimed ''[[Sa Pusod ng Dagat]]'', ''[[José Rizal (film)|Jose Rizal]]'', and ''[[Muro Ami]]'', which attained commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wowparadisephilippines.com/category/philippine-movies Philippine movies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104002032/http://www.wowparadisephilippines.com/category/philippine-movies |date=2009-01-04 }}.

Thereafter, a new sense of excitement and trend enveloped the industry with the coming of digital and experimental cinema. Seemingly signalling this was the winning of the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival 2000 of Raymond Red's short film ''ANINO'' (Shadows).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/archives/2000/awardCompetition.html|title=Awards 2000 : Competition|work=Festival de Cannes|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; But truly pioneering this digital revolution was the 1999 digital feature film "STILL LIVES" by Jon Red.

Retrieved January 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Production of [[action film]]s is on a decline, and formulaic romantic comedies constituted the majority of mainstream releases. However, independent filmmakers spurred a renewed interest in Filipino movies through digital movies.

It was in 1999 that digital cinema was introduced in the Philippines but by then, the film industry was already dwindling in numbers. According to the records of the UP Film Institute, 122 films were produced in the year 1999 and 83 in 2000. In 2002, the number went even lower with having only 92 films then further went down to 80 in 2003. This decline in film production was attributed to the country's economic movement wherein the Philippine Film industry was considered as one of the heavily taxed industries in terms of equipment, materials and film stock and the imposition of a 30 percent amusement tax to be paid to the local government and a 12 percent value added tax to the central government. Consequently, the high production costs brought about by the high taxes caused ticket admission to also go up. Thus leading to people opting for a different and cheaper form of entertainment particularly in television.

Signs of rebirth of the Philippine cinema arose by way of movies with inspirational themes. In 2002, [[Gil Portes]] released ''[[Mga Munting Tinig]] (Small Voices)'', a subdued movie about a teacher who inspired her students to follow their dreams; the movie also implied improving the country's education system. A year later, [[Mark Meily]]'s comedy ''[[Crying Ladies]]'', about three Filipinas working as professional mourners in Manila's [[Chinatown, Manila|Chinatown]] but looking for other ways to earn a living, became a huge hit. Also that same year, [[Maryo J. de los Reyes]] made a buzz at various film festivals with ''[[Magnifico (film)|Magnifico]]'', a simple film with universal appeal about a boy trying to help his family survive their hardships.&lt;ref name="reborn" /&gt;

In 2005, the film industry saw the lowest number of films produced with only 50 films that were commercially released. However, the establishment of film festivals [[Cinemalaya Philippine Independent Film Festival|''Cinemalaya'']] and ''[[Cinema One Originals]]'' which are dedicated to digital films, the addition of ''Digital Lokal'', a digital section, at the [[Cinemanila International Film Festival]], and the second offering of the .MOV International Digital Film Festival helped save the Philippine Film industry.

In 2006 and 2007, Filipino filmmakers started making movies using digital media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://supreme.ph/2008/11/04/indie-films-gaining-ground-in-local-movie-industry/ Indie films gaining ground in local movie industry] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213231512/http://supreme.ph/2008/11/04/indie-films-gaining-ground-in-local-movie-industry/ |date=2009-02-13 }}.

Writer/Director Crisaldo Pablo used a cast of friends and some professional actors, and with the use of a [[Sony CCD-VX3|Sony VX-1]], a [[Hi-8]] [[camcorder]], made the first full-length digital movie ever shot in the Philippines. Comments by Cris Pablo and casts in the 'making of' featurette on the DVD demonstrated how much dedication to vision played in this movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398031/|title=Duda (2003) - IMDb|author=gradyharp|date=23 December 2003|work=IMDb|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Donsol (film)|Donsol]]'', by director [[Adolf Alix]], made waves with his debut digital movie about [[Donsol]], a fishing town and in the opposite, a sanctuary to endangered whale sharks. Other filmmakers of note include [[Jeffrey Jeturian]], [[Auraeus Solito]], and [[Brillante Mendoza]] with his 2007 Filipino version of Danish [[Dogme 95]] and Italian [[Cinéma vérité]], ''Tirador'' (Slingshot). [[Lav Diaz]] is a leading figure in experimental Tagalog films whose works include long epics about Filipino life, some of which run up to 10 hours often testing the endurance of viewers.&lt;ref name="reborn"/&gt;

Many of the bills seek to ease the multiple taxes on producers, theater operators and patrons. One of the bills, for instance, proposes to exempt from the 30-percent amusement tax on all locally produced movies classified by regulators as for "general patronage" or "parental guidance-13".

=== 2010s: Box Office Resurgence ===
Since the year 2009, the presence of box-office films in the Philippine Box Office has surged, with ''[[You Changed My Life]]'' starring [[Sarah Geronimo]] and [[John Lloyd Cruz]] generated ₱230 million, making it the first Filipino movies to breach the 200 million pesos mark. This started the commercial box office success trend in local Philippine Cinema.

[[File:Vice Ganda in Toronto 2014 02.jpg|thumb|[[Vice Ganda]] starred in some of the highest-grossing Filipino films with the highest one being at ₱598 million.]]

== Censorship ==

=== Under the Americans and the Early Philippine Republic ===
Censorship in the Philippines truly began under the reign of the Spaniards, who prohibited works that were deemed revolutionary. While they prohibited literary, musical, and visual forms of art, film censorship was included in the picture upon the American colonization.

When the Americans took over after the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898, a brief stint of Philippine cultural freedom after independence from Spain was halted. [[Arthur MacArthur Jr.|General Arthur MacArthur’s]] military censorship focused on repressing nationalism, along with the [[Flag Act (Philippines)|Flag Act]] of 1907. Because film in itself was only beginning to form at the time, motion pictures brought to the Philippines were tame, and film was not yet seen as an avenue for social and cultural subversion.

In 1929, the Philippine Legislature creates Act. No. 3582, titled "An Act to Create a Board of Censorship for Moving Pictures and Define Its Functions". The board consisted of 15 members that sought ''"to examine all films, spoken or silent, imported or produced in the Philippine Islands, and prohibit the introduction and exhibition in this country of films, which in their judgement are immoral or contrary to law and good customs or injurious to the prestige of the Government of people of the Philippine Islands".'' In 1930, The first meeting of the board was conducted in the office of then Secretary of the Interior [[Honoro Ventura]], and the first president of the board was [[Teodoro Kalaw|Teodoro M. Kalaw]]. Out of the 1,249 films approved, 6 had parts cut out. Two films were banned.

In 1937 the film ''[[Batang Tulisan]]'', directed by [[:tl:Rod Avlas|Rod Avlas]] and produced by Philippine Films was set to be released, and controversies arose regarding its sudden ban. The cost of production totaled 16,000 Pesos, and the film 2 and a half months to complete. Four reasons were stated as to why it was pulled-out: Three are aspects of the movie: the priest portrayed in a villainous light, the use of a hypodermic needle as a murder weapon, the amorous scenes between a 10-year-old couple, and the fact that ''"[the film] might give [the] youth certain subversive ideas".'' The production crew argued that this was an example of foreign films being given more lenience, despite being as bad (or sometimes, worse) than local cinema. The novel adaptation of ''Batang Tulisan'' which was published in ''[[Liwayway]]'' Magazine, in contrast, was not met with the same negative criticism.

In 1938, the Board of Censorship was renamed the Board of Review for Moving Pictures, enabled by the amendment of the law by Commonwealth Act No. 305.

=== The Eiga Heikusa: Under Japanese Rule ===
In 1942, the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines]] led to what was arguably the strictest period of censorship the country has faced. The ''[[Eiga Heikusa]]'' was established to act as a Board of Censors, and introduced Japanese films with American subtitles. In light of Japan's desire to convert the Philippines into a willing member of the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere|Greater East-Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]], printed matter, radio shows, theater plays, and visual art were heavily monitored, leading to the hiatus of production for Philippine cinema until 1945. As a result, the country saw an increase in theatrical productions. Screen actors such as [[Carmen Rosales]], [[Rogelio de la Rosa]], [[Norma Blancaflor]], [[Ely Ramos]], [[Elsa Oria]], [[Leopoldo Salcedo]], and [[Ester Magalona]], took to the ''entablado'' and were received well. Theaters showed ''[[bodabil]]'' (a malapropism of [[Vaudeville]]) shows where actors would perform a special number upon knowing that they were to be raided by the ''[[Kenpeitai|Kempei Tai]]'', signaling the viewers to flee.

=== Post-War Censorship ===
Liberation from colonizers and the regime of then President [[Manuel Roxas]] saw the creation of a new Board of Reviews for Moving Pictures, led by Marciano Roque, who would also become Executive Secretary under President [[Elpidio Quirino|Quirino]]. In months, the board reviewed 76 films, with only 5 being locally made. Due to the non-confirmation by the [[First Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] of all 10 members of the board, it was reconstituted on October 29, 1946 with its 7 official members. The newly appointed chairman was [[Gabriel Mañalac|Dr. Gabriel Mañalac]], and the secretary was Teodoro Valencia. The board had grown to 12 members by 1947, having reviewed a total of 463 films for the year. 435 were foreign, and 28 were locally produced. By the time, the Philippines had 463 officially recorded theaters, with 71 of them being in Manila. ''Ako Raw Ay Huk'' (Dir. [[Ramon A. Estella|Ramon Estrella]]) is one of the films that was banned at the time, due to allegations of it promoting Communism.

In 1950, a Code of Motion Picture Censorship was instilled, further identifying what aspects were considered as censorable. Scenes that depict drunkenness as attractive, scenes that depict drug trafficking, and scenes that deal with sex and surgical subjects "when shown to selected groups" are some examples of scenes that were put under review. Foreign films banned at the time include ''[[The Moon Is Blue]]'' (Dir. [[Otto Preminger]]) in 1954, and ''[[Martin Luther (1953 film)|Martin Luther]]'' (Dir. [[Irving Pichel]]) in 1953. ''Perlas ng Silangan'' (Dir. Pablo Santiago) was screened without edits, which spiked a protest from the Provincial Board of Sulu, claiming that it misrepresented [[Muslim]] culture.

The Citizens Council for Better Motion Pictures was established by in 1960, as a response to a "grave concern over the general disappearance of the cherished virtues and traditions of the Christian way of life, the alarming increase in juvenile delinquency, and the deterioration of public and private morals". In 1961, they lobbied for what is presently known as the Censorship Law (Republic Act No. 3060), which was approved on June 17, 1961. The law created an Appeals Committee, composed of the undersecretaries of justice, national defense, and education. This committee could revoke the decisions of the Board of Censors. Independent from the CCBMP, the still standing Board of Censors had grown to 24 members, and could now establish a system of classification which consisted of two categories: "for general patronage". and "for adults only". Jose L. Guevara was appointed by President [[Diosdado Macapagal]] as the new chairperson in 1962, and the board members appointed by President Carlos P. Garcia were removed, on account of their positions being "midnight" extensions.

In 1962, the board lifted the ban on mouth-to-mouth kissing, so long as it was deemed non-lascivious. In 1963 and after a long-pleaded appeal from the public, the board bans films that heavily play up violence and crime. ''Ang Manananggol Ni Ruben'' (Dir. [[Eddie Garcia]]) was a 1963 film heavily based on the story of [[Ruben Ablaza]], who was convicted for the rape of [[Annabelle Huggins]]. The film was initially approved and quickly banned in September, but was screened again in December after being renamed to ''Ang Manananggol.''

In 1965, ''Iginuhit ng Tadhana'' (Dir. [[José de Villa|Jose de Villa]]) is released, and is arguably one of the most controversial films to come out of Philippine cinema, in that it was able to set the tone of [[Ferdinand Marcos]]’ entire presidential campaign. The movie, which chronicled the life of Marcos, had reached the realm of politics, ultimately leading the appointment of Marcos to presidency. In August 1965, the film was approved without change, but its premiere in September was halted on the time of the premiere itself. An ''[[en banc]]'' of the film was requested by then acting chairman Rosalina Castro, raising much suspicion from the press and the [[Nacionalista Party|Nacionalistas]]. Days after, then chairman Jose L. Guevara resigned from his spot.

=== Bomba Films ===
1967 onwards saw a relaxing of rules by the Board of Censorship, who started allowing more nudity and explicit sex. This led to the rise of commercial, pornographic ''bomba'' (taken from the term "bombshell", which normally included a scandal in Political public office) films, which persisted despite heavy criticizing from Catholic groups. These films usually depicted outright nudity and sexual scenes, cut portions from previously banned films, or the entire prohibited films themselves.

The rise of ''bomba'' films was attributed to the fact that movies tackled more adult, realistic themes. The ideal of a "true Filipino" was introduced. These films also brought in a new audience for Philippine film; the usual filmgoers, the teenagers who saw the films as "hip", and the youth, who used these films as a means for their own sexual awakenings, the educated, collegiate, and the working-class crowd. On another side, the larger audience of these films were the male devotees, who came to see the sex scenes and left as soon as the last one finished airing. Some films from this era include ''Ang Saging ni Pacing, Dayukdok'' (Dir. Luis San Juan; the movie was only approved by the board upon being renamed to ''Ang Magsasaing ni Pacing), Ang Batuta ni Drakula'' (Dir. Luis San Juan)'', Gutom'' (Dir. [[Danny Zialcita]])'', Sabik'' (Dir. Angelito de Guzman)'', Laman sa Laman'' (Dirs. Lauro Pacheco, Jose Sibal)'','' and ''Hayok'' (Dir. Ruben Abalos) among many other titles.

While the non-ban of these kinds of films led to the liquidation of censorship committees for most countries, this was not the case for the Philippines, likely due to the demand in box office. On February 22, 1970, the theaters ''Pablace'' and ''Mayfair'' are picketed by protesters who went against ''bomba'' movies. In 1972, the Board begins its anti-sex policy, which was backed by the general public who deemed the films as "attributing to the upsurge of crimes by minors and loose morality of youth".

=== The Martial Law Era ===
Prior to the administration of Ferdinand Marcos and the declaration of [[Martial law in the Philippines|Martial Law]] in 1972, policing films had been a matter which only went as far as censorship and the non-distribution of movies in the country. The Board of Censorship then had no right to take legal action against any film, director, actor, producing company, or theater that had violated any of its mandates. Cases like these were to be brought up to the local government, who had jurisdiction over legal matters.

On September 27, 1972, Marcos issues Letter of Instructions No. 13,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; which intended to further uphold morality in the youth through monitoring films. The letter stated 7 kinds of films that were not to be exhibited in any local theater:

# ''Films which tend to incite subversion, insurrection or rebellion against the State;''
# '' Films which tend to undermine the faith and confidence of the people in their government and/or duly constituted authorities;''
# '' Films which glorify criminals or condone crimes;''
# '' Films which serve no other purpose but to satisfy the market for violence or pornography;''
# '' Films which offend any race or religion;''
# '' Films which tend to abet the traffic in and use of prohibited drugs;''
# '' Films contrary to law, public order, morals, good customs, established policies, lawful orders, decrees or edicts; and any or all films which in the judgment of the Board are similarly objectionable and contrary to the letter and spirit of Proclamation No. 1081.''

What made this proclamation different from those appointed by the board was that the government now had jurisdiction over bodies that were at fault. It was proclaimed in coordination with the [[Department of National Defense (Philippines)|Department of National Defense]]. In fear of legal action and prosecution, the board tightened their rules, banning 148 imported movies and 50 local movies which displayed negative acts. Films were expected to uphold objectives of the [[The New Society|New Society]] through upholding moral values and ensuring that the ideologies shown did not subvert the peace of the nation and the mind.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Aside from the Letter of Instructions, the board had assumed three more rights apart from the right to cut scenes from movies: the right to (1) encourage, (2) warn, and (3) be consulted. Taking from the [[British Board of Film Classification|British Board of Film Censors]], the board started requiring submission of the full script of a movie before it was slated to begin production. This allows the board to warn the producers of possible issues within the script. Due to this, there have been fewer portions cut out of local movies, with 163 of 173 films being approved for general audiences from September 21, 1972 to September 21, 1973.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This also resulted in longer, more sophisticated films that wasted less shooting time and production cost. The divide between the government and filmmakers (and in result, the viewing public) became smaller as national responsibility was embibed in the art of filmmaking in itself.

=== From Censorship to Classification: The [[Movie and Television Review and Classification Board]] ===
On October 5, 1985, Executive Order No. 876-A was created to reformat the Board of Review for Motion Pictures, leading to the creation of the [[Movie and Television Review and Classification Board]], which is still in power today. The board was created only for the purpose of classifying cinematic films and television shows. The board holds 30 members at any given time, with the first chairman after the Executive Order being [[Manuel Morato|Manuel "Manoling" Morato]], who took office in 1986.

The board classifies movies into 6 categories, listed below:

== Notable Controversial Filipino films ==
There have been many controversial films in the Philippine film industry that have caused a lot of rumors and notorious comments from its film viewers because these controversial films tackle sensitive issues on politics, sex, religion, and social life. Some of these films were praised, almost banned or totally banned.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Notable directors ==
[[File:Lav Diaz.jpg|thumb|[[Lav Diaz]]'s films have won some of the highest awards at film festivals like the [[Golden Leopard]] of [[Locarno International Film Festival]] and the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]].]]
Although foreign films were shown in the Philippines since the Spanish period, interest in the creation of local films was not given much attention by the Filipinos. However, the advent of Hollywood films during the American period sparked the interest of Filipinos and eventually led to the boom of filmmakers in the country.

*[[Jose Nepomuceno]] is known as the Father of Philippine Movies, and is considered as one of the pioneers of Filipino cinema. His first movie entitled ''[[Dalagang Bukid]]'' (1919), a stage play turned movie, is the first movie produced by a Filipino filmmaker. Along with his brother Jesus, they founded the film company ''Malayan Movies'' which later produced over a hundred movies. Some of the titles include ''La Venganza de Don Silvestre'' (1920), ''[[La Mariposa Negra]]'' (1920), and ''El Capullo Marchito'' (1921) among others.
*[[Lino Brocka]] was a prominent Filipino director who received fame in the 1970s. Growing up, he gained interest in American film which led him to pursue a career in the film industry. Most of Brocka's films revolve around the issues faced by the common Filipino such as poverty, discrimination, and politics. He is also known to be anti-Marcos and created films to protest against Martial Law. Some of his films include ''Ora Pro Nobis'' (1989) and ''[[Gumapang Ka Sa Lusak]]'' (1990) among others. He is a recipient of five Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences (FAMAS) best director in 1970, 1974, 1975, 1979, and 1990.
*[[Marilou Diaz-Abaya]] was a multi-awarded film and TV producer and director who gained fame for her film ''[[José Rizal (film)|Jose Rizal]]'' (1998). This film also earned her a Best Director Award from the [[Metro Manila Film Festival]]. Diaz-Abaya claimed that she used her films and shows as a way to promote social issues in the Philippines, such as the state of the country's democracy. Some of these films include ''Brutal, Karnal'', and ''[[Ipaglaban Mo!|Ipaglaban Mo.]]''

== Independent Filipino Cinema ==
Independent Filipino cinema, has existed for almost as long as commercialized cinema, but this type of cinema has not been recognized as much, and thus has few historical accounts. Many of the independent films show actual happenings in the society using authentic voices of the people, but oftentimes, these films have been suppressed due to its revelations about social and political realities or marginalized due to its cinematography. These films also sometimes offer valuable historical content.

In its early beginnings, alternative cinemas were documentaries about the Philippines. Jose Nepomuceno was first commissioned to make documentaries about the richest industries in the Philippines, and his most famous one was about the hemp industry. Other alternative films made during 1920–1955 include Old Manila, Tres Sangganos, Intramuros, Jose Rizal, March of the Time Series: The Philippines, and Woodcarving in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;N. Deocampo, "Alternative Cinema", accessed June 26, 2017, http://nlpdl.nlp.gov.ph:81/CC01/NLP00VM052mcd/v8/v5.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the films above were destroyed during World War II. However, in the film archives in Washington DC, only the old film titled ''March of Time Series: The Philippines'' by Louis de Rochemont survived&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nlpdl.nlp.gov.ph:81/CC01/NLP00VM052mcd/v8/v5.pdf|title=Alternative Cinema|last=Deocampo|first=N.|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film making halted during the Japanese occupation however, some documentaries and newsreels were made such as ''Laurel Review His Troops (1943), First Session of the National Assembly (1943), New Cabinet Organized (1943),'' and ''What Do You Think? (1943).''

1950s to 1970s saw the rise of the First Independent Film Movement when the production of short films had a substantial increase, and these short films were garnering awards locally and internationally. Furthermore, several film organizations were formed during this time such as the Film Institute of the Philippines, Film Society of the Philippines. Some of the alternative films produced during this time include El Legado, Soul of a Fortress, Mangandingay: A Place of Happiness, The Wall, Mababangong Bangungot, Masinloc, and The Survivor.

The 1970s to 1980s saw the rise of the Second Independent Film Movement where the films produced contained more of the personal creativity of the filmmakers, and films became more ideological.

Independent films became highly politicized in the 1980s with the Marcos dictatorship and the People Power Revolution. The filmmakers of that time sought to innovate ways of expression for their political films as they deal with social reality. Some of the famous independent films of that time include Ang Magpakailanman, Children of the Regime, Revolutions Happen like Refrains in a Song, A Legacy of Violence, And Rain Fell in July, Sugat sa Ugat, The Arrogance of Power, Signos, Kalawang, Sa Maynila, Ynang Bayan: To be a Woman is to Live at a Time of War, I am a Furious Yellow, Perfumed Nightmare, Isang Munting Lupa, and Bayani.

Currently, there are a few Filipino film festivals that support independent Filipino films such as Cinemalaya and CineFilipino.&lt;ref&gt;Rex Baylon, "Cinemalaya 2015: A look at Philippine indie film history", Meniscus Magazine, September 17, 2015, , accessed July 07, 2017, http://www.meniscuszine.com/articles/2015090135906/cinemalaya-2015-a-look-at-philippine-indie-film-history/.&lt;/ref&gt; These are annual film festivals that screens, invests, promotes, and awards independent Filipino films.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Goh and Jasmine Ting, "Only Indie Philippines", The GUIDON, May 22, 2016, , accessed July 07, 2017, http://www.theguidon.com/1112/main/2016/05/indie-philippines-2/.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Internationally Acclaimed Films ==
Over the years, Filipino films have been recognized not only in their own country, but also globally in different countries. Competing with international films, Filipino films have earned many different rewards such as the [[Golden Lion]] in the 2016 [[Venice Film Festival]] won by ''[[The Woman Who Left|Ang Babaeng Humayo]]'' (''The Woman Who Left'') by [[Lav Diaz]], the Audience Choice Award in the [[Tokyo International Film Festival]] won by ''[[Die Beautiful]]'' by [[Jun Lana]], or the Silver Bear Alfred Bauer Prize at the [[66th Berlin International Film Festival]] won by ''[[Hele Sa Hiwagang Hapis|Hele sa Hiwagang Hapis]]'' (''A Lullaby to the Sorrowful Mystery'') also by Lav Diaz. All these films were granted these awards in the year of 2016 among many other Philippine films.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://primer.com.ph/blog/2016/12/29/list-filipino-films-that-made-it-internationally-this-2016/|title=List: Filipino films that made it internationally this 2016.|last=|first=|date=December 29, 2016|website=Philippine Primer|access-date=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years before, other films equally gaining recognition internationally include ''Pamilya Ordinaryo'' by Eduardo Roy Jr.;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''Toto'' by John Paul Su;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Trap (2015 film)|''Taklub'']] by Brillante Mendoza;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spot.ph/entertainment/movies-music-tv/63698/10-must-see-critically-acclaimed-pinoy-movies-2015|title=10 Must-See Critically Acclaimed Pinoy Movies of 2015|last=Dacanay|first=Aimee|date=September 24, 2015|website=SPOT.PH|access-date=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metro Manila (film)|''Metro Manila'']] by Sean Ellis;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.topten.ph/2016/02/28/must-watch-pinoy-indie-films/|title=Award Winning Pinoy Indie Films You Have to Watch|last=|first=|date=May 25, 2017|website=Pinoy Top Tens|access-date=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Foster Child (2007 film)|''Foster Child'']] by Brillante Mendoza.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/movies/1710/%7B%7Burl%7D%7D|title="Foster Child" wins Signis Award in Spain|last=Dimaculangan|first=Jocelyn|date=March 16, 2008|website=PEP.ph|access-date=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3688">{{about|the policy of screening people based on their appearance|the album from the indie rock duo Handsome Furs|Face Control}}

'''Face control''' refers to the policy of upscale [[nightclub]]s, casinos, restaurants and similar establishments to strictly restrict entry based on a [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]]'s snap judgment of the suitability of a person's looks, money, style or attitude, especially in [[Russia]] and other former Soviet countries such as [[Ukraine]]. The term "face control" comes from the fact that establishments are attempting to use exclusivity to preserve their public "face".

Although a similar "velvet rope" policy exists in other countries, aiming to admit the right mix of "beautiful people" and keep out boring or unattractive would-be patrons, the Russian version is considered particularly harsh and unforgiving by Western standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/style/tmagazine/27moscoww.html?pagewanted=all
|newspaper=New York Times |author=Joshua Yaffa |date=September 25, 2009 |title=Barbarians at the Gate |accessdate=August 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rare occasional use of this term in English can be considered a linguistic [[reborrowing]] via the Russian [[pseudo-anglicism]] фейсконтроль (''feiskontrol'').

==Admission standards==
Goscilo notes that, as the more upscale establishments are "temples of unbridled self-presentation-masquerading-as-pleasure," wealth is not enough to guarantee admission; a wealthy person who lacks the proper respect, culture, sartorial elegance, prettiness, or impressively expensive model car may nonetheless be denied admission. Face control, since it requires discernment, is considered an art, with Moscow only having about ten truly excellent face controllers. 

Some establishments only practice face control on Fridays and Saturdays, so customers unable to meet the bouncer's standards can come at other times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Goscilo, Helena|title=Celebrity and Glamour in Contemporary Russia|publisher=Routledge|date=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Moscow, stricter face control tends to be implemented as the evening progresses, so people can also avoid it by coming early for dinner, before the bouncers are posted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Let's Go Eastern Europe 13th Edition|author=Gustafson, Ingrid|date=27 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As foreigners are sometimes preferred, speaking English has also been noted as helpful in getting through face control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lonely Planet Eastern Europe|author=Averbuck, Alexis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simon Richmond advises, "Arrive in a small group, preferably with more men than women" and to smile to "Show the bouncer that you are going to enhance the atmosphere inside."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lonely Planet Russia|author=Richmond, Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''filí''' was a member of an elite class of [[Irish poetry|poets]] in Ireland, up until the [[English Renaissance|Renaissance]].

==Etymology==

The word "file" is thought to derive from the Proto-Celtic ''*widluios'', meaning "seer, one who sees" (attested on the Gaulish inscription from Larzac as "uidluias", which is the feminine genitive singular form), derived ultimately from the verb ''*widlu-'', "to see". This may suggest that the filí were originally prophetic poets, who foretold the future in the form of verse or riddle, rather than simply poets.

==Elite scholars==

According to the ''Textbook of Irish Literature'', by [[Eleanor Hull]]:

{{quote|The ''file'' is to be regarded as in the earliest times as combining in his person the functions of magician, lawgiver, judge, counsellor to the chief, and poet. Later, but still at a very early time, the offices seem to have been divided, the [[brehon law|brehons]] devoting themselves to the study of law, and the giving of legal decisions, the druids arrogating to themselves the supernatural functions, with the addition, possibly of some priestly offices, and the ''filí'' themselves being henceforth principally as poets and philosophers. The division seems to have already existed in Ireland at the time of St Patrick, whose preaching brought him into constant opposition with the druids, who were evidently, at that time, regarded as the religious leaders of the nation, though there does not seem to be much sign that they were, as they undoubtedly were, even at an earlier age in Britain and Gaul, sacrificing priests.}}

==Oral tradition==

The fili maintained an [[Oral literature|oral tradition]] that predated the [[Celtic Christianity|Christianisation]] of Ireland.  In this tradition, poetic and musical forms are important not only for [[aesthetics]], but also for their [[mnemonic]] value.  The tradition allowed plenty of room for improvisation and personal expression, especially in regard to creative [[hyperbole]] and clever [[kenning]].  However, the culture placed great importance on the fili's ability to pass stories and information down through the generations without making changes in those elements that were considered factual rather than embellishment.

In this manner, a significant corpus of pre-Christian [[Irish mythology|myth and epic literature]] remained largely intact many centuries into the Christian era.  Much of it was first recorded in writing by scholarly Christian [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|monks]].  The synergy between the rich and ancient indigenous oral literary tradition and the classical tradition resulted in an explosion of monastic literature that included epics of war, love stories, nature poetry, [[Hagiography|saint tales]] and so forth which collectively resulted in the largest corpus of non-Latin literature seen in Europe since [[Ancient Greece]].

==Decline==

The ultimate accommodation of Christianity within Irish Gaelic society resulted in a strain on the resources of the Chiefs and in that they were required to provide land and titles for both fili and bishop alike. Consequently, a decision was made in the 6th century to limit the number of fili to certain families who were respected and believed to be poets as a birthright. The greatest of these families included the [[Ó Dálaigh]] (O'Daly), several of whom were accorded the rank of 'chief [[ollamh]] of poetry of all Ireland,' and O'hUiginn (O'Higgins) who were hereditary filí in more than one Gaelic house such as O'Conor Slighit, The MacDermotts, The McDonagh and O'Doherty. The [[Ó Maolconaire|Ó Maol Chonaire]] were chiefly [[Ollamh Síol Muireadaigh|Ollamh]]s of the [[Síol Muireadaigh|Síol Muireadhaigh]], the [[Ó Conchubhair Donn]] and the [[MacDermot]] of [[Magh Luirg|Moylurg]], although this family was also associated with Ulster and spread from Connacht into the courts of Munster and Leinster. Finally the [[Ó Cléirigh]]s who served the O'Donnel chieftains of Tír Connell.

The hereditary poets that were a fixture of court life in [[History of Ireland|medieval Ireland]] serving as entertainers, advisors and [[genealogists]] maintained practices of and enjoyed a similar status as the pre-Christian fili.  But from the 12th century onwards, [[Norman Ireland|Anglo-Norman]] elements had increasing influence on Irish society. As [[Gaels|Gaelic]] culture waned, these folk became increasingly involved with written literature and such non-native traditions as [[heraldry]]. Nonetheless in Gaelic society the chief filí of the province, or [[Ollamh]], was seen as equal status to the Ard-rí, or High King. This high social status existed right into [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] times, when English nobility were horrified to see the Gaelic chieftains not just eating at the same table as their poets, but often from the same dish. Eventually [[classical literature]] and the [[Romance (heroic literature)|Romantic literature]] that grew from the [[troubadour]] tradition of the [[Southern France|langue d'oc]] superseded the material that would have been familiar to the ancient fili.

==Legacy==

Many manuscripts preserving the tales once transmitted by the fili have survived.  This literature contributes much to the modern understanding of [[druids]], [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic religion]] and the [[Celt|Celtic world]] in general.

Besides its value to historians, this canon has contributed a great deal to modern literature beginning with retellings by [[William Butler Yeats]] and other authors involved with the [[Celtic Revival]].  Soon after, [[James Joyce]] drew from material less explicitly.  Now [[fantasy literature]] and [[Fantasy art|art]] draws heavily from these tales and characters such as [[Cúchulainn]], [[Fionn mac Cumhaill|Finn McCool]] and the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]] are relatively familiar.

Through such traditional musicians as [[Turlough O'Carolan]] (who died in 1738 and is often lauded as "the last of the bards") and countless of his less-known or anonymous colleagues, the musical tradition of the fili has made its way to contemporary ears via artists such as [[Planxty]], [[The Chieftains]], and [[The Dubliners]].

In their subject matter and techniques, the [[seanachie]] are considered the inheritors of the ancient Irish tradition of oral literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The modern Irish and Scottish Gaelic words for "poet" are derived from ''fili''.

*[[Old Irish]]: '''fili''', plural '''filid'''
*Modern Irish: '''file''', plural '''filí'''
*[[Scottish Gaelic]]: '''filidh''', plural '''filidhean'''
* [[Manx Gaelic]]: '''feelee'''

Finally, practitioners of [[Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism]] are working to reconstruct trance and visionary techniques that were used by the ''filid'', such as ''[[imbas forosnai]]'' and aspects of the ''tarbhfeis'' ritual.

'''Henry Burr''' (January 15, 1882 – April 6, 1941) was a Canadian singer, radio performer and producer.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He was born '''Harry Haley McClaskey''' and used Henry Burr as one of his many pseudonyms, in addition to Irving Gillette, Henry Gillette, Alfred Alexander, Robert Rice, Carl Ely, Harry Barr, Frank Knapp, Al King, and Shamus McClaskey.&lt;ref name="ENC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0000490 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050520085326/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0000490 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-05-20 |title=Burr, Henry |author=Edward B. Moogk |publisher=Encyclopedia of Music in Canada }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://ccrma.stanford.edu/groups/edison/exhibit/exhibit.html|title = Exhibit of the Month: {{sic|nolink=y|Psuedonyms}} &amp; Those Who Used Them|publisher = Stanford University|date = December 6, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He produced more than 12,000 recordings, by his own estimate, including "Just a Baby's Prayer at Twilight", "[[Till We Meet Again (1918 song)|Till We Meet Again]]" with [[Albert Campbell (singer)|Albert Campbell]], "The Song That Stole My Heart Away", "M-O-T-H-E-R", and "[[Beautiful Ohio]]".&lt;ref name = "CC" /&gt; A tenor, he performed as a soloist and in duets, trios and quartets.

== Early years ==
[[File:McClaskeyHouseStStephenNB.jpg|thumb|left|Burr's childhood home in St. Stephen New Brunswick.]]Born in the border town of [[St. Stephen, New Brunswick]], Canada,&lt;ref name = "CC" &gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.collectionscanada.ca/gramophone/m2-1004-e.html|title = Henry Burr, tenor (1885-1941)|publisher = Collections Canada|date = 2007-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harry McClaskey was the son of a candy and tobacco store owner,&lt;ref name = "TG"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.gracyk.com/burr.shtml|title = Henry Burr|author = Tim Gracyk|year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A. A. McClaskey. His mother was the former Ida Connors and he was the youngest of four children.&lt;ref name = "DD" &gt;Doug Dougherty, ''St. Stephen - Yesteryear'', n. d. (ca 2000), St Stephen: Parsons Publishing company.&lt;/ref&gt; His vocal talents were recognized early and by the age of 5 he was performing publicly in St. Stephen. At age 10 he was the mascot for the Saint John Bicycle and Athletic Club in the nearby city of [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]], singing "Her Eyes Don't Shine Like Diamonds"&lt;ref name = "DD" /&gt; and at age 13 he was performing onstage as a boy tenor with the Artillery Band in Saint John.&lt;ref name = "CC" /&gt; The family had moved to Saint John by this time.&lt;ref name = "DD" /&gt; Perhaps doubting that he could make a career in music, he later attended [[Mount Allison University|Mt. Allison Academy]] in [[Sackville, New Brunswick]], and afterwards worked for his father. On April 14, 1901, he appeared at the opera house in Saint John in his first notable concert with the Scottish soprano [[Jessie MacLachlan]]. On September 30, 1901 he was discovered by the [[Metropolitan Opera]] baritone [[Giuseppe Campanari]] who was in Saint John to perform at the [[St. John Opera House]]. Campanari insisted that McClaskey go to New York for musical training.&lt;ref name = "TG" /&gt;

== Recording artist ==
[[File:Peerless Quartet c 1923.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Henry Burr and the Peerless Quartet, about 1923. ''From left to right:'' [[John H. Meyer]], Burr, [[Frank Croxton]], [[Albert Campbell (singer)|Albert Campbell]].]] Emboldened by Campanari's endorsement, McClaskey ventured to New York in 1902, where he began lessons and sang with the Grace Methodist Episcopal Church choir. He eventually rose to tenor soloist for the choir.&lt;ref name = "TG" /&gt; His teachers included [[John Dennis Meehan]] (or Mehan) and Kate Stella Burr, from whom he would adopt his stage name in her honor.&lt;ref name = "CC" /&gt;

It was around 1902 that he started to make recordings with [[Columbia Records]] and he used the name Henry Burr at that time. He arrived at a particularly opportune time for Columbia, as their star tenor, [[George J. Gaskin]], was in the final years of his career.&lt;ref name = "TG" /&gt; Burr started recording for [[Edison Records]] in November 1904 under the name Irving Gillette.&lt;ref name = "TG" /&gt; Disagreements with company executives resulted in his no longer recording for Edison after October 1914.&lt;ref name = "TG" /&gt; He first recorded with [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor]] on January 4, 1905, and the recordings were released that March.&lt;ref name = "TG" /&gt; On April 7, 1905 he recorded [[Egbert Van Alstyne]]'s "[[In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree]]" which proved to be popular.&lt;ref name = "TG" /&gt; It was also recorded by [[Billy Murray (singer)|Billy Murray]] the same year. Burr proved to be a successful artist, recording thousands of songs for various labels under various names. He would record with [[Leeds Talk-O-Phone]] and the [[American Record Company]] as well.&lt;ref name = "TG" /&gt;  His recordings also appear on International Record Company and department store labels such as [[Vim Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.78discography.com/IRC.htm |title=International Record Company |last1=LaBoissonniere |first1=Guy |last2=Settlemier |first2=Tyrone|date=February 24, 2016 |website= |publisher=The Online Discographical Project |access-date=December 16, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collaborations ===
In 1906, Burr joined the Columbia Male Quartet, which was recording for the [[Columbia Record Company]], as second tenor under the management of [[Frank C. Stanley]].&lt;ref name = "ENC" /&gt; They were later renamed the Peerless Quartet when they moved to the Victor label. When Stanley died in 1910,&lt;ref name = "TG" /&gt; Burr took over management of the group.&lt;ref name = "CC" /&gt; It continued on as a popular recording and live group (with various personnel and name changes over the years) until 1928, when it disbanded.&lt;ref name = "ENC" /&gt; Burr was also a member of the [[Metropolitan Trio]] and the [[Manhattan Mixed Trio]], both of which featured him with [[Frank C. Stanley]] and [[Elise Stevenson]].&lt;ref name = "TG" /&gt; In 1921, he contributed music to a summertime review called ''The Broadway Whirl.''&lt;ref&gt;''Playbill'' Vault, [http://www.playbillvault.com/Person/Detail/17312/Henry-Burr Henry Burr Broadway Theater credits]&lt;/ref&gt;

Burr recorded in a duo with [[Albert Campbell (singer)|Albert Campbell]]. The pair had a succession of hits between 1911 and 1925, including "[[The Trail of the Lonesome Pine (song)|The Trail of the Lonesome Pine]]" (1913); "[[Till We Meet Again (1918 song)|Till We Meet Again]]" (1919); and "[[I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles]]" (1919).&lt;ref name="whitburn memories"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Whitburn | first1 = Joel| title = Pop Memories 1890-1954: The History of American Popular Music| location = Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin| publisher = Record Research, Inc. | year= 1986| pages = 69–70| isbn = 0-89820-083-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== As a businessman ==
By 1915, he was in a comfortable position financially, and he began to seek ways to invest his money. That year, he formed the Paroquette Record Manufacturing Company with [[Fred Van Eps]], based in New York City. The Paroquette system used vertical cut records and featured his own recordings and those of several other performers. As a novel introduction in a highly competitive market, the Paroquette recording technique was an early failure, and the company was out of business by 1917.&lt;ref name = "CC" /&gt; Burr also tried music publishing, and he also shared ownership in a [[banjo]] factory with Van Eps for a short while.&lt;ref name = "TG" /&gt;

== Early radio ==
[[File:Henry Burr.jpg|thumb|200px|Burr with microphone.]]Burr performed live on the [[radio]] while broadcasting technology was still in its infancy. He made his first appearance in 1920 in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]] using a microphone improvised from a wooden bowl with an inverted telephone transmitter.&lt;ref name = "TG" /&gt; The broadcast was heard as far west as [[San Francisco]]. Burr is also credited with making the first transcontinental 'broadcast' by singing into the telephone in New York and being heard by diners wearing headphones at a [[Rotary club|Rotary]] dinner in California. Also in 1920, he signed an exclusive contract with Victor that lasted seven years. A lucrative contract, it made him (for a time) a wealthy man.

By the late 1920s, Burr's recording career was over. [[Electrical recording]] technologies had encouraged the [[crooner]] style of tenor vocals, as in the singing of [[Gene Austin]] and [[Al Bowlly]]. The commercial potential of radio continued to interest Burr. He became involved in programming, forming Henry Burr, Inc. in 1928 as a producer.&lt;ref name = "CC" /&gt; He produced numerous programs for commercial radio networks into the 1930s. He originated the [[Cities Service Company|Cities Service]] broadcast, which he produced for two years.

In October 1929, he reportedly lost a substantial portion of his wealth in the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].&lt;ref name = "TG" /&gt; Within a month, however, he was appointed Director of the Artist's Bureau at [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]] which had just been organized under the ownership of [[William S. Paley]].

Around 1935, he returned to performing on the radio as a member of the [[WLS (AM)|WLS Chicago]] ''[[National Barn Dance]]'' troupe, which was broadcast over [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] on Saturday evenings. He soon became a featured performer on the show, which he stayed with for five years until shortly before his death.

==Death==
He suffered from [[throat cancer]] and died in [[Chicago, Illinois]] on April 6, 1941.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Henry Burr, Noted As Ballad Singer.

==Cultural references==
Although Burr is rarely heard today in mainstream musical culture, his 1922 rendition of "My Buddy" was used on the soundtrack of a ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]'' episode, originally broadcast on October 8, 2012 (Season 3, Episode 4, "Blue Bell Boy").

Notably, in the 1960s, the famous ukulele-playing singer [[Tiny Tim (musician)|Tiny Tim]] frequently played Burr songs on stage and on such programs as ''The Johnny Carson Show''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark (interviewer)|first=Ernie|title=TINY TIM, A LOOK BACK:|url=http://www.tinytim.org/interview.html|work=Remembering Tiny tim|accessdate=8 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010044547/http://tinytim.org/interview.html|archivedate=10 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burr's 1915 recording of "There's a Little Spark of Love Still Burning" was used on [[Ernie Kovacs]]' ''Eugene'' special in 1960, and possibly on other Kovacs programs as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erniekovacs.info/Kchusid.html Irwin Chusid, "Kovacs on Music"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==

Tom Forester is an american man from Cleveland, Ohio, who wants to become a pilot as his father (who fought in WWI against the germans in the Lafayette Esquadrille) as the WWII begins. He manages to be accepted in the No 79th squadron RAF which is sent to Western Alps, France. Forester meets Clifford Stone, his squadron leader and they soon become friends. During the training and their scout with their Hawker Hurricanes they find a formation of six Ju-88 German bombers, which are all downed by Forester before the arrival of three Me-109 German fighters, but they are all hit by Tom which go through the scout and finds two more Messerschmitt fighters: one is downed by Stone with an "Ace Hit" and Forester manages to do the same. Later, they keep on they scout mission and find three german convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles, which are all destroyed by Forester before the arrival of four Me-109 fighters (one of whom is an ace pilot) which are too shot down by Forester using Ace Hits all times. After the destruction of the last enemy aircraft the two pilots both come back to the air base.
After the conquest of France, the No 79th Squadron is sent back to England, operating from Biggin Hill air base, south of London. One month later Stone and Forester are sent in a CAP mission along the south coast. After a new of a spotting of a german plane, the two pilots reach a convoy. As they turn to get back to the coast, they are attacked by a Me-109 fighter and five Me-110 light bombers which try to sink the three merchant ships of the convoy. All the germans are downed, but soon afterwards a flight of german Ju-87 "Stuka" dive-bombers attack the Allied oil and fuel tanks in the Dover's port. Another three flights of five Stukas each are destroyed by Forester who soon destroys several naval mines to make three merchant ships reach the port undamaged. The RDF stations later detect two formations of german Ju-88 and Do-17 bombers which are destroyed by Forester. AFter destroyen the bombers,Forester intercept the last enemy fighters helping Stone to destroy them all. The mission ends with both pilots coming back to base.

The next mission focus on another pilot: Danny Miller, a british man from Liverpool who entered the RAF as the war began. In his first mission, Miller has to intercept a flight of six Me-110 heavy fighters deployed as an escort for He-111 bombers which are going to arrive on the town of London to bomb it. After shooting down the six enemies, Miller attacks an entire group of dozens of enemy He-111 bombers. The player can destroy however many bombers they like, but the bombers will still reach the House of Parliament the mission will end and the bombers will drop their bombs on the Parliament and the Big Ben. The mission is later revealed to be a dream sequence

The third mission returns to Forester and Stone on the day of Adlertag, when the Luftwaffe bombed the british air bases: the duo are the only pilots able to take off and intercept the following waves of Heinkel He-111 bombers, shooting them down. at the same pilot, Forester has to destroy two Me-109 fighters which are attacking an observetion station. After the german planes are destroyed, the Allied pilots fly to Lympne air base and find it under attack from a squadron of twelve german Bf-109 which are strafing the british Spitfires of the No 610th Squadron. Then, a control call tells Forester that an unauthorised aircraft is trying to reach the English Channel, but the plane is later damaged to one engine by Forester with an "Ace Hit". After that, all the British planes reach Dover and attack the German formations of Bf-109 fighters, before the arrival of german bombers from inland. All the German planes are detroyed, and Forester returns to base with Stone and Wandsworth, a new friend of the No 610th Squadron.

'''Hlípa''' is a 1989 video game developed by two developers from Prague. It is a maze game which is considered to be the most complex game for [[PMD 85]]. The game was later ported to [[Atari ST]] and [[Sharp MZ]].&lt;ref name=Root&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tišnovský|first1=Pavel|title=Československé osmibitové počítače: aplikace a emulátory PMD 85|url=http://www.root.cz/clanky/ceskoslovenske-osmibitove-pocitace-aplikace-a-emulatory-pmd-85/|website=Root.cz|accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The game was create in 1989 by Karel Šuhajda. The idea of the game came from a discussion with his girlfriend in which he mentioned a word ''Hlípa'' as a possibility to be a shortening of words ''hlídané parkoviště'' (guarded parking). He later realised tha Hlípa could be some kind of amoeba. He decided to make a game about this creature. As an inspiration he had his older game 3D-Mikrotron and [[Knight Lore]]. He was helped by his friend Tomáš Švec who made a design of the game world consisting of 256 areas. Šuhajda created the programming and wrote a story. The game was programmed in DAM [[Assembler language|Assembler]]. The game was finished in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Švelch|first1=Jaroslav|title=Volné chvíle s PMD 85: Jak vznikaly hry pro nejznámější československý osmibit|url=http://games.tiscali.cz/tema/volne-chvile-s-pmd-85-jak-vznikaly-hry-pro-nejznamejsi-ceskoslovensky-osmibit-246389|website=Games.cz|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Šuhajda started to work on a port for Sharp MZ-800 after the release of Hlípa for PMD-85. He decided to make the game colourful as the original version was black-and-white. The problem was that he had only a monochrome monitor and had to guess the setting of colours. He later admitted that he guessed these colours unsuccessfully. The Sharp MZ Version was released in 1990. In 1992 the game was released for Atari ST with better set of colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krupkaj|first1=Jan|title=České hry Hry pro Atari ST|url=http://www.atariportal.cz/article_detail.php?itmid=9000012|website=Atari Portal.cz|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KAREL ŠUHAJDA - ROZHOVOR|url=http://mz-800.xf.cz/rozhovor_ks.htm|website=MZ-800.xf.cz|accessdate=16 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot and Gameplay ==
[[File:Hlipa-pmd85.png|150px|thumbnail|The Beginning of the game. Hlípa can be seen in the middle. The thing moving around is Sivram. Ploxons can be seen in corners.]]
The game follows a member of Hlípa nation. Hlípas are some kind of [[amoeba]]. Their homeworld is a planet Danepa. They have to face another nation – Sivrams. There are two kinds of Sivrams. The first ones are not very smart but working Falmons while the other ones are intelligent but moveless Ploxons. If a Falmon touch Hlípa, he dries his body and kills him. On the other hand, if Hlípa touches Ploxon he breaks up. Hlípas decide to get rid of Ploxons who control the nation of Sivrams. The protagonist is smuggled to the capital of Sivrams deep in underground. There he has to find 6 ruling Ploxons and kill them but the whole city is a huge complex of corridors and finding Ploxons is a very hard task.&lt;ref name=Narsil&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rous|first1=Karel|title=Hlípa|url=http://www.oldgames.sk/mag/narsil-4/page/10/|accessdate=29 June 2014|work=Narsil|publisher=Empty Head|date=1 April 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the player completes the task and kills the last of Ploxons, Hlípa disappears and is seen with a crown on head while standing on a platform resembling a throne. A text is seen congratulating the player and saying that the heroic act of the Hlípa shall be remembered by nation of Hlípas. When the Hlípa dies, its body will be spilt into a crystal bottle.

The game uses 3D isometric graphics with sophisticated animations. The player controls a character of Hlípa and has to find 6 crowns that represent Ploxons. He has to avoid Falmons who kill him. He can also use a complex system of canals. If player leaves Hlípa alone for a few moments it starts to run around by itself which can cause much trouble to the player.&lt;ref name="Borik"/&gt;

== Trivia ==
*The basic design of the opening screen was made by Vlastimil Veselý from ''VBG Software''.
*The game is inspired by [[Knight Lore]].&lt;ref name=ames.cz&gt;{{cite web|last1=Švelch|first1=Jaroslav|title=Vítejte v klubu - Kde se v normalizačním Československu scházeli počítačoví nadšenci?|url=http://games.tiscali.cz/tema/vitejte-v-klubu-kde-se-v-normalizacnim-ceskoslovensku-schazeli-pocitacovi-nadsenci-64408|website=Games.cz|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Payouts are based on traditional [[pari-mutuel]] processes.&lt;ref name=courierpress/&gt; The player's wager is divvied up into several "betting pools" for different winning possibilities, such as picking the winner of the race, picking the top three finishers in exact order, or any of the three selections finishing first and second.&lt;ref name=oag&gt;{{cite report|title=OAG 10-001: Instant Racing|publisher=Kentucky Office of the Attorney General|date=January 5, 2010|url=http://ag.ky.gov/civil/opinions/2010/oag10001.doc|pages=2–4|accessdate=2013-10-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604192350/http://ag.ky.gov/civil/opinions/2010/OAG10001.doc|archivedate=2013-06-04|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The machine then shows a video replay of all or a portion of the race. If the player achieved a particular type of "win", he receives the money from that pool, while the money in each of the other pools continues to accumulate until another bettor wins it.&lt;ref name=oag/&gt;

Early versions of Instant Racing terminals closely resembled self-serve wagering terminals.&lt;ref name=patton/&gt; Some later terminals began to mimic slot machines, with symbols on spinning reels corresponding to the results of the player's wager, and the video of the race occupying only a 2-inch square in the corner of the display.&lt;ref name=patton/&gt;

==History==
The idea of historical race wagering was conceived by Eric Jackson, general manager of [[Oaklawn Park]]. He brought the idea to three major companies in January 1997, but found no takers. Later in the year, he met with Ted Mudge, president of [[AmTote]], who liked the idea and asked Jackson to present it to experts at a February 1998 racing industry gathering in Maryland.

'''Keshet Media Group''', also known as '''Keshet''' (Hebrew: קשת, lit. "Rainbow"), is a private Israeli [[mass media]] company, which is headquartered in [[Tel Aviv]].&lt;ref name=bloomberg&gt;{{cite web| title=Dick Clark Productions Forms Venture With Israel’s Keshet| author=Christopher Palmeri| date=2 October 2013| publisher=Bloomberg| accessdate=12 February 2015| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-10-02/dick-clark-productions-forms-venture-with-israel-s-keshet-1-}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company has operated Keshet Broadcasting, a television broadcast operator and a franchisee of Israel’s [[Channel 2 (Israel)|Channel 2]], since 1993 and up until November 2017. Since November 2017's licensing reform, it was rebranded in Israel as [[Keshet 12]], a separate channel.

Keshet shows original drama series, entertainment, current affairs, lifestyle shows, and foreign programs. Keshet’s global production and distribution arm is Keshet International,&lt;ref name="billboard" /&gt; and the company's digital branch is Mako, one of the top three most-visited websites in [[Israel]].&lt;ref name="variety" /&gt;

Keshet was established in 1993 and is one of Israel's largest media companies.&lt;ref name=bloomberg/&gt; [[Avi Nir]] has been serving as the [[chief executive officer]] of Keshet Media Group since 2002.&lt;ref name=hreport/&gt; As a leading network in Israel, Keshet is responsible for shows including ''[[Prisoners of War (TV series)|Prisoners of War]]'' (Hatufim) and ''[[Rising Star (TV series)|Rising Star]]'' (Hacokav haba).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title='Rising Star': Stakes Are High For Creator Keshet International| author=David Caspi| date=20 June 2014| publisher=Billboard| accessdate=12 February 2015|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/6128660/rising-star-keshet-international}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History ==
Keshet was founded in 1993 when Israel’s [[Channel 2 (Israel)|Channel 2]] was formed along with two other operators, [[Telad]] and [[Reshet]].&lt;ref name=vp3&gt;{{cite web| date=26 May 1993| title=Israel announces first commercial TV station| publisher=Variety| accessdate=8 February 2015|url=https://variety.com/1993/tv/news/israel-announces-first-commercial-tv-station-107224/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was started by Alex Gilady, the current president of Keshet&lt;ref name=mus24&gt;{{cite web| title=Music 24| publisher=Keshet Media Group| accessdate=8 February 2015|url=http://www.keshetmediagroup.com/our-properties/channels/24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a former vice president at NBC International in London.&lt;ref name=v95&gt;{{cite web| date=8 May 1995| title=Second Channel exec ankles| publisher=Variety| accessdate=8 February 2015| url=https://variety.com/1995/scene/markets-festivals/second-channel-exec-ankles-99127463/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first drama series Keshet produced was in 1996 called ''Bat Yam, New York''. That same year, Channel 2 became the most watched channel in Israel.&lt;ref name=variety&gt;{{cite web| url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/news/keshet-two-decades-of-evolution-1200682870/| title=Keshet: Two Decades of Evolution| author=Debra Kamin| date=2 October 2013| publisher=Variey| accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''What a Wonderful Country'' (''[[Eretz Nehederet]]''), a TV series similar to [[Saturday Night Live]], aired its first season in 2003 and has since become one of the most popular shows on Israeli TV.&lt;ref name=nyt14&gt;{{cite web| date=1 February 2014| title=A Wonderful Country| author=Thomas L.

In 2005, a committee formed by the [[Second Israeli Broadcasting Authority]] selected two of the three operators to run the next phase of Channel 2, one of only two channels allowed to run commercials. Keshet came first and was awarded four broadcasting days per week.

==Notable productions==
===Television===
*''[[HaAh HaGadol|Big Brother]] (season 1-8)'' – Keshet and Kuperman productions aired the Israeli version of ''Big Brother'' ten years after the show debuted on worldwide TV. The show became a phenomenon, topping the charts for 16 weeks in a row and averaging a 31% share of ratings. Keshet also aired a celebrity ''Big Brother VIP'' season 1 &amp; 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |script-title=he:הכנסות קשת מ"האח הגדול": כ-76 מיליון שקל |author=Ayala Tzoref |author2=Amitai Ziv |url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/1.1368096 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=18 December 2008 |accessdate=29 September 2012 |language=Hebrew |trans-title=Keshet makes 76 Million NIS out of first Big Brother Season}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Polishuk'' – An Israeli version of ''[[The Thick Of It]]'', first aired in 2009. Scripted and directed by the playwright [[Shmuel Hasfari]], the show tells the story of a politically clueless man (Rubi Polishuck, played by Academy Award winner [[Sasson Gabai]]), who entered politics almost by accident, but becomes the minister of Social Services when a scandal in his party forces the resignation of the previous minister.
*''[[Prisoners of War (TV series)|Hatufim]]'' – A drama about two POW who are released from prison in Lebanon and have to find their way back into society and a normal life while accepting all the changes that have happened in the lives of their loved ones. Directed by Gidi Raff and sold to [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], it has been adapted into ''[[Homeland (TV series)|Homeland]]'' for [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |script-title=he:"חטופים" נמכרה לארה"ב |author=Yuni Perth |url=http://www.mako.co.il/entertainment-tv-media/tv/Article-47c186313927521004.htm&amp;sCh=3d385dd2dd5d4110&amp;pId=237936823 |publisher=mako.co.il |date=9 December 2009 |accessdate=29 September 2012 |language=Hebrew |trans-title="Hatufim" sold to U.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Ramzor]]'' (Hebrew for "Stoplight") – A comedy drama starring, and written by, [[Adir Miller]] and Asaf Sarig dealing with relationship issues from the point of view of three men, each in a different phase of relationship from single (green), to a steady relationship (yellow), to married (red). Each gives a different comedic interpretation of the terms of relationships between men and women.

[[Guinness World Records]] lists him as the fastest and most prolific in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Most prolific quick change illusion artist|url = http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/12000/most-prolific-quick-change-illusion-artist/|accessdate = 2015-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; His last one-man show has been seen by more than two million people worldwide. The changing of his tailcoat from black to white live and close to public was a method invented by him and is considered his artistic signature.
His wardrobe consists of more than 350 costumes but evolves show by show. His performances often involve  a series of characters, played consecutively one after the other, or in spoken sketches in which he plays all the roles interacting with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brachetti.com |title=Arturo Brachetti Website |publisher=Brachetti.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 he was awarded the [[Molière Award]], the highest accolade in French theatre, for "The Man with 1000 Faces," where he performs 80 different characters in a two-hour show. The show sold out in Paris for several months in Theatre Marigny, Theatre Mogador, Casino de Paris, from April 2000 to January 2005.
Brachetti has created and performed about 25 acts for television and 10 plays, produced by the National Theatre of Italy. The festival "Juste Pour Rire" launched his career in North America. In the Opera field he created a personal version of [[L'Histoire du soldat]] by [[Stravinsky]], "Peter and the Wolf" by [[Prokofiev]] and "Allegro, un po' troppo" with the Symphonic Orchestra of Rai Radio Televisione Italiana. 
In 2009 he was nominated for the [[Laurence Olivier Award]] in London for the show "Change" at the Garrick Theatre. He returned to Paris in 2009 at the Folies Bergere with his new show about Cinema. 
In 2011, the French Ministry of Culture presented him with the honorary title of [[Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres]] Knight of Arts and Letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = La chanson, la scène et la télévision à l’honneur - Histoire du ministère - Ministère de la Culture et de la Communication|url = http://www.culturecommunication.gouv.fr/Ministere/Histoire-du-ministere/Ressources-documentaires/Discours/Discours-de-ministres-depuis-1999/Frederic-Mitterrand-2009-2012/Articles-2009-2012/La-chanson-la-scene-et-la-television-a-l-honneur|website = www.culturecommunication.gouv.fr|accessdate = 2015-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of television stations in Indonesia'''. For 27 years, Indonesians could only watch one television channel, [[TVRI]]. In 1989 the government finally allowed [[RCTI]] to broadcast as the first private television station in Indonesia, although only people who have a satellite dish and decoder could watch it.

==Free-to-air==
Free-to-air television stations and networks in Indonesia can be received by using a [[UHF]]/[[VHF]] antenna. Since the enactment of ''UU Penyiaran No. 32/2002'' (Broadcasting Act No. 32/2002), terrestrial television broadcasts licences are granted only to local television stations. Any television entities that wish to broadcast nationally must affiliate with other local stations.

MAAC is responsible for instituting official policies and regulations and guidelines. This includes radio frequencies, noise restrictions, and flying clubs. They organize flying events across Canada, and provide [[liability insurance]] coverage to its members.

MAAC produces a magazine, [[Model Aviation Canada]], which is included in the yearly membership fees, containing regional reports from elected zone directors, articles and model reviews from around the country.

MAAC offers guidelines for the Wings program, teaching beginners how to safely operate an aircraft.

== History ==
[[File:Music Circus rehearsal.jpg|left|thumb|Rehearsal of "Showboat" at Sacramento Music Circus 2001]]
Actor and adventurer St. John Terrell was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. He started in show business with a carnival act and later starred on the radio show ''Jack Armstrong, All American Boy''. Referred to as "Sinjun", he served in the Philippines with the USO. When a visiting touring company of an Irving Berlin musical needed performing space, Terrell suggested bulldozing a large pit for a stage in the center and audience on sloping and rising seating all around covered by a tent. This became the genesis to his original New Jersey Music Circus in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The music went 'round and around: the story of Musicarnival | last=Vacha | first=John | publisher = Kent State Univ Pr|year = May 2004 | pages = 9' | isbn=978-0-87338-798-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although rejected by the USO, he used his back pay, war bonds and loans after the war, to do it himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Billy Rose presents-- Casa Mañana | last=Jones | first=Jan | publisher = Texas Christian University Press|year = April 1, 1999| pages = 158 | isbn=9780875652016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by Greek [[amphitheater]]s, audience members sat in folding chairs no further back than 15 or 16 rows. Although a full orchestra was used, the sets were simple and low to keep sight lines clear. Props were carried on and off by stagehands, in clear view, running up and down aisles. Within 8 years, 30 separate canvas-topped theatres had opened in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title =Renegades, showmen &amp; angels: a theatrical history of Fort Worth from 1873-2001| last=Jones | first=Jan | publisher = Texas Christian University Press|year = June 29, 2006 | pages = 218 | isbn=978-0-87565-318-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

St. John Terrell's Music Circus was an instant success, and launched a wide variety of copycats, with 40 "tune tents" scattered around the country, including [[Cape Cod]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Miami]], [[Florida]] and [[Sacramento]], [[California]]. While the modern musical theatre genre was being developed on Broadway by the likes of [[Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein]] and [[Lerner &amp; Loewe]], the product being produced by most summer stocks remained primarily older works.  The first Lambertville season included ''[[The Merry Widow]]'', ''[[The Desert Song]]'' and ''[[The Chocolate Soldier]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lambertville-music-circus.org/seasons/1949.html lambertville-music-circus.org] - 1949 Season&lt;/ref&gt; but nothing from the contemporary Broadway canon. As modern [[musical theatre]] works became more popular, music circus producers incorporated more of the contemporary works and fewer light operas.

[[Broadway Sacramento|Broadway Sacramento's]] Broadway At Music Circus' 10-show season in 1951 included newer works ''[[Brigadoon (musical)|Brigadoon]]'', ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'', and the seminal ''[[Show Boat]]''. Slowly, the population of music circus theatres around the country diminished, with Terrell's big top folding in 1970. As of 2001, only three theatres of the original design still remained: Broadway At Music Circus ([[Sacramento, California]]), South Shore Music Circus ([[Cohasset, Massachusetts]]), and the Melody Tent ([[Hyannis, Massachusetts]], on Cape Cod), the latter two venues no longer producing musical theatre, but serving as concert sites. In 2002, Terrell's open air music circus model ceased to exist as Broadway At Music Circus lowered its canvas tent for the last time to make way for a new enclosed theatre-in-the-round—the [[Wells Fargo Pavilion]].  As a nod to history, the new arena theatre was still topped by fabric—a [[Teflon]]-coated fiberglass fabric manufactured by BirdAir.[[File:Music Circus Tent.jpg|thumb|The Sacramento Music Circus Tent in 2001]]

Voodoo".&lt;ref name=mum&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Dan|title=Magic Moments: The Bruce and Kitty Spangler Story|url=http://www.sammagiccenter.com/images/MUM_May_2014_-_The_Spanglers.pdf|accessdate=11 May 2015|work=M-U-M Magazine|publisher=Society of American Magicians|date=May 2014|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harry Anderson popularized the trick in the 1980s, performing it on television on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1982&lt;ref name=snl /&gt; and selling his own version of the trick.

==Presentation==
In presentation, the magician produces a [[hat pin]], roughly ten inches long, and demonstrates that it is sharp by using it to pop a balloon.  He then proceeds to [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilize]] the underside of his [[forearm]] with alcohol and, holding his arm so that it is not facing the audience, insert the needle through the skin of his arm.  From the audience's perspective, this is not very impressive until the magician lowers his arm for the audience to see.  The needle appears to pass about two inches under the skin.  The new wound then appears to bleed, with the blood dripping down the magician's arm.  The needle can be slid back and forth through the wound.  After the needle is removed, the magician cleans his arm which can be offered for inspection.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/82/82charry.phtml|title=SNL Transcripts: Ron Howard: 10/09/82: Harry Anderson|work=jt.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==
The needle-through-arm effect uses a gimmicked needle and [[stage blood]] as well as a small quantity of adhesive, such as [[rubber cement]] or [[spirit gum]]. The bead at the end of the hat pin is hollow and made of rubber so that it can hold a small amount of stage blood. The needle is hollow and has a small hole in its side through which the "blood" can flow.
   
When the magician appears to sterilize their arm, they actually coat their arm with a thin film of adhesive. When the magician is supposedly inserting the needle through the arm, they actually fold up two sides of skin over the needle that will stick to each other, forming a channel of skin that the needle can pass under. The stage blood flowing out of the needle lubricates the "wound" so that it can be slid back and forth.&lt;ref name=wiseguy /&gt;

'''''Old Jews Telling Jokes''''' is a [[web series]]&lt;ref&gt;Old Jew Telling Jokes (web series) http://www.oldjewstellingjokes.com&lt;/ref&gt; launched in 2009 created and directed by Sam Hoffman and produced by Eric Spiegelman and Tim Williams for Jetpack Media, Inc. It has since gone on to garner millions of unique views over several original series shot in places like New York, Los Angeles and Boca Raton.

In 2010 OJTJ was published as a paperback book by Villard. Written by Sam Hoffman with Eric Spiegelman, it is subtitled ''5000 Years of Funny Bits and Not-So-Kosher Laughs." ''Its chapters consist of jokes and humorous anecdotes contributed by several Jewish personalities, including [[Ed Koch]], [[Norman Stiles]], [[John Pleshette]] and [[Annie Korzen]]. In the introduction Hoffman says his book "categorized the jokes into chapters, roughly tracing the trajectory of the Jewish experience in America".
''
In addition to the book, the OJTJ series has also been distributed on [http://firstrunfeatures.com/oldjewstellingjokesdvd.html DVD], as two audio books ([http://www.highbridgeaudio.com/oldjewstellingjokes.html narrative] and [http://www.highbridgeaudio.com/jokeoff.html "the joke-off"]), a successful [[BBC Four]] television series &lt;ref&gt;Old Jews Telling Jokes (BBC Four series) http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b017j7vs&lt;/ref&gt; and was named one of the Top 5 podcasts on iTunes in 2010.

In 2011 OJTJ won an [http://www.bookreporter.com/features/awards/the-audie-awards-2011 Audie Award] for Humor.

In May 2012, OJTJ opened as an [http://www.telecharge.com/behindTheCurtain.aspx off-broadway play] at the Westside Theater.

The BBC adapted the format for [[Some People With Jokes]].

'''Retailtainment''' is [[retail]] marketing as [[entertainment]]. In his book, ''Enchanting a Disenchanted World: Revolutionizing the Means of Consumption'' (1999), author [[George Ritzer]] describes "retailtainment" as the "use of ambience, emotion, sound and activity to get customers interested in the merchandise and in a mood to buy."&lt;ref&gt;Ritzer, George, ''Enchanting a Disenchanted World: Revolutionizing the Means of Consumption''&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes called "inspirational retailing" or "entertailing,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.babsoninsight.com/contentmgr/showdetails.php/id/703 Babson Insight: Fun is Serious Business—Particularly for Mature “Neutral” Service Firms&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; it has also been defined as "the modern trend of combining shopping and entertainment opportunities as an anchor for customers."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.skoupy.net/pdf/research_on_retailing.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Codeluppi described it as a way for marketers to "offer the consumer physical and emotional sensations during the shopping experience." And, in an article entitled "Using sonic branding in the retail environment" in the 2003 issue of the ''Journal of Consumer Behavior'', Fulberg described it as a way for retailers to entertain the consumer with a dramatization of their values."

According to Michael Morrison at the Australian Centre for Retail Studies:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“There is a move towards the concept of 'retailtainment.' This phenomenon, which brings together retailing, entertainment, music and leisure ... Retailers need to look further than the traditional retail store elements such as colour, lighting and visual merchandising to influence buying decisions. The specific atmosphere the retailer creates can, in some cases, be more influential in the decision-making process than the product itself. As goods and services become more of a commodity, it is what a shopper experiences and what atmosphere retailers create that really matters. Brand building is a combination of physical, functional, operational and psychological elements. Consumers will be willing to pay more for a brand if there is a perceived or actual added value from their experience of using the product or service.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bandt.com.au/news/12/0c01e712.asp A touch of the theatre to add the ‘wow’ factor&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shopper marketing expert Simon Temperley of Los Angeles agency [[The Marketing Arm]], formerly U.S. Marketing &amp; Promotions (Usmp), describes "retailtainment" as a "live brand experience" that frequently includes the use of "brand ambassadors" who "converse with the consumer."&lt;ref&gt;[http://promomagazine.com/mag/marketing_hired_fans/ Hired Fans&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2863">A '''song plugger''' or '''song demonstrator''' was a vocalist or piano player employed by department and music stores and song publishers in the early 20th century to promote and help sell new sheet music, which is how hits were advertised before good quality recordings were widely available. Music publisher [[Frank Harding]] has been credited with innovating the sales method.&lt;ref name=museum&gt; [http://www.museumofmakingmusic.org/gallery1/popularmusic ''Tin Pan Alley''] &lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the pianist sat on the [[Mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine level]] of a store and played whatever music was sent up to him by the clerk of the store selling the sheet music. Patrons could select any title, have it delivered to the song plugger, and get a preview of the tune before buying it.

Although the terms are often used interchangeably, those who worked in department and music stores were most often known as "song demonstrators", while those who worked directly for music publishers were called "song pluggers."

Musicians and  composers who had worked as song pluggers included [[George Gershwin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gershwinfan.com/George.html | title = George Gershwin Biography | accessdate = 6 Jun 2013 | author = ComposerFan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ron Roker]], [[Jerome Kern]] and [[Lil Hardin Armstrong]].

== Modern usage ==
Later, the term was used to describe individuals who would pitch new music to performers, with ''[[The New York Times]]'' describing such examples as [[Freddy Bienstock]] performing a job in which he was "pitching new material to bandleaders and singers".&lt;ref&gt;Sisario, Ben. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/24/arts/music/24bienstock.html "Freddy Bienstock, Who Published Elvis Presley Hits, Dies at 86"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 24, 2009. Accessed September 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952 Ernest Havemann wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt; There are about 600 song-pluggers in the U.S.; they have their own union; they are powerful enough to bar all outsiders; and they command fees up to $35,000 a year (worth ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|35000|1952}}}} today) plus unlimited expense accounts. Their job is to persuade the record companies to use songs, put out by their publishing houses, and the radio station disk jockeys to play the records."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Fine Art of the Hit Tune|journal=LIFE Magazine|date=Dec 8, 1952|volume=33|issue=23|author=Ernest Havemann|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Song plugging remains an important part of the industry. Record labels and managers will actively search for songs that their artist can record, release and perform, especially those who don't write their own material.

'''''The Matrix''''' is a [[science fiction]] [[action film|action]] [[media franchise]] created by [[The Wachowski Brothers]]&lt;!--Credited as "The Wachowski Brothers". Do not change without consensus. See [[Talk:The Matrix#"The Wachowskis" vs "The Wachowski Brothers"]]. --&gt;, about heroes who fight a desperate war against machine overlords that have enslaved humanity in an extremely sophisticated [[virtual reality]] system. The series is most notable for its two uses of slow motion, which revolutionized action films to come. 

The series began with the feature film ''[[The Matrix]]'' (1999), and continued with two sequels, ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'' and ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'' (both 2003), all written and directed by The Wachowskis and produced by [[Joel Silver]]. The franchise is owned by [[Warner Bros.]], which distributed the films along with [[Village Roadshow Pictures]]. The latter, along with [[Silver Pictures]] are the two production companies that worked on all three films.

The first film was an important critical and commercial success, winning four [[Academy Awards]], introducing [[popular culture]] symbols such as the [[red pill and blue pill]], and [[The Matrix#Legacy|influencing action filmmaking]]. For those reasons it has been added to the [[National Film Registry]] for preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing - National Film Preservation Board {{!}} Programs {{!}} Library of Congress|work=The Library of Congress|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first sequel was an even bigger commercial success, becoming the highest-grossing [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R-rated]] film in history,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Matrix Revolutions Ignites Global Box Office Revolution with $204 Million Opening, Setting a New Record for the Biggest Consecutive 5-Day Opening of All Time {{!}} WarnerMedia|url=http://www.warnermediagroup.com/newsroom/press-releases/2003/11/09/the-matrix-revolutions-ignites-global-box-office-revolution-with|website=www.warnermediagroup.com|accessdate=2018-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Looking back at the Matrix sequels|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/movies/the-matrix/30733/looking-back-at-the-matrix-sequels|work=Den of Geek|accessdate=2018-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; a title which it held for 13 years, until it was surpassed by the film [[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=‘Deadpool’ Overtakes ‘Matrix Reloaded’ as Highest-Grossing R-Rated Movie|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/box-office/deadpool-box-office-biggest-r-rated-movie-1201740907/|work=Variety|date=March 29, 2016|accessdate=July 8, 2018|language=en-US|first=Brent|last=Lang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series features a [[cyberpunk]] story of the technological fall of man, in which a self-aware artificial intelligence has wiped most of humanity from the Earth except for those it enslaves in a virtual reality system as a farmed power source, and the relatively few remaining humans who are free of that system. The A.I. agenda is to destroy all humans who are free, considering them a threat/disease.  The story incorporates references to numerous philosophical and religious ideas. Influences include the principles of [[mythology]], [[anime]], and [[Hong Kong action cinema|Hong Kong action films]] (particularly "[[heroic bloodshed]]" and [[martial arts film|martial arts]] movies). Consistent throughout are the concepts of inter-dependency and love.

The characters and settings of the films are further explored in other media set in the same [[fictional universe]], including animation, comics, and video games. The comic "Bits and Pieces of Information" and ''[[The Animatrix]]'' short film [[The Animatrix#.22The Second Renaissance Part I.22|"The Second Renaissance"]] act as prequels to the films, explaining how the franchise's setting came to be. The video game ''[[Enter the Matrix]]'' connects the story of the ''Animatrix'' short [[The Animatrix#"Final Flight of the Osiris"|"Final Flight of the Osiris"]] with the events of ''Reloaded'', while the video game ''[[The Matrix Online]]'' is a direct sequel to ''Revolutions''.

As of February 2016, the franchise has generated $3&amp;nbsp;billion in revenue, making it one of the [[List of the highest-grossing media franchises|highest-grossing media franchises of all time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ramascreen.com/international-buyers-put-blooms-suburbicon-on-the-map-paramount-pictures-acquires-the-u-s-rights/|title=International Buyers Put BLOOM’s "Suburbicon" On The Map. Paramount Pictures Acquires The U.S. Rights|website=ramascreen.com|date=February 15, 2016|accessdate=March 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, it was reported that Warner Bros. was in early stages of developing a relaunch of the franchise with new films.

==Setting==
The series depicts a future in which Earth is dominated by artificial intelligence that was created early in the 21st century and [[AI takeover|rebelled against humanity]]. At one point, humans attempted to block out the machines' source of [[solar power]] by covering the sky in thick, stormy clouds. During this time, the machines and mankind were engaged in a massive war in which the machines ultimately emerged the victor. Having no definite source of energy, the machines devised a way to extract humans' [[bioelectricity]] and [[thermal energy]] by growing people in pods, while their minds are controlled by [[cybernetic implant]]s connecting them to a [[simulated reality]] called the Matrix.

The virtual reality world simulated by the Matrix resembles human civilization around the turn of the 21st century (this time period was chosen because it is supposedly the pinnacle of human civilization). The majority of the stories in the ''Matrix'' franchise take place in a vast [[Western World]] unnamed megacity. This environment is practically indistinguishable from reality (although scenes set within the Matrix are presented on-screen with a green tint to the footage, and a general bias towards the color green), and the majority of bluepills - humans connected to the Matrix - are unaware of its true nature. Most of the central characters in the series are able to gain [[superhuman]] abilities within the Matrix by taking advantage of their understanding of its true nature to manipulate its virtual [[physical law]]s.

The virtual world is first introduced in ''[[The Matrix]]''. The ''[[The Animatrix|Animatrix]]'' short film "[[The Second Renaissance]]" and the short comic ''Bits and Pieces of Information'' show how the initial conflict between humans and machines came about, and how and why the Matrix was first developed. Its history and purpose are further explained in ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]''.

The ''Matrix'' series includes a trilogy of feature films, all of which were written and directed by [[The Wachowskis]] and produced by [[Joel Silver]], starring [[Keanu Reeves]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] and [[Hugo Weaving]]. The series was filmed in [[Australia]] and began with 1999's ''[[The Matrix]]'', which depicts the recruitment of hacker [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] into humanity's rebellion against sentient machines. The film was highly successful, earning $460 million worldwide, and becoming the first DVD release in the United States to reach sales of three million copies.&lt;ref name="dvdsales"&gt;''{{cite web|url=http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rl_cmp/rl_press_August_01_00.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305104849/http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rl_cmp/rl_press_August_01_00.html|archivedate=March 5, 2008|title=Press release – August 1, 2000 – The Matrix DVD: The first to sell 3 million|publisher=Warner Bros., Inc.|work=Whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com|location=Burbank|date=August 1, 2000|accessdate=April 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's mainstream success had backed up the initial idea of making a trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1999/voices/columns/reeves-helmers-near-pricey-matrix-sequels-1117750684/|title=Reeves, helmers near pricey ‘Matrix’ sequels|first=Michael|last=Fleming|date=August 24, 1999|work=variety.com|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequels, ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'' and ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'', were filmed simultaneously during one [[filmmaking#Production|shoot]] (under the project codename "The Burly Man"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.05/matrix2_pr.html|title=MATRIX2|first=Steve|last=Silberman|work=wired.com|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released in two parts in 2003. They tell the story of the impending attack on the human enclave of [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]] by a vast machine army. Neo also learns more about the history of the Matrix and his role as The One. The sequels also incorporate more ambitious action scenes and visual effects.

=== Future ===
While making the ''Matrix'' films, the Wachowskis told their close collaborators that at that time they had no intention of making another one after ''The Matrix Revolutions''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundtrack.net/content/article/?id=107|title=Don Davis - Interview|work=soundtrack.net|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/05/11/1052591672027.html|title=Love bug bites the new Matrix - smh.com.au|work=smh.com.au|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/2003/11/14/next-neo-thing/amp/|title=Next Neo Thing|date=November 14, 2003|work=ew.com|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dailyhaggis.com/2003/10/28/new-matrix-games-on-the-way/&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015, in interviews promoting ''[[Jupiter Ascending]]'', Lilly Wachowski called a return to ''The Matrix'' a "particularly repelling idea in these times", noting the studios' tendency to green-light sequels, reboots, and adaptations over original material,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timescolonist.com/wachowskis-unfazed-by-negativity-ahead-of-jupiter-ascending-launch-1.1751638|title=Wachowskis unfazed by negativity ahead of 'Jupiter Ascending' launch|first=Derrik J.|last=Lang|work=timescolonist.com|accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Lana Wachowski, addressing rumors about a potential [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]], said they haven't heard anything, but she believed the studio might be looking to replace them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/wachowskis-jupiter-ascending-interview/|title=The Wachowskis Talk JUPITER ASCENDING, Creating the Chicago Sequence, SENSE8, and More|date=February 4, 2015|work=collider.com|accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote that Warner Bros. was in early stages of developing a relaunch of the franchise, with [[Zak Penn]] in talks to write a treatment, and interest in getting [[Michael B. Jordan]] attached to star. According to the article neither the Wachowskis nor Joel Silver were involved at that stage, although the studio would like to get at minimum the blessing of the Wachowskis.&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/matrix-reboot-works-at-warner-bros-986292|title='The Matrix' Reboot in the Works at Warner Bros. (Exclusive)|work=hollywoodreporter.com|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penn struck down the notion of a reboot or [[remake]], stating he is interested in seeing stories set in the already established universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/the-matrix-reboot-details-zak-penn/|title=‘The Matrix’ Reboot Writer Says It May Not Be a Reboot After All|date=March 17, 2017|work=collider.com|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, one such story the studio is considering, is a [[prequel]] film about a young [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]].&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2017/03/17/the-new-matrix-may-be-a-young-morpheus-movie|title=The New MATRIX May Be A Young Morpheus Movie|first=Scott|last=Wampler|date=March 17, 2017|work=birthmoviesdeath.com|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous month, Keanu Reeves said he would return to a potential new ''Matrix'' film only if the Wachowskis were writing and directing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/keanu-reeves-is-up-for-the-matrix-4-exclusive-135415356.html|title=Keanu Reeves is up for The Matrix 4 (exclusive)|work=yahoo.com|accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2017, Hugo Weaving said he would be open to returning in future Matrix films if the scripts were good and came with the Wachowskis' blessing, although he believed the producers would likely want a fresh start with a new cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/apr/18/hugo-weaving-on-revisiting-the-matrix-they-would-start-again-with-different-actors|title=Hugo Weaving on revisiting The Matrix: 'They would start again with different actors'|first=Luke|last=Buckmaster|date=April 17, 2017|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, Penn said he is working on a revival of the franchise and teased the possibility of an expanded universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Joey|last=Paur|url=https://geektyrant.com/news/the-writer-of-the-matrix-revival-offers-an-update-and-teases-an-expanded-universe|title=The Writer of THE MATRIX Revival Offers an Update and Teases an Expanded Universe|date=19 March 2018|publisher=GeekTyrant|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The Ultimate Matrix Collection'' ==
In 2004, [[Warner Home Video]] released ''The Ultimate Matrix Collection'', a ten-disc set of the films on [[DVD]]. It included all three films, ''[[The Animatrix]]'', and six discs of additional material, including the documentary film ''[[The Matrix Revisited]]'', the live action footage shot for ''[[Enter the Matrix]]'', and a promotional compilation of ''[[The Matrix Online]]''. For this release, ''The Matrix'' was remastered under the supervision of the Wachowskis and Bill Pope to improve its picture quality and make its coloring closer to that of its sequels. At the request of the Wachowskis, as they explain in a written statement that accompanies the boxset, each of the three films is accompanied by two audio commentaries, one by philosophers who liked the films, and another by critics who did not, with the intention that viewers use them as reference points to form their own opinion. A ''Limited Edition'' of ''The Ultimate Matrix Collection'' was also released. It encases the ten discs plus a [[resin]] bust of Neo inside an [[acrylic glass]] box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/13432/ultimate-matrix-collection-limited-edition-the/|title=The Ultimate Matrix Collection: Limited Edition|work=dvdtalk.com|accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Ultimate Matrix Collection'' was later also released on [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The HD DVD release added a picture-in-picture video commentary to the three films and the extras the original standalone DVD releases of the films had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hddvd.highdefdigest.com/301/matrix_umc.html|title=The Ultimate Matrix Collection HD DVD Review - High-Def Digest|work=highdefdigest.com|accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blu-ray release presented ''The Animatrix'' in high definition for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluray.highdefdigest.com/300/matrix_umc.html|title=The Ultimate Matrix Collection Blu-ray Review - High Def Digest|work=highdefdigest.com|accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical and public response===

While ''The Matrix'' received largely positive reviews, and ''The Matrix Reloaded'' received generally positive reviews,&lt;ref name="rt-matrix"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rt-reloaded"/&gt; the critical response to ''The Matrix Revolutions'' was mixed.&lt;ref name="rt-revolutions" /&gt; One major complaint was that it did not give any answers to the questions raised in ''Reloaded''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/movies/reviews/n_9482/index1.html|title=Naval Gazing|work=nymag.com|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend, cinema audiences gave the series an average grade of "A−", "B+", "B" respectively on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="Mcs" /&gt;

And we were like, 'Well, can the audience go through the three movies and experience something similar to what the main character experiences?'&lt;br&gt;So the first movie is sort of typical in its approach. The second movie is deconstructionist, and it assaults all of the things that you thought to be true in the first movie, and so people get very upset, and they're like 'Stop attacking me!' in the same way that people get upset with [[deconstruction|deconstructionist philosophy]]. I mean, [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]] and [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], these people upset us. And then the third movie is the most ambiguous, because it asks you to actually participate in the construction of meaning.}}

The ''Matrix'' films makes numerous references to films and literature, and to historical myths and philosophy including [[Buddhism]], [[Vedanta]], [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita]] [[Hinduism]], [[Christianity]], [[Messianism]], [[Judaism]], [[Gnosticism]], [[existentialism]], [[obscurantism]], and [[nihilism]]. The films' premise resembles [[Plato]]'s [[Allegory of the Cave|Allegory of the cave]], [[René Descartes]]'s [[evil demon]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s reflections on the [[Phenomenon]] versus the [[Noumenon|Ding an sich]], [[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'s "[[Zhuangzi dreamed he was a butterfly]]", Marxist social theory and the [[brain in a vat]] thought experiment. Many references to [[Jean Baudrillard]]'s ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]'' appear in the first film. Baudrillard himself considered this a misrepresentation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ubishops.ca/BaudrillardStudies/vol2_2/rovira.htm |title=IJBS |date=October 21, 2010 |work=archive.org |accessdate=March 31, 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021010544/http://www.ubishops.ca/BaudrillardStudies/vol2_2/rovira.htm |archivedate=October 21, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although Lana Wachowski claims the point the reference was making was misunderstood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARoKJ00cEZ8|title=Andy Wachowski and Lana Wachowski|first=|last=DePaul Visiting Artists Series|date=May 2, 2014|publisher=|accessdate=March 27, 2017|via=YouTube| time=01:11:34}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are similarities to [[cyberpunk]] works such as ''[[Neuromancer]]'' by [[William Gibson]],&lt;ref name="gibson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cla.purdue.edu/English/theory/postmodernism/plans/postmodplansmatrix.html|title=Postmodernism Lesson Plans: The Matrix and Neuromancer|work=purdue.edu|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who has described ''The Matrix'' as "arguably the ultimate 'cyberpunk' artifact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/archive/2003_01_28_archive.asp#90244012|title=THE MATRIX: FAIR COP|authorlink=William Gibson|last=Gibson|first=William|work=The William Gibson Blog|date=January 28, 2003|accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese director [[Mamoru Oshii]]'s ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'' was a strong influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warnervideo.com/matrixevents/wachowski.html|title=Home|work=warnervideo.com|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[Joel Silver]] has stated that the Wachowskis first described their intentions for ''The Matrix'' by showing him that anime and saying, "We wanna do that for real."&lt;ref name="silver-anime-1"&gt;[[Joel Silver]], interviewed in "Scrolls to Screen: A Brief History of Anime" featurette on ''[[The Animatrix]]'' DVD.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="silver-anime-2"&gt;[[Joel Silver]], interviewed in "Making ''The Matrix''" featurette on the ''Matrix'' DVD.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mitsuhisa Ishikawa]] of [[Production I.G]], which produced ''Ghost in the Shell'', noted that the anime's high-quality visuals were a strong source of inspiration for the Wachowskis. He also commented, "... cyberpunk films are very difficult to describe to a third person. I'd imagine that ''The Matrix'' is the kind of film that was very difficult to draw up a written proposal for to take to film studios." He stated that since ''Ghost in the Shell'' had gained recognition in America, the Wachowskis used it as a "promotional tool."&lt;ref name="south bank show"&gt;[[Mitsuhisa Ishikawa]], interviewed in ''[[The South Bank Show]]'', episode broadcast February 19, 2006 [https://web.archive.org/web/20100528022243/http://www.itv.com/page.asp?partid=2701]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities to the 1985 anime film ''[[Megazone 23]]'' have also been noticed, but the Wachowskis claimed to have never seen it.&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/cmp/larryandychat.html |title=ONLINE CHAT - Larry &amp; Andy Wachowski |date=February 13, 2010 |work=archive.org |accessdate=March 27, 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213041503/http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/cmp/larryandychat.html |archivedate=February 13, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewers have commented on similarities between ''The Matrix'' and other late-1990s films such as ''[[Strange Days (film)|Strange Days]]'', ''[[Dark City (1998 film)|Dark City]]'', and ''[[The Truman Show]]''.&lt;ref name="rogerebert"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19990331/REVIEWS/903310303/1023|title=The Matrix|first=Roger|last=Ebert|authorlink=Roger Ebert|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times|suntimes.com]]|quote="The Matrix" recycles the premises of "Dark City" and "Strange Days,"...|date=March 31, 1999|accessdate=September 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="channel4review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=105863|title=The Matrix (1999) - Film Review from FilmFour|work=[[Film4]]|publisher=[[Channel Four Television Corporation]]|quote=The film is a perfect product of its time. It is a very modern conspiracy thriller, a film based, like The Truman Show, on the appealingly terrifying notion of a universal conspiracy - that life itself and everything that we know and take for granted are lies. It's also a film steeped in the traditionals of Japanese anime and megamixed philosophy and semiotics (spot the Baudrillard references kids).|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525142638/http://www.film4.com/reviews/1999/the-matrix|archivedate=May 25, 2010|accessdate=September 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rowley review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sterow.com/?p=229 |title=What Was the Matrix? |author=Rowley, Stephen |date=June 18, 2003|work=sterow.com|quote=The Matrix was the third in a cycle of movies to arrive in the late nineties with a strikingly similar theme. Like its predecessors from the previous year, Dark City and The Truman Show, it tells the story of a seemingly ordinary man who suddenly finds that his whole life is faked: he is trapped in an artificially created environment designed to keep him in submission. Like the heroes of those earlier movies, Keanu Reeves' Neo starts to realise that he is somehow special, and tries to escape the confines of his prison.|accessdate=January 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wachowskis claimed no influence regarding ''Dark City'', but commented about it and ''The Truman Show'' that they thought it was "very strange that Australia came to have three films associated with it that were all about the nature of reality.".&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt;

Comparisons have also been made to [[Grant Morrison]]'s comic series ''[[The Invisibles]]''; Morrison believes that the Wachowskis essentially plagiarized his work to create the film.&lt;ref name="grantmorrison"&gt;[http://www.poormojo.org/pmjadaily/archives/002657.html "Poor Mojo Newswire: Suicide Girls Interview with Grant Morrison] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628091125/http://www.poormojo.org/pmjadaily/archives/002657.html |date=June 28, 2009 }}." URL retrieved July 31, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The Wachowskis have responded that they enjoy the comic but weren't inspired by it.&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt;

In addition, the similarity of the films' central concept to a device in the long-running series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' has also been noted. As in the film, the [[Matrix (Doctor Who)|Matrix]] of that series (introduced in the 1976 serial ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'') is a massive computer system which one enters using a device connecting to the head, allowing users to see representations of the real world and change its laws of physics; but if killed there, they will die in reality.&lt;ref&gt;Condon, Paul. ''The Matrix Unlocked''. 2003. Contender. p.141-3. {{ISBN|1-84357-093-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ''Matrix'' film features numerous references to the "[[White Rabbit]]", the "Rabbit Hole" and mirrors, referring to [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,22971,00.html|title=Popular Metaphysics|first=Richard|last=Corliss|date=April 11, 1999|publisher=|accessdate=April 1, 2017|via=content.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="archive.org"/

[[Matrixism]] is a [[new religious movement]] inspired by the trilogy. A [[sociologist of religion]] [[Adam Possamai]] describes these types of religions/spiritualities as hyper-real religions due to their eclectic mix of religion/spirituality with elements of [[popular culture]] and their connection to the fluid [[social structures]] of [[late capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.cst.ebooks.datasheet&amp;id=14609 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807055343/http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.cst.ebooks.datasheet&amp;id=14609 |archivedate=August 7, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some debate about whether followers of Matrixism are indeed serious about their practice; however, the religion (real or otherwise) has received attention in the media.&lt;ref name="gm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Theyre-all-god-movies/2005/05/18/1116361618786.html|title=They're all god movies, in mysterious ways - National - smh.com.au|work=smh.com.au|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/080615/Mirror/mirror006.html|title=The Sunday Times Sri Lanka|work=sundaytimes.lk|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Wachowskis' [[coming out]] as [[transgender women]] some years after the release of the films, the first film and the pill analogy have also been analyzed in the context of the Wachowskis transgender experiences. In this case, taking the red pill and living out of the Matrix symbolizes exploring one's own [[gender identity]], starting the transition and [[coming out]] as transgender, as opposed to a continued life in the closet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@BootlegGirl/bootlegging-the-matrix-ccb8d6442778|title=Bootlegging the Matrix: In Which Bootleg Girl Explains the Matrix Sequels|author=Dr. Eleanor A.

In April 2003 Sophia Stewart filed a legal [[complaint]] in the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]] alleging that the idea of ''[[The Matrix]]'' (and the 1984 film ''[[The Terminator]]'')  were [[plagiarized]] from her own [[film treatment]] entitled "The Third Eye."&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gray|first1=Madison|title=Inside The Billion Dollar Matrix Lawsuit, One of the Internet’s Most Pervasive Legends|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/11/22/inside-the-billion-dollar-matrix-lawsuit-one-of-the-internets-most-pervasive-hoaxes/|website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=16 October 2017|date=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="indiewire1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seewood|first1=Andre|title=Sophia Stewart: "The Matrix" Lawsuit – Conspiracy Or Hoax?|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2011/12/sophia-stewart-the-matrix-lawsuit-conspiracy-or-hoax-149399/|website=[[IndieWire]]|accessdate=16 October 2017|date=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court allowed the lawsuit to move forward in 2005,&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=Corey|title='Matrix' Lawsuit to Move Forward|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4664150|website=[[NPR]]|accessdate=16 October 2017|date=24 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Stewart did not attend the hearing. In a 53-page ruling, Judge Margaret Morrow dismissed the case, stating that Stewart and her attorneys "had not entered any evidence to bolster its key claims or demonstrated any striking similarity between her work and the accused directors’ films." &lt;ref name="time" /&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Powers|first1=Kemp|title=The Billion-Dollar Myth|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jul/31/magazine/tm-mothermatrix31|accessdate=16 October 2017|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=31 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the ruling, the case became the subject of "Internet legend," with many sources claiming Stewart had actually won the lawsuit.&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="indiewire2"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Sergio|title=Why Won’t That Story About Sophia Stewart And Her ‘Matrix’ Lawsuit Die?|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2013/04/why-wont-that-story-about-sophia-stewart-and-her-matrix-lawsuit-die-136356/|website=[[IndieWire]]|accessdate=16 October 2017|date=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sophia Stewart Matrix Lawsuit|url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/business/matrix.asp|website=[[Snopes.com]]|accessdate=16 October 2017|date=8 Aug 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Thomas Althouse filed suit in California federal court alleging that ideas for the sequels ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'' and ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'' came from a screenplay he wrote called ''The Immortals.'' In a [[summary judgement]] for the [[defendant]]s, Judge R. Gary Klausner stated "The basic premises of ''The Matrix Trilogy'' and ''The Immortals'' are so different that it would be unreasonable to find their plots substantially similar."&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;&lt;ref name="reporter"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gardner|first1=Eriq|title=Warner Bros.

===Animation===
{{Main|The Animatrix}}
In acknowledgment of the strong influence of Japanese [[anime]] on the ''Matrix'' series, ''[[The Animatrix]]'' was produced in 2003 to coincide with the release of ''The Matrix Reloaded''. This is a collection of nine animated short films intended to further flesh out the concepts, history, characters and setting of the series. The objective of ''The Animatrix'' project was to give other writers and directors the opportunity to lend their voices and interpretation to the ''Matrix'' universe; the Wachowskis conceived of and oversaw the process, and they wrote four of the segments themselves, although they were given to other directors to execute. Many of the segments were produced by notable figures from the world of [[Japanese animation]]. Four of the films were originally released on the series' official website, one was shown in cinemas with ''[[Dreamcatcher (2003 film)|Dreamcatcher]]'', one was shown on MTV, MTV2, MTV3, MTV4, and Syfi, and the others first appeared with the DVD release of all nine shorts shortly after the release of ''The Matrix Reloaded''.

===Video games===
On May 15, 2003, the game ''[[Enter the Matrix]]'' was released in North America concurrently with ''The Matrix Reloaded''. The first of three video games related to the films, it told a story running parallel to ''The Matrix Reloaded'' and featured scenes that were shot during the filming of ''The Matrix Reloaded'' and ''The Matrix Revolutions''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/20/technology/from-projector-to-polygons-a-thin-line-between-film-and-joystick.html|title=A Thin Line Between Film And Joystick|date=February 20, 2003|work=The New York Times|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two more ''The Matrix'' video games were released in 2005. The [[MMORPG]] ''[[The Matrix Online]]'' continued the story beyond ''The Matrix Revolutions'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/03/19/the-matrix-online-4|title=The Matrix Online|first=Tom|last=McNamara|date=March 18, 2005|work=ign.com|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[The Matrix: Path of Neo]]'' allowed players to control Neo in scenes from the film trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/07/21/path-of-neo-the-matrix-interview|title=Path of Neo: The Matrix Interview|first=Jeremy|last=Dunham|date=July 21, 2005|work=ign.com|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Matrix'' official website also provided several original [[Adobe Flash]]-based [[browser game]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/03/23/the-matrix-revolutions |title=The Matrix Revolutions |date=22 March 2004 |website=[[IGN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Matrix Arcade|url=http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com:80/cmp/rl_game_index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051216102005/http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/cmp/rl_game_index.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=December 16, 2005|publisher=[[Wayback Machine]]|accessdate=8 July 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comic books===
''The Matrix Comics'' is a set of comic books and [[short story|short stories]] based on the series and written and illustrated by figures from the comics industry; one of the comics was written by the Wachowskis and illustrated by the films' [[concept artist]] [[Geof Darrow]]. Most of the comics were originally presented for free on the ''Matrix'' series' website;&lt;ref name=comics&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815230811/http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rl_cmp/comics_new_front.html|url=http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rl_cmp/comics_new_front.html|title=Comics|work=whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com|accessdate=April 11, 2012|archivedate=August 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; they were later republished, along with some new material, in two printed [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] volumes.

===Screensaver===
The ''Matrix'' official website provided a free [[screensaver]] for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X, which simulates the falling "[[Matrix digital rain]]" of the films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/1999/05/14/decoding-matrix/|title=Decoding ''The Matrix''|last=Essex|first=Andrew|date=May 14, 1999|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Matrix official screensaver|url=http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com:80/cmp/m1_screensaver_index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051216102005/http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/cmp/m1_screensaver_index.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=December 16, 2005|publisher=[[Wayback Machine]]|accessdate=8 July 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The screensaver was reported to have a password security issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="The Matrix" Screensaver is insecure|url=http://www.securiteam.com/windowsntfocus/3G5PRRFPPS.html|last=Boyce|first=Nick|date=October 6, 1999|publisher=SecuriTeam|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Matrix digital rain" also inspired the creation of many unofficial screensavers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saver the Moment: movie inspired screen savers|url=http://ew.com/article/2001/03/02/saver-moment-movie-inspired-screen-savers/|last=Podolsky|first=Erin|date=March 2, 2001|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Oxford History of Western Music''''' is a narrative history from the "earliest [[Musical notation|notation]]s" (taken to be around the eighth century) to the late twentieth century. It was written by the American musicologist [[Richard Taruskin]]. Published by [[Oxford University Press]], it is a multi-volume work, but is shorter than the same publisher's ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', which is written by multiple contributors. 

The ''Oxford History of Western Music'' appeared in 2005. A paperback edition in five volumes followed in 2009. It is available online, but is not part of [[Oxford Music Online]], the portal which gives electronic access to the ''New Grove Dictionary'' (Grove Music Online) and ''[[The Oxford Companion to Music]]''.&lt;ref name="Guidedtour"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oxfordwesternmusic.com/page/guided-tour | title=Guided Tour (www.oxfordwesternmusic.com) | accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Previous histories of music==
OUP had previously published narrative histories of music, although Taruskin was more influenced by [[Donald Jay Grout]]'s work ''A History of Western Music'' (New York, 1960).&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E0D81630F93AA25751C1A9629C8B63&amp;smid=tw-share "A History of Western Music? Well, It's a Long Story"] (brief interview with Taruskin by [[James Oestreich]] in the ''[[New York Times]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Oxford History of Music'' was first published in six volumes under the general editorship of Sir [[Henry Hadow]] between 1901 and 1905. The first two volumes, written by [[Harry Ellis Wooldridge|H. E. Woolridge]], were entitled ''The Polyphonic Period'', and began with the [[music of ancient Greece]]: these volumes dated quite quickly. Other volumes were reprinted as they stood, but Sir [[Percy Buck]] , who was also involved with the OUP's ''Tudor Church Music'', revised the first two volumes (1929 and 1932), and edited a new introductory volume (1929). The introductory volume included a contribution from [[Sylvia Townsend Warner]].&lt;ref&gt;Anne Pimlott Baker, ‘Buck, Sir Percy Carter (1871–1947)’, [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/58744, accessed 16 Aug 2016] (subscription or membership of a UK public library required)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''New Oxford History of Music'', produced under the general editorship of Sir [[Jack Westrup]], began to appear in 1954.
Contributors included [[Paul Steinitz]].

'''''Timecop''''' was originally published as a three-part story, "Time Cop: A Man Out of Time", in the [[anthology comic]] ''Dark Horse Comics'' (August–October 1992) and spawned the successful film ''[[Timecop (film)|Timecop]]''.

After the film reached #1 at the box office, it managed to spin off into a video game for [[SNES]], a short-lived TV show on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], a series of novels and a direct-to-video sequel in 2003.&lt;ref name="GB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/adaptations-more-famous-than-original-comics/|title=15 Adaptations More Famous Than the Original Comics |last=Cohen|first=Jason|work=[[CBR.com]]|date=2017-04-20|accessdate=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= ‘Timecop’ Reboot at Universal Gets Two Writers|work= [[ScreenRant]]|date=|url= http://screenrant.com/timecop-reboot-writers/|accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Mike Richardson wrote a three-part story titled "Time Cop: A Man Out of Time", that was included in the launch of the [[Dark Horse Comics]] [[anthology series]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="GB"/&gt; Richardson developed the story, but the comic was written by Mark Verheiden and drawn by Ron Randall.

Richardson and Verheiden then teamed up to write the screenplay for the movie adaptation and followed it with a two-issue comic book adaptation of the film, published along with the film’s release in 1994.&lt;ref name="GB"/&gt;

==Plot synopsis==
===The Man Out of Time===
The plot of "The Man out of Time" and the "TimeCop" film are very different, but share the same protagonist: Max Walker. The original story involves the main character catching an illegal time traveler robbing a [[South African]] mine of a huge diamond in the 1930s. After his capture and return, however, Walker is soon made aware that the criminal's personal robotic bodyguard is still operational in the past and wreaking havoc on the timeline. To restore order, Walker must return to the mine and stop the machine's malfunctioning rampage.

'''''Trybuna Ludu''''' ({{IPA-pl|trɨˈbuna ˈludu}}; ''People's Tribune'') was one of the largest newspapers in [[People's Republic of Poland|communist Poland]]. It was the official media outlet of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (PZPR) and one of its main [[propaganda]] outlets.

==History==
[[File:TrybunaLudu3.png|thumb|A copy of ''Trybuna Ludu'' headline from 14 December 1981, reporting [[Martial law in Poland]]]]

===Formation===
On 16 December 1948, Poland's primary two communist parties, the [[Polish Socialist Party]] and the [[Polish Workers' Party]], were combined to form Polish United Workers' Party. The parties' respective newspapers, ''[[Robotnik (1894–1939)|Robotnik]]'' and ''[[Głos Ludu (Poland)|Głos Ludu]]'', were merged as well, and ''Trybuna Ludu'' was formed.

===Significance===
Through the 20th century, the media in Poland was entirely controlled by the PZPR, and newspapers were no exception. The contents of ''Trybuna Ludu'' and its smaller competitors were marked by the idea of reliance on the party.&lt;ref name= media /&gt; Being the official party newspaper, ''Trybuna Luda'' dominated the market. By the end of 1981, circulation topped 1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=31 August 1981|title= Poland: Pressing On |journal=Time |volume=118|issue=9 |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,954941,00.html |accessdate=27 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite growing opposition to the party, the number of ''Trybuna Ludu'' subscribers continued to grow and reached nearly 1.9 million by the late 1980s.&lt;ref name= media&gt;{{cite book|last=Gripsrud |first=Jostein |author-link=Jostein Gripsrud |first2=Lennart |last2=Weibull|author3=European Science Foundation |title= Media, Markets &amp; Public Spheres: European Media at the Crossroads |publisher=Intellect |year=2010 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zGJEfrbPoaMC&amp;pg=PA222&amp;lpg=PA222&amp;dq=Trybuna+Ludu+circulation+in+the+late+1980s+approached+nearly+1,900,000 |page=222|isbn=9781841503059 |accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Party dissolution and aftermath===
The break-up of the PZPR began on 28 January 1990, just hours after the final issue of ''Trybuna Ludu'' was printed. Despite an attempted relaunch as ''Trybuna Kongresowa'', the paper was unable to survive the [[fall of communism]] in Poland.

After 1990, much of its tradition was unofficially taken over by ''[[Trybuna]]'', a newly created Polish left-wing newspaper. At its peak, the number of readers was a small 50,000, and, because of poor economic conditions, printing was halted in late 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/12/07/us-poland-newspaper-idCATRE5B62P220091207|title= Mouthpiece of communist Poland falls prey to market|date=7 December 2009 |work=Reuters |accessdate=27 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9079">The '''Video Game Masters Tournament''' was an event that was created in 1983 by [[Twin Galaxies]] to generate world record high scores for the 1984 U.S. Edition of the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title='86 Video Game Masters Tourney Set for June 27-29|journal=Cash Box|date=June 28, 1986|volume=50|issue=2|page=34|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Cash-Box/80s/1986/CB-1986-06-28.pdf|accessdate=August 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the most prestigious contest of that era and the only one that the Guinness book looked to for verified world records on video games at the time.{{cn|date=August 2017}} This contest was conducted under the joint efforts of Twin Galaxies and the [[U.S. National Video Game Team]] in 1983, 1984 and 1985 and by the U.S. National Video Game Team alone in 1986 and 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=18&amp;id=705 They're Masters of Video Games - Spokesman-Review, Spokane, WA - August 24, 1983] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208034852/http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=18&amp;id=705 |date=December 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its first year, 1983, the event was called the North America Video Game Challenge (State Teams Tournament), but was changed to the Video Game Masters Tournament by the second year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twingalaxies.com/images/generalinfo/State_Teams_Tournment.jpg State Teams Tournament - Poster, August 24-28, 1983] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102160954/http://www.twingalaxies.com/images/generalinfo/State_Teams_Tournment.jpg |date=January 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to administer the contest, Twin Galaxies appointed the U.S. National Video Game Team to the task of collecting and verifying scores from the eight cities that participated in the 1983 edition of this event. The cities were Seattle, Washington; Lake Odessa, Michigan; Coeur D'Alene, Idaho; Omaha, Nebraska; Dayton, Ohio; San Jose, California; Upland, California and Chicago, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;[http://twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=18&amp;id=1032 U.S.Video Team Forming; Plans Call for Match with Japan - RePlay Magazine, October, 1983] {{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wee Georgie Wood 1924.jpg|thumb|Wee Georgie Wood, 1924]]
'''George Wood''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (17 December 1894 in [[Jarrow]], [[County Durham]] &amp;ndash; 19 February 1979), known professionally as '''Wee Georgie Wood''', was a British actor and comedian who appeared in films,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0940079/|title=Wee Georgie Wood|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; plays and [[music hall]] revues. Wood, who was a  [[Dwarfism|dwarf]], worked most his professional life in the guise of a child, appearing in comic and sentimental sketches. He also wrote a column in the weekly ''[[The Stage]]'' newspaper. He was a stalwart of the [[Savage Club]].

Wood, who, when fully grown, was {{convert|4|ft|9|in|m|abbr=on}}, started his long music hall and variety career at the age of five. Discovering that she had found her own home-made Eldorado, his mother managed his life off and on stage. Wood continued performing for over 50 years and was considered to have been one of the most successful pantomime stars of his era.

Wood was inducted into the prestigious show business charitable fraternity, the [[Grand Order of Water Rats]] and served as "King Rat" in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Grand_Order_of_Water_Rats&amp;oldid=775993421|title=Grand Order of Water Rats|date=18 April 2017|publisher=|via=Wikipedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wood was awarded the [[OBE]] for services to the entertainment industry in the King's Birthday Honours List, which was announced on 24 June 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Sunderland Echo, 24 June 1946, page 4&lt;/ref&gt;
He died in London on 19 February 1979 aged 84.

==In popular culture==
Wee Georgie Wood is mentioned at the end of the song "[[Dig It (The Beatles song)|Dig It]]" from [[the Beatles]]' album ''[[Let It Be]]''.
He's mentioned in [[Last of the Summer Wine]] episode "A Short Blast of Fred Astair" when Pearl tells her husband Howard he's not "big enough to be Wee Georgie Wood!".
