      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30851">The '''Akaike information criterion''' ('''AIC''') is an [[estimator]] of the relative quality of [[statistical model]]s for a given set of data. Given a collection of models for the data, AIC estimates the quality of each model, relative to each of the other models. Thus, AIC provides a means for [[model selection]].

AIC is founded on [[information theory]]. When a statistical model is used to represent the process that generated the data, the model will almost never be exact; so some information will be lost by using the model to represent the process. AIC estimates the relative information lost by a given model: the less information a model loses, the higher the quality of that model. (In making an estimate of the information lost, AIC deals with the trade-off between the [[goodness of fit]] of the model and the simplicity of the model.)

The Akaike information criterion  is named after the statistician [[Hirotugu Akaike]], who formulated it. It now forms the basis of a paradigm for the [[foundations of statistics]]; as well, it is widely used for [[statistical inference]].

==Definition==
Suppose that we have a [[statistical model]] of some data. Let {{math|''k''}} be the number of estimated [[Statistical parameter|parameters]] in the model. Let &lt;math&gt;\hat L&lt;/math&gt; be the maximum value of the [[likelihood function]] for the model. Then the AIC value of the model is the following.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc=§2.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Akaiki1974" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{AIC} \, = \, 2k - 2\ln(\hat L)&lt;/math&gt;

Given a set of candidate models for the data, the preferred model is the one with the minimum AIC value. Thus, AIC rewards [[goodness of fit]] (as assessed by the likelihood function), but it also includes a penalty that is an increasing function of the number of estimated parameters. The penalty discourages [[overfitting]], because increasing the number of parameters in the model almost always improves the goodness of the fit.

AIC is founded in [[information theory]]. Suppose that the data is generated by some unknown process ''f''. We consider two candidate models to represent ''f'': ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. If we knew ''f'', then we could find the information lost from using ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to represent ''f'' by calculating the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]], {{Nowrap|''D''&lt;sub&gt;KL&lt;/sub&gt;(''f''&amp;thinsp;‖&amp;thinsp;''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}; similarly, the information lost from using ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to represent ''f'' could be found by calculating {{Nowrap|''D''&lt;sub&gt;KL&lt;/sub&gt;(''f''&amp;thinsp;‖&amp;thinsp;''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. We would then choose the candidate model that minimized the information loss.

We cannot choose with certainty, because we do not know ''f''. {{Harvtxt|Akaike|1974}} showed, however, that we can estimate, via AIC, how much more (or less) information is lost by ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; than by ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The estimate, though, is only valid [[Asymptotic theory (statistics)|asymptotically]]; if the number of data points is small, then some correction is often necessary (see AICc, below).

Note that AIC does not provide a test of a model in the sense of testing a [[null hypothesis]]. It tells nothing about the absolute quality of a model, only the quality relative to other models. Thus, if all the candidate models fit poorly, AIC will not give any warning of that.

==How to apply AIC in practice==
To apply AIC in practice, we start with a set of candidate models, and then find the models' corresponding AIC values. There will almost always be information lost due to using a candidate model to represent the "true model" (i.e. the process that generated the data). We wish to select, from among the candidate models, the model that minimizes the information loss. We cannot choose with certainty, but we can minimize the estimated information loss.

Suppose that there are ''R'' candidate models. Denote the AIC values of those models by AIC&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, AIC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, AIC&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, …, AIC&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;. Let AIC&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; be the minimum of those values. Then the quantity exp((AIC&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;#8239;−&amp;thinsp;AIC&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)/2) can be interpreted  as being proportional to the probability that the ''i''th model minimizes the (estimated) information loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc=§2.9.1, §6.4.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, suppose that there are three candidate models, whose AIC values are 100, 102, and 110. Then the second model is exp((100&amp;#8239;−&amp;thinsp;102)/2) = 0.368 times as probable as the first model to minimize the information loss. Similarly, the third model is exp((100&amp;#8239;−&amp;thinsp;110)/2) = 0.007 times as probable as the first model to minimize the information loss.

In this example, we would omit the third model from further consideration. We then have three options: (1) gather more data, in the hope that this will allow clearly distinguishing between the first two models; (2) simply conclude that the data is insufficient to support selecting one model from among the first two; (3) take a weighted average of the first two models, with weights proportional to 1 and 0.368, respectively, and then do [[statistical inference]] based on the weighted multimodel.&lt;ref name="Burnham 2002"&gt;{{Harvnb|Burnham|Anderson|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quantity exp((AIC&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;#8239;−&amp;thinsp;AIC&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)/2) is known as the ''[[Likelihood function#Relative likelihood|relative likelihood]]'' of model ''i''. It is closely related to the likelihood ratio used in the [[likelihood-ratio test]]. Indeed, if all the models in the candidate set have the same number of parameters, then using AIC might at first appear to be very similar to using the likelihood-ratio test. There are, however, important distinctions. In particular, the likelihood-ratio test is valid only for [[Statistical model#Nested models|nested models]], whereas AIC (and AICc) has no such restriction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc=§2.12.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Murtaugh|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==AICc==
When the [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] size is small, there is a substantial probability that AIC will select models that have too many parameters, i.e. that AIC will overfit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McQuarrie|Tsai|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Claeskens|Hjort|2008|loc= §8.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Giraud|2015|loc= §2.9.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; To address such potential overfitting, AICc was developed: AICc is AIC with a correction for small sample sizes.

The formula for AICc depends upon the statistical model. Assuming that the model is [[univariate]], is linear in its parameters, and has normally-distributed [[Errors and residuals|residuals]] (conditional upon regressors), then the formula for AICc is as follows.&lt;ref name="Cavanaugh"&gt;{{harvnb|Cavanaugh|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc= §2.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{AICc} \, = \, \mathrm{AIC} + \frac{2k^2 + 2k}{n - k - 1}&lt;/math&gt;

—where {{math|''n''}} denotes the sample size and {{math|''k''}} denotes the number of parameters. Thus, AICc is essentially AIC with an extra penalty term for the number of parameters. Note that as {{math|''n'' → ∞}}, the extra penalty term converges to 0, and thus AICc converges to AIC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Burnham|Anderson|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the assumption that the model is univariate and linear with normal residuals does not hold, then the formula for AICc will generally be different from the formula above. For some models, the formula can be difficult to determine. For every model that has AICc available, though, the formula for AICc is given by AIC plus terms that includes both {{math|''k''}} and {{math|''k''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In comparison, the formula for AIC includes {{math|''k''}} but not {{math|''k''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In other words, AIC is a [[First order approximation|first-order estimate]] (of the information loss), whereas AICc is a [[Second order approximation|second-order estimate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc= §7.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further discussion of the formula, with examples of other assumptions, is given by {{Harvtxt|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc= ch. 7}} and by {{Harvtxt|Konishi|Kitagawa|2008|loc= ch. 7–8}}. In particular, with other assumptions, [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrap estimation]] of the formula is often feasible.

To summarize, AICc has the advantage of tending to be more accurate than AIC (especially for small samples), but AICc also has the disadvantage of sometimes being much more difficult to compute than AIC. Note that if all the candidate models have the same {{math|''k''}} and the same formula for AICc, then AICc and AIC will give identical (relative) valuations; hence, there will be no disadvantage in using AIC, instead of AICc. Furthermore, if {{math|''n''}} is many times larger than {{math|''k''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, then the extra penalty term will be negligible; hence, the disadvantage in using AIC, instead of AICc, will be negligible.

==History==
[[File:Akaike.jpg|thumb|[[Hirotugu Akaike]]]]
The Akaike information criterion was formulated by the statistician [[Hirotugu Akaike]]; it was originally named "an information criterion". It was first announced by Akaike at a 1971 symposium, the proceedings of which were published in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akaike|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1973 publication, though, was only an informal presentation of the concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|deLeeuw|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first formal publication was a 1974 paper by Akaike.&lt;ref name="Akaiki1974"&gt;{{Harvnb|Akaike|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{as of|2014|October}}, the 1974 paper had received more than 14000 citations in the [[Web of Science]]: making it the 73rd most-cited research paper of all time.&lt;ref&gt;Van Noordon R., Maher B., Nuzzo R. (2014), "[http://www.nature.com/top100 The top 100 papers]", ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', 514.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, AIC has become common enough that it is often used without citing Akaike's 1974 paper. Indeed, there are over 150,000 scholarly articles/books that use AIC (as assessed by [[Google Scholar]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_vis=0&amp;q=Akaike+AIC&amp;as_sdt=1,5 Sources containing both "Akaike" and "AIC"]—at [[Google Scholar]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial derivation of AIC relied upon some strong assumptions. {{Harvtxt|Takeuchi|1976}} showed that the assumptions could be made much weaker. Takeuchi's work, however, was in Japanese and was not widely known outside Japan for many years.

AICc was originally proposed for [[linear regression]] (only) by {{Harvtxt|Sugiura|1978}}. That instigated the work of {{Harvtxt|Hurvich|Tsai|1989}}, and several further papers by the same authors, which extended the situations in which AICc could be applied.

The first general exposition of the information-theoretic approach was the volume by {{Harvtxt|Burnham|Anderson|2002}}. It includes an English presentation of the work of Takeuchi. The volume led to far greater use of AIC, and it now has more than 42000 citations on [[Google Scholar]].

Akaike called his approach an "entropy maximization principle", because the approach is founded on the concept of [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy in information theory]]. Indeed, minimizing AIC in a statistical model is effectively equivalent to maximizing entropy in a thermodynamic system; in other words, the information-theoretic approach in statistics is essentially applying the [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]]. As such, AIC has roots in the work of  [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] on [[entropy]]. For more on these issues, see {{Harvtxt|Akaike|1985}} and {{Harvtxt|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc=ch.&amp;nbsp;2}}.

==Usage tips==

===Counting parameters===
A [[statistical model]] must fit all the data points. Thus, a straight line, on its own, is not a model of the data, unless all the data points lie exactly on the line. We can, however, choose a model that is "a straight line plus noise"; such a model might be formally described thus:
''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. Here, the ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[Errors and residuals in statistics|residuals]] from the straight line fit. If the ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are assumed to be [[i.i.d.]] [[Normal distribution|Gaussian]] (with zero mean), then the model has three parameters:
''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and the variance of the Gaussian distributions.
Thus, when calculating the AIC value of this model, we should use ''k''=3. More generally, for any [[least squares]] model with i.i.d. Gaussian residuals, the variance of the residuals' distributions should be counted as one of the parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc= p. 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As another example, consider a first-order [[autoregressive model]], defined by
''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''c''&amp;nbsp;+ ''φx''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, with the ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; being i.i.d. Gaussian (with zero mean). For this model, there are three parameters: ''c'', ''φ'', and the variance of the ε&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. More generally, a ''p''th-order autoregressive model has ''p''&amp;#8239;+&amp;thinsp;2 parameters. (If, however, ''c'' is not estimated from the data, but instead given in advance, then there are only ''p''&amp;#8239;+&amp;thinsp;1 parameters.)

===Transforming data===
The AIC values of the candidate models must all be computed with the same data set. Sometimes, though, we might want to compare a model of the [[Dependent and independent variables|response variable]], {{math|''y''}}, with a model of the logarithm of the response variable, {{math|log(''y'')}}. More generally, we might want to compare a model of the data with a model of transformed data. Following is an illustration of how to deal with data transforms (adapted from {{Harvtxt|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc= §2.11.3}}: "Investigators should be sure that all hypotheses are modeled using the same response variable").

Suppose that we want to compare two models: one with a [[normal distribution]] of {{math|''y''}} and one with a normal distribution of {{math|log(''y'')}}. We should ''not'' directly compare the AIC values of the two models. Instead, we should transform the normal [[cumulative distribution function]] to first take the logarithm of {{math|''y''}}. To do that, we need to perform the relevant [[integration by substitution]]: thus, we need to multiply by the derivative of the [[Natural logarithm|(natural) logarithm]] function, which is {{math|1/''y''}}. Hence, the transformed distribution has the following [[probability density function]]:
: &lt;math&gt;y \mapsto \, \frac{1}{y} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\,\exp \left(-\frac{\left(\ln y-\mu\right)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
—which is the probability density function for the [[log-normal distribution]]. We then compare the AIC value of the normal model against the AIC value of the log-normal model.

===Software unreliability===
Some statistical software will report the value of AIC or the maximum value of the log-likelihood function, but the reported values are not always correct.
Typically, any incorrectness is due to a constant in the log-likelihood function being omitted. For example,
the log-likelihood function for {{math|''n''}} [[Independence (probability theory)|independent]] identical [[normal distribution]]s is
: &lt;math&gt;
   \ln\mathcal{L}(\mu,\sigma^2)
    \, = \, -\frac{n}{2}\ln(2\pi) - \frac{n}{2}\ln\sigma^2 - \frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\mu)^2
  &lt;/math&gt;
—this is the function that is maximized, when obtaining the value of AIC. Some software, however, omits the constant term {{math|(''n''/2){{resize|20%|&amp;thinsp;}}ln(2''π'')}}, and so reports erroneous values for the log-likelihood maximum—and thus for AIC. Such errors do not matter for AIC-based comparisons, ''if'' all the models have their [[Errors and residuals|residuals]] as normally-distributed: because then the errors cancel out. In general, however, the constant term needs to be included in the log-likelihood function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc= p. 82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, before using software to calculate AIC, it is generally good practice to run some simple tests on the software, to ensure that the function values are correct.

==Comparisons with other model selection methods==

===Comparison with BIC===

The formula for the [[Bayesian information criterion]] (BIC) is similar to the formula for AIC, but with a different penalty for the number of parameters. With AIC the penalty is {{math|2''k''}}, whereas with BIC the penalty is {{math|ln(''n''){{resize|33%|&amp;thinsp;}}''k''}}.

A comparison of AIC/AICc and BIC is given by {{Harvtxt|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc=§6.3-6.4}}, with follow-up remarks by {{Harvtxt|Burnham|Anderson|2004}}. The authors show that AIC/AICc can be derived in the same Bayesian framework as BIC, just by using different [[Prior probability|prior probabilities]]. In the Bayesian derivation of BIC, though, each candidate model has a prior probability of 1/''R'' (where ''R'' is the number of candidate models); such a derivation is "not sensible", because the prior should be a decreasing function of {{math|''k''}}. Additionally, the authors present a few simulation studies that suggest AICc tends to have practical/performance advantages over BIC.

A point made by several researchers is that AIC and BIC are appropriate for different tasks. In particular, BIC is argued to be appropriate for selecting the "true model" (i.e. the process that generated the data) from the set of candidate models, whereas AIC is not appropriate. To be specific, if the "true model" is in the set of candidates, then BIC will select the "true model" with probability 1, as {{math|''n'' → ∞}}; in contrast, when selection is done via AIC, the probability can be less than 1.&lt;ref name="BA6364"&gt;{{Harvnb|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc=§6.3-6.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vrieze"&gt;{{Harvnb| Vrieze|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ahoetal"&gt;{{Harvnb| Aho| Derryberry |Peterson| |2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of AIC argue that this issue is negligible, because the "true model" is virtually never in the candidate set. Indeed, it is a common aphorism in statistics that "[[all models are wrong]]"; hence the "true model" (i.e. reality) cannot be in the candidate set.

Another comparison of AIC and BIC is given by {{Harvtxt| Vrieze|2012}}. Vrieze presents a simulation study—which allows the "true model" to be in the candidate set (unlike with virtually all real data). The simulation study demonstrates, in particular, that AIC sometimes selects a much better model than BIC even when the "true model" is in the candidate set. The reason is that, for finite {{math|''n''}}, BIC can have a substantial risk of selecting a very bad model from the candidate set. This reason can arise even when {{math|''n''}} is much larger than {{math|''k''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. With AIC, the risk of selecting a very bad model is minimized.

If the "true model" is not in the candidate set, then the most that we can hope to do is select the model that best approximates the "true model". AIC is appropriate for finding the best approximating model, under certain assumptions.&lt;ref name="BA6364" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vrieze" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ahoetal" /&gt;  (Those assumptions include, in particular, that the approximating is done with regard to information loss.)

Comparison of AIC and BIC in the context of [[regression analysis|regression]] is given by {{Harvtxt|Yang|2005}}. In regression, AIC is asymptotically optimal for selecting the model with the least [[mean squared error]], under the assumption that the "true model" is not in the candidate set. BIC is not asymptotically optimal under the assumption. Yang additionally shows that the rate at which AIC converges to the optimum is, in a certain sense, the best possible.

===Comparison with cross-validation===
Leave-one-out [[cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] is asymptotically equivalent to AIC, for ordinary linear regression models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asymptotic equivalence to AIC also holds for [[Mixed model|mixed-effects models]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fang|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison with least squares===

Sometimes, each candidate model assumes that the residuals are distributed according to independent identical normal distributions (with zero mean). That gives rise to [[least squares]] model fitting.

With least squares fitting, the [[Maximum likelihood estimation|maximum likelihood estimate]] for the variance of a model's residuals distributions is &lt;math&gt;\hat\sigma^2 = \mathrm{RSS}/n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{RSS}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[residual sum of squares]]: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathrm{RSS} = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-f(x_i;\hat{\theta}))^2&lt;/math&gt;. Then, the maximum value of a model's log-likelihood function is 
: &lt;math&gt;
 -\frac{n}{2}\ln(2\pi) - \frac{n}{2}\ln(\hat\sigma^2) - \frac{1}{2\hat\sigma^2}\mathrm{RSS}  
\, = \, - \frac{n}{2}\ln(\mathrm{RSS}/n) + C_1
  &lt;/math&gt;
—where {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a constant independent of the model, and dependent only on the particular data points, i.e. it does not change if the data does not change.

That gives AIC&amp;nbsp;= {{math|2''k''&amp;nbsp;+ ''n''{{resize|33%|&amp;thinsp;}}ln(RSS/''n'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus; 2''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{=}} 2''k''&amp;nbsp;+ ''n''{{resize|33%|&amp;thinsp;}}ln(RSS)&amp;nbsp;+ ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Burnham|Anderson|2002|loc=p. 63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because only differences in AIC are meaningful, the constant {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be ignored, which allows us to conveniently take AIC&amp;nbsp;= {{math|2''k''&amp;nbsp;+ ''n''{{resize|33%|&amp;thinsp;}}ln(RSS)}} for model comparisons. Note that if all the models have the same {{math|''k''}}, then selecting the model with minimum AIC is equivalent to selecting the model with minimum {{math|RSS}}—which is the usual objective of model selection based on least squares.

===Comparison with Mallows's ''C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''===
[[Mallows's Cp|Mallows's ''C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'']] is equivalent to AIC in the case of (Gaussian) [[linear regression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boisbunon|Canu|Fourdrinier|Strawderman|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aline Elizabeth Black''', also known under her married name of '''Aline Elizabeth Black Hicks''', (born 1906, died 1974) was an African-American educator, known for taking part in a civil rights court case that centered on unequal pay.&lt;ref name="pw"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wallenstein|first1=Peter|title=Blue Laws and Black Codes: Conflict, Courts, and Change in Twentieth-Century Virginia|date=2004|publisher=University of Virginia Press|isbn=9780813924878|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xXI3QHGF4Q8C&amp;pg=PT74&amp;lpg=PT74&amp;dq=Aline+Elizabeth+Black&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7Z0EwN0AKe&amp;sig=cMBbdz-0x8wtNGi6UYW7iG65RQ8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwCWoVChMI6Of_k-nBxwIVgx0-Ch1CwwV6#v=onepage&amp;q=Aline%20Elizabeth%20Black&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morales|first1=Leslie Anderson|title=Aline B.

In 2008 the [[Library of Virginia]] honored Black as part of their Notable African Americans in Virginia History project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lva.virginia.gov/public/trailblazers/2008/index.htm|title=African–American History Month 2008 at the Library of Virginia|website=Library of Virginia|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black also received the Education Association of Norfolk's Backbone Award in 1971, in recognition for her role in establishing educational and professional equality.&lt;ref name="EV" /&gt;

==Background==
Black was born in [[Norfolk, Virginia]] on March 23, 1906 to Charles and Ida Black.&lt;ref name="EV"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tarter|first1=Brent|title=Aline E. Black (1906–1974)|url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Black_Aline_Elizabeth_1906-1974|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Virginia]]|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was educated locally and attended [[Booker T. Washington High School (Norfolk, Virginia)|Booker T. Washington High School]]. Black went on to receive a degree from the [[Virginia Normal and Industrial Institute]] and received a [[Master of Science]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1935.&lt;ref name="EV" /&gt; While in school Black began working as a teacher at Booker T. Washington High School until she lost her job in 1939 as retaliation for a legal case over salary discrimination. After losing her job Black began working on a doctorate of chemistry at New York University, but did not complete the degree.&lt;ref name="EV" /&gt;  Black was re-hired as an employee of the Norfolk School Board in 1941 and resumed her former job as a chemistry teacher. She remained in this job until 1970, after which point she began working at Jacox Junior High School as an instructional development specialist until her retirement in 1973.&lt;ref name="EV" /&gt;

Black married Frank A. Hicks at some point during [[World War II]] and had one daughter. She died in Norfolk on August 22, 1974.

==Legal case==
While she was attending college, Black began working in Norfolk as a science instructor in the public school system. Black received only two-thirds of what a white teacher received for the same job, a common occurrence for African-American educators.&lt;ref name="el"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Earl|title=In Their Own Interests|date=1991|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520066441|pages=160|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3DJJoIwxJHMC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=Aline+Elizabeth+Black&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-yYYDGvVfo&amp;sig=FmKLc91rrXpYwVB_zdkZ_hf1D0w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwC2oVChMI6Of_k-nBxwIVgx0-Ch1CwwV6#v=onepage&amp;q=Aline%20Elizabeth%20Black&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact was the focus of ire from the Norfolk Teachers Association and the Virginia State Teachers Association, who felt that this racial inequality was a violation of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name="RTD"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Borja|first1=Rhea|title=Aline Elizabeth Black Hicks|url=http://www.richmond.com/special-section/black-history/article_9de1880c-6b0b-11e2-95f3-001a4bcf6878.html|publisher=Richmond Times-Dispatch|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1938 Black petitioned the Norfolk School Board to base their educators' salaries on experience and qualifications rather than race or color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bayor|first1=Ronald H.|title=The Columbia Documentary History of Race and Ethnicity in America|date=2004|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231119948|pages=630–632|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KuKZPRCxV3YC&amp;pg=PT1467&amp;lpg=PT1467&amp;dq=Aline+Elizabeth+Black&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=s1XEGz2KoK&amp;sig=AqYeeLKj5CxV6UchB4lWbZH7odE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwADgKahUKEwigpIXXisvIAhXHn4AKHWWIDEs#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Aline%20Elizabeth%20Black%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school board denied her petition, stating that Black had waived any right to contest the pay or seek redress when she signed her yearly contract.&lt;ref name="VP"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clancy|first1=Paul|title=Booker T.

In the meantime the Norfolk School Board retaliated against Black for her lawsuit by not renewing her contract in June 1939. As she was no longer an employee and did not have the standing to sue, the court system denied Black's appeal.&lt;ref name="VP" /&gt; The school board's actions were highly criticized and the focus of a protest on June 24 of the same year.&lt;ref name="VP" /&gt;

Undeterred, the teachers associations produced another plaintiff, Melvin O. Alston, who filed another suit against the school board, ''Alston v. School Board of City of Norfolk''. This lawsuit succeeded in going to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]], who upheld a ruling that teacher salaries fell under the Fourteenth Amendment.&lt;ref name="EV" /&gt;

Gilruth]] (second from left), Director of NASA's [[Space Task Group]], and chief assistants Charles Donlan left), [[Maxime Faget]], and Robert Piland in August 1960 discuss selection of contractors to study feasibility of a manned circumlunar mission]]
The '''Apollo spacecraft feasibility study''' was conducted by [[NASA]] from July 1960 through May 1961 to investigate preliminary designs for a  post-[[Project Mercury]] multi-manned spacecraft to be used for possible [[space station]], circum-lunar, lunar orbital, or manned lunar landing missions. Six-month, $250,000 study contracts were awarded to [[Convair|General Dynamics/Convair]], [[General Electric]], and the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]]. Meanwhile, NASA conducted its own inhouse design study led by [[Maxime Faget]], intended as a gauge of the competitors' entries. The three companies spent varying amounts of their own money in excess of the $250,000 to produce designs which included a ''re-entry module'' separate from the ''mission module'' cabin, and a ''propulsion and equipment module''.

One week after the presentation of the contractors' designs, President [[John F. Kennedy]] committed NASA to a manned lunar landing, giving the [[Apollo program]] an immediate, critical focus. NASA decided to discard the study designs and the mission module cabin, and based the lunar landing mission design on Faget's inhouse design, with a cone-shaped ''command module'', supported by a cylindrical ''service module'' containing return propulsion and supporting equipment. This would be carried to the lunar surface by a still-to-be-defined landing propulsion module. NASA then launched another competition for the command/service module procurement contract.

In December 1961, GE publicly presented their feasibility study design to the [[American Astronautical Society]] . Similarities in the basic mission-command-propulsion module design have been noted to the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Soyuz spacecraft]] designed by [[Sergei Korolev]] and [[Vasily Mishin]].  It has been speculated that Korolev and Mishin could have incorporated GE design elements in the existing [[OKB-1]] Sever designs (1959-1962) &lt;ref name=Korolev&gt;{{cite book |title=Korolev |author=James Harford |publisher=John Wiley &amp;Sons |year=1997 |pages=254–256 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that eventually became the cancelled [[Soyuz-A|Soyuz-A (7K)]] (1963) and approved [[Soyuz 7K-OK]] (1965-1967).&lt;ref name=Soyuz /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wachtel |first=Claude |title=Design Studies of the Vostok-J and Soyuz Spacecraft |journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |volume=35 |issue=2 |date=February 1982 |pages=92|bibcode=1982JBIS...35...92W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In July and August 1960, NASA's [[Space Task Group]] (STG) hosted a series of NASA-industry conferences to discuss post-[[Project Mercury]] manned spacecraft plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brooks|first1=Courtney|last2=Grimwood|first2=James M.|last3=Swenson|first3=Loyd S.|title=Chariots for Apollo: The NASA History of Manned Lunar Spacecraft to 1969|date=2009|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|isbn=978-0486467566|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-4205/ch1-6.html|accessdate=12 October 2014|chapter=1 - Concept to Challenge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deputy Administrator [[Hugh Latimer Dryden|Hugh L. Dryden]] announced at the conference opening that "the next spacecraft beyond Mercury will be called Apollo." &lt;ref name="primingThePipeline"&gt;[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch1-6.html ''Chariots'', ch. 1-6: ''Priming the Pipeline'']&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 30, NASA presented plans to award three [[feasibility study]] contracts for the Apollo spacecraft, conceived as a three-man Earth orbital and circumlunar craft, with growth potential for manned lunar landings.&lt;ref name="primingThePipeline" /&gt; A [[Request for proposal|Request For Proposal]] was issued on September 12, and fourteen bids were received by October 9. On October 25, NASA awarded the $250,000, six-month contracts to [[Convair|General Dynamics/Convair]], [[General Electric]], and the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]].&lt;ref name="chariots_feasibility"&gt;[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch1-7.html ''Chariots'', ch. 1-7:''The Feasibility Studies'']&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, members of the Space Task Group performed their own spacecraft design studies, to serve as a gauge to judge and monitor the three industry designs.&lt;ref name="chariots_feasibility"/&gt;

All three competitors supplemented the $250,000 contracts with their own money: Convair spent $1 million, GE $2 million, and Martin $3 million.&lt;ref name="chariots_portents"&gt;[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch1-8.html ''Chariots'', ch. 1-8:''Portents for Apollo'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Manager of GE Space Vehicle Systems (Philadelphia), George Arthur, led the GE proposal team that included Harold Bloom, Charles Bixler, Jacob Abel, and Arnold Cohen.  On May 15 to 17, 1961, the contractors presented their study results to NASA. All three designs employed a ''mission module'' cabin separate from the ''command module'' (piloting and re-entry cabin), and a ''propulsion and equipment module''. Martin studied three different reentry module shapes, including a conical capsule vehicle similar to the STG configuration. GE also studied several reentry module shapes.  GD/Convair's proposal employed a lifting body shape.&lt;ref name="chariots_portents"/&gt;

==Designs==

===GD/Convair===
[[File:Apollo spacecraft feasibility study General Dynamics.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Model of General Dynamics Corporation's proposed Apollo circumlunar mission design]]
Convair/Astronautics' entry was designed primarily for lunar orbit, with flexibility and growth potential built in to accommodate lunar landing. The company estimated a total program cost of $1.25 billion over about six years.

Convair selected a [[lifting body]] for the return vehicle (command module), similar to one conceived several years earlier by [[Alfred J. Eggers]] of [[Ames Research Center|NASA-Ames]]. This had an [[launch escape system|abort tower]] attached through launch, and nestled inside a large mission module. Convair/Astronautics envisioned a progressive flight development plan, with many Earth-orbital missions before attempting circumlunar, and then lunar-orbital missions. Earth landings would be by glidesail parachute near San Antonio, Texas. The development flights would experiment with [[space rendezvous]], [[docking and berthing of spacecraft|docking]], [[artificial gravity]], and maneuverable landing, leading to an eventual lunar landing. The study cost the contractor about $1 million.&lt;ref name="chariots_portents"/&gt;

===GE D-2===
[[File:Apollo D-2 Diagrams.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Cross section of the GE D-2 submission, showing complete spacecraft and descent module]]
GE's design capitalized upon hardware almost ready to fly: a bullet-shaped descent module, carried between a conical mission module cabin containing life support and avionics, and the cylindrical propulsion module. The entire craft was {{convert|33.4|ft|m}} long, with one innovation: a cocoonlike wrapping for secondary pressure protection in case of cabin leaks or meteoroid puncture. Had this configuration been selected, the payload sent to the Moon would have resembled the [[nose cone]] flown on the early [[Saturn I]] rockets. Although GE did not estimate the final costs in its summary, the company was confident of achieving circumlunar flight by the end of 1966 and lunar-orbital flight shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="chariots_portents"/&gt;

Seeking professional recognition for their design work on the GE proposal, George Arthur and Jacob Abel publicly presented their papers documenting the GE D-2 design in December 1961 at a special symposium of the [[American Astronautical Society]] in Denver, Colorado.&lt;ref name="AAS"&gt;Arthur, George R, "Lunar Spacecraft Designs", Advanced in the Astronautical Sciences, Volume 10, 1963, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Martin===
[[File:Apollo spacecraft feasibility study Martin.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Employees of the Martin Company display models of their top three command module designs, and proposal materials]]
The Martin Company spent about $3 million, employing almost 300 persons for the better part of the six-month term, to produce the most elaborate study of the three, not only following all the Space Task Group guidelines, but also going far beyond in [[systems analysis]]. The complete proposal consisted of 9,000 pages. Focusing on versatility, flexibility, safety margins, and growth, this was the only study that detailed the progression of steps from lunar orbiting to lunar landing. Martin's spacecraft would have been similar to the Apollo spacecraft that ultimately emerged. When Martin later entered the Apollo hardware procurement contract competition, NASA scored them highest of all the entrants on configuration design.&lt;ref name="chariots_portents"/&gt;

Martin recommended a five-part spacecraft. The command module was a flat-bottomed cone with a rounded apex and a tower for a tractor-rocket [[launch escape system]]. Behind the flat aft bulkhead were propulsion, equipment, and mission modules. Tradeoffs between weight and propulsion requirements led to the selection of a pressurized shell of [[semimonocoque]] aluminum alloy coated with a composite heatshield of superalloy with a [[atmospheric entry#ablative|charring ablator]]. Two crewmen would sit abreast, with the third behind, in couches that could rotate for [[atmospheric entry|reentry]] [[g-force|g-load]] protection and for getting in and out of the spacecraft. Flaps for limited maneuverability on reentry, a parachute landing system, and a jettisonable mission module that could also serve as a [[solar flare|solar storm]] cellar, a laboratory, or even the descent stage for a lunar lander, were also featured.&lt;ref name="chariots_portents"/&gt;

==Spacecraft procurement competition==
[[File:Kennedy Giving Historic Speech to Congress - GPN-2000-001658.jpg|right|thumb|President Kennedy proposes a manned lunar landing program to Congress]]
NASA did not get a chance to deliberate long on the study results, due to the pressure placed on America's space program by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]'s [[Vostok 1|launching of the first man in space]], [[Yuri Gagarin]], on April 12, 1961. On May 25, one week after presentation of the study results, President [[John F. Kennedy]] proposed the Moon landing objective to the US Congress, giving the Apollo program a clear focus and sense of urgency.&lt;ref&gt;https://history.nasa.gov/moondec.html Kennedy speech&lt;/ref&gt; NASA turned its focus to what relevant data could be mined from the proposals (abandoning the mission module), and launched another competition for the hardware procurement phase, fixing the reentry module configuration to the conical shape designed by [[Maxime Faget]].&lt;ref name="chariots_challenge"&gt;[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch1-9.html ''Chariots'', ch. 1-9:''The Challenge'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chariots_contracting"&gt;[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch2-1.html ''Chariots'', ch. 2-1:''May through December 1961'']&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA awarded the contract for the [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] (CSM) to [[North American Aviation]] on November 28, 1961, when it was still assumed the lunar landing would be achieved by direct descent or Earth orbit rendezvous rather than by [[lunar orbit rendezvous]].&lt;ref name='chariots2-5'&gt;[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch2-5.html ''Chariots'', ch. 2-5:''Contracting for the Command Module'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-4204/ch4-7.html |title=Moonport: A History of Apollo Launch Facilities and Operations |author1=Benson, Charles D. |author2=William Barnaby Faherty |publisher=NASA (SP-4204) |date=1978 |chapter=4-8 |accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, design proceeded without a means of docking the Command Module to a [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar lander spacecraft]]. 
In the summer of 1962, the selection of the LOR proposal from NASA's Langley Research Center,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/Rendezvous.html |title=The Rendezvous That Was Almost Missed: Lunar Orbit Rendezvous and the Apollo Program |publisher=NASA Langley Research Center |date=December 1992 |accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; plus several technical obstacles encountered in some subsystems (such as environmental control), soon made it clear that substantial redesign would be required.  By 1963, NASA decided the most efficient way to keep the Apollo program on track and address technical obstacles encountered in some subsystems such as environmental control, was to proceed with the development of two CSM versions: the preliminary Block I, and the advanced Block II.&lt;ref name='chariots5-1'&gt;[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch5-1.html ''Chariots'', ch. 5-1:''Command Modules and Program Changes'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similarity to Soyuz==
[[File:Soyuz-TMA parts.jpg|thumb|right|The Soyuz TMA spacecraft uses a separate orbital (mission) module in front of a descent module shaped similarly to that of the GE D-2.]]
Similarities have been noted between the GE D2 design and the Russian [[Soyuz spacecraft]], which was designed and built after George Arthur and Jacob Abel's AAS presentation (Denver, CO) in December 1961.&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt; In particular, Soyuz uses an orbital module located in front of the descent module, which uses a similar sphere-cone-sphere shape.

Victor Minenko, one of the OKB-1 designers with Korolev in 1950s and 1960s, who was active with RSC Energia in 1993, noted that in 1961 there were 40 people in several departments working on early designs and versions of the eventual Soyuz.  "We use to read carefully the U.S. literature by the leading astrodynamicists - Ferri, Chapman, Van Driest, Lees, and the top Russians - Sibulkin, Koropkin".  Vassily Mishin, chief Soyuz designer after Korolev's death, noted that a logical comparison of the ''Soyuz'' was to the US Apollo command/service module, since both were designed for lunar transport.&lt;ref name="Korolev"/&gt;

In 1983, Phillip S. Clark and Ralph F. Gibbons discussed the Russian Soyuz program development (1963-1967) and adaptation of design elements from other programs and studies (Soviet and foreign).&lt;ref name=Soyuz&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Phillip S. |last2=Gibbons |first2=Ralph F. |date=October 1983 |title=The Evolution of the Soyuz Program |journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |volume=36 |issue=10 |pages=443 |publisher=British Interplanetary Society |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar modular design was used in the Russian [[Progress spacecraft]] (essentially the unmanned version of Soyuz), the Chinese [[Shenzhou spacecraft]], and the planned Indian [[ISRO Orbital Vehicle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futron.com/upload/wysiwyg/Resources/Whitepapers/China_n_%20Second_Space_Age_1003.pdf |title=China and the Second Space Age |accessdate=6 February 2013 |publisher=Futron Corporation |year=2003 |author=Futron Corp. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419165427/http://www.futron.com/upload/wysiwyg/Resources/Whitepapers/China_n_%20Second_Space_Age_1003.pdf |archivedate=19 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barry Bozeman''' is a professor at [[Arizona State University]] where he is Director, Center for Organization Research and Design, and Arizona Centennial Professor of Technology Policy and Public Management.  He specializes in two disparate fields, [[organizational theory|organization theory]] and [[technology policy|science and technology policy]].

== Early life and education ==
Bozeman was born in Birmingham, Alabama on January 18, 1947 to Glenn Bozeman and Audrey J. Bozeman (née Martin).  His mother was a full-time homemaker and this father a construction worker. His early life was characterized by much family relocation, resulting in his attending 21 different schools before the 7th grade.  In 1960, the family settled down in West Palm Beach Florida and Bozeman graduated from Palm Beach High School in 1964.  He attended [[Palm Beach State College|Palm Beach High Junior College]], in Lake Worth Florida, (now Palm Beach State College), graduating in 1966.  Bozeman played on the varsity baseball team at Palm Beach Junior College where he had the distinction of scoring the first run in the new team’s history.

== Career ==
In 1970, Bozeman entered the doctoral program in political science at [[Ohio State University]], focusing on public policy studies.  He graduated in 1973 and, that same year, began as an Assistant Professor of Political Science at [[Georgia Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gatech.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; During that period, he began specializing in Science and Technology Policy and in 1974, as part of the Intergovernmental Personnel Act, took a position as an analyst in the [https://www.nsf.gov/dir/index.jsp?org=CISE National Science Foundation’s Division of Information Science and Technology].  After returning briefly to Georgia Tech, Bozeman took a job at the [[University of Missouri|University of Missouri-Columbia]], where he was appointed in the Department of Political Science, as well as the new Department of Public Administration.  In 1977, Bozeman began a long stay (1977-1993) at [https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/ Syracuse University’s Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs].  While at Syracuse, Bozeman was the Director of the Doctoral Program (1979-1986) and was the founding director of the Center for Technology and Information Policy. He moved in 1993 to be the first full-time director of the new School of Public Policy at Georgia Tech and was later appointed as Regent’s Professor, the first social scientist to become a Regent’s Professor at Georgia Tech. In 2006, Bozeman moved to [http://www.uga.edu/ University of Georgia] where he became the first holder of the [https://spa.asu.edu/about_us/directory/faculty-profiles/barry-bozeman Department of Public Administration and Policy’s Ander Crenshaw Chair in Public Policy].&lt;ref&gt;https://spa.asu.edu/about_us/directory/faculty-profiles/barry-bozeman&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Bozeman moved to Arizona State University where he is Arizona Centennial Professor of Technology Policy and Public Management and Director of the Center for Organization Research and Design.&lt;ref&gt;https://spa.asu.edu/about_us/directory/faculty-profiles/barry-bozeman&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scholarly contributions ==
Bozeman’s chief contributions to organization theory and public administration include:

*The theory of “dimensional publicness,” showing all organizations are affected by the constraints and endowment of political authority and of market authority and that behavior can be predicted from the mix of these forces.
*The normative “public value theory,” set as an alternative to market failure theory and suggesting that public values can be attained by a variety of institutions, public and private, acting separately or together. 
*Theory and empirical research on organizational red tape and bureaucratic pathologies.

Bozeman’s chief contributions to science and technology policy include:
*Research and theory on technology transfer, suggesting that a wide variety of outcome measures should be embraced (“contingent theory of effectiveness”) rather than solely short-term market impacts.
*Research and theory on scientific collaboration, both at the level of the individual researcher and the scientific organization or research center.

== Personal life ==
Barry Bozeman and his wife Monica Gaughan live in Tempe, Arizona.  Dr. Gaughan, a sociologist, is a faculty member at Arizona State University. Bozeman has two children from an earlier marriage, a son John and a daughter Brandyn.

The '''Breakthrough of the Year''' is an annual award made by the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] journal, ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', for the most significant development in scientific research. Originating in 1989 as the ''Molecule of the Year'', and inspired by ''Time''{{'s}} [[Time Magazine Person of the Year|Man of the Year]], it was renamed the Breakthrough of the Year in 1996. The Breakthrough of the Year is widely recognized as one of the highest distinctions in science.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

'''Curt Eisner''' (born April 28, 1890 in [[Zabrze]] - died December 30, 1981 in [[The Hague]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[entomologist]] who specialised in snow [[butterflies]] or [[Parnassinae]]. His collections of Parnassinae are in [[Naturalis]], in Leiden, and his [[Ornithoptera]] and [[Morphinae|Morphidae]] are in the [[Museum für Naturkunde]] in [[Berlin]].

The second [[driverless car]] competition of the [[DARPA Grand Challenge]] was a {{convert|212|km|mi|abbr=on}} off-road course that began at 6:40am on October 8, 2005, near the California/Nevada state line.   All but one of the 23 finalists in the 2005 race surpassed the {{convert|11.78|km|mi|abbr=on}} distance completed by the best vehicle in the [[DARPA Grand Challenge (2004)|2004 race]].  Five  vehicles successfully completed the course:

[[File:BeerBottlePass.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Beer Bottle Pass]]
Vehicles in the 2005 race passed through three narrow tunnels and navigated more than 100 sharp left and right turns.  The race concluded through [[Beer Bottle Pass]], a winding mountain pass with sheer drop-offs on both sides.  Although the 2004 course had required more elevation gain and some very sharp switchbacks (Daggett Ridge) had been required near the beginning of the route, it had had far fewer curves and generally wider roads than the 2005 course.

The natural rivalry between the teams from [[Stanford]] and [[Carnegie Mellon]] ([[Sebastian Thrun]], head of the Stanford team was previously a faculty member at Carnegie Mellon and colleague of [[Red Whittaker]], head of the CMU team) was played out during the race.  Mechanical problems plagued H1ghlander before it was passed by Stanley.  Gray Team’s entry was a miracle in itself, as the team from the suburbs of New Orleans was caught in [[Hurricane Katrina]] a few short months before the race.  The fifth finisher, Terramax, a 30,000 pound entry from [[Oshkosh Truck|Oshkosh]] Truck, finished on the second day.  The huge truck spent the night idling on the course, and was particularly nimble in carefully picking its way down the narrow roads of Beer Bottle Pass.

== National Qualification Event (NQE) ==

Of the original 195 applicants, initially 40 teams were selected to participate in the National Qualification Event (NQE). Three teams were added on Aug. 23, 2005 to the semi-finalist 40 teams who were selected from site visits, sending 43 teams to the NQE.

The National Qualification Event was held at [[California Speedway]] in [[Fontana, California|Fontana]] from September 27 through October 5.  The results of the NQE were used to cut the 43 teams down to 23 for the race on October 8.

Vehicle performances at the NQE were judged by (1) elapsed time to complete the course; (2) number of obstacles successfully passed without contact; (3) number of gates successfully passed.  DARPA did not reveal the relative importance of these three factors.  DARPA's final ranking of the vehicles, for purposes of pole position in the Grand Challenge Event (GCE), may have been partly subjective.

The results of the 2005 DARPA NQEs are shown below sorted top to bottom by runs completed and gates passed, compiled from [http://archive.darpa.mil/grandchallenge05/gcorg/index.html DARPA's published NQE results].  This ordering does not correspond to DARPA's ranking of team performance.  (For example, this ordering does not reflect speed as an element of performance.)  Teams highlighted in green were the teams that DARPA selected to participate in the Grand Challenge desert race.

There were four NQE runs. The above four major columns are sorted from worst to best runs of each team. "Time" signifies the time in minutes for a completed run and "x" indicates an incomplete run.  "Gates" indicates the number of gates along the track that were passed (there were 50 total per run).  "Obstacles" indicates the number of obstacles on the track that were passed (there were 5 total per run).  "Finishes" indicates the total number of runs that the team successfully completed (there were 4 runs total). "Total Gates" indicates the total number of gates that the team successfully passed.  The teams are sorted from top to bottom according to runs completed and then by total gates passed.  Teams indicated as a "desert race participant" are those teams invited by DARPA to participate in the Grand Challenge desert race.  [http://archive.darpa.mil/grandchallenge05/gcorg/index.html Source data]

For the first and second run, only 4 obstacles were present whereas for the third and fourth runs 5 obstacles were present. The NQE results presented in the table above show each team's runs sorted left to right from their worst run to their best run in order to better illustrate relative ranking (i.e. not in order of the actual run sequence).

On October 6, the selected teams transported their robots to the starting location.  On October 7 the teams had a day to fix any portions of the robots broken in the course of transportation prior to the actual race.

==Race==

''A Google Talk video about the DARPA 2005 race is available at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDqzyd7fDRc YouTube]''

The route to be followed by the robots was supplied to the teams two hours before the start as a computer file with [[GPS]] coordinates, one every 72 m (237&amp;nbsp;feet) of the route, with more frequent waypoints in difficult patches. Some teams used topographic maps and aerial imagery to manually map out and program precise path and speed settings. Once the race had started, the robots were not allowed to contact humans in any way.

Each robot started at a different time and was "paused" for different amounts of time during the race; DARPA compensated for the staggered start times and subtracted the pause time from each robot's total to derive its final official time.  The $2 million prize was awarded on Sunday, October 9, 2005.

The 2005 competitors were much more successful than those of 2004; only one failed to pass the {{convert|11.84|km|mi|abbr=on}} mark set by the best-performing 2004 entry, [[Sandstorm (vehicle)|Sandstorm]].  By the end, 18 robots had been disabled and five robots finished the course.  On the first day, [[Stanley (vehicle)|Stanley]] from [[Stanford University]], and [[H1ghlander]] and [[Sandstorm (vehicle)|Sandstorm]] from [[Carnegie Mellon University]], finished within minutes of each other, with Stanley crossing the finish line first.  [[Kat-5 (vehicle)|Kat-5]] from Gray Team started much later, but finished in a comparable time.  The race paused overnight with one competitor, TerraMax, left on the course at mile 83; TerraMax had the stage to itself on Sunday as it belatedly rumbled home.
    
The winner of the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge was Stanley, with a course time of 6 hours 53 minutes and 8 seconds (6:53:08) with average speed of 30.7&amp;nbsp;km/h (19.1&amp;nbsp;mph).  CMU's Sandstorm followed with 7:04:50 at 29.9&amp;nbsp;km/h (18.6&amp;nbsp;mph) and H1ghlander at 7:14:00 at  29.3&amp;nbsp;km/h (18.2&amp;nbsp;mph).  Gray Team's Kat-5 came through at 7:30:16 with average speed of 28.2&amp;nbsp;km/h (17.5&amp;nbsp;mph).  Oshkosh Truck's Terramax finished at 12:51 and would not have been eligible for the prize because it exceeded the ten-hour limit.

The [http://archive.darpa.mil/grandchallenge05/gcorg/index.html Official Website] (requires Flash player plugin) contained a map and positions of the competitors, while [http://www.tgdaily.com/2005/10/08/darpagrandchallenge2005/ TG Daily] posted a running summary of the day's events.

A '''documentary collection''' is a process in which a [[seller]] instructs their [[bank]] to forward [[document]]s related to the [[export]] of goods to a [[buyer]]'s bank with a request to present these documents to the buyer for [[payment]], indicating when and on what conditions these documents can be released to the buyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Trade Finance Guide: A Quick Reference for U.S. Exporters|journal=International Trade Administration|volume=1|page=9|url=http://www.export.gov/static/TradeFinanceGuide_Ch04_Latest_eg_main_055034.pdf|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The buyer may obtain possession of goods and clear them through [[customs]], if the buyer has the shipping documents (original [[bill of lading]], [[certificate of origin]], etc.). The documents, however, are only released to the buyer after payment has been made ("Documents against Payment") or payment undertaking has been given - the buyer has accepted a [[bill of exchange]] issued by the seller and payable at a certain date in the future ([[maturity date]]) ("Documents against Acceptance").

Documentary Collections facilitate [[import]]/export operations. They do not provide the same level of security as [[Letters of credit|Letters of Credit]], but, as a result, the costs are lower. Unlike the Letters of Credit, for a Documentary Collection, the bank acts as a channel for the documents but does not issue any [[payment covenant]]s (does not guarantee payment). The bank that has received a documentary collection may [[debit]] the buyer's account and make payment only if authorised by the buyer.

Possibilities and advantages:

Make [[international trade]] operations more flexible,
Use Documentary Collection in cases when the seller does not want to deliver goods to the buyer on "open account" basis, but due to a long-term stable business relationship between the parties there is no need for security provided by a Letter of Credit or [[payment guarantee]],
Documentary collection is suitable to the seller:
if the seller has no doubts about the buyer's ability to meet its payment obligations,
if the political and economic situation in the buyer's country is stable,
if there are no [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] restrictions in the seller's country;
Documentary collection is convenient for the buyer because:
there is no need for an [[advance payment]]; payment for goods can be made when shipping documents have been received,
in cases of documents released against acceptance the buyer has the possibility to sell the goods first and afterwards make payment to the seller.
Documentary Collection assures the seller that the shipping documents will be released to the buyer only upon payment or acceptance of a Bill of Exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swedbank.lv/eng/pakalp/jr_5_3_4.php |title=Documentary Collection - Swedbank |publisher=Swedbank.lv |date= |accessdate=2011-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Thermodynamics|laws}}

The '''first law of thermodynamics''' is a version of the law of [[conservation of energy]], adapted for [[thermodynamic system]]s. The law of conservation of energy states that the total [[energy]] of an [[isolated system]] is constant; energy can be transformed from one form to another, but can be neither created nor destroyed. The first law is often formulated&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mandl|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The sign convention (Q is heat supplied ''to'' the system as, W is work done ''by'' the system) is that of [[Rudolf Clausius]], and it will be followed below.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta U = Q - W.&lt;/math&gt;

It states that the change in the [[internal energy]] {{math|Δ''U''}} of a [[Thermodynamic system#Closed system|closed system]] is equal to the amount of [[heat]] {{mvar|Q}} supplied ''to'' the system, minus the amount of [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] {{mvar|W}} done ''by'' the system on its surroundings. An equivalent statement is that [[perpetual motion machines]] of the first kind are impossible.

==History==
Investigations into the nature of heat and work and their relationship began with the invention of the first engines used to extract water from mines. Improvements to such engines so as to increase their efficiency and power output came first from mechanics that worked with such machines but only slowly advanced the art. Deeper investigations that placed those on a mathematical and physics basis came later.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The first law of thermodynamics was developed empirically over about half a century. The first full statements of the law came in 1850 from [[Rudolf Clausius]] and from [[William Rankine]]; Rankine's statement is considered less distinct relative to Clausius'.&lt;ref name="Truesdell, C. A. 1980"/&gt; A main aspect of the struggle was to deal with the previously proposed [[caloric theory]] of heat.

In 1840, [[Germain Hess]] stated a [[Hess's Law|conservation law]] for the so-called 'heat of reaction' for chemical reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hess | first1 = H. | year = 1840 | title = Thermochemische Untersuchungen | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k151359/f397.image.r=Annalen%20der%20Physik%20(Leipzig)%20125.langEN | journal = Annalen der Physik und Chemie | volume = 126 | issue = 6| pages = 385–404 | doi=10.1002/andp.18401260620|bibcode = 1840AnP...126..385H }}&lt;/ref&gt; His law was later recognized as a consequence of the first law of thermodynamics, but Hess's statement was not explicitly concerned with the relation between energy exchanges by heat and work.

According to [[Clifford Truesdell|Truesdell]] (1980), [[Julius Robert von Mayer]] in 1841 made a statement that meant that "in a process at constant pressure, the heat used to produce expansion is universally interconvertible with work", but this is not a general statement of the first law.&lt;ref&gt;Truesdell, C. A. (1980), pp. 157–158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, Robert (1841). Paper: 'Remarks on the Forces of Nature"; as quoted in: Lehninger, A. (1971). Bioenergetics – the Molecular Basis of Biological Energy Transformations, 2nd. Ed. London: The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Original statements: the "thermodynamic approach"===
The original nineteenth century statements of the first law of thermodynamics appeared in a conceptual framework in which transfer of energy as heat was taken as a [[primitive notion]], not defined or constructed by the theoretical development of the framework, but rather presupposed as prior to it and already accepted. The primitive notion of heat was taken as empirically established, especially through calorimetry regarded as a subject in its own right, prior to thermodynamics. Jointly primitive with this notion of heat were the notions of empirical temperature and thermal equilibrium. This framework also took as primitive the notion of transfer of energy as work. This framework did not presume a concept of energy in general, but regarded it as derived or synthesized from the prior notions of heat and work. By one author, this framework has been called the "thermodynamic" approach.&lt;ref name="Bailyn 79"&gt;Bailyn, M. (1994), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first explicit statement of the first law of thermodynamics, by [[Rudolf Clausius]] in 1850, referred to cyclic thermodynamic processes.

::''In all cases in which work is produced by the agency of heat, a quantity of heat is consumed which is proportional to the work done; and conversely, by the expenditure of an equal quantity of work an equal quantity of heat is produced.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Rudolf Clausius|Clausius, R.]] (1850), page 373, translation here taken from Truesdell, C. A. (1980), pp. 188–189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clausius also stated the law in another form, referring to the existence of a function of state of the system, the [[internal energy]], and expressed it in terms of a differential equation for the increments of a thermodynamic process.&lt;ref&gt;Clausius, R. (1850), p. 384, equation (IIa.).&lt;/ref&gt; This equation may be described as follows:

::''In a thermodynamic process involving a closed system, the increment in the internal energy is equal to the difference between the heat accumulated by the system and the work done by it.''

Because of its definition in terms of increments, the value of the internal energy of a system is not uniquely defined. It is defined only up to an arbitrary additive constant of integration, which can be adjusted to give arbitrary reference zero levels. This non-uniqueness is in keeping with the abstract mathematical nature of the internal energy. The internal energy is customarily stated relative to a conventionally chosen standard reference state of the system.

The concept of internal energy is considered by Bailyn to be of "enormous interest". Its quantity cannot be immediately measured, but can only be inferred, by differencing actual immediate measurements. Bailyn likens it to the energy states of an atom, that were revealed by Bohr's energy relation ''hν'' = ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''{{'}}{{'}}&lt;/sub&gt; − ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''{{'}}&lt;/sub&gt;. In each case, an unmeasurable quantity (the internal energy, the atomic energy level) is revealed by considering the difference of measured quantities (increments of internal energy, quantities of emitted or absorbed radiative energy).&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, M. (1994), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conceptual revision: the "mechanical approach"===
In 1907, [[George H. Bryan]] wrote about systems between which there is no transfer of matter (closed systems): "'''Definition.''' When energy flows from one system or part of a system to another otherwise than by the performance of mechanical work, the energy so transferred is called ''heat''."&lt;ref&gt;[[George H. Bryan|Bryan, G. H.]] (1907), p. 47. Also Bryan had written about this in the ''Enzyklopädie der Mathematischen Wissenschaften'', volume 3, p. 81. Also in 1906 [[Jean Baptiste Perrin]] wrote about it in ''Bull. de la société français de philosophie'', volume 6, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition may be regarded as expressing a conceptual revision, as follows. This was systematically expounded in 1909 by [[Constantin Carathéodory]], whose attention had been drawn to it by [[Max Born]]. Largely through Born's&lt;ref name="Born 1949 {{math|V}}"/&gt; influence, this revised conceptual approach to the definition of heat came to be preferred by many twentieth-century writers. It might be called the "mechanical approach".&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, M. (1994), pp. 65, 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy can also be transferred from one thermodynamic system to another in association with transfer of matter. Born points out that in general such energy transfer is not resolvable uniquely into work and heat moieties. In general, when there is transfer of energy associated with matter transfer, work and heat transfers can be distinguished only when they pass through walls physically separate from those for matter transfer.

The "mechanical" approach postulates the law of conservation of energy. It also postulates that energy can be transferred from one thermodynamic system to another [[Adiabatic process|adiabatically]] as work, and that energy can be held as the internal energy of a thermodynamic system. It also postulates that energy can be transferred from one thermodynamic system to another by a path that is non-adiabatic, and is unaccompanied by matter transfer. Initially, it "cleverly" (according to Bailyn) refrains from labelling as 'heat' such non-adiabatic, unaccompanied transfer of energy. It rests on the primitive notion of [[Adiabatic enclosure|''walls'']], especially adiabatic walls and non-adiabatic walls, defined as follows. Temporarily, only for purpose of this definition, one can prohibit transfer of energy as work across a wall of interest. Then walls of interest fall into two classes, (a) those such that arbitrary systems separated by them remain independently in their own previously established respective states of internal thermodynamic equilibrium; they are defined as adiabatic; and (b) those without such independence; they are defined as non-adiabatic.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, (1994), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach derives the notions of transfer of energy as heat, and of temperature, as theoretical developments, not taking them as primitives. It regards calorimetry as a derived theory. It has an early origin in the nineteenth century, for example in the work of [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]],&lt;ref&gt;Helmholtz, H. (1847).&lt;/ref&gt; but also in the work of many others.&lt;ref name="Bailyn 79"/&gt;

==Conceptually revised statement, according to the mechanical approach==
The revised statement of the first law postulates that a change in the internal energy of a system due to any arbitrary process, that takes the system from a given initial thermodynamic state to a given final equilibrium thermodynamic state, can be determined through the physical existence, for those given states, of a reference process that occurs purely through stages of adiabatic work.

The revised statement is then

::''For a closed system, in any arbitrary process of interest that takes it from an initial to a final state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, the change of internal energy is the same as that for a reference adiabatic work process that links those two states. This is so regardless of the path of the process of interest, and regardless of whether it is an adiabatic or a non-adiabatic process. The reference adiabatic work process may be chosen arbitrarily from amongst the class of all such processes.''

This statement is much less close to the empirical basis than are the original statements,&lt;ref name="Pippard 15"/&gt; but is often regarded as conceptually parsimonious in that it rests only on the concepts of adiabatic work and of non-adiabatic processes, not on the concepts of transfer of energy as heat and of empirical temperature that are presupposed by the original statements. Largely through the influence of [[Max Born]], it is often regarded as theoretically preferable because of this conceptual parsimony. Born particularly observes that the revised approach avoids thinking in terms of what he calls the "imported engineering" concept of heat engines.&lt;ref name="Born 1949 {{math|V}}"&gt;[[Max Born|Born, M.]] (1949), Lecture {{math|V}}, pp. 31–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Basing his thinking on the mechanical approach, Born in 1921, and again in 1949, proposed to revise the definition of heat.&lt;ref name="Born 1949 {{math|V}}"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Born 1921"/&gt; In particular, he referred to the work of [[Constantin Carathéodory]], who had in 1909 stated the first law without defining quantity of heat.&lt;ref name="Carathéodory 1909"/&gt; Born's definition was specifically for transfers of energy without transfer of matter, and it has been widely followed in textbooks (examples:&lt;ref name="Münster 23 24"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reif 122"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haase 1971"/&gt;).  Born observes that a transfer of matter between two systems is accompanied by a transfer of internal energy that cannot be resolved into heat and work components. There can be pathways to other systems, spatially separate from that of the matter transfer, that allow heat and work transfer independent of and simultaneous with the matter transfer. Energy is conserved in such transfers.

==Description==
===Cyclic processes===
The first law of thermodynamics for a closed system was expressed in two ways by Clausius. One way referred to cyclic processes and the inputs and outputs of the system, but did not refer to increments in the internal state of the system. The other way referred to an incremental change in the internal state of the system, and did not expect the process to be cyclic.

A cyclic process is one that can be repeated indefinitely often, returning the system to its initial state. Of particular interest for single cycle of a cyclic process are the net work done, and the net heat taken in (or 'consumed', in Clausius' statement), by the system.

In a cyclic process in which the system does net work on its surroundings, it is observed to be physically necessary not only that heat be taken into the system, but also, importantly, that some heat leave the system. The difference is the heat converted by the cycle into work. In each repetition of a cyclic process, the net work done by the system, measured in mechanical units, is proportional to the heat consumed, measured in calorimetric units.

The constant of proportionality is universal and independent of the system and in 1845 and 1847 was measured by [[James Prescott Joule|James Joule]], who described it as the ''[[mechanical equivalent of heat]]''.

===Sign conventions===
In a non-cyclic process, the change in the internal energy of a system is equal to net energy added as [[heat]] to the system minus the net [[Work (physics)|work]] done by the system, both being measured in mechanical units.  Taking {{math|Δ''U''}} as a change in internal energy, one writes

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta U = Q\, - \, W\,\,\,\,\mathrm{(sign\,convention\,of\,Clausius\,and\,generally\,in\,this\,article)},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''Q''}} denotes the net quantity of heat supplied to the system by its surroundings and {{math|''W''}} denotes the net work done by the system. This sign convention is implicit in Clausius' statement of the law given above. It originated with the study of [[heat engine]]s that produce useful work by consumption of heat.

Often nowadays, however, writers use the [[IUPAC]] convention by which the first law is formulated with work done on the system by its surroundings having a positive sign. With this now often used sign convention for work, the first law for a closed system may be written:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta U = Q + W\,\,\,\,\mathrm{(sign\,convention\,of\,IUPAC)}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.iupac.org/publications/books/gbook/IUPAC-GB3-2ndPrinting-Online-22apr2011.pdf Quantities, Units and Symbols in Physical Chemistry (IUPAC Green Book)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027103406/http://media.iupac.org/publications/books/gbook/IUPAC-GB3-2ndPrinting-Online-22apr2011.pdf |date=October 27, 2016}} See Sec. 2.11 Chemical Thermodynamics p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

This convention follows physicists such as [[Max Planck]],&lt;ref&gt;Planck, M. (1897/1903). [https://web.archive.org/web/20081008024138/http://www.archive.org/details/treatiseonthermo00planrich ''Treatise on Thermodynamics'', translated by A. Ogg, Longmans, Green &amp; Co., London.], p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; and considers all net energy transfers to the system as positive and all net energy transfers from the system as negative, irrespective of any use for the system as an engine or other device.

When a system expands in a fictive [[quasistatic process]], the work done by the system on the environment is the product, {{math|''P''&amp;nbsp;d''V''}}, &amp;nbsp;of pressure, {{math|''P''}}, and volume change, {{math|d''V''}}, whereas the work done ''on'' the system is {{math|&amp;nbsp;-''P''&amp;nbsp;d''V''}}.&amp;nbsp; Using either sign convention for work, the change in internal energy of the system is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm d U = \delta Q - P \, \mathrm d V\,\,\,\,\text{(quasi-static process)},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''δQ''}} denotes the infinitesimal amount of heat supplied to the system from its surroundings.

Work and heat are expressions of actual physical processes of supply or removal of energy, while the internal energy {{math|''U''}} is a mathematical abstraction that keeps account of the exchanges of energy that befall the system. Thus the term heat for {{math|''Q''}} means "that amount of energy added or removed by conduction of heat or by thermal radiation", rather than referring to a form of energy within the system. Likewise, the term work energy for {{math|''W''}} means "that amount of energy gained or lost as the result of work". Internal energy is a property of the system whereas work done and heat supplied are not. A significant result of this distinction is that a given internal energy change {{math|Δ''U''}} can be achieved by, in principle, many combinations of heat and work.

==Various statements of the law for closed systems==
The law is of great importance and generality and is consequently thought of from several points of view. Most careful textbook statements of the law express it for closed systems. It is stated in several ways, sometimes even by the same author.&lt;ref name="Bailyn 79"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Münster, A. (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;

For the thermodynamics of closed systems, the distinction between transfers of energy as work and as heat is central and is within the scope of the present article. For the thermodynamics of [[Thermodynamic system#Open system|open systems]], such a distinction is beyond the scope of the present article, but some limited comments are made on it in the section below headed [[First law of thermodynamics#First law of thermodynamics for open systems|'First law of thermodynamics for open systems']].

There are two main ways of stating a law of thermodynamics, physically or mathematically. They should be logically coherent and consistent with one another.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Gamble Kirkwood|Kirkwood, J. G.]], Oppenheim, I. (1961), pp. 31–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a physical statement is that of [[Max Planck|Planck]] (1897/1903):

:It is in no way possible, either by mechanical, thermal, chemical, or other devices, to obtain perpetual motion, i.e. it is impossible to construct an engine which will work in a cycle and produce continuous work, or kinetic energy, from nothing.&lt;ref&gt;Planck, M. (1897/1903), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

This physical statement is restricted neither to closed systems nor to systems with states that are strictly defined only for thermodynamic equilibrium; it has meaning also for open systems and for systems with states that are not in thermodynamic equilibrium.

An example of a mathematical statement is that of Crawford (1963):

::::::For a given system we let {{math|Δ''E''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kin&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{=}}}} large-scale mechanical energy, {{math|Δ''E''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;pot&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{=}}}} large-scale potential energy, and {{math|Δ''E''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;tot&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{=}}}} total energy. The first two quantities are specifiable in terms of appropriate mechanical variables, and by definition

:::::::::&lt;math&gt;E^{\mathrm{tot}}=E^{\mathrm{kin}}+E^{\mathrm{pot}}+U\,\,.&lt;/math&gt;

::::::For any finite process, whether reversible or irreversible,

:::::::::&lt;math&gt;\Delta E^{\mathrm{tot}}=\Delta E^{\mathrm{kin}}+\Delta E^{\mathrm{pot}}+\Delta U\,\,.&lt;/math&gt;

::::::The first law in a form that involves the principle of conservation of energy more generally is

:::::::::&lt;math&gt;\Delta E^{\mathrm{tot}}=Q+W\,\,.&lt;/math&gt;

::::::Here {{math|''Q''}} and {{math|''W''}} are heat and work added, with no restrictions as to whether the process is reversible, quasistatic, or irreversible.[Warner, ''Am. J. Phys.'', '''29''', 124 (1961)]&lt;ref name ="Crawford 106"&gt;Crawford, F. H. (1963), pp. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

This statement by Crawford, for {{math|''W''}}, uses the sign convention of IUPAC, not that of Clausius. Though it does not explicitly say so, this statement refers to closed systems, and to internal energy {{math|''U''}} defined for bodies in states of thermodynamic equilibrium, which possess well-defined temperatures.

The history of statements of the law for closed systems has two main periods, before and after the work of [[George H. Bryan|Bryan]] (1907),&lt;ref name="Bryan 1907"&gt;[[George H. Bryan|Bryan, G. H.]] (1907), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Constantin Carathéodory|Carathéodory]] (1909),&lt;ref name="Carathéodory 1909"&gt;[[Constantin Carathéodory|Carathéodory]], C. (1909).&lt;/ref&gt; and the approval of Carathéodory's work given by [[Max Born|Born]] (1921).&lt;ref name="Born 1921"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Born | first1 = M. | year = 1921 | title = Kritische Betrachtungen zur traditionellen Darstellung der Thermodynamik | url = | journal = Phys. Z. | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 218–224 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier traditional versions of the law for closed systems are nowadays often considered to be out of date.

Carathéodory's celebrated presentation of equilibrium thermodynamics&lt;ref name="Carathéodory 1909"/&gt; refers to closed systems, which are allowed to contain several phases connected by internal walls of various kinds of impermeability and permeability (explicitly including walls that are permeable only to heat). Carathéodory's 1909 version of the first law of thermodynamics was stated in an axiom which refrained from defining or mentioning temperature or quantity of heat transferred. That axiom stated that the internal energy of a phase in equilibrium is a function of state, that the sum of the internal energies of the phases is the total internal energy of the system, and that the value of the total internal energy of the system is changed by the amount of work done adiabatically on it, considering work as a form of energy. That article considered this statement to be an expression of the law of conservation of energy for such systems. This version is nowadays widely accepted as authoritative, but is stated in slightly varied ways by different authors.

Such statements of the first law for closed systems assert the existence of internal energy as a function of state defined in terms of adiabatic work. Thus heat is not defined calorimetrically or as due to temperature difference. It is defined as a residual difference between change of internal energy and work done on the system, when that work does not account for the whole of the change of internal energy and the system is not adiabatically isolated.&lt;ref name="Münster 23 24"&gt;Münster, A. (1970), pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reif 122"&gt;Reif, F. (1965), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haase 1971"&gt;Haase, R. (1971), pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1909 Carathéodory statement of the law in axiomatic form does not mention heat or temperature, but the equilibrium states to which it refers are explicitly defined by variable sets that necessarily include "non-deformation variables", such as pressures, which, within reasonable restrictions, can be rightly interpreted as empirical temperatures,&lt;ref&gt;Buchdahl, H. A. (1966), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; and the walls connecting the phases of the system are explicitly defined as possibly impermeable to heat or permeable only to heat.

According to Münster (1970), "A somewhat unsatisfactory aspect of Carathéodory's theory is that a consequence of the Second Law must be considered at this point [in the statement of the first law], i.e. that it is not always possible to reach any state 2 from any other state 1 by means of an adiabatic process." Münster instances that no adiabatic process can reduce the internal energy of a system at constant volume.&lt;ref name="Münster 23 24"/&gt; Carathéodory's paper asserts that its statement of the first law corresponds exactly to Joule's experimental arrangement, regarded as an instance of adiabatic work. It does not point out that Joule's experimental arrangement performed essentially irreversible work, through friction of paddles in a liquid, or passage of electric current through a resistance inside the system, driven by motion of a coil and inductive heating, or by an external current source, which can access the system only by the passage of electrons, and so is not strictly adiabatic, because electrons are a form of matter, which cannot penetrate adiabatic walls. The paper goes on to base its main argument on the possibility of quasi-static adiabatic work, which is essentially reversible. The paper asserts that it will avoid reference to Carnot cycles, and then proceeds to base its argument on cycles of forward and backward quasi-static adiabatic stages, with isothermal stages of zero magnitude.

Sometimes the concept of internal energy is not made explicit in the statement.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Pippard|Pippard, A. B.]] (1957/1966), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reif, F. (1965), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, C. J. (1968/1983), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the existence of the internal energy is made explicit but work is not explicitly mentioned in the statement of the first postulate of thermodynamics. Heat supplied is then defined as the residual change in internal energy after work has been taken into account, in a non-adiabatic process.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Callen|Callen, H. B.]] (1960/1985), pp. 13, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

A respected modern author states the first law of thermodynamics as "Heat is a form of energy", which explicitly mentions neither internal energy nor adiabatic work. Heat is defined as energy transferred by thermal contact with a reservoir, which has a temperature, and is generally so large that addition and removal of heat do not alter its temperature.&lt;ref name="Kittel and Kroemer 1980"&gt;Kittel, C. Kroemer, H. (1980). ''Thermal Physics'', (first edition by Kittel alone 1969), second edition, W. H. Freeman, San Francisco, {{ISBN|0-7167-1088-9}}, pp. 49, 227.&lt;/ref&gt; A current student text on chemistry defines heat thus: "''heat'' is the exchange of thermal energy between a system and its surroundings caused by a temperature difference." The author then explains how heat is defined or measured by calorimetry, in terms of [[heat capacity]], specific heat capacity, molar heat capacity, and temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Tro, N. J. (2008). ''Chemistry. A Molecular Approach'', Pearson/Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River  NJ, {{ISBN|0-13-100065-9}}, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

A respected text disregards the Carathéodory's exclusion of mention of heat from the statement of the first law for closed systems, and admits heat calorimetrically defined along with work and internal energy.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Gamble Kirkwood|Kirkwood, J. G.]], Oppenheim, I. (1961), pp. 17–18. Kirkwood &amp; Oppenheim 1961 is recommended by Münster, A. (1970), p. 376. It is also cited by Eu, B. C. (2002), ''Generalized Thermodynamics, the Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes and Generalized Hydrodynamics'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, {{ISBN|1-4020-0788-4}}, pp. 18, 29, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Another respected text defines heat exchange as determined by temperature difference, but also mentions that the Born (1921) version is "completely rigorous".&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward A. Guggenheim|Guggenheim, E. A.]] (1949/1967). ''Thermodynamics. An Advanced Treatment for Chemists and Physicists'', (first edition 1949), fifth edition 1967, North-Holland, Amsterdam, pp. 9–10. Guggenheim 1949/1965 is recommended by Buchdahl, H. A. (1966), p. 218. It is also recommended by Münster, A. (1970), p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt; These versions follow the traditional approach that is now considered out of date, exemplified by that of Planck (1897/1903).&lt;ref name="Planck 1903"&gt;Planck, M. (1897/1903).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence for the first law of thermodynamics for closed systems==
The first law of thermodynamics for closed systems was originally induced from empirically observed evidence, including calorimetric evidence. It is nowadays, however, taken to provide the definition of heat via the law of conservation of energy and the definition of work in terms of changes in the external parameters of a system. The original discovery of the law was gradual over a period of perhaps half a century or more, and some early studies were in terms of cyclic processes.&lt;ref name="Truesdell, C. A. 1980"&gt;Truesdell, C. A. (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is an account in terms of changes of state of a closed system through compound processes that are not necessarily cyclic. This account first considers processes for which the first law is easily verified because of their simplicity, namely [[adiabatic process]]es (in which there is no transfer as heat) and [[Thermodynamics#System models|adynamic processes]] (in which there is no transfer as work).

===Adiabatic processes===
In an adiabatic process, there is transfer of energy as work but not as heat. For all adiabatic process that takes a system from a given initial state to a given final state, irrespective of how the work is done, the respective eventual total quantities of energy transferred as work are one and the same, determined just by the given initial and final states. The work done on the system is defined and measured by changes in mechanical or quasi-mechanical variables external to the system. Physically, adiabatic transfer of energy as work requires the existence of adiabatic enclosures.

For instance, in Joule's experiment, the initial system is a tank of water with a paddle wheel inside. If we isolate the tank thermally, and move the paddle wheel with a pulley and a weight, we can relate the increase in temperature with the distance descended by the mass. Next, the system is returned to its initial state, isolated again, and the same amount of work is done on the tank using different devices (an electric motor, a chemical battery, a spring,...). In every case, the amount of work can be measured independently. The return to the initial state is not conducted by doing adiabatic work on the system. The evidence shows that the final state of the water (in particular, its temperature and volume) is the same in every case. It is irrelevant if the work is [[electrical work|electrical]], mechanical, chemical,... or if done suddenly or slowly, as long as it is performed in an adiabatic way, that is to say, without heat transfer into or out of the system.

Evidence of this kind shows that to increase the temperature of the water in the tank, the qualitative kind of adiabatically performed work does not matter. No qualitative kind of adiabatic work has ever been observed to decrease the temperature of the water in the tank.

A change from one state to another, for example an increase of both temperature and volume, may be conducted in several stages, for example by externally supplied electrical work on a resistor in the body, and adiabatic expansion allowing the body to do work on the surroundings. It needs to be shown that the time order of the stages, and their relative magnitudes, does not affect the amount of adiabatic work that needs to be done for the change of state. According to one respected scholar: "Unfortunately, it does not seem that experiments of this kind have ever been carried out carefully. ... We must therefore admit that the statement which we have enunciated here, and which is equivalent to the first law of thermodynamics, is not well founded on direct experimental evidence."&lt;ref name="Pippard 15"&gt;[[Brian Pippard|Pippard, A. B.]] (1957/1966), p. 15. According to [[Herbert Callen]], in his most widely cited text, Pippard's text gives a "scholarly and rigorous treatment"; see Callen, H. B. (1960/1985), p. 485. It is also recommended by Münster, A. (1970), p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt; Another expression of this view is "...&amp;nbsp;no systematic precise experiments to verify this generalization directly have ever been attempted."&lt;ref&gt;Kestin, J. (1966), p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

This kind of evidence, of independence of sequence of stages, combined with the above-mentioned evidence, of independence of qualitative kind of work, would show the existence of an important state variable that corresponds with adiabatic work, but not that such a state variable represented a conserved quantity. For the latter, another step of evidence is needed, which may be related to the concept of reversibility, as mentioned below.

That important state variable was first recognized and denoted &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; by Clausius in 1850, but he did not then name it, and he defined it in terms not only of work but also of heat transfer in the same process. It was also independently recognized in 1850 by Rankine, who also denoted it &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; ; and in 1851 by Kelvin who then called it "mechanical energy", and later "intrinsic energy". In 1865, after some hestitation, Clausius began calling his state function &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; "energy". In 1882 it was named as the ''[[internal energy]]'' by Helmholtz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cropper | first1 = W. H. | year = 1986 | title = Rudolf Clausius and the road to entropy | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UqbxZpELwHYC&amp;pg=PA93 | journal = Am. J. Phys. | volume = 54 | issue = | pages = 1068–1074 | doi=10.1119/1.14740|bibcode = 1986AmJPh..54.1068C }}&lt;/ref&gt; If only adiabatic processes were of interest, and heat could be ignored, the concept of internal energy would hardly arise or be needed. The relevant physics would be largely covered by the concept of potential energy, as was intended in the 1847 paper of Helmholtz on the principle of conservation of energy, though that did not deal with forces that cannot be described by a potential, and thus did not fully justify the principle. Moreover, that paper was critical of the early work of Joule that had by then been performed.&lt;ref&gt;Truesdell, C. A. (1980), pp. 161–162.&lt;/ref&gt; A great merit of the internal energy concept is that it frees thermodynamics from a restriction to cyclic processes, and allows a treatment in terms of thermodynamic states.

In an adiabatic process, adiabatic work takes the system either from a reference state &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; with internal energy &lt;math&gt;U(O)&lt;/math&gt; to an arbitrary one &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; with internal energy &lt;math&gt;U(A)&lt;/math&gt;, or from the state &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to the state &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;U(A)=U(O) - W^\mathrm{adiabatic}_{O\to A}\,\, \mathrm{or}\,\,U(O)=U(A) - W^\mathrm{adiabatic}_{A\to O}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Except under the special, and strictly speaking, fictional, condition of reversibility, only one of the processes &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{adiabatic},\,O\to A&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; or &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{adiabatic},\,{A\to O}\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;is empirically feasible by a simple application of externally supplied work. The reason for this is given as the second law of thermodynamics and is not considered in the present article.

The fact of such irreversibility may be dealt with in two main ways, according to different points of view:

*Since the work of Bryan (1907), the most accepted way to deal with it nowadays, followed by Carathéodory,&lt;ref name="Carathéodory 1909"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haase 1971"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buchdahl, H. A. (1966), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; is to rely on the previously established concept of quasi-static processes,&lt;ref&gt;[[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell, J. C.]] (1871). ''Theory of Heat'', Longmans, Green, and Co., London, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Planck, M. (1897/1903), Section 71, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, M. (1994), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; as follows. Actual physical processes of transfer of energy as work are always at least to some degree irreversible. The irreversibility is often due to mechanisms known as dissipative, that transform bulk kinetic energy into internal energy. Examples are friction and viscosity. If the process is performed more slowly, the frictional or viscous dissipation is less. In the limit of infinitely slow performance, the dissipation tends to zero and then the limiting process, though fictional rather than actual, is notionally reversible, and is called quasi-static. Throughout the course of the fictional limiting quasi-static process, the internal intensive variables of the system are equal to the external intensive variables, those that describe the reactive forces exerted by the surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, C. J. (1968/1983), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be taken to justify the formula
:&lt;math&gt;(1) \,\,\,\,\,\,\,W^\text{adiabatic, quasi-static}_{A\to O} = -W^\text{adiabatic, quasi-static}_{O\to A}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

*Another way to deal with it is to allow that experiments with processes of heat transfer to or from the system may be used to justify the formula (1) above. Moreover, it deals to some extent with the problem of lack of direct experimental evidence that the time order of stages of a process does not matter in the determination of internal energy. This way does not provide theoretical purity in terms of adiabatic work processes, but is empirically feasible, and is in accord with experiments actually done, such as the Joule experiments mentioned just above, and with older traditions.

The formula (1) above allows that to go by processes of quasi-static adiabatic work from the state &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to the state &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; we can take a path that goes through the reference state &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt;, since the quasi-static adiabatic work is independent of the path

:&lt;math&gt;-W^\mathrm{adiabatic,\,quasi-static}_{A\to B}=-W^\mathrm{adiabatic,\,quasi-static}_{A\to O}-W^\mathrm{adiabatic,\,quasi-static}_{O\to B} = W^\mathrm{adiabatic,\,quasi-static}_{O\to A}- W^\mathrm{adiabatic,\,quasi-static}_{O\to B} = -U(A) + U(B) = \Delta U&lt;/math&gt;

This kind of empirical evidence, coupled with theory of this kind, largely justifies the following statement:

:''For all adiabatic processes between two specified states of a closed system of any nature, the net work done is the same regardless the details of the process, and determines a state function called internal energy, &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;."

===Adynamic processes===
{{See also|Thermodynamic processes}}
A complementary observable aspect of the first law is about [[heat transfer]]. Adynamic transfer of energy as heat can be measured empirically by changes in the surroundings of the system of interest by calorimetry. This again requires the existence of adiabatic enclosure of the entire process, system and surroundings, though the separating wall between the surroundings and the system is thermally conductive or radiatively permeable, not adiabatic. A calorimeter can rely on measurement of [[sensible heat]], which requires the existence of thermometers and measurement of temperature change in bodies of known sensible heat capacity under specified conditions; or it can rely on the measurement of [[latent heat]], through [[Calorimetry#Calorimetry through phase change|measurement of masses of material that change phase]], at temperatures fixed by the occurrence of phase changes under specified conditions in bodies of known latent heat of phase change. The calorimeter can be calibrated by adiabatically doing externally determined work on it. The most accurate method is by passing an electric current from outside through a resistance inside the calorimeter. The calibration allows comparison of calorimetric measurement of quantity of heat transferred with quantity of energy transferred as work. According to one textbook, "The most common device for measuring &lt;math&gt;\Delta U&lt;/math&gt; is an '''adiabatic bomb calorimeter'''."&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Atkins|Atkins, P.]], de Paula, J. (1978/2010). ''Physical Chemistry'', (first edition 1978), ninth edition 2010, Oxford University Press, Oxford UK, {{ISBN|978-0-19-954337-3}}, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; According to another textbook, "Calorimetry is widely used in present day laboratories."&lt;ref&gt;Kondepudi, D. (2008). ''Introduction to Modern Thermodynamics'', Wiley, Chichester, {{ISBN|978-0-470-01598-8}}, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; According to one opinion, "Most thermodynamic data come from calorimetry..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gislason | first1 = E. A. | last2 = Craig | first2 = N. C. | year = 2005 | title = Cementing the foundations of thermodynamics:comparison of system-based and surroundings-based definitions of work and heat | url = | journal = J. Chem. Thermodynamics | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 954–966 | doi=10.1016/j.jct.2004.12.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to another opinion, "The most common method of measuring "heat" is with a calorimeter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosenberg | first1 = R. M. | year = 2010 | title = From Joule to Caratheodory and Born: A conceptual evolution of the first law of thermodynamics | url = | journal = J. Chem. Educ. | volume = 87 | issue = | pages = 691–693 | doi=10.1021/ed1001976|bibcode = 2010JChEd..87..691R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the system evolves with transfer of energy as heat, without energy being transferred as work, in an adynamic process,&lt;ref&gt;[[J.R. Partington|Partington, J.R.]] (1949), p. 183: "[[William John Macquorn Rankine|Rankine]] calls the curves representing changes without performance of work, ''adynamics''."&lt;/ref&gt; the heat transferred to the system is equal to the increase in its internal energy:

:&lt;math&gt;Q^\mathrm{adynamic}_{A\to B}=\Delta U\,.&lt;/math&gt;

===General case for reversible processes===
Heat transfer is practically reversible when it is driven by practically negligibly small temperature gradients. Work transfer is practically reversible when it occurs so slowly that there are no frictional effects within the system; frictional effects outside the system should also be zero if the process is to be globally reversible. For a particular reversible process in general, the work done reversibly on the system, &lt;math&gt;W^{\mathrm{path}\,P_0,\, \mathrm{reversible}}_{A\to B}&lt;/math&gt;, and the heat transferred reversibly to the system, &lt;math&gt;Q^{\mathrm{path}\,P_0,\, \mathrm{reversible}}_{A\to B}&lt;/math&gt; are not required to occur respectively adiabatically or adynamically, but they must belong to the same particular process defined by its particular reversible path, &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt;, through the space of thermodynamic states. Then the work and heat transfers can occur and be calculated simultaneously.

Putting the two complementary aspects together, the first law for a particular reversible process can be written

:&lt;math&gt;-W^{\mathrm{path}\,P_0,\, \mathrm{reversible}}_{A\to B} + Q^{\mathrm{path}\,P_0,\, \mathrm{reversible}}_{A\to B} = \Delta U\, .&lt;/math&gt;

This combined statement is the expression the first law of thermodynamics for reversible processes for closed systems.

In particular, if no work is done on a thermally isolated closed system we have

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta U = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;.

This is one aspect of the law of conservation of energy and can be stated:

:''The internal energy of an isolated system remains constant.''

===General case for irreversible processes===
If, in a process of change of state of a closed system, the energy transfer is not under a practically zero temperature gradient and practically frictionless, then the process is irreversible. Then the heat and work transfers may be difficult to calculate, and irreversible thermodynamics is called for. Nevertheless, the first law still holds and provides a check on the measurements and calculations of the work done irreversibly on the system, &lt;math&gt;W^{\mathrm{path}\,P_1,\, \mathrm{irreversible}}_{A\to B}&lt;/math&gt;, and the heat transferred irreversibly to the system, &lt;math&gt;Q^{\mathrm{path}\,P_1,\, \mathrm{irreversible}}_{A\to B}&lt;/math&gt;, which belong to the same particular process defined by its particular irreversible path, &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt;, through the space of thermodynamic states.

:&lt;math&gt;-W^{\mathrm{path}\,P_1,\, \mathrm{irreversible}}_{A\to B} + Q^{\mathrm{path}\,P_1,\, \mathrm{irreversible}}_{A\to B} = \Delta U\, .&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the internal energy &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is a function of state and that the internal energy change &lt;math&gt;\Delta U&lt;/math&gt; between two states is a function only of the two states.

===Overview of the weight of evidence for the law===
The first law of thermodynamics is so general that its predictions cannot all be directly tested. In many properly conducted experiments it has been precisely supported, and never violated. Indeed, within its scope of applicability, the law is so reliably established, that, nowadays, rather than experiment being considered as testing the accuracy of the law, it is more practical and realistic to think of the law as testing the accuracy of experiment. An experimental result that seems to violate the law may be assumed to be inaccurate or wrongly conceived, for example due to failure to account for an important physical factor. Thus, some may regard it as a principle more abstract than a law.

==State functional formulation for infinitesimal processes==
When the heat and work transfers in the equations above are infinitesimal in magnitude, they are often denoted by {{math|''δ''}}, rather than [[exact differential]]s denoted by {{math|''d''}}, as a reminder that heat and work do not describe the ''state'' of any system. The integral of an [[inexact differential]] depends upon the particular path taken through the space of thermodynamic parameters while the integral of an exact differential depends only upon the initial and final states. If the initial and final states are the same, then the integral of an inexact differential may or may not be zero, but the integral of an exact differential is always zero. The path taken by a thermodynamic system through a chemical or physical change is known as a [[thermodynamic process]].

The first law for a closed homogeneous system may be stated in terms that include concepts that are established in the second law. The internal energy {{math|''U''}} may then be expressed as a function of the system's defining state variables {{math|''S''}}, entropy, and {{math|''V''}}, volume: {{math|''U'' {{=}} ''U'' (''S'', ''V'')}}. In these terms, {{math|''T''}}, the system's temperature, and {{math|''P''}}, its pressure, are partial derivatives of {{math|''U''}} with respect to {{math|''S''}} and {{math|''V''}}. These variables are important throughout thermodynamics, though not necessary for the statement of the first law. Rigorously, they are defined only when the system is in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium. For some purposes, the concepts provide good approximations for scenarios sufficiently near to the system's internal thermodynamic equilibrium.

The first law requires that:

:&lt;math&gt;dU=\delta Q-\delta W \, \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \text {(closed system, general process, quasi-static or irreversible).}&lt;/math&gt;

Then, for the fictive case of a reversible process, {{math|d''U''}} can be written in terms of exact differentials. One may imagine reversible changes, such that there is at each instant negligible departure from  thermodynamic equilibrium within the system. This excludes isochoric work. Then, mechanical [[work (thermodynamics)|work]] is given by {{math|δ''W'' {{=}} - ''P dV''}} and the quantity of heat added can be expressed as {{math|''δQ'' {{=}} ''T dS''}}. For these conditions

:&lt;math&gt;dU=TdS-PdV \, \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \text {(closed system, reversible process).}&lt;/math&gt;

While this has been shown here for reversible changes, it is valid in general, as {{math|''U''}} can be considered as a thermodynamic state function of the defining state variables {{math|''S''}} and {{math|''V''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;(2) \,\,\,\,\,\,\,dU=TdS-PdV \, \,\,\,\, \text {(closed system, general process, quasi-static or irreversible).}&lt;/math&gt;

Equation (2) is known as the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]] for a closed system in the energy representation, for which the defining state variables are {{math|''S''}} and {{math|''V''}}, with respect to which {{math|''T''}} and {{math|''P''}} are partial derivatives of {{math|''U''}}.&lt;ref&gt;Denbigh, K. (1954/1981), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, C. J. (1968/1983), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Callen|Callen, H. B.]] (1960/1985), pp. 36, 41, 63.&lt;/ref&gt; It is only in the fictive reversible case, when isochoric work is excluded, that the work done and heat transferred are given by {{math|−''P'' d''V''}} and {{math|''T'' d''S''}}.

In the case of a closed system in which the particles of the system are of different types and, because chemical reactions may occur, their respective numbers are not necessarily constant, the fundamental thermodynamic relation for d''U'' becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;dU=TdS-PdV + \sum_i \mu_i dN_i.\,&lt;/math&gt;

where d''N''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the (small) increase in amount of type-i particles in the reaction, and ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is known as the [[chemical potential]] of the type-i particles in the system. If d''N''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is expressed in [[Mole (unit)|mol]] then ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is expressed in J/mol. If the system has more external mechanical variables than just the volume that can change, the fundamental thermodynamic relation further generalizes to:

:&lt;math&gt;dU = T dS - \sum_{i}X_{i}dx_{i} + \sum_{j}\mu_{j}dN_{j}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Here the ''X''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[generalized forces]] corresponding to the external variables ''x''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. The parameters ''X''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are independent of the size of the system and are called intensive parameters and the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are proportional to the size and called extensive parameters.

For an open system, there can be transfers of particles as well as energy into or out of the system during a process. For this case, the first law of thermodynamics still holds, in the form that the internal energy is a function of state and the change of internal energy in a process is a function only of its initial and final states, as noted in the section below headed [[First law of thermodynamics#First law of thermodynamics for open systems|First law of thermodynamics for open systems]].

A useful idea from mechanics is that the energy gained by a particle is equal to the force applied to the particle multiplied by the displacement of the particle while that force is applied. Now consider the first law without the heating term: d''U'' = -''P''d''V''. The pressure ''P'' can be viewed as a force (and in fact has units of force per unit area) while d''V''is the displacement (with units of distance times area). We may say, with respect to this work term, that a pressure difference forces a transfer of volume, and that the product of the two (work) is the amount of energy transferred out of the system as a result of the process. If one were to make this term negative then this would be the work done on the system.

It is useful to view the ''T''d''S'' term in the same light: here the temperature is known as a "generalized" force (rather than an actual mechanical force) and the entropy is a generalized displacement.

Similarly, a difference in chemical potential between groups of particles in the system drives a chemical reaction that changes the numbers of particles, and the corresponding product is the amount of chemical potential energy transformed in process. For example, consider a system consisting of two phases: liquid water and water vapor. There is a generalized "force" of evaporation that drives water molecules out of the liquid. There is a generalized "force" of condensation that drives vapor molecules out of the vapor. Only when these two "forces" (or chemical potentials) are equal is there equilibrium, and the net rate of transfer zero.

The two thermodynamic parameters that form a generalized force-displacement pair are called "conjugate variables". The two most familiar pairs are, of course, pressure-volume, and temperature-entropy.

==Spatially inhomogeneous systems==
Classical thermodynamics is initially focused on closed homogeneous systems (e.g. Planck 1897/1903&lt;ref name="Planck 1903"/&gt;), which might be regarded as 'zero-dimensional' in the sense that they have no spatial variation. But it is desired to study also systems with distinct internal motion and spatial inhomogeneity. For such systems, the principle of conservation of energy is expressed in terms not only of internal energy as defined for homogeneous systems, but also in terms of kinetic energy and potential energies of parts of the inhomogeneous system with respect to each other and with respect to long-range external forces.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, M. (1994), 254–256.&lt;/ref&gt; How the total energy of a system is allocated between these three more specific kinds of energy varies according to the purposes of different writers; this is because these components of energy are to some extent mathematical artefacts rather than actually measured physical quantities. For any closed homogeneous component of an inhomogeneous closed system, if &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; denotes the total energy of that component system, one may write

:&lt;math&gt;E = E^{\mathrm {kin}} + E^{\mathrm {pot}} + U&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;E^{\mathrm {kin}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E^{\mathrm {pot}}&lt;/math&gt; denote respectively the total kinetic energy and the total potential energy of the component closed homogeneous system, and &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; denotes its internal energy.&lt;ref name ="Crawford 106"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glansdorff, P., [[Ilya Prigogine|Prigogine, I.]] (1971), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Potential energy can be exchanged with the surroundings of the system when the surroundings impose a force field, such as gravitational or electromagnetic, on the system.

A compound system consisting of two interacting closed homogeneous component subsystems has a potential energy of interaction &lt;math&gt;E^{\mathrm {pot}}_{12}&lt;/math&gt; between the subsystems. Thus, in an obvious notation, one may write

:&lt;math&gt;E = E^{\mathrm {kin}}_1 + E^{\mathrm {pot}}_1 + U_1 + E^{\mathrm {kin}}_2 + E^{\mathrm {pot}}_2 + U_2 + E^{\mathrm {pot}}_{12}&lt;/math&gt;

The quantity &lt;math&gt;E^{\mathrm {pot}}_{12}&lt;/math&gt; in general lacks an assignment to either subsystem in a way that is not arbitrary, and this stands in the way of a general non-arbitrary definition of transfer of energy as work. On occasions, authors make their various respective arbitrary assignments.&lt;ref&gt;Tisza, L. (1966), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between internal and kinetic energy is hard to make in the presence of turbulent motion within the system, as friction gradually dissipates macroscopic kinetic energy of localised bulk flow into molecular random motion of molecules that is classified as internal energy.&lt;ref&gt;Denbigh, K. G. (1951), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;  The rate of dissipation by friction of kinetic energy of localised bulk flow into internal energy,&lt;ref name="Kelvin 1852a"&gt;[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Thomson, W.]] (1852 a).

This is a serious difficulty for attempts to define entropy for time-varying spatially inhomogeneous systems.

==First law of thermodynamics for open systems==
For the first law of thermodynamics, there is no trivial passage of physical conception from the closed system view to an open system view.&lt;ref name="Münster 51"&gt;Münster A. (1970), Sections 14, 15, pp. 45–51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Landsberg, P. T. (1978), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; For closed systems, the concepts of an adiabatic enclosure and of an adiabatic wall are fundamental. Matter and internal energy cannot permeate or penetrate such a wall. For an open system, there is a wall that allows penetration by matter. In general, matter in diffusive motion carries with it some internal energy, and some microscopic potential energy changes accompany the motion. An open system is not adiabatically enclosed.

There are some cases in which a process for an open system can, for particular purposes, be considered as if it were for a closed system. In an open system, by definition hypothetically or potentially, matter can pass between the system and its surroundings. But when, in a particular case, the process of interest involves only hypothetical or potential but no actual passage of matter, the process can be considered as if it were for a closed system.

===Internal energy for an open system===
Since the revised and more rigorous definition of the internal energy of a closed system rests upon the possibility of processes by which adiabatic work takes the system from one state to another, this leaves a problem for the definition of internal energy for an open system, for which adiabatic work is not in general possible. According to [[Max Born]], the transfer of matter and energy across an open connection "cannot be reduced to mechanics".&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Born|Born, M.]] (1949), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the case of closed systems, for open systems, in the presence of diffusion, there is no unconstrained and unconditional physical distinction between convective transfer of internal energy by bulk flow of matter, the transfer of internal energy without transfer of matter (usually called heat conduction and work transfer), and change of various potential energies.&lt;ref&gt;Denbigh, K. G. (1951), p. 56. Denbigh states in a footnote that he is indebted to correspondence with [[Edward A. Guggenheim|E. A. Guggenheim]] and with N. K. Adam. From this, Denbigh concludes "It seems, however, that when a system is able to exchange both heat and matter with its environment, it is impossible to make an unambiguous distinction between energy transported as heat and by the migration of matter, without already assuming the existence of the 'heat of transport'."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fitts, D. D. (1962), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Denbigh, K. (1954/1971), pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; The older traditional way and the conceptually revised (Carathéodory) way agree that there is no physically unique definition of heat and work transfer processes between open systems.&lt;ref&gt;Münster, A. (1970), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haase, R. (1963/1969), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haase, R. (1971), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith 1980"&gt;Smith, D. A. (1980).

Phys.'', '''33''': 95–105.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012014734/http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/PH800095.htm |date=October 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bailyn, M. 1994, p. 308"&gt;Bailyn, M. (1994), p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Balian|Balian, R.]] (1991/2007), p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, between two otherwise isolated open systems an adiabatic wall is by definition impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Münster, A. (1970), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; This problem is solved by recourse to the principle of [[conservation of energy]]. This principle allows a composite isolated system to be derived from two other component non-interacting isolated systems, in such a way that the total energy of the composite isolated system is equal to the sum of the total energies of the two component isolated systems. Two previously isolated systems can be subjected to the [[thermodynamic operation]] of placement between them of a wall permeable to matter and energy, followed by a time for establishment of a new thermodynamic state of internal equilibrium in the new single unpartitioned system.&lt;ref&gt;Tisza, L. (1966), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The internal energies of the initial two systems and of the final new system, considered respectively as closed systems as above, can be measured.&lt;ref name="Münster 51"/&gt; Then the law of conservation of energy requires that
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta U_s+\Delta U_o=0\, ,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Callen 54"&gt;Callen H. B. (1960/1985), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tisza 110"&gt;Tisza, L. (1966), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

where {{math|Δ''U''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|Δ''U''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;}} denote the changes in internal energy of the system and of its surroundings respectively. This is a statement of the first law of thermodynamics for a transfer between two otherwise isolated open systems,&lt;ref&gt;Tisza, L. (1966), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; that fits well with the conceptually revised and rigorous statement of the law stated above.

For the thermodynamic operation of adding two systems with internal energies {{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, to produce a new system with internal energy {{math|''U''}}, one may write {{math|''U'' {{=}} ''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}; the reference states for  {{math|''U''}}, {{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} should be specified accordingly, maintaining also that the internal energy of a system be proportional to its mass, so that the internal energies are [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive variables]].&lt;ref name="Münster 51"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ilya Prigogine|Prigogine, I.]], (1955/1967), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a sense in which this kind of additivity expresses a fundamental postulate that goes beyond the simplest ideas of classical closed system thermodynamics; the extensivity of some variables is not obvious, and needs explicit expression; indeed one author goes so far as to say that it could be recognized as a fourth law of thermodynamics, though this is not repeated by other authors.&lt;ref&gt;Landsberg, P. T. (1961), pp. 142, 387.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Landsberg, P. T. (1978), pp. 79, 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also of course
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta N_s+\Delta N_o=0\, ,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Callen 54"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tisza 110"/&gt;

where {{math|Δ''N''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|Δ''N''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;}} denote the changes in mole number of a component substance of the system and of its surroundings respectively. This is a statement of the law of [[conservation of mass]].

===Process of transfer of matter between an open system and its surroundings===
A system connected to its surroundings only through contact by a single permeable wall, but otherwise isolated, is an open system. If it is initially in a state of contact equilibrium with a surrounding subsystem, a [[thermodynamic process]] of transfer of matter can be made to occur between them if the surrounding subsystem is subjected to some thermodynamic operation, for example, removal of a partition between it and some further surrounding subsystem. The removal of the partition in the surroundings initiates a process of exchange between the system and its contiguous surrounding subsystem.

An example is evaporation. One may consider an open system consisting of a collection of liquid, enclosed except where it is allowed to evaporate into or to receive condensate from its vapor above it, which may be considered as its contiguous surrounding subsystem, and subject to control of its volume and temperature.

A thermodynamic process might be initiated by a thermodynamic operation in the surroundings, that mechanically increases in the controlled volume of the vapor. Some mechanical work will be done within the surroundings by the vapor, but also some of the parent liquid will evaporate and enter the vapor collection which is the contiguous surrounding subsystem. Some internal energy will accompany the vapor that leaves the system, but it will not make sense to try to uniquely identify part of that internal energy as heat and part of it as work. Consequently, the energy transfer that accompanies the transfer of matter between the system and its surrounding subsystem cannot be uniquely split into heat and work transfers to or from the open system. The component of total energy transfer that accompanies the transfer of vapor into the surrounding subsystem is customarily called 'latent heat of evaporation', but this use of the word heat is a quirk of customary historical language, not in strict compliance with the thermodynamic definition of transfer of energy as heat. In this example, kinetic energy of bulk flow and potential energy with respect to long-range external forces such as gravity are both considered to be zero. The first law of thermodynamics refers to the change of internal energy of the open system, between its initial and final states of internal equilibrium.

===Open system with multiple contacts===
An open system can be in contact equilibrium with several other systems at once.&lt;ref name="Carathéodory 1909"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prigogine, I. (1947), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Born, M. (1949), Appendix 8, [https://archive.org/stream/naturalphilosoph032159mbp#page/n157/mode/2up pp. 146–149] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407221517/https://archive.org/stream/naturalphilosoph032159mbp#page/n157/mode/2up |date=April 7, 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aston, J. G., Fritz, J. J. (1959), Chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kestin, J. (1961).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Landsberg, P. T. (1961), pp. 128–142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tisza, L. (1966), p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tschoegl, N. W. (2000), p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

This includes cases in which there is contact equilibrium between the system, and several subsystems in its surroundings, including separate connections with subsystems through walls that are permeable to the transfer of matter and internal energy as heat and allowing friction of passage of the transferred matter, but immovable, and separate connections through adiabatic walls with others, and separate connections through diathermic walls impermeable to matter with yet others. Because there are physically separate connections that are permeable to energy but impermeable to matter, between the system and its surroundings, energy transfers between them can occur with definite heat and work characters. Conceptually essential here is that the internal energy transferred with the transfer of matter is measured by a variable that is mathematically independent of the variables that measure heat and work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Born|Born, M.]] (1949), [https://archive.org/stream/naturalphilosoph032159mbp#page/n157/mode/2up pp. 146–147] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407221517/https://archive.org/stream/naturalphilosoph032159mbp#page/n157/mode/2up |date=April 7, 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

With such independence of variables, the total increase of internal energy in the process is then determined as the sum of the internal energy transferred from the surroundings with the transfer of matter through the walls that are permeable to it, and of the internal energy transferred to the system as heat through the diathermic walls, and of the energy transferred to the system as work through the adiabatic walls, including the energy transferred to the system by long-range forces. These simultaneously transferred quantities of energy are defined by events in the surroundings of the system. Because the internal energy transferred with matter is not in general uniquely resolvable into heat and work components, the total energy transfer cannot in general be uniquely resolved into heat and work components.&lt;ref&gt;Haase, R. (1971), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Under these conditions, the following formula can describe the process in terms of externally defined thermodynamic variables, as a statement of the first law of thermodynamics:
:&lt;math&gt;(3) \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\Delta U_0 \,=\,Q\, -\, W\, -\, \sum_{i=1}^m \Delta U_i \, \,\,\,\, \text {(suitably defined surrounding subsystems, general process, quasi-static or irreversible),}&lt;/math&gt;

where Δ''U''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the change of internal energy of the system, and {{math|Δ''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} denotes the change of internal energy of the {{math|''i''th}} of the {{math|''m''}} surrounding subsystems that are in open contact with the system, due to transfer between the system and that {{math|''i''th}} surrounding subsystem, and {{math|''Q''}} denotes the internal energy transferred as heat from the heat reservoir of the surroundings to the system, and {{math|''W''}} denotes the energy transferred from the system to the surrounding subsystems that are in adiabatic connection with it. The case of  a wall that is permeable to matter and can move so as to allow transfer of energy as work is not considered here.

====Combination of first and second laws====
If the system is described by the energetic fundamental equation, ''U''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''U''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'', ''V'', ''N&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''), and if the process can be described in the quasi-static formalism, in terms of the internal state variables of the system, then the process can also be described by a combination of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;(4) \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\mathrm d U_0 \,=\, T\, \mathrm d S\, -\, P\, \mathrm d V\, +\, \sum_{j=1}^n \mu _j \, \mathrm d N_j&lt;/math&gt;

where there are ''n'' chemical constituents of the system and permeably connected surrounding subsystems, and where ''T'', ''S'', ''P'', ''V'', ''N&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''μ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', are defined as above.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Callen|Callen, H. B.]], (1960/1985), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a general natural process, there is no immediate term-wise correspondence between equations (3) and (4), because they describe the process in different conceptual frames.

Nevertheless, a conditional correspondence exists. There are three relevant kinds of wall here: purely diathermal, adiabatic, and permeable to matter. If two of those kinds of wall are sealed off, leaving only one that permits transfers of energy, as work, as heat, or with matter, then the remaining permitted terms correspond precisely. If two of the kinds of wall are left unsealed, then energy transfer can be shared between them, so that the two remaining permitted terms do not correspond precisely.

For the special fictive case of quasi-static transfers, there is a simple correspondence.&lt;ref name="Aston Fritz account"&gt;Aston, J. G., Fritz, J. J. (1959), Chapter 9. This is an unusually explicit account of some of the physical meaning of the Gibbs formalism.&lt;/ref&gt; For this, it is supposed that the system has multiple areas of contact with its surroundings. There are pistons that allow adiabatic work, purely diathermal walls, and open connections with surrounding subsystems of completely controllable chemical potential (or equivalent controls for charged species). Then, for a suitable fictive quasi-static transfer, one can write

:&lt;math&gt;\delta Q \,=\, T\, \mathrm d S\,\text{   and    }\delta W \,=\, P\, \mathrm d V\,\, \,\,\,\, \text {(suitably defined surrounding subsystems, quasi-static transfers of energy)}.&lt;/math&gt;

For fictive quasi-static transfers for which the chemical potentials in the connected surrounding subsystems are suitably controlled, these can be put into equation (4) to yield

:&lt;math&gt;(5) \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\mathrm d U_0 \,=\, \delta Q\, -\, \delta W\, +\, \sum_{j=1}^n \mu _j \, \mathrm d N_j\, \,\,\,\,\,\, \text {(suitably defined surrounding subsystems, quasi-static transfers)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The reference &lt;ref name="Aston Fritz account"/&gt; does not actually write equation (5), but what it does write is fully compatible with it. Another helpful account is given by Tschoegl.&lt;ref&gt;Tschoegl, N. W. (2000), pp. 12–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several other accounts of this, in apparent mutual conflict.&lt;ref name="Smith 1980"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buchdahl, H. A. (1966), Section 66, pp. 121–125.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Callen, J. B. (1960/1985), Section 2-1, pp. 35–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-equilibrium transfers===
The transfer of energy between an open system and a single contiguous subsystem of its surroundings is considered also in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The problem of definition arises also in this case. It may be allowed that the wall between the system and the subsystem is not only permeable to matter and to internal energy, but also may be movable so as to allow work to be done when the two systems have different pressures. In this case, the transfer of energy as heat is not defined.

Methods for study of non-equilibrium processes mostly deal with spatially continuous flow systems. In this case, the open connection between system and surroundings is usually taken to fully surround the system, so that there are no separate connections impermeable to matter but permeable to heat. Except for the special case mentioned above when there is no actual transfer of matter, which can be treated as if for a closed system, in strictly defined thermodynamic terms, it follows that transfer of energy as heat is not defined. In this sense, there is no such thing as 'heat flow' for a continuous-flow open system. Properly, for closed systems, one speaks of transfer of internal energy as heat, but in general, for open systems, one can speak safely only of transfer of internal energy. A factor here is that there are often cross-effects between distinct transfers, for example that transfer of one substance may cause transfer of another even when the latter has zero chemical potential gradient.

Usually transfer between a system and its surroundings applies to transfer of a state variable, and obeys a balance law, that the amount lost by the donor system is equal to the amount gained by the receptor system. Heat is not a state variable. For his 1947 definition of "heat transfer" for discrete open systems, the author Prigogine carefully explains at some length that his definition of it does not obey a balance law. He describes this as paradoxical.&lt;ref&gt;Prigogine, I., (1947), pp. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation is clarified by Gyarmati, who shows that his definition of "heat transfer", for continuous-flow systems, really refers not specifically to heat, but rather to transfer of internal energy, as follows. He considers a conceptual small cell in a situation of continuous-flow as a system defined in the so-called Lagrangian way, moving with the local center of mass. The flow of matter across the boundary is zero when considered as a flow of total mass. Nevertheless, if the material constitution is of several chemically distinct components that can diffuse with respect to one another, the system is considered to be open, the diffusive flows of the components being defined with respect to the center of mass of the system, and balancing one another as to mass transfer. Still there can be a distinction between bulk flow of internal energy and diffusive flow of internal energy in this case, because the internal energy density does not have to be constant per unit mass of material, and allowing for non-conservation of internal energy because of local conversion of kinetic energy of bulk flow to internal energy by viscosity.

Gyarmati shows that his definition of "the heat flow vector" is strictly speaking a definition of flow of internal energy, not specifically of heat, and so it turns out that his use here of the word heat is contrary to the strict thermodynamic definition of heat, though it is more or less compatible with historical custom, that often enough did not clearly distinguish between heat and internal energy; he writes "that this relation must be considered to be the exact definition of the concept of heat flow, fairly loosely used in experimental physics and heat technics."&lt;ref&gt;Gyarmati, I. (1970), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently in a different frame of thinking from that of the above-mentioned paradoxical usage in the earlier sections of the historic 1947 work by Prigogine, about discrete systems, this usage of Gyarmati is consistent with the later sections of the same 1947 work by Prigogine, about continuous-flow systems, which use the term "heat flux" in just this way. This usage is also followed by Glansdorff and Prigogine in their 1971 text about continuous-flow systems. They write: "Again the flow of internal energy may be split into a convection flow {{math|''ρu'''''v'''}} and a conduction flow. This conduction flow is by definition the heat flow {{math|'''W'''}}. Therefore: {{math|'''j'''[''U''] {{=}} ''ρu'''''v''' + '''W'''}} where {{math|''u''}} denotes the [internal] energy per unit mass. [These authors actually use the symbols {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''e''}} to denote internal energy but their notation has been changed here to accord with the notation of the present article. These authors actually use the symbol {{math|''U''}} to refer to total energy, including kinetic energy of bulk flow.]"&lt;ref&gt;Glansdorff, P, Prigogine, I, (1971), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; This usage is followed also by other writers on non-equilibrium thermodynamics such as Lebon, Jou, and Casas-Vásquez,&lt;ref&gt;Lebon, G., Jou, D., Casas-Vázquez, J. (2008), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; and de Groot and Mazur.&lt;ref&gt;de Groot, S. R., Mazur, P. (1962), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; This usage is described by Bailyn as stating the non-convective flow of internal energy, and is listed as his definition number 1, according to the first law of thermodynamics.&lt;ref name="Bailyn, M. 1994, p. 308"/&gt; This usage is also followed by workers in the kinetic theory of gases.&lt;ref&gt;de Groot, S. R., Mazur, P. (1962), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Truesdell, C., Muncaster, R. G. (1980), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Balescu, R. (1997), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; This is not the ''ad hoc'' definition of "reduced heat flux" of Haase.&lt;ref&gt;Haase, R. (1963/1969), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of a flowing system of only one chemical constituent, in the Lagrangian representation, there is no distinction between bulk flow and diffusion of matter. Moreover, the flow of matter is zero into or out of the cell that moves with the local center of mass. In effect, in this description, one is dealing with a system effectively closed to the transfer of matter. But still one can validly talk of a distinction between bulk flow and diffusive flow of internal energy, the latter driven by a temperature gradient within the flowing material, and being defined with respect to the local center of mass of the bulk flow. In this case of a virtually closed system, because of the zero matter transfer, as noted above, one can safely distinguish between transfer of energy as work, and transfer of internal energy as heat.&lt;ref&gt;Eckart, C. (1940).&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''flyback chronograph''' is a [[complication (horology)|complication]] [[watch]], in which you can use the reset function without the need to first stop the [[chronograph]]. In regular chronographs you need to stop, reset, and restart the chronograph if you want to time an event after you have started the chronograph.

==Other names==
The flyback function is also known by some other names:
* Retour-en-vol ({{lang-fr|retour - to return; en - on; vol - flight}})
* Taylor system 
* Permanent zero setting

==Overview==
The flyback function is a complication inspired by everyday life, as are some other complications: [[world time]], [[universal time]], [[power reserve]].

Most flyback chronographs are constructed with the usual crown at 3 o'clock and 2 pushpieces at 2 and 4 o'clock. Usually the flyback function is controlled by the button at 4 o'clock whereas the one at 2 o'clock is used to stop the chronograph.

Many chronographs are equipped with the flyback function, especially watches meant for [[Pilot watch|pilots]]. It is much easier from the point of view of time saving, to instantly restart the chronograph with one push of the [[Push-button|button]], instead of three.

==History==
The appearance of the flyback function was catalyzed by the first watch with a separate chronograph button (the stop and reset functions were previously controlled by the winding-crown). This watch appeared in 1923 and was developed by [[Breitling SA|Breitling]]. 

Later, the chronographs gained their current form. In 1934 the Breitling chronographs received the second chronograph button with the function of returning the seconds hand to zero. Thus it became possible to measure short intervals of time using the add function. However the patent of the flyback chronograph belongs to [[Longines]] with its first flyback chronograph dating back to 1936.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1469">'''Foundered strata''' is a term used by the [[British Geological Survey]] in its maps and geological memoirs, and indeed by other authors, to describe [[rock strata]] which have collapsed due, for example, to the [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] of underlying strata. Foundered strata may retain original [[bedding]] more or less intact or they may assume a chaotic structure in the process of collapse or some intermediate state of disruption.

Examples of foundered strata are found along the northern margin of the outcrop of the [[Marros Group|Twrch Sandstone]] (the former Basal Grit of the [[Millstone Grit]]) in the [[Brecon Beacons National Park]] of South [[Wales]]. The immediately underlying [[Carboniferous Limestone]] has dissolved away in numerous locations such as at Pwll Byfre and resulted in the wholesale collapse of the sandstone beds above it. It is thought that the sandstone has been let down several hundred feet in places due to the removal by solution of limestone strata.&lt;ref&gt;T.R.Owen, ''Geology Explained in South Wales'', David &amp; Charles 1973&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;British Geological Survey 1:50,000 map sheet 231 'Merthyr Tydfil' and accompanying memoir&lt;/ref&gt;

He immigrated to the USA in 1959 and worked as information specialist for the [[National Library of Medicine]] in Bethesda, Maryland from 1965–68. He was a professor at the [[University of Illinois]], Urbana from 1972-92 and professor emeritus from 1992-2013. He continued as an honored scholar after retirement speaking on the evolution of librarianship in the 20th and 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Speaker at An International Conference for Yunnan Provincial Library’s 100th Anniversary November 16-17, 2009, Kunming, China  "'''The Changing Face of a Profession: Librarianship as a Career from 1949-2009'''." by FW Lancaster, Professor Emeritus, University of Illinois.

Conference title: “Multilevel, Multicultural &amp; Multiethnic Information Society.” in absentia.&lt;/ref&gt; Lancaster made notable achievements with early [[Information system|online retrieval systems]], including evaluation studies of [[MEDLARS]].  He published broadly in [[Library and Information Science]] over a period of four decades and continuously emerged as a visionary leader in the field, where research, writing, and teaching earned him the highest honors in the profession. Lancaster excelled at many fronts: as scholar, educator, mentor, and writer.

'''''Fundamentals of Stack Gas Dispersion''''' is a book devoted to the fundamentals of [[air pollution dispersion modeling]] of continuous, [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|buoyant pollution plumes]] from [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|stationary point sources]]. The first edition was published in 1979. The current fourth edition was published in 2005.

The subjects covered in the book include atmospheric [[turbulence]] and [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|stability classes]], buoyant plume rise, Gaussian dispersion calculations and modeling, time-averaged concentrations, wind velocity profiles, fumigations, trapped plumes and [[gas flare]] stack plumes.  The constraints and assumptions involved in the basic equations are fully explained.

The book has received favorable reviews, including a description of its "simple straightforward explanations" for a "full course in single-source dispersive modeling".&lt;ref&gt;''Atmospheric Environment'', Volume 29, Issue 22, November 1995, page 3397, Elsevier B.V., reviewed by James P. Lodge. {{DOI|10.1016/1352-2310(95)90214-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society'', January 1997, pages 90-94, American Meteorological Society, reviewed by Karen Kowalewsky&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Chemical Engineering Progress'', August 1995, page 88, American Institute of Chemical Engineers, reviewed by Stanley S. Grossel&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has been purchased in 84 countries and as of 2015 is available in 233 libraries worldwide.&lt;ref name=lists&gt;[http://www.air-dispersion.com/interest.html Complete lists of countries, libraries and references/citations]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005020946/http://www.air-dispersion.com/interest.html |date=October 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been referenced or cited as an educational resource more than 880 times in the technical literature and on the Internet, including 34 regulatory publications of state or national governmental agencies worldwide.

This [[transmembrane]] [[glycoprotein]] complex is composed of four subunits: GPIbα, GPIbβ, GPV and GPIX. Each of them has a variable number of [[leucine]]-rich repeats. GPIbα and GPIbβ are linked by [[disulfide]] bridges, while the GPV and GPIX associate non-[[covalent]]ly with the complex. GPIbα subunit bears the binding site for [[von Willebrand factor]] (vWF), α-thrombin, leukocyte integrin αMβ2 and P-selectin. The binding between GPIbα and vWF mediates the capture of platelets to the injured vascular wall. The deficiency in glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex synthesis leads to Bernard-Soulier syndrome.&lt;ref&gt; LEPAGE, A., M. LEBOEUF, J.P. CAZENAVE, C. SALLE, F. LANZA a G. UZAN.

'''Homeopathy''' or '''homœopathy''' is a system of [[alternative medicine]] created in 1796 by [[Samuel Hahnemann]], based on his doctrine of ''like cures like'' (''[[similia similibus curentur]]''), a claim that a substance that causes the symptoms of a disease in healthy people would cure similar symptoms in sick people.&lt;ref name="Hahnemann"/&gt; Homeopathy is a [[pseudoscience]] – a belief that is incorrectly presented as scientific.&lt;ref name=Tuomela/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baran2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ladyman/&gt; Homeopathic preparations are not effective for treating any condition; large-scale studies have found homeopathy to be no more effective than a [[placebo]], indicating that any positive effects that follow treatment are due to factors such as normal recovery from illness, or [[regression toward the mean]].&lt;ref name=pmid12492603/&gt;&lt;ref name="shang"/&gt;&lt;ref name=inquiry_4504/&gt;

Hahnemann believed the underlying causes of disease were phenomena that he termed ''miasms'', and that homeopathic preparations addressed these. The preparations are manufactured using a process of [[homeopathic dilution]], in which a chosen substance is repeatedly diluted in alcohol or distilled water, each time with the containing vessel being struck against an elastic material, commonly a [[Bookbinding|leather-bound]] book.&lt;ref name="Organon_6th_128"/&gt; Dilution typically continues well past the point where no [[molecule]]s of the original substance remain.&lt;!-- THIS REF IS THE SAME AS ref name "dynam" --&gt;&lt;ref name="Dynamization and Dilution"&gt;{{cite web |title=Dynamization and dilution |work=Complementary and Alternative Medicine |publisher=[[Creighton University]] Department of Pharmacology |url=http://altmed.creighton.edu/Homeopathy/philosophy/dilution.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020826082134/http://altmed.creighton.edu/Homeopathy/philosophy/dilution.htm |archivedate=August 26, 2002 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=March 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Also: &lt;ref name=SmithHM /&gt;&lt;ref name="homsim" /&gt; --&gt; Homeopaths select homeopathics&lt;ref name="Consumer Reports" /&gt; by consulting reference books known as ''repertories'', and by considering the totality of the patient's symptoms, personal traits, physical and psychological state, and life history.&lt;ref name="Organon_5th_5+217"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Samuel Hahnemann|Hahnemann S]]|title =The Organon of the Healing Art |year =1833 |edition=5th |at=aphorisms 5 and 217 |isbn=978-0-87983-228-5|title-link =The Organon of the Healing Art }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical context===
The concept of "like cures like" may have been suggested by [[Hippocrates]] around 400 BC, when he prescribed a small dose of [[mandrake root]] to treat mania, knowing it produces mania in much larger doses.&lt;ref name="Hemenway1894"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.1894.02420900001001|title=Modern Homeopathy and Medical Science|year=1894|last1=Hemenway|first1=Henry Bixby|journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|issue=11|pages=367|volume=XXII}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in the 16th century, [[Paracelsus]] wrote "[[similia similibus curantur]]" (similar to the [[subjunctive]] form later used by Hahnemann), often translated as "what makes a man ill also cures him".&lt;ref name="Hemenway1894"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/442424/Paracelsus |title=Paracelsus (German-Swiss physician) |work=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate =March 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 18th and 19th centuries, mainstream medicine used methods like [[bloodletting]] and purging, and administered complex mixtures, such as [[Venice treacle]], which was made from 64 substances including opium, myrrh, and viper's flesh.&lt;ref&gt;

Hahnemann conceived of homeopathy while translating a medical treatise by the Scottish physician and chemist [[William Cullen]] into German. Being sceptical of Cullen's theory concerning [[cinchona]]'s use for curing [[malaria]], Hahnemann ingested some bark specifically to investigate what would happen. He experienced fever, shivering and [[arthralgia|joint pain]]: symptoms similar to those of malaria itself. From this, Hahnemann came to believe that all effective drugs produce symptoms in healthy individuals similar to those of the diseases that they treat, in accord with the "law of similars" that had been proposed by ancient physicians.&lt;ref name="UllmanReichenberg-Ullman1994"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert W.

Subsequent scientific work showed that cinchona cures malaria because it contains [[quinine]], which kills the ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' parasite that causes the disease; the mechanism of action is unrelated to Hahnemann's ideas.&lt;ref name="Atwood-BTTF1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/homeopathy-and-evidence-based-medicine-back-to-the-future-part-i/ | title=Homeopathy and evidence-based medicine: back to the future | publisher=[[Science Based Medicine]] | date=January 4, 2008 | accessdate=September 9, 2013 | last=Atwood |first=Kimball}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Provings"====
Hahnemann began to test what effects substances produced in humans, a procedure that would later become known as "homeopathic proving". These tests required subjects to test the effects of ingesting substances by clearly recording all of their symptoms as well as the ancillary conditions under which they appeared.&lt;ref name="Haehl1922"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Haehl|title=Samuel Hahnemann: His Life and Work : Based on Recently Discovered State Papers, Documents, Letters, Etc|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q80gR6OxDVsC&amp;pg=PA101|accessdate=January 24, 2013|year=1922|publisher=B.

Because Hahnemann believed that large doses of drugs that caused similar symptoms would only aggravate illness, he advocated extreme dilutions of the substances; he devised a technique for making dilutions that he believed would preserve a substance's therapeutic properties while removing its harmful effects.&lt;ref name="Dynamization and Dilution" /&gt; Hahnemann believed that this process aroused and enhanced "the spirit-like medicinal powers of the crude substances".&lt;ref name="Organon_5th_269"&gt;

In the ''Organon'', Hahnemann introduced the concept of "miasms" as "infectious principles" underlying chronic disease.&lt;ref name="ClarkeClarke2001"&gt;{{cite book |author= John Henry Clarke |title= Homeopathy explained |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZUGIWuo4qc8C&amp;pg=PA22 |accessdate=January 12, 2013 |date=January 1, 2001 |publisher= Nanopathy |pages=22–|id= GGKEY:JWCD56EF80T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hahnemann associated each miasm with specific diseases, and thought that initial exposure to miasms causes local symptoms, such as skin or venereal diseases. If, however, these symptoms were suppressed by medication, the cause went deeper and began to manifest itself as diseases of the internal organs.&lt;ref name="miasms"/&gt; Homeopathy maintains that treating diseases by directly [[Symptomatic treatment|alleviating their symptoms]], as is sometimes done in conventional medicine, is ineffective because all "disease can generally be traced to some latent, deep-seated, underlying chronic, or inherited tendency".&lt;ref&gt;

Hahnemann's [[hypotheses]] for the direct or remote cause of all chronic diseases (miasms) originally presented only three, psora (the itch), syphilis (venereal disease) or sycosis (fig-wart disease).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=1911|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc|edition=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Homoeopathy|accessdate=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these three the most important was ''psora'' (Greek for "itch"), described as being related to any itching diseases of the skin, supposed to be derived from suppressed [[scabies]], and claimed to be the foundation of many further disease conditions. Hahnemann believed psora to be the cause of such diseases as [[epilepsy]], [[cancer]], [[jaundice]], [[deafness]], and [[cataracts]].&lt;ref name="Hahnemann_Chronic"&gt;

Hahnemann's miasm theory remains disputed and controversial within homeopathy even in modern times. The theory of miasms has been criticized as an explanation developed by Hahnemann to preserve the system of homeopathy in the face of treatment failures, and for being inadequate to cover the many hundreds of sorts of diseases, as well as for failing to explain disease predispositions, as well as [[genetics]], environmental factors, and the unique disease history of each patient.&lt;ref name=Shelton&gt;{{cite book |last=Shelton |first=JW |year=2004 |title=Homeopathy: How it really works |location=Amherst, New York |publisher=[[Prometheus Books]] |isbn=978-1-59102-109-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|148–9|date=November 2012}}

===19th century: rise to popularity and early criticism===
Homeopathy achieved its greatest popularity in the 19th century. It was introduced to the United States in 1825 by Hans Birch Gram, a student of Hahnemann.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite book | last = Miller | first = Timothy | authorlink = Timothy Miller | title = America's alternative religions | publisher = State University of New York Press, Albany | date = 1995 | pages = 80 | isbn = 978-0-7914-2397-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first homeopathic school in the US opened in 1835, and in 1844, the first US national medical association, the [[American Institute of Homeopathy]], was established. Throughout the 19th century, dozens of homeopathic institutions appeared in Europe and the United States,&lt;ref name=Julian&gt;

From its inception, however, homeopathy was criticized by mainstream science. [[John Forbes (physician)|Sir John Forbes]], physician to [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], said in 1843 that the extremely small doses of homeopathy were regularly derided as useless, "an outrage to human reason".&lt;ref name=John_Forbes&gt;

According to [[:de:Paul Ulrich Unschuld|Paul Ulrich Unschuld]], the [[Nazi]] regime in Germany was fascinated by homeopathy, and spent large sums of money on researching its mechanisms, but without gaining a positive result.

Since the beginning of the 21st century a series of meta analysis has further shown that therapeutic claims of Homeopathy lack scientific justification.&lt;ref name="champe"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crockett |first1=Chambers |title=Death by homeopathy: issues for civil, criminal and coronial law and for health service policy |pmid=22558899 |journal=Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=454–78 |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2010 report, the Science and Technology Committee of the United Kingdom House of Commons recommended that homeopathy should no longer be a beneficiary of NHS funding due its lack of scientific credibility;&lt;ref name="champe" /&gt; funding ceased in 2017.&lt;ref name="TNHS"/&gt; In March 2015, the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia published an information paper on Homeopathy. The main findings of the report were 'there are no health conditions for which there is reliable evidence that homeopathy is effective". Reactions to the report sparked world headlines which suggested that the NHMRC had found that homeopathy is not effective for all conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Australian report |url=https://www.hri-research.org/resources/homeopathy-the-debate/the-australian-report-on-homeopathy/ |website=HRI Research |publisher=Hri Research |accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Australian pharmacies ignored recommendations for a homeopathic ban in the broader scope of the federal government accepting only three of the 45 recommendations made by the review of Pharmacy Remuneration and Regulation (which were delivered in September 2017 to Health Minister [[Greg Hunt]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Abusson |first1=Kate |title=Pharmacies avoid homeopathy ban as government parks recommendations |date=3 May 2018 |url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/pharmacies-avoid-homeopathy-ban-as-government-parks-recommendations-20180503-p4zd94.html |work=Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practitioners rely on two types of reference when prescribing: ''[[Homeopathic Materia Medica|Materia Medica]]'' and repertories. A homeopathic ''materia medica'' is a collection of "drug pictures", organized alphabetically. These entries describe the symptom patterns associated with individual preparations. A homeopathic repertory is an index of disease symptoms that lists preparations associated with specific symptoms. In both cases different compilers may dispute particular inclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Jonas: Mosby's Dictionary of Complementary and Alternative Medicine. (c) 2005, Elsevier&lt;/ref&gt; The first symptomatic homeopathic ''materia medica'' was arranged by Hahnemann. The first homeopathic repertory was Georg Jahr's ''Symptomenkodex'', published in German in 1835, and translated into English as the ''Repertory to the more Characteristic Symptoms of Materia Medica'' by Constantine Hering in 1838.
This version was less focused on disease categories and was the forerunner to later works by James Tyler Kent.&lt;ref name="pmid16322800"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bellavite |first1=Paolo |last2=Conforti |first2=Anita |last3=Piasere |first3=Valeria |last4=Ortolani |first4=Riccardo

Homeopathy uses animal, plant, mineral, and synthetic substances in its preparations, generally referring to them using [[Latin]] or faux-Latin names. Examples include ''[[arsenicum album]]'' (arsenic oxide), ''natrum muriaticum'' ([[sodium chloride]] or table salt), ''[[Lachesis muta]]'' (the venom of the [[Lachesis (genus)|bushmaster snake]]), ''[[opium]]'', and ''thyroidinum'' ([[thyroid hormone]]).

Some homeopaths use so-called "'''nosodes'''" (from the Greek ''nosos'', disease) made from diseased or pathological products such as fecal, urinary, and respiratory discharges, blood, and tissue.&lt;ref name="pmid16322800"/&gt; Conversely, preparations made from "healthy" specimens are called "sarcodes".

Some modern homeopaths use preparations they call "imponderables" because they do not originate from a substance but some other phenomenon presumed to have been "captured" by alcohol or [[lactose]].&lt;!--See next two sources, and the rest of the journal issue they came from for more information--&gt; Examples include [[X-ray]]s&lt;ref&gt;

Other minority practices include paper preparations, where the substance and dilution are written on pieces of paper and either pinned to the patients' clothing, put in their pockets, or placed under glasses of water that are then given to the patients, and the use of [[radionics]] to manufacture preparations. Such practices have been strongly criticized by classical homeopaths as unfounded, speculative, and verging upon magic and superstition.&lt;ref&gt;

===Preparation===
[[File:Mortar2.jpg|thumb|[[Mortar and pestle]] used for grinding insoluble solids, such as [[platinum]], into homeopathic preparations]]

Hahnemann found that undiluted doses caused reactions, sometimes dangerous ones, so specified that preparations be given at the lowest possible dose. He found that this reduced potency as well as side-effects, but formed the view that vigorous shaking and striking on an elastic surface – a process he termed ''Schütteln'', translated as ''succussion'' – nullified this.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common explanation for his settling on this process is said to be that he found preparations subjected to agitation in transit, such as in saddle bags or in a carriage, were more "potent".&lt;ref name=Shelton /&gt;{{rp|16|date=January 2015}} Hahnemann had a saddle-maker construct a special wooden striking board covered in leather on one side and stuffed with horsehair.&lt;ref name=Goldacre2008&gt;{{cite book |author=Goldacre, Ben |year=2008 |title=Bad Science |location=London |publisher=[[Fourth Estate (imprint)|Fourth Estate]] |isbn=978-0-00-724019-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|31}} Insoluble solids, such as [[granite]], [[diamond]], and [[platinum]], are diluted by grinding them with lactose ("[[trituration]]").&lt;ref name="Shelton"/&gt;{{rp|23}}

The process of dilution and succussion is termed "dynamization" or "potentization" by homeopaths.&lt;ref name="Organon_6th_128"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In industrial manufacture this may be done by machine.

Serial dilution is achieved by taking an amount of the mixture and adding solvent, but the "Korsakovian" method may also be used, whereby the vessel in which the preparations are manufactured is emptied, refilled with solvent, and the volume of fluid adhering to the walls of the vessel is deemed sufficient for the new batch.&lt;ref name=Shelton /&gt;{{rp|270|date=January 2015}} The Korsakovian method is sometimes referred to as K on the label of a homeopathic preparation, e.g. 200CK is a 200C preparation made using the Korsakovian method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homeopathy: Diluted out of existence?|url=http://www.scilogs.com/in_scientio_veritas/homeopathy-diluted-out-of-existence/|publisher=scilogs.com/in_scientio_veritas|accessdate=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homeopathic Medicine Potency or Dilution |url=http://www.ritecare.com/homeopathic/guide_potency.asp |publisher=ritecare.com |accessdate=June 15, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821064849/http://www.ritecare.com/homeopathic/guide_potency.asp |archivedate=August 21, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fluxion and radionics methods of preparation do not require succussion.&lt;ref name=Shelton /&gt;{{rp|171|date=January 2015}} There are differences of opinion on the number and force of strikes, and some practitioners dispute the need for succussion at all while others reject the Korsakovian and other non-classical preparations. There are no laboratory assays and the importance and techniques for succussion cannot be determined with any certainty from the literature.&lt;ref name=Shelton /&gt;{{rp|67–69|date=January 2015}}

===Dilutions===
{{Main|Homeopathic dilutions}}

Three main [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] potency scales are in regular use in homeopathy. Hahnemann created the "centesimal" or "C scale", diluting a substance by a factor of 100 at each stage. The centesimal scale was favoured by Hahnemann for most of his life.

A 2C dilution requires a substance to be diluted to one part in 100, and then some of that diluted solution diluted by a further factor of 100.

This works out to one part of the original substance in 10,000 parts of the solution.&lt;ref&gt;
In standard chemistry, this produces a substance with a concentration of 0.01%, measured by the [[Concentration#Volume-volume percentage|volume-volume percentage]] method.&lt;/ref&gt; A 6C dilution repeats this process six times, ending up with the original substance diluted by a factor of 100&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;=10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; (one part in one trillion or 1/1,000,000,000,000). Higher dilutions follow the same pattern.

In homeopathy, a solution that is more dilute is described as having a higher "potency", and more dilute substances are considered by homeopaths to be stronger and deeper-acting.&lt;ref&gt;

Hahnemann advocated 30C dilutions for most purposes (that is, dilution by a factor of 10&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="Organon_6th_128"&gt;

In Hahnemann's time, it was reasonable to assume the preparations could be diluted indefinitely, as the concept of the atom or molecule as the smallest possible unit of a chemical substance was just beginning to be recognized.

The greatest dilution reasonably likely to contain even one molecule of the original substance is 12C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Page 3|title=Alternative Medicine: Homeopathy-A Review|url=http://www.ijopjournal.com/File_Folder/57-69.pdf|publisher=International Journal of Pharmacotherapy|accessdate=August 10, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903231608/http://www.ijopjournal.com/File_Folder/57-69.pdf|archive-date=September 3, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example given by a critic of homeopathy states that a 12C solution is equivalent to a "pinch of salt in both the North and South Atlantic Oceans",&lt;ref name=Bambridge/&gt;&lt;ref name=Andrews/&gt; which is approximately correct.&lt;ref&gt;
A 12C solution produced using [[sodium chloride]] (also called ''natrum muriaticum'' in homeopathy) is the equivalent of dissolving 0.36&amp;nbsp;mL of table salt, weighing about 0.77&amp;nbsp;g, into a volume of water the size of the Atlantic Ocean, since the volume of the Atlantic Ocean and its adjacent seas is 3.55×10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or 3.55×10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;L :

They were forbidden from consuming coffee, tea, spices, or wine for the duration of the experiment; playing chess was also prohibited because Hahnemann considered it to be "too exciting", though they were allowed to drink beer and encouraged to exercise in moderation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bradford|first1=Thomas Lindsley|title=The Life and Letters of Dr. Samuel Hahnemann|date=1895|publisher=Boericke &amp; Tafel|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1330001509|pages=103–04|url=https://archive.org/details/lifelettersofdrs00brad|accessdate=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the experiments were over, Hahnemann made the volunteers take an oath swearing that what they reported in their journals was the truth, at which time he would interrogate them extensively concerning their symptoms.

Provings are claimed to have been important in the development of the [[clinical trial]], due to their early use of simple control groups, systematic and quantitative procedures, and some of the first application of [[statistics]] in medicine.&lt;ref&gt;

For [[James Tyler Kent]]'s 1905 ''Lectures on Homoeopathic Materia Medica'', 217 preparations underwent provings and newer substances are continually added to contemporary versions.

Though the proving process has superficial similarities with clinical trials, it is fundamentally different in that the process is subjective, not [[Blind test|blinded]], and modern provings are unlikely to use pharmacologically active levels of the substance under proving.&lt;ref name=Creighton&gt;{{cite web |url=http://altmed.creighton.edu/Homeopathy/science/validity.htm |title=Are the principles of Homeopathy scientifically valid? |publisher=Creighton University School of Medicine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120816233729/http://altmed.creighton.edu/Homeopathy/science/validity.htm |archivedate=August 16, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1842, Holmes noted the provings were impossibly vague, and the purported effect was not repeatable among different subjects.&lt;ref name=Holmes /&gt;

=== Consultation ===
[[File:Rep1.JPG|thumb|Homeopathic repertory by James Tyler Kent]]

Homeopaths generally begin with detailed examinations of their patients' histories, including questions regarding their physical, mental and emotional states, their life circumstances and any physical or emotional illnesses. &lt;!--Examination of psychological state may include an inquiry into the content of dreams.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;"Modern Homeopathy And Medical Science"''''', Journal of the American Medical Association, vol 22, March 17, '''1894''', pp. 367–77, [https://books.google.com/books?id=e_0SAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA377&amp;lpg=PA377&amp;dq=%22law+of+similars%22+definition+ama&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bITPMPPwr9&amp;sig=56_xALWwOFWYa4P4BQKj0mjw-eo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=z7k6TeO1CpC-sQPK2I26Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=similars&amp;f=false].&lt;/ref&gt; outdated source, statement can be reintroduced when a better source is found --&gt;The homeopath then attempts to translate this information into a complex formula of mental and physical symptoms, including likes, dislikes, innate predispositions and even body type.&lt;ref name=Stehlin&gt;

From these symptoms, the homeopath chooses how to treat the patient using ''materia medica'' and repertories. In classical homeopathy, the practitioner attempts to match a single preparation to the totality of symptoms (the ''simlilum''), while "clinical homeopathy" involves combinations of preparations based on the various symptoms of an illness.&lt;ref name=pmid12614092/&gt;

===Pills and active ingredients===
[[File:DoseOscillococcinum.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Homeopathic pills, homeopathic preparation ''[[oscillococcinum]]'']]
Homeopathic pills are made from an inert substance (often sugars, typically lactose), upon which a drop of liquid homeopathic preparation is placed and allowed to evaporate.&lt;ref name="Ernst2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17710203 |year=2007 |last1=Sagar |first1=SM |title=Homeopathy: Does a teaspoon of honey help the medicine go down? |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=126–27 |pmc=1948865 |journal=Current Oncology |postscript=. |doi=10.3747/co.2007.150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of homeopathic dilution results in no objectively detectable active ingredient in most cases, but some preparations (e.g. [[Calendula officinalis|calendula]] and arnica creams) do contain pharmacologically active doses. One product, [[Zicam|Zicam Cold Remedy]], which was marketed as an "unapproved homeopathic" product,&lt;ref name=label_data&gt;[http://www.labeldataplus.com/detail.php?c=16034 Label data] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202326/http://www.labeldataplus.com/detail.php?c=16034 |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; contains two ingredients that are only "slightly" diluted: [[zinc acetate]] (2X = 1/100 dilution) and [[zinc gluconate]] (1X = 1/10 dilution),&lt;ref name=label_data/&gt; which means both are present in a biologically active concentration strong enough to have caused some people to lose their sense of smell,&lt;ref name=NYT1&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/17/health/policy/17nasal.html?hp | title=FDA Warns Against Use of Zicam | newspaper=The New York Times | author=Harris, Gardinier | date=June 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a condition termed [[anosmia]].

====Isopathy====
Isopathy is a therapy derived from homeopathy, invented by Johann Joseph Wilhelm Lux in the 1830s. Isopathy differs from homeopathy in general in that the preparations, known as "nosodes", are made up either from things that cause the [[disease]] or from products of the disease, such as [[pus]].&lt;ref name="pmid16322800"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Flower preparations====
Flower preparations can be produced by placing flowers in water and exposing them to sunlight. The most famous of these are the [[Bach flower remedies]], which were developed by the physician and homeopath [[Edward Bach]]. Although the proponents of these preparations share homeopathy's vitalist world-view and the preparations are claimed to act through the same hypothetical "vital force" as homeopathy, the method of preparation is different. Bach flower preparations are manufactured in allegedly "gentler" ways such as placing flowers in bowls of sunlit water, and the preparations are not succussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vanhaselen |first1=R |title=The relationship between homeopathy and the Dr Bach system of flower remedies: A critical appraisal |journal=British Homoeopathic Journal |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=121–27 |year=1999 |pmid=10449052 |doi=10.1054/homp.1999.0308}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no convincing scientific or clinical evidence for flower preparations being effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ernst |first1=E |title="Flower remedies": a systematic review of the clinical evidence |journal=Wiener Klinische Wochenschrift |volume=114 |issue=23–24 |pages=963–6 |year=2002 |pmid=12635462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Veterinary use====
The idea of using homeopathy as a treatment for other animals termed "veterinary homeopathy", dates back to the inception of homeopathy; Hahnemann himself wrote and spoke of the use of homeopathy in animals other than humans.&lt;ref name=Saxton2007&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Saxton |first1=J |title=The diversity of veterinary homeopathy |journal=Homeopathy |volume=96 |issue=1 |page=3 |year=2007 |pmid=17227741 |doi=10.1016/j.homp.2006.11.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FDA has not approved homeopathic products as veterinary medicine in the U.S. In the UK, [[veterinary surgeon]]s who use homeopathy may belong to the [[Faculty of Homeopathy]] and/or to the British Association of Homeopathic Veterinary Surgeons. Animals may be treated only by qualified veterinary surgeons in the UK and some other countries. Internationally, the body that supports and represents homeopathic veterinarians is the International Association for Veterinary Homeopathy.

The use of homeopathy in veterinary medicine is controversial; the little existing research on the subject is not of a high enough scientific standard to provide reliable data on efficacy.&lt;ref name=Hektoen&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hektoen |first1=L |title=Review of the current involvement of homeopathy in veterinary practice and research |journal=[[Veterinary Record]] |volume=157 |issue=8 |pages=224–29 |year=2005 |pmid=16113167 |doi=10.1136/vr.157.8.224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mathie|first1=RT|last2=Clausen|first2=J|title=Veterinary homeopathy: systematic review of medical conditions studied by randomised placebo-controlled trials|journal=The Veterinary Record|date=October 18, 2014|volume=175|issue=15|pages=373–81|doi=10.1136/vr.101767|pmid=25324413}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mathie|first1=RT|last2=Clausen|first2=J|title=Veterinary homeopathy: systematic review of medical conditions studied by randomised trials controlled by other than placebo.|journal=[[BMC Veterinary Research]]|date=September 15, 2015|volume=11|pages=236|doi=10.1186/s12917-015-0542-2|pmid=26371366|pmc=4570221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that homeopathy's effects in humans appear to be mainly due to the placebo effect and the counseling aspects of the consultation, it is unlikely that homeopathic treatments would be effective in animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lees |first=P. |last2=Pelligand |first2=L. |last3=Whiting |first3=M. |last4=Chambers |first4=D. |last5=Toutain |first5=P-L. |last6=Whitehead |first6=M.L. |date=2017-08-19 |title=Comparison of veterinary drugs and veterinary homeopathy: part 2 |journal=[[The Veterinary Record]] |volume=181 |issue=8 |pages=198–207 |doi=10.1136/vr.104279 |issn=0042-4900 |pmc=5738588 |pmid=28821700|quote=In human medicine, there may be a place for the counselling/psychotherapeutic aspects of homeopathic consults and the placebo effects generated by homeopathic products in patients who believe in such treatments, but in veterinary medicine these factors are unlikely to benefit patients, and the use of homeopathic products in veterinary medicine is contrary to best evidence, irrational, and inconsistent with current scientific and medical knowledge }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have also found that giving animals placebos can play active roles in influencing pet owners to believe in the effectiveness of the treatment when none exists.&lt;ref name=Hektoen/&gt; The British Veterinary Association's position statement on alternative medicines says that it "cannot endorse" homeopathy,&lt;ref name="BVA"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bva.co.uk/News-campaigns-and-policy/Policy/Medicines/Veterinary-medicines/ | title=Veterinary medicines | publisher=British Veterinary Association | accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Australian Veterinary Association includes it on its list of "ineffective therapies".&lt;ref name="AVA"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ava.com.au/12057 | title=Ineffective therapies | publisher=Australian veterinary association | accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 review of peer-reviewed articles from 1981 to 2014 by scientists from the [[University of Kassel]], Germany, concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the use of homeopathy in livestock as a way to prevent or treat infectious diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doehring|first=C.|last2=Sundrum|first2=A.|date=December 12, 2016|title=Efficacy of homeopathy in livestock according to peer-reviewed publications from 1981 to 2014|url=http://veterinaryrecord.bmj.com/content/early/2016/12/09/vr.103779|journal=Veterinary Record|language=en|pages=vetrec–2016–103779|doi=10.1136/vr.103779|issn=2042-7670|pmid=27956476|volume=179|issue=24|pmc=5256414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Electrohomeopathy====
{{main|Electrohomeopathy}}
Popular in the late nineteenth century, electrohomeopathy has been described as "utter idiocy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=18340908|year=1906|last1=Kempf|first1=EJ|title=European Medicine: A Résumé of Medical Progress During the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries|volume=4|issue=1|pages=86–100|pmc=1692573|journal=Medical Library and Historical Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrohomeopathy is somewhat associated with an Spagyric medicine in that the disease is usually multi-organic in cause or effect and calls for holistic treatment that is both complex and natural.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The Allahabad High Court in Kanpur handed down a decree in 2012 which stated that electrohomeopathy was an unrecognized system of medicine which was quackery.&lt;ref name="toie"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/Holi-Electro-homeopathy-clinics-to-be-sealed-after-the-festival/articleshow/12140070.cms |title=Electro-homeopathy clinics to be sealed after Holi |date=5 March 2012 |work=Times of India |accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evidence and efficacy ==

The low concentration of homeopathic preparations, which often lack even a single [[molecule]] of the diluted substance,&lt;ref name="Ernst2005"/&gt; has been the basis of questions about the effects of the preparations since the 19th century. Modern advocates of homeopathy have proposed a concept of "[[water memory]]", according to which water "remembers" the substances mixed in it, and transmits the effect of those substances when consumed. This concept is inconsistent with the current understanding of matter, and water memory has never been demonstrated to have any detectable effect, biological or otherwise.&lt;ref name=NatureWhenToBelieve&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maddox J|title=When to believe the unbelievable |journal=Nature |volume=333 |issue=6176 |pages=1349–56 |year=1988 |pmid=&lt;!--none--&gt; |doi=10.1038/333787a0|bibcode = 1988Natur.333Q.787. |type=editorial }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="delusion"/&gt; [[Pharmacological]] research has found instead that stronger effects of an active ingredient come from [[dose-response relationship|higher]], not lower doses.

Homeopaths contend that their methods produce a therapeutically active preparation, selectively including only the intended substance, though critics note that any water will have been in contact with millions of different substances throughout its history, and homeopaths have not been able to account for a reason why only the selected homeopathic substance would be a special case in their process.&lt;ref name=Smith2012/&gt; For comparison, ISO 3696:1987 defines a standard for water used in laboratory analysis; this allows for a contaminant level of ten parts per billion, 4C in homeopathic notation.

Physicist [[Robert L. Park]], former executive director of the [[American Physical Society]], is quoted as saying:

&lt;!--- Please do not change the following direct quote, even if you think it would be an improvement.

BEGIN DIRECT QUOTE --&gt;"since the least amount of a substance in a solution is one molecule, a 30C solution would have to have at least one molecule of the original substance dissolved in a minimum of 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,&lt;wbr&gt;000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 [or 10&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;] molecules of water.

&lt;!-- A similarly worded statement in page 56 of Park RL, "Voodoo science: the road from foolishness to fraud". Oxford University Press, 2002. ISBN 0-19-860443-2 --&gt;

Park is also quoted as saying that, "to expect to get even one molecule of the 'medicinal' substance allegedly present in 30X pills, it would be necessary to take some two billion of them, which would total about a thousand tons of lactose plus whatever impurities the lactose contained".&lt;ref name=Sbarrett/&gt;

No good-quality, well-designed studies with enough participants for a meaningful result reported either that homeopathy caused greater health improvements than placebo, or caused health improvements equal to those of another treatment."&lt;ref name=NHMRC&gt;{{cite book |author1=[[National Health and Medical Research Council]] |title=NHMRC statement on homeopathy and NHMRC information paper – Evidence on the effectiveness of homeopathy for treating health conditions |date=2015 |quote=There is no reliable evidence that homoeopathy is effective for treating health conditions. |location=Canberra |publisher=National Health and Medical Research Council |page=16 |isbn=978-1-925129-29-8 |url=https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines-publications/cam02 |access-date=August 18, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419065845/https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines-publications/cam02 |archive-date=April 19, 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 20, 2017, the European Academies' Science Advisory Council (EASAC) published its official analysis and conclusion on the use of homeopathic products, finding a lack of evidence that homeopathic products are effective, and raising concerns about quality control.&lt;ref name=EASAC2017/&gt;

====Publication bias and other methodological problems====
{{Further|Statistical hypothesis testing|P-value|Publication bias}}
The fact that individual randomized controlled trials have given positive results is not in contradiction with an overall lack of statistical evidence of efficacy. A small proportion of randomized controlled trials inevitably provide false-positive outcomes due to the play of chance: a [[statistical significance|"statistically significant"]] positive outcome is commonly adjudicated when the probability of it being due to chance rather than a real effect is no more than 5%―a level at which about 1 in 20 tests can be expected to show a positive result in the absence of any therapeutic effect.&lt;ref name="Sterne2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sterne |first1=JAC |last2=Davey Smith |first2=G |title=Sifting the evidence---what's wrong with significance tests?

In a systematic review of the methodological quality of randomized trials in three branches of alternative medicine, Linde ''et al.'' highlighted major weaknesses in the homeopathy sector, including poor randomization.&lt;ref name="pmid11416076"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Linde |first1=K|authorlink1=Klaus Linde |last2=Jonas |first2=WB |last3=Melchart |first3=D |last4=Willich |first4=S |title=The methodological quality of randomized controlled trials of homeopathy, herbal medicines and acupuncture |journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=526–31 |year=2001 |pmid=11416076 |doi=10.1093/ije/30.3.526}}&lt;/ref&gt; A separate 2001 systematic review that assessed the quality of clinical trials of homeopathy found that such trials were generally of lower quality than trials of conventional medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jonas|first1=WB|last2=Anderson|first2=RL|last3=Crawford|first3=CC|last4=Lyons|first4=JS|title=A systematic review of the quality of homeopathic clinical trials|journal=BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine|date=2001|volume=1|pages=12|doi=10.1186/1472-6882-1-12|pmid=11801202|pmc=64638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related issue is [[publication bias]]: researchers are more likely to submit trials that report a positive finding for publication, and journals prefer to publish positive results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sackett |first1=David L. |title=Bias in analytic research |journal=Journal of Chronic Diseases |volume=32 |issue=1–2 |pages=51–63 |year=1979 |pmid=447779 |doi=10.1016/0021-9681(79)90012-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pp"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosenthal |first1=Robert |title=The file drawer problem and tolerance for null results |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=86 |pages=638–41 |year=1979 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.86.3.638 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jeffrey D.

Positive results are much more likely to be false if the prior probability of the claim under test is low.&lt;ref name="pmid16060722" /&gt;

====Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of efficacy====
Both [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]], which statistically combine the results of several randomized controlled trials, and other [[systematic review]]s of the literature are essential tools to summarize evidence of therapeutic efficacy.&lt;ref name="PRISMA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liberati | first1 = A | last2 = Altman | first2 = DG | last3 = Tetzlaff | first3 = J | last4 = Mulrow | first4 = C | last5 = Gøtzsche | first5 = PC | last6 = Ioannidis | first6 = J PA | last7 = Clarke | first7 = M | last8 = Devereaux | first8 = PJ | last9 = Kleijnen | first9 = J | last10 = Moher | first10 = D | title = The PRISMA statement for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies that evaluate health care interventions: explanation and elaboration | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 6 | issue = 7 | pages = e1000100 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19621070 | pmc = 2707010 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000100 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early systematic reviews and meta-analyses of trials evaluating the efficacy of homeopathic preparations in comparison with placebo more often tended to generate positive results, but appeared unconvincing overall.&lt;ref name="LindeBMC-ComplementAlternMed2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Linde | first1 = K | last2 = Hondras | first2 = M | last3 = Vickers | first3 = A | last4 = Ter Riet | first4 = G | last5 = Melchart | first5 = D | title = Systematic reviews of complementary therapies – an annotated bibliography.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The evidence of bias [in the primary studies] weakens the findings of our original meta-analysis. Since we completed our literature search in 1995, a considerable number of new homeopathy trials have been published. The fact that a number of the new high-quality trials ... have negative results, and a recent update of our review for the most "original" subtype of homeopathy (classical or individualized homeopathy), seem to confirm the finding that more rigorous trials have less-promising results. It seems, therefore, likely that our meta-analysis at least overestimated the effects of homeopathic treatments.&lt;ref name=Linde1999&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Linde |first1=K |last2=Scholz |first2=M |last3=Ramirez |first3=G |last4=Clausius |first4=N |last5=Melchart |first5=D |last6=Jonas |first6=WB |title=Impact of study quality on outcome in placebo-controlled trials of homeopathy |journal=Journal of Clinical Epidemiology |volume=52 |issue=7 |pages=631–36 |year=1999 |pmid=10391656 |doi=10.1016/S0895-4356(99)00048-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Subsequent work by [[John Ioannidis]] and others has shown that for treatments with no prior plausibility, the chances of a positive result being a false positive are much higher, and that any result not consistent with the [[null hypothesis]] should be assumed to be a false positive.&lt;ref name="pmid16060722" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 21552759 | volume=45 | issue=3 | title=The role of plausibility in the evaluation of scientific research | author=Almeida RM | journal=Rev Saude Publica | pages=617–20| year=2011 | doi=10.1590/s0034-89102011000300021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A systematic review of the available systematic reviews confirmed in 2002 that higher-quality trials tended to have less positive results, and found no convincing evidence that any homeopathic preparation exerts clinical effects different from placebo.&lt;ref name="pmid12492603" /&gt;

In 2005, ''[[The Lancet]]'' medical journal published a meta-analysis of 110 placebo-controlled homeopathy trials and 110 matched medical trials based upon the [[Swiss Federal Council|Swiss government]]'s [[Program for Evaluating Complementary Medicine|Programme for Evaluating Complementary Medicine]], or PEK. The study concluded that its findings were "compatible with the notion that the clinical effects of homeopathy are placebo effects".&lt;ref name="shang" /&gt; This was accompanied by an editorial pronouncing "The end of homoeopathy",&lt;ref name=EndofHomeopathy&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |title=The end of homoeopathy |journal=The Lancet |volume=366 |page=690 |year=2005 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67149-8 |pmid=16125567 |issue=9487}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was denounced by the homeopath [[Peter Fisher (physician)|Peter Fisher]].&lt;ref name="Fisher-Lancet"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Homeopathy and The Lancet | last=Fisher |first=P | journal=Evid Based Complement Alternat Med | date=March 2006 | volume=3 | issue=1 | pages=145–47 | doi=10.1093/ecam/nek007 | pmc=1375230 | pmid=16550237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of these reviews are generally negative or only weakly positive, and reviewers consistently report the poor quality of trials. The finding of Linde ''et. al.'' that more rigorous studies produce less positive results is supported in several and contradicted by none.

Some clinical trials have tested individualized homeopathy, and there have been reviews of this, specifically. A 1998 review&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Linde |first1=Klaus |last2=Melchart |first2=Dieter |title=Randomized Controlled Trials of Individualized Homeopathy: A State-of-the-Art Review |journal=Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=371–88 |year=1998 |pmid=9884175 |doi=10.1089/acm.1998.4.371 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found 32 trials that met their inclusion criteria, 19 of which were placebo-controlled and provided enough data for meta-analysis. These 19 studies showed a pooled [[odds ratio]] of 1.17 to 2.23 in favour of individualized homeopathy over the placebo, but no difference was seen when the analysis was restricted to the methodologically best trials. The authors concluded that "the results of the available randomized trials suggest that individualized homeopathy has an effect over placebo. The evidence, however, is not convincing because of methodological shortcomings and inconsistencies." Jay Shelton, author of a book on homeopathy, has stated that the claim assumes without evidence that classical, individualized homeopathy works better than nonclassical variations.&lt;ref name=Shelton/&gt;{{rp|209|date=November 2012}} A 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis found that individualized homeopathic remedies may be slightly more effective than placebos, though the authors noted that their findings were based on low- or unclear-quality evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mathie |first=Robert T. |last2=Lloyd |first2=Suzanne M. |last3=Legg |first3=Lynn A. |last4=Clausen |first4=Jürgen |last5=Moss |first5=Sian |last6=Davidson |first6=Jonathan R.

===Explanations of perceived effects===
Science offers a variety of explanations for how homeopathy may appear to cure diseases or alleviate symptoms even though the preparations themselves are inert:&lt;ref name=Shelton/&gt;{{rp|155–167|date=November 2012}}
* The [[placebo effect]] – the intensive consultation process and expectations for the homeopathic preparations may cause the effect.
* Therapeutic effect of the consultation – the care, concern, and reassurance a patient experiences when opening up to a compassionate caregiver can have a positive effect on the patient's well-being.&lt;ref name="BrienRheumatology"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2010/11/08/rheumatology.keq234.abstract | title=Homeopathy has clinical benefits in rheumatoid arthritis patients that are attributable to the consultation process but not the homeopathic remedy: a randomized controlled clinical trial |author1=Brien S |author2=Lachance S |author3=Prescott P |author4=McDermott C |author5=Lewith G | journal=Rheumatology | date=June 2011 | volume=50 | issue=6 | pages=1070–82 | doi=10.1093/rheumatology/keq234 | pmid=21076131 | pmc=3093927}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unassisted [[healing|natural healing]] – time and the body's ability to heal without assistance can eliminate many diseases of their own accord.
* Unrecognized treatments – an unrelated food, exercise, environmental agent, or treatment for a different ailment, may have occurred.
* [[Regression toward the mean|Regression towards the mean]] – since many diseases or conditions are cyclical, symptoms vary over time and patients tend to seek care when discomfort is greatest; they may feel better anyway but because of the timing of the visit to the homeopath they attribute improvement to the preparation taken.
* Non-homeopathic treatment – patients may also receive standard medical care at the same time as homeopathic treatment, and the former is responsible for improvement.
* Cessation of unpleasant treatment – often homeopaths recommend patients stop getting medical treatment such as surgery or drugs, which can cause unpleasant side-effects; improvements are attributed to homeopathy when the actual cause is the cessation of the treatment causing side-effects in the first place, but the underlying disease remains untreated and still dangerous to the patient.

In 1987, French immunologist [[Jacques Benveniste]] submitted a paper to the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' while working at [[INSERM]]. The paper purported to have discovered that [[basophils]], a type of [[white blood cell]], released [[histamine]] when exposed to a homeopathic dilution of anti-immunoglobulin E antibody. The journal editors, sceptical of the results, requested that the study be replicated in a separate laboratory. Upon replication in four separate laboratories the study was published. Still sceptical of the findings, ''Nature'' assembled an independent investigative team to determine the accuracy of the research, consisting of ''Nature'' editor and physicist Sir [[John Maddox]], American [[Scientific misconduct|scientific fraud]] investigator and chemist Walter Stewart, and sceptic [[James Randi]]. After investigating the findings and methodology of the experiment, the team found that the experiments were "statistically ill-controlled", "interpretation has been clouded by the exclusion of measurements in conflict with the claim", and concluded, "We believe that experimental data have been uncritically assessed and their imperfections inadequately reported."&lt;ref name="delusion"&gt;

Some homeopathic preparations involve poisons such as Belladonna, arsenic, and poison ivy, which are highly diluted in the homeopathic preparation. In rare cases, the original ingredients are present at detectable levels. This may be due to improper preparation or intentional low dilution. Serious adverse effects such as seizures and death have been reported or associated with some homeopathic preparations.&lt;ref name=sr2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Referring specifically to homeopathy, the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]] Science and Technology Committee has stated:

{{quote|In our view, the systematic reviews and meta-analyses conclusively demonstrate that homeopathic products perform no better than placebos. The Government shares our interpretation of the evidence.&lt;ref name=inquiry_4504&gt;{{cite web |date=February 22, 2010 |title=Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy – Science and Technology Committee |publisher=[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]] Science and Technology Committee |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmsctech/45/4504.htm |accessdate=April 5, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|In the Committee's view, homeopathy is a placebo treatment and the Government should have a policy on prescribing placebos. The Government is reluctant to address the appropriateness and ethics of prescribing placebos to patients, which usually relies on some degree of patient deception. Prescribing of placebos is not consistent with an informed patient choice – which the Government claims is very important – as it means patients do not have all the information needed to make choice meaningful.

Beyond ethical issues and the integrity of the [[doctor-patient relationship]], prescribing pure placebos is bad medicine. Their effect is unreliable and unpredictable and cannot form the sole basis of any treatment on the NHS.&lt;ref name=inquiry_cfm/&gt;}}

The [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] of the United States' [[National Institutes of Health]] states:

{{quote|Homeopathy is a controversial topic in complementary medicine research. A number of the key concepts of homeopathy are not consistent with fundamental concepts of chemistry and physics. For example, it is not possible to explain in scientific terms how a preparation containing little or no active ingredient can have any effect. This, in turn, creates major challenges to the rigorous clinical investigation of homeopathic preparations. For example, one cannot confirm that an extremely dilute preparation contains what is listed on the label, or develop objective measures that show effects of extremely dilute preparations in the human body.&lt;ref name="nih-homeo"&gt;{{cite web

[[Ben Goldacre]] noted that in the early days of homeopathy, when medicine was [[Heroic medicine|dogmatic]] and frequently worse than doing nothing, homeopathy at least failed to make matters worse:

{{quote|During the 19th-century cholera epidemic, death rates at the London Homeopathic Hospital were three times lower than at the Middlesex Hospital. Homeopathic sugar pills won't do anything against cholera, of course, but the reason for homeopathy's success in this epidemic is even more interesting than the placebo effect: at the time, nobody could treat cholera. So, while hideous medical treatments such as [[blood-letting]] were actively harmful, the homeopaths' treatments at least did nothing either way.&lt;ref name="Goldacre: A kind of magic"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Goldacre|first1=Ben |title=A kind of magic? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/nov/16/sciencenews.g2 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=June 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1978, [[Anthony Campbell (physician)|Anthony Campbell]], then a consultant physician at the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, criticized statements by [[George Vithoulkas]] claiming that [[syphilis]], when treated with antibiotics, would develop into secondary and tertiary syphilis with involvement of the [[central nervous system]], saying that "The unfortunate layman might well be misled by Vithoulkas' rhetoric into refusing orthodox treatment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The science of homoeopathy, by G.

==Regulation and prevalence==
{{Main|Regulation and prevalence of homeopathy}}
[[File:Bristol Homeopathic.jpg|thumb|Hampton House, the former site of [[Bristol Homeopathic Hospital]].]]

Homeopathy is fairly common in some countries while being uncommon in others; is highly regulated in some countries and mostly unregulated in others. It is practised worldwide and professional qualifications and licences are needed in most countries.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; In some countries, there are no specific legal regulations concerning the use of homeopathy, while in others, licences or degrees in conventional medicine from accredited universities are required. In Germany, to become a homeopathic physician, one must attend a three-year training programme, while France, Austria and Denmark mandate licences to diagnose any illness or dispense of any product whose purpose is to treat any illness.&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt;

Some homeopathic treatment is covered by the public health service of several European countries, including France, Scotland, [[Luxembourg]] and England (though the latter will cease in February 2019).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NHS Homeopathic care to end in 2019 |url=http://portlandcentrehealthcare.co.uk/service/medical-homeopathy-bristol/ |website=Portland Centre for Integrative Medicine |accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other countries, such as Belgium, homeopathy is not covered. In Austria, the public health service requires scientific proof of effectiveness in order to reimburse medical treatments and homeopathy is listed as not reimbursable,&lt;ref&gt;

In the April 1997 edition of FDA Consumer, [[William T.

In 2011, the non-profit, educational organizations [[Center for Inquiry]] (CFI) and the associated [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] (CSI) have petitioned the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) to initiate "rulemaking that would require all over-the-counter homeopathic drugs to meet the same standards of effectiveness as non-homeopathic drugs" and "to place warning labels on homeopathic drugs until such time as they are shown to be effective". In a separate petition, CFI and CSI request FDA to issue warning letters to [[Boiron]], maker of [[Oscillococcinum]], regarding their marketing tactic and criticize Boiron for misleading labelling and advertising of Oscillococcinum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://www.centerforinquiry.net/news/cfi_and_csi_petition_fda_to_take_action_on_homeopathic_drugs/ |title=CFI and CSI petition FDA to take action on homeopathic drugs |publisher=Center for Inquiry|date=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, CFI filed comments urging the [[Federal Trade Commission]] to end the false advertising practice of homeopathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/newsroom/cfi_dawkins_ftc/|title=CFI and Dawkins Foundation Urge FTC to Stop Homeopathy's Falso Advertising|author=Press Release|publisher=CFI|date=November 23, 2015|accessdate=November 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 15, 2016, FTC declared that homeopathic products cannot include claims of effectiveness without "competent and reliable scientific evidence". If no such evidence exists, they must state this fact clearly on their labeling, and state that the product's claims are based only on 18th-century theories that have been discarded by modern science. Failure to do so will be considered a violation of the [[FTC Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2016/11/ftc-issues-enforcement-policy-statement-regarding-marketing|title=FTC Issues Enforcement Policy Statement Regarding Marketing Claims for Over-the-Counter Homeopathic Drugs: Efficacy and Safety Claims Are Held to Same Standard as Other OTC Drug Claims|author=Press Release|publisher=FTC|date=November 15, 2016|accessdate=November 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, [[CBC News]] reporter [[Erica Johnson]] for ''[[Marketplace (Canadian TV program)|Marketplace]]'' conducted an investigation on the homeopathy industry in Canada; her findings were that it is "based on flawed science and some loopy thinking". [[Center for Inquiry]] (CFI) Vancouver skeptics participated in a mass overdose outside an emergency room in Vancouver, B.C., taking entire bottles of "medications" that should have made them sleepy, nauseous or dead; after 45 minutes of observation no ill effects were felt. Johnson asked homeopaths and company representatives about cures for cancer and vaccine claims. All reported positive results but none could offer any science backing up their statements, only that "it works". Johnson was unable to find any evidence that homeopathic preparations contain any active ingredient. Analysis performed at the [[University of Toronto]]'s chemistry department found that the active ingredient is so small "it is equivalent to 5 billion times less than the amount of aspirin ... in a single pellet". Belladonna and ipecac "would be indistinguishable from each other in a [[blind test]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Johnson, Erica|title= Homeopathy: Cure or Con?

==United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 2015 hearing==
On April 20–21, 2015, the FDA held a hearing on homeopathic product regulation. Invitees representing the scientific and medical community, and various pro-homeopathy stakeholders, gave testimonials on homeopathic products and the regulatory role played by the FDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frazier|first1=Kendrick|title=CFI testimony urges FDA to regulate homeopathic products|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|volume=39|issue=4|pages=6–7|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Michael de Dora, a representative from the [[Center for Inquiry]] (CFI), on behalf of the organization and dozens of doctors and scientists associated with CFI and the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] (CSI) gave a testimonial which summarized the basis of the organization's objection to homeopathic products, the harm that is done to the general public and proposed regulatory actions:&lt;ref name=fdahearing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/NewsEvents/UCM443495.pdf|title=Homeopathic product regulation: evaluating the Food and Drug Administration's regulatory framework after a quarter-century. Testimony of the Center for Inquiry to the Food and Drug Administration|author=De Dora, Michael|publisher=FDA|date=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CFI testimonial stated that the principle of homeopathy is at complete odds with the basic principles of modern biology, chemistry and physics and that decades of scientific examination of homeopathic products shows that there is no evidence that it is effective in treating illnesses other than acting as a placebo. Further, it noted a 2012 report by the [[American Association of Poison Control Centers]] which listed 10,311 reported cases of poison exposure related to homeopathic agents, among which 8,788 cases were attributed to young children five years of age or younger,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|displayauthors=1|last1=Mowry|first1=J|last2=Spyker|first2=D|title=2012 Annual Report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers' National Poison Data System (NPDS): 30th Annual Report|journal=Clinical Toxicology|volume=51|issue=10|pages=949–1229|year=2013|url= https://aapcc.s3.amazonaws.com/pdfs/annual_reports/2012_NPDS_Annual_Report.pdf|doi=10.3109/15563650.2013.863906|pmid=24359283}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as examples of harm – including deaths – caused to patients who relied on homeopathics instead of proven medical treatment.&lt;ref name=fdahearing/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatstheharm.net/homeopathy.html|title=What's the harm in homeopathy|publisher=whatstheharm.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CFI urged the FDA to announce and implement strict guidelines that "require all homeopathic products meet the same standards as non-homeopathic drugs", arguing that the consumers can only have true [[Freedom of choice#In economics|freedom of choice]] (an often used argument from the homeopathy proponents) if they are fully informed of the choices. CFI proposed that the FDA take these three steps:
# ''Testing for homeopathic products'' The FDA will mandate that all homeopathic products on the market to perform and pass safety and efficacy tests equivalent to those required of non-homeopathic drugs.
# ''Labelling for homeopathic products'' To avert misleading label that the product is regulated by the FDA, all homeopathic products will be required to have prominent labels stating: (1) the product's claimed active ingredients in plain English, and (2) that the product has not been evaluated by the FDA for either safety or effectiveness.
# ''Regular consumer warnings'' Encouraged by the FDA's recent warning of the ineffectiveness of homeopathic products, CFI urged the FDA to issue regular warning to the consumers in addition to warning during public health crises and outbreaks.&lt;ref name=fdahearing/&gt;

In December 2017, the FDA announced it would strengthen regulation of homeopathic products focusing on "situations where homeopathic treatments are being marketed for serious diseases or conditions but have not been shown to offer clinical benefits" and where "products labeled as homeopathic contain potentially harmful ingredients or do not meet current good manufacturing practices."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frazier|first1=Kendrick|authorlink=Kendrick Frazier|title=FDA to Regulate Some Homeopathic Products; CFI Hails Move|journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]]|date=2018|volume=42|issue=2|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Official conclusions and recommendations ==

In March 2015, the [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] of Australia issued the following conclusions and recommendations:&lt;ref name=NHMRC/&gt;
* There is no reliable evidence that homeopathy is effective for treating health conditions.
* Homeopathy should not be used to treat health conditions that are chronic, serious, or could become serious.
* People who choose homeopathy may put their health at risk if they reject or delay treatments for which there is good evidence for safety and effectiveness.
* People who are considering whether to use homeopathy should first get advice from a registered health practitioner. Those who use homeopathy should tell their health practitioner and should keep taking any prescribed treatments.

In November 2016, The United States FTC issued an "Enforcement Policy Statement Regarding Marketing Claims for Over-the-Counter Homeopathic Drugs" which specified that the FTC will hold efficacy and safety claims for OTC homeopathic drugs to the same standard as other products making similar claims.&lt;ref name=FTC2016&gt;{{cite web|title=FTC: Enforcement Policy Statement on Marketing Claims for OTC Homeopathic Drugs|url=https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/996984/p114505_otc_homeopathic_drug_enforcement_policy_statement.pdf|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A November 15, 2016, FTC press release summarized the policy as follows:

:"The policy statement explains that the FTC will hold efficacy and safety claims for OTC homeopathic drugs to the same standard as other products making similar claims. That is, companies must have competent and reliable scientific evidence for health-related claims, including claims that a product can treat specific conditions. The statement describes the type of scientific evidence that the Commission requires of companies making such claims for their products... For the vast majority of OTC homeopathic drugs, the policy statement notes, 'the case for efficacy is based solely on traditional homeopathic theories and there are no valid studies using current scientific methods showing the product's efficacy.' As such, the marketing claims for these products are likely misleading, in violation of the FTC Act."&lt;ref name=2016PR&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: FTC Issues Enforcement Policy Statement Regarding Marketing Claims for Over-the-Counter Homeopathic Drugs|url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2016/11/ftc-issues-enforcement-policy-statement-regarding-marketing|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=November 18, 2016}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conjunction with the 2016 FTC Enforcement Policy Statement, the FTC also released its "Homeopathic Medicine &amp; Advertising Workshop Report", which summarizes the panel presentations and related public comments in addition to describing consumer research commissioned by the FTC. The report concluded:
:"Efficacy claims for traditional OTC homeopathic products are only supported by homeopathic theories and homeopathic provings, which are not accepted by most modern medical experts and do not constitute competent and reliable scientific evidence that these products have the claimed treatment effects."&lt;ref name="WSReport"&gt;{{cite web|title=Homeopathic Medicine &amp; Advertising Workshop Report|url=https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-staff-report-homeopathic-medicine-advertising-workshop/p114505_otc_homeopathic_medicine_and_advertising_workshop_report.pdf|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{String theory|cTopic=Theory}}
In non-technical terms, '''M-theory''' presents an idea about the basic substance of the [[universe]]. So far there is no experimental evidence that M-theory is a description of the real world. Although a complete mathematical formulation of M-theory is not known, the general approach is the leading contender for a universal "[[Theory of Everything]]" that unifies gravity with other forces such as [[electromagnetism]]. The goal of M-theory is to unify [[introduction to quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics]] with [[introduction to general relativity|general relativity]]'s gravitational force in a mathematically consistent way. In comparison, other theories such as [[loop quantum gravity]] are considered less elegant because they posit gravity to be completely different from forces such as the electromagnetic force.&lt;ref name=atlantic&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wolchover|first1=Natalie|title=The Best Explanation for Everything in the Universe|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/12/string-theory-everything/548774/|accessdate=7 February 2018|work=The Atlantic|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=quanta&gt;{{cite news|title=Physicists and Philosophers Debate the Boundaries of Science {{!}} Quanta Magazine|url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-and-philosophers-debate-the-boundaries-of-science-20151216|accessdate=7 February 2018|work=Quanta Magazine|date=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Devlin|first1=Hannah|title=Tying loose ends?

==Background==
In the early years of the 20th century the [[atom]]&amp;nbsp;– long believed to be the smallest building-block of [[matter]]&amp;nbsp;– was proven to consist of even smaller components called [[protons]], [[neutrons]] and [[electrons]], which are known as [[subatomic particles]]. Starting in the 1960's, other subatomic particles were discovered. In the 1970s, it was discovered that protons and neutrons (and other [[hadron]]s) are themselves made up of smaller particles called [[quarks]]. The [[Standard Model]] is the set of rules that describes the interactions of these particles.

In the 1980s, a new mathematical model of [[theoretical physics]], called [[string theory]], emerged. It showed how all the different subatomic particles known to science could be constructed by hypothetical one-dimensional "strings", infinitesimal building-blocks that have only the dimension of length, but not height or width.

However, for string theory to be mathematically consistent, the strings must be in a universe of ten [[dimension]]s. This contradicts the experience that our real universe has four dimensions: three space dimensions (height, width, and length) and one time dimension. To "save" their theory, string theorists therefore added the explanation that the additional six dimensions exist but cannot be detected directly; this was explained by sophisticated mathematical objects called [[Calabi–Yau manifold]]s. The number of dimensions was later increased to 11 based on various interpretations of the 10-dimensional theory that led to five partial theories, as described below. [[Supergravity]] theory also played a significant part in establishing the necessity of the 11th dimension.

These "strings" vibrate in multiple dimensions and, depending on how they vibrate, they might be seen in three-dimensional space as matter, light or gravity. It is the vibration of the string that determines whether it appears to be matter or energy, and every form of matter or energy is the result of the vibration of strings.

String theory as described above ran into a problem: another version of the equations was discovered, then another, and then another. Eventually, five major string theories were developed. The main differences between the theories were principally the number of dimensions in which the strings developed, and their characteristics (some were open loops, some were closed loops, etc.). Furthermore, all these theories appeared to be workable. Scientists were not comfortable with five seemingly contradictory sets of equations to describe the same thing.

Speaking at the string theory conference at the University of Southern California in 1995, [[Edward Witten]] of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] [[second superstring revolution|suggested that]] the five different versions of string theory might be describing the same thing seen from different perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://physics.usc.edu/Strings95/program.html University of Southern California, Los Angeles, Future Perspectives in String Theory, March 13-18, 1995, E. Witten: Some problems of strong and weak coupling]&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed a unifying theory called "[[M-theory]]", in which the "M" is not specifically defined but is generally understood to stand for "membrane". The words "matrix", "master", "mother", "monster", "mystery" and "magic" have also been claimed. M-theory brought all of the string theories together. It did this by asserting that strings are really one-dimensional slices of a two-dimensional membrane vibrating in 11-dimensional [[spacetime]]. Vibrations of higher-dimensional objects (as in three-dimensional vibrating blob or sphere or even more possible dimensions) are certainly a part of M-theory,&lt;ref&gt;https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/73808/does-string-m-theory-address-higher-dimensional-membrane-vibration-modes&lt;/ref&gt; but the basic theory of branes is still in progress. Higher-dimensional objects are much harder to mathematically calculate than a point in [[classical physics]] or a one-dimension string in string theory or two-dimensional membranes in M-theory.

==Status==
M-theory is not complete, but the mathematics of the approach has been explored in great detail. However, so far no experimental support of the M-theory exists.&lt;ref name=atlantic/&gt; Some physicists are skeptical that this approach will ever lead to a physical theory describing our real world, due to fundamental issues.&lt;ref name="Smolin_Response"&gt;[[Lee Smolin]], April 2007:[https://web.archive.org/web/20130621085800/http://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/joep/links/on-some-criticisms-of-string-theory/lee-smolins-response Response to review of ''The Trouble with Physics''] by [[Joe Polchinski]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, some [[cosmologists]] are drawn to M-theory because of its mathematical elegance and relative simplicity, triggering the hope that the simplicity is a reason why it may describe our world. [[Stephen Hawking]] originally believed that M-theory might be the ultimate theory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawking|first=Stephen|title=The Grand Design|date=2010|publisher=Bantam Books|isbn=055338466X}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later suggested that the search for understanding of mathematics and physics will [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|never be complete]].&lt;ref&gt;

 |title=Gödel and the end of physics
 |accessdate=2013-08-06
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One feature of M-theory that has drawn great interest is that naturally predicts the existence of the [[graviton]], a [[Spin (physics)|spin-2]] particle hypothesized to mediate the gravitational force; furthermore, M-theory naturally predicts a phenomenon that resembles [[black hole evaporation]]. Competing unification theories such as [[asymptotically safe gravity]], [[An Exceptionally Simple Theory of Everything|E8 theory]], [[noncommutative geometry]], and [[causal fermion systems]] have not demonstrated any level of mathematical consistency. M-theory's chief rival is [[loop quantum gravity]], a non-unifying theory; many physicists consider loop quantum gravity to be less elegant than M-theory because it posits gravity to be completely different from the other fundamental forces.&lt;ref name=atlantic/&gt;&lt;ref name=quanta/&gt;

Academic anthropological knowledge is the product of lengthy research, and is published in recognized [[peer-review]] periodicals. As part of this peer review, theories and reports are rigorously and comparatively tested before publication. The following publications are generally recognized as the major sources of anthropological knowledge.

==Four-field journals==
These journals publish articles in the four fields of anthropology: archaeology, biological, cultural, and linguistic.
* ''[[American Anthropologist]]'': premier journal of the [[American Anthropological Association]], incorporating all four fields.
* ''[[Current Anthropology]]'': published by the [[University of Chicago Press]] and sponsored by the [[Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research]]

'''Interactive geometry software (IGS)''' or '''dynamic geometry environments (DGEs)''' are [[computer program]]s which allow one to create and then manipulate [[geometry|geometric]] constructions, primarily in [[Euclidean plane geometry|plane geometry]]. In most IGS, one starts construction by putting a few points and using them to define new objects such as [[line (mathematics)|lines]], [[circle]]s or other points. After some construction is done, one can move the points one started with and see how the construction changes.

== History ==

The earliest IGS was the Geometric Supposer, which was developed in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schwartz |author2=Yerushalmy and Wilson
   | title = The Geometric Supposer: What is it a Case of? | publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates
  | year = 1993
  | location = Hillsdale, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was soon followed by Cabri in 1986 and The Geometer's Sketchpad.

== Comparison ==

There are three main types of computer environments for studying school geometry: supposers{{vague|date=July 2018}}, dynamic geometry environments (DGEs) and [[Logo (programming language)|Logo]]-based programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
  | last = Battista
  | first = M.T.
  | contribution = The Development of Geometric and Spatial Thinking
  | editor-last = Lester, Jr.
  | editor-first = F.K.
  | title = Second Handbook of Research on Mathematics Teaching and Learning
  | pages = 843–903
  | publisher = Information Age and the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics
  | place = Charlotte, NC
  | year = 2007
  | postscript = .}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Most are DGEs: software that allows the user to manipulate ("drag") the geometric object into different shapes or positions. The main example of a supposer is the Geometric Supposer, which does not have draggable objects, but allows students to study pre-defined shapes. Nearly all of the following programs are DGEs. For a related, comparative physical example of these algorithms, see [[Lenart Sphere]].

==Continuity versus determinism==

All these programs can be divided into two category: deterministic and continuous.
GeoGebra can be deterministic or continuous (one can change it in preferences).

All constructions in the deterministic programs (GSP, Cabri, Kseg and most of others) are completely determined by the given points but the result of some constructions can jump or behave unexpectedly when a given point is moved.

On the contrary, some constructions in continuous programs (so far only Cinderella and GeoGebra), depend on the number of hidden parameters and in such a way that moving a given point produces a continuous motion of the construction, as a result, if the point is moved back to the original position the result of construction might be different.

Here is a test to check whether a particular program is continuous:

Construct the [[orthocenter]] of triangle and three midpoints (say ''A', B' C' '' ) between vertices and orthocenter.

Construct a [[circumcircle]] of ''A'B'C' ''.

This is the [[nine-point circle]], it intersects each side of the original triangle at two points: the base of altitude and midpoint. Construct an intersection of one side with the circle at midpoint now move opposite vertex of the original triangle, if the constructed point does not move when base of altitude moves through it that probably means that your program is continuous.

Although it is possible to make a deterministic program which behaves continuously in this and similar simple examples, in general it can be proved that no program can be continuous and deterministic at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Kortenkamp, Ulrich (1999): Foundations of Dynamic Geometry, Dissertation, ETH Zurich 1999.

{{Nanotech}}
The use of '''nanotechnology in fiction''' has attracted scholarly attention.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Milburn, [http://www.dukeupress.edu/books.php3?isbn=978-0-8223-4265-6 ''Nanovision: Engineering the Future''], Duke University Press, 2008 {{ISBN|0-8223-4265-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scx.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/29/1/65 "Tiny Tech, Transcendent Tech&amp;nbsp;– Nanotechnology, Science Fiction, and the Limits of Modern Science Talk"] by Daniel Patrick Thurs in ''Science Communication'', Vol. 29, No. 1, 65–95 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyle.org/journal/issues/10-2/lopez.htm Bridging the Gaps: Science Fiction in Nanotechnology] by José López in ''International Journal for Philosophy of Chemistry'', Vol. 10, No.2 (2004), pp. 129–152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/v3/n4/full/nnano.2008.74.html "The Literature of Promises"] by Chris Toumey in ''Nature Nanotechnology'', Vol. 3, No. 4 (2008), pp. 180–181.&lt;/ref&gt; The first use of the distinguishing concepts of nanotechnology was "[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]]", a talk given by physicist [[Richard Feynman]] in 1959. [[K. Eric Drexler]]'s 1986 book ''[[Engines of Creation]]'' introduced the general public to the concept of nanotechnology. Since then, nanotechnology has been used frequently in a diverse range of fiction, often as a justification for unusual or far-fetched occurrences featured in [[speculative fiction]].&lt;ref name=bly&gt;Bly, Robert W., 2005, ''The Science In Science Fiction: 83 SF Predictions that Became Scientific Reality'', BenBella Books, Inc., {{ISBN|1-932100-48-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable examples==

=== Literature ===

In 1881 the Russian writer [[Nikolai Leskov]] wrote ''[[The Tale of Cross-eyed Lefty from Tula and the Steel Flea]]'', which included the concept of text that can be seen only through a microscope at 5,000,000 times magnification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auburn.edu/~mitrege/russian-culture/lefty.doc English translation of The Tale of Cross-eyed Lefty from Tula and the Steel Flea, Chapter the fourteenth: "If you had a better microscope that could ''magnify five million times''," he said, "you would see that each gunsmith had put his name on the shoes he made so that you know which Russian craftsman made which shoe."] [https://books.google.com/books?q=%22magnify+five+million+times%22 Google Books]. [http://az.lib.ru/l/leskow_n_s/text_0246.shtml#14 Russian original of Levsha]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, [[Boris Zhitkov]] wrote a short story called ''Microhands'' ([[wikisource:ru:Микроруки (Житков)|Микроруки]]), where the narrator builds for himself a pair of microscopic [[remote manipulator]]s, and uses them for fine tasks like [[eye surgery]]. When he attempts to build even smaller manipulators to be manipulated by the first pair, the story goes into detail about the problem of regular materials behaving differently on a microscopic scale.

In his 1956 short story ''[[The Next Tenants]]'', [[Arthur C. Clarke]] describes tiny machines that operate at the micrometre scale – although not strictly [[Nanometre|nanoscale]] (billionth of a meter), they are the first fictional example of the concepts now associated with nanotechnology.

[[Stanislaw Lem]]'s 1964 novel ''[[The Invincible]]'' involves the discovery of an artificial ecosystem of minuscule robots, although like in Clarke's story they are larger than what is strictly meant by the term 'nanotechnology'.

[[Robert Silverberg]]'s 1969 short story ''How It Was when the Past Went Away'' describes nanotechnology being used in the construction of stereo loudspeakers, with a thousand speakers per inch.&lt;ref name=bly/&gt;

The 1984 novel ''[[Peace on Earth (novel)|Peace on Earth]]'' by [[Stanislaw Lem]] tells about small bacteria-sized nanorobots looking as normal dust (developed by artificial intelligence placed by humans on the Moon in the era of cold warfare) that has later came to Earth and are replicating, destroying all weapons, modern technology and software, leaving living organisms (as there were no living organisms on the Moon) intact.

The 1985 novel ''[[Blood Music (novel)|Blood Music]]'' by [[Greg Bear]] (originally a 1983 short story) features genetically engineered white blood cells that eventually learn to manipulate matter on an atomic scale.

The 1991 [[novelization]] of ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', authored by [[Randall Frakes]], expands the origin story of the [[T-1000]] Terminator through the inclusion of a [[prologue]] set in the future. It is explained that the T-1000 is a 'Nanomorph', that was created by [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]], through the use of programmable Nanotechnology. This was only implied in the film itself.

The 1992 novel, ''[[Assemblers of Infinity]]'' is a science-fiction novel authored by Kevin J. Anderson and Doug Beason. The plot line makes specific mention of nano-assembly and nano-disassembly robots, along with admonitions regarding the dangers that these bacteria-sized machines might pose. 

[[Neal Stephenson]]'s 1995 novel ''[[The Diamond Age]]'' is set in a world where nanotechnology is commonplace. Nanoscale warfare, fabrication at the molecular scale, and self-assembling islands all exist.

The ''[[Trinity Blood]]'' series features an alien nanomachine found on Mars which is present in the body of the protagonist, Abel Nighroad. These nanomachines are known as Krusnik nanomachines, and feed on the cells of vampires.

Nanobots (called Nanoes) are central to [[Stel Pavlou]]'s novel ''[[Decipher (novel)|Decipher]]'' (2001).

[[Michael Crichton]]'s novel ''[[Prey (novel)|Prey]]'' (2002) is a cautionary tale about the possible risks of developing nanotechnology.&lt;ref name=schwarz&gt;Schwarz, James A., Contescu, Cristian I., Putyera, Karol, 2004, ''Dekker Encyclopedia of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology'', CRC Press, {{ISBN|0-8247-5050-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Prey'', a swarm of molecule-sized [[nanorobots]] develop intelligence and become a large scale threat.

[[Robert Ludlum]]'s 2005 novel ''[[The Lazarus Vendetta]]'' also focuses around nanotechnology, focusing mainly on its ability to cure cancer.

A nanomorph, term first coined by [[Science Fiction]] writer [[David Pulver]] in 1986's ''[[GURPS Robots]]'', is a fictional [[robot]] entirely made of [[nanomachine]]s. Its brain is distributed throughout its whole body, which also acts as an all-around sensor, hence making it impossible to surprise as long as the target is on line of sight. A nanomorph is arguably the robotic ultimate in versatility, maybe even in power.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Further uses of the concept could include using parts of its body as a tracking device, splitting the body for doing several tasks, or merging two nanomorphs in a greater one, or else gliding/flying in an [[ornithopter]]-like way (by molding itself like a giant, articulated [[kite]]). A common but facultative (without this feature, it would still qualify as a nanomorph) improvement is the ability to cover itself with specific colors and textures in a realistic looking manner (the ultimate being to look like a human, à la [[doppelgänger]]).

=== Film and television ===
One of the first mentions on a television show was an announcement to students over the school loudspeakers in the 1987 ''[[Max Headroom (TV series)|Max Headroom]]'' episode, "[[Academy (Max Headroom)|Academy]]" that, "Nanotechnology pod test results are posted in the Submicron Lab for your viewing."

The anime series ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex]]'' employs a plotline heavily involved in the use of "micromachines" as a form of treatment against complex diseases after a subject undergoing cyberisation.

In the ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe, from ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' onward, the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] use nanomachines, referred to as ''nanoprobes'', to assimilate individuals into their collective.

On the television show ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', nanobots played a notable role in series VII to IX. Nanobots are nanotechnology created to be a self-repair system for [[android (robot)|android]]s like [[Kryten]] as they can also change anything into anything else. Kryten's nanobots grow bored of their duties and take over the ship ''[[Red Dwarf ships#Red Dwarf|Red Dwarf]]'', leaving the crew to try and recapture it aboard the smaller ''[[Red Dwarf ships#Starbug|Starbug]]''. In the end the ship they are chasing is actually a smaller ''Red Dwarf'' built by the nanobots (which evaded their scanners in the end by coming aboard ''Starbug''), with the rest being changed into a planet. Once the crew discover this and find the nanobots, they force them to rebuild ''Red Dwarf'' (as well as [[Dave Lister]]'s then-missing arm). In the end the nanobots build an enhanced ''Red Dwarf'' based on the original design plans. They also resurrect the original full crew killed in the [[The End (Red Dwarf)|first episode]].

The episode [[The New Breed (The Outer Limits)|The New Breed]] of the show ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|Outer Limits]]'' featured nanobots.

Nanobots were also featured during the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] era of ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', where they were known as "nanites". They were depicted on the show as microscopic, bug-like, freestanding robots with distinct personalities.

Nanotechnology appeared several times in the TV series ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' and ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'', in the form of the [[Replicator (Stargate)|replicator]]s and the [[Asurans]], respectively. A "nanovirus" is also seen in ''Stargate Atlantis''.

In ''[[Cowboy Bebop: The Movie]]'' (2001), a criminal blows up a tanker trunk containing a nanobot virus that instantly kills thousands.

In the 2003 film ''[[Agent Cody Banks]]'', a scientist creates nanobots programmed to clean up oil spills.

In the 2004 film ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'', nanites are used to wipe out artificial intelligence in the event of a malfunction and are depicted as a liquid containing tiny silver objects.

In the 2005 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' television episode "[[The Empty Child]]/The Doctor Dances" a metal cylinder falling from space and lands in the time of [[World War II]]-era [[London]], breaks releasing nanobots which transform every human it comes into contact with into a [[gas mask]]-wearing zombie, like its first contact, a child.

In the 2008 film ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008 film)|The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'', the alien robot "GORT" disintegrates into a swarm of self-replicating nanobots shaped like bugs that cover Earth and destroy all humans and artificial structures by seemingly devouring them within seconds.

The revamped ''[[Knight Rider (2008 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'' television series and TV movie incorporate nanotechnology into the Knight Industries Three Thousand (KITT), allowing it to change color and shape, as well as providing abilities such as self-regeneration.

In the 2009 film ''[[G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra]]'', the main plot is to save the world from a warhead containing deadly nanobots called the "Nanomites", which if detonated over a city could destroy it in hours.

The popular NBC science fiction show, ''[[Revolution (TV series)|Revolution]]'', is based on a worldwide blackout due to the manipulation of nanotechnology.

In 2010 ''[[Generator Rex]]'' was shown on Cartoon Network. It was based on a laboratory experiment going wrong and infecting the world with bad "Nanites" which turned people into monsters known as E.V.Os.

In the ''Ben 10'' series, there is a nanotechnology-based alien called Nanomech, who first appeared in the live-action movie [[Ben 10: Alien Swarm]].

Nanotechnology is featured heavily within the ''[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]'' film series. The 1991 film ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' and 2015 film ''[[Terminator: Genisys]]'' feature the [[T-1000]] terminator. The T-1000 is composed of Mimetic Polyalloy, a liquid metal that utilizes nanites for shapeshifting abilities; Giving the T-1000 the ability to mimic anyone it samples through physical contact.  It can also form its arms into blades and stabbing weapons and instantly recover from any damage. In the 2003 film ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'' a new terminator, the ''[[T-X]]'', also utilities Mimetic Polyalloy for shapeshifting abilities; like the T-1000 it can mimic anyone it touches. The T-X is also equipped with nanotechnological transjectors, and can infect and control other Terminators using nanites.

In ''[[Terminator Genisys]]'', human resistance leader ''[[John Connor]]'' is infected with ''machine phase matter'' by a T-5000 terminator, transforming John into a ''[[T-3000]]''. Constructed entirely of nanocytes, the T-3000, like the T-1000 and T-X terminators, has shapeshifting and replication abilities. This unit's deadly nanocyte structure gives the T-3000 the unique ability to instantly scatter into particles and then quickly reform to avoid harmful impact as well as instantly recovering from damage.

In the 2014 film ''[[Transcendence (2014 film)|Transcendence]]'', the uploaded consciousness of Will Caster (Johnny Depp) uses nanotechnology to turn himself, and the local townsfolk, into a self-healing defense force with superhuman strength.

In Venture Brothers Season 6 Episode 3 "[[List of The Venture Bros. episodes#ep66|Faking Miracles]]" a laboratory accident leads nanobots to enter Dean Venture's body. Billy Quizboy and Peter White take remote control of the nanobots, inadvertently torturing Dean to showcase the power of the nanobots to Dr. Venture. Eventually they are used, unbeknownst to Dean, to improve his intelligence so that he can pass an entrance examination for college. In the post-credit scene Dean painfully urinates them out like a set of kidney stones.

In the 2018 [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'', the [[Black Panther (comics)|title character]]'s suit of armor is made of nanites that are stored in a necklace when not in use, and also have the ability to absorb and redirect kinetic energy as needed. In the 2018 MCU film ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', [[Iron Man]]'s armor is made up of nanites that are stored in the arc reactor in Tony Stark's chest. The nanites are able to self repair damage sustained to it. [[Spider-Man]]'s [[Iron Spider]] suit, also created by Stark, uses nanotechnology as well.

=== Computer games ===
In ''[[Total Annihilation]]'' nanobots are used to build structures.

In some games of the ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' series, the character Smoke is a cloud of nanobots.

In ''[[System Shock 2]]'' (1999), "nanites" are used as currency as well as a type of weapon ammo.

In ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]'' (2000), nanotechnology is an important part of both the plot and game mechanics. A very dangerous technology in the wrong hands, it provides a number of abilities to the protagonist.

The [[MMORPG]] ''[[Anarchy Online]]'' (launched 2001) is set on a planet with well-developed nanotechnology, which generally is used as magic in fantasy-themed games.

The protagonist of ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty|Metal Gear Solid 2]]'' (2001) had artificial blood infused with nanomachine that served functions such as healing. ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots|Metal Gear Solid 4]]'' (2008) featured a great deal of nanotechnology, such as the Sons of the Patriots, an artificial intelligence/nanomachine network that regulated and enhanced the actions of every lawful combatant in the world. In ''[[Metal Gear Rising Revengeance]]'' the main antagonist [[List_of_characters_in_the_Metal_Gear_series#Senator_Armstrong|Senator Armstrong]] also augments himself with nanotechnology.

In ''[[Red Faction]]'' (2001), nanotechnology is used on Mars to control miners, and ''[[Red Faction Guerilla]]'' (2009) features nanotechnology, in particular a device called the Nano Forge, as a major plot point.

The computer game [[Hostile Waters (game)|Hostile Waters]] features a narrative involving nanotech assemblers.

In the ''[[Ratchet &amp; Clank]]'' series, the health system involves nanotechnology. The nanotech can be upgraded by purchase in the first game, or by defeating enemies in other games of the series.

Nanotechnology is also found in ''[[Crysis]]'' (2007), ''[[Crysis 2]]'' (2011), and [[Crysis 3]] (2013).  The protagonists of these games are equipped with a "Nano Suit", which enables them to become stronger, invisible, heavily armored, etc.

In ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2]]'' (2009), [[Reed Richards]] creates nanites that are meant to control the minds of supervillains. However, the nanites evolve into a group mind called the Fold which serves as the primary antagonist for the game.

In ''[[SpaceChem]]'' the player has to build molecular assembler/disassemblers using nanomachines called "Waldos" controlled by a [[visual programming language]].

=== Comics and other media ===

In the manga series ''[[Battle Angel Alita: Last Order]]'', nanotechnology is referenced numerously and its use is heavily restricted, owing to the loss of Mercury as a potential planetary colony due to a [[grey goo]] catastrophe. Its danger and control has become one of the main driving narratives in the story.

In Dx13: Nano A Mano&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mangamagazine.net/read-manga/Dx13-nano-a-mano/5210/0/0?lang=en|title=Dx13: Nano a Mano|accessdate=2013-11-10|publisher=by Kirupagaren Kanni|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131110123148/http://www.mangamagazine.net/read-manga/Dx13-nano-a-mano/5210/0/0?lang=en|archivedate=2013-11-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; - a manga series by Kirupagaren Kanni - the protagonist uses nanobots to create a giant [[mecha]], which is remotely controlled by custom-built equipment such as electronic glove, microphones, cameras, etc.

Nanomites appear in the ''[[G.I. Joe (comics)#Devil's Due Publishing|G.I. Joe Reinstated]]'' series published by Devil's Due.

In the anime and manga series ''[[Black Cat (manga)|Black Cat]]'', Eve has the ability to manipulate nanomachines. Nanobots are later used for a variety of purposes, from turning victims into berserk warriors to granting Creed Diskenth immortality.

In the anime and manga series ''[[To Love-Ru]]'', the Transformation Weapons Golden Darkness and Mea Kurosaki have nanomachines within them, in the same manner as Eve from Black Cat.

In the anime and manga series ''[[Project ARMS]]'', the ARMS are weapons made from many nanomachines imbued into compatible biological beings, granting them a great variety of combative abilities and regeneration. The four protagonists each have an ARMS that have artificial intelligence, but the Keith series and the modulated ARMS do not.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2758">The '''Ohnesorge number''' ('''Oh''') is a [[dimensionless number]] that relates the [[viscosity|viscous force]]s to [[inertia|inertial]] and [[surface tension]] forces.  The number was defined by Wolfgang von Ohnesorge in his 1936 doctoral thesis.&lt;ref name=McKinley&gt;{{cite journal | first = Gareth H. | last = McKinley | last2 = Renardy | first2 = Michael | year = 2011 | title = Wolfgang von Ohnesorge | journal = [[Physics of Fluids]] | volume = 23 | page = 127101 | doi = 10.1063/1.3663616 |bibcode = 2011PhFl...23l7101M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Oh} = \frac{ \mu}{ \sqrt{\rho \sigma L }} = \frac{\sqrt{\mathrm{We}}}{\mathrm{Re}} \sim \frac{\mbox{viscous forces}}{\sqrt{{\mbox{inertia}} \cdot {\mbox{surface tension}}}} &lt;/math&gt;

Where

* ''μ'' is the liquid viscosity

==Applications==

The Ohnesorge number for a 3 mm diameter rain drop is typically ~0.002.  Larger Ohnesorge numbers indicate a greater influence of the viscosity.

This is often used to relate to free surface fluid dynamics such as dispersion of liquids in gases and in spray technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Lefebvre, Arthur Henry | title = Atomization and Sprays | publisher = Hemisphere Publishing Corp. | location = New York and Washington, D.C. | year = 1989 | isbn = 978-0-89116-603-0 | oclc = 18560155 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ohnesorge | first = W | title = Formation of drops by nozzles and the breakup of liquid jets | journal = [[Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics]] | volume = 16 | pages = 355–358 | date = 1936 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[inkjet printing]], liquids whose Ohnesorge number is less than 1 and greater than 0.1 are jettable (1&lt;Z&lt;10 where Z is the reciprocal of the Ohnersorge number).&lt;ref name=McKinley/&gt;&lt;ref name="Derby2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Derby|first1=Brian|title=Inkjet Printing of Functional and Structural Materials: Fluid Property Requirements, Feature Stability, and Resolution|journal=Annual Review of Materials Research|volume=40|issue=1|year=2010|pages=395–414|issn=1531-7331|doi=10.1146/annurev-matsci-070909-104502|bibcode=2010AnRMS..40..395D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Laplace number]] - There is an inverse relationship, &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Oh} = 1/\sqrt{\mathrm{La}}&lt;/math&gt;, between the [[Laplace number]] and the Ohnesorge number. It is more historically correct to use the Ohnesorge number, but often mathematically neater to use the [[Laplace number]].

'''Peggotty Bluff''' or '''Peggotty Camp''', is a [[Cliff|bluff]] on the north side and near the head of [[King Haakon Bay]], [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]]. 

==History==
In 1916, [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] party from [[Elephant Island]] established a camp, using the upturned ''[[Voyage of the James Caird|James Caird]]'' near the head of [[King Haakon Bay]] which they called Peggotty Camp, after the [[Peggotty]] family in [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'' who lived in a home made from a beached boat.&lt;ref&gt;Shackleton, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; While they were waiting in this location, [[Henry McNish]] took screws from the boat and put them in the crew's shoes in order that they could walk across ice more easily.

During the South Georgia Survey, 1955-56, King Haakon Bay was surveyed and the approximate position of the camp deduced. The name Peggotty Bluff was given to the feature now described, which is close to the ITAE campsite.

'''Peter C. Aichelburg''' (born 9 November 1941) is an Austrian [[physicist]] well known for his contributions to [[general relativity]], particularly for his joint work with [[Roman Ulrich Sexl|Roman Sexl]] on the [[Aichelburg–Sexl ultraboost]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Aichelburg, P. C. |author2=Sexl, R. U.  |last-author-amp=yes | title=On the gravitational field of a massless particle | journal=Gen. Rel.

== Life ==
Peter Aichelburg is the second child of Ludwig Aichelburg (born 1917) and Martha Michalek (born 1920), a descendant of the Bohemian line of the House of Aichelburg&lt;ref&gt;Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels, Band 12 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]].

Lectures by [[Walter Thirring]] influenced him to pursue theoretical problems. He was a postdoc at the [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics]] (ICTP), Trieste, Italy from 1968 to 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lise.univie.ac.at/physikerinnen/aktuell/pcaich2.htm Wissenschaftliche Laufbahn Peter C Aichelburg]&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview he recounts that his father was surprised that after such difficult studies he did not immediately obtain a tenured position.

Before his retirement in November 2007 Aichelburg taught at the [[University of Vienna]], where he held a position in the Institute of Theoretical Physics.

'''Radmilovac''' ([[Serbian language|Serbian]] [[Cyrillic]]: Радмиловац) is a [[List of Belgrade neighborhoods|suburban settlement]] of [[Belgrade]], the capital of [[Serbia]], and an [[experimental farm]] of the [[University of Belgrade]]'s Faculty of Agriculture. It is located in the Belgrade [[municipality]] of [[Grocka]].

== Location ==

Radmilovac is actually a westernmost extension of the Belgrade's suburb of [[Vinča]] (to which it makes no urban connections). It is located north of the road of ''Smederevski put'' which connects Belgrade and the town of [[Smederevo]]. It is located 14 kilometers&lt;ref name="Politika"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.politika.rs/scc/clanak/377487/Legat-u-kome-studenti-peku-zanat |author=Branka Vasiljević|title= Legat u kome studenti peku zanat|date=2 April 2017 |publisher=[[Politika]]|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; north-east of downtown Belgrade, between Vinča and [[Kaluđerica]] with [[Leštane]] being located right across the ''Smederevski put''. Right behind the settlement is the [[Vinča Nuclear Institute]].

== Farm ==

=== History ===

The experimental agricultural farm of Radmilovac, a section of the Faculty of Agriculture in Belgrade is the original core of the neighborhood. Farm originated from the lands [[bequest]]ed to the Faculty by the industrialist, [[deputy (legislator)|deputy]] and judge Milan Vukićević in 1941, when he died. His wife Radmila Vukićević was the first manager of the farm from 1941 to 1945 when she died, too.In 1947 the farm was named Radmilovac in her honor (Serbian for “Radmila’s place”).&lt;ref name="Politika"/&gt;&lt;ref name=zas&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = V.Vukasović | title = Radmilovac za ljude ili voćke | newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages =  25 | language = Serbian | year =  | date = 25 May 2008 | url = http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Beograd/Radmilovac-za-ljude-ili-vocke.lt.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II]] the land was [[nationalization|nationalized]], returned to the Faculty in the 1960s, taken by the state again and given to the PKB company, main agricultural supplier of the Belgrade market. In the late 1980s the farm was finally returned to the Faculty again. The reconstruction and expansion of the farm began in 2006, with new small fishponds and projected halls and covered areas.

=== Characteristics ===

Today the farm, mainly known for its [[orchard]]s, covers an area of 86 [[hectare]]s.&lt;ref name="Politika"/&gt; It is the largest agricultural [[gene bank]] in eastern and southeastern Europe.&lt;ref name=zas/&gt;

Orchards cover 15 hectares and are populated by apples, plums, peaches and pears, including one peach [[cultivar]] created here. Trees are planted differently from the usual way, with lesser space between them, only one meter apart (up to 3.000 seedlings per hectare). Anti-[[hail]] net is placed between the trees and a [[drip irrigation]] system is introduced. One section is reserved for the old local and new worldwide cultivars, including hundreds of unique fruit brands. Internationally known type of brandies are being produced here.

Vineyards spread over 13 hectares. Farm developed 23 new grape cultivars, 15 table and 8 wine varieties. Yield varies from 35 to 60 tons per year, with 20 tons internationally recognized brands of wines made of it.

Arable land covers 10 hecatares and includes several large [[greenhouses]].

The farm also contains [[bees]] gene bank and 40 [[beehives]]. They produce several different types of honey: [[black locust]], floral, [[sunflower]], multifloral (“meadow”). Curiosity is honey produced from [[sophora]] (“Japanese acacia”).

Center for fishery and applied hydrobiology occupies 5 hectares. Formerly, a stream flowed through the farm. It received [[wastewater]] from the neighboring settlements and was so polluted that it was named ''Šugavac'' (''[[Scabies]] stream''). It was conducted underground into the sewage system and instead an artificial short clean stream, named ''Little Danube''. It is 1.5 kilometers long and is a miniature representation of the entire [[Danube]]'s flow, from the [[Black Forest]] to the [[Black Sea]], including islands, peninsulas, hills, mountains and plains.Little Danube is populated with 40 fish species and plants were planted along its banks, both fishes and plants being characteristic for the "Big" Danube.&lt;ref name="mali"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/216406/Mali-Dunav-na-mestu-Sugavca-kod-Radmilovca|author=Dimitrije Bukvić|title= Sećanje Mali Dunav na mestu Šugavca kod Radmilovca|date=25 April 2012|publisher=[[Politika]]|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of fish ponds were created. Main species include [[common carp]] and [[trout]]. Inside the Center, there are 40 aquariums with numerous types of fish: [[common barbel]], [[huchen]], [[brook trout]], [[common minnow]], [[eel]], [[goldfish]], [[European mudminnow]], [[common roach]], [[common bream]], [[Wels catfish]], [[zander]] and [[Northern pike]], but also the genetically mixed fish population. The fishing of carp and catfish is allowed. One section is turned into the botanical [[water garden]] with 40 species of [[aquatic plant]]s, with  15 species of [[ducks]], 5 species of [[geese]], [[swan]]s and [[peacocks]] roaming between the ponds. In one pond a small artificial island is constructed and a fisherman’s house built on it that can be reached by walking over the short [[hanging bridge]]. In the house, the old tools used by the fishermen are exhibited, so as the model of ''tikvara'', old type of the fishing boat.&lt;ref name="Politika"/&gt;

Products of Radmilovac can be bought on the farm. They include wines, brandies, seedlings, but also some unusual products like a tomato [[fruit preserves#jam|jam]].&lt;ref name="mali"/&gt;

== Settlement ==

Radmilovac is a small, exclusively residential settlement of few dozen houses located around the hotel ''Radmilovac'', major such facility in the area between Belgrade and Smederevo. It developed on the hill above the farm, beginning in the late 1970s, and today has an estimated population of 500.&lt;ref name=zas/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7638">'''Social heuristics''' as a tool of [[bounded rationality]] are thought to guide behavior and decisions in the [[social environment]].&lt;ref name="Hertwig&amp;Hoffrage2013"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Hertwig | first1 = R. | last2 = Hoffrage | first2 = U. | doi = 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195388435.003.0001 | chapter = Simple Heuristics: The Foundations of Adaptive Social Behavior | title = Simple Heuristics in a Social World | pages = 3 | year = 2012 | isbn = 9780195388435 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Social environments tend to be characterised by complexity and uncertainty, and agents with limited informational or [[Cognitive Load|cognitive resources]] may rely on simple rules of thumb to make decisions. The class of phenomena described by social [[heuristics]] overlap with those typically investigated by [[social psychology]] and [[game theory]]. At the intersection of these fields, social heuristics have been applied to explain cooperation in the [[prisoner's dilemma]], based on the argument that cooperation is typically advantageous in daily life, and therefore people develop a cooperation heuristic that gets applied even to one-shot anonymous interactions (the so-called "social heuristics hypothesis" of human cooperation&lt;ref name="Randetal2014"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/ncomms4677| title = Social heuristics shape intuitive cooperation| journal = Nature Communications| volume = 5| year = 2014| last1 = Rand | first1 = D.

A. | last7 = Greene | first7 = J. D. | pmid=24751464 | page=3677}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
Within social psychology, some researchers have viewed heuristics as closely linked to [[cognitive bias]]es.&lt;ref name="Krueger&amp;Funder2004"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Krueger | first1 = J. I. | last2 = Funder | first2 = D.

According to them, social heuristics include those that may use social information, operate in social contexts, or both. For instance, the follow-the-majority heuristic uses social information as inputs but is not necessarily applied in a social context, while the equity-heuristic uses non-social information but in a social context such as the allocation of parental resources amongst offspring. Such heuristics may be used by humans and other animals, but may also be potentially applied to [[artificial intelligence|artificial intelligent systems]].

== Examples ==
Typical social heuristics as laid out in a seminal paper are:&lt;ref name="Hertwig&amp;Hoffrage2013" /&gt;

* '''Imitate-the-majority heuristic''', also referred to follow-the-majority heuristic. An agent using the heuristic would imitate the behavior of the majority of agents in his reference group.&lt;ref name=boyd&amp;rich2005&gt;Boyd, R., &amp; Richerson, P.J. (2005). "Solving the Puzzle of Human Cooperation." ''Evolution and Culture''. Cambridge MA: MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in deciding which restaurant to choose, people tend to choose the one with the longer waiting queue.&lt;ref name=raz&amp;ert2008&gt;Raz, O., &amp; Ert, E. (2008). ""Size Counts": the Effect of Queue Length on Choice Between Similar Restaurants." ''NA - Advances in Consumer Research Volume 35'' MN : Association for Consumer Research&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Imitate-the-successful heuristic''', also referred to follow-the-best heuristic. An agent using the heuristic would imitate the behavior of the most successful person in her reference group.&lt;ref name=boyd&amp;rich2005 /&gt;
* '''Equity heuristic''', also referred to 1/N heuristic. Using the heuristic means equally distributing resources among the available options. The heuristic was found to be successful in the stock market&lt;ref name=demig2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Demiguel | first1 = V. | last2 = Garlappi | first2 = L. | last3 = Uppal | first3 = R. | doi = 10.2139/ssrn.911512 | title = 1/N | journal =  SSRN Electronic Journal| year = 2006 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and also been found to describe parental resource allocation decisions: parents typically allocate their time and effort equally amongst their children.&lt;ref name=HertwigDS2002&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hertwig | first1 = R. | last2 = Davis | first2 = J. N. | last3 = Sulloway | first3 = F. J. | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.128.5.728 | title = Parental investment: How an equity motive can produce inequality | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 128 | issue = 5 | pages = 728–745 | year = 2002 | pmid =  12206192| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Social-circle heuristic'''. The heuristic is used to infer which of two alternatives has the higher value. An agent using the heuristic would search through her social circles in order of their proximity to the self (self, family, friends, and acquaintances), stopping the search as soon as the number of instances of one alternative within a circle exceeds that of the other, choosing the alternative with the higher tally.&lt;ref name="PachurHertwig&amp;Rieskamp2013" /&gt;
* [[Tit for tat|'''Tit-for-Tat heuristic''']]. In deciding whether to cooperate or defect, an agent using the heuristic would cooperate in the first round and in subsequent rounds, reciprocate his partner's action of cooperation or defection in the previous round.&lt;ref name="Axelrod1984"&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 0465021220 | title = The Evolution of Cooperation | authorlink1 = Robert Axelrod | year = 1984  | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The heuristic is typically investigated using a [[prisoner's dilemma]] in game theory, where there is substantial evidence that people use such a heuristic, leading to intuitive reciprocation.&lt;ref name=RandNowak2013&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2013.06.003| pmid = 23856025| title = Human cooperation| journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences| volume = 17| issue = 8| pages = 413–25| year = 2013| last1 = Rand | first1 = D. G. | last2 = Nowak | first2 = M. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Automatic vs. unconscious ==
In the dominant [[dual process theory|dual-systems approach]] in social psychology, heuristics are believed to be automatically and unconsciously applied.&lt;ref&gt;Chaiken, Y. &amp; Trope, Y. (1999). "Dual-process Theories in Social Psychology" NY: Guilford Press&lt;/ref&gt; The study of social heuristics as a tool of bounded rationality asserts that heuristics may be used consciously or unconsciously.&lt;ref&gt;Gigerenzer, G. (2004). "Fast and frugal heuristics: The tools of bounded rationality." ''Blackwell handbook of judgment and decision making'' Malden: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Society for Scientific Exploration''', or '''SSE''', is a group committed to studying [[fringe science]].&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1064461,00.html|title=Science on the Fringe|date=2005-05-24|publisher=[[Time magazine]]|author=Michael D. Lemonick/Gainesville|accessdate=2008-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opinions of the organization in regard to what are the proper limits of scientific exploration are often at odds with those of mainstream science.&lt;ref name=sheaffer /&gt; Critics argue that the SSE is devoted to disreputable ideas far outside the scientific mainstream.&lt;ref name=sheaffer/&gt;

==History==
The Society was founded in 1982. Its first meeting took place at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="sse_meeting"&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.scientificexploration.org/meetings.php | title = Meetings | publisher = Society for Scientific Exploration | accessdate = 2008-06-02 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071225142328/http://www.scientificexploration.org/meetings.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary inline|date=September 2016}}

Of the SSE and its journal, journalist [[Michael Lemonick|Michael D.. Lemonick]] writes, "Pretty much anything that might have shown up on [[The X-Files]] or in the [[National Enquirer]] shows up first here. But what also shows up is a surprising attitude of [[scientific skepticism|skepticism]]."&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;

==Activities==

===Journal===
The society's magazine, the ''Journal of Scientific Exploration'', was established to provide a scientific forum for [[ufology]], [[parapsychology]] and [[cryptozoology]], having published research articles, essays, book reviews and letters on those and many other topics that are largely ignored in mainstream journals.

The journal is currently edited by parapsychologist and philosopher  [[Stephen E. Braude]].

The Spirituality and Psychiatry Special Interest Group of the [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] says that the journal has reports about anomalies in science, particularly in the parapsychological and extraterrestrial fields.&lt;ref&gt;

====Criticism====
[[Kendrick Frazier]], editor of ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' and [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] fellow, has suggested that:&lt;blockquote&gt;The JSE, while presented as neutral and objective, appears to hold a hidden agenda. They seem to be interested in promoting fringe topics as real mysteries and they tend to ignore most evidence to the contrary. They publish "scholarly" articles promoting the reality of dowsing, neo-[[astrology]], [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]], and [[psychokinesis]]. Most of the prominent and active members are strong believers in the reality of such phenomena.&lt;ref name="CSICOP"&gt;{{cite press release

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Clinical community psychologist and professor of [[social psychology]] at the University of Connecticut [[Seth Kalichman]] regards the journal as a publisher of pseudoscience, with the journal serving as a "major outlet for UFOology, paranormal activity, extrasensory powers, alien abductions etc".&lt;ref name="Kalichman"&gt;{{cite book

[[Philosophy of science|Philosopher of science]] [[Noretta Koertge]] described the journal as an "attempt to institutionalize pseudoscience".&lt;ref name="PigliucciBoudry2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Massimo Pigliucci|author2=Maarten Boudry|title=Philosophy of Pseudoscience: Reconsidering the Demarcation Problem|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pc4OAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA175|date=16 August 2013|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-05182-6|pages=175–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptic [[Robert Sheaffer]] writes that the SSE journal has published articles implying that certain topics, like paranormal activities, [[dowsing]] and reincarnation, are true and have been verified scientifically. The articles, often written in impressive jargon by scientists with impressive academic credentials, try to convince other scientists that further research into those topics is warranted; but, Sheaffer argues, those articles failed to convince the mainstream scientific community.&lt;ref name=sheaffer&gt;{{citation |title= Uncritical Publicity for Supposed ‘Independent UFO Investigation’ Demonstrates Media Gullibility |journal= [[Skeptical Inquirer]] |volume= 22.5 |date= September–October 1998 |author= Robert Sheaffer |url= http://www.csicop.org/si/show/massive_uncritical_publicity/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Annual meeting===
The SSE holds an annual meeting in the US every spring and periodic meetings in Europe. In the US meeting, around a hundred of researchers who came to hear talks on, as journalist Michael Lemonick writes, "among other things, consciousness physics, astrology and parapsychology ... [M]any of the scientists here are on the faculty at major universities, and were doing fine at conventional research. But sometimes that gets boring."&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;

According to experimental psychologist [[Roger D. Nelson]], head of the [[Global Consciousness Project]], the SSE aims to "give everyone a respectful hearing. If we think a speaker is doing [[Pseudoscience|bad science]], we consider it our duty to criticize it. We get our share of lunatics, but they don't hang around long."&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;

===1998 UFO panel===
On June 19, 1998 it was reported that "an international panel of scientists" was convened to conduct "the first independent review of UFO phenomena since 1966", according to the wording used by [[Associated Press]]. The ''Skeptical Inquirer'' published an article by Robert Sheaffer who wrote that the SSE was a non-mainstream organization that was biased towards uncritically believing UFO phenomena, that the panel included many scientists that were UFO advocates but no scientists that were skeptics of UFO claims, and that all the uphold cases were old cases that had failed to convince any skeptic of its accuracy or veracity.&lt;ref name=sheaffer /&gt; These included the [[Cash-Landrum incident]], the [[Trans-en-Provence Case]] and the [[Aurora, Texas UFO Incident]].&lt;ref name=sheaffer /&gt;

==Membership==
As of 2005:
* the president was [[Charles Tolbert]], an astronomer at the [[University of Virginia]].&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;
* the editor of SSE's journal was [[Henry Bauer]], a dean emeritus at [[Virginia Tech]].&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;

As of 2008, the Leaders Emeritus&lt;!--(sic)--&gt; were [[Peter A. Sturrock]], from the Department of Physics &amp; Department of Applied Physics of [[Stanford University]] and [[Larry Frederick]] and Charles Tolbert from the Department of Astronomy of University of Virginia.&lt;ref name="sse_council"&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.scientificexploration.org/council.php | title = Council | publisher = Society for Scientific Exploration | accessdate = 2008-06-02 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080113160859/http://www.scientificexploration.org/council.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structuralism''' in [[psychology]] (also '''structural psychology''')&lt;ref&gt;Donald K. Freedheim, Irving B. Weiner (eds.), ''Handbook of Psychology'', Vol. 1: ''History of Psychology'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2003, p. 10; [[Arun Kumar Singh]], ''The Comprehensive History of Psychology'', Motilal Banarsidass, 1991, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; is a theory of consciousness developed by [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and his student [[Edward Bradford Titchener]]. This theory was challenged in the 20th century. It is debated who deserves the credit for finding this field of psychology, but it is widely accepted that Wundt created the foundation on which Titchener expanded. Structuralism as a school of psychology seeks to analyze the adult mind (the total sum of experience from birth to the present) in terms of the simplest definable components and then to find how these components fit together to form more complex experiences as well as how they correlated to physical events. To do this, psychologists employ introspection, self-reports of sensations, views, feelings, emotions, etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/569652/structuralism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bound&gt;https://www.boundless.com/psychology/the-history-of-psychology/origin-of-psychology/structuralism/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Titchener==
[[Edward B. Titchener]], along with [[Wilhelm Wundt]], is credited for the theory of structuralism. It is considered to be the first "school" of [[psychology]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uni.edu/tan/structuralism.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://psychology.about.com/od/historyofpsychology/a/schoolsthought.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. Because he was a student of [[Wilhelm Wundt]] at the [[University of Leipzig]], Titchener's ideas on how the mind worked were heavily influenced by Wundt's theory of [[Voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarism]] and his ideas of [[association (psychology)|association]] and [[apperception]] (the passive and active combinations of elements of consciousness respectively). Titchener attempted to classify the structures of the mind, like [[chemists]] classify the [[Chemical element|elements]] of [[nature]], into the [[nature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vardanyan |first=Vilen |date=January 2011 |title=Panorama of Psychology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q_23H6AtR2AC&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=titchener+heavily+influenced+by+wundt&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q=titchener%20heavily%20influenced%20by%20wundt&amp;f=false |publisher=AuthorHouse |pages=160 |isbn=978-1-4567-0032-4 |accessdate=November 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Titchener said that only observable events constituted that science and that any speculation concerning unobservable events have no place in society (this view was similar to the one expressed by [[Ernst Mach]]). In his book, ''Systematic Psychology'', Titchener wrote:
{{quote|It is true, nevertheless, that observation is the single and proprietary method of science, and that experiment, regarded as scientific method, is nothing else than observation safeguarded and assisted.&lt;ref&gt;Titchener (1929) ''Systematic Psychology: Prolegomena'', p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Mind and consciousness==
Titchener believed the mind was the accumulated experience of a lifetime. He believed that he could understand reasoning and the structure of the mind if he could define and categorize the basic components of mind and the rules by which the components interacted.

===Introspection===
The main tool Titchener used to try to determine the different components of [[consciousness]] was [[introspection]]. Titchener writes in his ''Systematic Psychology'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;The state of consciousness which is to be the matter of psychology ... can become an object of immediate knowledge only by way of introspection or self-awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Titchener (1929) ''Systematic Psychology: Prolegomena'', p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and in his book ''An Outline of Psychology'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;...within the sphere of psychology, introspection is the final and only court of appeal, that psychological evidence cannot be other than introspective evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Titchener (1906) ''A Textbook of Psychology'', p. 358&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unlike Wundt's method of introspection, Titchener had very strict guidelines for the reporting of an introspective analysis. The subject would be presented with an object, such as a pencil. The subject would then report the characteristics of that pencil (color, length, etc.). The subject would be instructed not to report the name of the object (pencil) because that did not describe the raw data of what the subject was experiencing. Titchener referred to this as stimulus error.

In his translation of Wundt's work, Titchener illustrates Wundt as a supporter of [[introspection]] as a method through which to observe consciousness. However, introspection only fits Wundt's theories if the term is taken to refer to psychophysical methods.

[[Introspection]] literally means 'looking within', to try to describe a person's memory, perceptions, cognitive processes, and/or motivations.&lt;ref name=Carlson&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil R.|title=Psychology the Science of Behaviour|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Canada Inc.|location=Canada|isbn=0-205-64524-0|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Elements of the mind===
Titchener's  theory began with the question of what each element of the mind is. He concluded from his research that there were three types of mental elements constituting conscious experience: [[Sensation (psychology)|Sensations]] (elements of perceptions), [[Image]]s (elements of ideas), and [[affections]] (elements of emotions).These elements could be broken down into their respective properties, which he determined were [[quality (philosophy)|quality]], [[wikt:intensity|intensity]], [[Time|duration]], [[wikt:clearness|clearness]], and extensity. Both sensations and images contained all of these qualities; however, affections were lacking in both clearness and extensity. And images and affections could be broken down further into just clusters of sensations. Therefore, by following this train of thinking all thoughts were images, which being constructed from elementary sensations meant that all complex reasoning and thought could eventually be broken down into just the sensations which he could get at through [[introspection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Sternberg |editor1-first=Robert |editor2-last=Smith |editor2-first=Edward |year=1988 |title=The Psychology of Human Thought |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DZ44AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=titcheners+three+types+of+mental+elements&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TAbnl01ALg&amp;sig=Ufxm30OGVYWdTggRbB3P-jOaiLs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2kmBUsn2M7TNsQSq7oHQDw&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=titcheners%20three%20types%20of%20mental%20elements&amp;f=false |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=3–4 |isbn=0 521 32229 4 |accessdate=November 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interaction of elements===
The second issue in Titchener's theory of structuralism was the question of how the mental elements combined and interacted with each other to form conscious experience. His conclusions were largely based on ideas of [[associationism]]. In particular, Titchener focuses on the [[Contiguity (psychology)|law of contiguity]], which is the idea that the thought of something will tend to cause thoughts of things that are usually experienced along with it.

Titchener rejected Wundt's notions of [[apperception]] and creative synthesis ([[Voluntary action|voluntary actio]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;n), which were the basis of Wundt's voluntarism. Titchener argued that [[attention]] was simply a manifestation of the "clearness" property within sensation.

===Physical and mental relationship===
Once Titchener identified the elements of [[mind]] and their interaction, his theory then asked the question of why the elements interact in the way they do. In particular, Titchener was interested in the relationship between the conscious experience and the physical processes. Titchener believed that physiological processes provide a continuous substratum that give psychological processes a continuity they otherwise would not have. Therefore, the nervous system does not cause conscious experience, but can be used to explain some characteristics of mental events..

==Wundt and structuralism&lt;!--'Voluntarism (psychology)' and 'Psychological voluntarism' redirect here--&gt;==
[[Wilhelm Wundt]] instructed Titchener, the founder of structuralism, at the [[University of Leipzig]]. The 'science of immediate experience' was stated by him. This simply means that the complex perceptions can be raised through basic sensory information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson&amp;Heth|first=Neil R &amp; C. Donald|title=Psychology the science of behaviour|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Canada Inc.|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=978-0-205-64524-4|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wundt is often associated in past literature with structuralism and the use of similar introspective methods.  Wundt makes a clear distinction between pure introspection, which is the relatively unstructured self-observation used by earlier philosophers, and experimental introspection. Wundt believes this type of [[introspection]] to be acceptable since it uses laboratory instruments to vary conditions and make results of internal perceptions more precise.

The reason for this confusion lies in the translation of Wundt's writings. When Titchener brought his theory to [[United States|America]], he also brought with him Wundt's work. Titchener translated these works for the American audience, and in so doing misinterpreted Wundt's meaning. He then used this translation to show that Wundt supported Titchener's own theories. In fact, Wundt's main theory was that of '''psychological voluntarism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (''psychologische Voluntarismus''), the doctrine that the power of the will organizes the mind’s content into higher-level thought processes.&lt;ref name="GdP"&gt;Wilhelm Max Wundt (1897), [http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Wundt/Outlines/sec2.htm ''Outlines of Psychology''] ([https://archive.org/details/GrundrissDerPsychologie Grundriss der Psychologie]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.bethel.edu/~johluc/history-resource/WundtTheory.html "Wundt's Psychological Model"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

Structuralism has faced a large amount of criticism, particularly from the school of psychology, [[Functional psychology|functionalism]] which later evolved into the psychology of [[pragmatism]] (reconvening introspection into acceptable practices of observation).  The main critique of structuralism was its focus on introspection as the method by which to gain an understanding of conscious experience. Critics argue that self-analysis was not feasible, since introspective students cannot appreciate the processes or mechanisms of their own mental processes. [[Introspection]], therefore, yielded different results depending on who was using it and what they were seeking. Some critics also pointed out that introspective techniques actually resulted in retrospection – the memory of a sensation rather than the sensation itself.

[[Behaviorists]], specifically methodological behaviorists, fully rejected even the idea of the conscious experience as a worthy topic in psychology, since they believed that the subject matter of scientific psychology should be strictly [[Operationalization|operationalized]] in an objective and measurable way. Because the notion of a mind could not be objectively measured, it was not worth further inquiry. However, [[radical behaviorism]] includes thinking, feeling, and private events in its theory and analysis of psychology. Structuralism also believes that the mind could be dissected into its individual parts, which then formed conscious experience. This also received criticism from the [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt school of psychology]], which argues that the mind cannot be broken down into individual elements.

Besides theoretical attacks, structuralism was criticized for excluding and ignoring important developments happening outside of structuralism. For instance, structuralism did not concern itself with the study of [[ethology|animal behavior]], and [[Personality psychology|personality]].

Titchener himself was criticized for not using his psychology to help answer practical problems. Instead, Titchener was interested in seeking pure knowledge that to him was more important than commonplace issues.

==Alternatives==

One alternative theory to structuralism, to which Titchener took offense, was functionalism (functional psychology). Functionalism was developed by [[William James]] in contrast to structuralism. It stressed the importance of empirical, rational thought over an experimental, trial-and-error philosophy.&lt;ref name=Func&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/222123/functionalism&lt;/ref&gt; James in his theory included introspection (i.e., the psychologist's study of his own states of mind), but also included things like analysis (i.e., the logical criticism of precursor and contemporary views of the mind), experiment (e.g., in hypnosis or neurology), and comparison (i.e., the use of statistical means to distinguish norms from anomalies) which gave it somewhat of an edge.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20131225170022/https://www.boundless.com/psychology/introduction-to-psychology/history-of-psychology/early-frameworks-structuralism-and-functionalism/&lt;/ref&gt; Functionalism also differed in that it focused on the how useful certain processes were in the brain to the environment you were in and not the processes and other detail like in structuralism.&lt;ref name=Func /&gt;

==Contemporary structuralism==
Researchers are still working to offer objective experimental approaches to measuring conscious experience, in particular within the field of [[cognitive psychology]] and is in some ways carrying on the torch of Titchener's ideas. It is working on the same type of issues such as sensations and perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciences360.com/index.php/structuralism-psychology-cognitive-psychology-7202/&lt;/ref&gt; Today, any introspective methodologies are done under highly controlled situations and are understood to be subjective and retrospective. Proponents argue that psychology can still gain useful information from using introspection in this case.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; as key concept for higher order singular value decomposition of functions. It transforms a function (which can be given via [[Closed-form expression|closed formulas]] or [[neural network]]s, [[fuzzy logic]], etc.) into TP function form if such a transformation is possible. If an exact transformation is not possible, then the method determines a TP function that is an approximation of the given function. Hence, the TP model transformation can provide a trade-off between approximation accuracy and complexity.&lt;ref name=ykc01&gt;{{cite journal

A free [[MATLAB]] implementation of the TP model transformation can be downloaded at [https://nas.mistems.hu:5001/sharing/6IIIPxmtf] or an old version of the toolbox is aviable at  [[MATLAB]] Central [http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25514-tp-tool].  A key underpinning of the transformation is the [[higher-order singular value decomposition]].&lt;ref name=Lath00 /&gt;

Besides being a transformation of functions, the TP model transformation is also a new concept in qLPV based control which plays a central role in the providing a valuable means of bridging between identification and polytopic systems theories. The TP model transformation is uniquely effective in manipulating the convex hull of polytopic forms, and, as a result has revealed and proved the fact that convex hull manipulation is a necessary and crucial step in achieving optimal solutions and decreasing conservativeness&lt;ref&gt;A.Szollosi, and Baranyi, P. (2016). Influence of the Tensor Product model representation of qLPV models on the feasibility of Linear Matrix Inequality. Asian Journal of Control, 18(4), 1328-1342&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Szöllősi and P. Baranyi: „Improved control performance of the 3‐DoF aeroelastic wing section: a TP model based 2D parametric control performance optimization.” in Asian Journal of Control, 19(2), 450-466. / 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="springer.com"/&gt; in modern LMI based control theory. Thus, although it is a transformation in a mathematical sense, it has established a conceptually new direction in control theory and has laid the ground for further new approaches towards optimality. Further details on the control theoretical aspects of the TP model transformation can be found here: [[TP model transformation in control theory]].

The TP model transformation motivated the definition of the "HOSVD canonical form of TP functions",&lt;ref name=canon1&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; on which further information can be found [[HOSVD based canonical form of TP functions and qLPV models|here]]. It has been proved that the TP model transformation is capable of numerically reconstructing this [[HOSVD]] based canonical form.&lt;ref name=canon3 /&gt; Thus, the TP model transformation can be viewed as a numerical method to compute the [[HOSVD]] of functions, which provides exact results if the given function has a TP function structure and approximative results otherwise.

The TP model transformation has recently been extended in order to derive various types of convex TP functions and to manipulate them.&lt;ref name="P. Baranyi 2014, pp. 934-948"/&gt; This feature has led to new optimization approaches in qLPV system analysis and design, as described here: [[TP model transformation in control theory]].

;Finite element TP function: A given function &lt;math&gt;f({\mathbf{x}})&lt;/math&gt;, where  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}\in R^N&lt;/math&gt;, is a TP function if it has the structure:

:: &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x})=\sum_{i_1=1}^{I_1} \sum_{i_2=1}^{I_2} \ldots \sum_{i_N=1}^{I_N} \prod_{n=1}^N w_{n,i_n}(x_n) s_{i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_N},&lt;/math&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ):

:: &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x})=\mathcal{S}\mathop{\otimes}_{n=1}^N\mathbf{w}_n(x_n),&lt;/math&gt;

where core tensor  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}\in \mathcal{R}^{I_1\times I_2\times \ldots \times I_N}&lt;/math&gt; is constructed from &lt;math&gt;s_{i_1 i_2 \ldots i_N}&lt;/math&gt;, and row vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}_n(x_n), (n=1 \ldots N)&lt;/math&gt; contains continuous univariate weighting functions &lt;math&gt;w_{n,i_n}(x_n),(i_n=1 \ldots I_n)&lt;/math&gt;. The function &lt;math&gt;w_{n,i_n}(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;i_n&lt;/math&gt;-th weighting function defined on the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th dimension, and &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-the element of vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;. Finite element means that &lt;math&gt; I_n &lt;/math&gt; is bounded for all &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt;. For qLPV modelling and control applications a higher structure of TP functions are referred to as TP model.

;Finite element TP model (TP model in short): This is a higher structure of TP function:

:: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(\mathbf{x})=\mathcal{S}\boxtimes_{n=1}^N\mathbf{w}_n(x_n).&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Y}=\mathcal{F}({\mathbf{x}})&lt;/math&gt; is a tensor as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Y}\in \mathcal{R}^{L_1\times L_2\times \ldots L_O}&lt;/math&gt;, thus the size of the core tensor is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}\in \mathcal{R}^{I_1\times I_2\times \ldots \times I_N \times L_1\times L_2\times ... \times L_O}&lt;/math&gt;. The product operator &lt;math&gt; \boxtimes &lt;/math&gt; has the same role as &lt;math&gt; \otimes &lt;/math&gt;, but expresses the fact that the tensor product is applied on the &lt;math&gt; L_1\times L_2\times ... \times L_O&lt;/math&gt; sized tensor elements of the core tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;. Vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} &lt;/math&gt; is an element of the closed hypercube &lt;math&gt;\Omega=[a_1,b_1]\times[a_2,b_2]\times ... \times[a_N,b_N]\subset R^N&lt;/math&gt;.

;Finite element convex TP function or model: A TP function or model is convex if the wighting functions hold:

:: &lt;math&gt; \forall n : \sum_{i_n=1}^{I_n} w_{n,i_n}(x_n) = 1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_{n,i_n}(x_n) \in [0,1] .&lt;/math&gt;

This means that &lt;math&gt; f(\mathbf{x}) &lt;/math&gt; is inside the convex hull defined by the core tensor for all &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x} \in \Omega &lt;/math&gt;.

;TP model transformation: Assume a given TP model &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Y} = \mathcal{F}(\mathbf{x}) &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}\in \Omega \subset R^N&lt;/math&gt;, whose TP structure maybe unknown (e.g. it is given by neural networks). The TP model transformation determines its TP structure as

:: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(\mathbf{x})=\mathcal{S}\boxtimes_{n=1}^N\mathbf{w}_n(x_n) &lt;/math&gt;,

namely it generates the core tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S} &lt;/math&gt; and the weighting functions &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{w}_n(x_n) &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; n=1 \ldots N &lt;/math&gt;. Its free [[MATLAB]] implementation is downloadable at [https://web.archive.org/web/20120229061018/http://tptool.sztaki.hu/] or at  [[MATLAB]] Central [http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25514-tp-tool].

If the given &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; does not have TP structure (i.e. it is not in the class of TP models), then the TP model transformation determines its approximation:&lt;ref name=ykc01 /&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(\mathbf{x}) \approx \mathcal{S}\boxtimes_{n=1}^N\mathbf{w}_n(x_n),&lt;/math&gt;

where trade-off is offered by the TP model transformation between complexity (number of components in the core tensor or the number of weighting functions) and the approximation accuracy. The TP model can be generated according to various constrains. Typical TP models generated by the TP model transformation are:
* HOSVD canonical form of TP functions or TP model (qLPV models), 
* Various kinds of TP type polytopic form or convex TP model forms (this advantage is used in qLPV system analysis and design).

==Properties of the TP model transformation==
* It is a non-heuristic and tractable numerical method firstly proposed in control theory.&lt;ref name=Baranyi04 /&gt;&lt;ref name=compind /&gt; 
* It transforms the given function into finite element TP structure. If this structure does not exist, then the transformation gives an approximation under a constraint on the number of elements.
* It can be executed uniformly (irrespective of whether the model is given in the form of analytical equations resulting from physical considerations, or as an outcome of soft computing based identification techniques (such as neural networks or fuzzy logic based methods, or as a result of a black-box identification), without analytical interaction, within a reasonable amount of time. Thus, the transformation replaces the analytical and in many cases complex and not obvious conversions to numerical, tractable, straightforward operations. 
* It generates the HOSVD-based canonical form of TP functions,&lt;ref name=canon1 /&gt; which is a unique representation. It was proven by Szeidl &lt;ref name=canon3&gt;{{cite journal
|author1=L. Szeidl  |author2=P. Várlaki
 |lastauthoramp=yes |title =        HOSVD Based Canonical Form for Polytopic Models of Dynamic Systems
|journal =      Journal of Advanced Computational Intelligence and Intelligent Informatics
|year =         2009
|volume =       13
|number =       1
|pages =        52–60
}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the TP model transformation numerically reconstructs the [[HOSVD]] of functions. This form extracts the unique structure of a given TP function in the same sense as the [[HOSVD]] does for tensors and matrices, in a way such that:
:* the number of weighting functions are minimized per dimensions (hence the size of the core tensor);
:* the weighting functions are one variable functions of the parameter vector in an orthonormed system for each parameter (singular functions);
:* the sub tensors of the core tensor are also in orthogonal positions;
:* the core tensor and the weighting functions are ordered according to the higher-order singular values of the parameter vector;
:* it has a unique form (except for some special cases such as there are equal singular values);
:* introduces and defines the rank of the TP function by the dimensions of the parameter vector;

* The above point can be extended to TP models (qLPV models to determine the [[HOSVD]] based canonical form of qLPV model to order the main component of the qLPV model). Since the core tensor is &lt;math &gt; N+O &lt;/math&gt; dimensional, but the weighting functions are determined only for dimensions &lt;math &gt; n=1 \ldots N &lt;/math&gt;, namely the core tensor is constructed from &lt;math &gt; O &lt;/math&gt; dimensional elements, therefore the resulting TP form is not unique.
*The core step of the TP model transformation was extended to generate different types of convex TP functions or TP models (TP type polytopic qLPV models), in order to focus on the systematic (numerical and automatic) modification of the convex hull instead of developing new LMI equations for feasible controller design (this is the widely adopted approach). It is worth noting that both the TP model transformation and the LMI-based control design methods are numerically executable one after the other, and this makes the resolution of a wide class of problems possible in a straightforward and tractable, numerical way.
* The TP model transformation is capable of performing trade-off between complexity and accuracy of TP functions &lt;ref name=ykc01 /&gt; via discarding the higher-order singular values, in the same manner as the tensor HOSVD is used for complexity reduction.

The '''Faculty of Political Sciences''' ({{lang-sr| Факултет политичких наука Универзитета у Београду / Fakultet političkih nauka Univerziteta u Beogradu}}, abbreviated FPN) is a constituent institution of the [[University of Belgrade]] which focuses on education and research in the fields of political science, international relations, journalism and communication studies, and social policy and social work. It was established in 1968, as a first faculty of this type in former Yugoslavia.

The building, built in the [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] style, is located in the urban neighborhood of [[Voždovac]], close to the Faculty of Organizational Sciences. The Faculty of Political Sciences offers [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]], [[Master of Arts|MA]] and [[PhD]] programmes, as well as advanced professional development programmes.

==History==

The Faculty of Political Sciences was established in 1968, after the National Assembly of Serbia brought an establishment act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.bg.ac.rs/files/sr/univerzitet/glasnik-zakoni/zbornik/knjiga3/3_119.pdf |title=ZAKON O FAKULTETU POLITIČKIH NAUKA U BEOGRADU |language=Serbian |date=1968-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first institution of its kind in [[former Yugoslavia]]. Since its founding to 2013, it has educated more than 8,100 students, with 975 of them having completed [[Master of Arts|MA]] programmes, and 464 having defended their [[PhD]] theses.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.fpn.bg.ac.rs/en/the-faculty/about-us/ |title=About Us |publisher=Faculty of Political Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the [[alumni]] have become recognized experts and scholars, professors and high ranking government officials.

Many of the faculties of political sciences, established subsequently in other parts of the [[former Yugoslavia]] were formed from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Political Sciences as a core, and a large number of professors at the various faculties of political sciences in all the countries of the [[former Yugoslavia]], had obtained their academic titles at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Political Sciences.

Celebration of the faculty's 40th anniversary was held in the hall of the [[National Assembly of Serbia]] in November 2008. It was sponsored by the President of Serbia. An international conference "State and Democracy" was held as a part of anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.rts.rs/page/stories/sr/story/125/Dru%C5%A1tvo/29858/Jubilej++FPN-a.html |title=Jubilej FPN-a |publisher=Radio Television of Serbia |date=2008-11-27 |language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic staff==

The [[University of Belgrade]] Faculty of Political Sciences has among its academic staff some of the most eminent experts in the field of political sciences, as well as in a range of others ([[economy]], [[sociology]], [[philosophy]], [[law]], [[history]], etc.)  Amongst them, there are many widely recognized within the domestic and international academic community, as well as former or current high government officials – Ministers, Ambassadors, etc.

Notable members of the academic staff include:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.fpn.bg.ac.rs/en/teachers-and-staff |title=Teachers and Staff |publisher=Faculty of Political Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Dragan Veselinov]], [[Government of Serbia (2001-2004)|Minister of Agriculture]] (2001-2003)
*[[Ivo Visković]], [[Embassy of Serbia in Berlin|Ambassador of Serbia to Germany]] (2009-2013)
*[[Slobodan Samardžić]], [[Cabinet of Serbia (2007–2008)|Minister for Kosovo-Metohija]] (2007-2008)
*[[Čedomir Čupić]], Chairman of the Board of The Anti-Corruption Agency of the Republic of Serbia (2009-2011)
*[[Tanja Miščević]], [[Chief Negotiator]] for [[Serbia’s accession negotiations with the EU]], former [[State secretary]] of the [[Cabinet of Serbia (2008–2012)|Ministry of Defence]] of the Republic of Serbia (2008-2012)

==Student life==
Student life at the Faculty includes a diverse array of student activities. Student organisations at the Faculty of Political Sciences include a [[Debate Club]], European Students Forum, Youth Team Initiative [http://timfpn.weebly.com TIM], Serbian Political Forum [http://spf.fpn.bg.ac.rs SPF], United Nations Club, Diplomatic Forum, Action for Political Emancipation of Youth [https://web.archive.org/web/20110806005218/http://apem.org.rs/ APEM] and many others. Students also elect their representatives (Student Vice-Dean and the [[Students' Union|Student Parliament]]) to represent their interests in the Faculty bodies, participate in the evaluation of studies and the faculty, and secure the involvement and participation of students in all matters and issues of interest to them.

Students periodically publish their own newspaper – ''Politikolog'' (The Political Scientist), and take part in various competitions through their sports club. Also, students of [[journalism]] prepare radio and TV shows which are broadcast on radios and televisions with national frequencies.

==Professional gatherings==
Students have the opportunity to participate in numerous events and gatherings (national and international). Student Conference at [[Kopaonik]] which is held every year provides them with the chance to discuss the most recent developments in both domestic and international politics with prominent experts, professors and diplomats. Study trips that are organized every year include visits to Serbia's diplomatic missions across Europe, [[European Parliament]], [[European Court of Human Rights]], [[United Nations]], [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] and many other institutions. Also, a regional gathering of political sciences students called "Politijada" is being held every year with students from [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Republic of Macedonia]] and [[Slovenia]] taking part.

The '''W.A. Gayle Planetarium''' is operated by [[Troy University]] for the city of [[Montgomery, Alabama]]. It provides public presentations and exhibits on [[astronomy]], [[planetary science]], and [[space exploration]]. 

== Overview ==
The W.A. Gayle Planetarium is a [[planetarium]] located in Oak Park in the city of [[Montgomery, Alabama]]. Dedicated on September 25, 1968,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wsfa.com|title=Editorial: The Planetarium Dedication|last=|first=|date=September 26, 1968|work=WSFA-TV|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the planetarium is named after [[W. A. Gayle|William Armistead Gayle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.montgomerybotanicalgardens.com/about/|title=ABOUT {{!}} Montgomery Botanical Gardens|work=Montgomery Botanical Gardens|access-date=2017-10-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; mayor of Montgomery from 1952 to 1959. It is currently operated by Troy University for the City of Montgomery.

Daily public shows typically offer visitors a full-dome movie about a current topic in astronomy and planetary science.

The '''Wendy Schmidt Oil Cleanup X CHALLENGE''' was a challenge [[award]] offered by the [[X PRIZE Foundation]] for efficient capturing of [[crude oil]] from [[ocean water]]. Inspired by the ongoing [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|''Deepwater Horizon'' oil spill]] disaster,&lt;ref name="xprize"/&gt; the award was announced on July 29, 2010, and the official one-year competition began on August 1, 2010.&lt;ref name="xprize"/&gt; The first three teams were to be awarded [[US$]]1 million, US$300,000 and US$100,000 respectively.

Of the over 350 teams that preregistered to participate in the challenge by January 2011, 37 officially registered the following month.  By the time of the official testing in May 2011, the field of challengers had been narrowed to ten teams.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iprizecleanoceans.org/blog/2011/10/11/and-winners-are&lt;/ref&gt;

The winners for the challenge were announced on October 11, 2011.  The first-place finisher and winner of the $1 million prize was the team of Elastec/American Marine using a design similar to a [[Tesla turbine]]. The second-place finisher and winner of $300,000 was the team NOFI.  No other team met all of the challenge's goals, so the planned third place prize was not awarded.

The US$1.4 million prize purse was offered by Wendy Schmidt from [[The Schmidt Family Foundation]].&lt;ref name="xprize"/&gt;

In [[mathematics]], '''Łukasiewicz logic''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|l|uː|k|ə|ˈ|ʃ|ɛ|v|ɪ|tʃ}}; {{IPA-pl|wukaˈɕɛvʲitʂ|lang}}) is a [[non-classical logic|non-classical]], [[many-valued logic]]. It was originally defined in the early 20th century by [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] as a [[three-valued logic]];&lt;ref name="Luk1920"&gt;Łukasiewicz J., 1920, O logice trójwartościowej (in Polish). Ruch filozoficzny '''5''':170–171. English translation: On three-valued logic, in L. Borkowski (ed.), ''Selected works by Jan Łukasiewicz'', North–Holland, Amsterdam, 1970, pp. 87–88. {{isbn|0-7204-2252-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was later generalized to ''n''-valued (for all finite ''n'') as well as [[infinite-valued logic|infinitely-many-valued]] (ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-valued) variants, both propositional and first-order.&lt;ref name="Hay1963"&gt;Hay, L.S., 1963, Axiomatization of the infinite-valued predicate calculus. ''Journal of Symbolic Logic'' '''28''':77–86.&lt;/ref&gt; The ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-valued version was published in 1930 by Łukasiewicz and [[Alfred Tarski]]; consequently it is sometimes called the '''Łukasiewicz-Tarski logic'''.&lt;ref name="Ciungu2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lavinia Corina Ciungu|title=Non-commutative Multiple-Valued Logic Algebras|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-01589-7|page=vii}} citing Łukasiewicz, J., Tarski, A.: [http://chc60.fgcu.edu/images/articles/lukasiewicztarski.pdf Untersuchungen über den Aussagenkalkül]. Comp. Rend. Soc.
Sci. et Lettres Varsovie Cl. III 23, 30–50 (1930).&lt;/ref&gt; It belongs to the classes of [[t-norm fuzzy logics]]&lt;ref name="Hájek1998"&gt;Hájek P., 1998, ''Metamathematics of Fuzzy Logic''. Dordrecht: Kluwer.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[substructural logic]]s.&lt;ref name="Ono2003"&gt;Ono, H., 2003, "Substructural logics and residuated lattices — an introduction". In F.V. Hendricks, J. Malinowski (eds.): Trends in Logic: 50 Years of Studia Logica, ''Trends in Logic'' '''20''': 177–212.&lt;/ref&gt;

This article presents the Łukasiewicz[-Tarski] logic in its full generality, i.e. as an infinite-valued logic. For an elementary introduction to the three-valued instantiation Ł&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, see [[three-valued logic]].

== Language ==
The propositional connectives of Łukasiewicz logic are
''implication'' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;,
''negation'' &lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt;,
''equivalence'' &lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;,
''weak conjunction'' &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt;,
''[[strong conjunction]]'' &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;,
''weak disjunction'' &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt;,
''[[strong disjunction]]'' &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;,
and propositional constants &lt;math&gt;\overline{0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{1}&lt;/math&gt;.
The presence of conjunction and disjunction is a common feature of substructural logics without the rule of contraction, to which Łukasiewicz logic belongs.

== Axioms ==
{{expand section|additional axioms for finite-valued logics|date=August 2014}}
The original system of axioms for propositional infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic used implication and negation as the primitive connectives:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
                                          A &amp;\rightarrow (B \rightarrow A) \\
                          (A \rightarrow B) &amp;\rightarrow ((B \rightarrow C) \rightarrow (A \rightarrow C)) \\
          ((A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow B) &amp;\rightarrow ((B \rightarrow A) \rightarrow A) \\
                (\neg B \rightarrow \neg A) &amp;\rightarrow (A \rightarrow B).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Propositional infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic can also be axiomatized by adding the following axioms to the axiomatic system of [[monoidal t-norm logic]]:
; Divisibility: &lt;math&gt;(A \wedge B) \rightarrow (A \otimes (A \rightarrow B))&lt;/math&gt;
; Double negation: &lt;math&gt;\neg\neg A \rightarrow A.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic arises by adding the axiom of double negation to basic t-norm logic [[BL (logic)|BL]], or by adding the axiom of divisibility to the logic IMTL.

Finite-valued Łukasiewicz logics require additional axioms.

== Real-valued semantics ==
Infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic is a [[infinite-valued logic|real-valued logic]] in which sentences from [[sentential calculus]] may be assigned a [[truth value]] of not only zero or one but also any [[real number]] in between (e.g. 0.25). Valuations have a [[recursion|recursive]] definition where:
* &lt;math&gt;w(\theta \circ \phi) = F_\circ(w(\theta), w(\phi))&lt;/math&gt; for a binary connective &lt;math&gt;\circ,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;w(\neg\theta) = F_\neg(w(\theta)),&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;w\left(\overline{0}\right) = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w\left(\overline{1}\right) = 1,&lt;/math&gt;

and where the definitions of the operations hold as follows:
* '''Implication:''' &lt;math&gt;F_\rightarrow(x,y) = \min\{1, 1 - x + y\}&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Equivalence:''' &lt;math&gt;F_\leftrightarrow(x, y) = 1 - |x - y|&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Negation:''' &lt;math&gt;F_\neg(x) = 1 - x&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Weak Conjunction:''' &lt;math&gt;F_\wedge(x, y) = \min\{x, y\}&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Weak Disjunction:''' &lt;math&gt;F_\vee(x, y) = \max\{x, y\}&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Strong Conjunction:''' &lt;math&gt;F_\otimes(x, y) = \max\{0, x + y - 1\}&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Strong Disjunction:''' &lt;math&gt;F_\oplus(x, y) = \min\{1, x + y\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The truth function &lt;math&gt;F_\otimes&lt;/math&gt; of strong conjunction is the Łukasiewicz [[t-norm]] and the truth function &lt;math&gt;F_\oplus&lt;/math&gt; of strong disjunction is its dual [[t-norm#T-conorms|t-conorm]]. The truth function &lt;math&gt;F_\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; is the [[t-norm#Residuum|residuum]] of the Łukasiewicz t-norm. All truth functions of the basic connectives are continuous.

By definition, a formula is a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] of infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic if it evaluates to 1 under any valuation of [[propositional variable]]s by real numbers in the interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1].

== Finite-valued and countable-valued semantics ==
Using exactly the same valuation formulas as for real-valued semantics Łukasiewicz (1922) also defined (up to isomorphism) semantics over  
* any [[finite-valued logic|finite set]] of cardinality ''n'' ≥ 2 by choosing the domain as {{nowrap|{ 0, 1/(''n'' − 1), 2/(''n'' − 1), ..., 1 }}}
* any [[countable set]] by choosing the domain as { ''p''/''q'' | 0 ≤ ''p'' ≤ ''q'' where ''p'' is a non-negative integer and ''q'' is a positive integer }.

== General algebraic semantics ==
The standard real-valued semantics determined by the Łukasiewicz t-norm is not the only possible semantics of Łukasiewicz logic. General [[algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|algebraic semantics]] of propositional infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic is formed by the class of all [[MV-algebra]]s. The standard real-valued semantics is a special MV-algebra, called the ''standard MV-algebra''.

Like other [[t-norm fuzzy logics]], propositional infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic enjoys completeness with respect to the class of all algebras for which the logic is sound (that is, MV-algebras) as well as with respect to only linear ones. This is expressed by the general, linear, and standard completeness theorems:&lt;ref name="Hájek1998"/&gt;
:The following conditions are equivalent:
:* &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is provable in propositional infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic
:* &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is valid in all MV-algebras (''general completeness'')
:* &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is valid in all [[total order|linearly ordered]] MV-algebras (''linear completeness'')
:* &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is valid in the standard MV-algebra (''standard completeness'').

Font, Rodriguez and Torrens introduced in 1984 the Wajsberg algebra as an alternative model for the infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic.&lt;ref&gt;http://journal.univagora.ro/download/pdf/28.pdf citing J. M. Font, A. J. Rodriguez, A. Torrens, Wajsberg Algebras, Stochastica, VIII, 1, 5-31, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1940s attempt by [[Grigore Moisil]] to provide algebraic semantics for the ''n''-valued Łukasiewicz logic by means of his [[Łukasiewicz–Moisil algebra|Łukasiewicz–Moisil (LM) algebra]] (which Moisil called ''Łukasiewicz algebras'') turned out to be an incorrect [[model (mathematical logic)|model]] for ''n'' ≥ 5. This issue was made public by Alan Rose in 1956.  [[C. C. Chang]]'s MV-algebra, which is a model for the ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-valued (infinitely-many-valued) Łukasiewicz-Tarski logic, was published in 1958. For the axiomatically more complicated (finite) ''n''-valued Łukasiewicz logics, suitable algebras were published in 1977 by Revaz Grigolia and called MV&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras.&lt;ref name="Ciungu2013bis"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lavinia Corina Ciungu|title=Non-commutative Multiple-Valued Logic Algebras|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-01589-7|pages=vii-viii}} citing Grigolia, R.S.: "Algebraic analysis of Lukasiewicz-Tarski’s n-valued logical systems". In: Wójcicki, R., Malinkowski, G. (eds.) Selected Papers on Lukasiewicz Sentential Calculi, pp. 81–92. Polish Academy of Sciences, Wroclav (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; MV&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras are a subclass of LM&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras, and the inclusion is strict for ''n'' ≥ 5.&lt;ref&gt;Iorgulescu, A.: Connections between MV&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras and ''n''-valued Łukasiewicz–Moisil algebras—I. Discrete Math. 181, 155–177 (1998) {{doi|10.1016/S0012-365X(97)00052-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 Roberto Cignoli published some additional constraints that added to LM&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras produce proper models for ''n''-valued Łukasiewicz logic; Cignoli called his discovery ''proper Łukasiewicz algebras''.&lt;ref&gt;R.
