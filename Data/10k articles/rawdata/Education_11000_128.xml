It's not by rushing to the center. It's not by trying to win spending all of our energy winning over those who have other opinions.

Ocasio-Cortez also drew a great deal of media attention when she and [[Bernie Sanders]] campaigned for [[James Thompson (Kansas politician)|James Thompson]] in Kansas in July 2018.

In ''[[The New Yorker]]'' Benjamin Wallace-Wells wrote that while Sanders remains "the de-facto leader of an increasingly popular left, [he is unable to] do things that do not come naturally to him, like supply hope." Wallace-Wells suggested that Ocasio-Cortez has made Sanders's task easier as he can point to her success to show that ideas "once considered to be radical are now part of the mainstream".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wallace-Wells|first1=Benjamin|title=Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in Kansas|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/bernie-sanders-and-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-in-kansas|website=The New Yorker|accessdate=July 30, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726005141/https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/bernie-sanders-and-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-in-kansas |archive-date=July 26, 2018 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environment ===
Ocasio-Cortez is a self-described hardliner on environmental issues, calling climate change the "single biggest national security threat" facing the United States. She advocates for the United States to transition by 2035 to an electrical grid running on 100% [[renewable energy|renewable-energy]] production and end the use of [[fossil fuel]]s. She also calls for a [[Green New Deal]] in the United States, in which the federal government would invest in the construction of large-scale [[Green infrastructure|green-infrastructure projects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/1316082/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-green-new-deal-could-make-the-us-a-climate-change-leader/|title=Ocasio-Cortez's climate plan is the only one that matches scientific consensus on the environment|last=Schlanger|first=Zoë|work=Quartz |access-date=July 3, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180701230521/https://qz.com/1316082/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-green-new-deal-could-make-the-us-a-climate-change-leader/ |archive-date=July 1, 2018 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ocasio-Cortez has proposed "a select committee in the House to draft a plan that fits the proposal’s standards". Outlined in a draft resolution on her website, the proposal would mean "using nothing but renewable energy for electricity generation" and transitioning to renewable sources of energy "within 10 years of passing Green New Deal legislation", but does not provide details about how the US would move away from non-renewable power sources. It would also roll out a nationwide “smart” electrical grid and "mass energy-efficient building upgrades". Twelve Democrats in the new Congress have supported this resolution: Representatives [[Jared Huffman]], [[Ro Khanna]], [[John Lewis (civil rights leader)|John Lewis]], [[Carolyn Maloney]], [[José E. Serrano|Jose Serrano]], [[Earl Blumenauer]], [[Deb Haaland]], [[Joe Neguse]], [[Ayanna Pressley]] and [[Rashida Tlaib]].

The '''Azerbaijan Voluntary Military Patriotism Technical Sport Society''', or '''VMPTSTS''' for short, are [[military]] institutes established in major cities in [[Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://en.trend.az/news/azerbaijan/1513443.html|title= Azerbaijani President awards employees of voluntary military-patriotic sports-technical society with Tereggi medal|date=July 28, 2009|publisher="[[Trend News Agency]]"
|accessdate=July 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institutes teach essential combat techniques, including how to be sniper and a parachutist. 

==Sniper course==
The school offers a 45-day-long course that teaches [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijanis]] over the age of 15 essential combat techniques, including how to be snipers. It is Azerbaijan’s only non-profit school for snipers and the only organization outside of the [[Azerbaijani Armed Forces|military]] that provides such training.&lt;ref name="EurasiaNet"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.eurasianet.org/node/63468|title=Azerbaijan: Teaching the ABCs of How to Be a Sniper|date=March 11, 2011|publisher=EurasiaNet|accessdate=March 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants (divided equally between males and females) are drilled in both the theory and practice of sniper shooting. Aside from [[first aid]] and how to load and fire, students dig into such topics as “The Basics of [[Hand-to-Hand Combat]],” military topography, intelligence gathering and international laws on the use of [[sniper rifle]]s.&lt;ref name="News.Az"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.news.az/articles/society/33811|title=Azerbaijani snipers 'never fire' at civilians|date=April 5, 2011|publisher=News.Az|accessdate=April 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EurasiaNetApril"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.eurasianet.org/node/63241|title=Azerbaijan's Young Amateur Snipers
|date=April 6, 2011|publisher=EurasiaNet|accessdate=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Walid Gardashov, which is organizing the lessons, the school serves to "develop feelings of bravery and courage in young people, which will turn a teenager into a bold, fearless soldier in the future."&lt;ref name="Hürriyet Daily News and Economic Review"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=azerbaijan-launches-sniper-lessons-for-youth-2011-04-07|title=Azerbaijan launches sniper lessons for youth|date=April 7, 2011|publisher="[[Hürriyet Daily News and Economic Review]]"|accessdate=April 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The courses is free public school students, while older participants pay 50 [[Azerbaijani manat|manats]] ($63) for the course.&lt;ref name="EurasiaNet"/&gt;

The '''Baltic University Programme''' (BUP) is a network of about 225 universities and other institutes of higher education in the [[Baltic Sea]] region. It is coordinated by the Baltic University Programme Secretariat, a part of the Uppsala Centre for Sustainable Development at [[Uppsala University]], [[Sweden]].

The participating universities are located within or partly within the Baltic Sea drainage basin, including [[Belarus]], [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Germany]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], and [[Sweden]]. Countries near the basin are also represented - [[Czech Republic]], [[Norway]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Ukraine]].

The Programme, established in 1991, creates and coordinates undergraduate and master level courses at its participating institutions and sponsors joint research projects focusing on [[sustainable development]] in the region. It is governed by an international board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lvBzV9yMm-cC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=Baltic+University+Programme+1991&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JqSD5V7-4s&amp;sig=HztzBjdfHygZx32cNEy50KntdJs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result|title=Prospects of Integration and Development of R &amp; D and the Innovation Potential of Black Sea Economic Co-operation Countries|author=Walter Leal Filho|year=2002|publisher=IOS Press | isbn=978-1-58603-263-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beschermd erfgoed''' is the official term to describe [[Flanders|Flemish]] [[National Heritage Site]]s listed by law&lt;ref&gt; [http://onroerenderfgoed.ruimte-erfgoed.be/Default.aspx?tabid=14612&amp;language=nl De volledige wetgeving omtrent het onroerend erfgoed]&lt;/ref&gt; to protect and spread awareness of Belgian [[cultural heritage]], specifically in Flanders. The term is also used nationwide to refer to [[National Heritage Site (Belgium)|national heritage sites]]. Because Belgium is officially a tri-lingual country, the other nationwide terms used in the rest of the country are the French term '''Bien classé''' and the German term '''Kulturdenkmal'''.

Various websites with public information are maintained, and various initiatives are undertaken to assist protected property owners and to increase public awareness, most notably the [[European Heritage Days]], which are called ''Open Monumentendagen'' in Dutch, ''Journées du patrimoine'' in French, and ''Tag des offenen Denkmals'' in German, depending on the language of the locale.

In Flanders, the government agencies "Ruimte en Erfgoed" and "Vlaams Instituut voor het Onroerend Erfgoed (VIOE)" joined together in 2011 to form [[Flemish organization for Immovable Heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruimte-erfgoed.be/ Website of Ruimte en Erfgoed]&lt;/ref&gt; They work as agencies of the [[Flemish Ministry of Spatial Planning, Housing Policy and Heritage sites]] (Dutch: ''Ministerie van Ruimtelijke Ordening, Woonbeleid en Onroerend Erfgoed (RWO)'') from four locations in [[Antwerp]], [[Leuven]], [[Hasselt]] and [[Ghent]]. They maintain the administration of the Royal Commission for Monuments and Sites (Dutch: ''Koninklijke Commissie voor Monumenten en Landschappen (KCML)'').

'''''Bonsai Barber''''' is a [[video game]] developed by [[Zoonami]] for [[Wii]]. It was released in North America on March 30, 2009, in Europe on August 7, 2009 and in Japan on April 6, 2010.

==Overview==

The game places players in the role of a [[barber]] who must groom and style the foliage of their plant, fruit and vegetable customers in similar manner to the art of [[bonsai]] pruning. Using the [[Wii Remote]], the player uses tools such as scissors, hair clippers, combs and hairspray to work on the requests of up to five customers per day and try to achieve a professional five star rated cut for each.

The game also features unlockable modes and rewards as well as an achievement system, and players will be able to send photos of their stylings to friends via [[WiiConnect24]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wii.ign.com/articles/967/967075p1.html IGN First Look: Bonsai Barber]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Three prototypes of the game were developed on and off by a team of two people before the game moved into full development. In total, development for ''Bonsai Barber'' stretched over a period of two and a quarter years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4107/from_me_to_wii_martin_hollis_.php?page=4 From Me to Wii: Martin Hollis' Journey]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[IGN]] commended the tight, responsive controls and the quirky nature of the game, but also called it a pricey one trick pony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wii.ign.com/articles/968/968200p1.html IGN review]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]'' loved the concept and the humor and called it "an enjoyable, idiosyncratic experience".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/article.php?id=10501 ONM review]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Capper–Ketcham Act''' (enacted on May 22, 1928), sponsored by Sen. [[Arthur Capper]] (R) of [[Kansas]] and Rep. [[John C. Ketcham]] (R) of [[Michigan]], built on Senator Capper's background running "[[Capper Club]]s" to teach boys and girls about [[agriculture]].  The legislation officially recognized and provided matching funds to States to create "[[4-H]]" clubs for demonstration work to enable counties to hire youth and home agents.  It also granted federal money to agricultural extension network and the work of [[agricultural college]]s.  The "[[Future Farmers of America]]" (FFA) was founded through the Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://documents.law.yale.edu/capper-ketcham-act |title= Capper-Ketcham Act |publisher= Yale Law School |work= Lillian Goldman Law Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:To deposit or not to deposit, that is the question - journal.pbio.1001779.g001.png|thumb|The decision whether and how to share data often rests with researchers.]]
'''Data sharing''' is the practice of making data used for scholarly research available to other investigators. Replication has a long history in science.  The motto of The Royal Society is 'Nullius in verba', translated "Take no man's word for it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://royalsociety.org/about-us/history/ History of the Royal Society] webpage accessed June 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Many funding agencies, institutions, and publication venues have policies regarding data sharing because transparency and openness are considered by many to be part of the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/professor-stefan-elbe/a-global-health-epidemic-_b_14129608.html|title=A Global Health Epidemic Is A Ticking Time Bomb - But Virus Databases Can And Are Helping To Save Lives|website=HuffPost UK|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of funding agencies and science journals require authors of [[Peer review|peer-review]]ed papers to share any supplemental information (raw data, statistical methods or source code) necessary to understand, develop or [[Reproducibility|reproduce]] published research. A great deal of scientific research is not subject to data sharing requirements, and many of these policies have liberal exceptions. In the absence of any binding requirement, data sharing is at the discretion of the scientists themselves. In addition, in certain situations governments&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/7270183|title=A shot of transparency|date=2006-08-10|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-09-06|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt; and institutions prohibit or severely limit data sharing to protect proprietary interests, national security, and subject/patient/victim confidentiality. Data sharing may also be restricted to protect institutions and scientists from use of data for political purposes.

Data and methods may be requested from an author years after publication. In order to encourage data sharing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=How to encourage the right behaviour|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/416001b|journal=Nature|volume=416|issue=6876|pages=1–1|doi=10.1038/416001b}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prevent the loss or corruption of data, a number of funding agencies and journals established policies on [[Scientific data archiving|data archiving]]. Access to publicly archived data is a recent development in the [[history of science]] made possible by technological advances in communications and [[information technology]]. To take full advantage of modern rapid communication may require consensual agreement on the criteria underlying mutual recognition of respective contributions. Models recognized for improving the timely sharing of data for more effective response to emergent infectious disease threats include the data sharing mechanism introduced by the GISAID Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCauley|first=John W.|date=2017-02-23|title=Viruses: Model to accelerate epidemic responses|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/542414b|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=542|issue=7642|pages=414–414|doi=10.1038/542414b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ip-watch.org/2017/05/20/no-free-lunch-g20-health-ministers-find-first-meeting/|title=No Free Lunch, G20 Health Ministers Find At First Meeting|date=2017-05-20|website=Intellectual Property Watch|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite policies on data sharing and archiving, data withholding still happens. Authors may fail to archive data or they only archive a portion of the data. Failure to archive data alone is not data withholding. When a researcher requests additional information, an author sometimes refuses to provide it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Savage CJ, Vickers AJ | year = 2009 | title = Empirical Study of Data Sharing by Authors Publishing in PLoS Journals | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 9| page = e7078 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0007078 | pmid=19763261 | pmc=2739314}}&lt;/ref&gt; When authors withhold data like this, they run the risk of losing the trust of the science community.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://books.nap.edu/readingroom/books/obas/contents/publication.html Publication and Openness]," chapter from "On Being A Scientist: Responsible Conduct in Research", National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;

Data sharing may also indicate the sharing of personal information on a social media platform.

==U.S. government policies==

===Federal law===
On August 9, 2007, President Bush signed the [[America COMPETES Act]] (or the "America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science Act") requiring civilian federal agencies to provide guidelines, policy and procedures, to facilitate and optimize the open exchange of data and research between agencies, the public and policymakers. See Section 1009.&lt;ref name = "H.R. 2272"&gt;"[http://commdocs.house.gov/reports/110/h2272.pdf America COMPETES Act]&lt;/ref&gt;

===NIH data sharing policy===
{{Quote |‘The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Grants Policy Statement defines "data" as "recorded information, regardless of the form or medium on which it may be recorded, and includes writings, films, sound recordings, pictorial reproductions, drawings, designs, or other graphic representations, procedural manuals, forms, diagrams, work flow charts, equipment descriptions, data files, data processing or computer programs (software), statistical records, and other research data."’ | Council on Governmental Relations&lt;ref&gt;"[http://206.151.87.67/docs/CompleteDRBooklet.htm Access to and retention of research data]: Rights and responsibilities", p. 5. Council on Governmental Relations, March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The NIH Final Statement of Sharing of Research Data says:
{{Quote |‘NIH reaffirms its support for the concept of data sharing. We believe that data sharing is essential for expedited translation of research results into knowledge, products, and procedures to improve human health. The NIH endorses the sharing of final research data to serve these and other important scientific goals. The NIH expects and supports the timely release and sharing of final research data from NIH-supported studies for use by other researchers.

‘NIH recognizes that the investigators who collect the data have a legitimate interest in benefiting from their investment of time and effort. We have therefore revised our definition of "the timely release and sharing" to be no later than the acceptance for publication of the main findings from the final data set. NIH continues to expect that the initial investigators may benefit from first and continuing use but not from prolonged exclusive use.’ | ‘[http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-03-032.html Final NIH statement on sharing research data].’&lt;ref name = "Grants"&gt;"[http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/index.htm NIH Data Sharing Policy]."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===NSF Policy from Grant General Conditions===
{{Quote |'''36. Sharing of Findings, Data, and Other Research Products'''
''a. NSF …expects investigators to share with other researchers, at no more than incremental cost and within a reasonable time, the data, samples, physical collections and other supporting materials created or gathered in the course of the work. It also encourages awardees to share software and inventions or otherwise act to make the innovations they embody widely useful and usable.''

''b. Adjustments and, where essential, exceptions may be allowed to safeguard the rights of individuals and subjects, the validity of results, or the integrity of collections or to accommodate legitimate interests of investigators.'' | "[https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2001/gc101/gc101rev1.pdf National Science Foundation]: Grant General Conditions (GC-1)", April 1, 2001 (p. 17).}}

==Office of Research Integrity==
Allegations of misconduct in medical research carry severe consequences. The United States Department of Health and Human Services established an office to oversee investigations of allegations of misconduct, including data withholding. The website defines the mission:

{{Quote |"The Office of Research Integrity (ORI) promotes integrity in biomedical and behavioral research supported by the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) at about 4,000 institutions worldwide. ORI monitors institutional investigations of research misconduct and facilitates the responsible conduct of research (RCR) through educational, preventive, and regulatory activities." | [http://ori.dhhs.gov/ Office of Research Integrity].}}

==Ideals in data sharing==
Some research organizations feel particularly strongly about data sharing. Stanford University's [[WaveLab (mathematics software)|WaveLab]] has a philosophy about reproducible research and disclosing all algorithms and source code necessary to reproduce the research. In a paper titled "WaveLab and Reproducible Research," the authors describe some of the problems they encountered in trying to reproduce their own research after a period of time. In many cases, it was so difficult they gave up the effort. These experiences are what convinced them of the importance of disclosing source code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~wavelab/Wavelab_850/wavelab.pdf WaveLab and Reproducible Research] by Jonathan B. Buckheit and [[David Donoho|David L. Donoho]]&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy is described:
:''The idea is: An article about computational science in a scientific publication is not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the complete set of instructions which generated the figures.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~wavelab/ WaveLab850 website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rimmer|first=Matthew|date=2005-09-01|title=Japonica Rice: Intellectual Property, Scientific Publishing and Data‐sharing|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08109020500235180|journal=Prometheus|volume=23|issue=3|pages=325–347|doi=10.1080/08109020500235180|issn=0810-9028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Data Observation Network for Earth''' ([[DataONE]]) and Data Conservancy&lt;ref&gt;[https://dataconservancy.org]&lt;/ref&gt; are projects supported by the [[National Science Foundation]] to encourage and facilitate data sharing among research scientists and better support [[meta-analysis]]. In environmental sciences, the research community is recognizing that major scientific advances involving integration of knowledge in and across fields will require that researchers overcome not only the technological barriers to data sharing but also the historically entrenched institutional and sociological barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Reichman O.J. |author2=Jones M.B. |author3=Schildhauer M.P. | year = 2011 | title = Challenges and Opportunities of Open Data in Ecology | url = | journal = Science | volume = 331 | issue = 6018| pages = 703–705 | doi = 10.1126/science.1197962 | pmid=21311007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Richard J.

==Data sharing problems==

===Academic genetics===
Withholding of data has become so commonplace in academic genetics that researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital published a journal article on the subject. The study found that "Because they were denied access to data, 28% of geneticists reported that they had been unable to confirm published research."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.287.4.473 |vauthors=Campbell EG, Clarridge BR, Gokhale M |title=Data withholding in academic genetics: evidence from a national survey |journal=JAMA |volume=287 |issue=4 |pages=473–80 |year=2002 |pmid=11798369 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11798369|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic psychology===
In a 2006 study, it was observed that, of 141 authors of a publication from the American Psychology Association (APA) empirical articles, 103 (73%) did not respond with their data over a 6-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wicherts | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Borsboom | first2 = D. | last3 = Kats | first3 = J. | last4 = Molenaar | first4 = D. | title = The poor availability of psychological research data for reanalysis | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.61.7.726 | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 61 | issue = 7 | pages = 726–728 | year = 2006 | pmid =  17032082| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a follow up study published in 2015, it was found that 246 out of 394 contacted authors of papers in APA journals did not share their data upon request (62%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vanpaemel | first1 =W. | last2 = Vermorgen | first2 = M. | last3 = Deriemaecker | first3 = L. | last4 = Storms | first4 = G. | title = Are we wasting a good crisis?

===Academic archaeology===
A 2018 study reported on study of a random sample of 48 articles published during February–May 2017 in the ''[[Journal of Archaeological Science]]'' which found openly available raw data for 18 papers (53%), with compositional and dating data being the most frequently shared types. The same study also emailed authors of articles on experiments with stone artifacts that were published during 2009 and 2015 to request data relating to the publications. They contacted the authors of 23 articles and received 15 replies, resulting in a 70% response rate. They received five responses that included data files, giving an overall sharing rate of 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marwick|first1=Ben|last2=Birch|first2=Suzanne E. Pilaar|title=A Standard for the Scholarly Citation of Archaeological Data as an Incentive to Data Sharing|journal=Advances in Archaeological Practice|date=5 April 2018|volume=6|issue=02|pages=125–143|doi=10.1017/aap.2018.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientists in training===
A study of scientists in training indicated many had already experienced data withholding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00001888-200602000-00007 |vauthors=Vogeli C, Yucel R, Bendavid E |title=Data withholding and the next generation of scientists: results of a national survey |journal=Acad Med |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=128–36 |date=February 2006 |pmid=16436573 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1040-2446&amp;volume=81&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=128|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study has given rise to the fear the future generation of scientists will not abide by the established practices.

==Differing approaches in different fields==
Requirements for data sharing are more commonly imposed by institutions, funding agencies, and publication venues in the medical and biological sciences than in the physical sciences. Requirements vary widely regarding whether data must be shared at all, with whom the data must be shared, and who must bear the expense of data sharing.

Funding agencies such as the NIH and NSF tend to require greater sharing of data, but even these requirements tend to acknowledge the concerns of patient confidentiality, costs incurred in sharing data, and the legitimacy of the request. Private interests and public agencies with national security interests (defense and law enforcement) often discourage sharing of data and methods through non-disclosure agreements.

Data sharing poses specific challenges in [[participatory monitoring]] initiatives, for example where forest communities collect data on local social and environmental conditions. In this case, a rights-based approach to the development of data-sharing protocols can be based on principles of [[free, prior and informed consent]], and prioritise the protection of the rights of those who generated the data, and/or those potentially affected by data-sharing.&lt;ref&gt;D Sabogal. 2015.

'''Design Focused Evaluation''' (DFE) is an approach to the evaluation of educational quality. In this approach the evaluation specifically focuses on the effectiveness of the [[constructive alignment]] in the course (subject, paper, unit) design. It was developed for use in the higher education sector but has relevance in training environments also, and may be broadly applicable in any educational environment.

== History ==
DFE was developed by Calvin Smith, an educational researcher in Australia, to address the fact that most evaluation systems involve a focus on either inputs (the quality of the teaching, the quality of the resources, etc.) or outputs/outcomes (e.g. learning outcomes). Where both inputs and outcomes are included in an approach the items are separate (e.g. The Course Experience Questionnaire (Ramsden 1991) which has scales on inputs and a scale on generic skill development as outcomes).  There was at the time no approach that focused on the ''alignment'' of the learning activities and the learning objectives.

== Uses ==
DFE is primarily to be used to gather students' perceptions of the efficacy of the alignment (of teaching and learning activities with learning objectives) in the design of a course or unit of study (or part thereof). The reason for doing this is that it is considered a high-quality design practice that learning activities and learning objectives are aligned (Biggs and Tang 2007). Therefore, 'efficacy' here means 'the degree to which the teaching and learning activities ''supported the development of'' the learning outcomes'.

== Approach ==
DFE is a survey-based approach to gathering evaluative data, therefore it generates quantitative data. The approach relies heavily on the way items are written for the surveys used. There is a clear articulation of how items can be written for the DFE approach in Smith (2008). In short, each question is composed in two parts conjoined by a grammatical structure that does the work of '...helped me to learn...'. The first part of the question indexes the teaching and learning activity (e.g. 'the lab session on dissection...') and the second part indexes the learning objective ('...how to dissect the human torso.').

One sophistication in this process is that on both sides of the item structure there can be varying degrees of specificity-generality (or granularity). Compare the following three items all of which are stable on the right hand side, but vary on the left hand side:

* The whole 20-lecture series of lectures helped me to learn the rules of logic
* The three guest lectures helped me to learn the rules of logic
* The guest lecture by Dr Jeeves helped me to learn the rules of logic.

These items become increasingly granular, or more specific, moving from reference to all the lectures right down to a specific lecture session. The same issue of degrees of granularity/specificity can apply on the learning objective side of the item construction. Consider the following three items:

* the textbook helped me to learn the rules of logic
* the textbook helped me to learn argument structures and forms
* the textbook helped me to learn modus tollens.

Again, the degree of specificity increases with each step.

This ability means the DFE approach is extremely flexible and allows the course designer to target specific aspects of the course design. This allows a more strategic approach to evaluation design, and allows for the selective and high-leverage use of the limited 'real estate' in any survey instrument.

A further observation about the scope of each side of a DFE item is that, as well as being more or less generic or specific, it can make an "implicit" reference to the teaching and learning activities or the learning objectives (respectively). An example of this is when reference is made to 'the course' or 'learning'. Consider the following: 'the course helped me to learn'. In this case the reference to the course is an implicit reference to all of the teaching and learning activities the student experienced. Similarly, the reference to 'learning' in this case implies all of the learning objectives in the course. In one sense implicit references to either the learning objectives or the teaching and learning activities is the most generic level of reference, but a distinction is made in DFE between generic or general references to either TLAs or LOBs and implicit references.

With these three categories a cross-tabulation of the combinations of left-hand- and right-hand-side components of DFE items can be devised. This is useful in helping novice DFE survey designers develop items (Table 1).

Dharma Mittra was born on May 14, 1939, in [[Pirapora]], [[Minas Gerais]], [[Brazil]]. He started studying Yoga in 1958. In 1964, he left the [[Brazilian Air Force]] and moved to [[New York City]], to study under his new [[guru]], [[Sri Swami Kailashananda]]. After intensive study of [[Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga|Ashtanga]] and [[Karma Yoga]], he was accepted and initiated as a ''[[sannyasi]]'' (one who renounces the world in order to realize God). Dharma began teaching in 1967, after spending a decade as a full-time yogi and ''brahmachari'' (a celibate religious student who lives with his teacher and devotes himself to the practice of spiritual disciplines). A celebrated teacher at his guru's ''[[ashram]]'', he left in 1975 and founded the [http://www.dharmayogacenter.com Dharma Yoga Center] in [[New York City]]. He has been teaching daily since 1967, and is director of the Dharma Yoga Center in [[New York City]]."&lt;ref name="Yoga Journal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dharmayogacenter.com/dharma/life.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Dharma Mittra completed the ''Master Yoga Chart of 908 Postures'' in 1984, after having meticulously photographed himself in 1300 Yoga postures, then cut and pasted the pictures to create the work. The Master Yoga Chart is hung in many ''ashrams'' and Yoga centers worldwide, as a teaching tool and inspiration for all students of Yoga. His more recent book,  entitled ''Asanas: 608 Yoga Poses'' was published in 2003. In 2006, he released an instructional Yoga video series entitled ''Maha Sadhana: The Great Practice''. Mittra is also featured as the inspiration and model for [[Yoga Journal]]'s [[coffee table book]], entitled ''Yoga''.

The '''Education Program for Gifted Youth''' at Stanford University, was a loose collection of [[gifted education]] programs formerly located within Stanford Pre-Collegiate Studies at [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stanford EPGY - Education...|url=http://epgy.stanford.edu/|website=Stanford University|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The EPGY programs included distance and residential summer courses for [[student]]s of all ages.   Many of the courses were [[distance learning]], meaning that courses were taught remotely via the [[Internet]], rather than in the traditional [[classroom]] setting. Courses targeted students from elementary school up to advanced college graduate.  Subjects offered included: [[Mathematics]], [[English studies|English]], [[Humanities]], [[Physics]], and [[Computer Science]]. Stanford Pre-Collegiate Studies is similar to the [[Center for Talented Youth]] at the [[Johns Hopkins University]] in terms of certain objectives. The EPGY courses themselves were offered by a number of institutions including Stanford and Johns Hopkins.

In 2015, the EPGY was separated from Stanford University as its own entity known as GiftedandTalented.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/nicholas-tampio/the-end-of-epgyor-one-few_b_7637670.html|title=The End of EPGY--Or, One Fewer Common Core Escape Route|last=Tampio|first=Nicholas|date=2015-06-23|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 1, 2018, the service was discontinued.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.giftedandtalented.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000068246-Discontinuation-of-GiftedandTalented-com|title=Discontinuation of GiftedandTalented.com|website=GiftedandTalented.com Support|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

In the early 1960s, Stanford professors [[Patrick Suppes]] and [[Richard C. Atkinson]] began researching whether computers could be effectively used in schools to teach math and reading to children.  At the time, their area of research was known as ''computer-aided education''.  Atkinson eventually left to pursue a career as an administrator (he would retire as President of the [[University of California]]), but Suppes stayed.  Later Suppes extended his research to college-level material, and computer-based courses in Logic and Set Theory were offered to Stanford undergraduates from 1972 to 1992.

==History==

In 1985, Suppes received a "proof of concept" grant from the [[National Science Foundation]] to develop a computerized first-year [[calculus]] course with the initial objective of making it available to students in their last year of high school who were at schools that did not otherwise offer calculus.  Suppes, together with a team that included Raymond Ravaglia, the former Executive Director of EPGY, began work on the course in earnest in 1987.  When the course was ready for testing in 1990, the focus was turned to younger students who had been accelerated in their mathematics educations. For the summer of 1990, approximately 40 [[junior high]] and [[high school]] students with some knowledge of algebra were selected for a five-week instructor-taught accelerated precalculus course at [[Foothill College]].  Of those students, thirteen located at seven local schools were invited to take the computer-based calculus course during the subsequent school year, 1990-91.  All thirteen took the [[Advanced Placement]] AB Calculus examination in May 1991.  Six students scored 5, six scored 4, and one scored 3.

Following this initial success, computer-based courses in Beginning Algebra, Intermediate Algebra, and Precalculus were created to replace the accelerated summer course.  These courses were tested during the 1991–92 academic year with a new group of students.  At the same time, the calculus course was expanded to include the material necessary for the BC examination.  That year four students took the BC examination, with all scoring 5.

After porting the software to the Windows operating system, the Stanford Pre-Collegiate Studies, then known as the Education Program for Gifted Youth (EPGY), was formally launched at Stanford University in fall 1992, making these courses generally available.

In Fall 2000, the idea emerged of creating academic camps that would provide opportunities for enrichment that complement the opportunities for acceleration in the standard curriculum offered through online courses.  The following year, the Summer Institute in Math and Physics (SIMP) was launched with courses in the Theory of Relativity taught by Gary Oas and Real Analysis taught by Marc Sanders. Building on the success of this first year, it expanded to 170 students in the second year. In addition to courses in math and physics, courses in computer programming and writing (including creative writing taught by a recipient of Stanford's very competitive Wallace Stegner Fellowship for emerging writers) were added to the offerings of the program, which was renamed the Summer Institutes. Originally only for high school students, the Summer Institutes added a middle school program in 2005.

In April 2006, Stanford received a substantial and generous gift from the [http://www.malonefamilyfoundation.org/ Malone Family Foundation] of Englewood, Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.stanford.edu/news/2006/april19/ohs-041906.html Stanford Report&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="docstoc.com"&gt;http://www.docstoc.com/docs/4592601/Press-Release-The-EPGY-Online-High-School-at-Stanford Stanford Press Release&lt;/ref&gt; The donation went to forming an online high school independent of EPGY's regular distance learning courses. Its formal name is the [https://ohs.stanford.edu/ Stanford University Online High School], but is often referred to as Stanford OHS, or simply OHS.

In 2013, EPGY individualized online courses became offered through Redbird Advanced Learning.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = advanced learning developed by Stanford University|url = https://giftedandtalented.com/about-us|website = GiftedandTalented.com|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Redbird Advanced Learning, formerly EPGY, was acquired by [[McGraw-Hill Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = McGraw-Hill Education Acquires Redbird Advanced Learning, A Digital Personalized Learning Provider for K-12|url = https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mcgraw-hill-education-acquires-redbird-advanced-learning-a-digital-personalized-learning-provider-for-k-12-300337315.html|accessdate = 2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the EPGY known at the time as GiftedAndTalented.com was closed and the courseware was discontinued.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Stanford Pre-Collegiate Institutes==
The Stanford Pre-Collegiate Studies program currently hosts several residential summer programs for high school students ages 14–17, including the [http://summerinstitutes.stanford.edu/ Summer Institutes], the [http://summerhumanities.stanford.edu/ Summer Humanities Institute], the [https://sumac.stanford.edu/ Stanford University Mathematics Camp], the [http://smysp.stanford.edu/ Stanford Medical Youth Science] program, and the Summer Arts Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home &amp;433; Pre-Collegiate Summer Institutes|url=https://summerinstitutes.stanford.edu/|website=Stanford University|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Summer Institutes ===
Stanford Pre-Collegiate Studies Summer Institutes are three-week residential programs for academically talented and motivated high school students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=High School Program|url=https://summerinstitutes.stanford.edu/high-school|website=Stanford University|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Summer Institutes provide an opportunity for these students to enrich and accelerate their academic pursuits and to meet others who share their interests and abilities. Past Summer Institutes participants have come from over 80 countries and all 50 states.

Summer Institutes participants live in supervised Stanford housing and are taught by Stanford instructors. Students engage in intensive study in a single course, and they are introduced to topics not typically presented at the high-school level. The Summer Institutes provide a taste of college life in the beautiful surroundings of the Stanford campus.

Summer Institutes subject areas include mathematics, science, writing, humanities, computer science, engineering and business. The instructors are assisted by undergraduate and graduate student mentors who have expertise in the course subject areas. These mentors serve a dual role of Residential Counselor and Teaching Assistant so that the academic and social aspects of the program are tightly integrated.

=== Summer Humanities Institute ===
The Summer Humanities Institute is a three-week residential program for rising juniors and seniors interested in the humanities. Led by Stanford professors, the Summer Humanities Institute offers intensive courses in history, philosophy, and literature.

=== Summer Staff ===

The Summer Institute hires undergraduates, recent graduates, and graduate students to work during each summer as counselors and teaching assistants. Residential Counselors (RCs) are selected for their ability to work with young people in a residential setting, and for their academic qualifications. This arrangement allows for the social and academic portions of the program to be tightly integrated.

Education in [[Honduras]] is free to the public. The system begins in pre-school, continues in [[elementary school]] (1st-9th grade), [[secondary school]] (10th or 12th grade), then the [[university]] years (licentiate, master and doctorate). The public education in Honduras also coexist with private schools and universities.

==Elementary School==
'''Education in Honduras''' is free and compulsory for nine years.&lt;ref name=ilab&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/tda2001/honduras.htm "Honduras"]. ''2001 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor''. [[Bureau of International Labor Affairs]], [[U.S. Department of Labor]] (2002). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1999, the gross primary enrollment rate was 97.3 percent and the net primary enrollment rate was 85.7 percent.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; Among working children, an estimated 34 percent complete primary school.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; A lack of schools prevents many children in Honduras from receiving an education, as do costs such as enrollment fees, school uniforms, and transportation costs.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt;

Until the late 1960s, Honduras lacked a national education system. Before the reforms of 1957, education was the exclusive privilege of the upper class, who could afford to send their children to private institutions. It was only when the government of [[Ramón Villeda Morales]] (1957–63) introduced reforms that led to the establishment of a national public education system and began a school construction program, that education became accessible to the general population.&lt;ref name="Honduras - EDUCATION"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/honduras/58.htm |title=Honduras - EDUCATION |publisher=Countrystudies.us |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secondary School==
The secondary school is divided in two versace sections, common cycle, which are the first three years (7th-9th grade), and diversified cycle, commonly a bachelor's degree (10th-12th or 13th grade), accountant or technician careers.

==University==
The [[National Autonomous University of Honduras]] is the public university in [[Honduras]]. It has campuses in the most important cities of [[Honduras]].

==Contemporary education==
In 1998, [[Hurricane Mitch]] damaged more than 3,000 schools nationwide.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt;  The poor quality of education and the lack of vocational education are other education concerns.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt;

There was no proper educational system before the 1950s. The education reforms of the 1950s meant that by 1957, schools were no longer available to the wealthy, but costs are a problem to this day.&lt;ref name="Honduras - EDUCATION"/&gt;

'''Ethel Marguerite de Long Zande'''  (1879–1928) was an American [[educator]] from [[New Jersey]] who contributed to the [[settlement school]] movement of the early 20th century.

== Background ==
De Long was born in 1879 to George and Arabella M. de Long in [[Montclair, New Jersey]]. De Long's father and younger sister were semi-invalids, so de Long became a caregiver for her family at an early age. Her family moved with her to [[Northampton, Massachusetts]], when de Long started attending [[Smith College]] in 1897, so that she would still be able to care for them. While a student, de Long had to take out loans, work as a tutor, and teach at the Easthampton High School. After she graduated from Smith in 1901, she worked as a teacher at Central High in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]. In 1905, she moved to [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], where she taught English at the Manual Training High School for five years.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://pinemountainsettlement.net/?page_id=1696|title=Ethel de Long Zande|last=|first=|date=|work=Pine Mountain Settlement School Collections|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Progressives in the Kentucky Mountains: The Formative Years of the Pine Mountain Settlement School, 1913-1930|last=Greene|first=Samuel S.|publisher=Ohio State University|year=1982|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Settlement schools ==
De Long was invited by [[May Stone (educator)|May Stone]] and [[Katherine Pettit]] to become the principal of the Women's Christian Temperance Union Settlement School in [[Hindman, Kentucky]], later to become the [[Hindman Settlement School]]. In 1912, de Long joined Pettit in leaving Hindman to establish the [[Pine Mountain Settlement School]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Kentucky Encyclopedia|last=Kleber|first=John E.|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|year=1992|isbn=0813128838|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the division of labor determined by Pettit and de Long, de Long was responsible for the academic and industrial departments and supervised the fiscal and administrative work of the school.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Among her many contributions to the school, de Long assisted with the physical design of the school and was a skilled fundraiser. In 1913, de Long enlisted the help of the architect Mary Rockwell Hook to create a master plan for the new school. De Long's network of women she had met while at Smith College also proved a useful base for fundraising and for hiring workers for the school. She traveled all over the country, giving talks at schools and organizations to raise money for the school.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Personal life ==
In April 1918, de Long married Luigi Zande, an Italian [[Stonemasonry|stonemason]] who had been working at Pine Mountain. Zande built a cottage at the school for them to live in, which came to be known as the Zande House and is still in use at Pine Mountain.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Zandes had two children: Alberto, born in Louisville, Kentucky on March 19, 1919; and Elena, born on December 28, 1922, who was adopted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Later life ==
De Long died on March 18, 1928, of breast cancer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In her honor, the Montclair Pine Mountain Association placed a brass memorial plate in the transept of the Pine Mountain Chapel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Gail Horton Calmerton''' (November 2, 1861 – February 5, 1950) was an educator and a charter member of the National Council of Primary Education.

==Early life==
Gail Horton Calmerton was born on November 2, 1861, in Wisconsin, the daughter of E. Rudolph and M. Rougene Calmerton.&lt;ref name="Binheim"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Binheim|first1=Max|last2=Elvin|first2=Charles A|title=Women of the West; a series of biographical sketches of living eminent women in the eleven western states of the United States of America|date=1928|page=30|url=https://archive.org/details/womenofwestserie00binh|accessdate=8 August 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calmerton was a graduate of State [[Normal school]] in [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin]], and [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref name="Education" /&gt;

==Career==
Gail Calmerton was interested in all civic and educational matters.&lt;ref name="Binheim" /&gt; 

Calmerton was a former Supervisor of Primary Education in the Public Schools of [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], before moving to California.&lt;ref name="Binheim" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Addresses and Proceedings - National Education Association of the United States|date=1920|publisher=National Education Association of the United States|page=19|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=D9EtAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first primary supervisor was Annie Klingensmith, hired in 1899, a graduate of State Normal School in Indiana, PA, and Oswego Normal School in New York. Calmerton replaced Klingensmith in 1905, when Klingensmith resigned to accept a similar position in Paterson, New Jersey, and Calmerton served in that position until 1923.&lt;ref name="Education"&gt;{{cite book|title=Journal of the Midwest History of Education Society, Volumi 21-22|date=1994|publisher=University of Northern Iowa College of Education|page=129|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=OJoOAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Slocum|first1=&lt;Charles Elihu|last2=Robertson|first2=Robert Stoddard|title=History of the Maumee River Basin from the Earliest Account to Its Organization Into Counties, Volume 2|date=1905|publisher=Bowen &amp; Slocum|page=239|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=WNgyAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''History Teachers' Association of Victoria''' (HTAV) is a professional association representing and supporting teachers of [[history]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]]. The HTAV was founded by a group of teachers and was incorporated in [[Melbourne]] in 1980. {{as of|2013}}, has over 700 members and 11 members of staff.

== Publications ==

The association has two ongoing publications. ''The Bulletin'', a newsletter, published eight times a year, and ''Agora'', the quarterly journal. Both publications provide members with information relevant to the teaching of history.

== History ==

The History Teachers’ Association of Victoria was incorporated as a legal entity in November 1980. Like any historical development this date, at first glance, appears somewhat arbitrary. It neglects the longer pre-history of causation and origin and tells little about the nature of the organisation.

This prehistory was long, dating back to the 1950s and the foundation of the Victorian Historical Association. It was during this rather lengthy period of evolution between the 1950s and 1980 that the aims, character and activities that form the modern HTAV were defined. Even the most cursory of glances highlights the continuities of this history.

== The Bulletin and Agora ==

The aims of the Victorian Historical Association were articulated clearly in its first Bulletin, published in October 1959, when the association was at least eight years old. This document proclaimed that 'This association of school and university history teachers is concerned to provide history teachers with a forum in which they can discuss professional matters. To this end it holds a number of meetings throughout the school year, sponsors lectures, discussions, film nights and displays.'{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Agora, the association’s journal, first appeared nearly a decade later. As if dropping from some point in the future, perhaps the 1980s, maybe the 1990s or could it be last week, the opening sentence declared 'Whether we like it or not History as a subject in the schools appears to be under attack. But why?...' This 1967 statement certainly suggests continuity over time. In addition to the editorial which has been quoted, this first issue contained articles by Wes Blackmore, then the Senior History Master at Yarra Valley Church of England Grammar School, Professor N.D.Harper and Lloyd Evans. Agora underwent a number of change formats over the next forty odd years before it became the glossy quarterly we recognise today. Unsurprisingly given that its history traverses decades, editors also changed. Nonetheless, from the first issue Agora has remained a cornerstone of the service the association provides its members.

The publishing activities of the association expanded through the late 1960s. In 1967 it produced two regular publications, Historian and Agora. Two years later these were to be joined by a third, the Journal of History for Senior Students, which was to be edited by Don Gibb from its inception.

== 1960s &amp; 1970s ==

In 1968, attempts were made to establish regional groups, ten in total, but these seem to have been relatively unsuccessful. At that year’s AGM, a constitution for the association was adopted, formalising the VHA’s existence.

The 1970s, despite concerns about the threat to History in schools voiced in the late 1960s, feature continuing growth and expansion of the association’s activities although the decade appears to have culminated in crisis. Student 'seminars' in Australian history were held for the first time in the third (last) term of 1971 at Latrobe and Monash Universities, with approximately 1800 students attending. These figures are certainly a high-water mark although if the number of students attending VCE lectures in 2004 were totalled we{{Who|date=December 2012}} would appear to be continuing to grow, albeit at a significantly more modest rate.

In terms of membership, the association continued to grow throughout the decade. By 1972, AGM membership climbed to 673. In 1975, when the VHA moved to premises at 85 Howard St., [[North Melbourne, Victoria|North Melbourne]], which it shared with the Geography Teachers Association, membership had risen to 945, and was to reach 1144 by 1979.

Moves were made to set up a national association of History teachers, and the VHA was given the task of drawing up a draft constitution for the proposed body, which was to have been launched at Sydney University in May 1973. Ultimately, this national body was formed and exists today as the History Teachers’ Association of Australia. The VHA hosted the HTAA National Conference from 26–30 May 1978. This close association with the national body continued over subsequent decades with the HTAV hosting national conferences on a number of occasions, most recently in 2004.

While the 1970s membership figures and student lecture numbers suggest a thriving organisation, 1978–79 was described in the president’s Report as a 'challenging year' during which it 'survived financial crisis'. That period of crisis seems to have led to a desire to reform the organisation with a new name and identity – the History Teachers’ Association of Victoria. So through crisis and a lengthy incubation, in November 1980, the organisation now known as the HTAV was established with Bob Neal as its first president.

== 1980s ==

With a new identity as the HTAV, during the 1980s the association continued to evolve towards its current form. Perhaps the most enduring legacy was the 1986 acquisition of a permanent address for the organisation, 'The Bakery' at 402 Smith St, [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]]. This premise has remained the association’s home for nearly twenty years and would be barely recognisable by those who knew it then. Somewhat dishevelled, it was transformed in 2003 to include carpets, air-conditioning and retail outlets below.

From around the mid-1980s, with Tim Gurry in the role of the executive officer, the association expanded its repertoire of activities. While continuing to conduct professional development and publishing Agora the activities of the association expanded to the point that in the early 1990s, under the supervision of Bob Lewis, the publication of teaching resources and education kits constituted nearly half of the association’s income in any one year.

== 1990s ==

In the early 1990s the threat seemed to be coming from 'Australian Studies'; the HTAV mobilised to meet it by running conferences on how it could be used to increase the amount of History being taught. Most conferences during this period were held at the [[Collingwood Football Club]], of which the association was a member. The position of Extension Education Officer became a fully funded Departmental appointment advertised statewide, and Tim Gurry was appointed to the position for three years.

The mid-1990s were a difficult period. In 1992, Jonathan Tapp, an inspiring teacher from Trinity, was elected president, but early in his term of office he fell ill and died of cancer early the following year. Collingwood Football Club became a difficult venue once poker machines were installed, and after a long search a move was made to the [[Veneto Club]] in [[Bulleen, Victoria|Bulleen]]. In 1994 the association lost half of its funding for the EEO position, and had to make up the shortfall rather than have a half-time EEO. At the end of 1994 Tim Gurry resigned as Executive Director.

The loss of considerable state government funding during the early 1990s however meant that there was no longer the same level of government support for the association. The decline in education budgets also meant that levels of membership declined through the second half of the 1990s. This had rather significant implications for the financial viability of the association. This is perhaps nowhere more vividly illustrated than in the annual reports of the late 90s when the association experience a loss of over $60,000.

Despite the financial constraints of the 1990s, under the successive leaderships of John Cantwell and Jacqualine Hollingworth, the HTAV continued to provide for the needs of its membership and the wider History teaching community. As an organisation it represented teachers of History in the development of the [[Victorian Certificate of Education]], the [[Curriculum and Standards Framework]] (CSF) and it successor the CSFII and more recently AUSVELS. It also continued to support classroom teachers by publishing an array of resources, Agora and conducting professional development and student lectures.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

'''Ildaura Murillo-Rohde''' (September 6, 1920 &amp;ndash; September 5, 2010) was a Panamanian-American nurse, academic and organizational administrator. She specialized in psychiatric nursing, held academic appointments at several universities and was a psychotherapist in private practice. Murillo-Rohde founded the National Association of Hispanic Nurses in 1975. She was a [[World Health Organization]] consultant to the government of [[Guatemala]] and was named a Permanent UN Representative to UNICEF for the International Federation of Business and Professional Women. She was named a Living Legend of the [[American Academy of Nursing]] in 1994.

==Biography==
Ildaura Murillo-Rohde was born on September 6, 1920 in Panama. She came to the United States in 1945.&lt;ref name=Feldman/&gt; She completed a nursing diploma from the Medical and Surgical Hospital School of Nursing in 1948. She earned an undergraduate degree in the teaching and supervision of psychiatric nursing from [[Teachers College, Columbia University]]. She earned an MA in teaching and curriculum development and an MEd in education and administration, both from Columbia.&lt;ref name=Papers&gt;{{cite news|title=Biography|url=http://www.nursing.upenn.edu/history/Documents/finding%20aids/Murillo-Rohde%20Inventory.pdf|accessdate=July 28, 2013|newspaper=Ildaura Murillo-Rohde Papers|date=2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304043222/http://www.nursing.upenn.edu/history/Documents/finding%20aids/Murillo-Rohde%20Inventory.pdf|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, Murillo-Rohde was the first Hispanic nurse awarded a PhD from [[New York University]] (NYU).&lt;ref name=Feldman/&gt;

Murillo-Rohde was dedicated to the Hispanic population in her work as a psychiatric nurse and focused on cultural awareness in nursing practice. In her article Family Life Among Mainland Puerto Ricans in New York City Slums, she stressed that there could be a “culture within a culture” and that a nurse must know each culture well in order to provide the best care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murillo-Rohde|first1=Ildaura|title=Family Life Among Mainland Puerto Ricans in New York City Slums|journal=Perspectives in Psychiatric Care|date=12 October 1976|volume=14|issue=4|pages=174–179|doi=10.1111/j.1744-6163.1979.tb01545.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murillo-Rohde became an associate dean at the [[University of Washington]] and was the first Hispanic nursing dean at NYU. Murillo-Rohde founded the National Association of Spanish-Speaking Spanish-Surnamed Nurses (NASSSN), known as the [[National Association of Hispanic Nurses|National Association of Hispanic Nurses (NAHN)]] after 1979, and served as its first president.&lt;ref name=Feldman&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Feldman|editor-first=Harriet|title=Nursing Leadership: A Concise Encyclopedia|year=2012|publisher=[[Springer Publishing]]|isbn=0826121772|page=393|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vIfdwgZrbnAC&amp;pg=PA393&amp;lpg=PA393&amp;dq=ildaura+murillo-rohde&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yNZx1pBy9b&amp;sig=ohxo1H37RnEmNwGWlMr0rE61L1w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y-T1UciLLsz_4AP_yYC4DQ&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=ildaura%20murillo-rohde&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web|title=About NAHN|url=http://www.nahnnet.org/AboutNAHN.html|publisher=National Association of Hispanic Nurses|accessdate=July 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, [[David Dinkins]] appointed Murillo-Rohde to a commission that examined the quality of care at New York City hospitals.&lt;ref name=Panel&gt;{{cite news|title=Dinkins Selects Panel to Review City's Hospitals|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/09/nyregion/dinkins-selects-panel-to-review-city-s-hospitals.html|accessdate=July 28, 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 9, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, she was named a Living Legend of the [[American Academy of Nursing]].&lt;ref name=AAN&gt;{{cite web|title=Living Legends |url=http://www.aannet.org/living-legends-complete-list |publisher=[[American Academy of Nursing]] |accessdate=July 28, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412055058/http://www.aannet.org/living-legends-complete-list |archivedate=April 12, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moomin Museum''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: Muminmuseet, [[Finnish language|Finnish]]: Muumimuseo, formerly called Moominvalley) is situated in the city of [[Tampere]], [[Finland]]. Shown at the Moomin Museum are illustrations made by [[Tove Jansson]] (the creator of [[Moomin]]s), 40 miniatures, tableaux about Moomin events and a small (2.5&amp;nbsp;metres high) Moomin House. There is a total of about 2,000 exhibits on display. Also shown is the original Moomin Valley multimedia. It also has the Moomin Shop which sells gift items and Moomin Library which have Moomin books in many languages.

==History==
The blue five-storey miniature [[Moominhouse]] was built by [[Tuulikki Pietilä]], [[Pentti Eistola]] and Tove Jansson in the late 1970s. The original idea was to make it round, like Jansson always made it in her illustrations for the Moomin stories, but since it was going to be displayed in a corner at the [[Bratislava]] biennale of illustrations in 1979, they decided to make it square instead. No [[blueprint]]s were made, the house was built freely, floor by floor, and it does not follow any particular architectural style but is influenced by many different styles. The ground floor was sketched by Tuulikki Pietilä's brother, architect [[Reima Pietilä]].&lt;ref&gt;Mirja Kivi: Mumindalen, figurerna som kom på museum, 2000: Schildts Förlag Ab, page 84-85&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, a world tour was planned for the house after the 1979 biennale, but eventually it went on tour only in the [[Nordic countries]] in 1980–1983. Then it was taken to the atelier of Tove Jansson, since it needed some repairs after the tour. It was displayed again at the Art Museum of Tampere in 1986 and then got its permanent location at the new Moomin Museum, where it has been on display since 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Mirja Kivi: Mumindalen, figurerna som kom på museum, 2000: Schildts Förlag Ab, page 86-88&lt;/ref&gt; Photos of the Moomin House serve as illustrations in ''[[An Unwanted Guest]]'', the last of Jansson's four picture books about the Moomins.

Up until the end of 2012, the Moomin Museum situated in the basement of the Metso building of the city library. However, during December 2012, the museum moved into the Tampere Art Museum basement. During the move, a small collection of Tove Jansson's Moomin illustrations were on display in the [[Museum Center Vapriikki]]. The fully renewed and renovated Moomin Valley opened for visitors on January 2, 2013. The Moomin statue outside the Metso building will remain in place, to remind visitors of the Moomins' old home. In 2016, the museum moved into Tampere Hall and renamed to Moomin Museum. The Moomin statue was also moved to its new place. The museum opened in June 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7657">'''Operation Sudden Fall''' was a 2008 joint operation between the United States [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] and [[San Diego State University]] (SDSU) [[California State University Police Department|campus police]].  It was the largest campus drug bust in [[San Diego County]] history and one of the largest college drug busts in U.S. history.&lt;ref name="Newsweek1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=|title=Crime: Inside the San Diego State University Drug Bust|work=[[Newsweek]]|date=May 10, 2008|url=http://www.newsweek.com/crime-inside-san-diego-state-university-drug-bust-90047|accessdate=June 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The sting operation was triggered by the overdose deaths of two students at SDSU in 2007. 19-year Jenny Poliakoff died of a [[cocaine]] overdose on May 6, 2007, and another student, from [[San Diego Mesa College|Mesa College]], died of [[oxycodone]] overdose on February 26, 2008.&lt;ref name="3MonthsLater"&gt;{{cite news|last=Littlefield|first=Dana |author2=Jeff McDonald |author3=Sherry Saavedra|title=SDSU drug cases ending with little fanfare|publisher=''[[San Diego Union Tribune]]''|date=2008-08-17|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/education/20080817-9999-1m17sdsu.html|accessdate=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MedicalExaminerOfficial"&gt;{{cite news|last=Martinez|first=Angelica |author2=Debbi Farr Baker |author3=Karen Kucher |author4=Sherry Saavedra|title=Sting snares 96 on SDSU campus on drug charges |publisher=''[[San Diego Union Tribune]]''|date=2008-05-06|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20080506-1620-bn06sdsu3.html|accessdate=2008-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 6, 2008, San Diego State University Police in collaboration with the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] culminated a year-long investigation into drug abuse in the college area with a series of early morning raids at several residences in the college area. The DEA initially announced the arrests of 96 individuals, of whom 75 were San Diego State University students, (many of them interns at Adobe Systems Incorporated)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs8.com/misc/SDSU_mug_shots.pdf|title=Mug Shots from Operation Sudden Fall|publisher=CBS News 8|accessdate=2008-05-06 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080530031254/http://www.cbs8.com/misc/SDSU_mug_shots.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a variety of drug charges.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/05/06/sdsu.bust/index.html Drug bust nets 96 at San Diego State]", CNN.com, May 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; One day later, on May 7, SDSU officials stated that only 33 were students, and that the inflated numbers issued originally included all drug-related arrests made over the course of the year-long investigation, many of which were months before the raid and most cases for simple possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20080508-1041-bn08arrests.html|title=Officials differ on number of SDSU students snared in sting  |publisher=[[San Diego Union Tribune]]|accessdate=2008-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those arrested included students in the campus's Homeland Security and Criminal Justice programs. Additionally, the [[Lambda Chi Alpha]], [[Phi Kappa Theta]], [[Phi Kappa Psi]], [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]], [[Sigma Alpha Mu]] and [[Theta Chi]] fraternity chapters received interim suspensions, as each had at least one member arrested as result of the investigation. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://advancement.sdsu.edu/marcomm/information/|title=Six SDSU Fraternities Placed On Suspension as a Result of Drug-Related Arrests|publisher=SDSU|accessdate=2008-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Two [[kilograms]] of [[cocaine]] were seized, along with 350 [[Methylenedioxymethamphetamine|Ecstasy]] pills, 50 pounds of [[marijuana]], psychedelic mushrooms, hash oil, methamphetamine, illicit prescription drugs, other drug paraphernalia, three guns, and $60,000 in cash.&lt;ref&gt;[http://origin.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_9178843  origin.mercurynews.com,  Six fraternities suspended in drug probe at San Diego State]&lt;/ref&gt; That day, SDSU President Stephen Weber spoke at a [[news conference]], while authorities identified 22 SDSU students as drug dealers who sold to undercover agents, and 17 others that had supplied the drugs. The rest of the suspects apparently bought or possessed illegal drugs. Authorities further found that students from seven fraternities were involved in the drug ring, which operated openly across campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20080507-9999-1n7drugs.html  signonsandiego.com, 5 are students; DEA took part in yearlong operation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fox6.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=24791aa8-e8a8-4b9e-a987-87b3830d0f51&amp;rss=tick  www.fox6.com/news, Family of Dead SDSU Student Reacts to Campus Drug Bust]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Some student groups, including SDSU group "Students for Sensible Drug Policy," protested the arrests, especially SDSU's decision to involve the DEA, a federal agency, in the operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20080508-9999-1n8sdsu.html|title=SDSU drug sting draws scorn, praise |publisher=[[San Diego Union Tribune]]|accessdate=2008-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, they called for a more sympathetic policy toward drug use on the campus.&lt;ref name="Newsweek1"/&gt;

On May 15, SDSU Vice President for Student Affairs James Kitchen lifted the interim suspensions from the [[Phi Kappa Theta]], [[Sigma Alpha Mu]], and [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternities. The suspension was lifted after an administrative review found that those arrested in connection to the controlled substances investigation were either inactive members of the fraternity and/or were not presently residents of chapter houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://advancement.sdsu.edu/marcomm/information/|title=SDSU Lifts Interim Suspension on Three Fraternities|publisher=[[San Diego State University]]|accessdate=2008-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 22, SDSU announced that [[Phi Kappa Psi]] had been suspended for 18 months and [[Theta Chi]] had been suspended for four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-1m22frats145710-sdsu-punishes-2-fraternities-2008nov22-story.html|title=SDSU punishes 2 fraternities|publisher=[[San Diego State University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sentencing==
Several months after the May 6 announcement, it was reported that the majority of the defendants had pleaded guilty to the felony charges. The defendants were then either placed on probation or were required to enter drug diversion programs. Other defendants only received citations or had their cases dismissed.&lt;ref name="3MonthsLater"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6154">'''Oslo Waldorf School''' (Norwegian: ''Rudolf Steinerskolen i Oslo'') is a [[Waldorf school]] located in the [[Hovseter]] area in the [[Vestre Aker]] district of [[West End of Oslo|West End]] [[Oslo]], [[Norway]]. It is an integrated primary, middle and high school with around 550 pupils. Founded in 1926, it is one of the oldest Waldorf schools worldwide. It is generally regarded as one of the most prestigious schools in Norway and many of its alumni have been noted in the arts, politics and other areas of society. The school is an independent [[Foundation (nonprofit)|non-profit foundation]] governed by a board consisting of representatives of the teachers and parents, and it is a member of the Norwegian Association of Waldorf Schools.

==History==
[[File:Jens Bjørneboe underviser Rudolf Steinerskolen i Oslo 1952.jpg|thumb|Novelist [[Jens Bjørneboe]] teaching at Oslo Waldorf School in 1952]]
In November 1921, two years after the first Waldorf School was founded in [[Stuttgart]], Austrian philosopher [[Rudolf Steiner]] held two lectures on education at the [[Norwegian Nobel Institute]] in Oslo (then named Christiania), and the plan to establish a Waldorf school in Oslo was conceived. Among those involved was [[Bokken Lasson]], who also became one of the first teachers when the school was established in 1926. The school was originally located in Oscars gate in the [[Frogner]] district. As of 1932, the school had 102 pupils. Due to financial difficulties, the school had to close in 1936. Vult Simon and Gulle Brun however continued to operate a small Waldorf school in their home at [[Makrellbekken]]. In the autumn of 1945 the school was reestablished, and was located in a barracks in [[Frogner Park]]. In 1949, the school moved to [[Smestad, Oslo|Smestad]], and in 1962, it moved to Hovseter, where it is still located. Its building complex has been successively extended over the years in different architectural styles.

Prior to 1961, the school received no public funding, and was funded entirely by tuition and gifts as well as by idealistic teachers who worked for relatively little pay. The school became entitled to regular public funding under the Private School Act of 1970. Originally a primary school and later also a middle school, the first high school class was established in 1978.

The famous Norwegian novelist [[Jens Bjørneboe]] worked as a teacher at the school in the 1950s and a private school obviously modelled after Oslo Waldorf School has a significant role in his ''[[Jonas (novel)|Jonas]]'' novel, which is noted for its criticism of the public school system. He later published the book ''Under en mykere himmel; brev og bud fra en Steinerskole'' ("Under a softer sky; letters and messages from a Waldorf school") based on his work as a Waldorf teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Marstrander, ''Menneske først! Steinerpedagogikk i Oslo 1926-1996'', Oslo, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In Norway, [[anthroposophy]] in general and the Waldorf schools in particular have been strongly associated with the cultural and intellectual elite of the country since the early 20th century, and among the school's alumni and parents are many noted individuals, particularly within the arts and the cultural sphere, but also within politics and business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://morgenbladet.no/kultur/2008/hundre_ars_tosomhet?quicktabs_mest_lest_mest_kommentert=0 Hundre års tosomhet], [[Morgenbladet]], 19 Dec 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Among the school's alumni is former Labour leader, Prime Minister and now NATO Secretary-General [[Jens Stoltenberg]], and current Labour leader and former Foreign Minister [[Jonas Gahr Støre]] is a parent at the school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vg.no/nyheter/meninger/stoeres-verdivalg/a/520578/ Støres verdivalg], VG&lt;/ref&gt; The school and the Waldorf movement in general was a stronghold of the [[Riksmål]] language of the traditional elite during the [[Norwegian language struggle]], and the school is still using the now classic [[alphabet book]] ''André Bjerkes ABC'', published by [[Riksmålsforbundet]] in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Olav Østrem, [http://www.klassekampen.no/apps/pbcs.dll/article?avis=KK&amp;date=20090910&amp;category=ARTICLE&amp;lopenr=309109996&amp;Ref=AR&amp;profile=1007 På Bjørneboes skuldre], [[Klassekampen]], 10 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The arts play a major role in the school curriculum and the broader activities surrounding the school, and the school includes a professionally equipped theater hall.

Due to its long waiting lists, pupils are often enrolled shortly after birth.

==History==
In 2007, [[Sam Harris]] co-founded, alongside his wife, the (501(c)3) non-profit foundation called Project Reason. Harris is also chief executive of this organization. Its website describes itself in the following terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Project Reason is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit foundation devoted to spreading scientific knowledge and secular values in society. The project will draw on the talents of prominent and creative [[Intellectual|thinkers]] from a wide range of disciplines—[[science]], [[law]], [[literature]], [[entertainment]], [[information technology]], etc.—to encourage [[critical thinking]] and wise public policy. It will convene conferences, produce films, sponsor scientific research and opinion polls, award grants to other non-profit organizations, and offer material support to [[Dissident|religious dissidents]] and public intellectuals—with the purpose of eroding the influence of dogmatism, superstition and bigotry in the world.&lt;ref name=officialsite&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.project-reason.org/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306140031/http://www.project-reason.org/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-03-06 |title=Project Reason |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Projects==
The organization maintains several projects, as well as an internet forum, that attempt to debunk religion using empirical and rational critiques.

''The Scripture Project'', undertaken under the mantle of Project Reason, stated the following as its goal:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Steve Wells, creator of the Skeptics Annotated Bible, Qur'an, and Book of Mormon has generously donated the full contents of his website to Project Reason. Using this as a foundation, we intend to make the Scripture Project the best source for scriptural criticism on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20150418140718/http://www.project-reason.org/scripture_project&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Vatican Justice'', another project undertaken by Project Reason, has the following as its mission statement: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would like to announce that Project Reason has joined Hitchens and Dawkins (both of whom sit on our advisory board) in an effort to end the "diplomatic immunity" which the Vatican claims protects the Pope from any responsibility. We would greatly appreciate your support in this cause.  All donations are tax-deductible in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20150418141200/http://www.project-reason.org/vatican_justice&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The Secular Islam Sub-Project==

One of the most active sub-projects in Project Reason is the ''Secular Islam'' sub-project, with several initiatives falling under it.

One project within Secular Islam is titled "Modern Developments in Koranic Criticism: Christmas in the Koran" with the following description:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This project is being run by foundation advisor Ibn Warraq and takes as its focus the pioneering work in Syriac and Arabic linguistics of Christof Luxenberg. Luxenberg is a native Arab speaker and linguist, living in the West and writing under a pseudonym. Luxenberg's work has given new impetus to the discipline of Koranic studies, largely by revealing that many acknowledged obscurities in the Koran can be clarified by treating certain passages as a poor translations of Syriac into Arabic.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20150418132933/http://www.project-reason.org/secular_islam&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Secular Islam sub-project supports other projects, such as ''The Institute for Research on Early Islamic History and the Koran'', having funded their conferences in 2008, 2012, and 2014. It pledges collaboration with the Ayaan Hirsi Ali Foundation, supports the Ex-Muslims of North America, and the Quilliam Foundation.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;

[[Image:Ratiostudiorum.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Ratio Studiorum'', dated 1598, formally issued in 1599]]

The '''''Ratio atque Institutio Studiorum Societatis Iesu''''' (''The Official Plan for Jesuit Education''), often abbreviated as '''''Ratio Studiorum''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''Plan of Studies''), was a document that standardized the globally influential system of [[Jesuit]] education in 1599. It was a collection of regulations for school officials and teachers. The ''Ratio Studiorum'' relied on the classical subjects (theology, philosophy, Latin and Greek) and did not contain any provisions for elementary education. The document was revised in 1832, still built upon the classical subjects but giving more attention to the study of native languages of the students, history, geography, mathematics, and the natural sciences.

The work was the product of many hands and wide experience, but it most directly derives from the efforts of an international team of academics at the [[Collegio Romano]], the Jesuit school in [[Rome]]. The ''Ratio'' had a major impact on later humanist education. In his ''Renaissance Literary Theory and Practice,'' Charles Sears Baldwin writes, "The sixteenth century closed with the full [classical] doctrine operative in the Ratio Studiorum and in the rhetoric of [[Cypriano de Soarez|Soarez]]" (64).&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, Charles Sears. Renaissance Literary Theory and Practice. New York: Columbia UP, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Historical background==
The [[Society of Jesus]] had not originally envisaged running a network of schools when it was founded, but it soon became progressively involved in and then largely associated with educational work. One hundred years after the order's founding, the Jesuits were running 444 schools. By 1739, they were running 669 schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moss |first1=Jean Dietz |first2=William A. |last2=Wallace |title=Rhetoric &amp; Dialectic in the Time of Galileo |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lw50esHmgacC&amp;pg=PA118 |location= Washington, D.C. |publisher=Catholic UP |year=2003 |page=118 |isbn=9780813213316}}&lt;/ref&gt; The many schools taken over or started by the Society in its first decades all needed plans (''rationes''). In addition, an increasing number of young men were entering the Society in need of the educational background that was required for priestly service, and the Society began to assume a greater and greater role in the direction of its own formational program.  For these two reasons, there grew a great desire for a standard plan for all of the Society's educational institutions. 

Under the generalate of [[Claudio Aquaviva]], in 1581, a committee of twelve Jesuit priests was appointed without clear results.  A new committee of six was soon formed in 1584:  [[John Azor|Juan Azor]] ([[Spain]]), [[Gaspar González]] ([[Portugal]]), [[James Tyrie]] ([[Scotland]]), [[Peter Busée]] (the [[Netherlands]]), [[Anthony Ghuse]] ([[Flanders]]), and [[Stephen Tucci]] ([[Sicily]]).  This committee produced a trial document, the ''Ratio'' of 1586, which was sent to various provinces for comments from the teachers. This plan was not intended for actual use in the classrooms.  Reflection on the reactions led to the issuance of another document in 1591, which was to be employed in all Jesuit schools for three years. The reflection on these experiments was then used by the committee in Rome to create the final official document of 1599.

==Content==
The ''Ratio Studiorum'' was divided into the following sections:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12654a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia article on the Ratio Studiorum]&lt;/ref&gt;

I. Rules for the [[provincial superior]]; for the rector of the college; for the prefect of studies, who supervises classes and instruction, and the prefect of discipline, who maintains order and discipline; 

II. Rules for the professors of theology: [[Scripture]], [[Hebrew language]], [[dogmatic theology]], [[ecclesiastical history]], [[canon law]], and [[moral theology]]. [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] was the main author for theological texts. 

III. Rules for the professors of philosophy, physics, and mathematics. [[Aristotle]] was prescribed as the standard author.

IV. Rules for the teachers of the ''studia inferiora'' (the lower department): Latin and Greek, grammar and syntax, humanities and [[rhetoric]]. Other subjects were taught from the beginning under the name of "accessories"—especially history, geography, and antiquities.

'''Road Scholar''' is an American [[not-for-profit organization]] that provides [[Educational tourism|educational travel tours]] primarily geared to [[older adults]]. The organization is headquartered in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. From its founding in 1975 until 2010, Road Scholar was known as Elderhostel. Road Scholar offers study tours throughout the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] and in approximately 150 other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flinn|first1=John|title=Road Scholar: Former Elderhostel still about learning|url=http://www.sfgate.com/travel/article/Road-Scholar-Former-Elderhostel-still-about-3655907.php|accessdate=2 June 2014|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Elderhostel was founded in 1975 by friends [[Martin Knowlton|Marty Knowlton]], social activist and self-described [[hippie]], and [[David Bianco (educator)|David Bianco]], director of residential life at the [[University of New Hampshire]]. Knowlton rejected as [[ageism]] the belief that one's mind must fail as one ages. After four years of [[Backpacking (travel)|backpacking]] through Europe and staying in [[hostels]], Knowlton, then in his 50s, returned to the United States to direct the youth hostel program at the University of New Hampshire. There, he and Bianco, the university administrator, decided that society needed "elderhostels" in addition to youth hostels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nelson|first1=Valerie J.|title=Martin P. 'Marty' Knowlton dies at 88; co-founder of Elderhostel|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-marty-knowlton18-2009mar18-story.html|accessdate=2 June 2014|work=Los Angeles Times|date=18 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program started in the summer of 1975, offering older adults [[Academic audit|noncredit classes]] and [[dormitory]] housing on [[campus]]es in [[New England]]&lt;ref name="Travelers Wanted"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greene|first1=Kelly|title=Travelers Wanted|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970204563304574316862522747686|work=Wall Street Journal|date=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; — a sort of "[[summer school]] for retired people."&lt;ref name="San Francisco Chronicle"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flinn|first1=John|title=Road Scholar: Former Elderhostel still about learning|url=http://www.sfgate.com/travel/article/Road-Scholar-Former-Elderhostel-still-about-3655907.php#page-1|accessdate=2 June 2014|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elderhostel was officially established as a not-for-profit organization in 1977. Its program offerings expanded through the United States and Canada, and eventually internationally. By the 1990s, more than 200,000 people were learning with Elderhostel each year.&lt;ref name="Travelers Wanted"/&gt;

In 2010, Elderhostel changed its name to Road Scholar in order to appeal to the next wave of older travelers: [[Baby Boomers]]. [[CEO]] James Moses explained the name change to the [[San Francisco Chronicle]]: "Hostel" no longer accurately described the [[lodging]] offered on the programs and "Baby Boomers, even when they're in their 60s, don't like to think of themselves as 'elders,'" he said.&lt;ref name="San Francisco Chronicle"/&gt; For a few months during 2010, the company was called Exploritas before changing its name to Road Scholar.

==Educational programs==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2638">A '''self-voicing''' application is an application that provides an aural interface without requiring a separate [[screen reader]]. Self-voicing applications can be an important form of [[assistive technology]], useful to those who have difficulty reading or seeing.

A prominent group of self-voicing applications are talking web browsers. Traditionally, talking web browsers have been specially created, as was the case with:
* pwWebSpeak, originally developed by The Productivity Works in Princeton, New Jersey (now obsolete){{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
* Simply Web (also now obsolete){{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
* [[Home Page Reader|Home Page Reader (HPR)]] from IBM (recently discontinued){{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
* Connect Outloud from [[Freedom Scientific]]&lt;ref name="connect outloud"&gt;http://www.freedomsci.de/prod03.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[WebAnywhere]] from University of Washington&lt;ref name="Washington University"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://webanywhere.cs.washington.edu/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160523013006/http://webanywhere.cs.washington.edu/ |archivedate=2016-05-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent trend has seen the self-voicing capabilities added to mainstream web browsers with free add-ons. In 2004, [[Opera Software]] created a self-voicing and speech-recognition extension for the Windows version of their web browser.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opera.com/pressreleases/en/2004/03/23/ Opera Sings with IBM's Speech Technology: New version of Opera Embeds ViaVoice from IBM] (Opera press release, 23 March 2004). Accessed 2007-02-03.&lt;/ref&gt; And in 2005 Charles L. Chen devised [[Fire Vox]], an extension that adds speech capabilities to the [[Mozilla Firefox]] web browser on Mac, Windows, or Linux.&lt;ref&gt;Charles L. Chen, [http://www.firevox.clcworld.net/about.html About Fire Vox]. Accessed 2007-02-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second important category are broader self-voicing applications that function as what T. V. Raman calls "complete audio desktops",&lt;ref&gt;T. V. Raman, [http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/ Emacspeak - The Complete Audio Desktop]. Accessed 2007-02-03.&lt;/ref&gt; including editing, browsing, and even gaming capabilities. These include Raman's own [[Emacspeak]] enhancement for [[Emacs]] and Karl Dahlke's Edbrowse.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

'''''Strangers No More''''' is a 2010 short [[documentary film]] about a school in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]], where children from 48 different countries and diverse backgrounds come together to learn. The parents of these children are among over 300,000 transnational migrant workers who have arrived in Israel—some with government authorization and others undocumented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Willen|first=Sarah|title=Transnational Migration to Israel in Global Comparative Context|year=2007|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham, MD|url=http://www.rowmanlittlefield.com/Catalog/SingleBook.shtml?command=Search&amp;db=^DB/CATALOG.db&amp;eqSKUdata=0739110675&amp;thepassedurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Students rights sidebar}}
A '''students' union''', '''student government''', '''free student union''', '''student senate''', '''students' association''', '''guild of students''', or '''government of student body''' is a [[student]] [[organization]] present in many [[colleges]], [[universities]], and [[high school]]s. In [[higher education]], the students' union is often accorded its own building on the [[campus]], dedicated to [[social]], organizational activities, representation, and academic support of the membership.

In the United States, ''student union'' often only refers to a physical building owned by the university with the purpose of providing services for students without a governing body. This building is also referred to as a [[student activity center]], although the [[Association of College Unions International]] (largely US-based) has hundreds of campus organizational members. Outside the US, ''student union'' and ''students' union'' refer to a representative body, as distinct from a ''student activity centre''.

==Purpose==
Depending on the country, the purpose, assembly, method, and implementation of the group might vary. Universally, the purpose of students' union or student government is to represent fellow students in some fashion.

In some cases, students' unions are run by students, independent of the educational facility. The purpose of these organizations is to represent students both within the institution and externally, including on local and national issues. Students' unions are also responsible for providing a variety of services to students. Depending on the organization's makeup, students can get involved in the union by becoming active in a committee, by attending councils and general meetings, or by becoming an elected officer.

Some students' unions are politicized bodies, and often serve as a training ground for aspiring [[politician]]s. Students' unions generally have similar aims irrespective of the extent of politicization, usually focusing on providing students with facilities, support, and services.

Some students' unions often officially recognize and [[Asset allocation|allocate]] an annual [[budget]] to other organizations on campus. In some institutions, postgraduate students are within the general students' unions, whereas in others they have their own [[national postgraduate representative body|postgraduate representative body]]. In some cases, graduate students lack formal representation in student government.

[[File:Student Union - Oklahoma State University.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A students' union building at [[Oklahoma State University - Stillwater|Oklahoma State University]], which doubles as a [[student activity center]].]]

==Variations depending on country==
As mentioned before universally the purpose of students' union or student government is to represent fellow students. Many times student's unions usually focusing on providing students with facilities, support, and services. Simple variations on just the name include the name differences between the United States (student government) and other countries (student's union). Depending on the country there are different methods of representation [[compulsory education]] to [[Higher education]] or tertiary.

===Asia and Oceania===

====Australia====
{{Main article|Student unionism in Australia}}

In [[Australia]], all [[List of universities in Australia|universities]] have one or more student organizations.

Australian student unions typically provide such services as eateries, small retail outlets (e.g., news agencies), student media (e.g., campus newspapers), advocacy, and support for a variety of social, arts, political, recreational, special interest and sporting clubs and societies. Most also operate specialized support services for female, [[LGBT]], international and [[indigenous people|indigenous]] students. Many expressed concerns over the introduction of [[voluntary student unionism]] (VSU) in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Debate rages over voluntary student unionism|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2005-04-27/debate-rages-over-voluntary-student-unionism/1558892|accessdate=1 February 2017|publisher=ABC|date=27 Apr 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Government passed legislation to allow universities to charge students a compulsory service fee to fund amenities such as sporting facilities, childcare and counselling, as well as student media and "advocating students’ interests".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Student Services and Amenities Fee|url=https://www.education.gov.au/student-services-and-amenities-fee|website=Department of Education and Training|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation passed after the Greens took the balance of power in the senate.[11]

The [[National Union of Students of Australia]] represents most undergraduate students' unions at a national level; the [[Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations]] is the umbrella organisation for postgraduate students' unions.

====Azerbaijan====
Azerbaijan Students Union (ASU) was established by students from Baku on 15 September 2008. ASU is an organization which was established on basis of international experience and it was the first student organization which united students irrespective of gender, race, creed, nationality.

During its action period ASU has formed stable structure, presented new suggestions about student policy to appropriate bodies, made close relations with international and regional student organizations, prepared new action plan according to the universities-students-companies' relations in Azerbaijan.

ASU considered international relations very important. For the first time ASU's delegates were participants of the First Asia IAESTE Forum in Shanghai during 12–15 November 2009. After that forum ASU established close relations with IAESTE which is one of the biggest student exchange organizations. As a result of relations on 21 January 2010 ASU was accepted a member of IAESTE. Our union gained right to represent Azerbaijan students in IAESTE. That membership was the union's first success on international level. During 20–27 January Azerbaijan Students Union was accepted as associative member of IAESTE in 64th Annual Conference in Thailand. Azerbaijan Students Union used to be a full member of European Students' Union, but was thrown out in 2015.

====China====
In China, the student body is usually referred to as 学生会 ({{zh|p=Xuéshēng Hùi|l=student union}}) or 学生联合会 ({{zh|p=Xuéshēng Liánhé Hùi|l=student league}}).

Membership in different universities has different functions. Some universities may give the membership a task of recording the students' attendance and the complex grades. Student associations of Chinese universities are mostly under the leadership of [[Communist Youth League of China]], which to a large extent limit its function as an organization purely belonging to students themselves.
====Hong Kong====
All [[List of universities in Hong Kong|universities]] in Hong Kong have students' unions. Most of these students' unions are members of the [[Hong Kong Federation of Students]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hkfsu.org/about.html|title=About FSU 關於我們 - HKFSU 香港學生會總會 hkfsu.org|first=|last=HKFSU|website=hkfsu.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[secondary schools]] also have students' unions or the equivalent.

====India====
{{Main article|List of Indian student organisations}}

India has developed a complex tradition of student politics dating from the era of [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]] domination. Student unions are organised both within universities, like the Student Council of IISc and across universities, but affiliated with political parties, as in the case of [[Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad ]] (ABVP), [[Muslim Students Federation]] (MSF), [[Dr. Ambedkar Student Front of India ]] (DASFI), [[All India Students Federation ]] (AISF), [[Students Federation of India]] (SFI), [[National Students Union of India]] (NSUI) etc. who compete in elections to control posts in universities and colleges. Examples of activist unions include the [[Delhi University Students Union]]. Recently few school administrations had also started including the student government system as co-curricular activities in one form or another.

====Indonesia====
In [[Indonesia]], every university, college and higher education school has a student union. The student body in high school, which is called ''Organisasi Siswa Intra Sekolah'' (Student Organization Inside School), abbreviated ''OSIS'', is the official student organization formed by the government. A general election to choose the leader is usually held every year. OSIS organizes the school's extracurricular activities such as music shows and art gallery (''pentas seni/pensi'').

====Japan====
In Japan, the student body is called 学生自治会 (gakusei-jichi-kai). In Japanese, the word 学生自治会 (gakusei-jichi-kai) means students' self-government-organizations. The student body in Japan promotes [[extracurricular]] activities. Usually, a cultural association, 文化会 (bunka-kai), and a sports association, 体育会 (taiiku-kai), are included within a student body as autonomous organizations. A student belongs to one or more students' organizations, and he or she does extracurricular activities through these students' organizations. However, the extracurricular activities of universities and colleges have been declining since the 1990s.

====Malaysia====

[[Malaysia]] has 20 public universities. Each of them has one Students' Representative Council ({{lang-ms|Majlis Perwakilan Pelajar, MPP}}), the highest student body of such university.

A general election is held every year, usually in September, to elect representatives to MPP. The percentage of voter turn-outs are usually high (70 to 95 percent) largely due to enforcements from the universities' management which, at the same time, acts as the Election Committee.

Every year, the Malaysian [[Ministry of Higher Education (Malaysia)|Ministry of Higher Education]] would set meetings and arrange programmes with all MPPs. Nevertheless, each MPP has their own autonomous right to govern their own membership. The size of MPP differs from each university, from as little as 12 to as many as 50. All MPP members are part-time and unpaid officers.

In 2011, [[Universiti Sains Malaysia]] established Students' Consultative Assembly ({{lang-ms|Dewan Perundingan Pelajar, DPP}}), the first student parliament established and the oldest of its kind in Malaysia, to involve participation of more student leaders in decision and policy making as well as to establish a legislative branch in its Students' Union system instead of having the only executive branch. A university student parliament is composed of MPP members and other elected or appointed student leaders representing their respective student body. As at May 2016, 7 public universities in Malaysia had their student parliament established.

====New Zealand====
Students associations have a strong history in New Zealand of involvement in political causes, notably the [[Halt All Racist Tours]] campaign during the [[1981 Springbok Tour]]. All universities, and most polytechnics and colleges of education have a students association. Since the economic reforms of the 1990s and the introduction of user pays in tertiary education, students associations and the national body have shifted their focus to challenging inequities in the student loan scheme and high levels of student debt.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Part-time work alongside the introduction of internal assessment and the change of semester structure has been attributed to the declining involvement in extracurricular activities and a shift in focus of the student movement from mass protest to lobbying.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Previous to 1998 membership of Students' Associations (pep) was compulsory at all public Tertiary Education providers (universities, polytechnics and colleges of education). In 1997 the centre-right [[New Zealand National Party|National]] party proposed the [[Voluntary Student Unionism|Voluntary Student Membership]] amendment to the Education act which would have made membership of Students' Associations voluntary at all Tertiary Education Providers.

However the National Party relied on support from the centrist [[New Zealand First]] party to pass legislation. The New Zealand First party preferred that Tertiary Students themselves choose whether their provider should be voluntary or compulsory and pushed through a compromise to the amendment that allowed for a Compulsory Vs Voluntary referendum to be held at every public Tertiary Education Provider. The amendment also allowed for subsequent referendums which could not be held until at least two years had passed since the previous referendum and only if a petition was signed by 10% of the student populace.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

The first wave of referendums were held in 1999, in which several Polytechnics and two Universities (the [[University of Waikato]] and the [[University of Auckland]]) elected to become voluntary.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} In 2002 a second referendum was held at the University of Waikato and students choose to return to compulsory student membership.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Similar referendums at Auckland University in 2001, 2003 and 2005 have all elected to retain voluntary student membership.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Most of New Zealand Tertiary students' associations are confederated under the [[New Zealand Union of Students' Associations]].

====Philippines====
The [[Philippines]] has a complex student union.  The usual names used are "student government", "student council", "student body" The Student Government Program of the elementary and secondary schools is handled by the [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]] while the student councils in state universities and colleges is under the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]]. As well, Every public and private elementary and secondary schools under the Department of Education (DepED) has its own student governments. At the Tertiary Level, also known as higher education or "university" every private and state college and universities in the Philippines has its own student councils. In a university, there is a university student council and every college has its college student council. If a university has external campus(es), the external campuses has its own student council. The student councils within the university (main campus and external campuses) has the student regent, which would represent studentry of the whole university. One example of that is of the [[West Visayas State University]] and [[Central Philippine University]].

====Sri Lanka====
In [[Sri Lanka]], each state university has several Students' unions with formal links to respective faculties.[[Inter University Students' Federation]] is the [[umbrella organization]] of 14 unions of university students. However, most of these have political affiliations and function as proxies of these political factions. Many unions take an active political role within the university and in the country as a whole. This frequently lead to much clashes between rival students' unions or the authorities.

==== Myanmar ====

The role of students' unions in Myanmar were attached with Politics. From 1902, the students' union were outcoming and tried to get the Interdependence of Nation. There were many students boycotts in Myanmar:1920, 1936, 1962, 1974-75-76, 1988, 1996, 2007 and recently 2015 March. Most of them were connected with political issues. The Students' union in Myanmar tried to initiate to get the Interdependence of Burma. They always stood together with the Public difficulties. Now, U Thein Sein Government approved the National Education Law. So, the followed Technical Laws and attached laws are now wishing to get approved. The role of students' union is the greatest power in Myanmar or Burma according to History.

===Africa===
[[File:University of Pretoria Student Council.jpg|thumb|right|200px| &lt;center&gt;The [[University of Pretoria]]'s first student council in 1909 &lt;/center&gt;]]

In South Africa student representative councils are the executive and plenary body of student governance and charters and provides most of the funding for other student groups, and represents students' interests when dealing with the administration. In several instances representatives of these bodies are members of the university's Senate.

In 2012 the first student union, after 42 years of suppression, was founded. Students from Al Mimona Ebem Alharth school public school in Tripoli-Libya successfully established the union and promoted for other schools around the country to do the same. The founder Alaa Amed received local media attention for this achievement. 
 
While higher education and student activism might vary depending on the country the [[National Association of Nigerian Students' (NANS)]] is an organization with well over 50 university union across the nation.

[[Tunisia]] has a lot of students unions, we can see [[Organization of RCD students]] (Of the party [[Democratic Constitutional Rally]] but It was dissolved in 2011 after the [[Tunisian revolution]]), but the largest two poles for students in the country are [[Union générale des étudiants de Tunisie]] (UGET) since 1952 and [[Union générale tunisienne des étudiants]] (UGTE) since 1985.

===Europe===
While each student's union varies by countries the [[European Students' Union]] is an umbrella organization of 45 national unions of students from 36 European countries.

====Denmark====
In [[Denmark]] the [[higher education]] system comprises two parallel sectors: universities and university colleges of applied sciences (e.g. nursing and engineering schools or teachers' colleges). Universities are characterised by scientific research and the highest education based thereon. University colleges of applied sciences are oriented towards working life and base their operations on the high vocational skill requirements set by it. These vocational institutions offer 3-4 year 'professional bachelor's degrees'. Besides that there are a number of art schools. Universities belong under the Ministry of Science, University Colleges belong under the Ministry of Education, and the Art Schools belong under the Ministry of Culture. There are 12 universities at the moment, but in 2006 there is a major merger process going on to make fewer, bigger institutions. The student unions at universities (and some of the art schools' student unions) are generally members of the National Union of Students in Denmark which represents these students on the national level.

Every university has a student union (In [[Danish language|Danish]], ''Studenterråd''). Membership is not mandatory. The student unions are funded by the university and the Ministry of Science on the basis of the percentage of votes received every year at the university election. The student union is autonomous, its internal life organized by its by-laws. The student unions are responsible for all representation of the students and elect the student members of different administrative organs. They usually coordinate and finance the activities of smaller, more specialized student organizations. For the financing of their activities, some student unions exact a membership fee and/or engage in different businesses.

In the Ministry of Culture institutions there are also local student organisations. In the Ministry of Education institutions, The student activities are very much related to a student division of the Labor Union in the different areas. For instance, the teachers' students are organised in the national labor union for teachers and so forth.

The Upper-Secondary schools (In [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Gymnasium (Denmark)|''Gymnasier'']]), It is in Denmark a law that there has to be a studentscouncill at the Upper-Secondary schools. The studentscouncils are organized in the following organisations:

====Finland====
{{Main article|Student unionism in Finland}}

====France====
The central organization of the [[France|French]] higher education system means that local university bodies have restricted decision-making power. As a consequence, student unions are generally established at national level with local sections in most universities. The largest national student unions have a strong political identity and their actions are generally restricted to the defense of their vision of higher education rather than being focused on the particular interests of the membership of a single university. Union membership is regarded as an essentially political decision, without any particular advantage for students. The strength of unions is often measured by their effectiveness in national protests rather than by membership figures.

There are also class-struggle student unions such as the [[Solidaires Étudiant-e-s]] (formed in January 2013 through the fusion of the former organizations SUD Étudiant and Féderation syndicale étudiante (FSE)) which refuse to cooperate with the universities' direction and work to organize students.

In the [[Grandes écoles]], the premium league in the French higher education system, students are generally members of the official Student Office (Bureau des étudiants or Bureau des élèves) in charge of the organization of social activities and sports events. The constitutions of these societies, which work in close partnership with the school administration, usually prevent union members from running for executive positions in order to keep the school independent from political groups liable to harm the school's prestige.

====Germany====
In [[Germany]] the actual form of student representation depends strongly on the [[federal state]]. In most states there is a [[AStA|General Students' Committee]] (AStA) at every university. It is the executive organ of the parliaments and councils of all faculties.

====Greece====
In [[Greece]] every university department has its corresponding student union (in [[Greek language|Greek]]: Σύλλογος Φοιτητών) and all students belonging to the department have the right to register as members. The main objective of a student union is to solve students' problems that can either be related to academic life or have a general political and social nature. Furthermore, student unions organize and support numerous activities such as political debates, demonstrations, university occupations, educational lectures, cultural and artistic events, conferences and so on.

The structure of a student union is rather simple and comprises two bodies: [[The General Students' Assembly (Greece)]] and the [[board of directors]]. The '''general assembly''' consists of all student-members of the union. It takes place on a regular basis and is the only decision-making body. During the general assembly, many topics of student interest are discussed and the decisions are taken after open vote. The '''board of directors''' makes sure that the decisions of the general assembly will be materialized. Moreover, the members of the board of directors, among which is the union's president, participate in various university administrative bodies as representatives of all students in the union.

Every year in early spring the student elections take place nationwide, during which students vote for their representatives. All student unions in Greece are members of the "National Student Union of Greece" (ΕΦΕΕ - Εθνική Φοιτητική Ένωση Ελλάδας).

====Ireland====
[[File:Student's Union Queen's.jpg|thumb|right|[[Queen's University Belfast Students' Union]] Building]]
Most of [[Ireland]]'s [[List of higher education institutions in the Republic of Ireland|universities and colleges]] have students' unions which were established to represent the students in the context of internal college issues and on wider student related issues and also a means of solidarity with other movements globally. An ongoing campaign of virtually every students' union in Ireland is to prevent the reintroduction of tuition fees which were abolished in 1995. Most, but not all, of the students' unions are affiliated with the [[Union of Students in Ireland]]. Notably, two of the seven university students' unions are not members. The students' unions are operated in accordance with the rules set down in their constitution which invariable enumerates a strong democratic and inclusive procedure for the governance on the union. Some Students' Unions run retail businesses in the interests of its students and run referendums, such as on whether or not to support same-sex marriage or abortion.

All Universities and Institutes of Technologies in the Republic of Ireland have Students' Unions.

[[National Union of Students-Union of Students in Ireland]] (NUS-USI), the student movement in [[Northern Ireland]] was formed in 1972 by bilateral agreement between the [[National Union of Students of the United Kingdom]] (NUS) and the [[Union of Students in Ireland]] (USI), to address the particular problems of representing [[students]] in [[Northern Ireland]].

====Netherlands====
There are several students' unions in The Netherlands which act as labor unions for students. The largest ones are VSSD&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vssd.nl Vereniging voor Studie en Studentenbelangen te Delft]. Vssd.nl. Retrieved on 2010-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Delft]] and ASVA Studentenunie&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asva.nl ASVA Studentenunie &gt; ASVA]. Asva.nl. Retrieved on 2010-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Amsterdam]]. These students' unions are all members of LSVb,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lsvb.nl LSVb home]. Lsvb.nl. Retrieved on 2010-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt; the national students' union. There's also a similar organization called [[Dutch National Students Association|ISO]] (Interstedelijk Studenten Overleg), which consists of several formal participation organizations, as well as ASVA Studentenunie and VSSD. Both ISO and LSVb are members of [[European Students' Union]].

Lastly, the Netherlands has an (unofficial) student union for its students that study abroad: [[Netherlands Worldwide Students]] or simply NEWS.

The Netherlands is also home to a unique case of student representation in which a local political party completely run by student gained seats during local town hall elections: [[STIP]].

====Norway====
In [[Norway]], every university is instructed and required by law to have a Student Union elected by the pupils/students at the school. The goal for every Student Union is to improve their school environment through encouraging social, cultural and other extracurricular events that is happening in the local community. The student unions in [[Norway]] is governed by a [[board of directors]] which is elected directly from the Student Council.

====Portugal====
In [[Portugal]], every university, polytechnic institute and any other higher education schools has their own students' unions. Union organizations are generally aimed to organize and promote extracurricular activities such as sports and culture events, parties, and academic festivities. At the same time, they also act as "[[labour unions]] for students" promoting and defending the student's points of view and rights, and dealing with the teaching institutions and the State's education agencies policies. The oldest union of Portugal is the [[Associação Académica de Coimbra]] (founded in 1887) which belongs to the students of the [[University of Coimbra]]. The biggest students' union is [[:pt:Associação dos Estudantes do Instituto Superior Técnico|Associação dos Estudantes do Instituto Superior Técnico (AEIST)]].

====Sweden====
{{Main article|Swedish National Union of Students}}
{{See also|Nations at Swedish universities|Stockholm Federation of Student Unions}}
At [[list of universities in Sweden|Swedish universities]], students' unions are responsible for representing the students in evaluation of the education and decision-making within the universities. Not Swedish universities{{clarify|date=January 2013}} are affiliated with the [[Swedish National Union of Students]]. The union normally holds about one-third of the votes within every decision making body and thus holds a great deal of power.

The unions are usually governed by a general assembly of elected representatives. Students' unions generally provide [[School Counselor|counselling]] services to its members and publishes their own [[magazines]] or [[newspaper]]s. Large universities often have several students' unions, where the smaller students' unions only provide basic services. Larger students' unions often own and run their own facilities at the university such as shops, restaurants and night clubs.

====United Kingdom====

{{See also|National Union of Students (United Kingdom)}}
[[File:Wfm glasgow university union.jpg|thumb|right|[[Glasgow University Union]] was the last students' union in the UK to begin admitting women.]]
The United Kingdom has a long history of student unionism at a local and national level. The oldest students' union in Britain is [[University of St Andrews Students Association|St Andrews]], founded in 1864, and the oldest in England is believed to be the [[Liverpool Guild of Students]], formed in 1892.&lt;ref name="LGoS"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Guild |publisher=Liverpool Guild of Students |url=http://www.lgos.org/main-menu/guild-life/history-of-the-guild |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621211819/http://www.lgos.org/main-menu/guild-life/history-of-the-guild |archive-date=21 June 2014 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most bodies are termed ''unions'', however there exist a number of ''guilds'' and ''students' associations''.  Students' associations is a popular term in Scotland, as historically there were separate men's and women's unions focused on societies and entertainment with representation to the university carried out by separate [[Students' Representative Council]]s. Most students' unions in the UK are affiliated to the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]], although there exist other national representative bodies, such the [[National Postgraduate Committee]], the [[Coalition of Higher Education Students in Scotland]] and the [[Aldwych Group]], the association of students' unions of members of the [[Russell Group]].

[[National Union of Students-Union of Students in Ireland]] (NUS-USI), the student movement in [[Northern Ireland]] was formed in 1972 by bilateral agreement between the [[National Union of Students of the United Kingdom]] (NUS) and the [[Union of Students in Ireland]] (USI), to address the particular problems of representing [[students]] in [[Northern Ireland]].

===The Americas===

====Canada====
{{main article|List of Canadian students' associations}}
In [[Canada]], membership in a college or university students' union is mandatory across Canada under various provincial statutes.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} Included in Canadian students' [[tuition fees]] is anywhere from an additional $10–$500 fee to pay for the services of the union. The money raised from dues is often used to support a staff and office. Student elections usually happen around March as the membership elect their unions' executives. The current largest undergraduate student union in Canada is the Alma Mater Society, at the University of British Columbia, with around 56,000 members.

Most students' unions are charged by their membership to protect their best interests at the university, municipal, provincial and federal government levels. Many students' unions in Canada are members of one of the national student organizations, the [[Canadian Alliance of Student Associations]] (CASA) or the [[Canadian Federation of Students]] (CFS). Those that belong to the CFS at the national level also belong to the CFS at the provincial level. Those that do not belong to the CFS may belong to a provincial student organization like the [http://nbsa-aenb.ca/ New Brunswick Student Alliance], the [[Ontario Undergraduate Student Alliance]] ([http://www.ousa.ca/ OUSA]), the [http://collegestudentalliance.ca/ College Student Alliance], [http://studentsns.ca/ StudentsNS] (formerly known as ANSSA), the [http://www.bcstudents.ca/ Alliance of British Columbia Students], the [http://caus.net/ Council of Alberta University Students], or the [http://www.albertastudents.ca/ Alberta Students Executive Council]. In Quebec, the provincial student organizations are the [[Quebec Federation of University Students]] (''Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec'' or FEUQ) for university students, [[College education in Quebec|college]] students are represented by the [[Fédération étudiante collégiale du Québec]] or FECQ, while the [[Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante]] or ASSE is a more radical organisation that includes students from both levels of education.

Different provinces have different rules governing student unions.  In British Columbia under section 27.1 of the University Act, student unions may only raise or rescind mandatory student union fees through a democratic referendum of the membership.  Once fees are passed through this mechanism, the board of governors of the respective institutions are then required to remit those fees to the student union, and may only interfere in the internal affairs of the student union if it fails to complete annual audits of its finances, giving these student unions strong autonomy over their institutions.  In Ontario, the autonomy of student unions is set by standards outlined by each institution, giving university administrators a broader scope of powers over the finances of student unions.

====Mexico====
In [[Mexico]], students unions are mostly predominant in universities. Mexican universities have an elected student committee each year, but the faculties or schools within the universities have also their own union. This practice is also extended to other levels of education, such as high and junior high school, but to a lesser extent. An example of this is the [[Sociedad de Alumnos de HPA Mexico]].

Jesuit student groups played an important role in Mexico's history, particularly in opposing the imposition of socialist education in Mexico in the 1930s. Leaders from the ''Unión Nacional de Estudiantes Católicos'' (UNEC) had long-term importance in Mexico's political history, since a number of them helped form the conservative [[National Action Party (Mexico)]].&lt;ref&gt;David Espinosa, ''Jesuit Student Groups, the Universidad Iberoamericana, and Political Resistance in Mexico, 1913-1979''. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
{{Main article|Student governments in the United States}}
In the United States, these groups are often known as '''student government''', '''associated students''', '''student senate''', or less commonly a '''student's union'''.  In the U.S., the phrase "student union" often refers to a "[[student activity center]]" (also known as a "student center" or "student commons"), a building with dining halls, game rooms, lounges, student offices, and other spaces for student activities. At institutions with large graduate, medical school, and individual "college" populations, there are often student governments that serve those specific constituencies.

====Brazil====
The Brazilian students union is also called [[the Brazilian Student Association]]. It was formed in 1991 in order to provide the Brazilian students with representation that was fair and even within the LSU campus. The union has also set a side goal of promoting their Brazilian culture, since they are a Portuguese-speaking Latin American country.

'''The Brazilian Society'''

This society has existed since 2003 and now has 190 members, where only one third are Brazilian. The other two thirds are people who are just interested in Brazilian politics, famous parties and culture. This is one of the societies that students may join if they so wish. The society has social events and it hosts lectures. They also have a Brazilian discussion group on a weekly basis in order to discuss current events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =  União Nacional dos Estudantes | url=http://www.une.org.br}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Substitutes for leadership theory''' is a [[leadership]] theory first developed by Steven Kerr and John M. Jermier in 1978. The theory states that different situational factors can enhance, neutralize, or substitute for leader behaviors (Avolio, Walumbwa, &amp; Weber, 2009; Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001). It has received criticism for shortcomings due to perceived methodological issues (Dionne, Yammarino, Atwater, &amp; James, 2002; Podsakoff &amp; Mackenzie, 1995). Empirical research has produced mixed results as to its ability to predict subordinate outcomes.

==Origins==
Over the years, researchers have developed many [[leadership theory|leadership theories]].  Prior to the 1970s, [[trait leadership]] theory and [[path-goal theory]] were the two heavily researched theories. (Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001).  Proponents of trait leadership theory held that the ability to lead is a characteristic some people innately have and others do not.  Effort was put forth to uncover which characteristics and abilities leaders had that separated them from non-leaders.
Leadership style was another angle researchers took.  Proponents of this approach did not believe the ability to lead was innate, rather it was a set of behaviors anyone could learn (Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001).

In the mid 1970s, a great deal of research was dedicated to the contingency model and path-goal theory (Schriesheim, 1997).  The contingency model stated that various leadership styles would be more or less effective depending on the situation (Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001; Fiedler, 1965; Hunt, 1967).  Path-goal theory proposed that subordinates would be satisfied with their leader if they perceived that their leader’s behavior would bring them future satisfaction.  Subordinates would be motivated by their leader if they perceived that completing work tasks would bring them satisfaction, and if the leader provided proper coaching, support, rewards, and guidance (House, 1996).  Frustrations with not being able to find significant results with any one theory resulted in the development of reexaminations and new approaches, including questioning which situations necessitated a leader figure and which did not (Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001).

Steven Kerr was one of the researchers publicly expressing his frustrations (e.g., Kerr &amp; Harlan, 1973) with current leadership theories.  In the 1970s, Kerr was at Ohio State University actively involved in leadership research.  Kerr was studying existing proposed subordinate constructs such as organizational independence (Schriesheim, 1997) and proposed leadership constructs such as consideration and initiating structure (put forth by the Ohio State Leadership Studies; Kerr, Schriesheim, Murphy, &amp; Stogdill, 1974).

Subordinates that are organizational independents do not feel tied to one company and are internally motivated instead of motivated by the characteristics of the organization, such as leader behavior (House &amp; Kerr, 1973; Schriesheim, 1997).  Leaders high on initiating structure clarify their own role and their subordinates’ roles in obtaining a goal (Kerr et al., 1974). Kerr and colleagues (1974) noticed many studies had found significant [[Moderation (statistics)|moderators]] that played a part in the relationship between initiating structure leader behavior and subordinate outcomes.  For example, when a task was ambiguous, the relationship between leader initiating structure and subordinate satisfaction was stronger than if the task was clear. These findings made it apparent that there were variables that affected the relationship between leader behavior and subordinate outcomes, making the relationship stronger or weaker.

Kerr (1973) was the first to coin substitutes for leadership as elements in the work setting that lessened leader effectiveness on subordinate outcomes.  Further publications (e.g., Kerr et al., 1974) led to Kerr and Jermier’s 1978 paper, which unveiled substitutes for leadership theory.  This paper presented two types of elements in the job environment: substitutes and neutralizers.  These elements were proposed to serve as moderators in the relationship between leader behavior and subordinate outcomes.

The theory originally classified substitutes as characteristics of the subordinate, characteristics of the task, and characteristics of the organization.  Howell, Dorfman, &amp; Kerr (1986) proposed an alteration to the theory in terms of subordinate classification.  They argued that moderators should be grouped based on their effect on the criterion.  The original theory had already proposed moderators that act as substitutes and moderators that act as neutralizers.  Howell and colleagues added enhancers to these.

Substitutes for leadership theory was a heavily researched area until the late 1980s, when [[transformational leadership]] became the focus of the majority of leadership research (Dionne, Yammarino, Howell, &amp; Villa, 2005).

==Definitions==

===Substitutes for leadership theory===

Substitutes for leadership theory states that different situational factors can enhance, neutralize, or substitute for leader behaviors (Avolio et al., 2009; Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001).

===Substitutes===
Substitutes are variables that make leadership unnecessary for subordinates (Schriesheim, 1997) and reduce the extent to which subordinates rely on their leader (Kerr et al.,1974)

====Examples of substitutes====
* Characteristics of the subordinate
** Subordinate ability (Kerr &amp; Jermier, 1978)
** Subordinate’s professional orientation (Kerr &amp; Jermier, 1978)
* Characteristics of the task
** Unambiguous and routine task (when all subordinates are performing menial labor, there is little role leadership can play; Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001)
** Task that provides its own feedback as to how well the task is being done (Kerr &amp; Jermier, 1978)
** Task that is intrinsically satisfying (Kerr &amp; Jermier, 1978)
* Characteristics of the organization
** Cohesive work groups (a tight-knit group of employees have less need for a leader; Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001)
** Organizational formulation (clear job goals that are written down, performance appraisals that are written down; Howell &amp; Dorfman, 1981; Kerr and Jermier, 1987)
** Self-managed work teams (employees rely on each other, not their leader; Villa, Howell, Dorfman, &amp; Daniel, 2003)

===Enhancers===
Enhancers are variables that serve to strengthen leader influence on subordinate outcomes (Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001; Howell et al., 1986; Schriesheim, 1997).

====Examples of enhancers====
* Characteristics of the subordinate
** Subordinates having experience (those more experienced will be able to translate even the most ambiguous instructions into results; Howell et al., 1986)
* Characteristics of the task
** Task is non-routine (Kerr &amp; Jermier, 1978)
* Characteristics of the organization
** Having group norms that encourage cooperation with leaders (Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001)
** Leader having the ability to reward subordinates (Howell et al., 1986)

===Neutralizers===
Neutralizers are variables which serve to weaken, or block leader influence on subordinate outcomes (Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001; Schriesheim, 1997).

====Examples of neutralizers====
* Characteristics of the subordinate
** Subordinates are indifferent when it comes to rewards (Kerr &amp; Jermier, 1978)
* Characteristics of the organization
** Whether or not subordinates are rewarded is not the leader’s decision (Kerr &amp; Jermier, 1978)
* Kerr &amp; Jermier (1978) never specified an example of a task characteristic that acts as a neutralizer.

==Scales used to measure==

===Kerr and Jermier===
The original scale to measure the effects of various substitutes was developed by Kerr and Jermier (1978).  They assessed leadership substitutes via a questionnaire that contained thirteen subscales with a total of 55 items.  The items were on a [[Likert scale]] ranging from 1 (almost always untrue or completely untrue), to 5 (almost always true or almost completely true).

The subscales included were:
# Ability, experience, training, and knowledge
# Professional orientation
# Indifference towards organizational rewards
# Unambiguous, routine, and methodically invariant tasks
# Task-provided feedback concerning accomplishment
# Intrinsically satisfying tasks
# Organizational formulization
# Organizational inflexibility
# Advisory and staff functions
# Close-knit, cohesive, interdependent work groups
# Organizational rewards not within the leader’s control
# Spatial distance between superior and subordinates
# Subordinate need for independence

Kerr and Jermier (1978) tested nine of these subscales in a lab setting and found that they were independent and had adequate internal [[reliability (statistics)|reliabilities]]. They claim that the subscales produce easily interpretable data which describe the extent to which substitutes for leadership are present or absent in a given work situation.
They went on to test their subscales in a field setting using police officers, and concluded that the subscales met acceptable standards of reliability, and can be used to assess the [[validity (statistics)|validity]] of the substitutes for leadership construct in future studies.

===Podsakoff, Niehoff, MacKenzie, and Williams===
Podsakoff, Niehoff, MacKenzie, and Williams (1993) noted that studies testing the substitutes for leadership model had not been fully supportive of the theory, and believed that one reason for this may be that the quality of the scale developed by Kerr and Jermier (1978) to measure the substitutes constructs may be to blame. In response to this, they designed their own 74-item measure of substitutes for leadership.
To test their scale, they administered it to 372 business students.  Their analyses of the [[psychometrics|psychometric]] properties of the revised measure revealed their scale to be superior to Kerr and Jermier’s scale, as evidenced by better dimensionality and reliability of the revised scale.

==Consequences==

Kerr and Jermier (1978) proposed that substitute variables should render leader behaviors unable to predict subordinate outcomes.  Researchers that have tested this characteristic of substitutes have found mixed results (Howell &amp; Dorfman, 1981; Podsakoff &amp; MacKenzie, 1995).

A study involving hospital personnel (Howell &amp; Dorfman, 1981) found that tasks that gave feedback regarding performance were negatively correlated with [[job satisfaction]].  Routine repetitive work tasks were correlated with [[organizational commitment]].  Intrinsically satisfying work, organizational formulation, and cohesive work groups were substitutes that were significantly correlated with both job satisfaction and organizational commitment.  However, they found little evidence that substitutes prevented or replaced a leader’s effect on subordinate job satisfaction or organizational commitment.  The only substitute that served as a replacement was organizational formulation, which replaced leader behavior’s predictive power in explaining subordinate job satisfaction and organizational commitment .

Another study (Podsakoff &amp; Mackenzie, 1995) looked at 1,235 employees working for 265 leaders in a variety of job settings.  Among their findings were that intrinsically satisfying tasks were positively related to subordinate satisfaction, indifference to rewards was negatively related to organizational commitment, and organizational formulation was negatively related to subordinate perceptions of role ambiguity.  The researchers in this study concluded that substitutes for leadership were useful in predicting subordinate outcomes, but leader behaviors and substitutes should always be studied together, because together they explained about a third of the total [[variance]] in subordinate outcomes in their sample .
A more recent study conducted by Dionne and colleagues (2002) collected data from 940 subordinates.  Unsatisfied with the fact that prior studies had tested substitutes, enhancers, and neutralizers as moderators, they tested the effect of substitutes as [[Mediation (statistics)|mediators]] as well as moderators.  Testing a variety of different substitutes and outcomes, the researchers found only very weak evidence that substitutes make a difference, and concluded that leader behaviors are the only important variable in predicting employee outcomes.
Podsakoff, MacKenzie, and Bommer (1996) conducted a [[meta-analysis]] in which they took the results of 22 studies that examined the main effect of substitutes for leadership on the relationship between leader behaviors and subordinate outcomes.  They found evidence supporting the theory— taking into account both leader behaviors and the effect of substitutes accounted for more of the variance in subordinate outcomes than taking into account leader behaviors alone.

==Applications==

===Autonomous work groups===
Bass (1990) suggested that [[autonomous work group]]s can substitute for formal leadership.  In this scenario, employees are divided into groups that are responsible for managing their own day-to-day work (i.e. collective control over pace, distribution of tasks, organization of breaks, recruitment, and training; Gulowsen, 1972).  A [[quasi-experiment]] conducted by Wall, Kemp, Jackson, and Clegg (1986) found that implementing autonomous work groups of 8 to 12 shop-floor employees in a manufacturing setting positively affected both the intrinsic and extrinsic job satisfaction of employees, while obviating some supervisory positions.

===Self-management===
Self-management is defined by Thoresen and Mahoney (1974) as occurring when an individual behaves in a way he would not normally behave, and there are no external forces dictating that the person maintain that behavior.
Self-management requires self-observations (e.g., keeping a log of what one has discussed with others on the phone), specification of goals (e.g., being responsible for setting one’s own schedule and priorities), cueing strategies (e.g., putting a checkout board by the exit to remind an employee to let their secretary know where they are going and when they expect to return), rehearsal (e.g., recording one’s presentation to clients and making corrections as needed), self-evaluation (e.g., using a chart to keep track of work quality and quantity), and self-reinforcement (accomplished by building intrinsic rewards for the performance of tasks; Bass, 1990; Manz &amp; Sims 1980).  These strategies can be understood as being substitutes for leadership.  Instead of requiring that a supervisor monitor a subordinate’s progress on a work task, a subordinate can self-manage by utilizing one of the strategies listed above.  This makes the supervisor’s guidance unnecessary for the subordinate.

==Criticisms and methodological problems with research==

===Common-source bias===
Dionne and colleagues (2002) argued that significant effects of substitutes found in prior studies may be a statistical artifact due to ''common-source bias'', or bias occurring when independent and dependent variables are collected from the same person or group of people.  In a study sampling 49 organizations, Dionne and colleagues controlled for the effect of common-source bias and found no moderating or mediating effects of substitutes on the relationship between leader behavior and group effectiveness.

In a study by Podsakoff and Mackenzie (1995), the predictor variables, as well as the job attitude and role perception variables, were both taken from individual employees, while the performance measures were taken from supervisors. They found that their predictors accounted for a higher proportion of variance in job attitudes and role perceptions, than in employee performance. They posit the reason for this was that their predictors shared a common source with the job attitudes and role perception criterion measures, but not with the employee performance criterion measures. They suggested that common-source bias may not be the only reason for this, but that it should be controlled in future research.

===Lack of longitudinal studies===
Keller (2006) conducted a [[longitudinal study]] in which he pointed out that the vast majority of studies conducted on substitutes for leadership theory are [[cross-sectional study|cross-sectional]] in nature, making it more difficult to discern a causal relationship between substitutes and their effects on employee performance.  Cross-sectional research is focused on finding relationships between variables at a specific point in time, whereas longitudinal studies involve taking multiple measures over a longer period of time.  Keller’s longitudinal study of the effect of substitutes on Research &amp; Development teams found that two of the seven substitutes (ability and intrinsic satisfaction) affected team performance over time.

===Conceptual weakness===
Yukl (1998) pointed out that it is hard to identify specific substitutes and neutralizers for broad behavior categories, and that an improvement on the theory would be to use more specific behaviors in place of "supportive and instrumental leadership behaviors." Yukl said that recent studies testing the theory have used specific behaviors (e.g., contingent reward behavior and role clarification), however the development of the theory does not reflect these developments.

==Closely related constructs==

===Contingency model===
The [[Fiedler contingency model|contingency model]] of leadership was developed by Fred Fiedler in the 1960s after Fiedler spent 12 years collecting data from over 800 groups of employees.  This model predicts that the most effective method of leadership will vary depending on the situation.  A study which supported the model was one Fiedler did with 48 petty officers and 240 recruiters at a Belgium naval training center (Fiedler, 1965).  Fiedler found that a leader’s fit with the group and the task was more important in predicting outcomes than the leader’s characteristics.  For example, controlling leaders went best with heterogeneous groups with low position power (Fiedler, 1965; Hunt 1967).
There are many different theories within the contingency paradigm, which differ on what situational factors change leadership effectiveness.  The most influential theory within this model is path-goal theory (Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001).

===Path-goal theory===
Proposed by Robert House in 1971, [[path-goal theory]] predicts that subordinates will be satisfied with their leader if they feel their leader’s behavior will lead them to satisfaction.  Also, subordinates will be motivated when they feel that their satisfaction depends on their performance and their leader acts in a way to help them reach goals (Den Hartog &amp; Koopman, 2001, House, 1971).  Path-goal theory predicts that when goals and the paths to those goals are clear, subordinates may not need leader guidance (Kerr &amp; Jermier, 1978).

'''Thomas Swiss''' is an American poet and writer.  He was a Professor of English and Rhetoric of Inquiry at the [[University of Iowa]].  He is currently professor of Culture and Teaching at the [[University of Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inms.umn.edu/digerati/season_4/november_05.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Swiss grew up in the suburbs of Chicago, mostly in Aurora, Illinois, where his father had an optometric practice. He graduated from the University of Illinois-Urbana, moved to Nottingham, England  and returned to Illinois to work for the [[National Council of Teachers of English]].  In 1976, he went to the Writers' Workshop at the University of Iowa and earned an M.F.A. in creative writing,  He taught at [[Drake University]] in Iowa, was awarded a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship and published his first book of poems, ''Measure'', with the [[University of Alabama Press]].  His next book, ''Rough Cut'', was published by the [[University of Illinois Press]].

His poems have appeared in many periodicals, including ''[[The American Scholar (magazine)|The American Scholar]]'', ''[[Boston Review]]'', ''[[AGNI (magazine)|AGNI]]'', and the ''[[Iowa Review]]''. His collaborative new media poems and literary projects have been exhibited in museums and shows, including shows at the School of Visual Arts, New York; The British Academy, UK; Transmediale.02 Festival, Berlin, Germany; and the South By Southwest New Media Festival, Austin TX.  His critical articles have appeared in numerous journals, including the ''Review of Education, Pedagogy, and Cultural Studies'', ''Popular Music'', ''Postmodern Culture'', ''Current Musicology'', and ''The New England Review''. His book reviews have been published in ''The New York Times Book Review'', ''Contemporary Visual Arts'', and other magazines.

He has authored critical articles and book chapters, and edited or co-edited nine books including ''New Media Poetics: Contexts, Technotexts, and Theories'' (MIT Press, co-edited with Adalaide Morris), a collection meant to extend understanding of networked writing and programming as a medium for an emergent poetics. In ''Highway 61 Revisited: Bob Dylan's Road from Minnesota to the World'' (U Minnesota Press, co-edited with Colleen Sheehy), Dylan's work is explored in both local and global perspectives.  Other books include ''The World Wide Web and Contemporary Cultural Theory : Magic, Metaphor, Power'' (Routledge, co-edited with Andrew Herman)  which brings together well-known scholars across the humanities and social sciences to explore the Web as a cultural technology.  His recent collaborative collection (Routledge, co-edited with Andrew Herman and Jan Hadlaw) is on the topic of the imaginaries and materialities of the mobile internet.

==Reviews==
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is about time that the Web and the internet are theorized this side of euphoria! The Herman and Swiss collection contains valuable meditations on the impact of the Web on society and culture, shorn of the cheerleading of Wired magazine, Negroponte, Turkle, and Gates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://enculturation.gmu.edu/3_1/agger/ ''REVIEW: Andrew Herman's and Thomas Swiss' The World Wide Web and Contemporary Cultural Theory: Magic, Metaphor, Power'', Ben Agger, Enculturation, Vol. 3, No. 1, Fall 2000] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120707182414/http://enculturation.gmu.edu/3_1/agger/ |date=2012-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Thor Heyerdahl''''' (named after [[Thor Heyerdahl]]), originally named '''''Tinka''''', later '''''Marga Henning''''', '''''Silke''''', and '''''Minnow''''', was built as a freight carrying motor ship with auxiliary sails at the [[shipyard]] Smit &amp; Zoon in [[Westerbroek]], Netherlands, in 1930. Her original [[homeport]] being [[Hamburg]], Germany, she was used for the next 50 years as a freighter. Eventually sailing unter the flag of [[Panama]] as ''Minnow'' and then awaiting further use in Germany, she was bought in 1979 by two sailing enthusiasts, who turned the now run-down ship into a topsail schooner to use it for [[sail training]], especially for teenagers and young adults. One of the two original owners was Detlef Soitzek, who had sailed with the Norwegian [[anthropologist]], [[zoologist]], [[ethnologist]] and adventurer [[Thor Heyerdahl]] on his ''Tigris'' expedition in 1977/1978, and suggested to name the ship after the famous researcher and adventurer. The ownership of the ship was subsequently turned over to an association.

From spring to fall, ''Thor Heyerdahl'' sails mainly the [[Baltic Sea]] and participates in international sail training events. In winter, the ship has repeatedly crossed the Atlantic Ocean and sailed in the Caribbean, especially as ''classroom under sails'' with teenage crews.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4446">'''Transparency International Slovakia''' ('''TIS''') is a [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) which was established in 1998 and a member organization of [[Transparency International]]. It aims to increase transparency and create a corruption-free world by working together with the private sector, civil society and public sector. Corruption is rife and a major issue in [[Slovakia]]. TIS focuses on policies involving local and regional governments to uphold democracy and a free market economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transparency International Slovakia|url=http://www.transparency.sk/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Case study: Privatisation of Slovak Telecom (1999–2000) ==
=== Background of corruption in Slovakia ===
Under the previous heavily corrupted governance (1994–1998), [[privatization]] was not a transparent process, leading to many cases of [[embezzlement]]. Many private firms were sold at a loss, leading some to [[bankruptcy]] and causing negative fiscal impact on the Slovak economy. With the change to a new governance in October 1998, TIS was invited to monitor and increase the [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency level]] of the privatization process of [[Slovak Telecom]] and ultimately, reduce corruption.

=== Goals of the project ===
The main goals of the monitoring of the privatization process of Slovak Telecom in which Transparency International Slovakia participated as an independent observer were: 
# to observe the process in order to increase transparency and minimize the possibility of corruption
# to raise awareness of the general public about corruption and transparency issues in Slovakia, especially in privatization and [[public procurement]] [[Request for tender|tenders]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last=Holloway|first=Richard|title=Anti_Corruption NGO Resources|url=http://www.impactalliance.org/ev_en.php?ID=12430_201&amp;ID2=DO_TOPIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Actions taken by TIS ===
TIS sought to improve transparency of the process by first forming a tri-party which, together with TIS, helped monitor the entire process, thereby increasing transparency. Observing the process also allowed TIS to [[Brainstorming|brainstorm]] ideas that would improve transparency. For instance, a major problem identified was with regard to the documentation language. Documents are written only in [[English language|English]], a language of which command is imprecise, hence leaving the document open to interpretation.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
In addition, TIS published news and information on the privatisation to [[educate]] and increase public awareness on transparency issues.

=== Results of the changes ===
Through the media, TIS managed to increase public interest and awareness on issues concerning transparency and anti-corruption. The extent of public participation and [[Broadcasting|media]] influence was exemplified during the process, through public outcry against corruption that led to the resignation of two corrupt officials, the first of its kind in the country. Realizing the need for a greater transparency level in the privatization process, TIS established and recommended numerous policies for administrative changes. These included:&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
* “Privatization Information Minimum”
* “Public Procurement Information Minimum”
* Amendment of the Law on Public Procurement
* Working Group on Public Procurement

== Post-evaluation statistics ==
According to two reports, the progress of corruption in Slovakia remains unclear. [[World Bank]] statistics show that in the period after the policy implementation, corruption in Slovakia worsened from 0.31 in 2000 to 0.13 in 2002, thereafter the corruption index showed a general upward trend of an increase of the index by 0.3 points by 2008.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Measuring Corruption: A Comparison Between the Transparency International’S Corruption Perceptions Index and the World Bank’S Worldwide Governance Indicators|url=http://www.cesifo-group.de/portal/pls/portal/docs/1/1192926.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the other hand, Transparency International statistics show that after 2000, corruption has been steadily decreasing in the country from 3.5 in 2000 to 4.98 in 2008 signaling a decrease by 1.48 index points.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

[[File:kriegerhall.jpg|thumb|[[Murray Krieger]] Hall in the School of Humanities, an example of the [[Brutalist]] architecture of the UC Irvine campus.]]
The '''School of Humanities''' is one of the [[Faculty (division)|academic units]] of the [[University of California, Irvine]]. 
Upon the school's opening in 1965, the '''Division of Humanities''' was one of the five liberal arts divisions that the campus had to offer. Samuel McCulloch was appointed as UC Irvine's founding dean of Humanities 1953.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;https://www.humanities.uci.edu/SOH/about/history.php&lt;/ref&gt; The School hosts the [[Thesaurus Linguae Graecae]]&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; and the [[University of California Humanities Research Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;http://uchri.org/uchri/about-uchri/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The division of humanities is one of the five liberal arts divisions that opened with the campus in 1965. In 1963, Samuel McCulloch was appointed as the founding dean of UC Irvine Division of Humanities and laid its foundation. Upon the campus' opening day, he created four departments within the divion with a total of thirty-one faculty members. The four departments were: English and Comparative Literature, Foreign Languages and Literature, History, and Philosophy. By 1967, the governing body of UC Irvine turned the five liberal arts divisions into individual schools and the Division of Humanities had become the School of Humanities. In 1970 the Humanities Core Course was implemented and there was a focus on strengthening existing Humanities departments for the rest of the 1970s. The school also launched a doctorate in Critical Theory, making UC Irvine to be the only university in the country to offer a doctorate in the field.
In the 1980s, Dean Ken Bailes founded the Organized Research Unit in Critical Theory and brought the system wide University of California Humanities Research Institute to UC Irvine. The School of Humanities started gaining national recognition and it expanded and grew throughout the 1990s and 2000s. The Humanities Instructional Building and Humanities Gateway were built and completed the Humanities Quad. The school today continues to expand by adding special programs and by creating cross collaboration with different schools on campus. The school has a total of 13 departments and over 20 majors and several interdisciplinary programs.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humanities.uci.edu/SOH/about/history.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
The University of California, Irvine School of Humanities has various programs that are offered to the undergraduate and graduate students. Each program has their own faculty, classes, and events that are aimed to help students develop further into each respective field. Programs in the School of Humanities are among the highest-ranked in the country, contributing to UCI’s reputation as one of the very best public universities. 
&lt;ref&gt;http://uci.edu/academics/humanities.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Nanammal was born in an [[agricultural]] family at Zameen Kaliayapuram,[[Coimbatore]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]]. Her husband was a Siddha practitioner and was into [[agriculture]] and [[Horticulture|cultivation]], She moved to Negamam after marriage and later to [[Ganapathy, Coimbatore]]. At the age of 8, She learnt yoga from her father, she mastered more than 50 [[asana]]s. Over the past five decades, Nanammal has trained more than one million students and continues to teach 100 students daily at the 'Ozone Yoga Centre' established by her. Around 600 of her students, including 36 members of her family, have become 'Yoga instructors' around the world.&lt;ref name="deccanchronicle"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/lifestyle/viral-and-trending/210816/v-nanammal-the-nonagenarian-yogini.html|work=deccanchronicle.com|author=MERIN JAMES|title=V Nanammal: The nonagenarian yogini|publisher=2016, deccanchronicle.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timesofindia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/nanammal-the-yoga-grandma-wins-padma-shri/articleshow/62657160.cms|work=timesofindia.com|author=Staff|title=Nanammal, the yoga grandma, wins Padma Shri|publisher=2018, timesofindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yoga practice==
Nanammal started practicing yoga when she was 8 years old. She learned yoga from her father, who was a [[martial artist]], Nanammal's husband was a Siddha practitioner in the village and was also into [[agriculture]]. That is how she cultivated a liking towards [[naturopathy]] after her marriage. She never stopped practicing yoga at any point in her life.&lt;ref name="deccanchronicle"/&gt;

Nanammal's father and grandfather were both 'Registered Indian Medicine Practitioners (RIMP)', Yoga was their family tradition and they were not teaching yoga to anyone outside the family and it stayed within the group. During those days, the primary business was [[agriculture]] in [[Kerala]] state, where their family owned [[coconut]] and [[cashew]] farms, along with traditional Siddha medicine.&lt;ref name="Quartz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1010262/international-yoga-day-indias-oldest-yogini-says-youre-doing-yoga-wrong-if-youre-working-up-a-sweat/|work=qz.com|author=Sushma UN|title=India’s oldest yogini says you’re doing yoga wrong if you’re working up a sweat|publisher=2017, Quartz India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was an incident involving her mother-in-law that made Nanammal to realize that yoga could potentially help other people as well. Her mother-in-law was out in the farm and had wrenched her leg, Instead of getting treatment from a doctor, She offered to teach her some yoga poses and she got better wit this technique.
After that incident, her mother-in-law became her very first student. Over the years, Nanammal began teaching her neighbors and other children, and by the time 1970s, she had decided to teach yoga to even more people. Hence, The 'Ozone Yoga school' was established and since then, Nanammal and her family have taught yoga to over 100,000 people.&lt;ref name="Quartz"/&gt;

Nanammal and her family, including her children, grandchildren and even great-grand children, follow the traditions passed on from generation to generation. In the year 1972 they established "Ozone Yoga centre" in [[Coimbatore]] and they teach their traditional style of yoga, which focuses more on ''[[Pranayama]] (Breath control)''.&lt;ref name="timesofindia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Quartz"/&gt;
