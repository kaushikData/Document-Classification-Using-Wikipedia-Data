'''4-Dimethylaminophenylpentazole''' is an unstable, [[explosive]] compound that contains the rare [[pentazole]] ring, which is composed of five nitrogen atoms. The [[Polar effect|electron donating effect]] of the 4-dimethylamino substituent on the [[phenyl]] ring makes this compound one of the more stable of the phenylpentazoles. At room temperature, its [[chemical half-life]] is only a few hours, although storage is possible at [[cryogenic]] temperatures. The compound was first prepared in 1956&lt;ref&gt;Huisgen R, I. Ugi.

Continuous [[particulate air monitor]]s (CPAMs) have been used for years in nuclear facilities to assess airborne particulate [[radioactivity]] (APR). In more recent times they may also be used to monitor people in their homes for the presence of manmade radioactivity. These monitors can be used to trigger alarms, indicating to personnel that they should evacuate an area. This article will focus on CPAM use in [[Nuclear power|nuclear power plants]], as opposed to other [[Nuclear fuel cycle|nuclear fuel-cycle]] facilities, or laboratories, or public-safety applications.

In nuclear power plants, CPAMs are used for measuring releases of APR from the facility, monitoring levels of APR for protection of plant personnel, monitoring the air in the reactor containment structure to detect leakage from the reactor systems, and to control ventilation fans, when the APR level has exceeded a defined threshold in the ventilation system.

== Introduction ==
CPAMs use a pump to draw air through a filter medium to collect airborne particulate matter that carries very small particles of radioactive material; the air itself is not radioactive.&lt;ref&gt;For the material in this introductory section, see, e.g., Harrer and Beckerley, ''Nuclear Power Reactor Instrumentation Systems Handbook'', TID-25952-P1, NTIS (1973), Vol. 2  Section 13.6.2, {{ISBN|0-87079-005-6}}; Eisenbud, ''Environmental Radioactivity'', Academic (1973), p. 449; ''Assessment of Airborne Radioactivity'', International Atomic Energy Agency (1967), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The particulate radioactive material might be natural, e.g., radon decay products ("progeny", e.g., &lt;sup&gt;212&lt;/sup&gt;Pb), or manmade, usually fission or activation products (e.g., &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs), or a combination of both. There are also "gas monitors" which pass the air through a sample chamber volume which is viewed continuously by a [[radiation detector]]. [[Radionuclide]]s that occur in the gaseous form (e.g., &lt;sup&gt;85&lt;/sup&gt;[[Krypton|Kr]]) are not collected on the CPAM filter to any appreciable extent, so that a separate monitoring system is needed to assess these nuclide concentrations in the sampled air. These gas monitors are often placed downstream of a CPAM so that any particulate matter in the sampled air is collected by the CPAM and thus will not contaminate the gas monitor's sample chamber.

=== Monitoring vs. sampling ===

In '''monitoring''', the region of deposition of this material onto the filter medium is ''continuously'' viewed by a radiation detector, concurrent with the collection. This is as opposed to a '''sampling''' system'','' in which the airborne material is collected by pumping air, usually at a much higher [[volumetric flow]]rate than a CPAM, through a collection medium for some period of time, but there is no continuous radiation detection; the filter medium is removed ''periodically'' from the sampler and taken to a separate radiation detection system for analysis.

In general, sampling has better detection sensitivity for low levels of airborne radioactivity, due to the much larger total volume of air passing through the filter medium over the sampling interval (which may be on the order of hours), and also due to the more sophisticated forms of quantitative analysis available once the filter medium is removed from the sampler. On the other hand, monitoring with CPAMs provides nearly real-time airborne radioactivity level indication. It is common practice to refer to "sampled" air even when discussing a CPAM, i.e., as opposed to "monitored" air, which would, strictly, be more correct.

== CPAM types ==

There are two major types of CPAMs, fixed-filter and moving-filter. In the former, the filter medium does not move while the airborne material is collected. The latter type has two main variants, the rectangular deposition area (“window”) and the circular window. In both types of CPAM the sampled air is pulled (not pushed) by a pump through the piping of the monitor up to the structure that holds the filter medium. It is important to note that CPAM pumps are specially designed to maintain a constant volumetric flowrate.

As the air passes through the collection medium (usually a form of [[filter paper]]), particulate matter is deposited onto the filter in either a rectangular or circular pattern, depending on the instrument's design, and then the air continues on its way out of the monitor. The ''entire'' deposition area, regardless of its geometric shape, is assumed to be viewed by a radiation detector of a type appropriate for the nuclide in question.

Moving-filter monitors are often used in applications where loading of the filter medium with dust is an issue; this dust loading reduces the air flow over time. The moving-filter collection medium (“tape”) is assumed to move across the deposition area at a constant, known rate. This rate is often established in such a way that a roll of the filter tape will last about one month; a typical filter movement rate is about one inch per hour.

The rectangular-window moving filter monitor will be denoted as RW, and the circular, CW. Fixed filter is FF.

== CPAM applications==

===Effluent monitoring ===

CPAMs are used to monitor the air effluents from nuclear facilities, notably power reactors. Here the objective is to assess the amount of certain radionuclides released from the facility.&lt;ref&gt;ANSI 42.18-2004, ''Specification and Performance of On-Site Instrumentation for Continuously Monitoring Radioactivity in Effluents''&lt;/ref&gt; Real-time measurement of the very low concentrations released by these facilities is difficult; a more-reliable measurement of the ''total'' radioactivity released over some time interval (days, perhaps weeks) may in some cases be an acceptable approach.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, W. C., "Quantitative Assessment of Time-Varying Rb-88 Using Continuous Air Monitors", ''Trans. Am. Nucl. Soc.'','''24''' (1976), p. 129 [http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?query_id=0&amp;page=0&amp;osti_id=7328773]&lt;/ref&gt; In effluent monitoring, a sample of the air in the plant stack is withdrawn and pumped (pulled) down to the CPAM location. This sampled air in many cases must travel a considerable distance through piping. Extracting and transporting the particulates for the CPAM to measure in such a way that the measurement is representative of what is being released from the facility is challenging.&lt;ref&gt;ANSI 13.1-1999, ''Sampling and Monitoring Releases of Airborne Radioactive Substances from the Stacks and Ducts of Nuclear Facilities''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the USA there are effluent monitoring requirements in both [[Code of Federal Regulations|10CFR20 and 10CFR50]]; Appendix B to the former and Appendix I to the latter are especially important. 10CFR50 Appendix A&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part050/part050-appa.html 10CFR50 Appendix A]&lt;/ref&gt; states:

::Criterion 64--Monitoring radioactivity releases. Means shall be provided for monitoring the reactor containment atmosphere, spaces containing components for recirculation of loss-of-coolant accident fluids, '''effluent discharge paths''', and the plant environs for radioactivity that may be released from normal operations, including anticipated operational occurrences, and from postulated accidents.

Also in the USA, Regulatory Guide 1.21, ''Measuring, Evaluating, and Reporting Radioactivity in Solid Wastes and Releases of Radioactive Materials in Liquid and Gaseous Effluents from Light-Water-Cooled Nuclear Power Plants''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/reg-guides/power-reactors/active/ Regulatory Guide 1.21]&lt;/ref&gt; is highly relevant to this CPAM application.

=== Occupational exposure assessment ===

For occupational exposure (inhalation) assessment, CPAMs may be used to monitor the air in some volume, such as a compartment in a nuclear facility where personnel are working.&lt;ref&gt;ANSI 42.17B-1989, ''Performance Specifications for Health Physics Instrumentation- Occupational Airborne Radioactivity Monitoring Instrumentation''&lt;/ref&gt; A difficulty with this is that, unless the air in the compartment is uniformly mixed, the measurement made at the monitor location may not be representative of the concentration of radioactive material in the air that the workers are breathing. For this application the CPAM may be physically placed directly in the occupied compartment, or it may extract sampled air from the HVAC system that serves that compartment.
The following portions of 10CFR20&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part020/ 10CFR20]&lt;/ref&gt; are relevant to the requirement for occupational exposure CPAM applications in the USA: 10CFR20.1003 (definition of Airborne Radioactivity Area), 1201, 1204, 1501, 1502, 2103.

=== Process monitoring and control ===

Radiation monitors in general have a number of process-control applications in nuclear power plants;&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Harrer and Beckerley, Chapters 13, 16&lt;/ref&gt; a major CPAM application in this area is the monitoring of the air intake for the plant control room. In the event of an accident, high levels of airborne radioactivity could be brought into the control room by its HVAC system; the CPAM monitors this air and is intended to detect high concentrations of radioactivity and shut down the HVAC flow when necessary.

For use in the USA, standard 10CFR50 Appendix A states:
::Criterion 19--Control room. A control room shall be provided from which actions can be taken to operate the nuclear power unit safely under normal conditions and to maintain it in a safe condition under accident conditions, including loss-of-coolant accidents. '''Adequate radiation protection shall be provided to permit access and occupancy of the control room under accident conditions without personnel receiving radiation exposures in excess of 5 rem whole body, or its equivalent to any part of the body, for the duration of the accident.''' Equipment at appropriate locations outside the control room shall be provided (1) with a design capability for prompt hot shutdown of the reactor, including necessary instrumentation and controls to maintain the unit in a safe condition during hot shutdown, and (2) with a potential capability for subsequent cold shutdown of the reactor through the use of suitable procedures.

This defines a requirement for monitoring the air intake for the control room, such that the exposure limits, including for inhalation exposure, shall not be exceeded. CPAMs are often used for this.

=== Reactor leak detection ===

Leakage from the so-called "reactor coolant pressure boundary" is required to be monitored in USA nuclear power plants.&lt;ref&gt;Regulatory Guide 1.45 Reactor Coolant Pressure Boundary Leakage Detection Systems, USNRC [https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/reg-guides/power-reactors/active/]&lt;/ref&gt; Monitoring the airborne particulate radioactivity in the reactor containment structure is an acceptable method to meet this requirement, and so CPAMs are used. It is the case that when primary coolant escapes into the containment structure, certain noble gas nuclides become airborne, and subsequently decay into particulate nuclides. One of the most common of these pairs is &lt;sup&gt;88&lt;/sup&gt;Kr and &lt;sup&gt;88&lt;/sup&gt;Rb; the latter is detected by the CPAM. Relating the observed CPAM response to the &lt;sup&gt;88&lt;/sup&gt;Rb back to a leakage rate from the primary system is far from trivial.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, W. C., "Concentration Dynamics Modeling for Continuous Particulate Air Monitor Response Prediction", ''IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science'', '''49''', 5, Oct 2002 [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1046926]&lt;/ref&gt;

The regulatory basis for this CPAM application is found in 10CFR50:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part050 10CFR50]&lt;/ref&gt;

For use in the USA, standard 10 CFR 50, Appendix A, "General Design Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants," Criterion 30, "Quality of reactor coolant pressure boundary," requires that means be provided for detecting and, to the extent practical, identifying the location of the source of reactor coolant leakage. The specific attributes of the reactor coolant leakage detection systems are outlined in Regulatory Positions 1 through 9 of Regulatory Guide 1.45.

For use in the USA, standard 10 CFR 50.36, "Technical Specifications," paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A), specifies that a Limiting Condition for Operation be established for installed instrumentation that is used to detect and indicate in the control room a significant abnormal degradation of the reactor coolant pressure boundary. This instrumentation is required by Specification 3.4.15, "RCS Leakage Detection Instrumentation."

Step changes in reactor coolant leakage can be detected with moving filter media to satisfy the quantitative requirements of USNRC Regulatory Guide 1.45. [See description for US Patent Number 5343046 (1994).] The mathematical method is highly detailed and it focuses on time-dependent viewable collected activity, rather than concentration, as f(t). The method, among other features, yields the desired fixed-filter degenerate case (filter paper velocity = 0.) The method was first put into use in the 1990s at a nuclear power plant in the United States. Though originally derived for dominant Kr-88/Rb-88 in leaked reactor coolant, it has been expanded to include Xe-138/Cs-138 and can be modified by replication to include any N similar pairings. Further refinements to the mathematical methodology have been made by the inventor; these developments obviate the described patented collimator apparatus for making quantitative assessment of leak rate step change when rectangular collection grids are employed.

=== Some CPAM application considerations ===

==== Importance of nuclide half-life ====
The response of the monitor is sensitive to the [[half-life]] of the nuclide being collected and measured. It is useful to define a "long-lived" (LL) nuclide to have negligible decay during the measurement interval. On the other hand, if the decay cannot be ignored, the nuclide is considered "short-lived" (SL). In general, for the monitor response models discussed below, the LL response can be obtained from the SL response by taking limits of the SL equation as the decay constant approaches zero. If there is any question about which response model to use, the SL expressions will ''always'' apply; however, the LL equations are considerably simpler and so should be used when there is no question about the half-life (e.g., &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs is LL).

==== Ratemeter ====
The output of the radiation detector is a random sequence of pulses, usually processed by some form of "ratemeter," which continuously estimates the rate at which the detector is responding to the radioactivity deposited on the filter medium. There are two fundamental types of ratemeters, analog and digital. The ratemeter output is called the [[counts per minute|countrate]], and it varies with time.

Ratemeters of both types have the additional function of "smoothing" the output countrate estimate, i.e., reducing its variability. (This process is more correctly termed "filtering.") Ratemeters must make a tradeoff between this necessary variance reduction and their response time; a smooth output (small variance) will tend to lag behind an increase in the true pulse rate.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner and Ely, ''Radioisotope Measurement Applications in Engineering'', Reinhold (1967), pp. 274-279&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of this lag depends on the application of the monitor.

==== Ambient background ====
Even when the filter medium is clean, that is, before the pump is started that pulls the air through the filter, the detector will respond to the ambient "background" radiation in the vicinity of the monitor. The countrate that results from deposited radioactivity is called the "net" countrate, and is obtained by subtracting this background countrate from the dynamically-varying countrate that is observed once the pump is started. The background is usually assumed to be constant.

==== Integration time ====
The countrate of the monitor varies dynamically, so that a measurement time interval must be specified. Also, these are integrating devices, meaning that some finite time is required to accumulate radioactivity onto the filter medium. The input to the monitor is, in general, a time-dependent concentration in air of the specified nuclide. However, for the calculations given below, this concentration will be held constant over that interval.

==== Constant-concentration time limitation ====
Since concentrations resulting from physical events tend to vary with time, due to dilution processes and/or a nonconstant source term (airborne radioactivity emission rate), it is not realistic to hold the concentration constant for significant lengths of time. Thus, measurement intervals on the order of several hours are not plausible for the purposes of these calculations.

==== Parent-progeny; RnTn ====
There are situations in which a nuclide deposited on the CPAM filter decays into another nuclide, and that second nuclide remains on the filter. This "parent-progeny" or decay chain situation is especially relevant to so-called [[Radon|"radon-thoron"]] (RnTn) or natural airborne radioactivity. The mathematical treatment described in this article does not consider this situation, but it can be treated using matrix methods (see Ref [11]).

==== Multiple nuclides; superposition ====
Another issue is the fact that in a power reactor context it would be unusual for a CPAM to be collecting only a single particulate nuclide; more likely there would be a mixture of [[fission product]] and [[activation product]] nuclides. The modeling discussed in this article considers only one nuclide at a time. However, since the radiation emitted by each nuclide is independent of the others, so that the nuclides present on the filter medium do not interact with each other, the monitor response is the linear combination of the individual responses. Thus the overall CPAM response to a mixture is just the superposition (i.e., the sum) of the individual responses.

==== Detector type ====
CPAMs use either a [[Geiger counter|Geiger tube]], for "gross [[Beta particle|beta]]-[[Gamma ray|gamma]]" counting, or a NaI(Tl) crystal, often for simple single-channel [[gamma spectroscopy]]. (In this context, "gross" means a measurement that does not attempt to find the specific nuclides in the sample.) [[Plastic scintillator]]s are also popular. Essentially, in power reactor applications, beta and gamma are the radiations of interest for particulate monitoring.

In other fuel-cycle applications, such as [[nuclear reprocessing]], [[Alpha particle|alpha]] detection is of interest. In those cases, the interference from other isotopes such as RnTn is a major problem, and more sophisticated analysis, such as the use of [[Semiconductor detector|HPGe]] detectors and multichannel analyzers, are used where spectral information, such as is used for Radon compensation, is required.

[[Iodine-131|Radioiodine]] (especially &lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I) monitoring is often done using a particulate-monitor setup, but with an [[Activated carbon|activated charcoal]] collection medium, which can adsorb some iodine vapors as well as particulate forms. Single-channel spectroscopy is usually specified for iodine monitors.

== Dynamic response of CPAMs ==
Detailed mathematical models that describe the dynamic, time-dependent countrate response of these monitors in a very general manner are presented in&lt;ref&gt;Evans, W. C., “Mathematical Models for the Dynamic Response of Continuous Particulate Air Monitors,” ''IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science'', '''48''', 2, April 2001 [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=915366]&lt;/ref&gt; and will not be repeated here. For the purpose of this article, a few useful results from that paper will be summarized. The objective is to predict the net countrate of a CPAM for a single, specific manmade nuclide, for a given set of conditions. That predicted response can be compared to the expected background and/or interferences (nuclides other than the one sought), to assess the monitor’s detection capability. The response predictions can also be used to calculate alarm setpoints that correspond to appropriate limits (such as those in 10CFR20) on the concentration of airborne radioactivity in the sampled air.

=== Model parameters ===
The parameters used in these models are summarized in this list:

*'''Time interval''' (''t''); time; measured from start of concentration step
*'''Concentration''' (''Q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''); activity / volume; assumed constant over the interval
*'''Decay constant''' (''λ''); 1 / time; for the specified nuclide
*'''Media collection/retention efficiency''' (''φ''); implicitly includes line loss
*'''Window length or radius''' (''L'' or ''R''); length; consistent units with ''v''
*'''Filter speed''' (''v''); length / time; length has same units as ''L'' or ''R''
*'''Flow rate''' (''F&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''); volume / time; assumed constant over the interval
*'''Detection efficiency''' (''ε''); counts / disintegration; implicitly includes emission abundance

"Line loss" refers to the losses of particulate matter in transit from a sampling point to the monitor; thus the concentration measured would be somewhat lower than that in the original sampled air. This factor is meant to compensate for these losses. Sampling lines are specifically designed to minimize these losses, for example, by making bends gradual as opposed to right-angled.&lt;ref&gt;See Ref [4]&lt;/ref&gt; These lines (pipes) are needed since in many applications the CPAM cannot be physically located directly in the sampled air volume, such as a nuclear power plant's main stack, or the ventilation air intake for the plant control room.

"Emission abundance" refers to the fact that the disintegration of any given nucleus of the isotope of interest in the CPAM analysis may not result in the emission of the radiation being detected (e.g., a beta particle or gamma ray). Thus, overall there will be some fraction of the disintegrations that emit the radiation of interest (e.g. the 662 keV gamma ray of &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs is emitted in about 85% of the disintegrations of &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs nuclei).

=== Fixed-filter model ===
The response models are based on the consideration of the sources and losses of the deposited radioactivity on the filter medium. Taking the simplest case, the FF monitor, this leads to a [[Ordinary differential equation|differential equation]] which expresses the rate of change of the monitor countrate:&lt;ref&gt;Ref [14], p. 203 and references therein&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
{{d\dot C_{FF} } \over {dt}}\,\,\, = \,\,\,\varepsilon \,k\,F_m \,\phi \,Q(t)\,\, - \,\,\lambda \,\dot C_{FF}&lt;/math&gt;
The first term accounts for the source of radioactivity from the sampled air, and the second term is the loss due to the decay of that radioactivity. A convenient way to express the solution to this equation uses the scalar convolution integral, which results in
:&lt;math&gt;
\dot C_{FF} (t)\,\, = \,\,\varepsilon \,k\,F_m \,\phi \,\,\exp \left( { - \lambda \,t} \right)\,\,\int_0^t {Q(\tau )\,\,\exp (\lambda \tau )\,d\tau \,\,\, + \,\,\,\dot C_0 \exp \left( { - \lambda \,t} \right)}&lt;/math&gt;

The last term accounts for any initial activity on the filter medium, and is usually set to zero (clean filter at time zero). The initial countrate of the monitor, before the concentration transient begins, is only that due to ambient background. If radon progeny are present, they are assumed to be at equilibrium and generating a constant countrate that adds to the ambient background’s countrate.

Various solutions for the time-dependent FF countrate follow directly, once a concentration time-dependence ''Q(t)'' has been specified. Note that the monitor flowrate ''F&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' is assumed constant; if it isn't, and its time-dependence is known, then that ''F&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;(t)'' would need to be placed inside the integral. Also note that the time variable in all the models is measured from the instant the concentration in the sampled air begins to increase.

=== Moving-filter models ===
[[Image:CircContours.png|thumb|Circular-window moving filter monitor; deposited radioactivity isoactivity contours, after transit time, constant input concentration.]]For the moving-filter CPAMs, the above expression is a starting point, but the models are considerably more complicated, due to (1) the loss of material as the filter medium moves away from the detector's field of view and (2) the differing lengths of time that parts of the filter medium have been exposed to the sampled air. The basic modeling approach is to break down the deposition regions into small differential areas and then consider how long each such area receives radioactive material from the air.

The resulting expressions are integrated across the deposition region to find the overall response. The RW solution consists of two double integrals, while the CW response solution consists of three triple integrals. A very important consideration in these models is the "transit time," which is the time required for a differential area to traverse the window along its longest dimension. As a practical matter, the transit time is the time required for ''all'' differential elements that were in the deposition window at time zero to leave the window.

This figure shows contours of constant activity on a CW deposition area, after the transit time has expired. The filter moves from left to right, and the activity increases from left to right. The differential areas on the diameter have been in the deposition window the longest, and at the far right, have been in the window, accumulating activity, for the full transit time.

Finally, to illustrate the complexity of these models, the RW response for time less than the transit time is&lt;ref&gt;Ref [14], p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\dot C_{RW} (t)\,\,\, = \,\,\,{{\varepsilon \,k\,F_m \,\phi \,\,\exp \left( { - \lambda \,t} \right)} \over L}\left[ {\int_0^{v\,t} {\int_{t\, - \,\left( {{x \over v}} \right)}^t {Q(\tau )\exp (\lambda \,\tau )\,d\tau \,dx\,\,\, + \,\,\,\int_{v\,t}^L {\int_0^t {Q(\tau )\exp (\lambda \,\tau )\,d\tau \,dx} } } } } \right]&lt;/math&gt;
and, also, one of the CW triple integrals is superimposed on the contour plot.

== Selected CPAM response models: constant concentration ==
In these equations, ''k'' is a conversion constant for units reconciliation. Again, a very important parameter for moving-filter monitors is the “transit time” (''T''), which is the window length (or diameter) divided by the filter tape speed ''v''. The countrate is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\dot C&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Fixed-filter (FF), any half-life ===

::&lt;math&gt;\dot C_{FF} (t) = \varepsilon \,k\,F_m \,\phi \,Q_0 {{1\,\,\, - \,\,\exp ( - \lambda \,t)} \over \lambda }&lt;/math&gt;

=== Fixed-filter (FF), long-lived (LL) ===

::&lt;math&gt;\dot C_{FF} (t) = \varepsilon \,k\,F_m \,\phi \,Q_0 \,t&lt;/math&gt;

=== Rectangular window (RW), time less than transit time T, any half-life ===

::&lt;math&gt;

\dot C_{RW} (t)\,\,\, = \,\,\,{{\varepsilon \,k\,F_m \,\phi \,Q_0 } \over {\lambda ^2 }}{v \over L}\left[ {\lambda \,t\,\, - \,\,1\,\, + \,\,\exp ( - \lambda \,t)} \right]\,\,\, + \,\,\,{{\varepsilon \,k\,F_m \,\phi \,Q_0 } \over \lambda }\left( {1 - {{v\,t} \over L}} \right)\left[ {1\,\, - \,\,\exp ( - \lambda \,t)} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

=== Rectangular window (RW), time less than transit time T, LL ===

::&lt;math&gt;\dot C_{RW} (t)\,\,\, = \,\,\,\varepsilon \,k\,F_m \,\phi \,Q_0 \left( {t\,\, - \,\,{{v\,t^2 } \over {2L}}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

::Note that as ''v'' approaches zero, these RW equations reduce to the FF solutions.

=== Rectangular window (RW), time greater than or equal to transit time T, any half-life ===

::&lt;math&gt;

\dot C_{RW} (t)\,\,\, = \,\,\,\varepsilon \,k\,F_m \,\phi \,Q_0 \,\,\left\{ {{1 \over \lambda }\,\,\, - \,\,\,{v \over {\lambda ^2 L}}\left[ {1\,\,\, - \,\,\,\exp \left( { - \lambda {L \over v}} \right)} \right]\,} \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Rectangular window (RW), time greater than or equal to transit time T, LL ===

::&lt;math&gt;\dot C_{RW} (t)\,\,\, = \,\,\,\varepsilon \,k\,F_m \,\phi \,Q_0 \,{L \over {2\,v\,}}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Circular window (CW) responses ===

::These response-model equations are quite complicated and some involve a [[nonelementary integral]]; the exact solutions can be found here.&lt;ref&gt;Ref [14], pp. 211-212&lt;/ref&gt; It is shown here,&lt;ref&gt;Ref [14], pp. 208-209&lt;/ref&gt; however, that a reasonable approximation for predicting the CW response can be obtained by using the RW equations above, with an “adjusted” window length  ''L&lt;sub&gt;CW&lt;/sub&gt;  ''used in each occurrence of the parameter ''L'', except that the CW transit time T&lt;sub&gt;CW&lt;/sub&gt; is found from 2R / v, ''not'' from using L&lt;sub&gt;CW&lt;/sub&gt; as given here in the T&lt;sub&gt;RW&lt;/sub&gt; relation L / v. Thus,

:::&lt;math&gt;L_{CW}  = \,\,{{16\,R} \over {3\,\pi }}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,T_{CW} \,\, = \,\,{{2R} \over v}\,\,\,\, \ne \,\,\,{{L_{CW} } \over v}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,T_{RW}  = \,\,{L \over v}&lt;/math&gt;

== Example CPAM response plots ==
[[Image:ConstantQLL5-1.jpg|thumb|left|CPAM responses, constant concentration of LL activity. Transit time 120 min.]]

[[Image:ConstantQSL5.jpg|thumb|CPAM responses, constant concentration of SL activity (Rb-88). Transit time 120 min.]]

These plots show the predicted CPAM countrate responses for these parameter settings: Detection efficiency, 0.2; Flowrate, 5 cubic feet per minute (cfm); Collection efficiency, 0.7; Constant concentration, 1E-09 &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;Ci/cc; Rectangular window length, 2&amp;nbsp;inches; Circular window radius, 1&amp;nbsp;inch; Media (tape) speed, 1&amp;nbsp;inch/hour. The concentration instantly steps up to its constant value when the time reaches 30 minutes, and there is a 100 count per minute (cpm) constant background. Note: A [[Curie|microcurie]] (&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;Ci) is a measure of the disintegration rate, or activity, of a radioactive source; it is 2.22E06 disintegrations per minute.

In the LL plot, note that the FF countrate continues to increase. This is because there is no significant loss of radioactivity from the filter medium. The RW and CW monitors, on the other hand, approach a limiting countrate and the monitor response remains constant as long as the input concentration remains constant.

For the SL plot, all three monitor responses approach a constant level. For the FF monitor, this is due to the source and loss terms becoming equal; since &lt;sup&gt;88&lt;/sup&gt;Rb has a half-life of about 18 minutes, the loss of radioactive material from the filter medium is significant. This loss also happens on the RW and CW monitors, but there, the loss due to the filter movement also plays a role.

In both plots, [[Poisson distribution|Poisson]] "noise" is added and a constant-gain [[digital filter]] is applied, emulating the countrate responses as they would be observed on a modern CPAM. The horizontal dotted lines are the limiting countrates calculated from the equations given in the previous section.

Also in both plots the transit times are indicated; note that these times are measured from the ''start of the concentration,'' at time 30 minutes, ''not'' from the arbitrary time zero of the plots. In these example graphs, the length of the RW and the diameter of the CW are equal; if they were not equal, then the transit times would not be equal.

== The inverse problem: estimating a concentration from the observed response ==

Having mathematical models that can predict the CPAM response, i.e., the monitor's output, for a defined input (airborne radioactive material concentration), it is natural to ask whether the process can be "inverted." That is, given an observed CPAM ''output'', is it possible to estimate the ''input'' to the monitor?

=== A misleading "quantitative method" for moving-filter CPAMs ===
A number of approaches to this inverse problem are addressed in detail in.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, W. C., "Quantitative Methods for Continuous Particulate Air Monitoring", ''IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science'', '''48''', 5, October 2001 [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=960352]&lt;/ref&gt; Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, as one might expect, and a method that might work well for a fixed-filter monitor may be useless for a moving-filter monitor (or vice versa).

One important conclusion from this paper is that for all practical purposes ''moving-filter monitors are not usable for quantitative estimation of a time-dependent concentration''. The only moving-filter method that has been used historically involves a constant-concentration, LL assumption, which leads to the RW expression:
:&lt;math&gt;

\dot C_{RW}\,\,\, = \,\,\,\varepsilon \,k\,F_m \,\phi \,Q_0 {T \over {2\,}}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \Rightarrow \,\,\,\,\,\,\hat Q_0 \,\, = \,\,{{2\,v\,\dot C_{RW} } \over {\varepsilon \,k\,F_m \,\phi \,L}}&lt;/math&gt;

or for CW,

:&lt;math&gt;

\dot C_{CW} \,\, = \,\,\,\varepsilon \,k\,F_m \,\phi \,Q_0 {{8R} \over {3\,\pi \,v}}\,\,\,\,\,\, \Rightarrow \,\,\,\,\,\,\hat Q_0 \,\, = \,\,{{3\,\pi \,v\,\dot C_{CW} } \over {8R\,\varepsilon \,k\,F_m \,\phi }}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, a concentration estimate is available ''only after the transit time T has expired''; in most CPAM applications this time is on the order of several (e.g., 4) hours. Whether it is reasonable to assume that the concentration will stay constant for this length of time, and to further assume that only long-lived nuclides are present, is at least debatable, and it is arguable that in many practical situations these assumptions are not realistic.

For example, in power reactor leak detection applications, as mentioned in the first section of this article, CPAMs are used, and a primary nuclide of interest is &lt;sup&gt;88&lt;/sup&gt;Rb, which is far from long-lived (half-life 18 minutes). Also, in the dynamic environment of a reactor containment building the &lt;sup&gt;88&lt;/sup&gt;Rb concentration would not be expected to remain constant on a time scale of hours, as required by this measurement method.

However, realistic or not, it has for decades been the practice of CPAM vendors to provide a set of curves (graphs) based on the expressions above.&lt;ref&gt;Ref [20], p. 1640&lt;/ref&gt; Such graphs have concentration on the vertical axis, and net countrate on the horizontal axis. There often is a family of curves, parameterized on the detection efficiency (or labeled as to specific nuclides). The implication in providing these graphs is that one is to observe a net countrate, at any time, enter the graph at this value, and read off the concentration that exists at that time. To the contrary, unless the time is greater than the transit time T, the nuclide of interest is long-lived, and the concentration is constant over the entire interval, this process will lead to incorrect concentration estimates.

=== Quantitative methods for CPAM applications ===
As discussed in the referenced paper, there are at least 11 possible quantitative methods for estimating the concentration or quantities derived from it. The "concentration" may only be at a specific time, or it might be an average over some time interval; this averaging is perfectly acceptable in some applications. In a few cases, the time-dependent concentration itself can be estimated. These various methods involve the countrate, the [[time derivative]] of the countrate, the time integral of the countrate, and various combinations of these.

The countrate is, as mentioned above, developed from the raw detector pulses by either an analog or digital ratemeter. The integrated counts are easily obtained simply by accumulating the pulses in a "scaler" or, in more modern implementations, in software. Estimating the rate of change (time derivative) of the countrate is difficult to do with any reasonable precision, but modern [[digital signal processing]] methods can be used to good effect.

It turns out that it is very useful to find the '''time integral''' of the concentration, as opposed to estimating the time-dependent concentration itself. It is essential to consider this choice for any CPAM application; in many cases the integrated concentration is not only more useful in a [[Health physics|radiological protection]] sense, but is also more readily accomplished, since estimating a concentration in (more or less) real-time is difficult.

For example, the total activity released from a plant stack over a time interval &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;R_{stack} \left( \eta  \right)\,\,\, = \,\,\,\int_0^\eta  {Q(\tau )\,F_{stack} (\tau )\,d\tau }&lt;/math&gt;

Then, for a fixed-filter monitor, assuming a constant stack and monitor flowrate, it can be shown that&lt;ref&gt;Ref [20], p. 1645; also see Ref [3]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;

R_{stack} \left( \eta  \right)\,\,\, = \,\,\,{{F_{stack} \left[ {\dot C\left( \eta  \right)\,\,\, + \,\,\,\lambda \,\int_0^\eta  {\dot C\left( \tau  \right)\,\,d\tau } } \right]} \over {\varepsilon \,k\,F_m \,\phi }}&lt;/math&gt;

so that the release is a function of  both the countrate and integrated counts. This approach was implemented at the [[Army Nuclear Power Program|SM-1 Nuclear Power Plant]] in the late 1960s, for estimating the releases of episodic [[Containment building|containment]] purges, with a predominant, and strongly time-varying, nuclide of &lt;sup&gt;88&lt;/sup&gt;Rb.&lt;ref&gt;Ref [3]&lt;/ref&gt; For a LL nuclide, the integral term vanishes, and the release depends only on the attained countrate. A similar equation applies for the occupational exposure situation, replacing the stack flowrate with a worker's breathing rate.

An interesting subtlety to these calculations is that the time in the CPAM response equations is measured from the ''start'' of a concentration transient, so that some method of detecting the resulting change in a noisy countrate must be developed. Again, this is a good application for statistical signal processing&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Basseville and Nikiforov, ''Detection of Abrupt Changes: Theory and Application'', Prentice-Hall (1993) {{ISBN|0-13-126780-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is made possible by the use of computing power in modern CPAMs.

Which of these 11 methods to use for the applications discussed previously is not especially obvious, although there are some candidate methods that logically would be used in some applications and not in others. For example, the response time of a given CPAM quantitative method may be far too slow for some applications, and perfectly reasonable for others. The methods have varying sensitivities (detection capabilities; how small a concentration or quantity of radioactivity can ''reliably'' be detected) as well, and this must enter into the decision.

=== CPAM calibration ===
The calibration of a CPAM usually includes: (1) choosing a quantitative method; (2) estimating the parameters needed to implement that method, notably the detection efficiency for specified nuclides, as well as the sampling line loss and collection efficiency factors; (3) estimating, under specified conditions, the background response of the instrument, which is needed for calculating the detection sensitivity. This sensitivity is often called the ''minimum detectable concentration'' or MDC, assuming that a concentration is the quantity estimated by the selected quantitative method.

What is of interest for the MDC is the variability (not the level) of the CPAM background countrate. This variability is measured using the [[standard deviation]]; care must be taken to account for  [[Unbiased estimation of standard deviation|bias]] in this estimate due to the [[autocorrelation]] of the sequential monitor readings. The autocorrelation bias can make the calculated MDC significantly ''smaller'' than is actually the case, which in turn makes the monitor appear to be capable of reliably detecting smaller concentrations than it in fact can.

An [[Experimental uncertainty analysis|uncertainty analysis]] for the estimated quantity (concentration, release, uptake) is also part of the calibration process. Other performance characteristics can be part of this process, such as estimating response time, estimating the effect of temperature changes on the monitor response, and so on.

The 2000s have seen the beginnings of the '''applications of nanotechnology''' in [[industrial applications of nanotechnology#Consumer goods|commercial products]], although most applications are limited to the bulk use of passive [[nanomaterials]].  Examples include [[titanium dioxide]] and [[zinc oxide]] [[nanoparticle]]s in sunscreen, cosmetics and some food products; [[silver nanoparticles]] in food packaging, clothing, disinfectants and household appliances such as [[Silver Nano]]; [[carbon nanotube]]s for stain-resistant textiles; and cerium oxide as a fuel catalyst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nanotechnology Information Center: Properties, Applications, Research, and Safety Guidelines|url=http://www.americanelements.com/nanotech.htm|publisher=[[American Elements]]|accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 10, 2011, the [[Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies]] estimated that over 1300 manufacturer-identified nanotech products are publicly available, with new ones hitting the market at a pace of 3–4 per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2008 |url=http://www.nanotechproject.org/inventories/consumer/analysis_draft/ |publisher=The Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies |title=Analysis: This is the first publicly available on-line inventory of nanotechnology-based consumer products |accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nanotechnology is being used in developing countries to help treat disease and prevent health issues. The umbrella term for this kind of nanotechnology is [[Nanomedicine]].

Nanotechnology is also being applied to or developed for application to a variety of [[industrial applications of nanotechnology|industrial]] and purification processes. Purification and environmental cleanup applications include the [[desalination]] of water, [[nanofiltration|water filtration]], [[Nanotechnology in water treatment|wastewater treatment]], [[Groundwater remediation applications of nanotechnology|groundwater treatment]], and other [[nanoremediation]]. In industry, applications may include [[industrial applications of nanotechnology#Construction|construction materials]], [[industrial applications of nanotechnology#Military|military goods]], and nano-machining of nano-wires, nano-rods, few layers of graphene,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jayasena|first=Buddhika|author2=Subbiah  Sathyan|title=A novel mechanical cleavage method for synthesizing few-layer graphenes|journal=Nanoscale Research Letters|date=2011|volume=6|issue=95|doi=10.1186/1556-276X-6-95|url=http://www.nanoscalereslett.com/content/6/1/95|pmid=21711598|pmc=3212245|bibcode = 2011NRL.....6...95J }}&lt;/ref&gt; etc. Also, recently a new field arisen from the root of Nanotechnology is called Nanobiotechnology. Nanobiotechnology is the biology-based, application-oriented frontier area of research in the hybrid discipline of Nanoscience and biotechnology with an equivalent contribution.&lt;ref&gt;Raja muthuramalingam thangavelu et al (2016) Nanobiotechnological approach using plant rooting hormones synthesized silver nanoparticle as a “nanobullets” for the dynamic applications in horticulture -An in vitro and ex vitro study, Arabian Journal of chemistry,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.arabjc.2016.09.022  [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878535216301666]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Association for Manufacturing Technology''' ('''AMT''') is a [[trade association]] based in [[McLean, Virginia]], in the United States. It was founded as the National Machine Tool Builders' Association (NMTBA) in 1902.  It represents and promotes the interests of American providers of [[manufacturing]] machinery and equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.amtonline.org/AboutAMT|title= About AMT|accessdate=December 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AMT’s most visible activity is its management of the [[International Manufacturing Technology Show]] (IMTS), which is held on even-numbered years at [[McCormick Place]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.imts.com|title=IMTS Home Page|accessdate=December 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AMT is a committee-driven organization that services the manufacturing community through volunteer participation of its membership. Examples of activities fostered by the AMT include:

* Standardization of the taper used on Computer Numerically Controlled ([[CNC]]) [[milling machines]]. See [[Machine taper]] for a discussion of NMTB tapers.

'''Barrington Moore Jr.''' (12 May 1913 &amp;ndash; 16 October 2005)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/barrington-moore-515628.html Dennis Smith, "Obituary: Barrington Moore &amp;mdash; Author of a daring sociological classic"], ''[[The Independent]]'', 17 November 2005, 59.&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[political sociology|political sociologist]], and the son of forester [[Barrington Moore, Sr.|Barrington Moore]]. He is famous for his ''Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy: Lord and Peasant in the Making of the Modern World'' (1966), a comparative study of [[modernization]] in Britain, France, the United States, China, Japan, Russia, Germany, and India. His many other works include ''Reflections on the Causes of Human Misery'' (1972) and an analysis of rebellion, ''Injustice: the Social Basis of Obedience and Revolt'' (1978).

==Education and private life==
He graduated from [[Williams College]], [[Massachusetts]], where he received a thorough education in Latin and Greek and in history. He also became interested in [[political science]], and was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. In 1941, Moore obtained his Ph.D. in [[sociology]] from [[Yale University]].  He worked as a policy analyst for the government, in the  Office of Strategic Services [[Office of Strategic Services|(OSS)]] and at the Department of Justice. He met [[Herbert Marcuse]], a lifelong friend, and also his future wife, Elizabeth Ito, at the OSS.  His wife died in 1992. They had no children.

==Academic career==
His academic career began in 1945 at the [[University of Chicago]], in 1948 he went to [[Harvard University]], joining the ''Russian Research Center'' in 1951. He was emerited in 1979.  Moore published his first book, ''Soviet Politics'' in 1950 and ''Terror and Progress, USSR'' in 1954. In 1958 his book of six essays on methodology and theory, ''[[Political Power and Social Theory]]'', attacked the methodological outlook of 1950s [[social science]]. His students at Harvard included comparative social scientists [[Theda Skocpol]], and [[Charles Tilly]].

===Social origins of dictatorship and democracy===

Moore's groundbreaking work ''[[Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy]]'' (1966), was the cornerstone to what is now called [[comparative historical analysis]] in the social sciences. In that work he studied the conditions for the sociogenesis of [[Democracy|democratic]], [[Fascism|fascist]] and [[Communism|communist]] regimes, looking especially at the ways in which industrialization and the pre-existing agrarian regimes interacted to produce those different political outcomes. He drew particular attention to the violence which preceded the development of democratic institutions.

Moore lists five conditions for the development of Western-style democracy (through a "[[bourgeois revolution]]"):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Barrington |last=Moore,Jr. |authorlink=Barrington Moore, Jr. |title=Social origins of dictatorship and democracy: lord and peasant in the making of the modern world |edition=with a new foreword by Edward Friedman and James C. Scott |origyear=First published 1966 |year=1993 |publisher=[[Beacon Press]] |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-8070-5073-6 |page=430}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# the "development of a balance to avoid too strong a crown or too independent a landed aristocracy"
# a shift toward "an appropriate form of commercial agriculture"
# a "weakening of the landed aristocracy"
# the "prevention of an aristocratic-bourgeois coalition against the peasants and workers" [which would lead to fascism]
# a "revolutionary break with the past".

Moore's concern was the transformation of pre-industrial agrarian social relations into "modern" ones. He highlighted what he called "three routes to the modern world" - the liberal democratic, the fascist, and the communist - each deriving from the timing of industrialization and the social structure at the time of transition.

In the simplest sense, ''Social Origins'' can be summarized with his famous statement '''"No bourgeois, no democracy"'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Barrington |last=Moore,Jr. |authorlink=Barrington Moore, Jr. |title=Social origins of dictatorship and democracy: lord and peasant in the making of the modern world |edition=with a new foreword by Edward Friedman and James C. Scott |origyear=First published 1966 |year=1993 |publisher=[[Beacon Press]] |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-8070-5073-6 |page=418}}&lt;/ref&gt; though taking that idea at face value undercuts and misinterprets the nuances of his argument.
* In England, the effect of the "bourgeois impulse" was to change the attitudes of a portion of the landed elite towards commercial farming, leading to the destruction of the peasantry through the [[enclosure]] system and the [[English Civil War]] which led to an aristocratic, but moderate democracy.
* In France, the [[French Revolution]] did directly include the bourgeoisie, but it was the overwhelming influence of the peasantry that determined "just how far the revolution could go." The peasantry remained thereafter a reservoir of reactionary attitudes.
* In the United States, the industrial north's victory over the Southern planter elite in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] cemented the U.S. path to modernity through liberal democracy, but only after southern planters "acquired a tincture" of urban business - essentially changing their attitudes towards capitalist accumulation. The result, however, was that once this transformation took place, the Northern capitalists ended [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] and allowed the South to implement Jim Crow.

Moore also directly addressed the Japanese transition to modernity through fascism and the communist path in China, while implicitly remarking on Germany and Russia.
* For Moore, the influence of the bourgeoisie in Japan was significantly more limited than in England, France, and the U.S. Instead of the capitalist accumulation through the "bourgeois impulse" as it did in those three cases, Japan's late transition to industrial modernity was induced through "labor repressive" agriculture - squeezing the peasantry to generate the necessary capital for modernization. This "revolution from above" served to cement a reactionary alliance of a weak bourgeoisie and powerful landowners that culminated in [[fascism]].
*In China, the overwhelming strength of the peasantry vis-a-vis the bourgeoisie and the landed elites resulted in the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution]], but they were its first victims.  Here, the bourgeoisie allied with the peasants, and created a "revolution from below."  Moore criticized attempts by other sociologists to retroactively identify some kind of useful "function" served by the Chinese system of imperial government, and argued that the more likely reason for its prolonged survival was that most people, especially peasants, simply accept their social system "unless and until something happens to threaten and destroy their daily routine." 
One can see Moore's theme of the bourgeoisie again here - in the states that became democratic, there was a strong bourgeoisie. In Japan and China, the bourgeoisie was weak, and allied with the elites or peasants to create fascism or communism, respectively.

The wide range of critical response to ''Social Origins'' was examined by [[Jon Wiener]] in the journal ''History and Theory.'' &lt;ref&gt;Jon Wiener, "Review of Reviews: ''Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy''," ''History and Theory'' 15 (1976), 146-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

===On tolerance===
In 1965, Moore, Herbert Marcuse, and [[Robert Paul Wolff]] each authored an essay on the concept of [[Toleration|tolerance]] and the three essays were collected in the book ''[[A Critique of Pure Tolerance]]''. The title was a play on the title of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s book ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. In the book Moore argues that academic research and society in general should adopt a strictly [[scientific]] and [[secular]] outlook and approach theories and conjectures with empirical verification.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Barrington, [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Robert Paul Wolff]], ''A Critique of Pure Tolerance'' (Boston: Beacon Press, 1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

K.|title=Seismic Analysis of Structures|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-470-82462-7|page=369|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0HDSxdY4s20C&amp;pg=PA369}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a collection of structural elements which should substantially [[Coupling (physics)|decouple]] a [[superstructure]] from its substructure resting on a shaking ground thus protecting a [[building]] or [[non-building structure]]'s integrity.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqlXp3czrrM {{Unreliable source?|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Base isolation is one of the most powerful tools of [[earthquake engineering]] pertaining to the passive structural [[vibration control]] technologies. It is meant to enable a building or non-building structure to survive a potentially devastating [[seismic]] [[impact (mechanics)|impact]] through a proper initial design or subsequent modifications. In some cases, application of base isolation can raise both a structure's [[seismic performance]] and its [[seismic]] [[sustainability]] considerably. Contrary to popular belief base isolation does not make a building earthquake proof.

''Base isolation system'' consists of ''isolation units'' with or without ''isolation components'', where:

#''Isolation units'' are the basic elements of a ''base isolation system'' which are intended to provide the aforementioned [[Coupling (physics)|decoupling]] effect to a building or non-building structure.
#''Isolation components'' are the connections between ''isolation units'' and their parts having no decoupling effect of their own.

Isolation units could consist of shear or sliding units.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yXgu4aS8HE Lead Rubber Bearing being tested at the UCSD Caltrans-SRMD facility], YouTube{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfl-VueWTGE&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=660C7AFD70E81C12&amp;index=27 Hybrid Simulation of Base Isolated Structures], YouTube {{Unreliable source?|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This technology can be used for both new [[structural design]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siecorp.com/lfe/Projects/Seismic_Isolation/projects.html Seismic Isolation Projects in Japan]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[seismic retrofit]]. In process of [[seismic retrofit]], some of the most prominent U.S. monuments, e.g. [[Pasadena City Hall]], [[San Francisco City Hall]], [[Salt Lake City and County Building]] or [[LA City Hall]] were mounted on ''base isolation systems''.  It required creating rigidity [[Diaphragm (structural system)|diaphragms]] and [[moat]]s around the buildings, as well as making provisions against overturning and [[P-Delta Effect]].

Base isolation is also used on a smaller scale—sometimes down to a single room in a building. Isolated raised-floor systems are used to safeguard essential equipment against earthquakes. The technique has been incorporated to protect statues and other works of art—see, for instance, [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]]'s ''Gates of Hell'' at the [[National Museum of Western Art]] in [[Tokyo]]'s [[Ueno Park]].&lt;ref name=Reitherman&gt;{{cite book|last=Reitherman|first=Robert|title=Earthquakes and Engineers: An International History|year=2012|publisher=ASCE Press|location=Reston, VA|isbn=9780784410622|url=http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=25769807891&amp;productid=154097877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Through the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation ([[Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation|NEES]]), researchers are studying the performance of base isolation systems.&lt;ref name=TIPS_YouTube&gt;nees@berkeley project highlight: NEES TIPS Seismic Isolation Hybrid Simulation, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh6l5Jqtp0c&lt;/ref&gt; The project, a collaboration among researchers at [[University of Nevada, Reno]]; [[University of California, Berkeley]]; [[University of Wisconsin, Green Bay]]; and the [[University at Buffalo]] is conducting a strategic assessment of the economic, technical, and procedural barriers to the widespread adoption of seismic isolation in the United States. NEES resources have been used for experimental and numerical simulation, data mining, networking and collaboration to understand the complex interrelationship among the factors controlling the overall performance of an isolated structural system. This project involves [[earthquake shaking table]] and hybrid tests at the NEES experimental facilities at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University at Buffalo, aimed at understanding ultimate performance limits to examine the propagation of local isolation failures (e.g., bumping against stops, bearing failures, uplift) to the system level response. These tests will include a full-scale, three-dimensional test of an isolated 5-story steel building on the E-Defense shake table in Miki, Hyogo, Japan.&lt;ref name="BriefHistory"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://en.calameo.com/read/001671591369645c5959a | title=Base isolation: dalle origini ai giorni nostri | year=2013 | accessdate=October 7, 2013 | last1=Giovannardi | first1=Fausto |last2=Guisasola |first2=Adriana }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptive base isolation==
An adaptive base isolation system includes a tunable isolator that can adjust its properties based on the input to minimize the transferred vibration.

A '''beetle bank''', in [[agriculture]] and [[horticulture]], is a form of [[biological pest control]].  It is a strip planted with [[Poaceae|grass]]es ([[bunch grass]]es) and/or [[perennial plant]]s, within a crop field or a garden, that fosters and provides [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] for [[beneficial insect]]s, birds, and other fauna that prey on pests.

== Usage ==
Beetle banks are typically made up from plants such as [[sunflower]]s, ''[[Vicia faba]]'', ''[[Centaurea cyanus]]'', [[coriander]], [[borage]], ''[[Muhlenbergia]]'', ''[[Stipa]]'', and [[buckwheat]]s (''[[Eriogonum]] spp.''). Beetle banks are used to reduce or replace the use of [[insecticide]]s,&lt;ref name="connell-farmer"&gt;{{cite news |title= Connell organic farmer using 'beetle banks' |author= Kevin McCullen |url= http://www.seattletimes.com/life/lifestyle/connell-organic-farmer-using-beetle-banks/ |newspaper= Tri-City Herald |date= 14 June 2010 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can also serve as habitat for birds and beneficial rodents. For example, insects such as ''[[Chrysoperla carnea]]'' and the [[Ichneumon fly]] can prey on pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Felix Wäckers, Paul van Rijn and Jan Bruin | publisher=Cambridge University Press, UK, 2005 | year=2005 | title=Plant-Provided Food for Carnivorous Insects - a protective mutualism and its applications | ISBN =978-0-521-81941-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The concept was developed by the [[Game &amp; Wildlife Conservation Trust]] in collaboration with the [[University of Southampton]].

Other important benefits can be providing habitat for [[pollinator]]s and [[endangered species]]. If using local native plants, [[endemism|endemic]] and indigenous flora and fauna [[restoration ecology]] is supported.

== History of the term ==
According to a March 2005 draft entry for the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the term first came into use in the early 1990s, with published examples including the August 22, 1992 issue of the ''[[New Scientist]]'' and an October 12, 1994 reference in ''[[The Guardian]]'' society section:
:‘Beetle banks’, a recent initiative by the [[Game Conservancy Trust]], would also help encourage ground-nesting birds while creating cover for [[aphid]]-eating bugs with more pay-off in savings on aphicides.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12788">'''Biological augmentation''' is the addition of [[archaea]] or [[bacterial culture]]s required to speed up the rate of [[Biodegradation|degradation]] of a [[contaminant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Scientists Discover Analog for Extraterrestrial Life in Idaho Hot Spring|url = http://toxics.usgs.gov/highlights/archaea.html|website = toxics.usgs.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-11|first = David W.|last = Morganwalp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organisms that originate from contaminated areas may already be able to break down waste, but perhaps inefficiently and slowly.

Bioaugmentation usually requires studying the [[Endemic (ecology)|indigenous]] varieties present in the location to determine if [[biostimulation]] is possible. If the indigenous variety do not have the [[metabolic]] capability to perform the remediation process, [[exogenous]] varieties with such sophisticated pathways are introduced.

Bioaugmentation is commonly used in [[municipal wastewater]] [[wastewater treatment|treatment]] to restart activated sludge [[bioreactor]]s. Most cultures available contain microbial cultures, already containing all necessary microorganisms (''[[Bacillus licheniformis|B. licheniformis]]'', ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis|B. thuringiensis]]'', ''[[Paenibacillus polymyxa|P. polymyxa]]'', ''[[Bacillus stearothermophilus|B. stearothermophilus]]'', [[Penicillium|''Penicillium'' sp.]], [[Aspergillus sp.|''Aspergillus'' sp.]], ''[[Flavobacterium]]'', ''[[Arthrobacter]]'', ''[[Pseudomonas]]'', ''[[Streptomyces]]'', ''[[Saccharomyces]]'', ''Triphoderma'', etc.). Activated sludge systems are generally based on microorganisms like bacteria, protozoa, nematodes, rotifers, and fungi, which are capable of degrading biodegradable organic matter. There are many positive outcomes from the use of bioaugmentation, such as the improvement in efficiency and speed of the process of breaking down substances and the reduction of toxic particles in an area.
&lt;ref&gt;Huban, C.M. [Betz-Dearborn Inc., and R.D. [Sybron Chemicals Plowman, [http://www.osti.gov/scitech/biblio/455431#  "Bioaugmentation: Put Microbes to Work.” Chemical Engineering 104.3"], (1997): n. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soil remediation==
{{see|soil remediation}}
Bioaugmentation is favorable in contaminated soils that have undergone bioremediation, but still pose an environmental risk. This is because microorganisms that were originally in the environment did not accomplish their task during [[bioremediation]] when it came to breaking down chemicals in the [[contaminated soil]]. The failure of original bacteria can be caused by environmental stresses, as well as changes in the microbial population due to mutation rates. When microorganisms are added, they are potentially more suited to the nature of the new contaminant, meanwhile the older microorganisms are similar to the older pollution and contamination{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. However, this is merely one of many factors; site size is also a very important determinant. In order to see whether bioaugmentation should be implemented, the overall setting must be considered.  Also, some highly specialized microorganisms are not capable of adapting to certain site settings. Availability of certain microorganism types (as used for bioremediation) may also be a problem.  Although bioaugmentation may appear to be a perfect solution for contaminated soil, it can have drawbacks.  For example, the wrong type of bacteria can result in potentially clogged aquifers, or the remediation result may be incomplete or unsatisfactory.
&lt;ref name=vogel&gt;{{cite journal|author=Vogel, Timothy M.|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095816699680036X#|title=Bioaugmentation as a soil bioremediation approach|journal=Current Opinion in Biotechnology|volume=7|issue=3 |year=1996|pages=311–316|pmid=8785436|doi=10.1016/s0958-1669(96)80036-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bioaugmentation of chlorinated solvents==
At sites where soil and groundwater are contaminated with chlorinated ethenes, such as [[tetrachloroethylene]] and [[trichloroethylene]], bioaugmentation can be used to ensure that the ''in situ'' microorganisms can completely degrade these contaminants to [[ethylene]] and [[chloride]], which are non-toxic.  Bioaugmentation is typically only applicable to bioremediation of chlorinated ethenes, although there are emerging cultures with the potential to biodegrade other compounds including [[BTX (chemistry)|BTEX]], [[chloroethane]]s, [[chloromethane]]s, and [[methyl tert-butyl ether|MTBE]].  The first reported application of bioaugmentation for chlorinated ethenes was at [[Kelly Air Force Base]], TX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Major, D.W., M.L. McMaster, E.E. Cox, E.A. Edwards, S.M. Dworatzek, E.R. Hendrickson, M.G. Starr, J.A.  Payne, and L.W. Buonamici|year= 2002|title=Field Demonstration  of  Successful Bioaugmentation to Achieve Dechlorination of Tetrachloroethene to Ethene|journal=Environmental Science and Technology|volume=36|pages=5106–5116|doi=10.1021/es0255711}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioaugmentation is typically performed in conjunction with the addition of electron donor (biostimulation) to achieve geochemical conditions in groundwater that favor the growth of the dechlorinating microorganisms in the bioaugmentation culture.

==Niche fitness==
Including more microbes into an environment is beneficial to the speed of the cleanup duration. The interaction and competitions of two compounds influence the performance that a microorganism, original or new, could have. This can be tested by placing a soil that favors the new microbes into the area and then looking at the performance. The results will show if the new microorganism can perform well enough in that soil with other microorganisms. This helps to determine the correct amount of microbes and indigenous substances that are needed in order to optimize performance and create a co-metabolism. 	
'Bioaugmentation Cultures'''.&lt;ref name=vogel/&gt;

==Coke plant wastewater in China==
An example of how bioaugmentation has improved an environment, is in the [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] plant wastewater in China. [[Coal in China]] is used as a main energy source and the contaminated water contains harmful toxic contaminants like [[ammonia]], [[thiocyanate]], [[phenols]] and other organic compounds, such as mono- and [[Polycyclic compound|polycyclic]] nitrogen-containing [[aromatics]], oxygen and sulfur-containing [[heterocyclic]]s and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons. Previous measures to treat this problem was an aerobic-anoxic-oxic system, solvent extractions, stream stripping, and [[biological treatment]]. Bioaugmentation has been reported to remove 3-chlorobenzoate, 4-methyl benzoate, [[toluene]], [[phenol]], and [[chlorinated solvents]].

The anaerobic reactor was packed with semi-soft media, which were constructed by plastic ring and synthetic fiber string. The anoxic reactor is a completely mixed reactor while the oxic reactor is a hybrid bioreactor in which [[polyurethane]] foam carriers were added. Water from anoxic reactor, odic reactor and sedimentation tank were used and had mix-ins of different amount of old and developed microbes with .75 concentration and 28 degree Celsius. The rate of contaminant degradation depended on the amount of microbe concentration. In the enhanced microbial community indigenous microorganisms broke down the contaminants in the coke plant wastewater, such as [[pyridines]], and [[Phenols|phenolic]] compounds. When indigenous heterotrophic microorganisms were added, they converted many large molecular compounds into smaller and simpler compounds, which could be taken from more biodegradable organic compounds. This proves that bioaugmentation could be used as a tool for the removal of unwanted compounds that are not properly removed by conventional biological treatment system. When bioaugmentation is combined with A1–A2–O system for the treatment of coke plant wastewater it is very powerful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jianlong Wang ''et al.'' | year = 2002 | title = Bioaugmentation as a tool to enhance the removal of refractory compound in coke plant wastewater | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032959202002273 | journal = Process Biochemistry | volume = 38 | issue = 5| pages = 777–781 | doi=10.1016/S0032-9592(02)00227-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Petroleum cleanup==
In the [[petroleum industry]], there is a large problem with how oilfield drilling pit is disposed of. Many used to simply place dirt over the pit, but it is far more productive and economically beneficial to use bioaugmentation. With the use of advanced microbes, drilling companies can actually treat the problem in the oilfield pit instead of transferring the waste around. Specifically, [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] can be metabolized by some bacteria, which significantly reduces environmental damage from drilling activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Alex|last1=Fanelli|title=Bioaugmentation|url=http://www.soil-bio-remediation.com/products/|publisher=Soil Bioremediation|date=2016|access-date=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given suitable environmental conditions, microbes are placed in the oilpit to break down hydrocarbons and alongside are other nutrients. Before treatment there was a [[total petroleum hydrocarbon]] (TPH) level of 44,880 [[parts per million|ppm]], which within just 47 days the TPH was lowered to a level of 10,000 ppm to 6,486 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, T. P., [http://www.osti.gov/scitech/biblio/483721 "Bioaugmentation for the treatment of oilfield drilling waste."], ''PennWell Conferences and Exhibitions, Houston, TX (United States)'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Failures and potential solutions==
There have been many instances where bioaugmentation had deficiencies in its process. Examples include Goldstein et al., 1985;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Appl Environ Microbiol|year=1985|volume=50|issue=4|pages=977–83|title=Reasons for possible failure of inoculation to enhance biodegradation|author=Goldstein RM, Mallory LM, Alexander M.|pmid=4083891|pmc=291779}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephenson and Stephenson, 1992;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Biotechnol. Adv.|year=1992|volume=10|issue=4|pages=549–59|title=Bioaugmentation for enhancing biological wastewater treatment|author=Stephenson D, Stephenson T.|pmid=14543705|doi=10.1016/0734-9750(92)91452-k}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bouchez et al., 2000; Vogel and Walter, 2001; Wagner-Döbler, 2003. Many of these problems occurred because the [[microbial ecology]] issues were not taken into consideration in order to map the performance of the bioaugmentation. It is crucial to consider the microbes' ability to withstand the conditions in the microbial community to be placed in. In many of the cases that have failed, only the microbes' ability to break down compounds was considered and less their [[biological fitness|fitness]] in existing communities and the resulting competitive stress. It is better to identify the existing communities before looking at the strains needed to break down pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thompson Ian P.

A '''boiler explosion''' is a [[catastrophic failure]] of a [[boiler]].  As seen today, boiler explosions are of two kinds. One kind is a failure of the pressure parts of the [[steam]] and [[water]] sides. There can be many different causes, such as failure of the [[safety valve]], [[corrosion]] of critical parts of the boiler, or low water level. Corrosion along the edges of [[lap joint]]s was a common cause of early boiler explosions.

The second kind is a fuel/air explosion in the [[furnace]], which would more properly be termed a firebox explosion. Firebox explosions in solid-fuel-fired boilers are rare, but firebox explosions in gas or oil-fired boilers are still a potential hazard.

== Causes of boiler explosions ==
There are many causes for boiler explosions such as poor water treatment causing scaling and over heating of the plates, low water level, a stuck safety valve, or even a furnace explosion that in turn, if severe enough, can cause a boiler explosion. Poor operator training resulting in neglect or other mishandling of the boiler has been a frequent cause of explosions since the beginning of the industrial revolution. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the inspection records of various sources in the U.S., UK, and Europe showed that the most frequent cause of boiler explosions was weakening of boilers through simple rusting, by anywhere from 2 to 5 times more than all other causes.

Before materials science, inspection standards, and quality control caught up with the rapidly growing boiler manufacturing industry, a significant number of boiler explosions were directly traceable to poor design, workmanship, and undetected flaws in poor quality materials. The alarming frequency of boiler failures in the U.S. due to defects in materials and design were attracting the attention of international engineering standards organizations, such as [https://www.asme.org/about-asme/engineering-history the ASME], which established their first Boiler Testing Code in 1884.  The boiler explosion that caused the [[Grover Shoe Factory disaster]] in Brockton, Massachusetts on March 10, 1905 resulted in 58 deaths and 117 injuries, and inspired the state of Massachusetts to publish its first boiler laws in 1908.

Several written sources provide a concise description of the causes of boiler explosions:

''"The principal causes of explosions, in fact the only causes, are deficiency of strength in the shell or other parts of the boilers, over-pressure and over-heating. Deficiency of strength in steam boilers may be due to original defects, bad workmanship, deterioration from use or mismanagement."''&lt;ref&gt;Roper, Stephen (1899). ''Roper's Engineer's Handy Book'' (15th edition) Philadelphia: David McKay (p.207–208)&lt;/ref&gt;

''"Cause.-Boiler explosions are always due to the fact that some part of the boiler is, for some reason, too weak to withstand the pressure to which it is subjected. This may be due to one of two causes: Either the boiler is not strong enough to safely carry its proper working pressure, or else the pressure has been allowed to rise above the usual point by the sticking of the safety valves, or some similar cause"''&lt;ref&gt;The Colliery Engineers Company (1900) ''Locomotive Boilers'' (I.C.S. Reference Library #59) Statione's Hall, London: International Textbook Company&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early investigations into the causes of boiler explosions ==
While deterioration and mishandling are probably the most common ''causes'' of boiler explosions, the actual ''mechanism'' of a catastrophic boiler failure was not well documented until extensive experimentation was undertaken by U.S. boiler inspectors in the early 20th century. Several different attempts were made to cause a boiler to explode by various means, but one of the most interesting experiments demonstrated that in certain circumstances, if a sudden opening in the boiler allowed steam to escape too rapidly, [[water hammer]] could cause destruction of the entire pressure vessel:

''"A cylindrical boiler was tested and withstood a steam pressure of 300 pounds without injury." " When the [discharge] valve was suddenly opened at a pressure of 235 pounds the boiler gave way, the iron being twisted and torn into fragments and thrown in all directions. The reason for this was that the sudden rush of steam from the boiler into the discharge pipe reduced the pressure in the boiler very rapidly. This reduction of pressure caused the sudden formation of a great quantity of steam within the water, and the heavy mass of water being thrown with great violence toward the opening whence the steam was being withdrawn, struck the portions of the boiler near that opening and caused the fracture."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Colliery Engineers Company – Locomotive Boilers (I.C.S. Reference Library #59)|last=|first=|publisher=Stationer's Hall, London: International Textbook Company|year=1900|isbn=|location=|pages=(Sec.12-p.76)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boiler explosions are common in sinking ships once the superheated boiler touches cold sea water, as the sudden cooling of the superheated metal causes it to crack; for instance, when the ''[[SS Ben Lomond]]'' was torpedoed by a U-boat, the torpedoes and resulting boiler explosion caused the ship to go down in two minutes, leaving [[Poon Lim]] as the only survivor in a complement of 54 crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uboat.net/allies/merchants/2462.html|title=Benlomond (British Steam merchant) – Ships hit by German U-boats during WWII – uboat.net|website=uboat.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~judkins/survival.htm|title=Miracle Survival – Poon Lim|first=George|last=Judkins|website=freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Locomotive-type boiler explosions ==
Boiler explosions are of a particular danger in (locomotive-type) [[fire-tube boiler|fire tube boilers]] because the top of the firebox (crown sheet) must be covered with some amount of water at all times; or the heat of the fire can weaken the crown sheet or crown [[Boiler stay|stays]] to the point of failure, even at ''normal working pressure''.

This was the cause of the Gettysburg Railroad firebox explosion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ntsb.gov/safety/safety-studies/Documents/SIR9605.pdf|title=STEAM LOCOMOTIVE FIREBOX EXPLOSION ON THE GETTYSBURG RAILROAD NEAR GARDNERS, PENNSYLVANIA JUNE 16, 1995|last=NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; near Gardners, Pennsylvania in 1995, where low water allowed the front of the crown sheet to overheat until the regular crown stays pulled through the sheet, releasing a great deal of steam and water under full boiler pressure into the firebox. Fortunately, the crown sheet design included several alternating rows of button-head safety stays, which limited the failure of the crown sheet to the first 5 or 6 rows of conventional stays, preventing a collapse of the entire crown sheet.

However, this type of failure is not limited to railway engines, as locomotive-type boilers have been used for traction engines, portable engines, skid engines used for mining or logging, stationary engines for sawmills and factories, for heating, and as [[package boiler]]s providing steam for other processes. In all applications, maintaining the proper water level is essential for safe operation.

== Principle ==
Many shell-type boilers carry a large bath of liquid water which is heated to a higher temperature and pressure ([[enthalpy]]) than boiling water would be at atmospheric pressure. During normal operation, the liquid water remains in the bottom of the boiler due to gravity, steam bubbles rise through the liquid water and collect at the top for use until saturation pressure is reached, then the boiling stops. If some pressure is released, boiling begins again, and so on.

If steam is released normally, say by opening a throttle valve, the bubbling action of the water remains moderate and relatively dry steam can be drawn from the highest point in the vessel.

If steam is released more quickly, the more vigorous boiling action that results can throw a fine spray of droplets up as "wet steam" which can cause damage to piping, engines, turbines and other equipment downstream.

If a large crack or other opening in the boiler vessel allows the internal pressure to drop very suddenly, the heat energy remaining in the water will cause even more of the liquid to flash into steam bubbles, which then rapidly displace the remaining liquid. The potential energy of the escaping steam and water are now transformed into work, just as they would have done in an engine; with enough force to peel back the material around the break, severely distorting the shape of the plate which was formerly held in place by stays, or self-supported by its original cylindrical shape. The rapid release of steam and water can provide a very potent blast, and cause great damage to surrounding property or personnel.

The rapidly expanding steam bubbles can also perform work by throwing large "slugs" of water inside the boiler in the direction of the opening, and at astonishing velocity. A fast-moving mass of water carries a great deal of kinetic energy (from the expanding steam), and in collision with the shell of the boiler results in a violent destructive effect. This can greatly enlarge the original rupture, or tear the shell in two.&lt;ref&gt;The Colliery Engineers Company (1900) Locomotive Boilers (I.C.S. Reference Library #59) Stationer's Hall, London: International Textbook Company (sec.12,p.76)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[plumber]]s and [[steamfitter]]s are aware of this phenomenon, which is called  "[[water hammer]]". A few ounce "slug" of water passing through a steam line at high velocity and striking a 90 degree elbow can instantly fracture a fitting that is otherwise capable of handling several times the normal static pressure. It can then be understood that a few hundred, or even a few thousand pounds of water ''moving at the same velocity'' inside a boiler shell can easily blow out a tube sheet, collapse a firebox, even toss the entire boiler a surprising distance through reaction as the water exits the boiler, like the [[recoil]] of a heavy cannon firing a ball.

Several accounts of the [[SL-1]] [[SL-1|experimental reactor accident]] vividly describe the incredibly powerful effect of water hammer on a pressure vessel: "''The expansion caused by this heating process caused [[water hammer]] as water was accelerated upwards toward the reactor vessel head, producing approximately 10,000 pounds per square inch (69,000 kPa) of pressure on the head of the reactor vessel when water struck the head at 160 feet per second (50&amp;nbsp;m/s)" "This extreme form of [[water hammer]] propelled control rods, shield plugs, and the entire reactor vessel upward. A later investigation concluded that the 26,000-pound (12,000&amp;nbsp;kg) vessel had jumped 9 feet 1 inch (2.77 m) and the upper control rod drive mechanisms had struck the ceiling of the reactor building prior to settling back into its original location"''

A steam locomotive operating at 350&amp;nbsp;psi (2.4&amp;nbsp;MPa) would have a temperature of about 225&amp;nbsp;°C, and a specific enthalpy of 963.7&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg.&lt;ref&gt;Milo D. Koretsky, “Engineering and Chemical Thermodynamics”, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2004,  p. 508&lt;/ref&gt; Since standard pressure saturated water has a specific enthalpy of just 418.91&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg,&lt;ref&gt;Milo D. Koretsky, “Engineering and Chemical Thermodynamics”, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2004,  p. 509&lt;/ref&gt; the difference between the two specific enthalpies, 544.8&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg, is the total energy expended in the explosion. So in the case of a large locomotive which can hold as much as 10,000&amp;nbsp;kg of water at a high pressure and temperature state, this explosion would have an theoretical energy release equal to about 1160&amp;nbsp;kg of [[TNT equivalent|TNT]].

== Firebox explosions ==
In the case of a [[Firebox (steam engine)|firebox]] explosion, these typically occur after a burner [[flameout]]. Oil fumes, natural gas, propane, coal, or any other fuel can build up inside the combustion chamber. This is especially of concern when the vessel is hot; the fuels will rapidly volatize due to the temperature. Once the [[lower explosive limit]] (LEL) is reached, any source of ignition will cause an explosion of the vapors.

A fuel explosion within the confines of the firebox may damage the pressurized boiler tubes and interior shell, potentially triggering structural failure, steam or water leakage, and/or a secondary boiler shell failure and [[steam explosion]].

A common form of minor firebox "explosion" is known as "drumming" and can occur with any type of fuel. Instead of the normal "roar" of the fire, a rhythmic series of "thumps" and flashes of fire below the grate and through the [[firedoor]] indicate that the combustion of the fuel is proceeding through a rapid series of detonations, caused by an inappropriate air/fuel mixture with regard to the level of draft available. This usually causes no damage in locomotive type boilers, but can cause cracks in masonry boiler settings if allowed to continue.

=== Grooving ===
The plates of early locomotive boilers were joined by simple [[lap joint|overlapping joints]]. This practice was satisfactory for the annular joints, running around the boiler, but in longitudinal joints, along the length of the boiler, the overlap of the plates diverted the boiler cross-section from its ideal circular shape. Under pressure the boiler strained to reach, as nearly as possible, the circular cross-section. Because the double-thickness overlap was stronger than the surrounding metal, the repeated bending and release caused by the variations in boiler pressure caused internal cracks, or grooves (deep pitting), along the length of the joint. The cracks offered a starting point for internal corrosion, which could hasten failure.&lt;ref&gt;Hewison (1983: 59 et sec)&lt;/ref&gt; It was eventually found that this internal corrosion could be reduced by using plates of sufficient size so that no joints were situated below the water level.&lt;ref name= CHH15&gt;Hewison (1983: 15)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baldwin|first=Thomas|date=1 October 1867|title=On single and double riveted joints|journal=Transactions for 1866|publisher=[[Society of Engineers UK|Society of Engineers]]|location=London|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the simple lap seam was replaced by the single or double butt-strap seams, which do not suffer from this defect.

Due to the constant expansion and contraction of the firebox a similar form of "stress corrosion" can take place at the ends of staybolts where they enter the firebox plates, and is accelerated by poor water quality.  Often referred to as "necking", this type of corrosion can reduce the strength of the staybolts until they are incapable of supporting the firebox at normal pressure.

Grooving (deep, localized pitting) also occurs near the waterline, particularly in boilers that are fed with water that has not been de-aerated or treated with oxygen scavenging agents. All "natural" sources of water contain dissolved air, which is released as a gas when the water is heated. The air (which contains oxygen) collects in a layer near the surface of the water and greatly accelerates corrosion of the boiler plates in that area.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Frank D. (1945) "Audel's Power Plant Engineers guide" New York, Ny: Theo Audel and Co. (p.332-333, figure 55: "corrosion along the water line due to air")&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Firebox ===
The intricate shape of a locomotive firebox, whether made of soft copper or of steel, can only resist the  steam pressure on its internal walls  if these are supported by [[Firebox (steam engine)#Sheets and stays|stays]] attached to internal girders and the outer walls. They are liable to fail through [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] (because the inner and outer walls expand at different rates under the heat of the fire), from corrosion, or from wasting as  the heads of the  stays exposed to the fire are burned away. If the stays fail the firebox will explode inwards. Regular visual inspection, internally and externally, is employed to prevent this.&lt;ref name="CHH15" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=A Morton|title=Locomotives|volume=1|year=1950|publisher=Virtue|location=London|pages=20–23|oclc=499543971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even a well-maintained firebox will fail explosively if the water level in the boiler is allowed to fall far enough to leave the top plate of the firebox uncovered.&lt;ref name="BTCenginemen"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can occur when crossing the summit of the hill, as the water flows to the front part of the boiler and can expose the firebox crown sheet. The majority of locomotive explosions are firebox explosions caused by such crown sheet uncovering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homemodelenginemachinist.com/f19/small-model-boiler-explosion-video-4936/|title=Small model boiler explosion video – Home Model Engine Machinist|website=www.homemodelenginemachinist.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Steamboat boilers ==
[[File:Helen McGregor 1830.jpeg|thumb|Steamboat explodes in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] in 1830]]
The [[Pennsylvania (steamboat)|Pennsylvania]] was a side wheeler steamboat which suffered a boiler explosion in the Mississippi River and sank at Ship Island near Memphis, Tennessee, on June 13, 1858. Of the 450 passengers on board more than 250 died, including Henry Clemens, the younger brother of the author [[Mark Twain]].

[[SS Ada Hancock]], a small [[steamboat]] used to transfer passengers and cargo to and from the large coastal [[steamship]]s that stopped in [[San Pedro Harbor]] in the early 1860s, suffered disaster when its boiler exploded violently in [[San Pedro Bay (California)|San Pedro Bay]], the port of [[Los Angeles]], near [[Wilmington, California]] on April 27, 1863 killing twenty-six people and injuring many others of the fifty-three or more passengers on board.

The [[Sultana (steamboat)|steamboat ''Sultana'']] was destroyed in an explosion on 27 April 1865, resulting in the greatest maritime disaster in [[United States]] history.  An estimated 1,549 passengers were killed when three of the ship's four boilers exploded and the ''Sultana'' burned and sank not far from [[Memphis, Tennessee]].

Another US Civil War Steamboat explosion was the Steamer ''Eclipse'' on January 27, 1865, which was carrying members of the [[9th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery|9th Indiana Artillery]]. One official Records report mentions the disaster reports 10 killed and 68 injured;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&amp;coll=moa&amp;view=50&amp;root=/moa/waro/waro0103/&amp;tif=00622.TIF&amp;cite=http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/moa-cgi?notisid=ANU4519-0103|title=The war of the rebellion: a compilation of the official records of the Union and Confederate armies. ; Series 1 – Volume 49 (Part I)|website=cdl.library.cornell.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; a later report mentions that 27 were killed and 78 wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&amp;coll=moa&amp;view=50&amp;root=/moa/waro/waro0109/&amp;tif=00722.TIF&amp;cite=http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/moa-cgi?notisid=ANU4519-0109|title=The war of the rebellion: a compilation of the official records of the Union and Confederate armies. ; Series 1 – Volume 52 (Part I)|website=cdl.library.cornell.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox's Regimental Losses reports 29 killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilwarhome.com/chapt12.htm|title=Fox's Regimental Losses, Chapter 12|website=www.civilwarhome.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

== Use of boilers ==
The [[stationary steam engine]]s used to power machinery first came to prominence during the [[industrial revolution]], and in the early days there were many boiler explosions from a variety of causes. One of the first investigators of the problem was [[William Fairbairn]], who helped establish the first insurance company dealing with the losses such explosions could cause. He also established experimentally that the [[hoop stress]] in a cylindrical pressure vessel like a boiler was twice the [[longitudinal stress]].&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;[[William Fairbairn|Fairbairn]]'s theoretical calculation assumes that the cylindrical vessel is much longer than its diameter. In practice, this is a viable approximation for any boiler that is a [[right cylinder]] or longer. Even for a short, squat boiler such as the [[Scotch marine boiler|Scotch]], the reduced end area due to the tubes and their staying effect on the end-plates means that the principal stress is still this hoop stress.&lt;/ref&gt; Such investigations helped him and others explain the importance of [[stress concentration]]s in weakening boilers.

== Modern boilers ==
Modern boilers are designed with redundant pumps, valves, water level monitors, fuel cutoffs, automated controls, and pressure [[relief valves]]. In addition, the construction must adhere to strict engineering guidelines set by the relevant authorities. The [[National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors#National Board Inspection Code|NBIC]], [[ASME]], and others attempt to ensure safe boiler designs by publishing detailed standards. The result is a boiler unit which is less prone to catastrophic accidents.

Also improving safety is the increasing use of "package boilers." These are boilers which are built at a factory then shipped out as a complete unit to the job site.  These typically have better quality and fewer issues than boilers which are site assembled tube-by-tube. A package boiler only needs the final connections to be made (electrical, breaching, condensate lines, etc.) to complete the installation.

== Steam explosions ==
In [[steam locomotive]] boilers, as knowledge was gained by [[trial and error]] in early days, the explosive situations and consequent damage due to explosions were inevitable. However, improved design and [[Fire-tube boiler#Maintenance|maintenance]] markedly reduced the number of boiler explosions by the end of the 19th century.  Further improvements continued in the 20th century.

On land-based boilers, explosions of the pressure systems happened regularly in stationary steam boilers in the [[Victorian era]], but are now very rare because of the various [[Safety|protections]] provided, and because of regular inspections compelled by [[governmental]] and industry requirements.

{{See also|List of boiler explosions}}

[[Water heater]]s can [[MythBusters (2009 season)#Exploding Water Heater|explode with surprising violence]] when their safety devices fail.

=== Reactor explosions ===
A steam explosion can occur in any kind of a water heater, where a sufficient amount of energy is delivered and the steam created exceeds the strength of the vessel. When the heat delivery is sufficiently rapid, a localized superheating can occur, resulting in a water hammer destroying the vessel. The [[SL-1]] nuclear reactor accident is a good example.

== Locomotive boiler explosions in the UK ==
[[File:Boiler explosion 1850.jpg|thumb|Aftermath of a boiler explosion on a railway locomotive circa 1850.]]
Hewison (1983)&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hewison, Locomotive Boiler Explosions|Hewison, Locomotive Boiler Explosions]]&lt;/ref&gt; gives a comprehensive account of British boiler explosions, listing 137 between 1815 and 1962.  It is noteworthy that 122 of these were in the 19th century and only 15 in the 20th century.

Boiler explosions generally fell into two categories.  The first is the breakage of the boiler barrel itself, through weakness/damage or excessive internal pressure, resulting in sudden discharge of steam over a wide area. [[Stress corrosion cracking]] at the [[lap joint]]s was a common cause of early boiler explosions, probably caused by [[caustic embrittlement]]. The water used in boilers was not often closely controlled, and if acidic, could corrode the [[wrought iron]] boiler plates. [[Galvanic corrosion]] was an additional problem where [[copper]] and iron were in contact.
Boiler plates have been thrown up to a quarter of a mile (Hewison, Rolt). The second type is the collapse of the firebox under steam pressure from the adjoining boiler, releasing flames and hot gases into the cab. Improved design and maintenance almost totally eliminated the first type, but the second type is always possible if the engineer and fireman do not maintain the water level in the boiler.

Boiler barrels could explode if the internal pressure became too high.  To prevent this, safety valves were installed to release the pressure at a set level. Early examples were spring-loaded, but [[John Ramsbottom (engineer)|John Ramsbottom]] invented a tamper-proof valve which was universally adopted. The other common cause of explosions was internal [[corrosion]] which weakened the boiler barrel so that it could not withstand normal operating pressure. In particular, grooves could occur along horizontal seams (lap joints) below water level. Dozens of explosions resulted, but were eliminated by 1900 by the adoption of butt joints, plus improved maintenance schedules and regular hydraulic testing.

Fireboxes were generally made of [[copper]], though later locomotives had [[steel]] fireboxes.  They were held to the outer part of the boiler by stays (numerous small supports).  Parts of the firebox in contact with full steam pressure have to be kept covered with water, to stop them overheating and weakening.  The usual cause of firebox collapses is that the boiler water level falls too low and the top of the firebox (crown sheet) becomes uncovered and overheats.  This occurs if the fireman has failed to maintain water level or the level indicator (gauge glass) is faulty.  A less common reason is breakage of large numbers of stays, due to corrosion or unsuitable material.

Throughout the 20th century, two boiler barrel failures and thirteen firebox collapses occurred in the UK. The boiler barrel failures occurred at Cardiff in 1909 and Buxton in 1921; both were caused by misassembly of the [[safety valve]]s causing the boilers to exceed their design pressures. Of the 13 firebox collapses, four were due to broken stays, one to scale buildup on the firebox, and the rest were due to low water level.

In 1900, [[Chicago]] already had the second largest [[cable car (railway)|cable car]] network in the country (and, arguably, the city would grow to have the largest streetcar network in the world in a few decades).&lt;ref&gt;[[Trams in Melbourne|Melbourne]], [[Australia]] also has claims to being the largest cable system. The largest system really depended on whether or not track in depots was counted.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, there were three private companies operating {{convert|41|mi|km|1}} of double track routes radiating out from the [[Downtown|downtown area]]. [[State of the art]] technology when the first line opened in 1882, by 1900 [[Railway electric traction|electric traction]] had proven superior and in 1906 all cable routes were changed to electrical power. In 2015 most were part of [[Chicago Transit Authority]] [[bus]] routes.

==History==
In the 1850s Chicago was growing rapidly and local transportation was a problem. Flat and low, drainage was poor and the roads were often muddy and near impassible for foot and horse traffic.

In 1859 the Illinois state legislature incorporated the [[Chicago City Railway]] (CCR) and the North Chicago Street Railroad (NCSR), to provide [[Horsecar|rail horsecar]] service in Chicago. In 1861 the Chicago West Division Railway was incorporated. The three companies served different parts of the city, defined by the [[Chicago River]], and were not in competition with each other. By 1880 all three had main routes with feeder lines.

In 1882 the CCR opened cable lines to the south on State St. and Wabash-Cottage Grove Ave. Immediately successful, the State St. line would be extended to 63rd St. by 1887 and the Cottage Grove Ave. line to 71st St. by 1890.

In 1886 the NCSR put a cable line on Clark St. and parallel 5th Ave. (now Wells St.) into service. In 1889 a branch on Lincoln Ave. opened, and the last branch, on Clybourn Ave., opened in 1891.

In 1890 the re-organized West Chicago Street Railroad (WCSR) opened their first lines, to the northwest on Milwaukee Ave. Shortly afterword a line strait west on Madison Ave. opened. In 1893 two more routes would open, southwest on Blue Island Ave and south on Halsted St.

In 1892 the Chicago City Council allowed the CCR to electrify three horse lines outside of downtown, two years later many North and West lines were electrified. In 1896 the first downtown electrification was permitted, in 1906 all cable service was converted to electric traction.

==Operations==
[[File:Chi_cable_train_NB_on_State_(cropped).tif|thumb|CCR train northbound on State St.&lt;br&gt;(Grip and trailer pulling electric car)]]
The cable cars did not suffer much from the elements, and the harsher winters of the US Midwest and East Coast were no problem for them. As with some other cities using cable cars the problem in generally flat Chicago was not one of [[Grade (slope)|grades]], but of traffic volume due to the density of the city.

As in other cities the cable cars did not completely replace the horsecars, but they rather created a transportation backbone. In fact, even as the horse lines were being converted to [[tram|trolleys]], the electrical cars had to be pulled by grip cars through the downtown, due to the lack of trolley wires there.

==Rolling stock==
[[File:1902combinationCar@ChicagoCableRoad.jpg|thumb|Combination grip car]]
The passenger numbers caused a different approach than many other cities. Some single cars were used, but on most lines grip cars pulled trains of up to three trailers (reduced to two by law in the 1890s).

Most grip cars were short and open. Four different types of grips were used, one by each company and the WCSR's south and southwest lines using a fourth. CCR used a grip that could grip either side of the cable, allowing the grip car to operate in either direction. NCSR and WCSR grip cars could operate in one direction only. None of the grips could be used on other lines. Approximately 700 grip cars were in service.

Both the NCSR and WCSR operated large combination grip cars, with an open front and closed back sections. These cars also could pull trailers.

Trailers started as short two axle cars similar to horsecars, and were built by the operator. Later, longer two [[Bogie|truck]] cars would be built by vendors. Open summer and closed winter cars were used, with two car trains the norm, there were between two and four trailers for each grip.
{{sfnp|Borzo|2012|pp=40-42, 94, 129}}
{{sfnp|Hilton|1982|p=54-5,}}

==Loops==
Switching directions on a cable train can be very difficult. Each track can go in one direction only, and the grip car has to be at the head of the train. Turning around a loop was common, at the end of most lines there were loops. In the downtown area the loops went around several blocks, increasing the area the line would otherwise serve. Equipment and operating differences prevented common track use between most routes, in 1900 there were six separate loops in use.

{{sfnp|Hilton|1982|p=234}}

==[[Streetcar tunnels in Chicago, Illinois|Tunnels]]==
The Chicago River separates the downtown from the North and West sides. Heavy river traffic required moveable bridges, and long delays. Cable cannot be used on moveable bridges, and the delays would have stopped the whole system, so the NCCR leased and refurbished the city's LaSalle St. tunnel under the river, the WCCR would use the similar [[Washington Street Tunnel (Chicago)|Washington St. tunnel]] for its first two lines. For the WCCR's two Southwest lines the company dug a tunnel next to Van Buren St. at their own expense.

{{sfnp|Hilton|1982|p=241, 245, 247}}
{{sfnp|Lind|1979|pp=208-210}}

==Powerhouses and cables==
All three companies used similar infrastructures, with large steam boilers and reciprocating engines driving long endless cables through conduits. At their peak there were 13 powerhouses driving 34 cables. Different cables could run at different speeds, the CCR's loop originally ran at {{convert|4|mph|abbr=on}} (increased to {{frac|8|1|2}} in 1892) while outlying cables could operate at {{convert|14|mph|abbr=on}}.

{{sfnp|Young|1998|pp=22-23}}

==Political corruption==
Throughout cable operations both politics and business were very corrupt in many cities, including Chicago. Some politicians expected not only political support but also bribes. Dummy companies were created to extort the operators, and property owners often conspired to sell their consent to the routes. The CCR, well managed and first in operation, was affected least, while the North and West companies, controlled by [[Robber baron (industrialist)|robber baron]] [[Charles Yerkes|Charles Tyson Yerkes]], were involved in some unscrupulous business practices.
{{sfnp|Borzo|2012|pp=80-82, 103-132}}
{{sfnp|Young|1998|pp=38-41, 46-63}}

==The end of cable service==
In 1900 the [[Chicago River#Reversing the flow|lowering of the river]] exposed the tops of all three tunnels, making them hazards to navigation. In 1906 all three tunnels under the river were closed for construction, cutting cable service to the North and West. This was when the changeover to electricity ordered by the Chicago City Council in 1905 occurred. The last cable powered train was on the CCR Cottage Grove Ave. line on October 21, 1906.

==The companies==

===Chicago City Railway===
In 1900 the Chicago City Railway was the largest cable operator in the country. Incorporated on February 14, 1859, it was well managed and progressive from its beginning. In 1880 their president had inspected the successful San Francisco lines, and felt cable could be used in Chicago. In 1882 they opened the first cable lines outside of San Francisco. They then built lines past the built up areas, making land along the route more valuable. Development followed the lines, making more traffic.

When first opened the State St. and Wabash - Cottage Grove Avenue lines both used a slow speed ({{convert|4|mph|abbr=on}}) three block loop. This could not handle the traffic, in 1892 the Cottage Grove Avenue line started using a new two block loop directly east of the original, which was rebuilt two years later. Trains of both lines ran opposite each other on Wabash Ave.

Because CCR grip cars were bi-directional, trains could be reversed onto the opposite track, and did not need a loop. It also meant that a train could stop and return without going to the end of the line. The Cottage Grove line had runs reversing at 39th St. and at the end of the line.

In 1887 the CCR carried 70,000 to 100,000 passengers a day on approximately 150 trains. By 1892, after both lines had been lengthened, 300 trains were scheduled daily. Three powerhouses pulled thirteen cables.

In 1906 CCR electrified its State St. line on July 22, and the Wabash-Cottage Grove Ave. line on October 21, the last day of cable service in Chicago.

On February 1, 1914, the CCR began operating as part of the [[Chicago Surface Lines]] (CSL).{{sfnp|Borzo|2012|pp=75-105}}{{sfnp|Hilton|1982|pp=234-239}}{{sfnp|Lind|1979|pp=445-450}}{{sfnp|Young|1998|p=41-45}}

===North Chicago Street Railroad===
The North Chicago Street Railroad was the smallest of the three companies. Incorporated in 1859 as the North Chicago Street Railway, a horse-car system, it was badly damaged by the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871. Little improvement was done until 1885, when a Philadelphia syndicate controlled by Charles Tyson Yerkes reorganized it as the North Chicago Street Railroad. In 1886 it began converting to cable.

All the NCSR's lines entered downtown through the [[LaSalle Street Tunnel|LaSalle St. tunnel]] and used a six block loop. The Clybourn Ave. line was the only place where single combination cars were used. The end of that route at had a turntable, rather than the loops that the other lines used.

The NCSR had up to 177 grip cars and many more trailers. Three powerhouses pulled 9 cables.

On May 24, 1899, the NCSR and WCSR were combined into the Chicago Union Traction Co., which would go into receivership on April 22, 1903 and was bought by the Chicago Railway Co. (CR) on January 25, 1908. On February 1, 1914, the Chicago Railway Co. began operating as part of the Chicago Surface Lines.{{sfnp|Borzo|2012|pp=133-146}}{{sfnp|Hilton|1982|p=241-244}}{{sfnp|Lind|1979|pp=445-450}}{{sfnp|Young|1998|p=45}}

===West Chicago Street Railroad===
The West Chicago Street Railroad was incorporated in 1861 as the Chicago West Division Railway, in 1885 the Chicago Passenger Railway opened as a competitor. In 1887 the two were combined and reorganized by Charles Tyson Yerkes as the West Chicago Street Railroad. This put the NCSR. and WCSR under the same ownership, it began cable service in 1890, the last of the three companies to do so.

A northwest and west line used another [[Washington Street Tunnel (Chicago)|tunnel under the river]] on Washington St. to get to a two block loop, a four block loop was later added. A south and southwest line terminated west of the river until the privately built Van Buren St. tunnel opened in 1894, an eight block loop was used. The northwest Milwaukee Ave. line used single combination cars, all other lines used short grip cars with trailers.

The WCSR had 230 grip cars and several times many trailers. Six powerhouses pulled 12 cables.

On May 24, 1899 the WCSR, like the NCSR, was combined into the CUT, which would be bought by the CR on January 25, 1908. On February 1, 1914, the CR began operating as part of the Chicago Surface Lines.{{sfnp|Borzo|2012|pp=133-146}}{{sfnp|Lind|1979|pp=445-450}}{{sfnp|Young|1998|p=45}}

==Remnants==
A CCR station from 1893 at 5529 South Lake Park Avenue survives in 2015. It currently serves as the home of the [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] Historical Society. A shop building from 1902 and streetcar barns from 1906 remained in service in 2014 at the [[Chicago Transit Authority|Chicago Transit Authority's]] 77th St. and Vincennes Ave. yard.{{sfnp|Borzo|2012|pp=93, 175-176}}

A NCSR [[LaSalle Street Cable Car Powerhouse (Chicago)|powerhouse at LaSalle and Illinois Streets]] remained in 2012.{{sfnp|Borzo|2012|pp=175-177}}

A WCSR altered powerhouse at Jefferson and Washington Streets and a car barn on Blue Island Ave. near Western Avenue remained in 2016.{{sfnp|Borzo|2012|pp=177-180}}

[[File:Construction barrel.jpg|thumbnail|right|A construction barrel with a barricade light affixed to its handle in [[Florida]]]]
'''Construction barrels''' (officially known as "'''drums'''" in the United States) are traffic control devices used to channel motor vehicle traffic through construction sites or to warn motorists of construction activity near the roadway.  They are used primarily in the [[United States]], but are occasionally used in [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]]. They are an alternative to [[traffic cones]] which are smaller and easily hit by vehicles. Drums tend to command more respect from drivers than cones as they are larger, more visible, and give the appearance of being formidable obstacles.&lt;ref name=MUTCD&gt;{{cite book|title=Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices|year=2009|publisher=Federal Highway Administration|url=http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/kno_2009r1r2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction barrels are typically bright orange&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y8S1LFG_KAEC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=barrel#v=onepage&amp;q=barrel&amp;f=false |title=Insiders' Guide to Cincinnati |edition=seventh |publisher=The Globe Pequot Press |location=Guilford, Conn. |year=2007 |accessdate=October 7, 2013 |first=Felix |last=Winternitz |author2=Sacha DeVroomen Bellman | page=23 |isbn=9780762741809}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have four alternating white and orange reflective bands. However some regions, such as the province of Ontario, Canada, uses black stripes instead of white. Most have a rubber base that prevents the barrel from tipping over during high winds or when struck by a vehicle.  Construction barrels have a handle at the top so they can be easily picked up and carried.  The handle also allows crews to install barricade lights to increase visibility. The product makes up a $90 million industry in the United States &lt;ref&gt;https://www.catholicjournal.us/2011/09/27/the-orange-construction-barrel/&lt;/ref&gt;.

Until the late 1980s, construction crews typically used 55-gallon steel [[drum (container)|drums]] to guide traffic through construction areas.  They were painted orange and white and filled with sand or water to keep them in place.  Because the drums were steel and weighed down with sand or water, extensive damage would occur to vehicles striking them. Plastic barrels that are commonly seen on American roadways today began emerging in the late 1970s and 1980s; steel 55-gallon drums were largely phased out by the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;https://www.catholicjournal.us/2011/09/27/the-orange-construction-barrel/&lt;/ref&gt; and may no longer be used as traffic control devices in the US.&lt;ref name="MUTCD" /&gt;  

By 1981, the drums were mainly a two-piece plastic design that included the top piece of the drum and a base that was filled with sandbags. The same year, an updated version of the invention was released by [http://pss-innovations.com/ PSS]; it included a flange to allow sandbag placement on the outside of the drum which made it easier to maneuver&lt;ref&gt;http://pss-innovations.com/About-PSS.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1985, PSS released the modern-day version of the construction barrel, the [http://pss-innovations.com/Products/Channelizers/LifeGardDrums.aspx LifeGard®] drum &lt;ref&gt;http://pss-innovations.com/About-PSS.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;. The LifeGard® utilized the sidewall of a recycled truck tire at its base to keep the drum securely in place on the roadway&lt;ref&gt;http://pss-innovations.com/About-PSS.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;. This design is the most common one in use today.

[[Image:SNL-LIGA-CPW.jpg|thumb|A {{nowrap|517 µm}} tall copper coplanar [[Waveguide (electromagnetism)|waveguide]] created using [[LIGA]] technique.&lt;ref name=Forman-2006&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Forman, M.

'''Coplanar waveguide''' is a type of electrical [[planar transmission line]] which can be fabricated using [[printed circuit board]] technology, and is used to convey microwave-frequency signals. On a smaller scale, coplanar waveguide [[transmission line]]s are also built into [[monolithic microwave integrated circuit]]s. Conventional coplanar waveguide (CPW) consists of a single conducting track printed onto a [[dielectric]] substrate, together with a pair of return conductors, one to either side of the track. All three conductors are on the same side of the substrate, and hence are ''coplanar''. The return conductors are separated from the central track by a small gap, which has an unvarying width along the length of the line. Away from the cental conductor, the return conductors usually extend to an indefinite but large distance, so that each is notionally a semi-infinite plane.

'''Conductor-backed coplanar waveguide''' (CBCPW) is a common variant which has a [[ground plane]] covering the entire back-face of the substrate. The ground-plane serves as a third return conductor.

Coplanar waveguide was invented in 1969 by Cheng P. Wen, primarily as a means by which non-[[Reciprocity (electromagnetism)|reciprocal]] components such as [[gyrator]]s and [[isolator (microwave)|isolator]]s could be incorporated in planar transmission line circuits.&lt;ref name="wen1969"/&gt;

The electromagnetic wave carried by a coplanar waveguide exists partly in the [[dielectric]] substrate, and partly in the air above it. In general, the [[dielectric constant]] of the substrate will be different (and greater) than that of the air, so that the wave is travelling in an inhomogeneous medium. In consequence CPW will not support a true [[Transverse electric and magnetic mode|TEM]] wave; at non-zero frequencies, both the [[electric field|E]] and [[magnetic field|H fields]] will have longitudinal components (a [[Transverse electric and magnetic mode|hybrid mode]]){{Citation needed|reason=How can a longitudinal electric field exist along a conductor in a coplanar waveguide?|date=March 2017}}.

== Nonreciprocal devices ==
Nonreciprocal gyromagnetic devices depend on the microwave signal presenting a rotating (circularly polarized) magnetic field to a statically magnetized [[Ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] body.  CPW is designed to produce just such a rotating magnetic field in the two slots between the central and side conductors.

The dielectric substrate has no direct effect on the magnetic field of a microwave signal travelling along the CPW line.  For the magnetic field, the CPW is then symmetrical in the plane of the metalization, between the substrate side and the air side.  Consequently, currents flowing along parallel paths on opposite faces of each conductor (on the air-side and on the substrate-side) are subject to the same inductance, and the overall current tends to be divided equally between the two faces.

Conversely, the substrate ''does'' affect the electric field, so that the substrate side contributes a larger capacitance across the slots than does the air side.  Electric charge can accumulate or be depleted more readily on the substrate face of the conductors than on the air face.  As a result, at those points on the wave where the current reverses direction, charge will spill over the edges of the metalization between the air face and the substrate face.  This secondary current over the edges gives rise to a longitudinal (parallel with the line), magnetic field in each of the slots, which is in [[Quadrature phase|quadrature]] with the vertical (normal to the substrate surface) magnetic field associated with the main current along the conductors.

If the [[dielectric constant]] of the substrate is much greater than unity, then the magnitude of the longitudinal magnetic field approaches that of the vertical field, so that the combined magnetic field in the slots approaches circular polarization.&lt;ref name="wen1969"/&gt;

==Application in solid state physics==
Coplanar waveguides play an important role in the field of solid state [[quantum computing]], e.g. for the coupling of microwave photons to a superconducting qubit. In particular the research field of [[circuit quantum electrodynamics]] was initiated with coplanar waveguide [[resonator]]s as crucial elements that allow for high field strength and thus strong coupling to a [[Superconducting quantum computing|superconducting qubit]] by confining a microwave photon to a volume that is much smaller than the cube of the wavelength. To further enhance this coupling, superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators with extremely low losses were applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=L. Frunzio |year=2005|title=Fabrication and Characterization of Superconducting Circuit QED Devices for Quantum Computation |journal=IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity |volume=15|pages=860 |doi=10.1109/TASC.2005.850084 |arxiv = cond-mat/0411708 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=M.

A '''Daly detector''' is a gas-phase [[ion]] detector that consists of a metal "doorknob", a [[scintillator]] ([[phosphor]] screen) and a [[photomultiplier]].&lt;ref&gt;N. R. Daly, [http://link.aip.org/link/?RSINAK/31/264/1 Scintillation Type Mass Spectrometer ion Detector] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120717153848/http://link.aip.org/link/?RSINAK/31/264/1 |date=2012-07-17 }}. ''Rev. Sci. Instrum.'' '''31'''(3), 264–267 (1960).&lt;/ref&gt; It was named after its inventor Norman Richard Daly. Daly detectors are typically used in [[mass spectrometer]]s.

==Principle of operation==
Ions that hit the doorknob release secondary electrons. A high voltage (about {{val|-20000|u=V}}) between the doorknob and the scintillator accelerates the electrons onto the phosphor screen, where they are converted to photons. These photons are detected by the [[photomultiplier]].

The advantage of the Daly detector is that the photomultiplier can be separated by a window, which lets the photons through from the high vacuum of the mass spectrometer, thus preventing an otherwise possible contamination and extending life span of the detector. The Daly detector also allows a higher acceleration after the field-free region of a [[time-of-flight mass spectrometer]] flight tube, which can improve the sensitivity for heavy ions.

==Norman Richard Daly==

Norman Daly was awarded 6 patents in the years 1962–1973 relating to ion detection and mass spectrometers, from his work at the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10165">The '''Design Piracy Prohibition Act''', {{USBill|110|H.R.|2033}}, {{USBill|110|S.|1957}}, and {{USBill|111|H.R.|2196}}, were [[bill (law)|bills]] of the same name introduced in the [[United States Congress]] that would have amended [[Title 17 of the United States Code]] to provide ''[[sui generis]]'' protection to [[fashion design]]s for a period of three years.  The Acts would have extend protection to "the appearance as a whole of an article of apparel, including its ornamentation," with "apparel" defined to include "men's, women's, or children's clothing, including undergarments, outerwear, gloves, footwear, and headgear;" "handbags, purses, and tote bags;" belts, and eyeglass frames.  In order to receive the three-year term of protection, the designer would be required to [[copyright registration|register]] with the [[U.S. Copyright Office]] within three months of going public with the design.

==H.R. 2511, 112th Congress==
H.R. 2511 was introduced July 13, 2011 by Representative Robert Goodlatte [R-VA6] with thirteen co-sponsors. On August 25, 2011, the [[U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary]] referred the Bill to the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property|U.S. House Subcomittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property]].
http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-2511

==H.R. 2033, 110th Congress==
H.R. 2033 was introduced April 25, 2007 by Representative [[Bill Delahunt]] with fourteen co-sponsors. On May 4, 2007 the [[U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary]] referred the Bill to the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property|U.S. House Subcomittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property]]. A hearing was held February 14, 2008, but the bill never made it out of the subcommittee.

==S. 1957, 110th Congress==
S. 1957 was introduced on August 2, 2007, in [[Washington, D.C.]] by Senator [[Charles Schumer]] (D-NY) with ten co-sponsors. The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary but progressed no further.

==H.R. 2196, 111th Congress==
H.R. 2196 was introduced on April 30, 2009, by Representative Delahunt and twenty-three co-sponsors. The bill was referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary on the same day and then stalled in committee.

==Current Status of Fashion Design Protection==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
Currently, fashion may only be protected by [[copyright]] to the extent that its shape is non-utilitarian enough to qualify as a creative "sculpture," or to the extent that a design, pattern, or image on the clothing qualifies as "pictorial" or "graphic." While current laws against [[counterfeit goods]] do provide some protection for designers, this is so only when the trademark is used and not when merely the design is copied under a different label. In addition, fashion may be protected by design patents if the requirements for patentability are met.  To be patentable an ornamental design must be new, original and non-obvious.  The United States Patent and Trademark Office website (www.uspto.gov) has a searchable database of patents, and includes patents on apparel in class D2, carrying articles in class D3, and eyeglass frames in class D16. Technological advances to the means of textile and garment production, as well as increases in the number of distribution channels and the availability of cheap labor in emerging economies have enabled those who would copy these designs to do so quickly and inexpensively. Legislation targeting design piracy has already been enacted in [[Europe]], [[India]], and [[Japan]].

==Criticism==
Critics claim that, contrary to the bill's claims, the bill will actually harm independent [[fashion designer]]s. The majority of independent designers do not have the litigation funds to effectively challenge big business should they be accused of [[copyright infringement]]. Furthermore, because distributors of accused designs can be penalized as well as the designer, distributors of clothing will become very wary of new designs unless the designer has adequate funds, influence, and power to hire skilled and effective lawyers. Pattern companies frequently utilize prevailing trends; so they too are vulnerable. Because of the legal risks of producing fashion patterns, fewer people will sew their own clothing, and fabric and sewing stores will suffer losses as well. As evidence of the bill's hypocrisy, critics point to how one of the most vocal supporters of the bill, [[Diane von Fürstenberg]], was recently caught copying and distributing a piece of clothing originally designed by an independent Canadian designer. Critics also argue that the industry is already thriving commercially and encourages innovation.  They point attention to the concept that originality in fashion design is too insubstantial for copyright law to distinguish protected elements from non-protected elements, and that extending copyright protection would stifle independent designers while giving powerful, big-business fashion houses a near-[[monopoly]].

==Related Bills==

===H.R. 5055, 109th Congress: To Amend Title 17, United States Code, to Provide Protection for Fashion Design===
H.R. 5055 was introduced March 30, 2006 by Representative [[Robert W. Goodlatte]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Virginia|Va.]]), with six co-sponsors from both parties. The bill was referred by the [[U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary]] to the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property|U.S. House Subcomittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property]].

The subcommittee held a hearing on the bill on July 27, 2006, at which there was disagreement among legal experts as well as representatives of the fashion industry as to whether there was a need for copyright protection.  Proponents of the Act claimed that new technology threatened American designers' ability to compete with the products of lower-cost countries, because the distribution of images of new designs and the automation of copying and manufacturing could occur within hours.  They additionally pointed out that the United States was the exception among western nations in failing to protect designs.

===S. 3728, 111th Congress: Innovative Design Protection and Piracy Prevention Act===
S.3728 was introduced on August 5, 2010, by Senator [[Chuck Schumer]] with ten co-sponsors. On December 1, 2010, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary voted unanimously for the bill to proceed to the Senate floor. This is the furthest that any of the design bills has progressed since 2006.

Under the IDPPPA, a copy of a design would have infringed if it was found to be "substantially identical" to the original work with little to no changes to set that design apart. Penalties for false representation would have been increased from $500 to $5,000 and from $1,000 to $10,000. "Apparel" items that would be protected by this Act include women's, men's, and children's clothing as well as luggage, handbags, wallets and eyeglass frames. A "fashion design" under the IDPPPA would be defined as an entire article of apparel including its embellishment and also includes elements of the original apparel that are the creative work of the original designer and are unique.

Supporters argue that this act would create more protection for fashion designers. Opponents have argued that the bill would "bring more lawyers into every step of the design process," outlaw "inspiration and creativity," prevent "unrestricted use of works in the public domain," and "slow down the fast-paced design process."[http://designer-entrepreneurs.com/blog/illustrations/DPPA_ABadPlanforAmericasDesigners.pdf] Some designers have supported the IDPPPA for protecting their current and future fashion designs. For example, Kurt Courtney of the AAFA has praised the bill as a "great compromise and a product of hard work," but added that its effects will largely be seen in court cases involving the bill.&lt;ref&gt;[BNA's Patent, Trademark &amp; Copyright Journal, December 3, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===S. 3523, 112th Congress: Innovative Design Protection Act===

S.3523 was introduced on September 10, 2012, by Senator [[Chuck Schumer]] with ten co-sponsors. On September 20, 2012, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary voted for the bill to proceed to the Senate floor without amendment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/D?d112:2:./temp/~bdJNnQ::|/home/LegislativeData.php?n=BSS;c=112  "Bill Summary &amp; Status, 112th Congress (2011-12), S. 3523"], [[THOMAS]].

'''eSpace'''&lt;ref name="eSpace for Software Development"&gt;[http://espace.com.eg/company/about eSpace for Software Development]&lt;/ref&gt; is a software company established in Egypt. It was founded in the year 2000 when eight graduates from Computer Science Department, Alexandria University decided that instead of seeking a job opportunity in any multinational company or software house, they would rather start their own company. Inspired by the startup fever that took place in the Silicon Valley at the time, they started their own company which became a leader in the field of Web Scalability Solutions.

'''eSpace''', the Alexandria-based software developer juggernaut had partnered with the Egyptian government to create [http://www.elections.eg elections.eg] to help facilitate elections in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Building on its success in Egypt, eSpace launches elections portal in Turkey"&gt;[http://www.wamda.com/2014/03/fresh-off-its-success-in-egypt-espace-launches-elections-portal-in-turkey Building on its success in Egypt, eSpace launches elections portal in Turkey]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''eSpace''' in partnership with Google, has set up a site in anticipation of the Turkish house elections, scheduled for 30 March.

According to the [[U.S. Patent &amp; Trademark Office]], '''electric heating pouches''' are medical apparatus, namely, electric heating devices for curative treatment.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) classifies the heating pouch as a class II medical device.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Heating pouches are sometimes mislabeled as "[[heating pad]]s". Heating pads are, by definition, flat, whereas heating pouches are contoured or curved.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In order to achieve the geometric design, three uniquely made heating pads are placed within a [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] pouch to form a scoop-like shape.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Heating pouches are made specially for human body [[joint]]s; specifically the shoulder, elbow, hip, knee, ankle, and wrist or hand. The curvature of the pouch enables the user to completely cover these joints, whereas flat heating pads cannot conform to the curved joints.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

[[File:ElectrolyticReduction.ogg|thumb|right|A video describing the process of electrolytic reduction used in a display at [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis]] within the Treasures of the Earth exhibit. The video describes the electrolytic process as it is occurring on [[Captain Kidd's Cannon]], which is on display and currently undergoing the electrolytic process.]]
An '''electrolytic process''' is the use of [[electrolysis]] industrially to refine metals or compounds at a high purity and low cost.  Some examples are the [[Hall-Héroult process]] used for [[aluminium]], or the production of [[hydrogen]] from [[water]]. Electrolysis is usually done in bulk using hundreds of sheets of metal connected to an electric power source.  In the production of copper, these pure sheets of copper are used as starter material for the cathodes, and are then lowered into a solution such as copper sulfate with the large anodes that are cast from impure  (97% pure) copper. The copper from the anodes are electroplated on to the cathodes, while any impurities settle to the bottom of the tank.  This forms cathodes of 99.999% pure copper.

[[File:British Red Cross First Aid Kits.jpg|thumb|Large and small [[first aid]] kits used by the [[British Red Cross]] for event first aid, in the internationally recognised ISO green with a white cross.  These kits also feature the red cross which is a protected symbol under the [[Geneva Conventions]] and may only be used by the Red Cross or military]]
[[File:First aid bag.jpg|thumb|right|A small first aid kit]]

A '''first aid kit''' is a collection of supplies and equipment that is used to give medical treatment. There is a wide variation in the contents of first aid kits based on the knowledge and experience of those putting it together, the differing first aid requirements of the area where it may be used and variations in legislation or regulation in a given area.

The international standard for first aid kits is that they should be identified with the [[International Standards Organization|ISO]] graphical symbol for first aid (from [[ISO 7010]]) which is an equal white cross on a green background.&lt;ref name=ISO&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/obp/ui#iso:grs:7010:E003|title=ISO 7010 - E003|accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
First aid kits can be assembled in almost any type of container, and this will depend on whether they are commercially produced or assembled by an individual.  Standard kits often come in durable plastic boxes, fabric pouches or in wall mounted cabinets.  The type of container will vary depending on purpose, and they range in size from wallet sized through to large box.

It is recommended that all kits are in a clean, waterproof container to keep the contents safe and [[aseptic]].&lt;ref name=tpm&gt;{{cite book|title=First Aid Manual 8th Edition|publisher=St John Ambulance, St Andrews First Aid, British Red Cross|year=2002|ISBN=0-7513-3704-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kits should also be checked regularly and restocked if any items are damaged or are out of date.

==Appearance==
The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) sets a standard for first aid kits of being green, with a white cross, in order to make them easily recognizable to anyone requiring first aid.&lt;ref name=ISO/&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:ISO 7010 E003 - First aid sign.svg| ISO First Aid Symbol
File:First aid.png| Alternate version of the first aid symbol
File:Flag of the Red Cross.svg| Symbol of the [[Red Cross]]
File:Star of life2.svg| [[Star of Life]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The ISO only endorse the use of the green background and white cross, and this has been adopted as standard across many countries and regions, including the entire EU.  First aid kits are sometimes marked (by an individual or organisation) with a red cross on white background, but use of this symbol by anyone but the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) or associated agency is illegal under the terms of the [[First Geneva Convention]], which designates the red cross as a protected symbol in all countries signatory to it.  One of the few exceptions is in North America, where despite the passing of the First Geneva convention in 1864, and its ratification in the United States in 1881, [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] has used the red cross as a mark on its products since 1887 and registered the symbol as a U.S. [[trademark]] for medicinal and surgical plasters in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USPTO record for Johnson &amp; Johnson's Red Cross mark|url=http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=71013666&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=statusSearch|publisher=tsdr.uspto.gov|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some first aid kits may also feature the [[Star of Life]], normally associated with [[emergency medical services]], but which are also used to indicate that the service using it can offer an appropriate point of care. Though not supported by the ISO, a white cross on red back ground is also widely recognised as a first aid symbol. However, for very small medical institutions and domestic purposes, the white cross on a plain green background is preferred.

== Contents of first aid==
[[Image:Laerdal Pocket Mask Case.jpg|thumb|A [[Pocket mask]] in its case.]]
[[Image:Sparadrap 2.jpg|thumb|right|Adhesive bandages are one of the most commonly used items in a first aid kit.]]
[[Image:Tweezer-plastic.JPG|thumb|Plastic Tweezers]]
[[Image:Disposable nitrile glove.jpg|thumb|right|[[Disposable]] gloves are often found in modern first-aid kits.]]
Commercially available first aid kits available via normal retail routes have traditionally been intended for treatment of minor injuries only. Typical contents include adhesive bandages, regular strength pain medication, gauze and low grade disinfectant. 

Specialized first aid kits are available for various regions, vehicles or activities, which may focus on specific risks or concerns related to the activity.  For example, first aid kits sold through marine supply stores for use in watercraft may contain seasickness remedies.

===Airway, Breathing and Circulation===
First aid treats the [[ABC (medicine)|ABCs]] as the foundation of good treatment.  For this reason, most modern commercial first aid kits (although not necessarily those assembled at home) will contain a suitable infection barrier for performing [[artificial respiration]] as part of [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]], examples include:
*[[Pocket mask]]
*[[Face shield]]

Advanced first aid kits may also contain items such as:
*[[Oropharyngeal airway]]
*[[Nasopharyngeal airway]]
*[[Bag valve mask]]
*[[Aspirator (medical device)|Manual aspirator or suction unit]]
*[[Sphygmomanometer]] ([[blood pressure]] cuff)
*[[Stethoscope]]

Some first aid kits, specifically those used by event first aiders and emergency services, include bottled oxygen for resuscitation and therapy.

===Common Items===

The common kits mostly found in the homes may contain:
*Alcohol or non alcohol antiseptic wipes
*[[Band-Aids]]
*Cotton Balls
*Cotton Swabs
*Iodine
*Bandages
*[[Hydrogen Peroxide]]
*Gauze
*Saline
*Dressings 
*Eye wash

===Trauma injuries===
Trauma injuries, such as bleeding, bone fractures or burns, are usually the main focus of most first aid kits, with items such as bandages and dressings being found in the vast majority of all kits.
*[[Adhesive bandage]]s (band-aids, [[sticking plaster]]s) - can include ones shaped for particular body parts, such as knuckles
**[[Moleskin]]&amp;mdash; for blister treatment and prevention
*[[Dressing (medical)|Dressing]]s ([[sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]], applied directly to the [[wound]])
**Sterile [[Human eye|eye]] pads
**Sterile [[gauze]] pads
**Sterile non-adherent pads, containing a non-stick [[teflon]] layer
**[[Petrolatum]] gauze pads, used as an occlusive ( air-tight) dressing for sucking chest wounds, as well as a non-stick dressing
*[[Bandages]] (for securing dressings, not necessarily sterile)
**Gauze roller bandages - absorbent, breathable, and often elastic
**Elastic bandages - used for sprains, and pressure bandages
**Adhesive, elastic roller bandages (commonly called 'Vet wrap') - very effective pressure bandages and durable, waterproof bandaging
**Triangular bandages - used as slings, tourniquets, to tie splints, and many other uses
*[[Butterfly closure strips]] - used like stitches to close wounds, usually only included for higher level response as can seal in infection in uncleaned wounds.
*[[saline (medicine)|Saline]]-used for cleaning wounds or washing out foreign bodies from eyes
*[[soap]] - used with water to clean superficial wounds once bleeding is stopped
*[[Antiseptic]] wipes or sprays for reducing the risk of infection in abrasions or around wounds. Dirty wounds must be cleaned for antiseptics to be effective.
*Burn dressing, which is usually a sterile pad soaked in a cooling gel
*[[Adhesive tape]], [[hypoallergenic]]
*[[Hemostatic]] agents may be included in first aid kits, especially military or tactical kits, to promote clotting for severe bleeding.

===Personal protective equipment===
[[File:First aid 19.jpg|thumb|right|A waterproof [[Pelican Products|Pelican]] first aid kit.]]
The use of [[personal protective equipment]] or PPE will vary by kit, depending on its use and anticipated risk of infection.  The adjuncts to artificial respiration are covered above, but other common [[infection control]] PPE includes:
*[[Medical glove|Glove]]s which are single use and disposable to prevent cross infection
*[[Goggles]] or other eye protection
*[[Surgical mask]] or N95 mask to reduce possibility of airborne infection transmission (sometimes placed on patient instead of caregivers. For this purpose the mask should not have an exhale valve)
*[[Apron]]

===Instruments and equipment===
*[[Trauma shears]] for cutting clothing and general use
*[[Scissors]] are less useful but often included 
*[[Tweezers]], for removing splinters amongst others.
*[[Lighter]] for sanitizing tweezers or pliers etc.
*[[Alcohol]] pads for sanitizing equipment, or unbroken skin. This is sometimes used to debride wounds, however some training authorities advise against this as it may kill cells which bacteria can then feed on
*Irrigation [[syringe]] - with catheter tip for cleaning wounds with sterile water, saline solution, or a weak iodine solution. The stream of liquid flushes out particles of dirt and debris.
*Torch (also known as a [[flashlight]])
*Instant-acting chemical cold packs
*[[Hand sanitizer|Alcohol rub]] (hand sanitizer) or [[antiseptic]] hand wipes
*[[Thermometer]]
*[[Space blanket]] (lightweight plastic foil blanket, also known as "[[emergency blanket]]")
*[[Penlight]]
*[[Cotton swab]]
*Cotton wool, for applying antiseptic lotions.
*[[Safety pins]], for pinning bandages.

===Medication===
Medication can be a controversial addition to a first aid kit, especially if it is for use on members of the public.  It is, however, common for personal or family first aid kits to contain certain medications. Dependent on scope of practice, the main types of medicine are life saving medications, which may be commonly found in first aid kits used by paid or assigned first aiders for members of the public or employees, [[painkillers]], which are often found in personal kits, but may also be found in public provision and lastly symptomatic relief medicines, which are generally only found in personal kits.

'''Life saving'''
*[[Aspirin]]&lt;ref name=tpm/&gt; primarily used for central medical chest pain as an anti-platelet
*[[Epinephrine autoinjector]] (brand name Epipen) - often included in kits for wilderness use and in places such as summer camps, to temporarily reduce airway swelling in the event of anaphylactic shock. Note that epinephrine does not treat the anaphylactic shock itself, it only opens the airway to prevent [[suffocation]] and allow time for other treatments to be used or help to arrive. The effects of epinephrine (adrenaline) are short-lived, and swelling of the throat may return, requiring the use of additional epipens until other drugs can take effect, or more advanced airway methods (such as [[intubation]]) can be established.
*[[Diphenhydramine]] (brand name Benadryl) - Used to treat or prevent anaphylactic shock. Best administered as soon as symptoms appear when impending anaphylactic shock is suspected- Once the airway is restricted, oral drugs can no longer be administered until the airway is clear again, such as after the administration of an epipen. A common recommendation for adults is to take two 25mg pills. Non-solid forms of the drug, such as liquid or dissolving strips, may be absorbed more rapidly than tablets or capsules, and therefore more effective in an emergency.

'''Pain killers'''
*[[Paracetamol]] (also known as Acetaminophen) is one of the most common pain killing medication, as either tablet or syrup
*Anti-inflammatory painkillers such as [[Ibuprofen]], [[Naproxen]] or other [[NSAID]]s can be used as part of treating [[sprain]]s and strains
*[[Codeine]] which is both a painkiller and anti-diarrheal

'''Symptomatic relief'''

* Anti [[diarrhoea]] medication such as [[Loperamide]] - especially important in remote or third world locations where dehydration caused by diarrhea is a leading killer of children
* [[Oral rehydration therapy|Oral rehydration salts]]
*[[Antihistamines|Antihistamine]], such as [[diphenhydramine]]
*Poison treatments
**Absorption, such as [[activated charcoal]]
**[[Emetic]]s to induce vomiting, such as [[syrup of ipecac]] although first aid manuals now advise against inducing vomiting.
*[[Smelling Salts]] ([[ammonium carbonate]])

'''Topical medications'''
*Antiseptics / Disinfectants
**Antiseptic fluid, moist wipe or spray- For cleaning and disinfecting a wound. Typically [[benzalkonium chloride]], which disinfects wounds with minimal stinging or harm to exposed tissue. Can also be used as an antibacterial hand wipe for the person providing aid.
***[[Povidone iodine]] is an antiseptic in the form of liquid, swabstick, or towelette. Can be used in a weak dilution of clean water to prepare an irrigation solution for cleaning a wound.
*** [[Hydrogen peroxide]] is often included in home first aid kits, but is a poor choice for disinfecting wounds- it kills cells and delays healing
**[[isopropyl alcohol|Alcohol]] pads- sometimes included for disinfecting instruments or unbroken skin (for example prior to draining a blister), or cleaning skin prior to applying an adhesive bandage. Alcohol should not be used on an open wound, as it kills skin cells and delays healing.
**Medicated antiseptic ointments- for preventing infection in a minor wound, after it is cleaned. Not typically used on wounds that are bleeding heavily. Ointments typically contain one, two, or all three of the following antibacterial ingredients(those containing all 3 are typically called 'triple-antibiotic ointment') [[Neomycin]], [[Polymyxin B]] Sulphate or [[Bacitracin]] Zinc.
*Burn gel - a water-based gel that acts as a cooling agent and often includes a mild anaesthetic such as [[lidocaine]] and, sometimes, an antiseptic such as [[tea tree oil]]
*Anti-itch ointment
**[[Hydrocortisone]] cream
**[[antihistamine]] cream containing [[diphenhydramine]]
**Calamine lotion, for skin inflammations.
*[[Antifungal medication|Anti-fungal]] cream
*[[Tincture of benzoin]] - often in the form of an individually sealed swabstick or ampule, protects the skin and aids the adhesion of adhesive bandages, such as moleskin, [[Band-Aids]], or wound closure ('butterfly') strips. Benzoin swabsticks are very prone to leaking and making a mess when kept in portable first aid kits, ampules are a more durable option. If swabsticks are used, it is advisable to keep them in a sealed zip lock bag.

==Improvised uses==
Besides the regular uses for first aid kits, they can be helpful in wilderness or survival situations. First aid kits can make up a part of a [[survival kit]] or a [[mini survival kit]] in addition to other tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies/survival-kit-supplies|title=What Do You Need In A Survival Kit?|accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workplace first aid kit==
In the United States, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) requires all job sites and workplaces to make available first aid equipment for use by injured employees
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|last = 29 CFR 1910.151
|title = Occupational Safety and Health Standards: Medical services and first aid.
|date = 1998-06-10
|accessdate = 2006-08-28
|url = http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=9806
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While providing regulations for some industries such as logging
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|last = 29 CFR 1910.266 App A
|title = Occupational Safety and Health Standards: First-aid Kits (Mandatory).
|date = 1995-09-08
|accessdate = 2006-08-28
|url = http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=9863
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
in general the regulation lack specifics on the contents of the first aid kit.  This is understandable, as the regulation covers every means of employment, and different jobs have different types of injuries and different first-aid requirements.  However, in a non-mandatory section,
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|last = 29 CFR 1910.151 App A
|title = Occupational Safety and Health Standards: Appendix A to § 1910.151 -- First aid kits (Non-Mandatory).
|date = 2005-01-05
|accessdate = 2006-08-28
|url = http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=9807
}}&lt;/ref&gt; the OSHA regulations do refer to ANSI/ISEA Specification Z308.1
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|last = ANSI/ISEA
|title = ANSI/ISEA Z308.1-2009, American National Standard - Minimum Requirements for Workplace First Aid Kits and Supplies.
|date = 2009-05-12
|accessdate = 2009-08-25
|url = http://www.safetyequipment.org/c/stdz3081-2009.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
as the basis for the ''suggested'' minimum contents of a first aid kit.  Another source for modern first aid kit information is [[United States Forest Service]] Specification 6170-6
,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|last = U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service
|title = 6170-6H, Kits, First Aid
|date = 2006-01-25
|accessdate = 2009-08-25
|url = http://www.fs.fed.us/t-d/programs/fire/documents/0006/6170_6H.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which specifies the contents of several different-sized kits, intended to serve groups of differing size.

In general, the type of first aid facilities required in a workplace are determined by many factors, such as:
* the laws and regulation of the state or territory in which it is located;
* the type of industry concerned; for example, industries such as mining may have specific industry regulations detailing specialised instructions;
* the type of hazards present in the workplace;
* the number of employees in the workplace;
* the number of different locations that the workplace is spread over;
* the proximity to local services (doctors, hospital, ambulance).

==Historic first aid kits==
[[File:Pharmacie voyage ancienne.jpg|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;Travel pharmacy (early 20th century).&lt;/center&gt;]]
As the understanding of first aid and lifesaving measures has advanced, and the nature of public health risks has changed, the contents of first aid kits have changed to reflect prevailing understandings and conditions. For example, earlier US Federal specifications
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite_web
|last = GG-K-391A GAUZE
|title= Kit (Empty) First-Aid, Burn-Treatment and Snake Bite, and Kit Contents (Unit-Type).
|date = 1954-10-19
|accessdate = 2009-08-24
|url = https://assist.daps.dla.mil/quicksearch/basic_profile.cfm?ident_number=50116}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite_web
|last = GG-K-392
|title = Kit, First Aid (Commercial Types), and Kit Contents.
|date = 1957-04-25
|accessdate = 2009-08-24
|url = https://assist.daps.dla.mil/quicksearch/basic_profile.cfm?ident_number=50118}}&lt;/ref&gt;
for first aid kits included incision/suction-type snakebite kits and mercurochrome antiseptic. There are many historic components no longer used today, of course; some notable examples follow. As explained in the article on [[Snakebite#Outmoded|snakebite]], the historic snakebite kit is no longer recommended. [[Merbromin|Mercurochrome]] was removed in 1998 by the US FDA from the [[generally recognized as safe]] category due to concerns over its mercury content.  Another common item in early 20th century first aid kits, [[picric acid]] gauze for treating burns, is today considered a hazardous material due to its forming unstable and potentially explosive picrates when in contact with metal.  Examples of modern additions include the [[Pocket mask|CPR face shields]] and specific [[Bodily fluid|body-fluid]] barriers included in modern kits, to assist in [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] and to help prevent the spread of bloodborne pathogens such as [[HIV]].

==User criticism==
{{POV-section|date=April 2017}}
Initially GOTD used a technique to protect the installation package that led to a situation where titles previously featured on Giveaway of the Day became available on [[warez]] sites. Some websites provided protection circumvention guides. In July 2012 GOTD team announced a new release of the wrapper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In July 2012 the team announced a new release of the wrapper|url=https://blog.giveawayoftheday.com/gotd-wrapper-is-updated/|accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; integrating Themida software developed by Oreans Technologies &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Themida software developed by Oreans Technologies|url=http://www.oreans.com/themida.php|accessdate=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; into the wrapper as a protection mechanism.

==Mac Giveaway of the Day==
At the end of the 2008 Giveaway announced in the blog their plans to launch similar project for Mac products.&lt;ref name=blog&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.giveawayoftheday.com/monday-morning-news-and-questions-giveawaymac-can-we-do-that/|accessdate=10 February 2008 |title=Monday morning news and questions – Giveaway@Mac? Can we do that?  |publisher=Giveaway of the Day.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the idea was highly appreciated and supported by the users community the project team didn’t step forward with it. Сurrently GOTD occasionally offers Mac applications together with giveaways for Windows (usually by the same developer).

==Game Giveaway of the Day==
On 11 December 2006 a new site was launched, Game Giveaway of the Day, which gave away games each day. Later, these giveaways were restricted to weekends. Since 29 April 2009, the beta website has been giving away games on a monthly basis.

{{Other uses|Hoe (disambiguation)}}

[[File:Peasant in the vegetable garden.JPG|thumb|A farmer using a hoe to keep weeds down in a vegetable garden.]]

A '''hoe''' is an ancient and versatile [[agriculture|agricultural]] and [[horticulture|horticultural]] hand tool used to shape soil, [[weed control|remove weeds]], clear soil, and harvest [[root crop]]s. Shaping the soil includes piling soil around the base of plants ([[hilling]]), digging narrow furrows ([[drill (agriculture)|drills]]) and shallow trenches for planting [[seeds]] or [[bulbs]]. Weeding with a hoe includes agitating the surface of the soil or cutting foliage from roots, and clearing soil of old [[root]]s and [[agriculture|crop]] residues. Hoes for digging and moving soil are used to harvest root crops such as [[potatoes]].

==Types==&lt;!-- Links to this heading exist in other articles --&gt;
There are many kinds of hoes of varied appearances and purposes. Some have multiple functions while others have singular and specific functionality.

[[File:CultivatingToolPullHoe.jpg|thumb|Cultivating tool, a pull or draw hoe]]

There are two general types of hoe: draw hoes for shaping soil and scuffle hoes for weeding and aerating soil.

A '''draw hoe''' has a blade set at approximately a right angle to the shaft. The user chops into the ground and then pulls (draws) the blade towards them. Altering the angle of the handle can cause the hoe to dig deeper or more shallowly as the hoe is pulled. A draw hoe can easily be used to cultivate soil to a depth of several inches. A typical design of draw hoe, the "eye hoe", has a ring in the head through which the handle is fitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Deppe|first1=Carol|title=The Resilient Gardener: Food Production and Self-Reliance in Uncertain Times|date=5 Oct 2010|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|location=White River Junction, Vermont|isbn=9781603583152|page=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xf5Q4jo_mEEC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=%22eye+hoes%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBWoVChMI0vPrjsiPxgIVTCjbCh0rSwDu#v=onepage&amp;q=%22eye%20hoes%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This design has been used since Roman times.

A '''scuffle hoe''' is used to scrape the surface of the soil, loosen the top inch or so, and to cut the roots of, remove, and disrupt the growth of weeds efficiently. These are primarily of two different designs: the Dutch hoe and the hoop hoe.

[[File:Sachos_e_picarañas.jpg|thumb|left|Eye hoe heads, some with sow-tooth ([[:de:Sauzahn (Werkzeug)|German: Sauzahn]]), ''Centro Etnográfico de Soutelo de Montes'', [[Pontevedra]], [[Spain]] ]]
[[File:CultivatingToolPushHoe.jpg|thumb|Cultivating tool, a push or thrust hoe]]

The term "'''hand hoe'''" most commonly refers to any type of light-weight, short-handled hoe, although it may be used simply to contrast hand-held tools against animal or machine pulled tools.

===Draw hoes===

* The '''Paxton hoe''' is similar to the Italian hoe, but with a more rounded rectangular blade.
* The '''flower hoe''' has a very small blade, rendering it useful for light weeding and aerating around growing plants, so as not to disturb their shallow roots while removing weeds beyond the reach of the gardener's arm.

===Scuffle hoes===

* The '''Dutch hoe''' is designed to be pushed or pulled through the soil to cut the roots of weeds just under the surface. A Dutch hoe has a blade "sharp on every side so as to cut either forwards and backwards".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Loudon|first1=John|title=The Horticulturist, Gardening in America Series|date=1871|publisher=Applewood Books|isbn=9781429013680|page=84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GyeicE-T_lgC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=%22thrust+hoes%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GXtPV5QhBE&amp;sig=6HB1YPyA5P5TwhAJRRENwtv3TEc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=K6ZUVc3eCqPV7Aax9YHQCg&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22thrust%20hoes%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blade must be set in a plane slightly upwardly inclined in relation to the dual axis of the shaft. The user pushes the handle to move the blade forward, forcing it below the surface of the soil and maintaining it at a shallow depth by altering the angle of the handle while pushing. A scuffle hoe can easily cultivate soil and remove weeds from the surface layer.

Weeds are cut just below the surface of the soil as the blade is pushed and pulled. The back and forth motion is highly effective at cutting weeds in loose or friable soil. The width of the blade typically ranges between 3-7 inches. The head is a loop of flat, sharpened strap metal. However, it is not as efficient as a draw hoe for moving soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Green|first1=Victor|title=The Scuffle Hoe—A Valuable Tool for Small Plot Work on Non-Rocky Soils|journal=Agronomy Journal|date=1 February 1954|volume=46|issue=2|pages=94–95|doi=10.2134/agronj1954.00021962004600020011x|url=https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/aj/abstracts/46/2/AJ0460020094|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see|Hoe-cultivation belt}}
Hoes are an ancient technology, predating the [[plough]] and perhaps preceded only by the [[digging stick]]. In [[Sumerian mythology]], the invention of the hoe was credited to [[Enlil]], the chief of the council of gods.&lt;ref&gt;PBS. ''Heritage: Civilization and the Jews''. "[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/heritage/episode1/atlas/map2.html# Nippur]". Accessed 26 Nov 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The hand-plough (''mr'') was depicted in [[predynastic Egypt]]ian art, and hoes are also mentioned in ancient documents like the [[Code of Hammurabi]] (ca. 18th century BC) and the [[Book of Isaiah]] (c. 8th century BC).

The human damage caused by long-term use of short-handled hoes, which required the user to bend over from the waist to reach the ground, and caused permanent, crippling [[lower back pain]] to farm workers, resulted, after struggle led by [[César Chávez]] with political help from Governor [[Jerry Brown]] in the [[California Supreme Court]] declaring the short-handled hoe to be an unsafe hand tool that was banned under California law in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fight in the Fields: Cesar Chavez and the Farmworkers' Struggle |url=https://www.pbs.org/itvs/fightfields/book1.html |publisher=Pbs.org| accessdate= December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bruns|first1=Roger|title=Cesar Chavez: A Biography|date=2005|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT|pages=91–92|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QuDvaINavwMC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=chavez+brown+hoe&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BMOzuGDUDT&amp;sig=2dRSfFbR_VaG5JRsu1IyXiHD1NI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBWoVChMIyL6L3I_oyAIVhEAmCh1tYgmf#v=onepage&amp;q=chavez%20brown%20hoe&amp;f=false|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological use==

Over the past fifteen or twenty years, hoes have become increasingly popular tools for professional archaeologists. While not as accurate as the traditional [[trowel]], the hoe is an ideal tool for cleaning relatively large open areas of archaeological interest.  It is faster to use than a trowel, and produces a much cleaner surface than an excavator bucket or shovel-scrape, and consequently on many open-area excavations the once-common line of kneeling archaeologists trowelling backwards has been replaced with a line of stooping archaeologists with hoes.

'''In-circuit test (ICT)''' is an example of [[white box testing]] where an electrical probe tests a populated [[printed circuit board]] (PCB), checking for shorts, opens, resistance, capacitance, and other basic quantities which will show whether the assembly was correctly fabricated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Teradyne|url=http://www.teradyne.com/corp/history.html|publisher=Teradyne Corp|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be performed with a [[#Bed of nails tester|bed of nails type test fixture]] and specialist test equipment, or with a [[fixtureless in-circuit test]] setup.

==Bed of nails tester==

A bed of nails tester is a traditional electronic test fixture which has numerous pins inserted into holes in an epoxy phenolic glass cloth laminated sheet (G-10) which are aligned using tooling pins to make contact with test points on a printed circuit board and are also connected to a measuring unit by [[wire]]s. Named by analogy with a real-world [[bed of nails]], these devices contain an array of small, spring-loaded [[pogo pin]]s; each pogo pin makes contact with one node in the circuitry of the [[device under test|DUT (device under test)]]. By pressing the DUT down against the bed of nails, reliable contact can be quickly and simultaneously made with hundreds or even thousands of individual test points within the circuitry of the DUT. The hold-down force may be provided manually or by means of a [[vacuum]] or a mechanical presser, thus pulling the DUT downwards onto the nails.

Devices that have been tested on a bed of nails tester may show evidence of this after the process: small dimples (from the sharp tips of the Pogo pins) can often be seen on many of the soldered connections of the PCB.

Bed of nails fixtures require a mechanical assembly to hold the PCB in place. Fixtures can hold the PCB with either a vacuum or pressing down from the top of the PCB. Vacuum fixtures give better signal reading versus the press-down type{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}. On the other hand, vacuum fixtures are expensive because of their high manufacturing complexity. Moreover, vacuum fixtures cannot be used on bed-of-nails systems that are used in automated production lines, where the board is automatically loaded to the tester by a handling mechanism.
The bed of nails or fixture, as generally termed, is used together with an in-circuit tester. Fixtures with a grid of 0.8&amp;nbsp;mm for small nails and test point diameter 0.6&amp;nbsp;mm are theoretically possible without using special constructions. But in mass production, test point diameters of 1.0&amp;nbsp;mm or higher are normally used to minimise contact failures leading to lower remachining costs.

This technique of testing PCBs is being slowly superseded by [[boundary scan]] techniques (silicon test nails), [[automated optical inspection]], and [[built-in self-test]], due to shrinking product sizes and lack of space on PCB's for test pads. Nevertheless ICT is used in mass production to detect failures before doing end-of-line test and producing scrap.

==ICT failures &amp; mechanical simulation==
In-circuit testing has been known to cause mechanical failures such as capacitor flex cracking and [[pad cratering]]. This typically occurs on a bed of nails tester if there is excessive board flexure due to poor support placement or high probe forces. It can be challenging to optimize for ideal support locations and probe forces without spending resources designing and building an ICT fixture. Current methods typically employ [[Strain gauge|strain gaging]] or similar techniques to monitor board flexure. More recently, some have looked at [[Finite element method|finite element simulation]] to proactively design or adjust an ICT fixture to avoid these mechanical failure modes. This approach can be implemented as part of a [[design for manufacturability]] methodology to provide rapid feedback on ICT design and reduce costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preventing Pad Cratering During ICT Using Sherlock|url=http://www.dfrsolutions.com/hubfs/Resources/services/Preventing-Pad-Cratering-During-ICT-Using-Sherlock.pdf?hsCtaTracking=95bec082-e4c1-40d3-a379-dfe6d7a5727a%7Ce96e5f51-abc5-4c7a-9a2e-28a78cb24e8e|publisher=DfR Solutions|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example test sequence ==

* Discharging capacitors and especially [[electrolytic capacitor]]s (for safety and measurement stability, this test sequence must be done first before testing any other items)
* Contact Test (To verify the test system is connected to the Unit Under Test (UUT)
* Shorts testing (Test for solder shorts and opens)
* Analog tests (Test all analog components for placement and correct value)
* Test for defective open pins on devices
* Test for capacitor orientation defects
* Power up UUT
* Powered analog (Test for correct operation of analog components such as regulators and opamps)
* Powered digital (Test the operation of digital components and Boundary scan devices)
* [[Joint Test Action Group | JTAG]] Boundary scan tests &lt;ref&gt;Jun Balangue, “Successful ICT Boundary Scan Implementation,” CIRCUITS ASSEMBLY, September 2010. http://www.circuitsassembly.com/cms/magazine/208-2010-issues/10282-testinspection&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Flash Memory]], [[EEPROM]], and other device programming
* Discharging capacitors as UUT is powered down

While in-circuit testers are typically limited to testing the above devices, it is possible to add additional hardware to the test fixture to allow different solutions to be implemented. Such additional hardware includes:

* Cameras to test for presence and correct orientation of components
* [[Photodetector]]s to test for [[LED]] color and intensity
* External timer counter modules to test very high frequencies (over 50&amp;nbsp;MHz) crystals and oscillators
* Signal waveform analysis, e.g. slew rate measurement, envelope curve etc.
* External equipment can be used for hi-voltage measurement (more than 100Vdc due to limitation of voltage that is provided) or AC equipment Source those have interface to PC as the ICT Controller
* [[Bead probe technology]] to access small traces that cannot be accessed by traditional means

== Limitations ==
While in-circuit test is a very powerful tool for testing PCBs, it has these limitations:

* Parallel components can often only be tested as one component if the components are of the same type (i.e. two resistors); though different components in parallel may be testable using a sequence of different tests - e.g. a DC voltage measurement versus a measurement of AC injection current at a node.
* Electrolytic components can be tested for polarity only in specific configurations (e.g. if not parallel connected to power rails) or with a specific sensor
* The quality of electrical contacts can not be tested unless extra test points and/or a dedicated extra cable harness are provided.
* It is only as good as the design of the PCB. If no test access has been provided by the PCB designer then some tests will not be possible. See [[Design For Test]] guidelines.

== Related technologies ==
The following are related technologies and are also used in electronic production to test for the correct operation of Electronics Printed Circuit boards

* JTAG [[Joint Test Action Group]] ([[Boundary Scan]] Technology)
* AOI [[automated optical inspection]]

'''Ken Cook''' is president and co-founder of the [[Environmental Working Group]] (EWG), a non-profit, non-partisan organization dedicated to protecting human health and the environment. Cook has written dozens of articles, opinion pieces, and reports on environmental, public health, and agricultural topics. He has been an active lobbyist for over 20 years.
==Career==
Cook has been named as one of Washington's Top Lobbyists by ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'' and ''[[The Huffington Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ken Cook President and Founder of the Environmental Working Group|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ken-cook/gIQABO3RAP_topic.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/4086-top-lobbyists-grassroots |title=Top Lobbyists: Grassroots|accessdate=2009-11-12|author=The Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has made multiple appearances on ''[[The News Hour with Jim Lehrer|The News Hour With Jim Lehrer]]'', CBS's ''[[60 Minutes]]'', [[National Public Radio]], and the evening newscasts of [[American Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]], [[National Broadcasting Corporation|NBC]], [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]], and [[Cable News Network|CNN]] among other programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ken Cook|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/don-carr|publisher=HuffingtonPost.com|accessdate=26 April 2012|first=Don|last=Carr}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cook started the [[Environmental Working Group]] in 1993, and since its inception they have provided research geared to reforming agriculture policy, advancing conservation techniques and environmental protection. At the onset of debate over the 1995 Farm Bill, the EWG compiled information on who received the money set aside for conservation efforts. The data sets "sift[ed] through a complex web of corporations, partnerships and other business entities," which allowed the USDA to assign specific dollar amounts to the individuals behind the businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New light shed on farm subsidy payments|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19174311/ns/politics/t/new-light-shed-farm-subsidy-payments/#.T5icJ9UZ33A|publisher=msnbc.com|accessdate=26 April 2012|author=Associated Press|date=2007-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1990s, EWG’s research was a major factor in the passage of the landmark pesticide reform law, the [[Food Quality Protection Act]]. EWG was among the first to draw attention to the health threat posed by the weed-killer atrazine and conducted the first extensive tests for the chemical in tap water in 29 Midwest cities. In the last several years Cook and EWG have been in the forefront of national and state campaigns to require the labeling of foods that contain genetically engineered ingredients.

A front-page profile in the ''[[Omaha World Herald]]'' in 1996 said, "Cook's fingerprints can be found on nearly two decades of U.S. farm law." In 2000, [[Progressive Farmer]] named Cook one of agriculture's most influential leaders in the 20th Century, alongside advocates like [[Rachel Carson]] and [[Aldo Leopold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ken Cook|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/don-carr|publisher=HuffingtonPost.com|accessdate=26 April 2012|first=Don|last=Carr}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cook has appeared as himself in the documentaries ''[[King Corn (film)|King Corn]]'' (2007), ''[[The World According to Monsanto]]'' (2008), ''[[A Place at the Table]]'' (2012), and ''Pricele$$'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3520679 IMDB entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cook is a board member of Food Policy Action (and founding chairman), Organic Voices and the [[Amazon Conservation Team]] and a former member of the board of the Organic Center

==Personal==
Cook graduated from the [[University of Missouri]] in [[Columbia, Missouri]] with an M.S. in Soil Science. He is married to environmental leader [[Deb Callahan]].  Ken is a native of [[Affton, Missouri]] and went to Vianney High School.

Cook also has a B.A. in history and a B.S. in agriculture.

A '''loupe''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|uː|p}} {{respell|LOOP|'}}) is a simple, small [[magnification]] device used to see small details more closely. Unlike a [[magnifying glass]], a loupe does not have an attached handle, and its [[Focus (optics)|focusing]] [[Lens (optics)|lens(es)]] are contained in an [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] or [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] or fold into an enclosing housing that protects the lenses when not in use. Loupes are also called '''hand lenses'''.

== Optics ==
[[File:Magnification power of a loupe.png|thumb|Diagram of a single lens loupe]]
Three basic types of loupes exist:
* Simple lenses, generally used for low-magnification designs because of high [[optical aberration]].
* [[Compound lens]]es, generally used for higher magnifications to control optical aberration.
* Prismatic, multiple lenses with prisms.

== Uses ==
Loupes are used in a number of industries, notably the [[jewelry]] trade, watchmaking, photography, printing, [[dentistry]], [[education]] and [[ophthalmology]]. Loupes are also used in academia and life sciences, such as [[geology]] and [[biology]]. Amateur naturalists may also find a hand lens or a loupe a useful tool when looking at or identifying species. They are also used in [[numismatics]] and stamp collecting.

=== Jewelers and gemologists ===
[[File:BelOMO 10× achromatic triplet loupe 1.jpg|thumb|[[BelOMO]] 10× [[Achromatic lens|achromatic]] [[triplet lens|triplet]] jewellers' loupe]]
Jewelers typically use a [[monocular]], handheld loupe in order to magnify [[gemstone]]s and other jewelry that they wish to inspect.&lt;ref name="howto"&gt;[http://jewelry.about.com/od/jewelryappraisal/ss/loupe.htm "Jewelry - How to Use a Loupe - Using Jewelry Magnifiers"]. Jewelry.About.com&lt;/ref&gt; A 10× magnification is good to use for inspecting jewelry and [[hallmarks]]&lt;ref name="howto" /&gt; and is the [[Gemological Institute of America]]'s standard for grading [[diamond clarity]]. Stones will sometimes be inspected at higher magnifications than 10×, although the depth of field, which is the area in focus, becomes too small to be instructive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gemsociety.org/article/10x-loupe-the-gemologists-best-friend/|title=10X Loupe for Gemologists and Jewelers|publisher=International Gem Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accepted standard for grading diamonds is therefore that inclusions and blemishes visible at 10× impact the clarity grade.&lt;ref name= "diamond-education-center"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leibish.com/diamond-clarity-article-483|publisher=Leibish &amp; Co|title=The 4C's Of Diamonds: Diamond Clarity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Watchmaking ===
Loupes are employed to assist watchmakers in assembling mechanical watches. Many aspects require the use of the loupe, in particular the assembly of the watch mechanism itself, the assembly and details of the watch dial, as well as the formation of the watch strap and installation of precious stones onto the watch face. Some families like Kruder which were into watchmaking and working with glass started producing high-quality loupes in addition to their watches{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Photography===
Analog ([[film]]) photographers use loupes to review, edit or analyze [[Photographic film|negatives]] and [[Reversal film|slides]] on a [[light table]]. Typical magnifications for viewing slides full-frame depend on image format; 35&amp;nbsp;mm frames (24×36&amp;nbsp;mm slides to 38×38&amp;nbsp;mm superslides) are best viewed at ca. 5×, while ca. 3× is optimal for viewing medium format slides (6×4.5&amp;nbsp;cm / 6×6&amp;nbsp;cm / 6×7&amp;nbsp;cm). Often, a 10× loupe is used to examine critical sharpness. Photographers using [[large format]] cameras also use a loupe to view the [[ground glass]] image to aid in focusing. [[Digital single-lens reflex camera|DSLR]] camera users also use loupes to help to identify dust and other particles on the sensor, in preparation for sensor cleaning.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Printing===
[[File:Comptefilsperso.png|thumb|Foldable printers, or [[linen tester]]s]]
Offset and flexographic printing see frequent use of loupes in order to carefully analyze how ink lies on paper. Strippers use loupes in order to register film separations to one another. Pressmen use them to check registration of colors, estimate dot-gain, and diagnose issues with roller pressure and chemistry based on the shape of individual dots and rosettes.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Dentistry===

Dental loupes aid [[dentist]]s, [[Dental hygienist|hygienist]]s, and [[dental therapist]]s to devise accurate diagnoses of oral conditions and enhance surgical precision when completing treatment. Additionally, loupes can improve dentists' posture which can decrease occupational strain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Friedman|first=Mark J.|date=2004-01-01|title=Magnification in a restorative dental practice: from loupes to microscopes|journal=Compendium of Continuing Education in Dentistry (Jamesburg, N.J.: 1995)|volume=25|issue=1|pages=48, 50, 53–55|issn=1548-8578|pmid=15645879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dental caries, also known as cavities, are most accurately identified by visual and tactile examination of a clean, dry tooth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cda-adc.ca/jcda/vol-67/issue-8/454.html|title=Diagnosis of Occlusal Caries: Part I. Conventional Methods|website=www.cda-adc.ca|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnification enables dentists to improve their ability to differentiate between a stain and a cavity. Cavities are rated and scored based on their visual presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icdas.org/uploads/ICCMS-Guide_Full_Guide_UK.pdf|title=ICCMS Caries Management|last=|first=|date=|website=www.icdas.org|publisher=ICDAS|access-date=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; If magnification is too high diagnosis becomes difficult due to the small field of view. Ideal magnification for diagnostic purposes is up to 2×.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neuhaus|first=K. W.|last2=Jost|first2=F.|last3=Perrin|first3=P.|last4=Lussi|first4=A.|date=2015-12-01|title=Impact of different magnification levels on visual caries detection with ICDAS|journal=Journal of Dentistry|volume=43|issue=12|pages=1559–1564|doi=10.1016/j.jdent.2015.09.002|issn=1879-176X|pmid=26366524}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sisodia|first=Neha|last2=Manjunath|first2=M.K.|date=2014-08-01|title=Impact of Low Level Magnification on Incipient Occlusal Caries Diagnosis and Treatment Decision Making|journal=Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research|volume=8|issue=8|pages=ZC32–ZC35|doi=10.7860/JCDR/2014/8533.4742|issn=2249-782X|pmc=4190790|pmid=25302264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment of dental caries, periodontal disease, and pulpal disease are all aided by magnification.

The dental specialty of endodontics has performed the vast majority of research regarding magnification in dentistry. Because the identification of accessory canals in addition to the primary pulp canals is essential to complete nonsurgical root canal therapy, magnification provides dentists enhanced visualization to locate and treat more obscured canals.

Treatment of periodontal disease is achieved by removing calculus deposits, plaque and therefore bacteria which causes inflammation and subsequently bone destruction. In severe cases, surgery to reduce pocket depth is indicated. Periodontists and hygienists must visualize plaque and calculus to remove it. Magnification can assist dentists and hygienists with identification and removal of plaque and calculus in addition to improving visualization for periodontal surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayes|first=Mj|last2=Taylor|first2=Ja|last3=Smith|first3=Dr|date=2015-02-17|title=Introducing loupes to clinical practice: dental hygienists experiences and opinions|journal=International Journal of Dental Hygiene|doi=10.1111/idh.12128|issn=1601-5037|pmid=25690424|volume=14|pages=226–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Smallest loupe light .jpg|thumb|left|A pair of dental loupes featuring in-lens magnification. There is a [[loupe light]] mounted on the bridge of the loupes and side shields (not shown) on the temples to protect a dentist's eyes from splatter.]]
As dental professionals use both hands in performing dental procedures, dental loupes are [[binocular vision|binocular]] and usually take the form of a pair of [[glasses]]. Some dental loupes are flip-type, which take the form of two small cylinders, one in front of each lens of the glasses. Other types are inset within the lens of the glasses. A typical magnification for use in dentistry is 2.5×, but dental loupes can be anywhere in the range from 2× to 8×.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Together with proper access to the oral cavity, [[Lamp (electrical component)|light]] is an important part of performing precision dentistry. Because a dentist's head often [[eclipse]]s the overhead dental lamp, loupes may be fitted with a light source. Loupe-mounted lights used to be fed by [[fiber optic]] cables that connected to either a wall-mounted or table-top light source. Newer models feature a more convenient [[LED]] lamp within the loupe-mounted light and an electric cord coming from either the conventional wall-mounted or table-top light source or a belt clip [[rechargeable battery]] pack. Options for loupe-mounted [[camera]]s and video recorders are also available.&lt;ref name="loupe-camera"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futudent.com/features.html|title=Futudent HD Camera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surgery===
[[File:Cardiac surgeon wearing loupes.jpg|thumb|Cardiac surgeon wearing surgical loupes]]
Surgeons in many specialties commonly use loupes when doing surgery on delicate structures. The loupes used by surgeons are mounted in the lenses of glasses and are custom made for the individual surgeon, taking into account their corrected vision, interpupillary distance and desired focal distance. Multiple magnification powers are available. They are most commonly used in [[otolaryngology]], [[neurosurgery]], [[plastic surgery]], [[cardiac surgery]], [[orthopedic surgery]], and [[vascular surgery]].

===Geology===
[[File:LoupeEZ.jpg|thumb|Loupe used by a geologist]]
The loupe (hand lens) is a vital geological field tool used to identify small mineral crystals and structures in rocks.

===Biology===
Loupes are used by professional and amateur field biologists for help identifying species in field situations where a full-sized microscope is impractical, but the ability to observe small morphological characteristics is desired. Many [[Flora (publication)|floras]] and [[Single-access key|diagnostic keys]] for identifying plant or animal species recommend the use of a loupe, because taxa may be separated by minute details like the presence of hairs, shapes of hairs and glands.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Meteoritics===
Scientists in the meteoritics and planetary science field as well as private collectors of meteorites use loupes as one of their primary tools in meteorite classification and study, and also for simple examination in the field during meteorite recovery.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Electronics===
Due to the extremely small size of many modern [[Surface-mount technology|surface-mount]] components used in compact electronics, engineers often use a loupe to inspect the completed [[Printed circuit board|circuit board]] for manufacturing defects such as solder bridging and missing or misaligned components. While soldering or reworking surface-mount components by hand a loupe can be used for identifying and aligning parts. Due to the ever-decreasing size of electronic components, magnification is increasingly required for circuit assembly.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Tattooing===
Tattoo artists use loupes to inspect the quality of their needle tips. They do this to ensure the least amount of damage possible to the skin surface.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Numismatists and coin collectors===
Loupes are an essential tool in both [[numismatics]], the study of currency, and the related practice of [[coin collecting|coin collection]]. [[Coin]] collectors frequently employ loupes for better evaluation of the quality of their coins, since identifying surface wear is vital when attempting to classify the grade of a coin. Uncirculated coins (coins without wear) can command a substantial premium over coins with slight wear. This wear cannot always be seen with the naked eye. Numismatists can also employ loupes to identify some [[counterfeit]] coins that would pass a naked-eye visual inspection.

===Philatelists and stamp collectors===
[[Stamp collecting|Stamp collectors]] employ loupes to improve their ability to evaluate the quality of their stamps. Identifying surface, adhesive, and perforation is vital when attempting to classify the grade of a stamp. Mint stamps (stamps without cancellations) with no wear can command a substantial premium over mint stamps with slight wear. This wear cannot always be seen with the naked eye. Practitioners of [[philately]], the study of postage and revenue stamps, also employ loupes to identify counterfeit stamps that would pass naked-eye inspections.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Sharpening===
Sharpeners of knives or other edged or pointed tools may use a loupe to inspect the tool and ensure correct angle, straightness of the bevel, a sharp edge and/or point, and a polished finish.

'''MDNX''' was a private telecommunications company located in [[Bracknell]] and [[London]]. In December 2013 MDNX acquired the entire issued share capital of [[Easynet]], a global provider of managed networking, hosting and cloud integration services, from [[Lloyds Development Capital|LDC]]. The combined business went  by the name of Easynet. Its [[Chief Executive Officer|CEO]] was Mark Thompson&lt;ref name="bw"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=39196771 |title=MDNX |accessdate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The company was acquired by [[Interoute]] in September 2015.

MDNX's origins lie in the former [[Siemens]] service group company, 'Solution1'.  Thompson and colleague Wayne Churchill joined Solution1 in 2009, and decided to set up MDNX. Within months MDNX bought out 'Solution1'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solution1.co.uk/|title=Solution1 |accessdate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with its customer base, acquired the retail section of ''[[Viatel]]'', gaining fibre network and hosting sites, and CI-Net with [[Cloud computing|cloud]] and [[Wireless network|wireless]] capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbmagazine.co.uk/Comms_Business_Feature.cfm?FeatureID=770 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120724001929/http://www.cbmagazine.co.uk/Comms_Business_Feature.cfm?FeatureID=770 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 July 2012 |title=Cloud ready |magazine=Computer Business Magazine |accessdate=10 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new company brand launched in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012 MDNX was one of 12 companies that successfully bid for the provision of services to the UK [[Public Services Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/government-computing-network/2012/mar/23/psn-connectivity-framework-networks |title=PSN connectivity framework suppliers revealed |date=23 March 2012 |newspaper=The Guardian |first=Jo |last=Best |accessdate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012 MDNX acquired Octium (trading as Griffin and Iconnyx).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MDNX snaps up Octium|url=http://www.insidermedia.com/insider/south-east/75023-griffin-snapped-mdnx/|website=Insider Media|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013 MDNX acquired [[Easynet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shead|first1=Sam|title=MDNX to acquire rival Easynet in telecoms deal|url=http://news.techworld.com/networking/3493589/mdnx-to-acquire-rival-easynet-in-telecoms-deal/|website=Techworld|publisher=IDG|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015 Interoute announced agreement to acquire MDNX (trading as Easynet) for £402m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Easynet swallowed by Interoute in £402m acquisition|url=http://www.channelweb.co.uk/crn-uk/news/2424992/easynet-swallowed-by-interoute-in-gbp402m-acquisition|website=Channel Web|publisher=CRM|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''megaproject''' is an extremely large-scale [[investment]] [[project]].&lt;ref name="cost"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[European Cooperation in Science and Technology]] |url=http://www.cost.eu/COST_Actions/tud/Actions/TU1003 |title= Megaproject: The Effective Design and Delivery of Megaprojects in the EU }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{TOC limit|5}}

==Definition==
According to the ''Oxford Handbook of Megaproject Management'', "Megaprojects are large-scale, complex ventures that typically cost $1 billion or more, take many years to develop and build, involve multiple public and private stakeholders, are transformational, and impact millions of people".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= |title= The Oxford Handbook of Megaproject Management |last= Flyvbjerg |first=Bent |publisher= Oxford University Press |year=2017 |isbn= 978-0198732242 |location= |pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, $1 billion is not a constraint in defining megaprojects; in some contexts a relative approach is needed, such as in developing countries, where a much smaller project (such as one with a $100 million budget) could constitute a megaproject. Therefore, a more general definition is "Megaprojects are temporary endeavours (i.e. projects) characterized by: large investment commitment, vast complexity (especially in organizational terms), and long-lasting impact on the economy, the environment, and society".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Brookes |first=Naomi J.|last2= Locatelli |first2=Giorgio |date= 2015-10-01 |title= Power plants as megaprojects: Using empirics to shape policy, planning, and construction management |url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957178715300217 |journal= Utilities Policy |volume=36 |pages= 57–66 |doi= 10.1016/j.jup.2015.09.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[European Cooperation in Science and Technology]] (COST), megaprojects are characterized both by "extreme complexity (both in technical and human terms) and by a long record of poor delivery".&lt;ref name="cost" /&gt; Megaprojects attract a lot of public attention because of substantial impacts on [[Community|communities]], [[Environmental issue|environment]], and [[budget]]s, and the high costs involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quote=Prior to the enactment of SAFETEA-LU in August 2005, projects with over $1 billion in construction costs were designated as "Mega Projects". SAFETEA-LU has lowered the monetary threshold from an estimated total cost of $1 billion to $500 million or greater, and the term "Mega Project" has since been eliminated and replaced with the term "Major Project."|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ipd/project_delivery/defined/|title=Project Delivery Defined|publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Megaprojects can also be defined as "initiatives that are physical, very expensive, and public".&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan A. Altshuler|Alan Altshuler]] and David Luberoff, ''Mega-Projects: The Changing Politics of Urban Public Investment'' (Washington, DC: Brookings Institution, 2003). {{ISBN|0-8157-0129-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bent Flyvbjerg]], a professor at the [[Saïd Business School]] of the [[University of Oxford]] says that globally, megaprojects make up 8 percent of total GDP.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=2424835 |title=What You Should Know About Megaprojects and Why: An Overview|date=7 Apr 2014|work=Project Management Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Care in the project development process is required to reduce any possible [[optimism bias]] and [[strategic misrepresentation]], as a curious paradox exists in which more and more megaprojects are being proposed despite their consistently poor performance against initial forecasts of budget, schedule, and benefits.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bent Flyvbjerg]], Nils Bruzelius and Werner Rothengatter, ''[[Megaprojects and Risk]]: An Anatomy of Ambition'' (Cambridge UK, Cambridge University Press, 2003). {{ISBN|0-521-00946-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Megaprojects are often affected by corruption leading to higher cost and lower benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Locatelli |first= Giorgio |last2= Mariani |first2= Giacomo |last3= Sainati |first3= Tristano |last4= Greco |first4= Marco |date= 2017-04-01 |title= Corruption in public projects and megaprojects: There is an elephant in the room! |url= http://www.sciencedirect.co/science/article/pii/S0263786316301090 |journal=International Journal of Project Management |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages= 252–268 |doi= 10.1016/j.ijproman.2016.09.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
{{main article|List of megaprojects|List of transport megaprojects}}

Megaprojects include [[bridge]]s, [[tunnel]]s, [[highway]]s, [[rail transport|railways]], [[airport]]s, [[seaport]]s, [[power station|power plants]], [[dam]]s, [[wastewater]] projects, [[Special Economic Zone]]s, [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]] [[Resource extraction|extraction]] projects, [[public building]]s, [[information technology]] systems, [[aerospace]] projects, [[weapons system]]s, large-scale [[sporting event]]s and, more recently, mixed use waterfront redevelopments; however, the most common megaprojects are in the categories of [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] facilities, nuclear power plants, and large public transportation projects. Megaprojects can also include large-scale high-cost initiatives in scientific research and infrastructure, such as the sequencing of the [[human genome project|human genome]], a significant global advance in [[genetics]] and [[biotechnology]].

According to Bent Flyvbjerg, "As a general rule of thumb, 'megaprojects' are measured in billions of dollars, 'major projects' in hundreds of millions, and 'projects' in millions and tens of millions."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Rationale==
The logic {{by who?|date=April 2017}} on which many of the typical megaprojects are built is collective benefits; for example electricity for everybody (who can pay), road access (for those that have cars), etc.  They may also serve as the means for opening frontiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Political Economy of Very Large Space Projects|url=http://www.jetpress.org/volume4/space.htm|publisher=Journal of Evolution and Technology|accessdate=16 November 2015|date=November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Megaprojects have undergone a wide criticism for their top down planning processes and for their ill effects on certain communities. Large scale projects often advantage one group of people while disadvantaging another, for instance, the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China is the largest hydroelectric project in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Three Gorges breaks world record for hydropower generation|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2015-01/01/c_127352471.htm|publisher=Xinhua|accessdate=2 January 2015|date=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but required the displacement of 1.2 million farmers.&lt;ref name="bbc12102007"&gt;{{cite news

More recently, new types of megaprojects have been identified that no longer follow the old models of being singular and monolithic in their purposes, but have become quite flexible and diverse, such as waterfront redevelopment schemes that seem to offer something to everybody.{{how?|date=April 2017}} However, just like the old megaprojects, the new ones also foreclose "upon a wide variety of social practices, reproducing rather than resolving urban inequality and disenfranchisement".&lt;ref name=lehrer&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lehrer|first1=U. |last2=Laidley|first2=J. |title=Old Mega-projects Newly Packaged? Waterfront Redevelopment in Toronto |journal=International Journal for Urban and Regional Research |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=786–803 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their plethora of land uses "these mega-projects inhibit the growth of oppositional and contestational practices".&lt;ref name=lehrer /&gt; The collective benefits that are often the underlying logic of a mega-project, are here reduced to an individualized form of public benefit.

Bent Flyvbjerg argues that policymakers are attracted to megaprojects for four reasons:

* Technological sublime: the rapture that engineers and technologists get from building large and innovative projects, pushing the boundaries for what technology can do.
* Political sublime: the rapture politicians get from building monuments to themselves and for their causes.
* Economic sublime: the delight business people and trade unions get from making lots of money and jobs from megaprojects.
* Aesthetic sublime: the pleasure designers and people who appreciate good design get from building, using, and looking at something very large that is also iconically beautiful.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Economics==
Proponents of [[infrastructure-based development]] advocate for funding large-scale projects to create long-term economic benefits. Investing in megaprojects in order to stimulate the general economy has been a popular policy measure since the economic crisis of the 1930s. Recent examples are the 2008–2009 [[Chinese economic stimulus program]], the [[2008 European Union stimulus plan]], and the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]].

Megaprojects often raise capital based on expected returns—though projects often go overbudget and over time, and market conditions like commodity prices can change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/crude-oil-fall-squeezes-megaprojects-1418086469|title=Crude Oil’s Fall Pressures Energy Megaprojects|work=Wall Street Journal|date=8 Dec 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concern at cost overruns is often expressed by critics of megaprojects during the planning phase. Bent Flyvbjerg has noted the existence of incentives to overstate income, underestimate costs, and exaggerate future social and economic benefits due to lack of accountability and risk-sharing mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Flyvberg, B., Bruzelius, N.,  Rothengatter, W. Megaprojects and Risk: An Anatomy of Ambition. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; If the megaproject is delivered in a country with relevant corruption the likelihood and magnitude of having overbudgets increases. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Locatelli |first=Giorgio |last2=Mariani |first2=Giacomo |last3=Sainati |first3=Tristano |last4=Greco |first4=Marco|date=2017-04-01|title=Corruption in public projects and megaprojects: There is an elephant in the room! |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263786316301090 |journal=International Journal of Project Management |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=252–268 |doi=10.1016/j.ijproman.2016.09.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most challenging aspects of megaprojects is obtaining sufficient funding. Alan Altshuler and David Luberoff have found that creative and politically adept political leadership is required to secure resources as well as generate public support, mollify critics, and manage conflict through many years of planning, authorization and implementation.&lt;ref&gt;Altshuler, Alan and David Luberoff. Mega-Projects: The Changing Politics of Urban Public Investment. Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Other challenges faced by those planning megaprojects include laws and regulations that empower community groups, contested information and methodologies, high levels of uncertainty, avoiding impacts on neighborhoods and the environment, and attempting to solve a [[wicked problem]].&lt;ref&gt;Plotch, Philip Mark. What’s Taking So Long? Identifying the Underlying Causes of Delays in Planning Transportation Megaprojects in the United States. Journal of Planning Literature. Available online January 8, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

A megaproject's economic failures (and successes) have common characteristics. According to John Cunningham, assessing their success, or failure, can be accomplished by benchmarking their performance against these common characteristics in order to mitigate failure and turn a troubled megaproject around.&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, John (2015), "Mega Project Benchmarking: In the 21st Century", Retrieved: 27 January 2016: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/mega-project-bench-marking-21st-century-john-m-cunningham-1?trk=pulse_spock-articles&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Metadesign''' (or meta-design) is an emerging conceptual framework aimed at defining and creating social, economic and technical infrastructures in which new forms of collaborative [[design]] can take place. It consists of a series of practical design-related tools for achieving this.

As a methodology, its aim is to nurture emergence of the previously unthinkable as possibilities or prospects through the [[collaboration]] of designers within [[interdisciplinarity]] 'metadesign' teams. Inspired by the way living systems work, this new field aims to help improve the way we feed, clothe, shelter, assemble, communicate and live together.

[[File:PinesCalyx STORY 32.jpg|thumb|right|Team members working in a metadesign workshop organized by researchers at Goldsmiths, University of London (2008)]]

==History==

Metadesign has been initially put forward as an [[industrial design]] approach to [[Complexity|complexity theory]] and [[information systems]] by Dutch designer Andries Van Onck in 1963, while at [[Ulm School of Design]] (later at [[Politecnico di Milano]] and Rome and Florence [[Istituto superiore per le industrie artistiche (ISIA)|ISIA]]). Since then, several different design, creative and research approaches have used the name "Metadesign", ranging from [[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela]]'s biological approach, to [[Gerhard Fischer (professor)|Gerhard Fischer]]'s and Elisa Giaccardi's &lt;ref&gt;Fischer, G., &amp; Giaccardi, E. (2006) "Meta-Design: A Framework for the Future of End User Development." In H. Lieberman, F. Paternò, &amp; V. Wulf (Eds.), End User Development — Empowering people to flexibly employ advanced information and communication technology, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands, pp. 427-457. http://l3d.cs.colorado.edu/~gerhard/papers/EUD-meta-design-online.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; techno-social approach, and [[Paul Virilio]]'s techno-policital approach.

Later on, a very active group was present at [[Politecnico di Milano]], and several different universities and graduate programs began applying Metadesign in design teaching around the world generally based at Van Onck's approach, further developed at Politecnico di Milano. Nevertheless, there's a very active, but widely dispersed, group that base their activities at Maturana and Varela's approach.

More recently, some efforts have been made to systematize Metadesign as a structured creative process, such as (1) Fischer's and Giaccardi's and (2) Caio Vassão's academic works,&lt;ref&gt;GIACCARDI, Elisa. (2003) Principles of Metadesign: processes and levels of co-creation in the new design space. 2003. Doctorate thesis [http://x.i-dat.org/~eg/research/pdf/Giaccardi_PhD04.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vassão, Caio Adorno. Arquitetura livre: complexidade, metadesign e ciência nômade. ("Free Architecture: complexity, metadesign and nomad science"). 2008. Doctorate thesis (in Portuguese). [http://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/16/16134/tde-17032010-140902/pt-br.php]&lt;/ref&gt; among several others, based on a much wider reference frame, ranging from [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist philosophy]], [[Neil Postman]]'s media ecology, [[Christopher Alexander]]'s pattern languages and [[deep ecology]].

This variety of approaches is justified by the myriad interpretations that can be derived from the [[etymological]] structure of the term.

==Re-designing design==
The Greek word '[[meta]]' originally meant 'beside' or 'after' but is now also used to imply the possibility of change or transformation, including self-transformation. Metadesign can therefore allude to a possible design practice that (re)designs itself (see Maturana and Varela's term [[autopoiesis]]). The idea of Metadesign acknowledges that future uses and problems cannot be completely anticipated at design time. [[Aristotle]]'s influential theory of [[design]] defined it by saying that the 'cause' of design was its final state. This [[teleological]] perspective is similar to the orthodox idea of an economic payback at the point of sale, rather than successive stages when the product could be seen to achieve high levels of perceived value, throughout the whole [[design cycle]]. Some supporters of metadesign hope that it will extend the traditional notion of [[system design]] beyond the original development of a system by allowing users to become co-designers.

==The importance of languaging==
By harnessing creative teamwork within a suitable [[co-design]] framework, some metadesigners have sought to catalyse changes at a behavioural level.&lt;ref&gt;(Wood, J., (2007), "Win-Win-Win-Win-Win-Win: synergy tools for metadesigners", a chapter in "Designing for the 21st Century, Interdisciplinary Questions and Insights" book, (ed. Thomas Inns) Gower Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-566-08737-0}}, December 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; However, as [[Einstein]] said, "We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them". This points to a need for appropriate innovation at all levels, including the metaphorical language that serves to sustain a given paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;(Wood, J., (2013), "Metadesigning Paradigm Change: an ecomimetic, language-centred approach", a chapter in Handbook of Design for Sustainability, edited by Stuart Walker &amp; Jacques Giroud (Berg), 2013 (AT PRESS))&lt;/ref&gt; In practical terms this adds considerable complexity to the task of managing actions and outcomes. What may be so neatly described as 'new knowledge', in practical terms, exists as an interpersonal and somatic web of [[tacit knowledge]] that needs to be interpreted and applied by many collaborators.&lt;ref&gt;(Backwell, J., &amp; Wood, J., (2011), Catalysing Network Consciousness in Leaderless Groups: A Metadesign Tool, in Consciousness Reframed 12, Art, Identity and the Technology of the Transformation, editors Roy Ascott &amp; Luis Miguel Girão, University of Aveiro, Portugal, pp. 36-41)&lt;/ref&gt; This tends to reduce the semantic certainty of roles, actions and descriptors within a given team,&lt;ref&gt;(Wood, J., &amp; Backwell, J., (2009), "Mapping Network Consciousness: syncretizing difference to co-create a synergy-of-synergies", chapter in New Realities: Being Syncretic, Ixth Consciousness Reframed Conference Vienna, 2008. Series: Edition Angewandte Ascott, R.; Bast, G.; Fiel, W.; Jahrmann, M.; Schnell, R. (Eds.) 2009, {{ISBN|978-3-211-78890-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; making it necessary to rename particular shared experiences that seem inappropriately defined. In other instances it may be necessary to invent new words to describe perceived gaps in what can be discussed within a prevailing vernacular. [[Humberto Maturana]]'s work on [[distributed language]] and the field of [[biosemiotics]] is germane to this task.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Some researchers have used [[bisociation]]&lt;ref&gt;(Koestler, 1964)&lt;/ref&gt; in order to create an auspicious synergy of benign synergies.&lt;ref&gt;(Fuller, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; In aspiring to this outcome, metadesign teams will cultivate auspicious 'diversities-of-diversities'. It suggests that metadesign would offer a manifold ethical space. In this respect, related approaches include what [[Arthur Koestler]] (1967) called [[holarchy]], or what [[John Dewey]] and [[John Chris Jones]] have called 'creative democracy'.

==Metadesign conceptual tools==
Regarding a wide range of applications and contexts, Vassão has argued that Metadesign can be understood as a set of four "conceptual tools", utilizing [[Gilles Deleuze]]'s understanding of the term "tool":
# Levels of abstraction (the ability to understand the structure and limits of abstractions, language and instrumental thinking);
# Diagrams and topology (the use of diagrammatic thinking and design, sustained by topological understanding);
# Procedural design (the creation of realities through the use of procedures, such as in game and role playing, as well as in procedural design, art and architecture);
# Emergence (the absence of absolute control, and the ability to take advantage of unintended and unforeseen results).

Vassão has argued that, in all different approaches to metadesign, the presence of these conceptual tools can be verified.&lt;ref&gt;Vassão, Caio Adorno. Metadesign: ferramentas, estratégias e ética para a complexidade. ("Metadesign: tools, strategies and ethics towards complexity." Blucher, São Paulo, 2010. (in Portuguese) [http://www.blucher.com.br/livro.asp?Codlivro=05579]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
[[File:Missha original logo.jpg|thumbnail|Original logo]]
On August 22, 2007, a court ruled Missha was guilty of trademark infringement against [[Mary Quant|Mary Quant Cosmetics]]. Missha's original flower logo was determined to be too similar to the Mary Quant Daisy logo. Missha was fined {{SK won|3 million}} and the ruling stated that "Although Missha’s trademark combines a diagram and letters and has different colors compared to the trademark of the Mary Quant Cosmetics, there are reasonable concerns that the identical shapes of the diagrams could hurt the brand recognition of the plaintiff and may confuse customers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leeinternational.com/eng/patent/info/letter_view.html?nlSn=5&amp;nlDSn=24 |title=Missha, a Domestic Cosmetic Brand, Fined for Infringement |work=Lee International IP &amp; Law Group |accessdate=12 January 2013 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was required to change its logo, because under Korean copyright law, companies cannot use symbols that are similar in shape to a previously-registered trademark but only differ in color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Seo|first=Ji-eun|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2809593|title=Cosmetics company guilty of copying a rival’s logo|work=Jongang Daily|date=6 September 2006|accessdate=12 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130127155109/http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2809593|archivedate=27 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closure==
On January 2, 2015, all 20 Missha stores in Hong Kong and Macau were closed and all staff left the stores the same day. Various notices were posted at the stores, stating that "Missha is no longer available to serve you. We apologize for any inconvenience caused" and "under construction".

According to a local newspaper, Apple Daily, an employee received a WhatsApp message from a head-office colleague at about noon, saying that "The boss is gone. Everyone can leave." As reported, Missha owes the former staff over HK$1 million for salary and severance payments.&lt;ref&gt;http://nextplus.nextmedia.com/news/spot/20150102/132220&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1673101/korean-cosmetics-firm-missha-suddenly-closes-hong-kong-outlets&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://hk.news.yahoo.com/missha%E6%B8%AF%E6%BE%B3%E5%BA%97%E5%85%A8%E7%B7%9A%E7%AA%81%E5%81%9C%E6%A5%AD-222018288.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4644">'''Optoelectronic plethysmography''' (OEP) is a method to evaluate ventilation through an external measurement of the [[chest wall]] surface motion.

A number of small reflective markers are placed on the thoraco-abdominal surface by hypoallergenic adhesive tape. A system for human [[motion analysis]] measures the three-dimensional coordinates of these markers and the enclosed volume is computed by connecting the points to form triangles.

From OEP it is thus possible to obtain volume variations of the entire chest wall and its different compartments. The chest wall can be modeled as being composed of three different compartments: pulmonary rib cage (RCp), abdominal rib cage (RCa), and the abdomen (AB). This model is the most appropriate for the study of chest wall kinematics in the majority of conditions, including exercise. It takes into consideration the fact that the lung- and diaphragm-apposed parts of the rib cage (RCp and RCa, respectively) are exposed to substantially different pressures on their inner surface during inspiration, that the diaphragm acts directly only on RCa, and that non-diaphragmatic inspiratory muscles act largely on RCp. Abdominal volume change is defined as the volume swept by the abdominal wall.

Optoelectronic plethysmography can be used following different measurement protocols, specifically developed for different applications and different experimental and clinical situations. In the arrangement designed for the analysis in sitting and standing positions, 89 markers are arranged on the thoraco-abdominal surface.&lt;ref name="pmid9018522"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Cala SJ, Kenyon CM, Ferrigno G, Carnevali P, Aliverti A, Pedotti A, Macklem PT, Rochester DF | title=Chest wall and lung volume estimation by optical reflectance motion analysis | journal=J Appl Physiol | year= 1996 | volume= 81 | issue= 6 | pages= 2680–9 | pmid=9018522  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Optoelectronic plethysmography can be used also in supine and prone positions.&lt;ref name="pmid11219508"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Aliverti A, Dellacà R, Pelosi P, Chiumello D, Gattinoni L, Pedotti A | title=Compartmental analysis of breathing in the supine and prone positions by optoelectronic plethysmography | journal=Ann Biomed Eng | year= 2001 | volume= 29 | issue= 1 | pages= 60–70 | pmid=11219508 | doi=10.1114/1.1332084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The validation of the method was obtained by comparing the lung volume changes obtained by Volumetric and Flow measuring [[Spirometers]] and chest wall total volumes by optoelectronic plethysmography during different maneuvers.

'''Other World Computing''' (OWC) is an American computer hardware company and online store for Mac upgrades and accessories located at MacSales.com that was founded in 1988.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{Cite web |title= Founder Bio |work= Company web site |url= http://eshop.macsales.com/Service/index.cfm?page=bios.html |accessdate= November 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===1980s===
In 1988, at age 14, Larry O'Connor began LRO Enterprises, a printer ribbon re-inking business, in his family's barn.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; A year later, LRO Enterprises reorganized into LRO Computer Sales and began selling computer memory chips via [[America Online]]. The company moved into its first facility in [[Woodstock, Illinois]] and hired its first employees.&lt;ref name="self"&gt;{{Cite web |title= OWC Timeline |work= Company web site |url= http://eshop.macsales.com/owcpages/timeline |accessdate= November 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
In 1992, LRO Computer Sales shifted focus to computers by offering hard drives to its customers. In 1993, LRO Computer Sales incorporated in the state of Illinois under the name New Concepts Development Corporation (NCDC). The company then moved into a 2,500-square-foot office space, which expanded to about 6,500-square feet over the next eight years. In 1994, O'Connor renamed LRO Computers Sales "Other World Computing" (OWC), which operates [[doing business as]] NCDC.&lt;ref name="self" /&gt; OWC shipped its first OWC-branded acceleration products in 1995 followed by the introduction of the Mercury G3 ZIF upgrade line in 1999.

===2000s===
OWC expanded and introduced the Mercury Classic Elite line of external storage and offered an [[iPod]] case. OWC announced a portable [[FireWire]] drive and a FireWire/USB combination product in 2003.&lt;ref name="self" /&gt;

In 2003, OWC released a line of external storage products; the Mercury Extreme product line with a G4/1.33&amp;nbsp;GHz processor upgrade, the fastest Macintosh processor to that date; an extra high-capacity NuPower replacement battery compatible with PowerBook G3 FireWire (2000/Pismo) and PowerBook G3 Lombard (1999/Bronze Keyboard) models; and the OWC Neptune line of external 7200RPM FireWire storage solutions. OWC launched FasterMac.net, a Macintosh-only [[Internet access]] service that provided dialup access throughout the U.S. specifically for Macintosh computer users in 2003.&lt;ref name="self" /&gt;

In 2004, the company also began offering an iPod battery replacement program and introduced the miniStack line of drives to complement Apple's Mac mini. In 2006, OWC introduced the first Dual-HD external FireWire drive RAID available up to 1.5 TB and became the first third party company with memory modules and upgrade kits for the Intel-based Mac Pro that met Apple specifications and first to introduce a Quad Interface external hard drive combining FireWire 800, FireWire 400, USB 2.0, and [[eSATA]] connection options in one product – the OWC Mercury Elite-AL Pro Quad Interface.&lt;ref name="self" /&gt;

In January 2007, OWC announced it would be the US distributor of the [[Axiotron Modbook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Axiotron and OWC Unveil ModBook, the First Mac Tablet |work= The Mac Observer |author= John F. Braun |date= January 10, 2007 |url= http://www.macobserver.com/article/2007/01/09.25.shtml |accessdate= November 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
OWC also introduced the OWC Mercury Rack Pro line and the OWC Blu-ray internal and external drives. In April 2009, OWC expanded its storage line with the OWC Mercury Elite Pro Qx2, a desktop hardware RAID storage product.&lt;ref name="self" /&gt;

In 2008, OWC moved into a new {{Convert |37000|ft2|m2|adj=on}} corporate headquarters designed to platinum [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Back on the Radar: Other World Computing and going green |author= Raman Chadha |date= May 13, 2011 |work= Crain's Chicago Business |url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20110513/BLOGS06/305139989 |accessdate= November 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October 2009, a Vestas V39-500kW wind turbine started generating more electricity than OWC needed to run the facility, [https://eshop.macsales.com/thinkgreen/ view OWC's think green efforts]. OWC said it was the first technology manufacturer/distributor in the U.S. to become totally on-site wind powered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Exploring Other World Computing's super-green headquarters |author= Chris Foresman |date= October 25, 2011 |work= ars technical |url= https://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/10/exploring-other-world-computings-super-green-headquarters |accessdate= November 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===
Other World Computing was on the [[Inc. (magazine)|''Inc.'' magazine]] 5000 "Fastest-Growing Privately Owned Companies" and "Computer and Electronics Top 100" list from 2007 through 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Other World Computing |work= Company Profile |publisher= Inc. magazine |url= http://www.inc.com/profile/other-world-computing |accessdate= November 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2010, OWC announced the Mercury Extreme SSD line of 2.5" SATA solid state drives. The OWC Data Doubler, for adding a second internal drive to MacBook, MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and iMac computers was also introduced as was the OWC Slim eSATA ExpressCard Adapter, which adds an eSATA port to Mac and PC notebooks.&lt;ref name="self" /&gt;

In 2011, sales revenue was reported as $88.3&amp;nbsp;million with about 137 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Fast Fifty No. 47: Other World Computing Inc. |author= Monica Ginsburg |date= June 4, 2012 |work= Crain's Chicago Business |url= http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20120602/ISSUE02/306029950 |accessdate= November 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solar Power ===
OWC adopted solar power as an energy source at its two largest locations in Woodstock and Austin, TX. The Woodstock, IL solar system will generate 265,000 kWh per year, when combined with power from the wind turbine it brings the Woodstock headquarters’ total alternative power generation capacity to over one million kilowatts. It also means that over the course of a year, OWC produces more power than it consumes.

A similar but smaller array is on the roof of OWC's Austin,TX building. Energized at the beginning of 2014, 160 solar panels generate approximately one-third of the power consumed by the three-story building, including the majority of power that is consumed by OWC.

==Products==

OWC markets upgrade kits for iMac, Macbook Pro, Macbook Air, Mac mini, MacBook and Mac Pro.
The Data-Doubler installation kit&lt;ref&gt;http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/drive_bracket/datadoubler/&lt;/ref&gt; allows customers to add a second 2.5" SATA [[hard disk drive]] or [[solid state drive]] to the optical drive bay of a Mac mini, MacBook, or MacBook Pro.  The optical drive can then be repurposed as an external drive.

'''Pierre Victor Auger''' (14 May 1899 &amp;ndash; 25 December 1993) was a French [[physicist]], born in Paris. He worked in the fields of [[atomic physics]], [[nuclear physics]], and [[cosmic ray]] physics.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite  journal | author= Lars Persson | title= Pierre Auger-A  Life in the Service of Science  | journal=Acta Oncologica | volume=35  |  issue=7| year=1996| pages=785–787 | doi=10.3109/02841869609104027}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is famous for being one of the discoverers of the [[Auger effect]], named after him.

==Early life==
Pierre's father was chemistry professor Victor Auger. Pierre Auger was a student at the [[École normale supérieure]] in Paris from 1919 to 1922, the year when he passed the [[agrégation]] of physics. He then joined the physical chemistry laboratory of the faculté des sciences of the [[University of Paris]] under the direction of [[Jean Perrin]] to work there on the [[Photoelectric effect|photoelectric effect.]]

==Career==
In 1926 he obtained his doctorate in physics from the University of Paris. In 1927, he was named assistant to the faculté des sciences of Paris and, at the same time, adjoint chief of service to l'Institut de biologie physico-chimique. Chief of work to faculty in 1934 and general secretary of the annual tables of the constants in 1936, he was named university lecturer in physics to the faculty on the first of November 1937. He was charged with, until 1940, the course on the experimental bases of the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] within the chair of theoretical physics and astrophysics. He was also adjoint director of the laboratory of physical chemistry. He then occupied the chair of quantum physics and relativity of the faculté des sciences of Paris.

At the end of [[World War II]], he was named director of higher education from 1945 to 1948, which permitted him to introduce the first chair of [[genetics]] at the [[Sorbonne University|Sorbonne]], conferred upon [[Boris Ephrussi]].

The process where [[Auger electron]]s are emitted from [[atom]]s is used in [[Auger electron spectroscopy]] to study the elements on the surface of materials.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; This method was named after him, despite the fact that [[Lise Meitner]] discovered the process a few years before in 1922.

==Findings==
In his work with [[Cosmic ray|cosmic rays]], he found that the cosmic radiation events were coincident in time meaning that they were associated with a single event, an [[air shower (physics)|air shower]]. He estimated that the energy of the incoming particle that creates large air showers must be at least 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; [[electronvolt]]s (eV) = 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; particles of 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; eV (critical energy in air) and a factor of ten for energy loss from traversing the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=P.

==Honors and achievements==
*He was [[European Space Research Organisation]] (ESRO) first Director General and one of the forefathers for the [[CERN]] foundation.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

*He was president of the Centre international de calcul (Rome). From 1948 to 1959, he directed at [[UNESCO]] the department of mathematical and natural sciences.

*He was elected a member of the [[Académie des sciences (France)|Académie des sciences]] in 1977.
*He hosted a broadcast of [[Popular science|popularization of exacting science]] on Friday evenings on the public radio station [[France Culture]] from September 1969 to June 1986, entitled ''Les Grandes Avenues de la science moderne''.

*The world's largest cosmic ray detector, the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]], is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Watson|first1=Alan|title=The future's bright for the Pierre Auger Observatory|journal=CERN Courier|date=July 2006|volume=46|issue=6|pages=12–14|url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/1733941}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Auger observatorycelebrates progress|journal=CERN Courier|date=February 2006|volume=46|issue=1|page=8|url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/1733853}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6086">'''Preservation development''' is a model of [[real-estate development]] that addresses [[farmland preservation]].  It shares many attributes with [[conservation development]], with the addition of strategies for maintaining and operating productive [[agriculture]] and [[silviculture]], often in [[perpetuity]].  A preservation development is a [[master planned community]] that allows limited, carefully designed development (typically housing) on a working farm, while placing the majority of productive land under a system of [[easement]]s and [[community governance]] to ensure a continuity of farming and environmental [[stewardship]].

== Goals ==

Preservation development is not a formal planning approach, but an example of goal-oriented [[environmental planning]].  Particular characteristics of the land, local market and local agricultural norms influence the tools to be deployed in each case. The successful project should, however, aim to meet several goals:&lt;ref&gt;Ned Carter, "Build It (Farm It!) and They Will Come", ''The Piedmont Virginian'', Winter 2010, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;
# 80% or more of the target parcel's agricultural productivity should be retained.
# Development should take a form that does not interfere with productive land uses.
# Legal constructions should make land protections permanent, but flexible.
# Community Governance and management structures should be created to ensure stewardship of the community.
# The community should advance public education on the value of rural lands.

== Origins ==

Preservation development was developed in the 1980s in response to rapid farmland loss due to [[urban sprawl]] around Boston.  Robert Baldwin, Sr. devised the system of interlocking "farmbelt" and "greenbelt" easements.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Peiser, "Saving the Family Farm", ''[[Urban Land]]'' December 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  The system, and associated design and community governance tools, was refined through the 1990s on projects around New England.  In 2005, this model was expanded into the Southeast, beginning with the 2,300 acre (931 ha) Bundoran Farm, in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]].

== Relationship to other conservation methods ==

In the United States, most land is conserved by a combination of charitable giving and tax incentives.  Parcels with ecological, historic or scenic value may be voluntarily placed under [[conservation easement]], which prohibits or significantly limits future development of the land.  The landowner may be directly compensated for the easement (Purchase of Development Rights), or the future-development rights may be considered a donation, subject to tax credits offsetting income taxes due.  In some US states, the tax credits may be sold to generate income from the transaction. In a few localities, future-development rights may be sold or traded ([[Transferable development rights]]), and redeployed in urbanizing areas.&lt;ref name="Handbook"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nelson |first1=Arthur C. |last2=Pruetz |first2=Rick |last3=Woodruff |first3=Doug |year=2011 |title=The TDR Handbook: Designing and Implementing Transfer of Development Rights Programs |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Island Press |isbn=9781610911597}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Farmland Trust"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.farmland.org//programs/states/wa/documents/APPENDIXH-Transferofdevelopmentrights.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116082248/http://www.farmland.org//programs/states/wa/documents/APPENDIXH-Transferofdevelopmentrights.pdf |title=Transfer of Development Rights; Fact Sheet |date=April 2008 |archive-date=2011-01-16 |publisher=American Farmland Trust |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preservation development is a market-based approach, and does not rely on taxpayer funding or charitable donation.  The landowner sells the land.  Development and land protections are enacted simultaneously, and the resulting subdivided parcels are sold to individuals.&lt;ref&gt;''For Sale: Condo with Chicken Coop'', Sara Schaeffer Munoz, in The Wall Street Journal, May 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The value of each parcel is increased by adjacency and access to the conserved land, which allows development density significantly below that allowed by [[zoning]].&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Farms as Subdivision Amenities'', Alec Appelbaum in ''The New York Times'', July 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable development===
Preservation development is a type of [[sustainable development]] wherein the natural [[carrying capacity]] of land is considered not only in terms of development but also in agricultural capacity and ecological service.  Rather than maximizing development, developers seek a [[Triple Bottom Line]] (TBL) balance between social, environmental and economic factors.&lt;ref&gt;Nell Porter Brown, "Keeping it Green", ''[[Harvard Magazine]]'' Nov/Dec 2008, v. 111-2, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smart Growth===
[[New Urbanism]] and [[Smart Growth]] promote density, interconnectivity and access to transit as desirable goals of urban planning.  Both approaches privilege development in infill locations and brownfields.  Preservation Development's focus on greenfield sites with active agriculture and forestry places has placed it outside the mainstream of either movement.

Since 2001, however, New Urbanist planners Duany / Plater-Zyberk have promoted a "transect" zoning approach, recognizing the need to extend Smart Growth approaches to highly urbanized and rural locations.  These new codes address development pressure in [[exurban]] locations, as does Preservation Development.  In this context, Preservation Development is an appropriate settlement pattern for the two or three lowest-density landscape types on the transect, and insufficiently dense for the other categories.

Some communities with zoning influenced by tenets of Smart Growth have embraced Preservation Development as an additional tool for managing exurban growth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2649">'''Sabamobil''' was a magnetic tape audio cartridge format, made by [[SABA (electronics manufacturer)|SABA]] and came to the market in 1964. It used already available four-track ¼ [[inch]] tape on 3-inch reels (= 7.62&amp;nbsp;cm), with two [[Monaural|mono]] channels per side, using a tape speed of 3¾ IPS (~ 9.5&amp;nbsp;cm/s), and was compatible with [[reel-to-reel audio tape recording]] except the against remove secured ends of the tape in the reel. The cartridge could be opened without the need of any tools by removing two holding clamps. [[Tape head]] and [[Tape transport|capstan]] were placed between the reels.&lt;ref name="TechmoanSabamobil"&gt;Techmoan: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU-iSTj2cTY Forgotten Format: The Sabamobil], YouTube, 22 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US the player was offered for [[US$]] 136, which would correspond to ${{Inflation|US|136|1964}} of today, a cassette was $14 (with inflation of today $ {{Inflation|US|14|1964}}) and the adapter for installation in car was $45. The model TK-R12 also had an builtin [[medium frequency]] [[Amplitude modulation|AM]]-[[broadcast]] [[receiver (radio)|receiver]] and could also be operated portable with five [[D battery|D-type batteries]].&lt;ref&gt;(German) [http://www.radiomuseum.org/r/saba_sabamobil_tk_r12.html Sabamobil TK-R12], Radiomuseum.org, retrieved 24 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The drive assembly had no drive belts.

Lowe, ed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; generally [[electronic visual display|electronic displays]] such as [[television]]s and computer [[Computer display|monitors]]. SID was founded in 1962. Its main activities are publishing technical journals and running "Display Week", its main conference, held in May or June each year. SID publications include the ''Journal of the Society for Information Display'', published monthly, the ''Digest of Technical Papers'' from SID's annual conference, ''Information Display'' [[magazine]], proceedings from other conferences such as the Vehicle Displays and Interfaces Symposium, Asia Display, and International Display Workshops. In addition, local chapters in the Americas, Europe, and throughout Asia have meetings frequently, including lectures by display technologists, and are sometimes offered as webcasts. The SID Board of Directors grants several SID awards based upon outstanding achievements and significant contributions.
==History==
In early 1960s, IRE (Institute of Radio Engineers. Later IRE was merged with AIEE to form IEEE in January, 1963.) declined to create a new Section devoted solely to electronic information displays. This caused founders from IRE to start their own society, Society for Information Display. 
SID's founding meeting was called by Dr. Luxenberg September 29, 1962 at UCLA in Boelter Hall.  [http://www.sid.org/About.aspx#31799-history--50th-anniversary]
Due to emergence of new display technologies and their successful commercialization, such as [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]], [[Plasma Display]], [[LCD Display]] and [[OLED Displays]], SID has expanded its scale in membership as well as the attendance in [[Display Week]], its symposium and exhibition.

[[File:Storm drain pipe (crop).JPG|thumb|Storm drain with its pipe visible beneath it due to construction work]]

A '''storm drain''', '''storm sewer''' ([[United States|U.S.]] and [[Canada]]), '''surface water drain/sewer''' ([[United Kingdom]]), or '''stormwater drain''' ([[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]) is infrastructure designed to [[Drainage|drain]] excess rain and [[ground water]] from [[impervious surface]]s such as paved streets, car parks, parking lots, footpaths, sidewalks, and roofs. Storm drains vary in design from small residential [[dry well]]s to large municipal systems.

Drains receive water from [[street gutter]]s on most [[motorway]]s, freeways and other busy [[road]]s, as well as towns in areas with heavy rainfall that leads to [[flood]]ing, and coastal towns with regular [[storm]]s. Even gutters from houses and buildings can connect to the storm drain. Many storm drainage systems are [[gravity sewer]]s that drain untreated storm water into rivers or streams—so it is unacceptable to pour hazardous substances into the drains.

Storm drains often cannot manage the quantity of rain that falls in heavy rains or storms. Inundated drains can cause basement and street flooding. In many areas require [[Stormwater detention vault|detention tanks]] inside a property that temporarily hold runoff in heavy rains and restrict outlet flow to the public sewer. This reduces the risk of overwhelming the public sewer. Some storm drains mix stormwater (rainwater) with [[sewage]], either intentionally in the case of [[combined sewer]]s, or unintentionally.

==Function==
[[File:Storm Drain.JPG|thumb|American-style curbside storm drain receiving [[urban runoff]]]]

===Inlet===
[[Image:Storm Drain Dryden.JPG|thumb|Full view of a storm drain ([[Ontario, Canada]])]]
There are two main types of [[stormwater]] drain (highway drain or road gully in the UK) inlets: side inlets and grated inlets. Side inlets are located adjacent to the curb (curb) and rely on the ability of the opening under the back stone or lintel to capture flow. They are usually depressed at the invert of the channel to improve capture capacity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lgam.info/kerb-inlet Kerb Inlet], Local Government &amp; Municipal Knowledge Base, accessed February 6, 2010, &lt;/ref&gt;

Many inlets have [[grating]]s or grids to prevent people, vehicles, large objects or [[debris]] from falling into the storm drain. Grate bars are spaced so that the flow of water is not impeded, but [[sediment]] and many small objects can also fall through. However, if grate bars are too far apart, the openings may present a risk to pedestrians, bicyclists, and others in the vicinity. Grates with long narrow slots parallel to traffic flow are of particular concern to cyclists, as the front tire of a bicycle may become stuck, causing the cyclist to go over the handlebars or lose control and fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.piperescue.com.au/news/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2009-technotes-spring.pdf |title=technotes |publisher=Maryland Transportation Technology Transfer Center |issue=Spring 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storm drains in streets and parking areas must be strong enough to support the weight of vehicles, and are often made of cast iron or reinforced concrete.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.drainagesuperstore.co.uk/blog/weight-load-classes/ Drainage Superstore], Weight load classes for channel drainage, storm drains and gully grates, accessed April 27, 2017, &lt;/ref&gt;

[[File: Küstrin - alter Strassenablauf.jpg|thumb|Storm drain in Küstrin (now Kostrzyn nad Odrą in Poland)]]

Some of the heavier sediment and small objects may settle in a catch basin, or [[sump]], which lies immediately below the outlet, where water from the top of the catch basin reservoir overflows into the sewer proper. The catchbasin serves much the same function as the "trap" in household wastewater [[plumbing]] in trapping objects.

In the United States, unlike the plumbing trap, the catch basin does not necessarily prevent sewer gases such as [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[methane]] from escaping. However, in the United Kingdom, where they are called '''gully pots''',&lt;ref&gt;Field, Richard and Daniel Sullivan.{{Google books|EmuDk3G4vV0C&amp;printsec|Wet-Weather Flow in the Urban Watershed: Technology and Management|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are designed as true water-filled traps and do block the egress of gases and rodents.

Most catchbasins contain [[stagnant water]] during drier parts of the year and can, in warm countries, become [[mosquito]] breeding grounds. [[Larvicide]]s or disruptive larval hormones, sometimes released from "mosquito biscuits", have been used to control mosquito breeding in catch basins.  Mosquitoes may be physically prevented from reaching the standing water or migrating into the sewer proper by the use of an "inverted cone filter". Another method of [[mosquito control]] is to spread a thin layer of oil on the surface of stagnant water, interfering with the breathing tubes of mosquito larvae.

The performance of catch basins at removing [[sediment]] and other [[water pollution|pollutants]] depends on the design of the catchbasin (for example, the size of the sump), and on routine maintenance to retain the storage available in the sump to capture sediment. Municipalities typically have large [[vacuum truck]]s that perform this task.

Catch basins act as the first-line pretreatment for other [[water treatment|treatment]] practices, such as [[retention basin]]s, by capturing large sediments and street litter from [[urban runoff]] before it enters the storm drainage pipes.

[[File:StormDrainCulvert.JPG|thumb|A storm drain culvert under the main road empties into a bigger open channel]]

===Piping===
Pipes can come in many different cross-sectional shapes (rectangular, square, bread-loaf-shaped, oval, inverted pear-shaped, egg shaped, and most commonly, circular).  [[Drainage]] systems may have many different features including [[waterfall]]s, stairways, balconies and pits for catching rubbish, sometimes called Gross Pollutant Traps (GPTs). Pipes made of different materials can also be used, such as brick, concrete, [[high-density polyethylene]] or galvanized steel. [[Fibre reinforced plastic]] is being used more commonly for drain pipes and fittings.

===Outlet===
Most drains have a single large exit at their point of discharge (often covered by a [[grating]]) into a [[canal]], river, lake, [[reservoir]], sea or ocean. Other than catchbasins, typically there are no treatment facilities in the piping system. Small storm drains may discharge into individual [[dry well]]s. Storm drains may be interconnected using slotted pipe, to make a larger dry well system. Storm drains may discharge into man-made excavations known as recharge basins or retention ponds.

==Environmental impacts==

===Water quantity===
Storm drains are often unable to manage the quantity of rain that falls during heavy rains and/or storms. When storm drains are inundated, basement and street flooding can occur. Unlike catastrophic flooding events, this type of [[Flood#urban flooding|urban flooding]] occurs in built-up areas where man-made drainage systems are prevalent. Urban flooding is the primary cause of sewer backups and basement flooding, which can affect properties repeatedly.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnt.org/media/CNT_PrevalenceAndCostOfUrbanFlooding.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Clogged drains also contribute to flooding by the obstruction of storm drains. Communities or cities can help reduce this by cleaning [[Leaf|leaves]] from the storm drains to stop ponding or flooding into yards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seattle.gov/util/MyServices/DrainageSewer/StormsFlooding/StormSeasonPreparation/TipstoReduceFlooding/index.htm|title=Tips to Reduce Flooding--Seattle Public Utilities|website=www.seattle.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Snow]] in the winter can also clog drains when there is an unusual amount of rain in the winter and snow is [[Snowplow|plowed]] atop storm drains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2016/12/23/minneapolis-prepares-possible-christmas-flood|title=Mpls. preps for possible flooding on Christmas|last=Nelson|first=Tim|access-date=2017-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Runoff into storm sewers can be minimized by including ''[[sustainable urban drainage systems]]'' (UK term) or ''[[Low-impact development (Canada/US)|low impact development]]'' or ''[[green infrastructure]]'' practices (US terms) into municipal plans. To reduce stormwater from rooftops, flows from eaves troughs ([[rain gutter]]s and downspouts) may be [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltrated]] into adjacent soil, rather than discharged into the storm sewer system. Storm water runoff from paved surfaces can be directed to unlined ditches (sometimes called [[Swale (geographical feature)|swales]] or [[bioswale]]s) before flowing into the storm sewers, again to allow the runoff to soak into the ground.  [[Permeable paving]] materials can be used in building sidewalks, [[driveway]]s and in some cases, parking lots, to infiltrate a portion of the stormwater volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brattebo|first1=B. O.|last2=Booth|first2=D. B.|year=2003|title=Long-Term Stormwater Quantity and Quality Performance of Permeable Pavement Systems|url=http://depts.washington.edu/cwws/Research/Reports/permeableparking.pdf|format=PDF|journal=[[Water Research]]|volume=37|issue=|pages=4369–4376|doi=10.1016/S0043-1354(03)00410-X|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070327123757/http://depts.washington.edu/cwws/Research/Reports/permeableparking.pdf|archivedate=2007-03-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many areas require that properties have [[Stormwater detention vault|detention tanks]] that temporarily hold rainwater runoff, and restrict the outlet flow to the public sewer. This lessens the risk of overburdening the public sewer during heavy rain. An overflow outlet may also connect higher on the outlet side of the detention tank. This overflow prevents the detention tank from completely filling. Restricting water flow and temporarily holding the water in a detention tank public this way makes it far less likely for rain to overwhelm the sewers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Water quality===
{{Main|Urban runoff}}
The ''[[first flush]]'' from [[urban runoff]] can be extremely dirty. Storm water may become contaminated while running down the road or other [[impervious surface]], or from lawn chemical run-off, before entering the drain.

[[File:Drain in Kalibari community (3682826791).jpg|thumb|Lack of proper storm drains and [[Sewerage|sewer systems]] in Kalibari community in [[Mymensingh]], [[Bangladesh]] - a common situation in urban [[slums]] in [[developing countries]]]]

Water running off these impervious surfaces tends to pick up [[gasoline]], [[motor oil]], [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]], [[waste|trash]] and other pollutants from roadways and parking lots, as well as [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s from lawns. Roads and parking lots are major sources of [[nickel]], [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[cadmium]], [[lead]] and [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAHs), which are created as [[combustion]] byproducts of gasoline and other [[fossil fuel]]s. Roof runoff contributes high levels of [[chemical synthesis|synthetic]] [[organic compound]]s and [[zinc]] (from [[galvanization|galvanized]] gutters). Fertilizer use on residential lawns, parks and golf courses is a significant source of [[nitrate]]s and [[phosphorus]].&lt;ref name="ASCE1"&gt;[http://wef.org Water Environment Federation], Alexandria, VA; and [http://www.asce.org American Society of Civil Engineers], Reston, VA.

Separation of undesired runoff can be achieved by installing devices within the storm sewer system. These devices are relatively new and can only be installed with new development or during major upgrades. They are referred to as [[oil-grit separator]]s (OGS) or oil-sediment separators (OSS). They consist of a specialized [[manhole]] chamber, and use the water flow and/or gravity to separate oil and grit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Fact Sheet--Oil/Grit Separator Units |title=Stormwater Best Management Practices in an Ultra-Urban Setting: Selection and Monitoring |last1=Shoemaker |first1=Leslie |last2=Lahlou |first2=Mohammed |last3=Doll |first3=Amy |last4=Cazenas |first4=Patricia |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=U.S. Federal Highway Administration |location=Washington, DC |isbn= |page= |pages= |chapterurl=http://environment.fhwa.dot.gov/ecosystems/ultraurb/3fs12.asp |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mosquito breeding===
{{see also|Mosquito control}}
Catch basins are commonly designed with a sump area below the outlet pipe level—a reservoir for water and debris that helps prevent the pipe from clogging. Unless constructed with permeable bottoms to let water infiltrate into underlying soil, this subterranean basin can become a mosquito breeding area, because it is cool, dark, and retains stagnant water for a long time. Combined with standard grates, which have holes large enough for mosquitoes to enter and leave the basin, this is a major problem in mosquito control.&lt;ref name="Surveillance of Above-and Below-Ground Mosquito Breeding Habitats in a Rural Midwestern Community: Baseline Data for Larvicidal Control Measures Against West Nile Virus Vectors"&gt;Clinical Medicine &amp; Research February 1, 2005 vol. 3 no. 1 3-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Basins can be filled with concrete up to the pipe level to prevent this reservoir from forming. Without proper maintenance, the functionality of the basin is questionable, as these catch basins are most commonly not cleaned annually as is needed to make them perform as designed. The trapping of debris serves no purpose because once filled they operate as if no basins were present, but continue to allow a shallow area of water retention for the breeding of mosquito. Moreover, even if cleaned and maintained, the water reservoir remains filled, accommodating the breeding of mosquitoes.

==Relationship to sanitary sewer systems==
[[File:Storm Drain Label EPA.jpg|thumb|Sign alerting public to avoid dumping waste into storm drains]]
[[File:BosHarbor DrainWan.jpg|thumb|right|Typical signage embedded in pavement next to a storm drain in [[Boston]], in the United States]]
Storm drains are separate and distinct from [[sanitary sewer]] systems. The separation of storm sewers from sanitary sewers helps prevent sewage treatment plants becoming overwhelmed by [[Infiltration/Inflow|infiltration/inflow]] during a rainstorm, which could discharge untreated sewage into the environment.

Many storm drainage systems drain untreated storm water into rivers or streams. Many local governments conduct public awareness campaigns about this, lest people dump waste into the storm drain system.&lt;ref name="EPA Outreach"&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, DC. [http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/menuofbmps/index.cfm?action=min_measure&amp;min_measure_id=1 "Public Education and Outreach on Stormwater Impacts."] 2008-09-17.&lt;/ref&gt; In the city of [[Cleveland, Ohio]], for example, all new catch basins installed have inscriptions on them not to dump any waste, and usually include a fish imprint as well. [[Trout Unlimited]] [[Canada]] recommends that a yellow fish symbol be painted next to existing storm drains.&lt;ref&gt;Trout Unlimited, Calgary, AB. [http://www.yellowfishroad.org/about.html "How does Yellow Fish Road Work?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717070000/http://www.yellowfishroad.org/about.html |date=2009-07-17 }} Accessed 2011-11-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combined sewers===
{{Main|Combined sewer}}
Cities that installed their sewage collection systems before the 1930s typically used single piping systems to transport both [[urban runoff]] and sewage. This type of collection system is referred to as a ''[[combined sewer|combined sewer system]]'' (CSS). The cities' rationale when combined sewers were built was that it would be cheaper to build just a single system.&lt;ref name="Burrian"&gt;Burrian, Steven J., et al. (1999).[http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/pubs/600ja99275/600ja99275.pdf "The Historical Development of Wet-Weather Flow Management."] EPA, National Risk Management Research Laboratory, Cincinnati, OH. Document No. EPA/600/JA-99/275.&lt;/ref&gt; In these systems a sudden large rainfall that exceeds sewage treatment capacity is allowed to overflow directly from storm drains into receiving waters via structures called ''combined sewer overflows''.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. [http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/owm0111.pdf "Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) Control Policy."] ''Federal Register,'' 59 FR 18688. April 19, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Storm drains are typically at shallower depths than combined sewers; because, while storm drains are designed to accept surface runoff from streets, combined sewers were designed to also accept sewage flows from buildings with basements.&lt;ref name="eddy"&gt;{{cite book |last=Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc. |title=Wastewater Engineering |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1972 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |isbn= |page=119 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New York City]], [[Washington DC]], [[Seattle]] and other cities with combined systems have this problem due to a large influx of storm water after every heavy rain. Some cities have dealt with this by adding large storage tanks or ponds to hold the water until it can be treated. [[Chicago]] has a system of tunnels, collectively called the [[Tunnel and Reservoir Plan|Deep Tunnel]], underneath the city for storing its stormwater.&lt;ref&gt;''American City &amp; County'' (1996). [http://www.americancityandcounty.com/mag/government_chicago_digs_deep "Chicago digs deep to better manage stormwater."] 1996-06-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Many areas require detention tanks or roof detention systems that temporarily hold runoff in heavy rains and restrict outlet flow to the public sewer. This lessens the risk of overwhelming the public sewer in heavy rain. An overflow outlet may also connect higher on the outlet side of the detention tank. This overflow prevents the detention tank from completely filling. By restricting the flow of water in this way and temporarily holding the water in a [http://www.tenri.org/nycenter/images/fushin17-3.jpg detention tank] or by roof detention public sewers are less likely to overflow.&lt;ref&gt;Water Watch NYC, New York, NY (2008-07-14).[http://waterwatchnyc.com/category/combined-sewer-overflow/ "Green Roof – Blue Roof."]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations and local building codes==
[[Building code]]s and local government [[Local ordinance|ordinances]] vary greatly on the handling of storm drain runoff. New developments might be required to construct their own storm drain processing capacity for returning the runoff to the [[water table]] and [[bioswale]]s may be required in sensitive ecological areas to protect the [[drainage basin|watershed]].

In the United States, cities, suburban communities and towns with over 10,000 population are required to obtain discharge permits for their storm sewer systems, under the [[Clean Water Act]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Water Quality Act of 1987, [http://www.glin.gov/download.action?fulltextId=66730&amp;documentId=71638&amp;glinID=71638 Pub.L. 100-4] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229205334/http://www.glin.gov/download.action?fulltextId=66730&amp;documentId=71638&amp;glinID=71638 |date=2012-02-29 }}, {{USStat|101|69}}, {{USC|33|1342(p)}}, February 4, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) issued stormwater regulations for large cities in 1990 and for other communities in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. [http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/munic.cfm "Stormwater Discharges From Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4s)."] 2009-03-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The permits require local governments to operate stormwater management programs, covering both construction of new buildings and facilities, and maintenance of their existing municipal drainage networks. Many municipalities have revised their local ordinances covering management of runoff. State government facilities, such as roads and [[highway]]s, are also subject to the stormwater management regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Woelkers, David A. (2002). [http://www.stormh2o.com/september-october-2002/tidal-wavestormwater-ordinances.aspx "Tidal Wave: Stormwater Ordinances as a BMP for Phase II."] ''Stormwater,'' September–October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many local municipalities have commercial and residential stormwater management ordinances that require builders to design and implement an approved system.

=== Examples ===
[[Gateway_Cities|Southeastern Los Angeles County]] installed thousands of stainless steel, full-capture trash devices on their road drains in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2011/11/massive-la-river-trash-capturing-project-completed.html "Tons of L.A. River trash will be captured before it hits the sea" Los Angeles Times. November 1, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exploration==
{{Main|Urban exploration}}
An international [[subculture]] has grown up around the exploration of stormwater drains. Societies such as the [[Cave Clan]] regularly explore the drains underneath cities. This is commonly known as "[[urban exploration]]", but is also known as ''draining'' when in specific relation to storm drains.

==History==
[[File:Ostia Antica Gully Hole.jpg|thumb|[[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] [[gully]] hole{{Clarify|date=May 2010}} in [[Ostia Antica]] in [[Italy]]]]

[[Archaeological]] studies have revealed use of rather sophisticated stormwater [[surface runoff|runoff]] systems in ancient cultures.  For example, in [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Crete]] approximately 4000 years before present, cities such as [[Phaistos]] were designed to have storm drains and channels to collect precipitation runoff. At Cretan [[Knossos]], storm drains include stone-lined structures large enough for a person to crawl through.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan (2007). [http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10854/knossos.html#fieldnotes "Knossos fieldnotes."] ''Modern Antiquarian.''&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of early civilizations with elements of stormwater drain systems include early people of [[Mainland Orkney]] such as [[Gurness]] and the [[Brough of Birsay]] in [[Scotland]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2026">A '''thyristor drive''' is a motor drive circuit where [[alternating current|AC]] supply current is regulated by a [[thyristor]] [[phase (waves)|phase]] control to provide variable [[voltage]] to a [[DC motor]].

==Applications==
Thyristor drives are very simple and were first introduced in the 1960s. They remained the predominant type of industrial [[motor controller]] until the end of the 1980s when the availability of low cost electronics led to their replacement by [[Chopper (electronics)|chopper drives]] for high performance systems and [[Inverter (electrical)|inverters]] for high reliability with [[AC motor]]s. They are still employed in very high power applications, such as [[locomotive]]s, where the high power capability of the thyristors and the simplicity of the design can make them a more attractive proposition than transistor based controllers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/48678403/INDUSTRIAL-ELECTRONICS-NOTES-PART-2|title=INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS NOTES (PART 2) {{!}} Rectifier {{!}} Semiconductor Devices|website=Scribd|language=en|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hyclassproject.com/design-and-construction-of-a-thyristor-speed-control-of-a-dc-motor.html|title=design and construction of a thyristor speed control of a dc motor- for B.Sc, HND, and OND  project topics and material {{!}} www.hyclassproject.com|website=www.hyclassproject.com|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A derivative of the thyristor drive is the simple [[AC phase controller]]. This uses a single phase controlled [[TRIAC|triac]] to provide a variable voltage AC output for regulating a [[universal motor]]. This is the type of motor speed control most commonly used in domestic appliances, such as food mixers, and small AC powered tools, such as electric drills.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2346">'''Traditional engineering''', also known as '''sequential engineering''', is the process of [[marketing]], engineering [[design]], [[manufacturing]], testing and [[Production, costs, and pricing|production]] where each stage of the development process is carried out separately, and the next stage cannot start until the previous stage is finished.  Therefore, the information flow is only in one direction, and it is not until the end of the chain that errors, changes and corrections can be relayed to the start of the sequence, causing estimated costs to be under predicted.

This can cause many problems; such as time consumption due to many modifications being made as each stage does not take into account the next.  This method is hardly used today{{citation needed|reason=Experience in a number of engineering sectors suggests that many firms have not yet transitioned to concurrent engineering.|date=July 2016}}, as the concept of [[concurrent engineering]] is more efficient.

Traditional engineering is also known as '''over the wall engineering''' as each stage blindly throws the development to the next stage '''over the wall'''.

==Lean manufacturing==
Traditional manufacturing has been driven by sales forecasts that companies need to produce and stockpile inventory to support. Lean manufacturing is based on the concept that production should be driven by the actual customer demands and requirements. Instead of pushing product to the marketplace, it is pulled through by the customers' actual needs.

==Sequential engineering stages==
# Research
# Design
# Manufacture
# Quality Control
# Distribution
# Sales

==Disadvantages of sequential engineering==
# This orderly step-by-step process will bring control to complex projects but is very slow.
# In today’s highly competitive market place this can lead to product failures and lost sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://manufacturing-works.com/lean/lean_vs_traditional.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918094157/http://manufacturing-works.com/lean/lean_vs_traditional.php |archivedate=2012-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wall's''' is an [[ice cream]] brand owned by the Anglo-Dutch food and personal care conglomerate [[Unilever]]. Originating as an independent food brand in the United Kingdom, Wall's is now part of the [[Heartbrand]] global frozen dessert subsidiary of Unilever, used in Australia, China, Hong Kong, Europe, Indonesia, India, Japan, Malaysia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walls.com.my |title=Walls.com.my |publisher=Walls.com.my |date= |accessdate=2009-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mauritius, New Zealand, Philippines, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Singapore, Thailand, United Arab Emirates and Vietnam. Unilever also uses a merged brand called [[Kwality Wall's]] in South Asia.

== History ==

Wall's was founded in 1786 by Richard Wall, when he opened a butcher's stall in St James’s Market, London. In the 1900s the business was led by Richard's grandson Thomas Wall II. Every year the company had to lay off staff in the summer as demand for its sausages, pies and meat fell, so in 1913 Thomas Wall II conceived the idea of making ice cream in the summer to avoid those lay-offs; the [[First World War]] meant that his idea was not implemented until 1922. Following his retirement in 1920, Thomas Wall II created his Trust for the “encouragement and assistance of educational work and social service”. Today, the Trust continues to assist in these areas by providing grants to individuals and organisations. &lt;ref name=TWallTrust&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thomaswalltrust.org.uk/sites/default/files/The-origins-of-the-trust-V2.doc|title=Origins of the Trust|publisher=Thomas Wall Trust|accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1922 the business had been jointly bought by [[Lever Brothers]] and [[Margarine Unie]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/chimes-driving-Walls-Ice-Cream-the50s/story-20146777-detail/story.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Maxwell Holt was put in charge and he revived the idea of producing ice cream, with near instant success. Ice cream production commenced in 1922 at a factory in [[Acton, London]]. In 1959, Wall's doubled capacity by opening a purpose built ice cream factory in [[Gloucester]], England.

There is a garage on the corner of Aultone Way and Angel Hill in [[Benhilton]], [[Sutton, London]], built in about 1913 and still in use today, which was originally used for the storing of the 'Stop Me and Buy One' bicycles of Thomas Wall's business.

== Ice cream ==

Unilever continues to use the brand for ice cream in the UK&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walls.co.uk |title=Wall's &amp;#124;&amp;#124; UK Home |publisher=Walls.co.uk |accessdate=2009-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has become part of the company's international [[List of Unilever brands#Ice cream|Heartbrand]] strategy, where it retains its name but shares a logo and most of the product lineup with the other Heartbrand companies. Whilst remaining (2006) the market leader in the UK for individual hand-held products such as [[Cornetto (ice cream)|Cornetto]] and [[Magnum (ice cream)|Magnum]], and value-added multi-portion products designed to be eaten at home, such as [[Viennetta]], the Wall's brand faces severe competition from the major supermarket brands and to a lesser extent from [[Nestlé]] (absorbing the [[Rowntree's]] and [[Lyons Maid]] brands) and [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars]] spin-off ice cream products.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In 2013 Wall's expanded into the UK confectionery market following a licensing deal with Kinnerton Confectionery, leading to the introduction of ambient chocolate bar variations for the Magnum, Cornetto and Mini Milk ice cream brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.confectionerynews.com/Manufacturers/Unilever-enters-UK-confectionery-market-with-Kinnerton-licensing-deal|title=Unilever enters UK confectionery market with Kinnerton licensing deal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Whole Building Design Guide''' or '''WBDG''' is described by the [[Federal Energy Management Program]] as "a complete internet resource to a wide range of building-related design guidance, criteria and technology", and meets the requirements in guidance documents for [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] 13123.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Executive Order 13123:Greening the Government Through Efficient Energy Management|author= |publisher=[[Federal Energy Management Program]]|year= |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The WBDG is based on the premise that to create a successful high-performance building, one must apply an integrated design and team approach in all phases of a project, including  planning, design, construction, operations and maintenance. The WBDG is managed by the [[National Institute of Building Sciences]].&lt;ref name="NIBSFactSheet"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.nibs.org/resource/resmgr/Docs/NIBS_Factsheet_IRT_WBDG.pdf|title=NIBS Factsheet|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=NIBS|access-date=|accessdate=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The WBDG was initially designed to serve [[U.S. Department of Defense]] (DOD) construction programs. A 2003 DOD memorandum named WBDG the “sole portal to design and construction criteria produced by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] (USACE), [[Naval Facilities Engineering Command]] (NAVFAC), and [[U.S. Air Force]].” Since then, WBDG has expanded to serve all building industry professionals. The majority of its 500,000 monthly users are from the private sector.&lt;ref name="NIBSFactSheet" /&gt;
The WBDG draws information from the Construction Criteria Base and a privately owned database run by Information Handling Services.&lt;ref name="NIBSFactSheet" /&gt;

A significant amount of the Whole Building Design Guide content is organized by three  categories: Design Guidance, Project Management, and Operations and Maintenance.

{{Refimprove|date=May 2010}}

A '''working fluid''' is a pressurized [[gas]] or [[liquid]] that actuates a [[machine]] or [[heat engine]].  Examples include steam in a [[steam engine]], air in a [[hot air engine]] and [[hydraulic fluid]] in a [[hydraulic motor]] or [[hydraulic cylinder]]. More generally, in a [[thermodynamic system]], the working fluid is a liquid or gas that absorbs or transmits [[energy]].

== Properties and states ==
{{Textbook|section|date=May 2010}}
The [[working fluids|working fluid properties]] are essential for the full description of thermodynamic systems. Although working fluids have a very large number of physical properties which can be defined, the thermodynamic properties which are often required in engineering design and analysis are few. [[Pressure]], [[temperature]], [[enthalpy]], [[entropy]], [[specific volume]] and [[internal energy]] are the most common.

[[Image:Property diagram.JPG|frame|right|Pressure–volume diagram showing state (p,V)]]

If at least two thermodynamic properties are known, the state of the working fluid can be defined. This is usually done on a property diagram which is simply a plot of one property versus another.

[[Image:therm process.JPG|frame|left|Typical thermodynamic process for a working fluid (expansion from state 1 to state 2)]]

When the working fluid passes through engineering components such as [[turbine]]s and [[compressor]]s, the point on a property diagram moves due to the possible changes of certain properties. In theory therefore it is possible to draw a line/curve which fully describes the thermodynamic properties of the fluid. In reality however this can only be done if the process is [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]]. If not, the changes in property are represented as a dotted line on a property diagram. This issue does not really affect thermodynamic analysis since in most cases it is the end states of a process which are sought after.

== Work ==

The working fluid can be used to output useful [[work (physics)|work]] if used in a [[turbine]]. Also, in thermodynamic cycles energy may be input to the working fluid by means of a [[compression (physical)|compressor]]. The mathematical formulation for this may be quite simple if we consider a cylinder in which a working fluid resides. A piston is used to input useful work to the fluid. From mechanics, the work done from state 1 to state 2 of the process is given by

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; W = -\int_{1}^{2} \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Where ''ds'' is the incremental distance from one state to the next and ''F'' is the force applied. The negative sign is introduced since in this case a decrease in volume is being considered. The situation is shown in the figure which follows.

[[Image:Piston cylinder.jpg|frame|center|Work input on a working fluid by means of a cylinder-piston arrangement]]

The force is given by the product of the pressure in the cylinder and its cross sectional area such that

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt; W = -\int_{1}^{2} PA \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; W = -\int_{1}^{2} P \cdot \mathrm{d}V&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Where ''A.ds = dV'' is the elemental change of cylinder volume. If from state 1 to 2 the volume increases then the working fluid actually does work on its surroundings and this is commonly denoted by a negative work. If the volume decreases the work is positive. By the definition given with the above integral the work done is represented by the area under a pressure - volume diagram. If we consider the case where we have a constant pressure process then the work is simply given by

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt; W = -P \int_{1}^{2} \mathrm{d}V&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; W = -P \cdot (V_2-V_1)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

== Choice  ==

Depending on the application, various types of working fluids are used. In a thermodynamic cycle it may be the case that the working fluid changes state from gas to liquid or vice versa. Certain gases such as Helium can be treated as [[ideal gases]]. This is not generally the case for superheated steam and the [[ideal gas equation]] does not really hold. At much higher temperatures however it still yields relatively accurate results. The physical and chemical properties of the working fluid are extremely important when designing thermodynamic systems. For instance, in a refrigeration unit, the working fluid is called the refrigerant. [[Ammonia]] is a typical refrigerant and may be used as the primary working fluid. Compared with water (which can also be used as a refrigerant), ammonia makes use of relatively high pressures requiring more robust and expensive equipment.

In air standard cycles as in [[gas turbine]] cycles, the working fluid is air. In the open cycle gas turbine, air enters a compressor where its pressure is increased. The compressor therefore inputs work to the working fluid (positive work). The fluid is then transferred to a combustion chamber where this time heat energy is input by means of the burning of a fuel. The air then expands in a turbine thus doing work against the surroundings (negative work).

Different working fluids have different properties and in choosing one in particular the designer must identify the major requirements. In refrigeration units, high latent heats are required to provide large refrigeration capacities.

'''Ştefan Odobleja''' ({{IPA-ro|ʃteˈfan odoˈbleʒa}}; 13 October 1902 – 4 September 1978) was a [[Romania]]n [[scientist]] considered to be one of the precursors of [[cybernetics]]. His major work, ''Psychologie consonantiste'' (first published in 1938 and 1939, in [[Paris]]) helped generated many of the major themes of cybernetics regarding cybernetics and [[systems thinking]] nine years before [[Norbert Wiener]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

== Biography ==

Ştefan Odobleja was born into a family of peasants in 1902, in [[Livezile, Mehedinți|Valea Izvorului]] (now Ştefan Odobleja), [[Mehedinţi County]], [[Romania]]. He attended the [[Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy|Faculty of Medicine]] in [[Bucharest]] and became a physician.  He practiced medicine as a military doctor in [[Bucharest]], [[Dej]], [[Drobeta Turnu-Severin]], [[Lugoj]], [[Târgovişte]] and other Romanian cities. Endowed with an uncommon capacity of work and with an astonishing inventive spirit, Odobleja left an impressive work to the posterity. His completed works run to over 50,000 pages.

In 1936, Odobleja publishes “Phonoscopy and the clinical semiotics”. In 1937, he participates in the IXth International Congress of Military Medicine with a paper entitled “Demonstration de phonoscopie”, where he disseminates a prospectus in French, announcing the appearance of his future work “The Consonantist Psychology”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aos.ro/site_mod/site_mod_eng/ONLINE%20Info%20Nr1%202009.pdf ""Series on Science and Technology of Information"], Volume 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important of his writings is ''Psychologie consonantiste'', in which Odobleja lays the theoretical foundations of the generalized [[cybernetics]]. The book, published in [[Paris]] by "Librairie Maloine" (vol. I in 1938 and vol. II in 1939), contains almost 900 pages and includes 300 figures in the text.&lt;ref&gt;Odobleja, Ştefan - "Psychologie consonantiste",  Paris, Librairie Maloine; 1938-1939; 2 vol. (504, p. 500-884)&lt;/ref&gt;
The author wrote at the time that "this book is... a table of contents, an index or a dictionary of psychology, [for] a ... great Treatise of Psychology that should contain 20–30 volumes".

Due to the beginning of [[World War II]], the publication went unnoticed. The first Romanian edition of this work did not appear until 1982 (the first edition was published in French).

The Romanian [[communist]] government had little understanding of the subject and even declared cybernetics a science of capitalist nature. Odobleja, being its main advocate, was put under surveillance and home arrest.

Ştefan Odobleja died on September 4, 1978. His son put the epitaph “Father of Cybernetics” on his tomb stone, much to the Romanian government’s chagrin.

== Legacy ==

European recognition of his contribution to the foundations of cybernetics took place when his paper, "Diversity and Unit in Cybernetics" (presented at the Fourth Congress of Cybernetics and Systems in Amsterdam, August, 1978), was received with great acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;Romanian Scientists "Series on Science and Technology of Information" - Volume 2 , 2009 - p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

As an appreciation for his work of mapping the unknown territory of the consonantist psychology, cybernetics and generalized cybernetics, Ştefan Odobleja was elected posthumously an honorary member of the [[Romanian Academy]] (1990).

In 1982 a group of scientists established the "Cybernetics Academy "Ştefan Odobleja", a scientific forum registered in [[Lugano]], [[Switzerland]], financed by the Romanian billionaire Prof. Dr. [[Iosif Constantin Drăgan]].
