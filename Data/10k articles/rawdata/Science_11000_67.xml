'''''A Question and Answer Guide to Astronomy''''' is a [[book]] about [[astronomy]] and [[cosmology]], and is intended for a general audience. The book was written by [[Pierre-Yves Bely]], [[Carol Christian]], and [[Jean-Rene Roy]], and published in English by [[Cambridge University Press]] in 2010. It was originally written in French.&lt;ref name=AstronomyNow&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astronomynow.com/books/A%20Question%20and%20Answer%20Guide%20to%20Astronomy.html|title=A Question and Answer Guide to Astronomy|first=Alice|last=Sheppard|work=[[Astronomy Now]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The content within the book is written using a question and answer format. It contains some 250 questions, which ''[[The Science Teacher]]'' states each are answered with a "concise and well-formulated essay that is informative and readable." ''The Science Teacher'' review goes on to state that many of the answers given in the book are "little gems of science writing". ''The Science Teacher'' summarizes by stating that each question is likely to be thought of by a student, and that "the answers are informative, well constructed, and thorough".&lt;ref name=SciTeacher&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Seidman|first1=Cary|date=January 2011|title=A Question and Answer Guide to Astronomy|journal=[[The Science Teacher]]|volume=1|series=78|page=70|url=http://find.galegroup.com.ezproxy1.onlib.org:8080/gtx/infomark.do?&amp;contentSet=IAC-Documents&amp;type=retrieve&amp;tabID=T002&amp;prodId=SPJ.SP13&amp;docId=A246253486&amp;source=gale&amp;srcprod=SP13&amp;userGroupName=nysl_ce_ocpl&amp;version=1.0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book covers information about the [[planets]], [[the Earth]], [[the Universe]], practical astronomy, history, and awkward questions such as [[astronomy in the Bible]], [[UFO]]s, and [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]]s.&lt;ref name=AstronomyNow/&gt; Also covered are subjects such as the [[Big Bang]], comprehension of [[large numbers]], and the [[Moon illusion]].&lt;ref name=AstronomyNow/&gt;&lt;ref name=SciTeacher/&gt;

'''Abell 3266''' is a [[galaxy cluster]] in the southern sky. It is part of the [[Horologium-Reticulum supercluster]]. The galaxy cluster is one of the largest in the southern sky, and one of the largest [[mass concentration (astronomy)|mass concentration]]s in the nearby universe.

The Department of Physics at the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County]] discovered that a large mass of gas is hurtling through the cluster at a speed of 750&amp;nbsp;km/s.  The mass is billions of solar masses, approximately three (3) million [[light year]]s in diameter and is the largest of its kind so far discovered (June 2006).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/XMM_Newton_Spots_Greatest_Ball_Of_Fire.html XMM-Newton Spots Greatest Ball Of Fire]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaSC/SEMWD1AATME_index_0.html XMM-Newton spots the greatest of great balls of fire]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ahmad''' is a [[Impact crater|crater]] in the northern hemisphere of [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]].  Ahmad was first discovered in ''[[Voyager 2]]'' images but was seen at much higher resolution, though near the [[Terminator (solar)|terminator]], by ''[[Cassini-Huygens Mission|Cassini]]''.  It is located at 58.8° North [[Latitude]], 311.6° West [[Longitude]] and is 18.7 kilometers across.&lt;ref name="USGS"/&gt;  The western portion of the crater is largely absent, either buried or disrupted by the eastern margin of [[Samarkand Sulci]].  A large, dome-like structure occupies the interior of the crater, caused by infill of material from Samarkand Sulci or from viscous relaxation.

[[Ahmed (Arabian Nights)|Ahmad]] is named after a hero from ''[[Arabian Nights]]''.  He brings his father an apple and marries [[Peri-Banu]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3608">'''Amazon Coin''' is a digital payment method created by [[Amazon.com]].  Currently, the coins can only be used to purchase software for [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]], [[Kindle Fire]], and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices from within an app or from the [[Amazon Appstore]].

==History==
The company introduced Amazon Coins via a promotion in the United Kingdom and the United States, consisting of giving free coins to all users of [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] and [[Kindle Fire]] devices. Existing Kindle owners were given Coins valued $5/£4, as were customers who had ordered the [[Kindle Fire HDX]] in late 2013, upon receipt of their devices.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} However, in 2014 the company began allowing all Android users in Germany, the UK, and the US to earn, buy, and spend Amazon Coins via the Amazon Store via Android phones and tablets. Moreover, observes Lance Whitney writing for [[CNET]]: "Shoppers can get discounts when they buy the coins in bulk and earn coins through certain apps".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=CNet|date=February 19, 2014|title=
Amazon Coins branch out to all Android devices|author=  Lance Whitney|url= http://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-coins-branch-out-to-all-android-devices/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, with the release of the [[Fire Phone]], Amazon offered app developers 500,000 Amazon Coins for each paid app or app with in-app purchasing developed and optimized for the Fire Phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Appstore Developer Select|url=https://developer.amazon.com/public/resources/promotional-tools/featured-developer-program|website=amazon.com|publisher=Amazon.com Inc|accessdate=20 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705144804/https://developer.amazon.com/public/resources/promotional-tools/featured-developer-program|archive-date=2014-07-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amazon Coins and Amazon Underground|url=http://www.mustips.com/save-money-amazon-coins-and-amazon-appstore/|website=mustips.com|publisher=MUS Tips|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function and value==
Amazon has called Amazon Coins a "[[virtual currency]]". However, the Coins operate like other digital [[gift card]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.amazon.com/post/Tx2EZGRG23VNQ0K/Introducing-Amazon-Coins-A-New-Virtual-Currency-for-Kindle-Fire.html |title=Introducing Amazon Coins: A New Virtual Currency for Kindle Fire |publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|date=February 4, 2013|accessdate=May 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One Amazon Coin is worth one cent.  However, like many [[coupons]], they cannot be redeemed for cash.  However, they can be transferred to another Amazon account.&lt;ref name="terms"/&gt;

Purchased Coins do not expire, but some promotional Coins expire just over one year from the date they are acquired.&lt;ref name="terms"&gt;{{cite web|title=Amazon Coins Terms and Conditions|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a customer buys software with Amazon Coins, the developer is paid in conventional currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|

In [[survival analysis]], the '''area compatibility factor''', ''F'', is used in indirect standardisation of [[Population (statistics)|population]] [[mortality rate]]s.

:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{\sum_x {}^sE_{x,t}^c {}^sm_{x,t}}{\sum_x {}^sE_{x,t}^c} \left/
\frac{\sum_xE_{x,t}^c {}^sm_{x,t}}{\sum_x E_{x,t}^c}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;{}^sE_{x,t}^c&lt;/math&gt; is the standardised central exposed-to risk from age ''x'' to ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''t'' for the standard population,

:&lt;math&gt;E_{x,t}^c&lt;/math&gt; is the central exposed-to risk from age ''x'' to ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''t'' for the population under study and

:&lt;math&gt;{}^sm_{x,t}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mortality rate]] in the standard population for ages ''x'' to ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''t''.

The expression can be thought of as the crude mortality rate for the standard population divided by what the crude mortality rate is for the region being studied, assuming the mortality rates are the same as for the standard population.

''F'' is then multiplied by the crude mortality rate to arrive at the indirectly standardised mortality rate.

'''''Atom: An Odyssey from the Big Bang to Life on Earth...and Beyond''''' is the sixth non-fiction book by the American theoretical physicist [[Lawrence M. Krauss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ee.psu.edu/cssl/pages/waynick/waynick2003/waynick2003.html|publisher=[[psu.edu]]|title=Einstein's Biggest Blunder: A Cosmic Mystery Story|accessdate=2015-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.astrobio.net/interview/atom-conversation-with-lawrence-krauss/|publisher=[[astrobio.net]]|title=Atom: Conversation with Lawrence Krauss|first=|last=|accessdate=2015-07-20|date=May 26, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text was published on April 1, 2001 by [[Little, Brown]]. Krauss won the [[Science Writing Award]] (2002) for this book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/article/54/9/10.1063/1.1420514|publisher=[[aip.org]]|title=An Odyssey from the Big Bang to Life on Earth … and Beyond|first=Alastair|last=Cameron|accessdate=2015-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://krauss.faculty.asu.edu/curriculum-vitae/awards-honors/|publisher=[[asu.edu]]|title=CURRICULUM VITAE|accessdate=2015-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
In this book Krauss discusses creating parts of an [[oxygen atom]], the primary atoms of the [[Big Bang]]. Then he follows it through the remaining history of the [[Universe]]. As time has been passing by, the atom was a part of a [[supernova]] and [[Cosmic dust#Stardust|star dust]], star and planet systems, and, ultimately, a part of living cells.

==Review==
In his review Chris Lavers of ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated "Krauss weaves his cosmic story around the life of a single [[oxygen atom]], from the time it was just a twinkle in the universe's eye to the eventual death of its constituent particles. This [[denouement]] may come to pass in some distant part of the cosmos long after we have all passed away, but, if we are really lucky, it may just happen in an enormous tank of minutely scrutinised water currently located down a mineshaft in Japan. If and when it does, physicists the world over will jump up and down with excitement, because they will have learned something truly profound. Exactly what would take too long to explain, which is a relief, because I'm not at all sure I understand it. Read the book and try for yourself... I am in a better position to judge Krauss's geology and biology, subjects he admits he had to learn from scratch before writing ''Atom''. Not only has he mastered them, he often finds lyrical ways of explaining ideas in both fields. Indeed, the standard of writing in ''Atom'' is perhaps even higher than in his 1995 bestseller, ''[[The Physics of Star Trek]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jun/09/scienceandnature.highereducation|title=This is planet birth --- Chris Lavers explores time, the universe and everything with Aeons by Martin Gorst and Atom: An Odyssey from the Big Bang to Life on Earth by Lawrence M Krauss|publisher=[[theguardian.com]]|accessdate=|date=9 June 2001|first=Chris |last=Lavers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8797">'''Calceology''' (from Latin ''calcei'' "[[shoes]]" and  {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''-logiā'', "[[-logy]]") is the study of [[footwear]], especially [[historical]] footwear whether as [[archaeology]], shoe [[History of fashion design|fashion history]], or otherwise. It is not yet formally recognized as a field of research. Calceology comprises the examination, registration, research and conservation of leather [[shoe]] fragments.&lt;ref&gt;O. Goubitz “Calceology: a new hobby: the drawing and recording of archaeological footwear.” Recent Research in Archaeological Footwear, Association of Archaeological Illustrators and Surveyors, Technical Paper No. 8, 1987, pp. 1–28&lt;/ref&gt; A wider definition includes the general study of the ancient footwear, its social and cultural history,  technical aspects of pre-industrial [[shoemaking]] and associated leather trades, as well as reconstruction of archaeological footwear.

==History of calceology==
Among the early studies of footwear from European archaeological excavations, [[Roman Empire|Roman]] period footwear figures prominently&lt;ref&gt;L. Lindenschmit, ''Die Alterthümer unserer heidnischen Vorzeit'' Band 4, Römisch-Geranisches Zentralmuseum, Mainz 1900&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Curle, ''A Roman Frontier Post and its People''Glasgow 1910&lt;/ref&gt; followed by [[Middle Ages|medieval period]] finds.&lt;ref&gt;R. Blomqvist, "Medeltida Skor i Lund" (Medieval Shoes from Lund), ''Kulturen '' 1938, pp. 189–219&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Gansser-Burckhardt, "Die frühzeitliche Handwerkersiedelung am Petersberg in Basel, ''Zeitschrift für Schweizerische Archaeologie und Kunstgeschichte'' 1940, pp.10–29&lt;/ref&gt;   Scientifically based research was first applied to Roman period finds&lt;ref&gt;W. Groenman-van Waateringe, ''Romeins lederwerk uit Valkenburg Z.H.'' Groningen 1967&lt;/ref&gt; and later for [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] and primitive footwear.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hald,''Primitive Shoes'' Copenhagen 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; With the development of the Goubitz notation system, the technical aspects of the recovered shoe fragments could be clearly presented, allowing researchers a coherent scientific base for [[leather]] [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] documentation and correct interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;O. Goubitz, 'The Drawing and Registration of Archaeological Footwear',''Studies in Conservation'', Volume 29, Number 4, 1984, pp. 187–196&lt;/ref&gt; The interest in the history of ancient shoe [[fashion]] starts in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Balsuinius, B., Nigronius, Jul.De Calceo Antiquo, De Caliga Veterum, Amsterdam 1667&lt;/ref&gt; The interpretation of historical socio-cultural attributes shows the importance of footwear in an archaeological context.&lt;ref&gt;W. Groenman-van Waateringe, "Society&amp;nbsp;... rests on leather", ''Rotterdam Papers II, A contribution to medieval archeology'', Rotterdam 1975, pp.23–34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. Grew / M. de Neergard, ''Shoes and Pattens''London 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. van Driel-Murray, "And did those feet in ancient time&amp;nbsp;... Feet and shoes as a material projection of the self", ''TRAC 98. Proceedings of the 8th Annual Theoretical Roman Archaeology Conference, Leicester''Oxford, 1999, pp. 131–140&lt;/ref&gt; The reference book for calceological studies covers the [[Chronology|chronological]] span from European prehistory (Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Ages), Roman period, the Middle Ages to the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;O. Goubitz / C. van Driel-Murray / W. Groenman-van Waateringe, ''Stepping Through Time'', Zwolle, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Calceological studies outside of Europe include the eastern coast and bays of North America for post-1600 sites,&lt;ref&gt;S. Davis, "Piecing together the past: footwear and other artefacts from the wreck of a 16th-century Spanish Basque galleon", ''Artefacts from Wrecks, dated assemblages from the Late Middle Ages to the Industrial revolution''Exeter, 1997, pp.111–120&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[North Africa]]n sites for [[Egypt]]ian, Roman and [[Coptic period]]s.

==Methods==

===Preservation===
Archaeological leather artifacts are preserved in stable environments, either in constantly [[humid]], [[wikt:dry|dry]] or [[Freezing|frozen]] sites. Peat bogs also preserve leather and skin artifacts, but through a re-tanning process.&lt;ref&gt;Painter, T. J., “Chemical and Microbiological Aspects of the Preservation Process in Spagnum Peat”, in Turner, R.C., Scaife, R. G., Bog Bodies, New Discoveries and New Perspectives, British Museum Press, London, 1995, 88–99.&lt;/ref&gt; Water-logged archaeological sites provide the necessary conditions for the preservation of vegetable tanned leather. As an organic material, water-logged archaeological leather needs to be stabilized by an appropriate conservation method.&lt;ref&gt;E. Cameron / J. Spriggs / B. Wills, "The conservation of archaeological leather.", ''Conservation of Leather'', Oxford, 2006, pp. 244–261&lt;/ref&gt; Dry conditions may be found in [[desert]]s and at high altitudes but also within the walls of medieval and later period buildings where leather shoes were [[concealed shoes|concealed]] for superstitious reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Swann, J., 'Shoes Concealed in Buildings', ''Costume Society Journal'', No. 30, 1996, pp. 56–69&lt;/ref&gt; Ice fields, tundra and glaciers can occasionally preserve ancient leather artifacts through constant freezing.&lt;ref&gt;W. Groenman-van Waateringe /R. Goedecker-Ciolek, "The equipment made of hide and leather", ''Der Mann im Eis'' Band 1, Innsbruck, 1992, pp. 410–418&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examination of archaeological shoe finds==
Water-logged finds generally consist of loose components since the [[thread (yarn)|thread]]s used to [[sew]] the objects together does not survive humid [[burial]]. A tracking system should be used for keeping the loose components in order throughout the [[analysis]] and [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]] processes. For wet archaeological leather, the first step is cleaning gently in water with a small soft [[brush]]. Conservation is preferably performed after the [[document]]ation phase. Documentation consists of [[drawing]]s and written notes, [[photograph]]ic records are less useful since blackish leather does not show fine detail well. The first step for the Goubitz notation registration is an exact tracing of the fragment’s outline, usually positioned grain side down, flesh side up. Then [[symbol]]s that indicate the type of [[stitch (textile arts)|stitch]]es and seams are drawn in their appropriate place inside the outline.&lt;ref&gt;O. Goubitz, ''Stepping Through Time'', Zwolle, 2001. pp. 35–40&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sole (shoe)|Sole]] constructions (the way in which the upper parts of the shoe is fixed to the sole),&lt;ref&gt;O. Goubitz, ''Stepping Through Time'', Zwolle, 2001, p. 91-98&lt;/ref&gt; [[fastener|fastening method]] and ensembles of components from the same shoe as well as [[animal]] type, leather thickness, folds and creases should be noted. If present, decoration type and technique used should also be recorded.&lt;ref&gt;O. Goubitz, ''Stepping Through Time'', Zwolle, 2001, p.41-55&lt;/ref&gt;

Most archaeological recovered leather artifacts are parts of footwear and may be combined with [[wood]], [[fibre]] or [[metal]] parts. The technical details such as shoe construction technique, fastening method and fashion elements are used to establish a [[Typology (archaeology)|typology]] for a specific find group. Shoe type indicates the kinds of footwear such as [[boot]]s, shoes, pattens, overshoes, etcetera. Shoe style is the consistent combination of a fastening method, height, fashion and decoration elements on a significant quantity of recovered shoes. Style nomenclature based on find place's name has been partly established for Roman period finds.&lt;ref&gt;C. van Driel-Murray, 'Footwear in the North-Western Provinces of the Roman Empire',''Stepping Through Time'', Zwolle, 2001, pp. 362–327&lt;/ref&gt; Due to changes in fashion and the fact that shoes have a limited [[service life|life span]] due to use, footwear is a chronologically sensitive material excavation and represents a closely dated chronological source for archeology. The find context, stratigraphic placement and other [[Dating methodology (archaeology)|dating methods]] contribute to establishing a specific chronology. Further research for comparative parallel examples among the existing archaeological archives (collections, publications, reports) helps to define a relative chronology for the shoe types and styles.

'''Carnot's theorem''', developed in 1824 by  [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot]], also called '''Carnot's rule''', is a principle that specifies limits on the maximum efficiency any [[heat engine]] can obtain. The efficiency of a Carnot engine depends solely on the difference between the hot and cold temperature reservoirs.

Carnot's theorem states: 
*All heat engines between two heat reservoirs are less efficient than a [[Carnot heat engine]] operating between the same reservoirs.
*Every Carnot heat engine between a pair of heat reservoirs is equally efficient, regardless of the working substance employed or the operation details.

The formula for this maximum efficiency is
:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{\text{max}} = \eta_{\text{Carnot}} = 1 - \frac{T_\mathrm{C}}{T_\mathrm{H}}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[absolute temperature]] of the cold reservoir, ''T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[absolute temperature]] of the hot reservoir, and the efficiency &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is the ratio of the work done by the engine to the heat drawn out of the hot reservoir.

Based on modern thermodynamics, Carnot's theorem is a result of the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. Historically, it was based on contemporary [[caloric theory]] and preceded the establishment of the second law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashdocs.com/myvnxz/thermodynamics.html |title=A Very Brief History of Thermodynamics |date=2009 |author=John Murrell |accessdate=May 2, 2014 }} {{PDFWayback|url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/chemistry/documents/a_thermodynamics_history.pdf|date=20091122191251|size=142 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122191251/http://www.sussex.ac.uk/chemistry/documents/a_thermodynamics_history.pdf |date=November 22, 2009 }} KB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proof==
[[File:Carnot theorem paradox.jpg|thumb|300px|An impossible situation: A heat engine cannot drive a less efficient (reversible) heat engine without violating the second law of thermodynamics.]]

The proof of the Carnot theorem is a [[proof by contradiction]], or [[reductio ad absurdum]], as illustrated by the figure showing two heat engines operating between two reservoirs of different temperature. The heat engine with more efficiency (&lt;math&gt;\eta_M&lt;/math&gt;) is driving a heat engine with less efficiency (&lt;math&gt;\eta_L&lt;/math&gt;), causing the latter to act as a [[heat pump]]. This pair of engines receives no outside energy, and operates solely on the energy released when heat is transferred from the hot and into the cold reservoir. However, if &lt;math&gt;\eta_M&gt;\eta_L&lt;/math&gt;, then the net heat flow would be backwards, i.e., into the hot reservoir:

:&lt;math&gt;Q^\text{out}_\text{hot} = Q &lt; \frac{\eta_M}{\eta_L}Q=Q^\text{in}_\text{hot}&lt;/math&gt;.

It is generally agreed that this is impossible because it violates the [[second law of thermodynamics]].

We begin by verifying the values of work and heat flow depicted in the figure. First, we must point out an important caveat: the engine with less efficiency (&lt;math&gt;\eta_L&lt;/math&gt;) is being driven as a heat pump, and therefore must be a ''[[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]]'' engine. If the less efficient engine (&lt;math&gt;\eta_L&lt;/math&gt;) is not reversible, then the device could be built, but the expressions for work and heat flow shown in the figure would not be valid.

By restricting our discussion to cases where engine (&lt;math&gt;\eta_L&lt;/math&gt;) has less efficiency than engine (&lt;math&gt;\eta_M&lt;/math&gt;), we are able to simplify notation by adopting the convention that all symbols, &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; represent [[Sign (mathematics)#Terminology for signs|non-negative]] quantities (since the direction of energy flow never changes sign in all cases where &lt;math&gt;\eta_L\leqslant\eta_M&lt;/math&gt;). Conservation of energy demands that for each engine, the energy which enters, &lt;math&gt; E_{in} &lt;/math&gt;, must equal the energy which exits, &lt;math&gt; E_{out} &lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;E_{in}^{M} = Q = (1-\eta_M)Q + \eta_M Q = E_{out}^{M}  &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;E_{in}^{L} = \eta_M Q + \eta_M Q \left(\frac{1}{\eta_{L}}- 1 \right )=\frac{\eta_M}{\eta_L}Q = E_{out}^{L}  &lt;/math&gt;,

The figure is also consistent with the definition of [[Heat engine#Efficiency|efficiency]] as &lt;math&gt;\eta=W/Q_h&lt;/math&gt; for both engines:

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_M= \frac{W_M}{Q^M_h}=\frac{\eta_M Q}{Q}=\eta_M&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; \eta_L=\frac{W_L}{Q^L_h}=\frac{\eta_M Q}{\frac{\eta_M}{\eta_L}Q}=\eta_L&lt;/math&gt;.

It may seem odd that a hypothetical heat pump with low efficiency is being used to violate the second law of thermodynamics, but the [[figure of merit]] for refrigerator units is not efficiency, &lt;math&gt;W/Q_h&lt;/math&gt;, but the [[coefficient of performance]] (COP),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tipler|first=Paul|title=Physics for Scientists and Engineers|year=2008|publisher=Freeman|isbn=9781429201322|edition=6th|author2=Mosca, G.|chapter=19.2, 19.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
which is &lt;math&gt;Q_c/W&lt;/math&gt;. A reversible heat engine with low thermodynamic efficiency, &lt;math&gt;W/Q_h&lt;/math&gt; delivers more heat to the hot reservoir for a given amount of work when it is being driven as a heat pump.

Having established that the heat flow values shown in the figure are correct, Carnot's theorem may be proven for irreversible and the reversible heat engines.&lt;ref name=CarnotThoerem&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://seit.unsw.adfa.edu.au/staff/sites/hrp/Literature/articles/CarnotTheorem.pdf
|title=Lecture 10: Carnot theorem
|date=Feb 7, 2005
|accessdate=October 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reversible engines===
To see that every reversible engine operating between reservoirs &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt; must have the same efficiency, assume that two reversible heat engines have different values of &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;, and let the more efficient engine (M) drive the less efficient engine (L) as a heat pump. As the figure shows, this will cause heat to flow from the cold to the hot reservoir without any external work or energy, which violates the second law of thermodynamics. Therefore both (reversible) heat engines have the same efficiency, and we conclude that:

:''All reversible engines that operate between the same two heat reservoirs have the same efficiency.''

This is an important result because it helps establish the [[Clausius theorem]], which implies that the change in [[entropy]] is unique for all reversible processes.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ohanian|first=Hans|title=Principles of Physics|year=1994|publisher=W.W. Norton and Co.|isbn=039395773X|pages=438}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta S = \int_a^b \frac {dQ_{rev}}T &lt;/math&gt;,

over all paths (from '''''a''''' to '''''b''''' in ''V-T'' space). If this integral were not path independent, then entropy, [[S]], would lose its status as a [[state function|state variable]].&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.wwu.edu/vawter/PhysicsNet/Topics/ThermLaw2/ThermalProcesses.html, and http://www.itp.phys.ethz.ch/education/hs10/stat/slides/Laws_TD.pdf. Both retrieved 13 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irreversible engines===
If one of the engines is irreversible, it must be the (M) engine, placed so that it reverse drives the less efficient but reversible (L) engine. But if this irreversible engine is more efficient than the reversible engine, (i.e., if &lt;math&gt;\eta_M &gt;\eta_L&lt;/math&gt;), then the second law of thermodynamics is violated. And, since the Carnot cycle represents a reversible engine, we have the first part of Carnot's theorem:

:No irreversible engine is more efficient than the Carnot engine operating between the same two reservoirs.

==Definition of thermodynamic temperature==
{{main|Thermodynamic temperature#Definition of thermodynamic temperature|l1=Definition of thermodynamic temperature
}}
The efficiency of the engine is the work divided by the heat introduced to the system or
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\eta = \frac {w_{cy}}{q_H} = \frac{q_H-q_C}{q_H} = 1 - \frac{q_C}{q_H}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where w&lt;sub&gt;cy&lt;/sub&gt; is the work done per cycle. Thus, the efficiency depends only on q&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;/q&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;.

Because all reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient, all reversible heat engines operating between temperatures ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; must have the same efficiency, meaning the efficiency is a function only of the two temperatures:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\frac{q_C}{q_H} = f(T_H,T_C)&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

In addition, a reversible heat engine operating between temperatures ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; must have the same efficiency as one consisting of two cycles, one between ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and another (intermediate) temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the second between ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This can only be the case if
:&lt;math&gt;
f(T_1,T_3) = \frac{q_3}{q_1} = \frac{q_2 q_3} {q_1 q_2} = f(T_1,T_2)f(T_2,T_3).
&lt;/math&gt;

Specializing to the case that &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; is a fixed reference temperature: the temperature of the triple point of water. Then for any ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;f(T_2,T_3) = \frac{f(T_1,T_3)}{f(T_1,T_2)} = \frac{273.16 \cdot f(T_1,T_3)}{273.16 \cdot f(T_1,T_2)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, if thermodynamic temperature is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;T = 273.16 \cdot f(T_1,T) \,&lt;/math&gt;

then the function ''f'', viewed as a function of thermodynamic temperature, is
:&lt;math&gt;f(T_2,T_3) = \frac{T_3}{T_2},&lt;/math&gt;
and the reference temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; has the value 273.16. (Of course any reference temperature and any positive numerical value could be used—the choice here corresponds to the [[Kelvin]] scale.)

It follows immediately that
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\frac{q_C}{q_H} = f(T_H,T_C) = \frac{T_C}{T_H}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

Substituting Equation {{EquationNote|3}} back into Equation {{EquationNote|1}} gives a relationship for the efficiency in terms of temperature:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\eta = 1 - \frac{q_C}{q_H} = 1 - \frac{T_C}{T_H}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

==Applicability to fuel cells and batteries==
Since [[fuel cell]]s and [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] can generate useful power when all components of the system are at the same temperature (&lt;math&gt;T=T_H=T_C&lt;/math&gt;), they are clearly not limited by Carnot's theorem, which states that no power can be generated when &lt;math&gt;T_H=T_C&lt;/math&gt;. This is because Carnot's theorem applies to engines converting thermal energy to work, whereas fuel cells and batteries instead convert chemical energy to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the [[Grand Unified Theory]] of [[particle physics]], the '''desert''' refers to a theorized gap in energy scales, between the [[teraelectronvolt|TeV]] scale{{clarify|does this mean electroweak scale?|date=May 2017}} and the [[GUT scale]], in which no interactions appear.

It can also be described as a gap in the [[orders of magnitude (length)|length]]s involved, with no new physics below 10&lt;sup&gt;−18&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[metre|m]] (the currently probed length scale) and above 10&lt;sup&gt;−31&lt;/sup&gt; m (the GUT length scale).

The idea of the desert was motivated by the observation of approximate, order of magnitude, [[gauge coupling unification]] at the GUT scale.{{elucidate|date=May 2017}} Adding interactions at an intermediate scale generically disrupts{{why|date=May 2017}} the gauge coupling unification.

==Standard model particles==
All the [[Standard Model]] particles were discovered below the [[energy scale]] of approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]] or 1&amp;nbsp;TeV.

{{expand section|date=May 2017}}

==The desert==
Above these energies, “desert theories”{{which|date=May 2017}} predict there are no [[particle]]s to be discovered until reaching the scale of approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;eV{{why|date=May 2017}}.

The desert theory is attractive{{whom|date=May 2017}} because, in such a scenario, measurements of TeV scale physics at the [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]] and the near-future [[International Linear Collider|ILC]] will allow extrapolation all the way up to the GUT scale. The downside of the particle desert is that [[experimental physics]] will simply have nothing more fundamental to discover, over a very long period of time, which, depending on the rate of [[timeline of particle physics technology|increase in experiment energies]], might span centuries, millennia or more. Presumably, even if the energy achieved in the LHC, ~&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;eV, were increased by up to 12&amp;nbsp;orders of magnitude, this would only result in producing more copious amounts of the particles known today, with no underlying structure being probed. The aforementioned timespan might be shortened by observing the GUT scale through a radical development in [[particle accelerator|accelerator physics]], or by a non-accelerator observational technology, such as examining tremendously high energy [[cosmic ray]] events, or another, yet undeveloped technology.

Alternatives to the desert exhibit particles and interactions unfolding with every few orders of magnitude increase in the energy scale.

==MSSM Desert==
With the [[Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model]], adjustment of parameters can make this unification exact{{elucidate|date=May 2017}}. This unification is not unique.

{{expand section|date=May 2017}}

==Mirror matter desert==
Scenarios like the [[Mirror matter|Katoptron model]] can also lead to exact unification after a similar energetic desert. If [[neutrino mass]]es are due to a [[seesaw mechanism]], the seesaw scale should lie within the desert.{{why|date=May 2017}}

'''Enki Catena''' (''Enki'' from the Assyro-Babylonian principal water god of the [[Abzu|Apsu]], and ''catena'' from Latin meaning "chain") is a [[crater chain]] on [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] measuring {{convert|161.3|km|mi}} long.

This chain of 13 craters probably formed by a [[comet]] which was pulled into pieces by [[Jupiter]]'s gravity as it passed too close to the planet. Soon after this breakup, the 13 fragments crashed onto Ganymede in rapid succession. The Enki craters formed across the sharp boundary between areas of bright terrain and dark terrain, delimited by a thin trough running diagonally across the center of this image. The ejecta deposit surrounding the craters appears very bright on the bright terrain. Even though all the craters formed nearly simultaneously, it is difficult to discern any [[ejecta]] deposit on the dark terrain. This may be because the impacts excavated and mixed dark material into the ejecta and the resulting mix is not apparent against the dark background.

'''Food irradiation''' is the process of exposing food and food packaging to [[ionizing radiation]]. Ionizing radiation, such as from gamma rays, x-rays or electron beams, is energy that can be transmitted without direct contact to the source of the energy ([[radiation]]) capable of freeing [[electron]]s from their atomic bonds ([[ionization]]) in the targeted food.&lt;ref name="FI"&gt;{{cite book |author=WHO |title=Food Irradiation: A technique for preserving and improving the safety of food |year=1988 |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/38544 |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva, Switzerland |isbn=978-924-154240-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inspection.gc.ca/food/information-for-consumers/fact-sheets/irradiation/eng/1332358607968/1332358680017 "Food Irradiation"] Canadian Food Inspection Agency. March 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The radiation can be emitted by a [[Radioactivity|radioactive]] substance or generated electrically. This treatment is used to improve food safety by extending product shelf-life (preservation), reducing the risk of foodborne illness, delaying or eliminating [[sprouting]] or [[ripening]], by sterilization of foods, and as a means of controlling insects and invasive pests.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/IrradiatedFoodPackaging/ucm261680.htm|title=Irradiated Food &amp; Packaging - Food Irradiation: What You Need to Know|last=Nutrition|first=Center for Food Safety and Applied|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food irradiation primarily extends the shelf-life of irradiated foods by effectively destroying organisms responsible for spoilage and foodborne illness and inhibiting sprouting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although consumer perception of foods treated with irradiation is more negative than those processed by other means, because people imagine that the food is radioactive or mutated,&lt;ref name="Conley1992"&gt;Conley, S.T., What do consumers think about irradiated foods, FSIS Food Safety Review (Fall 1992), 11-15&lt;/ref&gt; all independent research, the [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), and [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) have confirmed irradiation to be safe.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JFDiehl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JECFI" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JSGHDI" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO_Irr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FDA1986" /&gt;

==Uses==
Irradiation is used to reduce or eliminate the risk of food-borne illnesses, prevent or slow down spoilage, arrest maturation or sprouting and as a treatment against pests. Depending on the dose, some or all of the pathogenic organisms, [[microorganism]]s, [[bacteria]], and [[virus]]es present are destroyed, slowed down, or rendered incapable of reproduction. Irradiation cannot return spoiled or over-ripe food to a fresh state. If this food was processed by irradiation, further spoilage would cease and ripening would slow down, yet the irradiation would not destroy the toxins or repair the texture, color, or taste of the food.&lt;ref name="Loaharanu2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loaharanu|first=Paisan|year=1990|title=Food irradiation: Facts or fiction?.|url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull322/32205784448.pdf|journal=IAEA Bulletin|issue=32.2|pages=44–48|accessdate=March 3, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304152545/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull322/32205784448.pdf|archivedate=March 4, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When targeting bacteria, most foods are irradiated to significantly reduce the number of active microbes, not to sterilize all microbes in the product. In this respect it is similar to pasteurization.

Irradiation is used to create safe foods for people at high risk of infection, or for conditions where food must be stored for long periods of time and proper storage conditions are not available. Foods that can tolerate irradiation at sufficient doses are treated to ensure that the product is completely [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]]. This is most commonly done with rations for astronauts, and special diets for hospital patients.

Irradiation is used to create shelf-stable products. Since irradiation reduces the populations of spoilage microorganisms, and because pre-packed food can be irradiated, the packaging prevents recontamination of the final product.&lt;ref name="FI" /&gt;

Irradiation is used to reduce post-harvest losses. It reduces populations of spoilage micro-organisms in the food and can slow down the speed at which enzymes change the food, and therefore slows spoilage and ripening, and inhibits sprouting (e.g., of potato, onion, and garlic).&lt;ref name="Loaharanu"/&gt;

Food is also irradiated to prevent the spread of invasive pest species through trade in fresh vegetables and fruits, either within countries, or trade across international boundaries. Pests such as insects could be transported to new habitats through trade in fresh produce which could significantly affect agricultural production and the environment were they to establish themselves. This "[[phytosanitary irradiation]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://journals.fcla.edu/flaent/article/view/88667 | title=Phytosanitary irradiation: An overview| journal=Florida Entomologist| volume=99| issue=6| pages=1–13| date=2016-11-20| last1=Blackburn| first1=Carl M.| last2=Parker| first2=Andrew G.| last3=Hénon| first3=Yves M.| last4=Hallman| first4=Guy J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; aims to render any hitch-hiking pest incapable of breeding. The pests are [[sterility (physiology)|sterilized]] when the food is treated by low doses of irradiation. In general, the higher doses required to destroy pests such as insects, mealybugs, mites, moths, and butterflies either affect the look or taste, or cannot be tolerated by fresh produce.&lt;ref&gt;Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture, IAEA, International Database on Insect Disinfestation and Sterilization&amp;nbsp;– IDIDAS&amp;nbsp;– http://www-ididas.iaea.org/IDIDAS/default.htm last visited November 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Low dosage treatments (less than 1000 gray) enables trade across quarantine boundaries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/sphs/sphr/2015/00000011/00000003/art00008 | title=Australia export programmes for irradiated fresh produce to New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may also help reduce spoilage.

==Impact==
Irradiation reduces the risk of infection and spoilage, does not make food radioactive, and the food is shown to be safe, but it does cause chemical reactions that alter the food and therefore alters the chemical makeup, nutritional content, and the sensory qualities of the food.&lt;ref name="NYT_P.O."&gt;Martin, Andrew. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/02/business/02irradiate.html?adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1261545694-KGCNC1z9SSW95acAk0gz0g Spinach and Peanuts, With a Dash of Radiation.] ''[[The New York Times]].'' February 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the potential secondary impacts of irradiation are hypothetical, while others are demonstrated. These effects include cumulative impacts to pathogens, people, and the environment due to the reduction of food quality, the transportation and storage of radioactive goods, and destruction of pathogens, changes in the way we relate to food and how irradiation changes the food production and shipping industries.

===Immediate effects===
The radiation source supplies energetic particles or waves. As these waves/particles pass through a target material they [[Event (particle physics)|collide with other particles]]. Around the sites of these collisions [[chemical bonds]] are broken, creating short lived radicals (e.g. the [[hydroxyl radical]], the hydrogen atom and [[solvated electron]]s). These radicals cause further chemical changes by bonding with and or stripping particles from nearby molecules. When collisions damage [[DNA]] or [[RNA]], effective [[reproduction]] becomes unlikely, also when collisions occur in cells, [[cell division]] is often suppressed.&lt;ref name="FI"/&gt;

Irradiation (within the accepted energy limits, as 10 MeV for electrons, 5 MeV for X-rays [US 7.5 MeV] and gamma rays from [[Cobalt-60]]) can not make food radioactive, but it does produce [[#Chemical changes|radiolytic products, and free radicals]] in the food. A few of these products are unique, but not considered dangerous.&lt;ref name="EPA-food-safety" /&gt;

Irradiation can also alter the [[#Food quality|nutritional content and flavor of foods]], much like cooking.&lt;ref name="EPA-food-safety"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/rpdweb00/sources/food_safety.html |title=Radiation Protection-Food Safety|publisher=epa.gov |date= |accessdate=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scale of these chemical changes is not unique. Cooking, smoking, salting, and other less novel techniques, cause the food to be altered so drastically that its original nature is almost unrecognizable, and must be called by a different name. Storage of food also causes dramatic chemical changes, ones that eventually lead to deterioration and spoilage.&lt;ref name="ROT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science-at-home.org/kid-question-rotting/ |title=kid question rotting |accessdate=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Misconceptions====
A major concern is that irradiation might cause chemical changes that are harmful to the consumer. Several national expert groups and two international expert groups evaluated the available data and concluded that any food at any dose is wholesome and safe to consume as long as it remains palatable and maintains its technical properties (e.g. feel, texture, or color).&lt;ref name="JECFI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JSGHDI"/&gt;

Irradiated food does not become radioactive, just as an object exposed to light does not start producing light. Radioactivity is the ability of a substance to emit high energy particles. When particles hit the target materials they may free other highly energetic particles. This ends shortly after the end of the exposure, much like objects stop reflecting light when the source is turned off and warm objects emit heat until they cool down but do not continue to produce their own heat. To modify a material so that it keeps emitting radiation (induce radiation) the atomic cores ([[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]]) of the atoms in the target material must be modified.

It is impossible for food irradiators to induce radiation in a product. Irradiators emit [[electron]]s or [[photon]]s and the radiation is intrinsically radiated at precisely known strengths ([[wavelength]]s for photons, and speeds for electrons). These radiated particles at these strengths can never be strong enough to modify the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of the targeted atom in the food, regardless of how many particles hit the target material, and radioactivity can not be induced without modifying the nucleus.&lt;ref name="EPA-food-safety"/&gt;

====Chemical changes====
Compounds known as free radicals form when food is irradiated. Most of these are oxidizers (i.e., accept electrons) and some react very strongly. According to the free-radical theory of aging excessive amounts of these free radicals can lead to cell injury and cell death, which may contribute to many diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rajamani Karthikeyan, Manivasagam T, Anantharaman P, Balasubramanian T, Somasundaram ST |title=Chemopreventive effect of Padina boergesenii extracts on ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA)-induced oxidative damage in Wistar rats |journal=J.

{{further|Free-radical theory of aging|Oxidative stress}}

Most of the substances found in irradiated food are also found in food that has been subjected to other food processing treatments, and are therefore not unique. One family of chemicals (2ACB's) are uniquely formed by irradiation (unique radiolytic products), and this product is nontoxic. When fatty acids are irradiated, a family of compounds called 2-alkylcyclobutanones (2-ACBs) are produced. These are thought to be unique radiolytic products.
When irradiating food, all other chemicals occur in a lower or comparable frequency to other food processing techniques.&lt;ref name="JECFI" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JSGHDI" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO1994"&gt;anon., Safety and nutritional adequacy of irradiated food, WHO, Geneva, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EFSA2011"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2011.1930|title=Scientific Opinion on the Chemical Safety of Irradiation of Food|journal=EFSA Journal|volume=9|issue=4|pages=1930|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the quantities in which they occur in irradiated food are lower or similar to the quantities formed in heat treatments.&lt;ref name="JECFI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JSGHDI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EFSA2011" /&gt;

The radiation doses to cause toxic changes are much higher than the doses used during irradiation, and taking into account the presence of 2-ACBs along with what is known of free radicals, these results lead to the conclusion that there is no significant risk from radiolytic products.&lt;ref name="JFDiehl"/&gt;

====Food quality====
Ionizing radiation can change food quality but in general very high levels of radiation treatment (many thousands of gray) are necessary to adversely change nutritional content, as well as the sensory qualities (taste, appearance, and texture). Irradiation to the doses used commercially to treat food have very little negative impact on the sensory qualities and nutrient content in foods. When irradiation is used to maintain food quality for a longer period of time (improve the shelf stability of some sensory qualities and nutrients) the improvement means that more consumers have access to the original taste, texture, appearance, and nutrients.&lt;ref name="Antioxidant" /&gt;&lt;ref name="velvet bean" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The changes in quality and nutrition depend on the degree of treatment and may vary greatly from food to food.&lt;ref name="Loaharanu"/&gt;

There is some degradation of vitamins caused by irradiation, but is similar to or even less than the loss caused by other processes that achieve the same result. Other processes like chilling, freezing, drying, and heating also result in some vitamin loss.&lt;ref name="Loaharanu"/&gt;

The changes in the flavor of fatty foods like meats, nuts and oils are sometimes noticeable, while the changes in lean products like fruits and vegetables are less so. Some studies by the irradiation industry show that for some properly treated fruits and vegetables irradiation is seen by consumers to improve the sensory qualities of the product compared to untreated fruits and vegetables.&lt;ref name="Loaharanu"/&gt;

=====Quality Impact on Minimally Processed Vegetables=====
[[Watercress]] (''Nasturtium Officinale'') is a rapidly growing aquatic or semi aquatic perennial plant. Because chemical agents do not provide efficient microbial reductions, watercress has been tested with gamma irradiation treatment in order to improve both safety and the shelf life of the product.&lt;ref&gt;Ramos, B., Miller, F.

In a &lt;u&gt;Food Chemistry&lt;/u&gt; food journal, scientists studied the suitability of gamma irradiation of 1, 2, and 5 kGy for preserving quality parameters of the fresh cut watercress at around 4 degrees Celsius for 7 days.  They determined that a 2 kGy dose of irradiation was the dose that contained most similar qualities to non-stored control samples, which is one of the goals of irradiation.&lt;ref name="Antioxidant"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bahramikia S., Yazdanparast R. | year = 2010 | title = Antioxidant efficacy of Nasturtium officinale extracts using various in vitro assay systems | url = | journal = Journal of Acupuncture and Meridian Studies | volume = 3 | issue = 4| pages = 283–290 | doi=10.1016/s2005-2901(10)60049-0| pmid = 21185544 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  2 kGy preserved high levels of reducing sugars and favoured PUFA; while samples of the 5 kGy dose revealed high contents of sucrose and MUFA.  Both cases the watercress samples obtained healthier fatty acids profiles.&lt;ref name="velvet bean"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bhat R. |author2=Sridhar K.

===Long-term impacts===
If the majority of food was irradiated at high-enough levels to significantly decrease its nutritional content, there would be an increased risk of developing nutritionally-based illnesses if additional steps, such as changes in eating habits, were not taken to mitigate this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Louria |first=Donald B. |title=Food Irradiation: Unresolved Issues |date=August 1, 2001 |url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/33/3/378.full.pdf |journal=[[Clinical Infectious Diseases]] |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=378–380 |pmid=11438907 |doi=10.1086/321907}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, for at least three studies on cats, the consumption of irradiated food was associated with a [[Leukoencephalopathy|loss of tissue in the myelin sheath]], leading to reversible paralysis. Researchers suspect that reduced levels of vitamin A and high levels of free radicals may be the cause.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal| title=The experimental induction of leukoencephalomyelopathy in cats| pmid=19605900 | doi=10.1354/vp.08-VP-0336-C-FL | volume=46| issue=6 |vauthors=Caulfield CD, Kelly JP, Jones BR, Worrall S, Conlon L, Palmer AC, Cassidy JP | journal=Vet Pathol| pages=1258–69 | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is thought to be specific to cats and has not been reproduced in any other animal. To produce these effects, the cats were fed solely on food that was irradiated at a dose at least five times higher than the maximum allowable dose.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;

It may seem reasonable to assume that irradiating food might lead to radiation-tolerant strains, similar to the way that strains of bacteria have developed [[Antimicrobial resistance|resistance]] to antibiotics. Bacteria develop a resistance to antibiotics after an individual uses antibiotics repeatedly. Much like pasteurization plants, products that pass through irradiation plants are processed once, and are not processed and reprocessed. Cycles of heat treatment have been shown to produce heat-tolerant bacteria, yet no problems have appeared so far in pasteurization plants. Furthermore, when the irradiation dose is chosen to target a specific species of microbe, it is calibrated to doses several times the value required to target the species. This ensures that the process randomly destroys all members of a target species.&lt;ref name="D_values"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/8846796/Prejeanpap.html |title=FOOD IRRADIATION: WHY AREN'T WE USING IT? |publisher=harvard.edu|year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the more irradiation-tolerant members of the target species are not given any evolutionary advantage. Without evolutionary advantage, [[Selection (biology)|selection]] does not occur. As to the irradiation process directly producing mutations that lead to more virulent, radiation-resistant strains, the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Food found that there is no evidence; on the contrary, irradiation has been found to cause loss of virulence and infectivity, as mutants are usually less competitive and less adapted.&lt;ref name="SCF Revision"/&gt;

====Misconceptions====
Some who advocate against food irradiation argue the safety of irradiated food is not scientifically proven because there are a lack of long-term studies &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.organicconsumers.org/old_articles/irrad/irradfact.php|title=What's wrong with food irradiation?|website=www.organicconsumers.org|access-date=2017-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170417160313/https://www.organicconsumers.org/old_articles/irrad/irradfact.php#|archive-date=April 17, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolke"&gt;R.L.

The below experiments are cited by food irradiation opponents, but either could not be verified in later experiments, could not be clearly attributed to the radiation effect, or could be attributed to an inappropriate design of the experiment.&lt;ref name="JFDiehl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Loaharanu"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loaharanu |first=Paisan |year=1990 |title=Food irradiation: Facts or fiction?. |url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull322/32205784448.pdf |journal=IAEA Bulletin |issue=32.2 |pages=44–48 |accessdate=March 3, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304152545/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull322/32205784448.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* India's National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) found an elevated rate of cells with more than one set of genes ([[polyploidy]]) in humans and animals when fed wheat that was irradiated recently (within 12 weeks). Upon analysis, scientists determined that the techniques used by the NIN allowed for too much human error and statistical variation; therefore, the results were unreliable. After multiple studies by independent agencies and scientists, no correlation between polyploidy and irradiation of food could be found.&lt;ref name="Loaharanu"/&gt;

===Indirect effects of irradiation===
The indirect effects of irradiation are the concerns and benefits of irradiation that are related to how making food irradiation a common process will change the world, with emphasis on the system of food production.

If irradiation was to become common in the food handling process there would be a reduction of the prevalence of foodborne illness and potentially the eradication of specific pathogens.&lt;ref name="Ethiopia_Tsetse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/ethiopias-using-radiation-to-eradicate-tsetse-flies/1545361.html |title=Ethiopia Is Using Radiation to Eradicate Tsetse Flies |publisher=voanews.com |date=November 14, 2012 |accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, multiple studies suggest that an increased rate of pathogen growth may occur when irradiated food is cross-contaminated with a pathogen, as the competing spoilage organisms are no longer present.&lt;ref name="ochratoxin"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc=169778 |title=Production of ochratoxin A by Aspergillus ochraceus NRRL-3174 before and after exposures to 60Co irradiation |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=349–353 |date=March 31, 1976 |author1=Applegate |first1=K. L. |last2=Chipley |first2=J. R. |pmid=938031 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This being said, cross contamination itself becomes less prevalent with an increase in usage of irradiated foods.&lt;ref name="Hospital Kitchen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ift.org/knowledge-center/read-ift-publications/science-reports/scientific-status-summaries/irradiation-of-food.aspx|title=SCIENTIFIC STATUS SUMMARY Irradiation of Food |publisher= Institute of Food Technologists’ Expert Panel on Food Safety and Nutrition in Food Technology |date=January 1998 |accessdate=May 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to remove bacterial contamination through post-processing by irradiation may reduce the fear of mishandling food which could cultivate a cavalier attitude toward hygiene and result in [[contamination|contaminants]] other than bacteria. However, concerns that the pasteurization of milk would lead to increased contamination of milk were prevalent when mandatory pasteurization was introduced, but these fears never materialized after adoption of this law. Therefore, it is unlikely for irradiation to cause an increase of illness due to nonbacteria-based contamination.&lt;ref name="E-coli Scare"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/skstockgrowers/docs/beef_business_nov_2012/7 |title=Does the XL Foods E-coli Scare Make the Case for Irradiation? |publisher=issuu.com |date=February 11, 2001 |accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Up to the point where the food is processed by irradiation, the food is processed in the same way as all other food. To treat the food, they are exposed to a radioactive source, for a set period of time to achieve a desired dose. Radiation may be emitted by a radioactive substance, or by X-ray and electron beam accelerators. Special precautions are taken to ensure the food stuffs never come in contact with the radioactive substances and that the personnel and the environment are protected from exposure radiation.&lt;ref name="sterigenics"&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.sterigenics.com/services/food_safety/food_irradiation__questions_answers.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Irradiation treatments are typically classified by dose (high, medium, and low), but are sometimes classified by the effects of the treatment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.foodcont.2008.07.023|title=The RADURA-terminology and food irradiation|journal=Food Control|volume=20|issue=5|pages=526–528|year=2009|last1=Ehlermann|first1=Dieter A.E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[radappertization]], [[radicidation]] and [[radurization]]). Food irradiation is sometimes referred to as "cold pasteurization"&lt;ref&gt;Cold Pasteurization of Food By Irradiation by Tim Roberts, Extension Specialist, Food Safety, Virginia Tech; Publication Number 458-300, posted August 1998 {{cite web |url=http://www.ext.vt.edu/pubs/foods/458-300/458-300.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102010926/http://www.ext.vt.edu/pubs/foods/458-300/458-300.html |archive-date=January 2, 2007 |title= |dead-url=bot: unknown |accessdate=June 1, 2016 |df=mdy-all }} retrieved on November 15, 2007 {{cite web |url=http://www.ext.vt.edu/pubs/foods/458-300/458-300.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102010926/http://www.ext.vt.edu/pubs/foods/458-300/458-300.html |archive-date=January 2, 2007 |title= |dead-url=yes |accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "electronic pasteurization"&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.,'' The Truth about Irradiated Meat, CONSUMER REPORTS 34-37 (August 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; because ionizing the food does not heat the food to high temperatures during the process, and the effect is similar to heat pasteurization. The term "cold pasteurization" is controversial because the term may be used to disguise the fact the food has been irradiated and pasteurization and irradiation are fundamentally different processes.

Treatment costs vary as a function of dose and facility usage. A pallet or tote is typically exposed for several minutes to hours depending on dose. Low-dose applications such as disinfestation of fruit range between US$0.01/lbs and US$0.08/lbs while higher-dose applications can cost as much as US$0.20/lbs.&lt;ref name="ozone"/&gt;

=== Packaging ===
Food processors and manufacturers today struggle with using affordable, efficient packaging materials for irradiation based processing. The implementation of irradiation on prepackaged foods has been found to impact foods by inducing specific chemical alterations to the food packaging material that migrates into the food. [[Cross-link]]ing in various plastics can lead to physical and chemical modifications that can increase the overall molecular weight. On the other hand, chain scission is fragmentation of polymer chains that leads to a molecular weight reduction.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Dosimetry===
The radiation absorbed dose is the amount energy absorbed per unit weight of the target material. Dose is used because, when the same substance is given the same dose, similar changes are observed in the target material. The [[SI unit]] for dose is [[Gray (unit)|grays]] (Gy or [[Joule|J]]/[[Kilogram|kg]]). [[Dosimeter]]s are used to measure dose, and are small components that, when exposed to [[ionizing radiation]], change measurable physical attributes to a degree that can be correlated to the dose received. Measuring dose ([[dosimetry]]) involves exposing one or more dosimeters along with the target material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/pdf/TRS409_scr.pdf |title=anon., Dosimetry for Food Irradiation, IAEA, Vienna, 2002, Technical Reports Series No. 409 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. Mehta, Radiation Processing Dosimetry&amp;nbsp;– A practical manual, 2006, GEX Corporation, Centennial, US&lt;/ref&gt;

For purposes of legislation doses are divided into low (up to 1 kGy), medium (1 kGy to 10 kGy), and high-dose applications (above 10 kGy).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; High-dose applications are above those currently permitted in the US for commercial food items by the FDA and other regulators around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nucleus.iaea.org/ifa/|title=Irradiated Food Authorization Database (IFA)|publisher=|date=|accessdate=March 19, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319174736/http://nucleus.iaea.org/ifa/|archivedate=March 19, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though these doses are approved for non commercial applications, such as sterilizing frozen meat for [[NASA]] [[astronauts]] (doses of 44 kGy)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/opa-fdir.html |title=U.

Gamma irradiation is produced from the radioisotopes [[cobalt-60]] and [[caesium-137]], which are derived by neutron bombardment of cobalt-59 and as a nuclear source by-product, respectively.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Cobalt-60 is the most common source of gamma rays for food irradiation in commercial scale facilities as it is water insoluble and hence has little risk of environmental contamination by leakage into the water systems.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As for transportation of the radiation source, cobalt-60 is transported in special trucks that prevent release of radiation and meet standards mentioned in the Regulations for Safe Transport of Radioactive Materials of the International Atomic Energy Act.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://foodirradiation.org/PDF/FIPA%20QandA.pdf|title=Food Irradiation Q and A|first=Food Irradiation Processing Alliance|date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The special trucks must meet high safety standards and pass extensive tests to be approved to ship radiation sources. Conversely, caesium-137, is water soluble and poses a risk of environmental contamination. Insufficient quantities are available for large scale commercial use. An incident where water-soluble caesium-137 leaked into the source storage pool requiring [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission|NRC]] intervention&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/gen-comm/info-notices/1989/in89082.html|title=Information Notice No. 89-82: RECENT SAFETY-RELATED INCIDENTS AT LARGE IRRADIATORS|date=|publisher=Nrc.gov|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; has led to near elimination of this radioisotope.
[[File:Cobalt 60 stored under water when not in use.jpg|thumb|Cobalt 60 stored in Gamma Irradiation machine]]
Gamma irradiation is widely used due to its high penetration depth and dose uniformity, allowing for large-scale applications with high through puts.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Additionally, gamma irradiation is significantly less expensive than using an X-ray source  In most designs, the radioisotope, contained in stainless steel pencils, is stored in a water-filled storage pool which absorbs the radiation energy when not in use. For treatment, the source is lifted out of the storage tank, and product contained in totes is passed around the pencils to achieve required processing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Electron beam ====
{{See also|Electron beam processing}}
Treatment of electron beams is created as a result of high energy electrons in an accelerator that generates electrons accelerated to 99% the speed of light.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This system uses electrical energy and can be powered on and off. The high power correlates with a higher throughput and lower unit cost, but electron beams have low dose uniformity and a penetration depth of centimeters.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Therefore, electron beam treatment works for products that have low thickness.

==== X-ray ====
[[X-ray]]s are produced by bombardment of dense target material with high energy accelerated electrons(this process is known as [[bremsstrahlung]]-conversion), giving rise to a continuous energy spectrum.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Heavy metals, such as [[tantalum]] and [[tungsten]], are used because of their high atomic numbers and high melting temperatures.Tantalum is usually preferred versus tungsten for industrial, large-area, high-power targets because it is more workable than tungsten and has a higher threshold energy for induced reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/41/097/41097063.pdf|title=RADIATION PROCESSING WITH HIGH-ENERGY X-RAYS}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like electron beams, x-rays do not require the use of radioactive materials and can be turned off when not in use. X-rays have high penetration depths and high dose uniformity but they are a very expensive source of irradiation as only 8% of the incident energy is converted into X-rays.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Cost===
[[File:E-beam-x-ray-gamma-efficiency.jpg|200px|thumbnail|Efficiency illustration of the different radiation technologies (electron beam, X-ray, gamma rays)]]
The cost of food irradiation is influenced by dose requirements, the food's tolerance of radiation, handling conditions, i.e., packaging and stacking requirements, construction costs, financing arrangements, and other variables particular to the situation.&lt;ref&gt;(Forsythe and Evangel 1993, USDA 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Irradiation is a capital-intensive technology requiring a substantial initial investment, ranging from $1&amp;nbsp;million to $5&amp;nbsp;million. In the case of large research or contract irradiation facilities, major capital costs include a radiation source, hardware (irradiator, totes and conveyors, control systems, and other auxiliary equipment), land (1 to 1.5&amp;nbsp;acres), radiation shield, and warehouse. Operating costs include

salaries (for fixed and variable labor), utilities, maintenance, taxes/insurance, cobalt-60 replenishment, general utilities, and miscellaneous operating costs.&lt;ref name="ozone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/Ozone/mbr/casestudies/volume2/irad2.html |title=The Use of Irradiation for Post-Harvest and Quarantine Commodity Control &amp;#124; Ozone Depletion – Regulatory Programs &amp;#124; U.S. EPA |date= |accessdate=March 19, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060421093513/http://www.epa.gov/Ozone/mbr/casestudies/volume2/irad2.html |archivedate=April 21, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;(Kunstadt et al., USDA 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Perishable food items, like fruits, vegetables and meats would still require to be handled in the cold chain, so all other supply chain costs remain the same.

== Public perception ==
Negative connotations associated with the word "radiation" are thought to be responsible for low consumer acceptance. Several national expert groups and two international expert groups evaluated the available data and concluded that any food at any dose is wholesome and safe to consume.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gmaonline.org/downloads/research-and-reports/SPP_Irradiation5.pdf|title=Food Irradiation Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irradiation has been approved by many countries. For example, in the U.S. the FDA has approved food irradiation for over fifty years. However, in the past decade the major growth area is for fruits and vegetables that are irradiated to prevent the spread of pests. In the early 2000s in the US, irradiated meat was common at some grocery stores, but because of lack of consumer demand, it is no longer common. Because consumer demand for irradiated food is low, reducing the spoilage between manufacturer and consumer purchase and reducing the risk of food borne illness is currently not sufficient incentive for most manufacturers to supplement their process with irradiation.&lt;ref name="NYT_P.O." /&gt; Nevertheless, food irradiation does take place commercially and volumes are in general increasing at a slow rate, even in the European Union where all member countries allow the irradiation of dried herbs spices and vegetable seasonings but only a few allow other foods to be sold as irradiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/biosafety/irradiation/reports_en | title=Annual Reports - Food Safety - European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are some consumers who choose not to purchase irradiated food, a sufficient market has existed for retailers to have continuously stocked irradiated products for years.&lt;ref name="StewartPR"&gt;P. B. Roberts and Y. M. Hénon, Consumer response to irradiated food: purchase versus perception, Stewart Postharvest Review, September 2015, Vol. 11 (3:5), {{ISSN|1745-9656}}. http://www.foodirradiation.org/pages/Stewart/Roberts.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; When labeled irradiated food is offered for retail sale, these consumers buy it and re-purchase it, indicating that it is possible to successfully market irradiated foods, therefore retailers not stocking irradiated foods might be a major bottleneck to the wider adoption of irradiated foods.&lt;ref name="StewartPR" /&gt; It is however, widely believed that consumer perception of foods treated with irradiation is more negative than those processed by other means&lt;ref name="Conley1992" /&gt; and some industry studies indicate the number of consumers concerned about the safety of irradiated food decreased between 1985 and 1995 to levels comparable to those of people concerned about food additives and preservatives.&lt;ref&gt;Consumer Attitudes and Market Response to Irradiated Food, Author: Bruhn, Christine M.1 Journal of Food Protection, Volume 58, Number 2, February 1995, pp. 175–181(7), Publisher: International Association for Food Protection&lt;/ref&gt; Even though is it is untrue "People think the product is radioactive," said Harlan Clemmons, president of Sadex, a food irradiation company based in Sioux City, Iowa.&lt;ref name="NYT_spinach"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/22/health/policy/22spinach.html?ex=1377144000&amp;en=4d87f8791e3baa62&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink Harris, Gardinier, "F.D.A. Allows Irradiation of Some Produce", ''The New York Times'', August 22, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these concerns and the increased cost of irradiated foods, there is not a widespread public demand for the irradiation of foods for human consumption.&lt;ref name="NYT_P.O." /&gt; Irradiated food does not become radioactive.

==Standards &amp; regulations==
The [[Codex Alimentarius]] represents the global standard for irradiation of food, in particular under the WTO-agreement. Regardless of treatment source, all processing facilities must adhere to safety standards set by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA), Codex Code of Practice for the Radiation Processing of Food, [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC), and the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Peter|date=December 2016|title=Food Irradiation: Standards, reguations, and world-wide trade|journal=Radiation Physics and Chemistry|volume=129|pages=30–34|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, ISO 14470 and ISO 9001 provide in-depth information regarding safety in irradiation facilities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

All commercial irradiation facilities contain safety systems are designed to prevent exposure of personnel to radiation. The radiation source is constantly shielded by water, concrete, or metal. Irradiation facilities are designed with overlapping layers of protection, interlocks, and safeguards to prevent accidental radiation exposure.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Additionally, "melt-downs" do not occur in facilities because the radiation source gives off radiation and decay heat; however, the heat is not sufficient to melt any material.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Labeling===
[[File:Radura-Symbol.svg|thumb|150px|right|The Radura symbol, as required by U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations to show a food has been treated with ionizing radiation.]]
The provisions of the [[Codex Alimentarius]] are that any "first generation" product must be labeled "irradiated" as any product derived directly from an irradiated raw material; for ingredients the provision is that even the last molecule of an irradiated ingredient must be listed with the ingredients even in cases where the unirradiated ingredient does not appear on the label. The RADURA-logo is optional; several countries use a graphical version that differs from the Codex-version. The suggested rules for labeling is published at CODEX-STAN&amp;nbsp;– 1 (2005),&lt;ref name="CX-label"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codexalimentarius.net/download/standards/32/CXS_001e.pdf |title=''GENERAL STANDARD FOR THE LABELLING OF PREPACKAGED FOODS''. CODEX STAN 1-1985. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and includes the usage of the [[Radura]] symbol for all products that contain irradiated foods. The Radura symbol is not a designator of quality. The amount of pathogens remaining is based upon dose and the original content and the dose applied can vary on a product by product basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=179&amp;showFR=1 |title=CFR - Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 |publisher=Accessdata.fda.gov |date= |accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union follows the Codex's provision to label irradiated ingredients down to the last molecule of irradiated food. The European Community does not provide for the use of the Radura logo and relies exclusively on labeling by the appropriate phrases in the respective languages of the Member States. The European Union enforces its irradiation labeling laws by requiring its member countries to perform tests on a cross section of food items in the market-place and to report to the European Commission. The results are published annually in the OJ of the European Communities.&lt;ref name="FDA"&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/biosafety/irradiation/scientific_advices_reports_en.htm
 Expand "Food Irradiation Reports" and select respective annual report and language&lt;/ref&gt;

The US defines irradiated foods as foods in which the irradiation causes a material change in the food, or a material change in the consequences that may result from the use of the food. Therefore, food that is processed as an ingredient by a restaurant or food processor is exempt from the labeling requirement in the US. All irradiated foods must include a prominent Radura symbol followed in addition to the statement "treated with irradiation" or "treated by irradiation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Bulk foods must be individually labeled with the symbol and statement or, alternatively, the Radura and statement should be located next to the sale container.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Packaging ===
Under section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, irradiation of prepackaged foods requires premarket approval for not only the irradiation source for a specific food but also for the food packaging material. Approved packaging materials include various plastic films, yet does not cover a variety of polymers and adhesive based materials that have been found to meet specific standards. The lack of packaging material approval limits manufacturers production and expansion of irradiated prepackaged foods.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Food Processing Technology: Principles and Practices.|last=Fellows|first=P.J.|publisher=Elsevier|year=2018|isbn=9780081019078|location=|pages=279–280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food safety===
In 2003, the [[Codex Alimentarius]] removed any upper dose limit for food irradiation as well as clearances for specific foods, declaring that all are safe to irradiate. Countries such as Pakistan and Brazil have adopted the Codex without any reservation or restriction.

Standards that describe calibration and operation for radiation dosimetry, as well as procedures to relate the measured dose to the effects achieved and to report and document such results, are maintained by the [[American Society for Testing and Materials]] (ASTM international) and are also available as ISO/ASTM standards.&lt;ref&gt;(see Annual Book of ASTM Standards, vol. 12.02, West Conshohocken, PA, US)&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the rules involved in processing food are applied to all foods before they are irradiated.

====United States====
The [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) is the agency responsible for regulation of radiation sources in the United States.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Irradiation, as defined by the FDA is a "[[food additive]]" as opposed to a food process and therefore falls under the food additive regulations. Each food approved for irradiation has specific guidelines in terms of minimum and maximum dosage as determined safe by the FDA.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Packaging materials containing the food processed by irradiation must also undergo approval. The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) amends these rules for use with meat, poultry, and fresh fruit.&lt;ref&gt;USDA/FSIS and USDA/APHIS, various final rules on pork, poultry and fresh fruits: Fed.Reg. 51:1769–1771 (1986); 54:387-393 (1989); 57:43588-43600 (1992); and others more&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) has approved the use of low-level irradiation as an alternative treatment to pesticides for fruits and vegetables that are considered hosts to a number of insect pests, including fruit flies and seed weevils. Under bilateral agreements that allows less-developed countries to earn income through food exports agreements are made to allow them to irradiate fruits and vegetables at low doses to kill insects, so that the food can avoid quarantine.

====European Union====
European law dictates that all member countries must allow the sale of irradiated dried aromatic herbs, spices and vegetable seasonings.&lt;ref name="EUregulation"&gt;EU: Food Irradiation&amp;nbsp;– Community Legislation http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/biosafety/irradiation/comm_legisl_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt; However, these Directives allow Member States to maintain previous clearances food categories the EC's Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) had previously approved (the approval body is now the European Food Safety Authority). Presently, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, and the United Kingdom allow the sale of many different types of irradiated foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2009:283:0005:0005:EN:PDF |title=Official Journal of the European Communities. 24 November, 2009. ''List of Member States' authorisations of food and food ingredients which may be treated with ionizing radiation.'' |date= |accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before individual items in an approved class can be added to the approved list, studies into the toxicology of each of such food and for each of the proposed dose ranges are requested. It also states that irradiation shall not be used "as a substitute for hygiene or health practices or good manufacturing or agricultural practice". These Directives only control food irradiation for food retail and their conditions and controls are not applicable to the irradiation of food for patients requiring sterile diets.

Because of the [[Single Market]] of the EC any food, even if irradiated, must be allowed to be marketed in any other Member State even if a general ban of food irradiation prevails, under the condition that the food has been irradiated legally in the state of origin.
Furthermore, imports into the EC are possible from third countries if the irradiation facility had been inspected and approved by the EC and the treatment is legal within the EC or some Member state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2002:287:0040:0041:EN:PDF |title=Official Journal of the European Communities. 23 October 2002.

====Australia====
Australia banned irradiated cat food after a national scare where cats suffered from paralyzation after eating a specific brand of highly irradiated catfood for an extended period of time. The suspected culprit was malnutrition from consuming food depleted of Vitamin A by the irradiation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/catfood-irradiation-banned-as-pet-theory-proved-20090529-bq8h.html | title=Cat-food irradiation banned as pet theory proved| date=2009-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kb.rspca.org.au/What-is-RSPCA-Australias-position-on-the-irradiation-of-imported-pet-food-products_307.html | title=RSPCA Australia knowledgebase}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was linked only to a single batch of one brand's product and no illness was linked to any of that brand's other irradiated batches of the same product or to any other brand of irradiated cat food.

===Nuclear safety and security===
Interlocks and safeguards are mandated to minimize this risk. There have been radiation-related accidents, deaths, and injury at such facilities, many of them caused by operators overriding the safety related interlocks.&lt;ref name="Soreq"&gt;[[International Atomic Energy Agency]]. [http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub925_web.pdf ''The Radiological Accident in Soreq'']&lt;/ref&gt; In a radiation processing facility, radiation specific concerns are supervised by special authorities, while "Ordinary" occupational safety regulations are handled much like other businesses.

The safety of irradiation facilities is regulated by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency|United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency]] and monitored by the different national Nuclear Regulatory Commissions. The regulators enforce a safety culture that mandates that all incidents that occur are documented and thoroughly analyzed to determine the cause and improvement potential. Such incidents are studied by personnel at multiple facilities, and improvements are mandated to retrofit existing facilities and future design.

In the US the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) regulates the safety of the processing facility, and the [[United States Department of Transportation]] (DOT) regulates the safe transport of the radioactive sources.

==Irradiated food supply==
As of 2010, the quantities of foods irradiated in Asia, the EU and the US were 285,200, 9,300, and 103,000 tons.&lt;ref name="Global food supply"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://foodirradiation.org/Setsuko.pdf |title=Food Irradiation in Asia, the European Union, and the United States |publisher=Japan Radioisotope Association |date=May 2013 |accessdate=January 6, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209043611/http://foodirradiation.org/Setsuko.pdf |archivedate=February 9, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities in some countries use tests that can detect the irradiation of food items to enforce labeling standards and to bolster consumer confidence.&lt;ref&gt;McMurray, C.H., Gray, R., Stewart, E.M., Pearce, J., Detection methods for irradiated foods, Royal Society of Chemistry; Cambridge (GB); 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raffi, J., Delincée, H., Marchioni, E., Hasselmann, C., Sjöberg, A.-M., Leonardi, M., Kent, M., Bögl, K.-W., Schreiber, G., Stevenson, H., Meier, W., Concerted action of the community bureau of reference on methods of identification of irradiated foods; bcr information; European Commission; Luxembourg; 1994, 119 p.; EUR--15261&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codexalimentarius.net/download/standards/377/CXS_231e.pdf |title=General Codex Methods for the Detection of Irradiated Foods, CODEX STAN 231-2001, Rev.1 2003 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Union monitors the market to determine the quantity of irradiated foods, if irradiated foods are labeled as irradiated, and if the irradiation is performed at approved facilities.

Irradiation of fruits and vegetables to prevent the spread of pest and diseases across borders has been increasing globally. In 2010, 18,446 tonnes of fruits and vegetables were irradiated in six countries for export quarantine control. 97% of this was exported to the United States.&lt;ref name="Global food supply"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://foodirradiation.org/Setsuko.pdf |title=Food Irradiation in Asia, the European Union, and the United States |publisher=Japan Radioisotope Association |date=May 2013 |accessdate=January 6, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209043611/http://foodirradiation.org/Setsuko.pdf |archivedate=February 9, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In total, 103 000 tonnes of food products were irradiated on mainland United States in 2010. The three types of foods irradiated the most were spices (77.7%), fruits and vegetables (14.6%) and meat and poultry (7.77%). 17 953 tonnes of irradiated fruits and vegetables were exported to the mainland United States.&lt;ref name="Global food supply"/&gt; Mexico, the United States' state of Hawaii, Thailand, Vietnam and India export irradiated produce to the mainland U.S.&lt;ref name="Global food supply"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/plant_health/content/printable_version/ifruit08.pdf |title=APHIS Factsheet |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture • Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service |date=December 2008 |accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/import_export/plants/plant_imports/irradiation/downloads/InstructionsDomestic.pdf |title=Guidance for importing mangoes into the United States from Pakistan |publisher= |date= |accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico, followed by the United States' state of Hawaii, is the largest exporter of irradiated produce to the mainland U.S.&lt;ref name="Global food supply"/&gt;

In total, 6 876 tonnes of food products were irradiated in European Union countries in 2013; mainly in four member state countries: Belgium (49.4%), the Netherlands (24.4%), Spain (12.7%) and France (10.0%). The two types of foods irradiated the most were frog legs (46%), and dried herbs and spices (25%). There has been a decrease of 14% in the total quantity of products irradiated in the EU compared to the previous year 2012 (7 972 tonnes).&lt;ref name="EU food supply"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2015/EN/1-2015-69-EN-F1-1.PDF |title=Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on Food and Food Ingredients Treated with Ionising Radiation FOR THE YEAR 2013 |publisher=European Commission |date=February 25, 2015 |accessdate=July 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Formal sciences''' are [[formal language]] disciplines concerned with [[formal system]]s, such as [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[statistics]], [[theoretical computer science]], [[robotics]], [[information theory]], [[game theory]], [[systems theory]], [[decision theory]], and [[theoretical linguistics]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}   Strictly speaking, formal science is not science{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} but a variety of fundamentally abstract logical systems that are applied to both the natural world and human constructs.  Whereas the [[natural science]]s and [[social science]]s seek to characterize [[physical systems]] and [[social system]]s, respectively, using empirical methods, the formal sciences are language [[tools]] concerned with characterizing abstract structures described by [[sign systems]]. The formal sciences aid the natural and social sciences by providing information about the structures the latter use to describe the world, and what inferences may be made about them.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==History==
Formal sciences began before the formulation of the [[scientific method]], with the most ancient [[Mathematics|mathematical]] texts dating back to 1800&amp;nbsp;BC ([[Babylonian mathematics]]), 1600&amp;nbsp;BC ([[Egyptian mathematics]]) and 1000&amp;nbsp;BC ([[Indian mathematics]]). From then on different cultures such as the Indian, [[Greek mathematics|Greek]], [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Arab and Persian]] made major contributions to mathematics, while the [[Chinese mathematics|Chinese]] and [[Japanese mathematics|Japanese]], independently of more distant cultures, developed their own mathematical tradition.

Besides mathematics, [[logic]] is another example of one of oldest subjects in the field of the formal sciences. As an explicit analysis of the methods of reasoning, logic received sustained development originally in three places: [[Indian logic|India]] from the {{nowrap|6th century BC}}, [[Logic in China|China]] in the {{nowrap|5th century BC}}, and Greece between the {{nowrap|4th century BC}} and the {{nowrap|1st century BC}}. The formally sophisticated treatment of modern logic descends from the Greek tradition, being informed from the transmission of [[Aristotelian logic]], which was then further developed by [[logic in Islamic philosophy|Islamic logicians]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}. The Indian tradition also continued into the [[early modern period]]. The native Chinese tradition did not survive beyond [[Ancient history|antiquity]], though Indian logic was later adopted in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] China.

As a number of other disciplines of formal science rely heavily on mathematics, they did not exist until mathematics had developed into a relatively advanced level. [[Pierre de Fermat]] and [[Blaise Pascal]] (1654), and [[Christiaan Huygens]] (1657) started the earliest study of [[probability theory]]. In the early 1800s, [[Gauss]] and [[Laplace]] developed the mathematical theory of [[statistics]], which also explained the use of statistics in insurance and governmental accounting. Mathematical statistics was recognized as a mathematical discipline in the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century.

In the mid-20th century, mathematics was broadened and enriched by the rise of new [[mathematical science]]s and engineering disciplines such as [[operations research]] and [[systems engineering]]. These sciences benefited from basic research in [[electrical engineering]] and then by the development of [[Computer|electrical computing]], which also stimulated [[information theory]], [[numerical analysis]] ([[scientific computing]]), and [[theoretical computer science]]. Theoretical computer science also benefits from the discipline of [[mathematical logic]], which included the [[theory of computation]].

==Differences from other forms of science==
{{quote|One reason why mathematics enjoys special esteem, above all other sciences, is that its laws are absolutely certain and indisputable, while those of other sciences are to some extent debatable and in constant danger of being overthrown by newly discovered facts.|[[Albert Einstein]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Albert Einstein |authorlink=Albert Einstein |title=Sidelights on relativity |chapter=Geometry and Experience |page=27 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1923}} Reprinted by Dover (2010), {{ISBN|978-0-486-24511-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As opposed to empirical sciences (natural and social), the formal sciences do not involve empirical procedures. They also do not presuppose knowledge of contingent facts, or describe the real world. In this sense, formal sciences are both logically and methodologically [[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]], for their content and validity are independent of any empirical procedures.  

Therefore, straightly speaking, formal science is not a science.  It is a formal logical system with its content targeted at the real things, information and thoughts that we experienced.  As [[Francis Bacon]] pointed out in the 17th century, experimental verification of the propositions must be carried out rigorously and cannot take logic itself as the way to draw conclusions in nature.  Formal science is a method that is helpful to science but cannot replace science.

Although formal sciences are conceptual systems, lacking empirical content, this does not mean that they have no relation to the real world. But this relation is such that their formal statements hold in all possible conceivable worlds – whereas, statements based on empirical theories, such as, say, [[general relativity]] or [[evolutionary biology]], do not hold in all possible worlds, and may eventually turn out not to hold in this world as well. That is why formal sciences are applicable in all domains and useful in all empirical sciences.

Because of their non-empirical nature, formal sciences are construed by outlining a set of [[axioms]] and [[definitions]] from which other statements ([[theorems]]) are deduced. In other words, theories in formal sciences contain no [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic statements]]; all their statements are [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia

Photographically, it appears as a bright blob close to [[spiral galaxy]] [[IC 2497]] in the constellation [[Leo Minor]].

==Description==
Hanny's Voorwerp (HsV) is about the size of a small galaxy and has a central hole over 16,000 [[light year]]s across. In an image taken with the [[Hubble Space telescope|HST]], HsV is colored green, a standard [[false color]] that is used to represent the presence of several luminous [[emission line]]s of glowing [[oxygen]]. HsV has been shown to be at the same distance from [[Earth]] as the adjacent galaxy IC 2497, which is about 650 million light-years away. 
 
[[Stellar Evolution|Star birth]] is occurring in the region of HsV that faces IC 2497. Radio observations indicate that this is due to an outflow of gas arising from the IC 2497's core which is interacting with a small region of HsV to collapse and form stars.  The youngest of these stars are several million years old.&lt;ref name="Hubble1"&gt;{{cite web| title=Hubble Zooms in on a Space Oddity | url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1102| publisher=[[European Southern Observatory]]| access-date=11 January 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 40-page comic and associated promotional offers about HsV and the story surrounding it were presented at the 24th [[Dragon Con]] in [[Atlanta]] on 3 September 2010, as well as first pictures of HsV from the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].&lt;ref name=DR_CON&gt;{{cite web| title=Dragon Con 2010 Pocket Program Guide| url=https://issuu.com/dragoncon/docs/dragoncon-pocket_program-full_book-web| publisher=[[Dragon Con]]| page=52| date=3 September 2010| access-date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HaVo_Home&gt;{{cite web| title=Hanny and the Mystery of the Voorwerp| url=http://hannysvoorwerp.zooniverse.org| publisher=[[Zooniverse]]| date=September 2010| access-date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ha_CAV&gt;{{cite web| title=The Comic about The Voorwerp!| url=http://www.hannysvoorwerp.com/2010/08/the-comic-about-the-voorwerp| publisher=Hanny van Arkel| date=20 August 2010| access-date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch was streamed live on UStream.&lt;ref name=Ha_CAV/&gt;

==Hypotheses==
[[File:Hs-2011-01-d-print.jpg|thumb|[[Hubble Space Telescope|HST]] zooms in on a space oddity|350px]]
One [[hypothesis]] suggests that HsV consists of remnants of a small galaxy showing the impact of radiation from a bright [[quasar]] event that occurred in the center of IC 2497 about 100,000 years before how it is observed today.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news

 |accessdate=30 June 2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quasar event is thought to have stimulated the bright emission that characterizes HsV. The quasar might have switched off in the last 200,000 years and is not visible in the available images.&lt;ref name="Hubble1"/&gt; This might well be due to a process known as AGN feedback.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

 |doi=10.1146/annurev-astro-081811-125521
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One possible explanation for the missing light-source is that illumination from the assumed quasar was a [[Transient astronomical event|transient phenomenon]]. In this case, its effects on HsV would be still visible because of the distance of several tens of thousands of [[light year]]s between HsV and the [[quasar]] in the nearby galaxy: HsV would show a "[[light echo]]" or "ghost image" of events that are older than those currently seen in the galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 June 2010, a group of researchers at the [[European VLBI Network]] (EVN) and the UK’s [[Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network]] (MERLIN), proposed another related explanation. They hypothesized that the light comes from two sources: (1) a [[supermassive black hole]] at the center of IC 2497, and (2) light produced by an interaction of an [[astrophysical jet|energetic jet]] from the black hole and the gas surrounding IC 2497.&lt;ref&gt;

This search yielded a list of 19 galaxies with AGN-photoionized clouds detected to beyond 10 [[kiloparsec]]s from the nuclei.&lt;ref name=voorwerpjes /&gt;  These were nicknamed 'Voorwerpjes' from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for 'small objects'.

==Extended X-ray emission in IC 2497==

In April 2016, a study was published in the ''[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]'' using data gathered by the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] in January 2012.&lt;ref name=HV_Chandra1&gt;{{cite journal| title=Extended X-ray emission in the IC 2497 - Hanny's Voorwerp system: energy injection in the gas around a fading AGN| author1=L.F.

The authors hypothesize that this could be due to the bubble being inflated by the AGN, or by a past luminous quasar.

'''Hyper Articles en Ligne''', generally shortened to '''HAL''', is an open archive where [[author]]s can deposit scholarly documents from all [[academia|academic]] fields. It has a good position in the international web repository ranking.&lt;ref&gt;http://repositories.webometrics.info/en/world&lt;/ref&gt;

HAL is run by the ''Centre pour la communication scientifique directe'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccsd.cnrs.fr CCSD]&lt;/ref&gt; a [[France|French]] computing centre, which is part of the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]], CNRS. Other French institutions, such as [[INRIA]], have joined the system. While it is primarily directed towards French academics, participation is not restricted to them.

Documents in HAL are uploaded either by one of the authors with the consent of the others or by an authorized person on their behalf. Since 2017 it's also possible to use [[Dissem.in]], a tool for easy and semi-automated deposit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2017-08-28|title=Easy depositing tool Dissemin incorporated in HAL  : OpenAIRE blog|url=https://blogs.openaire.eu/?p=2105|website=blogs.openaire.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HAL is a tool for direct scientific communication between academics. A text posted to HAL is normally comparable to that of a paper that an investigator might submit for publication in a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]] or conference proceedings. A document deposited in HAL will not be subjected to any detailed scientific evaluation, but simply a rapid overview, to ensure that it falls within the category defined above.

An uploaded document does not need to have been published or even to be intended for publication: It may be posted to HAL as long as its scientific content justifies it. But should the article be published, contributors are invited to indicate the relevant bibliographic information and the [[digital object identifier]] (DOI).

HAL aims to ensure the long term preservation of the deposited documents that are stored there permanently and will receive a stable web address. Thus, like any publication in a traditional scientific journal, it can be cited in other work.

The free online access to these documents provided by HAL is intended to promote the best possible dissemination of research work; the intellectual property remains that of the authors.

For physics, mathematics and other natural science topics, HAL has an automated depositing agreement with [[arXiv]]. A similar agreement exists with [[PubMed Central]] for biomedical topics.

Over 120 institutions have their own entrance to HAL, called portals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Portails institutionnels |url=https://www.ccsd.cnrs.fr/portails-institutionnels/ |website=CCSD |accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  HAL hosts institutional repositories (for universities, research organisms and units) as well as subject repositories&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Liste des portails |url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/browse/portal |website=HAL |accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ; one example is the Arts and Humanities eprint repository, [[hprints]].

As an [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] repository, HAL complies with the ''[[Open Archives Initiative]]'' (OAI-PMH) as well as with the European [[Framework_Programmes_for_Research_and_Technological_Development#OpenAIRE|OpenAIRE]] project.

{{Quote|a collaboration between scholarly publishers, researchers, and other interested parties to promote the unrestricted availability of scholarly citation data and to make these data available.|sign=|source=}}

It is intended to facilitate improved [[citation analysis]].

== Methodology ==

The citations are stored in [[Crossref]] and are made available through the Crossref [[REST API]]. They are also available from the OpenCitations Corpus, a database that harvests citation data from Crossref and other sources.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://i4oc.org/#faqs|title=FAQ|publisher=Initiative for Open Citations|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data are considered by the those involved in the Initiative to be in the [[public domain]], and so a [[CC0]] licence is used.&lt;ref name="Chawla" /&gt;

The stated benefits of this approach are:&lt;ref name="FAQ" /&gt;

* discoverability of published content
* the building of new services 
* creation of a public citation graph to explore connections between knowledge fields.

== Launch ==

The initiative was established in response to a paper on [[citation]]s in [[Wikidata]], ''Citations needed for the sum of all human knowledge: Wikidata as the missing link between scholarly publishing and [[linked open data]]'', given by Dario Taraborelli, head of research at the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], at the eighth Conference on Open Access Scholarly Publishing, in September 2016.&lt;ref name="Chawla" /&gt; At that time, only 1% of papers in [[Crossref]] had citations metadata that were freely available. By the time of the public launch, on 6 April 2017, that had risen to 40% as a result of setting up the initiative.&lt;ref name="Molteni" /&gt;

The founding partners were:&lt;ref name="Press"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://i4oc.org/press.html|title=Press|date=6 April 2017|publisher=Initiative for Open Citations|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[OpenCitations]]
* [[Wikimedia Foundation]]
* [[PLOS]]
* [[eLife]]
* [[DataCite]]
* [[The Centre for Culture and Technology (CCAT)|The Centre for Culture and Technology]] at [[Curtin University]]

At the time of launch, 64 organisations, including the [[Wellcome Trust]], the [[Bill And Melinda Gates Foundation]] and the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]],&lt;ref name="Chawla" /&gt; had endorsed the project and as of May, 2017, Sloan Foundation confirmed it would be providing funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://opencitations.wordpress.com/2017/05/15/the-sloan-foundation-funds-opencitations/|title=The Sloan Foundation funds OpenCitations|last=Shotton|first=David|date=2017-05-15|website=OpenCitations|access-date=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 29 of these organisations were publishers who had agreed to share their citation metadata [[open content|openly]].&lt;ref name="Treanor" /&gt; These include [[Springer Nature]], [[Taylor &amp; Francis]], and [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]].&lt;ref name="Molteni" /&gt; A notable exception was [[Elsevier]], who contribute 30% of the citation metadata in Crossref.&lt;ref name="Molteni" /&gt; Elsevier's vice-president of corporate relations, Tom Reller, said:&lt;ref name="Schiermeier2017" /&gt;

{{Quote|We are aware of the initiative but want to learn more before making a decision on whether to participate.}}

On 11 July 2017, the Initiative announced that a further sixteen publishers had signed up.&lt;ref name="IOC-2017-07-11"&gt;{{cite web|title=Availability of open reference data nears 50% as major societies and influential publishers endorse the Initiative for Open Citations|url=https://i4oc.org/press.html#July2017|publisher=: Initiative for Open Citations|accessdate=11 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 August 2017, the Initiative released on open letter to stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://i4oc.org/news.html#August2017|title=I4OC: Initiative for Open Citations - Press|last=I4OC|website=i4oc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, the [[British Library]] became a member organisation.&lt;ref name="BL"&gt;{{cite web|title=I4OC: The British Library and open data - Science blog|url=http://blogs.bl.uk/science/2017/08/i4oc-the-british-library-and-open-data.html|publisher=[[British Library ]]|accessdate=30 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jay Clark Buckey, Jr.''' (born June 6, 1956, in [[New York City]]) is an American [[physician]] and [[astronaut]] who flew aboard one [[space shuttle]] mission ([[STS-90]]) as a [[Payload Specialist]]. Buckey briefly ran for the Democratic nomination to challenge New Hampshire Senator [[John E. Sununu]], a first term Republican, when he was up for re-election in 2008. Buckey withdrew from the race when former Governor [[Jeanne Shaheen]] entered the race.

==Education==
Buckey holds a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[Electrical Engineering]] from [[Cornell University]] (1977) and an M.D. from Cornell in 1981, interning at [[New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center]] and completing his residence at [[Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center]].  Currently, Buckey is a [[Professor]] of Medicine at the [[Dartmouth Medical School]]. He was also a [[flight surgeon]] with the [[U.S. Air Force Reserve]] for 8 years.

==Spaceflight experience==
[[Image:Jay Buckey.jpg|thumb|Astronaut Buckey]]In 1998 he was a [[Payload Specialist]] aboard NASA [[Space Shuttle]] flight [[STS-90]] as part of the [[Neurolab]] mission from April 17 to May 3, 1998. Aboard the Neurolab Mission, Buckey was the [[Payload Specialist]] for the experiment "[[Cardiovascular Adaptation to Zero-Gravity]]" and assisted with other Spacelab Life Sciences experiments. During the 16-day Spacelab flight, the seven person crew aboard Space Shuttle Columbia served as both experiment subjects and operators for 26 individual life science experiments focusing on the effects of [[microgravity]] on the [[brain]] and [[nervous system]]. The STS-90 flight orbited the Earth 256 times, covered 6.3 million miles, and logged him over 381 hours in space.

==Politics==
{{Main|New Hampshire United States Senate election, 2008}}

==Research==

In 2018, Buckey was part of research using [[virtual reality]], at the [[Australian Antarctic Division]]’s [[Mawson Station]], wherein the expeditioners used VR headsets to view Australian beach scenes, European nature scenes, and North American nature scenes of forests and urban environments, which were different from the isolation of the whiteness and silence of Antarctica. The research will inform psychological techniques to support long duration spaceflight such as for astronauts going to Mars.&lt;ref name=”2018-10-10_ABC”&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-10-10/virtual-reality-on-icy-continent-helping-astronauts/10356956  Virtual reality beaches in Antarctica beating isolation and helping future astronauts], Carla Howarth, [[ABC News Online]], 2018-10-10&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4611">'''Knowledge acquisition''' is the process used to define the rules and ontologies required for a [[knowledge-based system]]. The phrase was first used in conjunction with [[expert systems]] to describe the initial tasks associated with developing an expert system, namely finding and interviewing [[knowledge domain|domain]] experts and capturing their knowledge via [[Rule-based system|rules]], [[Object-oriented programming|objects]], and [[Frame language|frame-based]] [[Ontologies (computer science)|ontologies]]. 

Expert systems were one of the first successful applications of [[artificial intelligence]] technology to real world business problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Stuart|last2=Norvig|first2=Peter|title=Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach|date=1995|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=0-13-103805-2|pages=22–23|url=http://stpk.cs.rtu.lv/sites/all/files/stpk/materiali/MI/Artificial%20Intelligence%20A%20Modern%20Approach.pdf|accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at [[Stanford university|Stanford]] and other AI laboratories worked with doctors and other highly skilled experts to develop systems that could automate complex tasks such as [[medical diagnosis]]. Until this point computers had mostly been used to automate highly data intensive tasks but not for complex reasoning. Technologies such as [[Inference engine|inference engines]] allowed developers for the first time to tackle more complex problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

| location = [[Reading, MA]] | isbn = 978-0-201-11519-2 | oclc = 9324691}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As expert systems scaled up from demonstration prototypes to industrial strength applications it was soon realized that the acquisition of domain expert knowledge was one of if not the most critical task in the [[knowledge engineering]] process. This knowledge acquisition process became an intense area of research on its own. One of the earlier works&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
| last = Brule | first = J.F. | last2 = Blount | first2 = A.F.
| title = Knowledge Acquisition | year = 1989 | publisher = McGraw Hill
| location = NY | isbn = 978-0-07-008600-5 | oclc = 21367222}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the topic used Batesonian theories of learning to guide the process.

One approach to knowledge acquisition investigated was to use [[natural language parsing]] and generation to facilitate knowledge acquisition. Natural language parsing could be performed on manuals and other expert documents and an initial first pass at the rules and objects could be developed automatically. Text generation was also extremely useful in generating explanations for system behavior. This greatly facilitated the development and maintenance of expert systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Potter|first1=Steven|title=A Survey of Knowledge Acquisition from Natural Language|journal=Technology Maturity Assessment (TMA)|url=http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/project/akt/work/stephenp/TMA%20of%20KAfromNL.pdf|accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent approach to knowledge acquisition is a re-use based approach. Knowledge can be developed in [[Ontology_(information_science)|ontologies]] that conform to standards such as the [[Web_Ontology_Language|Web Ontology Language (OWL)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schreiber|first1=Guus|title=Knowledge acquisition and the web|journal=International Journal of Human-Computer Studies|date=25 September 2012|issue=71|pages=206–210|url=http://www.cs.vu.nl/~guus/papers/Schreiber13a.pdf|accessdate=5 March 2017|publisher=Elsevior}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way knowledge can be standardized and shared across a broad community of knowledge workers. One example domain where this approach has been successful is [[bioinformatics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goble|first1=Carole|title=State of the nation in data integration for bioinformatics|journal=Journal of Biomedical Informatics|date=2008|volume=41|issue=5|pages=687693|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046408000178|accessdate=5 March 2017|doi=10.1016/j.jbi.2008.01.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''LRGB''', short for [[Luminance]], [[Red]], [[Green]] and [[Blue]], is a photographic technique used in [[amateur astronomy]] for producing good quality color photographs by combining a high-quality [[black-and-white photography|black-and-white image]] with a lower-quality color image.&lt;ref name="nightsky"&gt;[http://www.employees.org/~jmulchin/lrgb.html A Simple Guide to the LRGB Technique] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122184515/http://www.employees.org/~jmulchin/lrgb.html |date=January 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In amateur [[astronomy]], it is easier and cheaper to obtain good quality, high [[signal-to-noise ratio]] images in black and white. The LRGB method is used to work around this to get good color images. The color information from the color image is combined with the overall brightness from the black-and-white image.

The theory behind the effectiveness behind LRGB techniques has been related to the way humans see color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://starizona.com/acb/ccd/advimcolor.aspx|title=LRGB|last=|first=|date=|website=Starizona|publisher=Starizona|access-date=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rods in human eyes are sensitive to luminance and spatial data, while the cones are sensitive to color. There are three types of cones: those sensitive to red, those sensitive to green, and those sensitive to blue. Thus, each element of LRGB targets one type of [[photoreceptor cell]] in the human eye.

The '''Langer correction''' is a correction when the [[WKB approximation]] method is applied to three-dimensional problems with spherical symmetry.

When applying WKB approximation method to the radial [[Schrödinger equation]]
:&lt;math&gt; -\frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \frac{d^2 R(r)}{dr^2} + [E-V_\textrm{eff}(r)] R(r) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
where the effective potential is given by
:&lt;math&gt;V_\textrm{eff}(r)=V(r)-\frac{\ell(\ell+1)\hbar^2}{2mr^2}&lt;/math&gt;
the eigenenergies and the wave function behaviour obtained are different from the real solution.

In 1937, [[Rudolf Ernest Langer|Rudolph E. Langer]] suggested a correction

:&lt;math&gt;\ell(\ell+1) \rightarrow \left(\ell+\frac{1}{2}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;
which is known as Langer correction or '''Langer replacement'''.&lt;ref&gt;R.E. Langer, Phys. Rev. 51 (1937) 669.&lt;/ref&gt; This is equivalent to inserting a 1/4 constant factor whenever ℓ(ℓ&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) appears. Heuristically, it is said that this factor arises because the range of the radial Schrödinger equation is restricted from 0 to infinity, as opposed to the entire real line.

By such a changing of constant term in the effective potential, the results obtained by [[WKB approximation]] reproduces the exact spectrum for many potentials.

That the Langer replacement is correct follows from the WKB calculation of the Coulomb eigenvalues with this replacement which reproduces the well known result.&lt;ref&gt;Harald J. W. Müller-Kirsten, Introduction to Quantum Mechanics: Schrödinger Equation and Path Integral, 2nd ed. World Scientific (Singapore, 2012), p. 404.&lt;/ref&gt;  An even more convincing calculation is the derivation of [[Regge trajectories]] (and hence eigenvalues) of the radial Schrödinger equation with [[Yukawa potential]] by both a perturbation method (with the old &lt;math&gt; l(l+1)&lt;/math&gt; factor) and independently the derivation by the WKB method (with Langer replacement)-- in both cases even to higher orders. For the perturbation calculation see Müller-Kirsten&lt;ref&gt;Harald J.W. Müller-Kirsten, Introduction to Quantum Mechanics: Schrödinger Equation and Path Integral, 2nd ed., World Scientific (Singapore, 2012), Chapter 16.&lt;/ref&gt; and for the WKB calculation Boukema.&lt;ref&gt;J.I. Boukema, Physica 30 (1965) 1320, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt;

==2D systems==
Note that for 2D systems, as the potential takes the form:
:&lt;math&gt;V_\textrm{eff}(r)=V(r)-\frac{(\ell-\frac{1}{4})^2\hbar^2}{2mr^2}&lt;/math&gt;
Langer correction goes:&lt;ref&gt;M. Brack, R.K, Bhaduri, Semiclassical Physics, 1st ed. Adison-Wesley Publishing Company Inc. (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(\ell^2-\frac{1}{4}) \rightarrow \ell^2&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20894">In [[persuasion|persuasive]] communication, the order of the information's presentation influences opinion formation.  The '''law of primacy in persuasion''', otherwise known as a primacy effect, as postulated by [[Frederick Hansen Lund]] in 1925 holds that the side of an issue presented first will have greater effectiveness in persuasion than the side presented subsequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stone, Vernon A.|year=1969|title=A Primacy Effect in Decision-Making by Jurors|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=19|issue=3|pp=239–247|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1969.tb00846.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lund presented college students with a document in support of one side of a controversial issue and then presented a second document which supported the opposite position. He found the document read first had greater influence, regardless of which position it expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ciadvertising.org/student_account/fall_01/adv382j/mgautam/minx_paper/primacy.html | work= ADV 382J: Fall 2001, "Theories of Persuasive Communication &amp; Consumer Decision Making"|title= Primacy-Recency |publisher = Center for Interactive Advertising, The [[University of Texas at Austin]] |accessdate=2007-11-04 | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This empirical evidence was generally accepted until 1950, when Cromwell published findings of the opposite: a '''recency effect''' in which arguments presented later had greater effectiveness in persuasion than arguments presented first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciadvertising.org/sa/spring_04/adv382j/christine/primacy.html |title= Order Effects Theory : Primacy versus Recency |publisher = Center for Interactive Advertising, The [[University of Texas at Austin]] |author = Kohler, Christine|accessdate=2007-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It now appears that both primacy and recency effects occur in persuasion.

==Theoretical background==

There are many different theoretical models proposed to explain the occurrence of primacy and recency effects.

=== Sensory-variation===
Schultz (1963) developed the "sensory-variation" hypothesis for order effects, which suggests that humans seek high activation and will respond to novel stimuli more strongly than to stimuli they are familiar with. Novel stimuli should provide higher activation than familiar information, according to this theory. Shultz developed four postulates from this general hypothesis: 
# When a person encounters a topic for the first time, the communication is perceived as novel and causes high activation. Any subsequent communication on the same topic produces less activation, and so the person will react according to the initial communication in an attempt to experience the higher activation. A primacy effect should be observed in this scenario.
# If the person is allowed to record his opinion after each communication, the person will respond more to the communication that he encounters either second in a group of two or last in a group of three or more  in order to maintain a high level of activation. Therefore, a recency effect is hypothesized. 
# When a time delay or another task is inserted between the two communications, the higher level of activation will be dissipated by the time the second communication occurs. The second communication acts as a novel stimulus in this scenario. Either a recency effect or no order effect will occur in this scenario. 
# When communications are familiar, such as social issues or current issues, the first communication will not produce activation that is less than the activation for unfamiliar communication. However, some aspect of the communication may be novel, and so there may be some increased activation. Therefore, either a small primacy effect or no  order effect will be demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schultz, D. P.|year=1963|title=Primacy-recency within a sensory variation framework|journal=The Psychological Record|volume=13|issue=2|pp=129–139|doi=10.1007/BF03393511}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attention decrement===

Anderson (1981) theorized that order effects occur due to "attention decrement". According to this theory,  when the first piece of information is presented about an opinion, people tend to pay less attention to subsequent information that may provide evidence to the contrary opinion. Therefore, people's opinions about something are influenced strongly by the information that they paid attention to, which was the first information presented to them. This model of "attention decrement" predicts a primacy effect in opinion formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anderson, N.H.|year=1981|title=Foundations of information integration theory|location=New York|publisher=Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The belief-adjustment model===
Hogarth and Einhorn (1992) proposed the belief-adjustment model to try to predict in which situations order effects would occur and what specific order effect will occur. According to Hogarth and Einhorn, early information forms an initial impression, which is called an anchor. This anchor is then adjusted as new information is processed. This model predicts order effects based on the type of mental processing that is used for the new information. For end-of-sequence processing, or processing that occurs once all of the information has been presented, the model predicts primacy effects. The initial piece of information serves as the anchor, and subsequent pieces of information are aggregated together to adjust the initial piece of information. Therefore, the initial piece of information is weighted more than subsequent pieces of information, leading to a primacy effect.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hogarth, R. M.|author2=Einhorn, H. J.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1992|title=Order effects in belief updating: The belief-adjustment model|journal=Cognitive Psychology|volume=24|issue=1|pp=1–55|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(92)90002-J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when processing changes to step-by-step processing, or processing that occurs after each new piece of information, recency effects are predicted. Each new piece of information received will be processed separately. This new piece of information will then become the new anchor, which forms a new impression. Beliefs are being adjusted with the processing of each new anchor, which leads to more weight being placed to the information most recently received. Therefore, recency effects are predicted to occur when information is processed in a step-by-step manner.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Factors that moderate order effects==

There are factors that can [[Moderation (statistics)|moderate]] the occurrence of order effects. Moderating factors affect the likelihood of order effects occurring.

===Need for cognition===

[[Need for cognition]] moderates the occurrence of order effects. Kassin, Reddy, and Tulloch (1990) demonstrated that a juror's need for cognition affects which order effect the juror relies on for their vote. An ambiguous confession was played by one side of the case, and then both sides commented that the confession fit into their narrative of the crime. The side who presented the confession spoke first. Jurors who had high need for cognition were more likely to exhibit a primacy effect, meaning that they believed the confession fit with whichever side presented the confession as evidence. Conversely, jurors who had low need for cognition demonstrated a recency effect, and believed that the confession supported the case for the side who did not submit the confession.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kassin, S. M.|author2=Reddy, M. E.|author3=Tulloch, W. F.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1990|title=Juror interpretations of ambiguous evidence: The need for cognition, presentation order, and persuasion|journal=Law and Human Behavior|volume=14|issue=1|pp=43–55|doi=10.1007/BF01055788|jstor=1393555|url=http://web.williams.edu/Psychology/Faculty/Kassin/files/Kassin_Reddy_Tulloch_1990.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kassin, Reddy, and Tulloch (1990) believed that the reason for this effect was due to the nature of processing that the jurors engaged in. Jurors who were high in need for cognition actively process the information. This active processing leads to agreeing with the initial presentation of the data, and then participating in processing that confirms this agreement. However, people low in need for cognition do not process information, and therefore, rely on the information presented most recently for their opinion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This impact of need for cognition is supported by a study conducted by Huagtvedt and Petty (1992). The experimenters played a message for two groups of people, one group that was high in need for cognition and one group that was low in need for cognition. The two groups were determined by their own need for cognition, and were not experimentally manipulated into the two groups. Initially, both groups were equally persuaded by the message. However, the two groups then listened to a weak counter-message, which was not as strong as the evidence for the initial message. The group that had high need for cognition were not persuaded by the weak counter-message, and their opinions were still in line with the initial message. The other group, the low need for cognition group, was persuaded by the new message. The high need for cognition demonstrated a primacy effect, while the low need for cognition demonstrated a recency effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Haugtvedt, C. P.|author2=Petty, R. E.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1992|title=Personality and persuasion: Need for cognition moderates the persistence and resistance of attitude changes|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=63|issue=2|p=308|url=http://psyc604.stasson.org/haugtvedt.pdf|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.63.2.308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chunking===
[[Chunking (psychology)|Chunking]] interacts with the order of information and need for cognition to moderate the occurrence of order effects. Petty, Tormala, Hawkins, and Wegener (2001) conducted a study which examined the effect chunking has on order effects in people with high and low need for cognition. Participants read arguments for and against an exam policy, and this information was presented as being either chunked or unchunked. When the information was chunked, those who show high need for cognition were prone to primacy effects, while those with low need for cognition were prone to recency effects. However, when the information was presented in an unchunked nature, the opposite results were found. People who had high need for cognition demonstrated recency effects, whereas people who had low need for cognition showed a primacy effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Petty, R. E.|author2=Tormala, Z. L.|author3=Hawkins, C.|author4=Wegener, D. T.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2001|title=Motivation to think and order effects in persuasion: The moderating role of chunking|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=27|issue=3|pp=332–344|doi=10.1177/0146167201273007|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247745085_Motivation_to_Think_and_Order_Effects_in_Persuasion_The_Moderating_Role_of_Chunking}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, chunking appears to interact with need for cognition to allow for order effects to occur.

===Familiarity of information===

A study conducted by Lana (1961) demonstrates a moderating effect of the familiarity of information presented on order effects. In the study, a topic of initial low familiarity was used. Then, the researchers presented a long talk to well familiarize one group with the topic and a short talk to another group to gain little familiarization with the topic. A third group was then presented with no familiarization talk. Each of these three groups was then split into two subgroups, which listened to arguments for and against the topic twelve days later. One subgroup would listen to the argument for the topic first and then the argument against the topic, and the second subgroup would listen to the argument against it first. These groups then filled out a [[Likert scale]] questionnaire on their opinions on the topic. The results show that prior familiarization with a topic increased the likelihood of a primacy effect. Therefore, those in the long familiarization group had an opinion on the topic that coincided with which argument they heard first, regardless of the actual stance. However, no prior familiarization led to a recency effect to be demonstrated. Therefore, the group that was given no familiarization talk demonstrated opinions that coincided with the argument presented last to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lana, R. E. |year=1961|title=Familiarity and the order of presentation of persuasive communications|journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|volume=62|issue=3|pp=573–577|doi=10.1037/h0046634|pmid=14461892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy of the topic===

A study conducted by Lana (1963) demonstrates that the controversiality of the topic can have a moderating effect on order effects. College students and high school students read arguments for and against a controversial topic and a noncontroversial topic, and were then asked to fill out an opinion questionnaire about the topics. For college students, the controversial topic exhibited a primacy effect. College students did not exhibit any order effects for a noncontroversial topic. The college students were persuaded more by the argument they encountered first for a controversial issue, but were not influenced by the order of the presentation of arguments for noncontroversial topics. However, for high school students, no order effects were exhibited for either the controversial or noncontroversial topics. Therefore, the controversy of a topic appears to affect the role order effects play for some age groups in persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lana, Robert E.|year=1963|title=Controversy of the topic and the order of presentation in persuasive communications|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=12|issue=1|pp=163–170|doi=10.2466/pr0.1963.12.1.163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Order effects in jury trials==

==Order effects in judgment formation==

===Sports===

Smith, Greenlees, and Manley (2009) found that order effects can occur in assessment of sports ability. The researchers had participants watch a video composed of an [[Ultimate (sport)|ultimate Frisbee]] player performing certain skills. Two videos were shown, either in descending ability or increasing ability. The participants were then asked to make assessments of the overall ability of the players and three aspects of their ability. However, the assessments occurred at differing times in the video. One group made the assessments at the end of the video, one group made delayed assessments at the end of the video, a third group made the assessments after each skill in the video, and a fourth group that made the overall assessment after each skill but then made the assessment of the ability after viewing the entire video. Results indicate that a primacy effect was exhibited in each of the conditions, except for the third group, which did not demonstrate any order effects. The assessment of ability tended to agree with the initial ability level shown. However, the group that made assessments in an extended step-by-step manner were not influenced by the order the abilities were shown. Therefore, a primacy effect can occur in ability assessment, unless extended step-by-step processing is employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smith, M. J.|author2=Greenlees, I.|author3=Manley, A.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2009|title=Influence of order effects and mode of judgement on assessments of ability in sport|journal=Journal of Sports Sciences|volume=27|issue=7|pp=745–752|doi=10.1080/02640410902939647|pmid=19437187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Service encounters===

In a study conducted by Garnefeld and Steinhoff (2013), order effects were demonstrated for opinions regarding service encounters. Four groups received daily descriptions of a hypothetical hotel stay over the course of five days. One group had a very positive experience on the first day, and then a neutral to slightly positive experience for the rest of the days. The second group had a negative experience on the first day, and then a neutral to slightly positive experience for the rest of the stay. Groups three and four experienced a neutral experience for the first four days, with group three then having a positive experience on the last day and group four having a negative experience on the last day. Each group was then tested for customer satisfaction regarding their hypothetical stay. Garnefeld and Steinhoff found that the timing of positive or negative occurrences is what affected satisfaction. For negative events, a recency effect was demonstrated, meaning that negative events which occurred at the end of the stay affected customer satisfaction more than negative events at the beginning of the stay. For positive events, a primacy effect was demonstrated, which means that positive events that occurred at the beginning of the stay affected customer satisfaction more than positive events at the end of the stay. Therefore, the timing of particular types of events in extended service encounters predicts the effect of the event on satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Garnefeld, I.|author2=Steinhoff, L.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2013|title=Primacy versus recency effects in extended service encounters|journal=Journal of Service Management|volume=24|issue=1|pp=64–81|doi=10.1108/09564231311304198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Order effects in health care==

Order effects may be used to influence a patient to receive an effective treatment that aligns with their values. One study, conducted by Bansback, Li, Lynd, and Bryan (2014), demonstrates that a primacy effect will influence the decision for treatment. The researchers presented three groups with information about sleep apnea treatments. The three groups were based on the order in which the information was presented. One group received information in an order unrelated to their values, while two groups received information ordered based on their values. One of the groups received information that aligned with their values first, and the other group received information that aligned with their values last. The researchers found that patients were more likely to choose the treatment that aligned with their values when this information was presented first, thus demonstrating a primacy effect for information on treatments that align with a patient's values. The order in which patients receive information appears to influence which treatment option they choose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bansback, N.|author2=Li L. C.|author3=Lynd, L.|author4=Bryan S.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2014|title=Exploiting order effects to improve  the quality of decisions|journal=Patient Education and Counseling|volume=96|issue=2|pp=197–203|doi=10.1016/j.pec.2014.05.021|pmid=24961445|url=http://www.pec-journal.com/article/S0738-3991(14)00226-2/fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Order effects in politics==
===Voter mobilization===

In a study conducted by Panagopoulos (2010), order effects were found in terms of voter mobilization. Calls were made to residents of an American city at different times before an election. Some residents received a call 4 weeks prior to an election, some received a call two weeks prior to an election, some received a call three days before an election, and some residents did not receive a call. The call made was a nonpartisan attempt to mobilize people to vote. Results indicate that the timing of the call may not have an effect on the general voter population, but that the timing can affect certain populations and get certain populations to vote at higher rates. According to Panagopoulos, high-propensity voters, voters who typically turn out in higher numbers, voted at higher percentages when they received the call four weeks prior to the election, demonstrating a primacy effect. However, for lower propensity voters, voters who typically do not vote, calls made three days prior to the election were more effective at getting this population to vote, demonstrating a recency effect. Therefore, for voter mobilization, propensity to vote appears to be a moderating variable influencing the effect of timing of a mobilization call.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Panagopoulos, C.|year=2011|title=Timing Is Everything?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6550">==Life history method==

The method was first used when interviewing [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] and specifically Native American leaders who were asked by an interviewer to describe their lives with an insight as to what it was like to be that particular [[person]]. The purpose of the interview was to capture a living picture of a disappearing (as such) people/[[Lifestyle (sociology)|way of life]].

Later the method was used to interview [[criminal]]s and [[prostitutes]] in [[Chicago]]. Interviewers looked at [[Social work|social]] and [[police]]-records, as well as the [[society]] in general, and asked subjects to talk about their lives. The resulting report discussed (i) Chicago at that particular time; (ii) how the subject viewed their own life (i.e. `how it was like to be this particular person') and (iii) how society viewed the subject and whether they would be [[incarceration|incarcerated]], receive help, perform social work, etc.
 
The landmark of the life history method was developed in the 1920s and most significantly embodied in [[The Polish Peasant in Europe and America]] by [[W.I Thomas]] and [[Florian Znaniecki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Story of Life History: Origins of the Life History Method in Sociology|last = Goodson|first = Ivor|authorlink=Ivor Goodson|date = November 12, 2009|journal = Identity: An International Journal of Theory and Research|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;The authors employed a Polish immigrant to write his own life story which they then interpreted and analyzed. According to Martin Bulmer, it was "the first systematically collected sociological life history".&lt;ref name="Bulmer1986-54"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Bulmer|title=The Chicago School of Sociology: Institutionalization, Diversity, and the Rise of Sociological Research|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o0dJJZvcE2YC&amp;pg=PA54|date=15 August 1986|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-08005-5|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach later lost momentum as quantitative methods became more prevalent in American sociology. The method was revived in the 1970s, mainly through the efforts of French sociologist [[Daniel Bertaux]] and Paul Thompson whose life history research focused on such professions as bakers and fishermen. Major initiatives of the life history method were undertaken also in Germany, Italy, and Finland.

In the German context, the life history method is closely associated with the development of [[biographical research]] and biographical-narrative interviews. The [[narrative interview]] as a method for conducting open narrative interviews in empirical [[social research]] was developed in [[Germany]] around 1975. It borrowed concepts from [[Phenomenology (sociology)|phenomenology]] ([[Alfred Schütz]]), [[symbolic interactionism]] ([[George Herbert Mead]]), [[ethnomethodology]] ([[Harold Garfinkel]]), and [[sociology of knowledge]] ([[Karl Mannheim]]). The development and improvement of the method are closely connected to German sociologist [[Fritz Schütze]], part of the [[Bielefeld Sociologist’s Working Group]], which maintained close academic cooperation with American sociolinguists and social scientists such as [[Erving Goffman]], [[Harvey Sacks]], [[John J. Gumperz|John Gumpertz]], and [[Anselm Strauss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Köttig|first=Michaela|last2=Völter|first2=Bettina|date=December 2015|title=„Das ist Soziologe sein!“ – Ein narratives Interview mit Fritz Schütze zur Geschichte seines Werkes in der Soziologie|url=http://www.nwrsa.de/wp-content/uploads/Schuetze-Interview_1_2017.pdf|journal=Rundbrief 69/ Dezember 2015 der Sektion Biographieforschung in der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Soziologie|volume=|pages=35 – 53|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis of life histories was further developed by the biographical case reconstruction method of German sociologist [[Gabriele Rosenthal]] for the analysis of life ''history'' and life ''story''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.univerlag.uni-goettingen.de/bitstream/handle/3/isbn-978-3-86395-374-4/rosenthal_interpretive.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|title=Interpretive Social Research. An Introduction.|last=Rosenthal|first=Gabriele|publisher=Universitätsverlag Göttingen|year=2018|isbn=978-3-86395-374-4|location=Göttingen|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenthal differentiates between the level of analysis of the ''narrated'' life story (''erzählte Lebensgeshichte'') and the ''experienced'' life history (''erlebte Lebensgeschichte'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenthal|first=Gabriele|date=1993|title=Reconstruction of life stories: principles of selection in generating stories for narrative biographical interviews.|url=https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/bitstream/handle/document/5929/ssoar-tnsl-1993-1-rosenthal-reconstruction_of_life_stories.pdf?sequence=1|journal=The narrative study of lives|volume=1(1)|pages=59-91|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
In both cases, the one doing the interview should be careful not to ask "yes or no"-questions, but to get the subject to tell "the story of his or her life", in his or her own words. This is called the "[[narrative]]" method. It is common practice to begin the interview with the subject's early childhood and to proceed [[chronology|chronologically]] to the present. Another approach, dating from the Polish Peasant, is to ask participants to write their own life stories. This can be done either through competitions (as in Poland, Finland or Italy) or by collecting written life stories written spontaneously. In these countries, there are already large collections of life stories, which can be used by researchers.

This article provides a '''list of motherboard [[chipset]]s made by [[Intel]]''', divided into three main categories: those that use the [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] bus for interconnection (the 4xx series), those that connect using specialized "hub links" (the 8xx series), and those that connect using [[PCI Express]] (the 9xx series). The chipsets are listed in chronological order.

&lt;!-- Don't know, should we include this? === CT's 82C100 "XT controller" chip ===
One of the first to integrated these functions into a chipset was [[Chips and Technologies]] (CT) with its 82C100 "XT controller" chip for [[Intel 80286]].--&gt;

==Early chipsets==
To integrate the functions needed on a mainboard into a smaller amount of ICs, Intel licensed the [[ZyMOS]] POACH chipset for its [[Intel 80286]] and [[Intel 80386]]SX processors (the 82230/82231 High Integration AT-Compatible Chip Set). This chipset can be used with an 82335 High-integration Interface Device to provide support for the Intel 386SX.&lt;ref name="intel1989"/&gt;

Because of this, the same chipset can be used for [[Socket 8]], [[Socket 370]], [[Slot 1]], or [[Slot 2]] designs with any CPU in the [[P6 (microarchitecture)|P6]] family. In practice however, newer chipset designs are usually made only for the newer processor packages, and older ones may not be updated to accommodate for recent package designs. In addition, certain chipsets may be implemented in motherboards with different processor packages, much like how the 440FX could be used either with a Pentium Pro (Socket 8) or Pentium II (Slot 1). A new feature for the latest Intel chipsets is hardware virtualization support (Intel VT-d).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.intel.com/technology/itj/2006/v10i3/2-io/1-abstract.htm |title=Ultrabook, SmartPhone, Laptop, Desktop, Server, &amp; Embedded– Intel |publisher=Intel.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chipset support for this technology is not very clear for the moment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/virtualization-software-development/topic/56802/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314051946/https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/virtualization-software-development/topic/56802/ |date=March 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} || rowspan="2" | FSB || rowspan="2" | SMP || colspan="3" | Memory || rowspan="2" | Parity/ECC || rowspan="2" | PCI support || rowspan="2" | AGP support

* 875P (Canterwood)
** Similar to E7205, but adds support for 800&amp;nbsp;MHz bus, DDR at 400&amp;nbsp;MHz, [[Intel Communication Streaming Architecture|Communication Streaming Architecture]] (CSA), [[Serial ATA]] (with [[redundant array of independent disks|RAID]] in certain configurations) and [[Performance acceleration technology|Performance Acceleration Technology]] (PAT), a mode purported to cut down memory latency.
**SMP capability exists only on Xeon-based (socket 604) motherboards using the 875P chipset. FSB is rated at {{nowrap|533&amp;nbsp;MHz}} on these motherboards.
* 865PE (Springdale)
** 875P without PAT, though it was possible to enable PAT in some early revisions. Also lacks ECC Memory support.
** Sub-versions:
*** 865P - Similar to 865PE, but supports only 400/533&amp;nbsp;MHz bus and 333&amp;nbsp;MHz memory.
*** 848P - Single memory channel version of 865PE.
* 865G (Springdale-G)
** 865PE with integrated graphics ([[Intel Extreme Graphics 2]]). PAT never supported in any revisions.
** Sub-versions:
*** 865GV - 865G without external AGP slot.

Summary:
* 915P (Grantsdale)
** Supports Pentium 4 on an 800&amp;nbsp;MT/s bus. Uses DDR memory up to 400&amp;nbsp;MHz, or DDR2 at 533&amp;nbsp;MHz. Replaces AGP and CSA with PCI Express, and also supports "[[Intel Matrix RAID|Matrix RAID]]", a RAID mode designed to allow the usage of RAID levels 0 and 1 simultaneously with two hard drives. (Normally RAID1+0 would have required four hard drives)
** Sub-versions:
*** 915PL - Cut-down version of 915P with no support for DDR2 and only supporting 2&amp;nbsp;GB of memory.
* 915G (Grantsdale-G)
** 915P with an integrated GMA&amp;nbsp;900. This core contains Pixel Shader version 2.0 only, it does not contain Vertex Shaders nor does it feature Transform &amp; Lighting (T&amp;L) capabilities and therefore is not Direct X 8.1 or 9.0 compliant.
** Sub-versions:
*** 915GL - Same feature reductions as 915PL, but supports 4&amp;nbsp;GB of memory. No support for external graphics cards.
*** 915GV - Same as 915G, but has no way of adding an external graphics card.
*** 910GL - No support for external graphics cards or 800&amp;nbsp;MT/s bus.
* 925X (Alderwood)
** Higher end version of 915. Supports another PAT-like mode and ECC memory, and exclusively uses DDR-II RAM.
** Sub-versions:
*** 925XE - Supports a 1066&amp;nbsp;MT/s bus.
* 945P (Lakeport)
** Update on 915P, with support for Serial ATA II, RAID mode 5, an improved memory controller with support for DDR-II at 667&amp;nbsp;MHz and additional PCI Express lanes. Support for DDR-I is dropped. Formal dual-core support was added to this chipset.
** Sub-versions:
*** 945PL - No support for 1066&amp;nbsp;MT/s bus, only supports 2&amp;nbsp;GB of memory.
* 945G (Lakeport-G)
** A version of the 945P that has a GMA&amp;nbsp;950 integrated, supports a 1066&amp;nbsp;MT/s bus.
** Sub-versions:
***945GC - Same feature reductions as 945PL but with an integrated [[GMA 950]].
***945GZ - Same as 945GC but only supports DDR2 memory at 400/533&amp;nbsp;MT/s. No support for external graphics cards (some boards, like Asus P5GZ-MX, support through ICH7 on PCIe ×16 @4 lanes mode).
* 955X (Lakeport)
** Update for 925X, with additional features of "Lakeport" (e.g., PAT features and ECC memory), and uses DDR2.

&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; The 975X chipset supports only ×16 PCI Express (electrically) in the top slot when the slot below it is unpopulated. Otherwise it and the lower slot (both attached to the Memory Controller Hub) operate at ×8 electrically.

&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; Officially 975X supports a maximum of 1066&amp;nbsp;MT/s FSB. Unofficially, third-party motherboards (Asus, Gigabyte) support certain 1333FSB 45&amp;nbsp;nm Core2 processors, usually with later BIOS updates.

&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; The 975X chipset technical specification shows only DDR2-533/667 memory support. Actual implementations of 975X do support DDR2 800.

&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; VT-d is inherently supported on these chipsets, but may not be enabled by individual OEMs. ''Always'' read the motherboard manual and check for BIOS updates. X38/X48 VT-d support is limited to certain Intel, Supermicro, DFI (LanParty) and Tyan boards. VT-d is broken or non existent on some boards until the BIOS is updated. Note that VT-d is a chipset Memory Controller Hub technology, not a processor feature, but this is complicated by later processor generations (Core i3/i5/i7) moving the MCH from the motherboard to the processor package, making only certain I series CPUs support VT-d.

=={{anchor|56789SERIES}}5/6/7/8/9 Series chipsets==
The [[Nehalem (microarchitecture)|Nehalem microarchitecture]] moves the memory controller into the processor. For high-end Nehalem processors, the [[Intel X58|X58 IOH]] acts as a bridge from the [[Intel QuickPath Interconnect|QPI]] to PCI Express peripherals and DMI to the [[ICH10]] southbridge. For mainstream and lower-end Nehalem processors, the integrated memory controller (IMC) is an entire [[Northbridge (computing)|northbridge]] (some even having GPUs), and the [[Platform Controller Hub|PCH (Platform Controller Hub)]] acts as a [[southbridge (computing)|southbridge]].

Not listed below is the 3450 chipset (see [[Intel Xeon chipsets|Xeon chipsets]]) which is compatible with Nehalem mainstream and high-end processors but does not claim core iX-compatibility. With either a [[Intel Core i5|Core i5]] or [[Intel Core i3|i3]] processor, the 3400-series chipsets enable the [[Forward error correction|ECC]] functionality of [[Unbuffered memory|unbuffered]] ECC memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silentpcreview.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=60512&amp;start=60|title=Intel correspondence quoted on silentpcreview forum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise these chipsets do not enable unbuffered ECC functionality.

The [[Cougar Point]] Intel 6 series chipsets with stepping B2 were [[Product recall|recalled]] due to a [[Sandy Bridge#Cougar Point chipset flaw|hardware bug]] that causes their 3&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s Serial ATA to degrade over time until they become unusable. Stepping B3 of the Intel 6 series chipsets will have the fix for this. The Z68 chipset which supports CPU overclocking and use of the integrated graphics does not have this hardware bug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/4142/intel-discovers-bug-in-6series-chipset-begins-recall |title=Intel Discovers Bug in 6-Series Chipset: Our Analysis |publisher=AnandTech |date= |accessdate=2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Z68 also added support for transparently caching hard disk data on to [[solid-state drive]]s (up to 64&amp;nbsp;GB), a technology called [[Smart Response Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcper.com/reviews/Storage/Intel-Smart-Response-Technology-SSD-Caching-Z68-Tested/Boot-Option-ROM-Boot-Performa Intel Smart Response Technology: SSD Caching on Z68 Tested], PC Perspective&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tommy John surgery (TJS),''' known in [[medicine|medical]] [[medical practice|practice]] as '''ulnar collateral ligament''' ('''UCL''') '''reconstruction''', is a [[Graft (surgery)|surgical graft]] procedure in which the [[ulnar collateral ligament of elbow joint|ulnar collateral ligament]] in the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|medial]] [[Elbow-joint|elbow]] is replaced with either a [[tendon]] from elsewhere from the patient's own body, or the use of a tendon from the donated tissue from a [[cadaver]]. The procedure is common among collegiate and professional athletes in several sports, most notably [[baseball]].

The procedure was first performed in 1974 by orthopedic surgeon Dr. [[Frank Jobe]], then a [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] team physician. The surgery is named after [[Tommy John]], the first recipient of the surgery. John won 288 games in his career, which was extended by the surgery. Many players since have had Tommy John surgery.

This is a '''list of inorganic and organic reagents''' commonly used in chemistry.

==Synopsis==
[[Reagent]]s are "substances or compounds that are added to a system in order to bring about a chemical reaction or are added to see if a reaction occurs."&lt;ref name=gold&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Reactant |file=R05163 |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some reagents are just a single element.  However, most processes require reagents made of [[chemical compound]]s.  Some of the most common ones are listed below. These are some of the chemical reagants, there are many more.

==Reagent Compounds==

''' ''Mathematics and Plausible Reasoning'' ''' is a two-volume book by the mathematician [[George Pólya]] describing various methods for being a good guesser of new mathematical results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Polya|first1=George|title=Mathematics and Plausible Reasoning Volume I: Induction and Analogy in Mathematics|date=1954|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Polya|first1=George|title=Mathematics and Plausible Reasoning Volume II: Patterns of Plausible Inference|date=1954|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Preface to Volume 1 of the book Pólya exhorts all interested students of mathematics thus: "Certainly, let us learn proving, but also let us learn guessing." [[P. R. Halmos]] reviewing the book summarised the central thesis of the book thus: ". . . a good guess is as important as a good proof."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halmos|first1=Paul R.|title=Review: G. Pólya, Mathematics and plausible reasoning|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|date=1955|volume=61|issue=3 Part 1|pages=243–245|url=http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.bams/1183519731|accessdate=16 February 2015|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1955-09904-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outline==

===Volume I: Induction and analogy in mathematics===
Polya begins Volume I with a discussion on [[Inductive reasoning|induction]], not the [[mathematical induction]],  as a way of guessing new results. He shows how the chance observations of a few results of the form 4&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2, 6&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3, 8&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5, 10&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;7, etc., may prompt a sharp mind to formulate the conjecture that every even number greater than 4 can be represented as the sum of two odd [[prime number]]s. This is the well known [[Goldbach's conjecture]]. The first problem in the first chapter is to guess the rule according to which the successive terms of the following sequence are chosen: 11, 31, 41, 61, 71, 101, 131, . . . In the next chapter the techniques of generalization, specialization and analogy are presented as possible strategies for plausible reasoning. In the remaining chapters, these ideas are illustrated by discussing the discovery of several results in  various fields of mathematics like number theory, geometry, etc. and also in physical sciences.

===Volume II: Patterns of Plausible Inference===

This volume attempts to formulate certain patterns of [[plausible reasoning]]. The relation of these patterns with the calculus of probability are also investigated. Their relation to mathematical invention and instruction are also discussed. The following are
some of the patterns of plausible inference discussed by Polya.

'''Mercury-Atlas 9''' was the final [[manned space mission]] of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Mercury program]], launched on May 15, 1963 from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 14|Launch Complex 14]] at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida]]. The spacecraft, named '''''Faith 7''''', completed 22 Earth orbits before splashing down in the [[Pacific Ocean]], piloted by astronaut [[Gordon Cooper]], then an Air Force major. The [[Atlas LV-3B|Atlas]] rocket was No. 130-D, and the Mercury spacecraft was No. 20.  This mission marks the last time an American was launched alone to conduct an entirely solo orbital mission.

==Mission highlights==

The flight of ''[[Mercury-Atlas 8|Sigma 7]]'' had been so nearly perfect that some at NASA thought America should quit while it was ahead and make [[Mercury 8|MA-8]] the last [[Project Mercury|Mercury mission]], and not risk the chance of future disaster. [[NASA]] had pushed the first-generation Mercury hardware far enough, and taking more chances on another longer mission was not warranted; instead, they should move on to the [[Gemini program]].

Manned Spacecraft Center officials, however, believed that the Mercury team should be given the chance to test man in space for a full day. In addition, all of the Soviet single-seat [[Vostok spacecraft]] launched after [[Vostok 1]] lasted for more than a day, thus the Mercury 9 flight would bring the Mercury spacecraft up to the same level as that of the Soviets.

In September 1962, NASA concluded negotiations with [[McDonnell Aircraft Corporation|McDonnell]] to modify four Mercury spacecraft (#12, #15, #17 and #20) to a configuration that supported a one-day mission. Such changes to the spacecraft included the removal of the periscope, a redundant set of thrusters, and the addition of extra batteries and oxygen tanks.

[[File:Cooper - GPN-2000-000997.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Lift off of MA-9]]

In November 1962, [[Gordon Cooper]] was chosen to pilot the MA-9 mission and [[Alan Shepard]] was picked as backup.

On April 22, 1963, Atlas booster 130-D and Mercury spacecraft #20 were stacked on the launch pad at Launch Complex 14.

Because MA-9 would orbit over nearly every part of the world from 32.5 degrees north to 32.5 degrees south, a total of 28 ships, 171 aircraft, and 18,000 servicemen were assigned to support the mission.

The Atlas booster used for MA-9 sported several technical improvements, most notably an enhanced propulsion system with a hypergolic igniter that would eliminate the need for hold-down time at launch to prevent rough combustion. With seven successful Mercury launches in a row, the failures of the early days seemed like a distant memory by early 1963 and NASA officials had a high degree of confidence in the Atlas that overshadowed its still spotty launch record. At the first meeting of senior MSFC officials for the year (January 4), Walter Williams noted that the Air Force had yet to provide an explanation for two Atlas F failures during the second half of 1962. Until the investigation committees released their findings and cleared the Atlas D of guilt by association, Cooper's flight could be delayed. During the seven months between Schirra and Cooper's flights, there were five failures of Atlas D vehicles (one of them an Atlas-Agena, the rest operational ICBM tests). NASA did not let its guard down on the Atlas, despite the recent high degree of success enjoyed by Project Mercury.

When Atlas 130D received its factory rollout on January 30, it was found to have damaged wiring and had to be sent back for repairs. At his first press conference on February 8, Gordon Cooper admitted to not knowing much about the booster problems and focused instead on the enhancements made to his Mercury capsule. The numerous added equipment and consumables for the day-long mission boosted the weight of Faith 7 considerably; it now weighed over 3000 pounds.

On March 15, the Atlas was rolled out of the factory a second time and passed tests with flying colors; Convair engineers expressed confidence that this "was their best bird yet". Aside from the new propulsion system, the booster received some slight modifications to the engine offsets to counteract the potentially dangerous roll that occurred during Schirra's launch. The booster also sported an improved calibration of the propellant utilization system.

The upgraded MA-2 engines featured baffled injector heads and a hypergolic igniter, eliminating any concerns of rough combustion or the need for hold-down time prior to liftoff. As such, the RCC (Rough Combustion Cutoff) sensors on 130D were operated open loop and for qualitative purposes only.

Cooper's decision to name his capsule "Faith 7" was based on the faith he had in the Atlas booster and Mercury capsule to carry out the mission successfully, although it was reported in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that some NASA officials were skeptical of the idea.

When Cooper boarded Faith 7 at 6:36 AM on the morning of May 14, he found a little gift that had been left for him. Alan Shepard, knowing that Cooper would have a new version of the [[urine]] containment device that Shepard did not have on his [[Mercury-Redstone 3]] flight (forcing him to relieve himself during a long countdown hold), had left behind a [[toilet plunger]] as a joke. Instructions on the handle said, "Remove Before Launch". The gift did not make the trip. Neither did Cooper that day. Various problems with radar in [[Bermuda]] and the diesel engine that rolled back the gantry caused the launch to be cancelled until May 15.

At 8:04:13&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|EST]], May 15, 1963,&lt;ref name="Whitfield"&gt;{{cite book

At T+2 minutes 14 seconds Cooper felt BECO (Booster Engine Cutoff) and staging. The two Atlas booster engines had been left behind. The Launch Escape Tower was then jettisoned. At T+3 minutes the cabin pressure sealed at {{convert|5.5|psi|kPa|abbr=on}}. Cooper reported, "Faith 7 is all go."

At about T+5 minutes was SECO (Sustainer Engine Cutoff) and ''Faith 7'' entered orbit at 17,547&amp;nbsp;mph (7,844&amp;nbsp;m/s). After the spacecraft separated and turned around to [[attitude control|orbit attitude]], Cooper watched his Atlas booster lag behind and tumble for about eight minutes. Over [[Zanzibar]] on the first orbit, he learned that the orbital parameters were good enough for at least 20 orbits. As the spacecraft passed over Guaymas, Mexico still on the first orbit, capsule communicator [[Gus Grissom]] told Cooper the ground computers said he was "go for seven orbits".

Atlas performance was overall excellent. The upgraded propulsion system worked well, with slightly above nominal booster engine thrust. Measurable propellant slosh occurred from T+55 to T+120 seconds, caused by slightly lower than nominal autopilot gains. The flight trajectory was slightly more lofted than nominal due to the DC voltage in the booster electrical system being about 0.7 volts above normal, this was counteracted by the higher than nominal booster engine performance.

At the start of the third orbit, Cooper checked his list of 11 experiments that were on his schedule. His first task was to eject a six-inch (152&amp;nbsp;mm) diameter sphere, equipped with [[xenon flash lamp|xenon strobe lights]], from the nose of the spacecraft. This experiment was designed to test his ability to spot and track a flashing beacon in orbit. At T+3 hours 25 minutes, Cooper flipped the switch and heard and felt the beacon detach from the spacecraft. He tried to see the flashing light in the approaching dusk and on the nightside pass, but failed to do so. On the fourth orbit, he did spot the beacon and saw it pulsing. Cooper reported to [[Scott Carpenter]] on [[Kauai]], [[Hawaii]], "I was with the little rascal all night." He also spotted the beacon on his fifth and sixth orbits.

Also on the sixth orbit, at about T+9 hours, Cooper set up cameras, [[attitude control|adjusted the spacecraft attitude]] and set switches to deploy a tethered balloon from the nose of the spacecraft. It was a {{convert|30|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]] balloon painted fluorescent orange, inflated with nitrogen and attached to a {{convert|100|ft|m}} nylon line from the antenna canister. A strain gauge in the antenna canister would measure differences in atmospheric drag between the {{convert|100|mi|km}} perigee and the {{convert|160|mi|km}} apogee. Cooper tried several times to eject the balloon, but it failed to eject.

Cooper passed [[Walter Schirra|Schirra's]] orbital record on the seventh orbit while he was engaged in radiation experiments. After 10 hours, the [[Zanzibar]] tracking station informed Cooper the flight was a go for 17 orbits. Cooper was orbiting the Earth every 88 minutes 45 seconds at an inclination of 32.55 degrees to the equator.

His scheduled rest period was during orbits 9 through 13. He had a dinner of powdered roast beef mush and some water, took pictures of Asia and reported the spacecraft condition. Cooper was not sleepy and during orbit 9 took some of the best photos made during his flight. He took pictures of the [[Tibet]]an highlands and of the [[Himalayas]].
[[File:Mercury9 tibet.jpg|thumb|Picture of Tibet taken by Cooper]]
During the flight Cooper reported that he could see roads, rivers, small villages, and even individual houses if the lighting and background conditions were right. This was later confirmed by the two-man [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] crews that later flew (of which Cooper was included). Cooper slept intermittently the next six hours, during orbits 10 through 13. He woke from time to time and took more pictures, taped status reports, and kept adjusting his spacesuit temperature control which kept getting too hot or too cold.

On his fourteenth orbit, Cooper took an assessment of the spacecraft condition. The oxygen supply was sufficient. The peroxide fuel for [[attitude control]] was 69 percent in the automatic tank and 95 percent in the manual one. On the fifteenth orbit, he spent most of the time calibrating equipment and synchronizing clocks.

When he entered night on the sixteenth orbit, Cooper pitched the spacecraft to slowly follow the plane of the ecliptic. Through the spacecraft window he viewed the [[zodiacal light]] and night [[airglow]] layer. He took pictures of these two "dim light" phenomena from [[Zanzibar]], across the Earth's nightside, to [[Canton Island]]. The pictures were later found to have been overexposed, but they still contained valuable data.

At the start of the 17th orbit while crossing [[Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida]], Cooper transmitted [[slow-scan television|slow scan]] black and white television pictures to [[Mercury Control Center|Mercury Control]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.svengrahn.pp.se/radioind/Mercury/MercuryRadio.html&lt;/ref&gt; The picture showed a ghostly image of the astronaut. In the murky picture, a helmet and hoses could be seen.  It was the first time an American astronaut had sent back television images from space.

On the 17th and 18th orbits, Cooper took infrared weather photos and moonset Earth-limb pictures. He also resumed [[Geiger counter]] measurements of radiation. He sang during orbits 18 and 19, and marveled at the greenery of Earth. It was nearing thirty hours since liftoff.

==Technical problems on the flight==

On the 19th orbit, the first sign of trouble appeared when the spacecraft 0.05 g (0.5&amp;nbsp;m/s²) light came on. However, this turned out to be a faulty indicator, and the spacecraft was not reentering. On the 20th orbit, Cooper lost all [[attitude control|attitude]] readings. The 21st orbit saw a short-circuit occur in the bus bar serving the 250 volt main inverter. This left the automatic stabilization and control system without electric power.

On the 21st orbit, [[John Glenn]] on board the tracking ship [[USNS Coastal Sentry (T-AGM-15)|''Coastal Sentry Quebec'']] near [[Kyūshū]], [[Japan]], helped Cooper prepare a revised checklist for retrofire. Due to the system malfunctions, many of the steps would have to be done manually. Only [[Hawaii]] and [[Zanzibar]] were in radio range on this last orbit, but communications were good. Cooper noted that the carbon dioxide level was rising in the cabin and in his spacesuit. He told Carpenter as he passed over Zanzibar, "Things are beginning to stack up a little." Throughout the problems, Cooper remained cool, calm and collected.

Cooper did not experience much of an appetite during the flight and ate only because it was scheduled. The food containers and water dispenser system proved unwieldy and he was not able to properly prepare freeze-dried food packages, so he limited his consumption to cubed food and bite-sized sandwiches. Cooper found the cubed food largely unpalatable, which contributed to his lack of eating. He had no difficulty urinating during the flight and the urine collection system worked well, although transferring urine to storage bags in the cramped capsule proved difficult. Cooper took several naps during the flight, lasting about an hour each. He experienced some discomfort from the pressure suit compressing his knees, which he alleviated by moving his feet slightly upward. An hour and 20 minutes before retrofire, Cooper took a [[dextroamphetamine]] tablet to ensure his alertness; he reported not feeling any sleepiness for the remainder of the flight.

At the end of the 21st orbit, Cooper again contacted Glenn on the ''Coastal Sentry Quebec''. He reported the spacecraft was in retro attitude and holding manually. The checklist was complete. Glenn gave a ten-second countdown to retrofire. Cooper kept the spacecraft aligned at a 34° pitchdown angle and manually fired the retrorockets on "Mark!".

Cooper had drawn lines on the window to stay aligned with constellations as he flew the craft. He later said he used his wristwatch to time the burn and his eyes to [[attitude control|maintain attitude]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/05/2-060-minutes-gordo-cooper-and-the-last-american-solo-flight-in-space/275988/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:USS Kearsarge (CVS-33) crew spells out 'Mercury 9' on the flight deck on 15 May 1963 (GPN-2000-001403).jpg|thumb|The crew of USS ''Kearsarge'' spells out "MERCURY 9" on the flight deck while underway to the recovery area]]

Fifteen minutes later ''Faith 7'' landed just four miles (6&amp;nbsp;km) from the prime recovery ship, the carrier [[USS Kearsarge (CV-33)|USS ''Kearsarge'']]. This was the most accurate landing to date, despite the lack of automatic controls. ''Faith 7'' landed {{convert|70|nmi|km}} southeast of [[Midway Atoll|Midway Island]], in the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;NASA SP-45 "Mercury Project Summary Including Results of the Fourth Manned Orbital Flight"&lt;/ref&gt; This would be near {{coord|27|30|N|176|15|W|}}.

Splashdown was at 34 hours 19 minutes 49 seconds after liftoff. The spacecraft tipped over in the water momentarily, then righted itself. Helicopters dropped rescue swimmers and relayed Cooper's request of an Air Force officer for permission to be hoisted aboard the Navy's carrier. Permission was granted. Forty minutes later the explosive hatch blew open on the deck of the ''Kearsarge''. Cooper stepped out of ''Faith 7'' to a warm greeting.

Postflight medical examination of Cooper found that he was slightly dehydrated and experienced a degree of orthostatic hypotension from being seated in the capsule an entire day, but other than that no significant effects from the flight were noted.

After the MA-9 mission, there was another debate about whether to fly one more Mercury flight, [[Mercury 10|Mercury-Atlas 10]] (MA-10). It was proposed as a three-day, 48-orbit mission to be flown by [[Alan Shepard]] in October 1963. In the end, NASA officials decided it was time to move on to [[Project Gemini]] and MA-10 never flew.

The [[Mercury program]] had fulfilled all of its goals.

Sign Language communication is a system of communication using visual gestures and signs, as used by deaf people. A unique property of [[Sign Language]] is that it is not easy to put on paper due to a lack of formal acceptance, &lt;ref name="written-forms"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_language#Written_forms|title=Written Sign Language forms on Wikipedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is impossible to be mediated over the phone or in a plain email. Because of its three-dimensional nature, it can only be transferred in the form of timed two or three dimensional snapshots, also known as a video. The video itself has to be large and fast enough to capture sign language movements sufficiently.

In the late 1990s, it became possible for deaf people to use electronic communication tools as another channel for [[Sign Language]]. Initially, there weren't many choices prior to the advent of more interfaces (e.g. APIs like {{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/mediacapture-streams/#dom-navigator-getusermedias|title=getUserMedia}}). With these, however, deaf people can perform electronic sign language exchanges independently without the need for a third person in the middle, i.e. a [[Video relay service]].

'''NIST-7''' was the [[atomic clock]] used by the [[United States]] from 1993 to 1999. It was one of a series of Atomic Clocks &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Brief History of Atomic Clocks at NIST|url = http://tf.nist.gov/cesium/atomichistory.htm|website = tf.nist.gov|access-date = 2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]. The [[caesium]] beam clock served as the nation's primary [[time]] and frequency standard during that time period, but it has since been replaced with the more accurate [[NIST-F1]], a [[caesium fountain]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How Does the NIST-7 Atomic Clock Work? {{!}} Time and Navigation|url = https://timeandnavigation.si.edu/multimedia-asset/how-does-the-nist-7-atomic-clock-work|website = timeandnavigation.si.edu|access-date = 2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; atomic clock that neither gains nor loses one second in 100 million years.

The '''Olbers-Planetarium''' is located in the [[Bremen (state)|Free Hanseatic City of Bremen]], [[Germany]], recording about 25.000 visitors a year. It was named after [[Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers]] (1758 – 1840), a doctor and astronomer from Bremen. 

==Location and transport connection==
The planetarium is located within the [[City University of Applied Sciences (Bremen)|City Unversity of Applied Sciences Bremen]]. From the main station tram  4 (Arsten), 6 (Flughafen/Airport) and 8 (Huchting) as well as bus 24 (Rablinghausen) pass the stop ‘Wilhelm-Kaisen-Brücke’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bsag.de/de/auskunft.html|title=BSAG: Auskunft|website=Bsag.de|accessdate=28 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is another 400 meters by foot to reach the planetarium. The planetarium is well connected to the historic town centre which features the [[Bremen City Hall]], the [[Bremen Cathedral]], [[Böttcherstraße]], the [[Schnoor]] and the [[Schlachte (Bremen)|Schlachte promenade]].
[[file:Openmaps Planetarium.jpg|thumb|right|Olbers-Planetarium location in Bremen via Openstreetmaps&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.openstreetmap.de/karte.html|title=OpenStreetMap Deutschland: Karte|website=Openstreetmap.de|accessdate=28 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

== Events and Shows&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planetarium.hs-bremen.de/programm/programme.php|title=Olbers-Planetarium Bremen - Unsere Programme|first=Dieter Vornholz und Lars|last=Nerger|website=Planetarium.hs-bremen.de|accessdate=28 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; == 
The planetarium offers shows 365 days a year. During the school holidays in Bremen the planetarium is running a holiday programme. All shows are held in German, however it is possible to request shows in a different language. Shows usually last about one hour.

=== History ===
The planetarium opened its doors on 23 January 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Olbers-Planetarium Bremen - Geschichte des Planetariums|periodical= |website=Planetarium.hs-bremen.de|url=http://planetarium.hs-bremen.de/planetarium/geschichte.html|deadurl=|format= |accessdate=2018-03-19|archiveurl=|archivedate= |last=Dieter Vornholz und Lars Nerger|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Back in the day it was part of the nautical college in [[Bremen]], now the [[City University of Applied Sciences (Bremen)|City University of Applied Sciences]] and its primary cause was to train nautical students in [[Celestial navigation]]. The first projector in place was the ZKP 1, which the German Hydrographical Institute, now called the [[Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany]]) funded. It was originally developed for the navigational institutions of the [[Kriegsmarine]] and [[Luftwaffe]].

In 1958 the nautical college moved to [[Platz der Alten Synagoge#Werderstraße|Werderstraße]]  73 where the planetarium is still located today. In 1979 a more modern projector, the ZKP 2 was introduced. Dr. Erwin Mücke had applied for funding from the German Research Foundation. The same year they also received a solar system projector, funded by the senat for Education and Science. The old ZKP 1 was sold to the college in [[Nordenham]] where it is still in use today. 

Since 2015 a hybrid system is in use. The main projector was upgraded with parts from a more recent model.

=== Research===
In the 1950s ornithological research was conducted at the Olbers-Planetarium. Dr. Franz and Dr. Eleonore Sauer from the Zoological Institute of the [[University of Freiburg]] observed the orientation of [[Warbler|Warblers]] using artificial night-skies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renken.de/planetarium_bremen_dlrk2004.pdf|format=PDF|title=Nutzung des Bremer Olbers-Planetariums zur anschaulichen Vermittlung raumfahrtbezogener Inhalte|website=Renken.de|accessdate=28 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2017 the [[Lund University]] in Sweden published a paper on [[Dung beetle]] orientation. The scenes for that particular research project were amongst other places, taken at the planetarium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsb/285/1871/20172322.full.pdf|format=PDF|title=How animals follow the stars|author1=James J. Foster|author2=Jochen Smolka|author3=Dan-Eric Nilsson|author4=Marie Dacke|website=Rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org|accessdate=28 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cooperation with the Olbers Society===
The Walter Stein Observatory is run by the [[Olbers Society]], named in honour of [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olbers-gesellschaft.de/index.php/sternwarte|title=Sternwarte|website=Olbers-gesellschaft.de|accessdate=28 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter months from October to April, the observatory is open on selected days. The Olbers Society occasionally uses the planetarium for guest talks. The observatory and the planetarium are located in the same building.

=== Congress ===
In 2018 the [[International Astronautical Congress]] is held in Bremen and the Planetarium is part of many projects as part of the astronautical year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iac2018.org/|title=IAC2018 :: home|website=Iac2018.org|accessdate=28 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''portrayal of women scientists in film''' refers to the way that professional women in [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)]] fields are written as film characters. The portrayal of women is a hotly contested talking point in the film community, with feminists saying that women are not accurately depicted in films. Judith Mayne, author and professor of women's studies at [[Ohio State University]], claims that the study of female characters in film began with movements from the 1960s and 1970s in the form of [[second-wave feminism]], the rise of [[independent film]]s, and the beginning of academic [[film studies]].&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Mayne, Judith. “Feminist Film Theory and Criticism.” ''Signs'', vol. 11, no. 1, 1985, pp. 81–100. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/3174288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars offer several different stereotypes that academic women fall under in films. Eva Flicker, professor of sociology specializing in film at the [[University of Vienna]], is a leading scholar on the topic of academic women in film, specifically women in the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.soz.univie.ac.at/en/personnel/members-of-staff/test/eva-flicker-research-uni-wien/|title=Department of Sociology » Eva Flicker Research Uni Wien|website=www.soz.univie.ac.at|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flicker writes that the role of women scientists often reflect that "job stereotypes are combined with gender stereotypes."&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Hüppauf, Bernd-Rüdiger, and Peter Weingart, editors. ''Science Images and Popular Images of the Sciences''. vol. 8, Routledge, 2008, books.google.com/books?id=BE1j7Hs5egcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all scholars believe that objectification is reserved solely for female characters in films. [[Noël Carroll|Nöel Carroll]], professor of philosophy at [[Cornell University]], writes that men are also strategically blocked for the audience's viewing pleasure.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Carroll does not disagree with the notion that women are objectified in film; rather, his stance says that women are not the only ones affected by the erotic gaze of viewers.

== History of Women Scientists in Film ==
'''Gorillas in the Mist (1988)'''

The film [[Gorillas in the Mist]] based on the book by [[Dian Fossey]] appears to show respect for the fact that a [[woman]] would rather work on her career than be a stereotypical housewife.  The story is about the scientist Fossey that leaves the United States to study gorillas in Rwanda and Uganda. As she bonds with the gorillas, she worries about poachers and devotes her time to protecting the animals. Fossey is shown as an independent woman, breaking the common trope of women being the homemaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist Film Theory|last=Thornham|first=Sue|publisher=New York University Press|year=1999|isbn=9780814782446|location=New York|pages=325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jurassic Park (1993)'''

The 1993 film [[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]], based on the novel by [[Michael Crichton]] depicts a [[paleobotanist]], Dr. Ellie Sattler. She is portrayed with great physical ability, allowing her to survive multiple attacks from dinosaurs. She is shown to have extensive knowledge about dinosaurs and plant life throughout the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jurassic Park|last=Crichton|first=Michael|publisher=Ballantine Books|year=1990|isbn=0345370775|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gravity (2013)'''''

The 2013 film ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'', directed by [[Alfonso Cuarón]] and starring [[Sandra Bullock]] and [[George Clooney]], is often heralded as a breakthrough feminist film due to Bullock's starring role. Some who have critiqued the film have written that ''Gravity'' "proves that a woman can anchor an action-packed blockbuster that does ''not'' have to include violence, superheroes, weapons and/or huge death tolls."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://msmagazine.com/blog/2013/10/22/the-feminist-pull-of-gravity/|title=The Feminist Pull of "Gravity" - Ms. Magazine Blog|date=2013-10-22|work=Ms. Magazine Blog|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the film's lead is a woman, she gets by with help from her male counterpart, played by Clooney. Bullock's character Ryan Stone is described as "the very model of the damsel in distress," as she can never get out of a situation on her own and must lean on Clooney's character to do the heavy lifting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/nov/11/gravity-my-most-overrated-film|title=Gravity: my most overrated film|last=Evans|first=Alan|date=2014-11-11|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of Bullock's character is thought to be an act of defiant feminism, as she is the lead in a science fiction film, but below the surface viewers find that the film actually subscribes to traditional gender stereotypes and does not at all portray Bullock's character as a true independent woman.

== Ways of Analyzing Women in Film ==
In terms of intelligence, women are not often portrayed as equal to men. Eva Flicker writes that in science fiction films, men are overwhelmingly portrayed as scientists, making up 82% of all film scientists.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Flicker, Eva. “Between Brains and Breasts—Women Scientists in Fiction Film: On the Marginalization and Sexualization of Scientific Competence.” ''Public Understanding of Science'', vol. 12, no. 3, 2003, pp. 307–318., doi:10.1177/0963662503123009.&lt;/ref&gt; After reviewing 60 movies, Flicker has placed the women shown in science fiction films into six categories.

=== "The Old Maid" ===
This type of woman scientist is "only interested in her work"&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; and is often depicted having a nondescript appearance and style. As the film progresses, a man saves her and brings out her feminine side, after which she becomes more attractive. However, she loses credibility as an academic and suddenly makes more mistakes than when she did not focus as much on her appearance. Based on this type of story, Flicker concludes that "femininity and intelligence are mutually exclusive characteristics in a woman's film role."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; An example of this woman in a film can be seen in ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|,]] in the character Dr. Constance Peterson.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== "The Male Woman" ===
This type of woman works with men in an all male environment. Because of this, she has a "harsh voice" and occasionally "succumbs to an unhealthy lifestyle," such as partaking in smoking and drinking, to fit in with the boys.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Flicker claims that this type of woman is "lost somewhere in the middle" of masculinity and femininity, meaning she is not as sexual a character as other women are, but she is also not on the same level as the men she works with. This decreases her credibility both as a women and as one trying to fit into "a man's world." In the end, her heightened female emotions allow her to contribute to a solution, which is her redeeming quality as a character.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The "male woman" character appears in the 1970 [[science fiction]] film ''[[The Andromeda Strain (film)|Andromeda Strain]]''.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== "The Naïve Expert" ===
Seen in ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]'', this woman scientist does very little. For the sake of the dramatization of the film, she is crucial, but she does not advance the story and does not contribute much to the solution. Instead, her femininity causes more trouble for the team of scientists. She is young, attractive, and subject to experience womanly emotions which add an extra layer to the existing predicament, forcing the man to solve the problem in order to get the team out of trouble. She is "naïve in her actions," messing up every task that is given to her despite her extensive education and knowledge, while her male counterpart stands in stark contrast and ends up saving the day.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== "The Evil Plotter" ===
[[File:Alison Doody 2.jpg|thumb|Alison Doody, who played [[Indiana Jones]]'s attractive female counterpart Dr. Elsa Schneider in ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade''|259x259px]]
The "evil plotter" woman is young and very beautiful, and she uses her feminine charm to trick the men into doing what she wants. She has an ulterior motive, which is on the opposite end of the spectrum from what the rest of the team is trying to accomplish. She is the character that the audience and the other characters despise by the end of the movie because she is devilishly smart and knows how to use her scientific knowledge and sexual prowess for evil.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This bombshell character type was portrayed by [[Alison Doody]] as [[Dr. Elsa Schneider]] in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade|Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade]]''.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== "The Daughter/Assistant" ===
This role of female scientist encompasses many feminine stereotypes portrayed in movies. In this role the woman is subordinate to her male counterpart, who is either her father or her lover. She is smart and capable, but her secondary role does not allow her to demonstrate her abilities. Flicker writes that when this woman plays the role of lover to the male scientist, "her work place is limited to the bed."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; She is only good for sexual satisfaction, not for the degree she earned. The assistant role is seen in the female Dr. Medford in the film [[Them! (1954 film)|''Them!'']], as she is portrayed alongside an older gentleman of the same name.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== "The Lonely Heroine" ===

This type of woman scientist is intelligent, attractive, and somewhat independent. Flicker says that she "has appropriated some male traits," such as losing herself in her work. She is both sexual and smart, and she manages to exhibit both qualities in the film. Despite this, she is still subordinate to the men on her team, and depends on them and their work in order to gain respect. She is the most progressive of the woman scientist types, but she lacks her own form of independence and still must rely on a sexual relationship with a man in order to be seen as someone.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The "lonely heroine" type is best seen in [[Jodie Foster|Jodie Foster']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s portrayal of Elleonore Arroway in the film ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]''.
&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[File:SDCC13 - Gravity panel (9345233475) cropped.png|thumb|Sandra Bullock (center), with director Alfonso Cuarón (right), and producer [[David Heyman]]|195x195px]]

== Female Characters as Objects in Film ==
Flicker argues that women are often pigeonholed into these six limiting roles when written in films. Each of these roles places the female scientist character on the sidelines, and does not allow her to be on the same level as her male counterpart(s). Despite the fact that the women in these roles are educated, and often just as educated as the men on their team, they are used primarily as assistants and sexual characters. Producers strategically write women's roles for the male gaze, often making the female characters use their "weapons of a woman," such as sex appeal, to be attractive to male characters and viewers alike.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;
[[File:Laura Mulvey Fot Mariusz Kubik July 24 2010 03.JPG|thumb|Prominent feminist film theorist Laura Mulvey|227x227px]]
Feminist film theorist [[Laura Mulvey]] writes that in film, women are passive objects of the male gaze.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Mulvey, Laura. “Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema.” Film Theory and Criticism : Introductory Readings. Eds. Leo Braudy and Marshall Cohen. New York: Oxford UP, 1999: 833-44.&lt;/ref&gt; Mulvey writes that movies fulfill "a primordial wish for pleasurable looking," and that male audiences are largely catered to in the film industry.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In her analysis of film, she states that the lead woman in a film often falls in love with her male counterpart, and when she does, she only exists as a character to please him. Through the male character's ownership of the woman, the men in the audience find themselves owning her as well.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Male gaze is a big factor to consider when looking at female scientists and how they are portrayed in films. Typically women are viewed as sexual objects for pleasure of males who view these films. This has a direct effect on how people interpret women scientists and their role in movies. Instead of being portrayed as superheroes, they begin to obtain a reputation based on sexual appeal.

Considering superhero films, Amy Shackelford mentions how the [[male gaze]] is applied to hypersexualize the female character, further misinterpreting women in the media through visual depiction. Looking at these particular films, screenwriters have a difficult time accomplishing the task of writing female characters. Shackelford also states that it seems like the only way these screenwriters know how to portray female characters in superhero films power is to hypersexualize them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://everydayfeminism.com/2013/11/female-characters-superhero-films/|title=The Grim Reality of Female Characters in Superhero Films|last=Shackelford|first=Amy|date=November 30, 2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judith Mayne supports Laura Mulvey's view. She writes that "most feminist film theory and criticism of the last decade" has been in written in response to Mulvey's 1975 assessment, "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; She argues that understanding the often sexist portrayal of women in film requires "an understanding of patriarchy as oppressive and as vulnerable."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Mayne goes deeper in her argument claiming that feminist film theory inspired feminist documentaries that are "aimed at rejecting stereotyped images of women."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This criticism also opens the question about "the notion of woman as 'image.'"&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Law professor Sarah Eschholz and her colleagues Jana Bufkin and Jenny Long write that in film, women are often young, and female characters are rarely played by middle aged or older women.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Eschholz, Sarah, et al. “Symbolic Reality Bites: Women And Racial/Ethnic Minorities In Modern Film.” ''Sociological Spectrum'', vol. 22, no. 3, 2002, pp. 299–334., doi:10.1080/02732170290062658.&lt;/ref&gt; Often the only role available to these women is that of the mother, who is not meant to be a leading character. They write that "females' primary societal value is based on physical appearance and youthful beauty."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; According to their assessment, men are valued at all ages, and arguably more so as they age and become wiser. Most women in film are 35 years old or younger, while their male costars are often older.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Despite women in film having impressive credentials and extensive educations, they are often reduced to objects for looking, due to a reluctance to hire an older, less attractive woman for a major role.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

In the traditional husband and wife family, women are often portrayed as the second in command. Their husbands take on the role of family head and get to maintain a bachelor level of freedom, which allows them to work and spend time out with the guys. Eschholz, Bufkin, and Long report on studies that show female characters are more likely to be married and have a family than male characters.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Men have the freedom to work and be protagonists through their actions, while their wives or girlfriends are forced to take a back seat in the story in order to care for the family.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Opposing Views ==
Nöel Carroll references Mulvey's pivotal paper on psychoanalysis and visual pleasure in his writing, and plays devil's advocate to her claim that women are the only subjects of gaze. Carroll acknowledges and agrees with Mulvey's assessment that women in film are strategically placed for the male gaze despite the role of their actual character. Carroll states, "Women in Hollywood film are staged and blocked for the purpose of male erotic contemplation and pleasure."&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Carroll, Noël. “The Image of Women in Film: A Defense of a Paradigm.” ''The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'', vol. 48, no. 4, 1990, pp. 349–360. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/431572.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Carroll adds that men in films are also strategically placed for the purpose of pleasure. He cites such examples as [[Sylvester Stallone]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], big bodybuilding actors "whose scenes are blocked and staged precisely to afford spectacles of bulging pectorals and other parts."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Similarly to actresses, male actors are also heralded for their facial attractiveness and are sometimes lauded exclusively for being attractive. As an example, Carroll brings in [[Leslie Howard]], an actor in ''[[Of Human Bondage (1934 film)|Of Human Bondage]]'' and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]],'' who was highly successful in the industry despite being "staggeringly ineffectual."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; According to Carroll, being subject to the erotic gaze of the audience is not an exclusively female burden; rather, both sexes fall prey to Hollywood camera angles that best show off their bodies.

[[Kristin Thompson]], an American film theorist, analyzes the film ''[[Laura (1944 film)|Laura]].'' In her analysis, she claims that the main character, Laura, was written to embody the role of "passive visual object," which Mulvey and Flicker claim is an extremely prevalent role of women in film.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, Thompson, like Carroll, does not believe that this passive role is limited to women in the industry. Thompson claims that Mulvey's assessment stating that women are used as objects and men cannot handle being the subject of gaze is  "common but not universal" in the film industry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/17326947|title=Breaking the glass armor : neoformalist film analysis|last=1950-|first=Thompson, Kristin,|date=1988|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691067244|location=Princeton, N.J.|oclc=17326947}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claims that men are also presented in flashy ways in film, and gives the example of [[Howard Keel]] in the film ''[[Show Boat (1951 film)|Show Boat]].''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her analysis aligns with Carroll's conclusion that both sexes must be the subject of the audience's gaze, and that objectification is all-encompassing.

== Impact of Film Portrayals of Women ==
[[File:Female scientist from DAST.png|thumb|Female scientist drawn in a Draw-a-Scientist Test (Chambers, 1983)]]
Studies have shown that female scientists are either underrepresented or misrepresented as film characters.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; As Eva Flicker writes, film has a way of taking social realities and expressing women in [[:Category:Media formats|media formats]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The media formats then are able to influence the audience by creating a mirror of metaphors, myths, opinions and a social memory resulting in stereotypes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The ways that women scientists are portrayed in films have contributed to viewers holding certain stereotypes of scientists. A 2007 [[meta-analysis]] by Jocelyn Steinke of [[Western Michigan University]] and colleagues looked at gender stereotyping by children who have been exposed to images of scientists through films, television shows, and books.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Steinke, Jocelyn, et al. “Assessing Media Influences on Middle School-Aged Children's Perceptions of Women in Science Using the Draw-A-Scientist Test (DAST).” ''Science Communication'', vol. 29, no. 1, 2007, pp. 35–64., doi:10.1177/1075547007306508.&lt;/ref&gt; One study reported on consisted of elementary school students taking the [[Draw-a-Scientist Test|Draw-a-Scientist-Test]], or [[Draw-a-Scientist Test|DAST]]. The results showed that out of the over 4,000 children who participated in the DAST, only 28 girls drew female scientists.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Another study of 1,137 Korean students between the ages of eleven and fifteen found that 74 percent of them drew male scientists, while only 16 percent had depicted female scientists.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The study includes the result that gender stereotypes can be the product of the environment a person possess and can influence how a person views themselves and others around them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As social media platforms are being used more and more each day by [[adolescence]]s, the reinforcement of cultural norms is at an all time high.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steinke|first=Jocelyn|date=September 2005|title=Cultural Representations of Gender and Science- Portrayals of Female Scientists and Engineers in Popular Films|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1075547005278610|journal=DOI: 10.1177/1075547005278610|volume= 27|pages=27–63|via=Science Communication}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even before young women reach adolescence, social media platforms transform their images of women into the different stereotypes of dependent, emotional and less capable beings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A '''rush hour''' ([[American English]], [[British English]]) or '''peak hour''' ([[Australian English]]) is a part of the day during which [[traffic congestion]] on roads and crowding on [[public transport]] is at its highest. Normally, this happens twice every weekday; once in the morning and once in the afternoon or evening, the times during which the most people [[commuting|commute]]. The term is often used for a period of peak congestion that may last for more than one hour.
	
The term is very broad, but often refers specifically to private [[automobile]] transportation [[traffic]], even when there is a large volume of cars on a road but not a large number of people, or if the volume is normal but there is some disruption of speed. By analogy to vehicular traffic, the term '''Internet rush hour''' has been used to describe periods of peak data network usage, resulting in delays and slower delivery of data packets.

==Definition==
[[File:Lascar Beijing Subway at peak time (4496892112).jpg|thumb|Crowded rush-hour [[Beijing Subway]] train]]
[[File:A32 approaching Flemington (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|[[Sydney Trains A set|A set]] on the [[Sydney Trains]] network. All suburban trains on the network have two decks for increased capacity.]]
The name is sometimes a [[misnomer]], as the peak period often lasts more than one hour and the "rush" refers to the volume of traffic, not the speed of its flow. Rush hour may be 6&amp;ndash;10 am (6:00&amp;ndash;10:00) and 4&amp;ndash;8 pm (16:00&amp;ndash;20:00). Peak traffic periods may vary from city to city, from region to region, and seasonally.

The frequency of public transport service is usually higher in the rush hour, and longer [[train]]s or larger vehicles are often used. However, the increase in capacity is often less than the increased number of passengers, due to the limits on available vehicles, staff and, in the case of rail transport, track capacity including [[railway platform|platform]] length. The resulting crowding may force many passengers to stand, and others may be unable to board. If there is inadequate capacity, this can make public transport less attractive, leading to higher car use and partly shifting the congestion to roads.

Transport demand management, such as [[road pricing]] or a [[congestion charge]], is designed to induce people to alter their travel timing to minimize congestion. Similarly, public transport [[fare]]s may be higher during peak periods; this is often presented as an [[off peak]] discount for single fares. [[Season ticket]]s or multi-ride tickets, sold at a discount, are commonly used in rush hours by [[commuter]]s, and may or may not reflect rush hour fare differentials.

Staggered hours have been promoted as a means of spreading demand across a longer time span, for example in [[Rush Hour (1941 film)]] and by the International Labour Office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---travail/documents/publication/wcms_170720.pdf Staggered Hours Schemes] International Labour Office, Geneva&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traffic management by country==

===Australia and New Zealand===
[[File:Peak hour traffic in melbourne.jpg|thumb|Traffic slowing to a crawl on the [[Monash Freeway]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] in peak hour and because of road works]]
In Australia, [[Sydney]], [[Brisbane]] and [[Melbourne]] and in New Zealand, Auckland and Christchurch are usually the most congested cities in the morning 6–9am, and 4:30–7pm. In Melbourne the [[Monash Freeway]], which connects Melbourne's [[suburban sprawl]], to the city is usually heavily congested each morning and evening. In [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Mitchell Freeway]], [[Kwinana Freeway]] and various arterial roads are usually congested between peak hours, making movement between suburbs and the city quite slow.

Efforts to minimise traffic congestion during peak hour vary on a state by state and city by city basis.

In Melbourne, congestion is managed by means including:
* Inbound transit lanes on busy freeways which are limited to motorcycles and other vehicles with more than one occupant during busy periods.
* Free travel on metropolitan trains before 7am. Passengers must exit the system at their destination station before 7am.
* Dedicated bus lanes on major inner city roads such as Hoddle Street.
* Introduction of dedicated bicycle lanes (often by removing vehicle lanes) in the inner city area to encourage cyclists and deter dual-track vehicles.
* Prohibition of parking along busy roads during peak traffic periods to create an extra lane for traffic.

In Sydney, congestion is managed by many means including:
* Buses increase frequency from 4 per hour to 12 per hour on the [[Metrobus (Sydney)|Metrobus]] network, other routes increase limited and express services
* The [[CityRail]] network runs [[Bilevel rail car|double-decker]] [[electric multiple unit]] trains that allowed many more passengers to board the trains compared to the 1950s single-level 'Red Rattlers', and 'Silver Ghosts'.
* Time-of-day ticket prices allow train commuters to board trains before 6&amp;nbsp;am or after 7&amp;nbsp;pm at a cheaper rate on single or day return tickets
* Transit and/or HOV Lanes are installed on many major arterial roads, 
* The ClearWays project, which allows for broken-down trains on the [[Sydney Trains]] network to not affect the running of trains on separate lines due to building bypasses, and loop-backs alongside the existing track
* The [[Light rail in Sydney|Sydney Light Rail]] [[Dulwich Hill Line]], which is the only operational [[light rail]] line in Sydney, increases [[headway]]s during peak hour, providing services up to every eight minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://transportnsw.info/travel-info/ways-to-get-around/light-rail/light-rail-services|title=Light rail services|last=Section|first=Transport for NSW, Customer Experience Division, Customer Service Branch, Customer Information Services|website=transportnsw.info|language=en|access-date=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traffic congestion is managed through the Traffic Management Centre via a network of Closed Circuit TV's, with operators able to change the timing of traffic signals to reduce wait times
* Most major [[motorways]] have the ability for [[Contra-flow]] to allow continuing flow of traffic in case of a major accident
* Older motor ways have been upgraded from two lanes in each direction, to three lanes in each direction
* Motor way toll booths have been replaced with electronic toll systems (Hills M2 was the last to do so on 21 January 2012); time-of-day tolling is in use on the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and Sydney Harbour Tunnel to provide cash incentives for commuters to remain out of the city in peak times.

===Brazil===
In [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]], each vehicle is assigned a certain day of the week in which it cannot travel the roads during rush hour (7–10&amp;nbsp;am and 5–8&amp;nbsp;pm). The day of the week for each vehicle is derived from the last digit in the licence plate number and the rule is enforced by traffic police. This policy is aimed at reducing the number of vehicles on the roads and encouraging the use of buses, subway and the urban train systems.

===Canada===
In [[Toronto]], rush hour typically lasts from 8:00-9:00 in the morning and later from 2:00 PM until at least 7:30-8:00 PM. [[Montreal]], however, has rush hour times from 6:30-8:30 AM and 3:30-6:00 PM.

In the cities of [[Edmonton]] and [[Calgary]], rush hour typically lasts from 7:00-9:00 AM and begins again at 2:30-6:00 PM. The overwhelming traffic causes significant delays on freeways and commuter routes, most notably being [[Anthony Henday Drive]] in Edmonton, where the province has committed to widening, and [[Deerfoot Trail]] in Calgary.

=== China ===

China is home to some of the busiest subway networks in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/features/featurethe-worlds-top-10-busiest-metros-4433827/|title=The world’s top 10 busiest metros - Railway Technology|date=12 November 2014|work=Railway Technology|access-date=16 January 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite aggressive expansion of [[rapid transit]] networks in the past decade,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://usa.streetsblog.org/2018/01/18/chinas-investment-in-subways-puts-the-u-s-to-shame/|title=China’s Investment in Subways Puts the U.S. to Shame|date=18 January 2018|work=Streetsblog USA|access-date=20 January 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; rapid urban population growth has put heavy demand on urban transport. Some systems routinely restrict station entrances and transfer passages to prevent the network from being overwhelmed. For example, 96 subway stations in the [[Beijing Subway]] have entry restrictions at some point of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bj.people.com.cn/n2/2018/0106/c82840-31112000.html|title=北京地铁常态化限流车站达96座 CBD周边车站早晚高峰常限流--北京频道--人民网|last=L_104278|website=bj.people.com.cn|access-date=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Guangzhou Metro]] has 51 stations with passenger flow restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sohu.com/a/215273858_161795|title=广州地铁新增三个站常态化限流|date=8 January 2018|website=www.sohu.com|access-date=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colombia===
In the ''pico y placa'' (peak and license plate) program in [[Bogotá]], drivers of non-commercial automobiles are prevented from driving them during rush hours on certain days of the week. The vehicles barred each day are determined by the last digit of their license plate. The measure is mandatory and those who break it are penalized. The digits banned each day are rotated every year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clasificar.com/guias_clasificar/tramites_cl/archivotrmites/ARTICULO-WEB-PL_INTERNA_MAS_SRV-3557315.html Clasificar.com - Trámites&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===
In the capital city of [[Athens]] the rush hours are usually 7–10am and 4–7pm. During these periods there is congestion in the [[Athens Mass Transit System]], most notably in buses and metro, as well as road traffic. The 6-car trains of [[Athens Metro]] carries almost 1.5 million passengers during a typical week day.

===Japan===
[[File:Rush hour at Shinjuku 02.JPG|thumb|right|Rush hour at [[Shinjuku Station]], [[Tokyo]]. The station is the world's busiest,&lt;ref&gt;[[Shinjuku Station#Daily entries.2Fexits]]&lt;/ref&gt; used by approximately 3.8 million passengers per day in 2008.]]
In Japan, the proportion of rail transportation is high compared with the use of automobiles. Rail transport accounts for 27% of all passenger transport in Japan (other examples: Germany (7.7%), United Kingdom (6.4%), United States (0.6%)).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/environment/pdf_2002/49.pdf Social and Environmental Report, JR East Japan]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Greater Tokyo Area]] and the [[Keihanshin]] metropolitan area there is a dense rail network and frequent service, which accounts for more than half of the passenger transport; most people in the area commute by public transport without using cars.

Railways in the [[Greater Tokyo Area]] are severely congested.  This is gradually being improved by increasing rail capacity and expanding [[Home Liner]] and bi-level Green car (First-class) services. But it is still common on major lines in Tokyo for more than 3,000 passengers to be packed in a 10-car train, and about 100,000 passengers to be transported per hour (usually, the maximum capacity of [[double-track]] [[commuter rail]] in Japan is 10-car trains at two-minute intervals).

In road transport, [[Expressways of Japan]] is operated by on a beneficiaries-pay principle which imposes expensive toll fees, having the effect of reducing road traffic.  [[Electronic toll collection]] (ETC) is widespread and discounts during low-traffic periods has been introduced to disperse traffic over a wider period than the rush hour. [[Road pricing]] is being considered but has not been introduced, partly because the [[Controlled-access highway|expressway]] fee is already very high.

===Netherlands===
For trains in the Netherlands there is an off-peak [[discounts and allowances|discount]] available, giving a 40% discount. Its validity starts at 9am (until 4am the next morning) on weekdays, and all day at weekends and in July and August. In the case of a group of up to four people, all get the discount even if only one has a pass.

Rail passes not requiring an additional ticket come in two versions:  for a fixed route, and for the whole network. Both are mainly used by commuters. No off-peak discount version of these passes is offered since there is insufficient demand; commuters usually cannot avoid the rush hour.

===Philippines===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:EDSA Traffic.jpg|thumb|right|Rush hour at [[EDSA]], [[Metro Manila]]]] --&gt;
Inside [[Metro Manila]], the [[Unified Vehicular Volume Reduction Program]], popularly known as the "number coding scheme", is implemented by the [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority]]. The program stipulates that vehicles are prohibited from plying all roads within the metropolis, depending on the last digit of their license plates and on the day of the week.

The vehicles are banned from 7am to 7pm. Unlike the public vehicles, the private vehicles have a five-hour window exception which runs from 10am to 3pm. However, the cities of [[Makati]] and [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]] do not implement the five-hour window.

This table shows the license plates with numbers ending with its corresponding days:

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:North Ave Station.jpg|thumb|right|Rush hour at [[Manila Metro Rail Transit System]], [[Metro Manila]]]] --&gt;
Exempted from the program are motorcycles, school buses, shuttle buses, ambulances, fire engines, police cars, military vehicles, those carrying a person needing immediate medical attention, and vehicles with [[diplomatic license plates]].

On the other hand, in other places, there are certain policies the municipal or city government are proposing or has implemented for the whole municipality or city.

While most schools are open, peak hours in rapid transit trains on [[Manila Metro Rail Transit System]] and [[Manila Light Rail Transit System]], and in commuter trains on [[Philippine National Railways]] are 6-9am and 4-8pm.

===Singapore===
In Singapore, there is a free travel scheme before 7:45am and 50 cent discount between 7.45am and 8.00am, which applies only if you exit and not enter at the 18 CBD stations. This is an attempt to encourage commuters' travel on the MRT outside the crowded weekday morning peak. [[Electronic Road Pricing]] is intended to discourage driving between 7.30am and 8pm. In addition, employees were given travel incentives through Travel Smart programme. Peak hours are defined as follows: 7:30-9:30am and 5pm-8pm, with different times for terminal stations.

===United Kingdom===
In [[London]], Peak Day Travelcards allow travel at all hours. Off-peak Day Travelcards are 20-50% cheaper but are valid for travel only after 9:30am and on weekends.  This is an attempt to encourage commuters' travel on the [[London Underground]], [[Docklands Light Railway]], buses, and trams outside of the crowded weekday morning peak. There is a similar system on Transport (Bus and [[Tyne and Wear Metro]]) in the [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] area. In [[London]], [[London congestion charge|congestion charges]] are intended to discourage driving 7am–6pm.

In [[Manchester]], the [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]] light rail system offers single, return and 'Metromax' daysaver tickets at a reduced price when they are purchased after 9:30am. This incentive is designed to lure passengers into avoiding the daily crowded conditions at Metrolink stations during rush hour.

For [[16–25 Railcard]] holders, the offer of one-third off ticket prices is valid only after 10am (unless a minimum fare is paid) or weekends. This restriction does not apply in July and August, the main summer holiday season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youngpersons-railcard.co.uk/terms_conditions.htm Young Persons Railcard&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

For other [[concessionary fares on the British railway network#Railcards|Railcards]], other restrictions apply; for example, the [[concessionary fares on the British railway network#Family Railcard|Family Railcard]] and [[Network Railcard]] cannot be used for peak journeys within London and south-east England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.family-railcard.co.uk/terms_conditions.htm Family Railcard&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:Atlanta 75.85.jpg|thumb|right|Traffic in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] during rush hour]]
[[File:US 25 Gratiot Ave 1941.jpg|thumb|left|Heavy rush hour congestion on US&amp;nbsp;25 along Gratiot Avenue in Detroit in the 1940s]]
Efforts to manage transportation demand during rush hour periods vary by state and by metropolitan area.  In some states, [[freeways]] have designated lanes that become [[HOV lane|HOV (High-Occupancy Vehicle aka car-pooling) only]] during rush hours, while open to all vehicles at other times. In others, such as the Massachusetts portion of [[I-93#Northern Expressway|I-93]], travel is permitted in the [[Shoulder (road)|breakdown lane]] during this time. Several states use [[ramp meter]]s to regulate traffic entering freeways during rush hour. Transportation officials in [[Colorado]] and [[Minnesota]] have added value pricing to some urban freeways around [[Denver]], the [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul|Twin Cities]], and [[Seattle]], charging motorists a higher toll during peak periods.

Transit agencies – such as [[Metro-North Railroad|Metro North]] serving [[New York City]], [[WMATA]] serving [[Washington DC]], and [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] serving [[San Francisco]] – often charge riders a higher "peak fare" for travel during the morning and evening rush hour.

Morning rush hour times can range 6–10am in cities like New York. Some New York commuters try to be on the road by at least 6am because traffic gets heavy between 6:30 and 9:30am. Many train commuters leave early to get the best seats on the trains, because by 7am the trains are packed with passengers standing or those who cannot get on. [[Los Angeles]], California has several rush hours, including a midnight rush for night workers. Bus and train service (such as [[Metrolink (Southern California)|Metrolink]]) in Los Angeles are limited and tend to be underused, but their use is increasing. In the [[Chicago]] area people use [[Metra]] Trains, the [[Chicago 'L'|'L']], and buses.

In [[Northeast Ohio]], near [[Cleveland]], morning rush hour is 7–9am, with the peak 7:30–8:30am. Because of Cleveland's compact size, most people can be in [[Downtown Cleveland]] within 10–45 minutes. The [[Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority]] runs buses every half hour and some routes have non-stop freeway buses that run during rush hour.

There is also an afternoon rush hour. For example, in the New York City area, the afternoon rush hour can begin as early as 3pm and last until 7pm. Some people who live in Connecticut but work in New York often do not arrive home until 7pm or later. On the other hand, in a smaller city like Cleveland, the afternoon rush hour takes place in a more literal sense such that heavy traffic congestion typically only occurs between 5 and 6pm. Usually the RTA in Cleveland has an afternoon rush hour schedule like the morning.

[[Image:I-95 SB approaching Girard Avenue-Lehigh Avenue.JPG|thumb|right|Traffic heading into [[Philadelphia]] on [[Interstate 95 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 95]] during the morning rush hour]]
The city of [[Philadelphia]] is known for its very dangerous [[Schuylkill Expressway]], much of which predates the 1956 introduction of the [[Interstate Highway System]]. One of the busiest highways in the country (and state of Pennsylvania) and with the road being highly over capacity, it has become notorious for its chronic congestion, especially during rush hour. Rush hour in Philadelphia is usually as early as 6am, with many in the [[Delaware Valley]] using the Schuylkill to reach [[Center City, Philadelphia|Central Philadelphia]] and some of Philadelphia's western suburbs. The rugged terrain, limited riverfront space covered by the route and narrow spans of bridges passing over the highway have largely stymied later attempts to upgrade or widen the highway. An average 163,000 vehicles use the road daily in [[Philadelphia County]], and an average of 109,000 use the highway in Montgomery County. Its narrow lane and left shoulder configuration, left lane entrances and exits (nicknamed "merge or die"), common construction activity and generally congested conditions have led to many accidents, critical injuries and fatalities, leading to the highway's humorous nickname of the "Surekill Expressway" or in further embellishment, "Surekill Distressway".

[[Boston]] and the larger [[Greater Boston]] region are notorious for traffic congestion due to the region's high population density, outmoded highway system, and economic growth resulting in a high concentration of corporations with large offices located along major expressways and urban loops (including [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]], [[Massachusetts Turnpike|MassPike]], [[Interstate 93|I-93]], and [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|I-495]]). Despite the region's compact nature, inbound traffic becomes very heavy on all expressways as early as 6am on a typical weekday morning, making an inbound drive from the suburbs as long as 75 minutes. Improvements brought by the infamous [[Big Dig]] project temporarily improved expressway traffic within Boston's city limits, but traffic congestion soon returned, also appearing in areas such as the rapidly-developing Seaport District area of [[South Boston]].

Cities such as [[Atlanta]], [[Houston]], [[Austin, TX|Austin]], [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[Honolulu]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Philadelphia]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Washington DC]], to name a few, are ranked as having the worst traffic in the country. Los Angeles also has the highest amount of time spent in congestion, followed by Honolulu and Washington DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10 Most Traffic-Congested Cities In North America|url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/ehmk45jhdg/1-los-angeles/|website=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Third rush hour==
The term "third rush hour" has been used to refer to a period of the midday in which roads in urban and suburban areas become congested due to a large number of people taking [[Break (work)|lunch breaks]] using their vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;Fehr, Stephen. "Third Rush Hour Squeezes Into Midday; Road Congestion at Lunchtime Rivals Morning, Evening Commutes". ''[[The Washington Post]]''. August 12, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United States Congress. Committee on the District of Columbia. (1977). ''Hearings, reports and prints of the House Committee on the District of Columbia''&lt;/ref&gt; These motorists often frequent restaurants and fast food locations, where vehicles crowding the entrances cause traffic congestion.&lt;ref&gt;Langdon, Philip. (1994). ''A better place to live: reshaping the American suburb.'' University of Massachusetts. p. 177. {{ISBN|978-0-87023-914-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Active retirees, who travel by automobile to engage in many midday activities, also contribute to the midday rush hour. Areas which have large school-age populations may also experience added congestion due to the large number of school buses and [[kiss-and-ride]] traffic that flood the roads after lunch, but before the evening rush hour. In many European countries (e.g. Germany, Austria, Hungary) the schools are only half-day and many people work only half-time too. This causes a third rush hour around 12:30–2pm, which diverts some traffic from the evening rush hour, thus leaving the morning rush hour the most intense period of the day.

Another usage of "third rush hour" can be to describe congestion later at night (generally between 10-11pm and 2-3am the next morning, particularly on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays) of people returning home from nights spent out at restaurants, bars, nightclubs, casinos, concerts, amusement parks, movie theaters, and sporting events. At other times (such as evenings and weekends), additional periods of congestion can be the result of various special events, such as sports competitions, festivals, or religious services. Out-of-the-ordinary congestion can be the result of an accident, construction, long holiday weekends, or inclement weather.

In [[logic]], the '''scope''' of a [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]] or a quantification is the range in the [[Well-formed formula#Predicate logic|formula]] where the quantifier "engages in". It is put right after the quantifier, often in parentheses. Some authors describe this as including the variable put right after the forall or exists symbol. In the formula {{math|∀''xP''}}, for example, {{math|''P''}} (or {{math|''xP''}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bell|first1=John L.|authorlink1=John Lane Bell|last2=Machover|first2=Moshé|authorlink2=Moshé Machover|title=A Course in Mathematical Logic|date=April 15, 2007|publisher=Elsevier Science Ltd|isbn=978-0-7204-2844-5|page=17|chapter=Chapter 1. Beginning mathematical logic}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the scope of the quantifier {{math|∀''x''}} (or {{math|∀}}).

A variable in the formula is [[free variable|free]], if and only if it does not occur in the scope of any quantifier for that variable. A [[term (logic)|term]] is free for a variable in the formula (i.e. free to substitute that variable that occurs free), if and only if that variable does not occur free in the scope of any quantifier for any variable in the term.

Their macroscopic behavior thus displays the spatial and/or temporal [[scale invariance|scale-invariance]] characteristic of the [[critical point (physics)|critical point]] of a [[phase transition]], but without the need to tune control parameters to a precise value, because the system, effectively, tunes itself as it evolves towards criticality.

SOC is typically observed in slowly driven [[non-equilibrium thermodynamics|non-equilibrium]] systems with extended [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] and a high level of [[nonlinearity]].  Many individual examples have been identified since BTW's original paper, but to date there is no known set of general characteristics that ''guarantee'' a system will display SOC.

== Overview ==

Self-organized criticality is one of a number of important discoveries made in [[statistical physics]] and related fields over the latter half of the 20th century, discoveries which relate particularly to the study of [[complexity]] in nature.  For example, the study of [[cellular automata]], from the early discoveries of [[Stanislaw Ulam]] and [[John von Neumann]] through to [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]]'s [[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]] and the extensive work of [[Stephen Wolfram]], made it clear that complexity could be generated as an [[emergence|emergent]] feature of extended systems with simple local interactions.  Over a similar period of time, [[Benoît Mandelbrot]]'s large body of work on [[fractals]] showed that much complexity in nature could be described by certain ubiquitous mathematical laws, while the extensive study of [[phase transition]]s carried out in the 1960s and 1970s showed how [[scale invariance|scale invariant]] phenomena such as [[fractals]] and [[power law]]s emerged at the [[critical point (physics)|critical point]] between phases.
However, the term Self-Organized Criticality was firstly introduced by [[Per Bak|Bak]], [[Chao Tang|Tang]] and [[Kurt Wiesenfeld|Wiesenfeld]]'s 1987 paper which clearly linked together these factors: a simple [[cellular automaton]] was shown to produce several characteristic features observed in natural complexity ([[fractal]] geometry, [[pink noise|pink (1/f) noise]] and [[power law]]s) in a way that could be linked to [[critical point (physics)|critical-point phenomena]]. Crucially, however, the paper emphasized that the complexity observed emerged in a robust manner that did not depend on finely tuned details of the system: variable parameters in the model could be changed widely without affecting the emergence of critical behavior (hence, ''[[self-organized]]'' criticality). Thus, the key result of BTW's paper was its discovery of a mechanism by which the emergence of complexity from simple local interactions could be ''spontaneous''&amp;mdash;and therefore plausible as a source of natural complexity&amp;mdash;rather than something that was only possible in the lab (or lab computer) where it was possible to tune control parameters to precise values. The publication of this research sparked considerable interest from both theoreticians and experimentalists, and important papers on the subject are among the most cited papers in the scientific literature.

Due to BTW's metaphorical visualization of their model as a "[[Bak–Tang–Wiesenfeld sandpile|sandpile]]" on which new sand grains were being slowly sprinkled to cause "avalanches", much of the initial experimental work tended to focus on examining real avalanches in [[granular matter]], the most famous and extensive such study probably being the Oslo ricepile experiment{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}.  Other experiments include those carried out on magnetic-domain patterns, the [[Barkhausen effect]] and vortices in [[superconductors]].  Early theoretical work included the development of a variety of alternative SOC-generating dynamics distinct from the BTW model, attempts to prove model properties analytically (including calculating the [[critical exponent]]s&lt;ref name=Tang1988a&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;), and examination of the necessary conditions for SOC to emerge. One of the important issues for the latter investigation was whether [[conservation of energy]] was required in the local dynamical exchanges of models: the answer in general is no, but with (minor) reservations, as some exchange dynamics (such as those of BTW) do require local conservation at least on average.  In the long term, key theoretical issues yet to be resolved include the calculation of the possible [[universality class]]es of SOC behavior and the question of whether it is possible to derive a general rule for determining if an arbitrary [[algorithm]] displays SOC.

Alongside these largely lab-based approaches, many other investigations have centered around large-scale natural or social systems that are known (or suspected) to display [[scale invariance|scale-invariant]] behavior.  Although these approaches were not always welcomed (at least initially) by specialists in the subjects examined, SOC has nevertheless become established as a strong candidate for explaining a number of natural phenomena, including: [[earthquakes]] (which, long before SOC was discovered, were known as a source of scale-invariant behavior such as the [[Gutenberg–Richter law]] describing the statistical distribution of earthquake sizes and the [[Aftershock|Omori law]] describing the frequency of aftershocks, and where models that displayed SOC were proposed and analyzed prior to the BTW 87 paper;&lt;ref name=TurcotteSmalleySolla85&gt;

These "applied" investigations of SOC have included both attempts at modelling (either developing new models or adapting existing ones to the specifics of a given natural system) and extensive data analysis to determine the existence and/or characteristics of natural scaling laws.

In addition, SOC has been linked to computation. Recently, it has been found that the avalanches from an SOC process, like the BTW model, make effective patterns in a random search for optimal solutions on graphs.&lt;ref name=Hoffmann2018&gt;

An example of such an optimization problem is [[graph coloring]]. The SOC process apparently helps the optimization from getting stuck in a [[local optimum]] without the use of any annealing scheme, as suggested by previous work on [[extremal optimization]].

The recent excitement generated by [[scale-free networks]] has raised some interesting new questions for SOC-related research: a number of different SOC models have been shown to generate such networks as an emergent phenomenon, as opposed to the simpler models proposed by network researchers where the network tends to be assumed to exist independently of any physical space or dynamics. While many single phenomena have been shown to exhibit scale free properties over narrow ranges, by far the most extensive data concern the solvent-accessible surface areas of globular proteins, plotted for modular segments centered on a specific amino acid, against lengths L, with 9 &lt;= L &lt;= 35.&lt;ref name=Moret2007&gt;

Because this fractal linearity holds for all 20 amino acids over the same range, it exists independently of any model.  It can be regarded as the basic mechanism of life.

Despite the considerable interest and research output generated from the SOC hypothesis there remains no general agreement with regards to its mathematical mechanisms.  Bak Tang and Wiesenfeld based their hypothesis on the behavior of their sandpile model.&lt;ref name=Bak1987/&gt;  However, this model was subsequently shown to actually generate 1/f&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; noise rather than 1/f noise.&lt;ref name=Jensen1989&gt;

The '''Space Shuttle recovery convoy''' was a fleet of ground vehicles, many of which were specially-designed for their purpose, staged at the landing site of a [[Space Shuttle]] orbiter which assist the crew in egress and safe the vehicle and its payload after landing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LANDING POSTLANDING AND SRB RETRIEVAL OPERATIONS|url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/stsover-landing.html|publisher=NASA KSC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Orbiter Processing From Landing To Launch|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/pdf/167429main_OrbiterProcessing06.pdf|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some vehicles and equipment which were very specific to the shuttle program were retired and either sold at auction or transferred to museums for public display.  The majority of convoy vehicles were stored in buildings near the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NASA|work=American Trucker|issue=Season 1, Episode 13|publisher=Speed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable vehicles==
* [[File:NASA Convoy Command vehicle.jpg|thumbnail|right|post landing operations are coordinated from the 40-foot Convoy Command Vehicle]] '''Command Vehicle''' - commissioned June 27, 2002 the {{convert|40|ft}} long Convoy Command Vehicle replaced the previous 15-year-old vehicle. The NASA Convoy Commander (NCC) directs personnel in the recovery convoy from this vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Liston|first1=Elaine|last2=Elliott|first2=Dawn|title=History of the Shuttle Landing Facility|url=http://commons.erau.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1055&amp;context=space-congress-proceedings}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''SCAPE Trailer'''. Self-Contained Atmospheric Protection Ensemble (SCAPE), vehicle, parked at a midfield location during landing, contains the equipment necessary to support recovery including recovery crew SCAPE suits, liquid air packs, and a crew who assisted recovery personnel in suiting-up in protective clothing.
* '''Vapor Dispersal Unit'''. The Vapor Dispersal Unit is a mobile wind-making machine able to produce a directed wind stream of up to {{convert|45|mph}}. It is an adaptation of a standard 14-ft. agricultural [[wind machine]] designed to protect fragile agricultural crops from frost damage or freezing. It is used by the recovery team to blow away toxic or explosive gases that may occur in or around the orbiter after landing. The fan can move 200,000 cubic feet of air a minute.
* '''Coolant Umbilical Access.''' This apparatus is a stair and platform unit mounted on a truck bed which permits access to the aft port side of the orbiter where ground support crews attach coolant lines from the Orbiter Coolant Transporter.
* '''Orbiter Coolant Transporters.''' This unit is a tractor-trailer carrying a refrigeration unit that provides [[Freon 114]] through the orbiter's T-O umbilical into its cooling system.
* '''Purge Umbilical Access Vehicle'''. This vehicle is similar to the Coolant Umbilical Access Vehicle in that it has an access stairway and platform allowing crews to attach purge air lines to the orbiter on its aft starboard side.
* '''Orbiter Purge Transporter'''. This vehicle is a tractor-trailer which carries an air conditioning unit powered by two 300 KW, 60&amp;nbsp;Hz electric generators. The unit blows cool or dehumidified air into the payload bay to remove possible residual explosive or toxic gases.
* '''Crew Hatch Access Vehicle'''. The Crew Hatch Access Vehicle consisted of a stairway and platform on which is located a white room equipped with special orbiter interface seals. It contains pressurized filtered air to keep toxic or explosive gases, airborne dust or other contaminants from getting into the orbiter during crew egress. The vehicle was transferred to the [[Wings of Dreams Aviation Museum]] &lt;ref name=WoaD&gt;{{cite web|title=Space Shuttle Program Artifact Collection|url=http://www.wingsofdreams.org/collections/space-program-artifacts|publisher=Wings of a Dream Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar vehicle intended for use for shuttle operations at Vandenberg Air Force Base is in storage at Edwards Air Force Based pending display at the [[Air Force Test Center Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Space Shuttle Crew Transport Vehicle|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/multimedia/imagegallery/Shuttle-Misc/ED13-0020-06.html#.VWNiyllVhBc|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[File:Crew Transport Vehicle at Baseline Data Collection Facility.jpg|thumbnail|right|The shuttle Crew Transport Vehicle – a converted people-mover]] [[Mobile lounge#NASA Crew Transport Vehicles|Crew Transporter Vehicle]] placed aft of the Crew Hatch Access Vehicle, after orbiter egress, astronauts would step into this vehicle similar to mobile lounges on a scissor lift used at airports where flight surgeons would perform initial checks.  The vehicle was intended to take astronauts directly to a 2nd floor entry in the Operations and Checkout Building in the KSC industrial area but in later missions, astronauts would exit the vehicle into the waiting astrovan for transport. The vehicle previously at the Kennedy Space Center was transferred to the [[Wings of Dreams Aviation Museum]] &lt;ref name=WoaD/&gt;
* [[Astronaut Transfer Van]]. As its name implies, this van was used for the 20-minute ride transferring the flight crew on launch rehearsals and to the launch pad at the beginning of the mission and from the landing area at mission end. It is a modified recreational vehicle in which the crew can remove their flight suits and be examined by a physician while en route.  Two astrovans were used during the space shuttle program.  A smaller van used during the Apollo era was used for the first shuttle mission which included only two astronauts.  A larger [[Airstream]] motorhome carried the larger shuttle crews of up to seven.  Both vehicles are on display at the [[Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex]], the smaller in the Saturn V center and the larger beneath the Atlantis orbiter it served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Catching a Ride to Destiny|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/flyout/astrovan.html|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Helium Tube Bank'''. This specialized vehicle is a trailer on which is mounted a 12-tube bank container which provides helium to purge hydrogen from the orbiter's main engines and lines. The bank contains {{convert|85000|cuft}} of helium at {{convert|6000|psi}}.
* '''Orbiter Tow Vehicle.''' This unit is very much like the typical towing units used for large aircraft. However, it was equipped with a special towing bar designed specifically for the orbiter. It was used to move the orbiter from the landing facility to the OPF. It also is used for moving the orbiter from the OPF to the VAB.
* '''Mobile Ground Power Unit.''' The final special vehicle for orbiter post-landing operations is the Mobile Ground Power Unit which provides power to the orbiter if the fuel cells have to be shut down. It can deliver a nominal load of 10 &lt;what unit?&gt; of direct power to the orbiter.

{{Multiplex techniques}}
[[Image:spatial multiplexing.jpg|thumb|right|Spatial Multiplexing]]
[[Image:spatial multiplexing2.jpg|thumb|right|2xSMX or STC+2xMRC]]
'''Spatial multiplexing''' (often abbreviated '''SM''' or '''SMX'''&lt;!--cf. [[WiMAX MIMO#Spatial Multiplexing]]--&gt;) is a transmission technique in [[Multiple-input multiple-output communications|MIMO]] [[wireless communication]], [[Fibre-optic communication]] and other communications technologies to transmit independent and separately encoded data signals, known as "''streams''". Therefore, the space dimension is reused, or [[Multiplexing|multiplex]]ed, more than one time. 

=Wireless communications=
If the transmitter is equipped with &lt;math&gt;N_t&lt;/math&gt; antennas and the receiver has &lt;math&gt;N_r&lt;/math&gt; antennas, the maximum spatial multiplexing order (the number of streams) is,

:&lt;math&gt;N_s=\min(N_t, N_r)\!&lt;/math&gt;

if a linear receiver is used. This means that &lt;math&gt;N_s&lt;/math&gt; streams can be transmitted in parallel, ideally leading to an &lt;math&gt;N_s&lt;/math&gt; increase of the [[spectral efficiency]] (the number of bits per second per Hz that can be transmitted over the wireless channel). The practical multiplexing gain can be limited by [[Spatial Correlation|spatial correlation]], which means that some of the parallel streams may have very weak channel gains.

==Encoding==
=== Open-loop approach ===

In an [[open loop (wireless)|open-loop]] [[MIMO]] system with &lt;math&gt;N_t&lt;/math&gt; transmitter antennas and &lt;math&gt;N_r&lt;/math&gt; receiver antennas, the input-output relationship can be described as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{Hx}+\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt;		
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{N_t}]^T&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;N_t\times 1&lt;/math&gt; vector of transmitted symbols, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y,n}&lt;/math&gt;  are the &lt;math&gt;N_r \times 1&lt;/math&gt;  vectors of received symbols and noise respectively and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H}&lt;/math&gt; is the  &lt;math&gt;N_r \times N_t&lt;/math&gt;  matrix of channel coefficients. An often encountered problem in open loop spatial multiplexing is to guard against instance of high channel correlation and strong power imbalances between the multiple streams. One such extension which is being considered for [[DVB-H#DVB-NGH|DVB-NGH]]  systems is the so-called ''enhanced Spatial Multiplexing (eSM)'' scheme.

===Closed-loop approach===
A closed-loop MIMO system utilizes Channel State Information (CSI) at the transmitter. In most cases, only partial CSI is available at the transmitter because of the limitations of the feedback channel. In a closed-loop MIMO system the input-output relationship with a closed-loop approach can be described as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{HWs}+\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt;		
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s} = [s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_{N_s}]^T&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;N_s\times 1&lt;/math&gt; vector of transmitted symbols, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y,n}&lt;/math&gt; are the &lt;math&gt;N_r\times 1&lt;/math&gt; vectors of received symbols and noise respectively, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H}&lt;/math&gt; is the  &lt;math&gt;N_r\times N_t&lt;/math&gt;  matrix of channel coefficients and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{W}&lt;/math&gt; is the  &lt;math&gt;N_t\times N_s&lt;/math&gt; linear [[precoding]] matrix. 

A precoding matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{W}&lt;/math&gt; is used to precode the symbols in the vector to enhance the performance. The column dimension &lt;math&gt;N_s&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{W}&lt;/math&gt; can be selected smaller than &lt;math&gt;N_t&lt;/math&gt; which is useful if the system requires &lt;math&gt;N_s (\neq N_t)&lt;/math&gt; streams because of several reasons. Examples of the reasons are as follows: either the rank of the MIMO channel or the number of receiver antennas is smaller than the number of transmit antennas.

The book focuses on what is called Western science, prominently covering [[History of science in classical antiquity|Greek, Roman]], [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|Islamic]] and [[European science in the Middle Ages|Mediaeval European science]], while the 2007 second edition expands on precursors to Greek science, such as Mesopotamian and Egyptian science, and on Islamic science.&lt;ref name="press.uchicago.edu"&gt;[http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/B/bo5550077.html "''The Beginnings of Western Science'' by David C.

Wallace.&lt;ref&gt;William A. Wallace, "David C.

Vol. 69, No. 4 (October 1994), 1211.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Beginnings of Western Science'' focuses on the theoretical dimension of classical and mediaeval science, giving less attention to technology and scientific craft.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Lindberg, ''The Beginnings of Western Science: The European Scientific Tradition in Philosophical, Religious, and Institutional Context, 600 B.C. to A.D. 1450'', 2007 edition, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Angela Smith's review"&gt;Angela Smith, [https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=24125 "An Origin Story"], ''H-Net'', May 2009. Retrieved 4 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Lindberg defends a moderate view on the [[continuity thesis]], accepting continuity between early modern science and mediaeval antecedents but also identifying a scientific revolution in the cosmology and metaphysics behind science.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Lindberg, ''The Beginnings of Western Science: The European Scientific Tradition in Philosophical, Religious, and Institutional Context, 600 B.C. to A.D. 1450'', 2007 edition, 359, 364-367.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vivian Nutton]] states that Lindberg emphasizes discontinuities over continuities between mediaeval and renaissance science.&lt;ref name = "Vivian Nutton's review p81"&gt;Vivian Nutton, "David C.

The European Scientific Tradition in Philosophical, Religious, and Institutional Context, 600 B.C. to A.D. 1450.", ''The British Journal for the History of Science'', Vol. 26, No. 1 (March 1993), 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has found wide acclaim and is considered a good general introduction to the history of science in the West before the [[Renaissance]].

== Contents ==
The expanded edition begins with debates over definitions of science. Next, possible precursors to science are treated in the forms of knowledge prehistoric societies and theories about the notions of truth that would apply in such cultures. The section about Egyptian and Babylonian science starts with the differences in their types of arithmetic. Lindberg states that the Babylonian notation is superior because of its greater parsimony. Babylonian astrology, with the important development of [[horoscopic astrology]], is mentioned as a major contribution of Babylonian civilization. Egyptian and Babylonian medicine are described as systemizations of diagnoses, which often included non-naturalistic formulations.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Lindberg, ''The Beginnings of Western Science: The European Scientific Tradition in Philosophical, Religious, and Institutional Context, 600 B.C. to A.D. 1450'', 2007 edition, 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek science first covers the philosophies of the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratics]], [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], after which the narrative continues with the Hellenistic philosophical schools, the [[Plato's Academy|Academy]], the [[Lyceum]], the [[Epicureans]] and the [[Stoics]]. Major figures in mathematics are [[Euclid]] and [[Archimedes]], and [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] and [[Claudius Ptolemy]] (discussed as part of Hellenistic astronomy) in astronomy.

== Themes ==
A central theme underlying the narrative of ''The Beginnings of Western Science'' is that classical and mediaeval science must be treated relative to their context, according to their own standards.&lt;ref name="Vivian Nutton's review p81"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "F Jamil Ragep's review p383"&gt;F. Jamil Ragep, "David C. Lindberg. The Beginnings of Western Science: The European Scientific Tradition in Philosophical, Religious, and Institutional Context, Prehistory to A.D. 1450." in ''Isis'', Vol. 10, No. 2 (June 2009), 383.&lt;/ref&gt; F. Jamil Ragep also states that the rejection of [[Presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentism]] is an important theme in the book.&lt;ref name="F Jamil Ragep's review p383"/&gt;

Several reviewers commented on the book's take on [[science and religion]]. Vivian Nutton mentions that one point that Lindberg makes is that religious traditions have influenced the development of science.&lt;ref name="Vivian Nutton's review p81"/&gt; Jamil Ragep notes that the [[warfare thesis]] is rejected.&lt;ref name="F Jamil Ragep's review p383"/&gt;

Methodology was another topic that commenters singled out. Angela Smith identifies the discussion of the methodological importance of mathematics and experimentation in science as a recurrent theme throughout ''The Beginnings of Western Science''.&lt;ref name="Angela Smith's review"/&gt; Jamil Ragep says that the notion that Aristotelian methodology was a positive contribution to science is tacitly accepted in the book.&lt;ref name="F Jamil Ragep's review p383"/&gt;

According to Smith, other themes in ''The Beginnings of Western Science'' are problems with definitions of science and "the philosophical implications of different concepts of change".&lt;ref name="Angela Smith's review"/&gt; Nutton maintains that Lindberg portrays science as a tradition that "may be no less difficult" to maintain than to create.&lt;ref name="Vivian Nutton's review p81"/&gt;

== Reception ==
[[Peter Harrison (historian)|Peter Harrison]] called the first edition "[t]he best general introduction to classical and medieval science."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harrison, "Handmaiden Metaphor", in Heidi A. Campbell and Heather Looy (eds.) , ''A Science and Religion Primer'', 118.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vivian Nutton]] considered the work "solid and accurate", but lamented Lindberg's traditional choice of subject matter. He besides thought that his limited inclusion of late mediaeval scientists, particularly in the field of medicine, hurt his argument to stress discontinuity with the renaissance era.&lt;ref&gt;Vivian Nutton, "David C. Lindberg: The Beginnings of Western Science. The European Scientific Tradition in Philosophical, Religious, and Institutional Context, 600 B.C. to A.D. 1450.", ''The British Journal for the History of Science'', Vol. 26, No. 1 (March 1993), 81-82.&lt;/ref&gt; William A. Wallace considered ''The Beginnings of Western Science'' "most welcome", but also stated he had reservations about the omission of several details he considered necessary for an introduction and criticized Lindberg's decision to comment on the continuity thesis while his book doesn't include [[renaissance science]].&lt;ref&gt;William A. Wallace, "David C. Lindberg, The Beginnings of Western Science: The European Scientific Tradition in Philosophical, Religious, and Institutional Context, 600 B.C. to A.D. 1450.", ''Speculum'', Vol. 69, No. 4 (October 1994), 1213.&lt;/ref&gt; F. Jamil Ragep criticizes the book's first edition as [[Eurocentric]]. He notes that it claimed that Islamic science declined in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries and hardly anything remained by the fifteenth century. The book also didn't emphasize the role of Babylonian science, especially in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;F. Jamil Ragep, "David C. Lindberg. The Beginnings of Western Science: The European Scientific Tradition in Philosophical, Religious, and Institutional Context, Prehistory to A.D. 1450." in ''Isis'', Vol. 10, No. 2 (June 2009), 383-384.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard C. Dales also thought that Lindberg undervalued Babylonian, but also Egyptian science. He in addition critiques Lindberg's description of twelfth-century science until the [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translation movement]]. His overall verdict is nonetheless that ''The Beginnings of Western Science'' is a "triumph" and "an authoritative account of Western science from its beginnings to the height of medieval scientific achievement".&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. Dales , "David C. Lindberg. The Beginnings of Western Science: The European Scientific Tradition in Philosophical, Religious, and Institutional Context, 600 B.C. to A.D. 1450.", in ''The American Historical Review'', Vol. 98, No. 3 (June 1993), 823.&lt;/ref&gt;

Angela Smith considered the second edition of ''The Beginnings of Western Science'' a substantial success and thought it "a fundamental and reliable resource for many years to come".&lt;ref name="Angela Smith's review"/&gt; She appraised the improvements in the treatment of Islamic science to include recent scholarship in particular. Jamil Ragep calls it "a fine book, the culmination of a century of distinguished research on premodern European science" but also contends that the second edition still has a Eurocentric bias. He argues for inclusion of Chinese, Indian and Central-Asian influences on Western science.&lt;ref&gt;F. Jamil Ragep, "David C. Lindberg. The Beginnings of Western Science: The European Scientific Tradition in Philosophical, Religious, and Institutional Context, Prehistory to A.D. 1450." in ''Isis'', Vol. 10, No. 2 (June 2009), 384.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Why Beauty Is Truth: A History of Symmetry''''' is a 2007 book by [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]].

==Overview==
Following the life and work of famous mathematicians from antiquity to the present, Stewart traces mathematics' developing handling of the concept of [[symmetry]]. One of the very first takeaways, established in the preface of this book, is that it dispels the idea of the origins of [[symmetry]] in geometry, as is often the first context in which the term is introduced. This book, through its chapters, establishes its origins in [[algebra]], more specifically [[group theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Why-Beauty-Truth-History-Symmetry/dp/046508236X/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;sr=8-1&amp;qid=1433261343|publisher=[[amazon.com]]|title =Why Beauty Is Truth: The History of Symmetry by Ian Stewart (Author) |accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/148614.Why_Beauty_Is_Truth?from_search=true&amp;search_version=service|publisher=[[goodreads.com]]|title=Why Beauty Is Truth: The History of Symmetry by Ian Stewart|accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==
The topics covered are:

* Chapter 1: The Scribes of Babylon
:: The earliest records of solving [[quadratic equation]]s.
* Chapter 2: The Household Name
:: [[Euclid]]'s influence on [[geometry]] in general and on [[regular polygon]]s in particular.
* Chapter 3: The Persian Poet
:: [[Omar Khayyám]]'s solution to the [[cubic equation]], which makes use of [[conic section]]s.
* Chapter 4: The Gambling Scholar
:: [[Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia]] found the first algebraic solutions to special cubic equations.
:: [[Gerolamo Cardano]] used [[algebra]] to solve the cubic and [[quartic equation]].
* Chapter 5: The Cunning Fox
:: [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] proved that the [[Constructible polygon|regular 17-gon can be constructed]] using only [[Compass and straightedge constructions|compass and straightedge]], and [[Field extension|extended the field]] of [[real number]]s to the [[complex number]]s.
* Chapter 6: The Frustrated Doctor and the Sickly Genius
:: [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] understood that all approaches to solve algebraic equations could be understood as symmetry transformations of such equations.
:: [[Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde]] used [[symmetric function]]s as an [[ansatz]] to solve general algebraic equations, which would lead to the development of [[Galois theory]].
:: [[Paolo Ruffini]] developed a first (incomplete) proof that the [[quintic equation]] cannot be solved analytically.
:: [[Niels Abel]] formalized [[group theory]], the indispensable tool in describing symmetries.
* Chapter 7: The Luckless Revolutionary
:: [[Évariste Galois]] laid the foundations to what is today known as [[Galois theory]].
* Chapter 8: The Mediocre Engineer and the Transcendent Professor
:: [[Pierre Laurent Wantzel]] proved that it is impossible to [[doubling the cube|double the cube]], [[trisecting the angle|trisect the angle]], and [[Constructible polygon|constructing a regular polygon]] using only [[Compass and straightedge constructions|compass and straightedge]].
:: [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]] proved the [[Transcendental number|transcendence]] of [[Pi]], and by implication that it is impossible to [[Squaring the circle|square the circle]] using only [[compass]] and [[straightedge]].
* Chapter 9: The Drunken Vandal
:: [[William Rowan Hamilton]] [[Field extension|extended the field]] of [[complex number]]s to the [[quaternion]]s.
* Chapter 10: The Would-Be Soldier and the Weakly Bookworm
:: [[Marius Sophus Lie]] formalized [[Lie group]]s and [[Lie algebra]]s.
:: [[Wilhelm Killing]] classified all [[simple Lie algebra]]s (in what Ian Stewart calls the "greatest mathematical paper of all time")
* Chapter 11: The Clerk from the Patent Office
:: [[Albert Einstein]] developed in his [[General Relativity|theory of general relativity]] a symmetry of space and time.
* Chapter 12: A Quantum Quintet
:: [[Max Planck]], [[Erwin Schrödinger]], [[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Paul Dirac]], [[Eugene Wigner]] were major contributors to the early development of [[Quantum Mechanics]]. Wigner introduced symmetries into quantum physics.
* Chapter 13: The Five-Dimensional Man
:: An overview of attempts to unify the [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental forces]], and the role of symmetry in that endeavor.
* Chapter 14: The Political Journalist
:: [[Edward Witten]] and [[Superstring theory]]
* Chapter 15: A Muddle of Mathematicians
:: Here, connections between [[field extension]]s of [[real number]]s ([[complex number]]s, [[quaternion]]s, [[octonion]]s), the [[Simple Lie algebra#Exceptional cases|exceptional simple Lie algebras]] detected by Killing ([[G2 (mathematics)|G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[F4 (mathematics)|F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[E6 (mathematics)|E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[E7 (mathematics)|E&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[E8 (mathematics)|E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]]), and symmetries occurring in string theory are explored.
* Chapter 16: Seekers after Truth and Beauty
:: Closes the book by contemplating the role of mathematics in physical research.

==Review==
{{quote|What makes the book a compulsive read is that Stewart combines the advances in mathematics with the stories of their discoverers, who could be described by the author's preferred collective expression as "a muddle of mathematicians". These compulsive characters are almost archetypal: the romantic, doomed Frenchman dying in a duel over a woman (Evariste Galois); a brilliant yet impoverished academic (Niels Henrik Abel); and, my favourite, a drunken Irishman who "set out to invent an algebra of three dimensions but realised, in a flash of intuition that caused him to vandalise a bridge, that he would have to settle for four dimensions instead" (William Rowan Hamilton). Driven by the compulsion to solve mathematical riddles, they are united by similar qualities: perseverance, obsession, and the kind of genius that seems inevitably to lead to tragedy on an epic scale. Their experiences add a very human dimension to the story.}}
