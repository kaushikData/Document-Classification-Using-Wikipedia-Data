'''Abbassia''' ({{lang-ar|العباسية}} &amp;nbsp;{{IPA-arz|elʕæb.bæˈsej.jæ}}) is a neighbourhood in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]. The [[Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral, Cairo]] is located in Abbassia.&lt;ref name="Cathedral" /&gt; The medical faculty of [[Ain Shams University]] and its affiliate hospital units are located in Abbassia.&lt;ref name="Ain Shams University address"&gt;{{cite web|title=Address|url=http://www.asu.edu.eg/article.php?action=show&amp;id=289#.WDMnR7IrJxA|website=ASU|accessdate=21 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126064833/http://www.asu.edu.eg/article.php?action=show&amp;id=289#.WDMnR7IrJxA|archivedate=26 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Abbassia (Cairo Metro)|Abbassia metro station]] is located here, as well.

== History ==
In 1865 an [[observatory]], principally for meteorological work, was founded at Abbassia, by the Khedive [[Isma'il Pasha]], and maintained continuously there for nearly forty years. The building lay on the boundary between the cultivated [[Nile Delta]] and the desert but then with urban encroachment, it was decided in 1904, to move the meteorological work to [[Helwan]].&lt;ref name="ADS"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Keeling |first1=B. F. E. |title=Helwan Magnetic Observatory, Egypt |url=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/?#abs/1907JGR....12..149K }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Observatory at Abbassia was an empty monument until 1952.&lt;ref name="Observatory"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keeling|first1=Bertram Francis Eardley|title=The Climate of Abbassia, Near Cairo|date=1907|publisher=National printing Department|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gNo4AQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Abbassia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTz-_A1JXQAhUI6yYKHSJJA4sQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Abbassia&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Helwan Observatory - UNESCO|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5574/|website=UNESCO|accessdate=7 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107160639/http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5574/|archivedate=7 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abbassia and the nearby region, saw heavy rainfall during a period of time [[geological]] researchers call the [[Abbassia Pluvial|Pluvial Abbassia]]. During this period, red, green and purple rocks or [[gravel]] became distributed all along the valley and Delta regions of the Nile. Gravel beds were formed, including a famous gravel bed at Abbassia. Photographed and described in 1926 by [[Paul Bovier-Lapierre]], these gravel beds were as thick as 33 feet (10 metres/meters) in some areas.&lt;ref name="Gravel"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Said|first1=Rushdi|title=The Geological Evolution of the River Nile|date=December 6, 2002|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781461258414|page=59|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8OKPBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=abbassia+gravel&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKiriq2JXQAhVC6yYKHf7OBq0Q6AEIITAB#v=onepage&amp;q=abbassia%20gravel&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Second World War]], during which Egypt was the scene of heavy fighting, the [[United Kingdom]] located its [[Royal Armoured Corps]] School in Abbassia.&lt;ref name="BritishIntelligence"&gt;{{cite book|last1=West|first1=Nigel|title=The A to Z of British Intelligence|date=September 2, 2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810870284|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zYAXAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=abbassia+world+war+II&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjz7Njv45XQAhXF6CYKHScsBREQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=abbassia%20world%20war%20II&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1941, an [[Regia Aeronautica|Italian Air Force]] plane bombed a [[British Army]] [[depot]] in Abbassia.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Overy, (Penguin, 2013) The Bombers And The Bombed: Allied Air War Over Europe, 1940-1945, p. 333&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral|The Cathedral of Saint Mark in Abbassia]] was the site of the 2012 funeral for [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria]], attracting more than two million mourners from around the world.&lt;ref name=Cathedral&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tovrov|first1=Daniel|title=Egypt: Three Dead After Vigil For Coptic Christian Pope|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/egypt-three-dead-after-vigil-coptic-christian-pope-426964|accessdate=31 October 2015|agency=International Business Times|date=March 19, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105001636/http://www.ibtimes.com/egypt-three-dead-after-vigil-coptic-christian-pope-426964|archivedate=5 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A queue of over one kilometer in length formed to view the body of the pope, and as people pushed to get close, three people were crushed to death and 137 were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=AsiaNews|title=Pope sends message for Shenouda III's death, huge crowds form to see his body|url=http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Pope-sends-message-for-Shenouda-III's-death,-huge-crowds-form-to-see-his-body-24274.html|accessdate=31 October 2015|agency=AsiaNews Italy|publisher=AsiaNews|date=March 19, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015105153/http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Pope-sends-message-for-Shenouda-III%27s-death%2C-huge-crowds-form-to-see-his-body-24274.html|archivedate=15 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=AFP|title=Thousands attend funeral of Coptic Pope Shenouda III|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/9155197/Thousands-attend-funeral-of-Coptic-Pope-Shenouda-III.html|accessdate=31 October 2015|agency=The Telegraph|date=March 20, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105001636/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/9155197/Thousands-attend-funeral-of-Coptic-Pope-Shenouda-III.html|archivedate=5 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the continued 2012 protests of the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011]], Abbassia was the scene of confrontations between protesters and armed gangs.  On December 11, 2016 [[St. Peter and St. Paul's Church, Cairo|a chapel]] next to the [[Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral]] was the site of [[Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral bombing|a suicide bombing]] against Egypt's Coptic community. Of the 25 Copts who died in the explosion, most were women and children. The army was deployed to the site and Egypt began three days of mourning.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|last=Abdelhadi|first=Magdi|title=Egyptians take Tahrir Square to the junta's doorstep|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/may/03/egyptians-tahrir-square-junta-abbassia|work=guardian.co.uk|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=7 December 2012|location=London|date=3 May 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108045642/http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/may/03/egyptians-tahrir-square-junta-abbassia|archivedate=8 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="list of attacks"&gt;{{cite web|title=List of attacks on Christians churches, institutions and individuals in Egypt|url=http://www.bishopangaelos.org/content/list-attacks-christians-churches-institutions-and-individuals-egypt|website=Bishop Angaelos|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221184830/http://www.bishopangaelos.org/content/list-attacks-christians-churches-institutions-and-individuals-egypt|archivedate=2016-12-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="women and children killed"&gt;{{cite news|title=Blast hits near Christian cathedral in Cairo, 25 killed, 49 wounded|url=https://www.rt.com/news/369924-cairo-coptic-blast-cathedral/|accessdate=12 December 2016|agency=RT|date=December 11, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161211203702/https://www.rt.com/news/369924-cairo-coptic-blast-cathedral/|archivedate=11 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Army Map Service''' of the US Army Corps of Engineers, was the premier map making agency of the [[US Department of Defense]] from 1941–68. The major task of the Army Map Service (AMS) was the compilation, publication and distribution of military topographic maps and related products required by the Armed Forces of the United States. The AMS was also involved in the preparation of extraterrestrial maps of satellite and planetary bodies; the preparation of national intelligence studies; the establishment of world geodetic control networks by both satellite and conventional triangulation methods; and the logistic military planning of Corps of Engineer items. Another major responsibility of the AMS is to maintain the largest [[geodetic system|geodetic]] and topographic data libraries for the Department of Defense.

==World War I==
[[File:US Army Corps of Engineers Map Making, World War I.jpg|right|thumb|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers topographic engineer making a map during World War I.]]

"The Army Map Service had its inception in a warehouse located at Ft. McNair (formerly the [[United States Army War College|Army War College]]), where space was set aside in 1910 to accommodate a reproduction unit and lithographic school. The combined elements formed the [[Central Map Reproduction Plant]] (CMRP). With the advent of World War I in 1917, the CMRP was re-organized and expanded by Major [[Charles H. Ruth]] in anticipation of a map supply crisis and was renamed the [[Engineer Reproduction Plant]] (EMP)."&lt;ref&gt;United States. 1968. U.S. Army, Corps of Engineers, Army Map Service. Washington: Army Map Service. Page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, the [[Map Reproduction Plant]] was given warehouse space at [[Ft. McNair]], to accommodate the map reproduction unit of the Corps of Engineers. Ultimately named the [[Central Map Reproduction]] unit, it incorporated a [[Lithography|lithographic]] school and 18 assigned military personnel. After World War I, this would be renamed the [[Engineer Reproduction Plant]]. The ERP was noted for experimentation on cartographic and [[Offset printing|photolithographic processes]] and media. They also experimentation in aerial [[photogrammetry]].
A number of [[US Geological Survey]] employees were assigned to the US [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] 29th Engineers, a map organization, during World War I. Major [[G.S. Smith]] commanded part of the 29th Engineers, a map making and topographical unit, with 53 officers and 146 men transferred from the US Geological Survey. Thirteen additional USGS [[Topography|topographers]] were assigned to the [[Coast Artillery of the US Army]] as "orienteur officers." When the [[2nd Brigade of Coast Artillery]] was formed, the military made a similar request for more USGS personnel, but the order was denied as these men were needed for the US Army Corps of Engineers.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Richard Trantor and Helen Fry. 1954. ''History of the Topographic Branch (Division) Predecessor Surveys'': Preliminary Draft. Pages 168–171.&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War I, the 29th Engineer (Topo) Battalion performed the [[Nicaragua Canal]] Survey. It was at this time that [[Benjamin B. Talley]], later a Brigadier General, invented a portable [[stereocomparagraph]] for [[Cartography|map making]].

==World War II==
The Army Map Service was formed during [[World War II]] from the consolidation of the [[Engineer Reproduction Plant]], the Library and the Cartographic Section of the [[War Department General Staff]]. Initially, many of the maps produced were revisions of existing maps. By the middle of the war, the [[cartographic]] work was changed to medium and small scale maps utilizing larger scale native maps as source materials. By the end of the war, considerable effort was being applied to large scale mapping by [[stereo-photogrammetric]] methods.

Between 1941 and 1945, the Army Map Service prepared 40,000 maps of all types, covering 400,000 square miles of the earth's surface. Over 500 million copies were produced during the war. The [[North African Campaign]] alone required 1,000 different maps with a total of 10 million copies. The Normandy invasion required 3,000 different maps with a total of 70 million copies. Similar commitments were filled for the Pacific and Far East operations.&lt;ref&gt;United States. 1968. ''U.S. Army, Corps of Engineers, Army Map Service''. Washington: Army Map Service. Page 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maps of all types were needed, from the strategic level maps to tactical level maps. "Indeed, General [[George S. Patton]] claims to have planned [[United States Army Central|Third Army]] movements by using a [[Michelin]] tourist road map of Europe, his knowledge of terrain, and gut-level feeling that tanks could negotiate the ground [[William the Conqueror]] had crossed nine centuries before."&lt;ref&gt;ETL- a Short History. 1989? US Army Engineer Topographic Laboratories. Fort Belvoir, VA. Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]] mapping output differs from general mapping agencies, such as the USGS, in that it is usually at a much larger scale (design/construction) and is project-specific; however, the mapping procedures used since World War II are not much different. Between 1949 and 1951, standardization of [[military mapping]] was agreed to between [[Canada]], Great Britain and the US, and was expanded to [[NATO]], [[SEATO]] and [[CENTO]] countries as well. This involved the application of the [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system|UTM]] to over 10,000 different maps covering 400,000 square miles and the printing of over 90,000,000 copies.

==Korean War==
The Army Map Service distributed 750,000 maps to all services during the first two weeks of the [[Korean War]]. In the following two weeks 5 million maps were printed, while in the first four weeks of the conflict, the Far East Command printed and distributed 10 million maps.&lt;ref&gt;United States. 1968. ''U.S. Army, Corps of Engineers, Army Map Service''. Washington: Army Map Service. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, the [[29th Engineer Topographic Battalion]] assumed responsibility for [[Korea]] and [[Okinawa]] and moved to [[Tokyo]], Japan. There it absorbed the [[64th Engineer Battalion]] and continued its mission of providing topographic support to U.S. and Allied forces in the Pacific Theatre, particularly to combat commands in Southeast Asia. In May 1966, the unit (less its survey element) moved to [[Ford Island]], Hawaii and was the primary map production unit for U.S. Forces in Vietnam. In January 1969, the unit was awarded the [[Meritorious Unit Commendation]] by the CINC, U.S. Army Pacific. A second Meritorious Unit Commendation was awarded in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, George A. 2007. "29th Engineer Topographic Battalion." From: "The Ethiopia-United States Mapping Mission." See the site, accessed February 27, 2009: http://www.ethi-usmappingmission.com/179410/296134.html?*session*id*key*=*session*id*val*&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inter-America Geodetic Survey==
The Corps of Engineers also participated in the [[Inter-American Geodetic Survey]] for mapping Central and South America. As part of this research many poorer nations could develop their resources. "In [[Cuba]], for instance, an extensive [[water table]] survey by IAGS made it possible to develop 500 wells."&lt;ref&gt;Leviero, Anthony. 1956. "Big Map Job: Seventeen Countries are being Surveyed by the Inter-American Geodetic Survey under the Direction of a Colonel of the Army's Corps of Engineers." Army. March 1956. Page 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vietnam War==
[[File:Coe7478 large.jpg|left|thumb|Shoulder patch of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Army Map Service.]]
From the outbreak of the operations in the [[Vietnam War]] in December 1966, the Army Map Service printed and shipped more than 200 million maps.&lt;ref&gt;United States. 1968. ''U.S. Army, Corps of Engineers, Army Map Service'. Washington: Army Map Service. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Mapmaking]] provided another area for engineer innovation in Vietnam. Up to date map and topographic information were key ingredients to military operations in Vietnam, especially the placement of [[artillery]] fire. During the early stages of the war, artillery units normally supported ground units from fixed positions into which ground control had been extended. Surveys enabled the artillery to ensure the accuracy of fire, but as artillery units moved to more remote areas it became more difficult to support friendly units because surveys were lacking. In early 1967, Lt. Col. [[Arthur L. Benton]], the former chief of the [[Mapping and Intelligence Section]] of the Engineer Sections, [[United States Army Vietnam]], who had returned to Vietnam on temporary duty from the Army Map Service in Washington, DC, developed a system known as [[photogrammetric positioning]]. By tying [[aerial photograph]]s to [[base map]]s, [[artillery surveyor]]s could readily obtain [[azimuth]] and location of firing positions. Working with the photographs and overprint of a map, [[aerial observer]]s could give accurate references to targets. Tests proved favorable, and a system was in place after [[Operation Cedar Falls]]."&lt;ref&gt;Traas, Adrian George. 2010. ''Engineers at War''. Washington, D.C.: Center of Military History, U.S. Army. p. 584.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special Foreign Activities==
The Army Map Service special foreign activities are carried out by the [[64th Engineer Battalion]] (Base Topographic). Its assigned mission is to provide AMS with required geodetic, mapping control and field classification data which are used in the production of various scale topographic maps. The battalion operated in Libya;[[Iran]], [[Ethiopia]] (including the [[Ethiopia – United States Mapping Mission]]) and [[Liberia]], and in some of the most rugged terrain in the world. Environmental conditions within the areas of operation created physical hazards such as miles of desert, blinding sand storms that imperil health and damage delicate instruments, mountains that range up to 15,000 feet above sea level, and steaming jungles with wild animals, dangerous reptiles and insects. These were routine field conditions for the men of the 64th.&lt;ref&gt;United States. 1968. ''U.S. Army, Corps of Engineers, Army Map Service''. Washington: Army Map Service. Page 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Space Age==
During the early years of the Space Age, geodetic investigations by the USACE determined the earth's size and shape, and included precise geodetic and astronomic surveys in many remote areas of the Pacific, the Arctic, Asia and South America. Work by Dr. [[Irene Fischer]] helped determine the parallax of the moon, and her geoid studies helped in investigation the lingering effects of the last [[Ice Age]]. The Corps of Engineers participated in the [[VANGUARD]] artificial satellite program with the US [[Army Signal Corps]] and US Navy to obtain astronomic, geodetic and gravimetric observations to determine the size and shape of the earth, intercontinental relationships and gravity fields. Continuing this work, Dr. [[Alden Colvocoresses]] (1923–2007) developed the [[Space Oblique Mercator]] projection, which was used with the [[Landsat]] satellite to make the first satellite produced map of the US.
[[File:AMS.Insignia.jpg|right|thumb|Coat of Arms of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Army Map Service.]]

The AMS and other agencies, split off to form the US Army "[[Engineer Research and Development Laboratories]] ([[UASERDL]]) in 1947; then evolved into next into the "[[Geodesy, Intelligence and Mapping Research and Development Agency]] ([[GIMRADA]]) in 1960; then the "[[Engineer Topographic Laboratories]]" or "ETL" in 1967; and then became the [[Topographic Engineering Center]] (TEC), which came to be housed at the [[Humphreys Engineer Center]], Alexandria, Virginia.  TEC did research in such fields as [[terrain analysis]] and [[geospatial data generation]]; developed [[imagery exploitation]], rapid prototyping, and other systems; and conducted operations in areas such as geospatial information, crisis support, [[urban studies]], and [[historical photo environmental analysis]].
Reflecting TEC's growing responsibilities in more diverse and technologically sophisticated areas, its name was changed to the [[Army Geospatial Center]] in 2009.  It continues to support both military and civil works activities.

AMS was redesignated the U.S. [[Army Topographic Command]] (USATC) on September 1, 1968, and continued as an independent organization until 1972, when it was merged into the new [[Defense Mapping Agency]] (DMA) and redesignated as the DMA Topographic Center (DMATC).

''' Baudin Rocks Conservation Park''' is a [[protected area]] occupying [[Baudin Rocks]] on the south east coast of [[South Australia]] about {{convert|8.3|km|abbr=off}} North-northwest of [[Robe, South Australia|Robe]].  In 1965, the island was declared as a Fauna Reserve under the ''Fauna Conservation Act 1964'' following a request from the Kingston Branch of the [[National Trust of Australia|National Trust of South Australia]] to declare ‘a reserve to afford protection to the wildlife population’.  The protected area status was retained following the enactment of the ''[[National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972]]'' in 1972 when it was renamed as the Baudin Rocks Conservation Park.  The conservation park is classified as an [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] [[IUCN protected area categories#Category Ia — Strict Nature Reserve|Category IA protected area]].&lt;ref name=Chart5&gt;{{Citation | author1=South Australia.

A region of [[Moldavia]] during the [[Romania in the Middle Ages|Middle Ages]], the territory of what became known as Bukovina was, from 1774 to 1918, an [[Duchy of Bukovina|administrative division]] of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], the [[Austrian Empire]], and [[Austria-Hungary]]. After [[World War I]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] established [[General Congress of Bukovina|its control]] over Bukovina. In 1940, the northern half of Bukovina was [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|annexed]] by the [[Soviet Union]] in violation of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]],&lt;ref&gt;Brackman, Roman ''The Secret File of Joseph Stalin: A Hidden Life'' (2001) p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; and currently is part of [[Ukraine]].

== Name ==
The name ''Bukovina'' came into official use in 1775 with the [[Grigore III Ghica|region's annexation]] from the [[Moldavia|Principality of Moldavia]] to the possessions of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], which became the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1804, and [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1867.

The official [[German language|German]] name of the province under Austrian rule (1775–1918), ''{{lang|de|die Bukowina}}'', was derived from the [[Polish language|Polish]] form ''{{lang|pl|Bukowina}}'', which in turn was derived from the common [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] form of ''buk'', meaning [[beech]] tree (cf the [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] ''{{lang|uk|бук}}'' {{IPA|[buk]}}; also the German ''{{lang|de|Buche}}'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?AddButton=pages%5CB%5CU%5CBukovyna.htm|title=Bukovyna|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brasovtravelguide.ro/en/romania/bucovina/bucovinas-monastery.php|title=Painted monasteries of Southern Bucovina – Brasov Travel Guide|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another German name for the region, ''{{lang|de|das Buchenland}}'', is mostly used in poetry, and means "beech land", or "the land of beech trees". In Romanian, in literary or poetic contexts, the name ''{{lang|ro|Țara Fagilor}}'' ("the land of beech trees") is sometimes used. In English, an alternative form is ''The Bukovina'', increasingly an archaism, which, however, is found in older literature.

In modern Ukraine, the name "Bukovina" is unofficial, but is common when referring to the ''[[Chernivtsi Oblast]]'', as over two thirds of the [[oblast]] is the northern part of Bukovina. In Romania the term ''Northern Bukovina'' is sometimes synonymous with the entire Chernivtsi Oblast of Ukraine, while ''(Southern) Bukovina'' refers to the [[Suceava County]] of Romania (although 30% of the present day [[Suceava County]] covers territory outside of the historical Bukovina).

== History ==
{{History of Romania}}
The territory of Bukovina had been part of [[Moldavia]] since the 14th century.
It was first delineated as a separate district in 1775, and was made a nominal duchy within the Austrian Empire in 1849.

=== Background ===
{{further|Moldavia|Romania in the Early Middle Ages|Origin of the Romanians}}
[[File:Partitions of Moldavia.jpg|thumb|left|Bukovina within historic Moldavia over time]]
The [[Moldavia]]n state had appeared by the mid-14th century, eventually expanding its territory all the way to the [[Black Sea]]. Bukovina and neighboring regions were the nucleus of the Moldavian Principality, with the city of [[Suceava]] as its capital from 1388 (after [[Baia]] and [[Siret]]). The name of [[Moldavia]] (''Moldova'') is derived from a river ([[Moldova River]]) flowing in Bukovina.

In the 15th century, [[Pokuttya]], the region immediately to the north, became the subject of disputes between the Principality of Moldavia and the [[History of Poland (1385–1569)|Polish Kingdom]]. Pokuttya was inhabited by [[Ruthenians]] (the predecessors of modern Ukrainians and [[Rusyns]]) and [[Hutsul]]s; the latter also reside in western Bukovina. In 1497 a battle took place at the [[Battle of the Cosmin Forest|Cosmin Forest]] (the hilly forests separating [[Chernivtsi]] and [[Siret]] valleys), at which [[Stephen III of Moldavia]] (Stephen the Great), managed to defeat the much-stronger but demoralized army of King [[John I Albert of Poland]]. The battle is known in Polish popular culture as "the battle when the knights have perished".

[[File:Cetatea de Scaun a Sucevei la ceas de seara.jpg|thumb|upright=1.30|View over the western side of the Suceava medieval seat fortress]]

In this period, the patronage of Stephen the Great and his successors on the throne of Moldavia saw the construction of the famous painted monasteries of [[Moldovița Monastery|Moldoviţa]], [[Sucevița Monastery|Suceviţa]], [[Putna Monastery|Putna]], Humor, [[Voroneţ]], [[Dragomirna]], [[Arbore Church|Arbore]] and others. With their renowned exterior [[fresco]]es, these monasteries remain some of the greatest cultural treasures of [[Romania]]; some of them are [[World Heritage Site]]s, part of the [[painted churches of northern Moldavia]]. Stephen also settled the first [[Ruthenia]]ns in Bukovina with the hope of having a loyal and more numerous population that would contribute with taxes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} In [[Suceava]], in the 16th century, two percent of the population (i.e. about 500–1000 people) was Ruthenian.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

In 1513, Moldavia started to pay annual tribute to the [[Ottoman Empire]], but remained autonomous and was governed as before by a native [[Voivode|Voivod]] / Prince.

In May, 1600 [[Michael the Brave|Mihai Viteazul (Michael the Brave)]], united the two Romanian principalities and Transylvania under his leadership.

For short periods of time (during wars), the Polish Kingdom occupied parts of northern Moldavia. However, the old border was re-established each time, as for example on 14 October 1703 the Polish delegate Martin Chometowski acknowledged "Between us and [[Vlachs|Wallachia]] (i.e. Moldavia) God himself set [[Dniester]] as the border" (''Inter nos et Valachiam ipse Deus flumine Tyras dislimitavit'').
[[File:Monumentul lui Grigore Ghica III din Iaşi7.jpg|thumb|Monument in [[Iași]] (1875) dedicated to [[Grigore III Ghica]] and Moldavia's loss of Bukovina]]
In the course of the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1768–1774|Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774]], the Ottoman armies were defeated by the [[Russian Empire]], which occupied the region during 15 December 1769 – September 1774, and previously during 14 September–October 1769. Bukovina was the reward the Habsburgs received for aiding the Russians in that war. Prince [[Grigore III Ghica]] of [[Moldavia]] protested and was prepared to take action to recover the territory, but was assassinated, and a Greek-[[Phanariotes|Phanariot]] foreigner was put on the throne of [[Moldavia]] by the Ottomans.

[[File:Palace of Justice, Vienna - Aula, Coat of Arms - Herzogtum Bukowina 4216.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The coat of arms of Bukovina, a constituent country of the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Imperial Austrian Council]], depicted at the Assembly Hall in the [[Palace of Justice, Vienna|Viennese Justice Palace]].]]

The [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian Empire]] occupied Bukovina in October 1774. Following the [[First Partition of Poland]] in 1772, the Austrians claimed that they needed it for ''a road between Galicia and Transylvania''. Bukovina was formally annexed in January 1775. On 2 July 1776, at Palamutka, Austrians and Ottomans signed a border convention, Austria giving back 59 of the previously occupied villages, retaining 278 villages.

Bukovina was a closed military district (1775–1786), then the largest district, ''[[Circle (country subdivision)|Kreis]] Czernowitz'' (after its capital [[Czernowitz]]) of the Austrian constituent [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]] (1787–1849). On 4 March 1849, Bukovina became a separate Austrian [[Crown land#Austria-Hungary|Kronland]] 'crown land' under a ''[[Landespräsident]]'' (not a ''Statthalter'', as in other crown lands) and was declared the ''Herzogtum Bukowina'' (a nominal duchy, as part of the official full style of the Austrian Emperors). In 1860 it was again amalgamated with Galicia, but reinstated as a separate province once again 26 February 1861, a status that would last until 1918.&lt;ref name="historyofukraine"&gt;Paul Robert Magocsi. ''A History of Ukraine.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press (1996), p. 420 {{ISBN|0-8020-0830-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1849 Bukovina got a representative assembly, the ''Landtag'' ([[Diet (assembly)|diet]]). The [[Moldovans|Moldavian]] nobility had traditionally formed the ruling class in that territory. In 1867, with the re-organisation of the Austrian Empire as the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], it became part of the [[Cisleithania]]n or Austrian territories of Austria-Hungary, and remained so until 1918.

The 1871 and 1904 jubilees held at [[Putna Monastery]], near the tomb of [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Ştefan cel Mare]], have constituted tremendous moments for Romanian national identity in Bukovina. Since gaining its independence, [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] envisioned to incorporate this historic province which, as a core of Moldavian Principality, was of a great historic significance to its [[History of Romania|history]] and contained many prominent monuments of its [[Art of Romania|art]] and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9017989?query=bukovina |title=Bukovina (region, Europe) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the influx of migrants encouraged under the Austrian rule, Romanians continued to be the largest ethnic group in the province in the first part of the 19th century. However, according to the 1880 census, there were 239,690 Ruthenians and [[Hutzul]]s, or roughly 41.5% of the population of the region, while Romanians were second with 190,005 people or 33%, a ratio that remained more or less the same until [[World War I]]. Ruthenian is an archaic name for [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]], while the [[Hutsul]]s are a regional Ukrainian subgroup.

Under Austrian rule Bukovina remained ethnically mixed: predominantly [[Romanians|Romanian]] in the south, [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] (commonly referred to as [[Ruthenians]] in the Empire) in the north, with small numbers of Hungarian [[Székelys]], [[Slovaks|Slovak]] and [[Poland|Polish]] peasants, and [[Germans]], [[Poles]] and [[Jews]] in the towns. The 1910 census counted 800,198 people, of which: [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]] 38.88%, [[Romanians|Romanian]] 34.38%, [[Ethnic German|German]] 21.24% ([[Jews]] 12.86% included), [[Polish people|Polish]] 4.55%, [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] 1.31%, [[Slovaks|Slovak]] 0.08%, [[Slovenes|Slovene]] 0.02%, [[Italian people|Italian]] 0.02%, and a few [[Croat]], [[Romani people|Romani]], [[Serbs|Serbian]], and [[Turkish people|Turkish]]. [[Romanians]] were still present in all settlements of the region, but their number decreased in the villages in the north. Many of Bukovina's Germans and Jews, as well as a number of Romanians and Hungarians, emigrated in 19th and 20th century to North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bukovinasociety.org |title=Bukovina Society of the Americas Home Page |publisher=Bukovinasociety.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~bakerroots/bukovina.html |title=Bukovina Germans |publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bukovinasociety.org/ellingson-brzl-2001-a.html |title=Bukovina Immigration to North America |publisher=Bukovinasociety.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609062842/http://www.bukovinasociety.org/ellingson-brzl-2001-a.html# |archive-date=2012-06-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1783, by an [[Imperial Decree|imperial decree]] of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], local [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[Eparchy of Bukovina]] with its seat in [[Czernowitz]] was placed under spiritual jurisdiction of [[Metropolitanate of Karlovci]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.putna.ro/istorie/cronologia.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050509082846/http://www.putna.ro/istorie/cronologia.htm |date=May 9, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some friction appeared in time between the church hierarchy and the Romanians complaining that [[Old Church Slavonic]] was favored to [[Romanian language|Romanian]], and that family names were being [[Slavicisation|slavicized]]. In spite of Romanian-Slav frictions over the influence in the local church hierarchy, there was no Romanian-Ukrainian inter-ethnic tension, and both cultures developed in educational and public life. After the rise of Romanian nationalism in 1848, Habsburg authorities awarded additional rights to Ukrainians in an attempt to temper Romanian ambitions of independence.&lt;ref&gt;Irina Livezeanu, ''Cultural Politics in Greater Romania'', Cornell University, 1995, p. 54-55.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 19th century, the development of [[Ukrainian culture]] in Bukovina surpassed [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] and the rest of Ukraine with a network of Ukrainian educational facilities. and [[Dalmatia]] formed an Archbishopric, later raised to the rank of ''Metropolitanate''

In 1873, the Eastern Orthodox Bishop of [[Czernowitz]], who was since 1783 under the spiritual jurisdiction of Metropolitan of Karlovci, was elevated to the rank of Archbishop when new [[Residence of Bukovinian and Dalmatian Metropolitans|Metropolitanate of Bukovinian and Dalmatia]] was created. New Archbishop of [[Czernowitz]] gained supreme jurisdiction over Serbian eparchies of [[Eparchy of Dalmatia|Dalmatia]] and [[Kotor]], that also were (until then) under spiritual jurisdiction of Karlovci.

In the early 20th century, a group of scholars surrounding the Austrian [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] created a plan (that never came to pass) of [[United States of Greater Austria]]. The specific proposal was published in Aurel C. Popovici's book “Die Vereinigten Staaten von Groß-Österreich“ [The United States of Greater Austria], Leipzig, 1906. According to it, most of Bukovina (including Czernowitz) would form, with [[Transylvania]], a Romanian state, while the north-western portion (Zastavna, Kozman, Waschkoutz, Wiznitz, Gura Putilei, and Seletin districts) would form with the bigger part of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] a Ukrainian state, both in a federation with 13 other states under the Austrian crown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://terkepek.adatbank.transindex.ro/legbelso.php3?nev=127] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022185521/http://terkepek.adatbank.transindex.ro/legbelso.php3?nev=127 |date=October 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bukovinasociety.org/#What%20and%20Where%20is%20Bukovina|title=Bukovina Society -|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[World War I]], several battles were fought in Bukovina between the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]], [[German Empire|German]], and [[Imperial Russia|Russian]] armies, which resulted in the Russian army being driven out in 1917.

With the collapse of [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1918, both the local [[Romanian National Council]] and the [[Ukrainian National Council]] based in Galicia claimed the region. A Constituent Assembly on 14/27 October 1918 formed an Executive Committee, to whom the Austrian governor of the province handed power. After an official request by [[Iancu Flondor]], Romanian troops swiftly moved in to take over the territory, against Ukrainian protest.&lt;ref name="EncUkr"&gt;[http://encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?AddButton=pages\B\U\Bukovyna.htm Bukovyna], Encyclopedia of Ukraine&lt;/ref&gt; Although local Ukrainians attempted to incorporate parts of northern Bukovina into the short-lived [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]], this attempt was defeated by Polish and Romanian troops.

Under the protection of Romanian troops, the Romanian Council summoned a [[General Congress of Bukovina]] for 15/28 November 1918, where 74 Romanians, 13 Ruthenians, 7 Germans, and 6 Poles were represented (this is the linguistic composition, and Jews were not recorded as a separate group).{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} According to Romanian historiography, popular enthusiasm swept the whole region, and a large number of people gathered in the city to wait for the resolution of the Congress.&lt;ref name="Kiriţescu1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=Constantin Kiriţescu|title=Istoria războiului pentru întregirea României: 1916–1919|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e1weAAAAMAAJ|year=1989|publisher=Ed.

[[File:Interbelic Suceava County CoA.png|thumb|left|Coat of arms of interwar Suceava county in the Kingdom of Romania]]

The Congress elected the Romanian Bukovinian politician [[Iancu Flondor]] as chairman, and voted for the union with the [[Kingdom of Romania]], with the support of the Romanian, German, and Polish representatives; the Ukrainians did not support this.&lt;ref name="rezumat"&gt;[http://www.unibuc.ro/studies/Doctorate2012Ianuarie/Mihai%20Florin%20Razvan%20-%20Minoritatea%20ucrainiana%20din%20Romania/REZUMAT-FLORIN-RAZVAN-MIHAI.pdf Minoritatea ucraineana din Romania (1918–1940)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017111137/http://www.unibuc.ro/studies/Doctorate2012Ianuarie/Mihai%20Florin%20Razvan%20-%20Minoritatea%20ucrainiana%20din%20Romania/REZUMAT-FLORIN-RAZVAN-MIHAI.pdf |date=2015-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons stated were that, until its takeover by the Habsburg in 1775, Bukovina was the heart of the [[Principality of Moldavia]], where the ''gropniţele domneşti'' (voivods' burial sites) are located, and ''dreptul de liberă hotărâre de sine'' (right of self-determination).&lt;ref&gt;''"Congresul general al Bucovinei, intrupand suprema putere a tarii si fiind investiti cu puterea legiuitoare, in numele suveranitatii nationale, hotaram: Unirea neconditionata si pe vecie a Bucovinei in vechile ei hotare pana la Ceremuş, Colacin si Nistru cu Regatul Romaniei".'' The General Congress of Bukovina, embodying the supreme power of the country [Bukovina], and invested with legislative power, in the name of national sovereignty, we decide: Unconditional and eternal union of Bukovina, in its old boundaries up to Ceremuş [river], Colachin and Dniester [river] with the Kingdom of Romania.&lt;/ref&gt; Romanian control of the province was recognized internationally in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of St. Germain]] in 1919.

During the [[interwar period]], Romanian authorities oversaw a programme of [[Romanianization]] aiming its assimilationist policies at the Ukrainian population of the region. The [[Romanian language]] was introduced into ethnic minority schools in 1923, and, by 1926, all public Ukrainian schools in Bukovina were closed (private schools were still allowed to exist).&lt;ref name="rezumat" /&gt;

At the same time, Ukrainian enrollment at the [[Chernivtsi University|Cernăuţi University]] fell from 239 out of 1671, in 1914, to 155 out of 3,247, in 1933, while simultaneously Romanian enrollment there increased several times to 2,117 out of 3,247.&lt;ref&gt;A.

Accessed 11 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In part this was due to attempts to switch to Romanian as the primary language of university instruction, but chiefly to the fact that the university was one of only five in Romania, and was considered prestigious.

In the decade following 1928, as Romania tried to improve its relations with the [[Soviet Union]], Ukrainian culture was given some limited means to redevelop, though these gains were sharply reversed in 1938.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

According to the 1930 Romanian census, [[Romanians]] made up 44.5% of the total population of Bukovina, and Ukrainians (including Hutsuls) 29.1%.&lt;ref&gt;Irina Livezeanu. ''Cultural Politics in Greater Romania: Regionalism, Nation Building, and Ethnic Struggle, 1918–1930''. [[Cornell University Press]]. 2000. p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; In the northern part of the region, however, Romanians made up only 32.6% of the population, with Ukrainians significantly outnumbering Romanians.

[[File:Bucovina division.svg|thumb|left|Bukovina as divided in 1940: Soviet to the north, Romanian to the south]]
Following the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], the [[June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum]] demanded from [[Romania]] the northern part of Bukovina, a region bordering [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] (the latter annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] at 1939 [[Invasion of Poland|Poland's partition in 1939]]). The Soviet demand for Bukovina surprised [[Nazi Germany]], though it did not formally oppose it. In the first Soviet ultimatum addressed to the Romanian government, the partly Ukrainian populated northern Bukovina was "demanded" as a minor ''"reparation for the great loss produced to the Soviet Union and [[Bassarabia]]'s population by twenty-two years of Romanian domination of [[Bassarabia]]"''. On 28 June 1940, the Romanian government evacuated Northern Bukovina, and the [[Red Army]] moved in, with the new Soviet-Romanian border being traced less than {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=off}} north of [[Putna Monastery]].

In 1940, [[Chernivtsi Oblast]] (⅔ of which is Northern Bukovina) had a population of circa 805,000, out of which 47.5% were Ukrainians and 28.3% were Romanians, with Germans, Jews, Poles, Hungarians and Russians comprising the rest.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The strong Ukrainian presence was the official motivation for inclusion of the region into the [[Ukrainian SSR]] and not into the newly formed [[Moldavian SSR]]. Whether the region would have been included in the Moldavian SSR, if the commission presiding over the division had been led by someone else than the Ukrainian communist leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]], remains a matter of debate among scholars.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} In fact, some territories with a mostly Romanian population (e.g., [[Hertza region]]) were allotted to the Ukrainian SSR.
[[File:GUVERNAMANTUL BUCOVINEI.png|thumb|right|Administrative map of the [[Governorate of Bukovina]] as of May 1942.]]

After the instauration of Soviet rule, under [[NKVD]] orders, thousands of local families were deported to [[Siberia]] during this period,&lt;ref name="noinu.rdscj.ro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noinu.rdscj.ro/article.php?articleID%3D149%26document%3D3#_ftn2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006123106/http://noinu.rdscj.ro/article.php?articleID=149&amp;document=3 |archivedate=2007-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with 12,191 people targeted for deportation in a document dated 2 August 1940 (from all formerly Romanian regions included in the Ukrainian SSR),&lt;ref name="noinu.rdscj.ro" /&gt; while a December 1940 document listed 2,057 persons to be deported to Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ziua.ro/display.php?id=183159&amp;data=2005-08-20&amp;ziua=40514329d9c319e3a6c30e040e4a40d9|title=Calvarul bucovinenilor sub ocupatia sovietica: ZIUA|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest action took place on 13 June 1941, when about 13,000 people were deported to Siberia and Kazakhstan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.md/article/masspop_ro.htm |title=UNHCR Moldova |publisher=Unhcr.md |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628161431/http://www.unhcr.md/article/masspop_ro.htm |archivedate=2006-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of those targeted were ethnic [[Romanians of Chernivtsi Oblast|local Romanians]], but there were (to a lesser degree) representatives of other ethnicities, as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rri.ro/en_gb/the_genocide_of_romanians_in_northern_bukovina-2547072 The Genocide of Romanians in Northern Bukovina]&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the repatriation convention{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} of 15 April 1941, NKVD troops killed hundreds of Romanian peasants of Northern Bukovina as they tried to cross the border into Romania in order to escape from Soviet authorities. This culminated on 1 April 1941 with the [[Fântâna Albă massacre]].

Almost the entire [[Bukovina Germans|German population of northern Bukovina]] was [[Heim ins Reich|coerced to resettle]] in 1940–1941 to the parts of Poland then occupied by Nazi Germany, during 15 September 1940 – 15 November 1940, after this area was occupied by the Soviet Union. About 45,000 ethnic Germans had left Northern Bukovina by November 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Leonid Ryaboshapko. Pravove stanovishche natsionalnyh menshyn v Ukraini (1917–2000), P. 259 (in Ukrainian).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of the [[Operation Barbarossa|1941 attack on the Soviet Union]] by the [[Axis forces]], the [[Romanian Third Army]] led by General [[Petre Dumitrescu]] (operating in the north), and the [[Fourth Army (Romania)|Fourth Romanian Army]] (operating in the south) regained Northern Bukovina, as well as [[Hertza region|Hertza]], and [[Bassarabia]], during June–July 1941.

The Axis invasion of northern Bukovina was catastrophic for its Jewish population, as conquering Nazi soldiers immediately began massacring its Jewish residents. Surviving Jews were forced into ghettoes to await deportation to work camps in Transnistria where 57,000 had arrived by 1941. Bukovina's remaining Jews were spared from certain death when it was retaken by Soviet forces in February, 1944. In all, about half of Bukovina's entire Jewish population had perished. After the war and the return of the Soviets, most of the Jewish survivors from northern Bukovina fled to Romania (and later settled in Israel).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%206091.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944 the [[Red Army]] drove the [[Axis forces]] out and re-established Soviet control over the territory. Romania was forced to formally cede the northern part of Bukovina to the [[USSR]] by the 1947 [[Paris peace treaty]]. The territory became part of the [[Ukrainian SSR]] as [[Chernivtsi Oblast]] ([[oblast|province]]). After the war the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government deported or killed about 41,000 [[Romanians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.observatorul.com/articles_main.asp?action=articleviewdetail&amp;ID=1951 |title=Observatorul |publisher=Observatorul |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of killings and mass deportations, entire villages, mostly inhabited by Romanians, were abandoned (Albovat, Frunza, I.G.Duca, Buci—completely erased, Prisaca, Tanteni and Vicov—destroyed to a large extent).&lt;ref name="Tara"&gt;Ţara fagilor: Almanah cultural-literar al românilor nord-bucovineni. Cernăuţi-Târgu-Mureş, 1994, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; Men of military age (and sometimes above) were conscripted into the Soviet Army. That did not protect them, however, from being arrested and deported for being "anti-Soviet elements".

As a reaction, partisan groups (composed of both Romanians and Ukrainians) began to operate against the Soviets in the woods around [[Chernivtsi]], Crasna and [[Codrii Cosminului]].&lt;ref&gt;Dragoş Tochiţă. Români de pe Valea Siretului de Sus, jertfe ale ocupaţiei nordului Bucovinei şi terorii bolşevice. - Suceava, 1999. - P. 35. (in Romanian)&lt;/ref&gt; In Crasna (in the former [[Storozhynets]] county) villagers attacked Soviet soldiers who were sent to "temporarily resettle" them, since they feared deportation. This resulted in dead and wounded among the villagers, who had no firearms.

Spring 1945 saw the formation of transports of Polish repatriates who (voluntarily or by coercion) had decided to leave. Between March 1945 and July 1946, 10,490 inhabitants left northern Bukovina for Poland, including 8,140 Poles, 2,041 Jews and 309 of other nationalities.

Overall, between 1930 (last Romanian census) and 1959 (first Soviet census), the population of northern Bukovina decreased by 31,521 people. According to official data from those two censuses, the Romanian population had decreased by 75,752 people, and the Jewish population by 46,632, while the Ukrainian and Russian populations increased by 135,161 and 4,322 people, respectively.

After 1944, the human and economic connections between the northern (Soviet) and southern (Romanian) parts of Bukovina were severed. While the northern part is the nucleus of the Ukrainian [[Chernivtsi Oblast]], the southern part is tightly integrated with the other Romanian historic regions.

In Romania, 28 November is a holiday observed as [[Public holidays in Romania|Bukovina Day]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agerpres.ro/politica/2015/10/28/presedintele-iohannis-a-promulgat-legea-prin-care-data-de-28-noiembrie-este-declarata-ziua-bucovinei-18-51-31 Președintele Iohannis a promulgat legea prin care data de 28 noiembrie este declarată Ziua Bucovinei] {{Ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bukovina1910ethnic.jpg|thumb|right|Demographic composition of Bukovina in 1910]]
[[File:Bucov.png|thumb|right|Demographic composition of Bukovina in 1930]]
According to the 1775 Austrian census, the province had a total population of 86,000 (this included 56 villages which were later returned to Moldova). The census only recorded social status and some ethno-religious groups ([[Jews]], [[Armenians]], [[Gypsy (term)|Gypsies]], [[Germans|German]] colonists). In 1919, the historian [[Ion Nistor]] claimed that [[Romanians]] constituted an overwhelming majority in 1774, roughly 64,000 (85%) of the 75,000 total population. Meanwhile, about 8,000 (10%) were [[Ruthenians]], and 3,000 (4%) other ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="romanians1774-1866"&gt;Keith Hitchins. ''The Romanians 1774–1866.'' Oxford: Clarendon Press (1996), pp. 226&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, just four years before the same Nistor claimed the 1774 population consisted of 52,750 Romanians (73%), 15.000 Ruthenians (21%) and 4,000 others "using Romanian in conversation" (6%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nistor |first1=Ion |title=Românii și rutenii în Bucovina |date=1915 |publisher=[[Romanian Academy]] |location=Bucharest |pages=70-72}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, an anthroponimical analysis of the Russian census of the population of Moldova in 1774 asserted a population of 68,700 people in 1774, out of which 40,920 (59.6%) [[Romanians]], 22,810 [[Ruthenians]] and [[Hutsuls]] (33.2%), and 7.2% [[Jews]], [[Roma people|Roma]], and [[Armenians]].&lt;ref name="ceeol.com"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ungureanu |first1=Constantin |title=Die Bevölkerung der Bukowina (von Besetzung im Jahr 1774 bis zur Revolution 1848) |url=https://www.ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=257907 |website=Romanian Journal of Population Studies |pages=117–143 |language=German |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the above anthroponimical estimate for 1774 as well as subsequent official censuses, the ethnic composition of Bukovina changed in the years after 1775 when the Austrian Empire occupied the region. The population of Bukovina increased steadily, primarily through immigration, which Austrian authorities encouraged in order to develop the economy.&lt;ref name="ansiedlungswesen_bukowina"&gt;Raimund Friedrich Kaindl. ''Das Ansiedlungswesen in der Bukowina seit der Besitzergreifung durch Österreich.'' Innsbruck (1902), pp. 1-71&lt;/ref&gt; As reported by Nistor, in 1781 the Austrian authorities had reported that Bukovina's rural population was composed mostly of immigrants, with only about 6,000 of the 23,000 recorded families being "truly Moldavian". In Nistor's view, this referred only to the Moldavian population native to the region, while the total population included significant number of Romanian immigrants from [[Moldavia]] and [[Transylvania]]. Another Austrian official report from 1783, referring to the villages between the Dniester and the Prut, indicated Ruthenian-speaking immigrants from Poland constituting a majority, with only a quarter of the population speaking Moldavian. The same report indicated that Moldavians constituted the majority in the area of Suceava.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nistor |first1=Ion |title=Românii și rutenii în Bucovina |date=1915 |publisher=[[Romanian Academy]] |location=Bucharest |pages=107-112}}&lt;/ref&gt; H.F.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Alecu Hurmuzaki, by 1848, 55% of the population was Romanian. At the same time, the Ukrainian population rose to 108,907 and the Jewish population surged from 526 in 1774, to 11,600 in 1848.&lt;ref name="romanians1774-1866" /&gt;

In 1843 the [[Ruthenian language]] was recognized, along with the [[Romanian language]], as 'the language of the people and of the Church in Bukovina'.&lt;ref name="jewishgen" /&gt;

During the 19th century the Austrian Empire policies encouraged the influx of many immigrants, primarily Ukrainians ("Ruthenes") from [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] and Romanians from Hungary and Transylvania, as well as smaller numbers of [[Bukovina Germans|Germans]], Poles, Jews and Hungarians.&lt;ref name="jewishgen"&gt;''[http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/bukovina/buk001.html#Decline%20of%20Rumanian%20Nationality Bukovina Handbook]'',

The 1857 and 1869 censuses omitted ethnic or language-related questions. 'Familiar language spoken' was not recorded again until 1880.

The Austrian census of 1850–1851, which for the first time recorded data regarding languages spoken, shows 48.50% [[Romanians]] and 38.07% [[Ukrainians]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Ethnographic map of austrian monarchy czoernig 1855.jpg|1855 Austrian ethnic-map showing census data in lower right corner]]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent Austrian censuses between 1880 and 1910 reveal a Romanian population stabilizing around 33% and a Ukrainian population around 40%.

According to the [[1930 Romanian Census]], Bukovina had a population of 853,009.&lt;ref name="Livezeanu2000" /&gt; Romanians made up 44.5% of the population, while 27.7% were Ukrainians/Ruthenians (plus 1.5% Hutsuls), 10.8% Jews, 8.9% Germans, 3.6% Poles, and 3.0% others or undeclared.&lt;ref&gt;[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/1930_provincii_2.jpg 1930 Romanian Census]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Current population ===
[[File:Bucovethn.png|thumb|Ethnic divisions in modern Bukovina with Ukrainian Romanian and Russian areas depicted in light yellow, green, and red respectively. The [[Moldovans]], counted separately in the [[Ukrainian census]], are included in this map as Romanians.]]

The present demographic situation in Bukovina hardly resembles that of the [[Austrian Empire]]. The northern (Ukrainian) and southern (Romanian) parts became significantly dominated by their Ukrainian and Romanian majorities, respectively, with the representation of other ethnic groups being decreased significantly.

According to the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)]] data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/ |title=All-Ukrainian population census&amp;#124; |publisher=Ukrcensus.gov.ua |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Ukrainians]] represent about 75% (689,100) of the population of [[Chernivtsi Oblast]], which is the closest, although not an exact, approximation of the territory of the historic Northern Bukovina. The census also identified a fall in the [[Romanians|Romanian]] and [[Moldovans|Moldovan]] populations to 12.5% (114,600) and 7.3% (67,200), respectively. [[Russians]] are the next largest ethnic group with 4.1%, while [[Poles]], [[Belarusians]], and [[Jews]] comprise the rest 1.2%. The languages of the population closely reflect the ethnic composition, with over 90% within each of the major ethnic groups declaring their national language as the mother tongue ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], and [[Russian language|Russian]], respectively).

The fact that [[Romanians]] and [[Moldovans]] were presented as separate categories in the census results, has been criticized by the [[Romanian Community of Ukraine – Interregional Union]], which complains that this old [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-era practice, results in the Romanian population being undercounted, as being divided between [[Romanians]] and [[Moldovans]].

The Romanians mostly inhabit the southern part of Chernivtsi region, being the majority in [[Hertsaivskyi Raion]], while they form the majority with Moldovans in the Ukrainian plurality [[Hlybotskyi Raion]]. Moldovans are the majority in [[Novoselytsia Raion]]. In the other eight districts, and the city of [[Chernivtsi]], [[Ukrainians]] are in the majority.

The southern, or Romanian Bukovina has a significant Romanian majority (94.8%), largest minority group being the [[Romani people]] (1.9%) and Ukrainians, who make up 0.9% of the population (2011 census). Other minor ethnic groups include [[Lipovans]], [[Poles in Romania|Poles]] (in [[Cacica]], [[Mănăstirea Humorului]], [[Mușenița]], [[Moara, Suceava|Moara]], and [[Păltinoasa]]), [[Zipser Germans]] (in [[Cârlibaba]] and [[Iacobeni, Suceava|Iacobeni]]), and [[Slovaks of Romania|Slovaks]].

The '''''Forbes'' China Celebrity 100''' is a list published annually by ''[[Forbes]]'' which ranks the influence of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] celebrities. It is similar to [[Celebrity 100]] also published by ''Forbes''. Factors that are taken into account include income, search engine hits, as well as exposure on newspapers, magazines and television. As of 2016, the list has been discontinued due to the cease operation of Forbes in China. In 2017, the list revived.

In 2010, the list started to include Chinese celebrities born in [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]], and abroad. Prior to that it only included celebrities born in [[Mainland China|mainland China]].

'''''Boussole''''' was a former [[fluyt|flûte]] of the [[French Navy]], famous for its exploration of the [[Pacific]] under [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse]].

She was built in 1781-82 at [[Bayonne]] as the flûte ''Portfaix'' for the French Navy. In May 1785 she and her sistership [[French ship Astrolabe (1781)|''Astrolabe'']] (previously the ''Autruche'') were renamed and rerated as frigates, and fitted for round-the-world scientific exploration. It departed [[Brest, France|Brest]] on 1 August 1785 under Lapérouse, accompanied by the ''Astrolabe'' under [[Paul Antoine Fleuriot de Langle]].

The expedition vanished mysteriously in 1788 after leaving [[Botany Bay]] on 10 March 1788. Captain [[Peter Dillon]] in {{ship|HCS|Research|1823|2}} solved the fate of the expedition when he found remnants of ''Astrolabe'' and ''Boussole'' at [[Vanikoro]] Island in the [[Solomon Islands]]. Local inhabitants reported that a storm had wrecked both ships. Survivors from one ship had been massacred while survivors from the other ship had constructed their own small boat and sailed off the island, never to be heard from again.&lt;ref&gt;''Australian Shipwrecks - vol1 1622-1850'', [[Charles Bateson]], AH and AW Reed, Sydney, 1972, {{ISBN|0-589-07112-2}} p24&lt;/ref&gt;

The fate of Lapérouse and his two ships at Vanikoro is the subject of a chapter in ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'' by [[Jules Verne]].

[[Image:Map of Bangladesh-en.svg|thumb|right|Map of Bangladesh]]

[[Bangladesh]] is a densely-populated, low-lying, mainly [[riverine]] country located in [[South Asia]] with a coastline of {{convert|580|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} on the northern [[littoral]] of the [[Bay of Bengal]]. The delta plain of the [[Ganges River|Ganges (Padma)]], [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra (Jamuna)]], and [[Meghna River]]s and their tributaries occupy 79 percent of the country. Four uplifted blocks (including the Madhupur and Barind Tracts in the centre and northwest) occupy 9 percent, and steep hill ranges up to ca 1,000 m high occupy 12 percent in the southeast (the [Chittagong Hill Tracts]) and in the northeast. Straddling the [[Tropic of Cancer]], Bangladesh has a tropical [[monsoon]] climate characterised by heavy seasonal rainfall, high temperatures, and high humidity. Natural disasters such as floods and [[cyclones]] accompanied by [[storm surge]]s periodically affect the country.  Most of the country is intensively farmed, with rice the main crop, grown in three seasons. Rapid urbanisation is taking place with associated industrial and commercial development.  Exports of garments and shrimp plus remittances from Bangladeshis working abroad provide the country's three main sources of foreign exchange income.

[[Image:Satellite image of Bangladesh in October 2001.jpg|thumb|NASA satellite Image of Bangladesh's physical features (click to enlarge and view national borders)]]''

The [[physical geography]] of Bangladesh is varied and has an area characterised by two distinctive features: a broad [[river delta|deltaic]] [[plain]] subject to frequent flooding, and a small hilly region crossed by swiftly flowing rivers. The country has an area of {{convert|147610|sqkm}} and extends {{convert|820|km}} north to south and {{convert|600|km}} east to west. Bangladesh is bordered on the west, north, and east by a {{convert|4095|km}} land frontier with [[India]] and, in the southeast, by a short land and water frontier ({{convert|193|km}}) with Burma ([[Myanmar]]). On the south is a highly irregular deltaic coastline of about {{convert|580|km}}, fissured by many rivers and streams flowing into the [[Bay of Bengal]]. The [[territorial waters]] of Bangladesh extend {{convert|12|nmi|km}}, and the exclusive economic zone of the country is {{convert|200|nmi|km}}.

Roughly 80% of the landmass is made up of fertile alluvial lowland called the Bangladesh Plain. The plain is part of the larger Plain of Bengal, which is sometimes called the Lower Gangetic Plain. Although altitudes up to {{convert|105|m}} above sea level occur in the northern part of the plain, most elevations are less than {{convert|10|m}} above sea level; elevations decrease in the coastal south, where the terrain is generally at sea level. With such low elevations and numerous rivers, water—and concomitant flooding—is a predominant physical feature. About {{convert|10000|sqkm}} of the total area of Bangladesh is covered with water, and larger areas are routinely flooded during the monsoon season.

The only exceptions to Bangladesh's low elevations are the [[Chittagong Hills]] in the southeast, the Low Hills of Sylhet in the northeast, and highlands in the north and northwest. The Chittagong Hills constitute the only significant hill system in the country and, in effect, are the western fringe of the north-south mountain ranges of Burma and eastern India. The Chittagong Hills rise steeply to narrow ridge lines, generally no wider than {{convert|36|m}}, with altitudes from {{convert|600|to|900|m}} above sea level. At {{convert|1052|m}} altitude, the highest elevation in Bangladesh is found at [[Saka Haphong]], in the southeastern part of the hills. Fertile valleys lie between the hill lines, which generally run north-south. West of the Chittagong Hills is a broad plain, cut by rivers draining into the Bay of Bengal, that rises to a final chain of low coastal hills, mostly below {{convert|200|m}}, that attain a maximum elevation of {{convert|350|m}}. West of these hills is a narrow, wet coastal plain located between the cities of Chittagong in the north and Cox's Bazar in the south.

About 67% of Bangladesh's nonurban land is arable. Permanent crops cover only 2%, meadows and pastures cover 4%, and forests and woodland cover about 16%. The country produces large quantities of quality timber, bamboo, and sugarcane. Bamboo grows in almost all areas, but high-quality timber grows mostly in the highland valleys. Rubber planting in the hilly regions of the country was undertaken in the 1980s, and rubber extraction had started by the end of the decade. A variety of wild animals are found in the forest areas, such as in the Sundarbans on the southwest coast, which is the home of the [[royal Bengal tiger]]. The alluvial soils in the Bangladesh Plain are generally fertile and are enriched with heavy silt deposits carried downstream during the rainy season.

==Human geography==

Urbanisation is proceeding rapidly, and it is estimated that only 30% of the population entering the labour force in the future will be absorbed into agriculture, although many will likely find other kinds of work in rural areas. The areas around [[Dhaka]] and [[Comilla]] are the most densely settled. The Sundarbans, an area of coastal tropical jungle in the southwest and last wild home of the [[Bengal tiger]], and the Chittagong Hill Tracts on the southeastern border with Burma and India, are the least densely populated.

==Climate==
[[File:Bangladesh map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|300px|Bangladesh map of Köppen climate classification.]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}
{{See also|Climate change in Bangladesh}}
Bangladesh has a [[tropical monsoon climate]] characterised by wide seasonal variations in rainfall, high temperatures, and high humidity. Regional climatic differences in this flat country are minor. Three seasons are generally recognised: a hot, muggy summer from March to June; a hot, humid and rainy monsoon season from June to November; and a warm-hot, dry winter from December to February. In general, maximum summer temperatures range between {{convert|38|and|41|C|F|1}}. April is the hottest month in most parts of the country. January is the coolest month, when the average temperature for most of the country is {{convert|16|-|20|C|F}} during the day and around {{convert|10|°C}} at night.

Winds are mostly from the north and northwest in the winter, blowing gently at {{convert|1|to|3|km/h|mph|1}} in northern and central areas and {{convert|3|to|6|km/h|mph|1}} near the coast. From March to May, violent thunderstorms, called northwesters by local English speakers, produce winds of up to {{convert|60|km/h|mph|1}}. During the intense storms of the early summer and late monsoon season, southerly winds of more than {{convert|160|km/h|mph|1}} cause waves to crest as high as {{convert|6|m|ft|1}} in the Bay of Bengal, which brings disastrous flooding to coastal areas.

Heavy rainfall is characteristic of Bangladesh causing it to flood every year. Except for the relatively dry western region of Rajshahi, where the annual rainfall is about {{convert|1600|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, most parts of the country receive at least {{convert|2300|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of rainfall per year. Because of its location just south of the foothills of the Himalayas, where monsoon winds turn west and northwest, the region of Sylhet in northeastern Bangladesh receives the greatest average precipitation. From 1977 to 1986, annual rainfall in that region ranged between {{convert|3280|and|4780|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year. Average daily humidity ranged from March lows of between 55 and 81% to July highs of between 94 and 100%, based on readings taken at selected stations nationwide in 1986.

About 80% of Bangladesh's rain falls during the monsoon season. The monsoons result from the contrasts between low and high air pressure areas that result from differential heating of land and water. During the hot months of April and May hot air rises over the Indian subcontinent, creating low-pressure areas into which rush cooler, moisture-bearing winds from the Indian Ocean. This is the southwest monsoon, commencing in June and usually lasting through September. Dividing against the Indian landmass, the monsoon flows in two branches, one of which strikes western India. The other travels up the Bay of Bengal and over eastern India and Bangladesh, crossing the plain to the north and northeast before being turned to the west and northwest by the foothills of the Himalayas.

Natural calamities, such as floods, tropical cyclones, tornadoes, and tidal bores—destructive waves or floods caused by flood tides rushing up [[estuaries]]—ravage the country, particularly the coastal belt, almost every year. Between 1947 and 1988, 13 severe cyclones hit Bangladesh, causing enormous loss of life and property. In May 1985, for example, a severe cyclonic storm packing {{convert|154|km/h|mph|1|sing=on}} winds and waves {{convert|4|m|ft|1}} high swept into southeastern and southern Bangladesh, killing more than 11,000 persons, damaging more than 94,000 houses, killing some 135,000 head of livestock, and damaging nearly {{convert|400|km|mi|1}} of critically needed embankments.

Annual monsoon flooding results in the loss of human life, damage to property and communication systems, and a shortage of drinking water, which leads to the spread of disease. For example, in 1988 two-thirds of Bangladesh's 64 districts experienced extensive flood damage in the wake of unusually heavy rains that flooded the river systems. Millions were left homeless and without potable water. Half of Dhaka, including the runway at the Shahjalal International Airport—an important transit point for disaster relief supplies—was flooded. About {{convert|2000000|t|ST LT|0}}&lt;!-- ??? --&gt; of crops were reported destroyed, and relief work was rendered even more challenging than usual because the flood made transportation of any kind exceedingly difficult. [[Daulatpur-Salturia Tornado|A tornado in April 1989]] killed more than 600 people, possibly many more.

There are no precautions against cyclones and tidal bores except giving advance warning and providing safe public buildings where people may take shelter. Adequate infrastructure and air transport facilities that would ease the sufferings of the affected people had not been established by the late 1980s. Efforts by the government under the Third Five-Year Plan (1985–90) were directed toward accurate and timely forecast capability through agrometeorology, marine meteorology, oceanography, hydrometeorology, and seismology. Necessary expert services, equipment, and training facilities were expected to be developed under the United Nations Development Programme.

Cold weather is unusual in Bangladesh. When temperatures decrease to {{convert|8|C|F|0}} or less, people without warm clothing and living in inadequate homes may die from the cold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Cold Wave Kills 102 People in Bangladesh |work= Los Angeles Times |date= 6 January 1995 |page= 6 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-01-06/news/mn-16935_1_worst-cold-wave |quote= "Temperatures plunged to 39 degrees this week in northern Bangladesh, killing people too poor to afford jackets or sweaters.

==River systems==
[[Image:Ganges River Delta, Bangladesh, India.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ganges River Delta, Bangladesh and India]]
The rivers of Bangladesh mark both the physiography of the nation and the life of the people. About 700 in number, these rivers generally flow south. The larger rivers serve as the main source of water for cultivation and as the principal arteries of commercial transportation. Rivers also provide fish, an important source of protein. Flooding of the rivers during the monsoon season causes enormous hardship and hinders development, but fresh deposits of rich silt replenish the fertile but overworked soil. The rivers also drain excess monsoon rainfall into the Bay of Bengal. Thus, the great river system is at the same time the country's principal resource and its greatest hazard.

The profusion of rivers can be divided into five major networks. The Jamuna-Brahmaputra is {{convert|292|km}} long and extends from northern Bangladesh to its confluence with the Padma. Originating as the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River (Tibet)|Yarlung Tsangpo River]] in China's Xizang Autonomous Region (Tibet) and flowing through India's state of Arunachal Pradesh, where it becomes known as the Brahmaputra ("Son of Brahma"), it receives waters from five major tributaries that total some {{convert|740|km}} in length. At the point where the Brahmaputra meets the Tista River in Bangladesh, it becomes known as the Jamuna. The Jamuna is notorious for its shifting subchannels and for the formation of fertile silt islands (chars). No permanent settlements can exist along its banks.

The second system is the Padma-Ganges, which is divided into two sections: a {{convert|258|km}} segment, the Ganges, which extends from the western border with India to its confluence with the Jamuna some {{convert|72|km}} west of Dhaka, and a {{convert|126|km}} segment, the Padma, which runs from the Ganges-Jamuna confluence to where it joins the Meghna River at Chandpur. The Padma-Ganges is the central part of a deltaic river system with hundreds of rivers and streams—some {{convert|2100|km}} in length—flowing generally east or west into the Padma.

The third network is the [[Surma-Meghna River System]], which courses from the northeastern border with India to Chandpur, where it joins the Padma. The Surma-Meghna, at {{convert|669|km}} by itself the longest river in Bangladesh, is formed by the union of six lesser rivers. Below the city of Kalipur it is known as the Meghna. When the Padma and Meghna join together, they form the fourth river system—the Padma-Meghna—which flows {{convert|145|km}} to the Bay of Bengal.

This mighty network of four river systems flowing through the Bangladesh Plain drains an area of some {{convert|1.5|e6sqkm|sqmi}}. The numerous channels of the Padma-Meghna, its distributaries, and smaller parallel rivers that flow into the Bay of Bengal are referred to as the Mouths of the Ganges. Like the Jamuna, the Padma-Meghna and other estuaries on the Bay of Bengal are also known for their many chars.

A fifth river system, unconnected to the other four, is the Karnaphuli. Flowing through the region of Chittagong and the Chittagong Hills, it cuts across the hills and runs rapidly downhill to the west and southwest and then to the sea. The Feni, Karnaphuli, Sangu, and Matamuhari—an aggregate of some {{convert|420|km}}—are the main rivers in the region. The port of Chittagong is situated on the banks of the Karnaphuli. The Karnaphuli Reservoir and Karnaphuli Dam are located in this area. The dam impounds the Karnaphuli River's waters in the reservoir for the generation of hydroelectric power.

The Ganga–Brahmaputra rivers contribute nearly 1000&amp;nbsp;million tons/yr of [[sediment]]. The sediment contributed from these two rivers forms the Bengal Delta and [[Submarine fan]], a vast structure that extends from Bangladesh to south of the Equator which is up to 16.5&amp;nbsp;km thick, and contains at least 1130&amp;nbsp;trillion tonnes of sediment accumulating over the last 17 million years at an average rate of 665&amp;nbsp;million tons/yr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.iisc.ernet.in/currsci/apr252003/1041.pdf |format=PDF|title=  A sediment budget for the Ganga–Brahmaputra catchment|first=Robert|last=Wasson|year=2003|journal=Current Science|volume=84|issue=8|pages=1041–1047}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bay of Bengal used to be deeper than the [[Mariana Trench]], the present deepest ocean point.

During the annual monsoon period, the rivers of Bangladesh flow at about {{convert|140000|m3/s}}, but during the dry period they diminish to {{convert|7000|m3/s}}. Because water is so vital to agriculture, more than 60% of the net arable land, some {{convert|91000|sqkm}}, is cultivated in the rainy season despite the possibility of severe flooding, and nearly 40% of the land is cultivated during the dry winter months. Water resources development has responded to this "dual water regime" by providing flood protection, drainage to prevent over flooding and water logging, and irrigation facilities for the expansion of winter cultivation. Major water control projects have been developed by the national government to provide irrigation, flood control, drainage facilities, aids to river navigation and road construction, and hydroelectric power. In addition, thousands of tube wells and electric pumps are used for local irrigation. Despite severe resource constraints, the government of Bangladesh has made it a policy to try to bring additional areas under irrigation without salinity intrusion.

Water resources management, including gravity flow irrigation, flood control, and drainage, were largely the responsibility of the Bangladesh Water Development Board. Other public sector institutions, such as the Bangladesh Krishi Bank, the Bangladesh Rural Development Board, the Bangladesh Bank, and the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation were also responsible for promotion and development of minor irrigation works in the private sector through government credit mechanisms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7539">The '''geology of [[Iraq]]''' includes thick sequences of marine and continental sedimentary rocks over poorly understood basement rock, at the junction of the Arabian, Anatolian and Iranian plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map |author=Fouad &amp; Sissaskian|year=2012|title=Geological Map of Iraq|publisher=Iraq Geological Survey|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geologic history, stratigraphy and tectonics==
The oldest rocks exposed at the surface in Iraq are part of the [[Cambrian]] and [[Ordovician]] age Khabour Quartzite Formation. Very little research and as of 1997 no boreholes have managed to reach underlying [[Precambrian]] rock. Most likely deeper basement rocks are part of the Afro-Arabian Plate formed into a [[craton]] in the [[Proterozoic]]. Northeastern Iraq has a thinned quasicontinental crust due to Neo-Tethys extensional faulting and plastic deformation of rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|author=Numan, Nazar M.S.|year=1997|title=A Plate Tectonic Scenario for the Phanerozoic Succession in Iraq|publisher=Iraqi Geological Journal|p=89-90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)===
In the [[Paleozoic]], the Arabian Plate was an extension of the African Plate and a part of [[Gondwana]] oriented to Paleo-Tethys Ocean to the north. Grabens formed, accumulating thicker sediments although sedimentary rocks overall ranged up to four kilometers thick. Drilling in the Western Desert penetrated the Khabour Quartzite Formation down 1.67 kilometers without leading to depth estimates in grabens of three kilometers. In the late [[Silurian]], deposition paused twice due to the [[Caledonian orogeny]] and the [[Hercynian orogeny]] resulted in a deposition break in the [[Carboniferous]] and [[Permian]]. 

The Khabour Quartzite is overlain by the Akkaz Formation. The Pirispiki Red Beds and Chalki Volcanics from the [[Devonian]] are related to the global [[Kaskaskia]] marine transgression event, along with the Ora Shale and a sequence of limestone formations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Adnan_Aqrawi/publication/279893431_Paleozoic_stratigraphy_and_petroleum_systems_of_the_Western_and_Southwestern_Deserts_of_Iraq/links/59dde794aca272b698fdfb88/Paleozoic-stratigraphy-and-petroleum-systems-of-the-Western-and-Southwestern-Deserts-of-Iraq.pdf|format=PDF|title=Paleozoic stratigraphy and petroleum systems of the Western and Southwestern Deserts of Iraq|website=Researchgate.net|accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ga'ara Formation and the Chia Zairi Limestone Formation deposited in the Permian. Chia Zairi rocks are particularly thick—up to 800 meters—and include the 61 meter Satina Evaporite Member, interpreted as the beginning of splitting of the Arabian Plate into the Anatolian Plate and Iranian Plate. The Harur Limestone Formation in the Early Carboniferous marked a significant change in deposition that persisted into the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. Limestone, marl, evaporite and shale became the dominant rocks in northern Iraq while a mix of clastic and calcareous rocks was more typical in the south.{{sfn| Numan|1997|p=90-93}}

===Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)===
In the [[Mesozoic]], the Anatolian and Iranian plates fully separated and the Neo-Tethys Ocean opened. The Mesopotamian Zone (also known as the Mesopotamian Foredeep) and central Iraq had particularly thick sedimentary sequences. North-south axes are common in flexures in these rocks. In the Zone of Foreland Folding, rocks show signs of [[turbdiite]] and submarine fan deposits. 

The 24 meter Beduh Shale Formation deposited in the [[Werfenian]], overlying the 200 meter Mirga Mir Limestone. It is overlain by the [[Anisian]] and [[Ladinian]] age Geli Khana Formation up to 575 meters thick. These units deposited owing to rapid subsidence with the pull-apart of the crust and separation of the Iranian Plate. The 36 meter Baluti Shale Formation formed in the [[Rhaetian|Rhaetic]], overlain by the 834 meter [[Carnian]]-[[Norian]] Kurrah Chine Formation and [[Early Jurassic|Liassic]] 303 meter Sarki Formation. Further to the south, lagoon conditions formed the Butmah Formation, Adaiyah Anhydrite, Mus Limestone, Alan Anhydrite and Sargelu Formation. The Najmah and Gotnia formations emplaced during the [[Callovian]] and [[Tithonian]]. 

Through the [[Jurassic]], the Nahr Umr, Mauddud, Rutba and Msad formations accumulated in what is now the Western Desert. The Foreland Folds Belt foreland basin accumulated calcareous material and [[argillite]], including the 762 meter Balambo Formation.
 
In the [[Cretaceous]], [[ophiolite]] obducted as the Penjwin-Shlair Complex, the Qulqula Radiolarites and the Khwakurk Series volcanics as the foreland basin witnessed 270 meters of sediment deposition. The Katarash volcanic rocks are indicative of uplift and mantle convection back-arc spreading. The Red Beds Series piled up near the subduction zone, where the Neo-Tethys Ocean crust was being subducted and consumed beneath the Anatolian and Iranian Plates. The Naopurdan Group, Gimo-Qandil Group and Walash Volcanics formed in forearc and back-arc environments. Kolosh and Tanjero formation clastic rocks are from [[flysch]] sediments in the Neo-Tethys Ocean that remained on the Arabian Plate continental margin.{{sfn| Numan|1997|p=94-98}}

===Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)===
Combined [[Maastrichtian]] and [[Paleocene]] sediments range from as little as 100 meters to as much as 2.79 kilometers. During the [[Eocene]], the Arabian Plate began to underride the Anatolian and Iranian Plate as the Neo-Tethys Ocean fully closed. Shallow seas and lagoons dominated the landscape, with periodic evaporite deposition such as the Gercus Formation. Other locations accumulated continental [[red beds]]. The Kirkuk Group, which hosts the large Kirk oil field, deposited during these transgression-regression cycles in the [[Oligocene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jpg.12543|title=TECTONO-STRATIGRAPHIC EVOLUTION OF THE NW SEGMENT OF THE ZAGROS FOLD-THRUST BELT, KURDISTAN, NE IRAQ|first1=F.

The Jeribe and Serikagni formations and the Dhiban Anhydrite mark continued transgressions into the [[Miocene]]. The Fatha and Ghar formations appeared in the Middle Miocene, with recurring lagoon conditions, before the Injana Formation foreland basin marked the end of marine deposition. 

The Mukdadiyah and Bai Hassan formations include 2.5 kilometers of [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] formed during the [[Alpine orogeny]] (the combined 354 meter Dibdibba and Zahra formations emplaced on the quasiplatform). Basement faulting was typical of the orogeny period as the [[Zagros Mountains]] began to form.{{sfn| Numan|1997|p=97-100}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://jgs.lyellcollection.org/content/158/6/969|title=Progressive unconformities within an evolving foreland fold–thrust belt, Zagros Mountains|first1=Khaled|last1=Hessami|first2=Hemin A.|last2=Koyi|first3=Christopher J.|last3=Talbot|first4=Hadi|last4=Tabasi|first5=Esmael|last5=Shabanian|date=1 November 2001|publisher=|journal=Journal of the Geological Society|volume=158|issue=6|pages=969–981|accessdate=4 November 2018|doi=10.1144/0016-764901-007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Negroland and Guinea with the European Settlements, 1736.jpg|thumb|300px|''"[[Negroland]] and Guinea with the European Settlements"'', [[Herman Moll]], 1727]]
'''Guinea''' is a traditional name for the region of the [[Africa]]n coast of [[West Africa]] which lies along the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. It is a naturally moist tropical forest or savanna that stretches along the coast and borders the [[Sahel]] belt in the north.

== Etymology ==
The etymology of "Guinea" is uncertain. The English term ''Guinea'' comes directly from the Spanish word ''Guinea'', which in turn derives from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word ''Guiné''. The Portuguese term emerged in the mid-15th century to refer to the lands inhabited by the ''Guineus'', a generic term used by the Portuguese to refer to the 'black' African peoples living south of the [[Senegal River]] (in contrast to the 'tawny' [[Sanhaja]] [[Berber people|Berbers]], north of it, whom they called ''Azenegues''). The term "Guinea" is extensively used in the 1453 chronicle of [[Gomes Eanes de Zurara]].&lt;ref&gt;Zurara titled his 1453 chronicle of the [[Henry the Navigator|Henrican]] discoveries as the "conquest of Guinee", (e.g. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nr4NAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.1]) and although Zurara starts off using the term "Guinea" loosely to include the [[Western Sahara]] coast, he eventually ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Nr4NAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA158#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.153]) corrects himself and notes that the term "Guinea" really applies only the lands of the ''Guineus'', the black people south of the Senegal River.&lt;/ref&gt;  King [[John II of Portugal]] took up the title of ''Senhor da Guiné'' (Lord of Guinea) from 1483. 

It is believed the Portuguese borrowed ''Guineus'' from the [[Berber languages|Berber]] term ''Ghinawen'' (sometimes [[Arabic|Arabized]] as ''Guinauha'' or ''Genewah'') meaning "the burnt people" (analogous to the [[Classical Greek]] ''[[Aethiopia (Classical Greek term)|Aithiops]]'', "of the burned face").&lt;ref&gt;Rogado Quintino (1965) "O problema da origem dos termos «Guiné» e «Guinéus»", ''Boletim Cultural da Guiné portuguesa'', vol. 20, no.78, p.117-45.&lt;/ref&gt; The Berber terms "aginaw" and "[[Akal n-Iguinawen]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/country,,,COUNTRYPROF,GIN,456d621e2,4954ce60c,0.html|title=World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples - Guinea: Overview|accessdate=24 May 2016|publisher=Minority Rights Group International}}&lt;/ref&gt; mean "black" and "land of the blacks", respectively.

A competing theory, first forwarded by [[Leo Africanus]] in 1526,&lt;ref&gt;The year Leo completed the manuscript of his book on African geography (''[[Description of Africa (1550 book)|Description of Africa]]'') according to the date on the sole surviving manuscript ([[Biblioteca Nazionale Vittorio Emanuele III|Biblioteca Nazionale Vittorio Emmanuele]], MS 953).&lt;/ref&gt; claims that 'Guinea' is derived from [[Djenné]] (which he refers to as ''Gheneo, Genni'' and ''Ghinea''),&lt;ref&gt; Leo Africanus uses the word 'Ghinea' for both a village and a large kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt; the great interior commercial city on the Upper [[Niger River]].&lt;ref&gt;Leo Africanus (written 1526, pub.1550) ''The History and Description of Africa: and of the notable things therein'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=rmcMAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=editions%3AyP18oL6yRoQC&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.79])&lt;/ref&gt; Djenné dominated the gold and salt trade across West Africa, from the 11th century (fall of [[Ghana Empire|Ghana]]) until the 13th century (when the [[Mali Empire|Mali]] invasion disrupted its routes and redirected trade to [[Timbuktu]], hitherto just a small Djenné outpost). It is during the period of Djenné dominance that the term ''Genewah'' really comes forward into usage in Arab sources (''al-Sudan'' - Arabic for "blacks" - is used more commonly before).&lt;ref name="p.20"&gt;[[W. D. Cooley]] (1841) ''The Negroland of the Arabs examined and explained''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=380NAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.20].&lt;/ref&gt;

Other theories try to connect "Guinea" to "Ghana", but this is less certain.  The [[Ghana Empire]] is named after the Medieval trading city of ''Ghanah'' mentioned already by 11th-century Arab geographers (e.g. [[al-Bakri]]), but it is used distinctly from ''Genewah'' by Arab sources (e.g. they would say "Ghanah in the country of Genewah").&lt;ref name="p.20"/&gt;  Conversely, it remains possible that both Ghana and Djenné themselves owe their original city names to the Berber appellation for the blacks that lived there. A possible reconciliation of the theories is that the Berber ''Ghinawen'' (blacks) was the source of the ''Djenné'' (city), which in turn gave rise to the Arabic ''Genewah'' (land dominated by that city), which finally made it into the Portuguese ''Guiné''.&lt;ref&gt;Cooley (1841) endorses the theory (p.18n) that Djenné, rather than blacks, was the source of the Arabic term Genewah (and thus Portuguese Guiné), but at the same time (p.20n) recognizes that Djenné itself might originally come from the Berber Ghinawen (blacks).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Historically, the Guinea region was one of the first parts of [[Africa]] to trade with Europeans.

In 1478 (during the [[War of the Castilian Succession]]), a Castilian armada of 35 caravels and a Portuguese fleet fought the [[battle of Guinea]] in the waters off [[Elmina]], for the hegemony of the Guinea trade (gold, ivory and black pepper). The war ended both with a Portuguese naval victory and the official recognition by the [[Catholic Monarchs]] of the Portuguese sovereignty over most of the African territories in dispute ([[Treaty of Alcáçovas]], 1479).&lt;ref name="Historian Malyn Newitt"&gt;Historian Malyn Newitt: ''“However, in 1478 the Portuguese surprised thirty-five Castilian ships returning from Mina ''&lt;nowiki&gt;[Guinea]&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' and seized them and all their gold. Another...Castilian voyage to Mina, that of [[Eustache de la Fosse]], was intercepted ... in 1480. (...) All things considered, it is not surprising that the Portuguese emerged victorious from this '''first maritime colonial war'''. They were far better organised than the Castilians, were able to raise money for the preparation and supply of their fleets, and had clear central direction from ... ''&lt;nowiki&gt;[Prince]&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' John.”'' In [http://www.google.com/search?q=%22the+Portuguese+emerged+victorious+from+this+first+maritime+colonial+war.%22+&amp;btnG=Pesquisar+livros&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;hl=pt-PT  ''A history of Portuguese overseas expansion, 1400-1668''], Routledge, New York, 2005, p.39,40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bailey W. Diffie"&gt;Bailey W. Diffie and George D. Winius ''“In a war in which the Castilians were victorious on land and the Portuguese at sea, …”'' in [https://books.google.pt/books?id=VsqCelF9OdkC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;lpg=PA152&amp;dq=%22foundations+of+the+Portuguese+empire....In+a+war+in+which+the+Castilians+were+victorious+on+land+and+the+Portuguese+on+sea%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_6XiLcq0Ez&amp;sig=MxqBFdBqI-MryupkXAHW3pBa9LU&amp;hl=  ''Foundations of the Portuguese empire 1415-1580''], volume I, University of Minnesota Press, 1985, p.152.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first colonial war among European powers. Many more would come. After the Portuguese and Castilians came the Dutch, French and British.

The extensive trade in [[ivory trade|ivory]], [[gold]], and [[slavery|slave]]s made the region wealthy, with a number of centralized kingdoms developing in the 18th and 19th centuries.  These were much smaller than the large states of the wide-open Sahel, but they had far higher population densities and were more centralized politically.  The cohesion of these kingdoms caused the region to show more resistance to European incursions than other areas of Africa. Such resistance, combined with a [[disease]] environment hostile to Europeans, meant that much of Guinea was not colonised by Europeans until the very end of the 19th century.

== Subdivisions ==
Guinea is often subdivided into "[[Lower Guinea]]" and "[[Upper Guinea]]". Lower Guinea is one of the most densely populated regions of Africa, covering southern [[Nigeria]], [[Benin]], [[Togo]] and stretching into [[Ghana]]. It includes the coastal regions as well as the interior. Upper Guinea is far less densely populated and stretches from [[Côte d'Ivoire]] to [[Senegal]].
 
Within the [[Republic of Guinea]], [[Lower Guinea]] refers to the country's coastal plain, while [[Upper Guinea]] refers to the country's interior.

European traders in the region subdivided the region based on its main exports.  The eastern portion around Benin and Nigeria was named the [[Slave Coast of West Africa|Slave Coast]]. What is now Ghana was called the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|(British) Gold Coast]], a name later given to a British colony in the area which ultimately absorbed earlier European colonies. West of this was the Ivory Coast, still the name of the nation in that region. Farthest west, the area around modern [[Liberia]] and [[Sierra Leone]] was referred to as either the [[Pepper Coast]] or the Grain Coast.

The '''international date line&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In this article, the convention used is to capitalize "Date Line" (or "International Date Line") when it refers to the ''standard'' [[International Date Line]], but to use small letters to refer to possible construct(s) under Jewish law.&lt;/ref&gt;  in Judaism''' is used to demarcate the change of one calendar day to the next in the [[Hebrew calendar|Jewish calendar]]. The Jewish calendar defines days as running from sundown to sundown rather than midnight to midnight. So in the context of Judaism, an international date line demarcates when the line of sundown moving across the Earth's surface stops being the sundown ending and starting one day and starts being the sundown ending and starting the following day.

However, the conventional [[International Date Line]] is a relatively recent geographic and political construct whose exact location has moved from time to time depending on the needs of different interested parties. While it is well-understood why the conventional date line is located in the Pacific Ocean, there are not really objective criteria for its exact placement within the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[International Date Line|main article]] for details.&lt;/ref&gt; In that light, it cannot be taken for granted that the conventional International Date Line can (or should) be used as a date line under Jewish law. In practice, within Judaism the ''[[Jewish law|halakhic]]'' date line is similar to, but not necessarily identical with, the conventional Date Line, and the differences can have consequences under religious law.

==Location of the date line==

===Theoretical basis for the discussion===
Many of the opinions about the ''halakhic'' date line are structured as a response to the question of what days someone should observe as [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holidays]]. Shabbat occurs every seven days at any location on earth. It is normally thought to occur on Saturday—or more precisely, from Friday at sundown to Saturday at nightfall. But if the ''halakhic'' date line is not identical to the conventional Date Line, it is possible that what is Saturday with respect to the conventional Date Line is not Saturday with respect to the ''halakhic'' date line, at least in some places.

There are several opinions regarding where exactly the ''halakhic'' date line should be according to Jewish law, and at least one opinion that says that no ''halakhic'' date line really exists.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;&lt;ref name="taarich"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Taplin |first1=Rabbi Yisroel |authorlink1=Yisroel Taplin |title=Sefer Taarich Yisroel |date=1998–1999 |location=Lakewood, NJ |url=http://www.datelineinhalacha.com/dateline_in_halacha.html |language=Hebrew|postscript=,}} which is summarized in English at {{cite web |title=Kitzur Taarich Yisroel: The Dateline in Halacha |url=http://www.datelineinhalacha.com/dateline_in_halacha.html |website=www.datelineinhalacha |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=map&gt;[http://www.star-k.org/articles/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IDL_Map.pdf The International Dateline in Halacha (Star-K)(map)], 170 kB&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|90}}'''1. ''90 degrees east of Jerusalem.''''' The concept of a ''halakhic'' date line is mentioned in the ''[[Baal HaMeor]],'' a 12th-century Talmudic commentary,&lt;ref name=kashrus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.star-k.org/articles/kashrus-kurrents/493/a-travelers-guide-to-the-international-dateline/ |last=Heber|first=Rabbi Dovid|title=A Traveller's Guide To The International Dateline |publisher=Star-k.org |accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rabbeinu Zecharya Halevi, ''Baal Hameor'', Tractate Rosh Hashana, 20b&lt;/ref&gt; which seems to indicate that the day changes in an area where the time is six hours ahead of [[Jerusalem]] (90 degrees east of Jerusalem, about 125.2°E, a line now known to run through [[Australia]], the [[Philippines]], [[China]] and [[Russia]]). This line, which he refers to as the ''K'tzai Hamizrach'' (the easternmost line), is used to calculate the day of [[Rosh Hashanah]], the Jewish New Year. According to some sources it is alluded to in both the [[Babylonian Talmud]] ([[Rosh Hashanah (tractate)|Rosh Hashanah]] and [[Eruvin (Talmud)|Eruvin]]) and in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]].  The ''[[Kuzari]]'' of [[Yehuda Halevi]], also a 12th-century work, seems to agree with this ruling.

Later decisors like the ''[[Chazon Ish]]'' (twentieth century) fundamentally agree with this ruling. However, they recognize practical issues associated with the pure use of a line of longitude for this purpose. As an example, 125.2°E passes directly through Dongfeng Street in [[Changchun]], China.&lt;ref&gt;To be precise, at a point 1.11 km east of Xihu Rd. See [https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=43.84%2C125.2#map=12/43.8400/125.1999 location on OpenStreetMaps.]&lt;/ref&gt; If this line of longitude were used strictly, people could simply avoid Shabbat altogether by crossing the street. To prevent that, the Chazon Ish rules{{refn|Cited in Taplin&lt;ref name="taarich /&gt; at footnote 16 of the web page.}}&lt;ref name="RJJ"&gt;This is rejected by the [[Yitzchok Zev Soloveitchik|Brisker Rav]] (see {{cite journal|last1=Pahmer|first1=David|title=The International Date Line and Related Issues|journal=RJJ Journal of Halacha and Contemporary Society|date=1990|volume=XXI|pages=60–83|url=http://download2.yutorah.org/1991/1053/735807.pdf|accessdate=27 April 2016|postscript=}} at page 69), who rules that the use of this meridian is absolute.&lt;/ref&gt; that the contiguous land masses to the east of that line of longitude are considered secondary (''tafel'') to the land masses west of that line. As a result, he rules that the date line runs along 125.2°E when over water, but curves around the eastern coast of mainland Asia and Australia. By this view, Russia, China and Australia are west of the date line and observe Shabbat on local Saturday. [[Japan]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Tasmania]] are east of the date line and should observe Shabbat on local Sunday, as defined by the conventional International Date Line. By this view, the Philippines and [[Indonesia]] would have portions west of the line and portions east of the line.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;

'''2. ''180 degrees east of Jerusalem.''''' Rabbi [[Yechiel Michel Tucazinsky]] ruled that the International Date Line is 180 degrees east of Jerusalem.  That would mean that the date line, rather than being near 180°, would be at 144.8°W.  By this view, places east of the conventional International Date Line but west of 144.8°W—[[Alaska]], [[Hawaii]] and a variety of archipelagos in the Pacific—would observe Shabbat on the local Friday instead of the local Saturday.

It is possible (but not certain) under this view to apply the principal of ''tafel'' described above as well. In that event, mainland Alaska would be east of the date line, but the [[Aleutian Islands]] would be west of the date line.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;

'''3. ''Mid-Pacific.''''' A variety of decisors{{refn|''Inter alia,'' Rabbis David Shapira, B. Rabinowitz Thumim, the ''Atzei Sodeh,'' and the ''Alai Yonah.'' These decisors do not necessarily rule identically to each other.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shurpin|first1=Rabbi Yehuda|title=The Sabbath, the International Date Line and Jewish Law|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1736567/jewish/|website=Chabad.org|publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} rule that the date line runs in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, close to (but not necessarily the same as) the conventional International Date Line. According to this point of view, all of the major populated areas of the Pacific (such as New Zealand, Japan, Alaska and Hawaii) observe Shabbat on local Saturday (that is, consistent with the conventional International Date Line). Only certain Pacific islands, generally having few or no permanent Jewish residents, might not observe Shabbat on local Saturday.&lt;ref name=map/&gt;

'''4. ''Following local custom/There is no fixed date line.''''' According to Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Kasher]], there is no clear tradition or Talmudic source dictating any of the preceding opinions as binding. For that reason, and consistent with a [[History of responsa in Judaism|responsum]] of the [[Radbaz]], Rabbi Kasher starts with the default law that a Jew not knowing the proper day for Shabbat should count days from the last time s/he observed Shabbat, and that every seven days is Shabbat. In his view, established Jewish communities are presumed to have fixed their calendars according to this principle. Therefore, Shabbat in an established community is whatever day the community has established. Rabbi [[Isser Zalman Meltzer]] and Rabbi [[Zvi Pesach Frank]] apparently agree with this position.&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;&lt;ref name=gewirtz&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gewirtz|first1=William L.|title=Zemannim: On the Introduction of New Constructs in Halakhah|journal=The Torah U-Madda Journal|date=2012–13|volume=16|pages=153–172|jstor=23596060}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|155}} This position does not in and of itself require a formal date line to be established, and Rabbi Kasher does not seem to think that it is necessary to do so. But the ''de facto'' result of this position is consistent with the conventional International Date Line, at least anywhere there is an established Jewish community.&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;{{refn|Rabbi Shurpin&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;{{rp|Note 14}} and Gewirtz&lt;ref name=gewirtz/&gt;{{rp|Note 4}} provide treatments as to how [[International Date Line#Historical alterations|changes in the location of the International Date Line]] might affect its use as a ''de facto'' standard in Jewish Law.}}

===Practical rulings===
In practice, the conventional International Date Line (or another mid-Pacific line near it) is the ''de facto'' date line under Jewish law, at least for established Jewish communities. The communities of Japan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jccjapan.or.jp/ Jewish Community of Japan], [http://www.jcckobe.org/ Jewish Community of Kansai]&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chc.org.nz/ Canterbury Hebrew Congregation], [http://ahc.org.nz/category/events/ Auckland Hebrew Congregation]&lt;/ref&gt; Hawaii,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sofmaarav.org/ Congregation Sof Maarav], [http://www.mauijews.org/#!events/c17et Jewish Congregation of Maui]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[French Polynesia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Andrew|title=Shabbat in Tahiti paradise|url=http://www.jewishnews.net.au/shabbat-in-tahiti-paradise/14535|accessdate=27 April 2016|work=The Australian Jewish News|date=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; all observe Shabbat on local Saturday ''(i.e.,'' Friday night until Saturday night). No known Jewish community observes Shabbat on a day other than local Saturday.&lt;ref name=jta&gt;The one arguable exception is [[Samoa]], which moved from the east side of the International Date Line to the west side around New Year's Day 2012. The [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] located one relatively observant Jewish individual living on Samoa, who said at the time that he would follow the lead of local [[Seventh-Day Adventist]] churches and light Shabbat candles on Saturday night. (See {{cite news|last1=Soclof|first1=Adam|title=Samoa time warps into Shabbat|url=http://www.jta.org/2012/01/03/the-archive-blog/samoa-time-warps-into-shabbat|accessdate=27 April 2016|agency=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=3 January 2012|postscript=.)}} However, the practice of a single individual may not be sufficient to establish a community practice in Jewish law.&lt;/ref&gt; However, that practical conclusion is reached in two different ways, resulting in somewhat different practice patterns in each case.

'''''Following local custom/There is no fixed date line.''''' As noted above, according to this point of view, Shabbat is simply observed on the date previously established as Shabbat by the local community—uniformly, local Saturday&lt;ref name=jta/&gt;—without any need for any further observance. This appears to be the default practice for residents of such places as Japan, New Zealand and Hawaii. At minimum, it is difficult to find evidence of other practices by residents of those areas.&lt;ref name=worker&gt;See, as an anecdotal example, {{cite web|title=The international dateline and halacha|url=http://jewishworker.blogspot.com/2005/09/international-dateline-and-halacha.html|website=The Jewish Worker|accessdate=27 April 2016|postscript=;}} search the page for "NZ".&lt;!--This is a blog, and the pertinent comment was in the responses, not in the blog post itself. As a source, it doesn't really qualify as a RS, and it is intended to be illustrative, rather than definitive. But there is little in the way of reliable evidence, which is not surprising given that one is essentially trying to prove a negative.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Taken to a fully logical conclusion, ''no fixed date line'' means that anyone in a location without an established tradition of which day is Shabbat should always depend on his own personal count of days. It is not clear whether this can currently apply to someone traveling on his or her own to an island in the Western Pacific without an established tradition. (See, for example, Rabbi Shurpin {{refn|name=chabad}} at the end of the section "The Samoa issue".) However, it seems clear that at minimum one construes an "established community" relatively broadly. So while Japan, for example, has only a scattered handful of synagogues, their uniform practice of observing Shabbat on Saturday seems sufficient to fix Saturday as the established day for Shabbat anywhere in Japan.}}

'''''Establishment of a date line by a majority among three halakhic positions.''''' The travelers' guide of the [[Star-K]] kosher supervision service, compiled according to the rulings of its rabbinic administrator, Rabbi [[Moshe Heinemann]], uses the following approach,&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt; which is also cited by others. According to this approach, the [[#90|first three numbered sections above]] constitute three valid, parallel, ''halakhic'' rulings. Shabbat is consequently fully observed on whichever day is consistent with the majority view among those opinions (two out of three). However, out of respect to the minority view of the third ruling, and with an eye toward not desecrating Shabbat, [[Melacha|Torah-level prohibitions]] are to be avoided on the day consistent with the minority view, although that day is otherwise considered a weekday. According to this rule, practice is as follows: 
* In New Zealand and Japan, the local Saturday is Shabbat according to the majority opinion (sections 2 and 3 above), and it should therefore be fully observed as Shabbat. However, since according to the minority opinion (section 1 above), Shabbat is on the local Sunday, one should not perform any Torah-level Shabbat prohibitions on Sunday. Nevertheless, on Sunday, one should pray the regular weekday prayers, donning [[tefillin]] during morning prayers.
* In Hawaii and French Polynesia, the local Saturday is Shabbat according to majority opinion (sections 1 and 3 above), and it should therefore be fully observed as Shabbat. However, since according to the minority opinion (section 2 above), Shabbat is on the local Friday, one should not perform any Torah-level Shabbat prohibitions on Friday. Friday prayers are weekday prayers, and preparation for Shabbat must be done with an eye to avoiding Torah-level Shabbat prohibitions.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt; 
* In principle, a zone of pure doubt exists in approximately the area of 169°W–177°E,&lt;ref name=map/&gt; including places like [[Tonga]], Samoa and [[American Samoa]]. The rulings of the ''Mid-Pacific'' group above are not perfectly consistent in this area,&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt; so there is no possibility of an unambiguous "two out of three" consensus here. Rabbi Dovid Heber of the Star-K suggests that in such locations one might need to observe Shabbat fully for two days every week.&lt;ref name="heber2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heber|first1=Rabbi Dovid|title=How to Keep This Shabbos in Samoa? STAR-K Tells Us How (Samoa &amp; Tokelau To Cross International Date Line)|url=http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/113307/how-to-keep-this-shabbos-in-samoa-star-k-tells-us-how-samoa-tokelau-to-cross-international-date-line.html|website=The Yeshiva World News|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Star-K's international kosher supervision staff follows this approach, and there is evidence that some other travelers also do.&lt;ref name=worker/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Dateline|url=http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.culture.religion.jewish.avodah/26561|website=avodah@aishdas.com|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities suggesting this approach often advise travelers to avoid the zone of doubt entirely near weekends, or to consult with a competent rabbinical authority directly.&lt;ref name=heber2/&gt;

==Crossing the halakhic date line==
The issues discussed in the previous section apply ''per se'' to individuals or communities in fixed locations. However, the act of crossing the date line (wherever it may be drawn) introduces a number of additional issues under Jewish law. Questions potentially affected include:&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;
{{div col}}
*Crossing the line into or out of Shabbat or a holiday, or a [[Ta'anit|rabbinic fast day]], while already aboard an airplane or a ship
*Determining what prayers to say (and when) while in transit
*Lighting candles on [[Hanukkah]]
*[[Counting of the Omer]], and consequently fixing the day for [[Shavuot]]
*[[Niddah|Counting days until relations are permitted following menstruation]]
*Fixing the date for [[Brit Milah]], [[Pidyon Haben]] or [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]]
{{div col end}}
In some cases, crossing the date line (wherever it may be drawn) has a specific impact on practice or prohibitions under Jewish law. In others, an individual's count of days (by the experience of sunset and sunrise) is the determining factor, regardless of the crossing of the date line. Details around specific questions, cases and rulings of Jewish law are beyond the scope of this article.{{refn|See Taplin&lt;ref name="taarich" /&gt;, which covers these questions in some detail. The author notes that there are consensus opinions about some—but not all—of these issues.}}

==Considerations for astronauts==
Before Israeli astronaut [[Ilan Ramon]] flew on the [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']] in 2003, he decided (after consultation with rabbis) to observe Shabbat according to time in his last residence, [[Kennedy Space Center|Cape Canaveral]], since he would be crossing the date line and observing sunset many times per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Ask the rabbi: Shabbat in space|date=18 January 2003|website=ohr.edu|publisher=[[Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem]]|url=https://ohr.edu/explore_judaism/ask_the_rabbi/ask_the_rabbi/637|accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|work=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]|title=Ilan Ramon|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ilan-ramon|date=February 2, 2003|accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=standard /&gt; [[Judith Resnik]], the first American Jewish astronaut in space, lit (electronic) Shabbat candles according to the time in [[Johnson Space Center|Houston, TX]], her home and the location of [[Christopher C.

This is a '''list of known Taínos''', some of which were ''caciques'' (male and female [[tribal chief]]s). Their names are in ascending alphabetical order and the table may be re-sorted by clicking on the arrows in the column header cells.

The [[Taínos]] were the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] inhabitants of the [[Bahamas]], [[Greater Antilles]], and some of the [[Lesser Antilles]] – especially in [[Guadeloupe]], [[Dominica]] and [[Martinique]]. The Taínos ("Taíno" means "relatives"), unlike the [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] (who practiced regular raids on other groups), were peaceful seafaring people and distant relatives of the [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] people of South America.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, p. 5., Retrieved September 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Taíno society was divided into two classes: ''Nitainos'' (nobles) and the ''Naborias'' (commoners). Both were governed by chiefs known as ''caciques'', who were the maximum authority in a ''Yucayeque'' (village). The chiefs were advised by priest-healers known as ''Bohiques'' and the ''Nitaynos'', which is how the elders and warriors were known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmuseo.org/taino/caciques.html |title=Caciques, nobles and their regalia |accessdate=2006-11-09 |work= |publisher=elmuseo.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009090513/http://elmuseo.org/taino/caciques.html |archivedate=2006-10-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[Aymamón]]
| Cacique of yucayeque around [[Río Culebrinas|Culebrinas]] river in Puerto Rico.  Puerto Rican anthropologist [[Ricardo Alegría]] suggests that the proper pronunciation and name of the cacique was Aymaco, with Aymamón being a way of designating the cacique that ruled over the region called Aymamio, or possibly just a misunderstanding of the name's adequate pronunciation.  However, historical documents have traditionally used the name Aymamón. He is known for having ordered the kidnapping of the son of Spaniard Pedro Xuarez. He called for a game at the batey among his subjects and offered as prize the honor of burning the Spaniard alive and hence proving their mortality and vincibility. However, the Spanish found out about the plan and Captain Salazar was sent to rescue the young Spaniard. In the subsequent battle, the son of Pedro Xuarez was rescued and Aymaco wounded. While healing, Aymaco called on Salazar to exchange names and offer peace. Despite his peace offering, he later participated in the Taíno Rebellion of 1511 which was also crushed.&lt;ref name="Caciques" /&gt;

| Cacique of Cueybá [[Cuba]] Provided food and shelter to [[Alonso de Ojeda]] who was shipwrecked on the Island of [[Cuba]] he was accompanied by seventy men and was seeking help. The pirate Bernardino de Talavera took Ojeda prisoner. A hurricane struck Talaveras ship and Talavera made amends and helped each other, despite their efforts the ship was shipwrecked at Jagua, [[Sancti Spíritus]], on the south coast of [[Cuba]]. Ojeda decided to travel along the coast on foot with Talavera and his men in order to reach [[Maisí]] Point from where they would be able to get to Hispaniola. However, the party faced a number of difficulties en route and half of the men died of hunger, illness or other hardships that they met along the way. The sole possession remaining to Ojeda was an image of the [[Virgin Mary]], which he had carried with him since he left [[Spain]]. He made a promise on this image that he would build a church dedicated to her in the first village that he reached where he was given hospitality. A little later, and with only a dozen men and the pirate Talavera still surviving, he arrived in the district of Cueybá where the chief Cacicaná provided food and shelter. Ojeda was true to his word and he built a small hermitage to the Virgin in the village, which was venerated by the local people. The party was rescued by [[Pánfilo de Narváez]] and taken to [[Jamaica]], where Talavera was imprisoned for piracy. From [[Jamaica]] Ojeda returned to Hispaniola where he learned that [[Fernández de Enciso]] had been able to relieve the colonists who had stayed in San Sebastián modern day Municipality of [[Necoclí]] in the subregion [[Urabá Antioquia|Urabá]] in the department [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]], [[Colombia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alonso de Ojeda]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the battle through the mountains, Taino rebels Baconao &amp; Abama (Husband and wife) were killed. Mabey was surrounded and cornered at the edge of a cliff where he and Gálvez fought hand-to-hand the battle lasted various minutes, Gálvez's servant, an ambitious and cruel man saw the possibility of running away with treasure and pretending that he was helping Gálvez pushed both of them down the cliff where they fell to their death. The Spanish arrived with a group of captured Indians found out through Bacanao small daughter who was embracing the body of her dead mother (Abama), the truth about the crime. Gálvez's servant was taken prisoner as so were the Taino rebels and Baconao's Daughter. The Spanish buried Gálvez and left Mabey's cadaver to rot and be eaten by vultures. They then led the procession of indigenous prisoners to the presence of Capitan Vasco de Porcallo, which he ordered to the gallows. There, in the Loma de la Cruz, which bisects the town Güinía neighborhoods, the 12 Indians were hanged, the traitor (Gálvez's servant) was hung by his feet and shot in that position.

This is a '''list of currently active [[Separatism|separatist]] movements in [[Oceania]]'''. Separatism includes [[autonomism]] and [[secession]]ism. What is and is not considered an autonomist or secessionist movement is sometimes contentious. Entries on this list must meet three criteria:
#They are active movements with living, active members.
#They are seeking greater autonomy or self-determination for a geographic region (as opposed to personal autonomy).
#They are the citizen/peoples of the conflict area.

Under each region listed is one or more of the following (except for The United States which only has the last one):
*''De facto'' state: for regions with ''[[de facto]]'' autonomy from the government
*Proposed state: proposed name for a seceding [[sovereign state]]
*Proposed autonomous area: for movements toward greater [[Autonomous area|autonomy for an area]] but not outright secession
**''De facto'' autonomous government: for governments with ''de facto'' autonomous control over a region
**Government-in-exile: for a [[Government in exile|government based outside of the region in question]], with or without control
**Political party (or parties): for [[Political party|political parties]] involved in a political system to push for autonomy or secession
**Militant organisation(s): for armed organisations
**Advocacy group(s): for [[Advocacy group|non-belligerent, non-politically participatory entities]]
**[[Ethnic]]/[[ethno-religious]]/[[racial]]/[[Regionalism (politics)|regional]]/[[Religious denomination|religious]] group(s)

| {{ListFlag|Banner of the Lordship of Ireland.svg}} || 1386–1541 || The heraldic banner of the [[Lordship of Ireland]] was based on its coat of arms. The earliest depiction of the 'triple crown' motif is found on the arms granted by [[Richard II]] to Robert de Vere as [[Lord of Ireland]] in 1386. "They were borne, apparently as the arms of Ireland, in the funeral procession of Henry IV in 1413. They appear as a device on the Irish coinage of [[Edward IV]] (1461–83), [[Richard III]] (1483–85), [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] (1485–1509), and the pretender, [[Lambert Simnel]] (1487). [[Edward IV]] specified them as the Irish arms in an indenture of 1483".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[[Gerard Anthony Hayes-McCoy|Hayes-McCoy, Gerard Anthony]] (1979). ''A History of Irish flags from Earliest Times''. Academy Press, Dublin. {{ISBN|978-0-906187-01-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The 'triple crown' motif has been traditionally associated with [[St. Edmund]], the Saxon king of [[East Anglia]] (855–869) who is today one of the patron saints of England. The flag of East Anglia was a [[St. George's Cross]] with a blue coat of arms featuring three gold crowns – visually similar to the arms of the province of [[Munster]]. In his work 'Vicissitudes of Families', [[Bernard Burke]], the [[Ulster King of Arms]], proposed that St. Edmund's Banner was borne during the Norman Invasion of Ireland. A section of [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral in Dublin]] is dedicated to St. Edmund, although his iconography is not displayed. || The banner of the [[Lordship of Ireland]] was based on the arms and feature three golden crowns ordered vertically on a blue background with a white border. It is blazoned:  "Azure, three crowns in pale Or, bordure Argent."

|-
| {{ListFlag|St Patrick's saltire.svg}} || 1783–1801 || The [[St. Patrick's Saltire]], also known as the '''Cross of St Patrick''', after [[Saint Patrick]], the main patron saint of Ireland. "The Saltire became an established Irish symbol in 1783 with the founding of the [[Order of Saint Patrick]] by [[King George III]] to mark the legislative independence of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] which lasted from 1783 to 1801. The Saltire is believed to derive from the arms of the [[FitzGerald dynasty|FitzGeralds]] who were the [[Earls of Kildare]] and later [[Dukes of Leinster]]. Incidentally, [[Kildare County Council]] uses the Saltire on its coat of arms, as do [[Cork City]] and [[Trinity College Dublin]], that both feature two flags –  [[St. George's Cross]] and St. Patrick's Saltire. The flags of [[Queen's University Belfast]] and the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]] use the symbol and it can also be found on the badge of the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI)".&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Genealogical Society of Ireland (2015). ''Flagging Ireland: Irish Guide to Flag Design". Dublin. {{ISBN|978-1-898471-03-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The flag has been used for almost 30 years by local authorities in [[Downpatrick]] for [[St. Patrick's Day]]. In addition, [[Church of Ireland]] flies this flag on special religious days throughout the island.  The Saltire represents 'Ireland' in the flag of the United Kingdom. || The [[Saint Patrick's Saltire]] features a red [[saltire]] on a white field. In heraldry these arms are blazoned: "Argent, a saltire gules".
|-
| {{ListFlag|Flag of Leinster (bright).svg}}&lt;br&gt;{{ListFlag|Green harp flag of Ireland.svg}} || ??-present || The [[green harp flag]] of the 17th century [[Confederacy of Ireland]] and an unofficial flag of Ireland during the 18th and 19th century.

|-
| {{ListFlag|Ulster banner.svg}} || 1953–1972 || The '''[[Ulster Banner]]''', also known as the '''Ulster flag''' or the '''Red Hand of Ulster flag''', was the flag of the [[Government of Northern Ireland]] between 1953 and 1972. It was adopted in 1953 in honour of the [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]] and was based on the arms that were granted to the [[Government of Northern Ireland]] in 1924 by the [[Ulster King of Arms]] based in Dublin Castle. The flag lost its official status in 1972 when the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] was abolished by the British government and since then there has been no 'official flag' for [[Northern Ireland]]. However, internationally, the flag is still used officially for sporting fixtures and events, such as the [[Commonwealth Games]] and by [[FIFA]] to represent the [[Northern Ireland national football team]]. Internally, the flag continues to be used by a number of local authorities and remains a divisive issue as it is mainly a symbol of [[Ulster loyalism]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; || The flag is a heraldic banner and features the [[Red Hand of Ulster]], a six-pointed star for the six counties of [[Northern Ireland]] and the British Crown on a [[St. George's Cross]].

| {{ListFlag|Flag of the President of Ireland.svg}} || 1945–present || The [[Presidential Standard (Ireland)|Standard of the President of Ireland]] was adopted in 1945, after the establishment of the Office of the [[President of Ireland]] (Uachtarán na hÉireann) in 1937. "This flag was approved by the Government on 13 February 1945. A number of technical decisions were made at the same time, including the decision that... the strings of the harp be yellow (in settlement of the question raised by [[Edward MacLysaght]], who had insisted that the strings should be white)".&lt;ref&gt;Ó Brógáin, Séamus.

| {{ListFlag|Flag of Ulster.svg}} || || [[Flag of Ulster]] ||
The arms of the nine-county province of Ulster form a composite achievement, combining the heraldic symbols of two of that province's best known families, namely the cross of de Burgo and the dexter hand of O Neill (Ua Néill, later Ó Néill) Kings of Ailech and Tír Eoghan.
|-
| {{ListFlag|Flag of Munster.svg}} || || [[Flag of Munster]] ||
The province of Munster has been heraldically symbolised by three golden antique crowns on an azure blue shield. A crown of the type now known as '''antique Irish''' forms an integral element of a thirteenth-century crozier head found near Cormac's Chapel on the Rock of Cashel. In the case of the 'king-bishops' of Cashel, the placing of the antique crown on their crozier was a symbolic assertion of their right to the political sovereignty of Munster.
|-
| {{ListFlag|Flag of Connacht.svg}} || || [[Flag of Connacht]] ||
The arms of Connacht use a dimidiated (divided in half from top to bottom) eagle and armed hand.

|-
| {{ListFlag|Flag of Leinster.svg}} || || [[Flag of Leinster]] ||
A silver stringed golden harp on a green background. Possibly the oldest and certainly the most celebrated instance of the use of the harp device on a green field was the flag of Owen Roe O'Neill. It is recorded that his ship, the ''St Francis'', as she lay at anchor at Dunkirk, flew from her mast top 'the Irish harp in a green field, in a flag'.
|-
| {{ListFlag|Flag of Mide.svg}} || No history of flag use|| The ancient [[Kingdom of Meath]] (Mide) was represented by the [[Flag and coat of arms of Mide|emblem]] of a king seated on a throne. There is no history of a flag ever being used, however an emblem was used which derived from iconography rather than classic heraldry. "The old province of Meath, which is nearly coextensive with the present day Diocese of Meath, is heraldically personified by a representation of a royal personage seated on a throne... It is, of course, fitting that Meath, wherein stood Tara, the symbolic site of the Kingship of Ireland, should be shown heraldically by a representation of a royal personage, or majesty, seated on a throne. The arms of Meath were apparently used at one time as the arms of Ireland, i.e. a majesty on a sable (black) background, the provincial arms being displayed on an azure (blue) field".&lt;ref&gt;National Library of Ireland Heraldry in Ireland&lt;/ref&gt; || The [[Flag and coat of arms of Mide|flag of Mide]] features a light blue field with a king sitting on a throne. The sceptre and outstretched right hand symbolise sovereignty and justice respectively. Today this emblem is used by the [[Meath GAA]] team but not the [[Meath County Council]].

| {{ListFlag|IRL Dublin flag.svg}} || 1885–present || The flag of [[Dublin|Dublin City]] was adopted in 1885 by the [[Dublin Corporation]]. In the [[canton (flag)|canton]] it features 'three burning castles' which are part of the coat of arms of the city that were officially granted in 1607 by the Ulster King of Arms, Daniel Molyneux. The arms was a corruption of the earlier seal of Dublin that featured one castle with three watchtowers on the obverse and a ship on the reverse, whose earliest mention was in 1230. The seal of Dublin was based on the arms of Bristol as King Henry II granted the city to his men of Bristol with the 1171 Charter. This meant that Bristol merchants took control of colonisation of the Dublin city after the Norman invasion of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Signage at the Dublin's City Hall's "The Story of the Capital" museum&lt;/ref&gt; The flag is flown over [[Dublin City Hall]], the [[Mansion House, Dublin|Mansion House]] and around the city, both indoors as well as outdoors. It acts as the de facto flag of the [[Dublin City Council]]. || The flag of [[Dublin|Dublin City]] features a green field with a gold harp and three white two-towered burning castles on a navy canton. The gold harp represents both Ireland and Leinster, while the three burning castles are the lesser coat of arms of the city. Green and blue are the two national colours of Ireland. 
|-
| {{ListFlag|Flag of Belfast.svg}} || 1890–present || Flag of [[Belfast]] is a heraldic banner that is based on the shield of the coat of arms of the city. The arms were granted in 1890, two years after Belfast was awarded city status by [[Queen Victoria]]. Although the banner was adopted in 1890, it has seldom been used. "The precise origins and meanings of the symbols contained on the Coat of Arms are unknown. But images such as the bell, the seahorse, the ship and the chained wolf were all used by 17th-century Belfast merchants on their signs and coinage. The seahorse, which is used twice, shows the maritime importance of Belfast, as does the ship at the base of the shield".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/tourism-venues/cityhall/coatofarms.aspx|title=Belfast Coat of Arms|website=Belfastcity.gov.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921011239/http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/tourism-venues/cityhall/coatofarms.aspx|archivedate=21 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  || The flag of [[Belfast]] is a horizontal bicolour of white and light blue. It features a silver bell in a red canton, a triangle of [[Tincture (heraldry)|Vair]](type of heraldic pattern) and a ship on waves with a [[Saint Patrick's Saltire]] as a [[naval ensign]] and masthead. 
|-
| {{ListFlag|Drogheda Flag.svg}} || 2012–present || Flag of [[Drogheda|Drogheda town]] was adopted by Drogheda Borough Council in 2012 and features a triband of red and black which are considered to be the 'town colours' and the coat of arms of Drogheda town. The exact origins of the arms are obscure due to the records being lost in a fire. Some believe that the 'castle and ship' element on the shield is derived from the arms of Bristol, in the same way as the 13th century Dublin seal. Others feel that the castle represents [[Saint Laurence Gate]], while the ship stands for the [[river Boyne]] and Drogheda port. The 'star and crescent' emblem has the same origin as the coat of arms of [[Portsmouth]] and is taken from the arms of [[Richard I of England]] (Lionheart) who adopted it during the [[Third Crusade]]. The three lions 'passant guardant' are also derived from Richard I who began to use the emblem in 1198 to represent his position as King of the English, [[Duke of Normandy|Duke of the Normans]] and [[Duke of Aquitaine|Duke of the Aquitaines]]. These emblems honour the king, during whose reign Drogheda was granted its charter in 1194 by Hugh de Lacy. Since the 'Local Government Reform Act 2014' that came into effect from 1 June 2014, Drogheda Borough Council no longer exists and is now part of [[Louth County Council]].  || The flag is a vertical triband of red-black-red and features the coat of arms of [[Drogheda]] in the centre. The town's motto reads: Deus praesidium, mercatura decustranslates, which means "God our strength, merchandise our glory".
|-
|{{ListFlag|Mountains to the Sea Flag.svg}} || 2013–present || The unofficial flag of [[Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council]] was adopted in August 2014. It was originally designed and used for Bratacha 2013 – Ireland's first ever 'Festival of Flags and Emblems'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.familyhistory.ie/docs/other/Bratacha_2013_brochure.pdf|format=PDF|title=Bratacha 2013 Brochure|website=Familyhistory.ie|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design concept was based on a combination of the [[Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council]] emblem, the coat of arms and on a loose translation of the County motto: Ó Chuan go Sliabh, meaning ‘from harbour to mountain’. Today the flag flies every weekend at the County Hall in the town of [[Dún Laoghaire]]. || The unofficial flag of [[Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council]] has a yellow field and features a green shamrock with two strokes – green and blue. The green stroke represents the mountains, while the blue one stands for the sea. This reflects the fact that the County is bordered by the [[Irish Sea]] and the [[Wicklow Mountains]].

{{Politics of Bhutan}}

[[Bhutan]] was founded and unified as a country by [[Ngawang Namgyal]], 1st [[Zhabdrung Rinpoche]] in the mid–17th century. After his death in 1651, Bhutan nominally followed his recommended "[[dual system of government]]". Under the dual system, government control was split between a civil administrative leader, the [[Druk Desi]] ({{lang|dz|{{bo-textonly|འབྲུག་སྡེ་སྲིད་}}}}, aka ''Deb Raja'');&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The original title is {{lang|dz|{{bo-textonly|སྡེ་སྲིད་ཕྱག་མཛོད}}}}་; {{transl|dz|desi chhak zod}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a religious leader, the [[Je Khenpo]] ({{lang|dz|{{bo-textonly|རྗེ་མཁན་པོ་}}}}).

Both the Druk Desi and Je Khenpo were under the nominal authority of the Zhabdrung Rinpoche, a reincarnation of Ngawang Namgyal. In practice however, the Zhabdrung was often a child under the control of the Druk Desi, and regional [[penlop]]s often administered their districts in defiance of the power of the Druk Desis until the rise of the unified [[House of Wangchuck]] in 1907.&lt;ref name=USLCCS1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Worden |first1=Robert L. |last2=Savada |first2=Andrea Matles (ed.) |title=Nepal and Bhutan: Country Studies |chapter=Chapter 6 – Bhutan: Administrative Integration and Conflict with Tibet, 1651–1728 |edition=3rd |year=1991 |publisher=Federal Research Division, [[United States Library of Congress]] |isbn=0-8444-0777-1 |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/bttoc.html |accessdate=27 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the rise of the unified House of Wangchuck in 1907, the [[Druk Gyalpo]] ({{lang|dz|{{bo-textonly|འབྲུག་རྒྱལ་པོ་}}}}; lit. "[[Druk|Dragon]] King") have been the [[head of state]] of the [[Bhutan|Kingdom of Bhutan]].

==Druk Desis (1650–1905)==
{{main|Druk Desi}}
Below appears the list of [[Druk Desi]]s throughout the existence of the office. Officeholders were initially appointed by [[Zhabdrung Rinpoche|Zhabdrung]] [[Ngawang Namgyal]], though after his death the [[Je Khenpo]] and civil government decided appointments.

Italics indicate coregencies and caretaker governments, which are not traditionally separately numbered.

==Kings of Bhutan (1907–present)==
{{main|Druk Gyalpo|House of Wangchuck}}
The Bhutanese monarchy was established in 1907, unifying the country under the control of the [[House of Wangchuck|Wangchuck family]], hereditary ''[[penlop]]s'' (governors) of [[Trongsa]] district.  The king of Bhutan, formally known as the [[Druk Gyalpo]] ("Dragon King"), also occupies the office of Druk Desi under the [[dual system of government]]. Since the enactment of the [[Constitution of Bhutan|Constitution of 2008]], the Druk Gyalpo has remained [[head of state]], while the [[Prime Minister of Bhutan]] acts as executive and [[head of government]] in a [[parliamentary democracy]].&lt;ref name=CoBE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.bt/TsaThrim%20Eng%20(A5).pdf |title=The Constitution of the Kingdom of Bhutan |format=PDF |date=18 July 2008 |publisher=Government of Bhutan |accessdate=8 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706162637/http://www.constitution.bt/TsaThrim%20Eng%20%28A5%29.pdf |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mt. Elbert.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Mount Elbert]] in the [[Sawatch Range]] is the [[Elevation|highest]] [[summit]] of the [[Rocky Mountains]] and the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Colorado|State of Colorado]].]]

The following sortable table comprises the 62 [[Summit|peaks]] of the [[Rocky Mountains]] of [[North America]] with at least {{convert|4000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[elevation]] and at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]].&lt;ref name=major&gt;This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]], and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  All summits in this article have at least 500&amp;nbsp;meters of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[summit]] of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=NAVD_88&gt;All elevations in the 48 [[U.S. state|states]] of the [[contiguous United States]] include an elevation adjustment from the [[National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929]] ([[NGVD 29]]) to the [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988]] ([[NAVD 88]]).  For further information, please see this [[United States National Geodetic Survey]] [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WhatVD29VD88 note].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is the [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]].  The summit may be near its key col or quite far away.  The key col for [[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Isthmus of Rivas]] in [[Nicaragua]], {{convert|7642|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} away.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range/&gt;
#The [[topographic isolation]] (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;ref name=isolation&gt;The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the [[great-circle distance]] to its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Rocky Mountains, the following 62 major summits exceed {{convert|4000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} elevation, 137 exceed {{convert|3500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, and [[List of the major 3000-meter summits of the Rocky Mountains|184 exceed {{convert|3000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} elevation]].

'''Location awareness''' refers to devices that can passively or actively determine their location. [[Navigational instrument]]s provide location coordinates for vessels and vehicles. Surveying equipment identifies location with respect to a well-known locationa [[wireless communications]] device. ''Network location awareness'' (NLA) describes the location of a node in a network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.blackviper.com/wiki/Network_Location_Awareness_%28NLA%29 Network location awareness]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms740123%28VS.85%29.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The term applies to [[navigation|navigating]], [[location (geography)|real-time locating]] and positioning support with global, regional or local scope. The term has been applied to [[traffic]], [[logistics]], [[business administration]] and [[leisure]] applications. Location awareness is supported by [[Radar|navigation systems]], [[radar tracker|positioning systems]] and/or [[Real-time locating system|locating services]].

Location awareness without the active participation of the device is known as non-cooperative locating or detection.

== History of terminology ==
The term originated for [[configurations]] settings of [[computer network|network]] systems and addressed network entities. ''Network location awareness'' (NLA) services collect network configuration and location information, and notify applications when this information changes. With the advent of [[global positioning system]]s and radio-equipped mobile devices, the term was redefined to include consumer-focused applications.

While location awareness began as a matter of static user location, the notion was extended to reflect movement. Context models have been proposed&lt;ref name="curino-context2007"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cristiana Bolchini and Carlo A. Curino and Elisa Quintarelli and Fabio A. Schreiber and Letizia Tanca |title=A data-oriented survey of context models |url=http://carlo.curino.us/documents/curino-context2007-survey.pdf |format=PDF |journal=SIGMOD Rec. |volume=36 |issue=4 |year=2007 |issn=0163-5808 |pages=19–26 |doi=10.1145/1361348.1361353 |publisher=ACM |location=New York, NY, USA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424051627/http://carlo.curino.us/documents/curino-context2007-survey.pdf |archivedate=April 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to support context-aware applications which use location to tailor interfaces, refine application-relevant data, increase the precision of information retrieval, discover services, make user interaction implicit and build smart environments. For example, a location-aware mobile phone may confirm that it is currently in a building.&lt;ref name="schmidt1999a"&gt;{{cite conference

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Determining location ==
Description in '''logical terms''' uses a structured textual form. International standardisation offers a common method using ISO/TS 16952&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=38178 |title=ISO/TS 16952-1:2006 Technical product documentation - Reference designation system - Part 1: General application rules |publisher=Iso.org |date=2012-07-11 |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; as originated with German standards DIN EN 61346&lt;ref&gt;DIN EN 61346 Industrielle Systeme, Anlagen und Ausrüstungen und Industrieprodukte – Strukturierungsprinzipien und Referenzkennzeichnung&lt;/ref&gt; and DIN EN 81346.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dke.din.de/cmd?bcrumblevel=1&amp;contextid=dke&amp;subcommitteeid=54759251&amp;projid=103797592&amp;level=tpl-proj-detailansicht&amp;committeeid=54738887&amp;languageid=de |title=Industrielle Systeme, Anlagen und Ausrüstungen und Industrieprodukte - Strukturierungsprinzipien und Referenzkennzeichnung - Teil 1: Allgemeine Regeln (IEC 81346-1:2009) |publisher=Dke.din.de |date=2007-05-29 |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Location in '''mathematical terms''' offers coordinates that refer to a nominated point of [[reference]].

Location in '''network terms''' relates to locating network nodes. These include:

* ITU switched line access addressing according to [[International Telecommunications Union]] Q-Series standards, Telecommunications [[Signaling System#7]] (SS7)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=tsbmail |url=http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-Q/e |title=International Telecommunications Union Q-Series Standards, Signalling and Switching |publisher=Itu.int |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mirroring [[ANSI]] Standards T1.110—General Information and subsequent standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tekelec.com/ss7/itu.asp |title=ANSI Standard T1.110 |publisher=Tekelec.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
"Crisp" locating offers precise coordinates, using wireless signals or optical sighting, possibly with phase angle measurements. Coordinates are relative to either a standardized system of coordinates, e.g. [[WGS84]], or a fixed object such as a building plan. [[Real-time locating system|Real-time locating]] adds timely delivery of results, especially for moving targets. Real time locating is defined with [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 19762-5 and ISO/IEC 24730-1.&lt;ref name="malik2009"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fuzzy locating]] offers less precision, e.g., presence "near" a point of reference. Measuring wireless power levels can supply this degree of precision. Less sophisticated systems can use wireless distance measurements to estimate a point of reference in [[polar coordinate]]s (distance and direction) from another site. Index locating indicates presence at a known location, as with fixed [[RFID]] readers and RFID tags.&lt;ref name="sweeney2006"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Location-aware systems address the acquisition of coordinates in a grid (for example using distance metrics and lateration algorithms) or at least distances to reference points (for example discriminating presence at a certain choke point on a corridor or in a room of a building).&lt;ref name="schmidt2003phd"&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Navigation ===
[[Navigation]] and reckoning are key concerns for [[seafarer]]s, [[aviator]]s and professional drivers. The task is to dynamically determine the current location and the time, distance and direction to destination. [[radar]] served for regional demand and [[NAVSTAR]] satellite systems for global demand. [[GPS]] and similar systems have become ubituitous in long-haul transport operation and are  becoming a standard automobile feature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wm-user.de/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=76 Test TomTom Navigator 6] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228155025/http://www.wm-user.de/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=76 |date=December 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surveying ===
[[Surveying]] is the static complement to navigating. It is essential for delineating land ownership and for [[architect]]s and [[civil engineer]]s designing construction projects. Optical surveying technology preceded [[LASER]] [[triangulation|triangulating]] aids.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rlehmann.ch/data/Das_neue_Messen_2-14.pdf Das neue Messen] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707001918/http://www.rlehmann.ch/data/Das_neue_Messen_2-14.pdf |date=July 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business process ===
Currently location awareness is applied to design innovative [[process control]]s, and is integral to [[ubiquitous computing|ubiquitous]] and [[wearable computer|wearable computing]]. On mobile devices, location aware [[search algorithm|search]] can prioritize results that are close to the device. Conversely, the device location can be disclosed to others, at some cost to the bearer's privacy.&lt;ref name="schmidt1999b"&gt;{{cite journal

=== Warehouse and routing ===
RFID provides a time/location reference for an object, but does not indicate that the object remains at that location, which is sufficient for applications that limit access, such as tracking objects entering and leaving a warehouse, or for objects moving on a fixed route, such as charging tolls for crossing a bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfid-basis.de/article-00146.html |title=Fünf Jahre nach dem RFID-Hype erste Ernüchterung |publisher=Rfid-basis.de |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rosemann2006"&gt;{{cite conference

=== Consumer ===
Location awareness enables new applications for ubiquitous computing systems and [[mobile phone]]s. Such applications include the automatic reconfiguration of a computing device to suit the location in which it is currently being used (examples include [http://www.controlplaneapp.com ControlPlane] and [http://www.45rpmsoftware.com/locamatic.php Locamatic]), or publishing a user's location to appropriate members of a social network, and allowing retailers to publish special offers to potential customers who are near to the retailers. Allegedly, individuals gain [[self confidence]] with confirmation of current [[Tracking (Scouting)|whereabouts]].&lt;ref name="blank1989"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Infrastructure ==
While governments have created global systems for computing locations, independent localized systems exist at scales ranging from one building to sub-national regions.

=== Local ===
Such solutions may apply concepts of [[Real-time locating system|RTLS]] and [[WPAN]], [[wireless LAN]] or [[DECT]], with results in proprietary terms of [[floor plan]]s or room numbers. Local systems degrade as distance from the locality increases. Applications include the automatic reconfiguration of a computing device to suit the location in which it is currently being used.

=== Regional ===
This approach uses for example mobile phone systems, such as [[3GPP]], [[GSM]] or [[3GPP Long Term Evolution|LTE]], typically returning information in standardized coordinates as with WGS84 in standardized formats such as [[National Marine Electronics Association|NMEA]] for outdoor usage or in symbolic coordinates referring to street addresses.

=== Global ===
This approach relies on [[GPS]] technology, currently supplied by NAVSTAR and may in future employ the pending [[Galileo (satellite navigation)]] system, generally adopting WGS84 and NMEA. Applications include [[Avalanche|avalanche rescue]] or [[emergency]] and [[mountain rescue]] as well as with [[search and rescue]], (SAR) and [[combat search and rescue]], (CSAR).

[[File:Merichleri location in Bulgaria.png|thumb|350px|Locator map of '''Merichleri''' in South-central [[Bulgaria]].]]
'''Merichleri''' — ({{Lang-bg|Меричлери}}) — is a small town located in the [[Dimitrovgrad Municipality, Bulgaria|Dimitrovgrad Municipality]] of [[Haskovo Province]], within South-central [[Bulgaria]]. &lt;ref name="merichleri"&gt;[http://bulgariatravel.org/en/object/410/Merichleri Portal of Bulgaria—Merichleri] . accessed 6.1.2012&lt;/ref&gt;
 
It is located near the [[Maritsa River]], at {{convert|150|m|ft}} in altitude.&lt;ref name="merichleri"/&gt;  The population of the town was 2,011 residents, in 2006. 

==Features==
===Mineral springs===
There are [[mineral spring]]s in the locale, of healing and spa importance since the ancient [[Thracian]]s.  &lt;ref name="merichleri"/&gt;  The mineral water is mainly characterized as moderately mineralized hyper-thermal, and was used in ancient Greek and Thracian [[natural medicine]] for treatment of diseases and poisoning. &lt;ref name="merichleri"/&gt; The contemporary natural medicine [[balneology]] resort facility is near the town center. &lt;ref name="merichleri"/&gt;

Land art sculpture

The artist Dan Tenev created a huge [[Land art]] sculptural installation in Merichleri, titled [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Land_art_Dan_Tenev_Numerical_rows Numerical Rows]. It was completed in 2010.

'''Moorook Game Reserve''' is a [[protected area]] in the Australian state of [[South Australia]] covering the floodplain on the south side of the [[River Murray]]  immediately south of the section of the [[Sturt Highway]] that passes between the towns of [[Kingston-on-Murray]] in the west and [[Cobdogla]] in the east.  It is located about {{convert|180|km|abbr=off}} east north-east of the state capital of [[Adelaide city centre|Adelaide]].  It was proclaimed on 2 September 1976.  The [[Loch Luna Game Reserve]] immediately adjoins the game reserve’s northern boundary.  It and the Loch Luna Game Reserve are reported as providing "significant wildlife habitat and are popular recreation sites, particularly for river-based activities and camping."  The game reserve is classified as an [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] [[IUCN protected area categories#Category VI – Protected Area with sustainable use of natural resources|Category VI protected area]].&lt;ref name=gazateer&gt;{{Gazetteer of Australia|name= Moorook Game Reserve |feature= SA0046161 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Resource Conservation and Management Group, DENR | title= Moorook Game Reserve management plan | url=http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/files/40242488-31c8-4240-89d0-9e4f00b1c0fd/PARKS_PDFS_MOOROOK_LOCHLUNA_MP.pdf|publication-date=1994|pages=2 &amp; 3 | publisher= Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) | isbn=0-7308-2746-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Boating Industry Association of South Australia (BIA) | author2=South Australia.

A '''nautical mile''' (also known as an air mile) is a [[units of measurement|unit of measurement]] defined as exactly {{convert|1852|m|ft mi|sigfig=6|lk=on|sp=}}. 

Historically, it was defined as  [[Minute and second of arc#Cartography|one minute of latitude]], which is one sixtieth of a degree of [[latitude]] – i.e. the [[Earth's circumference|polar circumference]] of 40,075.017 km x {{sfrac|1|60}} x {{sfrac|1|360}} = {{convert|1855.3|m|ft|lk=off}}; this is known as the [[geographical mile]]. 

It is a non-[[International System of Units|SI]] unit&lt;ref name="BIPM"/&gt; which today has a continued use in both air and marine [[navigation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/science/mile|title=mile {{!}} unit of measurement|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for the definition of [[territorial waters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part2.htm|title=UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA|website=www.un.org|accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One tenth of a nautical mile is a [[cable length]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Fenna | first= Donald | year = 2002 | contribution = cable, cable length, cable's length | title = A Dictionary of Weights, Measures, and Units |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZfGWl-RCQcC |contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZfGWl-RCQcC&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | location = Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press |pages=35,  | isbn = 0-19-860522-6 |oclc=62608533 |access-date=12 January 2017}}.

== History ==
The word mile is from the [[Latin]] word for a thousand paces: [[Mile#Roman mile|mille passus]]. Navigation at sea was done by eye&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3407500195.html|title=Mile, Nautical and Statute – FREE Mile, Nautical and Statute information {{!}} Encyclopedia.com: Find Mile, Nautical and Statute research|website=www.encyclopedia.com|accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; until around 1500 when navigational instruments were developed and cartographers began using a [[coordinate system]] with [[Circle of latitude|parallels]] of [[latitude]] and [[Meridian (geography)|meridians]] of [[longitude]]. In 1617 the Dutch scientist [[Willebrord Snellius|Willebrord Snell]] assessed the circumference of the Earth at 24,630 Roman miles (24,024 statute miles). Around that time British mathematician [[Edmund Gunter]] improved navigational tools including a new [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] to determine latitude at sea. He reasoned that the lines of latitude could be used as the basis for a unit of measurement for [[distance]] and proposed the nautical mile as one minute or one-sixtieth ({{sfrac|1|60}}) of one [[Degree (angle)|degree]] of latitude. As one degree is {{sfrac|1|360}} of a circle, one minute of arc is {{sfrac|1|21600}} of a circle (or, in [[radian]]s, {{sfrac|{{pi}}|10800}}). These [[sexagesimal]] (base 60) units originated in [[Babylonian astronomy]]. Gunter used Snell's circumference to define a nautical mile as 6,080 feet, the length of one minute of arc at 48 degrees latitude. Since the earth is not a perfect sphere but is an [[oblate spheroid]] with slightly flattened poles, a minute of latitude is not constant, but about {{convert|1861|m|ft|-1}} at the poles and {{convert|1843|m|ft|-1}} at the [[Equator]],&lt;ref name="BIPM" /&gt; with a [[mean]] value of {{convert|1852.3|m|ft}}. Latitude and Longitude are equivalent or "square" at the Equator. Other countries measure the minute of arc at 45 degrees latitude, giving the nautical mile a length of {{convert|6076|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1929, the international nautical mile was defined by the First International Extraordinary Hydrographic Conference in [[Monaco]] as precisely 1,852 metres.&lt;ref name="BIPM" /&gt;

[[Imperial units]] and [[United States customary units]] used a definition of the nautical mile based on the Clarke (1866) Spheroid. The United States nautical mile was defined as {{convert|6,080.20|ft|m}} based in the [[Mendenhall Order]] [[foot (unit)|foot]] of 1893. It was abandoned in favour of the international nautical mile in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://geodesy.noaa.gov/PUBS_LIB/FedRegister/FRdoc59-5442.pdf|title=Refinement of values for the yard and the pound|last1=Astin|first1=A.V.|last2=Karo|first2=H. Arnold|date=June 25, 1959|website=NOAA|publisher=National Bureau of Standards|accessdate=2018-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Imperial nautical mile, often called an [[Admiralty]] mile, or more correctly, an Admiralty measured mile, was defined by its relation to the Admiralty knot, 6,080 imperial feet per hour, so 1 imperial nautical mile is about 1,853.181 metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sizes.com/units/mile_imperial_naut.htm|title=imperial nautical mile|website=sizes.com|accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was abandoned in 1970 and, legally, references to the obsolete unit are now converted to 1,853 metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1995/1804/schedule/made|title=The Units of Measurement Regulations 1995|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the existence of precise modern definitions, in the early 21st century the old definitions are still in use. The [[Royal Yachting Association]] says in its manual for [[Day Skipper|day skipper]]s: "1 (minute) of Latitude = 1 sea mile", followed by "For most practical purposes distance is measured from the latitude scale, assuming that one minute of latitude equals one nautical mile".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hopkinson|first=Sara|title=RYA day skipper handbook - sail|year=2012|isbn=9781-9051-04949|publisher=The Royal Yachting Association|place=Hamble|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Greek myth}}
In [[Greek mythology]], the mountainous district of '''Nysa''' ({{lang-el|Νῦσα}}), variously associated with [[Ethiopia]], [[Libya]], [[Tribalia]], [[India]] or [[Arabia]] by [[Greece|Greek]] [[Mythography|mythographers]], was the traditional place where the rain [[nymphs]], the [[Hyades (mythology)|Hyades]], raised the infant [[God (male deity)|god]] [[Dionysus]], the "[[Zeus]] of Nysa". 

==Overview==
Though the worship of Dionysus came into mainland Greece from [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] (where the [[Hittites]] called themselves "Nesi" and their language "Nesili"), the various locations assigned to Nysa may simply be conventions to show that a romantically remote and mythical land was envisaged. The name ''Nysa'' may even be an invention to explain the god's name. Even Homer mentions the mountain Nyseion as the place where Dionysus, under the protection of the nymphs, grew up. [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]] [[Alexandria|of Alexandria]] (5th century [[Byzantine]] lexicon) gives a list of the following locations proposed by ancient authors as the site of Mount Nysa: Arabia, Ethiopia, [[Egypt]], [[Babylon]], Erythraian Sea (the [[Red Sea]]), [[Thrace]], [[Thessaly]], [[Cilicia]], [[India]], Libya, [[Lydia]], [[Macedon]]ia, [[Naxos Island|Naxos]], around Pangaios (mythical island south of Arabia), [[Syria]]. On his return from Nysa to join his fellow Olympians, Dionysus brought the [[entheogen]] [[wine]].

According to [[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]], "Meros is said by the Greeks to have been a mountain in India, on which their Dionysos was born, and that [[Mount Meru|Meru]], though it generally means the north pole in Indian geography, is also a mountain near the city of Naishada or Nysa, called by the Greek geographers Dionysopolis, and universally celebrated in the Sanskrit poems".

During the [[Hellenistic]] period, "Nysa" was personified as Dionysus' nursemaid, and she was said to be buried at the town of [[Beit She'an|Scythopolis]] ([[Beit She'an]]) in [[Israel]], which claimed Dionysus as its founder.

'''Pallas-Yllästunturi National Park''' ({{lang-fi|Pallas-Yllästunturin kansallispuisto}}) is the third-largest [[national park]] in [[Finland]], covering {{convert|1020|km2|sqmi|0}}. It is located in the [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]] region, in the municipalities of [[Enontekiö]], [[Kittilä]], [[Kolari]] and [[Muonio]]. It was established in 2005, when Pallas-Ounastunturi National Park (suggested 1910 and established 1938, as one of the first national parks of the country&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalparks.fi/pallas-yllastunturinp/history History of Pallas-Yllästunturi National Park]&lt;/ref&gt;) was joined with Ylläs-Aakenus Protected Area. Fell chain across the National Park is almost {{convert|100|km|mi|-1}} long. The highest fell [[Taivaskero]] {{convert|807|m|ft}} masl is located in middle, in Pallas area.

The high [[fell]]s of the park are the southernmost place to see some [[arctic]] species in Finland. Most of the park consists of primeval forests and various types of [[muskeg]].

'''Pierre Ange François-Xavier Faure''' (1777, [[Nantes]] – 1855) was a French geographer who participated in the [[Baudin expedition to Australia|expedition to the South Seas]] that [[Nicolas Baudin]] led between 1800 and 1803 and that was back in March 1804 in [[Lorient]]. 

Installed first on the ''[[French corvette Naturaliste|Naturaliste]]'' during this [[European and American voyages of scientific exploration|voyage of scientific exploration]], he was the first to see and draw the plan of [[Faure Island]], an island in [[Shark Bay]] on the Western Australian coast to which the expedition gave his name.

He boarded the ''[[French corvette Géographe|Géographe]]'' at [[Port Jackson]] on 3 November 1802. On 15 décembre 1803, at his request, he left the end of the expedition when it stopped at [[île Maurice|île de France]] on its return.

Pierre Faure was a corresponding member of the [[Société des observateurs de l'homme]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7821">'''Pêro de Anaia''' or '''Pedro d'Anaya''' or '''Anhaya''' or '''da Nhaya''' or '''da Naia''' (died March 1506) was a [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]]-[[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] 16th-century knight, who established and became the first captain-major of the Portuguese [[Fort São Caetano]] in [[Sofala]], and thus the first [[List of colonial heads of Mozambique|colonial governor]] of [[Portuguese East Africa]] (Mozambique).

== Background ==

According to chronicler  [[João de Barros]], Pêro de Anaia was the son of [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] nobleman Diego de Anaya, who fought in the [[War of the Castilian Succession|Castilian civil war]] of the 1470s for the Beltraneja party, alongside King [[Afonso V of Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;Barros (v.2, p.360)&lt;/ref&gt;  He moved or was exiled to [[Portugal]] at the conclusion of that war.  His son Pêro de Anaia became a knight of the Portuguese king's household.

== Expedition to Sofala ==

{{Main|Portuguese expedition to Sofala (Anaia, 1505)}}

In early 1505, King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] assigned Pêro de Anaia the duty of establishing a permanent Portuguese fortress and [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] in the East African town of [[Sofala]], at that time a reluctant vassal of the [[Kilwa Sultanate]] and major entrepot for the [[Monomatapa]] gold trade.

In late March, 1505, Anaia set out with his own ship, the ''Sant'Iago'' (also called the ''Nuncia'') as part of the [[7th Portuguese India Armada (Almeida, 1505)|7th Portuguese India Armada]] commanded by D. [[Francisco de Almeida]].  However, Anaia's ship floundered in the [[Tagus]] estuary upon departure, and he was forced to return to [[Lisbon]]. A new expedition was quickly assembled, and Anaia set out again on May 18, 1505, this time at the head of his own six-ship [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]] bound for Sofala, carrying much building equipment.

After arriving in [[Sofala]] in early September, 1505, his squadron more-or-less intact, Pêro de Anaia secured permission from the ruling sheikh Isuf of [[Sofala]] for permission to erect a Portuguese fortress and factory in the island-city.

== Captain of Sofala ==

[[File:City of Sofala, 1572.jpg|thumb|280px|right|City of [[Sofala]] (''Cefala''), c. 1572, with Fort São Caetano visible]]
By November, 1505 the perimeter of the Portuguese [[Fort São Caetano]] of Sofala was essentially finished and Pêro de Anaia opened the royal credentials assuming the title of ''Capitão-Mor'' (Captain-Major) of the fortress and garrison.

Fort São Caetano was first permanent Portuguese [[colony]] in [[East Africa]], and the kernel of what was to become the Portuguese colonial province of [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]].  Consequently, Pêro de Anaia, being the first 'Captain of Sofala', is generally considered the  first [[List of colonial heads of Mozambique|Portuguese colonial governor of Mozambique]].

As per his instructions, in late January or early February 1506, Pêro  de Anaia dispatched four of his ships to [[Portuguese India]]. He placed the remaining two [[caravel]]s under his son, [[Francisco de Anaia]], to serve  a local coastal patrol (The younger Anaia had a commission as ''capitão-mor do mar de Sofala'').

The beginnings of Fort Sofala were difficult. The Portuguese soon found out they had little or no means to procure food and other supplies.  Moreover, being situated on a mangrove swamp, fevers (probably [[malaria]] and/or [[yellow fever]]) quickly overwhelmed most of the Portuguese garrison. To cap their misfortunes, the hapless younger Anaia crashed both the patrol ships on [[shoal]]s near Mozambique, leaving Fort Sofala without means of securing external supplies or communication.

It was precisely at this moment of great weakness, in late February or early March 1506, that a group of Sofalese nobles who had opposed the Portuguese presence, induced a mainland [[Bantu people|Bantu]] chieftain Moconde to lead an assault on the weakened Portuguese fort.  Pêro de Anaia defended the fort with his handful of remaining healthy soldiers, bolstered by a number of [[Swahili people|Swahili]] auxiliaries.  The besiegers were scattered. In the aftermath, Anaia broke into the royal palace and killed sheikh Isuf of Sofala for conspiring in the treachery (it is said the sheikh Isuf, a blind octogenarian, threw his sword at the sound of footsteps, and managed to wound Anaia, before being himself killed.)

The next day, a revenge attack on Fort Sofala broke down, when rival Sofalese nobles began to quarrel with each other for succession. Somehow Pêro de Anaia managed to play the role of arbitrator, and secured the installation of Isuf's son, Suleiman, as the new sheikh of Sofala. Suleiman promptly put an end to Sofalese intrigues against the Portuguese.

Pêro de Anaia, however, did not survive long. In early March 1506, just a few days after the Bantu assault on the fort, Anaia himself fell victim to the [[malaria]]l fevers and died at [[Sofala]].  The Portuguese [[Factor (agent)|factor]], [[Manuel Fernandes de Meireles]], apparently the only European man immune to the fevers, was elected by what remained of the sick garrison as acting captain of Sofala.

== Aftermath ==

In June 1506, two Portuguese ships of [[Cide Barbudo]] and [[Pedro Quaresma]] arrived in Sofala, hoping to deliver letters from King Manuel I with new instructions for Anaia.  They found Fort Sofala in a terrible shape, most of the garrison dead or dying of fevers and starving for food.  Leaving Quaresma behind to bolster the fort and procure relief, Barbudo rushed to [[Portuguese India]] to deliver his report to the vice-roy D. [[Francisco de Almeida]]. Hearing of the disastrous conditions, Almeida dispatched [[Nuno Vaz Pereira]] to assume the capitaincy of Sofala at the end of 1506 and do what he could to restore its conditions.

Pereira was superseded in September 1507 by [[Vasco Gomes de Abreu]], who had been sent directly by the king from Lisbon.  Abreu took command of Sofala, and directed operations to capture nearby [[Mozambique Island]], which had a much more suitable harbor than the shoals-clogged Sofala.  The Captaincy of Sofala was thus enlarged to include Mozambique Island.  Much of the European garrison and administration was subsequently transferred to healthier Mozambique, and Fort Sofala was effectively reduced to an outpost, although [[List of colonial heads of Mozambique|colonial governors]] of [[Portuguese East Africa]] continued to bear 'Captain of Sofala' as their primary title.

'''Sea Lots''' is an area within [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. It is called  Sea lots because the Government at the time parcelled "[[Land lot|lots]]" of land near the sea. This area is considered part of a group of localities that together are known as [[Laventille]]. Sea Lots, however, though very close to Laventille, is distinct from it.  

Its close proximity to the sea also makes it very close to the port in Port of Spain, and many old and defunct vessels can be seen in the area. There are also various industrial facilities operating locally, so despite the large number of residents (mostly squatters) it is more of an industrial than a residential area. It is also known as a crime ridden community

In 2013, Machel Montano and Morgan Heritage collaborated on the song, "I See Lots", in an attempt to bring attention to the poverty and crime in the area, while showcasing the youth of the Sea Lots, who desperately need financial assistance and higher education.

[[File:Kerguelen-Plateau-Topography.jpg|thumbnail|Kerguelen Plateau Topography]]

A '''submerged continent''' or '''sunken continent''' is a [[continent|continental mass]], extensive in size, but mainly [[underwater|undersea]]. The terminology is used by some [[paleogeologist]]s and [[geographer]]s in reference to some land masses. 

The main examples in this class are the [[Kerguelen Plateau]], [[Seychelles microcontinent]], [[Mauritia (microcontinent)]], and [[Zealandia]]. 

Submerged continents have been sought and speculated about in regard to a possible "[[Lost lands|lost continent]]" underwater in the [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1966/08/21/archives/atlantis-search-shifts-to-aegean-lost-continent-legend-held-based.html ATLANTIS SEARCH SHIFTS TO AEGEAN; Lost Continent Legend Held Based on False Statistics] 1966 New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Ignatius Donnelly has recently published at work in defence of the story that a Continent known among the ancients as Atlantis was sunk in the Atlantic Ocean by an earthquake." ''A Submerged Continent'' April 4, 1882 page 1 Los Angeles Times&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a search in the 1930s for [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]], believed to have possibly been a submerged continent between the Indian and African coasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=x5cQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3JEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4796,4542041&amp;dq=submerged+continent|title=Submerged continent| date=November 28, 1932 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Beginner's Guide''''' is an [[interactive storytelling]] [[video game]] created by Davey Wreden under the studio name Everything Unlimited Ltd. The game was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS X]] and [[Linux]] on October 1, 2015. The game is Wreden's follow-up to the critically praised ''[[The Stanley Parable]]'', his previous interactive storytelling title that was initially released in 2011.

The game is narrated by Wreden and takes the user through a number of incomplete and abstract game creations made by a developer named Coda. Wreden challenges the player to try to come to understand the type of person Coda is from exploring these spaces in a [[first-person perspective]]. Within the narrative, the player discovers that Wreden had tried to force meaning onto Coda's games, causing them to end their relationship. Wreden has stated the game is open to interpretation: some have seen the game as general commentary on the nature of the relationship between game developers and players, while others have taken it as an allegory to Wreden's own personal struggles with success resulting from ''The Stanley Parable''.

The game received mixed to positive reviews. Many reviewers readily took to the narrative and the questions and ideas it raised on game development, while others felt the game forced some of Wreden's thoughts too hard and in a pretentious manner.

==Gameplay==
The gameplay in ''The Beginner's Guide'' is presented in a [[first-person perspective]] allowing the player to move about and explore the environment and interact with some elements of it as they progress along the work's [[interactive storytelling]]. The player hears details of the various scenes they explore via the game's narrator, Wreden himself, to describe what they see and make conclusions on the nature of the games' developer. Some areas include puzzle solving and [[conversation tree]]s, but there is no way for the player-character to die, or the player to make a mistake or lose the game.&lt;ref name="gamespot review"/&gt; The narration helps the player get past certain parts of the game-spaces that were otherwise difficult or insuperable as designed, such as by providing a bridge to cross an invisible maze after the player discovers the difficulty. Once the player has completed a chapter, they can then return to any of them within the game, as well as disable the narration (and the help it provides) to explore the spaces on their own. The game has [[metafiction]]al elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/2016/01/metafiction-games/ | title = The Best New Videogames Are All About … Videogames | first = Jake | last = Muncy | date = January 18, 2016 | website = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | publisher = [[Condé Nast]] | accessdate = January 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:The beginners guide screenshot.png|thumb|right|In one of Coda's games, Wreden as the narrator, by removing the visibility of some walls, shows to the user the numerous inaccessible corridors that were programmed into this game.]]
The concept of the game is based on trying to understand the nature of a person based on exploring files and documents on their computer without any other notes or documentation or knowing this person in the first place. In the game, the player, aided by Wreden's narration, looks to understand that of a game developer named Coda whom Wreden had met at a [[game jam]] in 2009. Coda is considered enigmatic, having created numerous strange game ideas which he has subsequently deleted or stored away and forgotten. The player explores these games, most being [[exploration game]]s developed from 2008 to 2011&lt;ref name="paste review"/&gt; that were only half-created, and is encouraged by Wreden's narration to try to imagine what Coda's personality would be like based on the abstract and unconventional game spaces and ideas.&lt;ref name="eurogamer review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-10-01-the-beginners-guide-review|title=The Beginner's Guide review|work=[[Eurogamer]]|first=Jeffrey|last=Matulef|date=October 1, 2015|accessdate=October 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Beginner's Guide'' is presented in generally chronological order of Coda's prototypes, showing the progression of Coda's work as the developer learned more.&lt;ref name="gamespot review"/&gt;

Wreden's narration explains that he was inspired by many of Coda's game concepts, providing his own analysis on many of the themes he perceived to appear in Coda's games. However, Wreden had seen that many of the games are based on themes of prisons, isolation, and difficulty in communicating with others, and as Coda's games took a darker tone and took much longer to produce, focusing even more strongly on dialogue that implied that game development was no longer a positive activity for Coda. Wreden felt concerned that Coda was feeling depressed and weighed down by game development, and took it upon himself to show some of Coda's game concepts to others to get feedback to help encourage Coda to develop more. However, this in turn led to Coda to draw into seclusion. At some point in 2011, Wreden believed Coda had stopped making games, until he was sent an email with a private link to a final game by Coda.

This game, its design in stark contrast to the others Coda had made, included puzzles that were nearly unsolvable and a door that could not be opened from within the game. Wreden found that when he was able to use various programming tools to bypass these, he ended up in a gallery with a message from Coda directed at him, asking him not to talk to him any more nor to showcase his games to others. The messages implied Coda felt that Wreden mistook the tone of his games as a sign of an emotional struggle and was missing the point of why he had engaged in game design, as well as accusing Wreden with modifying Coda's games to add more symbolism, and that Wreden's actions had betrayed Coda. As a result, Wreden felt terrible about what he had done, and thus reveals that the purpose of ''The Beginner's Guide'' was to try to reconnect to Coda by sharing his games with the public at large and to hope to apologize for his actions.&lt;ref name="boing boing"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://boingboing.net/2015/10/02/the-beginners-guide-is-a-gam.html|title=The Beginner's Guide is a game that doesn't want to be written about|first=Laura|last=Hudson|date=October 2, 2015|accessdate=October 2, 2015|work=[[Boing Boing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game concludes with an [[epilogue]] level with Wreden sparsely narrating about his dependence on [[social validation]], something he saw as the cause for showing Coda's games to other people.

===Interpretations===
Within the game, Wreden states that ''The Beginner's Guide'' is open to interpretation and invites players to share their own theories with him, providing his email address near the start of the game.&lt;ref name="kotaku review"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/the-beginners-guide-tackles-the-fears-we-dont-talk-abou-1734268227|title=The Beginner's Guide Tackles The Fears We Don't Talk About|first=Patrick|last=Klepick|date=October 2, 2015|accessdate=October 2, 2015|work=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One common interpretation is that the game is a metaphor for Wreden's own success and attempts to move past his struggles, with Coda being a fictional developer created for the game. ''[[Destructoid]]'' writer Darren Nakamura points out that for Wreden to publish a game at cost that is claimed to be the work of someone else, released without their permission, would be illegal, and thus providing evidence that Coda must be part of the game's fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.destructoid.com/the-paradox-of-selling-the-beginner-s-guide-313521.phtml | title = The paradox of selling The Beginner's Guide | first = Darren | last = Nakamura | date = October 3, 2015 | accessdate = October 3, 2015 | work = [[Destructoid]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Emanuel Maiberg of ''Motherboard'' theorizes that Coda is in fact Wreden himself, with Coda representing Wreden's own psyche up to and including the release of ''[[The Stanley Parable]]''. Among other hints in the game, Maiberg explains that the name "Coda" can be taken as its definition, meaning "a concluding part of a literary or dramatic work", and the theme of closing one door and moving on repeats frequently in the game. Maiberg also points to one of the game concepts where the player in Coda's game is inundated with abstract figures from the press, and considers how much attention Wreden had received following ''The Stanley Parable''{{'}}s re-release.&lt;ref name="motherboard"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://motherboard.vice.com/read/step-inside-the-labyrinthine-mind-of-a-game-developer-in-the-beginners-guide | title = Step Inside the Labyrinthine Mind of a Game Developer in 'The Beginner's Guide' | first = Emanuel | last = Maiberg | work = Motherboard | publisher = [[Vice Media]] | date = October 1, 2015 | accessdate = October 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Byrd, writing for the ''[[Washington Post]]'', points to blog posts made by Wreden after he had received a great deal of attention following the re-release of ''The Stanley Parable'', and that the game's version of Wreden is really a fictionalized version of himself acting as an [[unreliable narrator]], building upon his own personal experiences from the sudden media spotlight in the relationship between the fictional Wreden and Coda.&lt;ref name="wapost"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2015/10/08/the-beginners-guide-to-blurring-the-lines-between-video-games-and-interactive-art/ | title = ‘The Beginners Guide’ to blurring the lines between video games and interactive art | first = Christopher | last = Byrd | date = October 8, 2015 | accessdate = October 8, 2015 | work = [[Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interactive fiction writer [[Emily Short]] believes that neither Wreden-as-narrator or Coda are to be taken as Wreden's own self, but instead two representative characters of the game player and game developer, respectively, that Wreden attempts to show sympathy for in modern game development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://boingboing.net/2015/10/12/lets-talk-more-about-the-beg.html | title = Let's talk more about The Beginner's Guide, a game about games | work = [[Boing Boing]] | date = October 12, 2015 | accessdate = October 13, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another interpretative theme taken by some is that the game is presented as commentary on the role between the video game developer and their audience. ''[[PC World]]''{{'}}s Hayden Dingman believed the game was designed to demonstrate the fallacy of the ''[[Death of the Author]]'' essay applied to video game development, in which commentators attempt to attribute aspects of a game to how the game developer approached it, as opposed to considering how the game affected themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/2989032/software-games/the-beginners-guide-review-a-weird-fiercely-personal-game.html | title = The Beginner's Guide review: A weird, fiercely personal game | first = Hayden | last = Dingman | date = October 3, 2015 | accessdate = October 3, 2015 | work = [[PC World]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Gamasutra]]'s editor-in-chief Kris Graft notes that, as the game attempts to deconstruct the way players will interpret narrative video games, any attempt to interpret the deeper meaning behind ''The Beginner's Guide'' is paradoxically "committing all of the sins" that the game presents as problems with player interpretations of games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/KrisGraft/20151012/255997/Creativity_as_an_open_question_Random_thoughts_on_The_Beginners_Guide.php | title = Creativity as an open question: Random thoughts on The Beginner's Guide | first = Kris | last = Graft | date = October 12, 2015 | accessdate = October 12, 2015 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Laura Mandanas, writing for Autostraddle, described the game as "a man (poorly) coming to terms with his hugely overinflated sense of entitlement", interpreting the game's themes as not only applicable to game development, but also to inter-personal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autostraddle.com/the-beginners-guide-is-brilliant-horrifying-secretly-feminist-310119/|title="The Beginner’s Guide" Is Brilliant, Horrifying, Secretly Feminist|date=October 7, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=November 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have taken the game to be a work of non-fiction, in that the games presented are works of a real developer other than Wreden, and that the game itself could be seen an unethical use of someone else's work and potentially copyrighting-violating. In considering this aspect, ''[[Destructoid]]''{{'}}s Laura Kate Dale commented with later clarification that the game was short enough to fall within the Steam [[Money back guarantee|refund]] window for those that believed the game was non-fiction and thus contain stolen works to return the game.&lt;ref name="dtoid best new ip"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.destructoid.com/the-best-new-ips-of-2015-327259.phtml | title = The best new IPs of 2015 | first = Laura Kate | last = Dale | date = December 18, 2015 | accessdate = December 23, 2015 | work = [[Destructoid]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dale's statement, prior to clarification, led to some controversy in that Dale was suggesting misuse of the Steam refund system, though her clarification made it clear she was addressing those believing it to be non-fiction. The controversy led some to point out that the interpretation of the game was very personal, differing between each player; Wreden himself in light of the controversy refused to affirm or deny any interpretation of the game, until confirming the game's ultimately fictional nature in an in-depth interview with the podcast Tone Control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/the-controversy-over-a-video-games-suggestion-of-a-crim-1749448664 | title = The Controversy Over A Video Game's Suggestion Of A Crime | work = [[Kotaku]] | first = Patrick | last = Klepek | date = December 23, 2015 | accessdate = December 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/PaulKilduffTaylor/20151221/262335/The_Beginners_Guide_to_Interpretation.php | title = The Beginner’s Guide to Interpretation | work = [[Gamasutra]] | first = Paul Kilduff | last = Taylor | date = December 21, 2015 | accessdate = December 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.idlethumbs.net/forums/topic/11946-tone-control-season-2-episode-6-davey-wreden/|title=Tone Control Season 2 Episode 6: Davey Wreden|website=Idle Forums|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
''The Beginner's Guide'' was developed on the [[Source (game engine)|Source]] engine, which itself serves as part of Wreden's commentary within the game on the nature of level design limited by the Source engine.&lt;ref name="avclub"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.avclub.com/review/beginners-guide-wants-intimacy-then-again-were-all-226170 | title = The Beginner’s Guide wants intimacy, but then again, we’re all so alone | first = Jake | last = Muncy | date = October 1, 2015 | accessdate = October 1, 2015 | work = [[The A.V. Club]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wreden has stated that he does not plan to give media interviews about the game and is letting the game speak for itself.&lt;ref name="motherboard"/&gt;

''The Beginner's Guide'' was announced by Wreden two days before its official release on October 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/29/the-stanley-parable-co-creator-to-launch-new-game-the-beginners-guide-this-week | title = The Stanley Parable Co-Creator to Launch New Game The Beginner's Guide This Week | work = [[IGN]] | first =  Cassidee | last = Moser | date = September 29, 2015 | accessdate = October 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was developed by Wreden himself; his co-creator for ''The Stanley Parable'', William Pugh, had been engaged in creating a new studio, Crows Crows Crows, and working on projects with [[Justin Roiland]], the co-creator of ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', with one title being a similar exploration game, ''[[Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind Heist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-09-29-the-stanley-parable-creator-reveals-the-beginners-guide | title = The Stanley Parable creator reveals The Beginner's Guide | first = Jeffrey | last = Matulef | date = October 1, 2015 | accessdate = October 1, 2015 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | url =  http://www.pcgamer.com/creature-prison-inside-the-vr-designs-of-rick-and-mortys-co-creator/ | title = Creature prison: The VR designs of Rick and Morty's co-creator | work = [[PC Gamer]] | date = September 29, 2015 | accessdate = October 1, 2015 | first = Tyler | last = Wilde }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Beginner's Guide'' received mixed to positive reviews on its release. Several reviewers were very positive about the allusions it made to game development. Jeffrey Matulef of ''[[Eurogamer]]'' considered ''The Beginner's Guide'' to be one of the site's "Essential" titles, calling the game a novel approach to providing story without relying on [[non-player character]]s or collectible diaries, and also an insight into Wreden's own psyche.&lt;ref name="eurogamer review"/&gt;
[[Stephanie Bendixsen]] and [[Steven O'Donnell (Australian actor)|Steven O'Donnell]] of ''[[Good Game (television series)|Good Game]]'' both gave the game five stars, O'Donnell calling it "gut-wrenchingly emotional" and Bendixsen commenting that the game "honestly made me experience the whole creative process in a completely different way."&lt;ref name="ABC Review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/goodgame/stories/s4335154.htm |title=The Beginner's Guide |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=October 20, 2015  |work=Good Game |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] |access-date=November 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Edmond Tran of ''[[GameSpot]]'', giving the game an 8 of 10 rating, identifies that the game asks philosophical questions on the nature of the role between game developers and players, and how to understand some elements of video game design.&lt;ref name="gamespot review"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-beginners-guide-review/1900-6416261/ | title = The Beginner's Guide Review | first = Edmond | last = Tran | date = October 1, 2015 | accessdate = October 1, 2015 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]''{{'}}s Cameron Kunzelman compared Wreden's self-insertion as the narrator to that of [[Alfred Hitchcock]], and suggested that Wreden's [[Janus]]-like duality between being the game's narrator as well as the game's developer poses many questions for the player to think about regarding the nature of video game development.&lt;ref name="paste review"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/10/the-beginners-guide-review-good-evening.html | title = The Beginner's Guide Review: Good Evening | first = Cameron | last = Kunzelman | date = October 1, 2015 | accessdate = October 1, 2015 | work = [[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Marchiafava for ''[[Game Informer]]'', rating the game 8 out of 10, stated that Wreden's approach to the game created a thought-provoking experience, "tackling serious human issues and emotions in a wholly unique way."&lt;ref name="gameinformer review"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gameinformer.com/games/the_beginners_guide/b/pc/archive/2015/10/01/searching-for-answers.aspx | title = The Beginner's Guide | first = Jeff | last = Marchiafava | work = [[Game Informer]] | date = October 1, 2015 | accessdate = October 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Todd Martens, writing for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', said that ''The Beginner's Guide'' is "an odd, thoughtful and beautifully surreal game" with much of its imagery being iconic and memorable well after the player has finished the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-1002-theplayer-beginners-guide-20151005-story.html | title = Can a video game make you a better friend?

Other reviewers criticized the game, finding the narration and intended message was too forced. Brittany Vincent of ''[[Shacknews]]'' was more critical of the game, rating it 3 out of 10, and stating that the narration was pretentious while the game concepts felt forced and overly complex.&lt;ref name="Shacknews"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.shacknews.com/article/91572/the-beginners-guide-review-wreden-begin-again | title = The Beginner's Guide Review: Wreden, Begin Again | work = [[Shacknews]] | first = Brittany | last = Vincent | date = October 2, 2015 | accessdate = October 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Ars Technica]]''{{'}}s Sam Machkovech called the game Wreden's "[[sophomore slump]]", and felt that while the game was intended as a personal journal for Wreden, his emotion-driven narration telegraphed the final moments of the game and failed to follow "[[Show, don't tell]]" narrative techniques.&lt;ref name="arstech"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/the-beginners-guide-review-failure-is-as-failure-does/ | title = The Beginner’s Guide review: Failure is as failure does | work = [[Ars Technica]] | first = Sam | last = Machkovech | date = October 3, 2015 | accessdate = October 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[US Gamer]]''{{'}}s Bob Mackey rated the game 2 of 5 stars, sharing the same opinion as Machkovech that Wreden's narration pushed too much interpretation onto the player, and felt a game like ''[[The Magic Circle (video game)|The Magic Circle]]'', also dealing with exploring an unfinished game and the reasons for why it was unfinished, succeeded better at presenting this idea.&lt;ref name="usgamer review"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-beginners-guide-pc-review-a-walking-tour-of-writers-block | title = The Beginner's Guide PC Review: A Walking Tour of Writer's Block | first= Bob | last = Mackey | work = [[US Gamer]] | date = October 5, 2015 | accessdate = October 5, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyler Wilde of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' gave the game a 69 out of 100 rating, feeling that some of Wreden's messages were delivered a bit heavy-handed through the narration but still positively critiques some of the experimental approaches that were used for narration and player experience.&lt;ref name="PCGamerReview"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/the-beginners-guide-review/ | title = The Beginner's Guide Review | work = [[PC Gamer]] | first=  Tyler | last = Wilde | date = October 5, 2015 | accessdate = October 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Shore of Women''''' is a 1986 [[feminist science fiction|feminist]] [[science fiction]] novel by American author [[Pamela Sargent]]. The story follows the point of view of Laissa and Arvil in the first part, titled "The Enclave". It follows Birana
and Arvil in the second part, "The Refuge". In the final part called, "The Shrine", it is reserved to Laissa again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jamesdavisnicoll.com/review/once-women-had-lived-with-men-the-thought-was-appalling|title=Once, women had lived with men; the thought was appalling|work=jamesdavisnicoll.com|accessdate=July 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
After a devastating nuclear war, women take the upper hand in the world. They build large walled cities and reject men who wander in the wastes outside of the cities in bands of nomadic tribes. They worship fantasy goddesses in shrines. A rebellious woman is exiled to the wasteland. There she finds a man who she falls in love with, together they bring their divided world closer to equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sargent |first=Pamela |authorlink=Pamela Sargent |date=1986 |title=The Shore of Women}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Torres Strait.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Torres Strait seen from space – [[Cape York Peninsula]] is at the bottom; several of the [[Torres Strait Islands]] can be seen strung out towards [[Papua New Guinea]] to the north.]]

The '''Torres Strait''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɒr|ɪ|s}}{{cn|date=August 2018}}) is a [[strait]] which lies between [[Australia]] and the [[Melanesia]]n island of [[New Guinea]]. It is approximately {{convert|150|km|abbr=on}} wide at its narrowest extent. To the south is [[Cape York Peninsula]], the northernmost extremity of the Australian mainland. To the north is the [[Western Province, Papua New Guinea|Western Province]] of [[Papua New Guinea]]. It is named after navigator [[Luís Vaz de Torres]], who passed through the Strait in 1606.

== Geography ==
The strait links the [[Coral Sea]] to the east with the [[Arafura Sea]] and [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] in the west. Although it is an important international sea lane, it is very shallow (7 to 15&amp;nbsp;m water depth),&lt;ref&gt;Harris, P.T., 1988. Sediments, bedforms and bedload transport pathways on the continental shelf adjacent to Torres Strait, Australia - Papua New Guinea. Continental Shelf Research 8, 979-1003&lt;/ref&gt; and the maze of reefs and islands can make it hazardous to navigate. In the south the [[Endeavour Strait]] is located between [[Prince of Wales Island (Queensland)|Prince of Wales Island]] (Muralug) and the mainland.  Shipping enters Torres Strait via the [[Adolphus Channel]] which joins to the Great Barrier Reef lagoon to the southeast.  Strong tidal currents occur in the narrow channels between islands and reefs, and large submarine sand dunes migrate across the seafloor.&lt;ref&gt;Hemer, M.A., Harris, P.T., Coleman, R., Hunter, J., 2004. Sediment mobility due to currents and waves in the Torres Strait - Gulf of Papua region. Continental Shelf Research 24, 2297-2316&lt;/ref&gt;  Some 580 coral reefs, including the Warrior Reefs and Eastern Patch Reefs, cover a total area of {{convert|2400|km2|abbr=on}} in the region, as well as some of the most extensive seagrass beds in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Coles, R.G., McKenzie, L.J. and Campbell, S.J. (2003).  The seagrasses of eastern Australia In: Green EP; Short FT; and Spalding MD. (eds) The World Atlas of Seagrasses&lt;/ref&gt;

Several clusters of islands lie in the Strait, collectively called the [[Torres Strait Islands]]. There are at least 274 of these islands, of which 17 have present-day permanent settlements. [[File:Torres Strait Islands air photo.jpg|thumb|Torres Strait Islands air photo]] Over 6,800 Torres Strait Islanders live on the Islands and 42,000 live on the mainland.

These islands have a variety of [[topography|topographies]], [[ecosystem]]s and formation history. Several of those closest to the New Guinea coastline are low-lying, formed by [[alluvial]] sedimentary deposits borne by the outflow of the local rivers into the sea.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, P.T., 1995. Muddy waters: the physical sedimentology of Torres Strait, in: Bellwood, O., Choat, H., Saxena, N. (Eds.), Recent Advances in Marine Science and Technology '94. James Cook University of North Queensland, Townsville, Qld., pp. 149-160&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the western islands are hilly and steep, formed mainly of [[granite]], and are peaks of the northernmost extension of the [[Great Dividing Range]] now turned into islands when sea levels rose at the end of the last [[ice age]]. The central islands are predominantly [[coral]] [[cay]]s, and those of the east are of [[volcano|volcanic]] origins. The islands are considered Australian territory and are administered from [[Thursday Island]]. There are several major policy and institutional frameworks in the Torres Strait region that support the sustainable use and management of marine resources while also protecting habitats, biodiversity and the traditional islander way of life. Most important of these is the Torres Strait Treaty entered into by Australia and Papua New Guinea in February 1985. The Treaty defines sovereignty and maritime boundaries in the area between the two countries. It guides decision makers on protecting the way of life and livelihood of traditional inhabitants, on managing the protection of habitats, and on sharing the commercial and traditional fisheries resources. The Treaty established a Torres Strait Protected Zone within which both nations manage access to fisheries resources.  Each country exercises sovereign jurisdiction for resources on either side of the agreed jurisdiction lines.

The islands' [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] inhabitants are the [[Torres Strait Islanders]], who are distinct from both the Papuans of adjoining New Guinea and from Aboriginal groups on the nearby Australian mainland but related to both.&lt;ref&gt;David, B., McNiven, I. Manas, L., Manas, J., 2004. Goba of Mua: archaeology working with oral tradition. Antiquity 299 158-172&lt;/ref&gt; The various Torres Strait Islander communities have a unique culture and long-standing history with the islands and nearby coastlines. Their maritime-based trade and interactions with the Papuans to the north and the [[Australian Aborigines|Australian Aboriginal]] communities have maintained a steady [[cultural diffusion]] between the three societal groups, dating back thousands of years at least.

Two indigenous languages are spoken on the Torres Strait Islands: [[Kala Lagaw Ya]]/Kalaw Kawaw Ya/Kawalgau Ya/Muwalgau Ya/Kulkalgau Ya, and Miriam Mir, as well as Brokan [Broken], otherwise called [[Torres Strait Creole]]. In the 2001 Australian national census, the population of the islands was recorded as 8,089, though many more live outside of Torres Strait in Australia.

Environmental issues facing the region include the risk of mining waste from the [[Fly River]] in southern Papua New Guinea, the impacts of global climate change and the sustainable management of natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, P.T., Butler, A.J., Coles, R.G., 2008. Marine resources, biophysical processes, and environmental management of a tropical shelf seaway: Torres Strait, Australia – Introduction to the Special Issue. Continental Shelf Research 28, 2113-2116&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The islands of the Torres Strait have been inhabited for at least 2,500 years and possibly much longer.&lt;ref name="history TSRA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsra.gov.au/the-torres-strait/general-history.aspx|title=History of Torres Strait to 1879 – a regional view|author=John Burton|publisher=[[Torres Strait Regional Authority]]|accessdate=2008-04-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090515015550/http://www.tsra.gov.au/the-torres-strait/general-history.aspx|archivedate=2009-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded European navigation of the strait was by [[Luís Vaz de Torres]], a pilot who was second-in-command on the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] expedition led by navigator [[Pedro Fernandes de Queirós]] who sailed from [[Peru]] to the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]] in 1605. After Queirós's ship returned to [[Mexico]], Torres resumed the intended voyage to [[Manila]] via the [[Maluku Islands]]. He sailed along the south coast of New Guinea, and may also have sighted the northernmost extremity of the [[Australia]]n mainland, however no specific records exist that indicate he did so.&lt;ref&gt;Brett Hilder (1980) ''The Voyage of Torres''. University of Queensland Press, St. Lucia, Queensland. {{ISBN|0-7022-1275-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1769 the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[geographer]] [[Alexander Dalrymple]], whilst translating some Spanish documents captured in the Philippines in 1762, had found Luís Vaz de Torres' testimony proving a passage south of New Guinea now known as Torres Strait. This discovery led Dalrymple to publish the ''Historical Collection of the Several Voyages and Discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean'' in 1770–1771, which aroused widespread interest in his claim of the existence of an unknown continent. It was Dalrymple who named the strait after Torres. Dalrymple was bitterly disappointed that it was [[James Cook]] and not he who was appointed commander of the expedition that eventually led in 1770 to the British encounter and charting of the eastern coastline of Australia.

In 1770 Lieutenant [[James Cook]] rounded Cape York, turned south-west and landed on [[Possession Island (Queensland)|Possession Island]]. From the top of a hill, he signalled down to the ship that he could see a navigable passage through the dangerous Strait. Later in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]], where he learnt that the French had preceded him across the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], Cook re-wrote this signalling drill as a possession ceremony &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beaglehole |first1=J.C. |title=The journasls of Captain James Cook, Vol. I |date=1955 |publisher=Hakluyt Society |location=Cambridge |isbn=0851157440 |page=387-388}}&lt;/ref&gt;, saying he had claimed Australia's east coast for the British Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cameron-Ash |first1=M. |title=Lying for the Admiralty: Captain Cook's Endeavour Voyage |date=2018 |publisher=Rosenberg |location=Sydney |isbn=9780648043966 |page=180-189, 190-197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1823 Captain John Lihou, Master of the 550-ton merchant ship ''Zenobia'' of Calcutta, was on passage from [[Manila]] to [[South America]] and chose a route through Torres Strait. Remarkably, this would become the first time for a ship to be navigated through the Torres Strait from west to east. According to the ''Sydney Gazette'' of April 1823: 'This essay of nautical skill was accomplished after the loss of four anchors and the rudder.' It was also the first occasion a ship was navigated through the [[Coral Sea]] from Torres Strait, south-eastward to the southward of [[New Caledonia]]. Lihou saw Sir James Saumarez' Shoal (now [[Saumarez Reefs]]) on 27 February and named the reef system after Vice-Admiral [[James Saumarez, 1st Baron de Saumarez|James Saumarez]]. On this same trip, Lihou discovered the [[Lihou Reef National Nature Reserve|Lihou Reef and Cays]] and Port Lihou (originally named Port Yarborough, on the southern shore of [[Prince of Wales Island (Queensland)|Prince of Wales Island]]). Please note that Lihou's ship should not be confused with the 385-ton [[HMS Zenobia]], built at Kings Lynn in 1807.  

The [[London Missionary Society]] arrived on Erub (Darnley Island) in 1871.  Although some of the Torres Strait islands lie just off the coast of [[New Guinea]], they were annexed in 1879 by [[Queensland]], then a British colony. There was an important [[Pearl hunting|pearling]] industry from the 1860s until about 1970 when it collapsed in the face of competition from the plastics industry. Pearl-shelling was responsible for the arrival of experienced divers from many countries, notably [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;Ganter, Regina. (1994). ''The Pearl-Shellers of Torres Strait: Resource Use, Development and Decline, 1860s–1960s''. Melbourne University Press. {{ISBN|0-522-84547-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978 an agreement between Australia and [[Papua New Guinea]] determined the [[maritime boundary|maritime border]] in the Torres Strait.&lt;ref&gt;for a detailed map see {{cite web|url=http://www.ga.gov.au/image_cache/GA3747.pdf|title=Australia's Maritime Zones in the Torres Strait|publisher=Australian Government – Geoscience Australia|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-04-13|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022070241/http://www.ga.gov.au/image_cache/GA3747.pdf|archivedate=22 October 2014|deadurl=yes}},&lt;br&gt; for the agreement see {{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/TREATIES/AUS-PNG1978TS.PDF|title=Treaty between Australia and the Independent State of Papua New Guinea concerning sovereignty and maritime boundaries in the area between the two countries, including the area known as Torres Strait, and related matters, 18 December 1978|publisher=[[United Nations]]|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Torres Strait is mentioned in [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'' as a dangerous strait where the submarine, the [[Nautilus (Verne)|''Nautilus'']], is briefly stranded.

The people of the Torres Strait have a unique indigenous culture which has drawn the interest of a range of anthropological, historical, archaeological and folklorist researchers (both professional and amateur). This includes an expedition from Cambridge University led by the early ethnographer [[Alfred Haddon]] in 1898 and the more contemporary regional work of Australian anthropologist Jeremy Beckett. Accounts of local Indigenous narrative traditions can be found in the work of Nonie Sharp and [[Margaret Lawrie]].

Due to proximity to the [[Papua New Guinea]] mainland, the northern Torres Strait islands experience occasional [[asylum seeker]] arrivals from across the Strait. A total of ten asylum seekers from Papua New Guinea were detected in each of 2012 and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wordsworth|first=Matt|title = Torres Strait looms as a new route for asylum seekers escaping PNG|work=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-08-13/torres-strait-png-asylum-seekers-customs-border-patrol/4884640|date=13 August 2013|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the Australian Federal Police were tipped off by residents of Prince of Wales Island that men from Sydney were attempting to buy a boat to reach Papua New Guinea in order to leave Australia without a passport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/afp-probes-men-seeking-boat-in-torres-strait-20160614-gpj5pk.html|title=AFP probes men seeking boat in Torres Strait|date=15 June 2016|publisher=|via=Brisbane Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shipping routes ==
[[File:Torres Strait Chart &amp; Passages.png|thumb|Navigation Routes through Torres Strait]]
The two routes through the Strait are:
*[[Endeavour Strait]] (purple line on chart) – for small vessels.
*Prince of Wales Channel: Larger ships transiting Torres Strait enter the Prince of Wales Channel from the West just north of [[Booby Island (Queensland)|Booby Island]] by way of the Gannet or Varzin Passages. The minimum depths for deep draught shipping in the Great Barrier Reef pilotage area are found here  (10.3m – Nov 2011). Shipping with a 12.2m static draught or less are permitted to transit the area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amsa.gov.au/forms-and-publications/Publications/AMSA125-QCPP_Booklet.pdf AMSA-QCPP P12]&lt;/ref&gt;
**Channels to the East of Prince of Wales Channel
***Great North East Channel: East of Prince of Wales Channel at Wednesday Island the Route becomes The Great North East Channel (green line on chart). The Great North East Channel (GNEC) links the Prince of Wales Channel to the northernmost entrance to the Great Barrier Reef, 120 NM away at Bligh Entrance. The GNEC route runs North or South of Alert Patches and East to under Twin Island then Northeast  to Dalrymple Island (the end of Pilotage requirement) then on to Bramble Quay, Bligh Entrance and the open sea. This passage routes shipping to the Coral Sea, the Pacific Ocean and the outside of the Great Barrier Reef. Another channel (brown line on chart) runs down towards Cape York.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amsa.gov.au/forms-and-publications/Publications/AMSA125-QCPP_Booklet.pdf AMSA-QCPP P12 &amp; Planning chartlets P65]&lt;/ref&gt;
***Inner Route Pilotage Area: The Inner Route Pilotage Area runs from near Cape York to near Cairns. This channel, named the 'Inner Route' runs between the Australian mainland and the Great Barrier Reef &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amsa.gov.au/forms-and-publications/Publications/AMSA125-QCPP_Booklet.pdf AMSA-QCPP Planning Chartlets P31]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Torsten Hägerstrand''' (October 11, 1916, [[Moheda]] – May 3, 2004, [[Lund]]) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[geographer]]. He is known for his work on [[Human migration|migration]], [[cultural diffusion]] and [[time geography]].

A native and resident of Sweden, Hägerstrand was a [[professor]] (later [[professor emeritus]]) of [[geography]] at [[Lund University]], where he received his doctorate in 1953. His doctoral research was on [[cultural diffusion]]. His research has helped to make Sweden, and particularly [[Lund]], a major center of innovative work in [[cultural geography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Buttimer|Mels|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also influenced the practice of [[spatial planning]] in Sweden through his students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Öberg|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Hägerstrand's father was a teacher at a remote elementary school and the family lived at the school. Hägerstrand recalled that his early education was based on the pedagogical ideas of Swiss educator [[Johann Pestalozzi]]. Several of Hägerstrand's students speculated that his holistic and visionary thinking was rooted in his early education:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Öberg|2005}}; {{Harvnb|Pred|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;He was taught local geography, history and folklore at home in the Pestalozzi tradition which was being introduced at that time. Cartography, geology, botany and agronomy were all interrelated parts of a more holistic understanding of processes within a spatial area. To start with, children learned about their immediate environment (e.g., the school room and the farm), then about the village, and gradually the whole district. As a pupil of Hägerstrand, it is easy for me to recognize parts of this tradition which later became what we today would refer to as an 'integrative perspective'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Öberg|2005|p=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Academic career==
Hägerstrand entered Lund University in 1937. His 1953 doctoral thesis ''Innovation Diffusion as a Spatial Process'' gained fame for its innovative use of [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] [[simulation]] of [[Demography|demographic]] development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hägerstrand|1967}}; {{Harvnb|Morrill|2005}}; {{Harvnb|Lenntorp|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It showed how dynamic, incremental simulation of spatial processes could be used at the spatial scale of the individual as well as large spatial aggregates. Forty years later, geographer Andrew Cliff remarked on the foresight of Hägerstrand's methodology: "Bearing in mind that much of the research upon which the book is based dates from a time when computers were almost nonexistent, let alone used by geographers, it is remarkable that the simulation methodology which is so critically dependent upon computing power should have been contemplated."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cliff|Pred|Hägerstrand|1992|p=541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hägerstrand's research was aided by developments at Lund University, notably the establishment of the ''Siffermaskinen i Lund'' ([[SMIL (computer)|SMIL]]), one of Sweden's first computers.&lt;ref name="Brauer &amp; Dymitrow 2017"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brauer|Dymitrow|2017|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hägerstrand noted that the Swedish computer scientist [[:sv:Carl-Erik Fröberg|Carl-Erik Fröberg]], who had been Hägerstrand's "school-mate since secondary school",&lt;ref name="Brauer &amp; Dymitrow 2017"/&gt; had introduced him to the Monte Carlo method that would define his doctoral thesis, following a trip by Fröberg and other young Swedish scientists to the United States, a trip that was financed by the Swedish government's project to build its own computer.&lt;ref name="Brauer &amp; Dymitrow 2017"/&gt;

In 1969, he presented a paper titled "What about People in Regional Science?" to the European Congress of the [[Regional Science Association]] in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hägerstrand|1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paper, published in 1970, developed two concepts:
* The need to study the individual in order to understand social and group practices. Modern [[cultural geography|cultural geographers]] commonly now study everyday practices on an individualistic basis, in order to understand larger scale patterns. The study of just groups creates a homogenization of reality and hides the truth.
* A link between [[space]] and [[time]] that had previously been poorly developed. Historically, social scientists had treated time as a relevant but external factor to spatial features. Hägerstrand's early work on [[Diffusion of innovations|innovation diffusion]] (studying the geographical spread of new technologies) made him realise that the two, though separate, were not independent of each other; they have what French theorist [[Henri Lefebvre]] would call a [[dialectical]] relationship.

Hägerstrand's initial work was primarily [[Quantitative revolution|quantitative]], which is important as the discipline of geography was, when he published his first paper in 1942, a highly [[History of geography#Regional geography|descriptive]] subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|Kitchin|Bartley|Fuller|2002|pp=22–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s he was a pioneer of [[geocoding]] statistical primary data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aase|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; He developed models and statistical techniques, such as the time–space cube and time–space prism, which later became important in the development of [[geographic information system]]s that process and visualize movement data.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{Harvnb|Miller|1991}}; {{Harvnb|Kwan|2004}}; {{Harvnb|Kraak|2008}}; {{Harvnb|Yu|Shaw|2008}}; {{Harvnb|Wilson|2008}}; {{Harvnb|Kenett|Portugali|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Long|Nelson|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work informed the likes of [[Allan Pred]] and [[Nigel Thrift]], who helped take it to the English speaking world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thrift|1977}}; {{Harvnb|Pred|1977}}; {{Harvnb|Pred|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hägerstrand's work contributed to the introduction of [[Humanism|humanistic]] thought into geography, which led to the development of [[critical geography]].&lt;ref&gt;Christiaan van Paassen, ''The philosophy of geography: from Vidal to Hägerstrand'', in {{Harvnb|Pred|1981|pp=17–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; While his early work was largely quantitative, Hägerstrand's later work paid closer attention to notions of embodiment and emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hägerstrand|1983}}; {{Harvnb|Hubbard|Kitchin|Bartley|Fuller|2002|pp=101–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, his methods were critiqued by [[feminist geography|feminist geographer]] [[Gillian Rose]], who claimed that his models showed a [[Masculinity|masculine]] and falsely-ordered view of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rose|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent geographers have tried to combine time geography with the [[qualitative research]] and [[Emotion|affective]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of feminist geography.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{Harvnb|Kwan|2002}}; {{Harvnb|Kwan|2007}}; {{Harvnb|Kwan|Ding|2008}}; {{Harvnb|McQuoid|Dijst|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Scholten|Friberg|Sandén|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of Hägerstrand's work has continued to form part of the basis for [[non-representational theory]], and a reappraisal of his work by new generations of social scientists&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{Harvnb|Ellegård|de Pater|1999}}; {{Harvnb|May|Thrift|2001}}; {{Harvnb|Latham|2003}}; {{Harvnb|Schwanen|Kwan|2009}}; {{Harvnb|Ellegård|Palm|2011}}; {{Harvnb|Ingold|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and biologists&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{Harvnb|Baer|Butler|2000}}; {{Harvnb|Huettmann|Cushman|2009}}; {{Harvnb|Downs|Horner|Tucker|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; means that he remains an influential thinker today. In 2005, [[Nigel Thrift]] summarized five benefits of Hägerstrand's time geography for contemporary social science: &lt;blockquote&gt;First, it provides a sense of concreteness, of the power of 'thereness', and it does so in a way—[[Visual language|visually]]—that is still the preserve of too few social theorists. All those intricate [[diagram]]s were, in part, an attempt to describe the [[pragmatics]] of events, a theme which has now, in the work of writers like [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze]], become fashionable in the social sciences and humanities but, at the time at which Hägerstrand was working, tended to be restricted to the field of philosophy, except for the work of [[Interactionism|social interactionists]] and [[Ethnomethodology|ethnomethodologists]] which was often very imperfectly understood by other than a relatively small coterie of enthusiasts. Secondly, Hägerstrand's work was an attack on the [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheimian]] idea that space and time were social categories, collective representations which both derived from society and also dictated to society. [...] Time-geography makes it possible to go beyond [[social constructionism]] by emphasizing the [[Physics|physical]] constraints on human action and the wider [[Actor network theory|networks]] of competing opportunities that they set up which act to steer situations. [...] Thirdly, and as a directly related point, those time-geographic diagrams did something else too. They radically lessened the distinction between humans and other objects. They provided a kind of neutrality of representation, even a democracy of description, of the world. [...] Fourthly, Hägerstrand's work espoused a geographical [[ethics]], centred on the wise use of space and time. Although Hägerstrand would often use economic metaphors to describe that wisdom in the use of space and time, I am sure that he meant something broader and more encompassing which it seems to me to be well worth keeping hold of, a kind of democratic ethos of the cardinal dimensions, a conviviality in the use of space and time. Fifthly, Hägerstrand provided a language which could register the world in different ways. Perhaps one way of looking at Hägerstrand's work is as a means of saying 'hello' in a language many can understand: drawing as a kind of visual [[Esperanto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thrift|2005|pp=337–338}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Honors==
He received [[honorary doctorates]] from [[University of Bergen]], Norwegian school of economics and business administration, [[List of Honorary Doctors of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology|Norwegian University of Science and Technology]], [[University of Bristol]], [[University of Edinburgh]], [[University of Glasgow]] and [[Ohio State University]]. The commendation accompanying the honorary degree at [[Ohio State University]] noted that "his work on innovation diffusion, carried out in the 1950s and 1960s, continues to be cited as a standard against which current research is measured" and that "this distinguished individual...inspired a generation of scholars around the world."

He was a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]], the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Letters]], the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences]], the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]], the [[Finnish Academy of Sciences]], the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], a Corresponding Fellow of the [[British Academy]], and a member of [[Société de Géographie]] in France. He was also one of the founding members of [[Academia Europaea]].

In 1968 Professor Hägerstrand was awarded the [[Charles P. Daly Medal]] of the [[American Geographical Society]] and in 1968 received an Outstanding Achievement Award from the [[Association of American Geographers]]. In 1979 he received the [[Victoria Medal (geography)|Victoria Medal]] from the [[Royal Geographical Society]].

In 1992 Torsten Hägerstrand was awarded [[Lauréat Prix International de Géographie Vautrin Lud]], the highest award in the [[geography]] research field.

The term is used in three ways.
#A [[#Survey townships|survey township]] is simply a geographic reference used to define property location for [[deed]]s and grants as surveyed and platted by the [[General Land Office]] (GLO). A survey township is nominally six by six miles square, or 23,040 acres.
#A [[#Civil townships|civil township]] is a unit of local government, generally a civil division of a [[County (United States)|county]]. Counties are the primary divisional entities created by [[U.S. states]], thus townships vary from state to state in their powers and organizations.  Civil townships are generally given a name, sometimes abbreviated "Twp".
#A [[#Charter townships|charter township]] is similar to a civil township, found only in the state of [[Michigan]]. Provided certain conditions are met, a charter township is mostly exempt from annexation to contiguous cities or villages, and carries additional rights and responsibilities of [[home rule]].

==Survey townships==
{{Main|Survey township}}
[[File:Theoreticaltownshipmap.gif|thumb|200px|Diagram of survey township]]
[[File:Systemic numbering in the Public Land Survey System.gif|thumb|400px|Hierarchy of systemic numbering in the PLSS]]

Survey townships are generally referred to by a number based on the [[Public Land Survey System]] (PLSS). A reference to the township will look something like "Township 2 North Range 3 East", or "T2NR3E" and such a notation is used in [[Public Land Survey System#Understanding property descriptions|property descriptions based on the PLSS]]. Townships were originally surveyed and [[plat]]ted by the United States General Land Office, using contracted private survey crews, and are marked on the [[United States Geological Survey]] maps of the United States.

Townships are normally a square approximately {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in}} on a side with [[Cardinal direction|cardinal]] boundaries conforming to meridians and parallels, containing 36 sections of {{convert|1|mi2|km2|spell=in}} each. The northern and westernmost tier of sections in each township are designed to take up the convergence of the east and west township boundary lines or range lines, as well as any error in the survey measurements, and therefore these sections vary slightly from being one square mile or {{convert|640|acre|ha}}. Survey townships exist in some form in most states other than the original [[13 colonies]], [[Kentucky]], [[Tennessee]], [[Vermont]], and [[Maine]].{{Dubious|date=August 2011}} Irregular or fractional townships with fewer than a full 36&amp;nbsp;sections are created where full townships cannot be laid out due to existing senior boundaries, such as Spanish/Mexican [[Ranchos of California|ranchos]], [[Indian reservation]]s, state boundary lines, etc.

This kind of township is similar to geographic townships in the province of [[Ontario]], Canada.

In Kentucky, the Jackson Purchase (the area west of the Tennessee River) is divided into townships and ranges. In Tennessee, the entire state is surveyed into townships and ranges that make up 13 survey districts of the Tennessee State Survey. In extreme northern Maine there is an area divided into townships and ranges oriented to true north. A region in the central part of the state, made up of 17 surveys, is divided into townships, but these are not oriented to true north.  The remainder of the state is on [[metes and bounds]]. Similarly, Vermont and New Hampshire are mostly metes-and-bounds states, but have areas in the north that are surveyed into townships not oriented to true north. Most of Ohio is surveyed using the Public Land Survey System, but several sizable areas are metes-and-bounds, including the Virginia Military Reserve, Donation Tract, French Grant and the three Moravian grants (Gnadenhutten, Schoenbrunn and Salem).  A {{convert|150,000|acre|ha|adj=on}} area in southern Indiana ([[Clark's Grant]]) is not surveyed into townships, but is still a gridded survey.  Portions of the Texas State Survey use square townships. Sizeable portions of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California and Arizona are unsurveyed. Substantial swampy areas in Florida and Louisiana are also unsurveyed.

Both New York and Pennsylvania have metes-and-bounds surveys, but in the western parts of these states, the metes-and-bounds form square townships many of which are also civil townships.  Besides these, nearly every state has areas of metes-and-bounds that were never included in the grids (like along major rivers) or were removed from the grid, usually due to surveying mistakes.

==Civil townships==
{{Main|Civil township}}

The township government is a unit of local government, often rural. Townships are geographic and political subdivisions of a [[County (United States)|county]]. The township is identified by a name, such as [[Raritan Township, New Jersey]]. The responsibilities and the form of the township government is specified by the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]].

The most common form of township government has an elected board of trustees or supervisors. Some additional offices, such as clerk or [[Constable#United States|constable]], may also be elected. The most common governmental responsibilities of townships include oversight of such things as road maintenance, [[land-use planning]], and trash collection. Many townships in Ohio, Michigan, New Jersey and Pennsylvania provide police and fire protection, similar to what an incorporated city would provide.

In most [[Midwest|midwestern states]], a civil township often corresponds to a single survey township, although in less populated areas, the civil township may be made up of all or portions of several survey townships. In areas where there are natural features such as a lake or river, the civil township boundaries may follow the geographic features rather than the survey township boundaries. Municipalities such as cities may incorporate or annex land in a township, which is then generally removed from township government. Only one state, [[Indiana]], has township governments covering all its area and population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/gc021x1.pdf |format= PDF |title= Government Organization |author= U.S. Census Bureau |journal= 2002 Census of Governments |volume= 1 |issue= 1 |id= GC02(1)-1 |publisher= U.S. Government Printing Office |location= Washington, DC |year= 2002 |page= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other states, some types of municipalities, like villages, remain a part of the township while cities are not. As [[urban area]]s expand, a civil township may entirely disappear—see, for example, [[Mill Creek Township, Hamilton County, Ohio]]. In other expanding urban areas, the township may incorporate itself into a city; this can be seen in the numerous square cities of [[Hennepin County, Minnesota|Hennepin]], [[Anoka County, Minnesota|Anoka]], and [[Washington County, Minnesota|Washington]] counties in [[Minnesota]]. The [[Montgomery County, Ohio]], cities of [[Trotwood, Ohio|Trotwood]] (1996, formerly Madison Township), [[Huber Heights, Ohio|Huber Heights]] (1980, Wayne Township), and [[Kettering, Ohio|Kettering]] (1955, Van Buren Township) are further examples of townships incorporating into cities.

[[Township (Pennsylvania)|Pennsylvania]] and [[New Jersey]] have civil townships that are not based on the PLSS survey system, but on the older [[metes and bounds]] survey system. A [[township (New Jersey)|New Jersey township]] differs only in name from other municipalities: its boundaries are fixed, it is an incorporated body, and it is free to adopt another form of government. The [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] has frequently failed to allow for federal funding unless they went under a different name;{{cn|date=May 2014}} some New Jersey municipalities, such as the [[Verona, New Jersey|Township of the Borough of Verona]] or [[South Orange, New Jersey|Township of South Orange Village]], changed their names to qualify for additional federal aid.

Utah and Nevada have areas called townships, but they are not the same as civil townships. These areas are not separate governments, but have been granted some degree of self-rule by a county.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Charter townships==
{{Main|Charter township}}
Michigan has created [[charter township]]s as a separate type of government to allow greater flexibility for township governments to serve urbanized populations. In Michigan, as in other states with like systems (though sometimes different names), a township is an administrative division of a county, which is an administrative division of the state. Counties and townships are local organs through which state law and public policy are administered, adapted to local need to the extent the law allows. A charter township is a township that has been granted a charter, which allows it certain rights and responsibilities of home rule that are generally intermediary in scope between those of a city (a semi-autonomous jurisdiction in Michigan) and a village, which (unless it is a home-rule village) is subject to the authority of the township(s) in which it is located.

Charter townships may also reorganize themselves into municipalities, as can be seen in [[Wayne County, Michigan]], and elsewhere in the [[Detroit metropolitan area]].

==Census statistics==
Towns and townships are considered [[minor civil division]]s of counties by the [[United States Census Bureau]] for statistical purposes. According to the Census Bureau, in 2002, town or township government applied to 16,504 organized governments in the following 20 states:
{{div col|colwidth=18em}}
*[[List of townships in Connecticut|Connecticut]]
*[[List of townships in Illinois|Illinois]]
*[[List of townships in Indiana|Indiana]]
*[[Kansas]]
*[[Maine]]
*[[Massachusetts]]
*[[List of townships in Michigan|Michigan]]
*[[List of townships in Minnesota|Minnesota]]
*[[List of townships in Missouri|Missouri]]
*[[Nebraska]]
*[[New Hampshire]]
*[[List of townships in New Jersey|New Jersey]]
*[[New York (state)|New York]]
*[[List of townships in North Dakota|North Dakota]]
*[[List of townships in Ohio|Ohio]]
*[[List of townships in Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]]
*[[Rhode Island]]
*[[List of townships in South Dakota|South Dakota]]
*[[Vermont]]
*[[List of towns in Wisconsin|Wisconsin]]
{{div col end}}
This categorization includes governmental units officially designated as "towns" in the [[New England]] states, New York, and Wisconsin, some [[plantation (Maine)|plantations]] in Maine and locations in New Hampshire. In Minnesota, the terms town and township are used interchangeably with regard to township governments. Although towns in the six New England states and New York, and townships in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, are legally termed municipal corporations, perform municipal-type functions, and frequently serve densely populated urban areas, they have no necessary relation to concentration of population, and are thus counted for census purposes as town or township governments. Even in states beyond New England, townships often serve urbanized areas and provide municipal services typically provided by incorporated municipalities.

The count of 16,504 organized township governments does not include unorganized township areas (where the township may exist in name only, but has no organized government) or where the townships are coextensive with cities and the cities have absorbed the township functions. It also does not include the townships in [[Iowa]] (see [[List of townships in Iowa by county|Iowa townships]]), which are not separate governments, but are classified as subordinate agencies of county governments.

Of the 16,504 town or township governments, only 1,179 (7.1 percent) had as many as 10,000 inhabitants in the 2000 census and 52.4 percent of all towns or townships had fewer than 1000 inhabitants. There was a decline in the number of town or township governments from 16,629 in 1997 to 16,504 in 2002. Nearly all of the decline involved townships in the Midwest.

==Usage by state==
Because township government is defined by each state, the use of this form also varies by state. States using a township form include the following:
*Township government is used in [[List of Indiana townships|Indiana]], [[Kansas]], [[List of townships in Michigan|Michigan]], [[List of townships in Missouri|Missouri]], [[List of townships in Minnesota|Minnesota]], [[Township (New Jersey)|New Jersey]], [[North Dakota]], [[List of Ohio townships|Ohio]], [[Township (Pennsylvania)|Pennsylvania]], [[South Dakota]] and [[Political subdivisions of Wisconsin#Town|Wisconsin]] (in Wisconsin known as towns).
*The form is used in parts of [[List of townships in Illinois|Illinois]] and also in [[List of Nebraska townships|Nebraska]], where they are sometimes referred to as precincts. Two cases of this use of terminology are [[Edwards County, Illinois|Edwards]] and [[Wabash County, Illinois|Wabash]] counties in Illinois.
*The [[New England]] states have a similar concept of local government, but combine the municipal and area government forms into a [[New England town|town]]; this is the locus of the [[town meeting]]. These states are [[List of towns in Connecticut|Connecticut]], [[List of towns in Maine|Maine]], [[List of municipalities in Massachusetts|Massachusetts]], [[List of towns in New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], [[List of cities and towns in Rhode Island|Rhode Island]] and [[List of towns in Vermont|Vermont]].  [[Administrative divisions of New York State|New York]] also has incorporated townships, called [[Administrative divisions of New York State#Town|towns]], although they have fewer powers than New England towns.
*Some states formerly used township governments, or have some vestige of named townships. These include [[List of Arkansas townships|Arkansas]], [[California]], [[List of townships in Iowa|Iowa]], [[Nevada]], [[North Carolina]], [[List of Oklahoma townships|Oklahoma]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25697">The '''Western Caribbean Zone''' is a region consisting of the [[Caribbean]] coasts of [[Central America]], from [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]] in [[Mexico]] to northern [[Colombia]], and also the islands west of [[Jamaica]].  The zone emerged in the late sixteenth century as the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] failed to completely conquer many sections of the coast, and northern European powers supported opposition to Spain, sometimes through alliances with local powers.

Unsubdued indigenous inhabitants of the region included some [[Maya civilization|Maya]] polities, and other [[chiefdom]]s and egalitarian societies, especially in [[Belize]], eastern [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], and [[Costa Rica]].  In addition, the region was the refuge of several groups of runaway slaves, who formed independent settlements or intermixed with the indigenous societies. The combination of unsubdued indigenous people, outlaws (pirates in this case), and an absence of outside control made it similar in some aspects to the [[American West]] or the [[Wild West]], as the western half of North America is often called.

Its long engagement with the [[English-speaking Caribbean]] made it an ideal conduit for trade from both the English colonies of the Caribbean, especially Jamaica, but also North America, which had been trading in the zone since the eighteenth century at least.  The relatively low population and strategic location attracted [[United States]]-based transportation companies to promote infrastructure projects from railroads to the Panama Canal in the zone, and conjointly with that to introduce large-scale fruit production toward the end of the nineteenth century, often bringing in labor from the English-speaking Caribbean to assist.

Unique elements of the region, relative to the population of Central America in general, is the high percentage of people of [[Afro Central American|whole or partial African descent]], and its cultural connections to English and the English-speaking Caribbean through language and religion.

==Early Spanish settlement and conquest==
The first Spanish settlements on the mainland of South America were at [[Santa María la Antigua del Darién|Darien]], where Spanish military activities were prominent in the first years of  the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Sauer, ''The Early Spanish Main'' (Berkeley, 1992), pp. 218-38&lt;/ref&gt;  But, the Spanish abandoned their positions at Darien by 1520, leaving it, as well as the province of [[Veraguas Province|Veragua]] on the Caribbean coast of Panama, in the hands of the indigenous peoples. This situation continued well into the eighteenth century.  The government's occasional licenses given to ambitious Spaniards to conquer or settle these regions never resulted in any significant or long-lasting occupation, nor did attempts of missionaries to convert the indigenous inhabitants result in change.

The Spanish founded towns along the coast of modern-day [[Venezuela]] and [[Colombia]], notably, [[Santa Marta]] in 1525 and [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]].  From these towns they expanded inland to the lands of the [[Muisca people|Muisca]] in the highlands. They were less successful on several parts of the coast, where unconquered pockets remained, notably at the [[Rio de la Hacha]] and the [[Gulf of Urabá]].

Spanish successes in Central America took place mostly on the Pacific side of the isthmus, especially as the victorious Spanish and their [[Aztec|Mexica]] and [[Tlaxcalan]] allies entered [[Guatemala]] in 1524 from the north.  While the primary goal of the conquest was the [[Maya peoples|Maya]] kingdoms of the Guatemala highlands, and the [[Pipil people|Pipil]], [[Lenca people|Lenca]], and other kingdoms of Honduras and Nicaragua, most of their success occurred on the Pacific side of the Isthmus.  A moderately wealthy Spanish colony, called the "Kingdom of Guatemala", was founded on the mining economy of that region, while not as prosperous as those of Peru or Mexico in gold exports supported Spanish towns and settlements, often at former Maya, Lenca or Pipil towns.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Newson, "Labour in the Colonial Mining Industry of Honduras," ''The Americas'' 39/2 (1982): 185-203&lt;/ref&gt;

Farther south, attempts to subjugate the territory of modern-day [[Costa Rica]] were failures, although they did manage to capture slaves for labor elsewhere in the isthmus and outside it.  There were numerous ''entradas'' (invasions) authorized but all had to withdraw under stiff resistance.  Towns that were founded in the 1560s were all destroyed by early seventeenth century attacks, especially led by the [[Talamaca]]s, and as a result the Spanish only occupied the region around the town of [[Cartago, Costa Rica|Cartago]] and the [[Nicoya Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;Juan Carlos Solórzano Fonseca, "Rebeliones y sublevaciónes de los indígneas contra la dominación española en las areas períferica de Costa Rica (de 1502 a 1710), ''Anuario de estudios centroamericanos'' 22/1 (1996): 125-147.&lt;/ref&gt;  Attempts to reduce the area through missionary activity, mostly under the guidance of the Franciscans, also failed to produce much fruit, and further hostilities in the 1760s and 1780s ended that period.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Carlos Solórzano Fonseca, "Indigenas insumisos, frailes y soldados:  Talamanca y Guatuso, 1660-1821," ''Anuario de estudios centroamericanos'' 23/1-2 (1997): 143-97.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish founded some towns on the Caribbean side of Central America, most notably [[Puerto Cortés|Puerto de Caballos]], [[Trujillo, Honduras|Trujillo]], [[Gracias a Dios Department|Gracias a Dios]] and [[Portobelo, Colón|Portobelo]], as well as a significant inland town at [[San Pedro Sula]].  But they failed to conquer the provinces of [[Taguzgalpa]] and [[Tologalpa]] in today’s northeast Honduras and western Nicaragua as well as much of the coast of [[Panamá]] and [[Costa Rica]] which also lay beyond their control, save a few key towns.  They established reasonable control of the coastal lowlands of northern Yucatán after 1540, but the interior of Yucatán remained independent under the [[Itza]] kingdom.  The coastal regions on the south and southeast side of Yucatán, while nominally under Spanish control in the province of [[Verapaz, Mexico|Verapaz]], were ruled by missionaries and exercised considerable freedom of action under the Spanish administration.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Feldman, ed. and trans.,  ''Lost Shores, Forgotten Peoples:  Spanish Explorations of the South East Maya Lowlands'' (Durham and London, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

For much of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, the Spanish were content to allow the Caribbean side of Central America remain under loose control (as around the towns of Puerto Caballo, Trujillo or Portobello).  They used the towns and the routes to them for transporting products of the Pacific side, including Peru to be shipped and exported to Spain.

==The African Runaways==
{{Main|Maroon (people)}}
By the mid-sixteenth century, slaves working the transportation routes which carried silver from [[Peru]] to [[Panama]] and then across the isthmus to [[Nombre de Dios, Colón|Nombre de Dios]], and later [[Portobello, Panama|Portobello]], ran away and formed independent communities in the mountains north of the city. The Spanish called such runaway slave communities [[Cimarron people (Panama)|cimarrons]].  A large community with multiple settlements had developed there by 1550, initially headed by a king named [[Bayano]] whose headquarters was in [[Darién Province|Darien]].  After he was captured in 1558, other men succeeded him as leader.

Somewhat later, other groups formed especially drawing on the many slaves in Panama who were called up to carry silver across the isthmus of Panama from Panama to [[Nombre de Dios, Colón|Nombre de Dios]], the Atlantic port.  By the 1560s there were two large communities, each with its own king, on both sides of the route.&lt;ref&gt;Criado de Castilla, “Summary Description,” in Pérez de Zéleson, et al, eds, ''Costa Rica-Panama Arbitration:  Documents'' 1: 183&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1572 the [[maroon (people)|Panama Cimarrons]] allied with the English privateer Sir [[Francis Drake]] to try to take Nombre de Dios. In 1582, the cimarrons agreed to accept Spanish authority in exchange for their permanent freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Pike, “Black Rebels:  The Cimarrons of Sixteenth Century Panama,” ''The Americas'' 64 (2007): 243-66&lt;/ref&gt;

Other cimmaron communities formed in [[Nicaragua]] and [[Honduras]], especially slaves fleeing the mines and transportation corridors. [[Thomas Gage (clergyman)|Thomas Gage]], the English bishop of Guatemala, noted several hundred escaped slaves in the early 1630s.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Gage, ''The English-American, his Travail by Sea and Land; or a New Survey of the West-Indies'' (London:  R. Cortes, 1648), pp. 128-9, 132-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==English and Dutch challenges==
In the late sixteenth century, [[privateer]]s, especially English ones, began to raid Spanish shipping in the Caribbean.  [[Francis Drake]], one of the more successful, allied with the Cimarrons of Panama in 1572 and, with their assistance, stormed the city of Panama.  In the subsequent years, both Dutch and English privateers linked with cimarrons to attack the trading towns of the Caribbean coast.  In 1630, the English [[Providence Island Company]] founded the [[Providence Island colony]].  They used it until the Spanish successfully counterattacked in 1641 to capture shipping and raid the coast of Honduras and Nicaragua.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karen O. Kupperman]], ''Providence Island, 1630-1641:  The Other Puritan Colony'' (Cambridge, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the fall of Providence Island, the English transferred operations on the coast to Jamaica; many privateers began using the [[Cayman Islands]] as a forward base for attacks on the isthmus.

==Pirate havens and illicit commerce==
{{Main|Golden Age of Piracy}}
[[Piracy in the Caribbean|Pirates]] or [[buccaneer]]s, some of whom were formerly privateers, took over much of activity of the earlier privateers, especially during the [[Golden Age of Piracy]] (1660–1720).&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Rediker,  ''Villains of all Nations: Atlantic Pirates in the Golden Age'' (Boston: Beacon Press, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  Operating from bases within the Caribbean, such as [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga]] and later Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, pirates regularly raided Spanish possessions and shipping along the whole of the Western Caribbean.  They frequently stopped to re-supply at such places as Rio de la Hacha, Darien (which they also used as a base for raids on Panama or to cross to the Pacific) or the [[Miskito people|Miskito]] areas.

When the European colonial powers began to suppress piracy in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, colonial merchants often used the same havens to deliver goods from northern Europe to Spanish markets.  The Spanish Crown's restrictive trade policies, granting of monopolies to favored domestic suppliers, and inability to produce consumer goods cheaply, made smuggling a major activity for English, Dutch and French merchants.  The lucrative trade also enriched the indigenous groups of the area, but attracted frequent Spanish expeditions against them.

In the eighteenth century, ships from English colonies, but particularly Jamaica and also North America, regularly visited the Miskito Kingdom and Belize.  Many of the commercial vessels were from Jamaica and [[New York City]], but ships also came from [[New England]].  In 1718 General Shute the governor of Massachusetts dispatched a warship to protect their interests during the Anglo-Spanish War.&lt;ref&gt;Archibald Gibbs, ''British Honduras:  An Historical and Descriptive Account of the Colony from its Settlement, 1670'' (London: Samson Low, Marston, Searle and Rivington, 1883) p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Miskito Kingdom and English settlements==
{{Main|Mosquito Coast}}
The [[Miskito people]], who had formed a "[[Mosquito Coast|Kingdom of the Mosquitos]]" made an alliance with Great Britain in the late 1630s.  They were joined around 1640 by the survivors of a rebellion on board a slave ship who wrecked the craft at [[Cape Gracias a Dios]].&lt;ref&gt;Karl Offen, "The Sambu and Tawira Miskitu: The Colonial Origins of Intra-Miskitu Differentiation in Eastern Nicaragua and Honduras," ''Ethnohistory'' 49/2 (2002) 328-33&lt;/ref&gt;  The Miskito took the rebels in and intermarried with them, creating a mixed-race group called [[Miskito Sambu|Miskitos-Zambos]].  By the early eighteenth century this group had taken over the Mosquito Kingdom and were raiding far and wide throughout Central America.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Helms, "Miskito Slaving and Culture Contact: Ethnicity and Opportunity in an Expanding Population," ''Journal of Anthropological Research'' 39/2 (1983): 179-97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;German Romero Vargas, ''Las sociedades del Atlántico de Nicaragua en los siglos XVII y XVIII'' (Managua, 1995), p.165.&lt;/ref&gt;  Capitalizing on a long term alliance with the English of Jamaica, they placed themselves under the protection of England and both prevented Spanish occupation of the area while allowing the English the security to found their colony in [[British Honduras]] (Belize).&lt;ref&gt;Troy Floyd, ''The Anglo-Spanish Struggle for Mosquitia'' (Albuquerque, NM, 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;
In the late seventeenth century, Englishmen began to settle on the coast, especially on the stretch from Nicaragua to the Yucatán.  The settlements, while often scattered in small groups, were concentrated in the area of modern-day Belize.  To provide labor for the logging industry, the British imported African slaves and created fairly dense settlement.  A second concentration was in the [[Mosquito Coast|Mosquito Kingdom]], as the British often called the eastern lowlands of Honduras and Nicaragua.  Britain, through its positions in Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, which were more formally taken over and colonized in the second half of the eighteenth century, formed a military alliance with the Miskito.  The Miskitos raided widely, reaching as far north as the Yucatán, and as far south as Panama.  In 1746 Britain declared much of the area an informal protectorate, and in 1766 sent a governor who resided in [[Bluefields, Nicaragua|Bluefields]] (Nicaragua) and answered to the governor of Jamaica.&lt;ref&gt;Troy Floyd, ''The Anglo-Spanish Struggle for Mosquitia'' (Albuquerque, 1967),&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Garifuna==
{{Main|Garifuna people}}
In the later eighteenth century, Caribbean Central America was often used as a place of exile.  During the revolutionary wars of the later eighteenth century, the French deported African-descended militia units to Honduras, and in 1797 the British dispatched the so-called “Black Caribs” of [[Saint Vincent (island)|St Vincent]] to [[Roatán]] in the Bay of Honduras.  Many of these groups eventually found their way to the mainland as well, some retaining a distinct identity while others gradually blended into the existing population.  Today the people of mixed African-indigenous descent are usually known by the name of [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]].&lt;ref&gt;Nancie Gonzales, ''Sojourners of the Caribbean:  Ethnogenesis and Ethnohistory of the Garifuna'' (Champaign-Urbana, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Independence==
Spain had maintained a formal claim to the whole Caribbean coast of Central America since the sixteenth century, though it was not always able to enforce it.  When the Central American countries attained their independence in the aftermath of the [[Mexican War of Independence]], they claimed the region as part of their respective national territories.

Great Britain claimed a protectorate status over the Miskitu, aided by their relatively dense settlement in Belize.  Because of the insecure nature of the borders, Costa Rica, Panama, Nicaragua and Honduras all had to seek international adjudication to determine their Atlantic boundaries.  In the aftermath, Britain lost its claim to coastal Nicaragua, but retained [[Belize|British Honduras]].

Although the British legacy was largely lost politically, the coastal regions kept some unique cultural characteristics.  The population retained close cultural ties to the British West Indies, especially Jamaica, from which many of the people originally derived.  The English language and [[Anglican]] Church were prominent along with Spanish and [[Catholic]] identities.  Protestant missionaries, such as the [[Church of the United Brethren in Christ|Moravians]] in Nicaragua, were also active in the area.  This identity as English speakers would be reinforced with the North American transportation and fruit producing concerns entered the region in the later nineteenth century.

==Filibusters==
{{Main|Filibuster (military)}}
The Atlantic coast of Central America was also an ideal base for [[Filibuster (military)|filibusters]], U. S. based adventurers who tried to intervene in the affairs of Central American republics.  [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]]'s short lived take over of Nicaragua in 1856 was the most famous and important of these private military adventurers.

==The Yucatán Caste War==
{{Main|Caste War of Yucatán}}
In the mid-nineteenth century the [[Caste War of Yucatán|Caste War]], a major civil war broke out in Yucatán, pitting Mexican and Spanish settlers and the Mexican government against insurgent Mayas.  The war was long and protracted, lasting until 1902, and created many refugees.  These refugees, who were of a wide variety of origins, pushed into British Honduras and Honduras.  In the case of British Honduras they came to form a significant portion of the population, and many were employed in the logging and other industries.

==Panama Canal==
{{Main|Panama Canal}}
Several attempts to build a [[Panama Canal]] from the Atlantic to the Pacific side of Central America failed before US interests acquired the French project and lands in 1902. In constructing the canal, the US builders employed thousands of workers from the British Caribbean, especially Jamaica and Barbados.&lt;ref&gt;Velma Newton, ''The Silver Men:  West Indian Migration to Panama, 1850-1914'' (Kingston, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of this immigration, an English-speaking community grew up in the Canal Zone and adjacent areas.  It continues to this day.

==Railroad Construction and the U. S. Fruit Companies==
{{Main|History of Modern Banana Plantations in the Americas|Banana production in Honduras}}
In the late nineteenth century, the Caribbean coast of Central America was a backwater, poorly developed and in many cases only partially controlled by its legal governments. Most of the Caribbean side of Costa Rica was under the control of Talamanca and other indigenous groups. Nicaragua and others had to consider the independent Miskito Kingdom until 1894. Mexico gained control of its portion of the Yucatán only following the end of the [[Caste War of Yucatán|Caste War]] in 1902.

The [[California Gold Rush]] after 1849 created a very large demand for rapid, sea borne travel from the East Coast of the United States (as well as other parts of the world) and the Pacific, and Central America was a potentially usable route.  As a result, there were various attempts to build railroads across the isthmus.  In 1850, Honduras began work, financed and overseen by largely United States capital, on the Inter-Ocean Railroad (''Ferrocaril Interoceanico''), though the work did not extend very far for many years.

In the 1870s, [[Jamaica]] and the [[Bay Islands Department|Bay Islands]] of [[Honduras]] began to export fruit, especially [[banana]]s, to the U. S. market, and entrepreneurs like the [[Vaccaro Brothers]] of New Orleans and [[Lorenzo Dow Baker]] of Boston hoped to capitalize on controlling shipping of bananas to US markets to make big profits.  At the same time, Minor C. Keith, who had taken over his uncle Henry Meiggs' railroad project (founded in 1871) to build a railroad from the coast of Costa Rica to San Jose, its capital, decided to plant bananas along his rail lines, and in fact the banana export business saved his investment.  As banana growing spread into [[Banana production in Honduras|Honduras]] from the Bay Islands, too, the question of building railroads to increase areas able to participate in the international economy grew and a number of firms merged fruit production, railroad building and shipping into vertically integrated large-scale concerns.  By 1920 they were dominated by the [[United Fruit Company|United Fruit]] (now Chiquita) and [[Standard Fruit Company|Standard Fruit]] (now Dole).

The opening up of land, and the fact that the fruit companies paid higher than average wages soon drew thousands of immigrants to the banana producing regions, from the densely settled highland settlements of the Pacific side, and from other parts of the Americas.  Among the immigrant workers, the companies often preferred workers from the [[English-speaking Caribbean]] primarily from Jamaica and [[Belize]] since they could speak English.  Local workers often resented this new, African-descended English speaking and largely Protestant element, and protested and struck against them.&lt;ref&gt;Glen Chambers, ''Race Nation and West Indian Immigration to Honduras, 1890-1940'' (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The U. S. Companies relied heavily on connections with elites in the various countries of the region, as well as the willingness of the U. S. to intervene if the company's interests were threatened.  This combination of local cooperation and imperialist intervention led the visiting American novelist [[O. Henry]], to declare "Anchuria" his name for Honduras, a "[[banana republic]]" in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;O. Henry, ''Cabbages and Kings'' (1904).  O. Henry lived in Honduras in 1896-7.&lt;/ref&gt;  This term has been widely applied to such combinations elsewhere in Central American and in the world

==International Commerce==
In the nineteenth century, North American concerns began the construction of railroads in much of Central America, which necessarily started on the contested zone of the Western Caribbean.  In the process of this and the development of the fruit companies, North American and particularly New English contacts and influence continued.  While the international engagement began with the fruit companies which dominated the economy of the Atlantic side of most Central American countries, in the 1970s they were joined by multi-national textile companies which established large-scale workshops ([[maquiladora]]s) to produce clothing for the international market.  Many of the shops are owned by Asian (especially [[Korea]]n) concerns, though their target markets remain in North American.

==Cultural Characteristics==
The Western Caribbean zone is a multicultural region, including populations of Spanish mestizo origin, indigenous groups, African-indigenous mixed race populations, Europeans and European Americans, and creole populations of African and mixed African-European origin.  However, one of the characteristics of much of the region is the speaking of English, not only in Belize, a former English colony, but also as enclaved populations along the coast from Panama to Belize.  In the case of the Belize and the Cayman Islands English is the official language, but there are significant English speaking majorities in the [[Bay Islands Department|Bay Islands]] of Honduras.

In the countries of official Spanish language, the English speaking minorities have often been disparaged, particularly in Honduras, where the English speaking population is perceived as having been brought in by the fruit companies as a means of undercutting indigenous and mestizo landholding and labor.  Their more ancient connections to English colonialism or attempted colonialism, as along the Miskito coast of Nicaragua and Honduras, has been combined with the perceptions that they are agents of North American/United States imperialism.  This perception has led to occasionally racist depictions of the population the popular press and among politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Dario Euraque, ''Reinterpreting the Banana Republic, 1870-1972'' (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  These sentiments were often manifested by the deportation of workers who could be established as having originated in Belize or Jamaica (as well as other English speaking Caribbean colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Glen Chambers, ''Race Nation and West Indian Immigration to Honduras, 1890-1940'' (Baton Rouge:  Louisiana State University Press, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond linguistic identities, the Western Caribbean often exhibited culinary habits associated with the English speaking Caribbean, or family structure characteristic of that region, such as a reluctance to enter into legal marriages, but instead, what is frequently called "[[Common-law marriage|common law]]" marriages.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, ''Race, Nation'', pp. 83-87.&lt;/ref&gt;  The family structure that results from the marriage strategies of the English speaking Caribbean, often called the [[matrifocal]] family, was first described and identified by Nancie Gonzalez in her work on the Garifuna of Nicaragua and Belize.&lt;ref&gt;Nancie Gonzalez, Sojourners&lt;/ref&gt;
