      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5276">[[File:Running boy in joyous mood 2.jpg|alt=A young boy running in a road. He has black hair and is wearing a backpack.|thumb|The [[running]] of a [[human]] could be considered an action.]]{{Refimprove|date=September 2018}}{{About|the theory of action in general|[[Ludwig von Mises]]' work on this subject|Human Action}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Image of action.jpg|thumb|right|A throw (an action) a spear (with object) by man (by an agent)]] --&gt;
In [[philosophy]], an '''action''' is that which is done by an agent. In common speech, the term is often used interchangeably with the term "behaviour". However, in the [[Action theory (philosophy)|philosophy of action]], [[behavioural sciences]], and the [[social sciences]], a distinction is made: behavior is automatic and reflexive activity, while action is an intentional, purposive, conscious and subjectively meaningful activity {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}. Thus, things like running or throwing a ball is an instance of action; it involves intention, a goal, and a bodily movement guided by the agent. On the other hand, catching a cold is not considered an action because it is something which happens ''to'' a person, not something done ''by'' one.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

== Perception ==
In [[enactive|enactivism]] theory, perception is understood to be [[Sensory-motor coupling|sensorimotor]] in nature. That is, we carry out actions as an essential part of perceiving the world. Alva Noë states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We move our eyes, head and body in taking in what is around us... [we] crane our necks, peer, squint, reach for our glasses or draw near to get a better look...'…'Perception is a mode of  activity on the part of the whole animal...It cannot be represented in terms of merely passive, and internal, processes...' &lt;ref&gt;Alva Noë [[Action in Perception]], (2004), MIT Press(pp1/2 and 111)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Movement==
Some would prefer to define actions as requiring [[Human body|bodily]] movement (see [[behaviorism]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} The [[Unintended consequence|side effects]] of actions are considered by some to be part of the action; in an example from [[G. E. M. Anscombe|Anscombe]]'s manuscript ''Intention'', pumping water can also be an instance of poisoning the inhabitants.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} This introduces a [[moral]] dimension to the [[discussion]] (see also [[Moral agency]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} If the poisoned water resulted in a death, that death might be considered part of the action of the agent that pumped the water.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Whether a side effect is considered part of an action is especially unclear in cases in which the agent isn't aware of the possible side effects.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}  For example, an agent that accidentally cures a person by administering a poison he was intending to kill him with.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Reasons for action==
A primary concern of [[philosophy of action]] is to analyze the nature of actions and distinguish them from similar phenomena. Other concerns include individuating actions, explaining the relationship between actions and their effects, explaining how an action is related to the beliefs and desires which cause and/or justify it (see [[practical reason]]), as well as examining the nature of agency.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} A primary concern is the nature of free will and whether actions are determined by the mental states that precede them (see [[determinism]]). Some philosophers (e.g. [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]&lt;ref&gt;"Davidson, D. Essays on Actions and Events, 2nd ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 2001a.&lt;/ref&gt;) have argued that the mental states the agent invokes as justifying his action are physical states that cause the action.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Problems have been raised for this view because the mental states seem to be reduced to mere physical causes.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Their mental properties don't seem to be doing any work.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} If the reasons an agent cites as justifying his action, however, are not the cause of the action, they must explain the action in some other way or be causally impotent.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

{{Jain philosophy}}
'''Asiddhatva''' is a Sanskrit term which is derived from the word, ''Asiddha'' ({{lang-sa|असिद्ध्}}), which means imperfect, incomplete, unaccomplished, unaffected, unproved, not existing or not having taken effect (as a rule or operation as taught in grammar) or not possessed of magic power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=संस्कृत कोश समुच्चयः|url= http://www.andhrabharati.com/dictionary/sanskrit/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term refers to the state of imperfection, incompleteness, etc.; or to the state of being imperfect or incomplete etc.; but mainly implies not in existence (Jain usage) or non-existent or no order of taking effect (Sanskrit Grammar).

==Overview==
''Asiddhatva'', which means - the endless application of rules, occurs on account of conflict or when the question is of conflict, there is no ''asiddhatva''. ''Asiddha'' means – not having taken effect with regard to the application of the other rules belonging to the same section. But, [[Patanjali]] states that rules which cause endless repetition of application cannot be there. Therefore, it is said that the application of a rule should certainly result in finality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ashtadhyayi of Panini|author=Panini|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|page=202|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFiCjATkpP4C&amp;pg=PR21&amp;lpg=PR21&amp;dq=asiddhatva&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=33u0VrPYux&amp;sig=_QSzYwMtluinJ0NU4gdHDxNxiDA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SzaoUqjQI8uh7Ab0r4DwDQ&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=asiddhatva&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Jainism]], the ''audayika-bhava'' has 21 ''bheda'' or sub-species beginning with ''asiddhatva'' which is the state of unholiness, the lacking of spiritual perfection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Doctrine of Karman in Jain Philosophy|author=Helmuth von Glasenapp|publisher=Jain Publishing Company|pages=38–42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bd-5sKkV1XQC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=asiddhatva+in+jainism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=u2P7HKA6mD&amp;sig=n2CuI-fsVsmzZlT75zkpVoFWbMw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CJGpUqacE-KM7AbSj4CQDA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=asiddhatva%20in%20jainism&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Panini’s principle of ''asiddha''==
[[Ashtadhyayi]] reveals that [[Pāṇini]] formulates his rules of grammar in view of a ''samanya'' or 'general', ''visesa'' or 'particular' and ''sesa'' or 'residual' relationship. A particular rule is said to carve out its domain of application from within the domain of its corresponding general rule by way of an ''apavada'' i.e. exception, to its related general rule. A rule is formulated to apply and it is never regarded as completely without the scope of its application. In case two rules simultaneously apply the rule subsequent in order blocks the prior rule; though there are some exceptions. Blocking by a ''bhiranga'' or the externally conditioned rule by ''antaranga'' or the internally conditioned rule is permitted. But, since two entities can be replaced by each other the application of rules can be treated as suspended (''asiddha'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ashtadhyayi of Panini Vol.1: Introduction to the Ashtadhyayi as a Grammatical Device|author=Ram Nath Sharma|publisher=Munshilal Manoharlal Publishers|page=5|url=http://sanskrt.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Volume_1-Introduction_to_the_Astadhyayi_as_a_Grammatical_Device.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Panini has used the word - ''asiddha'', three times, that is, in ''Sutra''s 6.1.86, 6.4.22 and 8.2.1; in ''Sutra'' 6.4.22 he uses the suffix ''vat'' derived from the term ''vati'' meaning – 'as if', which indicates that simultaneous taking effect of rules in  ''Abhiya'' section is not permitted. Only when a rule has taken effect does it make sense to say that it is as if it had not taken effect. The phrase ''purvatrasiddham'' of ''Sutra'' 8.2.1 tells us that the rules in ''tripadi'' can be used in a certain order only as found in Ashtadhyayi, therefore, ''asiddha'' determines in what order rules are to be applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Asiddha in Ashtadhiyayi: a misunderstanding among the traditional commentators?|author=Johannes Bronkhorst| authorlink = Johannes Bronkhorst |publisher=Journal of Indian Philosophy|pages=69–85|url=https://www.academia.edu/3287953/Asiddha_in_the_A_adhyayi_a_misunderstanding_among_the_traditional_commentators}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Panini’s account of ''Asiddhatva''==
''Asiddhatva'', which means - the endless application of rules, occurs on account of conflict or when the question is of conflict, there is no ''asiddhatva''. ''Asiddha'' means – not having taken effect with regard to the application of the other rules belonging to the same section. But, [[Patanjali]] states that rules which cause endless repetition of application cannot be there. Therefore, it is said that the application of a rule should certainly result in finality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ashtadhyayi of Panini|author=Panini|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|page=202|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFiCjATkpP4C&amp;pg=PR21&amp;lpg=PR21&amp;dq=asiddhatva&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=33u0VrPYux&amp;sig=_QSzYwMtluinJ0NU4gdHDxNxiDA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SzaoUqjQI8uh7Ab0r4DwDQ&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=asiddhatva&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Ashtadhyayi]] of Panini the ''sutra''s are declared ''asidddha'' in the following instances:
* 1) ''purvatrasiddham'' (''Sutra'' 8.2.1). The ''sutra''s from 8.2.1 to 8.4.68 (''tripadi'') are ''asiddha'' to ''sutra''s from 1.1.1. to 8.1.74 (''sapadasaptadhyayi''); also in ''tripadi'' the successive ''sutra''s are ''asiddha'' to their previous ''sutra''s.
* 2) ''asiddhavadatrabhat'' (''Sutra'' 6.4.22.) The ''sutra''s from 6.4.22 to 6.4.175. are deemed ''asiddha'' to each other.
* 3) ''satvatukorasiddhah'' (''Sutra'' 6.1.86.) The ''sutra''s from 6.1.87 to 6.1.111. are ''asiddha'' to ''satva'' ''sutra''s (8.3.39 to 8.3.119) and ''tuk'' ''sutra''s (6.1.70 to 6.1.75)
The concept of ''asiddhatva'' has been used in [[Ashtadhyayi]]
* a) to prevent the application of ''sutra'' on the substitute
* b) to enable the application of ''sutra'' on the substituent and
* c) to mandate the order of the application of ''sutra''s, and
finds its application in the ''viddhi'' ''sutra''s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Asiddhatava Principle in Computational Model of Ashtadhyayi|author=Sridhar Subbanna|page=1|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-17528-2_18#page-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a filter- technique it applies word internally in a pre-suffixal stem-suffix relation. ''Sutra'' 6.4.22 lays down the condition of ''samanasryatva'' having the same conditioning element for ''asiddhatva''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ashtadhyayi of Panini|author=Panini|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|pages=82, 352|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFiCjATkpP4C&amp;pg=PR21&amp;lpg=PR21&amp;dq=asiddhatva&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=33u0VrPYux&amp;sig=_QSzYwMtluinJ0NU4gdHDxNxiDA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SzaoUqjQI8uh7Ab0r4DwDQ&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=asiddhatva&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''siddha''- principle, all rules interact in a transparent way, whereas the ''asiddha''-principle is a default principle which can be defeated at cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=On the Architecture of Panini’s Grammar |author=Paul Kiparsky|publisher=Academia.edu|page=|url=https://www.academia.edu/3082019/On_the_Architecture_of_Paninis_Grammar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application of rules==
A ''[[sutra]]'' or a rule is said to be ''asiddha'' in regard to another if, with respect to this latter, it is conceived of as not to exist. The forms to which a ''sutra'' normally applies are as arise according to ''sutra''s which are ''siddha'' i.e. the rules that can have an effect. The number of forms which fall under a rule depends on the relation to ''sutra''s which are ''siddha''. The opportunities for application of a rule to cases are determined by the ''sutra''s which are ''asiddha'' i.e. do not have an effect, by which the forms are added or excluded, that is, by the ''asiddhatva'' of the one ''sutra'' cases are added to the other or excluded from the other which are ''siddha''. By this method the right tracing of the cases that are to conform to a rule, is secured only if, whether by ''sutra''s which are ''siddha'' or by such ''asiddha'', those substitutions which are desired or even not desired, are secured or prevented respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Tripadi:Being an English recast of Purvatrasiddham|author=Herman Eildert Buiskool|publisher=Brill Archive|pages=62–67|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NBsVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq=asiddhatva&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1-XKFmiUCv&amp;sig=3Hax2bSCmJON5ntDKRqvjwT3FRI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SzaoUqjQI8uh7Ab0r4DwDQ&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=asiddhatva&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sutra'' 6.4.22 which reads - असिद्धवदत्रभात् | (''asiddhavadatrabhaat'') is an ''adhikara'' ''sutra'' that defines the limits up to which it is valid as अभात् (''a bhaat''), in which ''sutra'' the word अत्र (''atra'') means - in that domain or in the domain of the same conditioning element. The rules in the ''asiddhavat'' section apply in the same conditioning (linguistic) element. The word ''asiddhavat'' is taken as a variant of the word ''asiddha''. The purpose of a ''siddha'' is to allow an operation conditioned by a ''sthanin'' (item to be replaced) or prohibit an operation conditioned by a substitute. ''Asiddhatva'' has a blocking effect and also a feeding effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ashtadhyayi of Panini Vol.9|author= S.Joshi|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|page=xviii|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/109260018/The-Astadhyayi-of-Panini-Vol-ix-by-S-joshi-J-roodbergen-300dpi-Jbig2-Lossy}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Asiddhatva'' invariably leads to ''[[Anavastha]]''.

==Jain Philosophy of Karman and ''Asiddhatva''==
The Jain Philosophy extends the concept of Karman beyond the good and the bad and also beyond their resultant enjoyment or punishment. Each kind of karman works with a specified intensity, and there are eight mula-prakrtis (species) of karmans depending upon their prakrti, stithi, rasa and pradesas, viz. Jnanavarana-karmans which obscure knowledge, Darsanavarna-karmanas which obscure undifferentiated cognition, Vedaniya-karmans which produce the feeling of joy and grief, Mohaniya-karmans which obstruct belief and conduct, Ayus-karmans which determine duration of life, Nama-karmans which give various factors of individuality, Gotra-karmans which define family surroundings and Antaraya-karmans which hinder Jiva’s capability of resolution and enjoyment, and their numerous uttara-prakrtis (sub-species).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Karman in itself|publisher=Jainworld.com|url= http://www.jainworld.com/book/doctrineofkarma/ch7.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jain thinkers believe that the time during which the ''karman''s work and the intensity with which they manifest themselves is definite and that it is possible for all ''karman''s to increase or decrease their effects and also transform which transformation they call ''samkarma''. Different kinds of ''karman'' which can be related to one another also establish a relationship with the ''Jiva'' (soul) and the states (''bhava'') produced in it by them. In the ''Jiva'' there can manifest five states – the ''parinamika'' or the essential state, the ''audayika'' or the state which is the consequence of the unhindered realisation of ''karman''s, the ''aupasamika'' or the state produced by the suppression of the ''karman''s, the ''ksayika'' or the state resulting from the annihilation of the ''karman''s and the ''kasayopasamika'' or the mixed state. The ''audayika-bhava'' has 21 ''bheda'' or sub-species beginning with ''asiddhatva'' which is the state of unholiness, the lacking of spiritual perfection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Doctrine of Karman in Jain Philosophy|author=Helmuth von Glasenapp|publisher=Jain Publishing Company|pages=38–42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bd-5sKkV1XQC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=asiddhatva+in+jainism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=u2P7HKA6mD&amp;sig=n2CuI-fsVsmzZlT75zkpVoFWbMw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CJGpUqacE-KM7AbSj4CQDA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=asiddhatva%20in%20jainism&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jain terminology ''asiddhatva'' refers to the unproved state and to the non-existent i.e. whose existence cannot be proved&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary of Jain words|publisher=Colorado State University|url= http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~malaiya/jaingloss.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to the state of non-salvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Terminology of Jainism|author=Dinesh Vora|page=53|url= http://www.jainology.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/TERMINOLOGY-OF-JAINISM.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Siddha'' is the soul who has attained the status of the supreme Soul by shedding all karmic matter associated with itself and then cease to interfere in the affairs of the universe. ''Asiddhatva'' leads to [[Anavastha]] which is a ''dosha'' (defect) according to [[Hemachandra]].

The historian [[Peter Gay]] described ''Aspects of Scientific Explanation and other Essays in the Philosophy of Science'' as "seminal" and "indispensable", writing that Hempel persuasively argued that "the logic of history and that of the natural sciences are the same."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gay88|Gay 1988]]. pp. 236-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Gay observed that Hempel's essay "The Function of General Laws in History", included in the collection, is a "much debated classic".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gay76|Gay 1976]]. p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Michael Friedman (philosopher)|Michael Friedman]] wrote that ''Aspects of Scientific Explanation and other Essays in the Philosophy of Science'' is seen as one of the most important works in philosophy of science written after the Second World War.&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;[[#Fri99|Friedman 1999]]. p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Zen Buddhism}}
The '''''Blue Cliff Record''''' ({{CJKV|c=碧巖錄|p=Bìyán Lù|j=碧巌録|r=Hekiganroku|k=벽암록|rr=Byeokamrok|v=Bích nham lục}}) is a collection of [[Chán]] ([[Zen]]) [[Buddhist]] [[koan]]s originally compiled in [[China]] during the [[Song Dynasty (960-1279)|Song dynasty]] in 1125 (in the time of [[Emperor Huizong of Song China|Emperor Huizong]]), and then expanded into its present form by the Chán master [[Yuanwu Keqin]] (1063–1135; ''{{transl|ja|Engo}}'').&lt;ref name="18-20"&gt;K. Sekida, ''Two Zen Classics'' (1977) p. 18-20&lt;/ref&gt;

The book includes Yuanwu's annotations and commentary on ''100 Verses on Old Cases'' ({{lang|zh|頌古百則}}), a compilation of 100 [[koan]]s collected by [[Xuedou Chongxian]] (980–1052; {{lang|zh|雪竇重顯}}, ''{{transl|ja|Setcho}}'').&lt;ref name="18-20"/&gt; Xuedou selected 82 of these from the ''[[Transmission of the Lamp]]'', with the remainder selected from the ''Yunmen Guanglu'' ({{lang|zh|雲門廣録}}, ''Extensive Record of [[Yunmen Wenyan]]'', 864–949).

==Later developments==

Yuanwu's successor, [[Dahui Zonggao]] (1089–1163), wrote many letters to lay students teaching the practice of concentrating on koans during meditation, but Dahui did not explain and analyze koans. Oral tradition holds that Dahui noticed students engaged in too much intellectual discourse on koans, and then burned the wooden blocks used to print the ''Blue Cliff Record'' to "rescue disciples from delusion".&lt;ref name="Heine"&gt;{{cite book|last=Heine|first=Steven|title=Chan Rhetoric of Uncertainty in the Blue Cliff Record|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u-IdDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA286|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-939777-8|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The text was reconstituted only in the early 14th century by a [[householder (Buddhism)|layman]], Zhang Mingyuan ({{lang|zh|張明遠}}, ''{{transl|ja|Chō Mei-en}}'').&lt;ref name="Heine"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. Sekida, ''Two Zen Classics'' (1977) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; One of Zhang's sons became ill during this time, and others believed that it was an omen meaning that Zhang should not have re-released the book. However, an elder named Feng Zizhen ({{lang|zh|馮子振}}) comforted Zhang and encouraged him for his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=藍|first1=吉富|title=大慧宗杲焚燒《碧巖錄》事件的歷史評述|url=http://www.mst.org.tw/Magazine/magazinep/The%20Rest/142-%E5%A4%A7%E6%85%A7%E5%AE%97%E6%9D%B2.htm|language=zh|quote=張明遠聞說之後，詢之於海粟老人馮子振。馮氏除了安慰他之外，並以佛教口吻讚美他印書這一善行。|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701010137/http://www.mst.org.tw/Magazine/magazinep/The%20Rest/142-%E5%A4%A7%E6%85%A7%E5%AE%97%E6%9D%B2.htm|archivedate=2016-07-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dogen and Japan==

Another key legend regards [[Dogen Zenji]] (1200–1253), who brought the Soto Zen sect to Japan. After an extended visit to China for the purpose of studying Zen, on the night before his planned return to [[Japan]], Dogen came across the ''Blue Cliff Record'' for the first time, and stayed up all night making a handwritten copy of the book. Given the size of the book, this story is most likely apocryphal; but Dogen is still credited with introducing the collection to Japan,&lt;ref&gt;H. Tanake, ''Philosophy as Metanoetics'' (1986) p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; where it had a wide circulation.&lt;ref&gt;M. Y Zeami, ''On the Art of the N_ Drama'' (1984) p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary qualities==
The ''Blue Cliff Record'' was a subtle and literary text, with wide-ranging philosophical implications, as opposed for example to the more straightforward nature of  ''[[The Gateless Gate]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Z. Shibayama, ''The Gateless Barrier'' (2000) p. xv&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''BonPatron''' is an online spelling and grammar checker for French. The site also includes guides for grammar, vocabulary, phonetics, and a verb conjugator.

== History ==

BonPatron was created as an academic project in 2001 by Terry Nadasdi ([[University of Alberta]]) and Stéfan Sinclair ([[McGill University]]). BonPatron initially targeted grammatical errors typically made by anglophone learners of French. Its purpose was to see how close a web-based grammar checker could replicate what teachers do when correcting student compositions (repeatedly indicating the same mistakes). BonPatron was initially called LePatron but changed its name in 2007 when it became a joint academic/commercial endeavour.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bonpatron.com/Resources/Docs/dublin.pdf|title=Anything I can do, CPU can do better: A comparison of human and computer grammar correction for L2 writing using BonPatron.com|last=Nadasdi|first=Terry|last2=Sinclair|first2=Stéfan|date=|year=2007|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was initially designed for language learners in North America, but it is now used extensively by people whose first language is French, especially in France and Quebec.

In addition to the main grammar checker, other pedagogical resources have been added over the years (e.g.: a grammar guide, a vocabulary guide and a phonetics guide).

== Usage ==

BonPatron has two versions, one that is free and supported by ads (BonPatron.com) and the other that is subscription-based (Pro.BonPatron.com). Both draw on the same error database to identify and explain errors. The main difference is that the subscription-based version accepts longer texts. Native mobile apps are available for iOS and Android, developed in partnership with Alkeo.

In order to use BonPatron, the user supplies a text (typed or pasted from the clipboard) and hits the “Check” button. After doing so, the text is examined for typical errors. Errors will be flagged and relevant feedback will be displayed. BonPatron does not provide automatic correction. Rather, it supplies information to help the learner learn from the mistake. It is in this sense that BonPatron should be viewed as an interactive pedagogical tool rather than an editor or traditional grammar checker.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamel|first=Marie-Josée|date=|year=2008|title=Bon Patron – Parcours pédagogique critique du logiciel|url=|journal=Revue canadienne de linguistique appliquée|volume=11|issue=2|pages=123-131|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BonPatron website averages 4.5 million unique visitors annually and processes an average of 250,000 texts per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bonpatron.com/faq/#Q_Who_Uses_BonPatron|title="BonPatron" Online Spelling and Grammar Checker for French as a Second Language|website=bonpatron.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and evaluation ==

BonPatron has been reviewed and evaluated by a number of scholars. The main findings from these evaluations are: a) BonPatron is able to identify approximately 90% of errors typical of learners writing in French&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burston|first=Jack|date=|year=2008|title=Bon Patron: An Online Spelling, Grammar, and Expression Checker|url=|journal=Calico Journal|volume=2|issue=25|pages=337-347|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;; b) BonPatron stands apart from other grammar checkers because of its pedagogical design &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=López Santiago|first=Mercedes|date=|year=2016|title=Review of BonPatron.com|url=https://polipapers.upv.es/index.php/eurocall/article/view/6515/7215|journal=The EUROCALL Review|volume=24|issue=2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;; c) BonPatron promotes learning and its use leads to a reduced number of errors in learner texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bensalem|first=Samra|date=|year=2011|title=Le correcteur orthographique : quel apport pour l´amélioration de la compétence orthographique?|url=https://gerflint.fr/Base/Algerie12/samra_bensalem.pdf|journal=Synergies Algérie|volume=|issue=12|pages=233-240|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gauthier|first=Marie|date=|year=2013|title=Anglophone high school boys’ engagement and achievement in editing their French writing using the BonPatronPro|url=https://jcrl.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/jcrl/article/download/16093/pdf|journal=Journal of Classroom Research in Literacy|volume=|issue=6|pages=24-35|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''British Tamils Forum''' or BTF, is a largest organisation representing the [[Tamils in the United Kingdom|Tamil Community]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The BTF intends to be the voice of the Tamil Community in the UK by raising the issues on Tamils in UK and to bring awareness to the issues affecting Tamil people in the island of Sri Lanka and around the world. The BTF's work is focused on addressing the root cause to the conflict through an international justice mechanism to bring truth and justice to all victims of war and to bring end to the entrenched culture of impunity in Sri Lanka.

The BTF's vision for a lasting peace and security through a negotiated political settlement to the Tamil national question by recognising the Tamil people’s right in the North-East of the island of Sri Lanka and hope to bridge the voice between the British Tamil Community and the Tamil people in the island of Sri Lanka.

The [[Government of Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan government]] banned the organization as a front for the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam|LTTE]] and was considered a [[Terrorism|terrorist]] group. However the lack of evidence to link the BTF and with the LTTE and terror activities resulted in the ban eventually getting lifted in 2015 as a bid to achieve reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Govt lifts ban on several banned LTTE outfits|url = http://www.dailymirror.lk/96375/govt-lifts-ban-on-several-pro-ltte-outfits|website = www.dailymirror.lk|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sri Lanka Slashes List of 'Terrorists' in Reconciliation Bid|url = http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/sri-lanka-slashes-list-of-terrorists-in-reconciliation-bid-1246061|website = NDTV.com|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The British Tamils Forum was established as an advocacy group in 2006, with the support of [[Sri Lankan Tamils]]  to undertake high level diplomacy, engaging with the members of parliament, government representatives, policy makers, civil society organisations and to mobilise the Tamil Community in the UK to on Sri Lankan Tamil issues. In 2010, BTF evolved as a nonpartisan, grassroots community organisation and representing a collective voice of the Tamil Community in the UK, by bringing together individuals, and Tamil organisations in a bottom-up structure, governed along the principles of participatory democracy.

==Activities==

===Boycott call===
In January 2008, the Forum called for a boycott of [[Sri Lankan Airlines]] as well as other trade and travel sanctions, in protest at the Government of Sri Lanka's withdrawal from a ceasefire with the rebel [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]], after both sides had violated the agreement numerous times after LTTE instigation. Ivan Pedropillai of the forum stated that "£12m in foreign currency earned annually by the airline was being used to reinforce the government's war chest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=| title= Tamil Diaspora calls for Sri Lankan boycott| url= http://www.tamilguardian.com/article.asp?articleid=1545| work = [[Tamil Guardian]] | date=2008-01-23 | accessdate=2008-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=British Tamils Forum| title= Blood Money For The Sri Lankan Government| url= http://www.tamilwritersguild.com/BTF_PressRelease.pdf |format=PDF|work = [[Tamil Writers Guild]] | date=2008-01-15 | accessdate=2008-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Forum organised a meeting chaired by MP [[Keith Vaz]] who compared the Tamil plight to the [[Rwandan genocide]], [[War in Darfur|Darfur killings]] and [[Bosnian Genocide|Bosnian ethnic cleansing]]. BTF spokesman Suren Surendiran surmised that the international community had continually pursued a double standard in its approach to [[conflict resolution]] in Sri Lanka compared to in states such as [[Zimbabwe]], stating that the Sri Lankan government was "abusing the Tamils’ fundamental human rights and killing innocent Tamil civilians with the aid and assistance from the international community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Rashmee Roshan| title= UK issues stern warning to Colombo| url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/UK_issues_stern_warning_to_Colombo/articleshow/2714382.cms|work = [[Times of India]] | date=2008-01-19 | accessdate=2008-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008 photo exhibition in UK Parliament===
On 16 July 2008, the BTF displayed a photo exhibition, sponsored by the [[All Party Parliamentary Group for Tamils]] (APPGT), which was held in the British [[Houses of Parliament]] premises on the anniversary of the [[Black July]] pogrom, and marked 50 years since the 1958 [[Riots and pogroms in Sri Lanka|riots on the island]]. Photos depicted political figures according to BTF responsible for structural and physical violence in the [[Tamil Eelam|North-East]] since [[Ceylon]]'s independence from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] as well as victims of the [[Sri Lankan civil war]]. The event was attended by MPs of all partys, Members of the [[House of Lords]], Former Cabinet Ministers, Mayors, Councillors, University students, and representatives of international &amp; UK organisations.&lt;ref name="btf-exhibition"/&gt;

Attendees included three MPs of the [[Tamil National Alliance]] - Ms Padmini Sithamparanathan MP,
Jayananthamoorthi MP and Gagendran MP, a representative of the Sri Lankan High Commissioner in London, [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] MPs [[Joan Ryan|Joan Ryan MP]], [[Virendra Sharma|Virendra Sharma MP]], [[Keith Vaz|Keith Vaz MP]], [[Andy Love|Andy Love MP]] and [[Lord Waddington|Lord Waddington QC]] of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. It was hailed by [[Neil Gerrard|Neil Gerrard MP]] as "making a clear case for [[self-determination]]" and as a final note, [[Barry Gardiner|Barry Gardiner MP]] wrote of the exhibition "We Build a Nation."&lt;ref name="btf-exhibition"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tamilsforum.com/UK%20Parliament%2016%20July%202008.pdf | title = The Exhibition makes a clear case for Self Determination for Tamils  and We Build a Nation – British Government Members of Parliament | accessdate=2008-10-18 | author=British Tamils Forum|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ken Livingstone meeting===
Whilst campaigning for a renewed term as [[London Mayor]], [[Ken Livingstone|Ken Livingstone MP]] sought the backing of the BTF in [[London Borough of Harrow|Harrow]] during a meeting. According to a column by [[Andrew Gilligan]], Livingstone was accused by the Sri Lankan High Commission and Gilligan as speaking to "a front of the terror group LTTE."&lt;ref name="agonken"&gt;{{cite web | author=| title= Ken talks to 'front' for banned Tamil Tigers| url= http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-mayor/article-23479694-details/Ken%20talks%20to%20%27front%27%20for%20banned%20Tamil%20Tigers/article.do?expand=true| work = thisislondon.co.uk| date = 2008-04-22|accessdate=2008-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BTF rejected the allegation. Gilligan has been noted by Livingstone to have led a sustained partisan campaign against the former mayor during his time in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Ken Livingstone| title= Sack Andrew Gilligan| url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/dec/14/sackandrewgilligan| work = [[The Guardian]]| date = 2007-12-14|accessdate=2008-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the meeting, co-organised with councillor [[Thaya Iddaikadar]] and local Harrow Tamilians, Livingstone stated of the claim "the Metropolitan Police came under [me] and where there was a legitimate request for a legitimate event his office would always be supportive." Livingstone also gave the forum his "personal commitment" that he would support its [[vigil|candlelit vigil]] in [[Trafalgar Square]] in July 2008 to mark the 25th anniversary of "[[Black July]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=| title= Sri Lankan Diplomats Demonizing UK Tamils - BTF| url= http://www.tamileelamnews.com/news/publish/tns_9660.shtml| work = tamileelamnews.com| date = 2008-04-23|accessdate=2008-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rallies===
Annual political rallies are organised by the BTF and in June, July, September and October 2008, the forum organised and participated in several public demonstrations in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=| title= Diaspora Tamils seek solidarity with British Public| url= http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&amp;artid=27175| work = [[TamilNet]]| date = 2008-10-12|accessdate=2008-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It worked in union with the NSSP, the TYO (Tamil Youth Organisation), S4P (Solidarity for Peace), [[Socialist Resistance]], [[Socialist Party of Great Britain|the Socialist Party]], [[International Socialist Group]] and South Asia Solidarity Group in condemning [[Mahinda Rajapakse]]'s visit to London, and supported the right to [[self determination]] of the Tamil people in "[[Tamil Eelam]]." All Party debates in [[UK Parliament]] have highlighted gatherings organised by the BTF and the issues the forum has raised.&lt;ref name="btf-rally june"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tamilsforum.com/Demonstration100608.html | title = President Rajapakse will think twice before visiting London next time - British Tamils Forum | accessdate=2008-10-18 | author=British Tamils Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=| title= House of Commons Hansard Debates for 14th October 2008| url= https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081014/halltext/81014h0009.htm#column_240WH| work = UKParliament.co.uk| date = 2008-10-14|accessdate=2008-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===statements===
In the wake of a return to full-scale hostilities in 2008 on the island, with Tamil civilians moving further into rebel areas amid army offensives and increasing international concern on the plight of civilians caught in Sri Lanka's conflict, the BTF released a statement, responding to an assertion by [[Lord Malloch Brown]] that "the LTTE should allow free movement of civilians", accusing the Sri Lankan Government of deliberately
"''restricting free movement of civilians within and out of [[Jaffna Peninsula]], where the [[Sri Lankan army|Sinhala army]] is an occupying force.''" Its statement went on to note how "''degrading restrictions laid on the Tamil community living in and around Colombo, restrictions placed on journalists to travel around Sri Lanka to report on current security situations and human rights violations and the inhuman treatment of IDPs by restricting their mobility, by placing them in 'detention centres' (e.g. in [[Mannar, Sri Lanka|Mannar]]) [was] in contravention of humanitarian practices, human rights laws, U.N.

===2009 London Protest===
On 31 January 2009, up to 100,000 people marched through London on a BTF co-organised demonstration, protesting the deaths of hundreds of Tamils in Sri Lankan army attacks and demanding a permanent ceasefire. Protesters carried large flags of red and yellow – the Tamil [[national colours]] – and banners condemning the genocide of Tamils by the Sri Lankan state, expressing their support for an independent Tamil Eelam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=| title= British Tamils stage largest ever march protesting genocide, mandating Tamil Eelam| url= http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&amp;artid=28240| work = [[TamilNet]]| date = 2009-01-31|accessdate=2009-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Passing peacefully for one of its size, with three MPs, [[Keith Vaz|Keith Vaz MP]], [[Simon Hughes|Simon Hughes MP]] and [[Andrew Pelling|Andrew Pelling MP]] joining the protest, Vaz stated that in his 21-year career in politics, he had never seen a protest as large as it in London. Addressing the crowd, he challenged the Indian High Commission to pressure Colombo to give peace a chance in the spirit of [[Mahatma Gandhi]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27294">'''Chabad philosophy''' comprises the teachings of the leaders of [[Chabad-Lubavitch]], a [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] movement. Chabad Hasidic philosophy focuses on religious concepts such as God, the soul, and the meaning of the Jewish commandments.

Teachings are often drawn from classical [[Judaism|Judaic teachings]] and [[Kabbalah|Jewish mysticism]]. Classical Judaic writings and Jewish mysticism, especially the [[Zohar]] and the [[Kabbalah]] of Rabbi [[Isaac Luria]], are frequently cited in Chabad works. These texts are used both as sources for Chabad teachings as well as material requiring interpretation by Chabad authors.

While Chabad was founded by Rabbi [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi|Shneur Zalman]] of [[Lyady, Vitebsk Region|Liadi]], Chabad philosophy is based on the teachings of [[Baal Shem Tov]] (founder of Hasidism) and the [[Magid of Mezritch]] (the Baal Shem Tov's successor and Rabbi Shneur Zalman's teacher and mentor).

The teachings of Rabbi [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]], the first Chabad Rebbe, form the basis of Chabad philosophy. Rabbi Shneur Zalman's teachings were greatly expanded upon by succeeding generations of Chabad Rebbes. One of the most central Chabad works is the ''[[Tanya]]'' by Rabbi Schneur Zalman, and many themes found in the Tanya receive greater treatment in subsequent works.

{{Chabad sidebar}}

== "Chabad" ==
According to Shneur Zalman's work ''[[Tanya]]'', the intellect consists of three interconnected processes: ''Chochma'' (wisdom), ''Bina'' (understanding), and ''Da'at'' (knowledge). While other branches of Hasidism focused primarily on the idea that "God desires the heart", Shneur Zalman argued that God also desires the mind, and that the mind is the "gateway" to the heart. With the Chabad philosophy, he elevated the mind above the heart, arguing that "understanding is the mother of fear and love for God".&lt;ref&gt;''Tanya', Shneur Zalman of Liadi, Chapter 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jonathan Sacks]], in Shneur Zalman's system, ''Chochma'' represents "the creation in its earliest potentiality; the idea of a finite world as was first born in the divine mind. ''Binah'' is the idea conceived in its details, the result of contemplation. ''Da'at'' is, as it were, the commitment to creation, the stage at which the idea becomes an active intention."&lt;ref name="sacks"&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Hasidism'', entry: Habad, Jonathan Sacks, pp. 161–164&lt;/ref&gt; While in Kabbala there are clearly delineated levels of holiness, in Hasidism and Chabad philosophy these are grounded in the mundanities of people's inner lives. So in reality — according to the Chabad analogy — ''Chochma'' is the birth of an idea in the mind, ''Binah'' is the contemplation, and ''Da'at'' is the beginning of the actualisation of an idea. Sacks argues that this provided a psychological formulation that enabled the hasid to substantiate his mystical thoughts. ''"This was an important advance because bridging the gap between spiritual insight and daily behaviour had always been a problem for Jewish [[mysticism]]."''&lt;ref name="sacks" /&gt;

Chabad philosophy argues that man is neither static nor passive nor dependent on others to connect to God.&lt;ref name="sacks" /&gt; Shneur Zalman rejected all ideas of aristocratic birth and elitism — he argued for meritocracy where all were capable of growth, every Jew — in his view — was capable of becoming a ''[[Tzadik]]''.&lt;ref name="masters"&gt;''Hasidism: The movement and its masters'', Harry M. Rabinowicz, 1988, pp. 83–92, Jason Aronson, London {{ISBN|0-87668-998-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chabad often contrasted itself with other schools (termed by Chabad thinkers as ''[[Chagat]]'') of Hasidism.&lt;ref&gt;"Chagat" is an acronym for "Chesed, Gevurah, Tiferet" (kindness, severity, beauty), the Kabbalistic terms for the three primary emotions.&lt;/ref&gt; While all Hasidism have a certain focus on the emotions, Chagat saw emotions as a reaction to physical stimuli, such as dancing singing or beauty. Shneur Zalman, on the other hand, taught that the emotions must be led by the mind, and thus the focus of Chabad thought was to be [[Torah]] study and prayer rather than [[esotericism]] and song.&lt;ref name="sacks" /&gt; As a Talmudist, Shneur Zalman endeavored to place Kabbalah and Hasidism on a rational basis. In ''[[Tanya]]'', he defines his approach as ''moach shalit al halev'' ([[Hebrew]]: "מוח שליט על הלב", "the brain ruling the heart").&lt;ref&gt;''Tanya'', ch. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
{{Jewish philosophy}}

===Prayer===
Prayer takes a central place in Chabad philosophy. In the Tanya, the desire to pray is referred to as the "desire for life".  Rabbi Shneur Zalman wrote to one Hassidic community, counselling those who were unable to remain at the synagogue for lengthy prayers, to leave early, rather than disturb the rest of the congregation.&lt;ref name="KuntAchron8"&gt;Shneur Zalman of Liadi. "Kutres Achron: Essay 8". Tanya. ''Kehot Publication Society''. Brooklyn: New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemplation===
A central position in Chabad philosophy is the notion that the ultimate service of God can be achieved through contemplation and other cognitive processes, rather than through emotions. Chabad philosophy differs from the teachings of other Hasidic groups in this regard, placing greater emphasis on the use of the mind's cognitive faculties in religious devotional efforts.&lt;ref&gt;"Chabad" is a kabbalistic acronym for the names of these cognitive faculties.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WeinerMystics"&gt;Weiner, Hebert, ''9½ Mystics'' ({{ISBN|00206-81607}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Chabad philosophy provides a conceptual approach to understanding God and other spiritual matters, maintaining that contemplating such topics constitutes [[Avodat Hashem]] ("the service of God").&lt;ref name=" Encyclopedia Shneur"&gt;Stroll, Avrum, ‘Encyclopaedia Judaica’’, Second Edition, Volume 18 pages 503–505 ({{ISBN|00286-59287}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Chabad philosophy also incorporated the teachings of Kabbalah as a means to deal with one's daily life and psyche. It teaches that every aspect of the world exists only through the intervention of God. Through an intellectual approach and meditations, Chabad teaches that one can attain complete control over one's actions.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Shneur" /&gt;

=== Torah study ===
Shneur Zalman fought against the perception that was prevalent in the early years of Hasidism that the movement neglected [[Talmud|Talmudic study]] by focusing too heavily on mysticism and obscurantism. He emphasized that mysticism without Talmudic study was worthless — even dangerous.&lt;ref name="masters"&gt;''Hasidism: The movement and its masters'', Harry M. Rabinowicz, 1988, pp. 83–92, Jason Aronson, London {{ISBN|0-87668-998-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without Talmudic study, he argued, the mind could never be elevated — and if the mind is not elevated, the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] will starve. On the other hand, he argued that while Torah was to be the focus of all study, it was also important to integrate the Torah's teachings into one's life. In a letter to [[Joshua Zeitlin]] of [[Shklow]], Shneur Zalman wrote: "The Hasidim, too, set aside time for study. The difference between them and the [[Misnagdim]] is this: the latter set time for study and they are limited by time, whereas the former make the Torah their path of life."&lt;ref name="masters" /&gt;

Shneur Zalman taught that Torah must be studied joyously – studying without joy is frowned upon. He provided a metaphor: when a ''[[mitzvah]]'' is fulfilled an angel is created. But if the ''mitzvah'' was joyless then the angel too will be dispirited. Thus, while Shneur Zalman emphasized that Hasidism focus on traditional Jewish scholarship rather than on mysticism, he was emphatic that this must be done with zeal and joy.&lt;ref name="masters" /&gt;

====Bible stories====
Rabbi Shneur Zalman stated that in the bible, lofty teachings are transcribed in the form of stories. Rabbi Shneur Zalman quotes an unnamed source, stating that studying such biblical episodes simply as stories does not constitute the fulfillment of the Jewish commandment of "Torah study".&lt;ref name="ShneurZalmanParshiot"&gt;Shneur Zalman of Liadi. "Inyan Shene'emar B'imaot". Ma'amari Admur Hazoken: Parshiot v'Moadim. Vol 1. ''Kehot Publication Society''. Brooklyn: New York. (1983):168. [http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=32919&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=181 Available on HebrewBooks.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610205944/http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=32919&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=181 |date=June 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kabbalah===
In Chabad thought, the study of [[Kabbalah]] is seen, in some instances, not only as an act of religious study, but as a way to fulfill other Jewish commandments. In the Tanya, the study of Kabbalah is divided between the study of [[Seder Hishtalshelus]] (the Kabbalistic theory of the evolution of the universe), and the study of the esoteric meaning of the commandments. The study of the commandments is said to be a superior form of study, because it relates more closely to the performance of mitzvoth, and in some cases, is considered to take the place of the commandment itself.&lt;ref name="KuntAchron4"&gt;Shneur Zalman of Liadi. "Kutres Achron: Essay 4". Tanya. ''Kehot Publication Society''. Brooklyn: New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Seder Hishtalshelus''===
''[[Seder Hishtalshelus]]'' ({{lang-he|סדר השתלשלות}}), meaning "Order of Development/Evolution", refers in [[Kabbalah]] and [[Hasidic thought]] to the chain-like descent of Spiritual Worlds (''Olam/Olamot'') between God and Creation. Each spiritual ''Olam-World'' denotes a complete realm of existence, resulting from its general proximity or distance to Divine revelation. Each realm is also a form of consciousness reflected in this World through the psychology of the soul. The concept of ''Seder Hishtalshelus'' is explored in numerous Chabad philosophical works.

===Love of God===
According to Rabbi Shneur Zalman, there are two main forms of human love for God. One form, called the "natural love", is one that is brought about through the subjection of bodily drives, the other, "produced love", is the result of contemplation on topics which arouse such emotions.&lt;ref name="ShaarYichudIntro"&gt;Shneur Zalman of Liadi. "Sha'ar Yichud V'emuna: Introduction". Tanya. ''Kehot Publication Society''. Brooklyn: New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Love of one's fellow===
''Ahavat Yisrael'' ([[Hebrew]]: אהבת ישראל, "love for one’s fellow Jew") is a biblical precept,&lt;ref&gt;“Love your fellow like yourself” (Leviticus 19:18).&lt;/ref&gt; greatly elaborated in Chabad thought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/83594/jewish/Maamar-Heichaltzu.htm Schneersohn, Shalom Dovber. "Maamar Heichaltzu". ''Chabad.org''.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tanya32"&gt;Shneur Zalman of Liadi. "Lekuttei Amarim Tanya: Chapter 32". Tanya. ''Kehot Publication Society''. Brooklyn: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Tanya, Rabbi Shneur Zalman states that the obligation to love one's fellow Jew extends even to sinners.&lt;ref name="Tanya32"/&gt;

===Charity===
In Chabad thought, charity is seen not only as a physical act of giving, but as a conduit for spiritual enlightenment. In the Tanya, giving charity is said to draw inspiration and bring about humility.&lt;ref name="KuntAchron7"&gt;Shneur Zalman of Liadi. "Kutres Achron: Essay 7". Tanya. ''Kehot Publication Society''. Brooklyn: New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unity ===
Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]] advanced, in his writings and lectures, a proposed unity between opposing concepts. He proposed that it was possible to unite the mundane aspects of the world with the aspect of "godliness" in the world. Schneerson emphasized the significance of creating an "abode for God on this world". Consequently, he encouraged his followers to unite a life in the modern world with the teachings of Judaism. He felt that the world was not a contradiction to the word of God, and it was to be embraced rather than shunned.&lt;ref name="WeinerMystics" /&gt;

Schneerson taught that the use of modern technology does not necessarily contradict a life of spirituality. For that reason, Chabad has consistently utilized modern technology to spread its message. Since its inception, Chabad have used the radio, and later television, satellite feeds, and the Internet to spread its message.&lt;ref name="Zaleski 1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zaleski |first=Jeffrey P. |title=The Soul of Cyberspace: How New Technology Is Changing Our Spiritual Lives |date=June 1997 |publisher=Harpercollins |isbn=0-06-251451-2 |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=335578 |accessdate=April 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Dirah Betachtonim''===
''[[Dira Betachtonim]]'' ({{lang-he|דירה בתחתונים}}) is the process of manifesting the presence of God within the world. An examination of ''Dirah Betachtonim'' is found in ''[[Samech Vov]]'' by the fifth [[Chabad]] Rebbe, Rabbi [[Sholom Dovber Schneersohn]]. In ''Samech Vov'', this concept is described as the ultimate purpose of creation.&lt;ref name=66b&gt;Paltiel, Yosef Y. [http://www.insidechassidus.org/maamarim/27-samech-vav-earliest-paltiel-version-.html Samech Vav.] ''Inside Chassidus.'' insidechassidus.org. Accessed April 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dirah Betachtonim'' is also explored by the seventh Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel. Central to the ''Dirah Betachtonim'' concept is the notion of sublimating the physical aspects of existence.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Faitel. [http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/294285/jewish/A-Synopsis-of-the-Dirah-Betachtonim-System.htm A Synopsis of the Dirah Betachtonim System]. ''Chabad.org''. Accessed April 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Bitul Hayesh'' ===
In Chabad philosophy, ''yeshut'' ("selfhood" or "self-assertion") is seen as the antithesis to ''yichud'' ("unity"), a denial of the reality that God "fills the heavens and the earth" and that there is none besides Him. ''Bitul Hayesh'' means total self-negation and a conscious awareness of the ultimate nature of man.&lt;ref&gt;Schochet, J. Immanuel. ''The Mystical Dimension''. Kehot Publication Society. 1990. Pages 50-52.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bitul Hayesh'' is achieved by one's reflection on God's greatness, exaltedness and majesty. For when one feels that they are in the presence of God, they will feel a sense of insignificance and humility. And at the same time, the worshiper will feel a passionate adoration for God, and a desire to cleave to God.&lt;ref&gt;Mindel, Nissan. ''The Divine Commandments''. Kehot Publication Society. 1992. Page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other concepts==
A number of other important concepts in Chabad philosophy are referenced in scattered locations in Chabad literature. Though these topics were discussed in brief and were not the focus of any major work, new insights have been drawn from their treatment in Chabad thought.

===Roles of rebbe and hasid===
In its earlier formulations, Hasidic thought had elevated the rebbe to a level above that of typical hasid. A rebbe was closer to God, his prayers were more amenable to Him, and a hasid should satisfy himself with attachment to the Rebbe and hence indirectly to God. A rebbe was to be a living example of perfection and would concern himself with intellectualism on behalf of the followers.&lt;ref name="sacks" /&gt; According to Sacks, Chabad stressed the individual responsibilities of every Jew: "The rebbe...became more of a teacher and adviser, recognising the vocation of each of his followers, guiding them towards it, uncovering their strengths, and rejoicing in their achievements."&lt;ref name="sacks" /&gt;

In Chabad thought, the Rebbe is not an intermediary between the Hasid and God. Rather, the role of the rebbe was to train followers to become spiritually self-sufficient and to turn to their Rebbe for instructions rather than intercession with God, miracles or blessings.&lt;ref name="masters" /&gt;

Hasidism traditionally demanded that every Hasid personally participate in the dissemination of Torah and Judaism to one's surroundings and seek out the benefit of one's fellow Jew. Rabbi Sholom Dovber Schneersohn said: ''A Hasid is he who surrenders himself for the benefit of another.''&lt;ref&gt;Sefer Hasichos 5700 p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond this, Chabad demands ''pnimiyut'' (inwardness / sincerity): one should not act superficially, as a mere act of faith, but rather with inner conviction.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mystical Dimension'' vol. 3 by Jacob Emanuel Schochet. [[Kehot Publication Society]] 1995 p.198.({{ISBN|0826605303}})&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship the Chabad Hasid has with the Rebbe is called ''hiskashrus''. Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn stated, "A bond with me (''hiskashrus'') is made by studying my ma'amorim of Hasidut, by fulfilling my request concerning the daily recital of [[Book of Psalms|Tehillim]], and the like."&lt;ref&gt;HaYom Yom, entry for 24 Sivan; et al.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaploun Uri. "The Gashmiyus of a Rebbe". Chabad.org. http://chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/96057/jewish/The-Gashmiyus-of-a-Rebbe.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In a continuation of longstanding Chabad tradition, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson demanded that each individual exert themselves in advancing spiritually, and ''not'' rely on the Rebbe to do it for them.&lt;ref&gt;Toras Menachem vol. 2 p. 212–213&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major texts==

=== Tanya ===
{{Main|Tanya}}

''[[Tanya|Sefer HaTanya]]'', Shneur Zalman's magnum opus, is the first schematic treatment of Hasidic moral philosophy and its metaphysical foundations.&lt;ref name="sacks" /&gt; The original name of the first book is ''Sefer Shel Beinonim'', the "Book of the Intermediates." It is also known as ''Likutei Amarim'' — "Collected Sayings." ''Sefer Shel Beinonim'' analyzes the inner struggle of the individual and the path to resolution. Citing the biblical verse "the matter is very near to you, in your mouth, your heart, to do",&lt;ref&gt;Deuturonomy 30:14.&lt;/ref&gt; the philosophy is based on the notion that the human is not inherently evil; rather, every individual has an inner conflict that is characterized with two different inclinations, the good and the bad.&lt;ref name="sacks tanya"&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Hasidism'', entry: Tanya, Jonathan Sacks, pp. 475–477 (15682–11236)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have argued that Shneur Zalman's moderation and synthesis saved the general Hasidic movement from breaking away from Orthodox Judaism. It allowed for mystically inclined Hasidim to be familiarized with traditional Jewish scholarship and observance, and for traditionalists to access Hasidism within the framework of Jewish scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;''The Messiah of Brooklyn: Understanding Lubavitch Hasidim Past and Present'', M. Avrum Ehrlich, Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Collective responsibility''' refers to [[Social responsibility|responsibilities]] of organizations, groups and societies. By which individuals who are part of such collectives to be responsible for other people's actions and occurrences by tolerating, ignoring, or harboring them, without actively engaging.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} For Arendt it varies from collective guilt as guilt is a personal and self indulgent emotion. Instead it is a call to action to take responsibility for the actions a government takes out in your name as a citizen.

==In religion==

{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
This concept is found in the [[Old Testament]] (or Tanakh), some examples include the account of the [[Noah's Ark|Flood]], the [[Tower of Babel]], [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] and in some interpretations, the [[Book of Joshua]]'s [[Achan (Bible)|Achan]]. In those records entire communities were punished on the act of the vast majority of their members, however it is impossible to state that there were no innocent people, or children too young to be responsible for their deeds.

The practice of [[Jewish deicide|blaming the Jews for Jesus' death]] is the longest example of collective responsibility.  In this case, the blame was cast not only on the Jews of the time but upon successive generations. This comes from Matthew 27:25-66 New International Version (NIV) 25: "All the people answered, 'His blood is on us and on our children!'"

==Collective punishment==
{{main|Collective punishment}}
[[File:Bekanntmachung Warschau 1943.jpg|thumb|Announcement of execution of 100 Polish ''[[roundup (history)|roundup]]'' (pol: ''łapanka'') hostages as revenge for assassination of 5 German policemen and 1 SS-man by [[Armia Krajowa]]'s resistance movement (referred to in the text as: a Polish "terrorist organization in British service"). Warsaw, 2 October 1943]]
Collective responsibility in the form of collective punishment is often used as a disciplinary measure in closed institutions, e.g. [[boarding schools]] (punishing a whole class for the actions of one known or unknown pupil), military units, prisons (juvenile and adult), psychiatric facilities, etc. The effectiveness and severity of this measure may vary greatly, but it often breeds distrust and isolation among their members. Historically, collective punishment is a sign of [[authoritarian]] tendencies in the institution or its home society.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} For example, in the Soviet [[Gulag]]s, all members of a ''brigada'' (work unit) were punished for bad performance of any of its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alexopoulos|first=Golfo|date=January 2008|title=Stalin and the Politics of Kinship: Practices of Collective Punishment, 1920s–1940s|url=|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collective punishment is also practiced in situation of war, [[economic sanctions]], etc., presupposing the existence of collective guilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/politics/faculty/dickson/dickson_collectivepunishment.pdf|title=On the (in) effectiveness of collective punishment: An experimental investigation|last=Dickson|first=Eric|date=|website=NYU.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collective guilt, or guilt by association, is the controversial collectivist idea that individuals who are identified as a member of a certain group carry the responsibility for an act or behavior that members of that group have demonstrated, even if they themselves were not involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fletcher|first=George|date=January 2004|title=Collective Guilt and Collective Punishment|url=|journal=Theoretical Inquiries in Law 5, no. 1|volume=|pages=163-178|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary systems of criminal law accept the principle that guilt shall only be personal.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Others view groups as being entities in themselves (an [[entitative]] group), capable of holding guilt or responsibility independent of any of the group's members.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} [[Shooting of the Romanov family|The mass shootings of Nicholas II's family]] in 1918 may be regarded as an example of such an approach.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Terror groups of all kinds bomb civilians who are seen as collectively responsible for the acts of their leaders.  The state level bombing of civilians became popular in the Twentieth Century although ancient warriors would often slaughter whole cities if they resisted demands for capitulation or tribute.  

During the [[Nazi crimes against the Polish nation|occupation of Poland by Nazi Germany]], the Germans applied collective responsibility: any kind of help given to a person of Jewish faith or origin was punishable by death, and that not only for the rescuer but also for his/her family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/righteous/stories/ulma.asp|title=Jozef &amp; Wiktoria Ulma - The Righteous Among The Nations - Yad Vashem|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/righteous/stories/wegrzynowska.asp|title=Vasiuta Wegrzynowska and her children - Righteous Among the Nations|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/righteous/stories/wolska.asp|title=Malgorzata Wolska and her children - Righteous Among the Nations|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was widely publicized by the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citinet.net/ak/polska.php?Page=27&amp;Lang=EN|title=Info|publisher=citinet.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww2today.com/19th-june-1943-the-nazi-abuse-of-the-polish-people-continues|title=The Nazi abuse of the Polish people continues - WWII Today|date=19 June 2013|website=ww2today.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the occupation, for every German killed by a Pole, 100-400 Poles were shot in retribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projectinposterum.org/docs/survivors_print.htm|title=Project InPosterum: Forgotten Survivors. Polish Christians Remember The Nazi Occupation&lt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communities were held collectively responsible for the purported Polish counter-attacks against the invading German troops. Mass executions of ''[[łapanka]]'' hostages were conducted every single day during the [[Wehrmacht]] advance across Poland in September 1939 and thereafter.&lt;ref name="Chodakiewicz-Between"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TvUErL-MnV8C&amp;dq=Marek+Jan+Chodakiewicz,+Between+Nazis+and+Soviets&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=Between Nazis and Soviets: Occupation Politics in Poland, 1939-1947 |publisher=Lexington Books |author=[[Marek Jan Chodakiewicz]] |year=2004 |pages=92, 105, 118, and 325 |ISBN=0739104845 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is when after the war, [[History of German settlement in Central and Eastern Europe|ethnic Germans in Central and Eastern Europe]] were held collectively responsible for [[Nazi]] crimes, resulting in numerous atrocities against the German population, including killings (see [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II]] and [[Beneš decrees]]).&lt;ref&gt;Steffen Prauser and Arfon Rees, [http://cadmus.iue.it/dspace/bitstream/1814/2599/1/HEC04-01.pdf "The Expulsion of 'German' Communities from Eastern Europe at the end of the Second World War"], cadmus.iue.it, European University Institute, Florence. HEC No. 2004/1, pp. 53–54; accessed 26 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In business==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
As the business practices known as [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) and [[sustainability]] mature and converge with the responsibilities of governments and citizens, the term "collective responsibility" is beginning to be more widely used.

Collective responsibility is widely applied in corporations, where the entire workforce is held responsible for failure to achieve corporate targets (for example, profit targets), irrespective of the performance of individuals or teams which may have achieved or overachieved within their area. [[Collective punishment]], even including measures that actually further harm the prospect of achieving targets, is applied as a measure to 'teach' the workforce.

==In culture==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
The concept of collective responsibility is present in literature, most notably in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s "[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]", a poem telling the tale of a ship's crew who died of thirst because they approved of one crew member's killing of an [[albatross]].

1959's ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' and 1983's prison [[crime drama]] ''[[Bad Boys (1983 film)|Bad Boys]]'' depict collective responsibility and punishment.
The play 'An Inspector Calls' by J.B Priestley also features the theme of collective responsibility throughout the investigation process.

== Criticism ==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
In ethics, both methodological individualists and normative individualists question the validity of collective responsibility.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Methodological individualists challenge the very possibility of associating moral agency with groups, as distinct from their individual members, and normative individualists argue that collective responsibility violates principles of both individual responsibility and fairness''. ([[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2011/entries/collective-responsibility/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Marion|last=Smiley|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=1 January 2011|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Normally, only the individual actor can accrue culpability for actions that they freely cause. The notion of collective culpability seems to deny individual moral responsibility. Does collective responsibility make sense? History is filled with examples of a wronged man who tried to avenge himself, not only on the person who has wronged him, but on other members of the wrongdoer's family, tribe, ethnic group, religion, or nation.

[[File:French - Casket with Scenes of Romances - Walters 71264 - Right.jpg|thumb|Ivory French casket with scenes of romances – possibly a courtship gift. Held in the [[Walters Art Museum]].]]'''Courtship''' is the period of development towards an [[intimate relationship]] wherein a couple get to know each other and decide if there will be an [[engagement]]. A courtship may be an informal and private matter between two people or may be a public affair, or a formal arrangement with family approval.  Traditionally, in the case of a formal engagement, it has been perceived that it is the role of a male to actively "court" or "woo" a female, thus encouraging her to understand him and her receptiveness to a proposal of marriage.

== Duration ==
The average duration of courtship varies considerably throughout the world.  Furthermore, there is vast individual variation between couples. Courtship may be completely omitted, as in cases of some [[arranged marriage]]s where the couple do not meet before the wedding.

In the [[United Kingdom]], a poll of 3,000&lt;ref name=mc&gt;"[http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/world/181134/average-man-proposes-after-three-years.html  Average man proposes after three years]" ''Marie Claire'' 18 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; engaged or married couples resulted in an average duration between first meeting and accepted [[proposal of marriage]] of 2 years and 11 months,&lt;ref name=mc/&gt;&lt;ref name=metro&gt;[http://www.metro.co.uk/metrosexual/article.html?in_article_id=99603&amp;in_page_id=8 Average man takes 3 years to propose] Metrosexual, Sunday, February 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; with the women feeling ready to accept at an average of 2 years and 7 months.&lt;ref name=mc/&gt; Regarding duration between proposal and wedding, the UK poll above gave an average of 2 years and 3 months.&lt;ref name=metro/&gt;

== Traditions ==
[[Image:Youth and suitors.jpg|thumb|left|''Youth conversing with suitors''&lt;br&gt;from the ''Haft Awrang'' of [[Jami]], in the story ''A Father Advises his Son About Love.'']]The date is fairly casual in most European-influenced cultures, but in some traditional societies, courtship is a highly structured activity, with very specific formal rules.

In some societies, the parents or community propose potential partners and then allow limited dating to determine whether the parties are suited. In [[Japan]], there is a such type of courtship called [[Miai|Omiai]], with similar practices called "Xiangqin" (相親) in the [[Greater China Area]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite document|last=Thelmaw|first=Ritgerõ|date=September 2015|title=Courtship in Japan and Iceland|url=http://skemman.is/stream/get/1946/22794/52148/1/Ritger%C3%B0_Thelmaw.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents will hire a matchmaker to provide pictures and [[résumé]]s of potential mates, and if the couple agrees, there will be a formal meeting with the matchmaker and often parents in attendance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The matchmaker and parents will often exert pressure on the couple to decide whether they want to marry or not after a few dates.

[[Courtship in the Philippines]] is one known complex form of courtship. Unlike what is regularly seen in other societies, it takes a far more subdued and indirect approach.&lt;ref name="phrasebase.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phrasebase.com/archive/tagalog/82-courtship-in-philippine-culture.html|title=COURTSHIP IN PHILIPPINE CULTURE - Sociology|website=www.phrasebase.com|access-date=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is complex in that it involves stages, and it is considered normal for courtship to last a year or longer. It is common to see the male showing off by sending love letters and love poems, singing romantic songs, and buying gifts for the female. The parents are also seen as part of the courtship practice, as their approval is commonly needed before courtship may begin or before the female gives the male an answer to his advances.&lt;ref name="phrasebase.com" /&gt;

In more closed societies, courtship is virtually eliminated altogether by the practice of arranged marriages&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in which partners are chosen for young people, typically by their parents. Forbidding experimental and serial courtship and sanctioning only arranged matches is partly a means of guarding the chastity of young people and partly a matter of furthering family interests, which, in such cultures, may be considered more important than individual romantic preferences.

Throughout history, courtship has often included traditions such as exchanging [[valentines]], written correspondence (which was facilitated by the creation of the postal service in the nineteenth century), and similar communication-based courting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | last = Maurer | first = Elizabeth | title = "The History of Romance" | publisher = National Women's History Museum | year = 2017 | url = https://www.womenshistory.org/articles/history-romance}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over recent decades, though, the concept of arranged marriage has changed or simply been mixed with other forms of dating, including Eastern and Indian ones; potential couples have the opportunity to meet and date each other before one decides on whether or not to continue the relationship.

==Modern people==
{{Main|Dating}}
In the earlier 1800s, young adults were expected to court with the intention of finding a marriage partner, rather than for social reasons. In more traditional forms of Christianity, this concept of courtship has been retained, with [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]] defining courtship and distinguishing this concept from dating, stating that:&lt;ref name="PiperTaylor2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Piper|first1=John|last2=Taylor|first2=Justin|title=Sex and the Supremacy of Christ|date=14 June 2005|publisher=Crossway|isbn=9781433517907|page=146}}&lt;!--|accessdate=4 July 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|Courtship ordinarily begins when a single man approaches a single woman by going through the woman's father, and then conducts his relationship with the woman under the authority of her father, family, or church, whichever is most appropriate. Courtship always has marriage as its direct goal...Dating, a more modern approach, begins when either the man or the woman initiates a more-than-friends relationship with the other, and then they conduct that relationship outside of any oversight or authority. Dating may or may not have marriage as its goal.&lt;ref name="PiperTaylor2005"/&gt;}}
[[Minister (Christianity)|Christian minister]] Patricia Bootsma delineates this distinction, writing that in contrast to the modern conception of dating, in "courtship, time together in groups with family or friends is encouraged, and there is oversight by and accountability to parents or mentors".&lt;ref name="Bootsma2015" /&gt; She further states that with courtship, "commitment happens before intimacy".&lt;ref name="Bootsma2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bootsma|first=Patricia|title=Raising Burning Hearts: Parenting and Mentoring Next Generation Lovers of God|date=9 April 2015|publisher=Forerunner Publishing|isbn=9781938060229|page=81}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 July 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, in the 1820s, the phrase "date" was most closely associated with prostitution. However, by the [[Jazz Age]] of the 1920s, dating for fun was becoming a cultural expectation, and by the 1930s, it was assumed that any popular young person would have lots of dates. This form of dating, though, was usually more chaste than is seen today, since premarital sex was not considered the norm.

===Courtship in social theory===
Courtship is used by a number of theorists to explain gendering processes and sexual identity.  Scientific research into courtship began in the 1980s after which time academic researchers started to generate theories about modern dating practices and norms.  Both Moore and Perper found that, contrary to popular beliefs, courtship is normally triggered and controlled by women,&lt;ref&gt;Perper, T. (1985) ''Sex Signals: The Biology Of Love'', Philadelphia, ISI Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = N | year = 1985 | title = Nonverbal courtship patterns in women: contact and consequences | url = https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Monica_Moore3/publication/246974326_Nonverbal_courtship_patterns_in_women_Context_and_consequences/links/55c37d6e08aeb975674014ba/Nonverbal-courtship-patterns-in-women-Context-and-consequences.pdf | journal = Ethology and Sociobiology | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 237–247 | doi=10.1016/0162-3095(85)90016-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; driven mainly by non-verbal behaviours to which men respond.

This is generally supported by other theorists who specialise in the study of body language.&lt;ref&gt;Pease, A. and Pease, B.

=== Courtship in Australia ===
Courtship in Australia is generally reserved to those with religious affiliation. As a standard rule, dating is widely accepted; along with inter-racial relationships, gay/lesbian relationships, pre-marital sex and abortion.&lt;ref name="Putzi"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Putzi|first=Sibylla|date=December 2008|title=A to Z World Lifecycles : 175 Countries: Birth, Childhood, Coming of Age, Dating and Courtship, Marriage, Family and Parenting, Work Life, Old Age and Death|url=http://site.ebrary.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/lib/notredameaustralia/detail.action?docID=10305899|journal=World Trade Press|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lot of the Australian values are derived from British courtship culture; therefore, marriage practices are much the same. Modern western culture has taken over, leading to more and more people committing to partnerships through dating. Before entering marriage, a lot of Australian couples like to live with each other to get an idea of what married life would be like. This would not happen in a courtship as both people vow to chastity and often like to keep a chaperone around.&lt;ref name="Putzi" /&gt;

===Commercial dating services===            
As technology progressed the dating world followed. In a Time-line by Metro, a statistic [[Matchmaking|match-making]] business opened in 1941, the first reality TV dating show was developed in 1965 and by the 1980s the public was introduced to video dating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mulshine|first1=Molly|title=The 80s version of Tinder was 'video dating' — and it looks incredibly awkward|url=http://www.techinsider.io/found-footage-awkward-80s-video-dating-2015-12|website=Tech Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video Dating was a way for singles to sit in front of a camera and tell whomever may be watching something about themselves. The [[process of elimination]] was significant because now the viewer was able hear their voice, see their face and watch their body language to determine a [[physical attraction]] to the candidates.

In [[online dating]], individuals create profiles where they disclose personal information, photographs, hobbies, interests, religion and expectations. Then the user can search through hundreds of thousands of accounts and connect with multiple people at once which in return, gives the user more options and more opportunity to find what meets their standards. Online dating has influenced the idea of [[choice]]. In ''[[Modern Romance: An Investigation]]'', [[Aziz Ansari]] states that one third of marriages in the United States between 2005-2012 met through online dating services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ansari|first1=Aziz|title=Modern Romance|date=2015|publisher=Penguin Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-1-59420-627-6|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today there are hundreds of sites to choose from and websites designed to fit specific needs such as [[Match.com|Match]], [[Eharmony.com|Eharmony]], [[Okcupid.com|Okcupid]], [[Zoosk]], and [[ChristianMingle.com|Christianmingle]]. Mobile apps, such as [[Grindr]] and [[Tinder (app)|Tinder]] allow users to upload profiles that are then judged by others on the service; one can either swipe right on a profile (indicating interest) or swipe left (which presents another possible mate).

Many animal species have mate-selection rituals also referred to as "courtship" [[anthropomorphic]]ally. Animal courtship may involve complicated dances or touching, vocalizations, or displays of beauty or fighting prowess. Most animal courtship occurs out of sight of humans and so it is often the least documented of animal behaviors. One animal whose courtship rituals are well studied is the [[bower bird]] whose male builds a "bower" of collected objects.

From the scientific point of view, courtship in the animal kingdom is the process in which the different species select their partners for reproduction purposes. Generally speaking, the male initiates the courtship and the female chooses to either mate or reject the male based on his "performance".

===Sea turtles===
[[Image:Courtship of green turtles.jpg|thumb|250px|Courtship of [[green turtle]]s]]
All animals have different courtship rituals that reflect fitness, compatibility with others and ability to provide. Sea turtles court during a limited receptive time. During the courtship males will either
nuzzle the females head to show affection or by gently biting the back of her
neck.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conserveturtles.org/seaturtleinformation.php?page=behavior|title=www.conserveturtles.org/seaturtleinformation.php?page=behavior|website=www.conserveturtles.org|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may go on for long periods of time depending on if the female
responds to the male. If the female does respond, by not fleeing, the male will
attach himself onto the back of the female’s shell using his front flippers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He
will stretch his long tail under the back of the females shell to begin
copulation.

Courting can be competitive among males. The male
that has better endurance will win the female. To a female, endurance is a great
trait to be passed on to their offspring, the higher the endurance in the male
the higher the endurance will be in her offspring and the more likely they will
be to survive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Female Leatherback sea turtles will also choose many different
males to copulate with in order to diversify their offspring since it is known
that Leatherback sea turtles have female-biased offspring.

===Hippopotamus===
Hippopotamus are commonly misconceived as being
aggressive animals, when in actuality the mothers are very nurturing and
sensitive.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hippoworlds.com/hippopotamus-reproduction/|title=Hippopotamus Reproduction - Hippopotamus Facts and Information|website=www.hippoworlds.com|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mating and birth both occur in the water for hippopotamus. This
because it gives them privacy when conceiving and it helps conserve energy
during birth. The female hippo normally averages around 5–6 years while males
are average an age of 7-8.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; During mating season the male hippopotamus will find
a mate out of the herd, showing interest by smelling the female’s dorsal end.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Hippopotamus_amphibius/|title=Hippopotamus amphibius (hippopotamus)|website=Animal Diversity Web|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As
long as the male acts submissive during courting season the adults in the herd
will not interfere. Once the male finds the female he wants to mate with, he
begins provoking the female. He then will push the female into the water and
mounts her. In order to alert the herd or other animals that may be lurking
around the male will let a loud wheezing sound.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Preceding birth the female
exhibits aggressive behavior leaving the herd until after the birth of the
calf. Although hippopotamus can mate anytime of the year, the mating season
ranges from February to August. Because the energy cost is high, the female
generally only has one offspring in a two years span.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Honeybees===

The courtship behaviour of honey bees follows through two distinct types:
Apiary Vicinity Mating and Drone Assembly Mating respectively.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dave-cushman.net/bee/matingbehaviour.html|title=Mating Behaviour in Honey Bees|last=Cushman|first=Dave|website=www.dave-cushman.net|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apiary vicinity
mating usually takes place in weather that is cool and is more local to the
apiary from which the queen resides.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The drones are in the same
apiary too but do not mean that it will lead to inbreeding. Drones assemble in
a bulb of warm air close or far from the apiary. They are alert when the queen
has flown out of the hive and will follow her route. This is followed by a sort
of fast hum or buzz in the general bee population that follows an upward
temperature gradient.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The male drone mounts on the virgin queen and inserts
his endophallus, ejaculating semen.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.orkin.com/stinging-pests/bees/mechanics-of-honey-bee-mating/|title=Mechanics of Honey Bee Mating: Honey Bee Mating Habits|website=Orkin.com|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The male honey bee will then pull away from the queen, but his endophallus will be ripped from his body and remain attached to the newly fertilized queen. The next male honey bee will remove the endophallus that was previously left by the other male honey bee and will eventually ejaculate and lose his own.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The frequency of mating for the male
honey bees is seven to 10 times during a mating flight. Most of the drones die
quickly immediately after mating, and their abdomen rips open since the
endophallus has been removed.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The few that survive are usually ejected from
their nests, as they have served their sole purpose by mating .

They only attend one mating flight
and queen stores up to 100 million sperm within her oviducts during this
flight, but only five to six million are stored in the spermatheca of the
queen.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Only a few of this sperm are used by the queen at a time to fertilize
the eggs throughout her life. New queen generations will mate and produce their
colonies if the queen runs out of sperm in her lifetime. The sex of the
offspring is controlled by the honey bee queens as the eggs passing through the
oviduct can be determined whether they are fertilized or not by the queen.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Research has indicated that eggs that are fertilized develop into female workers and queens while the unfertilized eggs become drone honey bees. Female workers can lay infertile eggs but do not mate. The infertile eggs become male honey bees. The eggs of the queen are laid in oval-shaped structural cells that usually stick to the nest ceiling. Royal jelly is then filled with these cells to prevent larvae from falling.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Soon-to-be workers are fed royal jelly during the first two days. The future queens are given royal jelly throughout the entire larval period. Each member colony development depends on
caste. For proper growth from eggs to adult, the male honey bees need 24 days,
21 for workers and only 16 for the queens.

'''David Papineau''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|æ|p|ɪ|n|oʊ}}; born 1947) is a British academic philosopher, born in [[Como]], Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidpapineau.co.uk/short-biography.html|title=David Papineau|website=www.davidpapineau.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; He works as Professor of Philosophy of Science at [[King's College London]] and the [[City University of New York Graduate Center]] having previously taught for several years at [[Cambridge University]] where he was a fellow of [[Robinson College, Cambridge|Robinson College]].

==Biography==
Papineau was born in Italy and grew up in Trinidad, England and South Africa.{{cn|date=July 2018}} He received a BSc in mathematics from the [[University of Natal]] and a BA and PhD in philosophy from the University of Cambridge under the supervision of [[Ian Hacking]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

He has worked in [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], and the [[philosophies of science]], [[Philosophy of mind|mind]], and [[Philosophy of mathematics|mathematics]]. His overall stance is [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist]] and [[Philosophical realism|realist]]. He is one of the originators of the [[Naturalization of intentionality#Related_theories|teleosemantic theory]] of [[mental representation]], a solution to the problem of [[intentionality]] which derives the intentional content of our beliefs from their biological purpose. He is also a defender of the ''[[a posteriori]]'' [[physicalist]] solution to the [[mind-body problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/still-roving/|title=physical|work=[[3:AM Magazine]]|date=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papineau was elected President of the [[British Society for the Philosophy of Science]] for 1993–5, of the [[Mind Association]] for 2009–10 and of the [[Aristotelian Society]] for 2013-4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aristoteliansociety.org.uk/the-proceedings/the-2013-14-programme/david-papineau/|title=David Papineau |work=[[Aristotelian Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His latest book ''Knowing the Score'' (2017) is written for a general readership, and looks at a number of ways in which sporting issues cast light on long-standing philosophical problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/26/knowing-the-score-david-papineau-review|title=Knowing the Score by David Papineau review – sport meets philosophy|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=William Skidelsky|date=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18968">'''Faith and rationality''' are two ideologies that exist in varying degrees of conflict or compatibility. [[Rationality]] is based on [[reason]] or [[facts]]. [[Faith]] is belief in [[Biblical inspiration|inspiration]], [[revelation]], or [[authority]]. The word ''faith'' sometimes refers to a belief that is held with lack of reason or evidence, a belief that is held in spite of or against [[reason]] or [[evidence]], or it can refer to belief based upon a degree of evidential warrant.

Although the words ''faith'' and ''belief'' are sometimes erroneously conflated{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} and used as synonyms, ''faith'' properly refers to a particular type (or subset) of ''belief,'' as defined above.

Broadly speaking, there are two categories of views regarding the relationship between faith and rationality:
#[[Rationalism]] holds that [[truth]] should be determined by [[reason]] and factual analysis, rather than faith, [[dogma]], tradition or religious teaching.
#[[Fideism]] holds that faith is necessary, and that beliefs may be held without any evidence or reason and even in conflict with evidence and reason.

The [[Catholic Church]] also has taught that true [[faith]] and correct [[reason]] can and must work together, and, viewed properly, can never be in conflict with one another, as both have their origin in God, as stated in the [[Papal encyclical]] letter issued by [[Pope]] [[John Paul II]], ''[[Fides et Ratio]]'' ("[On] Faith and Reason").

==Relationship between faith and reason==
From at least the days of the Greek Philosophers, the relationship between faith and reason has been hotly debated. [[Plato]] argued that knowledge is simply memory of the eternal. [[Aristotle]] set down rules by which knowledge could be discovered by reason.

Rationalists point out that many people hold irrational beliefs, for many reasons. There may be evolutionary causes for irrational beliefs — irrational beliefs may increase our ability to survive and reproduce. Or, according to [[Pascal's Wager]], it may be to our advantage to have faith, because faith may promise infinite rewards, while the rewards of reason are seen by many as finite. One more reason for irrational beliefs can perhaps be explained by operant conditioning. For example, in one study by [[B. F. Skinner]] in 1948, pigeons were awarded grain at regular time intervals regardless of their behaviour.  The result was that each of pigeons developed their own idiosyncratic response which had become associated with the consequence of receiving grain.&lt;ref name=Skinner&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skinner|first=B. F.|title='Superstition' in the pigeon.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|date=1 January 1948|volume=38|issue=2|pages=168–172|doi=10.1037/h0055873|pmid=18913665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Believers in faith — for example those who believe salvation is possible through faith alone — frequently suggest that everyone holds beliefs arrived at by faith, not reason. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pages = 255| last = Rosental| first = Creighton J| title = The reconciliation of faith and reason in Thomas Aquinas.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The belief that the universe is a sensible place and that our minds allow us to arrive at correct conclusions about it, is a belief we hold through faith. Rationalists contend that this is arrived at because they have observed the world being consistent and sensible, not because they have faith that it is.

Beliefs held "by faith" may be seen existing in a number of relationships to rationality:
* '''Faith as underlying rationality''': In this view, all human [[knowledge]] and reason is seen as dependent on [[faith]]: faith in our senses, faith in our [[reason]], faith in our [[Memory|memories]], and faith in the accounts of events we receive from others. Accordingly, faith is seen as essential to and inseparable from rationality. According to [[René Descartes]], rationality is built first upon the realization of the absolute truth "[[Cogito ergo sum|I think therefore I am]]", which requires no faith. All other rationalizations are built outward from this realization, and are subject to [[Falsifiability|falsification]] at any time with the arrival of new evidence.
* '''Faith as addressing issues beyond the scope of rationality''': In this view, faith is seen as covering issues that science and rationality are inherently incapable of addressing, but that are nevertheless entirely real. Accordingly, faith is seen as complementing rationality, by providing answers to questions that would otherwise be unanswerable.
* '''Faith as contradicting rationality''': In this view, faith is seen as those views that one holds despite evidence and reason to the contrary. Accordingly, faith is seen as pernicious with respect to rationality, as it interferes with our ability to think, and inversely rationality is seen as the enemy of faith by interfering with our beliefs.
* '''Faith and reason as essential together''': This is the Catholic view that faith without reason leads to [[superstition]], while [[reason]] without [[faith]] leads to [[nihilism]] and [[relativism]].
* '''Faith as based on warrant''': In this view some degree of evidence provides warrant for faith. "To explain great things by small."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawker|first=Robert|title=Poor Man's Commentary|year=1805|pages=Hebrews 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views of the Roman Catholic Church==
[[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]], the most important [[Doctor of the Church#Catholicism|doctor of the Catholic Church]], was the first to write a full treatment of the relationship, differences, and similarities between faith—an intellectual assent&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm Faith]" from the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''&lt;/ref&gt;—and reason,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12673b.htm Reason]" from the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''&lt;/ref&gt; predominately in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', ''[[De Veritate (Thomas Aquinas)|De Veritate]]'', and ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]''.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview—with copious quotes from [[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]]'s works, some of which are quoted here—of his exposition of the topic of faith and reason, consult [https://web.archive.org/web/20120323175836/http://www.truthinspire.com/reason-and-faith/ truthinspire.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Council of Trent]]'s [[catechism]]—the ''[[Roman Catechism]]'', written during the Catholic Church's [[Counter-Reformation]] to combat [[Protestantism]] and [[Martin Luther]]'s antimetaphysical tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BeckerFaith.pdf Faith and Reason in Martin Luther]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On the differences between [[Thomas Aquinas]]'s conception of faith and reason and that of [[Martin Luther]].{{cite journal |journal=''The Thomist'' |title=Faith and Reason Reconsidered: Aquinas and Luther on Deciding What is True |author=Bruce D.

''[[Dei Filius]]'' was a [[dogmatic constitution]] of the [[First Vatican Council]] on the [[Roman Catholic]] faith. It was adopted unanimously on 24 April 1870 and was influenced by the philosophical conceptions of [[Johann Baptist Franzelin]], who had written a great deal on the topic of faith and rationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds2.v.ii.i.html#v.ii.i-p21.5|title=Creeds of Christendom, with a History and Critical notes.

Because the Roman Catholic Church does not disparage reason, but rather affirms its veracity and utility, there have been many [[List of Roman Catholic cleric–scientists|Catholic scientists]] over the ages.

Twentieth-century [[Thomism|Thomist]] philosopher [[Étienne Gilson]] wrote about faith and reason&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u.arizona.edu/~aversa/scholastic/gilson/|title="Faith and Reason" by Étienne Gilson|work=arizona.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his 1922 book ''Le Thomisme''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/lethomismeintrod01gilsuoft|title=Le thomisme; introduction au système de saint Thomas d'Aquin|work=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; His contemporary [[Jacques Maritain]] wrote about it in his ''The Degrees of Knowledge''.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/DegreesOfKnowledge&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Fides et Ratio]]'' is an encyclical promulgated by Pope John Paul II on 14 September 1998. It deals with the relationship between faith and reason.

[[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s 12 September 2006 [[Regensburg Lecture]] was about faith and reason.

==Lutheran epistemology==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}
Some have asserted that [[Martin Luther]] taught that faith and reason were antithetical in the sense that questions of faith could not be illuminated by reason.  Contemporary Lutheran scholarship however has found a different reality in Luther. Luther rather seeks to separate faith and reason in order to honor the separate spheres of knowledge that each understand. Bernhard Lohse for example has demonstrated in his classic work "Fides Und Ratio" that Luther ultimately sought to put the two together. More recently [[Hans-Peter Großhans]] has demonstrated that Luther's work on Bibilical Criticism stresses the need for external coherence in right exegetical method. This means that for Luther it is more important that the Bible be reasonable according to the reality outside of the scriptures than that the Bible make sense to itself, that it has internal coherence. The right tool for understanding the world outside of the Bible for Luther is none other than Reason which for Luther denoted science, philosophy, history and empirical observation. Here a differing picture is presented of a Luther who deeply valued both faith and reason, and held them in dialectical partnership. Luther's concern thus in separating them is honoring their different epistemological spheres.

==Reformed epistemology==

===Faith as underlying rationality===
The view that faith underlies all rationality holds that rationality is dependent on faith for its coherence. Under this view, there is no way to comprehensively ''prove'' that we are actually seeing what we appear to be seeing, that what we remember actually happened, or that the laws of logic and mathematics are actually real. Instead, all beliefs depend for their coherence on ''faith'' in our senses, memory, and reason, because the foundations of rationalism cannot be proven by evidence or reason. Rationally, you can not prove anything you see is real, but you can prove that you yourself are real, and rationalist belief would be that you can believe that the world is consistent until something demonstrates inconsistency. This differs from faith based belief, where you believe that your world view is consistent no matter what inconsistencies the world has with your beliefs.

===Rationalist point of view===
In this view, there are many beliefs that are held by faith alone, that rational thought would force the mind to reject. As an example, many people believe in the Biblical story of Noah's flood: that the entire Earth was covered by water for forty days. But objected that most plants cannot survive being covered by water for that length of time, a boat of that magnitude could not have been built by wood, and there would be no way for two of every animal to survive on that ship and migrate back to their place of origin. (such as penguins), Although Christian apologists offer answers to these and such issues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ham|first=Ken|title=Was There Really a Noah's Ark &amp; Flood?|url=http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/nab/really-a-flood-and-ark|work=Answers in Genesis|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wright|first=David|title=How Did Plants Survive the Flood?|url=http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/aid/v7/n1/how-did-plants-survive-flood|work=Answers in Genesis|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How did animals get from the Ark to isolated places..|url=http://christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c006.html|work=Christian Answers Network|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the premise that such responses are insufficient, then one must choose between accepting the story on faith and rejecting reason, or rejecting the story by reason and thus rejecting faith.

Within the rationalist point of view, there remains the possibility of multiple rational explanations.  For example, considering the biblical story of Noah's flood, one making rational determinations about the probability of the events does so via interpretation of modern evidence.  Two observers of the story may provide different plausible explanations for the life of plants, construction of the boat, species living at the time, and migration following the flood.  Some see this as meaning that a person is not strictly bound to choose between faith and reason.

==Evangelical views==
American biblical scholar [[Archibald Thomas Robertson]]  stated that the Greek word ''pistis''  used for faith in the New Testament  (over two hundred forty times), and  rendered "assurance" in Acts 17:31 (KJV), is "an old verb to furnish, used regularly by Demosthenes for bringing forward evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robertson|first=Archibald Thomas|title=WORD PICTURES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT|pages=Chapter 17|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/robertson_at/wp_acts.xviii.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise Tom Price (Oxford Centre for Christian Apologetics) affirms that  when the New Testament talks about faith positively it only uses words derived from the Greek root [pistis] which means "to be persuaded."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Price|first=Thomas|title=Faith is about 'just trusting' God isn't It?|url=http://www.bethinking.org/bible-jesus/introductory/faith-is-about-just-trusting-god-isnt-it.htm|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to faith meaning  blind trust, in the absence of evidence, even in the teeth of evidence, [[Alister McGrath]] quotes  Oxford Anglican theologian W. H. Griffith-Thomas, (1861-1924),  who states faith is "not blind, but intelligent"  and "commences with the conviction of the mind based on adequate evidence...", which McGrath sees as  "a good and reliable definition, synthesizing the core elements of the characteristic Christian understanding of faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McGrath|first=Alister E.|title=The Order of Things: Explorations in Scientific Theology|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=140512556X|page=33|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WrRZBOxJzDcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alvin Plantinga]] upholds that faith may be the result of evidence testifying to the reliability of the source of truth claims, but although it may involve this,  he sees faith as being the result of hearing the truth of the gospel with the internal persuasion by the Holy Spirit moving and enabling him to believe.  "Christian belief is produced in the believer by the internal instigation of the Holy Spirit, endorsing the teachings of Scripture, which is itself divinely inspired by the Holy Spirit. The result of the work of the Holy Spirit is faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|title=Warranted Christian Belief|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=USA|isbn=0195131924|pages=250, 291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish philosophy==
The 14th Century Jewish philosopher [[Levi ben Gerson]] tried to reconcile faith and reason.  He wrote, "The Torah cannot prevent us from considering to be true that which our reason urges us to believe."&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Encyclopedia, volume VIII, page 29&lt;/ref&gt;  His contemporary [[Hasdai ben Abraham Crescas]] argued the contrary view, that reason is weak and faith strong, and that only through faith can we discover the fundamental truth that God is love, that through faith alone can we endure the suffering that is the common lot of God's chosen people.

[[File:Feliks Młynarski.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Feliks Młynarski]]
'''Feliks Młynarski''' (20 November 1884 – 13 April 1972) was a Polish banker, philosopher and economist.

==Biography==
Feliks Młynarski was born to Jan Młynarski, a school teacher, and Honorate née Jędrzejowska. He attended a [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in [[Jarosław]], but because of his involvement in organizing meetings in favor of Polish independence, he was expelled by the [[Austrian partition of Poland|Austrian]] authorities, and had to finish his secondary education at a school in [[Sanok]], in 1903.

Młynarski finished the [[Jagiellonian University]] in Poland.&lt;ref name="Lerski1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jerzy Jan Lerski|title=Historical Dictionary of Poland, 966–1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QTUTqE2difgC&amp;pg=PA359|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-26007-0|page=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a youth, he was active in the ''[[endecja]]'' movement, but broke ranks with it prior to [[World War I]] due to its leader [[Roman Dmowski]]'s pro-Russian orientation.&lt;ref name="Lerski1996"/&gt; In 1914 he joined [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]], and spent some time in the United States recruiting members for the Legions from among the [[American Polonia]].&lt;ref name="Lerski1996"/&gt;

After the war he joined the newly formed government of the [[Second Polish Republic]]. In the years 1921–1923 he directed the Emigration Office. From 1923 he was employed at the Ministry of Finance, and the following year he became the director of the Currency Department of the Ministry.&lt;ref name="Lerski1996"/&gt; He took part in the [[Grabski Monetary Reform]] of 1924,&lt;ref name="Lerski1996"/&gt; which ended [[hyperinflation]] in [[Second Polish Republic|interwar Poland]]&lt;ref name="KozminskiCushman1993"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrzej Kozminski|author2=Donald P. Cushman|title=Organizational Communication and Management: A Global Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D-M4saJWYx8C&amp;pg=PA169|date=7 January 1993|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-1306-7|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a co-creator of the (second) [[Bank of Poland]] for which he served as vice-president between September 1924 and September 1924.&lt;ref name="Lerski1996"/&gt; In the years 1925–1927 he helped negotiated several economic agreements between Poland and the United States.&lt;ref name="Lerski1996"/&gt; He fell out of favor with the ''[[sanacja]]'' government of [[Józef Piłsudski]] and resigned from governmental positions in 1929.&lt;ref name="Lerski1996"/&gt; In the 1930s he taught at the [[Warsaw Trade Academy]], and consulted for the [[League of Nations]] on currency issues.&lt;ref name="Lerski1996"/&gt;

During [[World War II]] he became, with the approval of the [[Polish Government in exile]], the president of the German operated [[Bank of Issue in Poland]]. As a result, the currency notes used during the occupation were popularly known as "''[[Młynarki]]''", after him.&lt;ref name=gojski&gt;Andrzej Gojski, ''Etapy i cele niemieckiej polityki bankowej w GG.

After the war, in 1945, he became a member of the [[Polish Academy of Science]] in [[People's Republic of Poland]].&lt;ref name=tygodniksalwatorski&gt;http://tygodniksalwatorski.icm.com.pl/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=5433&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1945 and 1948 he taught at the [[Jagiellonian University]] in Kraków. His war time collaboration with the Germans, even through approved by the Polish underground government of that time, cast a shadow on his career, and resulted in refusal to grant him a professorship position.&lt;ref name=tygodniksalwatorski/&gt;&lt;ref name=pt&gt;http://www.polskietradycje.pl/authors.php?author=209&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as the director of the library of [[Cracow University of Economics]].&lt;ref name=pt/&gt;

==Works==
Młynarski authored numerous works from the fields of economy, sociology and philosophy.&lt;ref name="Lerski1996"/&gt;

In his 1929 book ''Gold and Central Banks'' Młynarski identified a fundamental instability in a gold-based international monetary system: the reserve currency countries would tend to accumulate foreign reserves, but as the volume of these grew relative to the country's gold reserves, international investors would begin to fear suspension of convertibility. The resulting outflow of reserves could create significant worldwide deflationary pressures and possibly lead to the collapse of the gold-based system. After World War II, the same problem was identified by the Belgian economist [[Robert Triffin]], but in relation to the [[Bretton Woods system]] and became known as the [[Triffin dilemma]]. Due to Młynarski's precedence in articulating the problem, [[Barry Eichengreen]] has suggested renaming the problem to "the Młynarski dilemma".&lt;ref name="eichengreen"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qk1flhynCD8C&amp;dq=Feliks+Mlynarski&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | title=Golden Fetters: The Gold Standard and the Great Depression, 1919–1939 | publisher=Oxford University Press – NBER series on Long Term  Factors in Economic Development | author=Eichengreen, Barry | authorlink=Barry Eichengreen | year=1996 | pages=20, 203–204 | isbn=0195101138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Hayashi Gahō'''|林 鵞峰|extra=July 21, 1618 – June 1, 1688}}, also known as '''Hayashi Shunsai''', was a Japanese [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] scholar, teacher and administrator in the system of higher education maintained by the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa ''bakufu'']] during the [[Edo period]]. He was a member of the [[Hayashi clan (Confucian scholars)|Hayashi clan]] of Confucian scholars.

Following in the footsteps of his father, [[Hayashi Razan]], Gahō (formerly Harukatsu) would devote a lifetime to expressing and disseminating the official neo-Confucian doctrine of the Tokugawa shogunate.  Like his distinguished father, Gahō's teaching and scholarly written work emphasized Neo-Confucianist virtues and order.&lt;ref&gt;Ponsonby-Fane, R. (1956). ''Kyoto: the Old Capital of Japan, 794-1869,'' p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academician==
Gahō became the unofficial [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of what would become Edo’s Confucian Academy, the [[Shōhei-kō]] (afterwards known as the [[Yushima Seidō]]).&lt;ref name="nussbaum300"&gt;Nussbaum, Louis Frédéric ''et al.''. (2005). ''Japan Encyclopedia,'' p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; This institution stood at the apex of the country-wide educational and training system which was created and maintained by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]].  Gahō's hereditary title was ''[[Daigaku-no-kami]],'' which, in the context of the Tokugawa shogunate hierarchy, effectively translates as "head of the state university.''&lt;ref&gt;Ponsonby-Fane, p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the elevated context his father engendered, Gahō worked on editing a chronicle of Japanese emperors compiled in conformance with his father's principles.  ''[[Nihon Ōdai Ichiran]]'' grew into a seven-volume text which was completed in 1650.  Gahō himself was accepted as a noteworthy scholar in that period; but the potent Shōhei-kō and Hayashi family links to the work’s circulation are part of the explanation for this work's 18th and 19th century popularity.  Contemporary readers must have found some degree of usefulness in this summary drawn from historical records.

The narrative of ''Nihon Ōdai Ichiran'' stops around 1600, most likely in deference to the sensibilities of the Tokugawa regime.  Gahō's text did not continue up through his present day; rather, he terminated the chronicles just before the last pre-Tokugawa ruler.  Gahō  modestly observed that "in a book intended for the shogun's eyes, it is incumbent upon one to be circumspect."&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20060910x2.html Hoffman, Michael. "A man in the soul of Japan"], ''Japan Times,'' September 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  This book was published in the mid-17th century and it was reissued in 1803, "perhaps because it was a necessary reference work for officials."&lt;ref&gt;Screech, ''Secret Memoirs of the Shoguns: Isaac Titsingh and Japan, 1779-1822.'' p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gahō would become his father's successor as advisor to the shogun.&lt;ref name="nussbaum300"/&gt;  He was, in his lifetime, the Tokugawa shogunate's chief scholar.  After Razan's death, Gahō finished work his father had begun, including a number of other works designed to help readers learn from Japan's history.  In 1665, Gahō published an anthology of historical poems (''Honchō Ichinin Isshu'').&lt;ref&gt;Keene, Donald. (1999). ''Travelers of a Hundred Ages,'' p.430.&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1670, the Hayashi family's scholarly reputation was burnished when Gahō published the 310 volumes of {{nihongo|''The Comprehensive History of Japan''|本朝通鑑|''Honchō-tsugan''}}.&lt;ref&gt;Brownlee, John. (1999). ''Political Thought in Japanese Historical Writing,'' p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with his brother, [[Hayashi Dokkōsai]] (formerly Morikatsu), Gahō compiled, edited and posthumously published selections from their father's body of writings:
* ''Hayashi Razan bunshū'' (''The Collected Works of Hayashi Razan''), reissued in 1918
* ''Razan Sensei Isshū'' (Master Razan's Poems''), reissued in 1921

Gahō's son, [[Hayashi Hōkō]] (formerly Nobuatsu), would eventually inherit the position as head of the Shōhei-kō or Yushima Seidō, as well as the honorific ''Daigaku-no kami;'' and his progeny would continue the Hayashi traditions.

In January 1858, it would be the hereditary ''Daigaku-no-kami'' descendant of Hayashi Razan and Hayashi Gahō who would head the bakufu delegation which sought advice from the emperor in deciding how to deal with newly assertive foreign powers.  This would have been the first time the Emperor's counsel was actively sought since the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate.  The most easily identified consequence of this transitional overture would be the increased numbers of messengers which were constantly streaming back and forth between Tokyo and Kyoto during the next decade.  There is no small irony in the fact that this 19th-century scholar/bureaucrat would find himself at a crucial nexus of managing political change—moving arguably "by the book" through uncharted waters with well-settled theories as the only guide.&lt;ref&gt;Ponsonby-Fane, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Congressional '''International Religious Freedom (IRF) Caucus''' is a bi-partisan group of nearly 60 members of the [[United States Congress]] who address religious persecution for people of any or no faith based on Article 18 of the [[United Nations Declaration of Human Rights]].  The IRF Caucus has always addressed [[religious freedom]] within the broader context of [[human rights]] in the spirit of the [[International Religious Freedom Act of 1998]] (IRFA). The Caucus plays a critical role in raising the profile of numerous [[religious freedom]] issues in Congress and with both the Bush and Obama Administrations, and led to the release of many individuals imprisoned for their faith and ensures relief for many suffering under religious persecution.&lt;ref name="The Becket Fund" group="The Becket Fund"&gt;{{cite web|last=The Becket Fund|title=Biography of Tina Ramirez|url=http://www.becketfund.org/author/TinaRamirez/|publisher=The Becket Fund|accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The IRF Caucus was established on the belief that, by ensuring that Congress proactively promotes greater respect for religious freedom in American policy with foreign governments, individuals throughout the world would experience greater freedom and dignity with respect to other rights that closely intertwine with the freedom of religion.  Indeed, states that actively ensure the freedom of religion benefit from greater political stability, economic prosperity, and social harmony, and in turn create greater international peace.

Established in 2006 by [[bipartisan]] co-founders [[Trent Franks]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] from [[Arizona]], and [[Emanuel Cleaver, II]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[Missouri]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/arena/bio/rep_trent_franks.html|accessdate=26 March 2012|newspaper=POLITICO}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Caucus has worked to ensure that this freedom, which was so foundational to America's democratic history, remains a priority in United States foreign policy, development, and refugee law. With nearly 60 members, the Caucus enjoys broad bipartisan and multi-faith support as it highlights ways to ensure greater respect for an individual's freedom of religious belief throughout the world.  In doing so, the Caucus utilizes international standards as a basis for defining an individual's right to freedom of religious belief, including Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which states:

Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.

The Caucus has been an important vehicle for the coordination of religious freedom advocacy in Congress, enabling Members to learn about and become more involved in engaging on this important issue. Over the coming months, we will continue to coordinate any issues members are interested in by hosting briefings, raising cases, coordinating sign-on letters, and discussing strategies for influencing greater respect for religious freedom in US foreign policy.

In the past, the Caucus has held several public hearings on the religious freedom situation in countries such as Bahrain, Bangladesh, Burma, China, Egypt, India, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, North Korea, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Turkey, and Vietnam.  In addition, the Caucus has raised dozens of specific cases of persecution in urgent need of attention with foreign governments.  Most recently, the Caucus coordinated efforts to secure the release of individuals imprisoned for their faith or human rights activities, including Sayed Mussa in Afghanistan and Kareem Abdul Soleiman Amer in Egypt, the safety and asylum of persecuted individuals, and the defeat of the "defamation of religions" resolution at the United Nations.

== Leadership ==
The co-chairs for the International Religious Freedom Caucus are [[Trent Franks]], a Republican from [[Arizona]], and [[Heath Shuler]], a Democrat from [[North Carolina]].

'''Jakob Friedrich Fries''' ({{IPA-de|fʁiːs|lang}}; 23 August 1773 – 10 August 1843) was a [[Germany|German]] [[post-Kantian]]&lt;ref name="Pinkard"&gt;[[q:Terry Pinkard|Terry Pinkard]], ''German Philosophy 1760-1860: The Legacy of Idealism'', Cambridge University Press, 2002, pp. 199–212.&lt;/ref&gt; [[philosopher]]. 

==Biography==
Fries studied [[theology]] at the academy of the [[Moravian Church|Moravian Brethren]] at [[Niesky]] and [[philosophy]] at the Universities of [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and [[University of Jena|Jena]]. After travelling, in 1806 he became [[professor]] of philosophy and elementary [[mathematics]] at the [[University of Heidelberg]].

Though the progress of his psychological thought compelled him to abandon the [[positive theology]] of the Moravians, he retained an appreciation of its spiritual or symbolic significance. His philosophical position with regard to his contemporaries had already been made clear in his critical work ''Reinhold, Fichte und Schelling'' (1803),&lt;ref&gt;A comparative study of [[Karl Leonhard Reinhold]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]].&lt;/ref&gt; and in the more systematic treatises ''System der Philosophie als evidente Wissenschaft'' (1804) and ''Wissen, Glaube und Ahnung'' (1805).

Fries' most important treatise, the ''Neue oder anthropologische Kritik der Vernunft'' (2nd ed., 1828–1831), was an attempt to give a new foundation of psychological analysis to the [[critical philosophy]] of [[Immanuel Kant]]. In 1811 he published his ''System der Logik'' (ed. 1819 and 1837), and in 1814 ''Julius und Evagoras'', a philosophical [[Romantic novel|romance]]. He was also involved in public polemics, and in 1816 wrote ''Ueber&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; die Gefährdung des Wohlstandes und des Charakters der Deutschen durch die Juden'' (''On the Danger Posed by the Jews to German Well-Being and Character''), advocating among other things a distinct sign on the dress of Jews to distinguish them from the general population, and encouraging their emigration from German lands. He blamed the Jews for the ascendant role of money in society and called for Judaism to be "extirpated root and branch" from German society.

In 1816 he was invited to Jena to fill the chair of theoretical philosophy (including mathematics, [[physics]], and philosophy proper), and entered upon a crusade against the prevailing [[Romanticism]]. In [[politics]] he was a strong [[Liberal (politics)|Liberal]] and [[German unification|Unionist]], and he did much to inspire the organization of the [[Burschenschaft]]. He also published a pamphlet calling for the exclusion of the Jews from public life in Germany. In 1816 he had published his views in a brochure, ''Von deutschem Bund und deutscher Staatsverfassung'', dedicated to "the youth of Germany", and his influence gave a powerful impetus to the agitation which led in 1819 to the issue of the [[Carlsbad Decrees]] by the representatives of the German governments.

[[Karl Ludwig Sand|Karl Sand]], the murderer of [[August von Kotzebue]], was one of Fries's pupils; and a letter of his, found on another student, warning Sand against participation in secret societies, was twisted by the suspicious authorities into evidence of Fries' conspiracy. He was condemned by the [[Mainz Commission]]; the [[Charles Augustus, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Grand Duke of Weimar]] was compelled to deprive him of his professorship; and he was forbidden to lecture on philosophy. The grand duke, however, continued to pay him his stipend, and in 1824 he was recalled to Jena as professor of mathematics and physics, receiving permission also to lecture on philosophy in his own rooms to a select number of students. Finally, in 1838, the unrestricted right of lecturing was restored to him.

Fries was involved in a dispute with the contemporary German philosopher [[G. W. F. Hegel]]. In the preface to his ''[[Philosophy of Right]]'', Hegel criticised Fries' participation in student events and his role in the ''[[Burschenschaft]]''. In Hegel's view, Fries was dependent upon "immediate perception and contingent imagination";&lt;ref&gt;G. W. F. Hegel, ''Elements of the Philosophy of Right'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1991, pp. 15–6&lt;/ref&gt; his views were emotional rather than rational. Hegel argued that Fries' methodology was not sufficiently scientific and that, therefore, his conclusions were illogical. Fries responded by accusing Hegel of defending the existing order and his own privileged position within it. He argued that "Hegel's metaphysical mushroom has grown not in the gardens of science but on the dunghill of servility."&lt;ref&gt;J. F. Fries, Letter of 6 January 1821 in Gunther Nicolin, ''Hegel in Berichten seiner Zeitgenossen'', Felix Meiner, Hamburg, 1970, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; For Fries, Hegel's theories merely added up to a defence of the establishment and, specifically, the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] authorities.

'''Kairos''' (from Greek ''[[καιρός]]'',"&lt;ref&gt;
"There are two Greek words for time: chronos and Kairos. Chronos emphasizes duration, succession of moments, chronological time. Kairos does not. Kairos is the Lord's Time, and is judged, not by its succession or duration but by its value, the intensity of the experience of God's presence in the midst of the Christian community." [http://www.trinity.wa.edu.au/faith_dev/campus_ministry/retreats/kairos/kairos_home.htm Trinity College Campus Ministry] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225152843/http://www.trinity.wa.edu.au/faith_dev/campus_ministry/retreats/kairos/kairos_home.htm |date=February 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[retreat (spiritual)|retreat program]]  for [[high school]] and [[college]].
Kairos is part of the larger [[three-day movement]] in America, ultimately derived from the [[Cursillo]] movement founded in [[Spain]] in 1944. As such, the retreat is a four-day, three-night (or three-day, two-night in some cases) residential retreat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marincatholic.org/index/kairos |title=Kairos |publisher=Marincatholic.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of providing participants the chance to "[[Christian contemplation|contemplate]] God's role in their lives".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/offices/ministry/IgSoc/Kairos.html Boston College: Kairos Retreats]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was first held in 1965, and under its current name since 1979. It is conceptually based in [[Ignatian spirituality]], as put forth in the [[Spiritual Exercises]] of [[St. Ignatius Loyola]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usfca.edu/university_ministry/kairos_retreat%282%29/ |accessdate=July 20, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002234016/http://www.usfca.edu/university_ministry/kairos_retreat%282%29/ |archivedate=October  2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Kairos retreats are organized by hundreds of Catholic high schools in the United States, especially [[Jesuit]] schools, and they are also offered by certain schools in Australia, Ireland, Britain, Canada and Switzerland (in English and French).{{cn|date=February 2013}}

==History==
The Kairos retreat program is based on the Cursillo retreat program and was developed in 1965 by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn|Diocese of Brooklyn]], in the [[United States]]. A team of priests, brothers, and lay people under the direction of Fr. Douglas L. Brown of the Brooklyn Diocese made use of the [[Cursillo|Cursillo Retreat]] format, which has its roots in Ignatian spirituality, but adapted it for older teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oaklandcatholic.org/student-resources/school-spirituality/kairos/ |accessdate=April 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101012015205/http://www.oaklandcatholic.org/student-resources/school-spirituality/kairos/ |archivedate=October 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The retreat was immediately successful and within three years it was adopted in Connecticut, California, Arizona, Illinois, Missouri, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Texas, Virginia, Kentucky, Washington D.C. and eventually Michigan and Wisconsin. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siprep.org/ministry/retreats.cfm |accessdate=April 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129191132/http://siprep.org/ministry/retreats.cfm |archivedate=November 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December, 1975, Fr. Bob Colaresi, O.Carm, from [[Joliet Catholic High School]], further developed the program and made a retreat that was first called "Chiros" by Fr. Kevin McBrien. In March 1979, it was properly spelled Kairos. By 1995 the program had spread to 21 Jesuit high schools throughout the [[United States]] and dozens of others including Capuchin, Lasallian, Dominican, Carmelite, Franciscan and several other orders.

==Current form==
The retreat is usually led mostly by the peers of the participants.&lt;ref name="geo"&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/kairosnewyork/kairos.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+01:09:09  ''Kairos New York'']&lt;/ref&gt; 

Students who have been on the retreat typically come back with a better sense of the world and are more inclined to share their faith with others.

The team is composed of student leaders who have already been on the retreat and a few [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] from the school. Generally, each Kairos is headed by a student or recent graduate [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] who is responsible for the overall retreat experience and guides the leaders in creating the retreat.

The specificity of the Kairos retreat is that it focuses mostly on helping one find his or her own [[Personal god|personal relationship with God]] during a few days of discerning and discovery. Through the course of the retreat, the building of a strong [[community]] takes place, as there is a strong focus on the concepts of confidentiality and trust within the small groups and the entire retreat group as well.

Kairos retreats are often held at retreat houses removed from the hustle and bustle of mainstream society. With this concept in mind, the leaders of many Kairos retreats often request that the retreatants hand in their [[cell phones]] and other electronic devices, so that they can be more fully immersed in the experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xavierhs.org/s/717/images/editor_documents/Campus%20Ministry/KAIROS--RetreatantInfoGeneric.pdf |accessdate=April 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727084528/http://www.xavierhs.org/s/717/images/editor_documents/Campus%20Ministry/KAIROS--RetreatantInfoGeneric.pdf |archivedate=July 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Kechimyaku'''''|血脈}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term for a lineage chart in [[Zen Buddhism]] and some other Japanese schools, documenting the "bloodline" of succession of various masters or listing priests in a particular school. In Zen the kechimyaku theoretically links a student to all previous generations back to the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] himself. In the [[Sōtō]] school of [[medieval Japan]] it became commonplace for the kechimyaku to be administered to [[laity|lay]] students for such rituals as the [[jukai]] ceremony. Traditionally this document is administered at the time of [[Dharma transmission]] in Soto Zen, during a [[shiho]] ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Baroni, 182&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Jodo Shinshu]] sect the kechimyaku is meant to demonstrate "spiritual descent," and not a blood heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Plutschow, 153&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Khosrow Bagheri Noaparast''' (in [[Persian alphabet|Persian]]: خسرو باقری نوع پرست) is an [[Iran]]ian [[philosopher]], educational theorist and the president of [[Philosophy of Education Society of Iran]] (PESI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=انجمن فلسفه تعلیم و تربیت ایران |url=http://pesi.ir/index.php?module=htmlpages&amp;func=display&amp;pid=34 |script-title=چكيده هاي پذيرفته شده :: انجمن فلسفه تعلیم و تربیت ایران |trans-title=Philosophy of Education Society of Iran |publisher=Pesi.ir |language=Persian |date= |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=انجمن فلسفه تعلیم و تربیت ایران |url=http://pesi.um.ac.ir/index.php?module=htmlpages&amp;func=display&amp;pid=9 |script-title=هيات مديره |publisher=Pesi.um.ac.ir |trans-title= |language=Persian |date= |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Bagheri was born in 1957 in [[Tehran]]. He took his Ph. D degree from the [[University of New South Wales]], Australia, in 1994. He is Professor of [[Philosophy of education|Philosophy of Education]] at the [[University of Tehran]]. He has made contributions to a wide range of topics in philosophy of education, [[Religion]] and personal construct psychology; topics from different viewpoints, such as constructive realism, neo-Pragmatism, action theory, [[deconstruction]], [[Hermeneutics]], and Islamic philosophy of education. In 2011 he was awarded First order Medal of Research (The Distinguished Researcher) by the University of Tehran.&lt;ref&gt;http://eepat.net/doku.php?id=interviews:islam_philosophy_and_education{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical views==
===Religious education===
In his book ''Islamic Education'' he places human agency as the main educational thesis of Islam. This is while before him scholars such as [[Mutahari]] believed in human nature as the center of Islamic education. He opposes nature as a central key to Islamic education claiming that human beings are not a piece of non-living object to be fabricated into a human being. Instead human is a dynamic creature who should choose being religious. in this regard he has introduced abstinence by presence. While most scholars have insisted that religion is about preventing sinful situations Bagheri insists that real education leads to presence in a sinful situation and yet remaining intact.&lt;ref&gt;Bagheri Noaparast. "Islamic Education". Al-Hoda Publications, Tehran, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal construct theory===
He argues that in George Kelly's [[personal construct psychology]] a combination of [[correspondence theory of truth]] and a [[coherence theory of truth]] is necessary. offering criteria for a reconciliation of correspondence and coherence theories he argues that constructivism should be based on a reality and the effort is to search for an optimal point where reality and constructs reach each other.&lt;ref&gt;Bagheri Noaparast. "Toward a More Realistic Constructivism". in "Advances in Personal Construct Psychology", vol. 3, pp. 37-59, Jai Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warren."Philosophical dimensions of personal construct psychology".Vol. 4, Psychology Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neimeyer, R.A."Limits and lessons of constructivism some critical reflections". Journal of Constructivist Psychology, vol.8, no. 4, pp. 339-361, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Religious science===
Most Classic Islamic Philosophers believed in a naive realism or [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] based theories for achieving knowledge from the external world.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Either of these perspectives or a combination of them has led some to conclude that a science based on religion can lead to infallible knowledge. However, Bagheri argues that a religious science is only possible through interference of religious elements in the presupposition of a theory and hence will remain a science tout court, and its religious presuppositions will not guarantee an infallible knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Bagheri Noaparast. "The Idea of a Religious Social Science". Alhoda, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bagheri Noaparast &amp; Khosravi. "TOWARDS AN ISLAMIC PSYCHOLOGY: AN INTRODUCTION TO REMOVE THEORETICAL BARRIERS". Psychological Studies, Vol. 1, no. 4-5, 161-172, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bagheri Noaparast &amp; Khosravi. "THREE APPROACHES IN ISLAMIC SCIENCE: CASE STUDIES IN IRAN".

'''Lev Alexandrovich Tikhomirov''' ({{lang-ru|'''Лев Александрович Тихомиров'''}}; 1852, [[Gelendzhik]] – 1923, [[Sergiyev Posad]]), originally a Russian revolutionary and one of the members of the Executive Committee of the [[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Narodnaya Volya]], following his disenchantment with violent revolution became one of the leading conservative thinkers in Russia. He authored several books on [[monarchism]], Orthodoxy, and Russian political philosophy.

== Revolutionary ==
Lev Tikhomirov was born in [[Gelendzhik]] on January 19, 1852, to a military doctor and his wife, a graduate of the [[Smolny Institute|Institute for the Education of Noble Maidens]]. Despite receiving a conservative education, he came under the influence of radical ideas and became involved in the [[Narodniki]] movement. In 1873, Tikhomirov was arrested in connection with the [[Trial of the 193]] and sentenced to a four-year term in St Petersburg's Sts Peter and Paul Fortress.

[[File:Тихомиров, Лев Александрович (1852-1922).jpg|left|thumb|Tikhomirov in his early years]]
By 1878, Tikhomirov became one of the leaders of the [[Land and Liberty (Russia)|Land and Liberty]] organization. In August 1879, when Land and Liberty split into two factions as the result of a dispute over organizational tactics, he joined its most radical of the two successors, the [[People's Will]].

In 1882, following the assassination of Emperor [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], Tikhomirov emigrated to Switzerland and then to France. In France, however, he began to reconsider his views writing in 1886:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
From henceforth our only hope is Russia and the Russian people. We have nothing to gain from the revolutionaries ... In light of this, I have begun to reconsider my life. I must now build it in such a way so as to serve Russia according to the dictates of my conscience, independent of all parties.&lt;ref&gt;Tikhomoriv, L.A. ''Memoirs''. Moscow: 1927.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 1888, Tikhomirov publicly repented of his revolutionary activities, publishing his book ''Why I am No Longer a Revolutionary''. The same year he petitioned to be allowed to return to Russia, a petition granted by [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]].

In commenting on his earlier life, Tikhomirov wrote in his memoirs:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I do not like my youth. It is full of the passioned desires of a corrupt heart, full of impurity, full of a stupid pride, a pride of someone who, while realizing his potential, has not yet matured to analytical thinking or independence of thought. I only begin to like my life from that point (in my last years in Paris), when I matured and was liberated ... began to understand the meaning of life, began to seek God.&lt;ref&gt;Tikhomirov, L.A. ''Journals''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Conservative Thinker ==

Following his return from exile, Tikhomirov became one of the leading conservative thinkers of the Russian Empire. He authored several works criticizing liberal democracy, including "Liberals and Terrorists" (1890) and "Liberal and Social Democracy" (1896). He criticized democratic institutions for being controlled by party intrigue and for excessive individualism. He advocated finding a Russian alternative to the democratic idea, writing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We must seek other ways, understanding that great truth, which is now apparent given the negative experiences of the "new era": that organizing a society is only possible by keeping the spiritual balance in every man. And this spiritual balance comes from a living religious ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Tikhomirov, L.A. "Liberal and Social Democracy". Moscow: 1896&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1905, Tikhomirov authored his largest work, the four-volume ''On Monarchist Statehood'', which quickly became the ideological basis for the Russian monarchist movement. In it he asserted the existence of authority as a fundamental regulatory force in society. The type of authority - democratic, aristocratic, or monarchic - is rooted to the moral and psychological state of the society. Tikhomirov wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If a powerful moral ideal exists in a society, an ideal calling all to voluntary obedience to, and service of, one another, then it brings about monarchy because the existence of this ideal negates the need for physical force (democracy) or the rule of an elite (aristocracy). All that is necessary is the continual expression of this moral ideal. The most capable vehicle for this expression is one individual placed in a position of complete independence from all external political forces.&lt;ref&gt;Tikhomirov, L. A. ''On Monarchist Statehood''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1909, Tikhomirov became the editor of the State-owned monarchist newspaper ''Moskovskie Vedomosti''. However, in 1913 the Interior Ministry suspended funding for the paper and Tikhomirov resigned as its editor. He then moved to [[Sergiev Posad]], where he wrote his second largest work, ''On the Religious and Philosophical Fundamentals of History''.

In the Fundamentals of History, Tikhomirov argued that history is driven by two competing world views: the dualistic and the monistic. The dualistic recognizes the existence of God and the world created by God. The monistic asserts that the world has always existed of its own self. Tikhomirov then traces through all of history as the continual struggle of these two views, which will culminate at the apocalyptic end.

Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, Tikhomirov worked as a school secretary in Sergiev Posad. He died on October 10, 1923.

The following is a list of [[kōan]]s attributed to the [[Zen]] master [[Yunmen Wenyan]].

==Kōans==

*Ummon inquired of his monks, "This world is such a wide world! Why then do you answer to a temple bell and don ceremonial robes?"
*A monk asked Ummon, "What is the Dharma Kaya (the ultimate formless timeless reality)?". 
:Ummon replied: "A garden of medicinal flowers." 
:The monk then said, "Is that all I need to understand?" 
:Ummon replied: "If that isn't enough, then you'll need to see the mythical Golden-Haired Lion."

*A monk once asked Ummon, "What is the Dharma Kaya?" 
:Ummon answered: "The Six Ungraspables." (The Graspables are the five senses and the mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=AV Club|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/fargo-six-ungraspables-204626|title=Fargo: 'The Six Ungraspables', In which things begin to move
|authors=Handlen, Zack &amp; VanDerWerff, Todd| date=May 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

*When Ummon was asked "What is the pure Dharmakaya?", he replied: "The flowering hedge" (surrounding the privy).
*Ummon Zenji said: "Men of immeasurable greatness are tossed about in the ebb and flow of words."
*Of the Zen saying: "Buddha preached for forty-nine years, but his tongue never moved," the master Gensha said:

::"Pious teachers say that Buddhism helps us in every possible way, but think: how can it help the blind, the deaf, or the dumb?  The blind cannot see the teacher's staff that is raised before them.  The deaf cannot hear the teacher's words, no matter how wise.  The dumb cannot ask their questions or speak their understanding.  So since we cannot help these people, how can we say Buddhism helps in every possible way? What good is it?"

::Many years later a monk asked the master Ummon to explain these words of Gensha. After making the questioner prostrate himself and then rise, Ummon swiped at him with his staff. The monk jumped back.

::"Ah-ha!" said Ummon, "I see you are not blind!" Then he told the monk to come forward, which he did.

::"Ah-ha!" said Ummon, "I see you are not deaf!" Then he asked the monk if he understood what all this to-do was about. The monk said he did not. "Ah-ha!" said Ummon, "I see you are not dumb!"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*A Zen student told Ummon- "Brilliancy of Buddha illuminates the whole universe."
::Before he finished the phrase, Ummon asked: "You are reciting another's poem, are you not?"
::"Yes", answered the student.
::"You are sidetracked," said Ummon.
::Afterwards another teacher, Shishin, asked his pupils: "At which point did that student go off the track?"

*Tozan (Ummon's future successor as head of the Ummon school) went to Ummon. Ummon asked him where he came from. Tozan said, "From Sato Village."
::Ummon asked:  "In what temple did you remain for the summer?"
::Tozan replied, "The temple of Hoji, south of the lake."
::"When did you leave there?" asked Ummon, wondering how long Tozan would continue with such factual answers. 
::"The twenty-fifth  of August", answered Tozan.
::Ummon then said: "I should give you three blows, but today I forgive you."
::The  next day Tozan bowed to Ummon and asked, "Yesterday you forgave me three blows. I do not know why you thought me wrong." Ummon, rebuking Tozan's spiritless responses, said: "You are good for nothing! You simply wander from one monastery to another." Before Ummon's words were ended, Tozan was enlightened.

*Once Hsüeh-fêng came before the assembly and said, "In a southern mountain, there is a turtle-nosed serpent. You monks must have a good look at this creature." Ch'ang-ch'ing, Yün-mên, and Hsüan-sha were in the assembly. Ch'ang-ch'ing stepped forward and said: "In this hall someone will lose his body and life today." Yün-mên threw his staff down in front of Hsüeh-fêng and made a gesture as of fear at discovering the serpent. Hsüan-sha said, "Brother Ch'ang-ch'ing's answer has some substance to it. However, I should not say it thus, but ask why we refer to the southern mountain."
*Ummon asked the head monk, "What sutra are you lecturing on?"
::"The [[Nirvana Sutra]]."
::"The Nirvana Sutra has the Four Virtues, hasn't it?"
::"It has."
::Ummon asked, picking up a cup, "How many virtues has this?"
::"None at all, " said the monk.
::"But ancient people said it had, didn't they?"  said Ummon. "What do you think of what they said?" Ummon struck the cup and asked, "You understand?"
::"No," said the monk.
::"Then," said Ummon, "You'd better go on with your lectures on the sutra."

*Suigan, at the end of the annual summer meditation retreat, said to his monks, "The whole summer have I lectured you. Look! Has Suigan any eybrows?" Hofuku said: "A robber knows in his heart he is a thief." Chokei said, "Far from dropping off from too much talking, they have grown longer!" But then Ummon forcefully shouted '''"Kan!"'''
*Monk:  "What is the one road of Ummon?"
::Ummon: "Personal Experience!"
::Monk: "What is the Way?"
::Ummon: ""Go!"
::Monk: "What is the road, where is the Way?"
::Ummon: "Begin walking it!"

*A monk asked Ummon, "What will happen when the leaves fall and the trees become bare?" Ummon said, "Golden Wind!" (or, "The trunk is visible in the autumn wind.")
*Ummon once lived within a temple called the "Chapel of Holy Fruits". One morning, a government official visited him, and asked him, "Are your fruits well-ripened now?" "None of them has ever been called green", replied Ummon.
*A travelling monk asked Ummon, "What is the teaching given by Gautama Buddha during his lifetime?" Ummon replied: "The teaching confronts each."
*A monk asked Ummon. "What would the Shakyamuni Buddha have said if there were no one to hear and no occasion to teach?" Ummon answered: "The opposite of statement."
*One day Ummon stood up and said to his disciples: "If you do not see a man for three days, do not think he is the same man.  How about you?"  No one spoke, so he said: "One thousand!"
*A monk asked Ummon, "What is the kind of talk that transcends Buddhas and Patriarchs?" Ummon replied: "Rice cake!"
*A monk asked Ummon, "What is your family tradition?" Ummon replied thus: "Oh, it looks like students who wish to come to learn are already outside the gate."
*A monk asked Ummon, "What is Ummon's melody?" Ummon replied: "The twenty-fifth of December!"
*A monk asked Ummon, "What is the samadhi of each individual thing?" Ummon replied: "Rice in bowl, water in pail!"
*A monk asked Ummon, "No thoughts have risen. Are there any faults or not?" Ummon said: "[[Mount Sumeru]]!"
*Said Ummon to his disciples, "I do not ask you to say anything about before the fifteenth day of the month, but say something about after the fifteenth day of the month."  Because no monk could reply, Ummon answered himself and said, "[[Nichi nichi kore kōnichi|Every day is a good day]]!"
*Said Ummon to his disciples, "However wonderful a thing is, it may be that it is better not to have it at all."
*A monk asked Kenpo, "The one road of Nirvana leads into the ten quarters. But where does it begin?" Kenpo raised his staff and traced a horizontal line in the air. "Here."  Disappointed, the monk went to Ummon and asked him the same question.  Ummon held up his fan, and said: "This fan leaps up to the 33rd heaven and hits the presiding deity on the nose, then it dives down into the [[East China Sea|Eastern Sea]] where it hits the holy carp.  The carp becomes a dragon which then brings a flood of rain."
*One day, while lecturing his monks, Ummon asked them, "Do you want to meet the old Patriarchs?" Before any of the monks could answer, he pointed his stick above their heads and said, "The Patriarchs are jumping on your head!"  Then he asked, "Do you wish to look them in the eye?" He pointed to the ground and said: "They are all under our feet!"  After a moment, he spoke to himself, saying: "I made a great feast in the [[joss house]], but the hungry gods are never satisfied."
*A monk once asked Ummon, "What is this place where knowledge is useless?" Ummon answered him: "Knowledge and emotion cannot fathom it!"
*Yün-men asked: "If a person who is difficult to change should come to you, would you receive him?"
:The master answered: "Ts'ao-shan has no such leisure."

:Monk: "Where is the place from which all buddhas come?"
:Yun-men: "Next question, please!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Slate| title=You've Come a Long Way, Buddha ( With a little help from Tiger Woods and PBS, Buddhism may finally shake its counterculture image)|author=Stephenson, Wen|date=April 6, 2010| url= http://www.slate.com/id/2249958/pagenum/all/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Modibo Keïta''' (4 June 1915 – 16 May 1977) was the first [[President of Mali]] (1960–1968) and the Prime Minister of the [[Mali Federation]]. He espoused a form of [[African socialism]].

==Youth==
He was born in Bamako-Coura, a neighborhood of Bamako, which was at the time the capital of [[French Sudan]]. His family were Malian Muslims who claimed direct descent from the founders of the [[Mali Empire]]. He was educated in Bamako and at the [[École normale supérieure William Ponty|école normale William-Ponty]] in [[Dakar]], where he was top of his class. Beginning in 1936, he worked as a teacher in Bamako, [[Sikasso]] and [[Timbuktu|Tombouctou]].
His nickname after primary schooling was Modo.

==Entering politics==
Modibo Keïta was involved in various associations. In 1937, he was the coordinator of the art and theater group. Along with [[Daniel Ouezzin Coulibaly|Ouezzin Coulibaly]], he helped found the Union of French West African Teachers.

Keïta joined the [[Communist Study Groups]] (GEC) cell in Bamako.

In 1943, he founded the ''L'oeil de Kénédougou'', a magazine critical of colonial rule. This led to his imprisonment for three weeks in 1946 at the ''Prison de la Santé'' in Paris.

In 1945 Keïta was a candidate for the Constituent Assembly of the [[French Fourth Republic]], supported by GEC and the [[Sudanese Democratic Party]]. Later the same year, he and [[Mamadou Konaté]] founded the ''Bloc soudanais'', which developed into the [[Sudanese Union]].

==Political life==
In October 1946, the [[African Democratic Rally]] (RDA)  was created at a conference in Bamako of delegates from across French Africa. While the coalition was led by [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]], Keïta assumed the post of RDA Secretary-General in [[French Sudan]], and head of the Soudanese affiliate: the [[US-RDA]]. In 1948, he was elected general councilor of French Sudan. In 1956, he was elected mayor of Bamako and became a member of the [[National Assembly of France]]. He twice served as secretary of state in the governments of [[Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury]] and [[Félix Gaillard]]. Modibo Keïta was elected constituent assembly president of the Mali Federation on July 20, 1960, which consisted of French Sudan and Senegal. Senegal would later leave the federation.

==President of Mali==
{{one source|section|date=January 2017}}
[[File:Keita 001.jpg|thumb|1960s commemorative wraps with Keïta's portrait]]
After the collapse of the federation, the US-RDA proclaimed the Soudanese Republic's complete independence as the Republic of Mali. Keïta became its first president, and soon afterward declared the US-RDA to be the only legal party.

As a socialist, he led his country towards the progressive socialization of the economy; at first starting with agriculture and trade, then on October 1960 creating the SOMIEX (Malian Import and Export Company), which had a monopoly over the exports of the products of Mali, as well as manufactured and food imports (e.g. [[sugar]], [[tea]], [[powdered milk]]) and their distribution inside the country. The establishment of the Malian franc in 1962, and the difficulties of provisioning, resulted in a severe inflation and dissatisfaction of the population, particularly the peasants and the businessmen.

In June 1961, he paid a state visit to the United Kingdom, where Queen [[Elizabeth II]] invested him as an honorary Knight Grand Cross of the [[Order of Saint Michael and Saint George]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', June 8, 1961, p. 16; Issue 55102; col. B&lt;/ref&gt; Although Keïta was initially viewed with some wariness by the United States because of his socialist views, he made it clear that he sought good relations with Washington. In September 1961, he travelled to America in the company of [[Sukarno]] and met with President [[John F. Kennedy]]. Keïta, afterward, felt that he had a friend in Kennedy.
[[File:JFKWHP-KN-C18793 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Modibo Keïta meeting with President Kennedy at the [[White House]] in 1961]]
On the political level, Modibo Keïta quickly imprisoned opponents like [[Fily Dabo Sissoko]]. The first post-independence elections, in [[Malian parliamentary election, 1964|1964]], saw a single list of 80 US-RDA candidates returned to the National Assembly, and Keïta was duly reelected to another term as president by the legislature.  From 1967, he started the "revolution active" and suspended the constitution by creating the [[National Committee for the Defense of the Revolution]] (CNDR). The exactions of the "milice populaire" (the US-RDA militia) and the devaluation of the Malian franc in 1967 brought general unrest.

On November 19, 1968, General [[Moussa Traoré]] overthrew Modibo Keïta in a coup d'état, and sent him to prison in the northern Malian town of [[Kidal]].

After being transferred back to the capital Bamako in February 1977 in what was claimed to be an action by the government towards national reconciliation in preparation for his release,&lt;ref&gt;P. J. Imperato, ''Mali: a search for direction'', p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Modibo Keïta died, still a prisoner, on May 16, 1977.&lt;ref&gt;P. Diarra, ''Cent ans de catholicisme au Mali'', p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; His reputation was rehabilitated in 1992 following the overthrow of Moussa Traoré and subsequent elections of president [[Alpha Oumar Konaré]]. A monument to Modibo Keïta was dedicated in Bamako on June 6, 1999.

==As a Pan-Africanist==
[[File:Keita and Nasser, 1966.jpg|thumb|right|Keita and Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] (right) in [[Addis Ababa]] for the [[Organisation of African Unity]] conference, November 1966]]

Modibo Keïta devoted his entire life to African unity. He first played a part in the creation of the [[Federation of Mali]] with [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]]. After its collapse, he moved away from Léopold Sédar Senghor, but with [[Sékou Touré]], the president of Guinea, and [[Kwame Nkrumah]], the President of Ghana, he formed the [[Union of the States of Western Africa]]. In 1963, he played an important role in drafting the charter of the [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU).

In 1963, he invited the king of Morocco and the president of Algeria to Bamako, in the hope of ending the [[Sand War]], a frontier conflict between the two nations.  Along with [[Emperor Haile Selassie]] of Ethiopia, Keïta was successful in negotiating the [[Bamako Accords]], which brought an end to the conflict.  As a result, he won the [[Lenin Peace Prize]] that year.

From 1963 to 1966, he normalized relations with the countries of Senegal, Upper Volta and Côte d'Ivoire. An advocate of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], Modibo defended the nationalist movements like the Algerian [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN).

==In literature==
Malian author [[Massa Makan Diabaté]] satirizes Keïta's presidency in his novel ''[[Le boucher de Kouta|The Butcher of Kouta]]'', which features a socialist, dictatorial president named "Bagabaga Daba" (literally, "ant with a big mouth"), who is later removed by a military coup.&lt;ref&gt;Sangare, Mamadou. ''L'histoire et le roman dans la trilogie Kouta de Massa Makan Diabate.'' Paris: Septentrion, 1999. p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20341">[[Daniel Dennett]]'s '''multiple drafts model of consciousness''' is a [[physicalism|physicalist]] theory of [[consciousness]] based upon [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]], which views the [[mind]] in terms of [[information processing]]. The theory is described in depth in his book, ''[[Consciousness Explained]]'', published in 1991. As the title states, the book proposes a high-level explanation of consciousness which is consistent with support for the possibility of [[Artificial general intelligence|strong AI.]]

Dennett describes the theory as ''first-person [[operationalism]]''. As he states it:
{{quote|The Multiple Drafts model makes [the procedure of] "writing it down" in memory criterial for consciousness: that is ''what it is'' for the "given" to be "taken" ... There is no reality of conscious experience independent of the effects of various vehicles of content on subsequent action (and hence, of course, on memory).&lt;ref name="dennett1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, Daniel, C. |title=Consciousness Explained |year=1991 |publisher=Little, Brown &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The thesis of multiple drafts==
Dennett's thesis is that our modern understanding of consciousness is unduly influenced by the ideas of [[René Descartes]]. To show why, he starts with a description of the [[color phi phenomenon|phi illusion]]. In this experiment, two different coloured lights, with an angular separation of a few degrees at the eye, are flashed in succession. If the interval between the flashes is less than a second or so, the first light that is flashed appears to move across to the position of the second light. Furthermore, the light seems to change colour as it moves across the visual field. A green light will appear to turn red as it seems to move across to the position of a red light. Dennett asks how we could see the light change colour ''before'' the second light is observed.

Dennett claims that conventional explanations of the colour change boil down to either ''Orwellian'' or ''Stalinesque'' hypotheses, which he says are the result of Descartes' continued influence on our vision of the mind. In an Orwellian hypothesis, the subject comes to one conclusion, then goes back and changes that memory in light of subsequent events. This is akin to George Orwell's ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', where records of the past are routinely altered. In a Stalinesque hypothesis, the two events would be reconciled prior to entering the subject's consciousness, with the final result presented as fully resolved. This is akin to [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[show trial]]s, where the verdict has been decided in advance and the trial is just a rote presentation.
{{quote|[W]e can suppose, both theorists have ''exactly'' the same theory of what happens in your brain; they agree about just where and when in the brain the mistaken content enters the causal pathways; they just disagree about whether that location is to be deemed pre-experiential or post-experiential. ... [T]hey even agree about how it ought to "feel" to subjects: Subjects should be unable to tell the difference between misbegotten experiences and immediately misremembered experiences. [p. 125, original emphasis.]}}

Dennett argues that there is no principled basis for picking one of these theories over the other, because they share a common error in supposing that there is a special time and place where unconscious processing becomes consciously experienced, entering into what Dennett calls the "[[Cartesian theatre]]". Both theories require us to cleanly divide a sequence of perceptions and reactions into before and after the instant that they reach the seat of consciousness, but he denies that there is any such moment, as it would lead to infinite regress. Instead, he asserts that there is no privileged place in the brain where consciousness happens. Dennett states that, "[t]here does not exist ... a process such as 'recruitment of consciousness' (into what?), nor any place where the 'vehicle's arrival' is recognized (by whom?)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/multdrft.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051121095257/http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/multdrft.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=21 November 2005|title=Multiple Drafts...|date=21 November 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[[Cartesian materialism]] is the view that there is a crucial finish line or boundary somewhere in the brain, marking a place where the order of arrival equals the order of "presentation" in experience because ''what happens there'' is what you are conscious of. ... Many theorists would insist that they have explicitly rejected such an obviously bad idea. But ... the persuasive imagery of the Cartesian Theater keeps coming back to haunt us—laypeople and scientists alike—even after its ghostly dualism has been denounced and exorcized. [p. 107, original emphasis.]}}

With no theatre, there is no screen, hence no reason to re-present data after it has already been analysed. Dennett says that, "the Multiple Drafts model goes on to claim that the brain does not bother 'constructing' any representations that go to the trouble of 'filling in' the blanks. That would be a waste of time and (shall we say?) paint. The judgement is already in so we can get on with other tasks!"

According to the model, there are a variety of sensory inputs from a given event and also a variety of interpretations of these inputs. The sensory inputs arrive in the brain and are interpreted at different times, so a given event can give rise to a succession of discriminations, constituting the equivalent of multiple drafts of a story. As soon as each discrimination is accomplished, it becomes available for eliciting a behaviour; it does not have to wait to be presented at the theatre.

Like a number of other theories, the Multiple Drafts model understands conscious experience as taking time to occur, such that percepts do not instantaneously arise in the mind in their full richness. The distinction is that Dennett's theory denies any clear and unambiguous boundary separating conscious experiences from all other processing. According to Dennett, consciousness is to be found in the actions and flows of information from place to place, rather than some singular view containing our experience. There is no central experiencer who confers a durable stamp of approval on any particular draft.

Different parts of the neural processing assert more or less control at different times. For something to reach consciousness is akin to becoming famous, in that it must leave behind consequences by which it is remembered. To put it another way, consciousness is the property of having enough influence to affect what the mouth will say and the hands will do. Which inputs are "edited" into our drafts is not an exogenous act of supervision, but part of the self-organizing functioning of the network, and at the same level as the circuitry that conveys information bottom-up.

The conscious self is taken to exist as an abstraction visible at the level of the [[intentional stance]], akin to a body of mass having a "centre of gravity". Analogously, Dennett refers to the self as the "centre of narrative gravity", a story we tell ourselves about our experiences. Consciousness exists, but not independently of behaviour and behavioural disposition, which can be studied through [[heterophenomenology]].

The origin of this operationalist approach can be found in Dennett's immediately preceding work. Dennett (1988) explains consciousness in terms of ''access consciousness'' alone, denying the independent existence of what [[Ned Block]] has labeled ''phenomenal consciousness''.&lt;ref name="block1"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Block, N. |title=On a confusion about a function of consciousness |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=18 |pages=227–287 |doi=10.1017/s0140525x00038188}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that "Everything real has properties, and since I don't deny the reality of conscious experience, I grant that conscious experience has properties". Having related all consciousness to properties, he concludes that they cannot be meaningfully distinguished from our judgements about them. He writes: 
{{quote|The [[infallibilist]] line on [[qualia]] treats them as properties of one's experience one cannot in principle misdiscover, and this is a mysterious doctrine (at least as mysterious as papal infallibility) unless we shift the emphasis a little and treat qualia as logical constructs out of subjects' qualia-judgments: a subject's experience has the quale F if and only if the subject judges his experience to have quale F. We can then treat such judgings as constitutive acts, in effect, bringing the quale into existence by the same sort of license as novelists have to determine the hair color of their characters by fiat. We do not ask how Dostoevski knows that Raskolnikov's hair is light brown.&lt;ref name="dennett2"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, Daniel C. |title=Quining Qualia |year=1988 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In other words, once we've explained a perception fully in terms of how it affects us, there is nothing left to explain. In particular, there is no such thing as a perception which may be considered in and of itself (a [[quale]]). Instead, the subject's honest reports of how things seem to them are inherently authoritative on how things seem to them, but not on the matter of how things actually are.
{{quote|So when we look one last time at our original characterization of qualia, as ineffable, intrinsic, private, directly apprehensible properties of experience, we find that there is nothing to fill the bill. In their place are relatively or practically ineffable public properties we can refer to indirectly via reference to our private property-detectors—private only in the sense of idiosyncratic. And insofar as we wish to cling to our subjective authority about the occurrence within us of states of certain types or with certain properties, we can have some authority—not infallibility or incorrigibility, but something better than sheer guessing—but only if we restrict ourselves to relational, extrinsic properties like the power of certain internal states of ours to provoke acts of apparent re-identification. So contrary to what seems obvious at first blush, there simply are no qualia at all.&lt;ref name="dennett2"/&gt;}}

The key to the multiple drafts model is that, after removing qualia, explaining consciousness boils down to explaining the behaviour we recognise as conscious. Consciousness is as consciousness does.

==Critical responses==
Some of the criticism of Dennett's theory is due to the perceived tone of his presentation. As one grudging supporter admits, "there is much in this book that is disputable. And Dennett is at times aggravatingly smug and confident about the merits of his arguments ... All in all Dennett's book is annoying, frustrating, insightful, provocative and above all annoying" (Korb 1993).

Bogen (1992) points out that the brain is bilaterally symmetrical. That being the case, if Cartesian materialism is true, there might be ''two'' Cartesian theatres, so arguments against only one are flawed.&lt;ref name="bogen"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bogen, J.E. |title=Descartes' fundamental mistake: Introspective singularity |year=1992 |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |issue=15 |pages=184–247 | doi = 10.1017/s0140525x00033914 |volume=17}} Commentary on Daniel C. Dennett and Marcel Kinsbourne (1992) ''Time and the observer: The where and when of consciousness in the brain.''&lt;/ref&gt; Velmans (1992) argues that the phi effect and the [[cutaneous rabbit illusion]] demonstrate that there is a delay whilst modelling occurs and that this delay was discovered by Libet.&lt;ref name="vel"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Velmans, M. |title=Is Consciousness Integrated? |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=15 |pages=229–230 |doi=10.1017/s0140525x00068473}}(commentary on Dennett &amp; Kinsbourne "Time and the observer", BBS, 1992, 15(2): 183–201) Copyright Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been claimed that the argument in the multiple drafts model does not support its conclusion.&lt;ref name="bring"&gt;{{cite web |author=Bringsjord, S. |url=http://citeseer.ifi.unizh.ch/bringsjord96explaining.html |title=Explaining Phi Without Dennett's Exotica: Good Ol' Computation Suffices |&lt;!-- accessdate=1996 --&gt;}} {{dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Straw man"===
Much of the criticism asserts that Dennett's theory attacks the wrong target, failing to explain what it claims to. Chalmers (1996) maintains that Dennett has produced no more than a theory of how subjects report events.&lt;ref name="chalmers"&gt;{{cite book |author=Chalmers, David |title=The Conscious Mind |year=1992 |publisher=Oxford University Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some even parody the title of the book as "Consciousness Explained Away", accusing him of [[greedy reductionism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3005001 BBC.co.uk] – Some Modern Theories of Consciousness&lt;/ref&gt; Another line of criticism disputes the accuracy of Dennett's characterisations of existing theories:
{{quote|The now standard response to Dennett's project is that he has picked a fight with a [[straw man]]. Cartesian materialism, it is alleged, is an impossibly naive account of phenomenal consciousness held by no one currently working in cognitive science or the philosophy of mind. Consequently, whatever the effectiveness of Dennett's demolition job, it is fundamentally misdirected (see, e.g., Block, 1993, 1995; Shoemaker, 1993; and Tye, 1993).&lt;ref name="bando"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=O'Brien, G.  |author2=Opie, J.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=A defense of Cartesian Materialism |journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research |volume=59 |pages= 939–63 |doi=10.2307/2653563}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Unoriginality===
Multiple drafts is also attacked for making a claim to novelty. It may be the case, however, that such attacks mistake which features Dennett is claiming as novel. Korb states that, "I believe that the central thesis will be relatively uncontentious for most cognitive scientists, but that its use as a cleaning solvent for messy puzzles will be viewed less happily in most quarters." (Korb 1993) In this way, Dennett uses uncontroversial ideas towards more controversial ends, leaving him open to claims of unoriginality when uncontroversial parts are focused upon.

Even the notion of consciousness as drafts is not unique to Dennett. According to Hankins, Dieter Teichert suggests that [[Paul Ricoeur]]'s theories agree with Dennett's on the notion that "the self is basically a narrative entity, and that any attempt to give it a free-floating independent status is misguided." [Hankins] Others see [[Derrida]]'s (1982) representationalism as consistent with the notion of a mind that has perceptually changing content without a definitive present instant.&lt;ref name="derrida"&gt;{{cite book |author=Derrida, J. |title=Margins of Philosophy |publisher=The University of Chicago Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To those who believe that consciousness entails something more than behaving in all ways conscious, Dennett's view is seen as [[eliminativism|eliminativist]], since it denies the existence of [[qualia]] and the possibility of [[philosophical zombie]]s. However, Dennett is not denying the existence of the mind or of consciousness, only what he considers a naive view of them. The point of contention is whether Dennett's own definitions are indeed more accurate: whether what we think of when we speak of perceptions and consciousness can be understood in terms of nothing more than their effect on behaviour.

===Information processing and consciousness===
The role of information processing in consciousness has been criticised by [[John Searle]] who, in his [[Chinese room]] argument,&lt;ref name="searle"&gt;Searle, J. (1980) "[https://web.archive.org/web/20070611104618/http://members.aol.com/NeoNoetics/MindsBrainsPrograms.html Minds, Brains and Programs]"&lt;/ref&gt; states that he cannot find anything that could be recognised as conscious experience in a system that relies solely on motions of things from place to place. Dennett sees this argument as misleading, arguing that consciousness is not to be found in a specific part of the system, but in the actions of the whole. In essence, he denies that consciousness requires something in addition to capacity for behaviour, saying that philosophers such as Searle, "just can't imagine how understanding could be a property that emerges from lots of distributed quasi-understanding in a large system" (p.&amp;nbsp;439).

== Life ==
The ancestor of two of the [[Five Houses of Chán|Five Houses]] of Ch'an, Huairang is traditionally said to have studied with a [[Vinaya]] master and became ordained. Dissatisfied with his own progress, Huairang found [[Dajian Huineng]] in [[Shaozhou]] and became his disciple, which is recorded in various traditional biographies. Huairang is traditionally said to have given Dharma transmission to six individuals, the most prominent being [[Mazu Daoyi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Faure| first =Bernard| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =The Rhetoric of Immediacy: A Cultural Critique of Chan/Zen Buddhism| publisher =Princeton University Press| year =1991| location =| pages =12| url =http://www.worldcat.org/search?qt=worldcat_org_all&amp;q=0691029636| doi =| id = | isbn = 0-691-02963-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on a critical reading of the textual evidence, the scholar John McRae notes that it is unlikely that Huairang actually practiced with Huineng. In the oldest version of the ''[[Platform Sutra]]'' found among the [[Dunhuang manuscripts]], which dates to about 850 CE, Nanyue is not listed as a student of Huineng at all. Although Huairang is mentioned in 952 CE in the ''[[Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall]]'', he is not discussed in the context of Huineng. The same source records a putative coversation between him and Mazu, but there is no explicit suggestion that Mazu is his student. An even earlier source, the ''Transmissions of the Treasure Grove'' of 801, states that Huairang was enlightened under Lao'an, a teacher with connections to [[Shenxiu]] of the so-called Northern School.&lt;ref name=McRae&gt;{{citation|last=McRae|first=John|title=Seeing Through Zen|year=2003|publisher=University of California Press||page=80-82|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles, London|isbn=978-0-520-23798-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several authors have used the terms '''organ gifting''' and "tissue gifting" to describe processes behind organ and tissue transfers that are not captured by more traditional terms such as [[Organ donation|donation]] and [[Organ transplant|transplantation]].  The concept of "gift of life" in the U.S. refers to the fact that "transplantable organs must be given willingly, unselfishly, and anonymously, and any money that is exchanged is to be perceived as solely for operational costs, but never for the organs themselves".&lt;ref&gt;Sharp (2001:116)&lt;/ref&gt; "Organ gifting" is proposed to contrast with organ [[commodification]]. The maintenance of a spirit of altruism in this context has been interpreted by some as a mechanism through which the economic relations behind organ/tissue production, distribution, and consumption can be disguised.&lt;ref name=Scheper&gt;Scheper-Hughes (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  Organ/tissue gifting differs from commodification in the sense that anonymity and social trust are emphasized to reduce the offer and request of monetary compensation.&lt;ref name=Sharp&gt;Sharp (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tober&gt;Tober (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;  It is reasoned that the implementation of the gift-giving analogy to organ transactions shows greater respect for the diseased body, honors the donor, and transforms the transaction into a morally acceptable and desirable act that is borne out of [[Voluntarism (action)|voluntarism]] and [[altruism]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerrand (1994:49)&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The concept of gifting with regards to body parts or fluids was first analyzed by [[Richard Titmuss]] in his book titled ''The Gift Relationship: from Human Blood to Social Policy''. Here the author highlights the negative effects of compensating blood donors and the benefits of maintaining a system where the donation of body tissues and fluids is seen in the form of a gift that is voluntarily and altruistically given to society.&lt;ref&gt;Titmuss (1971)&lt;/ref&gt; Titmuss (1971) draws from Mauss's (1950) publication, ''[[The Gift (book)|The Gift: The Form and Reason for Exchange in Archaic Societies]]'', to argue that when blood is given in the form of a gift, collective social relations are formed to maintain a sense of community.&lt;ref&gt;see also Waldby and Mitchell (2006:10-18)&lt;/ref&gt;  Titmuss follows Mauss' (1950) ideas of gift giving as a system of total services (production, distribution, and consumption) where self-interest interacts with social and moral obligations that are collectively imposed to maintain social relationships and guarantee the reproduction of society.&lt;ref&gt;see also Randhawa (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Titmuss' work was very influential at a policy level. It motivated the [[Nixon administration]] in the U.S. to reform its system of blood donation and led many people in the U.K. to oppose models of marketable blood donation systems.&lt;ref&gt;Waldby and Mitchell (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has been incorporated into the phrase "the gift of life" which was used to refer to multiple forms of organ, blood, tissue, semen, and cell line donations. The concept of gift is widely used in policies (such as the [[Uniform Anatomical Gift Act]]) regarding organ transplantation and the use of cadavers for medical studies.

Researchers from various disciplines have analyzed and critiqued the idea of organ gifting and this belief that gifting and organ commodification are mutually exclusive.&lt;ref name=Scheper /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cherry&gt;Cherry (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Waldby and Mitchell, in their book ''Tissue Economies: Blood, Organs, and Cell Lines in Late Capitalism'', have indicated that "we hope to complicate and disorganize the gift-commodity dichotomy, because we consider it an inadequate way to conceptualize the political economy of tissues in the modern world of globalized biotechnology".&lt;ref&gt;Waldby and Mitchell (2006:9)&lt;/ref&gt;  Objects and their exchange serve multiple purposes and result in alternative values depending on the context.&lt;ref name="Wilk and Cligget 2007"&gt;Wilk and Cligget (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other individuals have questioned the assumptions that link systems of organ gifting with the equitable distribution of human organs arguing that the voluntary and altruistic donation of organs does not necessarily imply the free transplantation of that organ.&lt;ref name=Cherry /&gt; In other words, under current systems of healthcare in the U.S., not only are organ donations managed by private organizations such as the [[United Network for Organ Sharing]] (UNOS), but organ transplantation is provided only to those who can afford it and in rare cases to those who desperately need it.&lt;ref name=Cherry /&gt;

== Alienable/Inalienable possessions ==

Throughout history, human organs have acquired different characteristics, acting as both alienable and [[inalienable possessions]] depending on the temporal and spatial context.&lt;ref name=Lock&gt;Lock (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Alienable possessions are objects that can be bought and sold, while inalienable possessions are things that must be kept due to their relationships with an individual's identity and origins.&lt;ref&gt;Godelier (1999:33)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weiner (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; During the 17th century, human organs were represented as inalienable possessions, that is, objects that could not be given away in exchange and their use by the medical profession was associated with violent actions.&lt;ref&gt;Lock (2002:66)&lt;/ref&gt; However, once the medical value of bodies was recognized, there was an increase in its commodification which was not legally acknowledged until the [[Anatomy Act]], which prohibited the selling of bodies, was signed in 1832.&lt;ref name=Lock2&gt;Lock (2002:67)&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, consensus over the sale of bodies and body parts had not been reached, and as Locke as argued, "competition over corpses and body parts existed because ideas about their value and beliefs about their alienability varied among contenders".&lt;ref name=Lock2 /&gt; Currently, different representations of organs and other body parts coexist blurring the lines between alienability and inalienability.

== Reciprocity ==

[[Marcel Mauss]] is recognized as one of the first authors interested in the study of [[gift economies]].&lt;ref name="Wilk and Cligget 2007"/&gt; His main concern centered on individuals' need to provide gifts and the obligations to reciprocate them. He identified human obligation to give, receive, and reciprocate as the most important factor in the creation and maintenance of social ties. Reciprocation was mainly produced by the insertion of the giver's identity in the object that was given. The object maintained this essence (referred to as ''hau'' or ''[[mana]]'' by Mauss) of the giver which needed to return to him/her through reciprocation in the form of a counter-gift (another object, services, person, agreements, etc.).

Organ gifting entails two simultaneous gifts: the gift of the organ itself and the gift of life.&lt;ref name=Sharp /&gt; The first form of gift is a transaction where the giver provides an object to the receiver.  This action leads to the creation of a relationship among individuals where the receiver is compelled to provide a counter-gift.&lt;ref name="Tober"/&gt; The obligation to return the gift has received various interpretations, but one common assumption is that the object that is given tends to keep a portion of the identity of the giver (hau used by Mauss).&lt;ref name=Lock /&gt; In the case of organ gifting, this personalization of the gifted object reaches extreme proportions because the gift is actually a piece of the giver's body.&lt;ref name=Lock /&gt;

[[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|Reciprocity]] tends to be discouraged in contemporary organ gifting, thus creating an irresoluble sense of debt in the receiver. This separation of the donor from the object being given was not always implemented, and in earlier cases of organ transplantation the receiver could obtain information from the donor and even meet.&lt;ref name=Holtkamp&gt;Holtkamp (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; As Holtkamp (2002) has argued, this arrangement created a feeling of debt in the receiver (and close kin) and led to the creation of obligations. The discouragement of reciprocal relationships between giver and receiver is produced through what Sharp (2001) has labeled etiquettes of dehumanization where the identities of the donors are removed from the organs.

Organs, then, become unreciprocated gifts. According to Mauss, the unreciprocated gift makes the person who has accepted it inferior, especially when its acceptance is done without the thought of returning it.&lt;ref name=Mauss&gt;Mauss (1950:65)&lt;/ref&gt; In Mauss' words, "Charity is still wounding for him who has accepted it, and the whole tendency of our morality is to strive to do away with the unconscious and injurious patronage of the rich almsgiver".&lt;ref name=Mauss /&gt;

The prohibition, or in some cases delay, of the giver/receiver interaction creates a myriad of situations. The dehumanization of organs and the removal of all possible donor characteristics do not prevent receivers from imagining the lives of the individuals who provided the organs.&lt;ref name=Tober /&gt;&lt;ref name=Holtkamp /&gt; Studies have shed light on cases where organ receivers feel the essence of the organ donors inside them after transplantation.&lt;ref name=Holtkamp /&gt; The close kin of donors who have died also maintain the idea that the person in their family who has died continues to live in the body of someone else.

Organ gifting entails not only the gifting of the organ itself, but also the "gift of life".&lt;ref name=Sharp /&gt;  In this case, the organ not only represents the transference of an object from one person to the other as it was mentioned earlier, but the possession of this object in turn allows the receiver to obtain a second "gift", the opportunity to live. The obligation to reciprocate is still present in this form of gifting, but the possibility of providing a counter-gift of equal or greater value is practically impossible. The use of the metaphor "gift of life" transforms the nature of the object into a mystical one as the implication is that life emanates from a supernatural source.&lt;ref&gt;Fox and Swazey (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; This is further exacerbated by the use of this same metaphor to express religious beliefs like rebirth and reincarnation.

== Value ==

Discussions over value are common in studies on organ gifting. As Lock has indicated, the main reason for this is that "human body parts do not have universal value, and once, potentially available for conversion into circulating commodities, their worth, and more basically the question of whether or not they are alienable, is open to dispute".&lt;ref&gt;Lock (2002:65)&lt;/ref&gt; An important factor to consider is the fact that organ gifting differs from the gifting of blood or semen in the sense that organs are scarce. It is this scarcity which creates stronger relationships between the giver and the receiver because it endows the object that is being transferred with greater value. As [[Appadurai]] (1986) has indicated, the link between exchange and value is created by politics, thus making value an issue of judgment. In the case of organ exchange, when the demand, whether real or fictitious, exceeds the supply, the object is endowed with greater value. In other words, objects can be controlled to create value.&lt;ref&gt;Appadurai (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; Several authors have examined the issue of organ scarcity pointing to the different ways in which it is publicly exacerbated for profit-driven interests.&lt;ref name=Scheper /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor that can increase the value of the object, are the characteristics of the object itself. As [[Marshall Sahlins|Sahlins]] (1972) has indicated, the material exchanged influences the relationship of exchange. Spielman (2002) has discussed four main qualities of social valuables that also allude to the different ways in which the object exchanged can determine the relationship maintained between the giver and receiver:
1.	Social valuables must have unique properties that distinguish their production
2.	Distance, in terms of obtaining the materials necessary for production, plays a role in the establishment of value
3.	The transformative aspects of production and the role of craftspeople need to be considered in the creation of value
4.	Value is also influenced by the modifications the good suffers as it circulates.

This last point has been examined by Appadurai through his concept of the social lives of objects where objects are seen as circulating in different regimes of value in space and time.&lt;ref&gt;Appadurai (1986: 4)&lt;/ref&gt; As Appadurai has indicated, "commodity is not one kind of thing rather than another, but one phase in the life of some things".&lt;ref&gt;Appadurai (1986:17)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of organ gifting, it is possible to see the biographical transformations of objects in clearer form as the object in question comes from a person and becomes part of another person.&lt;ref&gt;Tober (2001:142)&lt;/ref&gt; Organs can be both gifts and commodities depending on the context in question.&lt;ref&gt;Wadby and Mitchell (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The value of the object responds to the social relationships and contracts present in this context. This is the reason why not all organ gifting is visualized in the same form and individuals make distinctions between cadaveric donations, kin donations, and anonymous donations.

Furthermore, organ gifting raises additional concerns regarding the biographies of objects because the object that is given is actually a part of another person.&lt;ref name=Lock /&gt;  The interest over the life of the object includes an interest over the life of the individual who provided it as well. This has been documented by researchers examining the processes through which organ procurers select donors.&lt;ref name=Sharp /&gt; As Sharp has indicated, "through organ procurement, human bodies are commodified and codified following a relatively strict hierarchy of medical value and social worth".&lt;ref&gt;Sharp(2001:118)&lt;/ref&gt; Age, race and ethnicity all play a role in the identification of ideal candidates. Organ receivers are also interested in obtaining information about donors. As Lock has mentioned, "organ recipients worry about the gender, ethnicity, skin color, personality and social status of their donors, and many believe that their mode of being-in-the-world is radically changed after a transplant, thanks to the power of diffusing form the organ they have received".&lt;ref&gt;Lock (2002: 72)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Altruism ==

[[Altruism]] is constantly referenced by proponents of organ gifting.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Authors such as Sahlins (1972), incorporated Maussian concepts of gifting and reciprocity and expanded them to describe three different types of transactions: generalized reciprocity (system of giving without taking account of how much is given), balanced reciprocity (direct exchange, expectation of equal value), and negative reciprocity (obtaining something for nothing). Individuals engage in each one of these transaction depending on the person they are exchanging with and the social distance involved. Sahlins' (1972) work has pointed to the need to examine the different types of relationships behind gift-giving and the characteristics of the transaction. In the case of generalized reciprocity, altruistic relationships are present and the expectation of reciprocity is indefinite.&lt;ref&gt;Sahlins (1972:194)&lt;/ref&gt;

The value of the object can be increased by the way in which it is given and several authors have pointed to the fact that organs given in altruistic manner acquire greater social worth.&lt;ref&gt;Tober (2001:155)&lt;/ref&gt; Organs given in altruistic manner are thought to say something about the moral character of the people who give them. Furthermore, the giving of organs without any form of compensation erases the possibility that the giver will have any form of vested interest in the transaction.&lt;ref name=Cherry /&gt;

Munson has presented a list of the common claims made by individuals arguing against the selling of kidneys: "a paid donor loses the psychological benefits that reward a voluntary donor; the practice reduces altruism in the society; the quality of donated kidneys will decline; the donor may suffer harm and become a burden to society; selling a kidney involves putting a price on the priceless; organ selling treats the human body as a commodity and thus reduces our respect for people".&lt;ref&gt;Munson (2002:112)&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the commodification of organ donations could lead the organ donors to lie on issues pertaining to their health in order to obtain money in exchange for their organs, thus making the quality of the organ questionable.&lt;ref name=Tober /&gt; A direct relationship between commodification and quality is thus created where the social trust present in altruistic relationships is missing. Goodwin has argued that this distinction between commodification and altruism is based on a common assumption socially maintained regarding altruism where it is thought as "pure and unspoiled by secondary or spurious motivations".&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (2006:59)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anonymity ==

[[Anonymity]] is an important component of organ gifting and it is thought to foster the social well-being of donors, recipients, and close kin.&lt;ref name=Sharp2&gt;Sharp (2001:115)&lt;/ref&gt; Anonymity is related to the eradication of reciprocal relations between giver and receiver where the origin of the object that is exchanged is erased by eliminating the identity of the giver. According to some authors, this is currently done to promote better coping mechanisms for the recipient and close kin as well as to maintain standardized operating procedures by organ procurers.  The idea is that anonymity will protect organ procurers "from close encounters with the animistic, magic-infused thinking about transplanted organs in which the givers and receivers of cadaver organs often engage".&lt;ref&gt;Fox and Swazey (1992:43)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, other authors have argued that the use of the gift-giving metaphor in conjunction with the enforcement of anonymous donations lead to the obscuring of the origins of body parts and the unequal power relations behind their donation and reception.&lt;ref name=Scheper /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sharp2 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4054">'''Pamfil Danilovich Yurkevich''' ({{lang-uk|Памфі́л Дани́лович Юрке́вич}}; {{lang-ru|Памфи́л Дани́лович Юрке́вич}}; February 28, 1826, [[Poltava]] – October 16, 1874, [[Moscow]]) was a  Ukrainian [[idealist]] philosopher and teacher.

Yurkevich in 1851-1861 was a professor of Philosophy at the [[Kiev Theological Academy]], also taught at the Academy of the German language, was an assistant inspector of the Academy. In 1861, he was transferred from Kyiv to Moscow and was appointed a professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Moscow]] though his training previous to this position was mostly from Orthodox theological schools. Specifically the [[:ru:Полтавская славянская семинария|Poltava Seminary]] and the [[Kiev Theological Academy]]. Yurkevich was remembered for his critical stance against materialism in specific modern materialism. Yurkevich mentored [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Soloviev]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=THpyJ0jBeH0C&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35 The Teachings of Modern Orthodox Christianity on Law, Politics, and Human Nature]'' by John Witte Jr., Frank S. Alexander, Paul Valliere Columbia University Press August 7, 2007 {{ISBN|978-0231142649}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Yurkevich was in 1851, appointed the position of instructor in Philosophical Sciences at the [[Kiev Theological Academy]]. In 1852 he received his master's degree in philosophy (from 1861 - professor). Then in 1857 Yurkevich also began to teach German at the University. Based on the decision of the Ministry of Education in 1861 Yurkevich was transferred from Kiev to Moscow and received the rank of full Professor and was invited to the philosophy department at Moscow University. Yurkevich also taught [[pedagogy]] in the seminary for the Russian military. Through 1869—1873 Yurkevich was the Dean of History and Philology Faculty of the Moscow University .

==Views==
Yurkevich's more well known positions and the works that reflected them (The Heart and Its Significance in the Spiritual Life of Man) revolved around the expression and rationalization of [[essentialism]]. In this Yurkevich concerned himself with the philosophical clarification of what material and the observable world are. Though Yurkevich was an idealist in the sense of [[Platonic Realism]], he was thoroughly Christian in his approach rejecting that the mind of a person as reason was the basis for the essences of things or beings and instead saying that essentialism was idealist (from conscious beings inline with Plato) but it was from the rational part of the being (their mind) and also from the emotional center and that the heart of the person was the complete expression of the person. Person or soul (hypostasis) is heart, mind and body, as the rational part of a person was but a part of the larger whole which as a heart or soul each person gave meaning to the things they experienced. Yurkevich was continuing the work that had been set out before him by his famous mentor [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Soloviev]].
Idealist criticism Yurkevich work by Chernyshevsky, "The Anthropological Principle in Philosophy", marked the beginning of a stormy debate (statements by Chernyshevsky, M. A. Antonovich, etc.), which had wide public resonance. From the Marxist standpoint Yurkevich criticized [[Georgi Plekhanov|Plekhanov]]. Themes work Yurkevich largely determined responsive the subsequent development of philosophical idealism in Russia

{{Wiktionary|paramountcy}}
== Federalist law ==
The doctrine of '''paramountcy''' is the legal principle that reconciles contradicting or conflicting laws in a [[Federalism|federalist]] state, where both the central government, and the provincial or state governments, have the power to create laws in relation to the same matters. In a case where both central and state law exist, central laws will be given priority over state laws through the doctrine of [[Supremacy_Clause|supremacy]]. This is usually applied in cases of post-colonial [[indirect rule]].

== Historical systems ==
In feudalism, paramountcy is a matter of [[Suzerainty]], generally vested in a sovereign Monarch, as the summit of a vassallic pyramid of subject entities.
 
Thus the Mughal badshah (emperor) was the overlord, directly or indirectly, of many native [[princely states]] in pre-colonial India.

In the colonial age and system, paramountcy could similarly be vested in (the crown) of the colonizing imperial power, insofar as it practices [[indirect rule]] over native rulers, but could also be delegated to [[chartered company]].
 
Thus the [[British paramountcy]] in [[British India]] over its [[princely states]] (first by the chartered [[British East India Company]], later by the Colonial Office of the British imperial government) replaced or imitated the Mughal overlordship over a similar, growing list of native states, while some would be annexed. Similarly, the Dutch (first the [[VOIC]], later the government) assumed suzerain paramountcy over the native rulers in the [[Dutch East Indies]].

A '''pastoral practice''' refers to how an [[idea]] is applied or is used when giving [[Spirituality|spiritual]] care or guidance. That usually occurs in "pastoral ministry" and [[pastoral care]] when leading somebody closer to God either in spiritual formation, teaching, [[counseling]], or in [[liturgy]]. In liturgy, the pastoral practice can refer to an occasional event such as blessing fathers on Father's Day. It can also refer to an ongoing structure in the liturgy such as [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in the local language or turning the altar so that the [[officiant]] faces the congregation. In the second case, the practice would refer to a habitual or [[customary]] action or way of doing something.

The '''philosophy of business''' considers the fundamental principles that underlie the formation and operation of a [[business enterprise]]; the nature and purpose of a [[business]], and the [[moral obligation]]s that pertain to it.

== Influence ==

[[Philipp Blom]] summarises the development and impact of business-centric ideas in society prior to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008 | global financial crisis of 2008]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[...] [[Friedrich Hayek | Friedrich von Hayek]] and [[Ludwig von Mises]] [...] were Europeans who had passed their formative years in the chaotic interwar years and whose conclusion was that state intervention and planned economies were hallmarks of dictatorship [...]. They believed that it was healthier to take ideology out of politics and base the workings of society on the objective, nonideological laws of the free market. [...] The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] cult of reason and of the common good was replaced by the concepts of rationalization and the maximization of profits, which were applied to a reevaluation of social institutions - infrastructure, schools, universities, prisons, health care, and so on - according to business-driven criteria of profitability and cost-effectiveness. Especially in the United States but also increasingly in Europe, we began to run our societies as businesses. Beginning in the late 1970s and gaining speed in the 1980s, this gospel changed and polarized our societies - but it also provided an umbrella of meaning and necessity under which we could hide from challenges from without as well as doubts from within. For many in the West, the idea of the market became their ideological home. Living in accordance with its guiding providence and iron laws created a sense of stability, of virtue even. But 2008 shattered this collective piety and made millions understand that they had been lied to [...].&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="57852">The Svatantrika-Prasaṅgika distinction is a set of arguments about two different positions of [[sunyata|emptiness]] philosophy which are debated within the [[Mahayana]] school of [[Buddhism]]. It is most prominently discussed in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] where '''Prāsaṅgika''' and '''Svātantrika''', are viewed to be different forms of [[Madhyamaka|Madhyamaka philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Lama Tsongkhapa Pp 224-267"&gt;Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo V3 Pp 224-267&lt;/ref&gt;

For Tsongkhapa, the founder of the [[Gelugpa]] school and the most outspoken proponent of the distinction, as well as for the [[Karma Kagyu]] school, these differences are of major importance.{{refn|group=note|Lama Tsongkhapa dedicates three chapters to the subject in ''Lamrim Chenmo, V3''&lt;ref name="Lama Tsongkhapa Pp 224-267"&gt;Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo V3 Pp 224-267&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[Tsongkhapa]] not only negates an inherent identity or self-characterizing essence which resides in persons, things, and abstract phenomena; but he also negates the identity of phenomena as they appear to our instinctive, everyday perception.&lt;ref name="Lama Tsongkhapa Pp 224-267"&gt;Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo V3 Pp 224-267&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, according to Tsongkhapa, the Svātantrika negate a "truly existing self," but maintain that things exist conventionally "according to characteristics."&lt;ref name="Lama Tsongkhapa Pp 224-267"&gt;Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo V3 Pp 224-267&lt;/ref&gt;

==The heart of the distinction according to Tsongkhapa==

===Prāsaṅgika===
For Tsongkhapa, the Svatantrika-Prasaṅgika distinction centers around the role of ''prasaṅga'' (consequence) in a formal debate, and the interpretation of the meaning of both "ultimate truth" and "conventional truth." {{refn|"There is, however, another set of criteria for distinguishing between the approaches of these three Madhyamika masters, namely, their way of speaking about the conventional truth. We have seen that one of the reasons Chandrakirti objected to Bhavaviveka’s innovation was that, according to the rules of logic, independent syllogisms commit their user to an implicit and compromising acquiescence in the existence of the elements referred to. Bhavaviveka was apparently aware of this, and we have seen that, in the interests of consistency, his use of the independent syllogism went hand in hand with a view that, on the conventional level, phenomena do indeed enjoy a certain existence 'according to their characteristics.'"&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Middle Way, Section "Mipham Rinpoche and the Prasangika-Svatantrika Distinction"&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}

The Prāsaṅgika view holds [[reductio ad absurdum]] of essentialist viewpoints to be the most valid method of demonstrating [[Shunyata|emptiness of inherent existence]], and that conventional things do not have a naturally occurring conventional identity.&lt;ref name="Lama Tsongkhapa Pp 224-267"&gt;Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo V3 Pp 224-267&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the Prāsaṅgika argue that when initially attempting to find the correct object of understanding - which is a mere absence or mere negation of impossible modes of existence - one should not use positivist statements about the nature of reality. Positing an essencelessness rather than merely negating inherent identity creates a subtle linguistic and analytic barrier to finding the correct understanding.&lt;ref name="H.H. The Dalai Lama pg. 235"&gt;H.H. The Dalai Lama &amp; Alexander Berzin, ''The Gelug/Kagyu Tradition of Mahamudra'', pg. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Middle Way pg. 208-210"&gt;''Introduction to the Middle Way: Chandrakirti's Madhyamakavatara with Commentary by Ju Mipham'', pg. 208-210.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|"Therefore, someone might think that while the object of negation is merely negated, it is not tenable that its negation is the conclusion of the argument. But 'Prajnapradipa' quotes these lines in support of the claim, 'This is a mere negation of inherent existence; however, entitylessness is not asserted,' and the subcommentary also explains that it supports the claim that this is [a non-affirming] negation."&lt;ref&gt;Lama Tsongkhapa, ''Ocean of Reasoning'', pg. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}{{refn|group=note|The Nyingmapa scholar [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Jamgon Mipham]] (1846–1912) states, in ''Introduction to the Middle Way'', a commentary on Chandrakirti: "[Our opponents] say that the pot is empty of something different from the pot itself (that is, true existence) [...] The conclusion at which they arrive [is] that a man is not empty of himself but of a true existence extraneous to him [...] Chandrakirti said that the Svatantrikas were content with tenets that were only verbally coherent [...] Our opponents say that the personal and phenomenal selves are not empty of themselves but rather they are empty of true existence [...] The cognition 'This is a pot' is the apprehension of the reality of the pot. Simply apprehending something as existing as such, the personal and phenomenal selves are conceived. This mere thought therefore is enough to trigger the arising of defilements, for karma to be accumulated, and for suffering to be experienced. Therefore, if this thought is not removed, what advantage is there to refuting a truly existent self [...]?" &lt;ref name="Middle Way pg. 208-210"&gt;''Introduction to the Middle Way: Chandrakirti's Madhyamakavatara with Commentary by Ju Mipham'', pg. 208-210.&lt;/ref&gt;}} This is exemplified in the debate over the use of the terms "devoid of nature itself" in [[Mahamudra|Gelug Mahamudra]] (non-affirming negation) and "that which has voidness as its nature" in non-Gelug Mahamudra and [[Dzogchen]] (an affirming negation).&lt;ref name="H.H. The Dalai Lama pg. 235"/&gt;

Tsongkhapa argued that because the Svatantrika conventionally establish things by their own characteristics, they do not arrive at a complete understanding of emptiness. According to Tsongkhapa, not only were their methods different, but also that students using Svatantrika do not achieve the same realization as those using the Prasangika approach.{{sfn|Shantarakshita|Ju Mipham|2005|p=21-24}} Lama Tsongkhapa states that when he uses the term "advocates of intrinsic existence" he is referring to both "essentialists and the Svatantrikas."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lamrim Chenmo|last=Tsongkhapa|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars like the 14th Dalai Lama disagree, echoing sentiments from classical authorities like [[Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen, 4th Panchen Lama|Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen (4th Panchen Lama)]] stating that the credible teachers of the various systems of Buddhist philosophy all "arrive at the same intended point" of realization.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Gelug/Kagyu Tradition of Mahamudra|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they openly admit that this non-denominational position is very difficult to establish through reason.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Prāsaṅgika Logic ===

====Consequential syllogistic reasoning====
According to Tsongkhapa, if both people in a debate or discussion have a valid understanding of emptiness already, then autonomous syllogistic arguments could be quite effective. However, in a circumstance where one or both parties in a debate or discussion do not hold a valid understanding, "the debate [should be] founded on what the parties accept as valid. Hence, it is proper to refute opponents in terms of what they accept."{{sfn|Tsong Khapa|2002|p=227}} In other words, it is more appropriate to establish a position of emptiness through showing the logical consequences of the incorrect position that the opponent already accepts, than it is to establish emptiness through syllogistic reasoning using premises that the opponent (and perhaps even the proponent) do not fully or deeply understand.{{sfn|Tsong Khapa|2002|p=227-228}} Tsongkhapa quoting Chandrakirti, in the ''Lamrim Chenmo, Volume Three'', on the problem of relying on autonomous syllogistic reasoning:
{{quote|When one party posits something as a probative reason, even though valid cognition may establish it for the one who posits the syllogism, how can that person be certain that valid cognition establishes it for the other party?{{sfn|Tsong Khapa|2002|p=227}}}}Tsongkhapa argues further that the Prāsaṅgika's use of [[reductio ad absurdum]] is syllogistic, because one "refutes the opponent using a subject, a reason, and so forth that are accepted by that opponent."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lamrim Chenmo|last=Tsongkhapa|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if cause-effect relationships occur because the sprout itself produces the effect of being a sprout (self-arising), then this "would mean that something that already exists is being produced, [and] production would be purposeless and endless [... if] contradictions are assembled in this way, the only result is that the opponents understand them and abandon" wrong tenets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|To clarify with a more modern rendition: if 500 people were shown 100,000 slides of a seed turning into a small plant, would we expect them all to agree that on slide number 1,008 the seed causes the sprout? If one argues that the seed objectively and independently causes the sprout (other-arising) or that the sprout causes itself (self-arising) at the material level, then everyone would be forced to agree that this event occurs at a particular time. However, because the sprout arises relative to a conscious observer who designates the term-concept "sprout" onto the continuum of slides, we find that almost no one can agree where the seed ceases and the sprout arises. This is because the cause-effect relationship cannot be found at the objective material level. The cause-effect relationship is also dependently designated, a viewpoint which is established by Lama Tsongkhapa, Nagarjuna, and Buddapalita.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;}}

====Non-affirming negation====
A prominent and important feature of the {{IAST|Prāsaṅgika}} approach is their use of the ''non-affirming negation''. A non-affirming negation is a negation which does not leave something in the place of what has been negated. For instance, when one says that a Buddhist should not drink alcohol, they are not affirming that a Buddhist should, in fact, drink something else. One is merely negating the consumption of alcohol under a particular circumstance.{{refn|group=note|"[A non-affirming negation is defined as] a negative object in which no further entity is implied when the mind negates the object that is related to it."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Pabongka Rinpoche "''Liberation in Our Hands''" Pg 274-275&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Tsongkhapa, for the {{IAST|Prāsaṅgika}} the philosophical position of emptiness is itself a non-affirming negation, since emptiness is a "lack of inherent existence." One is not affirming anything in the place of that absence of inherence.&lt;ref&gt;Lama Tsongkhapa, Ocean of Reasoning, pg. 59&lt;/ref&gt; It is not the presence of some other quality. If one were to describe emptiness as the presence of some quality -for example, a "voidness" or a "thusness" - it would linguistically and philosophically contradict the nature of the object which it is attempting to characterize.&lt;ref&gt;The Gelug/Kagyu Tradition of Mahamudra, p.235&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ignorance - Prasaṅgika Object of Negation===
Pabongka Rinpoche states in ''Liberation in Our Hands'' that if we cannot correctly "recognize the nature of the false mode of existence that is being denied, we will not be able to realize the simple negation [Skr. ''prasajyapratisedhah'' or non-affirming negation] that is established through its refutation."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Pabongka Rinpoche "''Liberation in Our Hands''" Pg 274-275&lt;/ref&gt; For the Prāsaṅgika, when analyzing a table, the object being negated is not an abstract intellectual concept apart from the table which can be called 'inherent existing', but the conventionally appearing table itself, which appears to naive perception as being inherent. The table is not just empty of inherent existence in some abstract philosophical way; the identity of the table as it appears to normal, everyday perception - which misattributes inherence to the object - is being negated.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Middle Way (2002), p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; Lama Tsongkhapa explains:{{Quote| Suppose that we leave aside analysis of how [phenomena] appear—i.e., how they appear to a conventional awareness—and analyze the objects themselves, asking, 'What is the manner of being of these phenomena?' We find they are not established in any way. Ignorance does not apprehend phenomena in this way; it apprehends each phenomenon as having a manner of being such that it can be understood in and of itself, without being posited through the force of a conventional consciousness.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;}}We can say "therefore, [that] what exists objectively in terms of its own essence without being posited through the power of a subjective mind is called [...] 'intrinsic nature'" or [[ignorance (buddhism)|ignorance]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|He goes on to say: "The absence of this quality in the person is called the selflessness of the person; its absence in phenomena such as eyes, ears, and so forth is called the selflessness of objects. Hence, one may implicitly understand that the conceptions of that intrinsic nature as present in persons and objects are the conceptions of the two selves."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo Pg 213&lt;/ref&gt;}} Therefore, the object to be negated by reason is a conception that phenomena have an "ontological status—a way of existing—in and of themselves, without being posited through the force of an awareness.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; {{refn|group=note|He goes on to say: "The referent object that is thus apprehended by that ignorant conception, the independent ontological status of those phenomena, is identified as [the] hypothetical "self" or "intrinsic nature."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo Pg 212&lt;/ref&gt;}} Pabongka Rinpoche adds that "while simply knowing and using verbal explanations such as these may be enough to silence an opponent in debate we have not truly recognized the object to be refuted until we have recognized it within our own experience."&lt;ref&gt;Pabongka Rinpoche "''Liberation in Our Hands''" Pg 276&lt;/ref&gt; In furtherance of this:{{quote|When you try to identify the object to be refuted, you must investigate how the innate mistaken view of the self holds that the self is real because it possesses an inherently real essence. This involves examining both how the self ''appears'' to our natural, untutored mind and how it is ''grasped'' by this mind.&lt;ref&gt;Pabongka Rinpoche "''Liberation in Our Hands''" Pg 276-277&lt;/ref&gt;}}This is the meaning of both [[Avidyā (Buddhism)|ignorance]] and the object to be negated by [[Pramana#Buddhism|valid cognition]], according to the Madhyamaka-Prāsaṅgika in the view of Lama Tsongkhapa.

====Indo-Tibetan rope &amp; snake analogy====
Under low light, the thought might arise that a striped rope on the ground is a snake, "but there is nothing on top of or inside this rope [...] to which we could" validly apply the term and therefore establish a conventionally existing snake.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Dalai Lama, Alexander Berzin ''The Gelug-Kagyu Tradition of Mahamudra'' P 323&lt;/ref&gt; The Dalai Lama expands: {{quote|Like this example, a thought of 'me' may arise on the basis of the [[Skanda (Buddhism)|aggregate factors]] of our experience. But there is nothing about these aggregates as the basis for labeling - not any of their parts, nor the collection or network of their parts, nor their continuum over time, nor something separate and apart from them - which is a basis with the defining characteristic making it 'me,' to which we could possibly apply the name 'me.' That being the case, this 'me' is nothing more than simply what can be designated by a mental label on the basis of aggregate factors of experience.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Dalai Lama, Alexander Berzin ''The Gelug-Kagyu Tradition of Mahamudra'' P 323&lt;/ref&gt;}}In reality, the self of persons, objects, and abstracts is like the term-concept "snake" being designated upon a rope, "the snake is merely what can be designated by a mental label."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Dalai Lama, Alexander Berzin ''The Gelug-Kagyu Tradition of Mahamudra'' P 323&lt;/ref&gt; Like this, the object of negation or [[ignorance]] is viewed to be the thought and perception which grasps the self of persons and objects to be established within their respective bases of designation. To put this in somewhat simpler terms, the thought and perception which grasps persons, things, and abstracts phenomena as existing in-and-of themselves - with characteristics or an identity of their own - is seen to be [[ignorance]] in this system.

====Incorrect Object of Negation (Permanence)====
In the [[Gelug]]pa four tenets system, the object of negation is different for the Madhyamika-Prāsaṅgika than it is for [[Hinayana]] schools of [[Vaibhāṣika]] and [[Sautrāntika]].{{refn|Which are both schools of the [[Sarvastivada]].&lt;ref&gt;Berzin, Alexander. http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/abhidharma-tenet-systems/the-indian-tenet-systems/the-two-truths-vaibhashika-and-sautrantika&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}{{refn|Daniel Cozart explaining this idea in greater detail:"A second category of tenets is concerned with implications of the Mahayana and Hinayana path structures. For the most part, they are tenets propounded to demonstrate that some persons who are regarded by other schools as ''Arhats'' liberated beings-are only ersatz Arhats, having realized only a coarse selflessness and having thereby suppressed, but not removed from the root, the obstructions to liberation. These tenets, then, revolve around the unique Prasangika assertion that the root of cyclic existence is the conception of inherent existence, which is more subtle than the conception of a self described by other systems of tenets. Five assertions are elucidated in this regard: 
* One must realize emptiness in order to become liberated and therefore some ''"Arhats"'' who have only realized a coarse selflessness are not actually liberated.
* There is desire that either is, or is thoroughly mixed with, the conception of true existence, and so-called Arhats still have this sort of desire.
* Although some of these "Arhats" do indeed have yogic direct perception of the four noble truths, one does not have to be an Arhat or even a Superior (one who has directly realized emptiness) in order to have such yogic direct perception.
* Although some of these "Arhats" have indeed realized the coarse aspects of the four noble truths, such a realization is not sufficient to overcome the obstructions to liberation.
* Since true cessations, the irrevocable cessation of some portion of the afflictions of desire, hatred, etc., are also emptinesses, such "Arhats" who have not realized emptiness could not have experienced true cessations, i.e., could not have overcome the afflictive obstructions."&lt;ref&gt;Cozart, Daniel ''Unique Tenets of the Middle Way Consequence School Pg 235&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} Indeed, from the Prāsaṅgika viewpoint, Buddhist and non-Buddhist essentialist schools are not negating the correct object.&lt;ref&gt;Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo Pg 211&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|"Based on just this [intrinsic nature], the referent object of the way that ignorance apprehends things as explained above, essentialist schools—'''Buddhist and non-Buddhist'''—reify many different things. When you negate the referent of ignorance’s cognitive process, you completely stop all of these tenet-driven reifications, as though you cut a tree at its root. Therefore, those who have the faculty of wisdom should understand that the referent object of innate ignorance is the basic object of negation and should not devote themselves merely to refuting imaginary constructs that are imputed only by the advocates of philosophical tenets. [...] What binds all living beings in cyclic existence is innate ignorance; acquired ignorance exists only among those who advocate philosophical tenets, so it cannot be the root of cyclic existence. It is extremely important to gain specific and certain knowledge of this point."&lt;ref&gt;Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo Pg 211&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} According to Geshe Tenzin Zopa in ''Buddhist Tenets'', the various [[Hinayana]] schools are negating a number of different objects, but none of them are inherent existence. Geshe Tenzin Zopa states: "From [[Vaibhāṣika]] school, they [the Vasiputriyans] assert selflessness/emptiness of the person/self is that which is [[Impermanence|impermanent]] (can momentarily change), [[Skandha|has parts]] (physical parts, moments of time, various cardinal directions) and is [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependent]]."&lt;ref&gt;Geshe Tenzin Zopa, Commentary on [[Chokyi Gyaltsen|Chokyi Gyaltsen’s]] ''A Presentation of Tenets'' Pg 33&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Geshe Tenzin Zopa, by way of Chokyi Gyaltsen, states: "In Vaibashika school, there are 3 divisions and 18 subschools, one of which is the Theravadan school."&lt;ref&gt;Geshe Tenzin Zopa, Commentary on [[Chokyi Gyaltsen|Chokyi Gyaltsen’s]] ''A Presentation of Tenets'' Pg 21&lt;/ref&gt; This categorization is, however, in contention, given the apparent non-consensus between Gelugpa Scholars within themselves and those of the living Theravada tradition. Alexander Berzin states, for example, that the Theravada does not belong to the Vaibhashika.&lt;ref&gt;Berzin, Alexander, [http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/abhidharma-tenet-systems/the-indian-tenet-systems/the-two-truths-vaibhashika-and-sautrantika ''The Two Truths: Vaibhashika and Sautrantika''],&lt;/ref&gt; In the same publication Geshe Tenzin Zopa references: "the late Chief Reverend of Brickfield's Vihara K.Sri Dhammananda and Ven Dr Walpola Rahula, a well-known Theravada scholar highlights: "We must not confuse Hīnayāna ("Lesser Vehicle") with Theravāda ("Path of the Elders") because the terms are not synonymous. The term Hīnayāna Buddhism is used by scholars for a group of 18 early Buddhist schools, which none exist today. Theravāda as it appears today is usually traced back to the 3rd century BCE in Sri Lanka [...]"&lt;ref&gt;Geshe Tenzin Zopa, Commentary on [[Chokyi Gyaltsen|Chokyi Gyaltsen’s]] ''A Presentation of Tenets'' Pp. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; Geshe Tenzin Zopa then, however, goes on to equate Theravada and Hinayana, and states that Theravada is part of the Vaibashika school.|group=note}} Chandrakirti explains why the Prasangika do not see this as the final correct position:{{quote|When knowing [[anatta|selflessness]], some eliminate a permanent self,{{refn|group=note|"(...) [[anatta]] is the doctrine of non-self, and is an extreme empiricist doctrine that holds that the notion of an unchanging permanent self is a fiction and has no reality. According to Buddhist doctrine, the individual person consists of five skandhas or heaps - the body, feelings, perceptions, impulses and consciousness. The belief in a self or soul, over these five skandhas, is illusory and the cause of suffering."&lt;br&gt;[c] {{cite book|author=Richard Gombrich|title=Theravada Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZyJAgAAQBAJ|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-90352-8|page=47}}}} but we do not consider this to be the basis of the conception of "I." It is therefore astonishing to claim that knowing this [[anatta|selflessness]] expunges and uproots the view of the self. [This is equivalent to] if someone sees a snake living in the wall of his house. To ease his concern, someone else says, 'there is no elephant there.' Alas, to others it is ridiculous that this would expel the fear of the snake.&lt;ref&gt;Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo Pg 197&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}} Lama Tsongkhapa supports the analysis of Chandrakirti when he says: {{quote|If you do not understand this and fail to eradicate the perspective of innate ignorance, then, when you refute a personal self, you will only refute a self that is permanent, unitary, and independent.{{refn|group=note|The opposite of these terms being [[impermanence|impermanent]], [[Skandha|has parts]], and [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependent]]}}[...] Even if you actualized such a selflessness in meditation and consummated your cultivation of it, nothing would come of it. It would be extremely absurd to claim that you can overcome innate afflictions by seeing as nonexistent the two selves imputed by acquired misconceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo, V3 Pg 197&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

====Refuting that rational analysis is not required====
From the point of view of the opponents of Prasangika,{{refn|group=note|It is unclear which specific school of thought Tsongkhapa and Nagarjuna are debating with here when they say "some hold that." However, the following does seem to be a common statement.}} it is absurd "to conduct the extensive rational analysis required for refutations and proofs [which] is to meander among mere conventional words." They propose that "all phenomena are devoid of refutation and proof, in that, if something exists, it cannot be refuted, and, if it does not exist, it need not be refuted." An idea which Lama Tsongkhapa refers to as "a nonsensical collection of contradictions, showing neither general awareness of how reason establishes and negates things nor general awareness of how the path establishes and negates things."&lt;ref&gt;Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo V3 P 205&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Nagarjuna in ''Commentary on Refutation of Objections'': Childish beings are confused about the absence of real essence in all things, so we make them understand that there is no intrinsic nature in the things that they, confused by ignorance, reify as having intrinsic nature. Therefore, what you have said — that if there is no intrinsic nature, what use are the words, "There is no intrinsic existence," inasmuch as things would be established as without intrinsic nature even without any words, without saying anything — is not reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo V3 P 205&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Nagarjuna|Nagarjuna’s]] ''Refutation of Objections'' he deals with this idea in a similar way:

&lt;poem&gt;What use is it to establish the negation
Of what does not exist anyway, even without words?
To answer that, the words "does not exist"
Cause understanding; they do not eliminate.&lt;ref&gt;Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo V3 P 204-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

In his ''Commentary on Refutation of Objections'' Nagarjuna expands as follows:

&lt;poem&gt;The words, "All things lack intrinsic nature," do not cause things to 
lack intrinsic nature, but, in the absence of intrinsic nature, they do make it
understood that things lack intrinsic nature."&lt;ref&gt;Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo V3 P 205&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

This can be illustrated with the following paraphrased example found in the same text. If a person named Devadatta is not in the house, but someone says, "Devadatta is in the house." Then in order
to show that Devadatta is not there, someone else will say, "Devadatta is not there." Those words do not cause Devadatta not to be there but allow the first person to understand that Devadatta is not in the house. Similarly, the words, "Things lack intrinsic nature," do not cause things to lack intrinsic nature, but help the those confused by ignorance to gain a [[Pramana#Buddhism|valid cognition]] of reality.&lt;ref&gt;Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo V3 P 205&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dependent Origination - Conventional Truth===
At the time of Candrakīrti, the Prāsaṅgika discerned three levels of dependent origination:&lt;ref&gt;''Just Another Word for Nothing Left to Lose: Freedom, Agency and Ethics for Mādhyamikas'', by Jay Garfield [[Smith College]] (2013) in press.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Pratītyasamutpāda]] or 'dependent arising.' All things arise in dependence on causes and conditions and cease when those causes and conditions are no longer present.{{refn|group=note|"All things arise in dependence on causes and conditions, and this is the meaning of dependent origination".&lt;ref&gt;"[[Prasannapadā]]", 2b.; trans. Garfield, Candrakīrti. (2003). Sarnath: Gelukpa Student Welfare Committee.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
# All wholes are dependent upon their parts for existence, and all parts are dependent on their wholes for existence.{{refn|group=note|"Although both from the standpoint of reality and from that of everyday life, The sevenfold reasoning shows that a chariot cannot be established, in everyday life, without analysis it is designated in dependence on its parts."&lt;ref&gt;[[Madhyamakāvatāra]], VI:159", trans. Garfield''&lt;/ref&gt;}}
# [[Prajñaptir upādāya]] or 'dependent designation.' All phenomena are dependent for their existence on conceptual imputation.{{refn|group=note|"Although dependent origination is generally maintained to be dependence upon conditions, from our perspective, this is not inconsistent with [them existing in] dependence upon mundane nominal conventions."&lt;ref&gt;"Madhyamakavatara-bhasya", p.259,  trans. Garfield, Candrakīrti. (1992). Sarnath: Kagyud Relief and Protection Society.&lt;/ref&gt;}} 
According to Tsongkhapa, Prāsaṅgika asserts that all phenomena are empty of inherent existence or essence, because they are dependently co-arisen with [[Prajñaptir upādāya|mental imputation]]. All phenomenon in all possible worlds lack inherent existence and come into existence relative to a designating consciousness which co-arises with that phenomena.

=====Dependent Designation as Conventional Truth=====
Designation is, according to [[Geshe Kelsang Gyatso|Kelsang Gyatso]]'s translation of ''Lorig'',{{refn|group=note|The [[Gelug]] text on mind and mental factors.}} the application of a conceptual image or term to a selected object of mere experience.&lt;ref&gt;Geshe Kelsang Gyatso, ''Understanding the Mind'' Pp 9-12&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The 14th Dalai Lama: "When the issue of how do ultimately unfindable things actually exist becomes unbearable and we have to say something, the bottom line is that their existence is established by virtue simply of names. In other words, the existence of these things is established and proven by virtue simply of the fact that they can be named within the context of mental labeling. There is no additional need for an inherent, findable, defining characteristic on the side of the basis for labeling rendering things existent and giving them their identity. Thus the existence of ultimately unfindable things is merely conventional."{{sfn|Dalai Lama|Gelug/Kagyu Tradition of Mahamudra|p=148}}|group=note}} Anything which comes into existence through valid designation is part of "conventional reality" or "conventional truth." According to Lama Tsongkhapa, something is validly designated (exists conventionally) if it meets all of the following three conditions:
# It is known to a conventional consciousness;
# No other conventional cognition (within that [[Convention (norm)|convention]]) contradicts it from being thus known;
# Reason that accurately analyzes reality — that is, analyzes whether something intrinsically exists — does not contradict it.{{sfn|Tsong Khapa|2002|p=178}}

Whatever fails to meet those criteria does not exist. If something has a cause-effect relationship or a relationship of parts-whole, then those objects are already in existence. In order to be already existing, they must have been designated by a conceptual mind. To talk about an object that does not exist in relation to a subject is incoherent.&lt;ref&gt;Geshe Kelsang Gyatso, ''Understanding the Mind'' Pp 9&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|"Thus, [Chandrakirti] says that those are synonyms. 'Without depending on another' does not mean not depending on causes and conditions. Instead, 'other' refers to a subject, i.e., a conventional consciousness, and something is said not to depend on another due to not being posited through the force of that conventional consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo Pg212&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{refn|group=note|A parallel in western thought can be found in the viewpoint of [[intentionality]]: "{{quote|Every mental phenomenon is characterized by what the Scholastics of the Middle Ages called the intentional (or mental) inexistence of an object, and what we might call, though not wholly unambiguously, reference to a content, direction towards an object (which is not to be understood here as meaning a thing), or immanent objectivity. Every mental phenomenon includes something as object within itself, although they do not all do so in the same way. In presentation something is presented, in judgment something is affirmed or denied, in love loved, in hate hated, in desire desired and so on. This intentional in-existence is characteristic exclusively of mental phenomena. No physical phenomenon exhibits anything like it. We could, therefore, define mental phenomena by saying that they are those phenomena which contain an object intentionally within themselves.| Franz Brentano|source=''Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint'', edited by Linda L. McAlister (London: Routledge, 1995), pp. 88–89.}}}} According to Lama Tsongkhapa's interpretation of Nagarjuna, both causes and effects are merely designated by mind.&lt;ref name="Lama Tsongkhapa pg. 67"&gt;Lama Tsongkhapa, ''Ocean of Reasoning'', pg. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Parts and wholes - being among the components that make up reality - are also merely designated by mind. Relationships between objects cannot exist without being validly designated into existence.{{sfn|Tsong Khapa|2002|p=178}}{{refn|group=note|In ''Ocean of Reasoning,'' Tsongkhapa and Nagarjuna spell out various analysis to the effect that phenomenon cannot possibly exist without mental imputation. The list includes: "causes" including Conditions, Motion, the Senses, the Aggregates, the Elements, Desire &amp; the Desirous One, "Arising, Enduring, &amp; Ceasing," Agent &amp; Action, Prior Entity, Fire &amp; Fuel, Beginning &amp; End, Suffering, Compounded Phenomena, Contact, Essence, Bondage, Action, Self &amp; Phenomena, Time, Assemblage, Becoming &amp; Destruction, the Buddha, Errors, the Four Noble Truths, Nirvana, the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination, and Views. {{sfn|Ocean of Reasoning|Tsong Khapa|2006}}}} This is the meaning of "conventional truth" in this system.

=====Causes &amp; Conditions are merely designated=====
According to Tsongkhapa by way of Nagarjuna, the most pervasive relationship of co-dependent arising is the third relationship, dependent designation.{{refn|group=note|Tsongkhapa quoting [[Nagarjuna]]: "All things are emtpy by nature. Therefore, the unexcelled Tathagata taught the dependent origination of phenomena. That is the supreme meaning. The Buddha, relying on worldly conventions, states that all the various phenomena are in reality designated." Tsongkhapa goes on to say: "The ultimate mode of the existence of things is nothing but their absence of essence - that is, their being dependently originated. Hence, it is explained that all such things as arising are established as imputed through the power of convention [...] [T]he meaning of 'conventional existence' [had it not been spelled out in this way] would not be understood to be established as ''existent merely through the force of nominal convention."
 (emphasis original)&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, Jay &amp; Tsongkhapa. ''Ocean of Reasoning'' pp 12-3&lt;/ref&gt;}} From the Prāsaṅgika perspective, in order for something to exist, it must be designated validly by a designating consciousness. It is mind that determines that a cause has ceased and its effect is now in existence. To exemplify this, Lama Tsongkhapa quotes Buddhapalita's response to an Abhidharmica's objection: {{quote|"It is utterly impossible for time, [causes, effects, and collections of causes and conditions] and such to exist essentially, as you imagine. However, they are established as dependent designation."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lamrim Chenmo, Volume Three|last=Tsongkhapa|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=152–3, 156–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Lama Tsongkhapa by way of Buddhapalita, this was one of the points of Nagajuna's ''Chatuṣkoṭi''.{{refn|group=note|Buddhapalita says, "Nor do things arise from others, because then anything could arise from anything." [Tsongkhapa continues] Here, the reason why the absurd consequence of "if there was arising from another, anything could arise from anything" is presented is that the "other" in "arising from other" is not just something that is different in virtue of being the referent of a different noun, but something that is inherently existent as different.
 If it existed in that way, then the sprout's depending on the seed would be inconsistent; thus, their relation would be refuted. If [the sprout] were to arise from another unrelated object, then it would arise from anything!&lt;ref name="Lama Tsongkhapa pg. 67"&gt;Lama Tsongkhapa, ''Ocean of Reasoning'', pg. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;}} From ''Nagarjuna's Middle Way'': "1. Not from itself, not from another, not from both, nor without cause: Never in any way is there any existing thing that has arisen." According to Mark Siderits and Shōryū Katsura, "This is the overall conclusion for which Nāgārjuna will argue in this chapter: that existents do not come into existence as the result of causes and conditions."&lt;ref&gt;Mark Siderits and Shōryū Katsura (2013), ''Nagarjuna's Middle Way: Mulamadhyamakakarika'', Simon and Schuster, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; Both modern scholars like Mark Siderits and Shōryū Katsura, and classical commentators Lama Tsongkhapa agree on this point.&lt;ref name="Lama Tsongkhapa pg. 67"&gt;Lama Tsongkhapa, ''Ocean of Reasoning'', pg. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The implied modifying phrase in Nagarjuna's tetralema is "intrinsic" or "inherent" according to Tsongkhapa and Chandrakirti&lt;ref name="Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo pp185-194"&gt;Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo, V3 pp185-194&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo, V3 p 216&lt;/ref&gt;

So, the tetralemma would read: Not from intrinsic self, not from intrinsic other, not from intrinsic both, and not from intrinsic nothingness/causelessness. Notice that each one of these statements is a non-affirming negation which merely negates the subject and does not affirm some other mode of arising in its place.{{refn|group=note|''Question of the N›ga King Anavatapta (Anavatapta-n›gar›ja-parip¸cch›-sÒtra)'' says:
&lt;poem&gt;Whatever is produced from conditions is not produced;
It is not intrinsically produced.
Whatever depends upon conditions, I consider empty;
One who knows emptiness is diligent.&lt;/poem&gt;
[Tsongkhapa continues:] After the Buddha has stated in the first line, "Whatever is produced from conditions is not produced," he indicates with the second line the manner of non-production, "It is not intrinsically produced." Thus, adding a qualifying phrase to the object of negation, the Buddha says that things are not produced intrinsically.&lt;ref name="Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo pp185-194"&gt;Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo, V3 pp185-194&lt;/ref&gt;}} These four possibilities include all possible ways that a conventional phenomenon could arise if, in fact, they arose through some type of intrinsic arising process.{{refn|group=note|"Candrakırti’s Commentary on the "Middle Way" also says:
&lt;poem&gt;Because things are not produced
Causelessly, or from causes such as a divine creator,
Or from self, other, or both self and other,
They are produced dependently.&lt;/poem&gt;
Dependently produced dependent-arisings are free from the four extreme types of production.&lt;ref&gt;Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo, V3 P 186&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Each one of these modes is negated in sequence - self, other, both, no cause - to arrive at a mere absence: the absence of inherent modes of causality. These arguments are elucidated in great detail Lama Tsongkhapa's commentary on the [[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]] ''Ocean of Reasoning''.&lt;ref&gt;:"Ocean of Reasoning." [[Oxford University Press]] (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Parts-Whole are merely designated=====
Further, one can look to the Seven-Point Analysis of a Chariot by Chandrakirti and find a similar treatment of parts-whole: 
{{Quote|"A chariot is neither asserted to be other than its parts, nor to be non-other. It does not possess them. It does not depend on the parts and the parts do not depend on it. It is neither the mere collection of the parts, nor is it their shape. It is like this." ... a chariot is a mere imputation since it does not exist in these seven ways.&lt;ref name="Tsongkhapa 279"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lamrim Chenmo|last=Tsongkhapa|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=279}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

It is mind which determines that some collection of parts is now considered to be a whole.&lt;ref name="Tsongkhapa 279"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lamrim Chenmo|last=Tsongkhapa|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=279}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rigpawiki, [http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Sevenfold_reasoning_of_the_chariot ''Sevenfold Reasoning of the Chariot'']&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the relationship of ''dependent designation'' is the most pervasive among the three types of dependencies, according to Prāsaṅgika.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Therefore, Prāsaṅgika are not stating that nothing exists, but instead hold that phenomena ''only'' come into existence co-dependently with minds which are applying conceptual and nominal conventions to mere experiences.{{sfn|Dalai Lama "The Gelug/Kagyu Tradition of Mahamudra|Pg 101}}

=====Dependent Designation is merely designated=====

Yet, after you arise, when you inspect, you see that your mind still gives rise to the appearance of things that dependently arise, which do function and can only exist as simply what can be labeled by names. It is unmistakable that such things still naturally dawn, yet they are like dreams, mirages, reflections of the moon in water, and illusions.{{sfn|Dalai Lama "The Gelug/Kagyu Tradition of Mahamudra|Pg 101}}}} To simplify the above, in the direct cognition of [[rigpa]] or [[Buddha-nature#Gelug|clear light]],{{refn|group=note|{{quote|Once one pronounces the words "emptiness" and "absolute", one has the impression of speaking of the same thing, in fact of the absolute.

Thus they appear in reality - like a mirage or reflection appears in reality - but cannot be established as existing in-and-of themselves.

===Emptiness - Ultimate Truth===

====Inseparability of Conventional &amp; Ultimate Truth====
According to the Prasangika, dependent-arising and emptiness are inseparable, and exist in a relationship of entity or identity.&lt;ref&gt;Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo, V3 Pg 137&lt;/ref&gt; A relationship of entity or identity is one in which two objects are merely conceptually distinct, but not actually distinct. For example, the relationship between the mental categorization of a dog and that of an animal, with regards to the same being. If it is a dog, then it must also be an animal. Additionally, this relationship applies to impermanent phenomenon and products: if it's impermanent, it must be a product.&lt;ref&gt;Duckworth, Douglass. ''Mipam on Buddha-Nature: The Ground of the Nyingma Tradition'' Pg 255&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, if it is a conventional arising then ''it is emptiness'', and it if is emptiness, then ''it is a conventional arising.'' These two are merely conceptually distinct, but not actually distinct.&lt;ref&gt;Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo, V3 Pg 137&lt;/ref&gt; The two truths are defined only in relationship with one another. In the ''Heart Sutra'', [[Shariputra]] and [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhārtha Gautama]] illucidate the idea of the emptiness-conventionality inseparability: {{quote|&lt;poem&gt;"Form is empty. Emptiness is form. 
Emptiness is not other than form; form is also not other than emptiness.
In the same way, feeling, discrimination, compositional factors, and consciousness are empty.
Shariputra, likewise, all phenomena are emptitness; without characteristic; 
unproduced, unceased; stainless, not without stain; not deficient, not fulfilled."&lt;ref&gt;https://fpmt.org/wp-content/uploads/sutras/heart_sutra_bklt_lttr.pdf?x25788&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}} All phenomena are of the nature of emptiness and emptiness is nowhere to be found except as the nature of all phenomena. Emptiness is established as being synonymous with dependent arising. Dependent arising, also, is established as being synonymous with emptiness. The mere appearance of phenomena due to dependent designation is inseparable from the non-obstruction to their arising, which is emptiness.

====Emptiness of Emptiness====
According to both Tsongkhapa and Nagarjuna, emptiness is also empty of inherent existence: emptiness only exists nominally and conventionally. Emptiness is co-dependently arisen as a quality of conventional phenomenon and is itself a conventional phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Lama Tsongkhapa''Lamrim Chenmo''Pg 191&lt;/ref&gt; There is no emptiness just "floating around out there" or a "Great Emptiness from which everything else arises." For example, a table is empty of inherently being a table from its own side. This is referred to as "the emptiness of the table." The emptiness of the table exists conventionally as a property of that particular table. Lama Tsongkhapa quoting Chandrakirti: {{Quote|Since there is nothing at all that is not empty of intrinsic existence, it is perfectly reasonable to say that even the emptiness which is a seedling's lack of intrinsic nature lacks essential existence. [Which Chanrakirti agrees with when he states] If that which is called emptiness did have some essential existence, then things would have intrinsic nature. However, it does not.&lt;ref&gt;Lama Tsongkhapa''Lamrim Chenmo''Pg 191&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From the Prasaṅgika point of view, it is the same with all types of emptiness. There is no "independent emptiness" or "ultimate emptiness." Therefore, emptiness is an ultimate truth (a fact which applies to all possible phenomena, in all possible worlds), but it is not an ultimate phenomenon or ultimate reality (something which has always existed, is self-created, and is self-sustaining). It is also not a "Tao" or a primal substance from which all other things arise. Buddhapalita comically equates someone who thinks emptiness is inherent with someone who doesn't understand what "nothing" means: {{Quote|There is no way to overcome the misconceptions of those who think that emptiness is a real thing. For example, if you tell someone, 'I have nothing.' and that person says, 'Give me that nothing.' How could you make that person understand that you have nothing?&lt;ref&gt;Lama Tsongkhapa''Lamrim Chenmo''Pg 192&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nagarjuna paraphrases the Buddha in the ''Mulamadhyamikakarika'', stating that "the Conqueror said that emptiness eradicates all dogmatic views; as for those who take a dogmatic view of emptiness, he said that they are incurable.&lt;ref&gt;Lama Tsongkhapa''Lamrim Chenmo''Pg 192&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is clear that the Prasangika do not advocate an inherent form of emptiness.

====Karma is carried on the mere 'I'====
The Prasangika refute the idea of a [[Eight Consciousnesses|storehouse consciousness]] or [[Eight Consciousnesses|mind-basis-of-all consciousness]]. According to Daniel Cozart's interpretation of Ngawang Belden, "the Buddha taught the mind-basis-of-all provisionally, for the benefit of those who could be helped by believing in its existence but who would be harmed by hearing the teachings about emptiness. In his own mind, the basis of his teaching was emptiness. [...] This is because the purpose of positing a mind-basis-of-all is supposed to be to provide a basis for experience without positing external objects."&lt;ref&gt;Cozart, Daniel. "Unique Tenets of The Middle Way Consequence School" Pg 436&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Gelugpa]], the [[Yogachara|Chittamatra]] hold that the mind-basis-of-all consciousness is that which bears the karmic seeds and is findable upon analysis. That is, "if one sought the basis of the designation ''of the person'' one would discover the mind-basis-of-all."&lt;ref&gt;Cozart, Daniel. "Unique Tenets of The Middle Way Consequence School" Pg 235&lt;/ref&gt;

So, how is it that Madhyamika-Prasangika posit that beings accumulate karma and experience their effects without the mind-basis-of-all? They posit that karma is carried on the mere "I" which is dependently designated on the basis of the [[Skandha|aggregates]], stating that "it is a sufficient basis with which to associate the factors of disintegratedness ([[karma]])."&lt;ref&gt;Cozart, Daniel. "Unique Tenets of The Middle Way Consequence School" Pg 236&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Cozant expands by saying that since phenomena are neither inherently created nor inherently destroyed according to Prasangika, that "therefore, the possibility of a later effect is not precluded."&lt;ref&gt;Cozart, Daniel. "Unique Tenets of The Middle Way Consequence School" Pg 236-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eight unique tenets &amp; thirteen distinguishing features==
According to Daniel Cozart's ''Unique Tenets of the Middle Way Consequence School'' (based on the work of [[Jamyang Shayba]] and [[Ngawang Belden]]) there are eight unique tenets within the Madhyamika-Prasangika viewpoint:

* The Unique Way of Refuting a Mind-Basis-of-All
* The Unique Way of Refuting Self-Consciousness
* The Non-Assertion of Autonomous Reasons
* The Unique Way of Asserting External Objects
* The Proof That Hearers and Solitary Realizers Realize the Selflessness of Phenomena
* The Unique Way of Positing the Conception of a Self of Phenomena as an Affliction
* The Unique Way of Asserting That Disintegratedness Is a Functioning Thing
* The Unique Presentation of the Three Times&lt;ref&gt;Cozart, Daniel ''Unique Tenets of the Middle Way Consequence School'' Table of Contents&lt;/ref&gt;

He also cites thirteen distinguishing features of the Prasangika view:

* Valid Cognition Is Mistaken but Reliable
* Refutation of Autonomous Syllogisms
* Prasangika Perspective on the Destruction of the Obstructions to Omniscience
* Pramana Is Not Necessarily New Cognition
* Mental Direct Perception Can be Conceptual
* Prasarigika Perspectives on Nirvana
* The Two Selflessnesses of Persons and Phenomena Are Equally Subtle
* Desire and Aversion Conceive True Existence
* Common Beings Can Have Yogic Direct Perception
* One Can Directly Realize the Sixteen Aspects of the Four Noble Truths Even before the Path of Preparation
* True Cessations Are the Dharmadhatu
* Pratyaksa Refers to Objects
* How Prasangikas Avoid the Two Extremes&lt;ref&gt;Cozart, Daniel ''Unique Tenets of the Middle Way Consequence School'' Table of Contents&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Svātantrika in disguise===
According to the Padmakara Translation Group: {{Quote|The Gelugpa interpretation of Prāsangika has often been described by its critics as a form of Svātantrika in disguise, since its presentation of "conventional," as distinct from "true," existence seems very close to the "existence according to characteristics" that Bhavya had ascribed to phenomena on the relative level.{{sfn|Shantarakshita|Ju Mipham|2005|p=23}}}}

According to the Nyingma lineage, Ju Mipham was one of the critics who argued that Je Tsongkhapa was also a Svatantrika, because of the way he refutes true establishment instead of objects themselves.{{sfn|Shantarakshita|Ju Mipham|2005|p=21-24}} According to Ju Mipham, Je Tsongkhapa's approach is an excellent Svatantrika approach, that leads students in the right direction but will not lead to the true ultimate until they go further.{{sfn|Shantarakshita|Ju Mipham|2005|p=21-24}}

===Levels of realization===
As a result of Je Tsongkhapa's view, the Gelugpa lineage establishes a sort of ladder of progressively refined worldviews and identify the Svatantrika view as inferior to the Prasangika. Sakya and Kagyu scholars argued against the claim that students using Svatantrika do not achieve the same realization as those using the Prasangika approach;{{sfn|Shantarakshita|Ju Mipham|2005|p=21-24}} According to those critics, there is no difference in the realization of those using the Svatantrika and Prasangika approaches. They also argue that the Svatantrika approach is better for students who are not able to understand the more direct approach of Prasangika, but it nonetheless results in the same ultimate realization.{{sfn|Shantarakshita|Ju Mipham|2005|p=21-24}}

'''''Process and Reality''''' is a book by [[Alfred North Whitehead]], in which Whitehead propounds a philosophy of organism, also called [[process philosophy]]. The book, published in 1929, is a revision of the [[Gifford Lectures]] he gave in 1927–28.

{{quotation|We diverge from [[Descartes]] by holding that what he has described as primary ''attributes'' of physical bodies, are really the forms of internal relationships ''between'' actual occasions. Such a change of thought is the shift from [[materialism]] to [[Organic Realism]], as a basic idea of physical science.|''Process and Reality'', 1929, p. 471.}}

==Whitehead's ''Process and Reality''==
Whitehead's background was an unusual one for a speculative philosopher. Educated as a mathematician, he became, through his coauthorship and 1913 publication of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' with [[Bertrand Russell]], a major logician. Later he wrote extensively on physics and its philosophy, proposing a theory of [[gravity]] in [[Minkowski space]] as a logically possible alternative to [[Einstein's general theory of relativity]]. Whitehead's ''Process and Reality''&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1929"&gt;Whitehead, A.N. (1929). ''Process and Reality. An Essay in Cosmology. Gifford Lectures Delivered in the University of Edinburgh During the Session 1927–1928'', Macmillan, New York, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK.&lt;/ref&gt; is perhaps his philosophical master work.

The following is an attempt to provide an accessible outline of some of the main ideas in Whitehead's ''Process and Reality'', based on the book itself, but guided by a general reading of secondary sources, especially I. Leclerc's ''Whitehead's Metaphysics. An Introductory Exposition''.&lt;ref&gt;Leclerc, I. (1958). ''Whitehead's Metaphysics. An Introductory Exposition'', George Allen and Unwin Ltd, London, and Macmillan, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Whitehead often speaks of the metaphysics of ''Process and Reality'' as 'the philosophy of organism'.

The cosmology elaborated in ''Process and Reality'' posits an ontology based on the two kinds of existence of entity, that of actual entity and that of abstract entity or abstraction.

The ultimate abstract principle of actual existence for Whitehead is '''creativity'''. Actual existence is a process of becoming, and "... 'becoming' is a creative advance into novelty."&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead (1929) p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; It is manifest in what can be called 'singular causality'. This term may be contrasted with 'nomic causality'. An example of singular causation is that I woke this morning because my alarm clock rang. An example of nomic causation is that alarm clocks generally wake people in the morning. Aristotle recognises singular causality as [[Four causes#Description|efficient causality]]. For Whitehead, there are many contributory singular causes for an event. A further contributory singular cause of my being awoken by my alarm clock this morning was that I was lying asleep near it till it rang.

An '''actual entity''' is a general philosophical term for an utterly determinate and completely concrete individual particular of the actually existing world or universe of [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)#Summary#Theta|changeable entities]] considered in terms of singular causality, about which [[Aristotle#category|categorical statements]] can be made. Whitehead's most far-reaching and profound and radical contribution to metaphysics is his invention of a better way of choosing the actual entities. Whitehead chooses a way of defining the actual entities that makes them all alike, ''qua'' actual entities, with a single exception, God.

For example, for Aristotle, the actual entities were the [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)#Summary#Zeta|substance]]s, such as Socrates (a particular citizen of Athens) and Bucephalus (a particular horse belonging to Alexander the Great). Besides Aristotle's ontology of substances, another example of an ontology that posits actual entities is in [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]' [[Monadology|monads]], said to be 'windowless'.

===Whitehead's actual entities===

For Whitehead, the actual entities exist as the only foundational elements of reality, the ultimately existing facts of the world. Nothing "either in fact or in efficacy"&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead (1929) p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; underlies or lies beyond the actual entities; rather they underlie all reality.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead (1929) pp. 41, 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual entities are of two kinds, temporal and atemporal.

With one exception, all actual entities for Whitehead are '''temporal''' and are '''[[wiktionary:actual occasions|occasions of experience]]''' (which are not to be confused with [[consciousness]], or with mere subjectivity). This 'actual entity' idea is most distinctly characteristic of the metaphysics of ''Process and Reality'', and requires of the newly approaching reader a philosophically unprejudiced approach. An entity that people commonly think of as a simple concrete [[object (philosophy)|object]], or that Aristotle would think of as a substance – a human being included – is in this ontology considered to be a composite of indefinitely many occasions of experience.

The one exceptional actual entity is at once temporal and '''atemporal''': God. He is objectively immortal, as well as being immanent in the world. He is objectified in each temporal actual entity; but He is not an eternal object. Whitehead uses the term 'actual occasion' to refer only to purely temporal actual entities, those other than God.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead (1929) p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

The occasions of experience are of four grades. The first comprises processes in a physical vacuum such as the propagation of an electromagnetic wave or gravitational influence across empty space. The occasions of experience of the second grade involve just inanimate matter. The occasions of experience of the third grade involve living organisms. Occasions of experience of the fourth grade involve experience in the mode of presentational immediacy, which means more or less what are often called the [[qualia]] of subjective experience. So far as we know, experience in the mode of presentational immediacy occurs in only more evolved animals. That some occasions of experience involve experience in the mode of presentational immediacy is the one and only reason why Whitehead makes the occasions of experience his actual entities; for the actual entities must be of the ultimately general kind. Consequently, it is inessential that an occasion of experience have an aspect in the mode of presentational immediacy; occasions in the grades one, two, and three lack that aspect. The highest grade of experience "is to be identified with the canalized importance of free conceptual functionings".&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead (1929) pp. 269–270.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no [[Mind-body dualism|mind-matter duality]] in this ontology, because "mind" is simply seen as an abstraction from an occasion of experience which has also a material aspect, which is of course simply another abstraction from it; thus the mental and the material aspects are abstractions from one and the same concrete occasion of experience. The brain is part of the body, both being abstractions of a kind known as ''persistent physical objects'', neither being actual entities. Though not recognised by Aristotle, there is biological evidence, written about by [[Galen]],&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, R.E. (1973). ''Galen: On Psychology, Psychopathology, and Function and Diseases of the Nervous System. An Analysis of his Doctrines, Observations, and Experiments'', Karger, Basel, {{ISBN|978-3-8055-1479-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that the human brain is an essential seat of human experience in the mode of presentational immediacy. We may say that the brain has a material and a mental aspect, all three being abstractions from their indefinitely many constitutive occasions of experience, which are actual entities.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead (1929) p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inherent in each actual entity is its respective dimension of time. Potentially, each occasion of experience is causally consequential on every other occasion of experience that precedes it in time, and has as its causal consequences every other occasion of experience that follows; thus it has been said that Whitehead's occasions of experience are 'all window', in contrast to Leibniz's 'windowless' [[Monadology|monads]]. In time defined relative to it, each occasion of experience is causally influenced by prior occasions of experiences, and causally influences future occasions of experience. An occasion of experience consists of a process of prehending other occasions of experience, reacting to them.

The causal outcomes obey the usual well-respected rule that the causes precede the effects in time. Some pairs of processes cannot be connected by cause-and-effect relations, and they are said to be [[Spacetime#Basic concepts#Space-like interval|spatially separated]]. This is in perfect agreement with the viewpoint of the Einstein theory of [[special relativity]] and with the [[Minkowski space|Minkowski geometry]] of spacetime.&lt;ref name="Naber"&gt;Naber, G.L. (1992). ''The Geometry of Minkowski Spacetime. An Introduction to the Mathematics of the Special Theory of Relativity'', Springer, New York, {{ISBN|978-0-387-97848-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear that Whitehead respected these ideas, as may be seen for example in his 1919 book ''An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Natural Knowledge''&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1919"&gt;Whitehead, A.N. (1919). ''An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Natural Knowledge'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in ''Process and Reality''. Time in this view is relative to an inertial reference frame, different reference frames defining different versions of time.

The actual entity, the occasion of experience, is logically '''atomic''' in the sense that it cannot be cut and separated into two other occasions of experience. This kind of logical atomicity is perfectly compatible with indefinitely many spatiotemporal overlaps of occasions of experience. One can explain this atomicity by saying that an occasion of experience has an internal causal structure that could not be reproduced in each of the two complementary sections into which it might be cut. Nevertheless, an actual entity can completely contain indefinitely many other actual entities.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead (1929) p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitehead's theory of extension concerns the spatio-temporal features of his occasions of experience. Fundamental to both Newtonian and to quantum theoretical mechanics is the concept of velocity. The measurement of a velocity requires a finite spatiotemporal extent. Because it has no finite spatiotemporal extent, a single point of Minkowski space cannot be an occasion of experience, but is an abstraction from an infinite set of overlapping or contained occasions of experience, as explained in ''Process and Reality''.&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1929"/&gt; Though the occasions of experience are atomic, they are not necessarily separate in extension, spatiotemporally, from one another. Indefinitely many occasions of experience can '''overlap''' in Minkowski space.

An example of a nexus of temporally overlapping occasions of experience is what Whitehead calls an '''enduring physical object''', which corresponds closely with an Aristotelian substance. An enduring physical object temporally has an earliest and a last member. Every member (apart from the earliest) is a causal consequence of the earliest member of the nexus, and every member (apart from the last) of such a nexus is a causal antecedent of the last. There are indefinitely many other causal antecedents and consequences of the enduring physical object, which overlap, but are not members, of the nexus. No member of the nexus is spatially separate from any other member. Within the nexus are indefinitely many continuous streams of overlapping nexūs, each stream including the earliest and the last member of the enduring physical object. Thus an enduring physical object, like an Aristotelian substance, undergoes changes and adventures during the course of its existence.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead (1929) pp. 52, 87, 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect of the atomicity of occasions of experience is that they do not change. An actual entity is what it is. An occasion of experience can be described as a process of change, but is itself unchangeable.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead (1929) p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Whitehead's abstractions===

Whitehead's '''abstractions''' are conceptual entities that are abstracted from or derived from and founded upon his actual entities. Abstractions are themselves not actual entities, but are the only entities that can be real.

An abstraction is a conceptual entity that involves more than one single actual entity. Whitehead's ontology refers to importantly structured collections of actual entities as nexuses of actual entities. Collection of actual entities into a '''nexus''' emphasises some aspect of those entities, and that emphasis is an abstraction, because it means that some aspects of the actual entities are emphasised or dragged away from their actuality, while other aspects are de-emphasised.

Whitehead admitted indefinitely many eternal objects. An example of an '''eternal object''' is a number, such as the number 'two'. Whitehead held that eternal objects are abstractions of a very high degree. Many abstractions, including eternal objects, are potential ingredients of processes.

===Relation between actual entities and abstractions stated in the ontological principle===

For Whitehead, besides its temporal generation by the actual entities which are its contributory causes, a process may be considered as a concrescence of abstract '''ingredient''' eternal objects. God enters into every temporal actual entity.

Whitehead's '''ontological principle''' is that whatever reality pertains to an abstraction is derived from the actual entities upon which it is founded or of which it is comprised.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead (1929) pp. 48, 64,68.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication data==
The several originally published editions of ''Process and Reality'' were from New York and from Cambridge UK. There were many textual errors, partly due to Whitehead's imperfect handwriting and lack of interest in proof-reading. A largely corrected scholarly redaction was eventually prepared and published as ''Process and Reality: An Essay in Cosmology'' (1929). 1979 corrected edition, edited by [[David Ray Griffin]] and Donald W. Sherburne, Free Press, {{ISBN|0-02-934570-7}}.

[[File:Jay &amp; Trey Cartoon Swearing.jpg|thumb|In [[cartoon]]s and [[comics]], profanity is often depicted by substituting symbols for words ("[[The Lexicon of Comicana#Examples|grawlixes]]" in the lexicon of cartoonist [[Mort Walker]])]]

'''Profanity''' is [[society|socially]] offensive language,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/profanity Definition of Profanity]", Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, retrieved on 2014-08-31.&lt;/ref&gt; which may also be called '''curse words''', '''cuss words''', '''swear words''', '''crude language''', '''coarse language''', '''oaths''', '''[[Blasphemy|blasphemous]] language''', '''[[vulgarity|vulgar]] language''', '''[[lascivious behavior|lewd]] language''', '''choice words''', or '''[[Expletive attributive|expletives]]'''. 

Used in this sense, profanity is language that is generally considered to be strongly impolite, rude or offensive. It can show a [[pejorative|debasement of someone or something]], or show intense emotion.

In its older, more literal sense, "profanity" refers to a lack of respect for things that are held to be [[sacred]], which implies anything inspiring deserving of [[Reverence (emotion)|reverence]], as well as  [[Desecration|behaviour showing similar disrespect]] or causing [[religious offense]].&lt;ref name="Longman - profanity"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/profanity | title=Definition of profanity | publisher=[[Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English]] – online | accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term "profane" originates from classical Latin "profanus", literally "before (outside) the temple". It carried the meaning of either "desecrating what is holy" or "with a secular purpose" as early as the 1450s.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary Online, "profane", retrieved 2012-02-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|profane}}&lt;/ref&gt; Profanity represented secular indifference to religion or religious figures, while [[blasphemy]] was a more offensive attack on religion and religious figures, considered [[sin]]ful, and a direct violation of [[The Ten Commandments]]. Moreover, many [[Bible verses]] speak against swearing.&lt;ref name=swearingisbad&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openbible.info/topics/bad_words|title=Bad Words [in the Bible]|publisher=OpenBible.info|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Profanities, in the original meaning of ''blasphemous profanity'', are part of the ancient tradition of the comic cults which laughed and scoffed at the deity or deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bakhtin |first=Mikhail |authorlink=Mikhail Bakhtin |year=1993 |title=[[Rabelais and His World]] |others=Iswolski, Hélène (trans.) |location=Bloomington |publisher=Indiana University Press |origyear=1941|pages= 5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eleazar M.

=== English ===

In English, swear words and curse words tend to have Germanic, rather than Latin [[etymology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Swear words, etymology, and the history of English {{!}} OxfordWords blog |url=https://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2015/06/17/swear-words-etymology-and-the-history-of-english/ |website=OxfordWords blog |accessdate=2 October 2018 |date=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Original research inline|date=October 2018}} "[[Shit]]" has a Germanic root,&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|shit}}&lt;/ref&gt; as, likely, does "[[fuck]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|fuck}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more technical alternatives are often Latin in origin, such as "[[Defecation|defecate]]" or "[[Excretion|excrete]]" and "[[Fornication|fornicate]]" or "[[Sexual intercourse|copulate]]" respectively.  Because of this, profanity is sometimes referred to colloquially as "Anglo-Saxon".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cit web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/anglo-saxon|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries|title=Definition of Anglo-Saxon|access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is not always the case.  For example, the word [[wanker]] is considered profane in Britain but its origin dates only to the middle of the 20th Century.&lt;ref name="early"&gt;A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English: Colloquialisms and Catch Phrases, Fossilised Jokes and Puns, General Nicknames, Vulgarisms and Such Americanisms As Have Been Naturalised.

==Research==
Analyses of recorded conversations reveal that an average of roughly 80–90 words that a person speaks each day{{spaced ndash}} 0.5% to 0.7% of all words{{spaced ndash}} are swear words, with usage varying from 0% to 3.4%. In comparison, [[Grammatical person|first-person plural]] pronouns (''we'', ''us'', ''our'') make up 1% of spoken words.&lt;ref name="Jay"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jay | first1 = T. | title = The Utility and Ubiquity of Taboo Words | doi = 10.1111/j.1745-6924.2009.01115.x | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 153–161 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = | url = http://www.psychologicalscience.org/journals/pps/4_2_inpress/Jay.pdf| accessdate = 2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A three-country poll conducted by [[Angus Reid Public Opinion]] in July 2010 found that Canadians swear more often than Americans and British when talking to friends, while Britons are more likely than Canadians and Americans to hear strangers swear during a conversation.&lt;ref name="ARPO"&gt;Reid, Angus.

Swearing performs certain psychological functions, and uses particular linguistic and neurological mechanisms; all these are avenues of research. Functionally similar behavior can be observed in chimpanzees, and may contribute to our understanding, notes ''New York Times'' author Natalie Angier.&lt;ref name="angier" /&gt; Angier also notes that swearing is a widespread but perhaps underappreciated anger management technique; that "Men generally curse more than women, unless said women are in a sorority, and that university provosts swear more than librarians or the staff members of the university day care center".&lt;ref name="angier"&gt;{{citation

[[Keele University]] researchers Stephens, Atkins, and Kingston found that [[Hypoalgesic effect of swearing|swearing relieves the effects of physical pain]].&lt;ref name=Stephens&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Swearing as a Response to Pain|author1=Richard Stephens |author2=John Atkins |author3=Andrew Kingston  |last-author-amp=yes |work=NeuroReport| volume=20|issue=12|year=2009|pages=1056–60|doi=10.1097/wnr.0b013e32832e64b1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephens said "I would advise people, if they hurt themselves, to swear".&lt;ref name="joelving"&gt;

However, the overuse of swear words tends to diminish this effect.&lt;ref name="joelving"/&gt;  The Keele team won the [[Ig Nobel Prize|Ig Nobel Peace Prize]] in [[List of Ig Nobel Prize winners#2010|2010 for their research]].

A team of neurologists and psychologists at the UCLA Easton Center for Alzheimer's Disease Research suggested that swearing may help differentiate [[Alzheimer's disease]] from [[frontotemporal dementia]].&lt;ref name=Ringman&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Use of Profanity During Letter Fluency Tasks in Frontotemporal Dementia and Alzheimer Disease |author=Ringman, JM, Kwon, E, Flores, DL, Rotko, C, Mendez, MF &amp; Lu, P |work=Cognitive &amp; Behavioral Neurology| volume=23|issue=3|year=2010|pages=159–164|doi=10.1097/wnn.0b013e3181e11392|pmc=3594691|pmid=20829665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neurologist [[Antonio Damasio]] noted that despite loss of language due to damage to the language areas of the brain, patients were still often able to swear.&lt;ref&gt;[[António Damásio|Damasio, Antonio]] (1994) [[Descartes' Error: Emotion, Reason, and the Human Brain]]. {{ISBN|978-0-399-13894-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of researchers from [[Wright State University]] studied why people swear in the online world by collecting tweets posted on [[Twitter]]. They found that cursing is associated with negative emotions such as sadness (21.83%) and anger (16.79%) thus showing people in the online world mainly use curse words to express their sadness and anger towards others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://time.com/8760/cursing-study-10-lessons-about-how-we-use-swear-words-on-twitter/ "#Cursing Study: 10 Lessons About How We Use Swear Words on Twitter"].

An interdisciplinary team of researchers from the [[University of Warsaw]] investigated bilingual swearing: why is it easier to swear in a foreign language? Their finding that bilinguals strengthen the offensiveness of profanities when they switch into their second language, but soften it when they switch into their first tongue, but do both statistically significantly only in the case of ethnophaulisms (ethnic slurs) led the scientist to the conclusion that switching into the second language exempts bilinguals from the social norms and constraints (whether own or socially imposed)  such as political correctness, and makes them more prone to swearing and offending others.&lt;ref name="ParadowskiGawinkowskaBilewicz2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gawinkowska M, Paradowski MB, Bilewicz M |title=Second language as an exemptor from sociocultural norms.

===Types by purpose===
According to [[Steven Pinker]], there are five possible functions of swearing—although others ([[e.g., Salmani Nodoushan]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Salmani Nodoushan | first1 = M.

* [[Abusive]] swearing, intended to offend, intimidate or otherwise cause emotional or psychological harm
* [[Catharsis|Cathartic]] swearing, used in response to pain or misfortune
* [[Dysphemistic]] swearing, used to convey that the speaker thinks negatively of the subject matter, and to make the listener do the same
* [[:wikt:emphasis|Emphatic]] swearing, intended to draw additional attention to what is considered to be worth paying attention to
* [[Idiom in English language|Idiomatic]] swearing, used for no other particular purpose, but as a sign that the conversation and relationship between speaker and listener is informal

==Legality==
===Australia===
Three Australian states ([[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]) have laws against using "offensive language" in public. These offences are classed as a [[summary offence]]. However, if the court is satisfied that the individual concerned had "a reasonable excuse to behave in such a manner", no offence is committed. In Australia's remaining states and territories, swearing is not [[Illegal per se|illegal ''per se'']], but depending on circumstances may constitute [[disorderly conduct]] or a [[breach of the peace]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findlaw.com.au/articles/4251/swearing-in-public-is-against-the-law-really.aspx Swearing in Public is Against the Law (Really)] – FindLaw Australia&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brazil ===
In Brazil, the [[Penal Code of Brazil|Penal Code]] does not contain any penalties for profanity in public in a direct manner. However, direct offenses against one can be considered a [[Defamation|crime against honor]], with penalty of imprisonment of one to three months or a fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://brasil.mylex.net/legislacao/codigo-penal-cp-art140_90106.html|title=Código Penal CP com jurisprudência unificada|website=brasil.mylex.net|language=pt|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis of the offense is considered "subjective", depending on the context of the discussion and the relationship between the parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wsaraiva.com/2013/06/12/calunia-difamacao-e-injuria-os-crimes-contra-a-honra/comment-page-10/|title=Calúnia, difamação e injúria: os crimes contra a honra|date=2013-06-12|work=Blog de Wellington Saraiva|access-date=2018-05-11|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Canada===
Section 175 of Canada's [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] makes it a criminal offence to "cause a disturbance in or near a public place" by "swearing […] or using insulting or obscene language". Provinces and municipalities may also have their own laws against swearing in public. For instance, the Municipal Code of [[Toronto]] bars "profane or abusive language" in public parks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legalblogs.findlaw.ca/uncommon-law/canadas-weirdest-laws-its-illegal-to-swear-in-a-toronto-park-1004/ Canada’s weirdest laws: it’s illegal to swear in a Toronto park], FindLaw Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016, a man in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], was arrested for using profane language at a protest against [[Bill C-51 (41st Canadian Parliament, 2nd Session)|Bill C-51]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/06/24/nova-scotia-man-facing-trial-for-swearing-in-public.html Nova Scotia man facing trial for swearing in public], thestar.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, the ''Summary Offences Act 1981'' makes it illegal to use "indecent or obscene words in or within hearing of any public place". However, if the defendant has "reasonable grounds for believing that his words would not be overheard" then no offence is committed. Also, "the court shall have regard to all the circumstances pertaining at the material time, including whether the defendant had reasonable grounds for believing that the person to whom the words were addressed, or any person by whom they might be overheard, would not be offended".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1981/0113/latest/whole.html#DLM53500|title=Summary Offences Act 1981 No 113 (as at 01 March 2017), Public Act – New Zealand Legislation|website=www.legislation.govt.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

;In public
Swearing, in and of itself, is not usually a [[crime|criminal offence]] in the [[United Kingdom]] although in context may constitute a component of a crime. However, it may be a criminal offence in [[Salford Quays]] under a [[public space protection order]] which outlaws the use of "foul and abusive language" without specifying any further component to the offence, although it appears to be unclear as to whether all and every instance of swearing is covered.  [[Salford City Council]] claims that the defence of "reasonable excuse" allows all the circumstances to be taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/granada/2016-03-02/salford-council-tries-to-outlaw-swearing-at-the-quays/|title=Salford Council tries to outlaw swearing at The Quays|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[England and Wales]], swearing in public where it is seen to cause [[harassment, alarm or distress]] may constitute an offence under section 5(1) and (6) of the [[Public Order Act 1986]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/64 |title=Public Order Act 1986 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Scotland]], a similar common law offence of [[breach of the peace]] covers issues causing public alarm and distress.

;In the workplace
In the United Kingdom, swearing in the workplace can be an act of [[Misconduct|gross misconduct]] under certain circumstances. In particular, this is the case when swearing accompanies insubordination against a superior or humiliation of a subordinate employee. However, in other cases it may not be grounds for instant dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lindermyers.co.uk/is-swearing-in-the-workplace-legal/ Swearing in the Workplace]. Retrieved 2012-11-19.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a UK site on work etiquette, the "fact that swearing is a part of everyday life means that we need to navigate a way through a day in the office without offending anyone, while still appreciating that people do swear. Of course, there are different types of swearing and, without spelling it out, you really ought to avoid the 'worst words' regardless of who you’re talking to".&lt;ref name="worketiquette"&gt;[http://www.worketiquette.co.uk/swearing-workplace.html Work Etiquette&amp;nbsp;– Swearing in the Workplace]. Retrieved 2012-11-19&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to swearing between colleagues, the site explains that "although it may sound strange, the appropriateness [of] swearing [...] is influenced largely by the industry you are in and the individuals you work with". The site continues to explain that, even in a workplace in which swearing is the norm, there is no need to participate in it.&lt;ref name="worketiquette" /&gt; The site stresses that swearing is, in general, more problematic in asymmetric situations, such as in the presence of senior management or clients, but it also mentions that a "holier than thou" attitude towards clients may be problematic.&lt;ref name="worketiquette" /&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that "36% of the 308 UK senior managers and directors having responded to a survey accepted swearing as part of workplace culture", but warned about specific inappropriate uses of swearing such as when it is discriminatory or part of bullying behaviour. The article ends with a quotation from Ben Wilmott (Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development): "Employers can ensure professional language in the workplace by having a well drafted policy on bullying and harassment that emphasises how bad language has potential to amount to [[harassment]] or [[bullying]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Matt Keating |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2006/jun/03/careers.work |title=Should swearing be tolerated in the workplace? |publisher=Guardian |date= 2006-06-03|accessdate=2010-05-12 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{See also|Actionable indecency|United States obscenity law}}
In the United States, courts have generally ruled that the government does not have the right to prosecute someone solely for the use of an expletive, which would be a violation of their [[freedom of speech|right to free speech]] enshrined in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. On the other hand, they have upheld convictions of people who used profanity to incite riots, harass people, or [[breach of the peace|disturb the peace]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.howstuffworks.com/swearing3.htm How Swearing Works], HowStuffWorks.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, a North Carolina statute that made it illegal to use "indecent or profane language" in a "loud and boisterous manner" within earshot of two or more people on any public road or highway was struck down as unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/news/states-anti-profanity-law-unconstitutional-rules-superior-court-judge STATE’S ANTI-PROFANITY LAW UNCONSTITUTIONAL RULES SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE], ACLU.&lt;/ref&gt;

Minced oaths are [[euphemism|euphemistic]] expressions made by altering or clipping profane words and expressions to make them less objectionable. Although minced oaths are often acceptable in situations where profanity is not (including the radio), some people still consider them profanity.  In 1941, a judge threatened a lawyer with [[contempt of court]] for using the word ''darn''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Montagu | first = Ashely | title = The Anatomy of Swearing | publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press | year= 2001 | location = Philadelphia | page = 298 | url = | isbn = 0-8122-1764-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Phrase Finder minced"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/minced-oath.html|title=Minced oath|publisher=The Phrase Finder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the film ''[[Sweet Sixteen (2002 film)|Sweet Sixteen]]'' generated some media debate as it was given an 18 certificate for the very large amount of profanity, and not for any violent or sexual content.&lt;ref name="BBFCcasestudy"&gt;[http://www.bbfc.co.uk/case-studies/sweet-sixteen BBFC Case Studies – Sweet Sixteen]. bbfc.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;  Loach argued that the language used was typical of the working-classes in [[Greenock]] in [[Scotland]] and that the BBFC censors had a "London-centric view".&lt;ref name="BBFCcasestudy"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5277">'''Shalom bayit'''&lt;ref&gt;This is the colloquial pronunciation of the phrase. The correct Hebrew pronunciation is "shlom bayit." ({{cite book|last=Goldstein|first=Warren|authorlink=Warren Goldstein|title=Defending the Human Spirit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uuizffmvKqQC&amp;pg=PA216&amp;lpg=PA216&amp;dq=shlom+bayit&amp;source=web&amp;ots=JV4HKsJhZM&amp;sig=wxjJCAPUESHZcsq2B9GrqlWoegg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=J6aZScS4A4OB_gbh25T8CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result|accessdate=17 December  2012|year=2006|publisher=[[Feldheim Publishers]]|isbn=158330732X|page=216}})&lt;/ref&gt; ({{Hebrew Name 1|שְׁלוֹם בַּיִת||lit. ''peace of the home''}}) (also '''shelom bayit''', '''shlom bayit''', or (Yiddish) '''sholom bayis''') is the [[Jewish]] religious concept of domestic harmony and good relations between husband and wife. In a Jewish court of law, ''shalom bayit'' is the Hebrew term for marital reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.family-laws.co.il/english/article.asp?articleID=1766&amp;categoryID=1&amp;subCategoryID=22&amp;subCategoryName=Jewish%20Divorce%20Tactics:%20Women Family law]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of term==
The term ''sh'lom beto'' ({{Hebrew Name 1|שְׁלוֹם בֵּיתוֹ||lit ''peace of his home''}}) is found in the [[Talmud]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Shabbat (Talmud)|Tractate Shabbat]] 23b&lt;/ref&gt; regarding domestic peace in general. Nowadays, it is mostly used regarding matrimonial peace.

==As a Jewish value==
Throughout the history of the Jewish people, Jews have held an ideal standard for Jewish family life that is manifested in the term ''shalom bayit''. ''Shalom bayit'' signifies completeness, wholeness, and fulfillment. Hence, the traditional Jewish marriage is characterized by peace, nurturing, respect, and ''[[chesed]]'' (roughly meaning ''kindness'', more accurately ''loving-kindness''), through which a married couple becomes complete. It is believed that God's presence dwells in a pure and loving home&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sotah]]'' 17a&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jewish culture, a marriage is described as a "match made in heaven," and is treated as a holy enterprise. For example, [[erusin|the Jewish betrothal ceremony]] is referred to in [[classical rabbinic literature]] as ''Kiddushin'' (meaning ''hallowing'' / ''sanctification'' / ''consecration''). By declaring the marriage union sacred, a couple stands sanctified before God. It is in a relationship where both husband and wife recognize each other as creations in God's image and treat each other accordingly that true sanctity emanates forth. Moreover, this sanctity of the marital union reminds the Jewish husband and wife to express their holiness through marriage and to build a home based on mutual love, respect, and chesed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aol.com/Agunah/marriage.htm The Jewish Laws of Marriage]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In practice ===
The greatest praise the Talmudic rabbis offered to any woman was that given to a wife that fulfils the wishes of her husband.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nedarim]]'' 66b&lt;/ref&gt; The husband too was expected to love his wife as much as he loves himself, and honour her ''more'' than he honours himself;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]]'' 76b&lt;/ref&gt; indeed, one who honours his wife was said, by the classical rabbis, to be rewarded with wealth.&lt;ref name="BaMe59b"&gt;''[[Baba Metzia]]'' 59b&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a husband was expected to discuss with his wife any worldly matters that might arise in his life.&lt;ref name="BaMe59b" /&gt;

[[Tough love]] was frowned upon; the Talmud forbids a husband from being overbearing to his household,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gittin]]'' 6b&lt;/ref&gt; and [[domestic abuse]] by him&lt;!--but not by her--&gt; was also condemned.&lt;ref name="JewEncHusWif"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|article=Husband and wife|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=986&amp;letter=H}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was said of a wife that ''God counts her [[tears]]''.&lt;ref name="JewEncHusWif" /&gt;

==In the Midrash ==
In Jewish thought and law, domestic harmony is an important goal; to this end, an early [[midrash]] argues that a wife should not leave the home ''too frequently''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Genesis Rabbah]]'' 65:2&lt;/ref&gt; 

The goal may even warrant engaging in a "[[white lie]]". According to the [[Talmud]], when God tells [[Sarah]] she will give birth to a son, she expresses disbelief, saying: "After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my husband being old also?"  But when God speaks to [[Abraham]], he says: "Why did Sarah laugh and say, 'Will I really have a child, now that I am old?" (Genesis: 18:12-13). The rabbis comment that God omitted Sarah's mention of Abraham's age out of concern for their ''shalom bayit''.

'''''Swami Vivekananda''''' is a 1998 Indian [[biographical film]] directed by [[G. V. Iyer]] and produced by [[T. Subbarami Reddy]].&lt;ref name="Four-Hour Vivekananda Film Is a Fleet-Footed Turkey"&gt;{{cite web|title=Four-Hour Vivekananda Film Is a Fleet-Footed Turkey|url=http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=3601|publisher=Hinduism Today|accessdate=9 July 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HzQgj0yK?url=http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=3601|archivedate=9 July 2013|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took Iyer 11 years to finish the research work required for the film and to write the screenplay.

The film starred [[Sarvadaman D. Banerjee]] as [[Swami Vivekananda]], the 19th-century [[Hindu]] monk, and [[Mithun Chakraborty]] as [[Ramakrishna]], his guru. Even though the film was completed and was considered for 1995 national awards, the film got released on 12 June 1998. The film was premiered on India's [[Public broadcasting|public service broadcaster]] ''[[Doordarshan]]'' on 15 August 1998, the country's [[Independence Day (India)|Independence Day]].

The film received mixed, mainly negative, reviews from critics. [[Mithun Chakraborty]]'s acting in this film was widely appreciated and he won his third [[National Film Award (India)|National Film Award]].

== Plot ==
[[Image:Mithunramakrishna.jpg|left|thumb|240px|Mithun Chakraborty as [[Ramakrishna|Ramakrishna Paramahamsa]]]]
The film mainly captures the events of Vivekananda's life from his birth to 1897, when he returned to India from the West. The film begins with the birth of [[Narendranath Datta]] (pre-monastic name of Swami Vivekananda) and shows the neighbors and relatives of Datta family celebrating the event. It immediately moves to the scene where Narendranath sees his father [[Vishwanath Datta]] is donating money, clothes, food to poor and distressed people. Seeing this, young Narendranath asks his father to give him something too, and his father tells him to go and look at mirror and find what he had already given him. Following his father's suggestion, Narendranath goes to the room, sees his image in the mirror.

Different events of child Narendranath are shown one by one, such as his mother is melodiously reciting religious scriptures which leaves an impression on his young mind, Narendranath practicing meditation, his mother is teaching him that experience is true knowledge, and his interest in studying a wide range of subjects.

Young Narendranath attends college where he gets acquainted with European literature and contemporary social and religious movements. He also joins ''[[Brahmo Samaj]]''. But there he finds that the leader who is suggesting others to resist child marriage, is himself organizing his minor daughter's marriage with a wealthy person. Narendranath goes to [[Debendranath Tagore]] and asks him if he has seen God. Tagore confesses that he did not have that experience and also tells Narendranath that he had ''Yogi'''s eyes.

Narendranath meets Ramakrishna in a friend's house where Narendranath sings a devotional song ''Bina Prem Dhiraj Nahi''. Narendranath's song impresses Ramakrishna who asks him to visit [[Dakshineswar Kali Temple]], where Ramakrishna was based. Following Ramakrishna's invitation, Narendranath visits Dakshinewsar. The relation between Ramakrishna and Narendranath have been shown with great details. Narendranath initially rejects Ramakrishna but gradually accepts him as his master. Ramakrishna teaches him the true meaning of religion and how one can find God.

After the death of Ramakrishna, Narendranath takes formal monastic vow, becomes a ''[[Sannyasi]]'' and a wandering monk. In [[Alwar]], he meets Raja Mangal Singh whom he tells Hindu's idol-worship is actually a symbolic form of worship.

In 1893, Vivekananda goes to Chicago to attend the [[Parliament of the World's Religions]]. There he gets tremendous success. The story of the film quickly moves to 1897, when Vivekananda returns to India. The film ends with a long English speech of Vivekananda in which he describes his ideals, objectives of Hinduism and prays for world-peace and fraternity.

== Production ==

=== Background ===
Since 1969 G. V. Iyer made several films on [[Hinduism]] and Hindu religious figures such as ''[[Adi Shankaracharya (film)|Adi Shankaracharya]]'' (1983), ''[[Madhvacharya (film)|Madhavacharya]]'' (1986), ''[[Ramanujacharya (film)|Ramanujacharya]]'' (1989), and ''[[Bhagavad Gita (film)|Bhagavad Gita]]'' (1993). The biopic on Swami Vivekananda was a film in this series which Iyer and Subbarami Reddy (producer of the film) called their "celluloid tribute to the soul of India".&lt;ref name="India Today June 1998"&gt;{{cite news|title=All-pervasive intolerance forces director of Swami Vivekananda to make seminal changes to cast and script of the historical film|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/intolerance-forces-director-of-swami-vivekananda-to-make-seminal-changes-to-cast-and-script-of-historical-film/1/264713.html|accessdate=5 September 2013|newspaper=India Today|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6JOhboqhM?url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/intolerance-forces-director-of-swami-vivekananda-to-make-seminal-changes-to-cast-and-script-of-historical-film/1/264713.html|archivedate=5 September 2013|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This punch line was enough to elicit the attention of the public to watch the movie.&lt;ref name="India Today June 1998" /&gt;

Unlike Iyer's previous films, ''Swami Vivekananda'' was a big-budget and big-banner film. Iyer started his studies and research work in 1986 and it took him 11 years to finish his research work and write the screenplay of the film.&lt;ref name="Four-Hour Vivekananda Film Is a Fleet-Footed Turkey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="India Today 1994"&gt;{{cite news|title=Back to the past Blood and gore sagas give way to revival of gentler period films, TV serials|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/blood-and-gore-sagas-give-way-to-revival-of-gentler-period-films-tv-serials/1/293553.html|accessdate=6 September 2013|newspaper=India Today|date=30 June 1994|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130906090429/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/blood-and-gore-sagas-give-way-to-revival-of-gentler-period-films-tv-serials/1/293553.html|archivedate=6 September 2013|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He commented— "The study of philosophy is the work of a lifetime and I would never want my films to be lacking."&lt;ref name="India Today 1994" /&gt;

=== Casting ===
Sarvadaman D. Banerjee played the role of Vivekananda in this film. Banerjee was a regular actor in Iyer's films and portrayed the role of [[Adi Shankara]] in his film ''Adi Shankaracharya'' (1983) too. Bengali film actor Mithun Chakraborty portrayed Ramakrishna's character. This was his first film with Iyer.&lt;ref name="Four-Hour Vivekananda Film Is a Fleet-Footed Turkey" /&gt; After receiving "Lifetime achievement award" in 2012 Chakraborty told, he tried to follow the teachings of Swami Vivekananda throughout his acting career.&lt;ref name="IBNLive April 2012"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mithun gets lifetime achievement award|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/mithun-gets-lifetime-achievement-award/253514-8-66.html|accessdate=6 September 2013|newspaper=IBNLive|date=30 April 2012|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130906091724/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/mithun-gets-lifetime-achievement-award/253514-8-66.html|archivedate=6 September 2013|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chakraborty cast in the role of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, lends credence to the film by his sterling acting histrionics which earned him the accolade as an "intuitive and mysticalin a tour de force rendering". [[Debashree Roy]] was choiced to play [[Sarada Devi]], the consort of Ramakrishna. [[Debashree Roy|Roy]] told in an interview that the acting in the film as Sarada Devi was a special blessing for her and she felt "strange emotions" during the shooting.&lt;ref name="Acting is entirely an emotional experience'"&gt;{{cite web|title=Acting is entirely an emotional experience'|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/1999/oct/04deba.htm|publisher=Rediff|accessdate=6 September 2013|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130906083934/http://www.rediff.com/movies/1999/oct/04deba.htm|archivedate=6 September 2013|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the lead roles the film has a galaxy of famous stars in different small roles resulting in its production budget touching Rs 30&amp;nbsp;million. [[Hema Malini]] has acted in the role of overdressed [[Kali|Bhavatarini]], [[Rakhee]] is cast as [[Rajasthan]]i tribal woman, [[Jaya Prada]] is in a dancing girl role. Many famous male actors like [[Mammooty]], [[Shammi Kapoor]], [[Shashi Kapoor]] and [[Anupam Kher]] also have small roles.&lt;ref name="India Today June 1998" /&gt;

The soundtracks of the film were composed by [[Salil Chowdhury]], who died soon after the composing was completed. Most of the songs in the film were written by [[Gulzar]]. Songs written by [[Surdas]], [[Kabir]], [[Jayadeva]] were also used in this film. There was one Bengali song in the film— ''[[The Hymn of Samadhi|Nahi Surjo Nahi Jyoti]]''— the song was written by Swami Vivekananda himself in 1897 when he was staying in [[Chennai]] (then known as Madras).&lt;ref name="Swami Vivekananda track listing"&gt;{{cite web|title=Swami Vivekananda track listing|url=http://www.hummaa.com/music/album/swami-vivekananda/9621|publisher=Hummaa|accessdate=6 September 2013|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130906071547/http://www.hummaa.com/music/album/swami-vivekananda/9621|archivedate=6 September 2013|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
The film's theme with complex overtones of religious and political implications generated controversy, even before the film was launched. T. Subbarami Reddy, the producer of the film, wanted to sign [[Naseeruddin Shah]] for the role of Ramakrishna, but they had to drop the idea when few zealots of [[Hindu nationalist]]s of [[Maharashtra]] threatened them and warned that they would not allow the film if a Muslim actor portrays a Hindu [[Brahmin]] in the film. Then the film-makers approached Mithun Chakraborty, a Hindu Brahmin, who agreed to play the character.&lt;ref name="India Today June 1998" /&gt;

Before the release of the film in 1998, [[Ramakrishna Math]] and [[Ramakrishna Mission]] monks alleged that Iyer had distorted Vivekananda and his master Ramakrishna in this film and suggested Iyer to make a number of changes in the film. They alleged that the scenes were not authentic and has little or no similarity with actual events of the Swami's life. In addition, Swami Harshananda, the then President of Ramakrihsna Math, Bangalore, asked the production house to delete their name from the title card since they were not associated with the film. Iyer accepted the suggestions of Ramakrishna Math and Mission authorities and made the requested changes in the film before the release.&lt;ref name="Iyer submits to Ramakrishna Mission to release Vivekananda" /&gt; The Ramakrishna Mission's monks also objected one song sequence as not appropriate as it "showed Swamiji in poor light". As result, the objectionable song sequence was deleted from the film.&lt;ref name="India Today June 1998" /&gt;

According to a news report published in the ''[[Indian Express]]'' on 15 August 1998, Iyer made more or less 20 changes in the film. Later Iyer told, he "surrendered" to the suggestions of the Ramakrishna Math and Mission authority.&lt;ref name="Iyer submits to Ramakrishna Mission to release Vivekananda"&gt;{{cite news|title=Iyer submits to Ramakrishna Mission to release Vivekananda|url=http://expressindia.indianexpress.com/ie/daily/19980815/22750354.html|accessdate=5 September 2013|newspaper=Indian Express|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6JOgV4b4i?url=http://expressindia.indianexpress.com/ie/daily/19980815/22750354.html|archivedate=5 September 2013|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, later in the month, it was cleared for public screening by the [[Delhi High Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =HC clears public screening of Swami Vivekananda |publisher= Rediff| url = http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/aug/19vivek.htm |date=19 August 1998| accessdate = 6 September 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the character of [[Sister Nivedita]], who played a crucial role in Vivekananda's life, was omitted in this film.&lt;ref name="India Today June 1998" /&gt;

== Release ==
The film was released on 12 June 1998. The film was premiered on India's public service broadcaster [[Doordarshan]] on 15 August 1998 as a part of Doordarshan's celebration of 50th year of India's Independence.&lt;ref name="Iyer submits to Ramakrishna Mission to release Vivekananda" /&gt;

== Reception ==
Though not in the same genre of films as produced by [[Satyajit Ray]] or [[Shyam Benegal]], the film is a typical Indian mythological, it has been appreciated for blending the role of "eccentric middle-aged mystic, nominally a Brahmin priest, claiming nothing short of godhood role “ of Paramahmsa very well with that of the “ young non-Brahmin agnostic modernist role"  of Vivekananda.&lt;ref name="India Today June 1998" /&gt;

The film received mixed and mainly negative reviews. S. Kalidas of ''[[India Today]]'' felt that the film had many "warts and weaknesses". He gave positive remarks for Mithun Chakraborty's acting of and wrote— "(the film) is well worth watching for the sheer power of Mithun Chakraborty's performance as Vivekananda's mentor, [[Ramakrishna Paramhansa]], if not for the moving message of its narrative." The reviewer said that Sarvadaman D. Banerjee played the role of Vivekananda with "quite competence."&lt;ref name="India Today June 1998" /&gt;

Choodie Shivaram of ''Hinduism Today'' wrote in his review— "the film runs though like a school textbook without the trademark insightful Iyer interpretations." He found none of the actors' and actresses' acting impressive other than Mithun Chakraborty's. He widely appreciated Mithun Chakraborty's portrayal of Ramakrishna and commented— "The first half of the four-hour film was gripping, especially with Mithun's superlative portrayal of Ramakrisha. The one-time heart throb, disco dancer and martial arts fighter in the role of Ramakrishna held the audience spell bound."&lt;ref name="Four-Hour Vivekananda Film Is a Fleet-Footed Turkey" /&gt;

==Awards==
The film won [[Mithun Chakraborty]] his third [[National Film Award (India)|National Film Award]], this time for [[National Film Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] category.&lt;ref name="43rdawardPDF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dff.nic.in/2011/43rd_nff_1996.pdf|title=43rd National Film Awards|format=PDF|publisher=[[Directorate of Film Festivals]]|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Aesthetic Dimension: Toward a Critique of Marxist Aesthetics''''' ({{lang-de|Die Permanenz der Kunst: Wider eine bestimmte marxistische Ästhetik}}) is a 1977 book on [[aesthetics]] by the philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]], in which the author provides an account of [[modern art]]'s political implications and relationship with society at large.

It is the final major work by Marcuse, a founding member of the [[Frankfurt School]]. The book is also noteworthy as a demarcation of Marcuse's split with [[Marxism]] via his rejection of [[Marxist aesthetics]].

==Summary==
''The Aesthetic Dimension'' (not to be confused with a chapter from Marcuse's ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'' of the same name) is a response to previous writings within [[critical theory]] on the subject of art, notably those of [[Walter Benjamin]] and [[Theodor Adorno]]. Marcuse rejected Benjamin's call in "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]" for the politicization (i.e., a literal reflection of perceived political realities) of modern, reproducible art both to reflect the state of a society and to incite change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC15folder/WalterBenjamin.html|title=Benjamin's '...Age of Mechanical Reproduction'|author=Richard Kazis|publisher=''Jump Cut''|accessdate=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like both Benjamin and Adorno, Marcuse believed that art promises resistance to societal repression, and that a cultural revolution is necessarily connected to a political or social revolution. Adorno (as represented mainly by his posthumous ''[[Aesthetic Theory]]'') and Marcuse agreed that this possibility must be realized through artistic detachment and symbolism.  Marcuse however offered a more inclusive and less radical suggestion for modern art's source of power than did Adorno, who believed that the works of [[high culture]] were the sole artistic source of potential emancipation.

Marcuse instead pointed to what he perceived to be the successes of high culture and translated these to all areas of art. For Marcuse, art's promise of transcendence could only be fulfilled via a conceptual independence from society, but this independence is accessible through a host of media. The successful artist will attain ''truth'' in his work through ''detachment'' that results in ''symbolic representation.'' This successful art must necessarily invoke a longing for something utopian and the promise of ultimate happiness represented by beauty. This symbolic longing for fulfillment will awaken us from complacency.&lt;ref name="questiaschool.com"&gt;http://www.questiaschool.com/read/82289404  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712013858/http://www.questiaschool.com/read/82289404 |date=July 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcuse stated in the book's introduction that he considered [[literature]] the primary source of his influence for this system, but feels that the ideas would apply to [[music]] and [[plastic arts]] as well.&lt;ref name="questiaschool.com"/&gt;

[[File:Friedrich Nietzsche 1872.jpg|thumb|250px|First print 1872]]
'''''The Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of Music''''' ({{lang-de|Die Geburt der Tragödie aus dem Geiste der Musik}}) is an 1872 work of [[dramatic theory]] by the German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. It was reissued in 1886 as ''The Birth of Tragedy, Or: Hellenism and Pessimism'' ({{lang-de|Die Geburt der Tragödie, Oder: Griechentum und Pessimismus}}). The later edition contained a prefatory essay, "[[s:An Attempt at Self-Criticism|An Attempt at Self-Criticism]]", wherein Nietzsche commented on this earliest book.

== The Book ==

Nietzsche found in [[Theater of ancient Greece|classical Athenian]] [[tragedy]] an art form that transcended the [[pessimism]] and [[nihilism]] of a fundamentally meaningless world. The Greek spectators, by looking into the abyss of human suffering and affirming it, passionately and joyously affirmed the meaning of their own existence. They knew themselves to be infinitely more than petty individuals, finding self-affirmation not in another life, not in a world to come, but in the terror and ecstasy alike celebrated in the performance of tragedies.

Originally educated as a [[philology|philologist]], Nietzsche discusses the history of the tragic form and introduces an intellectual [[dichotomy]] between the [[Apollonian and Dionysian|Dionysian and the Apollonian]] (very loosely: reality as disordered and undifferentiated by forms versus reality as ordered and differentiated by forms). Nietzsche claims life always involves a struggle between these two elements, each battling for control over the existence of humanity. In Nietzsche's words, "Wherever the Dionysian prevailed, the Apollonian was checked and destroyed.... wherever the first Dionysian onslaught was successfully withstood, the authority and majesty of the Delphic god [[Apollo]] exhibited itself as more rigid and menacing than ever." Yet neither side ever prevails due to each containing the other in an eternal, natural check or balance.

Nietzsche argues that the tragedy of Ancient Greece was the highest form of art due to its mixture of both Apollonian and Dionysian elements into one seamless whole, allowing the spectator to experience the full spectrum of the [[human condition]]. The Dionysian element was to be found in the music of the [[Greek chorus|chorus]], while the Apollonian element was found in the dialogue which gave a concrete symbolism that balanced the Dionysian revelry. Basically, the Apollonian spirit was able to give form to the abstract Dionysian.

Before the tragedy, there was an era of static, idealized plastic art in the form of sculpture that represented the Apollonian view of the world. The Dionysian element was to be found in the wild revelry of festivals and drunkenness, but, most importantly, in music. The combination of these elements in one art form gave birth to tragedy. He theorizes that the chorus was originally always [[satyr]]s, goat-men. (This is speculative, although the word “tragedy” τραγωδία is contracted from trag(o)-aoidiā = "goat song" from ''tragos'' = "goat" and ''aeidein'' = "to sing".) Thus, he argues, “the illusion of culture was wiped away by the primordial image of man” for the audience; they participated with and as the chorus empathetically, “so that they imagined themselves as restored natural geniuses, as satyrs.” But in this state, they have an Apollonian dream vision of themselves, of the energy they're embodying. It's a vision of the god, of Dionysus, who appears before the chorus on the stage. And the actors and the plot are the development of that dream vision, the essence of which is the ecstatic dismembering of the god and of the [[Bacchante]]s' rituals, of the inseparable ecstasy and suffering of human existence.

After the time of [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]], there was an age where tragedy died.  Nietzsche ties this to the influence of writers like [[Euripides]] and the coming of rationality, represented by [[Socrates]].  Euripides reduced the use of the chorus and was more naturalistic in his representation of human drama, making it more reflective of the realities of daily life. Socrates emphasized reason to such a degree that he diffused the value of myth and suffering to human knowledge. For Nietzsche, these two intellectuals helped drain the ability of the individual to participate in forms of art, because they saw things too soberly and rationally. The ''[[participation mystique]]'' aspect of art and myth was lost, and along with it, much of man's ability to live creatively in [[optimistic]] harmony with the sufferings of life. Nietzsche concludes that it may be possible to reattain the balance of Dionysian and Apollonian in modern art through the operas of [[Richard Wagner]], in a ''rebirth'' of tragedy.

In contrast to the typical [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] view of ancient Greek culture as noble, simple, elegant and grandiose, Nietzsche believed the Greeks were grappling with pessimism. The universe in which we live is the product of great interacting forces; but we neither observe nor know these as such. What we put together as our conceptions of the world, Nietzsche thought, never actually addresses the underlying realities. It is human destiny to be controlled by the darkest universal realities and, at the same time, to live life in a human-dreamt world of illusions.

The issue, then, or so Nietzsche thought, is how to experience and understand the Dionysian side of life without destroying the obvious values of the Apollonian side. It is not healthy for an individual, or for a whole society, to become entirely absorbed in the rule of one or the other. The soundest (healthiest) foothold is in both. Nietzsche's theory of Athenian tragic drama suggests exactly how, before Euripides and Socrates, the Dionysian and Apollonian elements of life were artistically woven together. The Greek spectator became healthy through direct experience of the Dionysian within the protective spirit-of-tragedy on the Apollonian stage.

==History==
In January and February 1870, Nietzsche delivered two lectures about ancient Greek drama. After receiving copies of the lectures, his friends Richard and [[Cosima Wagner]] suggested that he write a book about the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaberg|1995|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1871, he submitted a manuscript to publisher [[Wilhelm Engelmann]]. When Englemann was unresponsive, Nietzsche asked for the return of the manuscript in June. He had a portion of the book [[Vanity press|privately printed]] under the title ''Socrates and Greek Tragedy'' ({{lang-de|Sokrates und griechische Tragödie}}) and sent to friends. Richard Wagner received the first copy on 18 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaberg|1995|pp=20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1871, Nietzsche submitted a revised manuscript to E. W. Fritzsch, who had published works by Wagner. Fritzsch accepted the book in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaberg|1995|pp=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Printing was completed at the end of December, and the book, now titled ''The Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of Music'' ({{lang-de|Die Geburt der Tragödie aus dem Geiste der Musik}}), reached bookstores on 2 January 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaberg|1995|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second edition was printed by Fritzsch in 1874, but due to the publisher's financial problems, it was not bound until 1875 and had little circulation. In 1878, the remaining copies and publication rights for the first two editions were acquired by Nietzsche's new publisher, Ernst Schmeitzner.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaberg|1995|pp=65–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1886, Nietzsche had fallen out with Schmeitzner, and Fritzsch had recovered from his financial difficulties. Fritzsch published a new edition in October 1886, retitled ''The Birth of Tragedy, Or: Hellenism and Pessimism'' ({{lang-de|Die Geburt der Tragödie, Oder: Griechentum und Pessimismus}}), with an added prefatory essay by Nietzsche called "An Attempt at Self-Criticism", commenting on the earlier editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaberg|1995|pp=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==
''The Birth of Tragedy'' is a young man's work, and shows the influence of many of the philosophers Nietzsche had been studying. His interest in classical Greece as in some respects a rational society can be attributed in some measure to the influence of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], although Nietzsche departed from Winckelmann in many ways.  In addition, Nietzsche uses the term "naïve" in exactly the sense used by [[Friedrich Schiller]]. Of great importance are the works of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], especially ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]''. The Apollonian experience bears great similarity to the experience of the world as "representation" in Schopenhauer's sense, and the experience of the Dionysian bears similarities to the identification with the world as "will." Nietzsche opposed Schopenhauer's Buddhistic negation of the will. He argued that life is worth living despite the enormous amount of cruelty and suffering that exists.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

One year before the publication of ‘’The Birth of Tragedy’’, Nietzsche wrote a fragment titled [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ljp2NPK0qPAC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=nietzsche+%2B+%22what+we+here+have+asserted%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vxdZT8bsHc6I0QGJt_DRDw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false On Music and Words]. In it he asserted the Schopenhauerian judgment that  music is a primary expression of the essence of everything.  Secondarily derivative are lyrical poetry and drama, which represent mere phenomenal appearances of objects. In this way, tragedy is born from music.

== Reception ==
''The Birth of Tragedy'' was angrily criticized by many respected professional scholars of Greek literature. Particularly vehement was philologist [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]], who denounced Nietzsche's work as slipshod and misleading. Prompted by Nietzsche, [[Erwin Rohde]]—a friend who had written a favorable review that sparked the first derogatory debate over the book—responded by exposing Wilamowitz-Moellendorf's inaccurate citations of Nietzsche's work. [[Richard Wagner]] also issued a response to Wilamowitz-Moellendorf's critique, but his action only served to characterize Nietzsche as the composer's lackey.

In his denunciation of ''The Birth of Tragedy'', Wilamowitz says:

:Herr N. ... is also a professor of classical philology; he treats a series of very important questions of Greek literary history. ... This is what I want to illuminate, and it is easy to prove that here also imaginary genius and impudence in the presentation of his claims stands in direct relation to his ignorance and lack of love of the truth. ... His solution is to belittle the historical-critical method, to scold any aesthetic insight which deviates from his own, and to ascribe a "complete misunderstanding of the study of antiquity" to the age in which philology in Germany, especially through the work of [[Gottfried Hermann]] and [[Karl Lachmann]], was raised to an unprecedented height.

In suggesting the Greeks might have had problems, Nietzsche was departing from the scholarly traditions of his age, which viewed the Greeks as a happy, perhaps even naive, and simple people. The work is a web of professional [[philology]], philosophical insight, and admiration of musical art. As a work in philology, it was almost immediately rejected, virtually destroying Nietzsche's academic aspirations. The music theme was so closely associated with Richard Wagner that it became an embarrassment to Nietzsche once he himself had achieved some distance and independence from Wagner. It stands, then, as Nietzsche's first complete, published philosophical work, one in which a battery of questions are asked, sketchily identified, and questionably answered.

Marianne Cowan, in her introduction to Nietzsche's ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]'', describes the situation in these words:
:''The Birth of Tragedy'' presented a view of the Greeks so alien to the spirit of the time and to the ideals of its scholarship that it blighted Nietzsche's entire academic career.  It provoked pamphlets and counter-pamphlets attacking him on the grounds of common sense, scholarship and sanity. For a time, Nietzsche, then a professor of classical philology at the [[University of Basel]], had no students in his field.  His lectures were sabotaged by German philosophy professors who advised their students not to show up for Nietzsche's courses.

By 1886, Nietzsche himself had reservations about the work, and he published a preface in the 1886 edition where he re-evaluated some of his main concerns and ideas in the text. In this post-script, Nietzsche referred to ''The Birth of Tragedy'' as "an impossible book... badly written, ponderous, embarrassing, image-mad and image-confused, sentimental, saccharine to the point of effeminacy, uneven in tempo, [and] without the will to logical cleanliness."&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, he defended the "arrogant and rhapsodic book" for inspiring "fellow-rhapsodizers" and for luring them on to "new secret paths and dancing places."

In 1888, in ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'', Nietzsche was back on the attack. He defends ''The Birth of Tragedy'' by stating: "...It is indifferent toward politics,—'un-German,' to use the language of the present time—it smells offensively Hegelian, and the cadaverous perfume of Schopenhauer sticks only to a few formulas. An 'idea'—the antithesis of the Dionysian and the Apollinian—translated into the metaphysical; history itself as the development of this 'idea'; in tragedy this antithesis is sublimated into a unity; under this perspective things that had never before faced each other are suddenly juxtaposed, used to illuminate each other, and comprehended... Opera, for example, and the revolution.— The two decisive innovations of the book are, first, its understanding of the Dionysian phenomenon among the Greeks: for the first time, a psychological analysis of this phenomenon is offered, and it is considered as one root of the whole of Greek art. The other is the understanding of Socratism: Socrates is recognized for the first time as an instrument of Greek disintegration, as a typical décadent. 'Rationality' against instinct. 'Rationality' at any price as a dangerous force that undermines life!— Profound, hostile silence about Christianity throughout the book. That is neither Apollinian nor Dionysian; it negates all aesthetic values—the only values that the 'Birth of Tragedy' recognizes: it is nihilistic in the most profound sense, while in the Dionysian symbol the ultimate limit of affirmation is attained. There is one allusion [The Birth of Tragedy, 24] to Christian priests as a 'vicious kind of dwarfs' who are 'subterranean' ..."

In the title of his novel ''[[The Magic Mountain]]'', [[Thomas Mann]] alludes to a passage from ''The Birth of Tragedy'', and the influence of Nietzsche's work can be seen in the novel's character Mynheer Peepercorn, who embodies the "Dionysian principle."&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich, ''The Birth of Tragedy'' (Trans. Douglas Smith), Oxford University Press, 2008: pp. xxxii, 28, 109, 140. {{ISBN|978-0-19-954014-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the context of a critical study of Nietzsche's "atheist humanism", the influential Catholic theologian [[Henri de Lubac]] considered it "a work of genius", and dedicated several pages of his study to explicate the relationship between Nietzsche's early thought and Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;De Lubac, Henri, ''The Drama of Atheist Humanism'', Ignatius Press (San Francisco), 2008: pp. 74, 82. For De Lubac's full discussion of this early work of Nietzsche, see ''id''., pp. 73–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Thought and Action''''' is a 1959 book by the philosopher [[Stuart Hampshire]].&lt;ref name="Downie"&gt;[[#Dow05|Downie 2005]]. p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt; The book has received praise from commentators, and is considered Hampshire's major work.&lt;ref name="Downie" /&gt;

==Summary==
Hampshire develops in greater detail ideas about freedom and the [[philosophy of mind]] that he had already explored in his ''[[Spinoza (book)|Spinoza]]'' (1951). He examines a set of contrasts between that which is unavoidable in human thought and that which is contingent, between knowledge and decision, criticism and practice, philosophy and experience.&lt;ref name="Downie" /&gt; He argues that [[Empiricism|empiricist]] theories of perception descending from [[George Berkeley]] and [[David Hume]] mistakenly represent people as passive observers receiving impressions from "outside" of the mind, where the "outside" includes their own bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ham59|Hampshire 1959]]. p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The historian [[Peter Gay]] wrote that ''Thought and Action'' is a "brilliant" and "lucid" contribution to the philosophy of action, and a subtle vindication of [[free will]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gay76|Gay 1976]]. p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Roger Scruton]], writing in ''[[Sexual Desire (book)|Sexual Desire]]'' (1986), credited Hampshire with providing a seminal discussion of two contrasting outlooks on the future that can be called "predicting and deciding."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scr94|Scruton 1994]]. p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Anthony Quinton, Baron Quinton|Anthony Quinton]] wrote that Hampshire's "systematic aim and fine mandarin prose were both unusual for an Oxford philosopher of the time."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Qui05|Quinton 2005]]. p. 546.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36481">The '''United States biological defense program'''—in recent years also called the '''National Biodefense Strategy'''—began as a small defensive effort that paralleled the country's [[United States biological weapons program|offensive biological weapons development and production program]], active between 1943 and 1969. Organizationally, the medical defense research effort was pursued first (1956-1969) by the [[U.S. Army Medical Unit]] (USAMU) and later, after the discontinuation of the offensive program, by the [[U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]] (USAMRIID). Both of these units were located at [[Fort Detrick]], [[Maryland]], where the [[United States Army Biological Warfare Laboratories|U.S. Army Biological Warfare Laboratories]] were headquartered.  The current mission is multi-agency, not exclusively military, and is purely to develop defensive measures against [[bio-agents]], as opposed to the former bio-weapons development program.

In 1951, due to biological warfare concerns arising from the [[Korean War]], the US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) created the [[Epidemic Intelligence Service]] (EIS), a hands-on two-year postgraduate training program in epidemiology, with a focus on field work.

Since the [[2001 anthrax attacks]], and the consequent expansion of federal [[bio-defense]] expenditures, USAMRIID has been joined at Fort Detrick by sister bio-defense agencies of the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] ([[NIAID]]'s [[Integrated Research Facility]]) and the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] (the [[National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center]] and the [[National Bioforensic Analysis Center]]). These—along with the much older [[Foreign Disease Weed Science Research Unit]] of the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]]—now constitute the [[National Interagency Confederation for Biological Research]] (NICBR).

Broadly defined, the "United States biological defense program" now also encompasses all federal level programs and efforts to monitor, prevent, and contain naturally occurring infectious disease outbreaks of widespread public health concern. These include efforts to forestall large scale disasters&lt;ref&gt;Mordini E. (2016) The Biodefense Field. Bioethics, Volume 30, Issue 6, pages 382–383&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[flu pandemics]] and other "[[emerging infection]]s" such as novel pathogens or those imported from other countries. Today, these U.S. [[biodefense]] programs—military and civilian—have raised concerns that the U.S. may be pursuing research that is outlawed by the [[Biological Weapons Convention]] (BWC) of 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[[Milton Leitenberg|Leitenberg, Milton]] (2005), ''[http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub639.pdf Assessing the Biological Weapons and Bioterrorism Threat]'', pg 68. [n.p., but USG/public domain]; {{ISBN|9781495965951}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[Biological agent]]s have been used in warfare for centuries to produce death or disease in humans, animals, or plants. The United States officially began its [[biological warfare]] offensive program in 1941. During the next 28 years, the U.S. initiative evolved into an effective, military-driven research and acquisition program, shrouded in secrecy and, later, controversy. Most research and development was done at [[Fort Detrick]], [[Maryland]], while production and testing of bio-weapons occurred at [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]], and [[Dugway Proving Ground]] (DPG), [[Utah]]. Field testing was done secretly and successfully with simulants and actual agents disseminated over wide areas. A small defensive effort always paralleled the weapons development and production program. With the presidential decision in 1969 to halt offensive biological weapons production—and the agreement in 1972 at the international BWC never to develop, produce, stockpile, or retain biological agents or toxins—the program became entirely defensive, with medical and non-medical components. The U.S. biological defense research program exists today, conducting research to develop physical and medical countermeasures to protect service members and civilians from the threat of modern biological warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Franz,  David R., Cheryl D. Parrott, and Ernest T. Takafuji (1997), Chapter 19: “The U.S. Biological Warfare and Biological Defense Programs", In: Frederick R. Sidell, Ernest T. Takafuji, David R. Franz (editors), ''Medical Aspects of Chemical and Biological Warfare'' (1997); Published by the Office of The Surgeon General at TMM Publications, [[The Borden Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the U.S. bio-weapons ban and the BWC restricted any work in the area of biological warfare to defensive in nature. In reality, this gives BWC member-states wide latitude to conduct biological weapons research because the BWC contains no provisions for monitoring of enforcement.&lt;ref name=littlewood/&gt;&lt;ref name=cirincione2&gt;[[Joseph Cirincione]], et al. ''Deadly Arsenals'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty, essentially, is a gentlemen's agreement amongst members backed by the long-prevailing thought that biological warfare should not be used in battle.&lt;ref name=littlewood&gt;Littlewood, Jez. ''The Biological Weapons Convention: A Failed Revolution'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=B-xjnmd7hN0C&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=Biological+weapons+convention+enforcment&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a Google Books]), Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2005, p. 9, ({{ISBN|0754638545}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years certain critics have claimed the U.S. stance on biological warfare and the use of biological agents has differed from historical interpretations of the BWC.&lt;ref name=fas1&gt;"[http://www.fas.org/programs/ssp/bio/resource/introtobw.html Introduction to Biological Weapons]", ''[[Federation of American Scientists]]'', official site. Retrieved January 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it is said that the U.S. now maintains that the Article I of the BWC (which explicitly bans bio-weapons), does not apply to "non-lethal" biological agents.&lt;ref name=fas1/&gt; Previous interpretation was stated to be in line with a definition laid out in Public Law 101-298, the [[Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989]].&lt;ref name=fas2&gt;"[http://www.fas.org/biosecurity/resource/orig%20interpretation.htm Original U.S. Interpretation of the BWC]", ([http://www.fas.org/biosecurity/resource/documents/original%20us%20interpretation%20bwc.pdf PDF]),''[[Federation of American Scientists]]'', official site. Retrieved January 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; That law defined a biological agent as:&lt;ref name=fas2/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;any micro-organism, virus, infectious substance, or biological product that may be engineered as a result of biotechnology, or any naturally occurring or bio-engineered component of any such microorganism, virus, infectious substance, or biological product, capable of causing death, disease, or other biological malfunction in a human, an animal, a plant, or another living organism; deterioration of food, water, equipment, supplies, or material of any kind...&lt;/blockquote&gt; According to the [[Federation of American Scientists]], U.S. work on non-lethal agents exceeds limitations in the BWC.&lt;ref name=fas1/&gt;

==History==

===1950s===
After [[World War II]], and with the onset of [[Cold War]] tensions, the US continued its clandestine wartime bio-weapons program. The Korean War (1950–53) added justification for continuing the program, when the possible entry of the Soviet Union into the war was feared. Concerns over the Soviet Union were justified, for the Soviet Union would pronounce in 1956 that chemical and biological weapons would, indeed, be used for mass destruction in future wars.&lt;ref&gt;Geissler E, ed. Biological and Toxin Weapons Today (Stockholm International Peace Research Institute). Oxford, England: Oxford University Press; 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1950, the [[US Secretary of Defense]] approved continuation of the program, based largely on the Soviet threat and a belief that the North Korean and Chinese communists would use biological weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Harris R, Paxman J. A Higher Form of Killing: The Secret of Chemical and Biological Warfare. New York, NY: Hill and Wang; 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; With expansion of the biological warfare retaliatory program, the scope of the defensive program was nearly doubled. Data were obtained on personnel protection, decontamination, and immunization. Early detection research produced prototype alarms for use on the battlefield, but progress was slow, apparently limited by technology.&lt;ref name="Franz, Op. cit."&gt;Franz, ''Op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Army Medical Unit, under the direction of The U.S. Army Surgeon General, began formal operations in 1956. One of the Unit’s first missions was to manage all aspects of Project CD-22, the exposure of volunteers to aerosols containing a pathogenic strain of ''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'', the etiologic agent of [[Q fever]]. The volunteers were closely monitored and [[antibiotic therapy]] was administered when appropriate. All volunteers recovered from Q fever with no adverse aftereffects. One year later, the Unit submitted to the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] an [[Investigational New Drug]] application for a Q fever vaccine.

===1960s===
In the following decade, the US accumulated significant data on personnel protection, decontamination, and immunization; and, in the offensive program, on the potential for mosquitoes to be used as biological vectors. A new Department of Defense (DoD) [[Biological and Chemical Defense Planning Board]] was created in 1960 to establish program priorities and objectives. Preventive approaches toward infections of all kinds were funded under the auspices of biological warfare. As concern increased over the biological warfare threat during the Cold War, so did the budget for the program: to $38 million by fiscal year 1966.

The [[U.S. Army Chemical Corps]] was given the responsibility to conduct biological warfare research for all of the services.&lt;ref&gt;Department of the Army. Special Report to Congress. US Army Activity in the US Biological Warfare Programs,1942–1977. Vols 1 and 2. Washington, DC: DA. 24 Feb 1977. Unclassified.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, the responsibility for the testing of promising biological warfare agents was given to a separate [[Testing and Evaluation Command]] (TEC). Depending on the particular program, different test centers were used, such as the [[Deseret Test Center]] at [[Fort Douglas, Utah]], the headquarters for the new biological and chemical warfare testing organization. In response to increasing concerns over public safety and the environment, the TEC implemented a complex system of approval of its research programs that included the [[U.S. Army Chief of Staff]], the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], the Secretary of Defense, and the President of the United States.

During the last 10 years of the offensive research and development program (1959–69), many scientific advances were made that proved that biological warfare was clearly feasible, although dependent on careful planning, especially with regard to meteorological conditions. Large-scale fermentation, purification, concentration, stabilization, drying, and weaponization of pathogenic microorganisms could be done safely. Furthermore, modern principles of biosafety and containment were established at the Fort Detrick laboratories which have greatly facilitated biomedical research in general; still today, these are followed throughout the world. [[Arnold G. Wedum]], M.D., Ph.D., a civilian scientist who was Director of Industrial Health and Safety at Fort Detrick, was the leader in the development of containment facilities.&lt;ref name="Franz, Op. cit."/&gt;

During the 1960s, the US program underwent a philosophical change, and attention was now directed more towards biological agents that could incapacitate, but not kill. In 1964, research programs involved [[staphylococcal enterotoxin]]s capable of causing [[food poisoning]]. Research initiatives also included new therapy and prophylaxis. Pathogens studied included the agents causing [[anthrax]], [[glanders]], [[brucellosis]], [[melioidosis]], [[Yersinia pestis|plague]], [[psittacosis]], [[Venezuelan equine encephalitis]], [[Q fever]], [[coccidioidomycosis]], and a variety of plant and animal pathogens&lt;ref name="Harris, Op. cit."&gt;Harris, ''Op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). "The Rise of CB Weapons", Vol 1. In: ''The Problem of Chemical
and Biological Warfare''. New York, NY: Humanities Press; 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

Particular attention was directed at chemical and biological detectors during the 1960s. The first devices were primitive field alarms to detect chemicals. Although the development of sensitive biological warfare agent detectors was at a standstill, two systems were, nonetheless, investigated. The first was a monitor that detected increases in the number of particles sized 1 to 5&amp;nbsp;µm in diameter, based on the assumption that a biological agent attack would include airborne particles of this size. The second system involved the selective staining of particles collected from the air. Both systems lacked enough specificity and sensitivity to be of any practical use.&lt;ref&gt;[[Seymour Hersh|Hersh SM]]. ''Chemical and Biological Warfare: America’s Hidden Arsenal''. Indianapolis, Ind: Bobbs-Merrill; 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

But in 1966, a research effort directed at detecting the presence of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (a chemical found only in living organisms) was begun. By using a fluorescent material found in [[fireflies]], preliminary studies indicated that it was possible to detect the presence of a biological agent in the atmosphere. The important effort to find a satisfactory detection system continues today, for timely detection of a biological attack would allow the attacked force to use its protective masks effectively, and identification of the agent would allow any pre-treatment regimens to be instituted. The US Army also experimented with and developed highly effective barrier protective measures against both chemical and biological agents. Special impervious tents and personal protective equipment were developed, including individual gas masks even for military dogs.&lt;ref name="Franz, Op. cit."/&gt;

During the late 1960s, funding for the biological warfare program decreased temporarily, to accommodate the accelerating costs of the [[Vietnam War]]. The budget for fiscal year 1969 was $31 million, decreasing to $11.8 million by fiscal year 1973. Although the offensive program had been stopped in 1969, both offensive and defensive programs continued to be defended. [[John S. Foster, Jr]], Director of Defense Research and Engineering, responded to a query by Congressman [[Richard D. McCarthy]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the policy of the U.S. to develop and maintain a defensive chemical-biological (CB) capability so that our military forces could operate for some period of time in a toxic environment, if necessary; to develop and maintain a limited offensive capability in order to deter all use of CB weapons by the threat of retaliation in kind; and to continue a program of research and development in this area to minimize the possibility of technological surprise.&lt;ref&gt;Foster JS, Director of Defense Research and Engineering, US Department of Defense. Letter dated 15 April 1965 to Honorable Richard D. McCarthy, US House of Representatives. Cited in: McCarthy RD. The Ultimate Folly: War by Pestilence, Asphyxiation, and Defoliation. New York, NY: Alfred A. Knopf; 1969: 153–154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 25 November 1969, President [[Richard Nixon]] visited Fort Detrick to announce a new policy on biological warfare. In two National Security Memoranda,&lt;ref&gt;Kissinger HA. N.S. Decision Memorandum 35. 25 November 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kissinger HA. N.S. Decision Memorandum 44. 20 February 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. government renounced all development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons and declared its intent to maintain only small research quantities of biological agents, such as are necessary for the development of vaccines, drugs, and diagnostics.

Ground was broken in 1967 for construction of a new, modern laboratory building at Fort Detrick. The building would open in phases during 1971 and 1972. With the disestablishment of the biological warfare laboratories, the name of the U.S. Army Medical Unit, which was to have been housed in the new laboratories, was formally changed to U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) in 1969. The institute’s new mission was stated in General Order 137, 10 November 1971 (since superseded):&lt;blockquote&gt;Conducts studies related to medical defensive aspects of biological agents of military importance and develops appropriate biological protective measures, diagnostic procedures and therapeutic methods.&lt;ref&gt;Department of the Army. General Order 137. Washington, DC: Headquarters, DA; 10 November 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The emphasis now shifted away from offensive weapons to development of vaccines, diagnostic systems, personal protection, chemoprophylaxis, and rapid detection systems.

===1970s===
After Nixon declared an end to the U.S. bio-weapons program, debate in the Army centered around whether or not toxin weapons were included in the president's declaration.&lt;ref&gt;Mauroni, Albert J. ''America's Struggle with Chemical-Biological Weapons'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=TiSL-7ghCWwC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=nixon+biological+weapons+ban&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA49,M1 Google Books]), Greenwood Publishing Group, 2000, p. 49-60, ({{ISBN|0275967565}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Following Nixon's November 1969 order, scientists at [[Fort Detrick]] worked on one toxin, [[Staphylococcus|''Staphylococcus'' enterotoxin type B]] (SEB), for several more months.&lt;ref&gt;Mauroni, ''Op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon ended the debate when he added toxins to the bio-weapons ban in February 1970&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeanne Guillemin|Guillemin, Jeanne]]. ''Biological Weapons: From the Invention of State-sponsored Programs to Contemporary Bioterrorism'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=G35q8W4BGTYC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=nixon+biological+weapons+ban&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA123,M1 Google Books]), Columbia University Press, 2005, pp.&amp;nbsp;122–27 and p.&amp;nbsp;63, ({{ISBN|0231129424}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Nixon’s 1969 decision, all antipersonnel biological warfare stocks were destroyed between 10 May 1971 and 1 May 1972. The laboratory at Pine Bluff Arsenal, Arkansas, was converted to a toxicological research laboratory, and was no longer under the direction or control of the DoD. Biological anticrop agents were destroyed by February 1973. Biological warfare demilitarization continued through the 1970s, with input provided by the [[U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare]]; [[U.S. Department of the Interior]]; [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]]; and the [[Environmental Protection Agency]]. Fort Detrick and other installations involved in the biological warfare program took on new identities, and their missions were changed to biological defense and the development of medical countermeasures. The necessary containment capability, [[Biosafety Level]]s 3 and 4 (BSL-3 and BSL-4) continued to be maintained at USAMRIID.&lt;ref name="Franz, Op. cit."/&gt;

===1980s===
In 1984, the DoD requested funds for the construction of another biological aerosol test facility in Utah. The proposal submitted by the army called for BSL-4 containment, although maintaining that the BSL-4 inclusion was based on a possible need in the future and not on a current research effort. The proposal was not well received in Utah, where many citizens and government officials still recalled the secretive projects of the military: the areas on DPG still contaminated with anthrax spores, and the well-publicized accidental chemical [[Dugway sheep incident|poisoning of a flock of sheep]] in [[Skull Valley, Utah]], in March 1968.&lt;ref name="Harris, Op. cit."/&gt; Questions arose over the safety of the employees and the surrounding communities, and a suggestion was even made to shift all biological defense research to a civilian agency, such as the [[National Institutes of Health]]. The plan for a new facility was revised to utilize a BSL-3 facility, but not before the [[US Congress]] had instituted more surveillance, reporting, and control measures on the army to ensure compliance with the BWC.&lt;ref name="Franz, Op. cit."/&gt;

===1990s===
In the 1990s, the US medical biological defense research effort (part of the U.S. Army’s Biological Defense Research Program [BDRP]) was concentrated at USAMRIID at Fort Detrick. The army maintained state-of-the-art containment laboratory facilities there, with more than 10,000 ft2 of BSL-4 and 50,000 ft2 of BSL-3 laboratory space. BSL-4, the highest containment level, included laboratory suites that are isolated by internal walls and protected by rigorous entry restrictions, air-locks, negative-pressure air-handling systems, and filtration of all out-flow air through high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters. Workers in BSL-4 laboratories also wore filtered [[positive-pressure total body suits]], which isolated the workers from the internal air of the laboratory. BSL-3 laboratories had a similar design, but do not require that personnel wear positive-pressure suits. Workers in BSL-3 suites were protected immunologically by vaccines. U.S. governmental standards provided guidance as to which organisms might be handled under various containment levels in laboratories such as USAMRIID.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ''Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories.'' 3rd ed. Washington, DC: US Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. May 1993. HHS Publication (CDC) 93-8395.&lt;/ref&gt;

The unique facilities available at USAMRIID also included a 16-bed clinical research ward capable of BSL-3 containment, and a 2-bed patient care isolation suite—the Medical Containment Suite (MCS), known as “The Slammer”—where ICU-level care could be provided under BSL-4 containment. Here, healthcare personnel wore the same positive-pressure suits as are worn in BSL-4 research laboratories. The level of patient isolation required depended on the infecting organism and the risk to healthcare providers. Patient care can be provided at BSL-4. There were no patient-care category analogous to BSL-3; humans who are ill as a result of exposure to BSL-3 agents were to be cared for in an ordinary hospital room with barrier nursing procedures.&lt;ref name="Franz, Op. cit."/&gt;

USAMRIID guidelines were prepared to determine which level of containment would be employed for individual patients who required BSL-4 isolation or barrier nursing care. Staff augmentation for BSL-4 critical care expertise came from the [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]] (WRAMC), Washington, D.C., in accordance with a [[memorandum of agreement]] between the two institutions. Patients could be brought directly into the BSL-4 suite from the outside through specialized ports with unique patient-isolation equipment. (The MCS was decommissioned and discontinued in December 2010.)

Additionally, starting in the 1970s USAMRIID maintained a unique evacuation capability known as the [[Aeromedical Isolation Team]] (AIT). Led by a physician and a registered nurse, each of the two teams consisted of eight volunteers who trained intensively to provide an evacuation capability for casualties suspected of being infected with highly transmissible, life-threatening BSL-4 infectious diseases (e.g., hemorrhagic fever viruses). The unit used special adult-sized Vickers isolation units (Vickers Medical Containment Stretcher Transit Isolator). These units were aircraft transportable and isolated a patient placed inside from the external environment. The AIT could transport two patients simultaneously; obviously, this was not designed for a mass casualty situation. During the [[1995 outbreak of Ebola fever in Zaire]], the AIT remained on alert to evacuate any US citizens who might have become ill while working to control the disease in that country.&lt;ref name="Franz, Op. cit."/&gt;

During this period, some biological defense research also continued at the [[U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense]], [[Edgewood Arsenal]], Maryland, and the [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]] (WRAIR), Washington, D.C. USAMRIID and these sister laboratories conducted basic research in support of the medical component of the US biological defense research program, which developed strategies, products, information, procedures, and training for medical defense against biological warfare agents. The products included diagnostic reagents and procedures, drugs, vaccines, toxoids, and antitoxins. Emphasis is placed on protecting personnel before any potential exposure to the biological agent occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Huxsoll DL, Parrott CD, Patrick WC III. "Medicine in defense against biological warfare". ''JAMA''. 1989;265:677–679.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, [[United States law]] formally defined weaponizable bio-agents as "Biological Select Agents or Toxins" (BSATs) — or simply [[Select Agents]] for short&lt;ref&gt;''Additional Requirements for Facilities Transferring or Receiving Select Agents'', Title 42 CFR Part 72 and Appendix A; 15 April 1997 (DHHS).&lt;/ref&gt; — which fall under the oversight of either the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] or the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (or both) and which have the "potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety".

In 1998, several DoD organizations consolidated to create the [[Defense Threat Reduction Agency]] (DTRA), headquartered in [[Fort Belvoir, Virginia]]. This agency is DOD's official Combat Support Agency for countering [[weapons of mass destruction]], including bio-agents. DTRA's main functions are threat reduction, threat control, combat support, and technology development. In the US national interest, DTRA supports projects at more than 14 locations around the world, including Russia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Georgia, and Ukraine.

In 1999, a "National Pharmaceutical Stockpile" — renamed [[Strategic National Stockpile]] in 2002 — was created under the oversight of DHHS. In the same year, the [[Laboratory Response Network]] — a collaborative effort within the US federal government involving the [[Association of Public Health Laboratories]] and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] — was established to facilitate the confirmatory diagnosis and typing of possible bio-agents. Also in 1999, President [[Bill Clinton]] issued [[Executive Order 13139]], which provided for experimental anti-WMD drugs to be given to service members at the discretion of the Secretary of Defense only under [[informed consent]]; only the President may waive the necessity for informed consent.

===2000s===
Three secret DoD projects involving countermeasures against anthrax – code named [[Project Bacchus]], [[Project Clear Vision]] and [[Project Jefferson]] – were publicly disclosed by ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2001. (The projects were undertaken between 1997 and 2000 and focused on the concern that the old [[Soviet biological weapons program|Soviet BW program]] was secretly continuing and had developed a genetically modified anthrax weapon.)&lt;ref&gt;[[Judith Miller (journalist)|Miller, Judith]], Engelberg, Stephen and [[William J. Broad|Broad, William J.]] ''Germs: Biological Weapons and America's Secret War'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=RBb8ss3GG1MC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=nixon+biological+weapons+ban&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA63,M1 Google Books]), Simon and Schuster, 2002, ({{ISBN|0684871599}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[September 11 attacks]] and the [[2001 anthrax attacks]], the US government has allocated nearly $50 billion to address the threat of biological weapons. Funding for bioweapons-related activities focuses primarily on research for and acquisition of medicines for defense. Biodefense funding also goes toward stockpiling protective equipment, increased surveillance and detection of bio-agents, and improving state and hospital preparedness. Significant funding goes to BARDA ([[Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority]]), part of DHHS. Funding for activities aimed at prevention has more than doubled since 2007 and is distributed among 11 federal agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armscontrolcenter.org/policy/biochem/articles/fy09_biodefense_funding/ Federal Funding for Bioweapons Prevention and Defense, by Agency, 2001-2009]&lt;/ref&gt;  Efforts toward cooperative international action are part of the project.

A "Select Agent Program" (SAP) was established to satisfy requirements of the [[USA PATRIOT Act|USA PATRIOT Act of 2001]] and the [[Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness Response Act|Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002]]. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] administers the SAP, which regulates the laboratories that may possess, use, or transfer Select Agents within the United States. The [[Project Bioshield Act]] was passed by Congress in [[2004 in the United States|2004]] calling for $5 billion for purchasing vaccines that would be used in the event of a [[bioterrorism|bioterrorist]] attack. According to President [[George W. Bush]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;Project BioShield will transform our ability to defend the nation in three essential ways. First, Project BioShield authorizes $5.6 billion over 10 years for the government to purchase and stockpile vaccines and drugs to fight anthrax, smallpox and other potential agents of bioterror. The DHHS has already taken steps to purchase 75 million doses of an improved anthrax vaccine for the [[Strategic National Stockpile]]. Under Project BioShield, HHS is moving forward with plans to acquire a safer, second generation smallpox vaccine, an antidote to botulinum toxin, and better treatments for exposure to chemical and radiological weapons.

Since 2007, USAMRIID has been joined at Fort Detrick by sister bio-defense agencies of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (NIAID’s Integrated Research Facility) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (the [[National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center]] and the [[National Bioforensic Analysis Center]]). These—along with the much older [[Foreign Disease Weed Science Research Unit]] of the U.S. Department of Agriculture—now constitute the [[National Interagency Confederation for Biological Research]] (NICBR).

===2010s===
{{expand section|date=June 2014}}

In July 2012, the [[White House]] issued its guiding document on the ''[[National Biosurveillance Strategy]]''.

==Current status==
{{update|date=February 2013}}
{{advert|section|date=May 2014}}
Since biological warfare agents are often etiologic agents for naturally occurring diseases, the current{{when|date=May 2014}} military bio-defense research effort provides substantive benefits for civilian populations as well. Products currently being produced or under development through military research include:

*Vaccines to prevent tularemia, Q fever, Rift Valley fever, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, Eastern and Western equine encephalitis, chikungunya fever, Argentine hemorrhagic fever, the botulinum toxicoses, and anthrax;&lt;ref&gt;Huxsoll, Op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Takafuji ET, Russell PK. "Military immunizations: Past, present and future prospects". ''Infect Dis Clin North Am.''
1990;4:143–157.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Antitoxins for diseases such as botulism; 
*Human immune globulin preparations (passive antibody protection) against various bacteria and viruses; and 
*Antiviral drugs against multiple viral agents.

Some vaccines also have applicability for diseases of domestic animals (e.g., Rift Valley fever and Venezuelan equine encephalitis). In addition, vaccines are provided to persons who may be occupationally exposed to such agents (e.g., laboratory workers, entomologists, and veterinary personnel) throughout government, industry, and academe.&lt;ref name="Franz, Op. cit."/&gt;

USAMRIID also provides diagnostic and epidemiological support to federal, state, and local agencies and foreign governments. Examples of assistance rendered to civilian health efforts by the [[U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command]] (USAMRMC) include:

*The massive immunization program instituted during the Venezuelan equine encephalitis outbreak in the Americas in 1971; 
*The laboratory support provided to the U.S. Public Health Service during the outbreak of Legionnaire’s disease in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1976; 
*The management of patients suspected of having African viral hemorrhagic fever in Sweden during the 1980s; 
*International support during the outbreak of Rift Valley fever in Mauritania in 1989; 
*Assistance with the outbreak of Ebola infections among monkeys imported to Reston, Virginia, in 1990; and 
*Epidemiological and diagnostic support to the World Health Organization–Centers for Disease Control and Prevention field team that studied the Ebola outbreak in Zaire in 1995.

The current{{when|date=May 2014}} research effort combines new technological advances, such as genetic engineering and molecular modeling, applying them toward development of prevention and treatment of diseases of military significance. The program is conducted in compliance with requirements set forth by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Public Health Service, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and Biological Weapons Convention.&lt;ref&gt;Huxsoll, ''Op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the US stopped all offensive biological warfare research in 1969, US officials {{who|date=May 2014}} have continued to believe that its biological defense research program must remain strong in view of:

*Evidence that some countries are not complying with the Biological Weapons Convention;{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} 
*The difficulty of verifying compliance with the Convention; {{OR|date=May 2014}}
*The potential use of biological warfare by terrorists; {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}
*The increased possibility of new threat agents based on advances in biotechnology;{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} and 
*The belief that a strong defense serves as a deterrent.{{OR|date=May 2014}}

While some of the military’s biological defense programs remain classified, based on worldwide threats and uncertainties, the medical biological defense research program is unclassified and is widely considered to be an invaluable resource for the country.&lt;ref name="Franz, Op. cit."/&gt;

In [[philosophy]], '''vagueness''' refers to an important problem in [[semantics]], [[metaphysics]] and [[philosophical logic]]. Definitions of this problem vary. A predicate is sometimes said to be vague if the bound of its extension is indeterminate, or appears to be so. The predicate "is tall" is vague because there seems to be no particular height at which someone becomes tall. Relatedly, a predicate is sometimes said to be vague if there are borderline cases of its application, such that in these cases competent speakers of the language may faultlessly disagree over whether the predicate applies. The disagreement over whether a hotdog is a sandwich suggests that “sandwich” is vague. 

Vagueness is commonly introduced by the Sorites paradox. A standard form of this paradox features a 2000 man sequence of progressively taller men, starting with a paradigm case of a short man at one extreme, say George Costanza, and at the other extreme, a paradigm case of a tall one, say Kramer. 

* Base step: Man 1 (George Costanza) is short.
* Induction step: If man ''n'' is short, then man ''n + 1'' is short.
* Conclusion: Man 2000 (Kramer) is short. 

Sorites paradoxes exploit the intuition that some vague predicates are ''tolerant'' with respect to small enough differences on a dimension decisive of their application. This principle may seem to hold on the basis that (for example) no particular height is more justified than others in its vicinity as a cut-off for shortness. This intuition has been called the ''No Sharp Boundaries'' thesis about vague predicates and plays a prominent role in theories of vagueness. 

The Sorites paradox dates to the fourth century BCE and is attributed to [[Eubulides|Eubulides of Melitus]]. It has received a resurgence of attention since 1975, when three papers published in ''Synthese'' effectively conceived the contemporary study of vagueness.  

The problem posed by vagueness is to explain its particular kind of indeterminacy. Does vagueness render large portions of ordinary language meaningless? Likely not, since we frequently use vague language to great effect in ordinary discourse. If not, what ''is'' vagueness, at the level of predicate logic? How is it to be modeled without contradiction, and without sacrificing too much of classical logic? Is vagueness semantic, metaphysical or epistemic? 

Vagueness has in its own right reaped the attention of an extensive literature. In addition, vagueness is a topic that touches many other questions in philosophy, linguistics and cognitive science, not to mention ordinary conversation. 

== Importance ==
Vagueness is philosophically important. Suppose one wants to come up with a definition of "right" in the moral sense. One wants a definition to cover actions that are clearly right and exclude actions that are clearly wrong, but what does one do with the borderline cases? Surely, there are such cases. Some philosophers say that one should try to come up with a definition that is itself unclear on just those cases. Others say that one has an interest in making his or her definitions more precise than ordinary language, or his or her ordinary concepts, themselves allow; they recommend one advances [[precising definition]]s.&lt;ref name="Williamson.1994"&gt;[[Timothy Williamson|Williamson, T]]. 1994. ''Vagueness'', {{page needed|date=April 2017}}. London: Routledge. &lt;br /&gt;The history of the problem of vagueness is traced, from the first [[Sorites Paradox]] to contemporary attempts to deal with higher-order vagueness such as [[many-valued logic]], [[supervaluationism]], and [[fuzzy logic]]. Technicalities are kept to a minimum to favour a clear account, extremely useful to both students and researchers.{{citation needed|date=April 2017|reason=Specific claims regarding the usefulness of a source to readers of this article.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vagueness is also a problem which arises in law, and in some cases judges have to arbitrate regarding whether a borderline case does, or does not, satisfy a given vague concept.  Examples include disability (how much loss of vision is required before one is legally blind?), human life (at what point from conception to birth is one a legal human being, protected for instance by laws against murder?), adulthood (most familiarly reflected in legal ages for driving, drinking, voting, consensual sex, etc.), race (how to classify someone of mixed racial heritage), etc.  Even such apparently unambiguous concepts such as gender can be subject to vagueness problems, not just from [[transsexual]]s' gender transitions but also from certain genetic conditions which can give an individual mixed male and female biological traits (see [[intersex]]).

Many scientific concepts are of necessity vague, for instance [[species]] in biology cannot be precisely defined, owing to unclear cases such as [[ring species]].  Nonetheless, the concept of species can be clearly applied in the vast majority of cases.  As this example illustrates, to say that a definition is "vague" is not necessarily a criticism. Consider those animals in Alaska that are the result of breeding [[Husky|huskies]] and [[wolf|wolves]]: are they [[dog]]s? It is not clear: they are borderline cases of dogs. This means one's ordinary concept of doghood is not clear enough to let us rule conclusively in this case.

== Approaches ==
The philosophical question of what the best theoretical treatment of vagueness is - which is closely related to the problem of the [[paradox of the heap]], a.k.a. sorites paradox - has been the subject of much philosophical debate.

=== Fuzzy logic ===
[[File:Fuzzy logic temperature en.svg|thumb|In fuzzy logic, e.g. the predicates ''cold'', ''warm'', and ''hot'' apply gradually (vertical axis, 0 and 1 meaning ''certainly not'' and ''certainly'', respectively) to a given temperature (horizontal axis).]]
{{main|Fuzzy logic}}
One theoretical approach is that of fuzzy logic, developed by American mathematician [[Lotfi Zadeh]]. Fuzzy logic proposes a gradual transition between "perfect falsity", for example, the statement "[[Bill Clinton]] is bald", to "perfect truth", for, say, "[[Patrick Stewart]] is bald". In ordinary logics, there are only two [[truth-value]]s: "true" and "false". The fuzzy perspective differs by introducing ''an infinite number of truth-values'' along a spectrum between perfect truth and perfect falsity. Perfect truth may be represented by "1", and perfect falsity by "0". Borderline cases are thought of as having a "truth-value" anywhere between 0 and 1 (for example, 0.6). Advocates of the fuzzy logic approach have included K. F. Machina (1976) &lt;ref&gt;Machina, K.F. 1976. "Truth, belief and vagueness", in ''[[Journal of Philosophical Logic]]'' Vol. 5. pp. 47-78&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dorothy Edgington]] (1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Edgington, D.| title=Vagueness by degrees| year=1997| pages=294–316| publisher=MIT Press| editor=Keefe, R. |editor2=Smith, P.| url=http://www.jo_syp.republika.pl/media/vbd.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supervaluationism ===
{{main|Supervaluationism}}
Another theoretical approach is known as "supervaluationism". This approach has been defended by [[Kit Fine]] and Rosanna Keefe. Fine argues that borderline applications of vague predicates are neither true nor false, but rather are instances of "[[truth value]] gaps". He defends an interesting and sophisticated system of vague semantics, based on the notion that a vague predicate might be "made precise" in many alternative ways. This system has the consequence that borderline cases of vague terms yield statements that are neither true, nor false.&lt;ref&gt;Kit Fine, ''The Limits of Abstraction'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Given a supervaluationist semantics, one can define the predicate 'supertrue' as meaning "true on all precisifications".  This predicate will not change the semantics of atomic statements (e.g. 'Frank is bald', where Frank is a borderline case of baldness), but does have consequences for logically complex statements. In particular, the [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] of sentential logic, such as 'Frank is bald or Frank is not bald', will turn out to be supertrue, since on any precisification of baldness, either 'Frank is bald' or 'Frank is not bald' will be true.  Since the presence of borderline cases seems to threaten principles like this one (excluded middle), the fact that supervaluationism can "rescue" them is seen as a virtue.

=== Subvaluationism ===
{{main|Dialetheism}}
Subvaluationism is the logical dual of supervaluationism, and has been defended by Dominic Hyde (2008) and Pablo Cobreros (2011). Whereas the supervaluationist characterises truth as 'supertruth', the subvaluationist characterises truth as 'subtruth', or "true on at least some precisifications".&lt;ref&gt;Pablo Cobreros, (2011) "Paraconsistent Vagueness: A Positive Argument" ''Synthese'' 183(2): 211–227&lt;/ref&gt; 

Subvaluationism proposes that borderline applications of vague terms are both true and false. It thus has 'truth-value gluts'. According to this theory, a vague statement is true if it is true on at least one precisification and false if it is false under at least one precisification. If a vague statement comes out true under one precisification and false under another, it is both true and false. Subvaluationism ultimately amounts to the claim that vagueness is a truly contradictory phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Dominic Hyde and Mark Colyvan (2008) “Paraconsistent Vagueness: Why Not?” ''Australasian Journal of Logic'' 6: 107–121.&lt;/ref&gt; Of a borderline case of 'bald man' it would be both true and false to say that he is bald, and both true and false to say that he is not bald.

=== The epistemicist view ===
{{main|Epistemicism}}
A fourth approach, known as the "epistemicist view", has been defended by [[Timothy Williamson]] (1994),&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, T. 1994. ''Vagueness'' London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Sorensen|R. A. Sorensen]] (1988) &lt;ref&gt;Sorensen, R.A. 1988. ''Blindspots''. Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and (2001),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Sorensen, Roy| title=Vagueness and Contradiction| year=2001| publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nicholas Rescher]] (2009).&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Rescher|Rescher, N.]] 2009. ''Unknowability''. Lexington Books. &lt;br&gt; Uses [[vagrant predicate]]s to elucidate the problem.&lt;/ref&gt; They maintain that vague predicates do, in fact, draw sharp boundaries, but that one cannot know where these boundaries lie. One's confusion about whether some vague word does or does not apply in a borderline case is explained as being due to one's ignorance. For example, on the epistemicist view, there is a fact of the matter, for every person, about whether that person is old or not old. It is just that one may sometimes be ignorant of this fact.

===As a property of objects===

One possibility is that one's words and concepts are perfectly precise, but that objects themselves are vague.  Consider [[Peter Unger]]'s example of a [[cloud]] (from his famous 1980 paper, "The Problem of the Many"):  it's not clear where the boundary of a cloud lies; for any given bit of water vapor, one can ask whether it's part of the cloud or not, and for many such bits, one won't know how to answer.  So perhaps one's term 'cloud' denotes a vague object precisely.  This strategy has been poorly received, in part due to [[Gareth Evans (philosopher)|Gareth Evans's]] short paper "Can There Be Vague Objects?" (1978).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Evans, G.| title=Can There Be Vague Objects?| journal=Analysis| year=1978| volume=38| pages=208–| doi=10.1093/analys/38.4.208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans's argument appears to show that there can be no vague identities (e.g. "Princeton = Princeton Borough"), but as Lewis (1988) makes clear, Evans takes for granted that there are in fact vague identities, and that any proof to the contrary cannot be right.  Since the proof Evans produces relies on the assumption that terms precisely denote vague objects, the implication is that the assumption is false, and so the vague-objects view is wrong.

Still by, for instance, proposing alternative deduction rules involving [[Identity of indiscernibles|Leibniz's law]] or other rules for validity some philosophers are willing to defend vagueness as some kind of metaphysical phenomenon. One has, for example, [[Peter van Inwagen]] (1990),&lt;ref&gt;Van Inwagen, Peter. 1990 ''Material Beings''. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Trenton Merricks and Terence Parsons (2000).&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, Terence. 2000. ''Indeterminate Identity - Metaphysics and Semantics'' Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal principle== &lt;!--- courtesy under WP:LINK, [[Albert Haddock]] links here]] --&gt;
In the common law system, vagueness is a possible legal defence against by-laws and other regulations.  The legal principle is that delegated power cannot be used more broadly than the delegator intended. Therefore, a regulation may not be so vague as to regulate areas beyond what the law allows. Any such regulation would be "void for vagueness" and unenforceable.  This principle is sometimes used to strike down municipal by-laws that forbid "explicit" or "objectionable" contents from being sold in a certain city; courts often find such expressions to be too vague, giving municipal inspectors discretion beyond what the law allows. In the US this is known as the [[vagueness doctrine]] and in Europe as the [[principle of legal certainty]].

'''Vajrasati yoga''' is a style of yoga developed by Jim Tarran. It is influenced by his background in both [[Hatha]] and [[Iyengar]] yoga teaching. Vajrasati yoga uses [[asana]], [[pranayama]], [[breathwork]] and [[mudra]] as a means to lead students towards moksha or liberation as described in the fourth section of [[Patanjali]]'s Yoga Sutras. Classes emphasise attentive awareness of all levels of the self from the most apparent, physical level to the most subtle states in order to connect students to their own, intuitive intelligence.&lt;ref name="intelligence"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://centredspace.net/leonie-taylor/vajrasati-yoga/|title=A centred space, mindful yoga) |publisher=Leonie@centredspace.net |date= |accessdate=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology== 
Vajrasati is a composite word created by bringing together two words; [[Vajra]] (Pali - Vajira) from the [[Sanskrit]] word for thunderbolt,&lt;ref name="Vajra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/history/bud_vajra.htm |title=Buddhist Symbols: The Vajra (Thunder Bolt) |publisher=Buddhanet.net |date= |accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Pali]] word for mindfulness or recollection - Sati (Sanskrit -Smṛti.).&lt;ref name="Sati"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vipassana.co.uk/meditation/mindfulness_in_plain_english_15.php |title=Mindfulness (sati) |publisher=Vipassana.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These two words from closely linked Indic languages ([[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]]) were chosen in order to reference Vajrasati’s ideological links to early [[Buddhist meditation]] as well the wider [[Sanskrit]] tradition which includes later [[Buddhist schools]] as well as other yogic soteriologies such as Non-dual&lt;ref name="ND"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yogajournal.com/article/yoga-101/tantra-rising/ |title=Yoga &amp; Tantra |publisher=Yoga Journal |date=2007-08-28 |accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaiva Tantra (NDST),&lt;ref name="Tantra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mattamayura.org/what-is-tantra-really/ |title=What is Tantra (really)? &amp;#124; Explore. Engage. Awaken |publisher=Mattamayura.org |date= |accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patañjali]]'s Yoga Sastra,&lt;ref name="Yoga Sutras"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swamij.com/yoga-sutras.htm |title=Yoga Sutras |publisher=Swamij.com |date=2011-02-08 |accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Advaita Vedanta.&lt;ref name="AV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp/ |title=The Advaita Vedânta Home Page |publisher=Advaita-vedanta.org |date=1999-05-05 |accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two languages also point to the school’s focus on the equal importance of action - as expressed through its emphasis on embodied means ([[sanskrit]] - anava upaya) represented by its strong focus on bodywork largely in the form of [[āsana]] or yogic postures (literally - seats) and on quietude manifested in more externally still forms of practice such as in seated meditation.&lt;ref name="bodywork"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4auO6awJzxs|title=yoga for a busy life 3:10-4:18|date=2016-07-21 |accessdate=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Vajrasati yoga was founded in 2000 by Jim Tarran&lt;ref name="founded"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jimtarranyoga.com |title=Home |publisher=JimTarranYoga |date= |accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; who wanted to found a movement that could both enjoy the benefits of working with other people who would share experiences, resources, knowledge and peer to peer emotional support whilst avoiding the disadvantages of institutionalisation.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vajrasatiyoga.co.uk/about/ |title=About |publisher=Vajrasati Yoga |date= |accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tarran's proposed solution was to create a school&lt;ref name="school"&gt;{{citation |last=Nash |first=Belinda |date=November 2003 |title=anatomy of a yogi, the insight |location=page 30 |publisher=bn1 publishing ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; that emphasised shared learning in which teachers trained in the school would be encouraged to follow the essential Buddhist principal of ehipassiko  [[Pali]] for come and see (for yourself)&lt;ref name="Ehipassiko"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/asthewheelturns/2010/05/ehipassiko-come-see/ |title=Ehipassiko! (Come &amp; see) |publisher=Patheos.com |date=2010-05-31 |accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then share their findings with each other. In this environment Tarran believed information could be affirmed, refined, clarified and thus lead to more accurate knowledge.&lt;ref name="welcome"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vajrasatiyoga.co.uk/welcome|title=Vajrasati Yoga Welcome  |date=2011–2012 |accessdate=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jim Tarran==
Born April in 1970 Yoga alliance Senior Yoga Teacher (SYT) Jim Tarran&lt;ref name="Jim"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jimtarranyoga.com |title=Home |publisher=JimTarranYoga |date= |accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; began practicing yoga in 1990 after spending much of his teen years interested in the fringes of [[Eastern philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Eastern Philosophy"&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;mdash; Buddha |url=http://www.vajrasatiyoga.co.uk/JimTarran |title=Jim Tarran - Vajrasati School's Founder |publisher=Vajrasati Yoga |date= |accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:JimTarran2.jpg|thumb|Jim in Parivrtta Janu Sirsasana]]
[[File:JimTarran3.jpg|thumb|Jim in Paschimottanasana]]

He graduated from the Patañjali Yoga School in [[Kathmandu]] in 1992, and the Iyengar school in 1996.&lt;ref name="BKS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bksiyengar.com/ |title=Home |publisher=B K S Iyengar |date=2014-08-20 |accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Iyengar Yoga"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iyengaryoga.org.uk/ |title=Iyengar Home - Iyengar Yoga UK |publisher=Iyengaryoga.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 he was one of the very few teachers listed by name in the Top 20 Yoga Retreats in the World (The Times).&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news|author=Caroline Sylger Jones |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/travel/article4652779.ece |title=The 20 best yoga retreats in the world |publisher=The Times |date=2016-01-02 |accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has spent 27 years in the yoga world (at time of writing 2017), including sixteen years leading yoga teacher-training courses as well as numerous international yoga breaks and workshops. His classes are mostly based around the UK's South East especially Brighton, where he lives, and London.&lt;ref name="cal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vajrasatiyoga.co.uk/calendar|title=Vajrasati Yoga Calendar |date=2011–2012 |accessdate=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[File:KhadineMorcom.jpg|thumb|Khadine practicing Siddhasana near some cacti]]
[[File:KhadineMorcom1.jpg|thumb|Khadine teaching Vajrasati yoga]]

The school seeks to achieve these ends through encouraging students to practice whilst exploring common yogic principles such as set out in the yamas and niyamas of [[Patañjali]]'s sūtras.&lt;ref name="Yamas and Niyamas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yogajournal.com/article/yoga-101/live-your-yoga-discover-yamas-niyamas/ |title=Discover the Yamas and Niyamas: Yoga’s Ethical + Moral Codes |publisher=Yogajournal.com |date=2015-09-15 |accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular; non-violence (ahimsa), honesty (satya), investigation (svādhyāya),  and a sense of trust in a knowing ([[Sanskrit]] - Prajñā). According to [[Patanjali]], this knowing is not stored or learned but more 'plugged into' (ishvara pranidhana). 

The body is seen as a doorway into a richer experience of an interconnected holism&lt;ref name="holism" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://vajrasatiyoga.co.uk/welcome|title=Vajrasati Yoga Welcome  |date=2011–2012 |accessdate=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  - a journey described by its founder Jim Tarran&lt;ref name="journey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jimtarranyoga.com |title=Home |publisher=JimTarranYoga |date= |accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; as one from the finite, created, mind-made appearance of a divided universe into an experience of reality as infinite and self manifest (needing no creator or separate agency). In The Yoga Sutras,&lt;ref name="Yoga Sutras"/&gt; this is sometimes expressed as a Phoenix style disappearance or melting (Sanskrit - Laya)&lt;ref name="Laya"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yogamag.net/archives/1980/fjune80/laya.shtml |title=Laya - the Yoga of Pranayama |publisher=Yogamag.net |date= |accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; which generates an instant reemergence into a new and rich paradigm of being the knowing.

== Classes==

Classes resemble many other Modern Postural Yoga&lt;ref name="MPY"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://yogacritiques.org/reviews/mark-singletons-yoga-body-the-origins-of-modern-posture-practice-a-synopsis-review-and-personal-perspective/ |title=Mark Singleton’s Yoga Body: The Origins of Modern Posture Practice – A Synopsis, Review and Personal Perspective |publisher=Yoga Critiques |date= |accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; (MPY) classes in terms of postures and the use of typical aids like blocks and belts when deemed useful. Classes emphasise personal experiences and exploration.&lt;ref name="exploration"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdDZfqizRAk |title=vajrasati style |date=2017-06-19 |accessdate=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a strong emphasis on anatomy and experiential yoga philosophy.&lt;ref name="Yog Phil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yogabasics.com/learn/philosophy-of-yoga/ |title=Philosophy of Yoga • Yoga Basics: Yoga Poses, Meditation, History, Philosophy &amp; More |publisher=Yogabasics.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Pranayama]] (In [[Sanskrit]]: Un-curbed energy) is an integral part of a Vajrasati Yoga practice and theory. It is viewed  as a gateway to the integrated&lt;ref name="integrate"&gt;{{citation |last=Smith |first=Poppy |date=October 2005 |title=1yoga vs pilates, the insight |location=page 29 |publisher=bn1 publishing ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; state of flow and is seen as equally and simultaneously running through the body, brain and breath. As with all approaches within the school the aim is to clear the channels so to give students an experience of direct knowing and its result a profound understanding of how and when to move correctly.&lt;ref name="pran"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vajrasatiyoga.co.uk/PranMain|title=Vajrasati Yoga Pranayama  |date=2011–2012 |accessdate=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This symbiotic flow is achieved through an emphasis on non-violence and gracefulness, a letting go into a state of presence. This experience of  [[Pranayama]] or free flow is also nudged, probed  and teased through pranayama techniques (various breathing adjustments such as interrupted Breath ([[Sanskrit]] - Viloma),&lt;ref name="Viloma"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcPjvp4La8A |title=BKS Iyengar pranayama |publisher=YouTube |date=2006-08-10 |accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Victorious breath.&lt;ref name="Ujjayi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yogajournal.com/article/practice-section/what-is-ujjayi/ |title=Learn the Ujjayi Breathing Technique &amp;#124; Yoga and Pranayama |publisher=Yogajournal.com |date=2007-08-28 |accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Sanskrit]] - ujjayi) The school’s attitude is that through doing so, the practitioner will form a direct intimate relationship with this subtle energy and its flow or lack thereof.&lt;ref name="pran"/&gt;
 
Class style can vary depending on abilities and the needs of students.&lt;ref name="style"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/spas/best-yoga-holidays-in-the-world/|title=The 25 greatest yoga holidays on the planet (number 4 Yoga Explorers, Italy)  |date=2017-06-19 |accessdate=2017-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vajrasati students are encouraged to feel the flow of life, intelligence and breath whilst in the postures in a way akin to that expressed in the Śhiva Sūtras "karaṇaśaktiḥ svato' nubhavāt" 'The power of performance, expression or action comes from the experience of what is truly one's own'.&lt;ref name="Shiva Sutras"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shivashakti.com/sutras.htm |title=The Shiva Sutras &amp;#124; |publisher=ShivaShakti.com |date=2007 |accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students are therefore asked to"Listen/Respond". This is shorthand for accessing a sort of profound connection to the multifarious nuances of this moment through a process of disentanglement ([[Sanskrit]] - [[vairagya]]) and it's associated quietude. This connection results in spontaneous ([[Sanskrit]] - [[Sahaja]]) movements such as releases and explorative expansions into the body that come from a profound knowing that would otherwise be impaired by " the noise of our own projections".
 
Classes can include any of the following common yoga techniques,&lt;ref name="YB" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yogabasics.com |title=Home; |date= |accessdate=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; postures, [[mantra]]s,&lt;ref name="aum"&gt;{{citation |last=childs |first=andrea |date=October 2006 |title=10 ways to beat the big chill, Sainsbury's magazine |location=page 128 |publisher=seven publishing group }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[meditation]], breathing exercises, mudras &lt;ref name="mudras"&gt;{{citation |last=Morcom |first=Khadine |date=July 2017 |title=Mudras in a Modern Day Yoga Practice, yoga magazine|location=page 40-43 |publisher=Yoga International Magazine Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are always student led in terms of the subtleties of when to move.

There are currently 75 Vajrasati Yoga teachers in the UK (2017) with numbers now rising since the school expanded its training program into two new London locations in September 2016. Training as a Vajrasati yoga teacher, who are known as Vajrasatins, takes two years on average with additional training required following graduation. The school is certified as a 500 hour course with The Yoga Alliance.

      <comment>Hansen, Chad. (1983). (see above). There are no articles in Chinese, so the nouns must be read as collectives, mass nouns or plurals. The argument is about the use of terms hence belongs to the school of names. It is not about the color of horses.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13196">'''When A White Horse Is Not A Horse''' ({{zh|c=白馬非馬|p=''Báimǎ fēi mǎ''|w=''Pai-ma fei ma''|l=white horse not horse}}), also known as the '''White Horse Dialogue''' ({{zh|c=白馬論|p=''Báimǎ Lùn''|w=''Pai-ma Lun''|l=white horse discourse}}), is a famous paradox in [[Chinese philosophy]]. [[Gongsun Long]] wrote this circa 300 BC dialectic analysis of the question 'Is "white horse not horse" permissibly assertible?'.

==The original text==
[[File:Cabalo044eue.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Is it a horse?]]
The White Horse Dialogue (''Baima Lun'') constitutes chapter 2 of the [[eponymous]] ''Gongsun Longzi'' "Master Gongsun Long", who was counted among the "[[School of Names]]" (aka "Logicians" or "Dialecticians") in the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]]. Most of Gongsun's writings have been lost and the received ''Gongsun Longzi'' text only contains 6 of the supposedly 14 original chapters. Parts of the text are dislocated and some commentators and translators rearrange them for clarity. The dialogue is between two unnamed speakers.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Is "{{zh|c=白馬非馬|p=''Báimǎ fēi mǎ''|l=white horse not horse}}" assertible?&lt;br /&gt;

Advocate: It is.&lt;br /&gt;

Objector: How?&lt;br /&gt;

Advocate: "Horse" is that by means of which one names the shape. "White" is that by means of which one names the color. What names the color is not what names the shape. Hence, one may "white horse not horse."&lt;br /&gt;

Objector: If there are white horses, one cannot say that there are no horses. If one cannot say that there are no horses, doesn't that mean that there are horses? For there to be white horses is for there to be horses. How could it be that the white ones are not horses?&lt;br /&gt;

Advocate: If one wants horses, that extends to yellow or black horses. But if one wants white horses, that does not extend to a yellow or black horses. Suppose that white horses were horses. Then what one wants [in the two cases] would be the same. If what one wants were the same, then 'white' would not differ from 'horse.' If what one wants does not differ, then how is it that yellow or black horses are acceptable in one case and unacceptable in the other case? It is clear that acceptable and unacceptable are mutually contrary. Hence, yellow and black horses are the same, one can respond that there are horses, but one cannot respond that there are white horses. Thus, it is evident that white horses are not horses.&lt;ref name="readings"&gt;[[Gongsun Long]]zi. (2005). {{Google books|5PL9hSUiVEoC|''Readings in Classical Chinese Philosophy,'' pp. 364–365|page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This dialogue continues with deliberations over colored and colorless horses and whether "white" and "horse" can be separated from "white horse".

Other ''Gongsun longzi'' chapters discuss ''Baima''-related concepts of ''jian'' [[Wikt:堅|堅]] "hard; hardness" and ''bai'' [[Wikt:白|白]] "white; whiteness", ''ming'' [[Wikt:名|名]] "name; term" and ''shi'' [[Wikt:實|實]] "solid; true, actual; fact, reality", and abstract ''zhi'' [[Wikt:指|指]] "finger; pointing; designation; [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]]" like "whiteness" and concrete ''wu'' [[Wikt:物|物]] "thing; object; [[particular]]" like a "white horse".

==Difficulties of interpretation==
The Chinese of "a white horse is not a horse" is ''bai ma fei ma'' 白馬非馬, whose meaning hinges upon the [[Negation (rhetoric)|negative]] ''fei'' [[Wikt:非|非]] "not, is not; no, negative; oppose; wrong". The Classical construction "A ''fei'' B" "A非B" can ambiguously mean either "A is not a member of the class B" or "A is not identical to B".&lt;ref name="Graham-studies334"&gt;Graham, Angus Charles. (1990). {{google books|TD43k809CT8C|''Studies in Chinese Philosophy and Philosophical Literature,'' p. 334.|page=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interpreting this [[equivocation]] fallacy, [[A.C. Graham]] says this "white horse" vs. "horse" paradox plays upon the ambiguity of whether "is" means:
# "Is a member of the [[Class (philosophy)|class]] (x)"
# "Is identical to  (x)"&lt;ref name="Graham-studies334"/&gt;

In other words, the expression "a white horse is not a horse" is ambiguous between "a white horse is not identical with a horse" (true, because "white horse" is more specific than "horse"), and "a white horse is not a member of the set of horses" (obviously false). The Advocate in the dialogue is asserting that "a white horse is not [identical with] a horse," while the Objector is interpreting the Advocate's statement as "a white horse is not [a member of the group of] horses."

An illustration of the alternative uses of "fei" may be found in the widely known "Happiness of Fish" dialogue in ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' (17, tr. Watson 1968:188-9). Huizi says "You're not a fish [子非魚] &amp;mdash; how do you know what fish enjoy?" (denying that Zhuangzi is a member of the class of fish) and Zhuangzi replies "You're not I [子非我], so how do you know I don't know what fish enjoy?" (denying that the individuals Huizi and Zhuangzi are identical).

Beyond the inherent semantic ambiguities of ''Baima fei ma'', the first line obscurely asks ''ke hu'' [[Wikt:可|可]][[Wikt:乎|乎]] "Can it be that …?". This dialogue could be an attempted proof that a white horse is not a horse, or a question if such a statement is possible, or both. [[Bryan W. Van Norden]] suggests that "the Advocate is only arguing that 'a white horse is not a horse' ''could'' be true, given a certain interpretation. He might acknowledge that, in another interpretation, 'a white horse ''is'' a horse.' "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Norden|first1=Bryan|title=Introduction to Classical Chinese Philosophy|date=2011|publisher=Hackett Publishing Company|location=Indianapolis|isbn=9781603844680|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative interpretation is offered in [[Feng Youlan]]'s ''History of Chinese Philosophy ''(translated in 1952 by [[Derk Bodde]]):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Strictly speaking, names or terms are divided into those that are abstract and those that are concrete. The abstract term denotes the universal, the concrete term the particular. The particular is the denotation, and the universal the connotation, of the term. In western inflected languages there is no difficulty in distinguishing between the particular ('white' or 'horse') and the abstract ('whiteness' or 'horseness'). In Chinese, however, owing to the fact that the written characters are ideographic and pictorial and lack all inflection, there is no possible way, as far as the form of individual words is concerned, of distinguishing between abstract and concrete terms. Thus in Chinese the word designating a particular horse and that designating the universal, 'horseness,' are written and pronounced in the same way. Similarly with other terms, so that such words as 'horse' and 'white', being used to designate both the concrete particular and the abstract universal, thus hold two values.&lt;ref&gt;Fung Yu-lan. (1953). ''A History of Chinese Philosophy,'' p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, there are no contemporary histories of Chinese philosophy that subscribe to [[Feng Youlan]]'s interpretation. Other philosophers and sinologists who have analyzed the dialogue include Graham,&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Angus Charles. (1989). ''Disputers of the Tao: Philosophical Argument in Ancient China,'' pp.75-95;  Graham, (1990). {{Google books|TD43k809CT8C|''Studies,'' pp. 125–216.|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hansen,&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Chad. 1976. "Mass Nouns and 'A White Horse Is Not a Horse'", ''[[Philosophy East and West]],'' 26.2:189-209; Hansen, Chad. (1983). ''Language and Logic in Ancient China,'' p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Harbsmeier,&lt;ref&gt;Harbsmeier, Christoph. (1998). "Language and Logic in Traditional China". Volume 7, Part I of ''Science and Civilisation in China,'' pp. 298–321.&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson,&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Kirill Ole. 1995. "When a 'White Horse' Is Not a 'Horse'", ''Philosophy East and West'' 45.4:481-499.&lt;/ref&gt; and Van Norden.&lt;ref name="readings"/&gt;

==Historic influence==
In the Chinese philosophical tradition, the ''Baima Lun'''s significance is evident from how many [[Chinese classic texts]] directly or indirectly discuss it. The ''[[Liezi]]'', which lists and criticizes the paradoxes of Gongsun Long as "perversions of reason and sense", explains "'A white horse is not a horse', because the name diverges from the shape."&lt;ref name="Graham-studies80"&gt;Graham, {{Google books|TD43k809CT8C|p. 80.|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' chapters (17 and 33) mock Gongsun Long, and another (2) combines his ''zhi'' 指 "attribute" and ''ma'' 馬 "horse" notions in the same context.
&lt;blockquote&gt;To use an attribute to show that attributes are not attributes is not as good as using a nonattribute to show that attributes are not attributes. To use a horse to show that a horse is not a horse is not as good as using a non-horse to show that a horse is not a horse, Heaven and earth are one attribute; the ten thousand things are one horse.&lt;ref&gt;Zhuangzi. (2003). {{Google books|IKLsWSbCAWQC|''Zhuangzi: basic writings,'' p. 35.|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Mengzi'' (6A4) notes that ''bai'' 白 "white" has different connotations whether we are using it to refer to a graying person (who is worthy of respect because of his age) or a white horse (which should be treated like any other animal):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Mencius said, 'There is no difference between our pronouncing a white horse to be white and our pronouncing a white man to be white. But is there no difference between the regard with which we acknowledge the age of an old horse and that with which we acknowledge the age of an old man? And what is it which is called righteousness? The fact of a man's being old? Or the fact of our giving honour to his age?'&lt;ref&gt;Legge, James. (1895). {{Google books|4L0TAAAAYAAJ|''The Chinese Classics: a Translation;'' Part 2, ''The Works of Mencius,'' p. 398.|page=398}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Other early "A white horse is not a horse" references are found in the ''[[Hanfeizi]]'' (32), ''[[Mozi]]'' (11B), and ''[[Zhanguoce]]'' (4).

== Observation ==
[[Valentine's Day#Japan|Valentine's Day]] in countries which observe White Day is typically observed by girls and women presenting chocolate gifts (either store-bought or handmade), usually to boys or men, as an expression of love, courtesy, or social obligation.

On White Day, the reverse happens: men who received a {{nihongo3 |'chocolate of love'|本命チョコ|[[Honmei choco|honmei-choco]]}} or {{nihongo3 |'courtesy chocolate'|義理チョコ|[[Giri choco|giri-choco]]}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.japantravelinfo.com/blog/valentines-day-white-day-in-japan/ | title=Valentine’s Day &amp; White Day in Japan | publisher=[[Japan National Tourism Organization]] | accessdate=13 March 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504234139/http://www.japantravelinfo.com/blog/valentines-day-white-day-in-japan/ | archive-date=2014-05-04 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; on Valentine's Day are expected to return the favor by giving gifts.&lt;ref name="uh"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.crosscurrents.hawaii.edu/content.aspx?lang=eng&amp;site=japan&amp;theme=cal&amp;subtheme=CULTURHOL&amp;unit=JCAL018 | title=White Day (March 14) | work=Cross Currents | publisher=[[University of Hawaii]] | accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, popular White Day gifts are [[cookies]], [[jewelry]], [[white chocolate]], white [[lingerie]], and [[marshmallows]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Culture | publisher = Japan 101 | url = http://www.japan-101.com/culture/valentines_day.htm | contribution = Valentine’s day}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the term {{nihongo3 |'triple the return'|三倍返し|sanbai gaeshi}} is used to describe the generally recited rule for men that the return gift should be two to three times the worth of the Valentine's gift.&lt;ref name = "Iroha"&gt;{{Citation | script-title=ja:ホワイトデー | url = http://iroha-japan.net/iroha/A01_event/06_wd.html |trans-title=White Day | publisher = Japanese Culture Iroha Dictionary | language = Japanese}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
White Day was first celebrated in 1978 in Japan.&lt;ref name = "Iroha" /&gt; It was started by the National Confectionery Industry Association as an "answer day" to Valentine's Day on the grounds that men should pay back the women who gave them chocolate and other gifts on Valentine's Day. In 1977, a [[Fukuoka, Fukuoka|Fukuoka]]-based confectionery company, Ishimuramanseido, marketed [[marshmallow]]s to men on March 14, calling it {{nihongo |Marshmallow Day|マシュマロデー|Mashumaro Dē}}.&lt;ref name="Iroha" /&gt;

Soon thereafter, confectionery companies began marketing [[white chocolate]]. Now, men give both white and [[dark chocolate]], as well as other edible and non-edible gifts, such as [[jewelry]] or objects of sentimental value, or white clothing like [[lingerie]], to women from whom they received chocolate on Valentine's Day one month earlier.&lt;ref name="uh"/&gt; Flowers and other gifts are also given on this day. Eventually, this practice spread to the neighboring East Asian countries of South Korea, China, Taiwan and Vietnam. In those cultures, White Day is for the most part observed in a similar manner.

As a note in Japan, if chocolate given to a man a month prior was ''giri choco'', the man may not be expressing actual romantic interest, but rather a [[Giri (Japanese)|social obligation]].

'''William Henry Furness''' (April 20, 1802 – January 30, 1896) was an American clergyman, theologian, abolitionist and reformer.

==Biography==
Furness was born in Boston, where he developed a lifelong friendship with schoolmate [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. He graduated from the [[Harvard Divinity School]] in 1823. At the age of 22 he became the minister of the [[First Unitarian Church of Philadelphia]], which had operated without a minister for 29 years. He served there from 1825 until his retirement in 1875. The congregation grew substantially during his ministry, moving to a larger building in 1828. It moved to a still larger building in 1886, which was designed by his son Frank.&lt;ref name=harvard_square /&gt;&lt;ref name= philly-history /&gt;

Furness was an ardent [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] whose attacks on the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]] led to a discussion at a cabinet meeting of President [[James Buchanan]] about the possibility of indicting him for treason.&lt;ref name=civilwarphilly&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civilwarphilly.net/johnbrown/tourstops.pdf|title=John Brown's Philadelphia|author=V. Chapman-Smith|publisher=Civil War History Consortium|accessdate=August 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was a prominent speaker at the Martyr Day vigil in Philadelphia in 1859, which marked the execution of [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]], who had attempted to spark a slave uprising in the South.&lt;ref name=civilwarphilly/&gt;
After abolitionist Senator [[Charles Sumner]] was severely beaten on the floor of the Senate by Congressman [[Preston Brooks]] of South Carolina, he stayed at the Furness home during part of his convalescence.&lt;ref name=philly-history/&gt;

Furness was a student of the life of [[Jesus]], about whom he published several books. He asserted that the miracles attributed to Jesus in the Christian Bible were natural events with rational explanations.&lt;ref name=harvard_square/&gt;
He rejected traditional beliefs about Jesus' miraculous birth, saying, "these stories may have been pure fictions ... [or] they were exaggerations of certain simple and very natural incidents, magnified by wonder."&lt;ref&gt;Furness, William Henry (1853), ''A History of Jesus'', Boston: Crosby, Nichols and Company, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZukS02TIVAwC&amp;pg=PA19 p. 19]&lt;/ref&gt;

Furness promoted outreach to the Jewish community in Philadelphia.  His son Frank was the architect for the new building for [[Congregation Rodeph Shalom (Philadelphia)|Congregation Rodeph Shalom]].&lt;ref name=philly-history/&gt;

He married Annis P. Jenks of Salem, Massachusetts in 1825. They had four children: [[William Henry Furness, Jr.]], a portrait painter; [[Horace Howard Furness]], a Shakespeare scholar; [[Frank Furness]], one of Philadelphia's most prominent architects; and [[Annis Lee Wister|Annis Lee Furness Wister]], an author and translator.&lt;ref name=harvard_square&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/biographies/william-henry-furness|title=William Henry Furness|date=September 29, 2012|publisher=Harvard Square Library|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=philly-history&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.phillyhistory.org/blog/index.php/2012/04/reverend-william-henry-furness-a-philadelphia-unitarian/|title=Reverend William Henry Furness: A Philadelphia Unitarian|author=Steven Ujifusa|date=April 19, 2012|publisher=City of Philadelphia|accessdate=August 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
