'''Aatxe''' ({{IPA-eu|a.atʃe|}}) is a spirit in the folk [[Basque mythology|mythology]] of the [[Basque people]]. His name is literally translated as "Young Bull", and he is sometimes known as '''Etsai'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Spirits, Fairies, Leprechauns and Goblins|publisher=Norton|isbn=0-393-31792-7|chapter=A|year=1998|last=Rose|first=Carol|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a [[cave]]-dwelling spirit who adopts the form of a young red bull, but being a [[shapeshifter]], sometimes takes the shape of a man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Element Encyclopedia of Magical Creatures|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=0-00-720873-1|year=2005|last=Matthews|first=John &amp; Caitlin|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Patxi Xabier Lezama Perier |title=Basque Mythology: History of the myths and deities of the Basque Mythology |date=2018 |location=Euskadi Public Reading Network / Google |url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Basque_Mythology_History_of_the_myths_and_deities_?id=vlpZDwAAQBAJ&amp;hl=en_US }}&lt;/ref&gt;At night, more so in stormy weather, he arises from the hollow which is his lair. He attacks criminals and other malevolent people. He also protects people by making them stay home when danger is near.

He is theorized to be a representative of the goddess [[Mari (goddess)|Mari]], or may be an enforcer of her will, punishing people who cheat her. Another name for him is Aatxegorri which means "young red bull". It is believed Aatxe inhabited caves and hollows; in many ([[Isturits]], [[Sare]], [[Errenteria]], among others) engravings and paintings depicting aurochs, bulls, and oxen have been found; which implies that this Basque myth has its origins in the Paleolithic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/5626 Aatxe entry] at the Auñamendi Entziklopedia (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Aatxe is used as the name of horned shadow monsters in the [[Guild Wars]] franchise.

On 12 December 2014, Aatxes were added to the popular smartphone game [[Disco Zoo]].

In the upcoming webcomic "Sparrow," one of the main characters, called the Red Horn, is an Aatxe.

In the 1982 film [[The_Last_Unicorn_(film)|The Last Unicorn]], a monster called The Red Bull appears to have many similarities to the Aatxe. Such similarities include dwelling in a cave, and only emerging from his lair at night. He is also described as a ghost by the character Prince Lir.

The '''Alliance of Democratic Forces''' ({{lang-fr|Alliance des forces démocratiques}}, '''AFD''') is a [[political alliance]] in [[Ivory Coast]] led by the [[Ivorian Popular Front]] (FPI).

==History==
The alliance was established on 26 March 2014 in order to contest the [[Ivorian presidential election, 2015|2015 presidential elections]], succeeding the [[National Congress of Resistance for Democracy]]. It was formed by 12 parties:&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.abidjan.net/h/493777.html Coalition de l’opposition : Quelle Afdci face au Rhdp ?] Abidjan.net, 28 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; the FPI, the [[Ivorian Workers' Party]], the Rally for Peace, Progress and Participation, the Ivorian Alliance for the Republic and Democracy, the Ivorian Congress for Development and Peace, the New Alliance of Ivory Coast for the Homeland, the Rally for Democracy and Peace, the Union of Democrats for Progress, the Union for Total Democracy in Ivory Coast, the Republican Union for Democracy, the Union of New Generations and the Party for Ivory Coast.

The alliance nominated [[Pascal Affi N'Guessan]] of the FPI as its candidate for the presidential elections. He finished second with 9% of the vote as incumbent President [[Alassane Ouattara]] was re-elected with 84% of the vote.

Originally the '''Anglo-Belarusian Society''' (Belarusian: Англа-беларускае таварыства) was a part of the [[Association of Belarusians in Great Britain]]. Because of the growing interest of the British public in  Belarus and Belarusians, it was established as a separate organisation on 16 March 1954. The society's object is diffusion, interchange and publication of knowledge relating to the Belarusian people, their land, history and culture. 

The first president of the Anglo-Belarusian Society was [[William David Ormsby-Gore]]. A long-serving President of the Society was Frances Ward (Lady Phipps), wife of [[Eric Phipps]]. Another woman who was actively involved in Anglo-Belarusian Society was [[Katharine Macmillan]], a vice-chairman of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in 1968. She served first as the organisation's Vice President and then President. 

Despite its "Anglo-" label, the society was not intended to exclude Scotland, Wales and other parts of the UK. Among the early cultural activities of the society was the publication of a regular pamphlet on Belarus and the organisation of concerts of Belarusian church chants, folk songs and dances in [[Westminster Cathedral]] Hall in 1950s. 

Since 1965 the society has been publishing the ''[[Journal of Belarusian Studies]]''.

It was built in 1996 to mark the military [[1994 Gambian coup d'état|coup d'état]] of July 22, 1994, through which [[Yahya Jammeh]] and his [[Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council]] overthrew the democratically elected Gambian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ham | first1 = Anthony | title = West Africa | publisher = Lonely Planet | year = 2009 | location = London | pages = 295 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1HapewBo3c0C&amp;lpg=PA295&amp;ots=pHm1011pNk&amp;dq=%22pierre%20goudiaby%22%20arch%2022&amp;pg=PA295#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arch stands on the Banjul-[[Serrekunda]] Highway, near the traffic island at the intersection with Box Bar Road, Independence Drive, and Marina Parade. A statue of the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|"unknown soldier"]] can be seen near the base of the arch: the soldier has a rifle strapped to his back and carries a baby in one hand while signaling [[victory]] (making a [[V-sign]]) with the other.

Arch 22 is depicted on the back of the 100-[[Gambian dalasi|dalasis]] banknote.

== Construction ==
The Arch was designed by Senegalese architect [[Pierre Goudiaby]], who also designed the [[Yundum International Airport]] at Banjul and the [[African Renaissance Monument]] in Dakar, Senegal.

At 35 metres, the Arch is one of the tallest structures in the Gambia. The building stands on eight columns and has three floors. Access to the upper floors can be made through several elevators and spiral cases.

The first floor is at an intermediate level in the columns. The gallery on the second floor provides an impressive panorama of the city, with the view extending down to the sea port of Banjul and the mangrove forests of [[Tanbi Wetland Complex]]. On the top floor is a small textile museum.

Because the stability of the construction is in doubt, the Arch has been closed to traffic.

The '''Asia Petrochemical Industry Conference''' ('''APIC''') is an annual, international [[Meeting|conference]] within the [[petrochemical industry]] intended to "spur mutual friendship and goodwill" within the industry with an aim to encouraging its "sound development".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.apic-online.org/about_apic.html | title = About APIC | accessdate = 2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known at its 1979 founding as the East Asia Petrochemical Industry Conference, it was a combined project of industry associations within [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and [[Taiwan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Asia Yearbook 1980 | publisher = International Publications Service | year = 1980 | isbn = 962-7010-06-5 | page = 126}}&lt;/ref&gt; which northern Asian nations alternated hosting duties. In 2000, the conference was retitled to its current name when [[India]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]] entered the hosting rotation. [[Thailand]] is also currently among the conference's hosts. The 2009 conference hosted in [[Seoul]] was attended by over 850 officials from 28 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Oil products conference to be held in Seoul | work = Korean Herald | author = Lee Yong-sung | date = 2009-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 conference was held on 13 and 14 May in [[Mumbai]] and attended by over 1400 delegates from 40 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cpmaindia.com/index.php/ |title= Chemical and Petrochemical Manufacturers' Association, India (CPMA) | accessdate = 2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Djibouti is one of 29 countries where Scouting exists but where there is no National Scout Organization which is a member of the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]] at the present time,&lt;ref name="scouting elsewhere"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scout.org/en/around_the_world/countries/scouting_elsewhere |title=Scouting Elsewhere |publisher=[[World Organization of the Scout Movement]] |accessdate=2007-03-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312052328/http://www.scout.org/en/around_the_world/countries/scouting_elsewhere |archivedate=12 March 2007 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and no organization was ever recognized by WOSM during the nation's periods of Scouting history.

==History==

Scouting in Djibouti was first served by overseas units of the [[Scouts de France]], a French Scouting organization, even after the independence of the country, for French expatriates stationed in Djibouti in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The meeting hall was the ambassador's house, which was guarded by the [[French military]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thescoutpatchauction.com/scoutpatchwiki/index.php?title=DJIBOUTI&amp;oldid=42307{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Association des Scouts de Djibouti was founded on May 23, 1985. Two [[postage stamp]]s and a [[First day cover]] were issued on that occasion. After a period of growth, Scouting nearly disappeared in Djibouti. Activities were restarted with Leadership Training courses in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title=Le Scoutisme va renaître de ses cendres |url=http://www.rtd.dj/actualites/Scoutisme.htm |work= |publisher=[[Radiodiffusion Télévision Djibouti]] |date=2008-07-05 |accessdate=2008-08-25 |language=French |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731014258/http://www.rtd.dj/actualites/Scoutisme.htm |archivedate=2008-07-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideals==
The [[Scout Motto]] is ''Kun Musta'idan'' or كن مستعدين, translating as ''Be Prepared'' in Arabic and ''Sois Prêt'', translating as ''Be Prepared'' in French. The noun for a single Scout is ''Kashaf'' or كشاف in Arabic.

==International Scouting units==
The French [[Association des Guides et Scouts d'Europe]] (affiliated to the [[Union Internationale des Guides et Scouts d'Europe]]) maintains a Scout unit in Djibouti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scouts-europe.org/accueillir/Outre-Mer.shtml |title=Le scoutisme en outre-mer et à l’étranger |publisher=[[Association des Guides et Scouts d'Europe]] |language=French |accessdate=2008-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Austropop''' is [[pop music]] from [[Austria]], which came into use in the late 1960s, but had its heyday in the 1970s and early and up until the mid 1980s. Austropop comprises several musical styles, from traditional pop music to [[Rock music|rock]], and it also sometimes includes traditional folk elements such as [[yodeling]].

[[Neue Deutsche Welle]] does not count as Austropop, as it was definitely German and the lyrics were in [[Standard German]], while Austropop artists made a distinction by decidedly using Austrian dialects for their lyrics.

The movement is believed to have started in 1971 by [[Wolfgang Ambros]] with his song "[[Da Hofa]]", although this is debated. Ambros became famous, however, by translating songs by [[Bob Dylan]] into Austrian German, the most famous of which is ''"Naa, i bins ned",'' the translation of Dylan's ''"[[It Ain't Me Babe]]".''

Austropop is still broadcast by various FM radio and TV stations throughout Austria and Bavaria, where they even have special nights replaying Austropop concerts.

Artists of the Austropop movement include:
* [[Wolfgang Ambros]]
* [[Georg Danzer]]
* [[Rainhard Fendrich]] (These three also toured together from 1997-2006 as [[Austria3]] or A3.)
* [[Peter Cornelius (musician)|Peter Cornelius]]
* [[DÖF]]
* [[Waterloo &amp; Robinson]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3097">'''Coffee Strong''' is a GI coffeehouse based on the tradition of resistance coffee houses opened during the [[Vietnam war]] by antiwar veterans and active duty soldiers. Based in [[Lakewood, WA]] it was founded in 2008 by veterans returning from the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|wars in Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. It is located within 300 meters of the gates at [[Joint Base Lewis-McChord]]. It is one of three currently active GI resistance coffee houses along with [[Under the Hood Café]] near [[Fort Hood]] in Texas &amp; [[Norfolk Offbase]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. According to Coffee Strong board member Zoltan Grossman&lt;ref&gt;http://www.counterpunch.org/grossman03102009.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; The goal of the G.I. coffeehouse is to provide soldiers, their families and recent vets a place away from the base where they can learn about resources available to them, meet with G.I. rights counselors, and access alternative information. It holds weekly movie nights, and hosts speakers, hiphop, punk and folk concerts, and other events. The response from soldiers visiting the coffeehouse has so far been overwhelmingly positive. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Coffee Strong advisory board includes linguist and dissident [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Marjorie Cohn]], [[Mike Ferner]], [[Eva Golinger]], [[Dahr Jamail]], [[Antonia Juhasz]], [[Ann Wright|Col. Ann Wright (Ret.)]], and the late historian and author [[Howard Zinn]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coffeestrong.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 filmmaker and professor of Folklore and English at the University of Oregon [[Lisa Gilman]] released the film ''[[Grounds for Resistance]]''&lt;ref&gt;http://groundsforresistance.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenewstribune.com/2011/05/13/1663377/find-common-ground-at-gi-coffee.html&lt;/ref&gt; about Coffee Strong and featured interviews by some of its founders and reactions to it from Joint Base Lewis-McChord soldiers.

In [[Switzerland]], '''''Conseil d'État''''' is the name of the council constituting the cantonal government of French-speaking [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]]s. It is not to be confused with the ''Conseil des États'' (or [[Swiss Council of States|Council of ''States'']]) which is a chamber of the Swiss parliament.

'''Austria''' has a well-developed institutional and [[legal system]], and most '''[[corruption]]''' cases under investigation by a [[parliamentary committee]] end with [[judicial]] trials and effective judgments. However, there are several significant [[Austria]]n corruption cases which have taken place during the past decade involving land and [[regional]] officials, high-level public officials, the central government and, in one instance, the former [[Chancellor]].&lt;ref name="business-anti-corruption1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Austria Corruption Profile-Political Climate|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/europe-central-asia/austria/show-all.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases, corrupt practices were related to conflicts of interest, [[abuse]] of office, money [[Money laundering|laundering]] and influence peddling. The corruption [[scandals]] have put into doubt the ethical standards of the political elite.&lt;ref name="business-anti-corruption1"/&gt; This doubt is reflected in the findings of [[Eurobarometer]] 2012, where two-thirds of respondents perceive national [[politicians]] to be corrupt and also the most corrupt institution in Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurobarometer 2012- Austria|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_374_en.pdf|publisher=The European Commission|accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 16th place out of 180 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=Corruption Perceptions Index 2017|last=e.V.|first=Transparency International|date=|work=www.transparency.org|access-date=2017-03-24|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extent==
According to several sources, corruption is not considered a problem for doing business in Austria. According to [https://www.state.gov/e/eb/rls/othr/ics/2013/204595.htm Investment Climate Report 2013] by the US Department of State 2013, corruption is not considered as a serious problem impeding business in Austria. The World Economic Forum’s [http://www.weforum.org/ [[Global Competitiveness Report]] 2013-2014] notes that it is uncommon for companies to make irregular payments or bribes connected with imports and exports, public utilities, annual tax payments, and awarding of public contracts and [[licenses]]. Moreover, corruption is ranked as the twelfth most [[problematic]] factor for doing business in Austria.&lt;ref name="business-anti-corruption1"/&gt;

According to the Global Competitiveness Report 2013-2014, [[In-group favoritism|favouritism]] among government officials towards well-connected companies and individuals is a competitive disadvantage for the country. According to [http://www.transparency.de/fileadmin/pdfs/Themen/Vergabe/Identifying_and_Reducing_Corruption_in_Public_Procurement.pdf Identifying and Reducing Corruption in Public Procurement in the EU 2013], officials involved in public procurement lack effective corruption screening.&lt;ref name="business-anti-corruption1"/&gt;

[[File:Kauphafnir.png|thumb|right|300px|Danish trading posts in [[Iceland]] during the Danish trade monopoly 1602-1786]]
{{History of Iceland}}

The '''Danish–Icelandic Trade Monopoly''' (Icelandic: ''Einokunarverslunin'') was the monopoly on trade held by [[Denmark|Danish]] merchants in [[Iceland]] in the 17th and 18th centuries. Iceland was during this period a territory controlled by the [[Monarchy of Denmark|Danish Crown]]. The origins of the monopoly may be traced to the [[mercantilism|mercantilist]] policies of Denmark, and its aim was to support Danish merchants and Danish trade against the [[Hanseatic League]] of [[Hamburg]], increasing the power of the [[King of Denmark]] in [[Iceland]].

The monopoly was enacted by a set of laws passed in 1602 and lasted until 1786. Trade took place in 20 (later 25) designated trading posts, according to a fixed rate of prices determined by the king. The merchants divided the trading posts between themselves in exchange for a fixed rent. The [[Westman Islands]] were rented at a higher price. Danish merchants were forbidden to participate in economic activities in the country other than trade until 1777.

From 1602 until 1619, the trading monopoly was tied to the Danish cities of [[Copenhagen]], [[Malmö]] (now in [[Sweden]]) and [[Helsingør]]. From 1620, trade was limited to Copenhagen exclusively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1481">The '''Direction générale de la statistique et des études économique (DGSEE)''' is the official [[Statistics|statistical]] service of [[Gabon]], established in its current form in 1976. Its activities are organized within the broader framework of the statistical system of Gabon.
The DGSEE is a branch of the [[Politics of Gabon|central government]] under the authority of the [[Ministry (government department)|Minister]] responsible for Statistics. On 31 May 1983, its powers and organization were identified by a decree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat-gabon.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=54&amp;Itemid=61|title=Statuts et Historique|publisher=Stat-gabon.org|accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very generally, DGSEE is responsible for ensuring the technical coordination of the national statistical system and to disseminate [[statistical data]] for the purposes of the government, private sector, development partners and the public.

==Allegations of assassinations==

In February 2004, [[Christos Pourgourides]] of the [[Council of Europe]]'s [[Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights]] reported concerns suggesting that Dmitri Pavlichenko, along with other "senior officials of the State" had been involved in the assassination of several people, including senior politicians.&lt;ref name="COE_pavlichenko"&gt;{{cite web| last =Pourgourides| first =Christos| authorlink =| author2 =Committee on Legal Affairs| author3 =Human Rights| author4 =[[Council of Europe]]| title =Disappeared persons in Belarus| work =| publisher =[[Council of Europe]]| date =February 2004| url =http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc04/EDOC10062.htm| format =| doi =| accessdate =2007-09-18| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090221075513/http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=%2FDocuments%2FWorkingDocs%2FDoc04%2FEDOC10062.htm| archivedate =2009-02-21| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He stated that the Chief of the Criminal Police of Belarus, General Lapatik, in a handwritten note on November 21, 2000, accused Dmitri Pavlichenko of assassinating [[Jury Zacharanka]], a former Minister of the Interior who [[forced disappearance|disappeared]] on May 7, 1999, with a [[PB pistol]], normally used for carrying out the [[capital punishment in Belarus|death penalty]] at [[Minsk Detention Center No. 1|SIZO-1 prison]], officially signed out from SIZO-1 on the orders of the Minister of the Interior, Sivakov. He also stated suspicions that Pavlichenko was involved in the [[forced disappearance|disappearances]] of [[Victor Gonchar]], Vice-President of the [[Parliament of Belarus]] and businessman Anatoly Krasovski on September 16, 1999.

Pavlichenko was arrested on November 22, 2000. According to Pourgourides' report, the warrant stated (translation) {{quote|The materials of the operational investigation contain trustworthy data confirming that Dmitry Vasiliyevich Pavlichenko is the organiser and head of a criminal body engaged in abduction and physical elimination of people. In particular, the criminal group headed by D.V. Pavlichenko was involved in assassinating G. V. Samoylov, the leader of the RNE, Belarusian unregistered regional organisation, as well as in murdering other individuals. Taking into consideration the fact that D.V. Pavlichenko and his criminal group may commit further crimes of particular violence, [...], decided [to apply a preventive detention for 30 days].|Chief of the [[State Security Agency of the Republic of Belarus|Belarusian KGB]], [[Vladimir Matskevich]]|&lt;ref name="COE_pavlichenko" /&gt;}}

While the warrant stated that the detention would be for 30 days, Pavlichenko was released a few days later, either on November 23 (according to Prosecutor General [[Viktor Sheyman]], who became Prosecutor General on November 27) or on November 27 (according to Colonel [[Oleg Alkayev]], head of SIZO-1 at the time, who later was accepted for political [[Asylum in Germany|asylum in]] [[Germany]]). Pourgourides states that the Zakharenko family's lawyer, Volchek, stated that President [[Alexander Lukashenko]] had personally ordered Pavlichenko's release from prison. He also states that the Minister of Agriculture, Leonov, had personally told him that Lukashenko had "violently criticised the KGB for arresting Pavlichenko" on television. 

The Governing Council of the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] has expressed its concern about these allegations&lt;ref name="ipu_pavlichenko"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| title =CASE No BLS/05 - VICTOR GONCHAR: Resolution adopted by the Governing Council at its 176th session (Manila, 8th April 2005)| work =| publisher =[[Inter-Parliamentary Union]]| date = 2005-04-08| url =http://www.ipu.org/hr-e/176/Bls05.htm |format =| doi =| accessdate =2007-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Pavlichenko is now subject to international financial sanctions among with several other Belarusian senior officials and politicians.&lt;ref name="bank_eng_pavlichenko"&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |title=Consolidated List of Financial Sanctions Targets in the UK |work= |publisher=[[Bank of England]] |date=2006-10-25 |url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/financialsanctions/regimes/belarus.htm |format= |doi= |accessdate=2007-09-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712232609/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/financialsanctions/regimes/belarus.htm |archivedate=2007-07-12 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2804">There have been several seasons of '''drought in [[Afghanistan]]''' in recent decades. According to an analysis of climate and drought records [[Asia Development Bank]], localized droughts have a periodicity of three to five years, and droughts covering large areas recur every 9-11 years.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} South and central areas are more affected from July through September. 
 
Afghanistan began experiencing unusual droughts beginning in 1995, right after the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|Taliban]] emerged. It remained this way until heavy snow began falling in the 2002-2003 winter season, after the new [[Presidency of Hamid Karzai|Karzai administration]] took over. This relief did not last long as the country began to see more droughts in the coming years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/world/afghanistan-drought-will-become-disaster-without-aid-oxfam-says-61832.html Afghanistan Drought Will Become Disaster Without Aid, Oxfam Says] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105182147/http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/world/afghanistan-drought-will-become-disaster-without-aid-oxfam-says-61832.html |date=January 5, 2012 }} by Jack Phillips for [[Epoch Times]]. September 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Drought combined with conflict has created internally displaced populations that are living in extremely poor conditions. Many communities continue to depend on meager incomes derived by migrating outside their farmlands.&lt;ref name="upi"&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2011/10/06/Severe-drought-hits-Afghanistan/UPI-18541317904385/ Severe drought hits Afghanistan]. October 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Inadequate rains and snowfall during 2008 to 2010 in parts of Afghanistan caused significant failure of the rain-fed crops in the country's six provinces: [[Herat Province|Herat]], [[Jawzjan Province|Jawzjan]], [[Balkh Province|Balkh]], [[Badghis Province|Badghis]], [[Faryab Province|Faryab]] and [[Sar-e-Pul Province|Sar-e-Pul]]. The situation affected the most vulnerable populations and their access to food and water, reducing communities' health and nutrition status.&lt;ref name="upi"/&gt; However, in 2012 Afghanistan's long drought has ended due to heavy snow.&lt;ref&gt;ABC News Australia, [http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-03-10/death-toll-from-afghan-avalanches-rises-to-56/3881862 145 'presumed dead' in Afghan avalanche]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toponymy{{Anchor|Etymology}}==&lt;!--linked--&gt;
{{See also|Toponymy of England}}
The name "England" is derived from the [[Old English]] name ''Englaland'', which means "land of the [[Angles]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=England |title=England |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Angles were one of the [[Germanic tribes]] that settled in Great Britain during the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The Angles came from the [[Anglia (peninsula)|Anglia]] peninsula in the [[Bay of Kiel]] area (present-day German state of [[Schleswig–Holstein]]) of the [[Baltic Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ripley|1869|p=570}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest recorded use of the term, as "Engla londe", is in the late-ninth-century translation into [[Old English]] of [[Bede]]'s ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]''. The term was then used in a different sense to the modern one, meaning "the land inhabited by the English", and it included English people in what is now south-east Scotland but was then part of the English kingdom of [[Northumbria]]. The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' recorded that the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 covered the whole of England, meaning the English kingdom, but a few years later the ''Chronicle'' stated that King [[Malcolm III]] went "out of Scotlande into [[Lothian]] in Englaland", thus using it in the more ancient sense.{{sfn|Molyneaux|2015|pp=6–7}} According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', its modern spelling was first used in 1538.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/62243 |title=England |publisher=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest attested reference to the Angles occurs in the 1st-century work by [[Tacitus]], ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', in which the [[Latin]] word ''Anglii'' is used.&lt;ref name="Fordham"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/tacitus-germanygord.html |title=Germania |publisher=[[Tacitus]] |accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The etymology of the tribal name itself is disputed by scholars; it has been suggested that it derives from the shape of the Angeln peninsula, an ''angular'' shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50075354?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=Angle&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10 |title=Angle |publisher=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |accessdate=5 September 2009}}{{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; How and why a term derived from the name of a tribe that was less significant than others, such as the [[Saxons]], came to be used for the entire country and its people is not known, but it seems this is related to the custom of calling the Germanic people in Britain ''Angli Saxones'' or English Saxons to distinguish them from continental Saxons (Eald-Seaxe) of Old Saxony between Weser and Eider rivers in Northern Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crystal|2004| pp=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Scottish Gaelic]], another language which developed on the island of Great Britain, the Saxon tribe gave their name to the word for England (''Sasunn'');&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Forbes |first=John |title=The Principles of Gaelic Grammar |year=1848 |publisher=Oliver, Boyd and Tweeddale |location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; similarly, the Welsh name for the English language is "''Saesneg''".

An alternative name for England is [[Albion]]. The name ''Albion'' originally referred to the entire island of Great Britain. The nominally earliest record of the name appears in the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[Corpus Aristotelicum|Corpus]], specifically the 4th-century BC ''[[On the Cosmos|De Mundo]]'':&lt;ref name="massey"&gt;{{harvnb|Massey|2007|p=440}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Beyond the [[Pillars of Hercules]] is the ocean that flows round the earth. In it are two very large islands called Britannia; these are Albion and [[Ireland|Ierne]]".&lt;ref name="massey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ArOntheCosmos"&gt;[[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|"...&amp;nbsp;ἐν τούτῳ γε μὴν νῆσοι μέγιστοι τυγχάνουσιν οὖσαι δύο, Βρεττανικαὶ λεγόμεναι, Ἀλβίων καὶ Ἰέρνη,&amp;nbsp;...", transliteration "...&amp;nbsp;en toutoi ge men nesoi megistoi tynchanousin ousai dyo, Brettanikai legomenai, Albion kai Ierne,&amp;nbsp;..."}}, translation "...&amp;nbsp;There are two very large islands in it, called the British Isles, Albion and Ierne;&amp;nbsp;..."; {{cite book |last=[[Aristotle]] or [[Pseudo-Aristotle]]|translator-first1=E.

The word ''Albion'' (Ἀλβίων) or ''insula Albionum'' has two possible origins. It either derives from a cognate of the Latin ''albus'' meaning white, a reference to the [[white cliffs of Dover]] (the only part of Britain visible from the European mainland)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Room|2006|p=23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or from the phrase the "island of the ''Albiones''"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Major|2004|p=84}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in the now lost ''[[Massaliote Periplus]]'', that is attested through [[Avienus]]' ''Ora Maritima''&lt;ref&gt;[[Avienus]]' ''Ora Maritima'', verses 111–112, i.e. ''eamque late gens Hiernorum colit; propinqua rursus insula Albionum patet''.&lt;/ref&gt; to which the former presumably served as a source. ''Albion'' is now applied to England in a more poetic capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Foster|1988|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another romantic name for England is [[Lloegyr|Loegria]], related to the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] word for England, ''Lloegr'', and made popular by its use in [[Arthurian legend]].

After the last [[Last glacial period|ice age]] only large mammals such as [[mammoth]]s, [[bison]] and [[woolly rhinoceros]] remained.

During the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]], [[Celts|Celtic culture]], deriving from the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] and [[La Tène culture]]s, arrived from Central Europe. [[British language (Celtic)|Brythonic]] was the spoken language during this time. Society was tribal; according to [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geographia]]'' there were around 20 tribes in the area. Earlier divisions are unknown because the Britons were not literate. Like other regions on the edge of the Empire, Britain had long enjoyed trading links with the Romans. Julius Caesar of the [[Roman Republic]] attempted to [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|invade twice]] in 55&amp;nbsp;BC; although largely unsuccessful, he managed to set up a [[Roman client kingdoms in Britain|client king]] from the [[Trinovantes]].

The Romans invaded Britain in 43 AD during the reign of Emperor [[Claudius]], subsequently [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquering much of Britain]], and the area was incorporated into the Roman Empire as [[Britannia province]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,406152,00.html |title=Dig uncovers Boudicca's brutal streak |accessdate=5 September 2009 |work=The Observer |location=London |first=Jason |last=Burke |date=2 December 2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031022061846/http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0%2C6903%2C406152%2C00.html |archivedate=22 October 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The best-known of the native tribes who attempted to resist were the [[Catuvellauni]] led by [[Caratacus]].

There is debate about when Christianity was first introduced; it was no later than the 4th century, probably much earlier. According to [[Bede]], missionaries were sent from Rome by [[Pope Eleuterus|Eleutherius]] at the request of the chieftain [[Lucius of Britain]] in 180 AD, to settle differences as to Eastern and Western ceremonials, which were disturbing the church. There are traditions linked to Glastonbury claiming an introduction through [[Joseph of Arimathea]], while others claim through [[Lucius of Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2008|p=143}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By 410, during the [[Decline of the Roman Empire]], Britain was left exposed by the [[end of Roman rule in Britain]] and the withdrawal of Roman army units, to defend the frontiers in continental Europe and partake in civil wars.&lt;ref name="james_anglosaxons" /&gt; Celtic Christian monastic and missionary movements flourished: [[Saint Patrick|Patrick]] (5th-century Ireland) and in the 6th century Brendan (Clonfert), Comgall (Bangor), David (Wales), Aiden (Lindisfarne) and Columba (Iona). This period of Christianity was influenced by ancient Celtic culture in its sensibilities, polity, practices and theology. Local "congregations" were centred in the monastic community and monastic leaders were more like chieftains, as peers, rather than in the more hierarchical system of the Roman-dominated church.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Early Christian Christianity'', Brendan Lehane, Constable, London: John Murray Ltd., 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Military of ancient Rome|Roman military]] withdrawals left Britain open to invasion by pagan, seafaring warriors from north-western continental Europe, chiefly the Saxons, [[Angles]], [[Jutes]] and Frisians who had long raided the coasts of the Roman province and began to settle, initially in the eastern part of the country.&lt;ref name="james_anglosaxons"&gt;{{cite web |title=Overview: Anglo-Saxons, 410 to 800 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/anglo_saxons/overview_anglo_saxons_01.shtml |publisher=BBC |accessdate=3 December 2010 |first=Edward |last=James}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their advance was contained for some decades after the Britons' victory at the [[Battle of Badon|Battle of Mount Badon]], but subsequently resumed, over-running the fertile lowlands of Britain and reducing the area under [[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]] control to a series of separate enclaves in the more rugged country to the west by the end of the 6th century. Contemporary texts describing this period are extremely scarce, giving rise to its description as a [[Dark Age]]. The nature and progression of the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]] is consequently subject to considerable disagreement. Roman-dominated Christianity had, in general, disappeared from the conquered territories, but was reintroduced by missionaries from Rome led by [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]] from 597 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Christian Tradition |url=http://www.picturesofengland.com/history/england-history-p4.html |publisher=PicturesofEngland.com |accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disputes between the Roman- and Celtic-dominated forms of Christianity ended in victory for the Roman tradition at the [[Council of Whitby]] (664), which was ostensibly about haircuts and the date of Easter, but more significantly, about the differences in Roman and Celtic forms of authority, theology, and practice (Lehane).

During the settlement period the lands ruled by the incomers seem to have been fragmented into numerous tribal territories, but by the 7th century, when substantial evidence of the situation again becomes available, these had coalesced into roughly a dozen kingdoms including [[Northumbria]], [[Mercia]], [[Wessex]], [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]], [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]], [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]] and [[Kingdom of Sussex|Sussex]]. Over the following centuries, this process of political consolidation continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kirby|2000|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 7th century saw a struggle for hegemony between Northumbria and Mercia, which in the 8th century gave way to Mercian preeminence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lyon|1960|p=23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 9th century Mercia was displaced as the foremost kingdom by Wessex. Later in that century escalating attacks by the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] culminated in the conquest of the north and east of England, overthrowing the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and East Anglia. Wessex under [[Alfred the Great]] was left as the only surviving English kingdom, and under his successors, it steadily expanded at the expense of the kingdoms of the [[Danelaw]]. This brought about the political unification of England, first accomplished under [[Æthelstan]] in 927 and definitively established after further conflicts by [[Eadred]] in 953. A fresh wave of Scandinavian attacks from the late 10th century ended with the conquest of this united kingdom by [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] in 1013 and again by his son [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]] in 1016, turning it into the centre of a short-lived [[North Sea Empire]] that also included [[Kingdom of Denmark|Denmark]] and [[Norway]]. However, the native royal dynasty was restored with the accession of [[Edward the Confessor]] in 1042.

Subsequently, the [[House of Plantagenet]] from Anjou inherited the English throne under [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], adding England to the budding [[Angevin Empire]] of fiefs the family had inherited in France including [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]].&lt;ref name="bartlett"&gt;{{harvnb|Bartlett|1999|p=124}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They reigned for three centuries, some noted monarchs being [[Richard I of England|Richard I]], [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] and [[Henry V of England|Henry V]].&lt;ref name="bartlett" /&gt; The period saw changes in trade and legislation, including the signing of the ''[[Magna Carta]]'', an English legal charter used to limit the sovereign's powers by law and protect the privileges of freemen. Catholic [[monasticism]] flourished, providing philosophers, and the universities of Oxford and Cambridge were founded with royal patronage.

[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] broke from communion with the Catholic Church, over issues relating to his divorce, under the [[Acts of Supremacy]] in 1534 which proclaimed the monarch head of the [[Church of England]]. In contrast with much of European Protestantism, the [[English Reformation|roots of the split]] were more political than theological.{{refn|As [[Roger Scruton]] explains, "The Reformation must not be confused with the changes introduced into the Church of England during the 'Reformation Parliament' of 1529–36, which were of a political rather than a religious nature, designed to unite the secular and religious sources of authority within a single sovereign power: the Anglican Church did not make substantial change in doctrine until later."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scruton|1982|p=470}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} He also legally incorporated his ancestral land Wales into the Kingdom of England with the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542|1535–1542 acts]]. There were internal religious conflicts during the reigns of Henry's daughters, [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. The former took the country back to Catholicism while the latter broke from it again, forcefully asserting the supremacy of [[Anglicanism]].

Competing with [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], the first English colony in the Americas was founded in 1585 by explorer [[Walter Raleigh]] in [[Virginia]] and named [[Roanoke Colony|Roanoke]]. The Roanoke colony failed and is known as the lost colony after it was found abandoned on the return of the late-arriving supply ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ordahl |first=Karen |url=https://books.google.com/?id=W8cr4Vgt9ekC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=roanoke+colony#v=onepage |title=Roanak:the abandoned colony |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield publishers Inc |accessdate=24 December 2010 |isbn=978-0-7425-5263-0 |date=25 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[East India Company]], England also competed with the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] and [[French colonial empire|French]] in the East. During the [[Elizabethan period]], England was at war with Spain. An [[Spanish Armada|armada]] sailed from Spain in 1588 as part of a wider plan to invade England and re-establish a Catholic monarchy. The plan was thwarted by bad coordination, stormy weather and successful harrying attacks by an English fleet under [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Lord Howard of Effingham]]. This failure did not end the threat: Spain launched two further armadas, in [[2nd Spanish Armada|1596]] and [[3rd Spanish Armada|1597]], but both were driven back by storms. The political structure of the island changed in 1603, when the [[King of Scots]], [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]], a kingdom which had been a long-time rival to English interests, inherited the throne of England as [[James VI and I|James I]], thereby creating a [[Union of the Crowns|personal union]].&lt;ref name="Britons"&gt;{{harvnb|Colley|1992|p=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Making the Act of Union |url=http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/01_background.html |publisher=Parliament.uk |accessdate=5 September 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609075346/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/01_background.html |archivedate=9 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He styled himself [[King of Great Britain]], although this had no basis in English law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_089/89_055_066.pdf |title=The term "Great Britain" in the Middle Ages |last=Hay |first=Denys |publisher=ads.ahds.ac.uk |accessdate=19 February 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325061737/http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_089/89_055_066.pdf |archivedate=25 March 2009 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the auspices of King James VI and I the Authorised [[King James Version]] of the Holy Bible was published in 1611.

Based on conflicting political, religious and social positions, the [[English Civil War]] was fought between the supporters of [[Long Parliament|Parliament]] and those of King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], known colloquially as [[Roundhead]]s and [[Cavalier]]s respectively. This was an interwoven part of the wider multifaceted [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], involving [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]]. The Parliamentarians were victorious, Charles I was executed and the kingdom replaced by the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]].

After the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, it was constitutionally established that King and Parliament should rule together, though Parliament would have the real power. This was established with the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] in 1689. Among the statutes set down were that the law could only be made by Parliament and could not be suspended by the King, also that the King could not impose taxes or raise an army without the prior approval of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=mPoqfoiIp4sC&amp;pg=PA340&amp;lpg=PA340&amp;dq=with+the+restoration+it+was+not+constitutionally+established+that+king+and+parliament+should+rule+together#v=onepage |title=World Civilization |author1=Philip J.

In Parliament two factions had emerged – the [[Tory|Tories]] and [[Whig (British political faction)|Whigs]]. Though the Tories initially supported Catholic king [[James II of England|James II]], some of them, along with the Whigs, during the [[Glorious Revolution|Revolution of 1688]] invited Dutch prince William of Orange to defeat James and ultimately to become [[William III of England]]. Some English people, especially in the north, were [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]] and continued to support James and his sons. After the parliaments of England and Scotland agreed,&lt;ref name="unionwithscotland" /&gt; the two countries joined in [[political union]], to create the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] in 1707.&lt;ref name="Britons" /&gt; To accommodate the union, institutions such as the law and national churches of each remained separate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gallagher|2006|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally it was planned that various [[regions of England]] would be devolved, but following the proposal's rejection by the [[North East England|North East]] in a referendum, this has not been carried out.&lt;ref name="refreject" /&gt;

One major issue is the [[West Lothian question]], in which MPs from Scotland and Wales are able to vote on legislation affecting only England, while English MPs have no equivalent right to legislate on devolved matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=West Lothian question |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7702326.stm |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=5 September 2009 |date=31 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This when placed in the context of England being the only country of the United Kingdom not to have free cancer treatment, prescriptions, residential care for the elderly and [[top-up fees|free top-up university fees]],&lt;ref name="msnmoney"&gt;{{cite web |title=Are Scottish people better off? |url=http://money.uk.msn.com/consumer/article.aspx?cp-documentid=6543296 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417222726/http://money.uk.msn.com/consumer/article.aspx?cp-documentid=6543296 |archivedate=17 April 2008 |publisher=MSN Money |accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; has led to a steady rise in [[English nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=English nationalism 'threat to UK' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/596703.stm |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=5 September 2009 |date=9 January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have suggested the creation of a [[devolved English parliament]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gordon Brown pressed on English parliament |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article4061785.ece |work=The Times |location=London |accessdate=5 September 2009 |first=Lorraine |last=Davidson |date=3 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others have proposed simply limiting voting on legislation which only affects England to English MPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=English votes for English laws' plan by Tories |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/english-votes-for-english-laws-plan-by-tories-857647.html |accessdate=5 September 2009 |work=The Independent |location=London |first=Andrew |last=Grice |date=1 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law ===
{{Main|English law}}
[[File:Royal courts of justice.jpg|thumb|alt=Ornate grey stone building.|right|The [[Royal Courts of Justice]]]]
The [[English law]] legal system, developed over the centuries, is the basis of [[common law]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=248 |title=Common Law |publisher=ALM Media Properties |website=The People's Law Dictionary |accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; legal systems used in most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~law/ASLH/conferences/2000conference/101900345b.htm |title=The Common Law in the British Empire |publisher=H-net.msu.edu |date=19 October 2000 |accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States (except [[Louisiana]]). Despite now being part of the United Kingdom, the legal system of the [[Courts of England and Wales]] continued, under the [[Treaty of Union]], as a separate legal system from the one used in Scotland. The general essence of English law is that it is made by judges sitting in courts, applying their common sense and knowledge of [[legal precedent]] – ''[[stare decisis]]'' – to the facts before them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fafinski|2007|p=60}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Courts of England and Wales|court system]] is headed by the Senior Courts of England and Wales, consisting of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], the [[High Court of Justice]] for civil cases, and the [[Crown Court]] for criminal cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fafinski|2007|p=127}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] is the highest court for criminal and civil cases in [[England and Wales]]. It was created in 2009 after constitutional changes, taking over the [[judicial functions of the House of Lords]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Constitutional reform: A Supreme Court for the United Kingdom |url=http://www.dca.gov.uk/consult/supremecourt/supreme.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=DCA.gov.uk |accessdate=5 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090117132005/http://www.dca.gov.uk/consult/supremecourt/supreme.pdf |archivedate=17 January 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A decision of the Supreme Court is binding on every other court in the hierarchy, which must follow its directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fafinski|2007|p=67}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Crime increased between 1981 and 1995 but fell by 42% in the period 1995–2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Crime over the last 25 years |url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs07/crime0607summ.pdf |publisher=HomeOffice.gov.uk |accessdate=5 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324214809/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs07/crime0607summ.pdf |archivedate=24 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prison population doubled over the same period, giving it the [[List of countries by incarceration rate|highest incarceration rate]] in Western Europe at 147 per 100,000.&lt;ref name="crimebbc"&gt;{{cite news |title=New record high prison population |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7235438.stm |work=BBC News |accessdate=5 September 2009 |date=8 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Her Majesty's Prison Service]], reporting to the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]], manages most [[prisons in England|prisons]], housing over 85,000 convicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/statistics/prisons-and-probation/prison-population-figures |title=Prison population figures |accessdate=11 December 2012 |year=2012 |publisher=Ministry Of Justice |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116012752/http://www.justice.gov.uk/statistics/prisons-and-probation/prison-population-figures |archivedate=16 November 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[subdivisions of England]] consist of up to four levels of [[administrative division|subnational division]] controlled through a variety of types of administrative entities created for the purposes of [[local government in England|local government]]. The highest tier of local government were the nine [[regions of England]]: [[North East England|North East]], [[North West England|North West]], [[Yorkshire and the Humber]], [[East Midlands]], [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], [[East of England|East]], [[South East England|South East]], [[South West England|South West]], and London. These were created in 1994 as [[Government Office]]s, used by the UK government to deliver a wide range of policies and programmes regionally, but there are no elected bodies at this level, except in London, and in 2011 the regional government offices were abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tiers shed as regional government offices disappear |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/mar/29/regional-government-disappears-1500-jobs-lost |work=The Guardian |accessdate=16 June 2011 |location=London |first=Hilary |last=Cooper |date=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same boundaries remain in use for electing [[Members of the European Parliament]] on a regional basis.

After [[devolution]] began to take place in other parts of the United Kingdom it was planned that referendums for the regions of England would take place for their own elected [[Regional Assemblies in England|regional assemblies]] as a counterweight. [[Greater London Authority referendum, 1998|London accepted]] in 1998: the [[London Assembly]] was created two years later. However, when the proposal was rejected by the [[northern England devolution referendums, 2004]] in the North East, further referendums were cancelled.&lt;ref name="refreject"&gt;{{cite news |title=Prescott's dream in tatters as North East rejects assembly |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article503255.ece |work=The Times |location=London |accessdate=5 September 2009 |first=Jill |last=Sherman |author2=Andrew Norfolk |date=5 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regional assemblies outside London were abolished in 2010, and their functions transferred to respective [[Regional Development Agency|Regional Development Agencies]] and a new system of [[Local authority leaders' boards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prosperous Places |url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/citiesandregions/pdf/1073344.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ln5KtF1u?url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/citiesandregions/pdf/1073344.pdf |archivedate=5 December 2009 |publisher=communities.gov.uk |accessdate=5 September 2009 |author=Department for Communities and Local Government |authorlink=Department for Communities and Local Government |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below the regional level, all of England is divided into 48 [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial counties]].&lt;ref name="britannicagov"&gt;{{harvnb|Encyclopædia Britannica|2002|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are used primarily as a geographical frame of reference and have developed gradually since the [[Middle Ages]], with some established as recently as 1974.&lt;ref name="maud"&gt;{{harvnb|Redcliffe-Maud|Wood|1974}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Each has a [[Lord Lieutenant]] and [[High Sheriff]]; these posts are used to represent the [[British monarch]] locally.&lt;ref name="britannicagov" /&gt; Outside [[Greater London]] and the [[Isles of Scilly]], England is also divided into 83 [[Metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties]]; these correspond to areas used for the purposes of local government&lt;ref name="localgov"&gt;{{harvnb|Singh|2009|p=53}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and may consist of a single district or be divided into several.

There are six [[metropolitan county|metropolitan counties]] based on the most heavily urbanised areas, which do not have county councils.&lt;ref name="localgov" /&gt; In these areas the principal authorities are the councils of the subdivisions, the [[metropolitan borough]]s. Elsewhere, 27 [[non-metropolitan county|non-metropolitan "shire" counties]] have a [[county council]] and are divided into districts, each with a district council. They are typically, though not always, found in more rural areas. The remaining non-metropolitan counties are of a single district and usually correspond to large towns or sparsely populated counties; they are known as [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authorities]]. Greater London has a different system for local government, with 32 [[London borough]]s, plus the [[City of London]] covering a small area at the core governed by the [[City of London Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Axford|2002|p=315}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the most localised level, much of England is divided into [[civil parishes in England|civil parishes]] with [[Parish councils in England|councils]]; in Greater London only one, [[Queen's Park, London|Queen's Park]], exists [[Queen's Park, London#Governance|as of 2014]] after they were [[London Government Act 1963|abolished in 1965]] until legislation [[Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007|allowed their recreation]] in 2007.

[[File:Keswick Panorama - Oct 2009.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=Blue lake between green hills.|right|[[Skiddaw]] massif, seen from [[Walla Crag]] in the [[Lake District]]]]

Geographically England includes the central and southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain, plus such offshore islands as the [[Isle of Wight]] and the [[Isles of Scilly]]. It is bordered by two other countries of the United Kingdom: [[Anglo Scottish border|to the north]] by Scotland and [[Wales-England border|to the west]] by Wales. England is closer to the European continent than any other part of mainland Britain. It is separated from [[France]] ([[Hauts-de-France]]) by a {{convert|21|mi|adj=on}}&lt;ref name="Engchannel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/187921/English-Channel |title=English Channel |year=2009 |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |publisher=britannica.com |accessdate=15 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; sea gap, though the two countries are connected by the [[Channel Tunnel]] near [[Folkestone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.eurotunnel.com/ukcP3Main/ukcCorporate/ukcAboutUs/ukm/history.htm |publisher=EuroTunnel.com |accessdate=5 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081116055538/http://www.eurotunnel.com/ukcP3Main/ukcCorporate/ukcAboutUs/ukm/history.htm |archivedate=16 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; England also has shores on the [[Irish Sea]], [[North Sea]] and Atlantic Ocean.

The ports of London, [[Liverpool]], and [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] lie on the tidal rivers [[River Thames|Thames]], [[River Mersey|Mersey]] and [[River Tyne|Tyne]] respectively. At {{convert|220|mi}}, the [[River Severn|Severn]] is the longest river flowing through England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/england/sevenwonders/west/severn-river/ |publisher=BBC |title=The River Severn |accessdate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It empties into the [[Bristol Channel]] and is notable for its [[Severn Bore]] (a [[tidal bore]]), which can reach {{convert|2|m|ft}} in height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/recreation/31439.aspx |title=Severn Bore and Trent Aegir |publisher=Environment Agency |accessdate=5 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122125420/http://environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/recreation/31439.aspx |archivedate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the longest river entirely in England is the Thames, which is {{convert|215|mi}} in length.&lt;ref name="Thames"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-home/related-139-94056-articles-reviews/River+Thames-London+(England)/related.do |title=River Thames and London (England) |website=London Evening Standard |location=London |accessdate=17 August 2009 |df=}}{{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many [[lakes in England]]; the largest is [[Windermere]], within the aptly named [[Lake District]].&lt;ref name="metoffice_nw"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/nw/ |title=North West England &amp; Isle of Man: climate |publisher=Met Office |accessdate=5 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605003213/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/nw/ |archivedate=5 June 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of England's landscape consists of low hills and plains, with upland and mountainous terrain in the north and west of the country. The northern uplands include the [[Pennines]], a chain of uplands dividing east and west, the Lake District mountains in Cumbria, and the [[Cheviot Hills]], straddling the border between England and Scotland. The highest point in England, at {{convert|978|m|ft}}, is [[Scafell Pike]] in the Lake District.&lt;ref name="metoffice_nw" /&gt; The [[Shropshire Hills]] are near Wales while [[Dartmoor]] and [[Exmoor]] are two upland areas in the south-west of the country. The approximate dividing line between terrain types is often indicated by the [[Tees-Exe line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Regional Geography|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yAgGHnENHjoC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=tees+exe+line+england+lowland+upland#v=onepage&amp;q=tees%20exe%20line%20england%20lowland%20upland|website=Google Books|publisher=Joseph J.

[[File:Widecombe in the Moor, Devon.jpg|thumb|alt=Green hills with trees in the foreground.|right|Terrain of [[Dartmoor]], Devon]]
In geological terms, the Pennines, known as the "backbone of England", are the oldest range of mountains in the country, originating from the end of the [[Paleozoic Era]] around 300&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.summitpost.org/area/range/220026/pennines.html |title=Pennines |publisher=Smmit Post |accessdate=8 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their geological composition includes, among others, [[sandstone]] and [[limestone]], and also coal. There are [[karst]] landscapes in calcite areas such as parts of Yorkshire and [[Derbyshire]]. The Pennine landscape is high [[moorland]] in upland areas, indented by fertile valleys of the region's rivers. They contain two [[national parks in England|national parks]], the [[Yorkshire Dales]] and the [[Peak District]]. In the [[West Country]], Dartmoor and Exmoor of the Southwest Peninsula include upland moorland supported by granite, and enjoy a [[Climate of south-west England|mild climate]]; both are national parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/aboutus |title=National Parks&amp;nbsp;– About us |publisher=nationalparks.gov.uk |accessdate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[English Lowlands beech forests|English Lowlands]] are in the central and southern regions of the country, consisting of green rolling hills, including the [[Cotswold Hills]], [[Chiltern Hills]], [[North Downs|North]] and [[South Downs]]; where they meet the sea they form white rock exposures such as the [[cliffs of Dover]]. This also includes relatively flat plains such as the [[Salisbury Plain]], [[Somerset Levels]], [[South Coast Plain]] and [[The Fens]].

The [[Greater London Built-up Area]] is by far the largest urban area in England&lt;ref name="BUA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/articles/747.aspx |title=2011 Census – Built-up areas |website= |publisher=[[Office for National Statistics|ONS]] |accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the busiest cities in the world.

The [[Department for Transport]] is the government body responsible for overseeing transport in England. There are many [[List of motorways in the United Kingdom|motorways in England]], and many other trunk roads, such as the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1 Great North Road]], which runs through eastern England from London to Newcastle&lt;ref name="roads"&gt;{{harvnb|UK Parliament|2007|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; (much of this section is motorway) and onward to the Scottish border. The longest motorway in England is the [[M6 motorway|M6]], from [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]] through the [[North West England|North West]] up to the [[Anglo-Scottish border]], a distance of {{convert|232|mi}}.&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt; Other major routes include: the [[M1 motorway|M1]] from London to Leeds, the [[M25 motorway|M25]] which encircles London, the [[M60 motorway|M60]] which encircles Manchester, the [[M4 motorway|M4]] from London to South Wales, the [[M62 motorway|M62]] from Liverpool via Manchester to East Yorkshire, and the [[M5 motorway|M5]] from Birmingham to Bristol and the South West.&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt;

Bus transport across the country is widespread; major companies include [[National Express]], [[Arriva]] and [[Go-Ahead Group]]. The red [[double-decker bus]]es in London have become a symbol of England. There is a [[rapid transit]] network in two English cities: the [[London Underground]]; and the [[Tyne and Wear Metro]] in Newcastle, Gateshead and Sunderland.&lt;ref name="pubwhite"&gt;{{harvnb|White|2002|p=63}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are several tram networks, such as the [[Blackpool tramway]], [[Manchester Metrolink]], [[Sheffield Supertram]] and [[Midland Metro]], and the [[Tramlink]] system centred on Croydon in South London.&lt;ref name="pubwhite" /&gt;
[[File:Farringdon station MMB 22 S-Stock.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Metropolitan Railway]], now part of the [[London Underground]] was the first underground railway in the world]]

[[Rail transport in England]] is the oldest in the world: passenger railways originated in England in 1825.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moorerail.com/history/timeline1825.asp |title=27 September 1825&amp;nbsp;– Opening of the Stockton and Darlington Railway |publisher=The Stockton and Darlington Railway |accessdate=5 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007035746/http://www.moorerail.com/history/timeline1825.asp |archivedate=7 October 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of Britain's {{convert|10000|mi}} of rail network lies in England, covering the country fairly extensively, although a high proportion of railway lines were closed in the second half of the 20th century. There are plans to reopen lines such as the [[Varsity Line]] between Oxford and Cambridge. These lines are mostly standard gauge ([[single track (rail)|single]], [[double track|double]] or [[quadruple track]]) though there are also a few [[British narrow gauge railways|narrow gauge lines]]. There is rail transport access to France and Belgium through an undersea rail link, the [[Channel Tunnel]], which was completed in 1994.

England has extensive domestic and international aviation links. The largest airport is [[Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]], which is the [[World's busiest airports by international passenger traffic|world's busiest airport measured by number of international passengers]].&lt;ref name="wsj230211"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20110223-710213.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yo0OE2ky?url=http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20110223-710213.html |archivedate=19 May 2011 |title=Delta Expects New Slots To Foster Growth At Heathrow Airport |accessdate=23 March 2011 |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=23 February 2011 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other large airports include [[Manchester Airport]], [[Stansted Airport]], [[Luton Airport]] and [[Birmingham Airport]].&lt;ref name="airports" /&gt; By sea there is ferry transport, both local and international, including to Ireland, the Netherlands and Belgium.&lt;ref name="waterworks"&gt;{{harvnb|Else|2007|p=781}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are around {{convert|4400|mi}} of navigable waterways in England, half of which is owned by the [[Canal and River Trust]],&lt;ref name="waterworks" /&gt; however, water transport is very limited. The [[river Thames|Thames]] is the major waterway in England, with imports and exports focused at the [[Port of Tilbury]] in the Thames Estuary, one of the United Kingdom's three major ports.&lt;ref name="waterworks" /&gt;

The [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] (NHS) is the [[Socialised medicine|publicly funded healthcare system]] in England responsible for providing the majority of healthcare in the country. The NHS began on 5 July 1948, putting into effect the provisions of the [[National Health Service Act 1946]]. It was based on the findings of the [[Beveridge Report]], prepared by economist and social reformer [[William Beveridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/beveridge_william.shtml |title=BBC History on William Beveridge |accessdate=5 September 2009 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NHS is largely funded from general taxation including [[National Insurance]] payments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snsg-00724.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ln5L5oTN?url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snsg-00724.pdf |archivedate=5 December 2009 |title=NHS Expenditure in England |format=PDF |work=House of Commons Library |accessdate=5 September 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it provides most of its services free at the point of use, although there are charges for some people for eye tests, dental care, prescriptions and aspects of personal care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Healthcare/Medicinespharmacyandindustry/Prescriptions/NHScosts/DH_087013 |title=NHS costs and exemptions |work=Department of Health |accessdate=5 September 2009}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As its name suggests, the English language, today spoken by hundreds of millions of people around the world, originated as the language of England, where it remains the principal tongue spoken by 98% of the population.&lt;ref name=CensusEnglish&gt;[http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011/QS205EW/view/2092957699?cols=measures QS205EW – Proficiency in English], ONS 2011 census.

By the 15th century, English was back in fashion among all classes, though much changed; the [[Middle English]] form showed many signs of French influence, both in vocabulary and spelling. During the [[English Renaissance]], many words were coined from Latin and Greek origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Green|2003|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Modern English]] has extended this custom of flexibility when it comes to incorporating words from different languages.

When the modern border between Wales and England was established by the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542]], many Welsh-speaking communities found themselves on the English side of the border.

In the 2011 census, 59.4% of the population of England specified their religion as Christian, 24.7% answered that they had no religion, 5% specified that they were [[Muslim]], while 3.7% of the population belongs to other religions and 7.2% did not give an answer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Table KS209EW 2011 Census: Religion, local authorities in England and Wales |url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/2011censuskeystatisticsforlocalauthoritiesinenglandandwales/r21ewrttableks209ewladv1_tcm77-290705.xls |publisher=Office for National Statistics |date=11 December 2012 |accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christianity is the most widely practised religion in England, as it has been since the Early Middle Ages, although it was first introduced much earlier in Gaelic and Roman times. This [[Celtic Church]] was gradually joined to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] hierarchy following the 6th-century [[Gregorian mission]] to [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]] led by [[Augustine of Canterbury|St&amp;nbsp;Augustine]].

It resulted in a Church that consciously retained a large amount of continuity with the Church of the Patristic and Medieval periods in terms of its use of the catholic creeds, its pattern of ministry, its buildings and aspects of its liturgy, but which also embodied Protestant insights in its theology and in the overall shape of its liturgical practice. The way that this is often expressed is by saying that the Church of England is both 'catholic and reformed.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are [[High Church]] and [[Low Church]] traditions and some Anglicans regard themselves as [[Anglo-Catholics]], following the [[Tractarian movement]]. The monarch of the United Kingdom is the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]], which has around 26&amp;nbsp;million baptised members (of whom the vast majority are not regular churchgoers).

Children who are between the ages of 3 and 5 attend nursery or an [[Early Years Foundation Stage]] reception unit within a primary school. Children between the ages of 5 and 11 attend primary school, and secondary school is attended by those aged between 11 and 16. After finishing compulsory education, students take [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]] examinations. Students may then opt to continue into [[further education]] for two years. [[List of further education colleges in England|Further education colleges]] (particularly [[sixth form colleges]]) often form part of a secondary school site. [[A-level]] examinations are sat by a large number of further education students, and often form the basis of an application to university.

Although most English secondary schools are [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]], in some areas there are selective intake [[grammar school]]s, to which entrance is subject to passing the [[eleven-plus]] exam.

Many ancient [[standing stone]] monuments were erected during the prehistoric period; amongst the best known are [[Stonehenge]], [[Devil's Arrows]], [[Rudston Monolith]] and [[Castlerigg stone circle|Castlerigg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stone-circles.org.uk/stone/index.htm |publisher=Stone-Circles.org.uk |title=The Prehistoric Sites of Great Britain |accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the introduction of [[Ancient Roman architecture]] there was a development of [[basilicas]], [[Roman baths|baths]], [[amphitheaters]], [[triumphal arch]]es, [[villa]]s, [[Roman temple]]s, [[Roman road]]s, [[Roman fort]]s, [[stockade]]s and [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueducts]].&lt;ref name="roman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.castles.me.uk/ancient-roman-architecture-england-wales.htm |publisher=Castles.me.uk |title=Ancient Roman architecture in England and Wales |accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the Romans who founded the first cities and towns such as London, Bath, York, Chester and St Albans. Perhaps the best-known example is [[Hadrian's Wall]] stretching right across northern England.&lt;ref name="roman" /&gt; Another well-preserved example is the [[Roman Baths (Bath)|Roman Baths]] at [[Bath, Somerset]].&lt;ref name="roman" /&gt;

[[Anglo-Saxon architecture|Early Medieval architecture's]] secular buildings were simple constructions mainly using timber with [[thatch]] for roofing. Ecclesiastical architecture ranged from a synthesis of [[Early Christian Ireland|Hiberno]]–[[Germanic Christianity|Saxon]] [[monasticism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colgrave|1985|p=326}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pevsner|1942|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Early Christian art and architecture|Early Christian]] [[basilica]] and architecture characterised by pilaster-strips, blank arcading, baluster shafts and triangular headed openings. After the Norman conquest in 1066 various [[Castles in England]] were created so law lords could uphold their authority and in the north to protect from invasion. Some of the best-known medieval castles are the [[Tower of London]], [[Warwick Castle]], [[Durham Castle]] and [[Windsor Castle]].&lt;ref name="buildings" /&gt;

[[File:Bodiam-castle-10My8-1197.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A castle of square plan surrounded by a water-filled moat. It has round corner towers and a forbidding appearance.|[[Bodiam Castle]] is a 14th-century [[moat]]ed [[castle]] near [[Robertsbridge]] in East Sussex]]
Throughout the Plantagenet era, an [[English Gothic architecture]] flourished, with prime examples including the [[Architecture of the medieval cathedrals of England|medieval cathedrals]] such as [[Canterbury Cathedral]], [[Westminster Abbey]] and [[York Minster]].&lt;ref name="buildings"&gt;{{harvnb|Atkinson|2008|p=189}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding on the [[Norman architecture|Norman base]] there was also [[castle]]s, [[palace]]s, [[List of historic houses in England|great houses]], universities and [[parish church]]es. Medieval architecture was completed with the 16th-century [[Tudor architecture|Tudor style]]; the four-centred arch, now known as the [[Tudor arch]], was a defining feature as were [[wattle and daub]] houses domestically. In the aftermath of the [[Renaissance]] a form of architecture echoing classical antiquity synthesised with Christianity appeared, the [[English Baroque]] style of architect [[Christopher Wren]] being particularly championed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Downes|2007|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georgian architecture]] followed in a more refined style, evoking a simple Palladian form; the [[Royal Crescent]] at Bath is one of the best examples of this. With the emergence of [[romanticism]] during Victorian period, a [[Gothic Revival]] was launched. In addition to this, around the same time the Industrial Revolution paved the way for buildings such as [[The Crystal Palace]]. Since the 1930s various [[modernist architecture|modernist]] forms have appeared whose reception is often controversial, though traditionalist resistance movements continue with support in influential places.{{refn|While people such as [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] and [[Richard Rogers]] represent the modernist movement, [[Prince Charles]] since the 1980s has voiced strong views against it in favour of traditional architecture and put his ideas into practice at his [[Poundbury]] development in Dorset.&lt;ref name=ArchCon4&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8045027.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Architects to hear Prince appeal |date=12 May 2009 |accessdate=20 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architects like [[Raymond Erith]], [[Francis Johnson (architect)|Francis Johnson]] and [[Quinlan Terry]] continued to practise in the classical style.|group=nb}}

English folklore developed over many centuries. Some of the characters and stories are present across England, but most belong to specific regions. Common folkloric beings include [[pixie]]s, [[giant (mythology)|giants]], [[elf|elves]], [[bogeymen]], [[troll]]s, [[goblin]]s and [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]]. While many legends and folk-customs are thought to be ancient, for instance the tales featuring [[Offa of Angel]] and [[Wayland the Smith]],&lt;ref name="keary"&gt;{{harvnb|Keary|1882|p=50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; others date from after the Norman invasion; [[Robin Hood]] and his [[Merry Men]] of [[Sherwood Forest|Sherwood]] and their battles with the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]] being, perhaps, the best known.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pollard|2004|p=272}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[High Middle Ages]] tales originating from Brythonic traditions entered English folklore and developed into the [[Arthurian myth]].&lt;ref name="woodbbc"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wood |first=Michael |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/anglo_saxons/arthur_03.shtml |title=King Arthur, 'Once and Future King' |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="higham1"&gt;{{harvnb|Higham|2002|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Koch|2006|p=732}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These were derived from [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]], Welsh and French sources,&lt;ref name="higham1" /&gt; featuring [[King Arthur]], [[Camelot]], [[Excalibur]], [[Merlin]] and the [[Knights of the Round Table]] such as [[Lancelot]]. These stories are most centrally brought together within [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (''History of the Kings of Britain'').{{refn|These tales may have come to prominence, at least in part, as an attempt by the Norman ruling elite to legitimise their rule of the British Isles, finding [[Anglo-Saxon]] history ill-suited to the task during an era when members of the deposed [[House of Wessex]], especially [[Edgar the Ætheling]] and his nephews of the Scottish [[House of Dunkeld]], were still active in the isles.&lt;ref name=higham1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lacy|1986|p=649}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[Michael Wood (historian)|Michael Wood]] explains; "Over the centuries the figure of Arthur became a symbol of British history – a way of explaining the matter of Britain, the relationship between the Saxons and the Celts, and a way of exorcising ghosts and healing the wounds of the past."&lt;ref name=woodbbc /&gt;|group=nb}} Another early figure from [[Britons (historic)|British tradition]], [[King Cole]], may have been based on a real figure from Sub-Roman Britain. Many of the tales and [[pseudohistory|pseudo-histories]] make up part of the wider [[Matter of Britain]], a collection of shared British folklore.

Some folk figures are based on semi or actual historical people whose story has been passed down centuries; [[Lady Godiva]] for instance was said to have ridden naked on horseback through [[Coventry]], [[Hereward the Wake]] was a heroic English figure resisting the Norman invasion, [[Herne the Hunter]] is an [[equestrianism|equestrian]] ghost associated with [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] Forest and [[Windsor Great Park|Great Park]] and [[Mother Shipton]] is the archetypal witch.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Briggs|2004|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 November people make bonfires, set off [[fireworks]] and eat [[toffee apple]]s in [[Guy Fawkes Night|commemoration]] of the foiling of the [[Gunpowder Plot]] centred on [[Guy Fawkes]]. The chivalrous bandit, such as [[Dick Turpin]], is a recurring character, while [[Blackbeard]] is the archetypal pirate. There are various national and regional folk activities, participated in to this day, such as [[Morris dancing]], [[Maypole dance|Maypole dancing]], [[Rapper sword]] in the North East, [[Long Sword dance]] in Yorkshire, [[Mummers Play]]s, [[bottle-kicking]] in Leicestershire, and [[Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake|cheese-rolling]] at [[Brockworth, Gloucestershire|Cooper's Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Withington|2008|p=224}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no official national costume, but a few are well established such as the [[Pearly Kings and Queens]] associated with cockneys, the [[Queen's Guard|Royal Guard]], the [[Morris dance|Morris costume]] and [[Beefeater]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/questions/costume.html |publisher=Woodlands-Junior.kent.sch.uk |title=What is England's national costume? |accessdate=24 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505015321/http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/CUSTOMS/questions/costume.html |archivedate=5 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tudor rose was adopted as a national emblem of England around the time of the [[Wars of the Roses]] as a symbol of peace.&lt;ref name="Flowers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page828 |title=National flowers |date=13 January 2003 |publisher=Number10.gov.uk |accessdate=8 August 2009 |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080909053639/http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page828 |archivedate=9 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[syncreticism|syncretic]] symbol in that it merged the white rose of the [[House of York|Yorkists]] and the red rose of the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrians]]—cadet branches of the [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenets]] who went to war over control of the nation. It is also known as the ''Rose of England''.&lt;ref name="Rose"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rugbynetwork.net/main/s245/st74325.htm |title=England's Rose&amp;nbsp;– The Official History |last=Smith |first=Jed |date=3 June 2005 |website=Museum of Rugby, Twickenham |publisher=RugbyNetwork.net |accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[oak]] tree is a symbol of England, representing strength and endurance. The [[Royal Oak]] symbol and [[Oak Apple Day]] commemorate the escape of King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] from the grasp of the parliamentarians after his father's execution: he hid in an oak tree to avoid detection before safely reaching exile.

The Royal Arms of England, a national [[coat of arms]] featuring three lions, originated with its adoption by [[Richard the Lionheart]] in 1198. It is [[blazon]]ed as ''gules, three lions passant guardant or'' and it provides one of the most prominent symbols of England; it is similar to the traditional arms of [[Normandy]]. England does not have an official designated national anthem, as the United Kingdom as a whole has ''[[God Save the Queen]]''. However, the following are often considered unofficial English national anthems:
''[[Jerusalem (hymn)|Jerusalem]]'', ''[[Land of Hope and Glory]]'' (used for England during the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/node/143569 |title=Jason Cowley loves the Commonwealth Games |work=New Statesman |accessdate=5 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011102925/https://www.newstatesman.com/node/143569 |archivedate=11 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[I Vow to Thee, My Country]]''. England's [[National Day]] is 23 April which is [[St George's Day in England|St George's Day]]: St George is the patron saint of England.&lt;ref name="St. George"&gt;{{cite news |date=23 April 1998 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/82166.stm |title=The Great Saint George Revival |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''equestrian statue of Frederick VII''' in front of [[Christiansborg Palace|Christiansborg]] on [[Slotsholmen]] in [[Copenhagen, Denmark]], was modelled by [[Herman Wilhelm Bissen]] and completed posthumously by his son [[Vilhelm Bissen]] in 1873. It was created to commemorate [[Frederick VII of Denmark|King Frederick]]'s central role in Denmark's transition from [[absolute monarchy|absolute]] to [[Constitution of Denmark|constitutional monarchy]].

The statue shows [[Frederik VII of Denmark]] on [[equestrian statue|horseback]], wearing a long coat.

The granite plinth is decorated with bronze plaques on all sides. That on the front features a gilt oak wreath and the inscription "5/IUNI/1849" in gilt letters. The bronze plate on the left hand side features Frederik VII's motto: "FOLKETS KIÆRLIGHED/MIN STYRKE" (The people’s love, my strength). The inscription on the right hand side reads "FREDERIK D: SYVENDE/GRUNDLOVENS GIVER." (Frederik the Seventh, granter of the constitution). The inscription on the rear side reads "FØDT 1808./KONGE 1848./DØD 1863.” (Born 1808, King 1848, died 1863).

==History==
[[Image:Kong Frederik VIIs Rytterstøtte paa Slotspladsen.png|thumb|200px|The monument under construction in 1873, illustration from [[Illustreret Tidende]]  ]] 
When crown prince Frederick ascended to the Danish throne in 1848, following the death of his father, he became the ninth [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarch]] of Denmark since 1660.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statue af Frederik VII|url=http://www.kulturarv.dk/1001fortaellinger/da_DK/statue-af-frederik-vii|website=Kulturstyrelsen|accessdate=23 May 2015|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 March 1848, a demonstration with 10,000 people gathered on the plaza in front of Christiansborg Palace, demanding a new government and democratic reforms. The king immediately agreed and the [[Constitution of Denmark]] was signed on 5 June 1849.

[[Image:Rytterstatuen ved Christiansborg, 1873.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The statue in 1873 with the [[Christiansborg Palace (2nd)|second Christiansborg Palace]] as a backdrop ]] 
The statue was created on the initiative of a committee chaired by [[Carl Ploug]] to commemorate the monarch's role in ensuring Denmark's transition from absolute to constitutional monarchy. It was financed through contributions from the Danish state, the City of Copenhagen and private donations. [[Herman Wilhelm Bissen]] was charged with the design of the statue which was later completed by his son [[Vilhelm Bissen]]. It was cast by Parisian bronze casters at Vilhelm Bissen's workshop at [[Carlsberg (district)|Carlsberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=King Frederik VII (1808-63)|url=http://kk.sites.itera.dk/apps/kk_monumenter/index.asp?lang=uk&amp;mode=detalje&amp;id=115/da_DK/statue-af-frederik-vii|website=Copenhagen Municipality|accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monument was unveiled  on [[1873 in Denmark|6 October 1873]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1873|url=http://www.kobenhavnshistorie.dk/bog/khsd/1800/1873.html|website=Selskabet for Københavns Historie|accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It survived the fire of the [[Christiansborg Palace (2nd)|second Christiansborg Palace]] in 1894.

[[File:City of Cape Town CoA.png|thumb|right|200px|The logo used in the City of Cape Town flag since 2014]]
[[File:Table Mountain DanieVDM.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Table Mountain]] has been used as the basis of the City of Cape Town's various logos since 1996.]]
The '''flag of Cape Town''' is the flag used by the [[City of Cape Town]] municipality. It is not an officially registered flag, but consists of the city's logo used in flag form, and since 1996 it has changed each time the city's logo has changed.

The city's current logo was adopted in 2014 and is used on the city's flag. It consists of a rosette of four concentric rings, each made up of 6 silhouettes of Table Mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.behance.net/gallery/14928333/City-of-Cape-Town-Rebrand|title=City of Cape Town Rebrand |publisher=Behance|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From about 2005 until 2014, the logo consisted of a white outline of Table Mountain on a rainbow brush stroke background. 

From 1996 until around 2005, the flag featured a silhouette of [[Table Mountain]]. It was created by a [[graphic designer]] and was not registered with the [[South African Bureau of Heraldry]]. The design consisted of a stylised image of Table Mountain (and neighbouring peaks [[Devil's Peak (Cape Town)|Devil's Peak]] and [[Lion's Head (Cape Town)|Lion's Head]]) in white on a background of blue in the top left section and green in the top right section. Below the Table Mountain image is a yellow "paint brush" horizontal stripe under which is a red section at the bottom of the flag.

Before 1996, the flag consisted of the [[coat of arms of Cape Town]] on a blue field.

'''Galaxy 15''' is an [[United States|American]] [[telecommunications satellite]] which is owned by [[Intelsat]]. It was launched for and originally operated by [[PanAmSat]], and was subsequently transferred to Intelsat when the two companies merged in 2006. It was originally positioned in [[geostationary orbit]] at a [[longitude]] of 133° West, from where it was used to provide communication services to North America. In April 2010, Intelsat lost control of the satellite, and it began to drift away from its [[orbital slot]], with the potential to cause disruption to other satellites in its path.

On 27 December 2010, Intelsat reported that the satellite had rebooted as per design and the command unit was responding to commands again. In addition, the satellite had been secured in safe mode and the potential for interference issues from Galaxy 15 had ceased.&lt;ref name="intelsat.com"&gt;[http://www.intelsat.com/resources/galaxy-15/operational-status.asp Galaxy 15 | Intelsat&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.intelsat.com/resources/galaxy-15/FAQs.asp FAQs | Galaxy 15 | Intelsat&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Intelsat repositioned Galaxy 15 back to its original location on April 4, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpsworld.com/gnss-system/augmentation-assistance/news/waas-prn-135-resumes-normal-operation-11243 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727142321/http://www.gpsworld.com/gnss-system/augmentation-assistance/news/waas-prn-135-resumes-normal-operation-11243 |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2011|4|4}}

==Satellite==
GalaxyG 15 was constructed by [[Orbital Sciences Corporation]], and was based around the [[GEOStar-2]] [[satellite bus]]. The contract for its manufacture was signed in 2001, and at the time it was to have been identical to the [[Galaxy 12]] and [[Galaxy 14]] satellites which were also on order. In 2003, the contract was changed to allow the addition of more [[transponder]]s to support the US Government's Geostationary Communications and Control Segment (GCCS) [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS) a US [[Federal Aviation Administration]] navigation program.

The communications payload aboard Galaxy 15 consisted of 24 [[transponder]]s operating in the [[G band (NATO)|G]] and [[H band (NATO)|H bands]] of the [[NATO]] electromagnetic spectrum, or the [[C band (IEEE)|C band]] of the US [[IEEE]] spectrum. It also carried two [[C band (NATO)|C]]/[[D band (NATO)|D band]] (IEEE [[L band]]) transponders, which form part of the US Government's Geostationary Communications and Control Segment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?q=Geostationary+Communications+and+Control+Segment|title=Geostationary Communications and Control Segment - Google Search|author=|date=|website=www.google.com|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are used for [[aircraft]] navigation. At launch, the Galaxy 15 satellite had a mass of {{convert|2033|kg}}, and an expected operational lifespan of around 15 years.&lt;ref name="UCS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear_weapons_and_global_security/space_weapons/technical_issues/ucs-satellite-database.html|title=UCS Satellite Database|publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists|date=1 April 2010|accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/galaxy-15.htm|title=Galaxy 15|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|publisher=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launch==
The launch of Galaxy 15 was conducted by [[Arianespace]], using an [[Ariane 5|Ariane 5GS]] carrier rocket flying from [[ELA-3]] at the [[Guiana Space Centre]] in [[Kourou]], [[French Guiana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/media-telecommunications/5096098-1.html|title=Orbital-Built Galaxy 15 Satellite Successfully Launched For PanAmSat; Company Launches Second Galaxy Satellite for PanAmSat in Past Two Months.|date=14 October 2005|publisher=AllBusiness|accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch occurred at 22:32 GMT on October 13, 2005,&lt;ref name="JSR-LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|last=McDowell|first=Jonathan|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the opening of an 84-minute launch window,&lt;ref name="LaunchKit"/&gt; and successfully placed Galaxy 15 into a [[geosynchronous transfer orbit]]. The [[France|French]] [[Syracuse 3A]] military communications satellite was launched on the same rocket. During launch, Galaxy 15 was located beneath the Syracuse spacecraft, which was mounted atop a [[SYLDA]] adaptor.&lt;ref name="LaunchKit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arianespace.com/images/launch-kits/launch-kit-pdf-eng/05_oct_13.pdf |title=A boost for civil and military communications |date=13 October 2005 |work=Syracuse 3A &amp; Galaxy 15 Launch Kit |publisher=Arianespace |accessdate=4 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917231459/http://arianespace.com/images/launch-kits/launch-kit-pdf-eng/05_oct_13.pdf |archivedate=17 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following separation from the carrier rocket, Galaxy 15 raised itself to geostationary orbit by means of an [[IHI Corporation|IHI]]-[[Newton (unit)|500N]] [[Apogee kick motor|apogee motor]].&lt;ref name="GSOHist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/geo.date|title=Index|work=Geostationary Orbit Catalog|last=McDowell|first=Jonathan|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its insertion into geosynchronous orbit occurred at around 19:00 on October 19, 2005.&lt;ref name="GSOHist"/&gt;

==Failure and recovery==

===Failure===
On April 5, 2010, Galaxy 15 ceased responding to commands sent to it by controllers on the ground.&lt;ref name="SN-failure"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacenews.com/satellite_telecom/100408-intelsat-loses-contact-galaxy-satellite.html |title=Intelsat Loses Contact with Galaxy 15 Satellite |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qJfqPPWW?url=http://www.spacenews.com/satellite_telecom/100408-intelsat-loses-contact-galaxy-satellite.html |archivedate=7 June 2010 |last=Ferster |first=Warren |date=8 April 2010 |publisher=Space News |accessdate=4 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is unclear when the actual initial failure date was because commands are often sent by satellite operators days or even weeks apart. Without commands necessary for [[stationkeeping]] it began to drift east away from its allotted orbital slot. All television signals were transferred to other satellites and all intentional transmissions were ceased. The Galaxy 12 satellite was removed from on-orbit storage at 123° West&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weebau.com/satellite/G/galaxy%2012.htm|title=Galaxy 12&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=weebau.com|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to replace Galaxy 15 at the 133° West orbital slot. Galaxy 12 was originally slated to replace another satellite [[Galaxy 27]] which had to be relocated to 45.1° East for the start of a mission critical service for the United States government. Due to the necessity of relocating Galaxy 12 to 133° West, Intelsat was forced to leave 129° West vacant.&lt;ref name="tvtechnology.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/105946|title=The Galaxy 15 Saga Continues, by Doug Lung&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=tvtechnology.com|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 April, Orbital Sciences theorized that they believed [[solar variation|solar activity]] was responsible for the satellite malfunctioning,&lt;ref name="Solar"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; although a later statement by the company said that the company had been unable to actually settle on "a single root cause."&lt;ref&gt;de Selding, Peter B., ''Space News'', July 26, 2010, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; On  May 3, an attempt at a very momentary series of strong pulses intended to cause a power system malfunction were sent to Galaxy 15. Unfortunately, this did not have the desired effect of causing a power system overload and subsequent shut down of the active transponders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/news/zombiesat-galaxy-15-shutdown-fails-sn-100505.html|title=Attempt to Shut Down Zombie Satellite Galaxy 15 Fails |last=de Selding|first=Peter B.|date=5 May 2010|publisher=Space.com|accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the concern of neighboring satellite operators that this type of recovery attempt would have had the potential to permanently damage sensitive hardware on board a satellite and could have contributed to placing a satellite into a permanent unrecoverable control state.

===Reported passes and interference===
On May 12, 2010, Intelsat and [[SES World Skies]] confirmed that Galaxy 15 would pass close to the latter's [[AMC-11]] satellite, potentially causing interference with cable programming over the United States because the two satellites broadcast on similar frequencies.&lt;ref name="Intelsat-Warns"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satellitetoday.com/st/topnews/34137.html|title=Intelsat Warns Galaxy 15 May Drift into AMC 11 Orbit|last=Hill|first=Jeff|date=13 May 2010|publisher=SatelliteTODAY.com|accessdate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between May 23 and June 7, 2010, Galaxy 15 passed within half a degree of AMC-11.&lt;ref name="AMC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacenews.com/satellite_telecom/100430-galaxy15-still-adrift-poses-threat.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qJfyRwBW?url=http://www.spacenews.com/satellite_telecom/100430-galaxy15-still-adrift-poses-threat.html |archivedate=7 June 2010 |title=Galaxy 15, Still Adrift, Poses Threat to Its Orbital Neighbors |last=de Selding |first=Peter B |date=30 April 2010 |publisher=Space News |accessdate=4 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the two satellites passed close to each other, particularly during closest approach on May 31 and June 1, signals from Galaxy 15's still-active transponders could have interfered with signals being broadcast by AMC-11.&lt;ref name="AMC"/&gt; SES maneuvered&lt;!--check spelling--&gt; the AMC-11 satellite to reduce the possibility of interference. The [[SES-1]] satellite followed behind Galaxy 15 during the pass to provide a backup to AMC-11 should it be needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Amos|first=Jonathan|title='Zombie' satellite prompts orbital waltz|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/science_and_environment/10150614.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=26 May 2010|date=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2, Intelsat and SES reported that no interference had occurred during closest approach, with the satellites passing within 0.2 degrees of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=de Selding |first=Peter B |title=Intelsat, SES Safely Negotiate Passage of Wayward Craft |url=http://www.spacenews.com/satellite_telecom/100603-intelsat-ses-negotiate-wayward-craft.html |publisher=Space News |accessdate=7 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qJf7OE77?url=http://www.spacenews.com/satellite_telecom/100603-intelsat-ses-negotiate-wayward-craft.html |archivedate=7 June 2010 |date=3 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After it had passed AMC-11, Galaxy 15 continued to drift Eastwards. Between 12 and 13 July 2010, it passed [[Galaxy 13/Horizons-1]], a satellite located at 127.0° West which is owned jointly by Intelsat and [[SKY Perfect JSAT Group]]. The pass was not reported to have caused any disruption to broadcasts being made by Galaxy 13/Horizons-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacenews.com/satellite_telecom/100716-intelsat-again-averts-interference.html|title=Intelsat Again Averts Galaxy 15 Interference|last=de Selding|first=Peter B.|date=16 July 2010|publisher=SpaceNews.com|accessdate=25 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 July 2010, Galaxy 15 passed another Intelsat spacecraft; [[Galaxy 14]], which is located at 125.0° West. Closest approach occurred on 30 July.  On August 8, 2010, the satellite drifted toward a satellite owned by [[General Communications, Inc.|GCI]], a communications company broadcasting to rural [[Alaska]].&lt;ref name="OrbitalFAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intelsat.com/resources/galaxy-15/FAQs.asp |title=FAQs |work=Galaxy 15 |publisher=Intelsat |accessdate=25 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rUQBgZ1e?url=http://www.intelsat.com/resources/galaxy-15/FAQs.asp |archivedate=25 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Galaxy 15 passed [[Anik F2]] at orbital slot 111.1° West at or near October 20 through 25, 2010. Further, the satellite continued to be watched by telecommunications companies due to the potential for interfering with C-band frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/stories/article/98789_zombiesat_threatens_arctic_telecommunications/|title="Zombiesat" threatens Arctic telecommunications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 December 2010, it was reported that Galaxy 15 had potentially caused an outage to a [[National Weather Service]] NOAAPORT feed via SES-1 located at 101 west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/110536|title=More Fallout From Galaxy 15, by Doug Lung&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=tvtechnology.com|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then on 12 December 2010, the following advisory was issued, ''A RISK HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED WHEN THE GALAXY 15 ROGUE SATELLITE TRAVERSES THE SES-1 ORBITAL POSITION WHICH MAY RESULT IN A POSSIBLE LOSS OF DATA VIA THE NWS AWIPS SBN/NOAAPORT FEED. THIS POTENTIAL INTERFERENCE MAY TAKE PLACE BETWEEN 12/12/10 AND 12/18/10 INCLUSIVE.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nws.noaa.gov/dm-cgi-bin/chgshow.pl?fn=DMPD111005.txt National Weather Service TOC/Data Management Change Notices] nws.noaa.gov&lt;/ref&gt; To minimize interference, signals intended for SES-1 at 101 West were routed and uplinked via an 11-meter dish from the SES Americom Master Ground Station in Hawaii, which is outside the Galaxy 15 uplink footprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/dm-cgi-bin/chgshow.pl?fn=DMPD111005.txt|title=National Weather Service TOC/Data Management Change Notices|first=NWS/Office of Chief Information Officer, Telecommunications Operations Center,  Silver Spring, MD; Jan 04, 2010, by Richard A. Robinson|last=III|date=|website=www.nws.noaa.gov|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the failure and drift period of Galaxy 15 status information regarding the continued operation of the two L-Band [[Wide Area Augmentation System#Space segment|Wide Area Augmentation System Space Segment]] transponders once utilized by the [[FAA]] for aircraft precision location remained unknown. Prior to recovery, Galaxy 15 had been expected to pass by Inmarsat 4F3 at 98 degrees west in late December 2010. Inmarsat 4F3 has since performed some of the same [[WAAS]] mission for the FAA from 98 degrees west, that Galaxy 15 once performed at 133 west.

===Uplink signal avoidance and mitigation===
Galaxy 15, like many communications satellites rebroadcasts the signals it receives on its uplink frequencies to the corresponding C-Band downlink frequencies. Therefore, the potential for interference only existed when Galaxy 15 drifted into the line of sight of a ground uplink segment intended for another communications satellite operating on the same uplink frequency range in the path of Galaxy 15. The magnitude of the interference risk depended on a large number of variables, including the size of the uplink antenna used (the larger the antenna, the lower the risk to hit Galaxy 15), the location of the uplink and whether inside the Galaxy 15 footprint, and the onboard gain capabilities of the satellite proximate to Galaxy 15. Satellite operators devised a variety of strategies to mitigate the potential interference to their birds' downlink transmissions including, temporarily transferring uplinks to larger uplink antenna, deliberately off-pointing uplink antennas to put Galaxy 15 into the null, maneuvering the satellite being passed to maintain a minimum angular separation, increasing the satellite's gain sensitivity settings allowing a lowering of the uplink power needed and latterly moving the uplink to a location where Galaxy 15 had no uplink coverage (i.e. Hawaii). These techniques were successfully able to reduce, mitigate and minimize for commercial satellite operations most interference potential during a Galaxy 15 fly by.  Smaller sized stationary receive only sites, like those used by amateurs or [[SMATV]] which have a wider beam width reception potential, may have experienced interference, while for the most part commercial operators experienced no adverse effects from Galaxy 15 during its failure period thanks to the execution of the mitigation practices devised in the wake of the crisis.

===Power loss predictions and criticism===
The satellite was theorized to lose [[attitude control]] when its [[reaction wheel]]s became saturated. When this event occurred, it would prevent the spacecraft's [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar panels]] from tracking the sun, and it would shut down.  After the power reset event, further attempts would be made to recover control of the satellite.&lt;ref name="OrbitalFAQ" /&gt;
This event was originally predicted for late August or early September 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1007/25galaxy15/|title=Zombiesat has three more satellites in its crosshairs|publisher=Spaceflightnow.com|accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; then Intelsat revised its estimate to sometime between 28 November and 29 December 2010. After subsequent criticism of the actual science behind Orbital Sciences' predictions Intelsat completely abandoned the published timeline method. Instead for a period Intelsat stated ''Based on the revised analysis, the estimated window for a Galaxy 15 off-point and loss of power could occur as early as this month'' without clarifying the month indicated.&lt;ref name="intelsat.com"/&gt; The hypothesis used to calculate the timeline of any potential occurrence of loss of power was imprecise, due to the fact the satellite has experienced
erratic loading conditions of radio frequency signals since it began to drift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2010/11/04/zombie-satellite-flyby.html | work=CBC News | title=Zombie satellite to do another flyby | date=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Six months after the initial failure date published timelines for shut down proved to be more hopes of a public relations campaign based in theory, and in an interview conducted in October 2010 during the Satcon Conference, both Intelsat &amp; Orbital admitted that the ''hoped'' timeline scenario was, ''in theory'' and ''this has been an unprecedented situation, and we are learning as we go.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/news/zombie-satellite-interference-threat-101015.html|title=Runaway Zombie Satellite Galaxy 15 Continues to Pose Interference Threat|author=|date=|website=space.com|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recovery===
On 23 December 2010, Intelsat successfully regained control over the satellite after the Baseband Equipment Command Unit reset following a loss of lock and full discharge of the batteries, reportedly the most critical phases of the recovery of Galaxy 15 have been completed. The emergency command patch which would allow ground controllers to gain access to redundant BBEs in the event of a similar failure in the future had also successfully been applied to Galaxy 15 according to Intelsat.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Galaxy 15 was relocated at 93° West&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41065830/ns/technology_and_science-space/|title=What turned satellite into zombie?

Once Galaxy 15 was fully recovered it was moved back to 133° West and then the Galaxy 12 spacecraft was relocated for its intended mission at the 129° West slot.&lt;ref name="tvtechnology.com"/&gt;

On 18 October 2011, Intelsat transitioned all of its 133° West customers back from Galaxy 12 to Galaxy 15.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

'''Gambling for resurrection''' is a situation in [[international relations]] when a leader weakened domestically is willing to risk war or prolong war to maintain office.

== Theory ==
Leaders who are weakened domestically often undertake risky policies to avoid undesirable developments for them personally. The fear of removal from office due to poor performance or bad luck may prompt a leader to instigate a diversionary war he or she might not rationally have started, in the hope that should it go well he or she would stay in power, or at least receiving a surge in personal popularity and patriotism to sustain them in power.  Gambling for resurrection can also consist of a leader prolonging an existing war that should rationally be ended, fearing removal from office or punishment (imprisonment, exile, or death)&lt;ref name=goemans&gt;{{cite book

. The leader thus continues the war against the country's interest, adopting risky military strategies in the hope of a dramatic reversal of fortune in the war's outcome.&lt;ref name=downs&gt;{{cite book

Once the constituency seem determined to remove the leader from office, it has no other sanction to apply to the leader. The executive, then, has nothing to risk in further escalation, but may win his right to stay in office should the gamble be successful.&lt;ref name=downs2&gt;{{cite journal

==Examples==
It is seldom possible to provide conclusive proof that a leader's decision to go to war or prolong war is motivated by personal or domestic political issues.  However, some conflicts may be seen as Gambles for Resurrection, including:

* The Argentinian [[Falklands War|invasion of the Falkland/Malvinas Islands]], which was seen as a distraction from President [[Leopoldo Galtieri]]'s domestic problems, and an attempt to unify the country in its territorial claim over the islands.  After her victory in the conflict [[Margaret Thatcher]] called a [[Khaki election]] in the UK, [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|winning decisively]], and Galtieri was ousted the same year.
*President [[Bill Clinton]] was involved in a [[Lewinsky scandal|sex scandal]] and started three military strikes in 1998 against [[Iraq]], targets in the [[Sudan]] and [[Afghanistan]], and [[Serbia]] in the heat of the scandal.  This followed just three months after the release of the film "[[Wag the dog]]" (see below), and apparently mirrored the film's theme.&lt;ref name=wag&gt;{{cite web |last=Bruni|first= Frank| title=Is Life Imitating Art? 'Wag the Dog' Springs to Many Minds |publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=1998-08-21|url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/world/africa/082198attack-wag.html|format= text|accessdate=2007-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Adolf Hitler]] refused to surrender at the end of the [[Second World War]], when defeat was inevitable and surrender was in the best interests of [[Germany]].  [[Death of Adolf Hitler|His suicide]] may be seen as an attempt to preserve his historical reputation, though his mental state is uncertain.

==Pop culture influence==
Gambling for resurrection is often referred to in the mainstream media as "[[Wag the dog]]," a reference to a 1997 film by the same name in which a fictional [[President of the United States]] starts a fake diversionary war to distract the American public from a sex scandal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3804">The '''Joint FAO-WHO Expert Committee Report on Food Additives''' was an international report of the [[World Health Organization]]. The Expert Committee commissioned to evaluate the safety for human consumption of selected [[food additives]] and [[Food contaminants|contaminants]] and to establish acceptable daily intakes for these substances.

==The report==
The report has two parts. The first part provides a general discussion of principles governing the toxicological evaluation of food additives and contaminants, the establishments and revision of specifications, and intake assessments of food additives. The second part provides succinct summaries of the toxicological data examined and factors considered when evaluating selected substances and allocating an [[acceptable daily intake]].

===Eighteenth report===
The eighteenth report was released as World Health Organization Technical Report Series No. 557 in 1974.

===Twenty-fifth report===
The twenty-fifth report was released as World Health Organization Technical Report Series No. 669 in 1981.

===Forty-ninth report===
The forty-ninth report was released as World Health Organization Technical Report Series No. 884 in 1999. Evaluations are presented in this report for one [[antioxidant]] (tert-butylhydroquinone), two [[emulsifier]]s (microcrystalline cellulose and sucrose esters of fatty acids and sucroglycerides), two [[enzyme]] preparations (alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase and maltogenic amylase), one [[flavoring agent]] (trans-anethole), one [[glazing agent]] (hydrogenated poly-1-decene), one [[sweetening agent]] (maltitol syrup), and the reduced calorie replacement for conventional fats and oils, salatrim.

===Fifty-third report===
The fifty third report was released as World Health Organization Technical Report Series No. 896 in 2000.

'''La Colle''' is a north western residential area; part of the traditional ''Quartier'' of [[Moneghetti]] in the [[Principality of Monaco]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.gouv.mc/Action-Gouvernementale/L-Economie/Analyses-et-Statistiques/Publications/Monaco-Statistiques-Pocket 2012 Statistics]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also one of the ten modern administrative ''Wards'' of Monaco.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

==Geography==
La Colle lies on the north western side of the country, just north of [[Fontvieille, Monaco|Fontvieille]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.visitmonaco.com/us/About-Monaco/Geography Monaco - Geography / About Monaco / Monaco Official Site&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; La Colle is generally considered part of Moneghetti, even though it is its own administrative ''Ward''. It runs directly along the neighboring French towns of [[Beausoleil, Alpes-Maritimes|Beausoleil]], and [[Cap-d'Ail]], as well as the Monégasque ''Wards'' of [[Les Révoires]], [[Fontvieille, Monaco|Fontvieille]], and [[Moneghetti]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==Demographics==
La Colle is the second smallest ''Ward'' in Monaco in terms of population ([[Monaco-Ville]] is the smallest), and the third smallest in terms of land size. La Colle has a population of 2,829 and an area of {{convert|0.11|km2}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gouv.mc/Action-Gouvernementale/L-Economie/Analyses-et-Statistiques/Publications/Recensement-de-la-population Census 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Monaco has ten [[Monaco#Education|state-operated schools]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spainexchange.com/guide/MC-education.htm The Education System in Monaco] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103144557/http://www.spainexchange.com/guide/MC-education.htm |date=2012-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; four private schools, and one [[International University of Monaco|university]]. One state school and one private school are located in La Colle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.angloinfo.com/monaco/how-to/monaco-family-schooling-education|title=Schooling and Education in Monaco|website=Angloinfo Monaco|publisher=[[Angloinfo]]|access-date=2016-06-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807222146/https://www.angloinfo.com/monaco/how-to/monaco-family-schooling-education|archivedate=2016-08-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism==
La Colle is more of an industrial area, but some small hotels can be found here, helping Monaco's high end tourist industry.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==Features==
La Colle takes after [[Fontvieille, Monaco|Fontvieille]] in being one of the more industrial areas in Monaco.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.visitmonaco.com/us/Places-to-visit/Walks Monaco - Walks / Places to visit / Monaco Official Site&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; For instance [[Venturi Automobiles|Venturi]] and its subsidiary [[Voxan]] have an eco-friendly factory located here.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.venturi.fr/Entreprise/Venturi-aujourd-hui Venturi aujourd'hui / Entreprise / Accueil - Venturi&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20101003103932/http://www.venturi.fr/Entreprise/Venturi-aujourd-hui |date=2010-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its location within Monaco helps to expedite shipping; located more on the outside of the city, manufacturing causes little problem to Monaco's high end tourist industry.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Even though La Colle is more industrialized, there is real estate along the [[Les Révoires]]-La Colle border.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.montecarlo-realestate.com/en/maps/?type_transaction=locations&amp;idQuartier=7 Real Estate Monaco La Colle&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Because La Colle's location more outside the city center, its real estate sales are generally less.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Averaging 13% to 18% less than neighboring [[Fontvieille, Monaco|Fontvieille]] or [[La Condamine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montecarlo-realestate.com/en/quartiers/ Real Estate Monaco&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Princess Grace Hospital Centre|Princess Grace Hospital]], Monaco's only hospital is located in the westernmost portion of La Colle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chpg.mc/fr/institut-de-formation-en-soins-infirmiers/contact-et-acces Centre Hospitalier Princesse Grace - Monaco&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121118072033/http://www.chpg.mc/fr/institut-de-formation-en-soins-infirmiers/contact-et-acces |date=2012-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lepo je biti sosed'''  ''(It's nice to be neighbours)'' is a [[Slovenia]]n [[television series]], which started filming in 2008 and after six seasons, ended May 2011. The broadcast television series called [[POP TV]] in the Monday evening slot (20.00), its director was Jemeršič Ven. The first three seasons are copied from the original Slovak. The plot tells about two neighbouring families with good relationships.

The storyline is about two couples, who live across the hallway to each other. The first couple are Žuža (formally Branka), the seller of high-quality products and Beno, the hunter. They have a daughter; Lidija, but she doesn't appear during season 1 nor is she mentioned.  The second couple are Silvika, immigrant from Hungary and Ivo, who is a handyman. They moved into their apartment during the pilot episode, however they knew Beno and Žuža prior to moving in.

During series many recurring characters appeared. The first season recurring characters Vanessa Z and mailman were portrayed by popular singers Anika Horvat and Fredi Miler.

The first-season episodes are 40 minutes long (30 minutes without commercials), however episodes in the following season were 60 minutes long (45 minutes without commercials).  Episodes were shown on a Monday at 20:00 [[Central European Time|CET]].

'''"Lusitana paixão"''' ("[[Lusitania]]n passion") was the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991]], performed in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] by [[Dulce Pontes|Dulce]].

The song is a ballad, with Dulce singing about the [[fado]] music of her native country. She sings that on the surface, this is a style of very sad music, with a focus on "longing" and "love from the past". As the song develops, though, she explains that this is a style of song which is perfect for her feelings, in that it "doesn't make me regret".

The song was performed twelfth on the night, following [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]'s [[Kim Jackson]] with "[[Could It Be That I'm In Love]]" and preceding [[Denmark]]'s [[Anders Frandsen]] with "[[Lige der hvor hjertet slår]]". At the close of voting, it had received 62 points, placing 8th in a field of 22.

It was succeeded as [[Portugal in the Eurovision Song Contest|Portuguese representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1992|1992 contest]] by [[Dina (singer)|Dina]] with "[[Amor d'água fresca]]".

Since judges and magistrates in Spain are barred from joining trade unions, professional associations such as APM have adopted the traditional union role of protecting their employment rights and conditions. APM is the biggest professional association of judges and magistrates in Spain and is considered to be ideologically conservative.

The '''Roman Catholic Metropolitan Archdiocese of Tokyo''' ({{lang-la|Archidioecesis Tokiensis}}, {{lang-ja|カトリック東京大司教区}}) is an ecclesiastical territory or [[diocese]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Japan]]. It was erected as the '''Apostolic Vicariate of Japan''' on May 1, 1846, by [[Pope Gregory XVI]], and its name was later changed by [[Pope Pius IX]] to the '''Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Japan''' on May 22, 1876.

It was elevated to the [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan Archdiocese]] of [[Tokyo]] by [[Pope Leo XIII]] on June 15, 1891, with the [[Suffragan bishop|suffragan sees]] of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Niigata|Niigata]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Saitama|Saitama]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sapporo|Sapporo]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sendai|Sendai]], and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Yokohama|Yokohama]].

==History==
The Evangelization of Japan starts in 1549 with the arrival of [[Saint Francis Xavier]] and goes on until 1587 when [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] issued the edict forbidding Christianity and ordering all missionaries to leave Japan.  In the following years of persecution, also in [[Edo]] (now Tokyo), there were cases of martyrdom in 1612 and 1623.

After the “seclusion period”, the first missionaries of the [[Paris Mission Society]] arrived in Japan in 1858 and were stationed in the three ports of [[Nagasaki]], [[Yokohama]] and [[Hakodate]].

On 1 May 1846, '''Vicariate Apostolic of Japan''' was erected.&lt;ref name="catholic-hierarchy"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cheney |first1=David M. |title=Tōkyō (Archdiocese) [Catholic-Hierarchy] |url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dtoky.html |website=www.catholic-hierarchy.org |accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 May 1876, the [[vicariate apostolic]] was divided in two: the [[Apostolic Vicariate of Southern Japan]] with its center in Nagasaki and '''Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Japan''' with its center in Tokyo.&lt;ref name="catholic-hierarchy" /&gt;  [[Pierre Marie Osouf]] was the first [[Ordinary (Catholic Church)]] of the Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Japan.&lt;ref name="catholic-hierarchy" /&gt;

On April 17, 1891. the Vicariate Apostolic of Northern Japan was divided into the Archdiocese of Tokyo and the [[Diocese of Hakodate]]. Pierre Marie Osouf became the first '''Archbishop of Tokyo'''.&lt;ref name="catholic-hierarchy" /&gt;

On August 13, 1912, the Archdiocese of Tokyo ceded the prefectures of [[Toyama Prefecture|Toyama]], [[Fukui Prefecture|Fukui]] and [[Ishikawa Prefecture|Ishikawa]] to the newly established [[Prefecture Apostolic of Niigata]], and on February 18, 1922, the prefectures of [[Aichi]] and [[Gifu Prefecture|Gifu]] were ceded to the newly established [[Prefecture Apostolic of Nagoya]].

In November 1937, Tokyo was entrusted to the Japanese clergy and confined to [[Tokyo-to]] and the [[Chiba Prefecture]]. The remaining territory was detached to form the [[Diocese of Yokohama]].  The first Archbishop selected from among the Japanese clergy was Archbishop Peter Tatsu Doi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tokyo.catholic.jp/english/archdiocese_en/|title=Tokyo Archdiocese - カトリック東京大司教区　ウェブサイト|website=tokyo.catholic.jp|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"The War Is Not Over"''' was [[Latvia]]'s entry in the 2005 [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005|Eurovision Song Contest]], performed in [[English language|English]] by [[Valters &amp; Kaža]].

The song is a gentle ballad with somewhat elliptical lyrics. The duo sings, "The war is not over, everyone knows it/It's just a reason to make us believe/That someone's the loser, someone's the winner", which can be interpreted as a call to their listeners not to believe what official sources say.

Early recordings featured the lyrics "That someone is loser, that someone is winner". These were replaced by the above line in deference to English grammar.

The duo performed the song seated on stools with acoustic guitars. The final chorus, however, was performed standing up and using [[sign language]] to accompany the lyrics.

As Latvia had not qualified for the finals at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004 Contest]], the song was performed in the semi-finals. It was performed fifth, following [[Moldova]]'s [[Zdob şi Zdub]] with "[[Boonika bate doba]]" and preceding [[Monaco]]'s [[Lise Darly]] with "[[Tout de moi]]". At the close of voting, it had received 85 points, placing 10th in a field of 25 and thus qualifying for the finals (the top ten did so).

In the finals, the song was performed twenty-third, following [[Estonia]]'s [[Vanilla Ninja]] representing [[Switzerland]] with "[[Cool Vibes]]" and preceding [[France]]'s [[Marie Ortal Malka|Ortal]] with "[[Chacun pense à soi]]". At the close of voting, it had received 153 points, placing 5th in a field of 24, thus qualifying Latvia for the finals at their next Contest appearance.

The song had received 12 points from [[Ireland]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Moldova]].

It was succeeded as [[Latvia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Latvian representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006 Contest]] by [[Vocal Group Cosmos|Cosmos]] with "[[I Hear Your Heart]]".

This song was later recorded by the [[Denmark|Danish]] pop-group [[Michael Learns to Rock]] on their ''[[Eternity (Michael Learns to Rock album)|Eternity]]''-album released in 2008.

"The War Is Not Over" song composer [[Mārtiņš Freimanis]] died on 27 January 2011, aged 32.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://diena.lv/lat/izklaide/muzika/muziba-aizgajis-martins-freimanis |title=Mūžībā aizgājis Mārtiņš Freimanis |publisher=[[Diena]] |author= |language=Latvian |date=27 January 2011 |accessdate=27 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
