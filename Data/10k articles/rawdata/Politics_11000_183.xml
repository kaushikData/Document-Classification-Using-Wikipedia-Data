The '''Al-Gaddafi International Prize for Human Rights''' was an annual [[human rights]] prize founded by the [[Libya]]n [[General People's Congress (Libya)|People's Congress]] in late 1988, in "indebtedness and gratitude for [[Muammar Gaddafi]] and in appreciation for his role in firmly establishing the principle of [[direct democracy]], his persistent struggle, his distinctive inspiration and continuous instigation for the consolidation of human liberty and for issuing the Great Green Document in the era of the masses, for the purpose of bestowing tribute upon symbolic figures of struggle and faith in the values of freedom to all humans, nations, groups and individuals".&lt;ref name="AGIPHRarchive"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110220071542/http://www.gaddafiprize.org/WhoEn.htm About us] Web.archive.org. Archived from the original on 20 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaddafi made an initial grant of ten million [[United States dollar|US$]]&lt;ref name="TimeGadafiPrize"&gt;{{cite news|title=Prizes: And the Winner Is...|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,957634,00.html|publisher= [[Time Inc.|Time]]|date=1989-05-08|accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Switzerland|Swiss]]-based foundation [[North-South XXI]] which later administered the prize donation. The sum of the prize money was US $250,000 (in case of several recipients the prize money was shared). The prize was given by an international committee, chaired by former [[President of Algeria]] [[Ahmed Ben Bella]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tributes.com/obituary/photos/Ahmed-Ben-Bella-93621519 Chairman of the International Committee for the Gadhafi International Human Rights Prize 2004, former Algerian President Ahmed Ben Bella, left, shakes hands with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez during his awarding ceremony of the 'Gadhafi International Human Rights Prize 2004' in Tripoli, Libya.] Tributes.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KMBGaddafiMintoff" /&gt; Gaddafi himself had no say in choosing the winner.&lt;ref name="TimeGadafiPrize" /&gt;

The prize was discontinued in 2011, after Gaddafi's overthrow and [[Death of Muammar Gaddafi|murder]] during the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]].

[[Image:WHProtest1941.jpg|thumbnail|right|400px|A protest of the American Peace Mobilization held at the White House in 1941.]]
The '''American Peace Mobilization''' (APM) was a peace group, officially cited in 1947 by [[United States Attorney General]] [[Tom C. Clark]] on the [[Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations]] for 1948, as directed by President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s [[Executive Order 9835]].

==Organizational history==
===Establishment===
The American Peace Movement (APM) was launched as the "Emergency Peace Mobilization" at a Chicago convention during [[Labor Day]] weekend during September 1940, a gathering attended by about 6,000 delegates.&lt;ref name=Story&gt;"The Story of APM," in Committee on Un-American Activities, House of Representatives, ''Investigation of Un-America Propaganda Activities in the United States: Appendix ‚Äî Part IX.'' Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office, 1944; pg. 434.&lt;/ref&gt; The group was formed from remnants of the [[American League for Peace and Democracy]], an anti-war organization funded by the [[Communist International]] and controlled by the [[Communist Party, USA]] which attempted to build an American‚ÄìSoviet defense alliance against potential aggression in Europe on the part of [[Nazi Germany]]‚Äîan organization terminated with the signing of the [[Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact]] of August 1939.

With the Soviets seemingly protected by what was viewed as a stable treaty of non-aggression with [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Soviet Union]]'s focus turned from overt anti-[[Fascist]] militancy to "peace," and the members of the various national groups affiliated with the Comintern followed this change in lockstep.

The Chicago convention adopted a platform called "Five Planks to Defend America,"&lt;ref name=Story /&gt; which instead of organizing to stop the spread of fascism included demands to:
# Keep Out of War
# Defeat Militarism and Regimentation
# Restore the Bill of Rights
# Stop War Profiteering; and
# Guaranteed a Decent Living Standard for All

In conjunction with these goals, the APM was particularly active in attempting to halt [[conscription|military conscription]], and sought to serve as a Communist-led "[[mass organization]]" that sought to bring together [[trade unions]], student groups, women's organizations, and anti-war church organizations under a single organization.&lt;ref name=Story /&gt;

In the midst of the [[London Blitz]] and the [[Battle of Britain]], APM also agitated for a cut-off of "warmonger" President [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s [[Lend-Lease]] program, and any other U.S. aid to the U.K.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,790078,00.html "Picketers Picketed,"] ''Time'', June 2, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; The group conducted a 1,029-hour non-stop peace demonstration in front of the [[White House]], a protest which ironically ended on June 21, 1941‚Äîone day before the [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazis invaded]] the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;"White House Pickets Stop At 1,029 Hours," ''Washington Post'', June 22, 1941&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policy reversal===

With the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, the pro-Soviet activists within the APM again reversed their previous agenda almost overnight, now demanding immediate U.S. entry into the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,849366,00.html Purely for Peace], ''Time'', July 14, 1941&lt;/ref&gt; APM changed its name yet again, to the American Peoples' Mobilization.&lt;ref name="ampeoplesmob"&gt;[http://www.swarthmore.edu/library/peace/CDGA.A-L/ampeoplesmob.htm American Peoples Mobilization Collected Records, 1940-1941], ''Peace Collection, [[Swarthmore College]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
While the Communist Party and its various "pro-peace" [[front organizations]] completely reversed their position on the war the moment the pact was violated, the non-interventionists of [[America First Committee|America First]] continued their opposition until the U.S. was [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked]] on December 7.

===National Committee to Win the Peace===

During the Cold War, the group rediscovered pacifism as the National Committee to Win the Peace in demanding [[nuclear disarmament]], and U.S. and British withdrawal from [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], [[China]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Greek Civil War|Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,793465,00.html The First Loyalty], ''Time,'' March 31, 1947&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,888295,00.html Win the Peace for Whom?] ''Time,'' September 16, 1946, (''[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,778777-3,00.html What is a Front?], response from [[Evans Carlson|BGen. Evans F. Carlson]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personnel==

The Executive Secretary of the APM was [[Frederick V. Field]], formerly the head of the Communist-sponsored [[American Council of the Institute of Pacific Relations.]] Field was the author of two book-length treatments of American investment and financial exploitation in the Far East and was editor of the monthly magazine ''[[Amerasia]].''&lt;ref&gt;"APM National Officers," in ''Investigation of Un-America Propaganda Activities in the United States: Appendix ‚Äî Part IX,'' pp. 434-435.&lt;/ref&gt; Field was joined in the national office in [[Washington, DC]] by Administrative Secretary [[Marion Briggs]] and the following group of formal officials:

* [[John B. Thompson (protestant clergyman)|John B. Thompson]], Chairman
* [[Theodore Dreiser]], Vice Chairman
* [[Jack McMichael]], Vice Chairman
* [[Vito Marcantonio]], Vice Chairman
* [[Reid Robinson]], Vice Chairman
* [[Katherine Terrill]], Vice Chairman
* [[Max Yergan]], Vice Chairman

Since 2014, Artemivsk has been controlled by forces of the [[Luhansk People's Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gkslnr.su/files/chisl_0915.pdf|title=–ß–∏—Å–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –Ω–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –ø–æ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–∏—é –Ω–∞ 1  –æ–∫—Ç—è–±—Ä—è  2015 –≥–æ–¥–∞ –ø–æ  –õ—É–≥–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π –ù–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–π –†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–µ|publisher=[[Luhansk People's Republic]]|language=Russian|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Austria''' was the [[typeface]] formerly used on all official [[traffic sign|road signage]] in [[Austria]] made prior to 2010. A modified version of its German counterpart [[DIN 1451]], it came in narrow- and medium-width [[font]]s. Since 2010 it has been replaced on all new road signs by the more recently developed TERN (Trans-European Road Network) typeface.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4192">'''Canada's Access to Medicines Regime''' (CAMR) is a process established by the Canadian government that allows Canada to enact [[compulsory license]]s to export [[essential medicines]] to countries without the capacity to manufacture their own.

The Regime was established in 2004 by ''An Act to amend the Patent Act and the Food and Drugs Act'', also known as the "[[Jean Chr√©tien]] [[Pledge to Africa Act]]", along with other regulations, in a bill introduced as C-9 in the third session of the [[37th Canadian Parliament]].&lt;ref name="CAMR: Background"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camr-rcam.gc.ca/intro/context-eng.php|title=Background|publisher=CAMR|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It represented the first implementation of the [[TRIPS]] flexibilities declared in the August 30, 2003 General Council decision of the [[World Trade Organization]].

== History ==
CAMR gained force of law in 2004. At the time of a statutory governmental review in 2007, the Regime had not yet been used. The review concluded that, due to insufficient evidence, "the case for making legislative or regulatory changes to CAMR has not yet been made out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://camr-rcam.gc.ca/review-reviser/camr_rcam_report_rapport-eng.php|title=Report on the Statutory Review of Sections 21.01 to 21.19 of the Patent Act|publisher=CAMR|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CAMR has since been used once: in 2008-2009, [[Apotex]], Inc. used the Regime to manufacture and export two shipments of a patented [[antiretroviral]] medication to [[Rwanda]]. Apotex has since stated that it does not intend to use the Regime again unless it is reformed, claiming that the Regime imposes unnecessary bureaucratic and economic obstacles.&lt;ref name="Apotex press release: CAMR Federal Law Needs to be Fixed if Life-Saving Drugs for Children are to be Developed (May 14, 2009)"&gt;[http://www.apotex.com/global/about/press/20090514.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091020111516/http://www.apotex.com/global/about/press/20090514.asp |date=October 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A private members' bill that would reform the CAMR was tabled in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] (Bill C-393). The bill passed in the Commons on March 9, 2011 (172-111, including support from the [[Bloc Qu√©b√©cois]] and the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]], all but two Liberals and 26 Conservatives).&lt;ref&gt;[http://thechronicleherald.ca/TheNovaScotian/1245757.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110601195644/http://thechronicleherald.ca/TheNovaScotian/1245757.html |date=June 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thevarsity.ca/articles/45372 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709060732/http://thevarsity.ca/articles/45372 |date=July 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill then stalled in the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] and died on the [[order paper]] when the government fell.

Part of the challenge in providing medicine to Africa was highlighted by former U.S. President Bill Clinton at a meeting of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations on February 23, 2009. Speaking on Global Health Progress, Clinton stated,&lt;blockquote&gt;... my experience has been that almost no one in the world will die this year because of the cost or the lack of availability of AIDS medicine. But many people will die of  AIDS this year because of the absence of effective health care systems in rural areas of the poorest countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSO-00R_62o|title=Bill Clinton on Philanthropy and Global Public Health|work=YouTube|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This article is about the [[climate change policy of the United States]] under the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]].

==Kyoto Protocol==

In March 2001, the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]] announced that it would not implement the [[Kyoto Protocol]], an international treaty signed in 1997 in [[Kyoto, Japan]] that would require nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, claiming that ratifying the treaty would create economic setbacks in the U.S. and does not put enough pressure to limit emissions from developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Kirby, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1247518.stm US blow to Kyoto hopes], 2001-03-28, BBC News (online).&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2002, Bush announced his alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, by bringing forth a plan to reduce the intensity of greenhouse gases by 18 percent over 10 years. The intensity of greenhouse gases specifically is the ratio of greenhouse gas emissions and economic output, meaning that under this plan, emissions would still continue to grow, but at a slower pace. Bush stated that this plan would prevent the release of 500 million metric tons of greenhouse gases, which is about the equivalent of 70 million cars from the road. This target would achieve this goal by providing [[tax credits]] to businesses that use renewable energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/02/14/bush.global.warming/index.html Bush unveils voluntary plan to reduce global warming], CNN.com, 2002-02-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence of industry groups==

In June 2005, [[US State Department]] papers showed the Bush administration thanking [[Exxon]] executives for the company's "active involvement" in helping to determine climate change policy, including the U.S. stance on Kyoto. Input from the business lobby group [[Global Climate Coalition]] was also a factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John|last=Vidal |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jun/08/usnews.climatechange
|title=Revealed: how oil giant influenced Bush |newspaper=The Guardian|date=2005-06-08 |accessdate=2010-01-24 &lt;!--https://www.webcitation.org/5n191JJpJ--&gt; |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bush administration implemented an industry-formulated disinformation campaign designed to actively mislead the American public on global warming and to forestall limits on "climate polluters," according to a report in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine which reviews hundreds of internal government documents and former government officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tim |last=Dickinson |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/15148655/the_secret_campaign_of_president_george_bushs_administration_to_deny_global |title=The Secret Campaign of President Bush's Administration To Deny Global Warming  |newspaper=Rolling Stone |date=2007-06-08 |accessdate=2010-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'They've got a political clientele that does not want to be regulated,' says [[Rick S. Piltz]], a former Bush climate official who blew the whistle on White House censorship of global-warming documents in 2005. 'Any honest discussion of the science would stimulate public pressure for a stronger policy. They're not stupid.'

&lt;blockquote&gt;Bush's do-nothing policy on global warming began almost as soon as he took office. By pursuing a carefully orchestrated policy of delay, the White House blocked even the most modest reforms and replaced them with token investments in futuristic solutions like hydrogen cars. 'It's a charade,' says Jeremy Symons, who represented the EPA on [[Dick Cheney]]'s energy task force, the industry-studded group that met in secret to craft the administration's energy policy. 'They have a single-minded determination to do nothing‚Äîwhile making it look like they are doing something.' . . .

The [[Council on Environmental Quality|CEQ]] became Cheney's shadow EPA, with industry calling the shots. To head up the council, Cheney installed James Connaughton, a former lobbyist for industrial polluters, who once worked to help General Electric and ARCO skirt responsibility for their Superfund waste sites.

...two weeks after Bush took office - ExxonMobil's top lobbyist, Randy Randol, demanded a housecleaning of the scientists in charge of studying global warming. . .

...Exxon's wish was the CEQ's command.&lt;ref&gt;The Washington Post, June 21, 2007 "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2007/06/21/BL2007062101075_2.html?nav=hcmodule , citing the Rolling Stone investigative report published 2007/6/13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Political pressure on scientists==
{{See also|Politics and science in the United States}}

Also according to testimony taken by the U.S. House of Representatives, the Bush White House pressured American scientists to suppress discussion of global warming&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Reuters, January 30, 2007, free archived version at http://www.commondreams.org/headlines07/0130-10.htm, last visited Jan. 30, '07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Written testimony of Dr. Grifo before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the U.S. House of Representatives on January 30, 2007, archived at {{cite web|url=http://oversight.house.gov/Documents/20070130113153-55829.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805213620/http://oversight.house.gov/documents/20070130113153-55829.pdf |archivedate=2009-08-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"High-quality science" was "struggling to get out," as the Bush administration pressured scientists to tailor their writings on global warming to fit the Bush administration's skepticism, in some cases at the behest of an ex-oil industry lobbyist. "Nearly half of all respondents perceived or personally experienced pressure to eliminate the words 'climate change,' 'global warming' or other similar terms from a variety of communications."

Similarly, according to the testimony of senior officers of the [[Government Accountability Project]], the White House attempted to bury the report "National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change," produced by U.S. scientists pursuant to U.S. law.&lt;ref&gt;written testimony of Rick Piltz before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the U.S. House of Representatives on January 30, 2007, archived at http://oversight.house.gov/Documents/20070130113813-92288.pdf last visited Jan. 30, 07&lt;/ref&gt; Some U.S. scientists resigned their jobs rather than give in to White House pressure to underreport global warming.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Also, the White House removed key portions of a [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) report given to the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee about the [[effects of global warming on human health|dangers to human health of global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, Oct. 24, 2007, http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/G/GLOBAL_WARMING_HEALTH?SITE=NVREN&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT; also archived at http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/10/24/4772/&lt;/ref&gt; According to one CDC official familiar with both the CDC version and the version given to the Senate, the version given to the Senate was "eviscerated." The White House prevented the Senate and thus the public from receiving key CDC estimates in the report about diseases likely to flourish in a warmer climate, increased injuries and deaths from severe weather such as hurricanes, more respiratory problems from drought-driven air pollution, an increase in waterborne diseases including cholera, increases in vector-borne diseases including malaria and hantavirus, mental health problems such as depression and post-traumatic stress, and how many people might be adversely affected because of increased warming.

US officials, such as [[Philip Cooney]], have repeatedly edited scientific reports from US government scientists,

Climate scientist [[James E. Hansen]], director of NASA's [[Goddard Institute for Space Studies]], claimed in a widely cited ''New York Times'' article
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Andrew C. | last=Revkin | title=Climate Expert Says NASA Tried to Silence Him | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=January 29, 2006 | accessdate=2007-04-14 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/29/science/earth/29climate.html?ei=5088&amp;en=28e236da0977ee7f&amp;ex=1296190800&amp;pagewanted=all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
in 2006 that his superiors at the agency were trying to "censor" information "going out to the public." [[NASA]] denied this, saying that it was merely requiring that scientists make a distinction between personal, and official government, views in interviews conducted as part of work done at the agency. Several scientists working at the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] have made similar complaints;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Eilperin |first=Julie |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/05/AR2006040502150_pf.html |title=Climate Researchers Feeling Heat From White House |newspaper=The Washington Post |accessdate=2010-01-24|date=2006-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  once again, government officials said they were enforcing long-standing policies requiring government scientists to clearly identify personal opinions as such when participating in public interviews and forums.

In 2006, the [[BBC]]'s long-running current affairs series ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' investigated the issue, and was told that "scientific reports about global warming have been systematically changed and suppressed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Climate chaos: Bush's climate of fear | publisher=[[BBC]] Panorama | date=June 1, 2006 | accessdate=2007-04-14 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/5005994.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an Associated Press release on January 30, 2007,

&lt;blockquote&gt;...climate scientists at seven government agencies say they have been subjected to political pressure aimed at downplaying the threat of global warming.

The groups presented a survey that shows two in five of the 279 climate scientists who responded to a questionnaire complained that some of their scientific papers had been edited in a way that changed their meaning. Nearly half of the 279 said in response to another question that at some point they had been told to delete reference to "global warming" or "climate change" from a report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Groups Say Scientists Pressured On Warming | publisher=[[CBS News]] and [[Associated Press]] | date=January 30, 2007 | accessdate=2007-04-14 | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/30/politics/main2413400.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Critics writing in the ''Wall Street Journal'' editorial page claim that the survey
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Timothy | last=Donaghy |author2=Jennifer Freeman |author3=Francesca Grifo |author4=Karly Kaufman |author5=Tarek Maassarani |author6=Lexi Shultz  | chapter=Appendix A: UCS Climate Scientist Survey Text and Responses (Federal) | title=Atmosphere of Pressure &amp;ndash; Political Interference in Federal Climate Science | publisher=[[Union of Concerned Scientists]] &amp; [[Government Accountability Project]] |date=February 2007 | accessdate=2007-04-14 | url=http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/scientific_integrity/Atmosphere-of-Pressure.pdf | chapterurl=http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/scientific_integrity/Full-survey-instrument-with-responses.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
was itself unscientific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=James | last=Taranto | authorlink=James Taranto | title=They Call This Science? | publisher=[[OpinionJournal.com]] | date=February 1, 2007 | accessdate=2007-04-14 | url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/best/?id=110009609 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to suppress scientific information on global warming and other issues have been described by [[Chris Mooney (journalist)|Chris Mooney]] as constituting a [[The Republican War on Science|Republican War on Science]].

==Attempts to undermine U.S. and state efforts==

The Bush Administration worked to undermine [[U.S. state|state]] efforts to mitigate global warming. [[Mary Peters (politician)|Mary Peters]], the Transportation Secretary at that time, personally directed US efforts to urge governors and dozens of members of the House of Representatives to block California's first-in-the-nation limits on greenhouse gases from cars and trucks, according to e-mails obtained by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;"How the White House Worked to Scuttle California's Climate Law", San Francisco Chronicle, September 25, 2007

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4219">'''Consensus government''' is a form of [[consensus democracy]] [[system of government|government]] in [[Canada]] used in two of Canada's three federal territories ([[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]]) as well as in [[Nunatsiavut]], an [[autonomous area]] in the province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]].

The population of these jurisdictions are majority [[Indigenous peoples]]. The system developed in the Northwest Territories beginning during the 1970s, and was adopted by Nunavut when it came into existence in 1999.

==Origins and development==

In 1905, the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were separated from the then much larger Northwest Territories. The Yukon Territory had been created in 1898 to facilitate governance of the Yukon goldfields, and both Ontario and Quebec were granted large areas of northern lands. The remaining lands were considered to be unsettled by Europeans, largely inhabited by Dene, M√©tis and Inuit, and not requiring much governance. The Commissioner of the Northwest Territories, a functionary reporting to the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs in Ottawa, was given plenary governing authority.

A legislative council was convened from time to time of worthy notables, learned in matters involving the natives and northern development. The [[2nd Council of the Northwest Territories]] met sporadically, typically in Ottawa, and passed ordinances for the benefit of the territory.

Beginning during the 1950s and 1960s, some residents of the territory were appointed or elected to the council. These elected members were initially non-native, but in growing number, were Dene, M√©tis and Inuit. Members began to secure positions on the executive council, replacing appointed Ottawa administrators, and began to insist on a devolution of authority. In a series of letters, the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs gradually curtailed the authority of the commissioner and affirmed the authority of the assembly.

The first fully elected executive council elected in 1980 was led by [[George Braden]], and the system of consensus government developed from that date.

==Choosing leadership==

Members of the legislature are elected as independents from single member districts by [[plurality voting system|simple plurality]] voting. The legislature selects first the speaker, then the [[premier]],  and finally the [[Cabinet (government)#Westminster cabinets|cabinet]] members from amongst themselves. In each instance the candidate must obtain a majority of the votes cast. This means that multiple ballots may occur before a successful candidate is selected.

The premier has three main authorities. The premier:
# names the portfolios of each minister and can remove or adjust these,
# controls the agenda of the cabinet/executive council, and
# hires, rewards, and dismisses the deputy department heads.

The passage of legislation and the government is dependent on retaining the [[confidence (politics)|confidence]] of the legislature. However, due to the absence of political parties there is no formal [[opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]] and instead of party [[caucuses]] members regularly participate in a caucus of all members of the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14462">'''Deprescribing''' is the process of intentionally stopping a [[medication]] or reducing its dose to improve the person's health or reduce the risk of adverse [[side effect]]s.  Deprescribing is usually done because the drug may be causing harm, may no longer be helping the patient, or may be inappropriate for the individual patient's current situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reeve | first1 = E | last2 = Gnjidic | first2 = D | last3 = Long | first3 = J | last4 = Hilmer | first4 = S | year = 2015 | title = A systematic review of the emerging definition of "deprescribing" with network analysis: implications for future research and clinical practice | url = | journal = Br J Clin Pharmacol | volume =  80| issue = | pages =  1254‚Äì1268| doi = 10.1111/bcp.12732 | pmc = 4693477 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = W | last2 = Farrell | first2 = B | date = May 2013 | title = Deprescribing: what is it and what does the evidence tell us? | url = | journal = Can J Hosp Pharm | volume = 66 | issue = 3| pages = 201‚Äì202 | doi=10.4212/cjhp.v66i3.1261| pmc = 3694945 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deprescribing is the opposite of [[Medical prescription|prescribing]] a drug. It can help correct [[polypharmacy]] and [[prescription cascade]].

Deprescribing is often done with people who have multiple chronic conditions, for elderly people, and for people who have a limited life expectancy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gnjidic | first1 = D | last2 = Le Couteur | first2 = DG | last3 = Kouladjian | first3 = L | last4 = Hilmer | first4 = SN | year = 2012 | title = Deprescribing trials: methods to reduce polypharmacy and the impact on prescribing and clinical outcomes | url = | journal = Clin Geriatr Med | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 237‚Äì253 | doi=10.1016/j.cger.2012.01.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all of these situations, certain medications may contribute to an increased risk of adverse events, and people may benefit from a reduction in the amount of medication taken.  The goal of deprescribing is to reduce medication burden and harm, while maintaining or improving quality of life.  "Simply because a patient has tolerated a therapy for a long duration does not mean that it remains an appropriate treatment. Thoughtful review of a patient‚Äôs medication regimen in the context of any changes in medical status and potential future benefits should occur regularly, and those agents that may no longer be necessary should be considered for a trial of medication discontinuation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Simon|first2=Steven R.|date=8 April 2013|title=Reversing Gears: Discontinuing Medication Therapy to Prevent Adverse Events: Comment on "Proton Pump Inhibitors and Risk of 1-Year Mortality and Rehospitalization in Older Patients Discharged From Acute Care Hospitals|url=http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1657768|journal=JAMA Intern Med|volume=173|issue=7|pages=524‚Äì525|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2013.4068|first1=Amy|last1=Linsky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of deprescribing can be planned and supervised by health care professionals. The definition and concept of deprescribing remain contentious with people using the term deprescribing to mean different things.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Page|first=Amy|last2=Clifford|first2=Rhonda|last3=Potter|first3=Kathleen|last4=Etherton-Beer|first4=Christopher|title=A concept analysis of deprescribing medications in older people|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jppr.1361/abstract|journal=Journal of Pharmacy Practice and Research|language=en|pages=n/a‚Äìn/a|doi=10.1002/jppr.1361|issn=2055-2335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
Older people are the heaviest users of medications, and frequently take five or more medications (polypharmacy).  [[Polypharmacy]] is associated with increased risks of adverse events, drug interactions, [[Falls in older adults|falls]], hospitalization, cognitive deficits,{{Better source|date=January 2017}} and mortality. Thus, optimizing medication through targeted deprescribing is a vital part of managing chronic conditions, avoiding adverse effects and improving outcomes.

==Evidence base==
{{POV-section|date=March 2017}}

Deprescribing is a feasible and safe intervention.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Page | first1 = A.T. | last2 = Clifford | first2 = R.M. | last3 = Potter | first3 = K. | last4 = Schwartz | first4 = D. | last5 = Etherton-Beer | first5 = C.D. | year = 2016 | title = The feasibility and the effect of deprescribing in older adults on mortality and health: A systematic review | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bcp.12975/abstract | journal = British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume =  82| issue = | pages =  583‚Äì623| doi=10.1111/bcp.12975 | pmid=27077231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deprescribing results in fewer medications with no significant changes in health outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Potter | first1 = K. | last2 = Flicker | first2 = L. | last3 = Page | first3 = A. | last4 = Etherton-Beer | first4 = C. | year = 2016 | title = Deprescribing in frail older people: a randomised controlled trial | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 11 | issue = 3| page = e0149984 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0149984 | pmid=26942907 | pmc=4778763}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|date=August 2016}}  A systematic review of deprescribing studies for a wide range of medications, including diuretics, blood pressure medication, sedatives, antidepressants, benzodiazepines and nitrates, concluded that adverse effects of deprescribing were rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Naganathan|first2=V|last3=McLachlan|first3=AJ|last4=Le Couteur|first4=DG|year=2008|title=Medication withdrawal trials in people aged 65 years and older: a systematic review|url=|journal=Drugs Aging|volume=25|issue=12|pages=1021‚Äì31|doi=10.2165/0002512-200825120-00004|last1=Iyer|first1=S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="israel2"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Mangin|first2=D|year=2010|title=Feasibility study of a systematic approach for discontinuation of multiple medications in older adults|url=|journal=Arch Intern Med|volume=170|issue=18|pages=1648‚Äì54|doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2010.355|last1=Garfinkel|first1=D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By deprescribing medications, prescribers are often able to improve patient function, generate a higher quality of life, and reduce bothersome signs and symptoms.  Deprescribing has been shown to reduce the number of falls that people experience, but not to change the risk of having the first fall.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A large systematic review of deprescribing studies found that most health outcomes remained unchanged as an effect of deprescribing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The absence in a change has been viewed as a positive outcome as the medications can often be safely withdrawn without altering health outcomes. This absence of an effect means that older people may not miss out on potentially beneficial effects of using medications as a result of deprescribing.

Targeted deprescribing can improve adherence to other drugs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Deprescribing can reduce the complexity of medication schedules.  Complicated schedules are difficult for people to follow correctly.

The European Journal of Hospital Pharmacy carried a special issue in 2017 dedicated to deprescribing and associated issues, with editorials and research articles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=European Journal of Hospital Pharmacy: 24 (1)|journal=Eur J Hosp Pharm|date=1 January 2017|volume=24|issue=1|url=http://ejhp.bmj.com/content/24/1|language=en|issn=2047-9956}}&lt;/ref&gt;. An article in 2018 highlighted developments in this topic, with recommnedations for education and awareness in staff and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Nina|last2=Garfinkel|first2=Doron|title=Deprescribing one year on: challenging the first iatrogenic epidemic|journal=Eur J Hosp Pharm|date=27 January 2018|pages=ejhpharm‚Äì2017‚Äì001482|doi=10.1136/ejhpharm-2017-001482|url=http://ejhp.bmj.com/content/early/2018/01/27/ejhpharm-2017-001482|language=en|issn=2047-9956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks==
It is possible for the patient to develop adverse [[drug withdrawal]] events (ADWE).&lt;ref name="graves"&gt;Graves T, Hanlon JT, Schmader KE, Landsman PB, Samsa GP, Pieper CF, Weinberger M. Adverse events after discontinuing medications in elderly outpatients. Arch Intern Med. 1997 Oct 27;157(19):2205-10.&lt;/ref&gt; These symptoms may be related to the original reason why the medication was prescribed, to withdrawal symptoms or to underlying diseases that have been masked by medications.&lt;ref name="woodward"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woodward | first1 = Michael C. |date=December 2003 | title = Deprescribing: Achieving better health outcomes for older people through reducing medications | url =http://jppr.shpa.org.au/lib/pdf/gt/Dec2003.pdf |format=PDF | journal = J Pharm Pract Res | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 323‚Äì328 | doi=10.1002/jppr2003334323}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For some medications, ADWEs can generally be minimized or avoided by tapering the dose slowly and carefully monitoring for symptoms. Prescribers should be aware of which medications usually require tapering (such as [[corticosteroid]]s and [[benzodiazepine]]s), and which can be safely stopped suddenly (such as [[antibiotics]] and [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s).

===Monitoring===
Deprescribing requires detailed follow-up and monitoring, not unlike the attention required when starting a new medication. It is recommended that prescribers frequently monitor "relevant signs, symptom, laboratory or diagnostic tests that were the original indications for starting the medication" as well as for potential withdrawal effects.&lt;ref name="israel2" /&gt;

===Helpful tools===
Several tools have been published to make prescribers aware of inappropriate medications for patient groups. For example, the [[Beers Criteria]] and the STOPP/START criteria present medications that may be inappropriate for use in the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18218287 | volume=46 | title=STOPP (Screening Tool of Older Person's Prescriptions) and START (Screening Tool to Alert doctors to Right Treatment).

==Barriers==
Although many trials have successfully resulted in a reduction in medication use, there are some barriers to deprescribing:
* the prescriber's beliefs, attitudes, knowledge, skills, and behaviour&lt;ref name="Stowasser"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=K |last2=Stowasser |first2=D |last3=Freeman |first3=C |last4=Scott |first4=I |date=8 December 2014 |title=Prescriber barriers and enablers to minimising potentially inappropriate medications in adults: a systematic review and thematic synthesis |journal=BMJ Open |volume=4|issue=12 |page=e006544 |pmid=25488097 |pmc=4265124 |doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2014-006544 |url=http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/4/12/e006544.full }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the prescriber's work environment, including work setting, health system and cultural factors&lt;ref name="Stowasser" /&gt;
* the patient's agreement that deprescribing was appropriate,&lt;ref name="Reeve"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Emily |last1=Reeve |first2=Josephine |last2=To |first3=Ivanka |last3=Hendrix |first4=Sepehr |last4=Shakib |first5=Michael S. |last5=Roberts |first6=Michael D. |last6=Wiese | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40266-013-0106-8 | doi=10.1007/s40266-013-0106-8 | volume=30 | title=Patient Barriers to and Enablers of Deprescribing: a Systematic Review | journal=Drugs &amp; Aging | pages=793‚Äì807}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the patient's need for a structured process for cessation,&lt;ref name="Reeve" /&gt; 
* the patients' need for influences or reasons to cease medication,&lt;ref name="Reeve" /&gt; and
* patients' fears about cessation or dislike of medications.&lt;ref name="Reeve" /&gt;

==Views==
Murdock opposes governmental involvement in issues relating to both gay and heterosexual marriage.  He also opposes the [[War on Drugs]].&lt;ref&gt;Murdock, Deroy. [http://www.nationalreview.com/murdock/murdock030403.asp "Fight Bombs, Not Bongs"] ''[[National Review Online]].'' March 4, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005, Murdock went on record calling the New Orleans' [[Danziger Bridge shootings]], involving the killing of innocent civilians by the [[NOPD]] and subsequent cover-up,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-12-01/justice/louisiana.katrina.shootings_1_james-brissette-danziger-bridge-lance-madison?_s=PM:CRIME | work=CNN | title=Ex-New Orleans cops get prison time in Danziger Bridge shootings | date=April 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a "magnificent and morally pristine use of force".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| work=[[National Review]]|title=Bumblers Not Bigots|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/215348/bumblers-not-bigots/deroy-murdock }}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Radley Balko claims that Murdock has yet to retract his written account of the shootings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theagitator.com/2010/12/19/deroy-murdock-wikileaks-and-the-danziger-bridge/ Theagitator.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

He said on MSNBC's ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]'' on September 16, 2007 that he believes [[Saddam Hussein]] was involved in perpetrating the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attack]] on America. Murdock cited ''Smith v. Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan'', 262 F. Supp. 2d 217,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/courtweb/pdf/D02NYSC/03-04142.PDF ''Smith v. Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan''] US District Court for the Southern District of New York&lt;/ref&gt; a federal case heard by U.S. District Judge [[Harold Baer, Jr.]].
In ''Smith v. Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan'', Judge Baer ruled that Hussein's [[Ba'athism|Baathist]] government and the [[Taliban]] assisted Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda. Judge Baer‚Äîwhom [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] nominated in April 1994‚Äîordered Hussein, Iraq's former government, and this case's other losing parties to pay $104 million in civil damages to the families of George Eric Smith and Timothy Soulas, both murdered on September 11, 2001 at the World Trade Center. Judge Baer added: "Again, since the al-Qaeda defendants and Iraq are jointly and severally liable, they are all responsible for the payment of any judgment that may be entered."

Murdock wrote ''Chill Out on Climate Hysteria'' for the ''[[National Review]]'' where he stated that some scientists are skeptics of [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/article/224354/chill-out-climate-hysteria-deroy-murdock  "Chill Out on Climate Hysteria"] ''National Review'',  May 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8658">The '''Direct Action Committee''' ('''DAC''') against [[nuclear war]] was a [[pacifism|pacifist]] organisation formed "to assist the conducting of [[Nonviolent direct action|non-violent direct action]] to obtain the total renunciation of nuclear war and its weapons by Britain and all other countries as a first step in disarmament".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brad.ac.uk/library/special/documents/CwlDACCLD.pdf ''Records of the Direct Action Committee Against Nuclear War'', University of Bradford]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bradford&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive of the Direct Action Committee Against Nuclear War  - University of Bradford|url=https://www.bradford.ac.uk/library/special-collections/collections/archive-of-the-direct-action-committee-against-nuclear-war/#committee|website=www.bradford.ac.uk|accessdate=26 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It existed from 1957 to 1961.

==Origins==
The DAC was formed in response to the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[H-Bomb]] [[Operation Grapple|tests]] carried out between 1956 and 1958.  In 1957, at the time of one of the tests on [[Christmas Island]], Harold Steele planned to sail into the test area in protest.&lt;ref name=bradford/&gt;  He was unable to do so&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.lse.ac.uk/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&amp;id=CND%2f2008%2f2 LSE Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; but his supporters formed a committee and marched in support to the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment]] at [[Aldermaston]].

The original committee comprised: 

*[[J. Allen Skinner]]
*[[Hugh Brock]] and
*[[Arlo Tatum]].&lt;ref&gt;Arlo Tatum is by origin American.  He was the national co-ordinator of the [[Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors]] and produced the ''Handbook for Conscientious Objectors'' (1952) and ''Guide to the draft'' (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

They were soon joined by:

*[[Michael Randle]] (who became Chair)
*[[April Carter]] (Secretary)
*[[Pat Arrowsmith]] (Field Secretary)
*Michael Scott and
*Will Warren.&lt;ref name=bradford/&gt;

By the end of 1958 the Committee's members also included [[Alex Comfort]], Frances Edwards, Sheila Jones, Francis Jude and Michael Howard&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/12th-april-1963/11/the-story-of-cnd|title=The Story of C.N.D.|last=Greer|first=Herb|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (of the Crusade for World Government) &lt;ref name="driver"&gt;Christopher Driver, ''The Disarmers: A Study in Protest'', London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;  who later served as adjutant to Bertrand Russell during his dispute with Canon John Collins over the legitimacy of direct action&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Selected Letters of Bertrand Russell: The Public Years, 1914-1970|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=539}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Actions==

The DAC's march from London to Aldermaston at Easter, 1958, for which DAC Committee member Michael Howard was the Chief Marshall was, in the event, supported by the newly formed [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] (CND), and in the upsurge of popular opposition to the [[H-bomb]] attracted thousands of people. The [[Aldermaston March]] was subsequently run as an annual event by CND. 

The DAC organised meetings, marches, vigils and pickets, campaigned in parliamentary elections&lt;ref name=bradford/&gt; and carried out acts of [[civil disobedience]] to publicise the pacifist cause.&lt;ref name=bradford/&gt; Following the principles of the Indian nationalist leader [[M.K.Gandhi]], they believed their actions should be [[non-violent]] and carried out at some personal cost to themselves, such as losing their jobs or going to jail.&lt;ref name=bradford/&gt;&lt;ref name=lovell/&gt; 

What differentiated them from other peace organisations at the time was their attempt to persuade people to stop working in industries connected with nuclear weapons, in which they had some successes.&lt;ref name=lovell/&gt; After the 1958 Aldermaston march, the DAC stayed in the Aldermaston area to try to stop work at the Atomic Weapons Establishment. They picketed, met with trades unions, held factory gate meetings and canvassed in the surrounding villages.&lt;ref name=lovell/&gt;  As a result, five workers resigned from their jobs, three job applicants withdrew and five drivers refused to deliver to the establishment.&lt;ref name=lovell&gt;[http://www.amielandmelburn.org.uk/collections/ulr/06_05.pdf Allen Lovell, "Where Next for the Campaign?" ''Universities and Left Review'', No.6, Spring 1959]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=14439 "Pat Arrowsmith recalls organising against Britain's Bomb", ''Socialist Worker'', 22 March 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; The DAC then moved to [[Norfolk]] to campaign against the [[PGM-17 Thor|Thor]] nuclear missiles at an [[RAF]] base at [[RAF North Pickenham|North Pickenham]], using similar methods to those they had used at Aldermaston. One worker left the base and others said they would do so if they could find other jobs.&lt;ref name=lovell/&gt; They then moved to [[Stevenage]], Hertfordshire, to campaign against the [[de Havilland]] and [[English Electric]] factories, which made guided missiles.&lt;ref name=bradford2&gt;[http://www.brad.ac.uk/library/special/cwlDAC.php ''Records of the Direct Action Committee Against Nuclear War'', University of Bradford,]&lt;/ref&gt;

The DAC ran a "No votes for the H-bomb" campaign in the [[South West Norfolk by-election, 1959]]. They worked with similar organisations outside the UK, demonstrating against nuclear tests in the [[Sahara Desert]] and in a peace march from San Francisco to Moscow, organised by the [[Committee for Non-Violent Action]] in 1961.&lt;ref name=bradford2/&gt; Their final action before being wound up was a demonstration against the [[UK Polaris programme|Polaris]] nuclear submarine in spring, 1961.

==Demise==

The formation in 1960 of the [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)|Committee of 100]], a mass civil disobedience movement against nuclear weapons, plus considerable financial difficulties, led to the decision in June 1961 to wind down the DAC. Most of its members were active in the Committee of 100.&lt;ref name=bradford2/&gt;

==Assessment==
As long as it lasted, the DAC was effectively the direct-action wing of CND, whose leadership were either uncertain about direct action or opposed to it.  There was an overlap between supporters of CND and supporters of the DAC.  The sponsors of the DAC included the president of CND ([[Bertrand Russell]]), three members of CND's executive committee and other CND leaders.  [[Pat Arrowsmith]], a pacifist and consistent supporter of direct action, was appointed assistant secretary of CND after the first Aldermaston March.  The DAC depended on the support of many local CND groups and was also given money by the CND executive committee.&lt;ref name=driver/&gt;

However, there were differences in age, background and political experience between the members of DAC and the CND leadership, and there were considerable differences in tactics and ideology.&lt;ref name=driver/&gt;  [[Christopher Driver]] in his book on the early years of CND says of the DAC, "For the most part the members of the DAC were people of exceptionally pure motives. ... Unlike the CND Executive, and unlike some of their successors in the Committee of 100 into which the DAC was eventually merged, many DAC members were not particularity interested in the local and national publicity which their actions evoked, except insofar as it helped to make converts to Gandhi's ideas on non-violent action."&lt;ref name=driver/&gt;

At its most basic level, a '''formulary''' is a list of [[Pharmaceutical drug|medicines]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/formulary Formulary Definition]&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, a formulary contained a collection of formulas for the [[compounding]] and testing of medication (a resource closer to what would be referred to as a [[pharmacopoeia]] today). Today, the main function of a prescription formulary is to specify particular medications that are approved to be [[Medical prescription|prescribed]] at a particular [[hospital]], in a particular [[health system]], or under a particular [[health insurance]] policy. The development of prescription formularies is based on evaluations of efficacy, safety, and [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost-effectiveness]] of drugs.

Depending on the individual formulary, it may also contain additional clinical information, such as [[adverse effect|side effects]], [[contraindication]]s, and [[dose (biochemistry)|doses]].

By the turn of the millennium, 156 countries had ''national'' or ''provincial [[essential medicines]] lists'' and 135 countries had national treatment guidelines and/or formulary manuals.

==Australia==
In Australia, where there is a public health care system, medications are subsidised under the [[Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme]] (PBS) and medications that are available under the PBS and the indications for which they can be obtained under said scheme can be found in at least two places, the PBS webpage&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pbs.gov.au/pbs/home&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Australian Medicines Handbook]].

==United States==
In the US, where a system of quasi-private healthcare is in place, a formulary is a list of [[prescription drug]]s available to enrollees, and a tiered formulary provides financial incentives for patients to select lower-cost drugs. For example, under a 3-tier formulary, the first tier typically includes generic drugs with the lowest cost sharing (e.g., 10% coinsurance), the second includes preferred brand-name drugs with higher cost sharing (e.g., 25%), and the third includes non-preferred brand-name drugs with the highest cost-sharing (e.g., 40%).&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=1403290 | pmid=16050866 | doi=10.1111/j.1525-1497.2005.0110.x | volume=20 | title=The new medicare drug benefit: formularies and their potential effects on access to medications | author=Huskamp HA, Keating NL | journal=J Gen Intern Med | pages=662‚Äì5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When used appropriately, formularies can help manage drug costs imposed on the insurance policy.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; However, for drugs that are not on formulary, patients must pay a larger percentage of the cost of the drug, sometimes 100%. Formularies vary between drug plans and differ in the breadth of drugs covered and costs of co-pay and [[Insurance premium|premiums]]. Most formularies cover at least one drug in each drug class, and encourage [[Generic drug|generic]] substitution (also known as a preferred drug list).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.health.state.ny.us/health_care/medicaid/program/medicaid_transition/definitions.htm New York State Department of Health]&lt;/ref&gt; Formularies have shown to cause issues in hospitals when patients are discharged when not aligned with outpatient drug insurance plans. &lt;ref&gt;Chua, D., Chu, E., Lo, A., Lo, M., Pataky, F., Tang, L., &amp; Bains Ajaysharn. (2012). Effect of Misalignment between Hospital and Provincial Formularies on Medication Discrepancies at Discharge: PPITS (Proton Pump Inhibitor Therapeutic Substitution) Study. The Canadian Journal of Hospital Pharmacy, 65(2), 98‚Äì102. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3329923/&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
In the UK, the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) provides [[publicly funded health care|publicly funded]] [[universal health care]], financed by [[national health insurance]]. Here, formularies exist to specify which drugs are available on the NHS. The two main reference sources providing this information are the ''[[British National Formulary]]'' (''BNF'') and the [[Drug Tariff]]. There is a section in the Drug Tariff, known unofficially as the "[[Blacklisted (medicine)|Blacklist]]", detailing medicines which are not to be prescribed under the NHS and must be paid for [[private healthcare|privately]] by the patient.

In addition to this, local [[NHS hospital trust]]s and [[Primary Care]] ([[General Practitioner]]s) [[Clinical Commissioning Group]]s (CCGs), produce their own lists of medicines deemed preferable for prescribing within their locality or organisation; such lists are usually a subset of the more comprehensive BNF. These formularies are not absolutely binding, and [[physicians]] may prescribe a non-formulary medicine if they consider it necessary and justifiable. Often, these local formularies are shared between a Primary Care Organisation (PCO) and hospitals within that PCO's jurisdiction, in order to facilitate the procedure of transferring a patient from [[primary care]] to [[secondary care]], thus causing fewer "interfacing" issues in the process.

As in the United States, the NHS actively encourages [[Generic drug|generic]] prescribing, in order to save more of the budget allocated to them by the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]].

==National formulary==
A national formulary contains a list of medicines that are approved for [[medical prescription|prescription]] throughout the country, indicating which products are interchangeable. It includes key information on the composition, description, selection, prescribing, dispensing and administration of medicines. Those drugs considered less suitable for prescribing are clearly identified.

Examples of national formularies are:
* ''[[Australian Pharmaceutical Formulary]]''
* ''[[British National Formulary]]'' and ''[[British National Formulary for Children]]''
* ''[[Farmacotherapeutisch Kompas]]'', the Dutch national formulary
* ''Indian National Formulary''
* ''Kazakhstan National Formulary''
* ''[[Sri Lanka]]n Formulary''
* ''United States National Formulary'', since bought out and merged with the [[United States Pharmacopeia]]
* {{anchor|FASS}} The [[Sweden|Swedish]] national formulary ''FASS'' (''Farmaceutiska Specialiteter i Sverige'').

'''Haukr''' or '''Hauk Erlendsson''' (died 1334) was [[lawspeaker]] (lawman) of Iceland, later lawspeaker and knight of Norway, known for having compiled a number of Icelandic sagas and other materials mostly in his own hand, bound in a book called the ''[[Hauksb√≥k]]'' after him.

==Life==
&lt;!--Family history--&gt;
Hauk was born the son of {{Interlanguage link multi|Erlend Olafsson the Strong|2=is|3=Erlendur √ìlafsson sterki|preserve=1}} aka Erlend ''digre'' "the fat," who died 1312.&lt;ref name="owl-nfbk"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|ref=harv|last=√ñverland|first=O.

(Ole Andreas)|authorlink=:no:Ole Andreas √òverland|title=Haukr Erlendsson|work=Nordisk familjebok|volume=11|year=1909|pages=96-|format=Runeberg|url=http://runeberg.org/nfbk/0064.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maldage-1313"/&gt;&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;"Erlendur digre" occurs in a letter by Bishop [[√Årni √ûorl√°ksson]] of [[Sk√°lholt]] dated 1286, ''[[#Diplomatarium2|Diplomatarium islandicum]]'', Vol. II, p.136-7. Cf. {{cite book|ref=harv|editor=J√≥n Sigur√∞sson|editor2=Gu√∞brandur Vigf√∫sson|title=Biskupa S√∂gur|volume=1|place=Kaupmannah√∂fn|publisher=S.L. M√∂ller|year=1858|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FGEAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA755 |page=755}}, whose index clarifies this refers to Erlendur √ìlafsson sterki&lt;/ref&gt; The year of Haukr's birth is not known,&lt;ref name="sturlunga-pref"/&gt; but his mother's name was Jorunn ({{lang-non|J√≥runn}}),&lt;ref&gt;''Landn√°mab√≥k'' Part II, Ch. XIX (''[[#islandinga-sogur1|Islandinga s√∂gur]]'', Vol. 1, p. 138; {{Harvnb|Ellwood|1898|page=86}}). Hogni the White had a son Eirek ‚Äî Geirleif ‚Äî Oddleif ‚Äî Gest. Gest's daughter Halla's son Thorgils seems to have married Gest's daughter Thorey, and followed by the line: Thorarin ‚Äî Jodis (daughter) ‚Äî Illugi ‚Äî Eyvind ‚Äî Steingrim ‚Äî Helga ‚Äî Jorun ‚Äî Hauk)&lt;/ref&gt; whose ancestry is traceable to a brother of King Halfr of [[Hordaland]], hero of ''[[H√°lfs saga ok H√°lfsrekka]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Munch|1847|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;Hogni the White given in ''Landn√°mab√≥k'' Part II, Ch. XIX as the forebear of Hauk Erelendson's mother was the grandson of Otrygg, brother of King Halfr according to an earlier passage (''Landn√°mab√≥k'' Part II, Ch. XIX {{Harvnb|Ellwood|1898|pages=74}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;As an aside, Hogni the White had one son Eirek (from whom Haukr is descended), and another son Ulf the Squinter (√ölfr inn skj√°lgr), who accompanied his kinsman Geirrid son of Geirmund Hellskin, son of Hjor, son of Half into Iceland. Ulf the Squinter's son Jorunn had a daughter Thjodhild who became the wife of [[Erik the Red]]. (''Landn√°mab√≥k'' Part II, Ch. XIX, loc. cit. and Ch. XXII, {{Harvnb|Ellwood|1898|pages=81‚Äì82}}) Thus Hauk was also distantly (not directly) related to [[Leif Eiriksson]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Hauk may have been an illegitimate offspring,&lt;ref name="sturlunga-pref"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|editor=Gu√∞brandur Vigf√∫sson |editor-link=Gu√∞brandur Vigf√∫sson |title=Sturlunga saga: including the Islendinga saga of Lawman Sturla |volume=1 |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1878 |page=clxi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m5wNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR161 |quote=we know who his mother, father, and grandmother were, his birth-year is not known... A son of Lawman Erlend the Strong, by Jorun, and base born...etc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the question of whether his mother was Erlend's "first wife or mistress" is an open speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Perkins |first=Richard |title=Fl√≥amanna Saga, Gaulverjab√¶r and Haukr Erlendsson |publisher=B√≥ka√∫tg√°fa Menningarsj√≥s√∞s |year=1978 |series=√çslenzk fr√¶√∞i (Studia Islandica) |volume=36 |format=snippet |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sAQeAQAAIAAJ |page=36 |quote="Jorunn's home (whether she was Erlendr's first wife or mistress)"}}&lt;/ref&gt; At any rate it is clear Hauk had a stepmother at some point, since Jarngerd ({{lang-non|J√°rnger√∞r}}) is called Erlend's wife in the ''Landnamab√≥k''&lt;ref&gt;Jarngerd, descended from [[Egil Skallagrimsson]], married to Erelend in: ''Landn√°mab√≥k'' Part II, Ch. IV (''[[#islandinga-sogur1|Islandinga s√∂gur]]'', Vol. 1, p. 76n; however, this tract is not appended to Ch. IV in the {{Harvnb|Ellwood|1898}}) translation)&lt;/ref&gt; and this Jarngerd was beyond doubt the wife who survived Erlend's death in 1312.&lt;ref name="maldage-1313"&gt;Editors' preface to the  ''maldage'' (oral contract or bequest made by Jarngerd) to Neskirkja, i.e. the Church of Mary in Nesi √≠ Selvogi, Iceland (in the former {{Interlanguage link multi|Selvogshreppur|2=is|3=Selvogshreppur|preserve=1}}, [[√Årness√Ωsla]] county, now part of [[√ûorl√°ksh√∂fn]], Municipality of [[√ñlfus]]). From manuscript AM 263., fol., f.55 (written down 1598), in: ''[[#Diplomatarium2|Diplomatarium islandicum]]'', Vol. II, p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt; Hauk also had a half-sister named Valgerd, born to Jarngerd.

Hauk married Steinunn, a descendant of Hrafn Sveinbjornsson.&lt;ref name="landnamabok-2-25"&gt;''Landnamab√≥k'', Part III, Ch. XXV: Steinunn, er Haukr Erlendson √°tti" (''[[#islandinga-sogur1|Islandinga s√∂gur]]'', Vol. 1, p.105) ;  "Steinun, whom Hawk the son of Erlend had for wife." ({{Harvnb|Ellwood|1898|p=85}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;{{harvnb|Gu√∞brandur Vigf√∫sson|1878|loc=''Sturlunga saga'', p.&amp;nbsp;clxi}} says the wife was the granddaughter of Hrafn Sveinbiornsson, but according to  ''Landnamabok'' Part V, Ch. IX, the Steinunn who was Rafn (Hrafn)'s granddaughter was a great aunt of the Steinunn who married Hauk Erlendsson. i.e., the Steinunn in question was Hrafn's great-great-grandfather.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Education--&gt;
Hauk's father Erlend became [[lawspeaker]] (''l√∂gma√∞r'')  of  [[Iceland]] in 1287, went overseas in 1289, retired as lawspeaker and was awarded the [[Westfjords]] in 1290 or 1292 according to some sources.&lt;ref&gt;Dateline under Addendum II "Vi√∞rauki Melab√≥kar ennar √Ωngri", ''[[#islandinga-sogur1|Islandinga s√∂gur]]'', Vol. 1, p.340&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhere along, though not in his early years, Hauk was educated abroad in Norway, where "he owes his whole education".&lt;ref name="sturlunga-pref"/&gt;

&lt;!--Career--&gt;
Like his father before him, Hauk became lawspeaker of Iceland no later than 1294,&lt;ref name="sturlunga-pref"/&gt; serving the post until 1299.&lt;ref name="owl-nfbk"/&gt;  Around 1301 he arrived in [[Norway]], and served from 1303 to 1322 as lawspeaker ({{lang-no|lagmann}}) in Oslo and on the [[Gula Thing]].&lt;ref name="owl-nfbk"/&gt; Sometime after 1303, he is mentioned as being on the king's council.&lt;ref name="owl-nfbk"/&gt; He was also one of the men who ruled to recognize [[Magnus IV of Sweden]] as king over Norway.&lt;ref name="owl-nfbk"/&gt;

During this period, lawmen may or may not be conferred the title of ''herra'' (at least those in Iceland),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|W√¶rdahl|2011|pp=194‚Äì5}}&lt;/ref&gt; at any rate, Hauk serving in Norway is addressed as "herra" in a 1309 letter,&lt;ref&gt;September 1309 √¨ Bj√∂rgvin, ''[[#Diplomatarium2|Diplomatarium islandicum]]'', Vol. II, p. 367.&lt;/ref&gt; and in a letter dating from 1311, he is called "the lawspeaker of the Gula Thing and knight."&lt;ref&gt;12. Januar 1311 √¨„ÄÄBj√∂rgvin, quote: "Haukr Erlendzson Gula√æings logma√∞r riddari", ''[[#Diplomatarium2|Diplomatarium islandicum]]'', Vol. II, p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
The ''[[Hauksb√≥k]]'' is a compilation that includes Icelandic sagas and a redaction of the [[Landn√°mab√≥k]], as well as an arithmetical treatise called the ''Algorismus''. Among the sagas included is a version of ''[[Eir√≠ks saga rau√∞a]]'', which includes the accounts of the exploration and the attempted colonization in the American continent by [[Thorfinn Karlsefni]], whom Hauk counts as one of his ancestors. He also penned "Hauk's Annals," which chronicled the events of his lifetime.&lt;ref name="sturlunga-pref"/&gt;

==Family tree==
The following stemma is drawn from the genealogy appended to the last chapter of ''[[Eir√≠ks saga rau√∞a]]'' in Hauk's own recension (in the ''Hauksb√≥k'', supplemented with additional information from the ''Landn√°mab√≥k'').

The '''Hearts of Oak''', also known as '''Oakboys''' and '''Greenboys''', was a protest movement of farmers and weavers that arose in [[County Armagh]], [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] in 1761. Their grievances were the paying of ever increasing county [[cess]], [[tithes]], and small dues. The Hearts of Oak name came from the wearing of a piece of oak in their hats.&lt;ref name="Donnelly"/&gt; By the end of the protests the movement had spread to the neighbouring counties of [[County Cavan|Cavan]], [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]], [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[County Monaghan|Monaghan]], and [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]].&lt;ref name="Donnelly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bardon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CAHoO"/&gt;

==Origins and grievances==
The Hearts of Oak movement started in 1761 in [[County Armagh]], Ireland's then most populous county.&lt;ref name="Bardon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CAHoO"/&gt; The first ground of complaint was that every man was forced to give six days' work in the year and six days' work of a horse, for making or repairing roads, which the gentry often turned to their own use, while they themselves contributed nothing.&lt;ref name=Joyce&gt;[http://www.libraryireland.com/JoyceHistory/Societies.php Joyce, P.W., "Irish Secret Societies (1760-1762)", ''A Concise History of Ireland'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Their chief grievance appears to have been the [[Toll road|turnpike]] toll gates, which they went about demolishing. In 1763 the county [[cess]] (tax) was increased to help pay for the improvements in the country's transport network which was needed due to the rapid expansion of the linen industry in Ulster.&lt;ref name="Bardon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Connolly"/&gt; Another grievance to which the Oakboys where vehement about was the paying of the tithe to the [[Church of Ireland]], which the state church was entitled to collect from the local population regardless of religion.&lt;ref name="Bardon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Connolly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JSTOR"/&gt; Along with this was the paying of "small dues", where Catholics and Presbyterians had to pay the Church of Ireland a fee for marriages, baptisms and funerals, whether or not it occurred in their church.&lt;ref name="Donnelly"/&gt;

==Activity==
There are accounts, quite possibly exaggerated, claiming some Hearts of Oak gatherings consisted of as many as 10,000 people.&lt;ref name="Donnelly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CAHoO"/&gt; One account claimed that there is no town in County Armagh that could not raise four or five hundred.&lt;ref name="CAHoO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Donnelly"/&gt; Whilst many members were volunteers, the Hearts of Oak frequently intimidated many others to join their ranks, though this appears to have been a community sanction.&lt;ref name="Donnelly"/&gt; Others where attracted by the carnival like nature of their gatherings, with companies of Oakboys displaying standards and playing drums, horns, bagpipes, and fiddles.&lt;ref name="Donnelly"/&gt;

The main tactic of the Hearts of Oak appears to have been that once assembled, they would march to the houses of local gentlemen such as landlords, clergy, and magistrates and making them swear an oath and sign a declaration depending on the grievance.&lt;ref name="Donnelly"/&gt; This involved the threat of violence and it is recorded that they put up gallows and threatened to hang any who refused to meet their demands.&lt;ref name="Donnelly"/&gt; Due to the size of these Oakboy gatherings, those affected readily complied, and soon gentlemen were being summoned to public places to make their declaration, with those that failed to appear when summoned being marched upon. Despite the threatening language and symbolism they used, and most likely due to their vast numbers, they rarely, if ever, had to resort to physical violence.&lt;ref name="Donnelly"/&gt;

The activity of the Hearts of Oak declined in County Armagh as 1763 progressed on, with their demands being met by the county magistrates.&lt;ref name="CAHoO"/&gt; This success however is claimed as causing the movement to grow in strength in neighbouring counties.&lt;ref name="Donnelly"/&gt; In County Londonderry, many rectors and tithe collectors had to flee to the city of Derry for protection, to which the Hearts of Oak threatened to besiege the city unless they were expelled.&lt;ref name="Donnelly"/&gt;

==End of the protests==
By the middle of July 1763, the Irish government worried by the Hearts of Oak's progress, dispatched troops to the affected counties.&lt;ref name="Donnelly"/&gt; Whilst the mere appearance of the army was enough to disperse some Hearts of Oak, to end demonstrations and marches in other areas, they had to assert themselves.&lt;ref name="Donnelly"/&gt; This led however to a few bloody confrontations which saw several Oakboys killed and many others arrested.&lt;ref name="Donnelly"/&gt;

A general pardon was issued at the start of August 1763 for all Hearts of Oak who would return to their homes, and by the end of August the Hearts of Oak had been subdued.&lt;ref name="Donnelly"/&gt; This pardon however excluded those who had already been arrested or previously indicted, of which some would need to be the subject of "exemplary" punishment.&lt;ref name="Donnelly"/&gt; These trials however descended into farce when only one Oakboy brought to trial was found guilty of treason and sentenced to death, with all other defendants acquitted.&lt;ref name="Donnelly"/&gt; This may have been due to the fact the charges labelled against them were of treason, with the sole Oakboy found guilty being charged as such for treating a clergyman "very ill". Petty juries didn't like charges such as this, especially when death was the penalty, and it is suggested that the juries were made up of people who sympathised with the Hearts of Oak.&lt;ref name="Donnelly"/&gt;

Despite some small degree of sectarianism in rhetoric, the movement as a whole consisted of aggrieved [[Anglican]]s, [[Presbyterian]]s, and [[Roman Catholic]]s.&lt;ref name="Connolly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JSTOR"/&gt; Though this was the case, the Church of Ireland, of which the vast majority of gentlemen belonged too, blamed the Presbyterians. The local Presbyterian churches responded with notices calling on their members to remember their loyalty and obedience to peace, whilst seeking absolution of being to blame.&lt;ref name="CAHoO"/&gt;

The '''Henry George Foundation''' is an independent UK economic and social justice [[think tank]] and public education group concerned with "the development of sound relationships between the citizen, our communities (from the local to the global) and our shared natural and common resources". The Henry George Foundation describes itself as "active on three broad fronts:  research, education, and advocacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.henrygeorgefoundation.org |title=The Henry George Foundation |accessdate=2009-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation takes its name from [[Henry George]], the 19th Century economist and proponent of the [[land value tax|taxation of land values]].

==Activities==

The Henry George Foundation is the publisher of the magazine ''[[Land&amp;Liberty]]''. The Foundation holds educational courses and organises conferences and other public events focussing on tax reform issues. It has sponsored academic research, published extensively, and advised legislators, civil servants and NGOs on land and tax reform matters.

==History==
The Henry George Foundation is the present-day successor of a series of organisations and names that hails back to the United Committee for the Taxation of Land Values. The UCTLV was constituted on 23 March 1907&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Hospital to Alta''' ({{lang-no|Sykehus til Alta}}) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[political party]] which was active for the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 2013|2013 parliamentary election]]. The party's sole issue was the desire to relocate [[Hammerfest Hospital]], the sole [[hospital]] in western [[Finnmark]], from [[Hammerfest]] to [[Alta, Norway|Alta]]. The party was based on a [[Facebook]] group which gradually developed into a party list for the election. Former [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] local politician [[Raymond Londal]] was the top candidate, along with nine other people. The party ran exclusively in the constituency of Finnmark. The party received 467 votes, of which 370 were cast in Alta, or 1.2 percent in Finnmark and 3.9 percent in Alta, failing to claim a seat in [[Parliament of Norway|Parliament]]. The party was abolished after the election.

==History==
The party had its origins as a Facebook group which has the same name as the party. The issue of starting a party had been discussed at several meetings in relation to the group, although a majority had been opposed to starting a party. On 18 January 2013 the page's main administrator, Raymond Londal, asked for 500 people to like they post if they wanted him to start the preparation for a party, including collecting the necessary 500 signatures needed to register a party. Londal had initially given a deadline to 1 March, but it took only 75 minutes before he had sufficient likes to proceed.&lt;ref name=kosowski&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nordlys.no/nyheter/article6451039.ece |title=Sykehus til Alta f√•r egen stortingsliste |date=18 January 2013 |work=[[Nordlys]] |last=Kosowski |first=Alexandra |language=Norwegian |accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Londal started early that he hoped that the list could act as a unified list for several profiled politicians, including the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party's]] parliamentarian [[Jan-Henrik Fredriksen]] and the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party's]] [[Trine Noodt]], although these never joined.&lt;ref name=kosowski /&gt; Londal, himself a Conservative Party member of Alta Municipal Council, resigned his membership in the Conservatives to be top candidate for the new list. He continued to meet in the municipal council as a [[independent (politician)|independent]].&lt;ref name=venstre&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nrk.no/nordnytt/londal-over-til-venstre-1.11242858 |title=Londal over til Venstre |date=15 September 2013 |publisher=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the election Londal stated that he hoped that the list would be able to secure a single candidate to parliament, although he admitted that this was optimistic.&lt;ref name=altapostenprofile /&gt; The party rallied at the school election at [[Alta Upper Secondary School]], claiming 88 of 754 votes, or 12.2 percent, and making them the third-largest party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.altaposten.no/lokalt/nyheter/Valg/article8216145.ece |title=Sykehuslista tredje st√∏rst |last=Reginiussen |first=Arne |date=4 September 2013 |work=[[Altaposten]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Londal stated the day after the election that the party's function now had been completed and that it would be dissolved. A week later he joined the Liberal Party.&lt;ref name=venstre /&gt;

==Issue==
[[File:Raymond Londal.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Raymond Londal]], the party's top candidate]]

The party only had a [[Single-issue politics|single issue]], namely that the sole hospital serving western Finnmark should be relocated from Hammerfest to Alta. The party stated that Alta is more centrally located than Hammerfest and argued that a hospital in Alta would give a closer service to the residents, lower transport costs and better quality. Hospital to Alta was opposed to a three-hospital solution for Finnmark, whereby there would be hospitals in both Alta and Hammerfest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nrk.no/nordnytt/valgportrett_-raymond-londal-1.11193656 |title=Valgportrett: Raymond Londal (Sykehus til Alta) |date=21 August 2013 |publisher=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was especially relevant because there were plans to build a new hospital for the region. Londal mentioned Altag√•rd as a potential location and proposed 2016 as the year for construction to start.&lt;ref name=altapostenprofile&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.altaposten.no/lokalt/nyheter/Valg/article8184025.ece |title=Partipresentasjon Sykehus til Alta |date=28 August 2013 |work=[[Altaposten]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Election==
{{main|Norwegian parliamentary election, 2013}}

Hospital to Alta exclusively ran in the constituency of Finnmark, which is awarded five members of Parliament, including one leveling seat. It was one of fifteen parties to run in the county and the only to run exclusively in Finnmark.&lt;ref name=approval&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/pages/38359959/finnmark.pdf |title=Stortingsvalget 2013 Finnmark Finnm√°rku |publisher=[[Government.no]] |format=PDF |page=14 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=31 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103020011/http://www.regjeringen.no/pages/38359959/finnmark.pdf |archivedate=3 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The top candidate was the fifty-year-old Raymond Londal, a teacher and municipal council member from Alta. The second candidate was the thirty-seven-year-old May Ragnhild Vasara J√∏rgensen from Alta and in third place the twenty-four-year-old Erika Niittyvuopio from [[Karasjok]].&lt;ref name=altapostenprofile /&gt; The remainder of the ten candidates were all from Alta.&lt;ref name=approval /&gt;

For Finnmark as a whole the party achieved 467 votes, or 1.2 percent, making it the tenth-largest party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.valgresultat.no/bs4_20.html |title=Resultater for Finnmark Finnm√°rku |publisher=[[Government.no]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party received 370 votes in Alta, or 3.9, making it the sixth-largest party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.valgresultat.no/bs2_20_12.html |title=Resultater for Alta i Finnmark Finnm√°rku |publisher=[[Government.no]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best result was reached in [[Kautokeino]], where the party received 74 votes, or 5.1 percent, making it the seventh-largest party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.valgresultat.no/bs2_20_11.html |title=Resultater for Guovdageaidnu Kautokeino i Finnmark Finnm√°rku |publisher=[[Government.no]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hammerfest the party received one vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.valgresultat.no/bs2_20_4.html |title=Resultater for Hammerfest i Finnmark Finnm√°rku |publisher=[[Government.no]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the remainder of the municipalities it received a combined 27 votes, with between zero and two per municipality.

{{Politics of Libya}}

'''Human rights in Libya''' is the record of [[human rights]] upheld and violated in various stages of [[Libya]]'s history. The [[Kingdom of Libya]], from 1951 to 1969, was heavily influenced and educated by the British and American oil companies.  Under the King Libya had [[Constitution of Libya (1951)|a constitution]]. The kingdom, however, was marked by a [[Feudalism|feudal]] regime, where [[Libya]] had a low [[literacy]] rate of 10%, a low [[life expectancy]] of 57 years, and 40% of the population lived in [[Shanty town|shanties]], [[tent]]s, or [[cave]]s.&lt;ref name="dailynews"/&gt; Illiteracy and [[homelessness]] were chronic problems during this era, when iron shacks dotted many urban centres on the country.&lt;ref name="bbc_libya"/&gt;

From 1969 to 2011, the [[history of Libya]] was marked by the [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]] (where ''jamahiriya'' means "state of the masses"), a  "[[direct democracy]]" political system established by [[Muammar Gaddafi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Robbins|first=James|title=Eyewitness: Dialogue in the desert|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6425873.stm|accessdate=22 October 2011|date=7 March 2007|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; who nominally stepped down from power in 1977, but remained an unofficial "Brother Leader" until 2011. Under the ''Jamahiriya'', the country's literacy rate rose to 90%, and [[welfare]] systems were introduced that allowed access to free [[education]], [[Health in Libya|free healthcare]], and financial assistance for housing. In 2008, the [[General People's Congress (Libya)|General People's Congress]] had declared the Great Green Charter of Human Rights of the Jamahiriyan Era.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/3dda540f4.pdf The Great Green Charter of Human Rights of the Jamahiriyan Era] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529133134/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/3dda540f4.pdf |date=29 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Manmade River]] was also built to allow free access to fresh water across large parts of the country.&lt;ref name="dailynews"&gt;{{cite web|last=Azad|first=Sher|title=Gaddafi and the media|url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2011/10/22/fea02.asp|work=Daily News|accessdate=22 October 2011|date=22 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025194842/http://www.dailynews.lk/2011/10/22/fea02.asp|archivedate=25 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, illiteracy and [[homelessness]] had been "almost wiped out,"&lt;ref name="bbc_libya"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hussein|first=Mohamed|title=Libya crisis: what role do tribal loyalties play?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/world-middle-east-12528996|accessdate=31 October 2011|date=21 February 2011|agency=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and financial support was provided for university scholarships and employment programs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shimatsu|first=Yoichi|title=Villain or Hero?

In 2005, the [[Freedom House]] gave low ratings for [[political rights]] and [[civil liberties]], and gave it the freedom rating of "Not Free".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/uploads/pdf/Charts2006.pdf |title=Freedom in the World 2006 |publisher=[[Freedom House]] |date=16 December 2005 |accessdate=27 July 2006 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20111023055357/http://www.freedomhouse.org/uploads/pdf/Charts2006.pdf |archivedate=23 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;br/&gt;See also [[Freedom in the World 2006]], [[List of indices of freedom]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[Amnesty International]] published a critical report on Libya, raising concerns about cases of enforced disappearances and other human rights violations that remained unresolved, and that Internal Security Agency members implicated in those violations  continued to operate with impunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/region/libya/report-2010|title=Libya - Amnesty International Report 2010|quote=Hundreds of cases of enforced disappearance and other serious human rights violations committed in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s remained unresolved, and the Internal Security Agency (ISA), implicated in those violations, continued to operate with impunity.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] published a report analysing the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya's [[human rights]] record with input from member nations, most of which (including many European and most Asian, African and South American nations) generally praised the country's progressive efforts in human rights, though some (particularly Australia, France, Israel, Switzerland, and the United States) raised concerns about human rights abuses concerning cases of disappearance and torture, and restrictions on free press and free association; Libya agreed to investigate cases involving disappearance and torture, and to repeal any laws criminalizing political expression or restricting a free independent press, and affirmed that it had an independent judiciary.&lt;ref name="ohchr"/&gt;

===Revolutionary Committees===
In the early 1970s, Gaddafi created the [[General People's Committee|Revolutionary Committees]] as conduits for raising political consciousness, with the aim of [[Direct democracy|direct]] [[Participatory democracy|political participation]] by all Libyans. In 1979, however, some of these committees had eventually evolved into self-appointed, sometimes zealous, enforcers of revolutionary orthodoxy.&lt;ref name="ham_40_1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ham|first=Anthony|title=Libya|year=2007|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|location=Footscray, Victoria|isbn=1-74059-493-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lPaNiy3YisIC&amp;pg=PA40|edition=2nd|pages=40‚Äì1}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early 1980s, these committees had considerable power and became a growing source of tension within the Jamihiriya,&lt;ref name="vandewalle_124"/&gt; to the extent that Gaddafi sometimes criticized their effectiveness and excessive repression,&lt;ref name="ham_40_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vandewalle_124"/&gt; until the power of the Revolutionary Committees was eventually restricted in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="vandewalle_124"/&gt;

The Revolutionary Committees had been resembling similar systems in [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] countries; reportedly, 10 to 20 percent of Libyans worked in surveillance for these committees, with surveillance taking place in government, in factories, and in the education sector.&lt;ref name="Mohamed Eljhami"/&gt; They also posted bounties for the killing of Libyan critics charged with treason abroad.&lt;ref name="Mohamed Eljhami" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated758"&gt;''The Middle East and North Africa 2003'' (2002).

===Foreign languages and migrant workers===
Until 1998, foreign languages were not part of the school curriculum.

===Criticism of allegations===
The Libyan Arab Jamhairiya rejected the allegations against the country. They pointed to how their country is founded on direct people's democracy that guaranteed direct exercise of authority by all citizens through the people's congresses. Citizens were able to express opinions of the congresses on issues related to political, economic, social, and cultural issues. In addition, there were information platforms such as newspapers and TV channels for people to express their opinions through. Libyan authorities also argued that no one in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya suffered from extreme poverty and hunger, and that the government guaranteed a minimum of food and essential needs to people with low incomes. In 2006, an initiative was adopted for providing people with low incomes investment potfolios amounting to $30,000 to be deposited with banks and companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session9/LY/A_HRC_WG.6_9_LBY_1_Libya_E.pdf "National report submitted in accordance with paragraph 15 (a) of the annex to Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, Great Socialist People‚Äôs Libyan Arab Jamahiriya"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529133237/http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session9/LY/A_HRC_WG.6_9_LBY_1_Libya_E.pdf |date=29 May 2016 }} (HRC/WG.6/9/LBY/1), United Nations Human Rights Council, 24 August 2010.

The HIV trial in Libya (or Bulgarian nurses affair) concerns the trials, appeals and eventual release of six foreign medical workers charged with conspiring to deliberately infect over 400 children with HIV-tainted blood in 1998, causing an [[epidemic]] at El-Fatih Children's Hospital in [[Benghazi]].&lt;ref name="Doctors face murder charges in Libya"&gt;

===Abu Salim alleged prison massacre===
{{main|Abu Salim prison}}

In 2006, [[Amnesty International]] called for an [[Public inquiry|independent inquiry]] into unconfirmed deaths that occurred in Abu Salim maximum security prison during the 1996 riot.&lt;ref name="amnesty 346"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/346|title=Investigation Needed into Prison Deaths|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|access-date=31 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706124043/http://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/346|archive-date=6 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, [[Human Rights Watch]] believes that 1,270 prisoners were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.binrabah.com/h/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=337:2010-12-26-00-24-18&amp;catid=39:e&amp;Itemid=27 |title=Site news Bilal bin Rabah (the city of Al Bayda, Libya), a meeting with the Libyan Minister of Justice |publisher=Binrabah.com |date= |accessdate=25 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch 1270"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.hrw.org/es/news/2009/10/16/libya-free-all-unjustly-detained-prisoners |title=Libya: Free All Unjustly Detained Prisoners |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Human Rights Watch states that they were unable to independently verify the allegations. The claims cited by Human Rights Watch are based on the testimony of a single former inmate, Hussein Al Shafa‚Äôi, who stated that he did not witness a prisoner being killed: "I could not see the dead prisoners who were shot..."&lt;ref name="hrw.org"&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2006/06/27/libya-june-1996-killings-abu-salim-prison "Libya: June 1996 Killings at Abu Salim Prison"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610224625/https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2006/06/27/libya-june-1996-killings-abu-salim-prison |date=10 June 2015 }}, Human Rights Watch, 27 June 2006. Retrieved 10 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The figure of 1200 killed was arrived at by Al Shafa‚Äôi allegedly calculating the number of meals he prepared when he was working in the prison's kitchen. At the same time, Al Shafa'i stated "I was asked by the prison guards to wash the watches that were taken from the bodies of the dead prisoners..." &lt;ref name="hrw.org"/&gt;

The Libyan Government rejected the allegations about Abu Salim. In May 2005, the Internal Security Agency head of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya told Human Rights Watch that the prisoners captured some guards and stole weapons from the prison cache. The prisoners and guards died as security personnel tried to restore order, and the government opened an investigation on the order of the Minister of Justice. The Libyan official stated that more than 400 prisoners escaped Abu Salim in four separate break-outs prior to and after the incident: in July 1995, December 1995, June 1996 and July 2001. Among the escapees were men who then fought with Islamist militant groups in Afghanistan, Iran, and Iraq.&lt;ref name="hrw.org"/&gt;

In 2009, the Libyan government stated that the killings took place amid confrontation between the government and rebels from the [[Libyan Islamic Fighting Group]], and that some 200 guards were killed as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shuaib|title=Libya appoints judge to probe 1996 prison massacre|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/09/06/uk-libya-massacre-idUKTRE5850PJ20090906|accessdate=2 July 2011|date=6 September 2009|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya confirmed that it was carrying out an investigation into the incident along with international investigators.&lt;ref name="ohchr"/&gt;

===Torture===
In January 2011, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya stated that the practice of torture and ill treatment was forbidden in article 434 of the Penal Code, which stated that public officials who had ordered the torture of a person or had committed an act of torture were sentenced to 3 to 10 years‚Äô imprisonment.&lt;ref name="ohchr"/&gt; Gaddafi openly condemned the use of torture, as a criticism against several [[General People's Committee|Revolutionary Committees]] that had condoned the use of torture.&lt;ref name="ham_libya"/&gt;

Torture was allegedly used by Libya's security forces to punish rebels after the rebellion hit north west Libya during the civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/06/world/africa/06libya.html | work= [[The New York Times]] | author = Kirkpatrick, David D.; [[C.J.

Various states and [[supranational]] bodies have condemned the use of military and mercenaries against Libyan civilians during the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]], an allegation that [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]] denies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walker|first=Portia|title=Gaddafi's son denies ordering use of lethal force against civilians|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/gaddafis-son-denies-ordering-use-of-lethal-force-against-civilians-2305477.html|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=22 October 2011|date=1 July 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Luis Moreno Ocampo]], chief prosecutor of the [[International Criminal Court]], estimated that between 500 and 700 people were killed by Gaddafi's security forces in February 2011, before the rebels even took up arms. "Shooting at protestors was systematic," Moreno-Ocampo stated, discussing the Libyan government's response to the initial pro-democracy demonstrations.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/05/world/africa/05nations.html?ref=world | work= [[The New York Times]] |author1=Simons, Marlise |author2=MacFarquhar, Neil | title=Libyan Officials' Arrests Sought by Court in Hague | date= 4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreno-Ocampo further stated that during the ongoing civil war, "War crimes are apparently committed as a matter of policy" by forces loyal to Gaddafi.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;
This is further supported by claims of Human Rights Watch, that 10 protesters, who had already agreed to lay down arms, were executed by a government paramilitary group in [[Bani Walid]] in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/08/18/libya-10-protesters-apparently-executed/ | publisher = [[Human Rights Watch]] | title=Libya: 10 Protesters apparently executed | date= 18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 February 2011, the [[United Nations Security Council]] voted unanimously in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1970|a resolution]] to impose strict sanctions, including targeted travel bans, against Gaddafi's government, as well as to refer Gaddafi and other members of his regime to the [[International Criminal Court]] for investigation into allegations of brutality against civilians, which could constitute [[crimes against humanity]] in violation of international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41785849/ns/world_news-mideastn_africa/ |title=U.N.

[[Anti-Gaddafi forces|Rebel forces]] have been criticized for a number of human rights violations, including indiscriminate bombardment of heavily populated cities, torture and killing of [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]], and racist lynchings of [[black people]].&lt;ref name="guardian_milne"&gt;{{cite news|last=Milne|first=Seumas|title=If the Libyan war was about saving lives, it was a catastrophic failure|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/26/libya-war-saving-lives-catastrophic-failure|accessdate=27 October 2011|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=26 October 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Deceit in Nato bombing of Gadhafi cities and loyalists revealed|url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/15883/deceit-in-nato-bombing-of-gadhafi-cities-and-loyalists-revealed|accessdate=27 October 2011|newspaper=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, a detailed investigation carried out by [[Amnesty International]] claimed that many of the allegations against Gaddafi and the Libyan state turned out to either be false or lack any credible evidence, noting that rebels at times appeared to have knowingly made false claims or manufactured evidence. According to the Amnesty investigation, the number of casualties was heavily exaggerated, some of the protesters may have been armed, "there is no proof of mass killing of civilians on the scale of Syria or Yemen," and there is no evidence that aircraft or heavy anti-aircraft machine guns were used against crowds. It also doubted claims from the Western media that the protest movement was "entirely peaceful" and "presented no security challenge."&lt;ref name="amnesty_investigation"&gt;{{cite news| author = Cockburn, Patrick|title=Amnesty Questions Claim That Gaddafi Ordered Rape as Weapon of War|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/amnesty-questions-claim-that-gaddafi-ordered-rape-as-weapon-of-war-2302037.html| work = [[The Independent]] | accessdate=3 July 2011|date=24 June 2011| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in a later report from Amnesty International it was found that "al-Gaddafi forces committed serious violations of international humanitarian law (IHL), including war crimes, and gross human rights violations,which point to the commission of crimes against humanity. They deliberately killed and injured scores of unarmed protesters; subjected perceived opponents and critics to enforced disappearance and torture and other ill- treatment; and arbitrarily detained scores of civilians. They launched indiscriminate attacks and attacks targeting civilians in their efforts to regain control of Misratah and territory in the east. They launched artillery, mortar and rocket attacks against residential areas. They used inherently indiscriminate weapons such as anti-personnel land mines and cluster bombs,including in residential areas."&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, The Battle for Libya: Killings, Disappearances and Torture, 13 September 2011, MDE 19/025/2011

In July 2011, [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]] had an interview with ''[[RT (TV Network)|Russia Today]]'', where he denied the ICC's allegations that he or his father Muammar Gaddafi ordered the killing of civilian protesters. He pointed out that he is not a member of the government or the military, and therefore has no authority to give such orders. According to Saif, he made recorded calls to General [[Abdul Fatah Younis]], who later defected to the rebel forces, in order to request not to use force against protesters, to which Fatah responded that they are attacking a military site, where surprised guards fired in self-defense.&lt;ref name="rt_interview"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gaddafi's son: Libya like McDonald's for NATO - fast war as fast food|url=http://rt.com/news/interview-gaddafi-libya-usa/|accessdate=25 October 2011|date=1 July 2011|agency=[[Russia Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=David|title=Gaddafi's son claims Nato wants deal with Libya|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/01/gaddafi-son-nato-libya-deal|accessdate=29 October 2011|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=1 July 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, independent human rights groups published a report describing the human rights violations committed by all sides, including NATO, anti-Gaddafi forces, and pro-Gaddafi forces. The same report also accused NATO of war crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shabi|first=Rachel|title=Nato accused of war crimes in Libya|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/nato-accused-of-war-crimes-in-libya-6291566.html|accessdate=23 January 2012|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=19 January 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; During and after the war, the [[National Transitional Council]] implemented a new Law 37, restricting [[freedom of speech]], where any praise of glorification of Gaddafi or the previous government is punishable with imprisonment, with sentences ranging from three to fifteen years. The law was eventually revoked in June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Libya revokes Muammar Gaddafi praise law|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18446110|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=11 July 2012|date=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Human Rights Watch]] annual report 2016, [[journalist]]s are still being targeted by the armed groups in [[Libya]]. One of the victims was Muftah Al-Qatrani, who worked for media production company, he was killed in [[Benghazi]] in April 2015. In other case, the fate of two [[Tunisia]]n journalist, Sofiane Chourabi and Nadhir Ktari, is still unknown since September 2014. Later, in April 2015, Groups affiliated with [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] claimed the responsibility of killing them. In November 2015, the NGO [[Reporters Without Borders|Reporters Without Borders (RSF)]] claimed that journalists in Libya were targeted in 31 incidents during 2015. The organization added that Libya has very low rank in the 2015 press freedom index as it occupied 154 out of 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2016/country-chapters/libya|title=Libya|date=2016-01-11|access-date=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

August 2016, Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor warned from the illicit spreading of weapons among Libyan population. According to the monitor, dozens of loosely formed, armed groups have formed, which makes a "chaos of weapons". The spreading of weapons represents a major obstacle to the reconstruction of Libya. It is also paves the way to [[murder]], [[drug]], [[Arms trafficking|arm trafficking]] and [[kidnapping]]. The monitor calls central authorities in [[Libya]] to act urgently, with the [[United Nations|UN]] support to put an end to this chaos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.euromedmonitor.org/en/article/1410/Libya-becoming-huge-%25E2%2580%2598weapons-warehouse-%25E2%2580%2599-leading-to-chaos-and-tragedy-|title=Libya becoming huge ‚Äòweapons warehouse,‚Äô leading to chaos and tragedy|last=Monitor|first=Euro-Med|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

December 2016, Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor issued a report regarding the violation of human rights in Libya. According to the report, since July 2014, Ganfoda has been besieged by Khalifa Haftar‚Äôs Libyan National Army forces; the civilian has suffered long-month power cut, resulting in shortage of food, water, and medicine. As the civilians have been prevented from access to food and medical aid, more than 170 families were evacuated, yet the children are being used as bait by the Libyan army forces in order to prevent their families fleeing away to use them as a part of their militant operations. They are, therefore, at risk of detention and prolonged investigation, in case of attempting to cross the checkpoints. It also showed ambulance crews cannot enter the town due to ground and air attacks; and the Libyan Red Crescent Society cannot provide any humanitarian relief for the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/1676|title=Benghazi town at risk of imminent humanitarian crisis|last=Monitor|first=Euro-Med|newspaper=Euro-Mediterranean|access-date=2017-02-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's rights==
As in many modern revolutions women played a major role in the [[2011 Libyan Revolution]]. After the revolution, however, concerns have been raised by human rights groups about attempts to sideline women in Libya's political and economic environments as well as a failure to strongly articulate women's rights in the country's constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/libya0513_brochure_LOWRES_0.pdf "Revolution for All: Women‚Äôs Rights in the New Libya"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307043040/https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/libya0513_brochure_LOWRES_0.pdf |date=7 March 2016 }}, Human Rights Watch, 19 May 2013. Retrieved 10 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

GNC opponents argue that it was supporting Islamist actions against women. [[Sadiq Ghariani]], the [[Grand Mufti]] of Libya, is perceived to be linked closely to Islamist parties. He has issued fatwas ordering Muslims to obey the GNC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libyaherald.com/2014/02/07/grand-mufti-supports-congress-remaining-in-office-forbids-action-against-it/#axzz3BEEmEefL|title=Grand Mufti supports Congress remaining in office, forbids action against it.|work=Libya Herald|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fatwas ordering Muslims to fight against [[Haftar]]'s forces&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magharebia.com/en_GB/articles/awi/features/2014/06/12/feature-01|title=Mufti call for violence angers Libyans|work=Magharebia|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, [[Sadiq Ghariani]], the [[Grand Mufti]], issued a fatwa against the ''UN Report on Violence Against Women and Girls''. He condemned the UN report for "advocating immorality and indecency in addition to rebelliousness against religion and clear objections to the laws contained in the Quran and Sunnah".&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/libyas-grand-mufti-issues-fatwa-against-un-report-womens-rights|title=Libya's Grand Mufti Issues Fatwa Against U.N.

Later in 2013, lawyer Hamida Al-Hadi Al-Asfar, advocate of women's rights, was abducted, tortured and killed. It is alleged she was targeted for criticising the Grand Mufti's declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vivalibya.wordpress.com/2014/01/07/lawyer-who-supported-the-rights-of-women-found-dead/|title=Lawyer Who Supported the Rights of Women in Libya, Found Dead &amp;#124; Viva Libya !|publisher=Vivalibya.wordpress.com|date=7 January 2014|accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; No arrests were made.

In June 2013, two politicians, Ali Tekbali and Fathi Sager, appeared in court for "insulting Islam" for publishing a cartoon promoting women's rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/libya-must-drop-charges-against-politicians-over-women-s-rights-cartoon-2013-06-14 |title=Libya must drop charges against politicians over women's rights cartoon &amp;#124; Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty.org |date= |accessdate=16 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326023115/http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/libya-must-drop-charges-against-politicians-over-women-s-rights-cartoon-2013-06-14 |archivedate=26 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under sharia law they were facing a possible death penalty. The case caused widespread concern although they were eventually acquitted in March 2014. After the GNC was forced to accept new elections, Ali Tekbali was elected to the new House of Representatives.

During [[Nouri Abusahmain]]'s presidency of the GNC and subsequent to GNC's decision to enforce sharia law in December 2013, gender segregation and compulsory hijab were being imposed in Libyan universities from early 2014, provoking strong criticism from Women's Rights groups.

== Libyan coastguard's violation of migrants' rights ==
The Euro Med Human Rights Monitor published a report condemning the Libyan coastguard officers' whipping of a group of migrants rescued near Libya‚Äôs Sabrta. In September 2014, nearly 450 migrants were drowned in the Mediterranean. In 2016, more than 4,578 migrants drowned there, following an agreement between the EU and Turkey and the closure of the Balkan route. According to the report, the migrants smuggled into [[Libya]] are subject to human trafficking, torture, forced labor, sexual exploitation and arbitrary detention through their way. The Libyan forces were caught on video while humiliating migrants, including women and children. Besides, [[Human Rights Watch]] documented similar cases in which Libyan coastguard forces assaulted them verbally and physically in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/1765|title=Libyan coastguard's whipping of migrants is a despicable violation of human rights|last=Monitor|first=Euro-Med|work=Euro-Mediterranean|access-date=2017-02-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8289">'''Independent Native Voice''', also known as '''Native Voice''', was a short-lived political party in [[Manitoba]], Canada.  It was created in 1995 to address aboriginal issues, and ran three candidates in the [[Manitoba general election, 1995|1995 provincial election]].  Native Voice was not registered with [[Elections Manitoba]], and its candidates were listed on the ballot as independents.  After the election, accusations surfaced that Native Voice was funded by [[Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba|Progressive Conservative]] (PC) [[Party organizer]]s to take votes from the [[New Democratic Party of Manitoba|New Democratic Party]] (NDP) in marginal constituencies.

== The election ==

Independent Native Voice's leader was Nelson Contois, who contested Manitoba's [[Swan River (Manitoba riding)|Swan River]] constituency.&lt;ref&gt;Doug Smith, ''As Many Liars'' (Winnipeg: Arbeiter Ring Pub., 2003), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;  The other candidates were Nelson's daughter Carey Contois in [[Dauphin (Manitoba riding)|Dauphin]], and Darryl Sutherland in [[Interlake (Manitoba riding)|Interlake]].

Independent Native Voice was one of two unregistered parties to focus on aboriginal issues in the 1995 campaign.  The other was the [[First Peoples Party]] (FPP) led by [[Jerry Fontaine]], the nephew of future Canadian [[Assembly of First Nations]] leader [[Phil Fontaine]].  The FPP had no formal association with Independent Native Voice, and was not implicated in the post-election controversy.  Nelson and Carey Contois nevertheless affiliated with the FPP in mid-campaign, and ran with endorsements from both parties.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sutherland did not join the FPP, and was not in regular contact with the Contoises after declaring his candidacy.  According to later reports, Sutherland told Jerry Fontaine during the campaign that Progressive Conservative organizers had promised him at least $3,000 to declare his candidacy.  Fontaine encouraged Sutherland to take his story to the media, though Sutherland did not do so at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp. 70-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 22, 1995, the ''[[Winnipeg Free Press]]'' newspaper quoted Progressive Conservative organizer Allan Aitken as saying that he had assisted Sutherland and the Contoises in setting up their campaigns.  He said he only wanted to ensure "everyone ha[d] an equal shot at running", and denied suggestions that his actions contravened provincial law.  [[Bill Uruski]], a former NDP [[Member of the Legislative Assembly]] (MLA), was quoted in the same article as speculating that Aitken's assistance was a ploy "to undermine NDP support in the native communities".&lt;ref&gt;Alice Krueger, "Hey? Whose side is he on!", ''Winnipeg Free Press'', 22 April 1995, City Page.&lt;/ref&gt;  Two days later, Sutherland told the ''Interlake Spectator'' that he had accepted help from Progressive Conservative organizers early in the campaign, but later distanced himself from these figures.  He said that his candidacy was legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;  The controversy attracted relatively little attention during the campaign.

Independent Native Voice fared poorly as a party, receiving a total of 518 votes.  Nelson Contois received 118 votes (1.36%), Carey Contois received 111 (1.15%) and Sutherland received 289 (3.90%).  The NDP won all three constituencies, although the Progressive Conservatives came within thirty-six votes of winning Swan River.  Provincially, the Progressive Conservatives under [[Gary Filmon]] were re-elected with their second consecutive [[majority government]].  The NDP registered a complaint with Elections Manitoba concerning the Native Voice candidacies, but no charges were laid.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp. 94-105.  Election Manitoba's investigation is covered extensively in this chapter.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scandal ==

Following extensive journalistic work by reporter [[Curt Petrovich]], the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) interviewed Sutherland and ran an expos√© of his candidacy on June 22, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michenerawards.ca/english/winaward1999.htm "1999 Michener Award Winner"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050314133410/http://www.michenerawards.ca/english/winaward1999.htm |date=2005-03-14 }}, The Michener Awards Foundation, 2000, accessed 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  This story, and subsequent follow-up reports, included accusations by Sutherland that Progressive Conservative organizers were guilty of vote-rigging and inducement in the 1995 campaign.  The resulting scandal became a political flashpoint in the province.  A ''Winnipeg Free Press'' article from June 24 noted that Sutherland was receiving $111 bi-weekly in welfare payments at the time of the election, yet contributed almost $5,000 to his own campaign chest.&lt;ref&gt;David Kuxhaus, "Who bankrolled native candidate in '95 campaign?", ''Winnipeg Free Press'', 24 June 1998, A1.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the same day, Sutherland named local Progressive Conservative organizer Cubby Barrett as the source of his funds.&lt;ref&gt;David Kuxhaus, "Tory named in vote scandal", ''Winnipeg Free Press'', 25 June 1998, A1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Premier of Manitoba|Premier]] Filmon initially rejected these reports, and said that he trusted Elections Manitoba more than the CBC.&lt;ref&gt;"1999 Michener Award Winner".&lt;/ref&gt;  He nonetheless called a public inquiry under judge [[Alfred Monnin]] before the end of June, in response to mounting evidence of improper behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Paul McKie, "Judge to probe vote", ''Winnipeg Free Press'', 30 June 1998, A1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Monnin ruled that local Progressive Conservative organizers were guilty of inducing at least one candidate (Sutherland) to contest the election.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;  Senior party organizer [[Taras Sokolyk]] was personally implicated, when it was discovered that he had channelled party funds to Aitken during the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;David Kuxhaus, "Tory accountant in net", ''Winnipeg Free Press'', 24 December 1998, A1.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his summary, Monnin described the behaviour of Conservative organizers as "unethical" and "morally reprehensible".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/legislature/business/hansard/36th_5th/vol_013a/h013a_2.html |title=Hansard Report, Manitoba Legislature |access-date=2017-09-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407072826/http://www.gov.mb.ca/legislature/business/hansard/36th_5th/vol_013a/h013a_2.html |archive-date=2014-04-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monnin's inquiry did not conclude that the Contois candidacies were induced by Progressive Conservative organizers, although suspicions remained.&lt;ref&gt;[http://umanitoba.ca/manitoban/1998-1999/1118/n2.html Krishna Lalbiharie, "Filmon to testify at alleged election-rigging inquiry"]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''The Manitoban'', 18 November 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  Premier Filmon was not implicated in the scandal.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;  No charges were filed against Barrett and Aitken, as the statute of limitations for illegal inducement had expired after two years.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Referring to the scandal in 1998, Jerry Fontaine argued that "the Tories took advantage of Aboriginal individuals who weren't all that involved in political issues or political life".&lt;ref&gt;Lalbiharie, "Filmon to testify".&lt;/ref&gt;  The scandal contributed to the defeat of Filmon's government in the [[Manitoba general election, 1999|1999 election]].

Independent Native Voice ceased to exist after 1995.

In 1939, Soviet intelligence defector [[Walter Krivitsky]] described the OMS as "a worldwide network of permanently stationed agents."&lt;ref name=Krivitsky /&gt;&lt;ref name=Drachkovitch&gt;

The most delicate job entrusted to OMS resident agents is the distribution of money to finance the Communist Parties."&lt;ref name=Krivitsky /&gt;

In 1999, the historian Raymond W. Leonard stated, "Through the auspices of the Comintern and the OMS, foreign communist parties provided a ready-made source of ideologically dedicated agents."&lt;ref name=leonard /&gt;  He also speculated that the Intelligence Section "was probably the organization required by the OMS to be present in every Communist party of liaison work with the Red Army."&lt;ref name=leonard /&gt;

In 2002, historian David McKnight stated:  &lt;blockquote&gt;The most intense practical application of the conspiratorial work of the Comintern was carried out by its international liaison service, the OMS.  This body undertook clandenstine courier activities and work which supported underground political activities.  These included the transport of money and letters, the manufacture of passports and other false documents and technical support to underground parties, such as managing "safe houses" and establishing businesses overseas as cover activities.&lt;ref name=McKnight /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;   In 2007, historian Nigel West providesd perhaps the longest single description of the OMS in English in his book ''Mask''.&lt;ref name=mask&gt;

In 2011, historian [[Thomas L. Sakmyster]] stated:  &lt;blockquote&gt;The OMS was the Comintern's department for the coordination of subversive and conspiratorial activities.  Some of its functions overlapped with those of the main Soviet intelligence agencies, the OGPU and the GRU, whose agents sometimes were assigned to the Comintern.  But the OMS maintained its own set of operations and had its own representative on the central committees of each Communist party abroad.&lt;ref name=Sakmyster /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;    In 2014, Soviet expert Boris Volodarsky called the OMS a "little known intelligence services" and referred to the it as the "intelligence branch of the Comintern," preceded by the Sluzhba Svyazi or "Communication Service."&lt;ref name=Volodarsky&gt;

The historian Raymond W. Leonard noted, "Between 1919 and 1922, people frequently moved back and forth between the ''Razvedupr'' and Comintern...  For the rest of the interwar period, the Red Army used the Comintern, especially the OMS, primarily for agent support and as a source of recruits for its own purposes...  After 1927, agents of the OMS usually acted as liaisons between the Comintern and Red Army Intelligence."&lt;ref name=leonard /&gt;

Two international raids led the OMS to distance itself from Soviet diplomatic missions.  In April 1927, the Chinese police raided the Soviet military attache's office in Beijing.  In May 1927, [[Scotland Yard]] raided [[All Russian Co-operative Society|ARCOS]] in London.&lt;ref name=Meier /&gt;

The '''International Studies Association''' ('''ISA''') is a professional association for scholars, practitioners and graduate students in the field of international studies. Founded in 1959, ISA now has over 7,000 members in 110 countries and is the most respected and widely known scholarly association in this field. Endeavoring to create communities of scholars dedicated to international studies, ISA is divided into 6 geographic subdivisions (Regions), 29 thematic groups (Sections) and 4 Caucuses which provide opportunities to exchange ideas and research with local colleagues and within specific subject areas. ISA publishes leading journals in the field of international studies and the annual convention routinely draws over 6,500 attendees.

ISA publishes six academic journals (''[[International Studies Quarterly]]'', ''[[International Studies Review]]'', ''[[International Studies Perspectives]]'', ''[[Foreign Policy Analysis]]'', ''[[International Political Sociology]]'', ''[[Journal of Global Security Studies]]'', co-sponsors a seventh (''[[International Interactions]]''), publishes a comprehensive compendium of international studies and maintains a variety of online resources for the international academic community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isanet.org/Publications.aspx |title=ISA Publications |publisher=Isanet.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intersex rights in China''' including the [[People's Republic of China]], the [[Hong Kong]] Special Administrative Region and [[Taiwan]], are protections and rights afforded to [[intersex]] people through legislation and regulation. Obligations also arise in United Nations member states that sign international human rights treaties, such as the People's Republic of China. Intersex people in China suffer discrimination. Issues include both lack of access to health care and coercive genital surgeries.&lt;ref name="bbkci2015" /&gt;

== History ==

In February 2018, Asian intersex activists published the Statement of Intersex Asia and the Asian Intersex Forum, setting out local demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Intersex Asia| title = Statement of Intersex Asia and Asian intersex forum | accessdate = 2018-09-05| date = February 2018| url = https://www.astraeafoundation.org/stories/first-asian-intersex-forum/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Small Luk]] (Hong Kong) describes traditional Chinese society as patriarchal, promoting the sex assignment of intersex children as boys wherever possible.&lt;ref name="bbkci2015" /&gt; She states that the "one child policy" in mainland China led to the abandonment, neglect and deaths of many intersex infants. 

Both Luk&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Yau| first = Elaine| title = No child should endure my ordeal, says sex-disorder Hongkonger forced to be a boy| work = [[South China Morning Post]]| accessdate = 2017-03-25| date = January 28, 2016| url = http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/article/1905393/no-child-should-endure-my-ordeal-says-sex-disorder-hongkonger-forced-be| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170405075205/http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/article/1905393/no-child-should-endure-my-ordeal-says-sex-disorder-hongkonger-forced-be| archivedate = 5 April 2017| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Taiwan activist [[Hiker  Chiu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://next.liberation.fr/sexe/2015/07/01/sans-contrefacon-je-suis-fille-et-garcon_1341211 |title=Sans contrefa√ßon, je suis fille et gar√ßon |last1=Allain |first1=Pierre-Henri |last2= |first2= |date=July 1, 2015 |work=[[Lib√©ration]] |access-date=2015-07-02 |quote= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703145734/http://next.liberation.fr/sexe/2015/07/01/sans-contrefacon-je-suis-fille-et-garcon_1341211 |archivedate=3 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; have disclosed personal histories involving unwanted medical interventions. Chiu says that surgical "normalisation" practices began in Taiwan in 1953. [[Intersex medical interventions]] are encouraged as early as possible in both Hong Kong and the People's Republic. A 2014 clinical review of 22 infants with [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] in Hong Kong, for example, shows that all infants in the study received [[clitorectomy|clitorectomies]]. It also showed a preference for early surgeries when infants are aged 1-2 years, and an assessment of surgical success focusing on genital appearance and necessity for further cosmetic surgeries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.12809/hkmj144227| issn = 10242708| volume = 20| issue = 6| pages = 481‚Äì485| last1 = Houben| first1 = Ch| last2 = Tsui| first2 = Sy| last3 = Mou| first3 = Jw| last4 = Chan| first4 = Kw| last5 = Tam| first5 = Yh| last6 = Lee| first6 = Kh| title = Reconstructive surgery for females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency: a review from the Prince of Wales Hospital| journal = Hong Kong Medical Journal| date = December 2014| url = http://www.hkmj.org/earlyrelease/hkmj144227.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of medical interventions in the People's Republic of China makes medical treatment inaccessible, resulting in fewer coercive interventions but exacerbating health issues for some individuals,&lt;ref name="luk2015" /&gt; and issues of abandonment and violence.&lt;ref name="bbkci2015" /&gt;

In a submission to the United Nations Committee Against Torture in 2015, Beyond the Boundary - Knowing and Concerns Intersex raised concerns about lack of self-determination in Hong Kong and China, forced medical interventions in Hong Kong, lack of government assistance and marriage rights, and problems with violence and discrimination.&lt;ref name="bbkci2015"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Beyond the Boundary - Knowing and Concerns Intersex| title = Intersex report from Hong Kong China, and for the UN Committee Against Torture: the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment| date = October 2015| url = http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=INT%2fCAT%2fCSS%2fHKG%2f22156&amp;Lang=en| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170326052617/http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=INT%2FCAT%2FCSS%2FHKG%2F22156&amp;Lang=en| archivedate = 26 March 2017| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a response to submissions for Hong Kong, the United Nations Committee published recommendations calling for the postponement of "non-urgent, irreversible medical interventions" until children are old enough to provide full, free and informed consent.&lt;ref name="cat2015hk"&gt;{{Cite web| publisher = United Nations| last1 = United Nations| last2 = Committee against Torture| title = Concluding observations on the fifth periodic report of China with respect to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region| location = Geneva| date = 2015| url = http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CAT%2fC%2fCHN-HKG%2fCO%2f5&amp;Lang=en| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170326051947/http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CAT%2FC%2FCHN-HKG%2FCO%2F5&amp;Lang=en| archivedate = 26 March 2017| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee called for an investigation into forced, involuntary and coercive practices in the People's Republic, along with measures to protect the autonomy and "physical and personal integrity of LGBTI persons".&lt;ref name="cat2015cn"&gt;{{Cite web| publisher = United Nations| last1 = United Nations| last2 = Committee against Torture| title = Concluding observations on the fifth periodic report of China| location = Geneva| date = 2015| url = http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CAT%2fC%2fCHN%2fCO%2f5&amp;Lang=en| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170326052456/http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CAT%2FC%2FCHN%2FCO%2F5&amp;Lang=en| archivedate = 26 March 2017| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Press reports in 2015 and 2016 have provided examples of abandonment, neglect and even attempted murder. The [[South China Morning Post]] reported the abandonment of an intersex baby in a part in Shandong province in mid-2015,&lt;ref name="lau2015"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Lau| first = Mimi| title = Baby born with male and female genitals found abandoned in Chinese park| work = [[South China Morning Post]]| accessdate = 2017-03-25| date = August 24, 2015| url = http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/1851891/baby-born-male-and-female-genitals-found-abandoned-chinese-park| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161112142436/http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/1851891/baby-born-male-and-female-genitals-found-abandoned-chinese-park| archivedate = 12 November 2016| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by allegations of attempts to murder an intersex infant as a "monster", in Henan province, in mid-2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Morgan| first = Joe| title = Father tries to kill intersex baby three times for being a 'monster'| work = Gay Star News| accessdate = 2017-03-25| date = June 22, 2016| url = http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/father-tries-kill-intersex-baby-three-times-monster/| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170326051531/http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/father-tries-kill-intersex-baby-three-times-monster/| archivedate = 26 March 2017| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the Hong Kong [[Equal Opportunities Commission (Hong Kong)|Equal Opportunities Commission]] together with the Gender Research Centre of the Hong Kong Institute of Asia-Pacific Studies at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] asked the Hong Kong government to introduce legislation offering protection against discrimination on the grounds of [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]] and [[Discrimination against intersex people|intersex status]].&lt;ref name="eoc2017"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eoc.org.hk/eoc/graphicsfolder/ShowContent.aspx?ItemID=14332 | title = EOC &amp; GRC of CUHK Issue Statement Calling for the Introduction of Legislation against Discrimination on the Grounds of Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Intersex Status | date = March 9, 2017 | last = Equal Opportunities Commission | author-link = Equal Opportunities Commission (Hong Kong) | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170326230621/http://www.eoc.org.hk/eoc/graphicsfolder/ShowContent.aspx?ItemID=14332 | archivedate = 26 March 2017 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reparations==

The United Nations Committee Against Torture has called for reparations for involuntary and coercive interventions in both the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="cat2015cn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cat2015hk" /&gt;

[[Small Luk]] has campaigned for self-determination of gender identity,&lt;ref name="bbkci2015" /&gt; and also for third gender recognition in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="lam2016"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Lam| first = Jeffie| title = Intersex Hongkonger wages one-person campaign for third gender recognition| work = [[South China Morning Post]]| accessdate = 2017-03-25| date = December 3, 2016 | url = http://m.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education-community/article/2051492/intersex-hongkonger-wages-one-person-campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rights advocacy==

The first people to publicly disclose being intersex were [[Hiker Chiu]] of [[Oii-Chinese]], based in Taiwan and founded in 2008,&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2013/11/27/2003577754/ | title = Neither here, nor there | work = [[Taipei Times]] | date = November 27, 2013 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150704041817/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2013/11/27/2003577754/ | archivedate = 4 July 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Small Luk]] of Beyond the Boundary - Knowing and Concerns Intersex, Hong Kong, founded in 2011.&lt;ref name="luk2015"&gt;{{Cite| publisher = Intersex Day| last = Luk| first = Small| title = Beyond boundaries: intersex in Hong Kong and China| work = [[Intersex Day]]| date = October 20, 2015| url = http://intersexday.org/en/beyond-boundaries-intersex-hk-china/| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160405140909/http://intersexday.org/en/beyond-boundaries-intersex-hk-china/| archivedate = 5 April 2016| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiu started a "free hugs with intersex" campaign at Taipei's LGBT Pride Parade in 2010. Oii-Chinese also gives lectures and lobbies government.&lt;ref name="times" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.lihpao.com/?action-viewnews-itemid-136232 | title = ÊìÅÊä±Èô∞ÈôΩ‰∫∫ Á≥ªÂàó2ÔºöÂÅúÊ≠¢ÁüØÊ≠£ÊâãË°ì Èô∞ÈôΩÂÖí‰∏çÊòØÁï∞ÂΩ¢ | work = Lihpao Daily | date = 23 December 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150703234800/http://www.lihpao.com/?action-viewnews-itemid-136232 | archivedate = 3 July 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The aims of Beyond the Boundary - Knowing and Concerns Intersex are to raise public awareness about intersex people and promote the rights of intersex people, including ending forced genital normalising surgery and [[conversion therapies]]. Luk urges the Hong Kong government to educate the public about intersex conditions, extend [[anti-discrimination laws]] to cover intersex people and stop foisting surgery on intersex children without consulting them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.passiontimes.hk/article/11-24-2015/27065 | title = ÈõôÊÄß‰∫∫Á¥∞Á¥∞ËÄÅÂ∏´ÔºöÂº∑Ëø´Â∞èÁ´•ÂÅöÊÄßÂô®ÂÆò‰øÆË®ÇÊâãË°ìÁ≠âÂêåÈÖ∑Âàë | date = 24 November 2015 | publisher = Passion Times | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160404073242/http://www.passiontimes.hk/article/11-24-2015/27065 | archivedate = 4 April 2016 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Raya''' (August 15, 1916 ‚Äì June 10, 2005), born in [[Zahl√©, Lebanon]], was a prominent [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Melkite Greek Catholic]] [[archbishop]], theologian, civil rights advocate and author. He served as metropolitan of [[Akko]], [[Haifa]], [[Nazareth]] and All [[Galilee]] from 1968 until 1974 and was particularly known for his commitment to seeking reconciliation between Christians, Jews and Muslims. He was also a leading advocate of celebrating the [[Divine Liturgy]] in [[vernacular]] languages.

==Life==

===Early life===
Joseph-Marie Raya was born to Almez and Mikhail Raya of Zahle and was the seventh of eight children.&lt;ref name="Sabada 2006, p. 55"&gt;Sabada (2006), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; After finishing his elementary education at the Oriental College he studied in Paris before entering St. Anne's seminary in [[Jerusalem]] in 1937.&lt;ref name="Sabada 2006, p. 55"/&gt; He was ordained a priest of the Melkite Catholic Church on July 20, 1941. He later taught at the Patriarchal College on Queen Nazli Street in [[Cairo]]. Raya was expelled from Egypt in 1948 by [[King Farouk]] for defending the rights of women.&lt;ref&gt;Sabana (2006), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; He emigrated to the United States in 1949.

===Birmingham and the civil rights movement===
After serving as assistant pastor of St. Ann's Melkite Catholic Church in [[Woodland Park, New Jersey]], he was appointed pastor of St. George Melkite Greek Catholic Church in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], in 1952. His championing civil rights brought him into close friendship with Rev. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] Raya marched several times at King's side and suffered three times at the hands of the [[Ku Klux Klan]],&lt;ref&gt;Sabada (2006), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; including one occasion when he was kidnapped and severely beaten by three Klansmen.&lt;ref&gt;Sabada (2006), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;  Defying the threat of excommunication issued by Roman Catholic Archbishop [[Thomas Joseph Toolen|Thomas Toolen]], Raya helped King and other civil rights demonstrators organize protests and marches throughout Alabama during the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Sabada (2006), pp. 67-70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Archbishop Toolen Criticizes Presence of Priests, Sisters in Demonstrations". ''Catholic Week'', March 19, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; Raya went on to found [[Saint Moses the Black]] Mission, the first Eastern Catholic mission for African Americans, located in downtown Birmingham.&lt;ref&gt;Sabada (2006), p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also very close to social justice activist [[Catherine Doherty]], and he became the first Associate Priest of her [[Madonna House Apostolate]] in [[Combermere, Ontario]], Canada, on July 1, 1959. When he became Archbishop of Nazareth he ordained her husband [[Eddie Doherty]] to the priesthood.

===Advocate of the vernacular for liturgical services===
As a priest in Alabama, Raya advocated for younger generations to have church services in their own languages, and translated the Gospels, Missal, and Byzantine Divine Liturgy into English. Raya created a controversy when he invited Bishop [[Fulton J. Sheen]], the famous television Catholic personality,  to celebrate the Pontifical Byzantine Divine Liturgy in English in 1958 at the Melkite National Convention. Bishop Sheen celebrated the Liturgy in English on television, inspiring some Catholics to renew calls for widespread use of the vernacular but raising the ire of traditionalists.

The Roman Catholic archbishop of Mobile, Alabama, [[Thomas Joseph Toolen|Thomas Toolen]], banned Raya from celebrating the Divine Liturgy in English in December 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Sabada (2006), pp. 61-62&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Pope John XXIII]] intervened in March 1960 at the request of Melkite Patriarch [[Maximos IV Sayegh]] to decide the question in favor of the Byzantine custom of celebrating the Divine Mysteries in the vernacular.&lt;ref&gt;Sabada (2006), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 Raya's liturgical translation was declared the official English translation for the Catholic Byzantine rites.

Patriarch Maximos IV recognized Raya's successes by elevating him to the dignity of [[Archimandrite|Grand Archimandrite]] of [[Jerusalem]] and appointing him a member of the Melkite patriarchal delegation to the [[Second Vatican Council]]. In a significant break with tradition, the church fathers of Vatican II decided to allow widespread use of vernacular in the Catholic Church. After completing his work at Vatican II Raya continued to translate Melkite works into English. In 1968, with Baron Jose de Vinck of Alleluia Press in New Jersey, he authored ''Byzantine Daily Worship'', a compendium in English of the Divine Liturgy, Office of the Hours, and the sacraments.

===Episcopate===
Following his appointment as archbishop of [[Acre, Israel|Akko]], [[Haifa]], [[Nazareth]] and All [[Galilee]] on October 20, 1968, Archbishop Joseph led a peaceful demonstration of thousands of Arabs and Jews in Israel seeking justice for the villages of [[Kafr Bir'im]] and [[Iqrit]] in Upper Galilee that had been depopulated in 1948, and then destroyed. Iqrit was the hometown of his second successor, Archbishop [[Elias Chacour]]. He sought justice through non-violent means and called upon Palestinians to be good citizens of Israel.

Describing Raya's actions, Father John Catoir wrote in 1969:

{{quote|They (Christian Arabs) are in no mood for brotherhood talks, but (Raya) commands them to stop hating the Jews, to purge their hearts of hatred and contention which breeds only misery and further suffering.

At the closing session of the Israeli parliament he thundered to the Jewish representatives, alternating between French, Arabic, and English for all to understand, that they have done to the Arabs some of the very same things they themselves lament so bitterly in their own history of persecution.

It is quite a thing to see a living prophet in action, challenging the inflamed passions of ancient enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Sabada (2006), pp. 84-85 (excerpted from Catoir, John ''A Prophet in Action'', 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In August, 1972 he ordered all churches in his eparchy closed one Sunday to mourn for "the death of justice in Israel" as the two villages remained dispossessed. Explaining his position, Raya said:

{{quote|No end justifies injustice -- even if that end seems to be the good of the state or of a nation. If you base security on denial of justice, no amount of money can guarantee that security. Not even an army as strong as all of the legions of Rome will be able to insure it.&lt;ref&gt;Nester, Marie Yaroshak. ''We Are God's People,'' p. 87. God With Us Publications, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As archbishop, Raya was a controversial figure. While many admired his charismatic style and ecumenical leadership, some Arabs and members of the church hierarchy resented his overtures to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;"Archbishop Resigns". ''The Jerusalem Post'', 30 September 1974, as referenced in Sabada, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Raya was opposed to the Melkite Holy Synod's proposal to internationalize Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Sabada (2006), p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; He also upset the Vatican with his aggressive campaign for the return of the Bir'im and Ikrit refugees and the sale of church land to impoverished Moslem farmers.&lt;ref&gt;"Archbishop Raya on reported rift with Vatican 'No one can make me resign'". ''The Jerusalem Post'', March 1973, as referenced in Sabada (2006), p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Raya's letter of resignation declared that the Church hierarchy forced his decision to leave his post.&lt;ref&gt;Sabada (2006), pp. 163-164&lt;/ref&gt; The government of Israel considered him dangerous, but when he resigned Prime Minister Golda Meir begged him to reconsider.&lt;ref&gt;Sabada (2006), p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Raya's resignation came as a shock to many. The local Christian Youth Club collected several thousand signatures asking him to reconsider,&lt;ref&gt;Sabada (2006), p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; and prominent Muslim, Jewish and Christian leaders in Israel and abroad voiced disappointment. Yoram Kaniuk described their thoughts on the archbishop, describing Raya as "incomprehensible. The great majority of people viewed him with suspicion. Because he failed to conform to generally accepted notions ... Unusual people, deeply religious men, men of morals we won't understand. Bishop Raya was out of step. He bore Israel no animosity. He cared for and looked after his spiritual flock."&lt;ref&gt;"Two Bishops in Israel - One was a Friend!" ''Heritage Newspaper'', Southwest Jewish Press, Nov. 8, 1974, as referenced in Sabada (2006), p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; Departing his post, Raya used his final pastoral letter to underscore his ecumenical approach:

{{quote|I came to the Holy Land to give. And behold! I was overwhelmed by what I received! I came to enrich and purify! And behold! I was the one to be enriched and purified. I loved the family of the Lord. His family are both the Jews and the Arabs. I held the Muslims, the Druze, the Jew, the Christian, everyone believer and unbeliever, in the same embrace.&lt;ref&gt;Raya, Joseph. Pastoral Letter, September 1974, as referenced in Sabada (2006), p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After resigning his archbishopric on July 13, 1974, Raya moved to [[Madonna House Apostolate|Madonna House]] in Combermere, Ontario, Canada. At some time between his resignation and 1975 he suffered a massive [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and had a [[quadruple bypass]] operation in Lexington, Kentucky. From his home in Combermere he lectured and wrote on Byzantine spirituality at various places,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.monitor.upeace.org/innerpg.cfm?id_article=1071|title=Peace and Conflict Monitor, Archbishop Joseph Raya ‚Äì Apostle of Peace and Love|website=www.monitor.upeace.org|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; among them [[Fordham University]]'s John XXIII Ecumenical Center in [[The Bronx]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFLpXKsNeVYC&amp;pg=PR3&amp;lpg=PR3&amp;dq=John+XXIII+Ecumenical+Center,+bronx&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qf5TrvLAaC&amp;sig=-9J5k2Pfyi-GrYy3Mb2HEb6DZa0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjSpKaaktjcAhVLEawKHd2dBDoQ6AEwAXoECA8QAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=John%20XXIII%20Ecumenical%20Center,%20bronx&amp;f=false|title=Pseudo-Dionysius: The Complete Works|last=Dionysius|date=1987|publisher=Paulist Press|isbn=9780809128389|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Patriarchal Major Seminary at Raboue in Antelias, Lebanon. He returned to Lebanon in 1985 to assist the Diocese of Beirut with Archbishop Habib Bacha. In 1987 he assumed interim leadership of the Archdiocese of Paneas in [[Marjayoun|Marjayoun, Lebanon]], which had been destroyed by the 1974 ‚àí 1991 [[Lebanese civil war]]. He moved back to Canada after the completion of this assignment and retired at Madonna House in 1990. Raya died on June 10, 2005, at St. Francis Memorial Hospital in Barry's Bay, Ontario, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.madonnahouse.org/restoration/2005/06/archbishop_joseph_m_raya_has_.html |title=Archbishop Joseph M.

The '''State Border Guard Service''' or '''SBGS''' ({{lang-lt|Valstybƒós sienos apsaugos tarnyba}}) is the organisation under the authority of the [[Ministry of the Interior (Lithuania)|Ministry of the Interior]] charged with controlling and maintaining the security of [[Lithuania]]n borders on land, in the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[Curonian Lagoon]]. Since December 21, 2007, Lithuania is part of the [[Schengen Area]] and SBGS, partner of [[Frontex]], controls about {{convert|1070|km}} of Area's external land border with [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] and [[Belarus]].

==History==
===1920‚Äì1940===
Following the [[Act of Independence of Lithuania|declaration of independence]] on February 16, 1918, Lithuania had to ensure its border protection. This was a difficult task to fulfill, because the borders were changing (Lithuanian took over the [[Klaipƒóda Region]] in 1923 and was in a perpetual dispute with [[Poland]] over the [[Vilnius Region]]), and the bodies protecting the border were changing as well (the customs and patrol guards, militia and army).

The formation of the first border regiment was started on 1 February 1920. On 26 January 1922, the Lithuanian defence minister, [[Jonas ≈†imkus]], issued an order designating 29 June as Border Regiment Day. At that time, border regiments protected the border, and the State Border Police was formed in the Klaipƒóda Region on 18 June 1923. Later, border regiments, units of the [[Ministry of Defense (Lithuania)|Ministry of Defence]], were disbanded, and the border police of the [[Ministry of the Interior (Lithuania)|Ministry of the Interior]] took over the protection of the state border on 1 January 1924. Before the [[Soviet occupation of Lithuania|first Soviet occupation]], the number of Lithuanian border police was not large: 1,656 policemen in 1931 and 1,934 in 1933. 

This strength was maintained until June 1940 when the [[Soviet Union]] occupied Lithuania. After that, some border guards were subject to political persecution, the border police was disbanded, and the [[Red Army]] took control of the Lithuanian border with [[Nazi Germany]]. Near the end of [[World War II]], the Soviets occupied Lithuania for the second time. Throughout their rule, they protected only the Lithuanian border with the [[People's Republic of Poland]]. 

===Struggle for independence 1990‚Äì1991===
{{also|Soviet OMON assaults on Lithuanian border posts}}
After Lithuania [[Act of March 11|restored its independence]] on March 11, 1990, it had to ensure the protection and inviolability of its borders. By a resolution of 3 April 1990, the [[Supreme Council ‚Äì Reconstituent Seimas|Supreme Council]] (Lithuanian parliament) assigned the Council of Ministers the task of establishing the Department of Defence thus initiating the formation of new state border guards. On 10 September 1990, the Government adopted a resolution with a view to forming services at the Ministry of Defence that were to ensure the economic protection of the Lithuanian borders. On 10 October 1990, the Government adopted a resolution to establish 61 border posts. These posts were to begin operation by 19 November, but due to lack of resources and personnel not all of them operated as intended.&lt;ref name=surg&gt;{{cite book| first=Gintautas |last=Surgailis |title=Valstybƒós sienos apsauga 1990‚Äì1994 metais |url=http://www.lka.lt/EasyAdmin/sys/files/apsauga_valstybes_sienos.pdf |publisher=[[Generolo Jono ≈Ωemaiƒçio Lietuvos karo akademija]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-9955-423-63-8  |pages=9, 144|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soviet security forces, mainly [[OMON]], carried out a campaign against unarmed Lithuanian border guards: border guards' premises were burnt and wrecked, cars stolen and bombed, and guards were beaten and harassed. On 19 May 1991, [[Gintaras ≈Ωagunis]], an officer at the Krak≈´nai border crossing point at the Lithuania‚ÄìBelarus border, was shot dead while on duty. On 31 July 1991, seven Lithuanian officers were killed in [[Medininkai]] border point. The only survivor, [[Tomas ≈†ernas]], became disabled.&lt;ref name=delfi2&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.delfi.lt/archive/article.php?id=25199095 |title=Medinink≈≥ bylos ƒØtariamasis A.Ry≈æovas teisiamas Sankt Peterburge |author=[[Baltic News Service]] |publisher=[[Delfi.lt]] |language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attacks on Lithuanian border posts continued until the attempted [[August Coup]] in Moscow on 23 August 1991.

===From 1992===
The Ministry of Defence issued an order by which the Frontier Guard Service was renamed as the State Border Guard Service, starting 6 August 1992. When the last Soviet soldier left Lithuania on 31 August 1993, the State Border Guard Service was already well established. On 18 July 1994, the Government adopted a resolution that restructured the State Border Guard Service at the Ministry of Defence into the Border Police Department at the Ministry of the Interior. As during the interwar period, guarding of the Lithuanian borders became the duty of a [[border police]].

After the system of border guarding was restored, the legal status of the state border had to be defined and the border itself demarcated. The Treaty on Restoration of the State Border between Lithuania and [[Latvia]] was signed on 29 June 1993. It required a considerable diplomatic effort to conclude and sign a treaty on the state border with Belarus on 6 February 1995. A similar treaty was signed with Poland the same year. The treaty on [[delimitation]] of the state border between Lithuania and the [[Russian Federation]] was signed during a summit in Moscow on 24 October 1997.

On 1 April 1997, the border police was re-structured. Eight border police districts were either newly formed or reorganised. Of these, seven districts guard the state border, and the [[Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant]] Security Unit secured the nuclear power plant near the town of [[Ignalina]]. On 31 March 1999, the then Lithuanian minister of the interior, [[Stasys ≈†edbaras]], issued an order to reestablish the celebration of the Border Guards' Day on 29 June. 

On 10 October 2000, the [[Seimas]] adopted the Law on the State Border Guard Service and addressed the Government with a proposal to reorganise the Border Police Department in six months. By its resolution of 22 February 2001, the Government decided to re-organise the Border Police Department into the State Border Guard Service at the Ministry of the Interior. When preparing for the re-organisation, a large number of legal acts were adopted which regulate the activity of the State Border Guard Service. Of these, the most prominent are the Law on the State Border Guard Service and the Law on the State Border and Protection Thereof. Prior to the re-organisation, the status of the Border Police Department and service in the border police were regulated by the laws on the police, on state service and others as well as by the Statute of Service in the System of the Interior. These legal acts were more about the general activity of the police. After the re-organisation was complete, the State Border Guard Service began to perform its border guard functions starting 1 May 2001.

Lithuania became a member of the [[European Union]] (EU) on 1 May 2004 and of the [[Schengen Area]] on 21 December 2007. The Lithuanian border with [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] (Russia) and [[Belarus]] became the external border of the EU and the Schengen Area. The passport control on the Latvian and Polish borders was eliminated while the checks on the Russian and Belarusian borders was strengthened.

'''Luci Pollreis''' was an [[Austria]]n [[Righteous among the Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?language=en&amp;itemId=4016986 Luci Pollreis] at [[Yad Vashem]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

The young Viennese woman hid two Jewish women and a Jew in her apartment in Vienna, on her farm and in a country house in [[Ramsau, Lower Austria|Ramsau]] near [[Hainfeld]] three years from 1942.

It was the couple, Max and Johanna Arnold and the sister of Max, Leopoldine Stern. Max has been ordered by the [[Gestapo]], to move from Pressbaum, where he lived, to Vienna. He had been commissioned to register at the Jewish community. As he desisted, he was arrested on suspicion of [[Rassenschande]] and taken to the regional court II, where he remained imprisoned for six weeks. After his release he went underground as a submarine. He met his future wife Johanna. She asked an acquaintance to help him and his sister Johanna Leopoldine.

One day this friend turned to Luci Pollreis, who lived alone since her husband was drafted into the [[Wehrmacht]]. Would she be ready to accept and hide three Jews, who are threatened to be arrested by the [[Gestapo]]? Luci Pollreis immediately gave a positive response.

Luci was a dressmaker, and Max, who was working in the same branch, helped her at work. Again and again members of the Gestapo appeared and were searching for the missing Jews. In the night she often took the three from her home to the factory, her country house or to friends. Max, Johanna Arnold and Leopoldine Stern survived the war thanks to Luci Pollreis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4028">'''Marco Donat-Cattin''' (28 September 1953 ‚Äì 19 June 1988) was an Italian terrorist. He was a founding member of [[Prima Linea]] far-left terrorist organization.

==Biography==
Donat-Cattin was born in [[Turin]], the son of trade unionist and future [[Democrazia Cristian|Christian Democracy]] minister [[Carlo Donat-Cattin]].

After having had a son when he was just 17 and later separating from the mother,&lt;ref name=LaSt&gt;{{cite journal|journal=La Stampa|first=Claudio |last=Giacchino|title=Quante lacrime per Marco|date=22 June 1988 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; he frequented the faculty of jurisprudence. In 1974 he found a job as library carer at a secondary school in Turin, where he met future terrorist Claudio Sandalo. 

Starting from 1976, he participated in the establishment of [[Prima Linea]], becoming a member of its national council. On 29 January 1979, he took part in the operation that led to the assassination in [[Milan]], together with [[Sergio Segio]], of judge Emilio Alessandrini. He was also one of the authors of the shooting of a barman in Turin in the following July.

Thanks to the relevations of Prima Linea's ''[[pentito]]'' Roberto Sandalo, he was identified as one of the organizations' main members by the Italian police. Donat-Cattin was however able to escape to [[France]]. This caused a national scandal after his father, then vice-secretary of Democrazia Cristiana (the relative majority party in Italy at the time), was accused of having helped him to cross the frontier.&lt;ref name=LaSt/&gt; [[Francesco Cossiga]], another DC member who at the time was prime minister, was also suspected and underwent an official inquiry of the Italian Parliament, which however resulted with a majority vote to archive any possible probe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Indro Montanelli|first=Indro |last=Montanelli|author2=Mario Cervi|title=L‚ÄôItalia degli anni di Fango|location=Milan|publisher=Rizzoli|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donat-Cattin  was extradited from France in 1981.

Thanks to a special law which granted reduction of sentences for dissociates from terrorist organizations and for collaborators with justice, Marco Donat-Cattin obtained [[house arrest]] in October 1985 after having been acquitted (due to insufficient evidence) from the assassination of criminologist Alfredo Paolella, bearing in mind that a key element of dissociation from terrorism was the admission of guilt for acts committed by the individual who had freely decide to dissociate. He was freed in May 1987 after having served a community-service term as re-educator for drugs-addicts.

He was struck and killed by a car on a highway near Verona in 1988 while he was trying to rescue a woman who had remained entrapped in another car accident. At his public funerals, Italian priest Don Mazzi highlighted the itinerary of Marco Donat-Cattin from the dark years of communist-driven terrorism to his ultimate "sacrifice" to save a life.&lt;ref&gt;http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1988/06/22/che-io-sia-cancellato-dalla-terra.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the daughter of Mr. Aldo Moro, the Italian political leader kidnapped and killed by the Red Brigades, Ms. Maria Fida Moro, reacted to a controversial statement made by a former terrorist on the 40th anniversary of his father's murder by indicating that the only former terrorist that she had respect for had been Marco Donat-Cattin, who would have wanted "to be cancelled from the world and who died trying to give back to others part of what he had taken away".

{{Libertarianism in the United States sidebar}}

The '''Minaret of Freedom Institute''' is an [[Islam]]ic [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] organization established in 1993 and based in [[Bethesda, Maryland]]. It is dedicated to educating both [[Muslims]] and non-Muslims.&lt;ref name="Mission"&gt;[http://www.minaret.org/mission.htm Mission Statement] at Minaret of Freedom Institute web site.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was co-founded by [[Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad]], its president, and Shahid N. Shah, its treasurer.&lt;ref name=staff&gt;[http://www.minaret.org/Staff.htm Staff and Board listing] at Minaret of Freedom Institute web site.&lt;/ref&gt; Its early board of advisers included former [[Richard Nixon]] advisor [[Robert D. Crane]], a convert to Islam, and [[Charles Butterworth (philosopher)|Charles Butterworth]], a [[University of Maryland]] Islamic scholar.&lt;ref&gt;Tarek Atia, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-905515.html A Center For Muslim Thought; Think Tank Will Try To Be Cultural Bridge], [[The Washington Post]], August 18, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Its current board of directors and board of advisers include religious, academic and business leaders.&lt;ref name=staff/&gt;

== Mission ==
Its Mission Statement aims for non-Muslims are: 
* "to counter distortions and misconceptions about Islamic beliefs and practice"
* "to demonstrate the Islamic origins of modern values like the rule of law and sciences like market economics
* "to advance the status of Muslim peoples maligned by a hostile environment in the West and oppressed by repressive political regimes in the East"

Its Mission Statement aims for Muslims (in concert with Qur'an and the Sunnah obligations) are:
* "to discover and publish the politico-economic policy implications of Islamic law (shari`ah) and their consequences on the economic well-being of the community"
* "to expose both American and Islamic-world Muslims to free market thought"
* "to educate Islamic religious and community leaders in economics and in the fact that liberty is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for the achievement of a good society"
* "to promote the establishment of free trade and justice (an essential common interest of Islam and the West)"

It implements these goals through independent scholarly research into policy issues of concern to Muslims; publication of scholarly and popular expositions of such research; translation of appropriate works on the free market into the languages of the Muslim world; and the operation of a scholars exchange program.&lt;ref name="Mission"/&gt;

== Religious views ==

===Sharia law===
The Institute holds that adherence to [[Sharia]] law and even Islamist politics can be compatible with libertarian ideas.&lt;ref name="Reason"&gt;Tim Cavanaugh, [http://www.reason.com/interviews/minaret.shtml Revealed Libertarianism: Minaret of Freedom tries to square the Quran with the free market] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724154229/http://www.reason.com/interviews/minaret.shtml |date=2008-07-24 }}, [[Reason (magazine)|Reason Magazine]] interview with Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad, July 28, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In a paper delivered at a 2005 Center for the Study of Islam and
Democracy conference Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad noted the similarities of American secularism and Islamic law, argued that the free exercise of religion is inherently part of Islamic law and outlined a vision of "Islamic pluralism" where the  traditional [[dhimmi]] system of protection of non-Muslims must be explicitly protected constitutionally.&lt;ref&gt;Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad, Ph.D., [http://www.minaret.org/Secular%20Government.pdf Reconciling Secular Government with Islamic Law], Minaret of Freedom Institute, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad commented on the [[Saudi Arabia]]n Embassy's Islamic Affairs Department distribution of "[[Noble Qur'an (Hilali-Khan)|The Noble Koran]]" which included commentary that disparaged Jews and Christians. Ahmad told [[The Washington Post]] "The outcry was so great...People were disgusted. And it wasn't just liberals. I couldn't find an American Muslim who had anything good to say about that edition. I would call it a Wahhabi Koran."&lt;ref&gt;Caryle Murphy, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/04/AR2006090401107_pf.html For Conservative Muslims, Goal of Isolation a Challenge], [[Washington Post]], September 5, 2006, A01.&lt;/ref&gt;

Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad has been quoted as calling the [[September 11th attacks]] in the name of Islam as an offense against Islam. He has written that it is the moral duty of Muslims to identify the perpetrators and their supporters and ‚Äúconfront them with the fact that their actions have violated sharia‚Äôah (sic) in a most egregious manner, to urge them to repent and to punish them if the families of the victims are unwilling to be merciful and accept compensation.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Joyce M.

The institute deviates from orthodox Islamic thinking in its belief that the [[Qur'an]]ic prohibition of [[riba]] ([[usury]]) does not prohibit all lending at [[interest]], only that which is excessively high.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Visser, Herschel Visser, ''Islamic Finance: Principles and Practice,'' Edward Elgar Publishing, 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KIXe3rY_OkgC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=Minaret+of+Freedom+Institute&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WXudt7-Oty&amp;sig=pC3vAV6BbOlEYIm72LoKs4CIm7c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ozUnUIHELbCe6gGYz4DgBA&amp;ved=0CNEBEOgBMBs#v=onepage&amp;q=Minaret%20of%20Freedom%20Institute&amp;f=false p. 32 ], {{ISBN|1845425251}}, 9781845425258&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minaret.org/riba.htm Riba and Interest: Definitions and Implications], Minaret of Freedom Institute Preprint Series 96-5, delivered at 22nd Conference of American Muslim Social Scientists, October 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad has stated that the Islamic world pioneered the [[scientific method]], but may have been unable to progress to an [[industrial revolution]] because the prohibition of interest prevented would-be inventors from obtaining the necessary financing to develop their inventions.&lt;ref name="Reason"/&gt;

===Circumcision===
With regards to [[female circumcision]], Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad writes that [[clitoridectomy]] and [[infibulation]] should be viewed as practices [[haraam|prohibited]] by Islam because they jeopardize the girl's future ability to enjoy sexual relations with her husband, and hence should be considered [[makruh|disliked]]. He dismisses hygienic or religious justifications for "this painful and potentially harmful practice."&lt;ref name= circumcision/&gt; Ahmad supports male circumcision, writing that although it is not prescribed in the Qur'an "[[male circumcision]] is clearly a Muslim tradition."&lt;ref name= circumcision&gt;Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad, Ph.D., [http://www.minaret.org/fgm-pamphlet.htm Female Genital Mutilation: an Islamic Perspective], Minaret of Freedom Institute Pamphlet #1, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==

===Civil liberties===
In 1999 the Institute sponsored a panel on ‚ÄúSecular Threats to Freedom of Expression,‚Äù which was labeled ‚Äúsecular fundamentalism," and identified as being as great a threat to liberty as religious fundamentalism. Two speakers shared their personal stories, [[Merve Kavak√ßƒ±]], an elected Turkish parliamentarian removed from office because she insisted on wearing the [[hijab]] (Islamic headcovering) and [[Sami Al-Arian]], a tenured [[University of South Florida]] professor who at the time was threatened with dismissal because a former leader of his dialogue group of  Muslim and non-Muslim intellectuals later was identified as the head of the [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad]]. Al-Arian described how the [[Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996|1996 immigration legislation]] had led to 29 individuals being held in prison for years under ‚Äúsecret evidence‚Äù provisions, noting that 28 were Muslims.&lt;ref name="Panel"&gt;Ayesha Ahmad, [http://www.islamawareness.net/Secularism/activists.html Muslim Activists Reject Secular Fundamentalism], originally published at [[IslamOnline]], April 22, 1999. See also [http://www.minaret.org/dinner5.pdf Minaret of Freedom 5th Annual Dinner, Edited Transcript], Minaret of Freedom Institute website.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the September 11th attacks Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad spoke out about suspicion of and accusations against Muslims that worried many American Muslims, making them more cautious.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xU8qAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ElMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4216,2354844&amp;dq=minaret-of-freedom&amp;hl=en Hate Crimes Surge in 2001, FBI says], [[The Dispatch (Lexington)|The Dispatch]], (Lexington, KY), November 26, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; After the U.S. government closed down the [[Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development]] charity and convicted its leaders of financing terrorism, Ahmad stated that the convictions shocked Muslims, confused donors and ‚Äúseems to give a green light for further intimidation of Muslim charities.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Goodstein, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KkQgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=k4YEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6832,601565&amp;dq=minaret+of+freedom+palestine&amp;hl=en Muslims taken aback by charity case], [[New York Times]], November 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad and Minaret Vice President Aly R. Abuzaakouk signed a letter in ‚Äúdefense of free speech‚Äù condemning ‚Äúany intimidation or threats of violence directed against any individual or group exercising the rights of freedom of religion and speech; even when that speech may be perceived as hurtful or reprehensible.‚Äù They expressed concern about threats ‚Äúmade against individual writers, cartoonists, and others by a minority of Muslims‚Äù and called on all Muslims to ‚Äúrefrain from violence.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Kay, [http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2010/09/29/good-news-north-american-muslims-take-a-stand-in-favour-of-free-speech/ Good news: North American Muslims take a stand in favour of free speech], [[The National Post]], September 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sami Al-Arian===

The Minaret of Freedom has supported Sami Al-Arian&lt;ref&gt;Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad, [http://www.minaret.org/Public%20diplomacy%20in%20american%20foreign%20policy.pdf Bridging the Divide? The Role of the American Muslim Community in U.S. Relations with the Wider Islamic World], originally presented as a talk at the Brookings Institution on January 9, 2006, on the Minaret of Freedom website.
*Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad, [http://www.minaret.org/grandjury.pdf ‚ÄúGrand Jury Abuse in the Service of Islamophobia‚Äù], paper presented at the AMSS 36th ANNUAL CONFERENCE Cosponsored by The Department of Government and Politics, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, October 26 ‚Äì 28, 2007 .

who was indicted in 2003 for alleged terrorist ties to Palestinian Islamic Jihad, acquitted of most charges by a jury that deadlocked on other charges. After spending more time in jail, in 2006 Al-Arian plead guilty to conspiracy and was sentenced to 57 months in prison and deportation upon release.&lt;ref name="Laughlin-plea"&gt;MegLaughlin, [http://www.sptimes.com/2006/04/23/Hillsborough/In_his_plea_deal__wha.shtml In his plea deal, what did Sami Al-Arian admit to?] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sptimes.com%2F2006%2F04%2F23%2FHillsborough%2FIn_his_plea_deal__wha.shtml&amp;date=2012-10-21 |date=2012-10-21 }}, [[St. Petersburg Times]], April 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 an [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], [[Virginia]] grand jury subpoena was issued to the Minaret of Freedom Institute seeking notes about the symposium on ‚ÄúThe United States and Iran: It‚Äôs Time to Talk‚Äù that he moderated in 1999. Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad told the [[New York Sun]] that he believed the agents sought information because Sami Al-Arian had attended the event. He noted that the same prosecutor seeking Al-Arian‚Äôs grand jury testimony at the time had signed the subpoena. Ahmad never was required to testify to the grand jury.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Gerstein, [http://www.nysun.com/national/subpoenas-issued-in-a-terror-finance-probe-spark/50942/ Subpoenas Issued in a Terror-Finance Probe Spark a Secret Battle Before a Federal Court], [[New York Sun]], March 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-imperialism===
Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad told [[Reason (magazine)|''Reason'' magazine]] that Western liberals had abandoned their [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] views, including by invading Iraq, and thus had alienated Islamists from pro-liberty viewpoints. He stated Western government financial support for various factions in Muslim and Arab countries tends to prop up the most oppressive elements.&lt;ref name="Reason"/&gt;

===Opposition to Zionism===
The Institute defines the [[Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict]] in terms of Israel's violations of individual property rights, starting with the fact that Jews owned only 7 percent of the land in Palestine in 1948 but have gained control of most of it as of today. Ahmad states that "Israelis employ a series of strategies to keep pressure on the indigenous people to leave."&lt;ref&gt;[http://antiwar.com/radio/2009/01/26/dean-ahmad-2/ Scott Horton Interviews Dean Ahmad] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415204728/http://antiwar.com/radio/2009/01/26/dean-ahmad-2/ |date=2012-04-15 }}, [[Antiwar.com]] radio, January 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad, [http://www.minaret.org/israeliaid.htm The Real Reason to Oppose Aid to Israel], Minaret of Freedom website, printed in [[Liberty (1987)|Liberty Magazine]] as ‚ÄúThe Dark Side of Israel,‚Äù v. 15 #4 (April 2001), p.39.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his address to the First Conference on Jerusalem in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]] in 2001 Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad expressed his desire for the "liberation of Jerusalem." He stated that American‚Äôs support for [[Zionism]] was due to their hearing ‚Äúonly what the Zionist-controlled media and politicians have let them know‚Äù and the failure of Palestinians to be "frank and direct with the people of America and the world, preferring to work with corrupt governments in the Muslim world or with power-hungry revolutionary movements." He stated the American people were unaware of "Zionism‚Äôs history, its racist foundation, its colonialist nature, and the systematic brutality of its daily dealings with the indigenous people of Palestine.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad, [http://www.minaret.org/beirutconference.htm Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad's Address to the First Conference on Jerusalem] in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], January 29, 2001, at Minaret of Freedom Institute web site.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 Ahmad told Reason magazine that the Zionist movement had socialist and fascist wings, neither supportive of classical liberalism and that Israel today is ‚Äúcharacterized mostly as a socialist, militarist and racist entity,‚Äù which he held are incompatible with ‚Äúlibertarian ideals.‚Äù&lt;ref name="Reason"/&gt;

The '''Movement for European Reform''', abbreviated to '''MER''', was a pan-European alliance of national [[centre-right]] [[political party|political parties]] with [[conservatism|conservative]], [[economic liberalism|pro-free market]] and [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] inclinations.  It consisted of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] of the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democratic Party]] of the [[Czech Republic]].

Founded on 13 July 2006, MER was created as a precursor to the [[Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists]] (AECR) and [[European Conservatives and Reformists]] (ECR),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date = 2009-05-15|author = Charter, David|url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6289822.ece|title = David Cameron‚Äôs new European allies set to include odd bedfellows|publisher = [[The Times]]|accessdate = 2009-05-15 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Political groups of the European Parliament|political group]] in the [[European Parliament]] that was launched in June 2009 following [[European Parliament election, 2009|European elections]].  Its operations folded into the ECR and the AECR later that year.

== History ==
MER was formed as an interim measure to function outside the European Parliament&lt;ref name="Euro declaration"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5175994.stm|title = Cameron Euro declaration|publisher = [[BBC News]]|accessdate = 2008-05-27 | date=2006-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; until a new [[political groups of the European Parliament|group]] could be formed within it after the 2009 elections.&lt;ref name="Kubosova"&gt;{{cite web|author= Kubosova, Lucia|date = 13 July 2006|url = http://euobserver.com/9/22085|title = Plans to form new MEP group kicked into 2009|publisher = [[EUobserver]]|accessdate = 2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until then, its MEPs continued as members of the now-dissolved [[European Democrats|ED subgroup]] within the broader [[European People's Party - European Democrats|EPP-ED]] group.

Since its launch, it was unclear as to whether the MER would remain a simple pan-European alliance or apply for official recognition as a ''[[political party at European level]]'' (sometimes called a ''Europarty''). The body's founding statement expressly offered membership to parties from non-EU member states, a characteristic of other Europarties, and its commitment to fight the 2009 election together suggested an appetite for recognition.

After the [[European Parliament election, 2009|2009 European election]], members of the MER initiated the [[European Conservatives and Reformists Group]], a new [[European Parliament political group|political group in the European Parliament]].

The MER website stopped being updated in 2007 and, in June 2009, the British Conservative [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] [[William Hague]] said that the MER's aims and activities would be folded into the new European Parliamentary group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |date = 2 June 2009|url = http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thetorydiary/2009/06/william-hague-gives-a-reply-if-not-an-answer-to-the-question-what-does-we-will-not-let-matters-rest-.html|title = William Hague gives a reply (if not an answer) to the question: "What does 'We will not let matters rest there' actually mean in practice?"|publisher = [[ConservativeHome]]|accessdate = 2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideology ==
MER's position was that the [[European Union]] should exist; however, it should be a looser supranational organisation than the current structure. This makes it more [[Eurosceptic]] than the three major [[European political party|European-level political movements]] (the [[European People's Party]], [[Party of European Socialists]] and [[European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party]]), but less Eurosceptic than formations such as the [[Europe of Freedom and Democracy]], the successor to the [[Independence and Democracy]] group in the European Parliament.

== Members ==
Members of MER were:

*{{UK}} - [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]
*{{CZE}} - [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democratic Party]]

In the first week of March 2007, under [[Petar Stoyanov]], the [[Bulgaria]]n [[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|Union of Democratic Forces]] (UDF) decided to join. A day after the UDF's announcement, the Presidency of the [[European People's Party]] (EPP) recommended that UDF be suspended from the EPP. The President of the EPP [[Wilfried Martens]] justified the suspension, arguing that:

{{cquote|''...It is not compatible for a member party of the EPP to join such an initiative and at the same time remain in our party. The EPP is committed to reforming the European Union (EU) and we are open for constructive dialogue with our non-EPP allies but, at the same time, we expect UDF to be loyal and committed to its membership obligations...&lt;ref name="SITE OF THE EPP"&gt;{{cite web|year = 2007|url = http://www.epp.eu/newsdetail.php?hoofdmenuID=4&amp;newsID=219&amp;submenuID=49&amp;subsubmenuID=135|title = EPP Presidency suspends Bulgarian UDF - EPP President reveals reform plan in article|publisher = [[European People's Party]]|accessdate = 2008-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bulgaria rejected"&gt;{{cite web|date=9 March 2007|url = http://www.sofiaecho.com/article/epp-suggests-ceased-membership-for-bulgarias-udf/id_21135/catid_68|title = EPP Suggests ceased membership for Bulgaria's UDF|publisher = ''[[The Sofia Echo]]''|accessdate = 2008-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;''}}

In mid April 2007, the UDF backtracked and stated that it remained loyal to the EPP and that it would never leave the EPP section of the [[EPP-ED]] Group to join another Group. A month later, in the first-ever elections for the European Parliament in Bulgaria (20 May 2007) the UDF failed to elect any seats. As a result, Petar Stoyanov - who was accused by his critics of making poor decisions during the campaign, including the MER choice - resigned as UDF leader. In September 2007, the UDF formally withdrew from the MER and re-affirmed its membership with the EPP.&lt;ref name="Bulgaria rejoins EPP"&gt;{{cite web|year = 2008|url = http://www.epp.eu/newsdetail.php?hoofdmenuID=4&amp;newsID=276&amp;submenuID=49&amp;subsubmenuID=141|title = EPP withdraws motion to suspend Bulgarian party|publisher = [[European People's Party]]|accessdate = 2008-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Cyber Security Policy''' is a policy framework by [[Department of Electronics and Information Technology]] (DeitY)&lt;ref name=" http://deity.gov.in/content/national-cyber-security-policy-2013-1"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://deity.gov.in/content/national-cyber-security-policy-2013-1|title= National Cyber Security Policy-2013  |work= Department Of Electronics &amp; Information Technology, Government Of India|date=1 July 2013|accessdate= 21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims at protecting the public and private infrastructure from cyber attacks.&lt;ref name=cyber/&gt; The policy also intends to safeguard "information, such as personal information (of web users), financial and banking information and sovereign data". This was particularly relevant in the wake of [[US National Security Agency]] (NSA) leaks that suggested the US government agencies are spying on Indian users, who have no legal or technical safeguards against it. [[Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (India)]] defines [[Cyberspace]] as a complex environment consisting of interactions between people, software services supported by worldwide distribution of information and communication technology.&lt;ref name=cyber&gt;{{cite web|title=Amid spying saga, India unveils cyber security policy|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-07-03/security/40350252_1_national-cyber-security-policy-cyber-crime-cyber-attacks|work=Times of India |location=INDIA|date=3 July 2013|accessdate=24 September 2013| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = National Cyber Security Policy 2013: An Assessment |publisher= [[Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses]] | url=http://www.idsa.in/idsacomments/NationalCyberSecurityPolicy2013_stomar_260813|date= 26 August 2013|accessdate = 2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Reason for Cyber Security==
[[India]] had no [[Cyber security]] policy before 2013.

This sparked a furor among people. Under pressure, the government unveiled a National Cyber Security Policy 2013 on 2 July 2013.

'''''Nina Iraq''''' is a bilingual magazine for [[Iraq]]i women  everywhere, running articles mostly on women‚Äôs empowerment themes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/economic-empowerment&lt;/ref&gt; It is published a couple of times a year as a hard copy magazine, with digital publication and interaction on the Website as the live feed. ''Nina-Iraq'' is published by NGO the Private Sector Development Centre in Iraq (PSDC).&lt;ref name="PSDC"&gt;[http://psdc-iraq.org PSDC]&lt;/ref&gt;  with support from the [[World Bank Group]]  for the first issue and ongoing support from Chamber Trade Sweden &lt;ref name="CTS"&gt;[http://chambertradesweden.se/ CTS]&lt;/ref&gt;   into 2015 and beyond. Nina-Iraq focusses on economic empowerment opportunities by showcasing real voices through interviews and stories in both English and Arabic. The printed magazine is fed by features from the Nina-Iraq website.

== History ==
Designed to create trade links and shared expertise in a digital Iraqi homeland, Nina aims to inspire collaboration by 5 million Iraqi diaspora with in country Iraqi's. The distribution of 20,000 magazines in Iraq  and internationally occurs through private sector organisations and chambers of trade - as well as online interaction.
Nina was created in response to calls to action such as co-founder Madeleine White's report on Women in the Private Sector in MENA.&lt;ref name="Women in Private Sector Report"&gt;[https://www.wiltonpark.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/WP1321-Report.pdf MENA Wilton Park Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Winter 2013 ===
Nina gets a name and a brand. Nina is one of the names of Goddess "[[Inana]]", representing fertility, beauty and love to the ancient people of Mesopotamia. The Goddess appeared for the first time in the lands of "Sumer" 5,000 years ago. She was symbolized in cuneiform writing by an octagon star that referred to the planet Venus. She also came to symbolize the desire of communication between man and woman; from her body, a new life arises. Nina is a shortening on Inana, can be pronounced used in English and Arabic and has no modern religious connotations, instead referencing Iraq's rich past.

=== Spring 2014 ===
In April Issue 1 was launched in London in the House of Commons &lt;ref name="Nina-Iraq Launch London"&gt;[http://nina-iraq.com/2014/05/22/nina-launches-in-the-house-of-commons-in-london-29th-april Nina House of Commons Launch]&lt;/ref&gt;  by [http://lorelyburt.org.uk/en/article/2014/825331/female-business-champion-appointed-to-help-new-and-growing-firms Lorely Burt MP], with support by ABCC Chair [[Elizabeth Symons, Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean|Baroness Symonds of Vernham Dean]].    In May Issue 1 was launched with Chamber Trade Sweden and the Swedish diaspora Stockholm.&lt;ref name="Nina-Iraq Launch Stockholm"&gt;[http://nina-iraq.com/2014/05/22/sweden-celebrates-nina-19th-may Nina Stockholm Launch]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Summer 2014 ===
The Iraqi launch took place at the Grand Millennium Hotel in Suleimania in early June with support from Asiacell.&lt;ref name="Iraqi Launch"&gt;[http://www.iraq-businessnews.com/2014/06/10/nina-launches-in-iraq Asiacell‚Äôs Chairman Faruk Rasool supports Iraqi launch]&lt;/ref&gt; The incursion of Isis, meant focus on the online edition of Nina. Nina's poem was written in order to create a united vision for all the volunteers disheartened by the invasion of ISIS, who were worried about Nina's relevance and future.

== Features ==
Nina-Iraq‚Äôs contributors are normal people, not journalists, although some special interviews are professionally done. For example, business opportunities around environmental sustainability, health and oil and gas are presented, offering industry for  Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan. Contributors can upload their stories directly via Share My Story, Email or work to get journalistic support via corporate volunteer portal, [[Benefacto]]. Examples include a  call to action by 14-year-old Mariam,&lt;ref&gt;http://nina-iraq.com/2014/09/23/living-in-the-future-iraq/&lt;/ref&gt; a  Women in Islam story by finance expert Natalie Schoon and an interview with global Vital Voices Winner Suaad Allami.&lt;ref&gt;http://nina-iraq.com/2014/09/18/women-in-islam-a-wider-perspective/&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft's masr ta3mal education and  Aspire Woman Mentoring platforms can be accessed directly. There is also a business register on Nina's Directory.

== Particular characteristics ==
All submitted features are translated into either Arabic or English, depending on submission language in order to create a shared cultural dialogue to a wider audience. By focusing so strongly on women, there is a question however, whether wider political and social issues are being sufficiently addressed through Nina. As a women's magazine it has also been confused with a lifestyle or beauty magazine.

During a visit to [[Fraser Valley]], Olive addressed a group of her followers about her preference of flats over heels after following her husband's two campaigns.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=P.M's Wife Changes Shoes|last=Abbotsford|first=B.C.|date=May 30, 1962|work=Winnipeg Free Press|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She spoke French and considered her French grammar better than her English grammar, she would even address the French speaking voters in French. She was a very talented conversationalists.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

John considered Olive an asset to his campaign team because of her ability to swoon the voters and remember names. She would write her husband notes during his speeches with advice on how to appeal to the voters, for instance, during 1963 while John was delivering a speech in [[Cape Breton, Nova Scotia]] Olive wrote him a note to mention the painting they had hung over their fireplace back at home which is a landscape of Cape Brenton to help appeal to his audience.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Although she was very politically active, she was very humble about her participation and considered her and John to be a strong team.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She was well known for her grace when hosting at [[24 Sussex Drive]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Interests ==
Olive had several hobbies including; sewing, leather work and metal work. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She also would give items from her closet to local bazaars supporting Women's Institutes like her, white fitted floral hat bought by Misses Bell Hall, an Ontarian Councillor.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

==Legacy==
Olive Diefenbaker Drive in [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan]] is named in her honour.

'''Pluto Press''' was set up in London by Richard Kuper in 1969 to support and promote political debate and activism.

==University of Michigan Press controversy==

Prior to [[Palgrave Macmillan]], Pluto Press was distributed by The [[University of Michigan Press]] in the United States.

'''Policja''' ({{IPA-pl|p…îÀàlitÕ°sja}}) is the generic name for the [[police]] in [[Poland]]. The Polish police force was known as ''policja'' throughout the [[Second Polish Republic]] (1918‚Äì1939), and in modern [[post-communist]] Republic of Poland since 1990. Its current size is 100,000 officers and ca. 25,000 civilian employees. Among the branches in the force are: Criminal Service, Traffic Police Service, Prevention Service and Supporting Service. Most towns and some villages have their own [[municipal police|city guards]], which supervise public order and road safety. However, city guards have jurisdiction only over [[misdemeanor]]s and in cases of crimes may serve only in a supportive role for the state police.

==Terminology==
[[File:Policja Ruchu.jpg|thumb|left|A pair of uniformed officers of the Policja]]
The force's name, ''Policja'', translates into the [[English language]] as '''Police'''.

An individual officer is typically called a ''{{lang|pl|policjant}}'' (plural ''{{lang|pl|policjanci}}''); these are not, however, official titles and are not included in the official rank structure, they are simply terms used to refer to any police officer regardless of the rank they may hold. A [[police station]] is known as ''{{lang|pl|Komenda Policji}}'' or ''{{lang|pl|Komisariat Policji}}'' both of which translate more or less into English as Police Commissariat. Female officers may be referred to as ''{{lang|pl|policjantki}}'', the singular of which is ''{{lang|pl|policjantka}}''.

On the whole, officers' individual ranks are not used by the general public and thus when addressing an officer, it is common to hear the term ''{{lang|pl|Pan}}'' (female - ''{{lang|pl|Pani}}''), Polish for mister/miss used to refer to police officers. On occasion, this may or may not be followed by the term ''{{lang|pl|Oficer}}''.

==History==
[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 121-0282, Warschau, Verkehrsposten der poln. Polizei.jpg|thumb|left|An officer of the State Police on traffic duty in [[Warsaw]], 1939]]
In 1919, with the re-independence of the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish nation]], the state reorganised itself along non-federalist lines and established a centralised form of government. Under the auspices of the new government, a new national police force was formed; this 'Polish State Police' (Policja Pa≈Ñstwowa)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dws-xip.pl/wojna/2rp/ad8.html History of State Police 1919-1939] (Polish)&lt;/ref&gt; then existed as the primary law enforcement agency for the entire nation up until the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in 1939. During the [[inter-war period]], a number of key law enforcement duties were delegated to other formations, such as the [[Polish Border Guard|Border Guard]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strazgraniczna.pl/wps/portal|title=Stra≈º Graniczna|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Military Gendarmerie (Poland)|Military Gendarmerie]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zw.wp.mil.pl/en/74.html History of Polish Gendarmerie]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the end of World War II and the [[History of Poland (1945‚Äì1989)#Creation of the Polish People's Republic (1944‚Äì48)|onset]] of the [[People's Republic of Poland|communist period]], the new Soviet backed government decided to radically change the structure of policing in Poland; the state 'Policja' was renamed as the '[[Milicja Obywatelska]]' (Citizen's Militia), a name which was meant to reflect a change in the role of the police, from an instrument of oppression ensuring the position of the bourgeoisie, to a force composed of, and at the service of 'normal citizens'. Ironically the reality turned out to be largely the opposite and the Milicja instead represented a rather state-controlled force which was used to exert political repression on the citizens. The Milicja was, for the most part, detested by the general populace; events such as the police's conduct during the [[Gdansk shipyard strike#Early strikes .281980.29|Gda≈Ñsk Shipyard Strike]] and surrounding the [[Jerzy Popie≈Çuszko|Popie≈Çuszko affair]], only worsened the people's view of their law enforcement agencies.

After the [[History of Poland (1945‚Äì1989)#Politics of the People's Republic's last years and the transition period|fall of the communist government]] in Poland, the system was reformed once again, this time reviving the pre-war name of 'Policja' and albeit with a few minor changes, the general system of law-enforcement of the [[Second Polish Republic|Second Republic]].

==Transportation and equipment==
[[Image:Policyjne radiowozy.jpg|left|thumb|Service vehicles of the Polish police in current (2009 onwards) livery, with a highways duty policeman in the new uniform (2009 onwards)]]
Today, most common types include various models from [[Kia Motors|Kia]] ([[Kia cee'd|Cee'd]] model - ca. 4000 in use) [[≈†koda Auto|≈†koda]] (mainly [[≈†koda Octavia|Octavia]]), [[Alfa Romeo]], [[Ford|Ford Mondeo]], [[Opel]] (mainly [[Opel Astra]]), [[Volkswagen]], and [[Toyota]], as of 2011 the [[FSO Polonez]] (manufactured in Poland) is no longer in use. The Polish police force has, since joining the [[European Union]], been undergoing a thorough restructuring and has in the process acquired a large number of new vehicles; as of 2011 this process is still ongoing and new vehicles are constantly being procured in order to replace ageing old patrol cars as their service lives come to an end. In addition to standard sedan and hatchback model vehicles, the Policja has been investing significant amounts of money in developing their ability to respond to any incident no matter where it may be, this has in turn led to the purchase of a large number of all-terrain 4x4 vehicles and multi-purpose vans and trucks. This expansion in capabilities was a stated requirement of the police force's restructuring program.

Beginning in 2009, the painting scheme is being modified to a silver body design with blue reflective strip, similar to modern German police cars.

Traditionally, vehicles were painted a dark blue color with side doors painted in white, and with white stripes and the word "POLICJA" on both sides. Earlier versions (used at the beginning of the 1990s) had a thinner stripe with the word "POLICJA" written under it. This design was adopted from the paint scheme used by the communist [[milicja]]. Some formerly used vehicles even had visible traces of the word "POLICJA" being corrected from "MILICJA", with the first two letters in a different shade of white, on a patch of a different shade of blue.

All uniformed and most non-uniformed officers of the state police are routinely armed. In addition to their firearm, Policja officers carry [[handcuffs]] and a number of other pieces of equipment which usually includes a personal radio system for communication with other officers and their police station. [[Pepper spray]] is also commonly issued to officers in order to provide them with an alternative non-violent weapon with which to incapacitate violent suspects.

Riot police, when needs be, are provided with non-ballistic body armour, helmets and shields. In such cases they also dispose [[LRAD]] units. The existence of a well-enforced ban on civilian-owned firearms in Poland has significantly aided the police in keeping gun crime to a minimum, and thus the incidence of police firearms use is low.

In addition to the airborne and land-based patrol units of the Policja, many regional commands, and especially those based near the coast or through which major waterways flow, have maritime units. The largest of police maritime units are currently found on the [[Vistula]] river in Warsaw (under the command of the Capital Police) and the [[Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship]] where there is a large network of lakes and rivers. In coastal areas, maritime law enforcement cooperation also exists between the Policja and the [[Polish Border Guard]].

The Policja's general commandant is the senior-most officer of the Polish police. The rank of the general commandant (usually General Inspector) is considered to be equivalent to that of a ranking general in the Polish military and this both himself and his subordinate chief inspectors (who are also considered Police 'Generals') are entitled to wear embroidered white eagles, the state symbol, on their uniform lapels.

The general commandant's office is based in Warsaw's Pu≈Çawska Street. It is from here that the day-to-day administration and organisation of the Polish police's activities is coordinated. The commandant's office is considered to have jurisdictional supremacy over all its other commands, and voivodeship/municipal commandants are responsible to the general commandant in their capacity as his regional 'executives'.

The office of general commandant has existed in a number of guises throughout the existence of the Polish police, and whilst the current office came into being following Poland's transformation into a liberal democracy in 1990, the same rank was also used for the highest-ranking officer of the State Police of the [[Second Polish Republic|Second Republic]] during the inter-war years. Nowadays, holders of this office are considered to be successors to the commandants of the inter-war state police; commanding officers of the communist-era Milicja Obywatelska ''(Citizens' Militia)'' however, are not considered successors of the original cadre of Policja generals as they exercised authority over an organisation often utilised by the state as an instrument of political oppression.

Since 1990 there have been twelve general commandants of the Policja who have completed their service. General Inspector Marek Papa≈Ça, the formet holder of the office, was assassinated by a person or persons unknown on 25 June 1998. He was shot in the head with a silenced weapon whilst exiting his car near his home in Warsaw's southern [[Mokot√≥w]] district.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazetawyborcza.pl/1,75478,3697758.html Kim sƒÖ J√≥zef Sasin, Roman Kurnik i Ryszard Bieszy≈Ñski&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The commandant's murder remains unsolved and is considered to be one of the most significant outstanding cases under active investigation by the Polish police.

==Structure and branches of the Policja==
The Policja is currently divided into a number of different services. Each voivodeship/municipal command has subdivisions within its force. This leaves the police service with a large number of specialised branches which can more specifically target certain types of crime and apply more expert knowledge in the investigation of cases relating to their area of policing. In addition to these specific groups, all police forces retain a majority of officers for the purpose of patrol duty and general law enforcement. 
[[Image:PolishPoliceEagle.png|upright|thumb|The cap badge of the Policja is common to all ranks and branches.]]
Typically a constituent force of the Policja will contain the following subdivisions within its structure:
*Criminal Police ''({{lang|pl|Policja Kryminalna}})'' - investigation and prevention of serious and violent crime
**The criminal police may include specislised teams such as anti-drugs and financial crime prevention units
**All forces have crime scene and forensics units
*Preventative Police ''({{lang|pl|Policja Prewencyjna}})'' - general law enforcement operations and patrol duty (includes anti-terrorist and riot police divisions)
*Traffic Police ''({{lang|pl|Policja Ruchu Drogowego}})'' - road safety, traffic marshalling and highway patrol/pursuit
*Logistical Support Police ''({{lang|pl|Policja WspomagajƒÖca}})'' - provision of logistical support and technical skills
*Police Aviation Service ''({{lang|pl|S≈Çu≈ºba Lotnictwa Policji}})'' - aviation support (not present in every force)
*Investigative Police ''({{lang|pl|Policja ≈öledcza}})'' - investigation of complex cases and process of referral to the state prosecutor's office
*Judicial Police ''({{lang|pl|Policja SƒÖdowa}})'' - protection of court and state prosecutor's office premises, judges, prosecutors, victims and suspects, execution of court orders
*Maritime Police ''({{lang|pl|Policja Wodna}})'' - maritime patrol and pursuit

== Anti-terrorism units (BOA/SPAP) ==
[[Image:Police Poland 2 AB.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A riot police officer of the Preventative Police]]
The Policja has highly qualified and well-equipped [[counter-terrorism]] formations. The central (national-level) anti-terrorism is BOA KGP (''Biuro Operacji Antyterrorystycznych Komendy G≈Ç√≥wnej Policji'', Bureau of Anti-terrorism Operations of The Policja Headquarters), which is part of the Komenda G≈Ç√≥wna Policji (Policja Headquarters). On a regional level, voivodeship commands have control of smaller units called SPAP (''Samodzielny Pododdzia≈Ç Antyterrorystyczny Policji'', Independent Anti-terrorism Policja Subunit), these units are responsible for, high-risk arrests, search warrant execution service, hostage rescue operations (only in alarm situations; BOA has priority in this task) and other similar tasks.

Because of their training and skill level, members of the BOA and SPAP units cooperate with similar special police formations from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany and other [[Atlas Network|ATLAS]] members. They also, train with servicemen from [[Biuro Ochrony RzƒÖdu]], [[Stra≈º Graniczna]], [[Internal Security Agency|Agencja Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa Wewnƒôtrznego]], [[Polish Special Forces|Wojska Specjalne]], and most recently with the U.S. Army and 10th CAB's premier special missions company, A/3-10 GSAB WarAngels.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

==Peacekeeping and international cooperation==
Since the Policja's foundation in its current form in 1990, the service has taken part and continues to participate in a number of international peacekeeping and international police missions around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.info.policja.pl/portal/inf/871/Misje_pokojowe.html|title=Misje pokojowe|author=JSK Internet|work=O Policji|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date the Policja has sent officers to participate in the following international peacekeeping missions:
*[[United Nations Mission in Liberia]] (UNMIL) - 3 officers
*[[European Union Police Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (EUPM) - initially 12 officers (2003), later reduced to 3 senior advisers (2009)
*[[European Union Police Mission in Afghanistan]] (EUPOL Afghanistan) - 3 officers and 2 senior advisers
*[[EUMM#EUMM in Georgia|European Union Monitoring Mission in Georgia]] (EUMM) - 10 officers (working alongside 16 officers of the [[≈ªandarmeria Wojskowa]])
*[[European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo]] (EULEX) - 8 senior advisers
In addition to participating in international missions, the Policja also send delegates to and cooperate with international law enforcement agencies and organisations such as [[Europol]] and [[Interpol (organization)|Interpol]]. Currently the Polish officers make up the eighth largest staff contingent of Europol; a figure which is expected to rise as the Polish police force becomes more integrated with, and more active within, the organisation. Europol has also become far more important to Poland's policing community in recent years since Poland, in 2007, became a signatory of the [[Schengen Agreement]], allowing for greater European integration, uninterrupted travel, and cross-border police cooperation. To this end, Polish cooperation with the [[Law enforcement in Germany|German]], [[Czech Police|Czech]], [[Law enforcement in Slovakia|Slovakian]] and [[Law enforcement in Lithuania|Lithuanian]] police services has reached an all-time high. Furthermore, the Policja officers have taken part in a number of foreign police officer training and exchange programs, such as Project Lifesaver, which has seen a number of officers sent to the UK to observe and discuss alternative methods of policing abroad.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wielkopolska.policja.gov.pl/ruchdrogowy/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=143&amp;Itemid=32{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a constituent member of Interpol, the Polish police is expected to adhere to the terms of International arrest warrants and cooperate with the police forces of other nations through formal diplomatic channels. In many cases such cooperation has led to the arrest of high-risk criminals.

==Organisation==
The Polish Police is a centralised police force, organised under one central command in [[Warsaw]] and with all officers assigned to one of 17 [[voivodeship]]/municipal operations' commands, except in the case that they are specialists working independently for the national commandant.

===Police training establishments===
[[Image:Wy≈ºsza Szko≈Ça Policji w Szczytnie-plac apelowy.jpg|thumb|right|Officer candidates arrive at the Higher Police School in [[Szczytno]]]]
The Policja has five training establishments sited within Poland. Four of these training establishments are [[police academy|police schools]] for enlisted personnel, whilst the fifth is a higher educational institution tasked with the education of officers and senior officials in a range of disciplines and expertises. The four junior colleges are located in:
*[[Pi≈Ça]], [[Greater Poland Voivodeship]] - Pi≈Ça Police School ''({{lang|pl|Szko≈Ça Policji w Pile}})''
*[[S≈Çupsk]], [[Pomeranian Voivodeship]] - S≈Çupsk Police School ''({{lang|pl|Szko≈Ça Policji w S≈Çupsku}})''
*[[Katowice]], [[Silesian Voivodeship]] - Katowice Police School ''({{lang|pl|Szko≈Ça Policji w Katowicach}})''
*[[Legionowo]], [[Masovian Voivodeship]] - Police Training Centre ''({{lang|pl|Centrum Szkolenia Policji}})''
The final police training establishment in Poland is the {{lang|pl|Wy≈ºsza Szko≈Ça Policji}} or Higher Police School in [[Szczytno]] ([[Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship]]). This school was founded in 1954 as the officer academy of the [[Milicja Obywatelska]], renamed in 1972 to the Higher Militia School, the college finally became the Higher Police School upon Poland's return to liberal democracy in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wspol.eu/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=15&amp;Itemid=30|title=Information on the School|author=Wojtek|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then it has remained the only establishment in the country certified to run courses for commissioned officers of the Polish police, and the officer's commissioning course. All students who attend the Higher Police School are expected to study criminal, constitutional and economic law. In addition to academic studies, officer candidates are trained in modern policing techniques, weapons' handling, and informatics. The college has numerous links with senior police academies in Europe and throughout the wider world.

==Cricitism of the Policja==
Overall the level of trust in the Policja and its work has increased steadily over the years since 2001. In 2001 only 46% of respondents to a national survey carried out on behalf of the police categorised their work and achievements as 'good', however, by the end of 2009 this figure had grown significantly, and despite small undulations, an average of 72% rated the Policja's work as 'good' or better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policja.pl/palm/pol/70/Opinia_publiczna.html|title=Policja.pl|author=JSK Internet|work=Policja.pl|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This brings the level of trust in the police to around the same level of 64-75% seen in other member states of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rp.pl/artykul/642004.html|title=Zawody godne zaufania Polak√≥w|work=Rzeczpospolita|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much in the same way as other national police forces, the Policja is sometimes criticised for the methods it employs in maintaining law and order, such criticism is typically voiced by Polish youth. This is most commonly expressed with the acronyms (C)[[HWDP]] and JP.

==Representative Band of the Policja==
[[Image:Orkiestra Reprezentacyjna Policji KSP 2010 (5).JPG|thumb|right|A group of musicians from the official Representative Band of the Policja]]
The Policja's representative band was first founded in 1968. Its core was composed of a group of several musicians, which gradually expanded. From the beginning, the band improved rapidly, reaching a high artistic level, as reflected in the discretion of the judges at musical contests nationwide. In the years 1984, 1986, 1988, the band won its most prestigious trophy, the Cup of the Minister of Internal Affairs. From the outset, the musicians performed at various national, departmental, religious and state events.

The band's musicians have on numerous occasions represented the Polish police outside the country, including concerts in Denmark, Belgium, Czech Republic, Belarus and Russia, yet they still value their well-kept tradition of playing performances for the ordinary residents of Warsaw. Its musicians annually take part in the International Congress of Music in Krak√≥w and donate all the proceeds of their performances to a number of charities for the sick and disadvantaged. The band's musical repertoire includes marches, concert pieces, transcriptions of orchestral music and religious songs, as well as a great deal of other developmental music. Being the official representative band of the Policja, the group's musicians are often invited to play parade music for important events on national holidays such as the [[3rd May Constitution|3rd May Constitution Day]].

On the 40th anniversary of the Policja's band, 22 January 2009, a large concert was held at the Bajka theatre in Warsaw. The program included inter alia, a solo performance of the W≈Çodzimierz Korcz theme from the series [[07 zg≈Ço≈õ siƒô]].

The '''Provisional Government of National Union and National Salvation of Cambodia''' ('''PGNUNSC''') was an [[List of states with limited recognition|internationally unrecognized]] and ostensibly [[provisional government]] set up by the [[Khmer Rouge]] on July 11, 1994,&lt;ref&gt;United States Foreign Broadcast Information Service. ''Daily report: East Asia''. Index, Volume 16, Part 2. NewsBank. 1996. p. 456.&lt;/ref&gt; in opposition to the established [[Cambodia|Kingdom of Cambodia]].

==History==
PGNUNSC's Prime Minister was [[Khieu Samphan]] (who was also head of the [[National Army of Democratic Kampuchea|armed forces]]) and its Deputy Prime Minister (in charge also of foreign affairs) was [[Son Sen]]. It was staffed by members of the [[Cambodian National Unity Party]]. Areas it controlled included [[Pailin]] (the capital of the provisional government) and [[Preah Vihear Province|Preah Vihear]] (where it was based.&lt;ref&gt;Alan John Day. ''Political Parties of the World''. 1996. p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;) The Khmer Rouge radio station was also known as the "Radio of the Provisional Government of National Union and National Salvation of Cambodia."&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch. ''Cambodia At War''. 1995. p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Other ministers included Chan Youran, Mak Ben, In Sopheap, Kor Bun Heng, Pich Cheang and Chuon Choeun.&lt;ref&gt;International Federation of Social Science Organizations. ''Transition Regimes: Political and Socio-Economic Transformations''. 1998. p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1996 senior Khmer Rouge official [[Ieng Sary]] defected from the KR with two armed divisions and the formation of his own party, the [[Democratic National Union Movement]], which in turn encouraged more defections from the KR as [[Pol Pot]] ordered the assassinations of [[Son Sen]] (which was successful) and [[Ta Mok]] (which was not.)&lt;ref&gt;Donald F. Busky. ''Communism in History and Theory: Asia, Africa, and the Americas''. Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers. 2002. p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-June 1997 Khieu Samphan (who had by now founded the [[Khmer National Solidarity Party]]) denounced Pol Pot and began discussing demobilization and a return to civilian life.&lt;ref&gt;''Far East and Australasia 2003''. 2002. p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

With Pol Pot's death in April 1998 and widespread sentiment within the Khmer Rouge for an end to an almost 20-year conflict, Khieu Samphan and Ta Mok dissolved the provisional government on June 22, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Sucheng Chan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21613">'''[[Public administration|Public Administration]] Theory''' is the amalgamation of history, organizational theory, social theory, political theory and related studies focused on the meanings, structures and functions of public service in all its forms.  It often recounts major historical foundations for the study of [[bureaucracy]] as well as [[epistemological]] issues associated with public service as a profession and as an academic field.

Generally speaking, there are three different common approaches to understanding public administration: Classical Public Administration Theory, New Public Management Theory, and Postmodern Public Administration Theory, offering different perspectives of how an administrator practices public administration.

Important figures of study include: [[Max Weber]], [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]], [[Luther Gulick (social scientist)|Luther Gulick]], [[Mary Parker Follett]], [[Chester Barnard]], [[Herbert A. Simon]], and [[Dwight Waldo]]. [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] advanced a public administration theory that was informed by [[positivism]]. The influence of positivism today can be seen in journals such as the ''[[Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory]]'' and the ''[[Journal of Policy Analysis and Management]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Whetsell, Travis and Patricia M. Shields (forthcoming) "The Dynamics of Positivism in the Study of Public Administration: A Brief Intellectual History and Reappraisal, [[Administration &amp; Society]]. (doi:10.1177/0095399713490157) Also see Simon, Herbert. 1947 [[Administrative Behavior]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Notable Public Administration Theorist such as Max Weber expressed the importance of values in the development of public administration theory. However, theory cannot simply be derived from  empirical observation of facts, it must be constructed using value judgements that direct our empirical  observations and then guide out interpretation of those observations. Values are essential for the construction of public administration theories because it takes into account the meaningful ethical principles and philosophies of a culture which ensure appropriate theory practice. Public Administration theories are put into practice or considered through a few distinct strategies: Parallel, Transfer, or Collaboration also known as the theory-gap practice. This practice is used to transfer knowledge between practitioners and scholars.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Revisiting the (Lost) Art of Ideal-Typing in Public Administration|last = Stout|first = Margaret|date = December 2010|journal = Administrative Theory &amp; Praxis Political Scientist.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of Public Administration Theory ==
Public Administration Theory recently has been divided into three branches. The three branches are, Classical Public Administration Theory, New Public Management Theory and Postmodern Public Administration Theory. Each of these three branches study Public Administration from a different perspective. These types of theories are some of the ways which an administrator can understand and exercise their duties as a public administrator.

=== Classical Public Administration Theory ===

Classical Public Administration is often associated with [[Woodrow Wilson]] and [[Max Weber]]. In the United States, Woodrow Wilson is known as ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'The Father of Public Administration' ,'' having written "The Study of Administration" in 1887, in which he argued that a bureaucracy should be run like a business.  Wilson promoted ideas like merit-based promotions, professionalization, and a non-political system. Sympathy can lead to downfall in an administration, means there should be pragmatism in bureaucracy.

=== New Public Management Theory ===

New Public Management asset of administrative practices,a consulting fad, and a body of theory that interprets recent developments in public administration. Many scholars argue persuasively that scholars should pay more attention to New Public management as a theory than as a fad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gurus, Theory, and Practice: A Reply to Catlaw and Chapman|journal = Public Administration Review|date = 2007-03-01|pages = 342|volume = 67|issue = 2|first = Stephen|last = Page|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2007.00718.x|jstor=4624570}}&lt;/ref&gt; New public management is part and parcel of the massive intrusion of freemarket values into public space, which threatens to drive out political values altogether. It is worth noting that,in this sense, new public management is the radical opposite of the notion of migrating political values into "private" space in the interest of further democratizing society. However, new public management theory fails to addresses political questions in a meaningful way. This theory looks at [[public administration]] from its roots of [[capitalism]], and goes on through the perspective of [[global capitalism]]. Intentional or not, new public management has served the interests of elites, particularly corporate elites, has degraded the ability of governments to address the public interest, and has served as a vehicle for elevating the apolitical governance of [[free trade]]  and other supranational organizations,which have fully embraced the political philosophy of economic rationalism and new [[managerialism]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = One More Time|url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2753/ATP1084-1806350302|journal = Administrative Theory &amp; Praxis|date = 2013-09-01|issn = 1084-1806|pages = 356‚Äì377|volume = 35|issue = 3|doi = 10.2753/ATP1084-1806350302|first = Sean A.|last = McCandless|first2 = Mary E.|last2 = Guy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Postmodern Public Administration Theory ==


Post-modern public administration is referring to the inner workings of nearly every government entity in existence. Whether it is the congress men and women in Washington D.C. or the [[Department of Public Safety]] representatives located at any DPS office handling the paper work of applicants wanted to obtain a drivers license. The idea of public administration is broad enough to encompass all government positions that affect the public. Members of public administration come in different forms and quantities. When understanding the theory of postmodern public administration, it is important to make a differentiation between postmodern theory and the postmodern era as well as being able to differentiate between post-modernity (period of time) and [[Postmodernism/Philosophy|postmodernism]] (theory/philosophy).

Postmodern theory evolves out of the postmodern era. Chuck Fox and Hugh Miller are two of the main contributors to postmodern theory because they were able to recognize the postmodern condition and how it was playing out in public administration and [[Public policy of the United States|public policy]]. Fox and Miller argue that the traditional approach to public administration "robs public administration theorists of the independence required to imagine more emancipating conditions of work and governance." &lt;ref&gt;Fox, C.J., &amp; Miller, H.T. (1995). ''Postmodern public administration: Bureaucracy, modernity, and postmodernity.'' Tuscaloosa, Alabama: University of Alabama Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller proposes a network model based on economic utility which would explain events better than traditional approach to public administration. Miller states that "policy networks provide a way of processing dissension, articulating values, and airing possible policy implementation strategies. Maneuvering on behalf of the public interest in this complex politically subtle network is the task of post-progressive public administration." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = H.T. | year = 1994 | title = Post-Progressive Public Administration: Lessons from Policy Networks | journal = Public Administration Review | volume = 54 | issue = 4| pages = 378‚Äì386 | doi=10.2307/977386}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory began in the 1990s, even though this theory had been around in other disciplines for a while. An estimation of time could date back to [[Plato]] and his ideas of a public and communal government where there are policy making actions and steps through levels of democracy. This theory has since been revisited and changed through three intellectual movements, interrogating the loop model of democracy, which many have argued that it is largely a myth, showing the symbolic nature of policy and politics in the United States, and discourse theory. One of the downsides of this theory is that it is based on the slippery slope of [[relativism]]. This theory also provides people with the tools to rebuild our infrastructures of symbolic and social order. This theory addresses big questions of what is right and wrong and tries to address the issue to find antidotes for [[anomie]] and [[Relativity Theory (The Outer Limits)|relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;King, Cheryl (September 7, 2015). "Postmodern Public Administration: In The Shadow Of Postmodernism".''Administrative Theory &amp; Praxis''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The founding father of postmodern public administration is commonly referred to as [[Woodrow Wilson]], while many can find his roots of inspiration from the works of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. Using [[Woodrow Wilson]] as a reference point, it can be shown that in his essay The Study of Administration, is it ‚Äútraditionally accepted that with his study, Wilson applied [[Positivism|positivist]] principles to public administration‚Ä¶based on the belief that social reality would be objectively known with the separation of positivist traditional values from facts.‚Äù (Traces of Postmodernism in the New Public Management Paradigm, Kerim Ozcan-Veysel Agca).&lt;ref&gt;√ñzcan, Kerim (Sept. 2010). "Traces of Postmodernism in the New Public Management Paradigm" (PDF).''www.todaie.edu''. Retrieved April 13, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public Administration Theory Development ==
Public Administration theory is derived from several contemporary theory building tools such as Max Weber's Ideal type method. Theories are also derived from studies of evolving governments around the world, such as China's expanding bureaucracy. Different aspects to take into account are: accountability, state-citizen relations, and services for all in times of fiscal scarcity. When developing theories, the most effective theories are the ones tailored for a particular country taking aspects such as values into account. When empirical evidence is the only aspect taken into account it leads to an ineffective policy because the theory will not reflect the values of the citizens, resulting in bad citizen- state relationships.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Theory-Gap Practice is used to analyze the correlations between Public Administration theory and practice. The three fields of the theory gap-practice that describe the relationship between scholars and practitioners are: Parallel, Transfer, and Collaboration strategy.

=== Max Weber's Ideal- Type Method ===
The ideal-type method developed by Max Weber is a useful tool in contemporary public administration theory development because the method takes into account the culture of a society that is then integrated into a theory. Weber referred to it as cultural science or interpretive sociology, which, is to understand ideas and practices from within their own intellectual and cultural horizon and on the basis of categories that are grounded in a meaningful social and historical context. According to Margaret Stout, Ideal-type methods are used to frame observation and analysis and to evaluate what is found. Weber's method must be developed using value judgments that direct our empirical observations and then guide our interpretation of those observations. Through this theory building method, Weber insisted that all interpretations of meaning must remain at best "a peculiarly plausible hypothesis", as opposed to a claim of relevance of a theory. Weber's purpose for using this method is to clarify the importance of values in sense making, but how they are also extremely important for the conduct of meaningful social science.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Weber‚Äôs interpretive sociology employs a type of functional analysis that begins with the whole, proceeds to the parts, and then goes back from the parts to the whole. His ideal-type method is thereby simultaneously useful in both the study of social structure and social action. Social action is linked to subjective meaning at the individual level of analysis, and structural forms are a consequence or construction of social action. This combination is particularly valuable to public administration because the manner in which administrative action and the social structures of governance interrelate requires an approach that considers both. On the one hand, ideal-types enable consideration of things like alternative meanings of important concepts or alternative motivations held by social actors. On the other hand, they enable analysis of associated or resulting social structures. In this way, an ideal-type can concurrently help interpret the meaning of the administrative role as well as critique the institutions of governance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Theory- Gap Practice ===
'''Parallel-''' Proponents of this strategy of relating theory and practice believe that practical knowledge cannot be derived from theories. For the practitioners of this strategy, practice and theory remain separate components of knowledge. Practical knowledge aims to how to handle problems in particular situations while theory aims at handling a specific situation in a general set of principles. Advocates for the parallel strategy claim there can be a complementary relationship between practical and theoretical knowledge or that they can substitute each other in certain situations because particular situations will require practice and theory to work together. Thus advocates that  champion parallel strategy argue that it is essential for management studies to maintain an autonomous communication system.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Parallel, Transfer, or Collaboration strategy of relating theory to practice? A case study of public management debate in Germany.|last = Vogel|first = Rick|date = 2010|journal = Public Administration|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transfer-''' This second strategy  frames the theory-practice problem as one of translating and diffusing research knowledge into management. This strategy confronts the issue of public managers lack of interest or studying of the work of scholars. This is the result of the scholarly work not being easily applicable to practice, and the complexity of the journals, thus knowledge is not being transferred from theory to practice. The transfer strategy proponents claim the popularizing the scholarly work, and making it more relevant to current issues faced in public administration would enhance the transfer of knowledge from scholars to street level bureaucrats and public managers. However, some argue this approach falls short of expectations because many practitioners of public administration have little influence on the content of knowledge offered by scholars.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Collaboration'''- This strategy aims to enhance communication between scholars and practitioners before the theory is developed in order to build a dialectic method of inquiry, building on the idea that communication is necessary throughout the whole theory building process in order to have a well development practical theory.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Scholars Van de Ven and P.E. Johnson put it as:

"Engagement is relationship that involves negotiation and collaboration between researchers and practitioners in a learning community; such a community jointly produces knowledge that can both advance the scientific enterprise and enlighten a community of practitioners." &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Important Figures in Public Administration Theory ==

=== Max Weber  ===
[[File:Max_Weber_1894.jpg|thumb|146x146px|Max Weber, one of the many theorists.]]
Max Weber was a German political economist, social scientist, and renowned Philosopher is an important father to the theory of Public Administration and the bureaucratic side of it. He did extensive research studying ancient and modern states to gather a better perspective of bureaucracies in multiple eras for his Magnum Opus Economy and Society published in 1922. That piece of work has contributed countless insight into the Public Administration Theory. Max Weber considered bureaucracy to be the most rational form of administration yet devised by man. In his writings he asserts that domination is exerted through administration and that for legal domination to take place bureaucracy is required.

=== Woodrow Wilson ===
[[File:Thomas Woodrow Wilson.jpg|left|thumb|157x157px|Thomas Woodrow Wilson, another one of the theorists of Public Administration.]]
Woodrow Wilson defined public administration as a detailed and systematic execution of public law, he divided government institutions into two separate sectors, administration and politics. According to him politics is dealt with policy formulation and questions regarding such, whereas administration is equipped with carrying said policies out. In his own words in his early essay, "The Study of Administration" he said "it is getting to be harder to run a constitution than to frame one." Wilson very much so tried to establish a distinction between politics and administration; he saw administration as a field of business which lies outside politics. He thought the theory of public administration existed simply because of technicalities and was around for the behind the scenes business aspect of politics.

=== Frederick Winslow Taylor ===

Frederick Taylor was an engineer by profession who saw much of life from a scientific aspect. He is a popular less conservative contributor to the Theory of Public Administration in that he produced his own, very popular, theory of traditional public administration, The Scientific Management Theory. He was concerned with finding the best and most efficient way to complete a task for a particular job, reducing the overall labor a worker had to exert with the least amount of movements. Frederick Taylors work approached motivation with a very authoritative, cold, scientific motivator which weighed heavy over any sort of humane aspect to scientific management. Overall many intricacies in Public Administration such as management, control and accounting are subject to scientific principles and Taylor draws on these to find his own, efficient theory approach to Public Administration Theory.

== Public Administration Theory in Practice ==

=== Classical Public Administration- United States ===
Often considered the best way for organizing public sector work, it was used highly in the western world in the 19th and early 20th century. A differing proponent between America and Europe is the transferring of effective management methods between large private and public organizations. The first effective theory in America was Scientific Theory coined by Frederick W. Taylor in 1911. His work "Principles and Methods of Scientific Management" was used to implement ideas that would increase the efficiency of American government. Taylor's ideas of standardizing work, systematic control, and a hierarchical organization were perfect fits for the public sector of the 1940s.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;

=== New Public Management - United Kingdom ===
New Public Management was the prominent theory that inspired health care reforms for the United Kingdom. Its application to health care coincided with the growing expenditures that were being used due to the progress of technology and an aging population. The difference between private and public sectors in terms of budget process and ideology provided a clash of interest. 1990 saw the National Health Service create an internal market of separate care providers and hospitals. This creation of markets in turn stopped the State from being the funder and service provider simultaneously, to just primarily the funder. Although not privatized, these markets became competitive in nature. Assumption that the competition would lead to more empowerment, efficiency, and equity became rampant. Soon the publicly owned hospitals were granted a quasiautonomous status from the District Health Authorities leading to the competition for patients and funds. Their status acquired led to little if any interference in the everyday operations.

=== Postmodern Public Administration - United States ===
Postmodern Public Administration is linked to the capitalist model of the late 20th and 21st century. It relates to globalization, consumerism, and the fragmentation of authority and state. The concepts of science and reason are de-centered and viewed as the defining truths. It tends to negate any faith based actions.&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;

The '''Estrup Cabinet''' was the government of [[Denmark]] from 7 August 1894 to 23 May 1897. It replaced the [[Estrup Cabinet]] and was succeeded by the [[H√∏rring Cabinet]] on 23 May 1897.

'''Romanian National Committee''' ({{lang-ro|Comitetul Na»õional Rom√¢n}}, CNR) was an anti-communist organization of [[Romania]]n post-World War II exiles in the [[Western world|West]]. It claimed to represent a [[government in exile]].

==History==
The committee was established in [[Washington, D.C.]] by the General [[Nicolae RƒÉdescu]], one of the premiers of Romania after the [[King Michael's Coup|overthrow]] of dictator [[Ion Antonescu]] by [[Mihai I of Romania]] and the opposition parties. He was also the last premier of Romania not to be affiliated with the Communists. The committee was one of nine organizations that made up the [[Assembly of Captive European Nations]].&lt;ref name=Committee&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hoover.org/library-and-archives/collections/east-europe/romania/list |title=Romania - List of Archival Holdings. Comitetul National Roman |accessdate=2010-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519200028/http://www.hoover.org/library-and-archives/collections/east-europe/romania/list |archivedate=2011-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of establishment, the committee consisted of ten members from three major pre-war Romanian parties, the [[National Peasants' Party]], the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|Liberal Party]] and a faction of the [[Romanian Social Democratic Party (1927-1948)|Socialist Party]] that rejected its merger into the [[Romanian Workers' Party]]. Former king Mihai I, who had abdicated in 1947, supported the new organization.&lt;ref name=djuvara&gt;{{cite web |last=Djuvara|first=Neagu|authorlink=Neagu Djuvara|url=http://www.memoria.ro/?location=view_article&amp;from_name=Interviuri+din+presa,+carti,+colectii+personale&amp;cid=126&amp;id=926&amp;l=ro&amp;page=1|title = Formarea Comitetului National Rom√¢n|language=Romanian|trans-title=The Formation of the Romanian National Committee|accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The co-founders of the organization were Cornel Bianu (the envoy of [[Iuliu Maniu]] to London during World War II), Alexandru Cretzianu (former Romanian minister in [[Ankara]] and initiator of secret negotiations with the Allies in Cairo in 1944), [[Mihail FƒÉrcƒÉ»ôanu]] (president of the Romanian Liberal Youth Organization), [[Grigore Niculescu-Buze≈üti]] (former Minister of Foreign Affairs), Augustin Popa (former member of the [[Parliament of Romania]]), [[Constantin Vi≈üoianu]] (former Minister of Foreign Affairs, and participant of secret negotiations with the Allies in Cairo in 1944), Iancu Zissu (member of the Independent Socialist Party), Nicolae Caranfil (former Minister of Aviation) and [[Grigore Gafencu]] (former [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Romania)|Minister of Foreign Affairs of Romania]]), the last two having served as ministers during the pre-war dictatorship of King [[Carol II]].&lt;ref name=Committee/&gt; Historian [[Neagu Djuvara]], himself an exil√© at the time, mentions a slightly different composition, excluding Bianu and Buze≈üti, but including Peasants' Party's Emil Ghilezan, liberal VintilƒÉ BrƒÉtianu and trade unioninst Eftimie Gherman. However he acknowledges the important role of Niculescu-Buze≈üti in the creation of the organization.&lt;ref name=djuvara/&gt;

==Charter and members==
The charter of the CNR stated that the purpose of the committee was to represent the Romanian nation and defend its national interests until the "national liberation"; take actions by any possible means to "liberate" Romania and to reestablish a democratic government in the country; coordinate and support the welfare of all Romanian refugees; manage cooperation of Romanian diaspora abroad to arrive at the fulfillment of their purposes. In light of conflicts over administration of controversial funds of the organization four members of the committee (RƒÉdescu, Gafencu, FƒÉrcƒÉ≈üanu, and Caranfil) resigned in summer of 1950. [[Neagu Djuvara]] also mentions the dispute around the inclusion in the committee of a former Romanian minister to Washington as a further cause of the split. Constantin Vi≈üoianu became the new president, either by election or, as Djuvara suggests, appointment by the former king. New members included George Assan, Alexandru Bunescu, Dumitru Ciotori, [[Anton Crihan]], Sabin ManuilƒÉ, and Mihai Rautu.

The committee members split the responsibilities and developed relations with the [[U.S. State Department]], [[United Nations]], foreign ambassadors, other Eastern European national committees; published and disseminated propaganda material about CNR, worked with the media.&lt;ref name=Committee/&gt;

==Activities==
The committee collected data and wrote reports for both U.S. and international officials on political, economic, and social relations of the People's Republic of Romania. Its reports were published in newsletters ''Romania'' and ''La Natione Roumaine''. One of the main purposes of the organization was also lobbying for sanctions against the communist authorities‚Äô abuse of human rights. The committee gradually started using its importance throughout the years and its main sponsor [[National Committee for a Free Europe]] which also funded the Assembly of Captive European Nations and [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], decreased its funding in 1960's due to new American policy of building bridges with the Communist governments of Eastern Europe. In the beginning of 1970's, it was revealed that the National Committee for a Free Europe was actually a [[CIA]]-sponsored organization. In 1972, CNR already lacked any external financial support and had to dissolve.&lt;ref name=Committee/&gt;

[[File:Leopold III van Belgi√´ (1934) (cropped).jpg|thumb|King Leopold III, the subject of the political disagreement, pictured in 1934]]
The '''Royal Question''' ({{lang-fr|Question royale}}, {{lang-nl|Koningskwestie}}) was a major [[political crisis]] in [[Belgium]] that lasted from 1945 to 1951, coming to a head between March and August 1950. The "Question" at stake surrounded whether [[King Leopold III]] could return to the country and resume his royal role as King of the Belgians amid allegations that his actions during [[World War II]] had gone contrary to the provisions of the [[Belgian Constitution]]. It was eventually resolved by the [[abdication]] of Leopold in favour of his son, [[Baudouin of Belgium|Baudouin]], in 1951.

The crisis emerged from the division between Leopold and his government, led by [[Hubert Pierlot]], during the [[Battle of Belgium|German invasion of 1940]]. Leopold, who was suspected of authoritarian sympathies, had taken over command of the [[Belgian Army]] at the outbreak of war. Considering his constitutional position as Commander-in-Chief to take precedence over his civil role as head of state, he refused to leave his army and join the [[Belgian government in exile]] in [[French Third Republic|France]]. Leopold's refusal to obey the Government marked a constitutional crisis and, after having negotiated the surrender to the Germans on 28 May 1940, Leopold was widely condemned. During the subsequent [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|German occupation]], Leopold was held under house arrest in his palace where he was praised for stoically sharing the suffering of ordinary Belgians. Shortly before the [[Allies (World War II)|Allies]] liberated the country in 1944, he was deported to Germany by the Nazis.

With Belgium liberated but the King still in captivity, his brother, [[Prince Charles, Count of Flanders]], was elected [[regent]]. The King was declared officially "unable to rule" in accordance with the Constitution. With the country divided along political lines over whether the King could ever return to his functions, and with the left wing dominant politically, Leopold went into exile in [[Switzerland]]. In 1950, a national referendum was organised by a new centre-right government to decide on whether Leopold could return. Although the result was a victory for the Leopoldists, it produced a strong regional split between [[Flanders]], which was broadly in favour of the King's return, and [[Brussels]] and [[Wallonia]] which generally opposed it. Leopold's return to Belgium in July 1950 was greeted with widespread protests in Wallonia and a [[general strike]]. The unrest culminated in the killing of four workers by police on 31 July. With the situation fast deteriorating, on 1 August 1950 Leopold announced his intention to abdicate. After a transition period, he formally abdicated in favour of Baudouin in July 1951.

==Background==
===Monarchy and the Constitution===
[[File:The Belgian Constitution-Leopold I.JPG|thumb|upright|The Belgian crown symbolically resting on the Constitution in a nineteenth-century statue of [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]]]]
[[Belgium]] gained its independence from the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands|United Netherlands]] in 1830 and was established as a [[Popular monarchy|popular]] and [[constitutional monarchy]] under a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[parliamentary democracy]]. A liberal [[Constitution of Belgium|Constitution]] was written in 1831 which codified the responsibilities and restrictions imposed on the monarch. Although the King, as head of state, was prevented from acting without the approval of a government minister, he was allowed full control of military matters in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief. Which responsibility would take precedence if they became incompatible was left ambiguous and this uncertainty would lie at the heart of the Royal Question.{{sfn|Mabille|2003|p=38}} The first king, [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]], accepted the terms of the Constitution but attempted to use its ambiguities to subtly increase his own powers. This was continued by his successors, although with little real success.{{sfn|Witte|Craeybeckx|Meynen|2009|pp=45‚Äì7}}

===King Leopold III===
[[Leopold III of Belgium|Leopold III]] came to the throne in 1934 after his father, [[Albert I of Belgium|Albert I]], died in a mountaineering accident. Albert, known as the "Knight King" (''roi-chevalier'' or ''koning-ridder''), had been hugely popular in Belgium after commanding the [[Belgian army]] during [[World War I]] (1914‚Äì18) while much of the country was under [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|German occupation]]. Leopold's reign was marked by economic crisis in the wake of the [[Great Depression]], and political agitation by both far-left and far-right parties. Amid this period of crisis, Leopold attempted to expand the powers of the monarch.{{sfn|Witte|Craeybeckx|Meynen|2009|p=189}} He was widely suspected of holding authoritarian and right-wing political views.{{sfn|Le Vif|2013}} From 1936, Leopold was a strong supporter of Belgium's "independence policy" of [[political neutrality]] in the face of [[Nazi Germany]]'s increasingly aggressive territorial expansion.{{sfn|Witte|Craeybeckx|Meynen|2009|p=209}}

==German invasion and occupation, 1940‚Äì44==
{{main article|Battle of Belgium}}
On 10 May 1940, German forces invaded neutral Belgium without a formal declaration of war. Leopold headed immediately to [[Fort Breendonk]], the headquarters of the Belgian army near [[Mechelen]], to take control of the army. He refused to address the Belgian parliament beforehand, as Albert I had famously done at the outbreak of World War I.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=17}} The speed of the German advance, using the new ''[[Blitzkrieg]]'' approach, soon pushed the Belgian army westwards despite British and French support. On 16 May, the Belgian government left Brussels.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=18}}

===Break between King and Government===
[[File:Wijnendale2.jpg|thumb|A modern view of the [[Kasteel van Wijnendale]], where the final meeting between Leopold and the Belgian government took place on 25 May 1940]]
Soon after the outbreak of war, the King and Government began to disagree. While the Government argued that the German invasion had violated Belgian neutrality and made Belgium one of the [[Allies (World War II)|Allies]], Leopold argued that Belgium was still a neutral country and had no obligations beyond defending its borders. Leopold opposed allowing British and French forces into Belgian territory to fight alongside Belgian troops, as a breach of its neutrality.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=18}}

On 25 May 1940, Leopold met senior representatives of his Government for a final time at the [[Kasteel van Wijnendale]] in [[West Flanders]]. The meeting is frequently cited as the start of the Royal Question and the moment of the decisive break between King and Government.{{sfn|Mabille|2003|p=37}} Four ministers of the Government were present: [[Hubert Pierlot]], [[Paul-Henri Spaak]], [[Henri Denis]] and [[Arthur Vanderpoorten]].{{sfn|Mabille|2003|p=37}} By the time of the meeting, against the backdrop of the bloody [[Battle of the Lys (1940)|Battle of the Lys]], the Belgian government was preparing to continue the fight against Germany from exile in France.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=18}} They urged the King to join them, following the examples of [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]] and [[Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg]]. The King rejected their arguments and hardened his own position. He refused to leave Belgian territory and his army in Flanders at any cost. The ministers suspected that Leopold's aides were already negotiating with the Germans.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=18}} The meeting broke up with no agreement and the Belgian Government left for France.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|pp=18‚Äì9}}

Leopold negotiated a cease-fire with the Germans on 27 May 1940, and the Belgian armed forces officially surrendered the following day. Leopold became a [[prisoner of war]] and was placed under house arrest at the [[Royal Palace of Laeken]], near Brussels.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=19}} Furious that the King had both ignored the government and negotiated a surrender without consulting them, Pierlot gave an angry speech on [[Radio Paris]], condemning the King and announcing the Government's intention to continue fighting alongside the Allies.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=19}} French politicians, notably [[Paul Reynaud]], blamed Leopold for the growing disaster of the [[Battle of France]] and angrily condemned him as a "criminal king" (''roi-f√©lon'').{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=19, 103}}

===Leopold during the German occupation===

With the Belgian surrender on 28 May 1940, Belgium was placed under German occupation and [[Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France|a military administration]] was established under General [[Alexander von Falkenhausen]] to govern the country. Belgian civil servants were ordered to remain at their posts in order to ensure the continued functioning of the state and to attempt to protect the population from the demands of the German authorities.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|pp=19‚Äì20}}

With France's defeat and the installation of the pro-German [[Vichy regime]], it was widely believed that Germany was about to win the war. Leopold was hailed as a "martyr" or a symbol of national resilience, in contrast to a Government that appeared to place its ideology above the interests of the Belgian people. On 31 May 1940, the senior representative of the [[Catholic Church]] in Belgium, Cardinal [[Jozef-Ernest van Roey]], circulated a [[pastoral letter]] calling for all Belgians to unite around the King.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|pp=26}} Other figures in the King's entourage, particularly the authoritarian socialist [[Henri De Man]], believed that democracy had failed and that the end of the war would see the King as the ruler of an authoritarian Belgian state.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|pp=26‚Äì7}}

[[File:0 Ch√¢teau Royal de Laeken.JPG|thumb|left|Modern view of the [[Royal Palace of Laeken]], where Leopold was imprisoned during the occupation]]
Imprisoned, the King continued to follow his own political programme. He believed that after the German victory a "[[New Order (Nazism)|New Order]]" would be established in Europe and that, as the senior Belgian figure in occupied Europe, he could negotiate with the German authorities. Leopold corresponded with [[Adolf Hitler]] and tried to organise a meeting with him.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=27}} Hitler remained uninterested and distrustful of the King, but on 19 November 1940 Leopold succeeded in gaining an unproductive audience with him at [[Berghof (residence)|Berchtesgaden]].{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|pp=27‚Äì8}}

Popular support for Leopold in Belgium declined sharply in December 1941 when news of Leopold's remarriage to [[Lilian Baels]] was made public.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=28}} The marriage was deeply unpopular with the Belgian public.{{efn|Leopold's first wife, [[Astrid of Sweden|Astrid]], had been killed in a car accident in 1935 and remained hugely popular with the public. By contrast, Baels, who had no noble title and came from [[Flanders]], was considered ''[[nouveau riche]]'' and her political influence over the king distrusted.{{sfn|Conway|2012|p=32}} }} The image of the "prisoner-king" (''roi prisonnier''), sharing the suffering of the Belgian prisoners of war, was undermined and his popularity fell sharply, especially in [[Wallonia]], the home of the majority of the Belgian prisoners still detained.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=28}}{{sfn|Mabille|2003|p=39}} Popular opinion also turned on the king for his perceived unwillingness to speak out against German occupation policies.{{sfn|Conway|2012|p=32}}

Amid German defeats against the Russians on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] after 1942, the King prepared for the end of the war. He ordered the preparation of a document, known as the Political Testament (''Testament Politique''), which would justify his behaviour under the occupation and detail his interventions on behalf of Belgian prisoners of war and deported workers. Leopold however continued to condemn the action of the [[Belgian government in exile]] (based in [[London]] after October 1940). On 7 June 1944, following [[D-Day]], he was deported to Germany.{{sfn|Mabille|2003|p=39}} He was finally liberated by American forces on 7 May 1945.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|pp=28‚Äì9}}

==Regency and the early crisis, 1944‚Äì49==

===Leopold declared "unable to reign", 1944===
[[File:Karel van Belgi√´ Charles de Belgique Karl von Belgien.jpg|thumb|upright|Prince Charles, Count of Flanders, who was installed as regent in 1944]]
After D-Day, Allied troops crossed the Belgian frontier on 1 September 1944. German forces did little to oppose the liberating forces, which by 4 September were in control of Brussels, although the last occupied parts of Belgian territory were only liberated in February 1945. On 8 September 1944, the government in exile returned to Brussels and was greeted with general indifference.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=106}} Although the King was no longer in the country, his Political Testament was presented to the returned Government as he had wished, and was soon circulated publicly.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=106}} At the same time, a copy was presented to the British king, [[George VI]], and was seen by the Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]]. The text reignited the divisions within the Government which had been largely hidden since earlier in the war.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|pp=106‚Äì7}}

Since the King was still in German custody, there was no opposition to the creation of a [[regent]] in his absence. On 20 September 1944, a meeting of both Chambers of Parliament was called. Article 82 of the Constitution{{efn|Subsequent constitutional revisions have shifted the "inability to reign" clause, formerly Article 82, to its current position as Article 93 of the Constitution.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=109}} The clause itself remains unchanged and was again enforced for a 24-hour period in 1990 to allow a law legalising [[abortion]] to pass without the signature of [[Baudouin of Belgium|King Baudouin]].{{sfn|Witte|Craeybeckx|Meynen|2009|p=266}} }} was invoked, declaring the King "unable to reign" (''dans l'impossibilit√© de r√©gner'').{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=109}} Leopold's reclusive brother, [[Prince Charles, Count of Flanders]], was elected [[regent]] and took the oath the following day.{{sfn|Mabille|2003|p=39}} Further action on the Royal Question was pushed aside by more pressing economic and political issues that occupied most of the Government's time.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=109}}{{sfn|Conway|2012|pp=141‚Äì3}} With Belgium under partial Allied military administration until the restoration of the government services, British hostility to Leopold's return also complicated the issue.{{sfn|The Independent|1996}}

===Political recovery and revival of the Royal Question===
Soon after the liberation, Belgium [[Belgian economic miracle|began a period of rapid economic recovery]] and the process of political reconstruction began. The traditional party system had been torn apart by the war and occupation. The two major ideological blocks proceeded to create their own parties: socialists created the [[Belgian Socialist Party]] (PSB‚ÄìBSP), while Catholics and conservatives created the [[Christian Social Party (Belgium, defunct)|Christian Social Party]] (PSC‚ÄìCVP).{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=111}} The biggest change in early post-liberation politics was the surge of support for the [[Communist Party of Belgium]], which become the third party in Belgian politics until 1949, temporarily displacing the [[Liberal Party (Belgium)|Liberal Party]].{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=111}} The [[Walloon Movement]] also re-emerged after the war, promoting the culture and economic interests of the French-speaking areas in the south. The period saw major reform of [[trade unions]] following the creation of the first large unified union, the [[General Federation of Belgian Labour]] (FGTB‚ÄìABVV), in April 1945 with 248,000 members nationwide.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=112}} By 1947, however, the political structure of the Belgian state had stabilised.{{sfn|Conway|2012|p=12}}

[[File:Pregny-Chamb√©sy Campagne Reposoir (3).jpg|thumb|left|The Villa le Reposoir in [[Pregny-Chamb√©sy|Pregny]], [[Switzerland]] where Leopold spent the years 1945 to 1950 in exile]]
Under the early regency, both the Pierlot and subsequent [[Achille Van Acker]] governments attempted to avoid confronting the issue of Leopold's return despite calls from Communists, some Socialists and trade unionists for the King's abdication in April and May 1945.{{sfn|Witte|Craeybeckx|Meynen|2009|p=240}} Soon after the King's liberation, Van Acker and a government delegation headed to [[Strobl]], [[Allied-occupied Austria|Austria]] to negotiate with Leopold. At a series of meetings between 9 and 11 May 1945, Van Acker insisted that the King publicly announce his support for the Allied cause and his commitment to parliamentary democracy.{{sfn|Witte|Craeybeckx|Meynen|2009|p=240}}{{sfn|Conway|2012|p=139}} No agreement was reached.{{sfn|Witte|Craeybeckx|Meynen|2009|p=240}} In the meantime, Leopold took up residence in [[Pregny-Chamb√©sy|Pregny]] (near [[Geneva]]) in [[Switzerland]] under the pretext that [[Palpitations|heart palpitations]] made further negotiations or thoughts of return to political life impossible.{{sfn|Witte|Craeybeckx|Meynen|2009|p=241}}{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=125}}

In Belgium, political debate about the Royal Question continued and grew after the war, and remained a polemical topic in the popular press, notably in the Francophone newspaper ''[[Le Soir]]''. In the [[Belgian general election, 1949|general election of 1949]],{{efn|The [[Belgian general election, 1949|1949 general election]] was the first vote held in Belgium under truly [[universal suffrage]] following the extension of the vote to all Belgian women in March 1948.{{sfn|Mabille|2003|p=43}}}} the PSC‚ÄìCVP campaigned on a pro-Leopold royalist platform.{{sfn|Witte|Craeybeckx|Meynen|2009|p=241}} The results reshaped the political landscape; the Communists were routed{{efn|The [[Communist Party of Belgium]] saw its share of the vote fall from 12.68 per cent to just 7.48 in the 1949 elections. By 1954, it was gaining just 3.57 per cent of the vote and never recovered its earlier influence.{{sfn|Conway|2012|p=232-3}} }} and the PSB‚ÄìBSP lost seats to both the Liberals and Catholics. The Catholics gained a new majority in the [[Senate (Belgium)|Senate]] and a plurality in the [[Chamber of Representatives (Belgium)|Chamber of Representatives]], their best results since the war.{{sfn|Witte|Craeybeckx|Meynen|2009|p=241}} [[Gaston Eyskens]] took over as Prime Minister at the head of a Liberal-Catholic coalition. Both parties in the government (and Leopold himself) supported a referendum on the King's return, which became the focus of political attention.{{sfn|Witte|Craeybeckx|Meynen|2009|p=241}}

==Culmination of the crisis, 1950==

===Referendum of March 1950===
{{main article|Belgian monarchy referendum, 1950}}
The Eyskens government agreed to a national [[referendum]], known as the "popular consultation" (''consultation populaire'' or ''volksraadpleging''), which was scheduled for 12 March 1950.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=139}} It was the first such vote in Belgian history and was intended to be advisory. Campaigning was vigorous on both sides, with little disruption to the polls, despite the contentious nature of the subject.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=140}} 

The results of the referendum were indecisive. Leopold's return won a 58 per cent majority in the national vote, with majorities in seven of [[Provinces of Belgium|the nine provinces]]. However, the vote was heavily divided by region.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=140}} In Flanders, 72 per cent voted in favour of Leopold's return, but in the ''[[arrondissement]]'' of Brussels, the Leopoldists won only a minority of 48 per cent. In Wallonia a mere 42 per cent voted for the restitution of the King.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=141}} The final results, in percentages by province, were:{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=141}}

{{Royal Question referendum}}

The result confirmed the worries of some, including Spaak, that the vote would not be sufficiently decisive in either direction and could divide the country along regional and linguistic lines. On 13 March, Eyskens traveled to Pregny to attempt to encourage Leopold to abdicate.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=142}} [[Paul Van Zeeland]] and Spaak attempted to broker a new agreement by which Leopold would abdicate in favour of his son.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=142}} On 15 April 1950, Leopold announced that he was willing to temporarily delegate his authority.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=142}} Many within the PSC‚ÄìCVP realised that, despite the referendum's result, their party's lack of a parliamentary majority would undermine their ability to build a national reconciliation around the King as long as their Liberal coalition partners and Socialist opponents were unwilling to accept the King's return.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|pp=142‚Äì3}}

===Leopold's return to Belgium===
On 29 April 1950, Charles [[Dissolution of parliament|dissolved parliament]] pending fresh elections. His intention was probably to prevent the formation of a PSC‚ÄìCVP government under Van Zeeland, a staunch Leopoldist, which would lead to the return of the King without further discussion.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=143}} The [[Belgian general election, 1950|following election]] produced an absolute PSC‚ÄìCVP majority in both Chamber and Senate,{{efn|The PSC‚ÄìCVP bicameral majority produced by the election of 1950 was the last to be gained by any single party in Belgian political history.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=143}} }} and a new single-party government under [[Jean Duvieusart]] was formed.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=143}}

One of the first acts of the Duvieusart government was to introduce a bill bringing the "impossibility to reign" to an end. On 22 July 1950, Leopold returned to Belgium for the first time since June 1944 and resumed his functions.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=143}}

===General strike and abdication===
[[File:Plake Gr√•ce Bierleu nos moirts.jpg|thumb|left|Memorial plaque at [[Gr√¢ce-Hollogne|Gr√¢ce-Berleur]], near [[Li√®ge]], commemorating the four workers shot dead by Belgian police on 30 July 1950]]
In 1949, the FGTB‚ÄìABVV voted a special budget of ten million [[Belgian franc]]s to establish a Committee of Common Action (''Comit√© d'action commune'') aimed at supporting strike action taken in event of the King's return. The union took the lead in the opposition which emerged in the summer of 1950. [[Andr√© Renard]], a Walloon trade union leader, called for "insurrection" and "revolution" in the newspaper ''La Wallonie'' shortly after the King's return in July 1950.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=144}} Modern historians have noted that "the smell of revolution was on the air" as Walloon nationalists called for the immediate secession of Wallonia and the creation of a republic.{{sfn|Witte|Craeybeckx|Meynen|2009|p=242}}

The general strike of 1950 began in the coal mining centres of [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]] and quickly spread. Workers were soon on strike across Wallonia, Brussels, and, to a lesser extent, Flanders. The [[port of Antwerp]] was one of the key sites affected and the country was virtually paralysed.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=144}} On 30 July, four workers were shot dead by the ''[[Gendarmerie (Belgium)|Gendarmerie]]'' at [[Gr√¢ce-Hollogne|Gr√¢ce-Berleur]], near [[Li√®ge]] and the violence intensified.{{sfn|Witte|Craeybeckx|Meynen|2009|p=242}} Staunch Leopoldists in the Government called for a stronger stance but found themselves in a minority, even in the PSC‚ÄìCVP. Frustrated at the lack of progress, the Government threatened to resign ''en masse''.{{sfn|Witte|Craeybeckx|Meynen|2009|p=242}}

As the situation escalated, the National Confederation of Political Prisoners and their Dependents (''Conf√©d√©ration nationale des prisonniers politiques et des ayants droit'', '' Nationale Confederatie van Politieke Gevangenen en Rechthebbenden'', or CNPPA‚ÄìNCPGR), the organisation representing [[political prisoner]]s detained during the German occupation, offered to act as intermediaries between the different parties because of their respected status.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=145}} The CNPPA‚ÄìNCPGR succeeded in persuading both parties to reopen negotiations. A tense meeting between the King and Government took place during the night of 31 July to 1 August at Laeken. In the afternoon on 1 August, Leopold publicly announced his intention to abdicate in favour of his eldest son, [[Baudouin of Belgium|Baudouin]], to avoid further bloodshed.{{sfn|Witte|Craeybeckx|Meynen|2009|p=242}} Baudouin, at the age of 19, formally became [[Crown prince|prince royal]] on 11 August 1950.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|pp=145‚Äì6}}

==Accession of Baudouin, 1951==
[[File:Anefo 911-3016 Tweede dag (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Baudouin of Belgium|King Baudouin]], photographed in 1960, who succeeded Leopold in 1951]]
Leopold's abdication message of 1 August 1950 was premised on a reconciliation in the person of his eldest son over the course of a year.{{sfn|Mabille|2003|p=41}} Baudouin was seen by most parties as an acceptable alternative candidate. Under a law of 11 August, executive powers were transferred to Baudouin in advance of the official abdication. Leopold formally abdicated on 16 July 1951. His son succeeded him the following day.{{sfn|Witte|Craeybeckx|Meynen|2009|p=242}}

===Assassination of Julien Lahaut===
On 11 August 1950, as Baudouin was taking the oath of allegiance to the Constitution in front of the Parliament, an unidentified individual in the Communist benches shouted "''vive la r√©publique!''" ("Long Live the Republic!"). The interruption caused outrage.{{sfn|G√©rard-Libois|Lewin|1992|p=148}} It was widely suspected that the culprit was [[Julien Lahaut]], the noted Communist leader and [[Stalinist]] who had been one of the leading opponents of Leopold's return. A week later (18 August), Lahaut was shot dead by an unidentified assassin outside his house in [[Seraing]], near Li√®ge.{{sfn|G√©rard-Libois|Lewin|1992|p=148}} The murder shocked the Belgian public and an estimated 200,000 people attended Lahaut's funeral.{{sfn|G√©rard-Libois|Lewin|1992|p=148}} Although no-one was ever prosecuted for the murder, it was widely attributed to clandestine Leopoldist militia like the ''Ligue Eltrois'' or the ''Bloc anticommuniste belge'' who operated with the knowledge of the security services.{{sfn|G√©rard-Libois|Lewin|1992|p=147}}

==Aftermath and significance==
In the aftermath of the Royal Question, national priorities shifted to other political questions. On 17 September 1950, the government of [[Joseph Pholien]] announced its intention of dispatching [[Belgian United Nations Command|Belgian volunteers]] to fight in the [[Korean War]].{{sfn|G√©rard-Libois|Lewin|1992|p=173}} Negotiations about the [[European Defence Community]] followed and, by the mid-1950s, Belgium was immersed in a new political crisis, known as the [[Second School War]], surrounding the secularisation of education.{{sfn|Mabille|2003|pp=44‚Äì5}} In August 1960 Baudouin informed Prime Minister [[Gaston Eyskens]] that he did not have confidence in his government and asked for his resignation. Eyskens refused and challenged the King to invoke Article 65 of the Constitution and unilaterally revoke his ministerial mandate. Fearing that such an action would reopen the Royal Question, Baudouin yielded.{{sfn|Young|1965|p=326}}

Modern historians describe the Royal Question as an important moment in Belgian recovery after World War II. The opposition between Leopoldists and anti-Leopoldists led to the re-establishment of Socialist and Catholic political parties from before the war.{{sfn|Conway|2012|p=12}} The Question was also an important moment in the Belgian linguistic conflict. It also put an end to the federalisation of Belgian institutions which might exacerbate the regional tensions exposed by the Royal Question.{{sfn|Conway|2012|p=253}} In addition, the perceived failure of the PSC‚ÄìCVP to realise Flemish demands for the return of Leopold helped to strengthen support for the [[Flemish Movement|Flemish nationalist]] ''[[People's Union (Belgium)|Volksunie]]'' party after 1954.{{sfn|Conway|2012|p=265}} In Wallonia, the legacy of trade union and socialist political mobilisation during the general strike paved the way for a left-wing revival of the [[Walloon Movement]].{{sfn|Conway|2012|p=265}}

The Lahaut assassination was not solved, and it remains contentious as the only political murder in Belgian history apart from the death of the socialist politician [[Andr√© Cools]] in 1991. Leopoldists were suspected, but no individual was prosecuted in the aftermath. An enquiry by historians Rudy Van Doorslaer and Etienne Verhoeyen named an alleged culprit.{{sfn|G√©rard-Libois|Lewin|1992|pp=147‚Äì8}} A final report, commissioned by the Belgian government, was submitted in 2015.{{sfn|RTBF|2015}}

'''Sallie Watson (Penny) Chisholm''' is a U.S. [[Marine biology|biological oceanographer]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. She is an expert in the ecology and evolution of ocean microbes.

==Education==
Chisholm graduated from Marquette Senior High School in [[Marquette, MI]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.miningjournal.net/page/content.detail/id/584288/National-medalist.html |title=National Medalist |publisher=[[The Mining Journal]] |date=2013-02-09 |accessdate=2013-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended [[Skidmore College]] and earned a Ph.D. from [[SUNY Albany]] in 1974.

==Professional work==
Chisholm has been a faculty member at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] since 1976. Her research has focused on the ecology of marine [[phytoplankton]].&lt;ref name=MedalofSci&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cee.mit.edu/news/releases/2013/Chisholm-national-medal-of-science |title=Sallie (Penny) Chisholm awarded the National Medal of Science, the nation‚Äôs highest honor for scientists |publisher=MIT |date=2013-02-19 |accessdate=2013-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chisholm's early work focused on the processes by which such plankton take up nutrients and the manner in which this affects their life cycle on diurnal time scales. This led her to begin using [[flow cytometry]] which can be used to measure the properties of individual cells.

The application of flow cytometry to environmental samples led Chisholm and her collaborators (most notably R.J. Olson and H.M. Sosik) to the discovery that small plankton (in particular ''[[Prochlorococcus]]'' and ''[[Synechococcus]]'') accounted for a much more substantial part of marine productivity than had previously been realized. Previously, biological oceanographers had focused on silicaceous [[diatoms]] as being the most important phytoplankton, accounting for 10-20 gigatons of carbon uptake each year. Chisholm's work showed that an even larger amount of carbon was cycled through these small algae, which may also play an important role in the global [[nitrogen cycle]].

In recent years, Chisholm has played a visible role in opposing the use of [[iron fertilization]] as a [[technological fix]] for [[anthropogenic climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7262/full/461347a.html |title=Ocean fertilization: time to move on |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |date=2009-09-17 |accessdate=2013-03-09 |volume=461|doi=10.1038/461347a |pages=347‚Äì348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors and awards==
Chisholm has been a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) since 2003 and a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] since 1992.

In January 2010, she was awarded the [[Alexander Agassiz Medal]], for "pioneering studies of the dominant photosynthetic organisms in the sea and for integrating her results into a new understanding of the global ocean." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=01202010b |title=Academy Honors 17 for Major Contributions to Science |publisher=Office of News and Public Information, [[United States National Academies|The National Academies]] |accessdate=2010-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was a co-recipient in 2012 of the Ruth Patrick Award from the [[Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography]].&lt;ref name=MedalofSci /&gt;

Chisholm received the [[National Medal of Science]] from President [[Barack Obama]] on February 1, 2013.&lt;ref name=MedalofSci /&gt;

In 2013, she was awarded the [[Ramon Margalef Prize in Ecology]], ‚Äúfor being one of the most productive, charismatic and active researchers on biology and marine ecology‚Äù.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ub.edu/web/ub/en/menu_eines/noticies/2013/10/045.html |title=Scientific forum on oceans and climate with the participation of Sallie W. Chisholm, Ramon Margalef Prize in Ecology 2013 |publisher=Universitat de Barcelona |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 24, 2018, she was awarded the Doctor of Science degree by [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/05/harvard-awards-seven-honorary-degrees/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Service Children's Education''' ('''SCE''') is an organisation of the [[HM Government|United Kingdom government]] responsible for the education of the children of [[British Armed Forces]] families and [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD) personnel serving outside of the [[United Kingdom]]. They provide [[school]]s and educational support services from [[Foundation Stage]] through to [[sixth form]]. They are headquartered at [[Trenchard Lines]], [[Upavon]], [[Wiltshire]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/277236/0961.pdf SERVICE CHILDREN'S EDUCATION ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2012-2013]" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6Wh82dV6A Archive]).

"Any enquiries regarding this publication should be sent to us at Headquarters Service Children's Education, Trenchard Lines, Upavon, Wiltshire"&lt;/ref&gt;

It was previously an [[executive agency]] of the MoD, but this status was removed on 31 March 2013 following the reduction of service personnel based abroad. However, it continues to operate under the SCE name as part of the MoD's Directorate Children and Young People (DCYP).

==History==
{{Main|British Families Education Service}}
During the 1980s, the [[British Families Education Service]] (BFES) was renamed Service Children's School (SCS). In 1997 it took its current name Service Children's Education (SCE). Despite the various changes to the name and administration, it continues the mission of its predecessors: providing education for the children of [[British Armed Forces]] personnel. Former teachers who taught in SCE schools or under its previous incarnations the BFES and SCS may join the BFES/SCE Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=British Families Education Service/Service Children's Education Association archive: History|url=http://libguides.ioe.ac.uk/content.php?pid=452102&amp;sid=3704784|publisher=[[Institute of Education]]|date=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curriculum==
Schools follow the English [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]], administer national assessments and public examinations, and are inspected by Her Majesty's Inspectorate, via [[Ofsted]]. Teachers have recognised UK professional qualifications and the majority are recruited specially from the United Kingdom through the [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|Civil Service]].

==Schools==
The agency operates primary and secondary schools in Germany and Cyprus and also provides educational facilities in territories such as the [[Falklands]] and [[Gibraltar]] where there is a significant British military presence. The schools are typically grouped by garrison (including its outlying bases).

[[File:FREE-logo square black.png|alt=The Far-Right Extremism in Europe Initiative (The FREE Initiative)|thumb|The Far-Right Extremism in Europe Initiative (The FREE Initiative)]]
'''The Far-Right Extremism in Europe Initiative''' ('''The FREE Initiative''') is an online resource for practitioners responding to far-right extremism and violence.&lt;ref&gt;The FREE Initiative, Website http://thefreeinitiative.com/&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded with support from the [[European Commission]] Prevention of and Fight Against Crime Programme, and a project led by the [[Ministry of Justice (Sweden)]] in partnership with the [[Ministry of Social Affairs (Denmark)]], [[Ministry of Security and Justice (Netherlands)]], [[Ministry of Justice and Public Security|Royal Norwegian Ministry of Justice and Public Safety]], and the [[Ministry of the Interior (Finland)]].&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, List of awarded projects, 2011 http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/financing/fundings/pdf/isec/isec_2011_awarded_projects.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first project endorsed by governments and funded by the European Commission solely on far-right extremism and radicalisation in the aftermath of the [[2011 Norway attacks]] perpetrated by a [[far-right terrorist]] [[Anders Behring Breivik]].&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, List of awarded projects, 2011 http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/financing/fundings/pdf/isec/isec_2011_awarded_projects.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The online resource launched on 1 September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Vidhya Ramalingam, Huffington Post, 1 September 2015 http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/vidhya-ramalingam/europes-problem-with-far-right-violence_b_5747484.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
The FREE Initiative initially involved ten European countries pooling and sharing their knowledge and understanding of the extreme right-wing threat.&lt;ref&gt;Royal United Services Institute, The Use of Monitoring and Evaluation in Countering Violent Extremism https://www.rusi.org/downloads/assets/201406_Learning_and_Adapting.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vidhya Ramalingam, Huffington Post, 1 September 2015 http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/vidhya-ramalingam/europes-problem-with-far-right-violence_b_5747484.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publicity==
The resource was endorsed by [[Cecilia Malmstr√∂m]], former EU Commissioner for Home Affairs, who stated "Right-wing extremism is increasing right now and it is very worrying. We see it in almost all countries. It is important now to stand up for our values."&lt;ref&gt;The FREE Initiative, Website http://thefreeinitiative.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Birgitta Ohlsson]], Minister for EU Affairs and Democracy Policy publicly stated: "As responsible Minister for democracy policy as well as for European affairs, I am glad that Sweden is leading a comprehensive project in order to collect good practice from across Europe how to prevent and counter the violence-promoting far-right...It is our sincere aim and hope that this project will contribute to a lasting network of practitioners across all the member states of the European Union and that these violent environments, who know of no borders, may be countered jointly."&lt;ref&gt;Institute for Strategic Dialogue, website http://www.strategicdialogue.org/sweden-actionresearch/&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech to the [[Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]], Jasenko Selimovic, Former Swedish State Secretary describes the project as "aiming to identify, collect and disseminate best practice regarding the prevention and the countering of far-right extremism across Europe." &lt;ref&gt;Jasenko Selimovic, speech http://www.swedenabroad.com/ImageVaultFiles/id_12690/cf_347/Opening_statement.DOCX&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Norwegian [[Minister of Justice and Public Security]] [[Grete Faremo]] publicly stated, "I believe this is a very important initiative which will provide valuable insight about the nature of the threat as well as effective ways of responding to the threat. And I am grateful for the possibility for Norway to participate in this project."&lt;ref&gt;Grete Faremo, speech https://www.regjeringen.no/en/aktuelt/empowering-local-actors-to-counter-viole/id712992/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Films==
The FREE Initiative includes videos with former perpetrators of far-right extremism and survivors of far-right violence, including [[Bj√∏rn Ihler]], a survivor of the 22 July attacks in Norway and a peace activist, who has gone on to tell his story more widely.&lt;ref&gt;Bj√∏rn Ihler, The Guardian, 23 October 2015 https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/23/trollhattan-killer-extremist-anders-behring-breivik&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy guidance==
The FREE Initiative has produced country context reports, a policy recommendations report, and a practitioners‚Äô handbook.&lt;ref&gt;Vidhya Ramalingam, Old Threat, New Approach: Tackling the Far-Right Across Europe http://www.strategicdialogue.org/ISD_New_Approach_Far_Right_Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vidhya Ramalingam, On the Front Line: A guide to countering far-right extremism http://www.strategicdialogue.org/On_The_Front_Line_Far_RightHANDBOOK.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[the Guardian]], European policymakers from 10 countries met on 13 February 2014 at a meeting hosted by the Swedish Ministry of Justice to discuss policy recommendations from The FREE Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;Vidhya Ramalingam, The Guardian, 13 February 2014 https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/13/european-far-right-on-the-rise-how-to-tackle&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financing==

The '''Waterloo Ceremony''' is an annual event in which the [[Duke of Wellington (title)|Duke of Wellington]] pays a symbolic rent for his residence to the reigning Monarch.  The ceremony takes place at [[Windsor Castle]] each year on the 18th of June.

==History==
[[Stratfield Saye House]] in Hampshire was bought by the people of the UK for the first Duke of Wellington; a gift for winning the [[Battle of Waterloo]].

Every year, the current [[Duke of Wellington (title)|Duke of Wellington]] pays the symbolic rent to the reigning Monarch in the form of a flag.

==The Ceremony==
A silk French tricolour, with gold embroidery, and imprinted with the year of presentation upon it, is handed to [[Elizabeth II|HM The Queen]] by the Duke on the anniversary of the victory of the battle, while the Queen is at Windsor.  Therefore, a new flag is produced each year.

Once the Queen is presented with the flag, it is taken by the [[Master of the Household|Castle Superintendent]], to the Guard Chamber, and is placed above a bust of the [[first Duke of Wellington]].

[[File:Mrplandreform1.jpg|thumb|250px|Shah [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] hands out documents of ownership of land to new owners, white revolution, land reform, 1963.]]
The '''White Revolution''' ({{lang-fa|ÿßŸÜŸÇŸÑÿßÿ® ÿ≥ŸÅ€åÿØ}} ''EnqelƒÅb-e Sefid'') or the '''Shah and People Revolution''' ({{lang-fa|ÿßŸÜŸÇŸÑÿßÿ® ÿ¥ÿßŸá Ÿà ŸÖÿ±ÿØŸÖ}} ''EnqelƒÅb-e ShƒÅh va Mardom'') was a far-reaching series of reforms in [[Iran]] launched in 1963 by [[Shah]] [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] and lasted until 1979. Mohammad Reza Shah‚Äôs reform program was built especially to weaken those classes that supported the traditional system. It consisted of several elements, including [[land reform]], sale of some state-owned factories to finance this land reform, construction of an expanded road, rail, and air network, a number of dam and irrigation projects, the eradication of diseases such as malaria, the encouragement and support of industrial growth, enfranchisement of women, nationalization of forests and pastures, formation of literacy and health corps for rural isolated areas, and institution of profit sharing schemes for workers in industry. In the 1960s and 1970s the shah sought to develop a more independent foreign policy and established working relationships with the [[Soviet Union]] and eastern European nations. In subsequent decades, per capita income for Iranians skyrocketed, and oil revenue fueled an enormous increase in state funding for industrial development projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Amir Arjomand, Said|title=The Turban for the Crown: The Islamic Revolution in Iran |location=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1988|pages=72‚Äì73|isbn=9780195042580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shah advertised the White Revolution as a step towards modernization, but there is little doubt that he also had political motives; the White Revolution (a name attributed to the fact it was bloodless&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iran: The White Revolution|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842491,00.html|work=Time Magazine|accessdate=10 March 2011|date=11 February 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a way for him to legitimize the Pahlavi dynasty. Part of the reason for launching the White Revolution was that the Shah hoped to get rid of the landlords' influence and create a new base of support among the peasants and working class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Siavoshi, Sussan|title=Liberal Nationalism in Iran: The failure of a movement|location=Boulder, Colorado|publisher=Westview Press|year=1990|page=23|isbn=978-0-8133-7413-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bayar, Assef|chapter=Historiography, class, and Iranian workers|editor=Lockman, Zachary|year=1994|title=Workers and Working Classes in the Middle East: Struggles, Histories, Historiographies|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, New York |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=BFzOVmj1iCIC&amp;pg=PA198 198] |isbn=978-0-7914-1665-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of the program was aimed at Iran‚Äôs peasantry, a class the Shah hoped to gain as an ally to thwart the threat of the increasingly hostile middle class.&lt;ref name="Bill-33"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Bill, James A.|title=Modernization and Reform from Above: The Case of Iran| journal=The Journal of Politics|volume=32|number=1|year=1970|page=33|doi=10.2307/2128863}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the White Revolution in Iran represented a new attempt to introduce reform from above and preserve traditional power patterns. Through land reform, the essence of the White Revolution, the Shah hoped to ally himself with the peasantry in the countryside, and hoped to sever their ties with the aristocracy in the city.&lt;ref name="Bill-33" /&gt;

In order to legitimize the White Revolution, the Shah called for a national referendum in early 1963 in which 5,598,711 people voted for the reforms, and 4,115 voted against the reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Milani, Moshen M.|title=The Making of Iran‚Äôs Islamic Revolution|location=Boulder, Colorado|publisher=Westview Press|year=1988|page=85|isbn=978-0-8133-7293-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; What the Shah did not expect was that the White Revolution lead to new social tensions that helped create many of the problems the Shah had been trying to avoid.  Land reform, instead of allying the peasants with the government, produced large numbers of independent farmers and landless laborers who became loose political cannons, with no feeling of loyalty to the Shah. As [[Ervand Abrahamian]] pointed out, "The White Revolution had been designed to preempt a [[October Revolution|Red Revolution]]. Instead, it paved the way for an [[Islamic Revolution]]."&lt;ref name="Abrahamian 2008 pages=139‚Äì140"&gt;{{harvnb|Abrahamian|2008|pages=139&amp;ndash;140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the White Revolution contributed towards the economic and technological advancement of Iran, the failures of some of the land reform programs and the partial lack of [[Democratization|democratic reforms]], as well as severe antagonism towards the White Revolution from the clergy and [[landed elite]]s, would ultimately contribute to the Shah's downfall and the [[Iranian Revolution]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Graham, Robert |title=Iran: The Illusion of Power |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=inIfxTWgfegC |location=London |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=1980|pages=19, 96 |isbn=0-312-43588-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reforms==
[[File:Womenelection1963.jpg|thumb|Women voting for the first time in 1963.]]
Mohammad Reza Shah had intended it to be a [[non-violent]] regeneration of Iranian society through economic and social [[Reform movement|reforms]], with the ultimate long-term aim of transforming Iran into a global economic and industrial power. The Shah introduced novel economic concepts such as profit-sharing for workers and initiated massive government-financed heavy industry projects, as well as the nationalization of forests and pastureland. Most important, however, were the [[land reform]] programs which saw the traditional landed elites of Iran lose much of their influence and power. Nearly 90% of Iranian [[Sharecropping|sharecropper]]s became landowners as a result.

Socially, the platform granted women more rights and poured money into [[education]], especially in the [[rural]] areas. The ''Literacy Corps'' was also established, which allowed young men to fulfill their compulsory military service by working as village literacy teachers.

The White Revolution consisted of 19 elements that were introduced over a period of 16 years, with the first 6 introduced in 1962 and put to a national referendum on January 26, 1963.

# '''Land Reforms Program and Abolishing "Feudalism"''': The government bought the land from the feudal land lords at what was considered to be a fair price and sold it to the peasants at 30% below the market value, with the loan being payable over 25 years at very low interest rates. This made it possible for 1.5 million peasant families, who had once been little more than slaves, to own the lands that they had been cultivating all their lives. Given that the average size of a peasant family was 5, the land reforms program brought freedom to approximately 9 million people, or 40% of Iran's population.
# '''Nationalization of Forests and Pasturelands''': Many measures were introduced, not only to protect the national resources and stop the destruction of forests and pasturelands, but also to further develop and cultivate them. More than 9 million trees were planted in 26 regions, creating 70,000 acres (280&amp;nbsp;km¬≤) of "green belts" around cities and on the borders of the major highways.
# '''Privatization of the Government Owned Enterprises''', selling shares in manufacturing plants and factories to the public and the old feudal lords, thus creating a whole new class of factory owners who could now help to industrialize the country.
# '''Profit Sharing''' for industrial workers in private sector enterprises, giving the factory workers and employees 20% share of the net profits of the places where they worked and securing bonuses based on higher productivity or reductions in costs.
# '''Extending the Right to Vote to Women''', who previously did not enjoy this right. This measure was criticized by some of the clergy.
# '''Formation of the Literacy Corps''', so that those who had a high school diploma and were required to serve their country as soldiers could do so by fighting illiteracy in the villages. In 1963 approximately 2/3 of the population was illiterate, with 1/3 found mainly in the capital city of Tehran.
# '''Formation of the Health Corps''' to extend public health care throughout the villages and rural regions of Iran. In 3 years, almost 4,500 medical groups were trained; nearly 10 million cases were treated by the Corps.
# '''Formation of the Reconstruction and Development Corps''' to teach the villagers the modern methods and techniques of farming and keeping livestock. Agricultural production between 1964 and 1970 increased by 80% in tonnage and 67% in value.
# '''Formation of the Houses of Equity''' where 5 village elders would be elected by the villagers, for a period of 3 years, to act as arbitrators in order to help settle minor offences and disputes. By 1977 there were 10,358 Houses of Equity serving over 10 million people living in over 19,000 villages across the country.
# '''Nationalization of all Water Resources''', introduction of projects and policies in order to conserve and benefit from Iran's limited water resources. Many dams were constructed and five more were under construction in 1978. It was as a result of these measures that the area of land under irrigation increased from 2 million acres (8,000&amp;nbsp;km¬≤), in 1968, to 5.6 million in 1977.
# '''Urban and Rural Modernization and Reconstruction''' with the help of the Reconstruction and Development Corps. Building of public baths, schools and libraries; installing water pumps and power generators for running water and electricity. [[File:Education Corp.jpg|thumb|Women in military forms as Education Corp.]]
# '''Didactic Reforms''' that improved the quality of education by diversifying the curriculum in order to adapt to the necessities of life in the modern world.
# '''Workers' Right to Own Shares in the Industrial Complexes''' where they worked by turning industrial units, with 5 years history and over, into public companies, where up to 99% of the shares in the state-owned enterprises and 49% of the shares of the private companies would be offered for sale to the workers of the establishment at first and then to the general public.
# '''Price Stabilization''' and campaign against unreasonable profiteering (1975). Owners of factories and large chain stores were heavily fined, with some being imprisoned and other's licenses being revoked. Sanctions were imposed on multi-national foreign companies and tons of merchandise stored for speculative purposes were confiscated and sold to consumers at fixed prices.
# '''Free and Compulsory Education''' and a daily free meal for all children from kindergarten to 14 years of age. In 1978, 25% of Iranians were enrolled in public schools alone. In that same year there were 185,000 students of both sexes studying in Iran's universities. In addition to the above there were over 100,000 students pursuing their studies abroad, of which 50,000 were enrolled in colleges and universities in the United States.
# '''Free Food for Needy Mothers''' and for all newborn babies up to the age of two.
# '''Introduction of Social Security and National Insurance''' for all Iranians. The National Insurance system provided for up to 100% of the wages during retirement.
# '''Stable and Reasonable Cost of Renting or Buying of Residential Properties''' (1977). Controls were placed on land prices and various forms of land speculation.
# '''Introduction of Measures to Fight against Corruption''' within the bureaucracy. The Imperial Inspection Commission was founded, consisting of representatives from administrative bodies and people of proven integrity.

==Results==
[[File:Unrest in Iran.ogv|thumb|[[National Archives and Records Administration|NARA]] Newsreel about unrest in Iran following the White Revolution, 1963.]]
There was a minor industrial revolution during this period of reform. Port facilities were improved, the Trans-Iranian Railway was expanded, and the main roads connecting Tehran and provincial capitals were asphalted. Many small factories opened up specializing in clothing, food processing, cement, tiles, paper, and home appliances. Larger factories for textiles, machine tools, and car assembly were also opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Abrahamian, Ervand]]|year=2008|title=A History of Modern Iran|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|page=133|isbn=978-0-521-82139-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educational institutions also grew after the launching of the White Revolution. Enrollment in kindergarten increased from 13,300 to 221,990, elementary schools from 1,640,000 to 4,080,000, secondary schools from 370,000 to 741,000 and colleges from 24,885 to 145,210. Not only were new schools opening, but they were also instituting new educational policies designed to undercut clerical control over education and religious education. The Literacy Corps also helped raise the literacy rate from 26 to 42 percent. The White Revolution also included certain reforms of women‚Äôs rights. Women gained the right to vote, to run for elected office and to serve as lawyers and later judges. The marriageable age for women was also raised to fifteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abrahamian|2008|pages=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was true that Iran had made progress with various social programs from the White Revolution, but it was equally true that Iran still had one of the worst infant mortality rates and doctor-patient ratios in the Middle East. It also had one of the lowest percentages of people who were receiving a higher education. For example, 68 percent of the adult population still remained illiterate, and 60 percent of children did not complete primary school.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abrahamian|2008|pages=141&amp;ndash;142}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resentment and anger towards the Shah‚Äôs failed reforms seems to have united the people against the Shah, and certainly did not increase any class loyalty towards the Shah, as he had intended.

== Problems ==
[[File:Hoveydacabinet1974.jpg|thumb|Prime Minister [[Amir Abbas Hoveida]] and his cabinet in anniversary of the reforms, 1974.]]
Land reform, which was the focus of the White Revolution, did what it was intended to do, weaken the nobles and landlords. In their place, though, emerged a new group of commercial farmers, and many previously large landowning families, such as the Pahlavi family, managed to renovate themselves into these commercial farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abrahamian|2008|pages=131&amp;ndash;132}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rapid expansion of small landowners did occur, but the peasantry as a whole did not acquire land. Only roughly half of the rural population received any land, and many of the people who did receive land did not receive enough to sustain themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Siavoshi|1990|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of the White Revolution was that the rural population could be separated into three groups: prosperous farmers, small landowners, and village laborers. The first group was the only group to really benefit from the land reforms, and this group consisted of former village headmen, bailiffs, and some former landlords. The second group consisted of sharecroppers who received no more than 10 hectares of land. Most of these people ended up trading their land in for shares in state cooperatives. The last group received no land at all, and survived as farm hands, laborers, or shepherds. Many of them migrated to urban centers for work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abrahamian|2008|pages=131&amp;ndash;139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[File:Mpr1963.jpg|thumb|left|Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi speaking about the principles of the White Revolution]]
In the beginning, the White Revolution received most of its criticism from two main groups: the clergy, and the landlords. The landlords were angry about the land reforms because their land was bought by the government and then sold in smaller plots to the citizenry at a lower price. They also did not appreciate the government undercutting their authority when it came to dealing with peasants or land laborers.

The powerful [[Shia Islam|Shƒ´‚Äòah]] [[clergy]] were also angered at the reforms that removed much of their traditional powers in the realms of education and [[family law]], as well as lessening their previously strong influence in the rural areas.  A "large percentage of the upper echelon of the clergy came from landowning families" deeply affected by the reform and much absentee rent income went directly to the clergy and their institutions.  The rents from an estimated 10,000 villages whose rents helped finance the clerical establishment were eligible for redistribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackey|1996|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group, or more appropriately, the man who most openly opposed the White Revolution and the Shah himself was [[Ruhollah Khomeini]]. Although the clergy in Iran were not happy about many aspects of the White Revolution, such as granting suffrage to women, and the secular local election bill as well as land reforms, the clergy as a whole were not actively protesting. Khomeini, on the other hand, seemed to undergo a serious change of thought from the traditional role and practices of Shi‚Äôi clergy, and actively spoke out against the new reforms and the Shah. Khomeini's famous speech at [[Feyziyeh School]] in June 1963 spoke out against the Shah's brutality towards student protests, and for the first time, it was a speech attacking the Shah as a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milani|1988|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; This speech did lead to Khomeini's exile, but being outside of Iran did not stop Khomeini's protests, nor did it weaken his influence inside Iran.

Khomeini also attacked provisions of the reforms that would allow members of Iran's non-Muslim minority to be elected or appointed to local offices:

{{quote|I have repeatedly pointed out that the government has evil intentions and is opposed to the ordinances of Islam. ... The Ministry of Justice has made clear its opposition to the ordinances of Islam by various measures like the abolition of the requirement that judges be Muslim and male; henceforth, Jews, Christians, and the enemies of Islam and the Muslims are to decide on affairs concerning the honor and person of the Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;''Islam and Revolution,'' p.175&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A couple months later on [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]], Khomeini gave an angry speech attacking the Shah as a "wretched miserable man"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Moin, Baqer |title=Khomeini: Life of the Ayatollah |publisher=Thomas Dunne Books |year=2000|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two days later, on June 5, Khomeini was arrested. This sparked three days of rioting and left several hundred dead. The riots were remembered in speeches and writings as the time when the army "slaughtered no less than 15,000".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Khomeini, Ruhollah |editor=Algar, Hamid (translator and editor) |title=Islam and Revolution : Writing and Declarations of Imam Khomeini |publisher=Mizan Press |location=Berkeley | year=1981|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khomeini was released from house arrest in April 1964 but sent into exile that November.

In late 1978, there has been widespread dissatisfaction among Iranian farmers with regards to land reforms which were supposed to empower them. The Shah's reforms overvalued grandiose inefficient industries over agriculture leading to a sense of negligence among the farmers. Mismanagement and corruption resulted in waste of many funds designated for agricultural development. Emigrations to cities resulted in more demand that could be met by production. Even though reforms turned many peasants into land-owners it imposed on them costs such as taxes, purchase of seeds, water and equipment that they were not entitled to when they worked for landowners, while also eliminating services such as health and education that were provided for them by landlords under the traditional system. Influx of agricultural imports from US also reduced the farmers' market share.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1978/12/29/farmers-dislike-shahs-land-reform/23ae91f4-59fc-43aa-b118-e73b291c3273/|title=Farmers Dislike Shah's Land Reform|last=Branigin|first=William|date=1978-12-29|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-07-13|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What the Shah did not expect was that the White Revolution led to new social tensions that helped create many of the problems the Shah had been trying to avoid. The Shah's reforms more than quadrupled the combined size of the two classes that had posed the most challenges to his monarchy in the past‚Äîthe intelligentsia and the urban working class. Their resentment towards the Shah also grew since they were now stripped of organizations that had represented them in the past, such as political parties, professional associations, trade unions, and independent newspapers. Land reform, instead of allying the peasants with the government, produced large numbers of independent farmers and landless laborers who became loose political cannons, with no feeling of loyalty to the Shah. Many of the masses felt resentment towards the increasingly corrupt government; their loyalty to the clergy, who were seen as more concerned with the fate of the populace, remained consistent or increased. As Ervand Abrahamian pointed out, ''The White Revolution had been designed to preempt a Red Revolution. Instead, it paved the way for an Islamic Revolution.''&lt;ref name="Abrahamian 2008 pages=139‚Äì140"/&gt;

The White Revolution‚Äôs economic "[[Trickle-down economics|trickle-down]]" strategy also did not work as intended. In theory, oil money funneled to the elite was supposed to be used to create jobs and factories, eventually distributing the money, but instead the wealth tended to get stuck at the top and concentrated in the hands of the very few.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abrahamian|2008|pages=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important and relevant consequence of the White Revolution and the reforms it brought, was the rising popularity of Ruhollah Khomeini. With the growing perception of government corruption, and the implementation of reforms through the White Revolution, Khomeini grew to be an outspoken political enemy of the Shah. The White Revolution was the catalyst for Khomeini‚Äôs change in thought. Once Khomeini, as a respected member of the clergy, started to openly oppose the Shah and call for his overthrow, people of all different professions and economic status began to see him as a figure to rally behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milani|1988|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long-term consequences===

Though the White Revolution contributed towards the economic and technological advancement of Iran, the failures of some of the [[land reform]] programs and the partial lack of [[Democratization|democratic reform]]s, as well as severe antagonism towards the White Revolution from the clergy and [[landed elite]]s, would ultimately contribute to the Shah's downfall and the [[Iranian Revolution]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Graham, Robert|title=Iran, the Illusion of Power |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |year=1980|pages=19, 96 |isbn=0-312-43588-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
